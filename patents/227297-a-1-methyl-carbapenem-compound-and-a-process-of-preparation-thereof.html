CRYSTAL OF 1-METHYL CARBAPENEM COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to crystalline forms of 1-<br>
methylcarbapenem compounds that exhibit excellent antibiotic<br>
activity against various bacterial strains and are stable enough<br>
to keep for a long time, and have high producability or handling<br>
ease. This invention is directed to medicaments containing a<br>
crystalline form of the present invention as an active<br>
ingredient (and particularly pharmaceutical compositions for the<br>
prevention or treatment of bacterial infections). This<br>
invention is directed to the use of a crystalline form of the<br>
present invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the<br>
prevention or treatment of bacterial infections. This invention<br>
is directed to methods for preventing or treating bacterial<br>
infections which comprise administering an effective amount of a<br>
crystalline form of the present invention to a warm-blooded<br>
animal in need of such prevention or treatment. Further this<br>
invention is directed to processes for the preparation of<br>
crystalline forms of the present invention.<br>
Background Art<br>
The 1-methylcarbapenem compound of the following formula<br>
is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication (Kokai)<br>
Hei-10-204086 and Hei-11-71277.<br><br>
This compound (I) exhibits excellent antibiotic activity not<br>
only against Gram-negative bacterial strains but also against<br><br>
Gram-positive bacterial strains and can be expected to become a useful antibiotic<br>
agent.<br>
Specific crystalline forms of this compound (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salt thereof are disclosed in Japanese Patent No.2001-72681 and Japanese<br>
Patent Application Publication (Kokai) No.2002-161034. Although said crystalline<br>
forms have superior storage stability and easy handling as compared with<br>
lyophilized powders, it cannot necessarily be assumed that there is no problem at<br>
all with respect to producability and storage stabiligy.<br>

pyrrolidin-4-ylthio]-6-[(lR)-1-hydroxyethyl]-1-methyl-1-carbapen-2-em-3-<br>
carboxylic acid tetrahydrate (1-2). The diffraction pattern was obtained with Cu<br>
Ka irradiation of λ = 1.54 Å. The vertical axis of the X-ray powder diffraction<br>
pattern indicates the diffraction intensity in units of counts/second (cps). The<br>
horizontal axis indicates diffraction angle as the value 2θ.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Therefore, the inventors made many efforts in order to solve these problems and<br>
have succeeded in obtaining certain novel crystalline forms of compound (I). The<br>
inventors have found that these crystalline forms of compound (I) have superior<br>
producability and storage stability compared to the crystalline forms described in<br>
the examples of Japanese Patent Application Publication (Kokai) No.2001-72681,<br>
and are extremely useful medicaments, especially, practically useful antibiotic<br>
agents, thereby leading to completion of the present invention.<br>
More specifically, the crystalline form 1 to be described later can be produced<br>
both in high yield and by a simple procedure, does not require special drying<br>
conditions in the drying step, and has improved storage stability under dry<br>
conditions. The crystalline form 2 to be described later can be produced by a<br>
simple procedure, does not require a drying step or can be dried in a short<br>
period of time, and is handled easily since it is stable during storage under<br>
conditions of normal or high humidity. The crystalline form 3 to be described<br>
later containing a specific amount of water can be produced in high yield and by<br>
a simple procedure, does not require a drying step or can be dried in a short<br>
period of time, and is handled easily since it is stable during storage under<br>
conditions of normal or high humidity.<br><br>

Publication (Kokai) No. 2001-7268, hereinafter referred to as<br>
crystalline form 3);<br><br>
(6)	a process for preparation of the crystalline form 3<br>
comprising causing the crystalline form 1 to absorb water;<br>
(7)	the crystalline form 1 wherein the water content is 0.5<br>
to 2% by weight;<br>
(8)	the crystalline form 2 wherein the water content is 8 to<br>
10% by weight; and<br><br>
(9) a pharmaceutical composition comprising an above<br>
crystalline form of the present invention as an active<br>

In the above description,<br>
the 1-methylcarbapenem compound of formula (I) is<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication (Kokai)<br>
Hei-10-204086 and Hei-11-071277 and exhibits potent antibiotic<br>
activity against a wide spectrum of bacterial strains ranging<br>
from Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacterial strains.<br>
The compound (I) can exist as pharmacologically<br>
acceptable salts. The term "a pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salt" as used herein and in the claims is intended to include<br>
salts which are usually able to be used as medicaments.<br>
The compound (I) has basic groups such as a tertiary<br>
amino group and a guanidino group in its molecule and can be<br>
converted to a corresponding pharmacologically acceptable acid<br>
addition salt when treated with an appropriate acid employing<br>
conventional techniques. Examples of such acid addition salts<br>
include inorganic acid salts such as hydrochlorides,<br>
hydrobromides, sulfates and phosphates; organic acid salts such<br>
as carbonates, acetates, benzoates, oxalates, maleates,<br>
fumarates, tartrates and citrates; and sulfonates such as<br>
methanesulfonates, benzenesulfonates and p-toluenesulfonates.<br>
The compound (I) has an acidic group such as a carboxyl<br>
group in its molecule and can be converted to a corresponding<br>
pharmacologically acceptable base addition salt when treated<br>
with an appropriate base employing conventional techniques.<br>
Examples of such base addition salts include alkali metal salts<br>
such as sodium salts, potassium salts and lithium salts;<br>
alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium salts and magnesium<br>
salts; metal salts such as aluminium salts, iron salts, zinc<br>
salts, copper salts, nickel salts and cobalt salts; and<br>
quaternary ammonium salts such as ammonium salts.<br><br>
In addition, when allowed to stand in the air, certain<br>
forms of the compound (I) and pharmacologically acceptable salts<br>
thereof may absorb or adsorb water and can form hydrates. In<br>
certain cases forms of the compound (I) and pharmacologically<br>
acceptable salts thereof absorb certain solvents and can form<br>
solvates. The compound (I) of this invention and<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof include such hydrates<br>
and solvates.<br>
Such salts, hydrates and solvates are preferably sodium<br>
salts, hydrochlorides, sulfates, carbonates, hydrates or<br>
ethanolates; most preferably carbonates, hydrates or ethanolates.<br>
The compound of formula (1-1) represents the ethanolate<br>
of the compound (I). The compound of formula (1-2) represents<br>
the tetrahydrate of the compound (I).<br>
The crystalline forms of the present invention are<br>
solids which have regular arrangements of atoms (group of atoms)<br>
in a three-dimensional structure and repeat the arrangements.<br>
The crystals are different from an amorphous solid that has no<br>
such a regular arrangement of atoms in a three-dimensional<br>
structure.<br>
In general, certain compounds produce a plurality of<br>
crystalline forms (polymorphic crystals) according to<br>
crystallization conditions, crystals of which are different in<br>
their three-dimensional arrangement of atoms and in their<br>
physicochemical properties. This invention may include each of<br>
such crystalline forms and mixtures of two or more thereof.<br>
The crystalline form of the 1-methylcarbapenem compound<br>
of formula (1-1) shows main peaks at interplanar spacings d =<br>
7.60, 6.69, 6.33, 6.14, 5.15, 4.58 and 4.48 in the X-ray powder<br>
diffraction pattern obtained with Cu Kα irradiation of λ = 1.54<br>
Å.<br>
The crystalline form of the 1-methylcarbapenem compound<br>
of formula (I-2) shows main peaks at interplanar spacings d =<br><br>
11.68, 8.79, 7.53, 6.57, 5.58, 5.37, 3.99 and 3.09 in the X-ray<br>
powder diffraction pattern obtained with Cu Kα irradiation of A.<br>
= 1.54 A.<br>
Effect of the Invention<br>
Among crystalline forms of compound (I) or a<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, the crystalline forms<br>
of the present invention have superior producability and storage<br>
stability, and are useful in industrial production.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The 1-methylcarbapenem compound of formula (I) can be<br>
prepared by the same technique as described, or by a similar<br>
procedure to that described in Japanese Patent Application<br>
Publication (Kokai) Hei-10-204086 and Hei-11-071277.<br>
The crystalline forms of the present invention can be<br>
obtained, for example, by<br>
dissolving the compound (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salt thereof in an appropriate solvent which can readily<br>
dissolve it,<br>
if necessary, concentrating the solution, adding to the solution<br>
an appropriate solvent which can slightly dissolve compound (I)<br>
or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof or cooling the<br>
solution in order to lead a supersaturated solution and hence to<br>
crystallization, and<br>
isolating the crystals and then drying the crystals.<br>
Precipitation of the crystals can be spontaneous in the<br>
vessel, or precipitation can also be initiated or accelerated by<br>
addition of crystalline seeds or by mechanical stimulation such<br>
as ultrasonic wave irradiation and scratching on the surface of<br>
the vessel.<br>
Pharmacologically acceptable salts of compound (I) are<br>
preferably hydrochlorides, sulfates or carbonates. The<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salts can be prepared by addition<br>
of a necessary amount of a desired acid or base to a solution of<br><br>
compound (I).<br>
When solutions of the compound (I) or a<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof are treated, the<br>
solutions of these compounds are usually treated at 0°C to 60°C<br>
in order to avoid decomposition of these compounds; preferably<br>
at 0°C to 25°C.<br>
The preferred temperature for crystallization of these<br>
compounds is at 0°C to 10°C.<br>
Examples of methods of concentration of solutions of the<br>
compound (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof<br>
include an evaporation method using a rotary evaporator under<br>
reduced or normal pressure upon heating and a concentration<br>
method using a reverse osmotic membrane. The reverse osmotic<br>
membrane used in concentration of an aqueous solution can be<br>
selected from polyacrylonitrile membranes, polyvinyl alcohol<br>
membranes, polyamide membranes and cellulose acetate membranes.<br>
Examples of solvents which can readily dissolve compound<br>
(I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof include water,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide and methanol, preferably<br>
water.<br>
Examples of solvents which can slightly dissolve<br>
compound (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof<br>
include alcohols having two to four carbon atoms such as ethanol,<br>
propanol and butanol; ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl<br>
ketone; ethers such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; and<br>
esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate; preferably<br>
ethanol or acetone; most preferably ethanol.<br>
The starting compound (I) which is isolated as a<br>
lyophilized powder can be used. A crude preparation containing<br>
compound (I) can also be used because it can be purified by<br>
crystallization.<br>
Supersaturation can be accomplished, for example, by<br>
concentration of an aqueous solution of compound (I) at 30°C to<br>
60°C to a saturated aqueous solution, followed by gradually<br>
cooling to 0°C to 10°C or by gradual addition of an appropriate<br><br>
solvent which can slightly dissolve compound (I) or a<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, such as ethanol or<br>
acetone, to the saturated aqueous solution, if necessary,<br>
followed by cooling.<br>
Crystalline forms of this invention are preferably<br>
precipitated by concentrating aqueous solutions of compound (I)<br>
or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, if necessary,<br>
followed by the addition of a solvent which can slightly<br>
dissolve these compounds, followed by cooling.<br>
More preferably, crystalline forms of this invention are<br>
precipitated by concentrating aqueous solutions of compound (I)<br>
or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, if necessary,<br>
followed by the addition of ethanol or acetone, and then cooling.<br>
Most preferably, crystalline form 1 is precipitated by<br>
concentrating aqueous solutions of compound (I) followed by the<br>
addition of sodium hydrogencarbonate and ethanol, followed by<br>
cooling; and, crystalline form 2 is precipitated by cooling<br>
aqueous solutions of compound (I), followed by addition of<br>
sodium hydrogencarbonate and acetone, followed by cooling, or is<br>
precipitated by cooling aqueous solutions of compound (I).<br>
The precipitated crystals can be isolated, for example,<br>
by filtration, centrifugation or decantation. If necessary, the<br>
isolated crystals can be washed with an appropriate solvent.<br>
Preferably the crystals are washed with the solvent used for<br>
crystallization.<br>
Isolated crystalline form 1 is dried at 10°C to 50°C,<br>
preferably at 20°C to 30°C until the weight of the crystalline<br>
form becomes constant. If necessary, crystalline form 1 may be<br>
dried in the presence of drying agents such as silica gel and<br>
calcium chloride under reduced pressure.<br>
Crystalline form 2 can be obtained by drying under<br>
reduced pressure or by allowing the crystalline form to stand at<br>
10°C to 60°C, preferably at 20°C to 30°C, and at a humidity of<br>
30% or more, preferably at a humidity of 70% to 90%, for 30<br><br>
minutes to 2 days, preferably for 6 hours to 1 day.<br>
Crystalline form 1 thus obtained has improved storage<br>
stability under dry conditions, and crystalline form 2 is<br>
handled easily since it is stable during storage under<br>
conditions of normal or high humidity.<br>
Crystalline form 1 of the present invention can be<br>
converted to crystalline form 3 described in Japanese Patent<br>
Application Publication (Kokai) No. 2001-72681 by humidifying.<br>
In addition, crystalline form 3 can be conversely converted to<br>
crystalline form 1 by drying.<br>
When crystalline form 1 is converted to crystalline form<br>
3, the conversion is achieved, for example, by allowing to stand<br>
undisturbed at 10°C to 60°C, preferably at 20°C to 30°C, and at a<br>
humidity of 30% or more, preferably at a humidity of 50% to 70%,<br>
for 30 minutes to 2 days, preferably for 6 hours to 1 day.<br>
When crystalline form 3 is converted to crystalline form<br>
1, the conversion is achieved, for example, by drying under<br>
reduced pressure at 10°C to 60°C, preferably at 15°C to 25°C, for<br>
2 hours to 2 days, preferably for 12 hours to 1 day, or by<br>
allowing to stand at 10°C to 60°C, preferably at 20°C to 30°C, at<br>
a humidity of 20% or less, preferably at a humidity of 10% or<br>
less, for 2 hours to 2 days, preferably for 6 hours to 1 day.<br>
As previously described, crystalline form 1 and<br>
crystalline form 3 can have different degrees of water<br>
absorption depending on the environment. Even if their degrees<br>
of water absorption differ, they are each included in<br>
crystalline form 1 or crystalline form 3 of the present<br>
invention provided they demonstrate an X-ray powder diffraction<br>
pattern that is the same as that of crystalline form 1 or<br>
crystalline form 3, respectively. Their degrees of water<br>
absorption can be measured and determined, for example,<br>
according to ordinary methods such as the Karl Fischer method.<br>
They can be represented in terms of, for example, their water<br>
content. The water content of crystalline form 1 is preferably<br><br>
0.5% to 2%. If the water content is lower than this range,<br>
harsh drying conditions may be necessary resulting in increased<br>
production costs. Conversely, if the water content is higher<br>
than this range, there may be an increased risk of the<br>
crystalline form 1 converting to crystalline form 3. In<br>
addition, the water content of crystalline form 3 is preferably<br>
3% to 12%, more preferably 8% to 10%. If the water content is<br>
lower than this range, there may be an increased risk of the<br>
crystalline form 3 converting to crystalline form 1. Conversely,<br>
if the water content is higher than this range, the crystalline<br>
form may be more difficult to handle. In this manner, when<br>
crystalline forms 1 and 3 have their water contents within these<br>
ranges, they have particularly superior storage stability, and<br>
since there are no fluctuations in quality at normal temperature<br>
and normal humidity, they have extremely easy handling making<br>
them suitable for practical use as a medicament, particularly as<br>
an antibiotic agent.<br>
Crystalline form 3 having a specific water content as<br>
described above can be handled easily since it remains stable<br>
during storage under conditions of normal or high humidity.<br>
The crystalline forms of this invention exhibit a wide<br>
spectrum of antibiotic activity and potent antibacterial<br>
activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains and<br>
anaerobic bacteria, as well as bacteria producing<br>
cephalosporinase. When the antibacterial activities of the<br>
crystalline forms of this invention were determined by the agar-<br>
plate dilution method, they exhibited potent antibacterial<br>
activities against various bacteria, for example, Gram-positive<br>
strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant<br>
Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus<br>
and the like; Gram-negative strains such as Escherichia coli,<br>
Bacillus dysenteriae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris,<br>
Serratia, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the<br>
like; and anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis.<br>
Moreover, the crystalline forms of this invention exhibited<br><br>
potent antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori which<br>
is often detected in the patients with chronic gastritis and<br>
peptic ulcers.<br>
When appropriate solutions of the crystalline forms of<br>
this invention were administered to mice, they exhibited long<br>
half-value periods of blood concentration and good urinary<br>
recovery compared to those of similar compounds known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
In addition, when the crystalline forms of this<br>
invention were subcutaneously administered to mice infected<br>
systemically with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus<br>
pneumoniae, Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, they<br>
exhibited excellent treatment effect. The crystalline forms of<br>
this invention, therefore, are useful as medicaments (especially<br>
antibacterial agents) as well as bulk powders for the production<br>
thereof.<br>
When the crystalline forms of this invention are used as<br>
medicaments (especially as antibacterial agents), they can be<br>
administered alone or as a mixture of said crystalline forms of<br>
this invention and a pharmacologically acceptable excipient(s)<br>
and diluent(s); they can be administered in various dosage forms<br>
such as tablets, capsules, granules, powders or syrups for oral<br>
administration, such as injections for parenteral administration<br>
or such as ointments for topical application.<br>
