DESCRIPTION<br>
1,2-DI(CYCLIC)SUBSTITUTED BENZENE COMPOUNDS Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   l,2-di(cyclic)substituted   benzene compounds which are useful as cell adhesion inhibitors or cell infiltration inhibitors, as well as to their salts and to hydrates of the foregoing.<br>
The present invention relates to l,2-di(cyclic)substituted benzene compounds which are useful as therapeutic or prophylactic agents for inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases, as well as to their salts and to hydrates of the foregoing.<br>
The invention further relates to 1,2-di(cyclic)substituted benzene compounds which are useful as therapeutic or prophylactic agents for various diseases associated with adhesion and infiltration of leukocyte, such as inflammatory bowel disease (particularly ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma and atonic dermatitis, as well as to their salts and to hydrates of the foregoing. Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Inflammatory reaction is accompanied by infiltration of leukocytes, typically neutrophils and lymphocytes, into inflammatory sites.<br>
Infiltration of leukocytes is defined as migration of leukocytes such as neutrophils and lymphocytes out of vessels and into the surrounding tissues as a consequence of initiation and activation by cytokines, chemokines, lipids and complement to interact called "rolling" or "tethering" with vascular endothelial cells activated by cytokines such as IL-1 or TNFa, followed by adhesion to the vascular endothelial cells.<br>
[0003]<br>
As explained below, relationship between leukocyte adhesion or infiltration and various inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases was reported. Such reports have raised the possibility that compounds having cell adhesion inhibitory action or cell infiltration inhibitory action may serve as therapeutic or prophylactic agents for such diseases.<br><br>
(1)	Therapeutic or prophylactic agents for inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative<br>
colitis, Crohn's disease and the like) (see Non-patent documents 1, 2 and 3)<br>
(2)	Therapeutic or prophylactic agents for irritable bowel syndrome (see Non-<br>
patent document 4)<br>
(3)	Therapeutic or prophylactic agents for rheumatoid arthritis (see Non-patent<br>
document 5)<br>
(4)	Therapeutic or prophylactic agents for psoriasis (see Non-patent document 6)<br>
(5)	Therapeutic or prophylactic agents for multiple sclerosis (see Non-patent<br>
document 7)<br>
(6)	Therapeutic or prophylactic agents for asthma (see Non-patent document 8)<br>
(7)	Therapeutic or prophylactic agents for atopic dermatitis (see Non-patent<br>
document 9)<br>
[0004]<br>
Thus, substances which inhibit cell adhesion or cell infiltration are expected to be useful as therapeutic or prophylactic agents for inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases and as therapeutic or prophylactic agents for various diseases associated with adhesion and infiltration of leukocytes, such as inflammatory bowel disease (particularly ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma and atopic dermatitis.<br>
[0005]<br>
Compounds are also known which have anti-inflammatory action based on inhibition of adhesion of leukocyte and vascular endothelial cell, or anti-inflammatory action based on inhibition of leukocyte infiltration (these will hereinafter be referred to as cell adhesion inhibitors and cell infiltration inhibitors, respectively), such as the following compound:<br><br><br>
However, the compounds represented by general formula (1) according to the present invention are characterized by including a partial chemical structure having piperazine or piperidine at the ortho position of a benzene ring bonded to an aliphatic carbocyclic group such as cyclohexyl, therefore differ in their structures from the aforementioned cell adhesion inhibitors or cell infiltration inhibitors.<br>
[0006]<br>
The known compound comprising a partial chemical structure having piperazine or piperidine at the ortho position of a benzene ring bonded to an aliphatic carbocyclic group such as cyclohexyl, as a chemical structural feature of the compounds represented by general formula (1) according to the present invention, is the compound represented by the following formula:<br><br><br>
(see Patent document 2).<br>
However, the patent application discloses only its use as an anti-obesity agent and diabetes treatment based on the melanocortin receptor agonistic activity of the compound, while it neither discloses nor suggests its use as an anti-inflammatory agent based on inhibitory action of leukocyte adhesion or infiltration.<br>
Other than the above compound, the compound represented by the following formula:<br><br>
is known (see Non-patent document 10. compound number 45).<br>

After completion of the reactions of each of the methods and steps described above, the target compound of each step may be recovered from the reaction mixture according to conventional procedures.<br>
For example, when the entire reaction mixture is a liquid, it may be returned to room temperature if necessary, or cooled on ice, then allowed to neutralization of an acid, an alkali, an oxidizing agent or a reducing agent if<br>

immiscible with water and which does not react with the target compound may be added, and the layer containing the target compound is separated. Next, there may be added a solvent which is immiscible with the resultant layer and which does not react with the target compound, and the layer containing the target compound may be washed and separated. If the layer is an organic layer, it may be dried using a desiccant such as anhydrous magnesium sulfate or anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solvent may be distilled off to recover the target compound. If the layer is an aqueous layer, it may be electrically desalted and then lyophilized to recover the target compound.<br>
When the entire reaction mixture is a liquid, if possible the substances other than the target compound (for example, solvents, reagents, etc.) may be simply distilled off at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure to recover the target compound.<br>
When the target compound alone precipitates as a solid, or when the entire reaction mixture is a liquid and the target compound alone precipitates as a solid during the recovery procedure, the target compound may be first filtered by a filtration method and the filtered target compound washed with a suitable organic<br><br>
or inorganic solvent and dried to allow treatment of the mother liquor in the same manner as when the entire reaction mixture is a liquid, in order to recover the target compound.<br>
When only the reagent or catalyst is present in solid form5 or when the entire reaction mixture is a liquid and the reagent or catalyst alone precipitates as a solid during the recovery procedure, with the target compound dissolved in the solution, the reagent or catalyst may be first filtered by a filtration method and the filtered reagent or catalyst washed with a suitable organic or inorganic solvent, and then the obtained wash liquids combined as the mother liquor and the obtained mixture treated in the same manner as when the entire reaction mixture is a liquid, in order to recover the target compound.<br>

Tnt puniy of :he targei compound reccversa uj the insiiod described above may be improved by appropriately employing a recrystallization method, chroinaiography method or distillation method.<br>
When the recovered target compound is a solid, it will usually be possible to improve the purity of the target compound by recrystallization. For recrystallization, a single solvent or multiple solvents which do not react with the target compound may be used. Specifically, the target compound is first dissolved in the single or multiple solvents which do not react therewith, either at room temperature or with heating. The resulting solution is either cooled on ice or allowed to stand at room temperature to crystallization of the target compound from the mixture.<br>
When the recovered target compound is a liquid or a solid, the purity of the target compound may be improved by any of various chromatography methods. A weak acid silica gel such as Silica Gel 60 (340-400 mesh) by Merck Co. or BW-300 (300 mesh) by Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd. may be used in most cases. When the target compound is basic and adsorption is too strong on the aforementioned silica gels, Propylamine Coating Silica Gel (200-300 mesh) by Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd. or the like may be used.    When the target compound is dipolar or<br><br>
must be eluted with a polar solvent such as methanol, NAM-200H or NAM-300H by Nam Research Co. may be used. These silica gels may be used for elution of the target compound with a single solvent or multiple solvents which do not react with the target compound, followed by distilling off of the solvent, to yield the target compound with improved purity.<br>
When the recovered target compound is a liquid, its purity may be improved by a distillation method. For distillation, the target compound is subjected to reduced pressure at room temperature or with heating to distill off the target compound.<br>
