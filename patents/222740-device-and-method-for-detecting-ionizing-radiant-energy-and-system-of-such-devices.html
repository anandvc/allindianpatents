ENERGY, AND SYSTEM OF SUCH DEVICES"<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to device and method for detecting ionizing radiant energy,<br>
and system of such devices, and more specifically to radiation detectors that use a polymer<br>
dispersed liquid crystal cell.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] This application claims priority from Provisional Patent Application Serial<br>
No. 60/258,720, filed December 29, 2000.<br>
[0003] Present radiation-detection technology is based on the fact that ionizing radiation, as it<br>
passes through matter, creates electrical charges. These electrical charges can be collected by<br>
applying an electrical field to the matter such that an electrical signal is derived. The type of<br>
detector chosen will depend upon the nature of the radiation, e.g. neutral versus charged particles,<br>
and the desired objective, e.g. the timing between events or the energy of a given event. For<br>
example, thalium activated sodium iodide single crystals are suitable for the measurement of low<br>
energy gamma-rays with low energy resolution, although it has poor timing measurement<br>
characteristics. For high energy-resolution measurements, a solid state single-crystal detector<br>
such as pure germanium can be used.<br>
[0004] Currently available single crystal detectors must be kept at low temperatures during<br>
operation, e.g. 77K, which makes the use of cryogenic materials a necessity. Geiger-Muller type<br>
devices work at room temperature, but their applicability is limited. None of these radiation<br>
detectors are sufficiently flexible in size or shape. Film-badge type radiation detectors indicate<br>
exposure integrated over time, without providing any information about the energy of the incident<br>
radiation.<br>
[0005] For these and other reasons, there is a need for a radiation detector that operates at<br>
ambient temperature and can be built simply and economically in a variety of sizes and shapes in<br>
order to accommodate different measuring methodologies.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a device for<br>
detecting ionizing radiant energy comprising a polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) cell,<br>
characterised in that the PDLC cell is non-transparent in the absence of applied electric field;<br>
and in that the device comprises a light source that is optically oriented toward the cell; an<br>
electrical signal generator that is connected to the (PDLC) cell such that an electric field can be<br>
applied to the cell in order to increase the transmissibility of the cell; a light detector optically<br>
aligned with the light source that is capable of capable of generating output; and a processor that<br>
is connected to the electrical signal generator and analyzes the output from the light detector,<br>
wherein the polymer dispersed liquid crystal cell interacts with the ionizing radiant energy such<br>
that the transmissibility of the polymer dispersed liquid crystal cell is transiently changed in<br>
response to variations in the incident ionizing radiant energy.<br>
[0007] According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a system of<br>
devices for detecting ionizing radiation comprising two or more detection assemblies,<br>
characterized in that each detection assembly comprises a device, as described hereinabove.<br>
[0008] According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for<br>
detecting ionizing radiation comprising a polymer dispersed liquid crystal cell, a light source, an<br>
electrical signal generator, a light detector, and a processor, characterised in that the method<br>
comprises the steps of obtaining a polymer dispersed liquid crystal cell that is non-transparent in<br>
the absence of an electric field; optically orienting a light source toward the polymer dispersed<br>
liquid crystal cell; connecting the electrical signal generator to the polymer dispersed liquid<br>
crystal cell and generating an electric field such that the transmissibility of the PDLC cell is<br>
increased; optically aligning a light detector capable of generating output, with the light source;<br>
and attaching the processor to the light detector to analyze the output of the light detector,<br>
wherein the polymer dispersed liquid crystal cell interacts with the ionizing radiation such that<br>
the transmissibility of the polymer dispersed liquid crystal cell is transiently changed by the<br>
interaction with the ionizing radiation and in response to variations in the incident ionizing<br>
radiation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
While making and using various embodiments of the present invention are discussed herein in<br>
terms of polymer dispersed liquid crystal radiation detectors, it should be appreciated that the<br>
present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide<br>
variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of<br>
specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (hereinafter PDLC) films constitute an important class of<br>
materials with applications in electrically switchable optical devices. A PDLC film comprises<br>
sub-micron to micron-sized droplets of liquid-crystalline (lc) material dispersed in an optically<br>
transparent polymer matrix. The optical transmission through a PDLC-based device depends on<br>
several important parameters. These parameters include the local electric field inside each<br>
droplet (which depends upon the dielectric properties of the lc and polymer and charge-<br>
accumulation/dissipation at the lc-polymer interface), molecular director reorientation in each<br>
droplet, and the geometry and reorientation of the droplet itself. The device may also comprise a<br>
distribution of the sizes and shapes of the droplets. In the absence of an electric field and<br>
depending upon a critical radius of spherical droplets, more than one possible configuration of<br>
molecular orientations are possible within a droplet. Additionally, the directors of individual<br>
droplets are randomly oriented. All of this results in strong scattering of light.<br>
[0014] When an electric field is applied, a change may occur in the configurations of the<br>
molecular directors in the droplet, orientation of the droplet's symmetry axis, and alignment of<br>
the director of the droplet. For positive dielectric anisotropy (?e &gt; 0), the molecular director<br>
and the droplet's symmetry axis tend to align along the field and transmission through the film<br>
increases. The composite nature of the PDLC and the dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal<br>
make the effective electric field "seen" by the lc dipoles very different from externally applied<br>
field.<br>
[0015] One example of a PDLC cell in accordance with the present invention contains<br>
liquid crystalline material, E8 in poly (methyl methacrylate) polymer [hereinafter PMMA].<br>
Micron-sized droplets of E8 were dispersed in PMMA polymer matrix by using solvent-<br>
induced phase separation technique. A cell was constructed by sandwiching this composite<br>
material between two ITO-coated glass substrates separated by 20-µm thick insulators. The<br>
average size of the LC droplets (= 1µm) was controlled by the cooling rate of the liquid crystal<br>
from its isotropic phase. The time dependence of the response of the cells was measured by a<br>
standard optical transmission measurement system using a He-Ne laser, a set of polarizers, a<br>
photomultiplier-detector, a square wave electrical pulse generator, and computer-controlled<br>
data collection and analysis software operating at 20 kHz.<br>
[0016] FIGURE 1 depicts the light transmission through the PDLC cell and its response,<br>
following application of square wave pulses. Square wave electrical pulses were applied so as<br>
to produce a constant electric field of 1 MV/m at repetition rates ranging from 0.5 to 20 Hz.<br>
Upon application of a pulse, transmission through the cell rises rapidly to a maximum (almost<br>
sudden increase in transmission occurs whenever | dE/dt | &gt; 0) and then decays via<br>
exponentials during the width of the pulse. The rise in transmission occurs with a rise-time of<br>
the order of 2 to 5 ms and represents rapid alignment of the molecular director within the<br>
droplets. Additionally, a realignment of the director of the droplet along the field may also<br>
contribute. This is a relatively slow process and it is not expected to contribute significantly to<br>
the rapid switch-on of the cell. The applied electric field should also generate charges in the<br>
polymer matrix. The diffusion of these charges through the composite material of the PDLC<br>
leading to charge accumulation at the droplet-polymer interface, may add to the time<br>
dependence of the cell response.<br>
[0017] Additionally, from the electrical point of view, a certain time constant can be<br>
assigned to the PDLC cell, which can be viewed as a circuit element with a complex<br>
impedance, Zd = Zel + Zp. Here Zel is the electrode impedance containing electrical response<br>
at the interface between the PDLC film and the electrodes and Zp is the impedance in the bulk<br>
of the PDLC film. Zel represents charge transfer at the droplet/polymer interface, interfacial<br>
capacitance resulting from ion buildup at the electrodes, and ITO resistance. The impedance<br>
Zp results from the two-phase structure of the PDLC film. The theoretical model (discussed<br>
below) predicts exponential decay with the same decay time within and outside the applied<br>
pulse. Measurements in accordance with the present invention, however, show that a single<br>
exponential cannot describe the cell response and the decay times of the cell response, within<br>
and outside the applied pulse, are not the same. Furthermore, the present invention provides a<br>
new feature in the cell response; a delayed component.<br>
[0018] After the initial rise and while decaying rapidly during the pulse, the cell response<br>
exhibits an increase in transmission followed by resumption of the exponential decay during<br>
the remaining width of the applied pulse. Similar behavior is observed even outside the width<br>
of the applied pulse, albeit, with significantly different decay times. The cell response can be<br>
decomposed into two components that provide a better understanding of the result. The early<br>
part of the cell response is well represented by an exponential and a constant background. The<br>
results of this fit are then subtracted from the total response and the difference curve is labeled<br>
as the delayed component. The cell responses, for both within and outside the width of the<br>
applied pulse, can be analyzed by following this procedure.<br>
[0019] The measured cell response is much more complex than a single exponential decay.<br>
Following a rapid rise, the cell response decays exponentially with a decay time, tdecay1off =<br>
(30±2) ms. Simultaneously, the delayed component builds up with a rise time, troff = (24±1)<br>
ms. Having reached a maximum at t = tdelay2 the delayed component decays with a decay<br>
time, tdecay2off = (40±2) ms. In the case of the 5 Hz data, tdelayl ~ 10 ms and tdelay2 ~ 50<br>
ms. Similar results are obtained for electric fields applied at repetition rates of 0.5, 1, and 10<br>
Hz. Since the decay times are different within and outside the width of the applied field, the<br>
relaxation mechanisms operational within these time periods are influenced by the field and<br>
they may be different. The result, tdelay2 &gt; tdelay, is consistent with the fact that during<br>
tdelay1 there is an externally applied electric field, whereas there is no such field during<br>
tdelay2. Of course, there is still a residual field due to the interfacial charges.<br>
[0020] As far as the physical process responsible for the delayed component is concerned,<br>
there are two possible effects. These are: 1) realignment of the director of the non-spherical<br>
droplets and 2) change in the electric field |dE/dt| due to accumulation of sufficient charges at<br>
the droplet/polymer interface. The values of the time-delays, tdelay1 ~10 ms within the width<br>
of the applied pulse and tdelay2 ~50 ms outside the width of the applied pulse, are two<br>
important parameters. The time-delay represents an average time needed for either the<br>
reorientation of the symmetry axis of non-spherical droplets along the applied field or buildup<br>
of sufficient charges at the lc-polymer interface. The latter involves several different<br>
processes, ie, generation of charges in the polymer matrix, diffusion of these charges under the<br>
influence of the applied field, and their equilibrium arrangement at the lc-polymer interface.<br>
An interplay between the decay rate t and delay time tdelay sets a limit on the repetition rate<br>
of the applied electric field pulse (= tdelay -1) above which the delayed component is not<br>
expected to be observed. In the case of the E8-PDLC, the upper limit on the repetition rate<br>
turns out to be 100 Hz. No delayed component if observed for repetition rates higher than 20<br>
Hz.<br>
[0021] Several processes contribute to the cell response; dielectric properties of the lc<br>
droplets, charge accumulation/dissipation at the lc-polymer interface, reorientation and<br>
dynamics of non-spherical droplets, etc. The dielectric response of a film consisting of<br>
spheroidal inclusions of type 1 material (liquid crystal droplets) randomly distributed in a<br>
matrix of type 2 material (polymer) has been modeled by<br><br>
where v1 is the volume fraction of type 1 material, and e1 and e2 are the dielectric<br>
constants of the isotropic phases of the two materials in the film. The dielectric constants are<br>
assumed to be complex to account for the dissipative mechanisms.<br>
[0022] The main points of the theoretical model that are relevant are as follows. At low<br>
frequencies of the applied field and when the conductivity of the lc is much greater than the<br>
conductivity of the polymer (which is appropriate to the E8-PMMA PDLC), there can be<br>
significant accumulation of charges at the lc-polymer interface. Thus the field "seen" by a<br>
droplet can be significantly different from the applied field due to the shielding effects. At<br>
higher frequencies there is hardly any charge accumulation at the lc-polymer interface. The<br>
PDLC conductivity is then governed by the liquid crystal conductivity. For a square voltage<br>
pulse of amplitude V0 and duration t0, applied at t=0, this model provides the following<br>
equations for the field inside a droplet (Ein),<br><br>
where E0 and E are electric fields at low and high frequencies, respectively.<br>
Whereas, the model predicts one decay rate for both 0 
the response for the E8-PDLC cell is much more complex than a single exponential decay.<br>
[0023] Theoretical considerations of additional processes may provide more realistic<br>
description of the measurements. For example, eq (2) is derived by assuming that the lc<br>
droplets are spherical in shape. The PDLC probably contains a distribution of sizes and shapes<br>
of the lc droplets. This is supported by the scanning electron micrographs of the E8-PMMA<br>
PDLC. This feature alone adds to complexity; the response of relatively small and highly<br>
anisotropic droplets to applied fields could be very different from the response of large and<br>
spherical droplets. With a distribution of sizes and shapes of lc droplets, it is reasonable to<br>
expect that more than one relaxation-mechanism is operational in the cell. Furthermore, the<br>
dynamics of the interfacial charges, both during and after the applied pulse, will have to be<br>
taken into consideration. For an elongated droplet of semi-major and semi-minor axes a and b,<br>
respectively, the relaxation times are given by,<br><br>
where ?1 is the rotational viscosity, As is the dielectric anisotropy, E is the electric<br>
field, K is an effective deformation constant, 1 = a/b is the aspect ratio for the droplet, and ?1<br>
and ?2 are two angles such that when the electric field is removed, the droplet director returns<br>
from an angle ?1 to ?2. These equations clearly show the effect of the non-spherical shape of<br>
the droplet on the relaxation times involved. It is interesting to note that for reasonable values<br>
of the parameters and slightly elongated droplets (aspect ratio, 1= 1.1), these equations provide<br>
values of the relaxation times that are in good agreement with our measurements of ton ~ 25<br>
ms and tdelay2 ~ 50 ms.<br>
[0024] It is expected that the accumulation/dissipation of charges at the lc-polymer<br>
interface depend largely on the polymer matrix in a PDLC cell. It is possible to intentionally<br>
generate additional charges in the polymer matrix and observe their influence on the response<br>
of a PDLC cell constructed with NF-100 lc material. For this purpose, the cell is irradiated<br>
with gamma rays using ~ 5 µCi 207Bi radioactive source. This radioisotope produces gamma<br>
rays of energies 0.57 and 1.06 MeV. The absorption of the gamma rays in the polymer of the<br>
PDLC cell, albeit relatively small, produces additional charges. The cell response has been<br>
measured as a function of time prior to, and following gamma irradiation.<br>
[0025] A characteristic shape parameter (R) of the cell response as a function of irradiation<br>
time is shown in FIGURE 3. Prior to irradiation, R remains time-independent within the<br>
statistical uncertainties of the measurements. After irradiation for a period of an hour, we<br>
observe a significant reduction in R. This decrease is attributed to the generation of additional<br>
charges in the PDLC. Diffusion of these additional charges, leading to their accumulation at<br>
the lc-polymer interface, reduces the effective electric field experienced by the molecular<br>
dipoles. This results in a reduction of transmission through the cell and a lower value of R.<br>
Thereafter R remains at this lower value during further irradiation for about 4 hrs. After<br>
irradiation for a total of 5 hrs, the radioactive source was removed and the cell response was<br>
measured after a "cooling-off" period of 1 hr. The resulting value of R (at time = 8 hrs) has<br>
returned close to its pre-irradiation level. The measurements of R made for additional 3 hrs<br>
without irradiation remain constant at this high value. The latter is close to the value of R<br>
measured prior to irradiation. Whereas the drop in R (at time = 3 hrs) results from additional<br>
charges at the lc-polymer interface, the rise in R at time = 8 hrs is due to dissipation of these<br>
charges under the influence of the applied field. The data demonstrate the influence of<br>
additional charges on light transmission (hence on the local electric field "seen" by molecular<br>
dipoles) in a PDLC cell. The magnitude of the effect should depend on the charges produced<br>
in the polymer matrix, diffusion of charges through the matrix, and their equilibrium<br>
accumulation at and dissipation from the interface.<br>
[0026] The present invention makes use of PDLC films synthesized from two different<br>
different polymers, namely, poly (methyl methacrylate (PMMA) and poly (vinyl chloride;<br>
vinyl acetate-17%) (PVA:VAC-17), obtained from M/s Polysciences Inc., USA and liquid<br>
crystal mixture, E-8 from M/s B.D.H. England. The polymers PMMA and PVC:VAC-17 have<br>
the refractive index, np =1.49 and 1.52 respectively at room temperature (23°C), which is<br>
very close the refractive index, no, of the liquid crystal mixture, E-8 (no = 1.52 at 23°C). Each<br>
polymer has low solubility of the liquid crystal mixture. The PDLC films were prepared using<br>
the solvent induced phase separation technique. Appropriate quantities of the liquid crystal<br>
mixture and of the polymer were dissolved in a common solvent (chloroform/acetone) in<br>
various weight proportions. The homogeneous solution of each concentration was spread in<br>
the form of a film in a suitable cast. On solvent evaporation a strongly scattering white film<br>
was obtained. The thickness of the prepared film was measured by a Surfometer SF-200 (M/s<br>
Planer industrial, UK). Films of various thicknesses ranging from 10-50 µ m were prepared.<br>
The PDLC film was peeled-off from the substrate and was sandwiched between two<br>
transparent conducting glass plates under simultaneous application of heat and pressure.<br>
[0027] The scattering and electro-optic characteristics of the PDLC films depended<br>
strongly on the thermal history of the films. The electro-opic transmission properties were<br>
measured by a simple set-up in a normal transmission geometry using a He-Ne laser light<br>
source (A = 632.8 nm) along with a RCA-931A photomultiplier tube. The temperature of the<br>
cell was controlled by a water circulator (Julabo HC-40, W. Germany) to an accuracy of<br>
±0.1°C. The refractive index measurements were carried out using an Abbe refractometer. It<br>
was ensured that the polymer films were completely solvent-free before making the refractive<br>
index measurements.<br>
[0028] FIGURE 4 shows one form of the present invention. The PDLC 100 is shown<br>
between two windows 102 and together they form a PDLC cell 103. The only limitation on the<br>
window material is that it be substantially transparent to the wavelength of the light source 110<br>
(vide infra). An electrical signal generator 104 is connected to the cell 103 to provide a<br>
constant electrical field to the cell 103. The waveform generated by the electrical signal<br>
generator can be any alternating current waveform, with nonlimiting examples being square<br>
and sinusoidal waves. The cell 103 is housed in a light-tight box 106 that is fitted with an<br>
aperture 108. Also contained within the light-tight box 106 are a light source 110 and a light<br>
detector 112. The light source 110 and light detector 112 can be any of variety of specific<br>
components that are known to those of skill in the art. Nonlimiting examples of light sources<br>
110 include both broadband and monochromatic lamps and lasers. Similarly, the light detector<br>
112 can be chosen for the specific application that is envisioned. It can be a silicon photo<br>
detector, an array detector or a photomultiplier tube. The light source 110 is oriented so that it<br>
points to the cell 103 from one side while the light detector 112 is positioned on the opposite<br>
side. The application of the signal from the electrical signal generator orients the liquid crystal<br>
to produce a base level of transmission of light from the light source 110 to the light detector<br>
112.<br>
[0029] Incident photons 114 of ionizing radiation can then impinge on the cell. The<br>
photons generate charges locally in the PDLC and thus alter the electrical field that is seen by<br>
the liquid crystals dispersed near the site where the charge is created. This change in the<br>
electrical field is reflected in a change in the orientation of the liquid crystals and/ or the<br>
droplets and thus the amount of light that is transmitted through the cell form the light source<br>
to the light detector changes. It is the measurement of this change through the parameter R that<br>
constitutes the detection of the incident photon.<br>
[0030] While specific alternatives to steps of the invention have been described herein,<br>
additional alternatives not specifically disclosed but known in the art are intended to fall within<br>
the scope of the invention. Thus, it is understood that other applications of the present<br>
invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the described embodiment<br>
and after consideration of the appended claims and drawing.<br>
