				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device for manipulating helicopters for the purpose of securing them after landing and towing them into the hangar. More precisely the device employs a hydraulic linkage mechanism for approaching the helicopter when landed anywhere within the circular grid area.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A relevant prior patent US 4, 529, 152 relates to devices for maneuvering helicopters on the deck of a ship. According to the invention, the helicopter, whose landing gear comprises at least one swiveling wheel, is maneuvered between a take-off and landing area and a garage area on the deck of a ship with the aid of a guide carriage, moving in a guide rail and connected to a fitting on the helicopter by a telescopic rod or a cable, as well as a guide bar engaged by a roller on a rail and hooked by a fork joint on the axle of the swiveling wheels of the helicopter. When the helicopter is displaced towards the garage area by traction on a towing cable hooked at the front of the helicopter on the rear of which is hooked a retaining cable maintained tensioned, the helicopter automatically and progressively aligns itself on the axis of the rail due to the guide bar.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a device for manipulating helicopters into the hangar after landing on the ship deck. The manipulator"s arm is constructed to reach the helicopter"s front wheel when the helicopter lands on any point of the circular landing grid with an angular offset of (+/-) 30° about the grid hole axis.<br><br>
The device comprises a carriage assembly, a link, a crossbar assembly and a telescopic arm assembly. The carriage assembly comprises of a swivel mechanism that employs sliding plates with grease pockets for avoiding the use of bearings. The swivel mechanism is operated with the help of a hydraulic motor drive that transmits power through plurality of gears. The telescopic arm assembly is mounted on the cross bar plate by means of clamps. The arm is a three stage telescopic arrangement, which can be extended. The arm also consists of a steering mechanism for steering the helicopter"s rear wheel.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a device for the manipulation of helicopters landing on the ship for the purpose of securing and towing into the hangar. The manipulator"s arm is constructed to reach the helicopter"s front wheel when the helicopter lands on any point of the circular landing grid with an angular offset of (+/-) 30° about the grid hole axis.<br>
Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings illustrates the main components of the helicopter traversing manipulator. The manipulator comprises a carriage assembly (1), a link (2), a crossbar assembly (3) and a telescopic arm assembly (4). The carriage assembly moves on rails laid above the ship deck by means of guided rollers (5). The carriage is driven by any drive mechanism known in the art, preferably a winch drive.<br>
According to figure 2 and 3, the carriage assembly (1) has a swivel mechanism (6), which is operated by means of a hydraulic motor (7) that transmits power through a gear mechanism (8). The swivel mechanism (6) employs sliding plates (9) containing grease pockets in order to avoid the use of bearings which is considered cumbersome under sea conditions. The said sliding plate arrangement consists of a circular plate with grease pockets that acts as a mode of lubrication between two mating components. The advantages of the sliding plate apart from replacing bearings, is that they are very effective and simple for assembly and maintenance when compared to conventional bearings. Sliding plates with grease plates are easy to manufacture and prove to be cost effective.<br>
The carriage assembly (1) of the manipulator is connected to the arm assembly (4) by means of a link (2). Figure 3 &amp;4 illustrates the link assembly, which connects the carriage assembly (1) to the arm assembly (4). The link (2) acts as a cantilever support<br><br>
and provides flexibility by means of two rotating joints (10). Figure 3 illustrates the feature wherein the link is supported by guy ropes (11) attached to the guy support plates (12) of the carriage assembly (1) said link provided to rotate freely. The length of the link (2) and rotation angle is specified to cover the complete area of the grid. The link (2) comprises of a linear motion guide (LM Guide) (14) preferably in the form of a sector, which supports the arm assembly (4) thereby bearing the load of the overhanging arm assembly (4).<br>
Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the cross bar assembly of the traversing mechanism. The cross bar assembly (3) of the manipulator consists of a cross bar (15) which is mounted on a crossbar mounting plate (16). The cross bar mounting plate (16) is pivoted at one end with the rotating joint of the link and the other end is supported by the LM guide thus guiding the cross bar assembly (3) to swivel about an angle of (+/-) 60°. The cross bar (15) consists of two hydraulic hooks (17), which help to secure the front wheels of the helicopter at the front wheel clamp point (18). A cylinder at the center of the cross bar (15) is used to clamp down the helicopter at the clamp down point (18). The cross bar (15) also consists of guy rope pulleys (19) provided with guy ropes (20) that are used to support the underlying telescopic arm assembly (4).<br>
Figure 7 exemplifies the telescopic arm assembly according to the invention. The telescopic arm assembly (4) is located beneath the cross bar assembly (3). The telescopic arm (TA) approaches the rear wheel of the helicopter for the purpose of steering. It is attached to the cross bar mounting plate (16) by means of clamps. The arm (TA) is a three stage telescopic arrangement (21, 22, 23), which can extend up to different lengths. The telescopic arm (TA) consists of a steering mechanism (24) to steer the helicopter"s rear wheel and is supported by guy ropes (25). The guy ropes also serve as necessary mechanism for retraction of the extended cylinders. The steering mechanism is used to control the movement of the helicopter by steering the<br><br>
rear wheel. The mechanism is fed with pre-determined inputs in the form of steering angle. The mechanism comprises of a torque with a yoke like structure to guide the rear wheel of the helicopter.<br><br><br>
We claim<br>
1. A device for the manipulation of helicopters anywhere within the grid area and towing them to a hangar, comprising a carriage assembly (1) provided to move on guided rollers, the said device comprises a link assembly (2) provided to connect the carriage assembly to the arm assembly, a cross bar assembly (3) with two hydraulic hooks adapted to secure the front wheels of the helicopter and a telescopic arm assembly (4) equipped with a steering mechanism; characterized in that said manipulator device is operated with a hydraulic linkage mechanism comprising of a sliding plate with grease pockets (9), an extendable three stage telescopic arm arrangement (21, 22, 23) supported by guy ropes (25) and comprising a steering mechanism (24) to steer the helicopter"s rear wheel.<br>
