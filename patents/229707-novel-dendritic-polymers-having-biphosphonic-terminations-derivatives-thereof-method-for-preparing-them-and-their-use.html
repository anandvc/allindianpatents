NOVEL DENDRITIC POLYMERS HAVING BIPHOSPHONIC TERMINATIONS DERIVATIVES THEREOF, METHOD FOR PREPARING THEM AND THEIR<br>
USE<br>
Dendritic polymers are macromolecules composed of monomers which combine according to a branching process around a central multifunctional core.<br>
Dendritic polymers, also called "cascade molecules", are highly branched functional polymers of defined structure. Those macromolecules are, in fact polymers because they are based oh the combinatipn of repeating units However, dendritic polymers are fundamehtally different from convehtiohal polymers in that they have their own properties due to their branched structure. The molecular weight and the form of dendritic polymers can be controlled precisely, and all the functions are situated at the ends of the branches forming a surface,  which renders them readily accessible.<br>
Dehdritic polyrhers are constructed step by step by the repetition of a reaction sequence, allowing each repeating unit and the terminal functions to be multiplied. Each reaction sequence forms a so-called "new generation". The arborescent structure is obtained by the repetition of a reaction sequenpe, which allows a new generation and an increasing number of identical branches to be obtained at the end of each reaction cycle. After several generations, the dendritic polymer generally assumes a globular form which is highly branched and multifunctionalised by virtue Of the large number of terminal fuhctions present at the periphery.<br>
Such polymers have been described especially by Launay et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 1994, 33, 15/16, 1589-1592, or by Launay ef al., Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 1997, 529,51-58.<br>
The treatment of surfaces, for example in prder to protect them, invplve$ thephenomenon of adhesjonv Which often requires the presence ofhydrogen bond dPnor and acceptor groups on the surface and/or the protecting agent. It is<br><br>
therefore desirable to provide agents that have a high hydrog0h-b:ond capacity as surface-treatment agents.<br><br>
Dendritic polymers having various phosphorus-containing functions (phosphine, phosphinate, phosphate, phosphonate, phosphorane, spirophosphorane) have been described especially in the articles mentioned above or in French patent application FR 95 CB251.<br>
However, no dendritic polymer having free biphosphonic acid terminations, or optionally terminations in the form of corresponding salts or esters, has been<br>
*<br>
described. In fact, it has hitherto been impossible to prepare such functionalities on dendritic polymers. More precisely, it was impossible to prepare dendritic polymers exhibiting a biphosphpnic acid fuhction. This has now been made possible starting from the corresponding methyl ester.<br>
The inventors have now found a reaction that allows that type of terrnihal functionality of the diester or biphosphphic acid type to be obtained on dendritic polymers.<br><br><br>
