				<td>The present invention relates to a mirror arrangement for a rear view mirror system<br>
in an article of headgear, especially for a rear view mirror system in a cycling or<br>
motorcycling helmet, although not exclusively limited thereto.<br>
Rear view mirror system for cycling and motorcycling helmets are known, such<br>
as the helmet shown in PCX GB94/00485 which relates to a helmet having a solid<br>
block of light transmissive material with reflective surfaces arranged within a channel<br>
in the foam padding of a helmet. FR2631789 discloses a helmet with an open, hollow<br>
channel through the helmet over the wearer's head. The helmet has two mirrors on<br>
the upper side of the channel and one mirror on the lower side of the channel. The<br>
mirrors direct light from behind the wearer to the wearer's eyes. EP0007432 discloses<br>
a helmet including a series of convex lenses and an optical fibre in the helmet to<br>
enable the wearer to see behind themselves. Three of the lenses are arranged radially<br>
to the wearer's head. The channel through the helmet is hollow and open to the air. A<br>
further helmet is known from PCTGB96/02349 where a plurality of mirrors are<br>
arranged on a one piece mounting which is arranged in a channel in the foam padding<br>
inside the outer shell of the helmet. The mirror arrangement disclosed in<br>
PCT GB96/02349 comprises a first concave parabolic mirror, a second flat mirror and<br>
a third convex parabolic mirror.<br>
The region of distinct vision of the retina of the human eye occupies approximately<br>
6° in terms of plane angles. In other words, without moving the eye, only objects<br>
lying in a cone of vertex angle 6° can be distinguished clearly. It is an object of the<br><br>
present invention to provide an improved mirror arrangement for a rear view mirror<br>
system in an article of headgear.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a mirror arrangement for a rear view<br>
mirror system in an article of headgear comprising first, second and third minors, the<br>
first mirror comprising a concave parabolic mirror arranged, in use, adjacent the eves<br>
of the user the first mirror having a principal axis and an effective local length f1, the<br>
second mirror being substantially flat and being arranged between the first and the<br>
third mirrors, the third mirror comprising a convex parabolic mirror having a principal<br>
axis and an effective focal length, f3 characterised in that the first mirror is a concave<br>
off axis parabolic mirror, the third mirror is a convex off axis parabolic mirror and the<br>
mirrors are arranged such that the first and third mirrors have a common focus and the<br>
parabolas are related such that 1.5f1? f3 ? 3f1.<br>
In that way, the mirror arrangement of the invention allows an expanded field of<br>
view to be viewed in a contact mirror arrangement which can be located in a channel<br>
in the foam padding of the helmet without compromising the protective function<br>
thereof. The claimed range of parabola geometry provides a range of field of view<br>
from 9 to 18°.<br>
Preferably, f3 = 2f1<br>
Fn that way. the mirror arrangement in the helmet doubles the field of vision, in<br>
other words, the field of vision is approximately 12°. That enables a 2 metre high<br>
object to be viewed in full at a distance of 10 metres behind the user.<br><br>
The second flat minor is preferably arranged closer to the first mirror than the<br>
third minor. That arrangement is to allow the size of the second mirror to be reduced<br>
and to incrcase the angle of light approach O at the third mirror.<br>
The first mirror is preferably arranged, in use. so that it can be viewed by both eyes<br>
of the user.<br>
The mirrors are preferabh arranged in a channel in the foam padding of a helmet.<br>
The minors are preferably all arranged across the top of the channel facing into the<br>
channel.<br>
The mirrors may be formed as part of a one piece mounting. The one piece<br>
mounting may be arranged in the aforesaid channel. Preferably the one piece<br>
mounting comprises a mating formation on an edge thereof and the article of headgear<br>
includes a channel, the article of headgear having a co-operating mating formation<br>
formed along an edge of the channel, the mating formation co-operating so as to retain<br>
the mirror arrangement on the article of headgear.<br>
According lo a preferred embodiment of the invention there is provided a<br>
mounting arrangement for a rear view mirror system, the mounting arrangement<br>
comprising an article of headgear having a channel formed therein and a mirror<br>
assembly mounted on the article of headgear so as to bridge the channel, the mirror<br>
assembly having a mating formation formed along an edge thereof, the article of<br>
headgear having a co-operating mating formation formed<br><br>
along an edge of the channel, the mating formations co-operating so as to retain the<br>
mirror assembly of the article of headgear.<br>
That provides a convenient way of assembling the mirror assembly into the article of<br>
headgear.<br>
Preferably, the mirror assembly has respective mating formations formed along<br>
opposite edges thereof and the article of headgear has respective co-operating mating<br>
formations formed along opposite edges of the channel. The mating formation on the<br>
mirror assembly or article of headgear may comprise at least one protrusion and the<br>
mating formation on the other of the mirror assembly and article of headgear may<br>
comprise at least one recess, the or each protrusion fitting within the respective recess<br>
with an interference fit. In a preferred embodiment the protrusion is provided on the<br>
mirror assembly and the recess is provided on the edge of the channel in the article of<br>
headgear.<br>
Preferably, the protrusion comprises a lug having a neck and a head, the head being<br>
larger than the neck, the recess being substantially the negative of the protrusion. The<br>
lug may be formed with a curve between the neck and the head.<br>
In that way impact or stress to the article of headgear is dissipated through the mirror<br>
assembly via the curved lugs into the body of the article of headgear. The curved lugs<br>
reduce stress concentrations and thus reduce the risk of the mirror assembly breaking<br>
under stresses applied to the article of headgear. In the case of a helmet, impacts may<br><br>
be severe and the configuration of the mounting renders the mirror assembly safer than<br>
previous such systems.<br>
Preferably, a plurality of protrusions and a corresponding plurality of recesses are<br>
provided. Most preferably a plurality of curved lug protrusions and respective mating<br>
recesses are provided.<br>
An embodiment of the invention will now be described in detail by way of example and<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic side elevation of a mirror arrangement in accordance with the<br>
invention.<br>
Fig 2 is a plan view of a cycle helmet incorporating a mirror arrangement and mounting<br>
arrangement in accordance with the invention, and<br>
Fig. 3 is a cross section taken on line III-III in Fig. 2.<br>
A mirror arrangement 10 in accordance with the invention is arranged within an article<br>
of headgear 12, such as a motorcycle helmet. The mirror arrangement 10 comprises a<br>
first mirror 14, a second mirror 16 and a third mirror 18.<br><br>
The mirror arrangement 10 is located in a channel 20 formed in foam padding 22 of the<br>
helmet 12, the channel extending across the top of the head of the wearer, in use, from<br>
adjacent the forehead of the user to adjacent the crown of the head of the user. The<br>
mirrors 14, 16, 18 are located on a mounting (not shown) which extends across the top<br>
of the channel 20 whereby all the mirrors face into the channel towards the floor of the<br>
channel.<br>
The first mirror 14 comprises a concave off axis parabolic mirror. The mirror 14 is<br>
arranged in such a position that the wearer can view the mirror 14 with both eyes when<br>
wearing the article of headgear 12. Accordingly, the mirror 14 is wide enough to be<br>
viewed by both eyes and has a length of 10 to 20 mm, most preferably 16 mm.<br>
The second mirror 16 is substantially flat and is located close to the first mirror. That<br>
enables the size of that mirror to be reduced which reduces the size of the front part of<br>
the mirror arrangement. Also, the provision of a substantially flat mirror redirects the<br>
incoming light rays so that the angle of light approach 0 at the third mirror can be<br>
increased which improves the image quality. Also, the provision of the substantially<br>
flat mirror 16 reflects the light rays substantially downwardly into the first mirror as<br>
shown in Figure 1 which reduces the amount that the first mirror must be spaced from<br>
the head of the user in order to reflect light rays into the eye of user. Also, the<br>
provision of an odd number of mirrors is required in order to provide an image which<br>
appears the correct way round. An even number of mirrors would provide an image<br>
which was reversed.<br><br>
The third mirror 18 is a convex off axis parabolic mirror. The third mirror 18 is larger<br>
than the first and second mirrors and is arranged at the rear of the article of headgear<br>
above the crown of the head of the user.<br>
The first mirror 14 has an effective axis 14a and the third mirror 18 has an effective<br>
axis 18a. A line parallel to 18a is indicated in Figure 1 for the purposes of illustration.<br>
The angle between the axes 14a and 18a is shown as. That angle is, in the case of<br>
Figure 1, approximately 16a. The curved mirrors 14, 18 have a common effective focal<br>
point R shown in Figure 1. That focal point R is spaced along the principal axis of the<br>
first mirror 14 as shown at 14b in Figure 1. The positioning of the first and third<br>
mirrors and the geometry' of the parabolas is determined according to the following<br>
equation<br>
1.5 fl <f3></f3>
where fl is the effective focal length of the first mirror 14 and f3 is the effective focal<br>
length of the third mirror 18.<br>
The orientation and location of the mirrors is determined by the geometry thereof. In<br>
particular, the geometry of the mirrors 14, 18 alters the position of the common focal<br>
point which, in turn, alters the change in the field of view that the mirror arrangement<br>
10 in accordance with the present invention provides.<br><br>
As mentioned previously, the human eye can distinguish clearly a vertex angle of 6a.<br>
Accordingly, light entering the eye from the first mirror 14 is only viewed clearly across<br>
an angle of 6a at the retina. Thus, in order to provide an effective rear view mirror<br>
arrangement, it is necessary to alter the field of view. The arrangement set out above<br>
increases the field of view to between 9a and 18a. In the particular arrangement set out<br>
in Figure 1. it is intended that the field of view be 12a. In other words, f3 = 2fl.<br>
Thus the geometry of the two parabolas is related. In the embodiment shown the<br>
common focal point R is spaced from the first mirror twice as far as it is spaced from<br>
the third mirror.<br>
Obviously, selecting an alternative relationship between first and third mirrors within<br>
the aforesaid range will provide a different field of view. A field of view of 6a, i.e.<br>
where plane mirrors are used, is not sufficient for a rear view mirror system in a helmet.<br>
In the present embodiment where the arrangement is intended to be used as a rear view<br>
mirror system for a motorcycle helmet, it is important that the wearer can see the<br>
vehicles behind him at a sufficiently short distance without having to move his head<br>
around. A field of view of 6a as provided by plane mirrors, is not sufficient since a 2<br>
metre high object can only be viewed completely when at least 30 metres behind a<br>
motorcycle rider, presuming the rider is approximately 1.5 metres tall when seated on<br>
his motorcycle. Increasing the field of view reduces the distance at which objects of<br>
that size can be viewed without moving the head. The only alternative is to provide a<br><br>
larger mirror arrangement which would compromise the integrity of the helmet. The<br>
present arrangement provides the advantage of a wide field of view in a compact mirror<br>
arrangement which does not compromise the primary function of the helmet, namely to<br>
protect the wearer.<br>
In figure 2 a cycle helmet 12 incorporates the mirror arrangement 10 of figure 1. Cycle<br>
helmet 12 includes a channel 20 formed in the padding of the helmet across the top of<br>
the helmet from the front to the back thereof. The mirror arrangement 10 comprises<br>
mirrors 14, 16. 18 as described above located on a mounting 24. The mounting 24 is<br>
elongate and includes four lug-like projections 26 spaced along each longitudinal edge<br>
thereof.<br>
The padding 22 of the helmet 12 has four recesses 28 formed spaced apart along each<br>
edge of the channel 20. The recesses 28 are substantially the negative of the protrusions<br>
26 on the mounting 24 so that the protrusions 26 are received within the recesses 28<br>
with an interference fit. The lugs and recesses are similar to the lugs and recesses found<br>
on a jigsaw puzzle. Each lug 26 has a neck and an enlarged head, the neck curving<br>
outwardly into the head and the recesses 28 are formed in similar fashion.<br>
In order to assemble the mounting 24 on to the helmet 12 the mounting is located across<br>
the top of the channel with the mirrors 14, 16, 18 facing into the channel. The lugs 26<br>
are then pressed into the respective recesses 28 until they are properly received with an<br>
interference fit. Because of the narrowed neck and enlarged head of each lug 26, the<br><br>
lugs cannot be pulled out from the recesses 28 easily. The shell of the helmet is then<br>
located over the whole assembly so as to retain the mounting 24 in the channel 20. In<br>
the event of an impact on the helmet the shell initially serves to dissipate some of force<br>
but forces transmitted into the padding and, consequently, into the mounting 24.<br>
However, due to the curved design of the mounting lugs 26 and recesses 28 the stress is<br>
dissipated from the mounting into the padding 22 of the helmet without stress<br>
concentration. The curved design of the mounting lugs increases the wear resistance of<br>
the mirror arrangement and allows for secure and safe mounting of the mirror<br>
arrangement within the helmet 12.<br><br>
