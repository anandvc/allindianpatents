Description<br>
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DIAGNOSING<br>
CABLECARD-RELATED STATUS AND PERFORMING<br>
PROPER PROCESSING, OPENCABLE HOST, AND OPENCABLE RECEPTION APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	Apparatuses and methods consistent with the present invention relate to diagnosing<br>
a CableCARD-related status and performing proper processing according to the diagnosis result in an OpenCable system, an OpenCable host, and an OpenCable reception apparatus.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	As many broadcast systems become digital, the use of digital broadcast contents<br>
increases. Accordingly, the importance of copy-protection technologies and subscriber authentication for protecting digital broadcast contents which are produced by investing enormous amounts of funds and human resources, is also increasing. If an embedded CAS (Conditional Access System) is hacked, no method exists to protect a provider from the hacking. However, if a CableCARD is used, it is possible to protect a provider from such hacking without much difficulty and at low cost by changing the CableCARD to a new one.<br>
[3]	Under this environment, the United States has adopted an OpenCable standard by<br>
CableLabs as a next-generation digital cable broadcast standard to be used after 2005. Recently, Korea has adopted the OpenCable standard as a domestic digital cable broadcast transmission/reception matching standard. The OpenCable standard is based on MPEG-2, which is an image standard, and Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS), which is a cable modem transmission standard.<br>
[4]	The OpenCable standard is divided into a hardware part and a software part The<br>
hardware part of the OpenCable standard is composed of a set-top box and a Point Of Deployment (POD) device that provides security and reception functions and is separated from the set-top box. The separation of the POD device from the set-top box is aimed at establishing a competitive system for producing and supplying set-top boxes that is not restricted by solutions supplied by specific companies, and as a result, leads to commercialization and cost reduction of set-top boxes.<br>
[S]	The software part of the OpenCable standard is middleware based on an<br>
OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP) standard. The OCAP standard is a standard for interactive services in cable broadcast. The OCAP standard can provide web-based services to a cable broadcast, so as to support enhanced bi-directional services to<br><br>

WO 2006/016760	PCT/KR2005/002567<br>
viewers.<br>
[6]	FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a conventional OpenCable system.<br>
[7]	Referring to FIG. 1, the conventional OpenCable system includes a network 110, a<br>
headend 120, a host 130, and a CableCARD 140.<br>
[8]	The headend 120 is a signal source for all signals delivered to downstream systems<br>
and may be a sky-wave broadcast station, a satellite service, a local microwave relay, etc. The headend 120 and host 130 perform A/V, Out-Of-Band (OOB), and DOCSIS bi-directional communications with each other via a Hybrid Fiber Coaxial (HFC) network. The host 130 may be a set-top box or a television, and includes electronic devices for transferring broadcast signals from a source to a subscriber and converting the broadcast signals into other formats. The host 130 and the CableCARD 140 perform successive data transmissions and basic protocol communications through data/address line communication. The CableCARD 140 additionally has a de-scrambling function for Audio/Video (A/V) streams and scrambled streams and a copy-protection function for contents protection. Also, along with providing the interactive services, the CableCARD can also function as a communication device so that it can support communications through a CableCARD modem and a DOCSIS modem. Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[9]	As such, in the OpenCable system, since a CableCARD is indispensable, there may<br>
be cases when no service is provided due to CableCARD-related problems. In these cases, users cannot actually obtain any information about such problems, but must know what the problems are or why no service is received. However, it is difficult for even a service provider to find the cause of the service or communication interruption. Also, many inconveniences arise, such as the time consumed when finding the cause of such problems, during which the user cannot utilize any services.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[ 10]	The present invention provides an apparatus and method for diagnosing a<br>
CableCARD-related status and performing proper processing according to the diagnosis result in an OpenCable system, thereby initially entering a normal operation mode and allowing a user to perform proper controls through informing him/her of the generation of a critical error, service interruptions, or network-related diagnosis results. A OpenCable host and an OpenCable reception apparatus consistent with the present<br>
invention are also provided.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[11]	According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, by installing a<br><br>
WO 2006/016760<br><br>
'A-'<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/002567<br><br>
software-processing logic against critical errors or definite faults in a television or a set-top box in an OpenCable system, it is possible to diagnose a CableCARD-related status and quickly handle the CableCARD when a problem is generated in the<br>
CableCARD, thereby reducing costs for service providers and providing an improvement in service quality to users. Specifically, relative to the case when digital interactive services are not verified and thus a large amount of time is consumed in testing CableCARDs, televisions, or set-top boxes and unexpected errors may be generated, significant cost reduction is expected by applying prevention handling to components in which the generation of error is expected, diagnosing the generation of critical errors, and performing proper processing when such critical errors are generated.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[291	The present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the ac-<br>
companying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown.<br>
[30]	PIG. 2 is a block diagram of an OpenCable host 200 according to an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[31 ]	Referring to FIG. 2, the OpenCable host 200 includes a first turner 201, a second<br>
tuner 202, a QPSK/QAM 16 transmitter (TX) 203, a receiver (RX) 204, a demodulator<br>
205,	a DOCSIS modem 206, a demultiplexer 207, a CPU 208, and a memory 209.<br>
[32]            A signal received via the first tuner 201 is demodulated by the demodulator 205<br>
and is input to an In-Band (TNB) processor 212 of a POD module 210. A signal received via the second tuner 202 is input to the CPU 208 via the DOCSIS modem<br>
206.	The RX 204 converts received data into a serial bit stream with a predetermined<br>
bit rate and transfers the serial bit stream to an OOB processor 211 of the POD module<br>
210. The serial bit stream is mainly used for transmitting a limited access authorization<br>
management message from a cable system to a POD module. The QPSK/QAM 16 TX<br>
203 modulates data received in a DOCSIC mode or in an OOB mode with a pre<br>
determined bit rate and transmits the modulated data through a cable. The de<br>
multiplexer 207 receives and demultiplexes data processed by the TNB processor 212<br>
of the POD module 210.<br>
[33]	The CPU 208 controls the respective components of the host 200. Specifically, the<br>
CPU 208 loads a POD status diagnosis program 220, diagnoses a POD module-related status or a network-related status, performs proper processing according to the<br><br>
-?-<br>
2006/016760	PCT/KR2005/002567<br>
diagnosis result, and outputs an appropriate message through a user interface so as to inform a user of information regarding the current status. The status information diagnosed by the CPU 208 is classified into status information regarding the CableCARD and status information regarding the network. The status information regarding the CableCard includes information, such as whether access to the virtual<br>
memory of the CableCARD is disallowed, whether the Card Information Structure<br>
(CIS) of the CableCARD is correct, whether a response time of the CableCARD<br>
exceeds a predetermined reference time, and so on. The status information regarding the network includes information such as whether communication with the outside is disconnected for thirty seconds, whether communication with a headend is disconnected regardless of A/V data transmission, whether an error is generated while software of the CableCARD is upgraded, whether information regarding the communication method of the CableCARD is requested, and so on. After diagnosing the CableCARD-related status or the network-related status, the CPU 208 performs proper processing according to the diagnosis result. If such processing is useless or if a critical error is generated, the CPU 208 outputs a message through the user interface in order to inform the user of the fact. The diagnosing and processing will be described in detail later with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
The POD module 210 is a removable module and may be a type of PC card which is plugged into a PCMCIA slot of a host. The POD module 210 has a security/access restriction function as well as a signal processing function and can be updated and replaced. Referring to FIG. 2, the POD module 210 plugged into the host 200 includes the OOB processor 211, the INB processor 212, a CPU 213, an attribute memory 214, and a configuration option register (COR) 216. FIG. 2 shows only components of the POD module 210 related to the present invention, and not the remaining components of the POD module 210.<br>
The OOB processor 211 performs deinterleaving, Reed-Solomon coding, and de-randomizing on the data stream received from the RX 204 of the host 200. The CPU 213 performs Media Access Control (MAC) layer protocol processing, such as MAC reassembly or MAC header analysis, on the data processed by the OOB processor 211.<br>
The INB processor 212 demultiplexes an MPEG-2 multiprogram stream received from the demodulator 205 into a program elementary stream, then multiplexes data encoded in a copy-protection engine to an MPEG-2 multiprogram stream, and transfers the results to the demultiplexer 207 of the host 200.<br>
The CPU 213 controls the respective components of the POD module 210 and creates a secret key to be used in a user authentication and copy-protection system.<br>
The attribute memory 214 stores card information structure (CIS) data. A CIS 215 is a data structure defined in the PCMCIA specification. The CableCARD has the same<br><br>
WO 2006/016760	PCT/KR2005/002567<br>
form as existing PCMCIA cards and operates under processes or protocols based on the PCMCIA 2.0 specification. The CIS 215 includes information, such as what the PCMCIA card is used for, the manufacturer of the CableCARD, a specification related to the CableCARD, and so on. The main information of the CIS 215 includes supply voltage-related information (e.g., VCC, VPP), serial code, module name, version information, etc. of the CableCARD.<br>
[39]	The COR 216 must be set to a predetermined value in order to allow the PCMCIA<br>
card to enter a CableCARD mode. The host 200 can allow the PCMCIA card to enter the CableCARD mode by correctly writing a SCTE Interface ID Number (SCTEJFN) value to the COR 216.<br>
[40]	FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a method for diagnosing the POD module-related<br>
status in an OpenCable host according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[41]	Referring to FIG. 3, first, a system is initialized (operation 301) and then a host<br>
initializes a CableCARD (operation 302). The initialization of the CableCARD is performed by reading CIS data from a virtual memory of the CableCARD and correctly writing the SCTE interface ID to a COR of a POD module.<br>
[42]	During the initialization, the host determines whether access to the virtual memory<br>
of the CableCARD is disallowed or whether the configuration of the CIS data is mismatched, etc. (operation 303).<br>
[43]	The access to the virtual memory of the CableCARD may be disallowed when<br>
power is initially turned on, when power is again turned on shortly after the power is turned off, when a user plugs the CableCARD into a CableCARD slot of a television or a set-top box shortly after unplugging the CableCARD. In these cases, the CableCARD and the television are initialized to each other. During the initialization, the host must read information regarding the type of the CableCARD from an attribute memory of the CableCARD. In order to perform this operation, access to the attribute memory must be granted to the host. That is, as soon as a CableCARD is inserted into a television, the television accesses an attribute memory and register of the CableCARD. In a normal case, the television reads 256-1024 bytes from the attribute memory and obtains information regarding the type, supply voltage, etc. of the CableCARD from the read information. If the access to the attribute memory is not granted to the host, it is determined that the hardware of the CableCARD has faults or that the CableCARD does not support the OpenCable specification.<br>
[44]	Also, the CIS contains information regarding what the PCMCIA card is used for,<br>
the manufacturer of the PCMCIA card, the specification of the PCMCIA card, etc. In<br>
the present exemplary embodiment, the information of the CIS must match with information of a CableCard which supports only the OpenCable specification. Here, it is<br><br>
WO 2006/016760<br><br><br><br>
PCT/KK2005/002567<br><br>
important that a conversion into a CableCARD mode is carried out by correctly writing a SCTEJFN to the COR. If the information does not match, the PCMCIA card cannot extend to a CableCARD and function as a CableCARD for DTV. The analysis for the CIS information is substantially for primary protection against illicit CableCARDs.<br>
[45]	If it is determined in operation 303 that the access to the virtual memory of the<br>
CableCARD is allowed and the data configuration of the CIS is matched, the initialization of the CableCARD is complete (operation 305). If the access to the virtual memory of the CableCARD is not allowed or if the data configuration of the CIS is mismatched, the process proceeds to operation 302 in order to again try the initialization of the CableCARD. If the access disallowance to the virtual memory of the CableCARD or the mismatch in the configuration of the CIS is determined three times, an error message is displayed through a user interface (operation 304). An example of the error message output to the user interface when the access to the virtual memory of the CableCARD is not allowed or when the configuration of the CIS is mismatched is shown in FIG. 4A. The error message shown in FIG. 4A contains contents indicating 'CableCARD Critical Error!!!! Please Call the Service Provider and Change the New CableCARD.'<br>
[46]	After the initialization of the CableCARD is complete, a response time is<br>
determined (operation 306). The determination of the response time of the CableCARD is carried out when the initialization of the CableCARD is completed and the CableCARD is normally performing its basic functions. The CableCARD operates together with the television. Since a television is generally used for a long time, error processing against the long time use of the CableCARD and the television is needed. Accordingly, by measuring a response time of the CableCARD through the television under the assumption that the television operates properly, and determining whether or not the response time exceeds a predetermined threshold time (for example, three seconds), the existence of an error is determined. If the response time exceeds the predetermined threshold time, it is determined that a problem exists in the CableCARD module and proper processing is performed.<br>
[47]	If the response time exceeds the predetermined threshold time (for example, three<br>
seconds), a software reset is performed (operation 307). The software reset, which is also called a POD reset, is carried out by instructing the host to set a RS bit of the COR whenever a change occurs in a POD attribute. At this time, the host and the POD module are initialized to a PCMCIA interface and changes to a POD interface at a predetermined time, and this change is defined as a 'change in POD attribute.'<br>
[48]	When the host sets the RS bits of both a data channel and its extended channel, the<br>
POD module detects channels whose RS bits are set. If the channels whose RS bits are set are detected, open sessions and transmission connections are all closed and the<br><br>
- fO-<br>
WO 2006/016760	PCT/KR2005/002567<br>
method returns to the operation just after the change occurs in the POD attribute. Since this reset prevents changes in routing of MPEG data streams, viewers cannot perceive any problems as long as A/V streams that they are watching are not scrambled.<br>
[49]	The POD reset is performed when the host detects an error in the POD module<br>
interface.<br>
[50]	Then, it is again determined whether the response time exceeds three seconds<br>
(operation 308). If the response time exceeds three seconds, a hardware reset is performed (operation 309). The hardware reset, which is also called a PCMCIA reset, is performed by the host transmitting a rest signal to the POD module. At this time, die interface returns to the PCMCIA interface to which the POD module no longer routes MPEG data streams. Accordingly, the PCMCIA reset should not be performed unless a critical error exists in the POD module or in the interface between the host and the POD module.<br>
[51 ]	Then, it is again determined whether the response time exceeds three seconds<br>
(operation 310). If the response time exceeds three seconds, an error message is displayed on the user interface (operation 304). An example of the error message output to the user interface when the response time exceeds three seconds is shown in FIG. 4B. The error message shown in FIG. 4B contains contents indicating 'CableCARD Operation is Unstable!! Please Call the Service Provider and Change the New CableCARD.*<br>
[52]	However, if the response time does not exceed three seconds three times in<br>
operations 306, 308, and 310, a communication disconnection time is checked (operation 311). If communication with the headend and the outside is disconnected for thirty seconds, that is, if no downstream information is received for thirty seconds, a network test is carried out using a Packet Internet Groper (PING). If a PING fails, it is determined that a problem exists on the network and an appropriate message is displayed to the user.<br>
[53]	If the communication disconnection time exceeds thirty seconds, an error message<br>
is displayed through the user interface (operation 304).<br>
[54]	An example of the error message displayed through the user interface when the<br>
communication disconnection time exceeds thirty seconds is shown in FIG. 4C. The error message shown in FIG. 4C contains contents indicating 'Network State is Unstable!! Please Call the Service Provider.'<br>
[55]	If the communication disconnection time does not exceed thirty seconds, the state<br>
of the network is checked (operation 312). This is performed by an interactive television in which a CableCARD mainly acts as a communication device when communication with a headend is disconnected. That is, in this case, communication with the headend is disconnected, while communication with the host is connected. In this<br><br>
-11-<br>
WO 2006/016760	PCT/KR2005/002567<br>
case, Audio/Video services through the host are supported, however, interactive services, such as interactive application operations, VOD services and so on, are not supported. Also, due to problems related to authentication for the headend, several services for scrambled channels are not supported. In this case, it is determined that a problem exists in the communication line or in the communication equipment of the headend, and an appropriate message is sent to the user interface in order to instruct the user to call the service provider.<br>
[56]	Then, it is determined whether an error is generated while software of the<br>
CableCARD is upgraded (operation 313). If an error is generated while the internal firmware of the CableCARD is upgraded, or if an error is generated after the CableCARD firmware is upgraded, information indicating to which version the CableCARD firmware is upgraded is provided to the user through the user interface, in order to allow the user to inform the service provider of the error. That is, if an error is generated, an error message is displayed through the user interface (operation 304). An example of the error message displayed through the user interface when the error is generated while the CableCARD software is upgraded, is shown in FIG. 4D. The error message shown in FIG. 4D contains contents indicating "Previous CableCARD Firmware Ver: 00.11.00, Current CableCARD Firmware Ver. 00.11.01, and Current CableCARD Firmware is Unstable.'<br>
[57]	If no error is generated, it is determined whether a message requesting information<br>
on the CableCARD's communication method is received (operation 314). A determination for an interactive communication method is performed in response to a request from the CableCARD. In this case, the user can know through which communication method his/her host is currently communicating. However, many differences exist between OOB and DOCSIS in terms of communication methods, service levels, and usage costs. For this reason, the user needs to know correct information regarding through which communication mode service his/her host is using to communicate. Therefore, by informing the user through a message of information regarding a communication method supported according to the type of the CableCARD, a communication method being currently used, etc. when the CableCARD is initialized, it is possible to allow the user to select services. If an information request is received, an information message regarding the CableCARD's communication method is provided through the user interface (operation 315).<br>
[58]	An example of the information message regarding the CableCARD's com-<br>
munication method is shown in FIG. 4E. The information message shown in FIG. 4E contains contents indicating 'current service mode is DOCSIS and CableCARD support<br>
mode is OOB/DOCSIS'.<br>
[59]	Then, in order to continue to monitor the status of the CableCARD or the network,<br><br>
WO 2006/016760<br><br><br><br>
PCT/KR2005/002567<br><br>
the process proceeds to operation 306. If no information request for the CableCARD's communication method is received, the process proceeds to operation 306.<br>
[60]	The CableCARD-related status diagnosing and processing method as described<br>
above can also be embodied as computer readable code/instructions/programs on a computer readable recording medium. Examples of the computer readable recording medium include storage media, such as magnetic storage media (for example, ROMs, floppy disks, hard disks, magnetic tapes, etc.), optical reading media (for example, CD-ROMs, DVDs, etc.), carrier waves (for example, transmission through the Internet) and the like. The computer readable recording medium can also be distributed over network coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion. Functional programs/code/code segments for implementing the present invention can be easily deduced by programmers skilled in the art.<br>
