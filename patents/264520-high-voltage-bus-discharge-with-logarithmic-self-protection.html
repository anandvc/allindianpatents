				<td>HIGH-VOLTAGE BUS DISCHARGE<br>
WITH LOGARITHMIC SELF-PROTECTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate<br>
generally to electric and hybrid vehicle drive systems, and more particularly,<br>
embodiments of the subject matter relate to discharge circuits for high-voltage<br>
bus capacitance.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the power usage and complexity of the various<br>
electrical systems within automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles,<br>
such as hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles.<br>
[0003] In most hybrid vehicles, energy storage devices, such as capacitors,<br>
are often used to improve efficiency by capturing energy within the powertrain<br>
system or supplying additional power during periods of operation when a<br>
primary energy source cannot supply the required power quickly enough. For<br>
example, regenerative braking may be used to capture energy by converting<br>
kinetic energy to electrical energy and storing the electrical energy in a bank<br>
of capacitors for later use. In order to accommodate high-voltage operation<br>
within automobiles, capacitor banks or supercapacitors are often used because<br>
they have the ability to quickly store energy and can be discharged at a much<br>
higher rate than other energy sources.<br>
[0004] However, capacitors may retain a charge long after power is<br>
removed from a circuit or an automobile is turned off. Therefore, high-voltage<br>
capacitors should be properly discharged after turning off a vehicle or before<br><br>
accessing the equipment housing the capacitors. Discharging a capacitor is<br>
typically accomplished by placing a discharge or bleed resistor across the<br>
capacitor or bus terminals in parallel.<br>
[0005] In an automobile, there are possible fault conditions that may result<br>
in a constant voltage across the capacitor terminals. If a fault is not properly<br>
detected and protected against, attempting to discharge the capacitor will<br>
overheat and destroy the discharge resistor. Moreover, the failure of a<br>
discharge resistor prevents future discharge, resulting in voltage being retained<br>
on a capacitor or within the circuit for an extended period of time.<br>
[0006] Previous discharge circuits and methods require unacceptably high<br>
average power dissipation in a discharge resistor during fault conditions and<br>
are not easily adaptable to higher voltage levels. These designs require<br>
discharge resistors with the ability to handle high average power dissipation.<br>
These resistors generally occupy a larger surface area and often require<br>
additional harnesses, connectors, and heat sinks, which prevent the discharge<br>
resistors from being built on a circuit board. In addition to the spatial<br>
requirements, these discharge circuits are adapted more for the less frequent<br>
fault mode, rather than a normal operating mode.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0007] A method is provided for controlling a discharge circuit coupled to<br>
a high-voltage bus, wherein the discharge circuit is activated such that current<br>
flows from the high-voltage bus through the discharge circuit. The method<br>
comprises determining a first discharge time based on a first voltage level of<br>
the high-voltage bus, obtaining a second voltage level of the high-voltage bus<br>
after the first discharge time, and deactivating the discharge circuit if a<br>
difference between the first voltage level and the second voltage level is less<br>
than a threshold value.<br>
[0008] A method is provided for discharging a high-voltage bus coupled to<br>
a discharge circuit. The method comprises obtaining a first voltage level of<br>
the high-voltage bus. The method further comprises determining a first<br><br>
discharge time based on the first voltage level and activating the discharge<br>
circuit. The method further comprises obtaining a second voltage level of the<br>
high-voltage bus after the first discharge time, comparing the first voltage<br>
level and the second voltage level, and deactivating the discharge circuit if a<br>
difference between the first voltage level and the second voltage level is less<br>
than a threshold value.<br>
[0009] An apparatus for a vehicle protection system for a high-voltage<br>
capacitor bank coupled to a high-voltage bus is provided. The vehicle<br>
protection system comprises a discharge circuit coupled to the high-voltage<br>
bus and a discharge controller coupled to the high-voltage bus and the<br>
discharge circuit. The discharge controller is configured to activate the<br>
discharge circuit in response to a signal indicating the high-voltage bus should<br>
be discharged, determine a first discharge time based on a first voltage level of<br>
the high-voltage bus, obtain a second voltage level of the high-voltage bus<br>
after the first discharge time, and deactivate the discharge circuit if a<br>
difference between the first voltage level and the second voltage level of the<br>
high-voltage bus is less than a threshold value.<br>

of the depicted subject matter.<br>
[0019] FIG. 1 illustrates an operative environment in a vehicle, or<br>
automobile 10, in accordance with one embodiment. The automobile 10<br>
includes a chassis 12, a body 14, four wheels 16, and an electronic control<br>
system 18. The body 14 is arranged on the chassis 12 and substantially<br>
encloses the other components of the automobile 10. The body 14 and the<br>
chassis 12 may jointly form a frame. The wheels 16 are each rotationally<br>
coupled to the chassis 12 near a respective corner of the body 14.<br>
[0020] The automobile 10 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD), or all-wheel drive<br>
(AWD). The automobile 10 may also incorporate any one of, or combination<br>
of, a number of different types of engines, such as, for example, a gasoline or<br>
diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV) engine (i.e.,<br>
using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound (e.g., hydrogen<br>
and natural gas) fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and<br>
an electric motor. In an exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the<br>
automobile 10 is a hybrid vehicle, and may further include an electric<br>
motor/generator (or "traction" motor) 20, a first energy source 22, a second<br>
energy source 24, a power inverter assembly 26, and a radiator 28. As shown,<br>
the automobile 10 may comprise two energy sources 22, 24, although the<br>
subject matter discussed herein is not limited to a particular type of automobile<br>
10, and the automobile 10 may instead utilize more or less than two energy<br>
sources 22, 24.<br>
[0021] As shown in FIG. 1, the first energy source 22 and the second<br>
energy source 24 are in operable communication and/or electrically coupled to<br>
the electronic control system 18 and the power inverter assembly 26.<br>
Although not illustrated, the first energy source 22 and the second energy<br>
source 24 may vary depending on the embodiment and may be of the same or<br><br>
different type. In one or more embodiments, the first energy source 22 and<br>
second energy source 24 may each comprise a battery, a fuel cell, a capacitor<br>
bank, or another suitable voltage source. A battery may be any type of battery<br>
suitable for use in a desired application, such as a lead acid battery, a lithium-<br>
ion battery, a nickel-metal battery, or another rechargeable battery. A<br>
capacitor bank may comprise an uitracapacitor (or supercapacitor), an<br>
electrochemical double layer capacitor, or any other electrochemical capacitor<br>
with high energy density suitable for a desired application.<br>
[0022] Referring now to FIG. 2, the power inverter assembly 26 may be<br>
coupled to a high-voltage bus 36. The high-voltage bus 36 may be coupled to<br>
the first.energy source 22, the second energy source 24, a capacitor bank, or<br>
any other suitable device containing stored energy (not shown). In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, a discharge controller 38 is coupled to the high-<br>
voltage bus 36 and a discharge circuit 40. The discharge circuit 40 is coupled<br>
to the high-voltage bus 36 and the reference ground 37. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, a system controller 34 is in operable communication with and/or<br>
electrically coupled to the power inverter assembly 26 and the discharge<br>
controller 38.<br>
[0023] In an exemplary embodiment, the discharge controller 38 is an 8-<br>
bit microcontroller, although other configurations are possible. For example,<br>
the discharge controller 38 could be embodied in a processor, or integrated<br>
into the system controller 34, the electronic control system 18, or another<br>
module. The discharge controller 38 may comprise a lookup table 39 in an<br>
exemplary embodiment. In other embodiments, the discharge controller 38<br>
may include and/or be coupled to a database, flash memory, FPGA, or other<br>
hardware used for storing and/or correlating values. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the discharge circuit 40 and discharge controller 38 may be<br>
located on the circuit board within the power inverter assembly 26. In other<br>
embodiments, the discharge circuit 40 and discharge controller 38 may be<br>
located anywhere within the automobile 10 powertrain, inside or coupled to a<br>
power converter, or coupled to any other element containing stored energy.<br><br>
[0024] Referring again to FIG. 1, the electronic control system 18 is in<br>
operable communication with the motor 20, the first energy source 22, the<br>
second energy source 24, and the power inverter assembly 26. Although not<br>
shown in detail, the electronic control system 18 may include various sensors<br>
and automotive control modules, or electronic control units (ECUs), such as<br>
an inverter control module (i.e., the system controller 34) and a vehicle<br>
controller. The system controller 34 is responsive to commands received from<br>
the driver of the automobile 10 (i.e., via the electronic control system 18) and<br>
provides commands to the power inverter assembly 26 to control the motor 20<br>
and automobile 10 power train, as will be understood in the art.<br>
[0025] Referring now to FIG. 3, a vehicle protection system 42 in<br>
accordance with one embodiment is shown. The discharge circuit 40 further<br>
comprises a resistive element 44 and a switching element 46. As shown, in<br>
accordance with one embodiment, the resistive element 44 may be coupled<br>
between the high-voltage bus 36 and the switching element 46. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the resistive element 44 is a high-energy or pulse<br>
resistor capable of handling individual pulses of energy well. The switching<br>
element 46 is coupled to the discharge controller 38, such that the discharge<br>
controller 38 may be configured to activate the discharge circuit 40 by<br>
switching on the switching element 46 creating a path for current to flow from<br>
the high-voltage bus 36 through the discharge circuit 40. As shown in FIG. 3,<br>
the switching element 46 may preferably be realized as a MOSFET with a<br>
diode connected between its source and drain, although it will be appreciated<br>
in the art that alternative embodiments may employ any suitable switch<br>
configuration or equivalents thereof.<br>
[0026] In an exemplary embodiment, a capacitor bank 48 is coupled to the<br>
high-voltage bus 36. The high-voltage bus 36 and/or the capacitor bank 48<br>
may be connected to additional elements as will be understood in the art. The<br>
vehicle protection system 42 may include a voltage divider circuit (e.g.,<br>
comprising Rl, and R2 as shown) for the purposes of reducing the voltage<br><br>
level at the input to the discharge controller 38, as will be appreciated in the<br>
art.<br>
[00271 Referring to FIG. 4, in an exemplary embodiment, the discharge<br>
controller 38 may be designed to perform a discharge control process 400 and<br>
the tasks, functions, and operations described below. The various tasks<br>
performed in connection with the discharge control process 400 may be<br>
performed by software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. For<br>
illustrative purposes, the following description of the discharge control process<br>
400 may refer to elements mentioned above in connection with FIGS. 1-3. In<br>
practice, portions of the discharge control process 400 may be performed by<br>
different elements of the described system. It should be appreciated that the<br>
discharge control process 400 may include any number of additional or<br>
alternative tasks, the tasks shown in FIG. 4 need not be performed in the<br>
illustrated order, and the discharge control process 400 may be incorporated<br>
into a more comprehensive procedure or process having additional<br>
functionality not described in detail herein.<br>
[0028] Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the vehicle protection system may<br>
operate in an idle state, during which the discharge circuit is inactive (task<br>
402). The system controller may be configured to provide a discharge signal<br>
to the discharge controller to activate or trigger the discharge circuit. The<br>
system controller may provide a discharge signal upon an occurrence of a<br>
specified event (i.e., the automobile is keyed off, the power inverter assembly<br>
is opened, a unit containing a capacitor bank is accessed, etc.). The vehicle<br>
protection system may remain idle until receiving a signal indicating the high-<br>
voltage bus should be discharged (i.e., a discharge signal).<br>
[0029] In an exemplary embodiment, in response to receiving a discharge<br>
signal, the discharge controller may be configured to wait for a period of time<br>
in order to filter out any possible noise or error that could cause a false<br>
discharge signal (i.e., electromagnetic interference, false command, etc.) (task<br>
404). The delay is optional as will be appreciated in the art. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, if the discharge signal is not present after the delay (e.g.,<br><br>
Discharge = False), the discharge controller may determine the signal was<br>
erroneous and return to the idle state. If the discharge signal remains present<br>
(e.g., Discharge = True), the discharge controller may obtain a first voltage<br>
level of the high-voltage bus (task 406).<br>
[0030] In an exemplary embodiment, the discharge controller may obtain a<br>
first voltage level of the high-voltage bus (Vi) (task 406). This may be done,<br>
for example, by using an analog-to-digital converter (A/D or ADC) provided<br>
as a feature of the discharge controller. As shown in FIG. 3, a voltage divider<br>
circuit may be utilized to scale down or reduce the analog voltage at the<br>
discharge controller input to a suitable level that is compatible with the<br>
operating range of the discharge controller. The discharge controller may be<br>
configured to activate the discharge circuit, causing current to flow from the<br>
high-voltage bus through the discharge circuit (i.e., by switching on the<br>
switching element in the discharge circuit) (task 408).<br>
[0031) In accordance with one embodiment, the discharge controller may<br>
be configured to determine a discharge time (ts) based on the first voltage level<br>
(Vi) of the high-voltage bus (task 410). In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
discharge time is chosen as the minimum amount of time necessary to<br>
determine whether the high-voltage bus is properly discharging. The<br>
minimum amount of time necessary to determine whether the high-voltage bus<br>
is properly discharging may be calculated based on known or measurable<br>
parameters of the vehicle protection system.<br>
[0032] In an exemplary embodiment, the discharge time may be<br>
determined based on the operating characteristics of the discharge circuit<br>
coupled to the high-voltage bus. The discharge circuit may be represented as<br>
an RC circuit. By virtue of this relationship, the discharge time for a given<br>
voltage level may be determined based on the relationship<br>
  wherein Vδ is a threshold value, Vi is the first voltage<br>
level, and RC is a constant representing an operating characteristic of the<br>
discharge circuit.<br><br>
[0033] In an exemplary embodiment, the threshold value (Vδ) representing<br>
the smallest change in voltage level measurable by the discharge controller<br>
(i.e., the associated analog-to-digital converter) with reasonable accuracy may<br>
be chosen. In an exemplary case, the threshold value may be calculated using<br>
the equation where is the number of bits of<br>
error introduced through analog-to-digital conversion (A/D) and/or<br>
quantization, Bthreshold is the decimal conversion of the binary representation of<br>
a desired voltage change in a high-voltage bus,  is the reference voltage<br>
level of the analog-to-digital converter, and n is the number of resolution bits<br>
associated with the analog-to-digital converter.<br>
[0034] The discharge time (ts) for a given voltage level may be determined<br>
at run-time or it may be pre-calculated. In accordance with one embodiment,<br>
a plurality of discharge times may be predetermined and calculated for a range<br>
of possible voltage levels of the high-voltage bus and stored in a lookup table<br>
or database coupled to or incorporated in the discharge controller. For<br>
example, in the case of an 8-bit A/D microcontroller (i.e., n = 8), there are 256<br>
possible voltage levels the discharge controller can resolve. Therefore, 256<br>
different corresponding tδ values for a plurality of possible voltage levels may<br>
be calculated and stored in a lookup table, database, etc. coupled to the<br>
discharge controller.<br>
[0035] FIG. 5 shows the relationship between Vδ, tδ, and the voltage level<br>
of the high-voltage bus. In an exemplary embodiment, for each tg, the energy<br>
dissipated by the discharge circuit is essentially equal. For example, as<br>
shown, at a first voltage level Vi, the length of time tδ1 required to dissipate a<br>
certain amount of energy (proportionally related to Vδ) is noticeably less than<br>
the amount of time tδ2 in which approximately the same amount of energy is<br>
dissipated at a lower initial voltage level (Vi+1).<br>
[0036] Referring back to FIG. 4, in an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
discharge controller may be configured to obtain a second voltage level of the<br><br>
high-voltage bus (Vi+1) after the first discharge time (tδ) has elapsed (Vi) (task<br>
412). The discharge controller may determine whether a difference between<br>
the first voltage level and the next voltage level is less than the threshold value<br>
(task 414). If the difference between the first voltage level and the second<br>
voltage level is greater than or equal to the threshold value <br><br>
then the high-voltage bus is properly discharging. If the high-voltage bus is<br>
properly discharging, the process of determining a discharge time and<br>
determining if the high-voltage bus is properly discharging repeats for the<br>
second voltage level (i.e., Vi+1 =&gt;Vi) (tasks 410, 412, 414, 416). The process<br>
may repeat until the voltage level of the high-voltage bus reaches zero or is<br>
essentially negligible.<br>
[0037] However, if the difference between the first voltage level and the<br>
second voltage level is less than the threshold value, the high-voltage bus is<br>
not properly discharging. This may indicate a possible a fault condition (i.e.,<br>
high-voltage bus contactors are connected, a constant energy source is applied<br>
to the high-voltage bus, etc.). In order to protect the components of the<br>
vehicle protection system and prevent the discharge circuit from overheating,<br>
the discharge controller may be configured to deactivate the discharge circuit<br>
(task 418). In an exemplary embodiment, the discharge controller may be<br>
configured to wait for a recovery time, before returning to the idle state (task<br>
420). The recovery time is based on the average power handling capacity of<br>
the resistive element in the discharge circuit and prevents the discharge<br>
controller from possibly reactivating the discharge circuit too soon, which<br>
could cause the average power dissipation by the resistive element to exceed<br>
its power rating. In an exemplary embodiment, after the recovery time, the<br>
discharge controller may return to an idle state, and reactivate the discharge<br>
circuit in response to a discharge signal (tasks 402, 404, 406, 408).<br>
[0038] One advantage of the system and/or method described above is that<br>
the vehicle protection system 42 maintains constant energy dissipation per<br>
discharge time interval while still providing protection in case of a fault<br><br>
condition, allowing the system designer to optimize components for normal<br>
operation (i.e., by using high-energy pulse resistors which are a fraction of the<br>
size of other resistors with better average power characteristics). Furthermore,<br>
because the discharge time is smaller at higher voltage levels, the recovery<br>
time during a fault condition can be substantially reduced. The discharge time<br>
is increased as the high-voltage bus discharges, which improves A/D<br>
resolution and accuracy at lower voltage levels. Other embodiments may<br>
utilize the systems and methods described above in different types of<br>
automobiles, different vehicles (e.g., watercraft and aircraft), or in different<br>
electrical systems altogether, as it may be implemented in any situation where<br>
a high-voltage bus needs to be reliably discharged.<br>
[0039] For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques related to signal<br>
processing, signaling, switch control, and other functional aspects of the<br>
systems (and the individual operating components of the systems) may not be<br>
described in detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting lines shown in the<br>
various figures contained herein are intended to represent exemplary<br>
functional relationships and/or physical couplings between the various<br>
elements. It should be noted that many alternative or additional functional<br>
relationships or physical connections may be present in an embodiment of the<br>
subject matter.<br>
[0040] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the<br>
scope, applicability, or configuration of the claimed subject matter in any way.<br>
Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art<br>
with a convenient road map for implementing the described embodiment or<br>
embodiments. It should be understood that various changes can be made in<br>
the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the scope<br>
defined by the claims, which includes known equivalents and foreseeable<br>
equivalents at the time of filing this patent application.<br><br>
