3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
Textile Machine<br>
The present invention relates to a textile machine, in particular a carding machine, a draw frame or a combing machine comprising at least two electrical drives whose rotational speeds are coordinated with each other in function of a master functionality to drive machine elements, in particular fiber material drafting elements, measuring elements, conveying elements and/or storing elements, as well as with at least one measuring device for the determination of actual value of drive and/or fiber material related measured values.<br>
The utilization of decentralized drives or individual drives has been known for a long time in the textile industry. Thus DE 29 41 612 C2 for example discloses a draw frame four the doubling and drafting of fiber slivers by means of drafting equipment with pairs of rollers driven by separate electrical motors whose rotational speed ratios can be adjusted by means of a frequency divider. A central computing unit continuously computes the fiber sliver mass of the passing fiber sliver and indicates rotational target speeds for the different roller pairs. In this machine as well as in other known textile machines with individual drives, the master-slave principle is used. The term 'individual drive" is understood to mean here that several drives are provided, each of which drives one or several axes. According to the master-slave principle a real motor axis is defined as the master, whereby the other axes of the electric drives follow the rotational speed ratio determined by the master. Alternatively a virtual master is provided to generate target values without any deviation from the theoretically ideal form. In operation, all slaves are synchronized by a clocking signal of the virtual master to the same scanning moment. The real as well as the virtual master interrogate during operation the slave drives at regular time intervals [so-called polling], whereby the resulting data are as a rule transmitted via bus connections.<br><br>
It is a disadvantage in these textile machines that the utilization of the known master-slave principle can not ensure that all the drives will be operated in optimal synchronization with each other.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to improve the drafting precision with the utilization of several drives in a textile machine and in particular in a spinning mill machine with drafting equipment.<br>
This object is attained in a textile machine of the type mentioned initially by at least one control and/or regulating unit by means off which master function changes can be effected in function of the actual values.<br>
The advantages of the invention consist in particular in the fact that with a suitable design of the machine, the master functionality can change in function of current conditions. Thus it is possible for the master function to be assigned by the [at least one] control and/or regulating unit momentarily to one of several drives. A virtual master can also indicate the motor speeds at intervals. This results in the possibility for different drives to function at different times as master. Thereby the master function can be transmitted depending on the currently prevailing situation, and can possibly also be transmitted to a virtual master.<br>
The actual values are preferably transmitted to the central or decentrally designed control and/or regulating unit which determines the master at the moment based on these values. This unit advantageously also prescribes also the corresponding new rotational target speeds of the drives, if necessary while taking additional parameters into account. In a textile machine with a regulated drafting equipment, the values regarding sliver cross-section measurements in particular flow from the drafting equipment into the computation of the rotational target speeds. The determination of the master functionality on the one hand and the indication of the new rotational target speeds on the other hand may be distributed over several units.<br>
3<br><br>
Most preferably the currently weakest drive assumes each time the role of the master e.g. so as not to overload this drive or, in the case of a regulating draw frame, to achieve continuously good sliver quality.<br>
It is advantageous to define limit values that can be fixed or variable for several or all measuring devices, above or below which a control and/or regulating unit operating according to the invention obtains the momentary actual values from the corresponding measuring device [or signals derived or pre-processed from these actual values]. From this the rotational target speeds are immediately calculated [in a regulated draw frame in particular while taking into account the current sliver cross-section fluctuations] for the other drives and are transmitted to the drives.<br>
The indication of limit values is useful since e.g. when measuring the motor current consumption within certain actual-value ranges of a drive functioning currently as slave, there is no necessity to change it into a master drive. Only beyond the applicable limit value does the current consumption measuring element of this drive signal that this drive is unable to meet the current requirements and therefore usefully takes over the master function so that the other drives can model themselves after it.<br>
Preferably no constant polling nor polling at regular intervals is carried out in connection with the above by the control and/or regulating unit according to the invention. As long as no change in the master-slave assignment is necessary, i.e. as long as the current master-slave distribution meets the current drive requirements, such a polling by the control and/ or regulating unit is not necessary. Current actual values [possibly after a preparation] registered by a measuring unit are rather preferably transmitted only when they are outside a predetermined value range.<br>
Cases are however possible in which the actual values are advantageously constantly transmitted by one, several or all measuring devices so as to taken into account by the<br>
4<br><br>
control and/or regulating unit. In this manner e.g. a knowledge base can be built up to be consulted to assist in the assignment of the master functionality.<br>
Different measured values whose actual values [or derived signals] are transmitted to the control and/or regulating unit which determines the master functionality can be measured by means of suitable measuring devices. Thus measuring devices for the measuring of the rotational speeds of the drive axes or changes in rotational speed can be provided in particular. Alternatively or in addition, rotational moments, motor currents of the drives, phase shifts and/or the phase angle of the drives, the speed of revolutions or their timely derivation as well as the motor temperatures can be measured. Alternatively or in addition, e.g. thick spots and/or fiber material characteristics are measured by means of measuring devices or sensors. If for example a scanning roller signal regarding the fiber sliver cross-section [the terms fiber sliver mass, fiber sliver thickness or fiber sliver volume are also known] is measured, then in case of very large thick spots this signal can be used at the scanning roller in order to determine a virtual master which could be integrated e.g. in a control and/or regulating unit and causing the entire machine to run more slowly in order to ensure precise drafting at lower delivery speed. It is also possible to measure drafting force at the fiber sliver[s] to be drafted. In general terms, the actual values can be measured as measured values related to the drives or the fiber material or the drafting.<br>
Overall very great flexibility with respect to the drives is achieved by means of the invention, since contrary to the state of the art, constantly subordinate drives are not dependent on one and the same master drive or virtual master. The invention makes it rather possible to realize a regulation of target values dependent on contouring errors, whereby the master control functions can be transferred depending on the situation. This takes place for example, in a preferred embodiment, by transfer of the master to the currently especially weakest drive.<br>
5<br><br>
The invention can be applied to textile machines and in particular to spinning mill machines with drafting equipment in which at least two drives are provided. These drives drive either one single or several elements. Drives of this type can be provided in particular for a draw frame, for draw-off rollers at the drafting equipment input, input rollers, central rollers and/or output or delivery rollers of the drafting equipment, for draw-off rollers at the drafting equipment output, for a rotary plate installed above a can, as well as for a rotating or traversing standing surface of a memory can to be filled, in view of the above, several of the above-mentioned elements can also be driven by one single motor. One motor can be used e.g. for the output roller pair as well as for the downstream pair of calender rollers [pair of draw-off rollers]. A second motor can drive a pair of scanning rollers upstream rollers preceding the drafting equipment as well as the pair of input rollers and the central roller pair of the drafting equipment. A third motor can function as draw-in drive, whereby this drive serves in particular to draw off the presented slivers from the presentation cans. A fourth drive would then drive the rotary plate, for example, as well as the standing surface for the can. Different variations of such a design are possible.<br>
In a regulating draw-frame the values of sliver cross-sections measured advantageously before the drafting equipment are transmitted to a regulating computer which computes the setting values or target values for the drafting equipment drives. These target values are then retransmitted according to the invention to the control and/or regulating unit which if necessary adapts these rotational target speeds in function of the current actual values [i.e. of the current master] and transmits the possibly modified rotational target speeds to the drives. The control and/or regulating unit assumes here the synchronization of the drives. Depending on design, the adaptation of the rotational target speeds calculated from the actual values on basis of sliver fluctuations can also take place in the regulating computer.<br>
The control and/or regulating unit operating according to the invention can be designed as a central unit. Depending on the actual values of one or several measuring<br>
6<br><br>
devices presented to the central control and/or regulating unit, the target values of all drives are determined and specified for all drives while taking into account the setting values or target values for the drafting equipment drives.<br>
Alternatively or in addition, a single drive or every drive can be assigned a control and/or regulating unit, also under the designation "motion control", preferably designed as a memory- programmable control [SPS]. In such a preferred case one of the memory-programmable controls is responsible for receiving the actual values of the different measuring devices, the computation of the new actual rotational speed target values on basis of the rotational speed target values calculated by the regulating computer for the drafting equipment drives as well as for the transmission to the proper drives. A division of these functions among several controls can also be provided. It is also possible for the function of reception and computation as well as transmission to be transferred to one of the other memory-programmable controls. In a variant a central control and/or regulating unit can transfer these tasks to the control and/or regulating units assigned to the other drives in a flexible manner. All the mentioned designs increase the versatility and independence of the control and/or regulating responsibility.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment the at least one control and/or regulating unit can limit the new rotational target speeds for all drives, including the current master drive, beyond the momentarily necessary degree, so that the machine can be driven either briefly or over a longer period of time with lower dynamic. This situation can be interpreted within the framework of the invention in the sense that the currently weakest drive functions briefly as master which the other drives must follow. If the rotational speeds are lowered further, this can be seen as a take-over of the master function by a virtual master. The duration of lowered dynamic can follow the currently lowest drive such as e.g. degree of overload. By contrast the dynamic of the machine is considerably higher while the rotational target speeds of all drives are adjusted, so that<br>
7<br><br>
the delivery speed of the fiber sliver leaving the draw frame changes often, but the result is high productivity.<br>
The communication among the individual drives and/or with a central control and/or regulating unit takes place by means of a bus connection in a preferred embodiment. In that case it is advantageous to use a parallel or serial bus system, a CAN bus, a Profi bus or an Interbus. Alternatively individual connections between the measuring device or devices and at least one control and/or regulating unit is provided and these can be made in form of digital or analog conduits.<br>
Several examples of applications of the invention will b e given below. If for instance a limit value of the motor current of a drive or the steady-load limit of a drive axle has been reached, this drive can assume the master function so that the rotational speed of the other axes are coordinated with the mentioned limits. In case of a brief motor overload or mechanical axle overload, this drive advantageously also assumes the master function so that the remaining drives are reduced according to their own possibilities in order to maintain the synchronicity of rotational speeds. In case of power failure and the resulting coasting of the machine, the master can change several times in a further variant, whereby this change is advantageously determined by the energy maintenance of the respectively driven machine parts.<br>
It is furthermore advantageous if the assignment of the master functionality according to the invention takes place when starting and/or stopping the machine. Thus for example, one of the drives can be assigned the master function as the machine runs up to a given delivery speed of the drafted fiber sliver or up to a predetermined current consumption by this drive, so as to surrender the master functionality thereafter in normal operation to another drive or to a virtual master.<br>
In another example of an application a textile machine is constituted b y two machine modules connected one after the other which are set up separately or are combined in<br>
8<br><br>
one frame, e.g. a carding machine and a draw frame. The master functionality can alter in this case e.g. from one drive of one module to a drive of the other module. In the example of a combined carding machine or draw frame the master functionality can be assigned to the appertaining drive of the carding machine at the card output in case of speed fluctuations of the fiber material arrival at the card input or of the fiber sliver delivery at the card output.<br>
The user can advantageously influence the time at which a drive or a virtual master assumes the master function. This can be achieved in particular by specifying the mentioned limit or threshold values for the transfer of the actual values of the measuring device. Advantageously operating processes can be specified according to which the master function changes when certain actual values are reached - e.g. those of a given delivery speed as a draw frame funs up.<br>
It is furthermore preferred for a current master to be displayed to the user on a visualization unit.<br>
Advantageous further developments of the invention are characterized by the characteristics of the sub-claims.<br>
The invention is explained in further detail below through the drawings.<br>

Fig. 2 shows a regulating draw frame in schematic lateral view in a second embodiment<br>
and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a regulating draw-frame in schematic lateral view in a third embodiment.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a lateral view of a regulating draw frame with drafting equipment (2) as an example of a textile machine according to the invention that comprises a pair of<br>
9<br><br>
input rollers (6), a pair of central rollers (7) and a pair of output rollers (8). Upstream of the drafting equipment (2) is a pair of draw-in rollers (3) serving to pull one or several fiber slivers (FB) from cans which are not shown here. A sliver cross-section measuring device (5) in form of a pair of scanning rollers with upstream compacting funnel (4) is installed between the drafting equipment (2) and the pair of draw-in rollers (3) and supplies signals relating to the sliver cross-section of the at least one fiber sliver (FB). Instead of a air of scanning rollers other cross-section measuring devices (5) are possible, e.g. microwave resonators, capacitive sensors, ultrasound sensors etc. The fiber sliver or slivers (FB) are drafted in a known manner in function of the different rotational speeds of the roller pairs 6, 7, 8. Between the pair of central rollers (7) and the pair of output rollers (8) a pressure rod (9) is furthermore provided for improved guidance of the floating fibers. Immediately following the pair of output rollers (8) is a deflection roller (10) which deflects the drafter fiber fleece towards a fleece guiding dev ice (11) and a downstream pair of calender rollers (12) which compacts the fiber fleece into a fiber sliver and which can be designed in a known manner at the same time as a cross-section measuring device (12) for the control of the sliver cross-section of the resulting fiber sliver (FB). Alternatively other measuring methods (with microwaves, capacitive, etc) can be used. The fiber sliver FB is then introduced into the sliver channel of a rotating rotary plate (13) and is deposited in loops in a can (14) standing on a can supporting surface (15) which is also rotated. Alternatively the fiber sliver FB can be deposited into a rectangular can that traverses back and forth.<br>
For the lower roller (3a) of the pair of draw-in rollers (3) an individual drive (30) is provided which comprises a regulator (31), a motor (32) and analog or digital actual-value indicator (33) [e.g. a tachogenerator]. Another drive 30 with a regulator (41), a motor (42) and an actual-value indicator (43) (e.g. a tachogenerator) is used to drive the pair oi scanning rollers (5) as well as the lower input and central rollers 6a, 7a. A drive of the respective upper rollers [not shown] is of course also possible. In the preliminary drafting field constituted between the pairs of input and central rollers 6, 7 a constant preliminary drafting is thus applied in this embodiment. A third drive 50 with regulator<br>
10<br><br>
51, motor 52 and indicator of actual value 53 ([e.g. a tachogenerator] is provided for the drive of the lower output roller (8a) and for the pair of calender rollers (12). Finally a fourth drive 60 with regulator 61, motor 62 and indicator of actual value 63 [e.g. a tachogenerator] drives the rotary plate 13 as well as the can supporting surface (15).<br>
Each of the motors 32, 42, 52, 62 is regulated via a closed regulating circuit. The target values of the motors are first determined based on the desired target value for the cross-section of the drafted fiber sliver as well as of the current measured values of the cross-section measuring device (5) preceding the drafting equipment (2) which are transmitted via a conduit 22 to a regulating computer 18. the regulating computer 18 then computes target values for the drafting equipment motors 42 and/ or 52 in function of the state of the art, taking into account the running time of the fiber sliver or slivers from the measuring point to the drafting point. Using the signals transmitted by the cross-section measuring device via a conduit 27 to regulating computer (18), the quality of the resulting fiber sliver can be determined and displayed.<br>
For the sake of clarity several normally present machine units such as e.g. the machine center, a service unit, a visualization unit [panel, etc.] are not shown in Fig. 1 or the other figures.<br>
Within the framework of the invention the actual-value indicators (33, 43, 53, 63) deliver a signal corresponding to the rotational motor speed, not only to the appertaining regulator (31, 41,51, 61) but also via a bus 70 to a central control and/or regulating unit (19) which is combined into one unit 20 in the shown embodiment, the control and/or regulating unit (19) determines on basis of these signals which one of the drives 30, 40,50, 60 should currently be the master drive, whereby the other drives then serve as slave drives. Alternatively a virtual master can also be designated for intermediate specification of the rotational target speeds. The master functionality can thus be passed back and forth from the control and/or regulating unit (19) among the drives 30, 40, 50, 60 and possibly a virtual master.<br>
11<br><br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 the control and/or regulating unit (19) processes on the one hand target values computed by the regulating computer (18) for the drafting equipment drives 40 and/or 50 and on the other hand also the actual values of the actual-value indicators 33, 43, 53, 63 to specify rotational target values - possibly modified according to the current master - for the motors 32, 42, 52,62. In an alternative embodiment the actual values of the actual-value indicators 33,43, 53,63 are transmitted from the control and/or regulating unit (19) to the regulating computer (18) [see double arrow between 18 [see double arrow between regulating computer (18) and unit 19) and are used there, together with the measured values of the cross-section measuring device (5), to compute the rotational target speeds of the motors 32, 42, 52, 62. The control and/or regulating unit (19) can also transmit short messages based merely on actual values to the regulating computer (18), e.g. the fact that the entire machine, e.g. due to overload on one motor (the current master) should run at only 80% of the set delivery speed until the regulating computer (18) receives a new signal from the control and/or regulating unit 19. The computation of the rotational target speeds to be actually specified from the motors 32, 42, 52, 62 is then left entirely up to the regulating computer (18), whereby the control and/or regulating unit (19) serves primarily in that case to synchronize the drives (30,40,50, 60).<br>
A given drive can function routinely as master, whereby this functionality can be transferred to one of the other drives under special operating conditions, so that the former master then serves as slave and is again used as master in the following normalization of operations.<br>
The actual values of the voltage signals corresponding to the motor speeds are advantageously not constantly transmitted to the control and/or regulating unit (19) by the actual-value indicators. Only when predetermined limit values of these signals are not reached or are exceeded are they preferably transmitted to unit 19. If for example a motor does not reach the predetermined target speed indicated by the control and/or<br>
12<br><br>
regulating unit (19) due to overload, the current rotational speed is transmitted via bus 70 to the unit 19. The unit 19 reacts in that it further processes the rotational target speeds computed by the regulating computer (18) for all drives (30, 40,50, 60), and in particular reduces then in suitable manner, specifying them via b us 70 for these drives.<br>
If it is found, for example, that a motor is overloaded, the rotational target speeds of the motors 32,42, 52, 62 can be reduced accordingly so that a high fiber sliver quality is still obtained. If e.g. a relatively poor fiber sliver quality is registered, the machine can also b e operated at slower speed or the poor sliver quality is accepted for the sake of productivity at rotational speeds that are not or barely reduced.<br>
In this connection is possible to operate the machine with high or low dynamic. In the former case the current actual-values of the current master drive are taken into account, while in the second case, the rotational speeds are reduced beyond the currently necessary extent. In the latter case the overloaded drive is first taken into account, before the control and/or regulating unit (19) subsequently acts as virtual master and lowers the rotational target speeds to a given level valid for a long period of time and which is below the actually necessary extent regarding the momentary overload.<br>
Depending on the actual values it is also possible to provide for a complete shutting off of the machine.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 all drives (30, 40,50, 60) have a measuring device in form of the actual-value indicators 33, 43, 53, 63, in other designs only one or some drives are assigned measuring devices capable of transmitting actual values to the control and/or regulating unit (19). This can b e advantageously b e realized for such drives where the likelihood of strong deviations from normal operation is relatively great, so that the master functionality can be transferred to these drive if necessary.<br>
13<br><br>
Instead of or in addition to rotational motor speeds [e.g. measured by means of tachogenerators] or equivalent magnitudes, actual values can be used in addition to other measured values to distribute master functionality. Preferably the current consumption of one or several of the motors 32, 42, 52, 62 is measured by means of a suitable measuring element that may be integrated in the corresponding regulator 31, 41,51, 61. When the overload limit or a threshold limit of one of the motors 32,42,52,62 has been reached it can be used as a master.<br>
Instead of a bus 70 of suitable design (parallel or serial Bus, CAN Bus, Profibus, Interbus etc.) analog or digital single connections can also be used between the different measuring devices and the control and/or regulating unit 19. Such a situation is shown in Fig. 2. The calculation of the target rotational speeds based on the measured values of the sliver cross-section measuring device 5 by means of the regulating computer 18 as well as quality monitoring by means of the cross-section measuring device 12 remains unchanged relative to the embodiment of Fig. 1.<br>
The embodiment of Fig. 2 furthermore stands out in that measuring devices recording different measurements are assigned to each of the four drives 30, 40, 50, 60. Thus a temperature sensor 34 measures the motor temperature of motor 32 of the first drive 30 and transmits it - in analog or digital form - via a line 21 to the control and/or regulating unit 19. In an optional variant of the embodiment a limit value can be indicated below which no temperature values are transmitted to the unit 19. If the motor 32 becomes too hot for example, the unit 19 assigns the master function to drive 30 upon receiving this information and, while taking sliver cross-section fluctuations into account, prescribes new target speeds for all the drives 30, 40, 50, 60 which put less stress on the motor and allow its operating temperature to drop, possibly assigning the master function to another drive once normal conditions have been reestablished.<br>
14<br><br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 2 signals transmitted from the sliver cross-section measuring device 5 via line 22a to the unit 19 can furthermore be used to determine the current master If e.g. several important thick spots are recorded one after the other before the device such as cannot be evened out optimally in normal rapid operation of drafting equipment 2, a virtual master can cause the entire machine to run at a lower speed. This virtual master is preferably realized in this case in the central control and/or regulating unit 19.<br>
The pressure rod (9) in the embodiment of Fig. 2 is made in form of a known drafting force measuring element which transmits the applicable signals via a line 23 to the control and/or regulating unit (19). These signals can also be used for the assignment of the temporary master.<br>
In addition a measuring element 54 to measure the power consumption of the motor 52 of the third derive 50 is provided, capable e.g. of transmitting a pertinent signal in case of overload excess via line 24 to the control and/or regulating unit (19) which can then react by designating drive 50 as the master.<br>
Finally, in the embodiment according to Fig. 2, an actual-value indicator 63 measures the rotational speed of the engine 62 and transmits the pertinent actual values via a line 25 to the control and/or regulating unit (19), either continuously or when prescribed limit values or limit values that can be prescribed are not reached or are exceeded.<br>
Contrary to the embodiment of Fig. 1, no bus is provided for signal transmission to and from the control and/or regulating unit (19) in the embodiment of Fig. 2.<br>
In Fig. 2, in order to demonstrate the range of variations possible for circuitry, the actual values of the actual-value indicator 63 can be transmitted either via regulator 61 to the control and/or regulating unit (19) or alternatively or additionally via a direct line 26<br>
[indicated by broken line].<br>
15<br><br>
Also for illustration, the measuring devices 34, 5, 9, 54, 63 of the embodiment shown in Fig. 2 are selected so as to be different from each other. Some of the measuring devices are assigned to specific drives [measuring devices 34, 54, 63] while others [measuring devices 5, 9] are independent of them. It is absolutely possible to determine only the actual values in relation with one or two measuring values [see Fig. 1], e.g. merely power consumption by one or several of the motors. If merely one measuring device is provided for the purpose of an alternating assignment of the master functionality, its actual values can be used for temporary designation of a drive as master. When the actual values drop once more below a limit value, a drive pre-set in a standard manner or a virtual master can again assume the master function.<br>
It is generally advantageous in normal drafting equipment operation if a temporary abnormality or interference requires a change in master functionality through transmission of actual values representing this interference.<br>
Instead of a central control and/or regulating unit (19) such as provided in the embodiments of Figs. 1 and 2, \the function of this control and/or regulation can also be located in one of the drives 30, 40, 50, 60. Such a situation is shown in Fig. 3. According to this embodiment every regulator 131,141,151,161 of the drives 30, 40,50, 60 is designed as a control and/or regulating unit, preferably in form of a memory-programmable control [SPS]. The individual control and/or regulating units 131,141, 151, 161 are connected to each other via a bus system 170 and are preferably sable to carry out any task of control and/or regulation. Control and/or regulation are however transmitted normally to one of the control and/or regulating units 131,141,151,161. If the functionality of this control and/or regulation fails at the drive concerned, this function can be taken over advantageously by one of the other control and/or regulating units 131,141,151,161.<br>
16<br><br>
The measured values of the cross-section measuring device (5, 12 are in turn transmitted to the regulating computer (18). The regulating computer (18) is connected to the bus "170 and transmits the target values [rotational target speeds] for the drafting equipment drives 40 and/or 60 to the control and/or regulating unit 131, 141, 151 or 161 responsible for control and/or regulation which takes these target values into account according to the selected master in indicating the rotational target speeds for all drives.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 3 the appertaining control and/or regulating unit 131,141,151 or 161 can also assume the function of a temporary virtual master.<br>
With the different embodiments according to Figs. 1 to 3 it is possible that the tasks of the different control and/or regulating units 131, 141, 151, 161 are distributed among different units. Thus the actual values from the measuring device or devices can be transmitted to a first unit, the master can be designated in a second unit and the new target speeds for the different drives can be indicated by a third unit. Such a distribution of tasks falls within the scope of the invention wherever 'control and/or regulating unit" is mentioned above.<br>
The invention is not limited to the described embodiments. Different variants are possible. Thus for example, it is not necessary that all drives of the spinning machine be designed to assume the function of master. Also, the distribution of drives in Figs. 1 to 3 is merely an example. Different arrangements and/or a different number of drives are of course possible.<br>
The invention not only makes it possible to maintain the synchronicity of the drives. The peak performance and the performance reserve 3s of the axle drives can be lower, since a deceleration of the other axles can take place during the rarely to be expected peaks.<br>
17<br><br>
The invention can be used generally in a great variety of textile machines. In case of a draw frame it may also contain unregulated drafting equipment<br>
