				<td>The present invention relates to a media coating, a method of coating substrate with the media coating and the coated substrate and the invention generally relates to coating formulations for paper, fihn and other substrates which are receptive to conunon, aqueous ink jet inks and form images exhibiting superior quality when compared to uncoated paper, film and other printable substrates. More specifically, the present invention relates to cationic ally modified coatings which render the printed images water fast. The present invention also relates to methods of coating various printable substrates utilizing said coatings as well as materials coated with said coatings.<br>
The ink jet method of printing is a rapidly growing, commercially<br>
important printing process because of its ability to produce economical, high<br>
quality, muhi-colored prints. In fact, ink jet print methodology is becommg the<br>
print method of choice for producing colored hard copy of computer generated<br>
images consisting of graphics and fonts in both narrow and wide format. Ink jet<br>
printing is a non-impact and non-contact printing method in which an electronic<br>
signal controls and directs droplets or a stream of ink that can be deposited on a<br>
wide variety of substrates. Current ink jet printing technology involves forcing<br>
the ink drops through smalt nozzles by piezoelectric pressure, thermal ejection,<br>
or oscillation, and onto the surface of a material/media. Ink jet printing is<br>
extremely versatile in terms of the variety of substrate material that can be<br>
treated, as well as the print quality and the speed   	<br><br>
of operation that can be achieved.    In addition, ink jet printing is digitally controllable.<br>
For these reasons, ink jet printing methodology has been widely adopted for industrial marking and labeling. In addition, ink jet printing methodology has also found widespread use in architectural and engineering design applications, medical imaging, office printing (of both text and graphics), geographical imaging systems (e.g., for seismic data analysis and mapping), signage, in display graphics (e.g., photographic reproduction, business and courtroom graphics, graphic arts), and the like. Finally, ink jet printing has now also been used to create an image on a variety of textile substrates.<br>
Both dyes and pigments have been used as colorants for such ink jet ink formulations. However, such materials do not always adhere well to the substrates to which the ink is applied. For example, dyes may dissolve upon a printed substrate"s contact with water. Thus, images applied employing Inkjet printing methodology may tend to njn or smear upon repeated contact, or may be actually removed from the printed surface if exposed to substantial quantities of aqueous media (e.g., if an ink jet printed article is exposed to water or comes in contact with water through other means). There is therefore a need in the art for coatings which enhance the waterfastness capabilities of various substrates, in particular when aqueous based inks are to be employed on said substrates. It is to such need that the present invention is directed as the coatings of the present invention have proven partlculariy effective in improving waterfastness.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, media coatings for use on substrates for ink jet printing include a cationically modified clay, a cationically modified silica and a binder. Alternatively, the media coatings also include additional additives. In particular, in one embodiment of the invention, the media coatings also include a surfactant.     The  ratio  of  cationically  modified   day to  cationically<br><br>
modified silica varies in the coating formulation from about 1 % to about 99%. Desirably, the ratio of the cationically modified clay to cationically modified silica varies from about 10 % to about 50 %. More desirably, the ratio of cationically modified clay to cationically modified silica varies from about 25 % to about 35 %. The ratio of the total cationically modified clay and cationically modified silica to binder varies from about 20 % to about 80 %. Desirably, the ratio of the total cationically modified clay and cationically modified silica to binder varies from about 65% to about 75%.<br>
These  and   other  features  and   advantages  of the   present invention will become apparent after a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments and the appended claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there are waterfast ink receptive coatings for Ink jet printing including a cationically modified clay and a cationically modified silica. These formulations use a blend of cationic clay and cationic silica in combination with binder(5), and optionally surfactants and other additives, to deliver superior image quality and waterfastness.<br>
The coating formulations may be used with paper, film, scrim and other printable substrates which are receptive to common, aqueous ink jet inks and form images exhibiting superior quality to uncoated paper, film or other substrates or to substrates which have merely been coated with either cationically modified clay, or cationically modified silica. Preferred substrates for use with the coating include films known as synthetic papers such as those available from the Oji Yuka Synthetic Paper Corporation and marketed by Kimberly-Clari<: under the designation kimdura such substrates are preferred for purposes of waterfastness since they do not appear to swell or cockle. in particular synthetic paper having a thickness microns may be easily used. other materials as those></:><br>
having thicknesses of between approximately 60 and approximately 500 microns also may be readily used. It is important that such substrates be able to easily feed through an ink jet printer.<br>
Other films which may be coated writh the coating of the present invention include polyester and vinyl films. Other substrates which may be coated with the coating of the present invention include latex saturated paper substrates. Further, such coatings may also be applied to nonwoven substrates, such as those made from polyolefins as well as woven substrates.<br>
Printed images on the ink jet media coating are rendered waterfast, resisting deterioration of the image upon repeated exposure to water. This quality may be developed within hours or minutes from the compietion of printing. Exposure to water may be accomplished by placing the printed sample under dripping or running water, or even submersion in water for a limited period of time.<br>
As previously stated, the coating formulation in ihe present invention utilizes a combination of both a cationically modified clay and a cationically modified silica. An example of such a cationically modified day may be obtained from ECC International of Atlanta, Georgia under the designation Astra-Jet™. The cationically modified clay consists of an aqueous dispersion of Kaolin and a polyquartenary amine. While, ECCl markets a line of Astra-Jet™ clays, the original clay composition is desirable for the purpose of the coating of the present invention.<br>
The cationically modified silica may consist of an aqueous silica dispersion including a cationic polymer similar to that described above. Alternatively, the cationic silica may consist of an aqueous amorphous silica stabilized with alumina and other additives, such as the cationic silica gel dispersion sold by Grace Davison of Columbia, Maryland under the designation Cationic Sylojet P612, with a cationic surface<br><br>
modifier. An unmodified silica is available from Grace Davison under the designation SylojetP612.<br>
The ratio of cationlcally modified clay to cationically modified silica may vary in the coating formulation from about 1 % up to about 99 % by weight. Desirably, the ratio of the cationically modified clay to cationically modified silica may vary from about 10 % to about 50 % by weight. More desirably, the ratio of cationicalty modified clay to cationically modified silica may vary from about 25 % up to 35 % by weight.<br>
The formulation further includes a binder. Such a binder serves to both bind the clay and silica together (pigment particies). and also to bind the coating to a media substrate. The binder may be comprised of any film forming, water insoluble polymer, providing the polymer is compatible with the cationic clay and silica. Binders which are suitable for the formulation include, but are not limited to nonionic latexes composed of polymers of vinyl acetate, ethylene vinyl acetate, acrylates, and acrylate-vinyl acetate. Other polymer materials which are suitable as binders include styrenics such as styrene rubbers (SBR), styrene maleic anhydride (SMA), and styrene acrylonitrile (SAN). Cationic latexes may also be employed as a suitable binder. Further, mildly anionic latexes may also be used as a binder. Strongly anionic latexes would be unacceptable binders however, as they would coagulate with the other cationic materials. The ratio of the total pigment, that is the combination of cationically modified clay and cationically modified silica, to the coating binder may vary from about 20 % up to about 80 %. Desirably, the ratio of the total pigment to the coating binder may vary from about 65 % to about 75 %.<br>
In addition to the clay, silica and binder, optional additives may be added to improve the performance of the coatings.   For instance, UV absorbers/light stabilizers may be added to improve light fastness. Additionally, surfactants or wetting agents may be added as well. Desirably, if such surfactants are utilized they are nonionic, cationic or<br><br>
zwitterionic. Examples include Triton XI00 and Tergitol both from Union Carbide. Further, a leveling agent such as an aliphatic diol may be used as well. Other optional additives include flow modifiers, and optical whiteners and/or brighteners.<br>
The present invention is further described by the examples which follow. Such examples, however, are not to be construed as limiting in any way either the spirit or the scope of the present invention. Unless stated otherwise, all percents are percents by weight. An example of a coating formulation of the present invention, for use on a variety of media substrates is expressed in Table 1. An example of a control coating formulation, without a cationicaily modified silica, is described in Table 2. The particle size of the following Sylojet P612 silica materials is approximately 12 microns. The clay and silica are present in aqueous dispersions.<br>

Drawdown<br>
Generally,   for  each   of  the   coatings  of  the  examples,   the components were combined in the order shown using a plastic beaker<br><br>
and a paddie-type mixer. Draw downs using the Meyer Rod method (as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art) were made with a # 28-30 meyer rod on Kimdura® FPG 150 ( for 150 micron) available from Kimberly-Clark, to yield a coat weight of between approximately 5.5 to 6.0 lbs/1300 sq. ft. (20 gsm to 23 gsm). The coated sample sheets of 10 by 12 inch size were then cut to 8.5 by 11 inch size to facilitate printing and testing.<br>
The specific drawdown procedure employed is described as follows. A 10 X 12 inch sheet of paper or film (e.g. Kimdura® FPG 150) was placed on a flat surface. A wire-wound (Meyer) rod was placed on top of the sheet and 2kg weights were placed on the ends of the rod to prevent slipping. The coating was poured on the substrate such that it contacted the rod and formed a narrow pool the width of the substrate. The substrate was drawn under the rod and the coating was spread evenly along the length of tiie sheet. It should be recognized that different coat weights may be obtained by utiliang rods wound with different size wires.<br>
Alternatively coatings may be applied to substrates via other coating methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as the Air Knife method or the Slot Dye method. Other coating methods include the gravure roll, and reverse roll coating methods. Coatings may be applied at levels from about 5 to about 45 grams per square meter (gsm). Desirably, the coatings are applied at between about 15 to about 35 gsm. The samples were then placed in a conventional forced air oven at approximately 75° C for about 3-5 minutes to allow to dry. The samples were stored in ambient room conditions (20-25° C) overnight prior to printing.<br>
The dried samples were then printed with the indicated printers and settings as shown in Tables 3-5 which follow.<br><br>
Printinfl<br>
Color blocks of the colors Cyan (C), Magenta (M), Yellow (Y), Black (K), Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B) were printed from Microsoft ® MS Paint block pattern in a 2 x 5 inch pattern on the Kimdura® sheets. The color blocks were printed with inks provided with each printer. A white (unprinted) block was also included in the 2 X 5 inch pattern. The printers used included a Hewlett-Packard 722C on HP Premium Ink Jet Paper/Best Settings, an Epson 850 on Photo Quality Ink Jet Paper/720dpi/Automatic Settings and a Canon 4200 printer on Hi Resolution Paper/Standard/No Color Matching Settings. Followring printing, samples were dried ovemight under ambient conditions before further testing. Following printing and drying, the samples were cut out into their respective 2x5 inch blod
Soak Testing<br>
The cut out 2 X 5 Inch samples were placed in a 2 liter plastic beaker containing 2 liters deionized water at 20°C for 24 hours. Samples were clamped to the side of the container such that the entire test pattern remained submerged for the duration of the test.    After this period had elapsed, samples were removed and placed flat on a KimWipes® wiper. KimWipes are wipers available from the Kimberly-Clark Corporation. The surfaces of the samples were gently dried with a KimWipe® wiper. The samples were allowed to dry completely before spectral measurements were taken (minimally 2-3 hours). An X-Rite® Model 938 Spectrodensitometer was used to perform L"a"b* spectral measurements, the CIE LAB measurement being one known to one of ordinary skill in the art.   The X-Rite spectrodensitometer was obtained from the X-Rite corporation of Grandville, Michigan.    In performing the measurements, the illuminant type was a D50 and tine observer being 2°.<br><br>
The degree of optical lightening resulting from exposure to water was measured quantitatively using L"a*b* values.   Delta E* is calculated in accordance with the following equation: AE"= SQRT [(L*standard - L* sample)^ + (a*standard - a* sample)^ + (b*standard - b" sample)^],<br>
where the standard is representative of the value for the sample that has not been soaked.<br>
The higher the Delta E* (hereinafter AE*), the greater the change in color intensity. A large increase in delta E" would typically be indicative of fading, washout or bleed of dye. In running the L*a*b* test on the samples, controls of each coating were used as a basis for comparison. The control samples (STD) were just printed with the respective fomiulations, as opposed to being printed and soaked. More extensive bleeding of the dyes was observed when the unmodified silica was utilized in the tested samples, i.e. Formulation "C".<br>

From the data it can be seen that use of a coating including both a cationically charged clay and cationicaliy charged silica (Coating A) enhances waterfastness of an Ink jet printed image on a coated substrate, as measured by a spectrodensitometer. For instance, in observing data from the Epson 850 printer, the red AE* values for the control (Coating C) compared with the cationic clay/silica combination (Coating A) demonstrates a significant difference in light fastness.<br><br>
