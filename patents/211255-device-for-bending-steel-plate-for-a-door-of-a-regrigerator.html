				<td>DEVICE FOR BENDING STEEL PLATE FOR A DOOR OF A REFRIGERATOR<br>
(1)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a device for bending steel plate for a door of a refrigerator, and more particularly to a device for bending ateel plate for a door of a refrigerator which can easily change the bending angle by selectively sticking a plurality of metals with different inclination angles fast to a roller and then bending the ateel plate.<br>
(2)	Discussion of Related Art<br>
In general, a door of a refrigerator ie comprised of a steel plate, an inner case and an insulating material filling therebetween. Both ends of the steel plate is bent to inside and the inner case is combined to the end part of the steel plate.<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagram showing a conventional bending device for bending the both ends of a steel plate. Ae shown in Fig. 3, a door steel plate 1 is provided bet%*e*n a clamp 2 and a roller 3 to be pressed and bent. A slope 2a which ie inclined by a predetermined angle is formed at one side of the clamp 2 facing the roller 3 to make the door steel plate 1 be bent along the slope 2a. The door steel plate 1 inserted between the clamp 2 and the rcller 3 is bent along the slope 2a at the rotation of the roller 3.<br>
However, such a conventional bending device has a problem that it is difficult to change the bending angle of the door steel plate because the clamp must be replaced to change the<br>
bending angle.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a device for bending steel plate for a door of a refrigerator that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the preaent invention is to provide a device for bending steel plate for a door of a refrigerator which can easily change the bending angle of the steel plate.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings .<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described, a device for bending steel plate for a door of a refrigerator having a roller and metals placed to be close to the roller to make the door steel plate placed therebetween be bent, is characterized in that there are provided a plurality of metals, slopes with different inclination angles are formed at the sides of the metals facing the roller, and an approaching unit for selectively approaching a plurality of metals to the roller is provided to selectively control the bending angle of the ateel plate.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ATTACHED DRAWING<br>
The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of thia specification, illustrate embodinents of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the invention:<br>
In the drawings:<br>
Pig. 1 shows a door steel plate bent by a bending device of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a device for bending Steel plate for a door of a refrigerator according to the present invention; and<br>
Pig. 3 illustrates a conventional device for bending steel plate for a door of a refrigerator.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTON OF PREFERED _EMBODIMENT<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 depicts a steel plate for a door of a refrigerator both €:nds of which are bent by a bending device of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 1, the door comprises a steel plate 10 both ends of which are bent, an inner caae (not shown) the both Sides of which are combined to the bending parts of the<br>
steel plate 10, and an insulating material (not shown) filled between the steel plate 10 and the inner case.<br>
The both ends of the steel plate 10 are bent to be obtuse-angled and then are bent by 90° three times. The present invention relates to a device for bending both ends of the door steel plate 10 to be obtuse-angled. Fig. 2 illustrates the bending device according to the present invention. As shown in Fig. 2, the door steel plate bending device comprises four metals<br>
21,	22, 23, 24 having slopes with different inclination angles<br>
at the outer sides thereof, a roller 30 placed to be rotatable<br>
at the outline of the metal of the metals 21, 22, 23, 24 which<br>
is placed at the upper side and an approaching unit for<br>
approaching one of the metals 21, 22, 23, 24 to the roller 30.<br>
Four metals 21, 22, 23, 24 are arranged to be concentric and a connecting member 40 having outer aides diverged from a center to be connected to the metals 21, 22, 23, 24. respectively is placed at the center thereof. The approaching unit has a motor 50 combined to the center of the connecting member 40 by interposing a rotary axis therebetween. That is, the motor 50 rotates the metals 21, 22, 23, 24 through the connecting member 40 and changes the metals to be close to the roller, thus adjusting the bending angle. Slopes 20a which are inclined by different angles are formed at the outer sides of the metals 21,<br>
22,	23, 24.<br>
A cylinder 60 wherein an operating axis 61 rises and falls<br>
 is prcvided at a lower portion of the connecting member 40.The<br>
upper portion of the operating axis 61 is combined to the<br>
connecting member 40 to lift and drop the metals 21, 22, 23, 24,<br>
thereby enabling the bent steel plate 10 to be separated from the roller and the metals.<br>
The operation of the bending device of the present invention as described above will be discuased hereinbelow.<br>
The end part of the door steel plate 10 is placed between the roller 30 and one of the metals 21, 22, 23, 24 and the cylinder 60 is operated to press the meta1 to the roller 30. Thereafter, the roller 30 rotates along the outer side of the metal, and thus the and part of the door steel plate 10 ie bent along the slope of the metal.<br>
in order to change the bending angle, the motor 50 is rotated by 90o, 180o or 270°, thus approaching the metals 21, 22, 23, 24 with different inclination angle to the roller 30.<br>
As described above, the device for bending the steel plate for a door of a refrigerator according to the present invention has an advantage of eaaily changing the bending angle of the door steel plate by rotating the metals by using a motor.<br><br><br><br>
What is claimed is:<br>
1. A device for bending steel plate for a door of a refrigerator having a roller and metals placed to be close to aaid roller to make the steel plate placed therebetween be bent, characterized in that there are provided a plurality of metals, slopes with different inclination angles are formed at the aides of said plurality of metals facing said roller, and approaching means for selectively approaching said plurality of metale to said roller is provided to selectively adjust the bending angle of said steel plate.<br>
2	.   The device for bending steel plate for a door of a<br>
refrigerator as claimed in claim 1, wherein aaid plurality of<br>
metals are arranged to be concentric and said approaching means<br>
has a connecting member diverged from the center of said<br>
plurality of metals and combined to said plurality of metals and<br>
a motor combined to the center of said connecting member.<br>
3	.  The device for bending steel plate for a door of a<br>
refrigerator as claimed in claim 2, further comprising a cylinder<br>
combined to one side of said connecting member by interposing an<br>
operating axis therebetween, thereby separating said metals from<br>
said roller.<br>
A device for bending steel plate for a door of a refrigerator   as claimed in any of the preceding claims substantially as herein described with reference to the foregoing description and the accompanying drawings.<br><br><br></td>
