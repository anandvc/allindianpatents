SILICA BASED MATERIAL<br>
The invention relates to an oregano-modified silica based material and a method of preparing an oregano-modified silica based material. It also relates to the use of the oregano-modified silica based material for preparing a stationary phase separation material, a method of preparing a stationary phase separation material, a stationary phase separation material, and the use of the stationary phase separation material in chromatography separation methods.<br>
Introduction<br>
Chromatographic stationary phase separation materials used in liquid chromatography are commonly based on a porous carrier of silica onto which a fictionalization has been made in order to achieve the desired separation characteristics for a certain analyze to be separated. Common types of fictionalization are the preparation of hydrophobic stationary phases, e.g. a C18-phase, in which usually octadecylsilane is used as a functionalizing agent and reacted with solenoid groups of porous silica. However, it is difficult to have all silanoi groups reacting with the functionalising agent, mainly due to steric hindrance. Remaining silanoi groups make the material very susceptible to hydrolysis, due to their polar nature. Therefore, end-capping of remaining silanoi groups with, e.g. trimethyichlorosilane, is usually made. However, stationary phase separation materials based on silica, such as a conventional end-capped C18-phase, are still chemically rather unstable at high pH due to still remaining silanoi groups, as well as to the fact that the end-capped silanoi groups are still susceptible to hydrolysis.<br>
The retention time and also capacity, the maximum amount of analyte applied without introducing competitive interaction, for a certain analyte depend on the actual surface coverage of the functionalisation. Moreover, the optimum surface coverage is a function of both the analyte and the actual surface functionalisation. The surface coverage obtained under normally applied procedures, which is a surface bonding on bare, fully rehydroxylated silica, is typically higher than optimum for all analytes.<br>
A lowering of the surface coverage of functional groups on silica has according to one method according to the state of the art been achieved by, instead of using an excess, using a deficit of the functionalising agent, e.g. an organosilane. However, when using a deficit of functionalising agent the level of surface coverage is difficult to reproduce, due to, e.g., remaining moisture and exact determination of the chemically available surface. Also, hydrophobic organosilane molecules often tend to form clusters, which lead to "island" formation and thus an uneven distribution of the organosilane on<br><br>
the silica surface. Furthermore, when using a deficit of the organosilane used for modification there will be remaining silanol groups present which are usually blocked with an end-capping agent such as a lower alkyl organo silane, e.g. trimethyichlorosilane. However, as already described, end-capped silanol groups are still susceptible to hydrolysis which means that the chemical stability will be even lower than, e.g., conventional C18-phases at extreme pH-values (10). Also, end-capping is difficult to make complete which means that there will usually be remaining silanol groups present which are very susceptible to hydrolysis. Remaining silanol groups also interact unfavourably with analytes, especially basic analytes.<br>
Alternatively, a lowering of the surface coverage of functional groups on silica can be made by end-capping some of the silanol groups prior to functionalisation as described in Marshall at a/., J. of Chrom., 361 (1986) 71-92. Also in this case, there are problems with an even lower chemical stability than conventional C18-phases due to the increased number of end-capped silanol groups.<br>
Several attempts have been made to provide stationary phase separation materials which are chemically stable. US 4,017,526 A discloses preparation of a porous silicon dioxide bearing organic groups which are part both of the skeleton structure and the surface. US 6,686,035 B2 discloses a porous inorganic/organic hybrid material particle comprising a polyorganoalkoxysiloxane through the whole particle. However, both these types of hybrid particles are much less mechanically stable than pure silica particles. US 2005/0191503 A1 discloses a method of preparing a chemically stable separation material wherein a polycarbosilane layer is covalently bonded to a silica surface. US 3,722,161 A discloses a polymeric stationary phase chemically bonded to a substrate of silica.<br>
There is a need for chemically stable silica based stationary phase separation materials which are mechanically stable.<br>
There is, furthermore, a need for a method of reducing the number of remaining silanol groups on a silica surface of a stationary phase separation material after functionalisation in order to increase the chemical stability of the stationary phase separation material and minimise unfavourable interaction with analytes.<br>
There is also a need for a method of reducing the surface coverage of functional groups in a controlled way having high reproducibility.<br>
There is also a need for a silica based stationary phase separation material wherein the number of remaining silanol groups on the silica surface is low, thereby increasing the stability of the stationary phase separation material and minimising unfavourable interaction with analytes.<br><br>
There is also a need for a chemically stable silica based stationary phase material, which preserves all the performance benefits of bare silica functionalised with organosilanes, i.e., a common silica based functionalised stationary phase separation material.<br>
There is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a silica based material which has high chemical and mechanical stability and onto which functionalisation can be made in a controlled way. There is also an object of the present invention to provide a stationary phase separation material for chromatography which has high chemical and mechanical stability, and which has high loadability. There is also an objective of the present invention to provide a stationary phase separation material which has all the performance benefits of state of the art surface functionalised silica based on pure silica at the same time the chemical stability is higher.<br>

A silicon atom having four -OSi= groups attached to the silicon is said to have a<br>
&gt;    Q4 structure (Fig. 2). Pure silica GQmprises essentially Q4 silicons. A silicon atom having<br>
one hydroxy! group attached and also three -OSi= groups attached to the silicon is said<br><br>
to have a QS structure (Fig. 3). Q4 and Q3 structures can be analysed by solid state silicon NMR spectroscopy.<br>
The organo-modified silica based material and the stationary phase separation material suitably comprise silicon atoms having a 04 structure.<br>
The surface of the organo-modified silica based material suitably comprises silicon atoms, being part of the silica based material, which do not have any organic groups bonded to them.<br>
The ratio of the amount of Q3 after complete functionaiisation and/or endcapping of silanol groups of the organo-modified silica based material to the amount of Q3 before functionaiisation and/or endcapping of the organo-modified silica based material is suitably from about 0.01 to about 0.99, preferably from about 0.10 to about 0.95, most preferably from about 0.25 to about 090.<br>
The pore size of the stationary phase separation material is suitably from about 20 to about 100% of the pore size of the silica based material (S), preferably from about 30 to about 95%, most preferably from about 40 to about 90%.<br>
The pore volume of the stationary phase separation material is suitably from about 0.1 to about 4 ml/g, preferably from about 0.2 to about 2 mi/g, most preferably from about 0.3 to about 1.2 ml/g.<br>

The specific surface area (BET method) normally decreases when a material is being functionalised. Thus, a functionalised organo-modified silica based material normally has a lower specific surface area (BET method) than the organo-modified siliica based material itself.<br>
The organo-modified silica based material and the stationary phase separation material have suitably a mechanical strength which is about equal to the silica based material (S).<br>
The stability of the organo-modified silica based material and the stationary phase separation material in alkaline environments can be measured by packing the material in a column, pumping an alkaline solution through the column and determining the silicon content in the eluate (by elemental analysis). The alkaline stability of the organo-modified silica based material and the stationary phase separation material, preferably having a C18-, C8- or C4 functionaiisation, determined as ppm silicon per specific surface area (BET method) [ppm Si/ m2/g] in the eluate from the procedure of pumping 41.5 mL of 10 mM NaOH mixed with ethanol in a 1:1 volume relation, at 1 mL/min, at a temperature of 25"C, through a column of 215 mm length and 4.6 mm inner diameter packed with about 2.5 g of the organo-modified silica based material, is suitably<br><br>
less than about 0.035 [ppm Si/ m2/g], or from about 0 to about 0.035 [ppm Si/ m2/g], preferably less than about 0.025 [ppm SI/ m2/g], or from about 0 to about 0.025 [ppm Si/ m2/g]. The alkaline stability of the organo-modified silica based material and the stationary phase separation material, preferably having a C18-, C8- or C4 functionalisation, determined as ppm silicon per specific surface area (BET method) [ppm Si/ m2/g] in the eluate from the procedure of pumping 41.5 mL of 100 mM NaOH mixed with ethanol in a 1:1 volume relation, at 1 mL/min, at a temperature of 25°C, through a column of 215 mm length and 4.6 mm inner diameter packed with about 2.5 g of the organo-modified silica based material, is suitably less than about 0.2 [ppm Si/ m2/g], or from about 0 to about 0.2 [ppm Si/ m2/g], preferably less than about 0.15 [ppm Si/ m2/g], or from about 0 to about 0.15 [ppm Si/ m2/g].<br>
The method of preparing a stationary phase separation material comprises surface-functionalisation of the organo-modified silica based material according to the present invention by reacting the organo-modified silica based material with one or more functionalising agents comprising a functional group, such as diof-substituted alkyl, amino-substituted alkyl, cyanoalkyl, fluoroalkyl, phenyl, fiuorophenyl, phenylalkyl, or Ci-C30 alkyl, preferably C4-, Cr. and C-|8 alkyl. Suitably, the functionalising agent is an organosilane comprising the functional group. Surface-functionalisation of silica is a well-known procedure and details about suitable procedures are described in, for example, Silica Gel and Bonded Phases - Their Production, Properties and Use in LC. Raymond P.W. Scott., John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., 1993, England, UK, p. 159-160. The surface-functionalisation is suitably made in a non-aqueous medium, e.g., toluene.<br>
After reacting the organo-modified silica based material with the functionalising agent a step of end-capping is preferably made. As end-capping agent trimethylchlorosilane or dimethyldichlorosilane is preferably used.<br>
The present invention further comprises the use of the stationary phase separation material in chromatographic separation methods. Such chromatographic separation methods can be, for example, HPLC, supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), and simulating moving bed (SMB).<br>
The present invention also relates to a packed separation column for chromatography comprising the stationary phase separation material of the present invention.<br>
The present invention also relates to the preparation of a packed column for chromatography comprising a step of packing the stationary phase separation material according to the present invention in a column.<br><br>
The present invention further comprises a method of separating chemical compounds from a mixture comprising contacting the mixture with the stationary phase separation material according to the present invention.<br>
The present invention will now be described in the following examples, which, however, should not be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1 (Preparation of an oroano-modified silica based material):<br>
21.50 mL methyltrimethoxysilane was added to 300 ml_ Milli-Q-water at room temperature. 30.00 g silica particles (Kromasil®), having an average particle size of 5 urn, an average pore size of 120 A and a specific surface area of 320 m2/g was added and the mixture was heated to 956C. The temperature was kept for 3 h. The temperature was thereafter lowered to 80°C whereby 21 mL 25% NH^ was added. The temperature was kept for 2 h. Thereafter, the temperature was lowered to room temperature and 21 mL 65% HN03(aq) was added. The mixture was heated to 95°C and this temperature was kept for 88 h after which the mixture was filtered and washed with Milli-Q-water, THF and acetone. The material was finally dried at 90°C for 4 h.<br>
The carbon content was measured by elemental analysis to 3.9 weight %.<br>
Example 2 (Preparation of an oraano-modified silica based material):<br>
40.5 mL (33-36) ethyltrimethoxysiiane was added to 500 mL Milli-Q-water having 50 g silica particles (Kromasil® 100A), having an average particle size of 5 um, an average pore size of 120 A and a specific surface area of 320 m2/g. The mixture was heated to 98°C and the temperature was kept for 16 h. The temperature was cooled to below 40°C, filtered and washed with Milli-Q-water and acetone. The material was dried at90°Cfor4h.<br>
The carbon content was measured by elemental analysts to 7.1 weight %.<br>
Example 3 (Preparation of an oroano-modified silica based material):<br>
The product of Example 2 was dispersed in Milli-Q-water and the mixture was<br>
put in an autoclave. The temperature was raised to 130°C and kept for 72 hours. The<br>
temperature was then cooled to below 40"C, filtered and washed with Milli-Q-water and<br>
acetone. The material was dried at 90°C for 4 h.<br>
The carbon content was measured by elemental analysis to 7.1 weight %.<br><br>
Example 4 (Preparation of stationary phase separation material):<br>
The organo-modified silica based materials prepared according to Example 1 was subjected to functionalisation into a C18-phase using dimethyl-octadecylchlorosilane employing standard procedures (i.e.using an amino-based catalyst in toluene). After functionalisation, the resulting phase was was endcapped using trimethylchlorosilane.<br>
The carbon content from the C18-functionality was determined to 8.6 weight %.<br>
Example 5 (Preparation of stationary phase separation material):<br>
The organo-modified silica based materials prepared according to Example 3 was functionalised in the same way as described in Example 4.<br>
The carbon content from the C184unctionality was determined to 7.3 weight %.<br>
Examples 6-14 (Preparation of organo-modified silica based materials):<br>
Further organo-modified silica based materials were made according to Example<br>
2 and Example 3, using between 30 and 40 mL or organosilanes, and the same amounts<br>
of other components. As organosilanes were used methyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
methyltriethoxysilane,	ethyltrimethoxysilane,        propyltrimethoxy-silane,	and<br>
bis(triethoxysilyl) ethane. The resulting materials were in some cases subjected to a C18-functionalisation in the same manner as described in Example 4. The C18 functionalising agent was either dimethyl-octadecylchlorosilane ("C18") or methyl-octadecyldichlorosilane ("di-C18"). Table 1 summarises the components used, their i    amount and if the autoclavation step according to Example 3 has been used or not.<br><br><br>
Example 15 (Chemical stability test of the stationary phase separation material):<br>
Columns having a size of 250*4.6 mm were packed with about 2.5 g of the stationary phase separation materials prepared according to Examples 4 and 6. As a reference another column was packed with a conventional C18 phase (Kromasil 100-5-C18) which comprises C18-functionalised silica particles.<br>
In a HPLC equipment acetonitrile/50 mM HOAc-NEfc 50:50 was used as a mobile phase. The pH was 12. The flow rate was 1 mL/min during analysis and 0.1 mL/min inbetween. The temperature was 25°C. The analytes toluene, nortriptyline, imipramine and amitriptyline were tested at regular intervals.<br>
The capacity factor, k\ which is a measurement of the relative retention behaviour was determined for all analytes.<br>
Tables 2 to 4 show the results. AkVAt is the change of k' over the latest 40 minutes.<br><br>
For the conventional C18 phase, the results show that for toluene, which only interacts significantly with the hydrophobic C18 functionality, there is no deterioration of<br><br>
the C18 functionality over time. However, the results for the other analytes, which also interact with hydrophilic structures such as silanol groups, show that there is an increased interaction over time which indicates a deterioration process at the silica surface. For the C18 phases according to the present invention, the C18 functionality is deteriorating to a much lesser degree than for a conventional C18-phase. Thus, the chemical stability of a C18 phase according to the present invention is significant higher than for a conventional C18 phase.<br>
Example 16 (Chemical stability test of the stationary phase separation material):<br>
Columns having a size of 250*4.6 mm were each packed with about 2.5 g of the stationary phase separation material prepared according to Examples 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 15. As a reference a column was packed with a conventional C18 phase (Kromasil 100-5-C18) which comprises C18-functionalised silica particles.<br>
in a HPLC equipment the analytes nortriptyline and amitriptyline were tested using a 25 mM K-P04-buffer (pH 6)/methanol 50:50 as a mobile phase. The flow rate was 1 mL/min and the temperature was 25°C. The capacity factor, k', which is a measurement of the relative retention behaviour was determined for each analyte.<br>
The column was thereafter subjected to 0.1 M NaOH (aq)/ethanol 50:50 for five hours. After equilibration of the column, the capacity factors were determined again for the analytes using the same conditions as before.<br>
The change in capacity factor is illustrated in table 5.<br><br><br>
It is concluded that the materials according to the present invention give better results in terms of stability of capacity factor in alkaline conditions than a conventional C18-phase.<br>
Example 17 (Chemical stability of the stationary phase separation material as leakage of silicon):<br>
2.5 g each of three batches of stationary phase separation materials all made according to combined Examples 2 and 3 (ethyl-modified, autoclave treated) and functionalised with methyl-octadecyldichlorosilane, according to the procedure in Example 4, were each packed in three columns of 215 mm length and 4.6 mm inner diameter. The specific surface area of the materials were each about 140 m2/g. 41.5 mL of 10 mM NaOH mixed with ethanol in a 1:1 volume relation was pumped at 1 mL/min, at a temperature of 25°C, through each column. The silicon content was determined in the eluates by elemental analysis. A column packed with a conventional C-18 modified stationary phase was also provided. The procedure was repeated by pumping 10 mM NaOH:ethanol in a 1:1 volume relation and 100 mM NaOH:ethanol in a 1:1 volume relation through fresh columns respectively. Table 6 shows the results.<br><br>
It is concluded that the material of the present invention exhibits a much higher stability to strong alkaline solutions than a conventional C18-phase. The stability is also reproducible between different batches.<br>
Example 18 (Mechanical stability of the stationary phase separation material):<br>
The mechanical stability of porous silica particles is measured by packing about 25 mm of silica particles in a column having an inner diameter of 50 mm, using a<br><br>
pressure of 40 bar. A mobile phase is pumped through the column and the back-pressure which is needed to be exceeded in order to move the mobile phase through the column is determined. The silica particles are thereafter subjected to a pressure of 60, 60,100, 120, 150, 200, 250, and 300 bar, wherein the back-pressure is measured at each piston pressure. The pressure increase [%] to 40 bar, at each piston pressure, is determined.<br>
The mechanical stability of an organo-modified silica based material prepared according to Example 3 (ethyl-modified) was determined by the method described. As comparison, a conventional material (Kromasil C4) being C4-functionalised on (pure) bare silica was tested.<br>
The results are shown in table 7.<br><br>
It is concluded that an organo-modified silica based material of the present invention has excellent mechanical stability.<br>
Example 19 (Control of functionalisation degree):<br>
Organo-modified silica based materials were prepared according to the method of combined Examples 2 and 3, varying the amount of organosilane (ethyltrimethoxy silane). A C18-functionalisation was then following the procedure in Example 4. Remaining silanols were endcapped with trimethoxy silane. The carbon contents in the organo-modified silica based materials and in the C18-functionalised phases were determined. The relation is shown in Fig. 4.<br>
It is concluded that there is a clear relation between the carbon content in a organo-modified silica based material and the carbon content in the same material as functionalised. The relation is shown in Fig. 4. This relation makes it possible to effectively control the functionalisation degree.<br><br><br><br><br>
