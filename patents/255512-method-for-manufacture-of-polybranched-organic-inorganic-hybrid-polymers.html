Method for the manufacture of polybranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers<br>
The present invention concerns the manufacture of polybranched organic, inorganic hybrid polymers as defined by the preamble of claim 1. According to another aspect the invention concerns a modification of the result of a sol gel process based on at least partially hydrolysed amino silanes manufactured by controlled hydrolysis and condensation of a silane as defined by the preamble of claim 11. According to yet another aspect the invention concerns such polybranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers as mentioned above. Finally the invention concerns use of such polybranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers.<br>
Background<br>
Polymer materials are utilized in an increasing number of categories of products, such as components for cars, boats, airplanes, within the electronics industry and other advanced industry as well as in paints and other coatings, for special packaging etc. The uses of polymer materials in new categories of products are only limited by the product properties. It is thus a continuous need for development of polymer products with improved properties e.g. with respect to increased scratch resistance, improved weather resistance, increased UV resistance, increased chemical resistance and improved properties with respect to antioxidation, anticorrosion etc.<br>
In addition to pure polymer materials there has also been developed products based on materials that may be described as hybrids between inorganic and organic materials, which means that these materials are macro molecules that may have an inorganic core and organic branches.<br>
Organic polymer molecules with branched structures have an enormous economical growth potential, particularly as components in new materials. So-called dendrimers are important examples of such polymer molecules with a perfectly branched structure as well as hyperbranched polymers with statistically progressive branching. Both dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers are denoted dendritic polymers. Dendritic (from Greec: "dendron" = tree) characterizes the principle of a progressive branching that is more or less perfect (G.R. Newkome, C.N. Moorefield, F. Vfigtle, "Dendrimers and Dendrons: Concepts, Syntheses, Applications", Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, (2001)). Formula 1 illustrates the principle difference between linear polymers and dendritic polymers (hyperbranched polymers and dendrimers).<br><br><br><br>
K = germ (the beginning of the polymer	D = dendritic branching<br>
molecule)	T - termination (the end of the polymer<br>
L = linear propagation	molecule)<br>
Formula 1<br>
Dendritic polymers are particularly interesting because the 17 units may carry functional groups and the density of available functional groups per weight or volume unit of the polymer is much higher than what is the case for linear polymers. Functional T groups may be used to impart a function in a material, like an antioxidant, a UV absorber, or a radical scavenger as described in WO publication No. 02092668.<br>
Alternatively the T groups may be used as very efficient cross-linkers of organic materials like epoxy resins or polyurethanes or as cross-linkers for thermoplastics. Due to the high degree of cross-linking between dendritic polymers and such organic compounds the dendritic polymers are superior cross-linkers compared to conventional cross-linkers like polyamines, polyalcohols, or multifunctional aciylates. Higher degree of cross-linking of an organic material like a cross-linked thermoplastic improves properties such as chemical resistance, weather resistance and wears resistance and makes the material useful for applications at higher temperature, (Hans Zweifel (ed,), Plastics Additives Handbook, Carl Hanser Yerlag, Miinchen, (2001), 725-811). The T groups may also be used to organize the dendritic polymers in a network. As component in a material the dendritic polymer thus may induce improved barrier properties. Alternatively such dendritic polymers may be used as a binder or as a component in a thexmoset plastic.<br><br>
Dendrimers are usually manufactured in relatively complicated and expensive synthesis comprising several steps. The process conditions must be maintained very accurately in order to achieve a perfect progressive branch structure. Their industrial applications are therefore limited.<br>
A general way of manufacture of hyper branched polymers was early described by Flory (P. J.. Flory, Principles of Polymer Chemistry, Cornell University, (1953)). The polymerization of an AB2 monomer where A may react with B but where the reactions "between A and A and between B and B are precluded, leads to a hyperbranched polymer.<br>
Another way of manufacturing hyperbranched polymers involves the utilization of a reactive monomer that also carries an initiator, a so-called "inimer". One example is the base catalyzed reaction between the inimer glycidol and the germ trimethylol propane as illustrated by Formula 2.<br><br>
K - germ (the beginning of the polymer	D * dendritic branching<br>
molecule)	T = termination (the end of the polymer<br>
L - linear propagation	molecule)<br>
Formula 2<br><br>
Hyperbranched polymers made in this way have properties that are quite similar to corresponding dendrimers (A. Sunder, R. Hanselmann, H. Frey, R. Mtlhlhaupt; Macromolecules, (1998), 32, 4240), This implies a much lower viscosity than that of linear polymers with a comparable number of free available HO-groups, A characteristic feature in the manufacturing process is that the inimer glycidol must be added veiy slowly to the germ and in a very thin dilution. Thus, "the cost-efficiency of the process is severely reduced which is why the utility of hyperbranched polymers in industrial applications is quite limited.<br>
It is previously known to perform certain modifications of the T groups of hyperbranched polymers. J.-P. Majoral, A.-M. Caminade and R. Kraemer, Andes de Quimicalnt Ed, (1997), 93,415-421 describe the functionalization of dendrimers containing phosphorus. The functionalization of the T groups can be made with identical / similar chemical groups or with different chemical groups.<br>
FR 2761691 discusses dendrimers with functional groups at the surface that are modified through a reaction with cyclic thioesters. The reaction leads to a dendrimer surface with thiol groups that are attached to the dendrimer by amide or amine bondings. The products may be used as antioxidants. The dendrimers described are of the type polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM dendrimers). PAMAM dendrimers contain tertiary amines that comparatively easy may be degraded after conversion to quaternary ammonium salts or aminoxides (A. W. Hofmann, Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. (1851), 78,253-286; A. C. Cope, E. R. Trumbull, Org React (1960), 11,3 17-493; A. C. Cope, T. T. Foster, p. H. Towle, J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1949), 71,3929-3935). Quaternary ammonium salts or aminoxides from amine based dendrimers can be formed when additives of amine based dendrimers are incorporated/ compounded into thermoplastics with subsequent processing of the thermoplastics (e.g. film blowing, extrusion, casting). Such a degradation on one fctand leads to a partial deterioration of the dendrimer core and on the other hand to formation of degradation products which may leak out and thereby reduce the surface quality of the polymer product. In addition tertiary amines may during processing of the thermoplastic form free radicals by decomposition of hydro peroxides (A. V. Tobolsky, R.B. Mesrobian, Organic Peroxides, (1954), Interscience Publishers, New York, p. 104-106). Dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers that contain tertiary amines thereby may induce an unintended degradation of thermoplastics during their processing, storage or use.<br>
WO 01/48057 discusses multifunctional stabilizers against thermal oxidative degradation based on a core structure containing tertiary amines. As mentioned above this may lead to an unintended degradation of the core structure during processing, storage or use of (the) thermoplastics. The molar weight of a typical stabilizer manufactured in accordance with WO 01/4805*7 is 1246 g/mole.<br>
WO 97/19987 discusses combinations of polymer additives and modified dendrimers that may be used in polymer materials. In the exemplification of WO 97/199987 the dendrimex-s are based on<br><br>
polypropyieneimine (PPI) of 3rd, 4th and 5th generation thereby including 16,32, and 64 terminal amine groups. The core structure contains tertiary amines which may lead to an unintended degradation of the core structure during processing, storage or use of thermoplastics. The modification of the PPI dendrimer with a fatly acid to form a multifunctional fatty acid amide may bee conducted by means of heating in a suitable solvent, The tertiary amine groups in the core structure of the dendrimer and primary amine groups at the dendrimer surface may in presence of oxygen contribute to partial degradation of the dendrimer structure. As explained above free radicals may be formed by decomposition of hydro peroxides. Such a partial degradation is indicated by a faint brown or yellow colour of the modified PPI dendrimer, like in examples I, XI, and XII in WO 97/19987. Typical molecule weights for modified PPI dendrimers in WO 97/1S987 are in the range 10 000 to 40 000 g/mole. In WO 02/092668 surface activated hyperbranched or dendritic stabilizers comprising at least one additive group and a hyperbranched or dendritic core is discussed. In the exemplification of WO 02/092668 only dendritic cores based on 2,2-bis-(hydroxymethyl)-propionic acid is used. The dendritic core and the bonding to the additive group thereby are mainly based on ester bondings, which make the stabilizer sensitive to hydrolysis. In addition the exemplification of WO 02/092668 shows that the molecules of the prepared stabilizers as determined by gel permeation chromatography is between 1000 and 1500 grams/ mole.<br>
One type of particulate polymers with properties corresponding to the properties of hyperbranched polymers comprises an inorganic SixO(] 5)x-core with one T group per Si atom and is known as POSS (polyhedral oligosilesquioxanes). The most common compound of this class is a POSS with x=8 and subatantially cubic structure (C. Sanchez, G.J. de A.A. Soler-Illia, F. Ribot, T. Lalot, C.R. Mayer, V. Cabuil; Chem. Mater., (2001),13,3066). The manufacture of POSS is expensive (SA.C. Gravel, C. Zhang, M. Dinderman, R.M. Laine; Appl Organometal Chem., (1999), 13t 329-336 and WO 01/10871) and their industrial applicability is therefore limited. Another type of particulate polymers with properties corresponding to the properties of hyperbarnched polymers consists of an inorganic SixO(i,5)X core that carries one T group per Si atom and may be manufactured in a sol—gel process through controlled hydrolysis and condensation of a silane with a structure:<br>
X-B- Si(-Y)3<br>
Where Y is chosen among hydrolysable residues and X-B basically corresponds to the T group -The process is described e.g. in Applicant's own WO publication No. 0208343. Sol-gel proces- ses may be cost efficient so that they may be conducted in industrial scale from favourable raw materials and under mild conditions, i.e. without use of high pressures or high temperatures and without particular precautions like extreme dilution or the like. Thus particulate polymers withL<br><br>
properties corresponding to properties of hyperbranched polymers manufactured by sol gel processes are industrially applicable in many areas.<br>
Many examples of utilization of sol gel products in polymer products are known (DE 199 33 098, EP 666 290). Normally the main focus is placed upon the inorganic SixO(i.s)x core with a size in the nanometre range and thereby upon the sol-gel product as inorganic nano particle, cf. DE 199 33 098 and EP 486 469. The inorganic residues X-B are typically used to anchor the sol gel products in an organic matrix, cf. EP 486 469. The sol gel process involving hydrolysis and condensation of a silane in which the X-B group contains one or more amide groups is particularly simple because no external catalyst is needed and because the process may be conducted at ambient temperature or under moderate heating. One example is controlled hydrolysis and condensation of y-aminopropyl trialkoxysilane as described in applicant's own patent application, WO publication No. 0208343. Controlled hydrolysis and condensation of silanes in which the X-B groups contains one or more amide groups typically leads to a sol in which the resulting particulate polymer product has an organic/ inorganic structure (hybrid polymer) that is comparable with a hyperbranched polymer product with a number of more or less free amine groups in the T groups. Such organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers exhibits a large number of functional T groups compared to their weight and/ or volume. At the same time its compact structure compared to the structure of linear polymers ensures desirable properties like low viscosity and good admixing properties with thermoset plastics and thermoplastics. An example of an organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer with properties corresponding to a hyperbranched polymer is shown by Formula 3.<br><br>
D - dendritic branching based on SiOi.s	T = termination (functional T-groups)<br>
D-groups that are bonded to fewer than three D units do not carry hydrolysed and/ or condensed substituents<br>
Formula 3<br>
Organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers with properties corresponding to properties of hyperbranched polymers find utilization e.g. as additives for polymer products like thermoset plastics and in lacquers and other types of coatings for surface protection. Used in appropriate amounts and with<br><br>
convenient particle size such hybrid polymers may contribute to a significant improvement of the properties of the plastic material or the lacquer in question, hereunder an increased wear resistance/ scratch resistance and/ or weather resistance.<br>
Prior art technology in the area sol gel processes/ products may broadly be divided in four main categories as elaborated in more detail below, with reference to some examples or publications.<br>
A first category concerns modification of non-hydrolysed amine containing silanes (DE 2023968, WO 03/029361, EP 0253770, EP 666290), commonly with bi-functional epoxy compounds (like e.g. JP 2001192485 ), and use of same in thermoplastics or in coatings. Hydrolysis and condensation are in some cases subsequently conducted but prior to its addition to the thermoplastics or coating in question. In general this method leads to an undefined distribution of molecular sizes with many large molecules. This implies that a subsequent hydrolysis is difficult to conduct with great success, since water will not reach all sites of the very large molecules. A low degree of hydrolysis implies a lower scratch resistance and a lower weather resistance for the product. A further disadvantage is that the water used for the hydrolysis in presence of the organic parts of the molecule may react in an undesired manner with active groups of said organic parts. Utilization of non-hydrolysed alkoxysilane compounds in a thermoplastic or thermoset plastic material implies that alcohols like ethanol and methanol are formed during the subsequent, slow hydrolysis of the silane compound, i.e. subsequent to the plastic material having been exposed to water. This may lead to reduced mechanical properties of the thermoplastic or the coating. In addition the formation of alcohols such as ethanol and/ or methanol may cause migration of additives and/ or degradation products to the surface of a thermoplastic or a coating, which may reduce the surface quality severely.<br>
Another category of prior art methods concerns modification of nitrogen containing sol gel products by chemical reactions in which amine groups are not directly involved (S. kar, P. Joly, M. Granier, O. Melnyk, J.-O. Durand, Eur. J. Org. Chem.; (2003), 4132-4139) or are not important (US 5744243). The latter publication describes a coating composition that is achieved by mixing a) an acid catalysed hydrolysis and condensation of silane and monomer and b) a polymerized solution of organic polymer that contains functions which are compatible with the silane monomer. The coating is used for light reflection.<br>
A third category concerns surface modification solely with S1O2 particles, i.e. particles of silica that may be, but need not be, manufactured by a sol gel process. A (non hydrolysed) silane is typically used for their modification, since the silanes form organic branches on the particles. This type of modification does not involve amine groups as reactive centres for the modification. Patent application No. 9603174-5 describes an aqueous dispersion of silica particles in different polymers used e.g. to increase the hardness.<br><br>
WO publications Nos. 9407948 and 00/22039 describe this known technology where a surface modification of the oxide particles is conducted by silanization. In some cases the oxide particles may be made of hydrolysed silane. The silanes used for surface modification are not hydrolysed. These particles are used as filler and for the modification of polymers and foils. A disadvantage of products with such particles is that they cannot melt after being cured and their use as hyperbranched polymers is therefore limited, A disadvantage of this technology is that each silane has several functional groups that not necessarily bond to one and the same particle. If or when a silane is bonded to different particles, this contributes to an agglomeration of particles which is unfavourable. This may take place right away or occur over time, which means that the system is unstable. Due to the size of the silanes not many functions may be attached to each particles, which means that the degree of hyper branching is relatively low. In EP 0786499 is described a composition that may be cured in presence of moisture and comprising a) a multi functional acrylate, b) at least one alkoxy-functional organometallic component (TEOS) or hydrolysate, and c) at least one trialkoxyaminosilane.<br>
A fourth category of prior art technology is sol gel processes that is based on hydrolysed silane and where a modification is made by means fan organic monomer, prepolymer or polymer.<br>
EP 486 469 describes an inorganic/ organic hybrid polymer that is prepared by polymerizing an organic monomer in presence of a partially or completely hydrolysed silane based sol. A typical example from EP 486 469 is the polymerization of methylmetakrylate in presence of a sol that is prepared by use of metakryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane. Use of the resulting composition is said to be as a wear resistant coating.<br>
In US patent No. 5 674 941 a coating composition is described which comprises hydrolysate/ condensate of a) an epoxid containing silane, b) an organic amino functional silane, c a copolymer of two components selected from an acrylate monomer, an epoxy monomer, an organosilane and/ or a terpolymer of said three components, d) a curing catalyst, e) a multifunctional acrylate, and f) a radical polymerization initiator. The composition is very complex and a chemical substitution of amine groups to form a polybranched, organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer is not described.<br>
US patent No. 5 096 942 concerns a process in which firstly a polymer based on a hydrolysed silane, a so-called inorganic core, is prepared, which is bonded to a polymer chain like polystyrene. The hydrolysis of the silane is conducted in a way so that the condensation between Si-OH groups is actually prevented. The hydrolysed silane is thereafter added to a hydrolysed metal oxide or silane which results in a organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer with properties corresponding to a hyperbranched polymer with a mole weight 1000-100 000 grams/ mole. The silane does not contain nitrogen and no deliberate substitution of free amine groups in the sol is mentioned in US 5 096 942.<br><br>
US patent No. 5 110 863 describes the manufacture of a sol that comprises an organosilane (with imidazole) and a metalalkoxide which is hydrolysed and can form an independent coating.<br>
Objects<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for the manufacture of components, materials, additives and/ or material compositions based on particulate, polybranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide methods as defined above in which the organic part may be varied by simple chemical substitutions.<br>
It is a still further object of the invention to make such variation that at least one property of such components, materials, additives and/ or material compositions is adjust ed, such as but not limited to weather resistance, scratch resistance, barrier properties, dependent upon the actual area of utilization.<br>
The invention<br>
The above mentioned objects are achieved by a method as defined in claim 1. According to another aspect the present invention concerns a method as defined by claim 2.<br>
According to a further aspect the present invention concerns a particulate polybranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer as defined by claim 21.<br>
According to further aspects the invention concerns uses of products as manufactured by the methods defined above, as defined by the claims 25-29.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the different aspects of the invention are disclosed by the dependent claims.<br>
A skilled artisan will readily understand that claims 1 and 2 represent two aspects of the same invention and that the sole difference between the two relates to whether the organic amino-fimctional silanes used are hydrolysed and condensed or not hydrolysed. In the latter case hydrolysis and condensation form the first step in a process comprising at least two steps. In the former case such a step obviously is redundant and therefore omitted. The skilled artisan will furthermore understand that the group X-B is chosen such that it will not be hydrolysed under the conditions that will be applied for the method.<br>
In either case free amine groups are modified through a chemical substitution after the completed silane hydrolysis and condensation. Suitable chemical substitutions are conducted between the free amine groups in the T groups and reactive compounds that preferably react actually quantitatively with more or less free amine groups at temperatures typically below 470 K and pressures typically lower than 0.3 MPa.<br><br>
Particularly interesting are sol-gel processes by which the T groups may be chemically modified in one or more steps immediately after the hydrolysis and condensation has been completed and for which the reactor equipment used for the silane hydrolysis and condensation may be employed. Such batch processes form the basis for a very cost efficient manufacture of particulate organic/ inorganic polybranched polymers which can carry a large number of different T groups and which therefore may be used in a large number of different industrial areas of application.<br>
By reactions typical for primary and secondary amines is meant addition reactions, substitution reactions and combinations of such reactions with suitable reactant such as, but not limited to, compounds comprising epoxy groups, isocyanate groups, reactive double bonds, substitutable groups, and proton donating groups.<br>
By controlled hydrolysis and condensation is herein meant hydrolysis and condensation of a suitable silane compound:<br>
The first step is hydrolysis of a suitable silane compound, R'-Si(OR)n, wherein the group R* does not participate in the hydrolysis or condensation reactions. Alkoxide ligands are replaced by hydroxy 1 groups:<br>
Si-OR + H-OH Si-OH + ROH<br>
A controlled amount of water and a controlled amount of a glycol based solvent is added during this step. The reaction temperature and the reaction time are also controlled.<br>
The second step is condensation in which the hydroxyl group can react with hydroxyl groups or alkoxy groups from other silicon centres and form Si-O-Si bonds and water or alcohol respectively:<br>
Si-OH + HO-Si Si-O-Si +H20<br>
or<br>
Si-OR + HO-Si Si-O-Si + ROH<br>
To manufacture particles of a certain size it is required to establish chemical conditions that ensures a correct balance between the kinetics of the two reactions, namely condensation and hydrolysis. While the condensation contributes to formation of polymer chains from (single) monomer molecules, the hydrolysis contributes to a polycrystallinic precipitation or oxohydroxide precipitation. The combination of amino-functional silanes and exchange of alkoxide groups with strong ligands will moderate the hydrolysis reaction, which will ensure that the polymer chains not become too long but remian in the size of oligomers. In practice the particles will be prepared with a size of few nanometres, more typically less than 10 nm. A suitable stabilizer is normally added to the reaction composition to avoid oxidative degradation of reactants and reaction products during hydrolysis and condensation and subsequent modification. The resulting solution is comprised of inorganic polymer particles dipersed in a solvent.<br><br>
The invention in further detail/ preferred embodiments<br>
According to the present invention a polybranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer is manufactured by a sol-gel process comprising at least two steps in a defined chronological sequence.<br>

i) when at least one of Ri, Ra is H, adding at least one reactant that is capable of causing N-H hydrogen atoms in the X-B group to be replaced through reactions that are typical for primary and secondary amines, and/ or<br>
ii) adding an acid that is capable of causing an addition to N atoms in the X-B group of the core so that the N atoms entirely or partially are converted to quaternary nitronium ions.<br>
The acid used in step ii) may be a Broensted acid or a Lewis acid.<br>
Characteristic and preferred reactions in step i) are addition reactions and substitution reactions or a combination of at least one addition reaction and at least one substitution reaction.<br>
In such reaction reactive compounds that may be used comprises, but are not limited to, epoxides, cyclic and non-cyclic acid derivatives, blocked and non-blocked isocyanates, compounds with reactive double bonds, aldehydes, ketones, and proton donating compounds.<br>
Particularly in substitution reactions compounds R-X comprising a) a suitable atom or atom group X and b) a group R may be used,<br>
in which R-X may react with more or less free amine groups in a substitution reaction in which an atom or an atom group X is replaced by an amine group (Endre Berner, "Laerebok i organisk kjemi", Aschehoug &amp; Co., Oslo (1964), s. 144-147) and where the group R is chosen among non-substituted saturated or unsaturated CrC24 alkyl, substituted saturated or unsaturated C1-C24 alkyl, non-substituted or substituted aryl, aliphatic or aromatic carbonyl, while the carbon chains of said compounds optionally can contain one or more of the elements oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorous, silicon, and boron; or groups chosen among condensation products or addition products of one or more types of chemical compounds such as acids, alcohols, phenols, amines, aldehydes, or epoxides in which the atom or atom group X preferably is chosen among halogen, substituted or non-substituted alkoxyl, phenoxyl, amine, carboxylate, sulphonate, sulphinate, phosphonate, or phosphinate.<br><br>
When step i) is an addition reaction it is convenient and preferred that this is conducted by substitution of the N-H hydrogen atom with an A-=B double bond where A, B are chosen among the elements C, O, N, S and P. According to an also preferred alternative the addition reaction involves ring opening of an epoxide group that optionally may be succeeded by reaction (substitution) with a ketone or an aldehyde. Yet another preferred embodiment for the accomplishment of the addition reaction consists in a reaction at the N-H hydrogen atom with a blocked or unblocked isocyanate. Still another preferred embodiment for accomplishing the addition reaction includes ring opening of a cyclic acid anhydride or derivative thereof, such as a carbonic acid derivative. Also a combination of such reactant as mentioned above may be used for the desired addition reaction.<br>
For such an addition reaction a molar excess of reactant may if desired be added to allow repeated addition reactions that in practice leads to a polymerization of the organic branches.<br>
It is preferred to use, as reactant for the alternative of at least one substitution reaction in step i), a mono functional carboxyl acid or a derivative of a sulphinic acid or sulphonic acid.<br>
In step ii) the acid to be used may be a Lewis acid or a Broensted acid.<br>
The method according to the invention is not dependent upon a certain type of reaction medium and may be conducted in both aqueous and organic based dispersion agents. It is particularly surprising and beneficial that it is also applicable in water based media, which is also environmentally favourable.<br>
For some purposes it is preferred to use particularly selected reactants that lead to specific properties for the particulate, polybranched, organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer. For example, in order to obtain a product with flame retardant properties it is advantageous to use reactants that comprise halogen for the reaction exemplified as addition reaction or substitution reaction. If a particularly hydrophobic end product is desired it may be advantageous to use at least one fluorinated reactant in step i) and/ or ii) of the method according to the invention.<br>
For further use or treatment of the particulate, polybranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer it is convenient that it has at least one polymerizable double bond, such as part of an acryl group, vinyl group or an unsaturated fatty acid.<br>
Below the choice of reactants and reaction conditions are elaborated in further detail through exemplification of reactants and reaction conditions and by way of reference to conducted experiments.<br>

An example of a combination of reactions is<br>
a)	substitution of N-H hydrogen atoms at the non-hydrolyzable substituent X-B group by<br>
an epoxide, resulting in formation of an aminoalcohol,<br>

In the manufacture of a polybranched, organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer by a sol-gel process, the hybrid polymer having the form of an inorganic core and organic branches, a suitable stabilizer is normally added to the reaction composition to prevent oxidative degradation of the reactants and reaction products during hydrolysis and condensation and subsequent modification of X-B-Si(-Y)3. Suitable stabilizers are radical scavengers based on hindered amines, one or more antioxidants or a combination of same (Hans Zweifel (ed.), Plastics Additives Handbook, Carl Hanser Verlag, Mtlnchen, (2001), 10-19).<br>
By first hydrolysing the molecules that comprises the organic core and thereafter through suitable reaction, addition or addition, attach the organic branches thereto, the method of the present invention thereby provides a particularly high degree of branching and a control of the particle size in the thus produced sol that has never before been achieved. This leads to several advantages. Firstly the hydrolysis may be conducted more completely than what is die case if the particle composition includes some very large particles. Secondly the risk that water used for the hydrolysis<br><br>
to some extent unintentionally reacts with active groups in the organic parts of the molecule is avoided.<br>
The invention thus provide a possibility of manufacturing a large number of differently functionalized organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers with properties corresponding to the properties of hyperbranched polymers, through a simple two step batch process under mild conditions (T 
Such organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers have properties that are comparable with the properties of organic, hyperbranched polymers and may be used for many applications, like functional additives in thermoplastics and thermoset plastics, e.g. as antioxidant, UV absorb or radical scavenger, as cross-binder in thermoplastics and thermoset plastics, as component in adhesives, lacquers and coating products and as functional material in other connections. Used as additive the polybranched hybrid polymers prepared according to the invention contribute to a lasting increase in scratch resistance and weather resistance for the products in which they are used.<br>
Temperature and stability during hydrolysis of the organic/ inorganic hybrid polymers according to the invention are better than those of the organic hyperbranched polymers due to stable Si-0 bonds in the polymer core and due to the core's compact structure with a very high degree of cross-linking.<br>
Reversible viscosity changes is observed during heating/ cooling due to the particulate structure with a stable inorganic core and function carrying organic groups that are bonded to the inorganic core, which is important in connection with the subsequent treatment/ processing of products based on the invention.<br>
The choice of method for the manufacture of materials and products according to the invention enables an industrial utilization of the invention in a cost efficient manner. The manufacture of materials and products according to the invention is based on a batch process under mild conditions (T 
By convenient choice of raw materials for the method according to the invention, stabilizers, coating forming additives or other additives may be manufactured. Such stabilizers or other additives provide a broader range of applications than what is the case for known, monofunctional stabilizers and may be used in lacquers, paints, thermoset plastics and thermoplastics. By convenient choice of raw materials one may for instance in combination with a suitable polymer achieve an excellent barrier layer for molecules in gas and liquid form, like water, O2, CQ2 and hydrocarbons. It is furthermore possible with the method according to the invention to manufacture additives for avoiding leakages of additives and/ or degradation products. Correspondingly self-<br><br>
organizing networks may be formed, such as in adhesives or thermo-stable/ thermo-reversible networks that find use in functional materials.<br>
Examples<br>
Experiment 1<br>
Manufacture of a_polybranched organic/ inorganic hybrid polymer by a sol-gel process.<br>
a)	221.4 g (1.00 mol) y-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (A-l 100, GE Silicones, USA) was placed in a 1000 ml round bottom flask with hose cooler and magnetic stirrer. A mixture of 93.6 g (0.60 moles) butyldiglykol (BDG) and 22.5 g (1.30 moles) water and 1.00 g Tinuvin 123 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Switzerland) was added. The mixture was heated in an oil bath at 110°C under reflux for 45 minutes. Thereafter the volatile reaction products or reactants were removed in a vacuum distillation at the oil bath temperature of 110°C - 160°C and a vacuum gradient from about 1000 mbar to less than 20 mbar. The distillation was terminated when the pressure in the round bottom flask has reached 20 mbar or less for 10 minutes. Ca. 192 ml distillate was recovered. The reaction product was a clear, uncoloured liquid with a Gardner Color = 1 (according to. Gardner Color Scale / ASTM D1544)<br>
b)	The reaction product from a) was heated to 70°C to obtain a clear liquid. Then 256.4 g (1.00 moles) of Araldite DY-E (glycidylether of Cn-C^-alcohol, Vantico AG (Huntsman AG), S-witzerland) was added and the reaction mixture was held at 70°C for an hour. A clear product with a Gardner Color = 1, having the form of a viscous gel at 20°C and a non-viscous liquid at 90°C, was obtained.<br>
The distillate in a) comprises insignificant amounts of volatile amine. In a corresponding experiment in which no stabilizer (like e.g. Tinuvin 123) was used during the manufacturing process, the distillate in a) comprises relatively large amounts of the volatile amine products, which mainly is due to degradation of A-l 100 during the synthesis.<br>
