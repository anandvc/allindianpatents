The invention relates to a pack having a group of cigarette packs - cigarette multipack-and a wrapper therefor and a blank for producing the said pack, the latter being produced by being folded from an, in particular, single-piece blank.<br>
For transportation purposes and, as appropriate, also for subsequent sales purposes, cigarette packs are combined to form so-called cigarette multipacks and, in the process, are provided with an accommodating wrapper (said wrapper accommodating the entire group). Various possible options are known for the configuration of the wrapper. It is not usually possible to see the contents, namely the cigarette packs. In addition, it is difficult to draw conclusions as to the contents from the outer configuration.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a pack of which the configuration makes it possible to draw conclusions as to the contents. In addition, the intention is for it to be possible for the pack to be produced as efficiently as possible in high-speed packaging machines.<br>
The pack according to the invention is characterized in that the wrapper is configured in the manner of a wrapper for a hinge-lid pack. The cigarette packs provided as the contents are preferably so-called hinge-lid packs with a box part, having a large upright front wall, a hinge lid, and a collar or analogously configured so-called soft carton packs. According to the invention, the wrapper of the cigarette multipack is likewise configured in the manner of a hinge-lid pack, in particular in the manner of the abovedescribed upright hinge-lid cigarette pack. The pack has the<br><br>
outward appearance of a larger version of the small packs provided as the contents. This gives a clear indication of the contents at first glance.<br>
In contrast to the hinge-lid cigarette packs which are common throughout the world - the wrapper is constructed in accordance with the so-called transverse-folding principle. In this case, a large front wall (even in the non-folded state) is connected to a large rear wall via an upright narrow first side wall. The front wall is also preferably connected to a second narrow side wall.<br>
The rear wall and one of the side walls are connected to one another via an additional connecting strip. It is possible for the latter to adjoin the second side wall or the rear wall and to be adhesively bonded to the respectively other wall. In respect of the pack being produced in as an efficient a manner as possible, it is advantageous for the connecting strip to be arranged on the rear wall. During production of the pack, a group of cigarette packs is positioned on the first side wall and pushed into a pocket of a folding subassembly with the wrapper, which folds in the form of a U in the process. The pocket walls of the folding subassembly are dimensioned such that it is possible for the second side wall and the connecting strip to project out of the pocket and to be folded one upon the other by corresponding folding elements.<br>
The wrapper or the blank provided therefor is of single-piece design. This means that the lid and collar form part of the blank. In this case, the walls which are provided for forming the lid adjoin at the top of the walls which are provided for forming the box part. Moreover, the parts which are provided for the collar are arranged above the lid walls. In this case, connections are provided between the collar and lid walls,  in  particular  in  the  region  of  upright<br><br>
longitudinal folding lines, by correspondingly provided material webs between collar and lid walls. During production of the pack, the collar is folded downward through 180° and comes to rest, in part, on walls of the box part and, in part, on walls of the lid. Adhesive bonding, naturally, is only provided in the region of the box part. The material webs provided between the collar and lid tear open when the pack is opened for the first time.<br>
In the region of a lid front wall, a lid inner tab is folded inward. The latter is punched out in the region of the transition between the lid front wall and front wall of the box part. This correspondingly produces, on the finished pack, a cutout, between the lid front wall and box part, which is equal to the size of the lid inner tab and is concealed on the inside by the collar front wall. The latter may be provided here with an inscription-Hinge- lid cigarette packs, meanwhile, are available in three different versions, namely, with relatively sharp 90°-edges in the region .of the upright longitudinal folding lines, as so-called round-edged packs and as so-called octagonal packs. The pack according to the invention may also be designed in the manner of these three versions.  It  is preferable  for  the  type  of cigarette packs which are provided as the contents to correspond  precisely  to  the  type  of  cigarette multipack.<br>
Further features of the invention can be gathered from the claims. These also include packaging for accommodating a group of cigarette packs and a blank for forming a cigarette multipack.<br>
The invention also relates to a pack having a wrapper and a group of cigarette packs - cigarette multipack -the wrapper being produced by being folded from an, in<br><br>
particular, single-piece blank and having a base wall, narrow upright side walls, a top wall, and a large-surface-area (wide) front wall and rear wall. This specific pack is characterized in that, in the region of the transitions between the front wall and end walls and/or rear wall and end walls, rounded regions - round edges - or folds which are adjacent to one another with a small spacing therebetween for forming an octagonal pack are provided instead of "sharp" 90° folds.<br>
Here too, an essential aspect of the invention is that the outer form of the pack gives an indication of the contents. The contents thus comprise known round-edged packs for cigarettes, in particular with a hinged lid in each case.  The grouping of the cigarette packs corresponds  to  that  of  a  conventional  cigarette multipack, namely two rows with five packs each, the cigarette  packs  within  a  row butting  against  one another by way of their narrow sides, and the packs of adjacent rows butting against one another by way of large-surface-area walls  (front wall or rear wall). Correspondingly,  the group of cigarette packs have upright round edges. These come to rest on the inside of  the round edges of  the pack according to  the invention. Unnecessary cavities are thus avoided. It is also the case that the pack overall is relatively stable since it is precisely -in the region of the round edges that the round edges of the cigarette packs abut on the inside and give additional support.<br>
Special features are provided in respect of the configuration of tabs for forming the upright narrow end walls, in particular in respect of the tabs which are connected to the base wall (base tabs).<br>
Naturally, the packaging and the blank are also claimed in addition to the pack.<br><br>
In the same way as the pack according to the invention mentioned in the introduction -the wrapper consists of foldable material, in particular of thin cardboard, strong paper or the like.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a pack having a group of cigarette packs -cigarette multipack - and a wrapper therefor, made of an, in particular, single-piece blank, the wrapper being configured in the manner of a wrapper for a hinge-lid cigarette pack, characterized by a design as a round-edged pack or octagonal pack, i.e. with upright rounded regions instead of the conventional upright longitudinal folding lines or with upright double longitudinal folding lines, which are connected by a narrow folding strip, instead of the conventional upright longitudinal folding lines, it being the case that, with a configuration as a round-edged pack, round-edged cigarette packs are provided as the contents, with upright round edges of the cigarette packs arranged along the upright rounded regions of the pack, and it being the case that, with the pack being configured as an octagonal pack, octagonal cigarette packs are provided as the contents, with upright narrow folding strips of the cigarette packs arranged along the upright folding strips of the pack.<br>

according to figure 20 in the region of a narrow upright end side, approximately halfway up the latter, and<br>
Figure 23 shows a view of a narrow end wall of the pack<br>
according to figure 20.<br>
Figure 2 shows a pack 10 according to the invention, of which the outer form corresponds to that of an upright, conventional and commonly used hinge-lid box for cigarettes. A bottom box part 11 is closed by a top lid 12. Fastened in the box part 11, and projecting upward out of the latter, is a collar 13, the region which<br><br>
projects out of the box part 11 being enclosed by the lid 12 in the closed position.<br>
The box part 11 has a large front wall 14, a rear wall 15, narrow side walls 16 and 17 and a base wall 18. The latter is formed by an outer longitudinal tab 19 which adjoins the front wall 14 at the bottom, by an inner longitudinal tab 20 which adjoins the rear wall 15 at the bottom and by corner tabs, 21, 22 which adjoin the side walls. These three last-mentioned tabs 20 to 22 are formed such that they cannot overlap one another and thus come to rest precisely in the same plane. It is only the outer longitudinal tab 19 which covers the other three tabs. A two-layered base wall 18 is thus produced overall.<br>
On the side opposite to the front wall 14, the right-hand side wall 17 is adjoined by a connecting strip 23. During production of the pack 10 to the finished state, said connecting strip is connected to the rear wall 15 on the inside. On account of the blank parts 14 to 17 being folded via the side walls 16, 17, the pack 10 or a blank 24 therefor are also referred to as a "transverse-folding" pack or blank.<br>
The blank 24 is configured in one piece with the corresponding parts for the box part 11, the lid 12 and the collar 13. The already mentioned walls 15 to 17 are adjoined at the top by corresponding lid walls, namely a lid front wall 25, a lid rear wall 26 and lid side walls 27, 28. The lid front wall 25 is adjoined at the bottom - in the region of the transition to the front wall 14 - by a so-called lid inner tab 29 which, in the finished pack, is folded inward into abutment against the lid front wall 25. This means that between the lid front wall 25 and front wall 14, the finished pack 10 has a cutout 30, although it is closed by a collar front wall 31.<br><br>
En order to form a lid top wall <br>
at the same time) , the blank 24 is provided with a :over tab 33 which adjoins the lid rear wall 26 at the top, with an inner cover tab 34 which adjoins the lid front wall 25 at the top, and with side tabs 35, 36. Analogously to the base wall 18, it is also the case that the lid top wall 32 is only of two-layered design. For thi s purpose, the tabs 34 to 3 6 have a corresponding configuration, with the result that they do not overlap one another.<br>
The tabs 34 to 3 6 are adj oined at the top by blank parts for forming the collar 13, namely the already mentioned collar front wall 31 above the inner cover tab 34 and collar side tabs 37, 38. An upright folding line 39 is formed between the collar side tab 37 and collar front wall 31, and a folding line 40 is formed between the collar front wall 31 and collar side tab 38. Parallel to the abovementioned folding lines, and more or less in alignment therewith (offset slightly in the outward direction), corresponding longitudinal folding lines 41, 42 are respectively arranged between the side wall 16 and front wall 14 and between the front wall 14 and side wall 17.<br>
According to figure 1, the blank parts which are provided for forming the lid 12 are already separated, in part, from the box part 11 by severing cuts and are only attached to one another still in the region of residual connections. Corresponding severing cuts 43, 44 and 45 are provided between the lid side walls 27, 28, and the respectively adjacent side walls 16, 17 and between the lid inner tab 29 and the front wall 14. The severing cut 44 on the bottom border of the lid inner tab 29, at the same time, defines the shape of the cutout 30. An articulation line 46 is depicted between the lid rear wall 26 and rear wall 15. The severing cuts 43, 45 which are provided in the region of the side  walls  are  not  continuous.  Rather  residual<br><br>
connections, namely material webs 47 ana 48, which interrupt the respective severing cuts, are provided. Naturally, the severing cuts 43, 44 and 45 adjoin one another. When the pack is opened for the first time, the material webs 47, 48 are severed or torn apart from one another, with the result that web remnants 49, 50 are produced on the initially interconnected pack parts namely side walls 16, 17, on the one hand, and lid side walls 27, 28 on the other hand, see figures 3 and 4.<br>
The collar 13 adjoins the lid in the region of the tabs 34 to 36, Collar side tabs 37, 38 are separated off from the collar front wall 31 by the upright folding lines. Provided between the collar front wall 31 and the inner cover tab 34 is a severing cut 54, which defines the configuration of a visible cutout 51 in the collar front wall and a top border of the same. The cutout 51 is bounded laterally by upright ridges 52, 53. The severing cut 54 is interrupted by residual connections 55 between the ridges 52,53. Severing cuts<br>
56,	57 are likewise provided between the collar side<br>
tabs 37, 38 and lid side tabs 35, 36.<br>
Finally, a special feature is provided in the region of the transition between the severing cuts 56, 54 and 54,<br>
57.	The folding lines 39, 40 cross here. Moreover, so-<br>
called folding gussets 58, 59 are formed. These are of<br>
triangular or trapezoidal design and produce the<br>
connection between the collar 13 and the lid 12. In the<br>
spread-out blank 24, the folding gussets 57, 58 are<br>
respectively located precisely between the side tab 35<br>
and inner cover tab 34 and between the inner cover tab<br>
34 and side tab 36. Correspondingly, the abovementioned<br>
tabs in this region have oblique edges 60 (side tabs 35<br>
and 36) and likewise obliquely directed mating edges 61<br>
(inner cover tab 34) . The folding gussets 58, 59 here<br>
are connected to the collar side tabs 37, 38 and to the<br>
collar front wall at least via residual connections and<br>
are also attached to the lid 12 via a narrow material<br><br>
web 62 in the region of the folding lines 41, 42 in<br>
each case.<br>
During production of the pack, the areas of glue which are necessary for fixing the lid inner tab 2 9 and collar 13 are applied first of all. The lid inner tab 29 is then folded through 180° against the lid front wall 25. Thereafter, the collar 13 is folded downward in the rearward direction out of the position according to figure 1, and out of the image plane, to be precise around the material webs 62, with the result that the collar side tabs 37 and 38, in part, butt against the inside of the side walls 16, 17 and in part, project beyond the same, see figure 3. The collar front wall 31 still comes to rest on the front wall 14, beneath the severing cut 44, by way of a narrow strip 63 and otherwise projects upward beyond the front wall, see figures 3 and 4.<br>
The folding gussets 58, 59 are bounded in the upward direction, i.e. between the severing lines 56, 57 and 54, in figure 1 by severing cuts 64, 65, which continue the abovementioned lines and, in turn, are interrupted in each case by residual connections, namely material webs 66, 67. When the packaging is opened for the first time, the material webs 66, 67 are severed, while the folding gussets 58, 59 remain attached to the inside of the lid. The folding gussets are thus preferably connected to corresponding blank regions of the lid by adhesive bonding.<br>
The rest of the folding of the blank and the rest of the production of the pack are carried out in accordance with the production process.<br>
The finished pack contains two rows, each with five conventional cigarette hinge-lid boxes, in each case with sharp upright 90°-folding edges, corresponding to the longitudinal folding lines 41, 42.<br><br>
In the finished pack, the folding gussets 58, 59 come to rest inside the pack, to be precise respectively between the lid side wall 27 and lid front wall 25 and between the lid front wall 25 and lid side wall 28.<br>
As can be seen in figure 4, the individual cigarette packs in each row are arranged to butt closely against one another by way of the large walls (front wall and rear wall). Correspondingly, the dimensions of the pack 10 overall are such that the width of the pack corresponds approximately to the depth of five single cigarette packs, the depth of the pack corresponds approximately to the width of a single cigarette pack and the height corresponds to the height of two cigarette packs positioned one above the other. The upright longitudinal edges of the respectively outer cigarette packs come to rest adjacent and parallel to the upright longitudinal edges (lines 41, 42) of the pack. The material used for the blank 24 is thin cardboard or stiff paper. It is actually possible to use any foldable material.<br>
In an embodiment which is not shown, the lid inner tab 29 is not provided. Instead, the front wall 14 extends over a correspondingly greater height, namely as far as the now provided folding line 68 between the lid front wall 25 and the lid inner tab 29.<br>
Figures 5 to 8 describe a further embodiment of the pack according to the invention in conjunction with a corresponding blank. The pack is a so-called round-edged pack 69 with a blank 70 provided therefor. In order to avoid repetitions, the designations are otherwise retained. Upright rounding regions 71, 72, 73, 74 are depicted only in the region of the otherwise provided longitudinal folding lines. The rest of the blank parts are adapted thereto. The folding gussets 58, 59 are thus somewhat wider. Oblique edges 60 and 61 begin outside the rounding regions 72 and 73 and run<br><br>
from there as far as the severing cuts DO , o / approximately in the form of a V (or once the collar has been folded over, in the form of an upside-down V).<br>
Naturally, the tabs 19 to 22, 33 to 36 and 31, 37, 38 also begin outside the rounding regions 71 to 74. The outer longitudinal tab 19 and the cover tab 33 are designed in a specific manner here. These are each of a size which corresponds to the associated top wall 32 and base wall 18. Correspondingly, the two tabs 19, 33 extend into imaginary extensions of the rounding regions 71 to 73 by way of border regions.<br>
The finished pack 69 contains two rows of round-edged hinge-lid boxes (cigarette packs), as in figure 4. The radii of the rounding regions 71 to 74 are adapted to the radii of the round edges of the individual cigarette packs. Empty spaces are avoided as far as possible. At the same time, the outer appearance of the pack 69 gives an immediate indication of the pack contents.<br>
Figures 9 to 12, finally, show a pack according to the invention embodied as an octagonal pack 75 with a hinge lid. The designations, once again, have been retained. With the exception of the longitudinal folds. There, this exemplary embodiment provides narrow folding strips 76 to 79 which each have 45°-folding lines on both sides. The individual tabs 19 to 22, 25 to 28, 33 to 36 and the folding gussets 58, 59 are designed analogously to figure 5. In the same way as in figure 5, on the blank 80 in figure 9, the transitions between the walls and the adjacent tabs are adapted to the shape of the folded regions, in this case to the folding strips 76 to 79.<br>
The contents provided are two rows with five octagonal hinge-lid packs (cigarette packs) each. The width of the  folding  strips  76  to  79  is  adapted  to  the<br><br>
corresponding folding strips of the individual octagonal packs. Once again, an indication of the cigarette packs which are provided as the contents is given by the outer form of the octagonal pack 7 5 alone, see figure 12. Analogously to the configurations following figures 1 to 4, it is also possible for the packs 69 and 75 to be configured with or without a lid inner tab 29 and corresponding cutout 30.<br>
Figures 13 to 15 show the arrangement of the collar side tabs 37, 38 within the finished packs 10, 69 and<br>
75.	The collar side tabs are dimensioned in terms of<br>
their width such that they butt against the side walls<br>
16, 17 in the region of the same and do not extend into<br>
the region of the rear folds in each case. In figure 5,<br>
the so-called rear folds are identical to the rounding<br>
regions 71 and 74 and, in figure 9, they are identical<br>
to the folding strips 76 and 79. The collar side tabs<br>
37, 3 8 terminate in each case before the beginning of<br>
the rounding regions 71, 74 and of the folding strips<br>
76,	79. It is likewise the case, according to<br>
figure 13, that the collar side tabs 37, 38 only extend<br>
in the region of the side wall 16, 17 and not in the<br>
region of the rear wall 15.<br>
Figure 16 shows a modified blank 81, namely a modification of the blank according to figure 1. With an otherwise identical configuration, the connecting strip 23 adjoins the rear wall 15 rather than the side wall 17. The reason for this is to facilitate handling as the folding operations are carried out and the pack is filled. Once the lid inner tab 29 and collar 13 have been folded over, a group of cigarette packs, which is provided as the contents, is positioned in front of the blank, to be precise with a group narrow side in front of the corresponding side wall 16 and the lid side wall 27, behind the image plane in figure 16. The unit comprising the blank and pack group is then pushed into the pocket of a folding turret, with the blank being<br><br>
folded in U-form and parts of the blWik butting against corresponding sides of the pack group. It is then merely the side wall 17 and the connecting strip 23 (in the case of the configuration according to figure 16) which project beyond the pack group. It is possible for these to be folded over, by straightforward folding-element movements, in order to form the as-yet missing side wall and to be adhesively bonded to one another.<br>
The different folding tabs are preferably formed such that an at most two-layered wrapper is always produced. In order for this to be possible even in the region of the  collar,   the  connecting  strip  23,.  in  the configuration according to figure 16,  has a lateral cutout 82. This is dimensioned such that it only just leaves  enough  space  for  the  collar  side  tab  38. Figure 17 shows this clearly. There,  the collar has already been folded downward through 180°. The collar side tab 38 butts on the inside, in part, against the lid side wall 28 and, in part, against the side wall 17. The width of the collar side tab 38 is somewhat smaller than the width of the abovementioned walls 28, 17. The width difference is somewhat greater than the width 83 of the connecting strip 23 in this region. The height of the cutout 82 (and/or length of the same) is somewhat greater than the height of the collar side tab 38. As a result, none of the regions of the connecting strip 23 comes to rest on the collar side tab 38, with the result that exclusively two-layered packaging is produced even in the collar region.<br>
In respect of the position of the connecting strip 23 and as far as the cutout 82 is concerned, the modification shown may be used, in turn, for all the exemplary embodiments described.<br>
Alongside the abovedescribed use of the packs according to the invention as packaging for groups of cigarette packs,  it is also possible for the packaging to be<br><br>
dimensioned differently and to be envisaged for accommodating other types of articles.<br>
Figures 18 to 23 relate to a further configuration of a cigarette multipack. A pack 100 has a wrapper which is formed from a blank 101 and is made of the abovementioned material. A group of cigarette packs is arranged in the interior of the pack. The cigarette packs are in the manner of the so-called round-edged packs, in each case with a hinge lid which is articulated on a rear wall of the respective cigarette pack.<br>
In the blank 101, a large-surface-area wide front wall<br>
102	and a similarly large rear wall 103 are connected to one another by a long and narrow base wall 104. On the side opposite to the base wall 104, the rear wall<br>
103	is adjoined by a large cover tab 105 and a front wall 102 is adjoined by a small cover tab 106.<br>
The base wall 104 and large cover tab 105 each have a form corresponding to the outer contour of the pack and thus each extend over the entire surface area. In contrast, rather than extending over the entire width of a top wall 107 of the pack, the small cover tab 106 only extends over approximately half the width. In the closed pack 100, the small cover tab 106 comes to rest beneath the large cover tab 105, and is in particular adhesively bonded thereto. In addition, the small cover tab 106 is of trapezoidal design with its length decreasing in the direction of its free border 108.<br>
In order to form the end walls, the large rear wall 103 is adj oined by end tabs 109, 110 on both sides. Analogously to this, the large front wall 102 is provided with connecting strips 111, 112 on both sides and the base wall 104 is provided with base tabs 113, 114 on both sides. In order to form the end walls 115, 116 - once the front wall 102 and rear wall 103 have<br><br>
been erected relative to the base wall 104 - the connecting strips 111, 112 and base tabs 113, 114 are folded into a common plane and the end tabs 109, 110 are then turned over or folded thereon. The connecting strips 111, 112 and base tabs 113, 114 are configured such that they may be located in the same plane without overlapping one another. For this purpose, the connecting strips are of essentially trapezoidal design, at least with an oblique edge 117 adjacent to the base tabs. Analogously thereto, the base tabs 113, 114 each have an oblique mating edge 118. With the blank 101 in spread-out state, there is an angle of at least 90° or more between the edges 117, 118.<br>
So-called round edges 119, 120 are provided in the region of the transitions between the large walls (front wall 102, rear wall 103) and the adjacent end tabs 109, 110 as well as connecting strips 111, 112. The radius of said round edges is somewhat larger than the radius of the round edges on the cigarette packs which are provided as the contents. The base wall 104 and cover tab 105 are provided with roundings corresponding to the radius of the round edges 119, 120.<br>
The base tabs 113, 114 are configured, and arranged on the base wall 104, in a specific manner, see figure 19. The base wall 104 terminates laterally with rectilinear border portions 122, which are each adjoined by rounded borders 121 on both sides. The radius of the latter corresponds to the radius of the round edges 119, 120.<br>
The base tabs 113, 114 are somewhat narrower than the dimensions a of the rectilinear border portions 122. Located between the base tabs 113, 114 and the rounded borders 121 in each case are short rectilinear intermediate border portions 123, 124 with the dimensions b, with the result that, for example, the base  tab  114  has  a  dimension  c = a - 2b  in  the<br><br>
direction of the width of the end wall 115. The arrangement of the intermediate border portions 123, 124 facilitates the production of the pack in this region. Overlapping of connecting strips 111, 112 and base tabs 113, 114 is thus ruled out. In this case, it is possible to punch out the connecting strips 111, 112 in the region of the transition to the round edges 120 without a concave, i.e. only with a convex, outline.<br>
Figure 23 shows the arrangement of base tab 113 and connecting strip 111 relative to one another in the finished pack 100. A gap 125 is clearly visible between the oblique edge 117 and mating edge 118. The gap corresponds approximately to a projection of the dimension of the intermediate border portion 123 parallel to the edges 117, 118. Likewise clearly visible is the reduced width of the base tab 113 in relation to the width of the end wall, also minus the round edges 119, 120. Finally, the trapezoidal form of the connecting strip 111 is clearly visible. A free edge 12 6 of the connecting strip 111, said edge coming to rest just beneath the top wall 107 in the finished pack 100, is directed obliquely at a somewhat smaller angle than the oblique edge 117.<br>
The arrangement of the tabs 110, 114, 112 relative to one another is clearly visible in the horizontal section of figure 22. The base tab 114 and connecting strip 112 are located in the same plane on the inside and are adhesively bonded to the outer end tab 110. The latter extends over virtually the entire width of the end wall 115, but not beyond the round edge 120. Overlapping only takes place with the connecting strip 112.<br>
The small cover tab 106 extends exclusively outside the round edges 120 and thus not over the entire length of the pack.<br><br>
The "round-edged" cigarette multipack described with reference to figures 18 to 23 may also be designed as an "octagonal" cigarette multipack. In this case, two 45°-folds separated by a narrow strip are provided instead of the round edges 119, 120. The rounded borders 121 shown in figure 19 have to be replaced by obliquely directed (rectilinear) borders between two 45° angles. The same applies to the configuration of the cover tab 105.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to a pack having a group of cigarette packs - cigarette multipack-and a wrapper therefor and a blank for producing the said pack, the latter being produced by being folded from an, in particular, single-piece blank.<br>
For transportation purposes and, as appropriate, also for subsequent sales purposes, cigarette packs are combined to form so-called cigarette multipacks and, in the process, are provided with an accommodating wrapper (said wrapper accommodating the entire group). Various possible options are known for the configuration of the wrapper. It is not usually possible to see the contents, namely the cigarette packs. In addition, it is difficult to draw conclusions as to the contents from the outer configuration.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a pack of which the configuration makes it possible to draw conclusions as to the contents. In addition, the intention is for it to be possible for the pack to be produced as efficiently as possible in high-speed packaging machines.<br>
The pack according to the invention is characterized in that the wrapper is configured in the manner of a wrapper for a hinge-lid pack. The cigarette packs provided as the contents are preferably so-called hinge-lid packs with a box part, having a large upright front wall, a hinge lid, and a collar or analogously configured so-called soft carton packs. According to the invention, the wrapper of the cigarette multipack is likewise configured in the manner of a hinge-lid pack, in particular in the manner of the abovedescribed upright hinge-lid cigarette pack. The pack has the<br><br>
outward appearance of a larger version of the small packs provided as the contents. This gives a clear indication of the contents at first glance.<br>
In contrast to the hinge-lid cigarette packs which are common throughout the world - the wrapper is constructed in accordance with the so-called transverse-folding principle. In this case, a large front wall (even in the non-folded state) is connected to a large rear wall via an upright narrow first side wall. The front wall is also preferably connected to a second narrow side wall.<br>
The rear wall and one of the side walls are connected to one another via an additional connecting strip. It is possible for the latter to adjoin the second side wall or the rear wall and to be adhesively bonded to the respectively other wall. In respect of the pack being produced in as an efficient a manner as possible, it is advantageous for the connecting strip to be arranged on the rear wall. During production of the pack, a group of cigarette packs is positioned on the first side wall and pushed into a pocket of a folding subassembly with the wrapper, which folds in the form of a U in the process. The pocket walls of the folding subassembly are dimensioned such that it is possible for the second side wall and the connecting strip to project out of the pocket and to be folded one upon the other by corresponding folding elements.<br>
The wrapper or the blank provided therefor is of single-piece design. This means that the lid and collar form part of the blank. In this case, the walls which are provided for forming the lid adjoin at the top of the walls which are provided for forming the box part. Moreover, the parts which are provided for the collar are arranged above the lid walls. In this case, connections are provided between the collar and lid walls,  in  particular  in  the  region  of  upright<br><br>
longitudinal folding lines, by correspondingly provided material webs between collar and lid walls. During production of the pack, the collar is folded downward through 180° and comes to rest, in part, on walls of the box part and, in part, on walls of the lid. Adhesive bonding, naturally, is only provided in the region of the box part. The material webs provided between the collar and lid tear open when the pack is opened for the first time.<br>
In the region of a lid front wall, a lid inner tab is folded inward. The latter is punched out in the region of the transition between the lid front wall and front wall of the box part. This correspondingly produces, on the finished pack, a cutout, between the lid front wall and box part, which is equal to the size of the lid inner tab and is concealed on the inside by the collar front wall. The latter may be provided here with an inscription-Hinge- lid cigarette packs, meanwhile, are available in three different versions, namely, with relatively sharp 90°-edges in the region .of the upright longitudinal folding lines, as so-called round-edged packs and as so-called octagonal packs. The pack according to the invention may also be designed in the manner of these three versions.  It  is preferable  for  the  type  of cigarette packs which are provided as the contents to correspond  precisely  to  the  type  of  cigarette multipack.<br>
Further features of the invention can be gathered from the claims. These also include packaging for accommodating a group of cigarette packs and a blank for forming a cigarette multipack.<br>
The invention also relates to a pack having a wrapper and a group of cigarette packs - cigarette multipack -the wrapper being produced by being folded from an, in<br><br>
particular, single-piece blank and having a base wall, narrow upright side walls, a top wall, and a large-surface-area (wide) front wall and rear wall. This specific pack is characterized in that, in the region of the transitions between the front wall and end walls and/or rear wall and end walls, rounded regions - round edges - or folds which are adjacent to one another with a small spacing therebetween for forming an octagonal pack are provided instead of "sharp" 90° folds.<br>
Here too, an essential aspect of the invention is that the outer form of the pack gives an indication of the contents. The contents thus comprise known round-edged packs for cigarettes, in particular with a hinged lid in each case.  The grouping of the cigarette packs corresponds  to  that  of  a  conventional  cigarette multipack, namely two rows with five packs each, the cigarette  packs  within  a  row butting  against  one another by way of their narrow sides, and the packs of adjacent rows butting against one another by way of large-surface-area walls  (front wall or rear wall). Correspondingly,  the group of cigarette packs have upright round edges. These come to rest on the inside of  the round edges of  the pack according to  the invention. Unnecessary cavities are thus avoided. It is also the case that the pack overall is relatively stable since it is precisely -in the region of the round edges that the round edges of the cigarette packs abut on the inside and give additional support.<br>
Special features are provided in respect of the configuration of tabs for forming the upright narrow end walls, in particular in respect of the tabs which are connected to the base wall (base tabs).<br>
Naturally, the packaging and the blank are also claimed in addition to the pack.<br><br>
In the same way as the pack according to the invention mentioned in the introduction -the wrapper consists of foldable material, in particular of thin cardboard, strong paper or the like.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a pack having a group of cigarette packs -cigarette multipack - and a wrapper therefor, made of an, in particular, single-piece blank, the wrapper being configured in the manner of a wrapper for a hinge-lid cigarette pack, characterized by a design as a round-edged pack or octagonal pack, i.e. with upright rounded regions instead of the conventional upright longitudinal folding lines or with upright double longitudinal folding lines, which are connected by a narrow folding strip, instead of the conventional upright longitudinal folding lines, it being the case that, with a configuration as a round-edged pack, round-edged cigarette packs are provided as the contents, with upright round edges of the cigarette packs arranged along the upright rounded regions of the pack, and it being the case that, with the pack being configured as an octagonal pack, octagonal cigarette packs are provided as the contents, with upright narrow folding strips of the cigarette packs arranged along the upright folding strips of the pack.<br>

according to figure 20.<br>
Figure 2 shows a pack 10 according to the invention, of which the outer form corresponds to that of an upright, conventional and commonly used hinge-lid box for cigarettes. A bottom box part 11 is closed by a top lid 12. Fastened in the box part 11, and projecting upward out of the latter, is a collar 13, the region which<br><br>
projects out of the box part 11 being enclosed by the lid 12 in the closed position.<br>
The box part 11 has a large front wall 14, a rear wall 15, narrow side walls 16 and 17 and a base wall 18. The latter is formed by an outer longitudinal tab 19 which adjoins the front wall 14 at the bottom, by an inner longitudinal tab 20 which adjoins the rear wall 15 at the bottom and by corner tabs, 21, 22 which adjoin the side walls. These three last-mentioned tabs 20 to 22 are formed such that they cannot overlap one another and thus come to rest precisely in the same plane. It is only the outer longitudinal tab 19 which covers the other three tabs. A two-layered base wall 18 is thus produced overall.<br>
On the side opposite to the front wall 14, the right-hand side wall 17 is adjoined by a connecting strip 23. During production of the pack 10 to the finished state, said connecting strip is connected to the rear wall 15 on the inside. On account of the blank parts 14 to 17 being folded via the side walls 16, 17, the pack 10 or a blank 24 therefor are also referred to as a "transverse-folding" pack or blank.<br>
The blank 24 is configured in one piece with the corresponding parts for the box part 11, the lid 12 and the collar 13. The already mentioned walls 15 to 17 are adjoined at the top by corresponding lid walls, namely a lid front wall 25, a lid rear wall 26 and lid side walls 27, 28. The lid front wall 25 is adjoined at the bottom - in the region of the transition to the front wall 14 - by a so-called lid inner tab 29 which, in the finished pack, is folded inward into abutment against the lid front wall 25. This means that between the lid front wall 25 and front wall 14, the finished pack 10 has a cutout 30, although it is closed by a collar front wall 31.<br><br>
En order to form a lid top wall <br>
at the same time) , the blank 24 is provided with a :over tab 33 which adjoins the lid rear wall 26 at the top, with an inner cover tab 34 which adjoins the lid front wall 25 at the top, and with side tabs 35, 36. Analogously to the base wall 18, it is also the case that the lid top wall 32 is only of two-layered design. For thi s purpose, the tabs 34 to 3 6 have a corresponding configuration, with the result that they do not overlap one another.<br>
The tabs 34 to 3 6 are adj oined at the top by blank parts for forming the collar 13, namely the already mentioned collar front wall 31 above the inner cover tab 34 and collar side tabs 37, 38. An upright folding line 39 is formed between the collar side tab 37 and collar front wall 31, and a folding line 40 is formed between the collar front wall 31 and collar side tab 38. Parallel to the abovementioned folding lines, and more or less in alignment therewith (offset slightly in the outward direction), corresponding longitudinal folding lines 41, 42 are respectively arranged between the side wall 16 and front wall 14 and between the front wall 14 and side wall 17.<br>
According to figure 1, the blank parts which are provided for forming the lid 12 are already separated, in part, from the box part 11 by severing cuts and are only attached to one another still in the region of residual connections. Corresponding severing cuts 43, 44 and 45 are provided between the lid side walls 27, 28, and the respectively adjacent side walls 16, 17 and between the lid inner tab 29 and the front wall 14. The severing cut 44 on the bottom border of the lid inner tab 29, at the same time, defines the shape of the cutout 30. An articulation line 46 is depicted between the lid rear wall 26 and rear wall 15. The severing cuts 43, 45 which are provided in the region of the side  walls  are  not  continuous.  Rather  residual<br><br>
connections, namely material webs 47 ana 48, which interrupt the respective severing cuts, are provided. Naturally, the severing cuts 43, 44 and 45 adjoin one another. When the pack is opened for the first time, the material webs 47, 48 are severed or torn apart from one another, with the result that web remnants 49, 50 are produced on the initially interconnected pack parts namely side walls 16, 17, on the one hand, and lid side walls 27, 28 on the other hand, see figures 3 and 4.<br>
The collar 13 adjoins the lid in the region of the tabs 34 to 36, Collar side tabs 37, 38 are separated off from the collar front wall 31 by the upright folding lines. Provided between the collar front wall 31 and the inner cover tab 34 is a severing cut 54, which defines the configuration of a visible cutout 51 in the collar front wall and a top border of the same. The cutout 51 is bounded laterally by upright ridges 52, 53. The severing cut 54 is interrupted by residual connections 55 between the ridges 52,53. Severing cuts<br>
56,	57 are likewise provided between the collar side<br>
tabs 37, 38 and lid side tabs 35, 36.<br>
Finally, a special feature is provided in the region of the transition between the severing cuts 56, 54 and 54,<br>
57.	The folding lines 39, 40 cross here. Moreover, so-<br>
called folding gussets 58, 59 are formed. These are of<br>
triangular or trapezoidal design and produce the<br>
connection between the collar 13 and the lid 12. In the<br>
spread-out blank 24, the folding gussets 57, 58 are<br>
respectively located precisely between the side tab 35<br>
and inner cover tab 34 and between the inner cover tab<br>
34 and side tab 36. Correspondingly, the abovementioned<br>
tabs in this region have oblique edges 60 (side tabs 35<br>
and 36) and likewise obliquely directed mating edges 61<br>
(inner cover tab 34) . The folding gussets 58, 59 here<br>
are connected to the collar side tabs 37, 38 and to the<br>
collar front wall at least via residual connections and<br>
are also attached to the lid 12 via a narrow material<br><br>
web 62 in the region of the folding lines 41, 42 in<br>
each case.<br>
During production of the pack, the areas of glue which are necessary for fixing the lid inner tab 2 9 and collar 13 are applied first of all. The lid inner tab 29 is then folded through 180° against the lid front wall 25. Thereafter, the collar 13 is folded downward in the rearward direction out of the position according to figure 1, and out of the image plane, to be precise around the material webs 62, with the result that the collar side tabs 37 and 38, in part, butt against the inside of the side walls 16, 17 and in part, project beyond the same, see figure 3. The collar front wall 31 still comes to rest on the front wall 14, beneath the severing cut 44, by way of a narrow strip 63 and otherwise projects upward beyond the front wall, see figures 3 and 4.<br>
The folding gussets 58, 59 are bounded in the upward direction, i.e. between the severing lines 56, 57 and 54, in figure 1 by severing cuts 64, 65, which continue the abovementioned lines and, in turn, are interrupted in each case by residual connections, namely material webs 66, 67. When the packaging is opened for the first time, the material webs 66, 67 are severed, while the folding gussets 58, 59 remain attached to the inside of the lid. The folding gussets are thus preferably connected to corresponding blank regions of the lid by adhesive bonding.<br>
The rest of the folding of the blank and the rest of the production of the pack are carried out in accordance with the production process.<br>
The finished pack contains two rows, each with five conventional cigarette hinge-lid boxes, in each case with sharp upright 90°-folding edges, corresponding to the longitudinal folding lines 41, 42.<br><br>
In the finished pack, the folding gussets 58, 59 come to rest inside the pack, to be precise respectively between the lid side wall 27 and lid front wall 25 and between the lid front wall 25 and lid side wall 28.<br>
As can be seen in figure 4, the individual cigarette packs in each row are arranged to butt closely against one another by way of the large walls (front wall and rear wall). Correspondingly, the dimensions of the pack 10 overall are such that the width of the pack corresponds approximately to the depth of five single cigarette packs, the depth of the pack corresponds approximately to the width of a single cigarette pack and the height corresponds to the height of two cigarette packs positioned one above the other. The upright longitudinal edges of the respectively outer cigarette packs come to rest adjacent and parallel to the upright longitudinal edges (lines 41, 42) of the pack. The material used for the blank 24 is thin cardboard or stiff paper. It is actually possible to use any foldable material.<br>
In an embodiment which is not shown, the lid inner tab 29 is not provided. Instead, the front wall 14 extends over a correspondingly greater height, namely as far as the now provided folding line 68 between the lid front wall 25 and the lid inner tab 29.<br>
Figures 5 to 8 describe a further embodiment of the pack according to the invention in conjunction with a corresponding blank. The pack is a so-called round-edged pack 69 with a blank 70 provided therefor. In order to avoid repetitions, the designations are otherwise retained. Upright rounding regions 71, 72, 73, 74 are depicted only in the region of the otherwise provided longitudinal folding lines. The rest of the blank parts are adapted thereto. The folding gussets 58, 59 are thus somewhat wider. Oblique edges 60 and 61 begin outside the rounding regions 72 and 73 and run<br><br>
from there as far as the severing cuts DO , o / approximately in the form of a V (or once the collar has been folded over, in the form of an upside-down V).<br>
Naturally, the tabs 19 to 22, 33 to 36 and 31, 37, 38 also begin outside the rounding regions 71 to 74. The outer longitudinal tab 19 and the cover tab 33 are designed in a specific manner here. These are each of a size which corresponds to the associated top wall 32 and base wall 18. Correspondingly, the two tabs 19, 33 extend into imaginary extensions of the rounding regions 71 to 73 by way of border regions.<br>
The finished pack 69 contains two rows of round-edged hinge-lid boxes (cigarette packs), as in figure 4. The radii of the rounding regions 71 to 74 are adapted to the radii of the round edges of the individual cigarette packs. Empty spaces are avoided as far as possible. At the same time, the outer appearance of the pack 69 gives an immediate indication of the pack contents.<br>
Figures 9 to 12, finally, show a pack according to the invention embodied as an octagonal pack 75 with a hinge lid. The designations, once again, have been retained. With the exception of the longitudinal folds. There, this exemplary embodiment provides narrow folding strips 76 to 79 which each have 45°-folding lines on both sides. The individual tabs 19 to 22, 25 to 28, 33 to 36 and the folding gussets 58, 59 are designed analogously to figure 5. In the same way as in figure 5, on the blank 80 in figure 9, the transitions between the walls and the adjacent tabs are adapted to the shape of the folded regions, in this case to the folding strips 76 to 79.<br>
The contents provided are two rows with five octagonal hinge-lid packs (cigarette packs) each. The width of the  folding  strips  76  to  79  is  adapted  to  the<br><br>
corresponding folding strips of the individual octagonal packs. Once again, an indication of the cigarette packs which are provided as the contents is given by the outer form of the octagonal pack 7 5 alone, see figure 12. Analogously to the configurations following figures 1 to 4, it is also possible for the packs 69 and 75 to be configured with or without a lid inner tab 29 and corresponding cutout 30.<br>
Figures 13 to 15 show the arrangement of the collar side tabs 37, 38 within the finished packs 10, 69 and<br>
75.	The collar side tabs are dimensioned in terms of<br>
their width such that they butt against the side walls<br>
16, 17 in the region of the same and do not extend into<br>
the region of the rear folds in each case. In figure 5,<br>
the so-called rear folds are identical to the rounding<br>
regions 71 and 74 and, in figure 9, they are identical<br>
to the folding strips 76 and 79. The collar side tabs<br>
37, 3 8 terminate in each case before the beginning of<br>
the rounding regions 71, 74 and of the folding strips<br>
76,	79. It is likewise the case, according to<br>
figure 13, that the collar side tabs 37, 38 only extend<br>
in the region of the side wall 16, 17 and not in the<br>
region of the rear wall 15.<br>
Figure 16 shows a modified blank 81, namely a modification of the blank according to figure 1. With an otherwise identical configuration, the connecting strip 23 adjoins the rear wall 15 rather than the side wall 17. The reason for this is to facilitate handling as the folding operations are carried out and the pack is filled. Once the lid inner tab 29 and collar 13 have been folded over, a group of cigarette packs, which is provided as the contents, is positioned in front of the blank, to be precise with a group narrow side in front of the corresponding side wall 16 and the lid side wall 27, behind the image plane in figure 16. The unit comprising the blank and pack group is then pushed into the pocket of a folding turret, with the blank being<br><br>
folded in U-form and parts of the blWik butting against corresponding sides of the pack group. It is then merely the side wall 17 and the connecting strip 23 (in the case of the configuration according to figure 16) which project beyond the pack group. It is possible for these to be folded over, by straightforward folding-element movements, in order to form the as-yet missing side wall and to be adhesively bonded to one another.<br>
The different folding tabs are preferably formed such that an at most two-layered wrapper is always produced. In order for this to be possible even in the region of the  collar,   the  connecting  strip  23,.  in  the configuration according to figure 16,  has a lateral cutout 82. This is dimensioned such that it only just leaves  enough  space  for  the  collar  side  tab  38. Figure 17 shows this clearly. There,  the collar has already been folded downward through 180°. The collar side tab 38 butts on the inside, in part, against the lid side wall 28 and, in part, against the side wall 17. The width of the collar side tab 38 is somewhat smaller than the width of the abovementioned walls 28, 17. The width difference is somewhat greater than the width 83 of the connecting strip 23 in this region. The height of the cutout 82 (and/or length of the same) is somewhat greater than the height of the collar side tab 38. As a result, none of the regions of the connecting strip 23 comes to rest on the collar side tab 38, with the result that exclusively two-layered packaging is produced even in the collar region.<br>
In respect of the position of the connecting strip 23 and as far as the cutout 82 is concerned, the modification shown may be used, in turn, for all the exemplary embodiments described.<br>
Alongside the abovedescribed use of the packs according to the invention as packaging for groups of cigarette packs,  it is also possible for the packaging to be<br><br>
dimensioned differently and to be envisaged for accommodating other types of articles.<br>
Figures 18 to 23 relate to a further configuration of a cigarette multipack. A pack 100 has a wrapper which is formed from a blank 101 and is made of the abovementioned material. A group of cigarette packs is arranged in the interior of the pack. The cigarette packs are in the manner of the so-called round-edged packs, in each case with a hinge lid which is articulated on a rear wall of the respective cigarette pack.<br>
In the blank 101, a large-surface-area wide front wall<br>
102	and a similarly large rear wall 103 are connected to one another by a long and narrow base wall 104. On the side opposite to the base wall 104, the rear wall<br>
103	is adjoined by a large cover tab 105 and a front wall 102 is adjoined by a small cover tab 106.<br>
The base wall 104 and large cover tab 105 each have a form corresponding to the outer contour of the pack and thus each extend over the entire surface area. In contrast, rather than extending over the entire width of a top wall 107 of the pack, the small cover tab 106 only extends over approximately half the width. In the closed pack 100, the small cover tab 106 comes to rest beneath the large cover tab 105, and is in particular adhesively bonded thereto. In addition, the small cover tab 106 is of trapezoidal design with its length decreasing in the direction of its free border 108.<br>
In order to form the end walls, the large rear wall 103 is adj oined by end tabs 109, 110 on both sides. Analogously to this, the large front wall 102 is provided with connecting strips 111, 112 on both sides and the base wall 104 is provided with base tabs 113, 114 on both sides. In order to form the end walls 115, 116 - once the front wall 102 and rear wall 103 have<br><br>
been erected relative to the base wall 104 - the connecting strips 111, 112 and base tabs 113, 114 are folded into a common plane and the end tabs 109, 110 are then turned over or folded thereon. The connecting strips 111, 112 and base tabs 113, 114 are configured such that they may be located in the same plane without overlapping one another. For this purpose, the connecting strips are of essentially trapezoidal design, at least with an oblique edge 117 adjacent to the base tabs. Analogously thereto, the base tabs 113, 114 each have an oblique mating edge 118. With the blank 101 in spread-out state, there is an angle of at least 90° or more between the edges 117, 118.<br>
So-called round edges 119, 120 are provided in the region of the transitions between the large walls (front wall 102, rear wall 103) and the adjacent end tabs 109, 110 as well as connecting strips 111, 112. The radius of said round edges is somewhat larger than the radius of the round edges on the cigarette packs which are provided as the contents. The base wall 104 and cover tab 105 are provided with roundings corresponding to the radius of the round edges 119, 120.<br>
The base tabs 113, 114 are configured, and arranged on the base wall 104, in a specific manner, see figure 19. The base wall 104 terminates laterally with rectilinear border portions 122, which are each adjoined by rounded borders 121 on both sides. The radius of the latter corresponds to the radius of the round edges 119, 120.<br>
The base tabs 113, 114 are somewhat narrower than the dimensions a of the rectilinear border portions 122. Located between the base tabs 113, 114 and the rounded borders 121 in each case are short rectilinear intermediate border portions 123, 124 with the dimensions b, with the result that, for example, the base  tab  114  has  a  dimension  c = a - 2b  in  the<br><br>
direction of the width of the end wall 115. The arrangement of the intermediate border portions 123, 124 facilitates the production of the pack in this region. Overlapping of connecting strips 111, 112 and base tabs 113, 114 is thus ruled out. In this case, it is possible to punch out the connecting strips 111, 112 in the region of the transition to the round edges 120 without a concave, i.e. only with a convex, outline.<br>
Figure 23 shows the arrangement of base tab 113 and connecting strip 111 relative to one another in the finished pack 100. A gap 125 is clearly visible between the oblique edge 117 and mating edge 118. The gap corresponds approximately to a projection of the dimension of the intermediate border portion 123 parallel to the edges 117, 118. Likewise clearly visible is the reduced width of the base tab 113 in relation to the width of the end wall, also minus the round edges 119, 120. Finally, the trapezoidal form of the connecting strip 111 is clearly visible. A free edge 12 6 of the connecting strip 111, said edge coming to rest just beneath the top wall 107 in the finished pack 100, is directed obliquely at a somewhat smaller angle than the oblique edge 117.<br>
The arrangement of the tabs 110, 114, 112 relative to one another is clearly visible in the horizontal section of figure 22. The base tab 114 and connecting strip 112 are located in the same plane on the inside and are adhesively bonded to the outer end tab 110. The latter extends over virtually the entire width of the end wall 115, but not beyond the round edge 120. Overlapping only takes place with the connecting strip 112.<br>
The small cover tab 106 extends exclusively outside the round edges 120 and thus not over the entire length of the pack.<br><br>
The "round-edged" cigarette multipack described with reference to figures 18 to 23 may also be designed as an "octagonal" cigarette multipack. In this case, two 45°-folds separated by a narrow strip are provided instead of the round edges 119, 120. The rounded borders 121 shown in figure 19 have to be replaced by obliquely directed (rectilinear) borders between two 45° angles. The same applies to the configuration of the cover tab 105.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to a pack having a group of cigarette packs - cigarette multipack-and a wrapper therefor and a blank for producing the said pack, the latter being produced by being folded from an, in particular, single-piece blank.<br>
For transportation purposes and, as appropriate, also for subsequent sales purposes, cigarette packs are combined to form so-called cigarette multipacks and, in the process, are provided with an accommodating wrapper (said wrapper accommodating the entire group). Various possible options are known for the configuration of the wrapper. It is not usually possible to see the contents, namely the cigarette packs. In addition, it is difficult to draw conclusions as to the contents from the outer configuration.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a pack of which the configuration makes it possible to draw conclusions as to the contents. In addition, the intention is for it to be possible for the pack to be produced as efficiently as possible in high-speed packaging machines.<br>
The pack according to the invention is characterized in that the wrapper is configured in the manner of a wrapper for a hinge-lid pack. The cigarette packs provided as the contents are preferably so-called hinge-lid packs with a box part, having a large upright front wall, a hinge lid, and a collar or analogously configured so-called soft carton packs. According to the invention, the wrapper of the cigarette multipack is likewise configured in the manner of a hinge-lid pack, in particular in the manner of the abovedescribed upright hinge-lid cigarette pack. The pack has the<br><br>
outward appearance of a larger version of the small packs provided as the contents. This gives a clear indication of the contents at first glance.<br>
In contrast to the hinge-lid cigarette packs which are common throughout the world - the wrapper is constructed in accordance with the so-called transverse-folding principle. In this case, a large front wall (even in the non-folded state) is connected to a large rear wall via an upright narrow first side wall. The front wall is also preferably connected to a second narrow side wall.<br>
The rear wall and one of the side walls are connected to one another via an additional connecting strip. It is possible for the latter to adjoin the second side wall or the rear wall and to be adhesively bonded to the respectively other wall. In respect of the pack being produced in as an efficient a manner as possible, it is advantageous for the connecting strip to be arranged on the rear wall. During production of the pack, a group of cigarette packs is positioned on the first side wall and pushed into a pocket of a folding subassembly with the wrapper, which folds in the form of a U in the process. The pocket walls of the folding subassembly are dimensioned such that it is possible for the second side wall and the connecting strip to project out of the pocket and to be folded one upon the other by corresponding folding elements.<br>
The wrapper or the blank provided therefor is of single-piece design. This means that the lid and collar form part of the blank. In this case, the walls which are provided for forming the lid adjoin at the top of the walls which are provided for forming the box part. Moreover, the parts which are provided for the collar are arranged above the lid walls. In this case, connections are provided between the collar and lid walls,  in  particular  in  the  region  of  upright<br><br>
longitudinal folding lines, by correspondingly provided material webs between collar and lid walls. During production of the pack, the collar is folded downward through 180° and comes to rest, in part, on walls of the box part and, in part, on walls of the lid. Adhesive bonding, naturally, is only provided in the region of the box part. The material webs provided between the collar and lid tear open when the pack is opened for the first time.<br>
In the region of a lid front wall, a lid inner tab is folded inward. The latter is punched out in the region of the transition between the lid front wall and front wall of the box part. This correspondingly produces, on the finished pack, a cutout, between the lid front wall and box part, which is equal to the size of the lid inner tab and is concealed on the inside by the collar front wall. The latter may be provided here with an inscription-Hinge- lid cigarette packs, meanwhile, are available in three different versions, namely, with relatively sharp 90°-edges in the region .of the upright longitudinal folding lines, as so-called round-edged packs and as so-called octagonal packs. The pack according to the invention may also be designed in the manner of these three versions.  It  is preferable  for  the  type  of cigarette packs which are provided as the contents to correspond  precisely  to  the  type  of  cigarette multipack.<br>
Further features of the invention can be gathered from the claims. These also include packaging for accommodating a group of cigarette packs and a blank for forming a cigarette multipack.<br>
The invention also relates to a pack having a wrapper and a group of cigarette packs - cigarette multipack -the wrapper being produced by being folded from an, in<br><br>
particular, single-piece blank and having a base wall, narrow upright side walls, a top wall, and a large-surface-area (wide) front wall and rear wall. This specific pack is characterized in that, in the region of the transitions between the front wall and end walls and/or rear wall and end walls, rounded regions - round edges - or folds which are adjacent to one another with a small spacing therebetween for forming an octagonal pack are provided instead of "sharp" 90° folds.<br>
Here too, an essential aspect of the invention is that the outer form of the pack gives an indication of the contents. The contents thus comprise known round-edged packs for cigarettes, in particular with a hinged lid in each case.  The grouping of the cigarette packs corresponds  to  that  of  a  conventional  cigarette multipack, namely two rows with five packs each, the cigarette  packs  within  a  row butting  against  one another by way of their narrow sides, and the packs of adjacent rows butting against one another by way of large-surface-area walls  (front wall or rear wall). Correspondingly,  the group of cigarette packs have upright round edges. These come to rest on the inside of  the round edges of  the pack according to  the invention. Unnecessary cavities are thus avoided. It is also the case that the pack overall is relatively stable since it is precisely -in the region of the round edges that the round edges of the cigarette packs abut on the inside and give additional support.<br>
Special features are provided in respect of the configuration of tabs for forming the upright narrow end walls, in particular in respect of the tabs which are connected to the base wall (base tabs).<br>
Naturally, the packaging and the blank are also claimed in addition to the pack.<br><br>
In the same way as the pack according to the invention mentioned in the introduction -the wrapper consists of foldable material, in particular of thin cardboard, strong paper or the like.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a pack having a group of cigarette packs -cigarette multipack - and a wrapper therefor, made of an, in particular, single-piece blank, the wrapper being configured in the manner of a wrapper for a hinge-lid cigarette pack, characterized by a design as a round-edged pack or octagonal pack, i.e. with upright rounded regions instead of the conventional upright longitudinal folding lines or with upright double longitudinal folding lines, which are connected by a narrow folding strip, instead of the conventional upright longitudinal folding lines, it being the case that, with a configuration as a round-edged pack, round-edged cigarette packs are provided as the contents, with upright round edges of the cigarette packs arranged along the upright rounded regions of the pack, and it being the case that, with the pack being configured as an octagonal pack, octagonal cigarette packs are provided as the contents, with upright narrow folding strips of the cigarette packs arranged along the upright folding strips of the pack.<br>

according to figure 20.<br>
Figure 2 shows a pack 10 according to the invention, of which the outer form corresponds to that of an upright, conventional and commonly used hinge-lid box for cigarettes. A bottom box part 11 is closed by a top lid 12. Fastened in the box part 11, and projecting upward out of the latter, is a collar 13, the region which<br><br>
projects out of the box part 11 being enclosed by the lid 12 in the closed position.<br>
The box part 11 has a large front wall 14, a rear wall 15, narrow side walls 16 and 17 and a base wall 18. The latter is formed by an outer longitudinal tab 19 which adjoins the front wall 14 at the bottom, by an inner longitudinal tab 20 which adjoins the rear wall 15 at the bottom and by corner tabs, 21, 22 which adjoin the side walls. These three last-mentioned tabs 20 to 22 are formed such that they cannot overlap one another and thus come to rest precisely in the same plane. It is only the outer longitudinal tab 19 which covers the other three tabs. A two-layered base wall 18 is thus produced overall.<br>
On the side opposite to the front wall 14, the right-hand side wall 17 is adjoined by a connecting strip 23. During production of the pack 10 to the finished state, said connecting strip is connected to the rear wall 15 on the inside. On account of the blank parts 14 to 17 being folded via the side walls 16, 17, the pack 10 or a blank 24 therefor are also referred to as a "transverse-folding" pack or blank.<br>
The blank 24 is configured in one piece with the corresponding parts for the box part 11, the lid 12 and the collar 13. The already mentioned walls 15 to 17 are adjoined at the top by corresponding lid walls, namely a lid front wall 25, a lid rear wall 26 and lid side walls 27, 28. The lid front wall 25 is adjoined at the bottom - in the region of the transition to the front wall 14 - by a so-called lid inner tab 29 which, in the finished pack, is folded inward into abutment against the lid front wall 25. This means that between the lid front wall 25 and front wall 14, the finished pack 10 has a cutout 30, although it is closed by a collar front wall 31.<br><br>
En order to form a lid top wall <br>
at the same time) , the blank 24 is provided with a :over tab 33 which adjoins the lid rear wall 26 at the top, with an inner cover tab 34 which adjoins the lid front wall 25 at the top, and with side tabs 35, 36. Analogously to the base wall 18, it is also the case that the lid top wall 32 is only of two-layered design. For thi s purpose, the tabs 34 to 3 6 have a corresponding configuration, with the result that they do not overlap one another.<br>
The tabs 34 to 3 6 are adj oined at the top by blank parts for forming the collar 13, namely the already mentioned collar front wall 31 above the inner cover tab 34 and collar side tabs 37, 38. An upright folding line 39 is formed between the collar side tab 37 and collar front wall 31, and a folding line 40 is formed between the collar front wall 31 and collar side tab 38. Parallel to the abovementioned folding lines, and more or less in alignment therewith (offset slightly in the outward direction), corresponding longitudinal folding lines 41, 42 are respectively arranged between the side wall 16 and front wall 14 and between the front wall 14 and side wall 17.<br>
According to figure 1, the blank parts which are provided for forming the lid 12 are already separated, in part, from the box part 11 by severing cuts and are only attached to one another still in the region of residual connections. Corresponding severing cuts 43, 44 and 45 are provided between the lid side walls 27, 28, and the respectively adjacent side walls 16, 17 and between the lid inner tab 29 and the front wall 14. The severing cut 44 on the bottom border of the lid inner tab 29, at the same time, defines the shape of the cutout 30. An articulation line 46 is depicted between the lid rear wall 26 and rear wall 15. The severing cuts 43, 45 which are provided in the region of the side  walls  are  not  continuous.  Rather  residual<br><br>
connections, namely material webs 47 ana 48, which interrupt the respective severing cuts, are provided. Naturally, the severing cuts 43, 44 and 45 adjoin one another. When the pack is opened for the first time, the material webs 47, 48 are severed or torn apart from one another, with the result that web remnants 49, 50 are produced on the initially interconnected pack parts namely side walls 16, 17, on the one hand, and lid side walls 27, 28 on the other hand, see figures 3 and 4.<br>
The collar 13 adjoins the lid in the region of the tabs 34 to 36, Collar side tabs 37, 38 are separated off from the collar front wall 31 by the upright folding lines. Provided between the collar front wall 31 and the inner cover tab 34 is a severing cut 54, which defines the configuration of a visible cutout 51 in the collar front wall and a top border of the same. The cutout 51 is bounded laterally by upright ridges 52, 53. The severing cut 54 is interrupted by residual connections 55 between the ridges 52,53. Severing cuts<br>
56,	57 are likewise provided between the collar side<br>
tabs 37, 38 and lid side tabs 35, 36.<br>
Finally, a special feature is provided in the region of the transition between the severing cuts 56, 54 and 54,<br>
57.	The folding lines 39, 40 cross here. Moreover, so-<br>
called folding gussets 58, 59 are formed. These are of<br>
triangular or trapezoidal design and produce the<br>
connection between the collar 13 and the lid 12. In the<br>
spread-out blank 24, the folding gussets 57, 58 are<br>
respectively located precisely between the side tab 35<br>
and inner cover tab 34 and between the inner cover tab<br>
34 and side tab 36. Correspondingly, the abovementioned<br>
tabs in this region have oblique edges 60 (side tabs 35<br>
and 36) and likewise obliquely directed mating edges 61<br>
(inner cover tab 34) . The folding gussets 58, 59 here<br>
are connected to the collar side tabs 37, 38 and to the<br>
collar front wall at least via residual connections and<br>
are also attached to the lid 12 via a narrow material<br><br>
web 62 in the region of the folding lines 41, 42 in<br>
each case.<br>
During production of the pack, the areas of glue which are necessary for fixing the lid inner tab 2 9 and collar 13 are applied first of all. The lid inner tab 29 is then folded through 180° against the lid front wall 25. Thereafter, the collar 13 is folded downward in the rearward direction out of the position according to figure 1, and out of the image plane, to be precise around the material webs 62, with the result that the collar side tabs 37 and 38, in part, butt against the inside of the side walls 16, 17 and in part, project beyond the same, see figure 3. The collar front wall 31 still comes to rest on the front wall 14, beneath the severing cut 44, by way of a narrow strip 63 and otherwise projects upward beyond the front wall, see figures 3 and 4.<br>
The folding gussets 58, 59 are bounded in the upward direction, i.e. between the severing lines 56, 57 and 54, in figure 1 by severing cuts 64, 65, which continue the abovementioned lines and, in turn, are interrupted in each case by residual connections, namely material webs 66, 67. When the packaging is opened for the first time, the material webs 66, 67 are severed, while the folding gussets 58, 59 remain attached to the inside of the lid. The folding gussets are thus preferably connected to corresponding blank regions of the lid by adhesive bonding.<br>
The rest of the folding of the blank and the rest of the production of the pack are carried out in accordance with the production process.<br>
The finished pack contains two rows, each with five conventional cigarette hinge-lid boxes, in each case with sharp upright 90°-folding edges, corresponding to the longitudinal folding lines 41, 42.<br><br>
In the finished pack, the folding gussets 58, 59 come to rest inside the pack, to be precise respectively between the lid side wall 27 and lid front wall 25 and between the lid front wall 25 and lid side wall 28.<br>
As can be seen in figure 4, the individual cigarette packs in each row are arranged to butt closely against one another by way of the large walls (front wall and rear wall). Correspondingly, the dimensions of the pack 10 overall are such that the width of the pack corresponds approximately to the depth of five single cigarette packs, the depth of the pack corresponds approximately to the width of a single cigarette pack and the height corresponds to the height of two cigarette packs positioned one above the other. The upright longitudinal edges of the respectively outer cigarette packs come to rest adjacent and parallel to the upright longitudinal edges (lines 41, 42) of the pack. The material used for the blank 24 is thin cardboard or stiff paper. It is actually possible to use any foldable material.<br>
In an embodiment which is not shown, the lid inner tab 29 is not provided. Instead, the front wall 14 extends over a correspondingly greater height, namely as far as the now provided folding line 68 between the lid front wall 25 and the lid inner tab 29.<br>
Figures 5 to 8 describe a further embodiment of the pack according to the invention in conjunction with a corresponding blank. The pack is a so-called round-edged pack 69 with a blank 70 provided therefor. In order to avoid repetitions, the designations are otherwise retained. Upright rounding regions 71, 72, 73, 74 are depicted only in the region of the otherwise provided longitudinal folding lines. The rest of the blank parts are adapted thereto. The folding gussets 58, 59 are thus somewhat wider. Oblique edges 60 and 61 begin outside the rounding regions 72 and 73 and run<br><br>
from there as far as the severing cuts DO , o / approximately in the form of a V (or once the collar has been folded over, in the form of an upside-down V).<br>
Naturally, the tabs 19 to 22, 33 to 36 and 31, 37, 38 also begin outside the rounding regions 71 to 74. The outer longitudinal tab 19 and the cover tab 33 are designed in a specific manner here. These are each of a size which corresponds to the associated top wall 32 and base wall 18. Correspondingly, the two tabs 19, 33 extend into imaginary extensions of the rounding regions 71 to 73 by way of border regions.<br>
The finished pack 69 contains two rows of round-edged hinge-lid boxes (cigarette packs), as in figure 4. The radii of the rounding regions 71 to 74 are adapted to the radii of the round edges of the individual cigarette packs. Empty spaces are avoided as far as possible. At the same time, the outer appearance of the pack 69 gives an immediate indication of the pack contents.<br>
Figures 9 to 12, finally, show a pack according to the invention embodied as an octagonal pack 75 with a hinge lid. The designations, once again, have been retained. With the exception of the longitudinal folds. There, this exemplary embodiment provides narrow folding strips 76 to 79 which each have 45°-folding lines on both sides. The individual tabs 19 to 22, 25 to 28, 33 to 36 and the folding gussets 58, 59 are designed analogously to figure 5. In the same way as in figure 5, on the blank 80 in figure 9, the transitions between the walls and the adjacent tabs are adapted to the shape of the folded regions, in this case to the folding strips 76 to 79.<br>
The contents provided are two rows with five octagonal hinge-lid packs (cigarette packs) each. The width of the  folding  strips  76  to  79  is  adapted  to  the<br><br>
corresponding folding strips of the individual octagonal packs. Once again, an indication of the cigarette packs which are provided as the contents is given by the outer form of the octagonal pack 7 5 alone, see figure 12. Analogously to the configurations following figures 1 to 4, it is also possible for the packs 69 and 75 to be configured with or without a lid inner tab 29 and corresponding cutout 30.<br>
Figures 13 to 15 show the arrangement of the collar side tabs 37, 38 within the finished packs 10, 69 and<br>
75.	The collar side tabs are dimensioned in terms of<br>
their width such that they butt against the side walls<br>
16, 17 in the region of the same and do not extend into<br>
the region of the rear folds in each case. In figure 5,<br>
the so-called rear folds are identical to the rounding<br>
regions 71 and 74 and, in figure 9, they are identical<br>
to the folding strips 76 and 79. The collar side tabs<br>
37, 3 8 terminate in each case before the beginning of<br>
the rounding regions 71, 74 and of the folding strips<br>
76,	79. It is likewise the case, according to<br>
figure 13, that the collar side tabs 37, 38 only extend<br>
in the region of the side wall 16, 17 and not in the<br>
region of the rear wall 15.<br>
Figure 16 shows a modified blank 81, namely a modification of the blank according to figure 1. With an otherwise identical configuration, the connecting strip 23 adjoins the rear wall 15 rather than the side wall 17. The reason for this is to facilitate handling as the folding operations are carried out and the pack is filled. Once the lid inner tab 29 and collar 13 have been folded over, a group of cigarette packs, which is provided as the contents, is positioned in front of the blank, to be precise with a group narrow side in front of the corresponding side wall 16 and the lid side wall 27, behind the image plane in figure 16. The unit comprising the blank and pack group is then pushed into the pocket of a folding turret, with the blank being<br><br>
folded in U-form and parts of the blWik butting against corresponding sides of the pack group. It is then merely the side wall 17 and the connecting strip 23 (in the case of the configuration according to figure 16) which project beyond the pack group. It is possible for these to be folded over, by straightforward folding-element movements, in order to form the as-yet missing side wall and to be adhesively bonded to one another.<br>
The different folding tabs are preferably formed such that an at most two-layered wrapper is always produced. In order for this to be possible even in the region of the  collar,   the  connecting  strip  23,.  in  the configuration according to figure 16,  has a lateral cutout 82. This is dimensioned such that it only just leaves  enough  space  for  the  collar  side  tab  38. Figure 17 shows this clearly. There,  the collar has already been folded downward through 180°. The collar side tab 38 butts on the inside, in part, against the lid side wall 28 and, in part, against the side wall 17. The width of the collar side tab 38 is somewhat smaller than the width of the abovementioned walls 28, 17. The width difference is somewhat greater than the width 83 of the connecting strip 23 in this region. The height of the cutout 82 (and/or length of the same) is somewhat greater than the height of the collar side tab 38. As a result, none of the regions of the connecting strip 23 comes to rest on the collar side tab 38, with the result that exclusively two-layered packaging is produced even in the collar region.<br>
In respect of the position of the connecting strip 23 and as far as the cutout 82 is concerned, the modification shown may be used, in turn, for all the exemplary embodiments described.<br>
Alongside the abovedescribed use of the packs according to the invention as packaging for groups of cigarette packs,  it is also possible for the packaging to be<br><br>
dimensioned differently and to be envisaged for accommodating other types of articles.<br>
Figures 18 to 23 relate to a further configuration of a cigarette multipack. A pack 100 has a wrapper which is formed from a blank 101 and is made of the abovementioned material. A group of cigarette packs is arranged in the interior of the pack. The cigarette packs are in the manner of the so-called round-edged packs, in each case with a hinge lid which is articulated on a rear wall of the respective cigarette pack.<br>
In the blank 101, a large-surface-area wide front wall<br>
102	and a similarly large rear wall 103 are connected to one another by a long and narrow base wall 104. On the side opposite to the base wall 104, the rear wall<br>
103	is adjoined by a large cover tab 105 and a front wall 102 is adjoined by a small cover tab 106.<br>
The base wall 104 and large cover tab 105 each have a form corresponding to the outer contour of the pack and thus each extend over the entire surface area. In contrast, rather than extending over the entire width of a top wall 107 of the pack, the small cover tab 106 only extends over approximately half the width. In the closed pack 100, the small cover tab 106 comes to rest beneath the large cover tab 105, and is in particular adhesively bonded thereto. In addition, the small cover tab 106 is of trapezoidal design with its length decreasing in the direction of its free border 108.<br>
In order to form the end walls, the large rear wall 103 is adj oined by end tabs 109, 110 on both sides. Analogously to this, the large front wall 102 is provided with connecting strips 111, 112 on both sides and the base wall 104 is provided with base tabs 113, 114 on both sides. In order to form the end walls 115, 116 - once the front wall 102 and rear wall 103 have<br><br>
been erected relative to the base wall 104 - the connecting strips 111, 112 and base tabs 113, 114 are folded into a common plane and the end tabs 109, 110 are then turned over or folded thereon. The connecting strips 111, 112 and base tabs 113, 114 are configured such that they may be located in the same plane without overlapping one another. For this purpose, the connecting strips are of essentially trapezoidal design, at least with an oblique edge 117 adjacent to the base tabs. Analogously thereto, the base tabs 113, 114 each have an oblique mating edge 118. With the blank 101 in spread-out state, there is an angle of at least 90° or more between the edges 117, 118.<br>
So-called round edges 119, 120 are provided in the region of the transitions between the large walls (front wall 102, rear wall 103) and the adjacent end tabs 109, 110 as well as connecting strips 111, 112. The radius of said round edges is somewhat larger than the radius of the round edges on the cigarette packs which are provided as the contents. The base wall 104 and cover tab 105 are provided with roundings corresponding to the radius of the round edges 119, 120.<br>
The base tabs 113, 114 are configured, and arranged on the base wall 104, in a specific manner, see figure 19. The base wall 104 terminates laterally with rectilinear border portions 122, which are each adjoined by rounded borders 121 on both sides. The radius of the latter corresponds to the radius of the round edges 119, 120.<br>
The base tabs 113, 114 are somewhat narrower than the dimensions a of the rectilinear border portions 122. Located between the base tabs 113, 114 and the rounded borders 121 in each case are short rectilinear intermediate border portions 123, 124 with the dimensions b, with the result that, for example, the base  tab  114  has  a  dimension  c = a - 2b  in  the<br><br>
direction of the width of the end wall 115. The arrangement of the intermediate border portions 123, 124 facilitates the production of the pack in this region. Overlapping of connecting strips 111, 112 and base tabs 113, 114 is thus ruled out. In this case, it is possible to punch out the connecting strips 111, 112 in the region of the transition to the round edges 120 without a concave, i.e. only with a convex, outline.<br>
Figure 23 shows the arrangement of base tab 113 and connecting strip 111 relative to one another in the finished pack 100. A gap 125 is clearly visible between the oblique edge 117 and mating edge 118. The gap corresponds approximately to a projection of the dimension of the intermediate border portion 123 parallel to the edges 117, 118. Likewise clearly visible is the reduced width of the base tab 113 in relation to the width of the end wall, also minus the round edges 119, 120. Finally, the trapezoidal form of the connecting strip 111 is clearly visible. A free edge 12 6 of the connecting strip 111, said edge coming to rest just beneath the top wall 107 in the finished pack 100, is directed obliquely at a somewhat smaller angle than the oblique edge 117.<br>
The arrangement of the tabs 110, 114, 112 relative to one another is clearly visible in the horizontal section of figure 22. The base tab 114 and connecting strip 112 are located in the same plane on the inside and are adhesively bonded to the outer end tab 110. The latter extends over virtually the entire width of the end wall 115, but not beyond the round edge 120. Overlapping only takes place with the connecting strip 112.<br>
The small cover tab 106 extends exclusively outside the round edges 120 and thus not over the entire length of the pack.<br><br>
The "round-edged" cigarette multipack described with reference to figures 18 to 23 may also be designed as an "octagonal" cigarette multipack. In this case, two 45°-folds separated by a narrow strip are provided instead of the round edges 119, 120. The rounded borders 121 shown in figure 19 have to be replaced by obliquely directed (rectilinear) borders between two 45° angles. The same applies to the configuration of the cover tab 105.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
