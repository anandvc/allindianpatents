				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 2-chloro-5-methyl pyridine -3-carbaldehyde an useful intermediate for the variety of pharmaceutical and pesticide products. This study pertains to the preparation of 2-chloro-5-methyl pyridine -3-carbaldehyde having formula 1 as given in the drawing below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
This study pertains to the preparation of 2-chloro-5-methyl pyridine-3-carbaldehyde with high selectivity.<br>
Several pyridine, quinoline, and isoquinoline compounds are important intermediates in that they have been reported as potential anti tumor agents (J.Med.Chem, 19,1209,1976; CA,85:116544q). Carbaldehyde derived products served as ulcer healing agents ( Ger.offen DE 3324034,1984; CA,101:54936g), allergy inhibitors ( EP 120483,1984; CA,102:95649e; EP 120484,1984; CA,102:113500f), antiviral agents ( CA,113:172015b), and useful as intermediates for Pharmaceuticals (Ger.offen DE 4429465,1996,CA, 124:343116u).<br>
There is only one method appeared in the literature for the preparation of 2-chloro-5-methylpyridine-3-carbaldehydein 12%yield.(J.C.S.Perkin.Trans 1,1173,1984). The present invention describes an improved process for the preparation of 2-chloro-5-methylpyridine-3-carbaldehyde from N-benzyl-N-(l-Propenyl) acetamide using Vilsemier reagent in 64% yield against reported 12% yield.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of 2-chloro-5-methylpyridine-3-carbaldehyde which obviates the improvement in the method.<br>
The another objective of this present invention is to prepare 2-chloro-5-methylpyridine-3-carbaldehyde in higher yields.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of 2-chloro-methylpyridine-3-carbaldehyde which comprises reacting N-benzyl-N-(l-Propenyl) acetamide with Vilsemier reagent in a molar ratio of N-benzyl-N-(l-Propenyl) acetamide to Vilsemier reagent in the range of 0.02:0.35 to 0.07:0.35, at a temperature in the range of 0-10°C for 1-4 hours, heating the above reaction mixture at a temperature ranging between 70-100°C for 4-6 hours to obtain solid mass, pouring the above said mass in cold water and extracting the said mass with methylene chloride followed by remaining methylene chloride by known methods to obtain 2-chloro-5-methyl pyridine-3-carbaldehyde.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the molar ratio of N-benzyl-N-(1-Propenyl) acetamide to Vilsemier reagent is preferably 0.05 : 0.35.<br>
In an another embodiment the reaction time is preferably 2 hours.<br>
In yet another embodiment the reaction temperature is preferably in the ange of 75-90°C.<br>
In still another embodiment the product yield is 64%.<br>
In the improved process for the preparation of the 2-chloro-5-methylpyridine-3-carbaldehyde about 21.93g, 0.3 moles of dimethylformamide is added to a well stirred and cooled 53.65 g, 0.35 moles of phosphorousoxytrichloride material at a temperature range of about 0-20°c for about 25-35 minutes and then adding to it 9.45 g, 0.05 moles of N-benzyl-N-(l-Propenyl) acetamide at the temperature of about 0-20°c . The above reaction mixture is further continued for 2hrs at the room temperature of about 25°c. The ice cold bath is removed and heated to 75-90°c for 4-6hrs. A orange yellow organic mass is produced which is poured over 200 gms of ice cold water with constant stirring. The mass is then extracted with 2x200ml of methylene chloride and the layers are separated which are then dried over sodium sulphate and the solvent is removed under pressure.<br>
The residue obtained is subjected to chromatographic purification over silicagel to give a 64% yeild of 2-chloro-5-methylpyridine-3-carbaldehyde.The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and there fore should not be construed to the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1 : Dimethylformamide (21.93 g, 0.3 moles) was added to a well stirred and cooled material of phosphorousoxytrichloride( 53.65 g, 0.35 moles) at 0°c in 30 minutes and followed by N-benzyl-N-(l-Propenyl) acetamide (9.45g, 0.05 moles) at the same temperature . The reaction mixture was further continued for 2 hours at room temperature of about 25°c. The ice cold bath was removed and heated to 75°c for 5 hours. The orange-yellow coloured organic mass was poured to ice cold water (200g) with stirring<br>
.The mass was extracted with methylenechloride (2x 200ml) and the layers were separated. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure . The obtained residue was subjected to chromatographic purification on silicagel to give 2-chloro-5-methylpyridine-3-carbaldehyde in 64% yield .<br>
Example 2 : Dimethylformamide (21.93 g, 0.3moles) was added to a well stirred and cooled material of phosphorousoxytrichloride ( 53.65 g, 0.35 moles) at 10 °C in 30 minutes and followed by N-benzyl-N-(l-Propenyl) acetamide ( 9.45g, 0.05 moles) at the same temperature . The reaction mixture was further continued 2 hours at room temperature of about 25°c. The ice cold bath was removed and heated to 90°c for 5 hours. The work up procedure was carried out according to the above mentioned procedure. The obtained residue was subjected to chromatographic purification on silica gel to give 2-chloro-5-methylpyridine-3-carbaldehyde in 64% yield .<br>
