				<td>The invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 1-(4-arylpiperzin-1-yl)-ω- (N-substituted amino) alkane.<br>
The invention relates to an industrial process for the synthesis of 1-(4-arlypiperazin-1-yl)-ω- (N-substituted amino) alkane and related compounds known to be useful as antihypertensive and other related CVS and CMS disorders.<br>
The 1-(4-arlypiperazin-1-yl)- ω-(N-substituted amino) alkane prepared by the process of the present invention having the formula III as shown in the drawing accompanying this specification, where R is H, a lower alkyl group having a straight or branched chain alkyl radial such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert butyl, n-aryl, n-hexyl, 2-ethyl butyl or an alkyl halide such as methyl trifluoride or halide radicals such as F, Cl, Br, or I, a hydroxy or a lower alkoxy group such as methoxy, ethoxy etc. where R1 is a substituted amino alkyl group having a straight or branched chain containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as defined above in R or constituted a cyclic polymethylene system containing the nitrogen atom, in N(CH2)n where in n=2-6 or it's derivative 3 to 6 membered lactones such as 2-pyrrolidinone etc.<br>
Similar compounds in formula III are hitherto known to be synthesized by two different methods covered under Indian patent application, No.496/Del/95 and No.501/Del/95 where in the first method 1-arylpiperazins of the formula I where R has meaning given above is condensed with R1-CI such as 1-chloro-3 (2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl) propane in<br>
presence of essentially inorganic base Na2CO3 or K2CO3 and catalyst like Nal or Kl in an organic solvent DMF or acetone at temperature 70-150°C for a varying period between 8hrs to 14 hrs.<br>
On strictly following these conditions it was observed that<br>
1.	The reaction does not complete even if carried out for 48hrs and the yield is very<br>
low.<br>
2.	The costly solvent DMF has been used which is difficult to remove completely<br>
without losing it in substantial amount. Other solvent also did not give better result<br>
under these conditions<br>
3.	Use   of   DMF   also   produces   an   unwanted   compound   i.e.   1-formyl-4-   (4-<br>
fluorophenyl)piperazine which adds to its impurities.<br>
4.	Purification by chromatography requires lot of solvent as eluent and time which is<br>
not acceptable to large-scale preparation (in the industry).<br>
5.	All the above conditions make the process uneconomical.<br>
In the second hitherto known process 1-(4-arylpiperazin-1-yl) alkyl halide is condensed with substituted amine such as 2-pyrrolidone in an organic solvent where in some times use of sodium metal or even sodium hydride is very essential for the reaction to take place. Use of Na or NaH needs extra precautions in their handling for being very hygroscopic and pyrophoric in nature. In this process the yields of the final compound of formula III is even much less than the 1st hitherto known process.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved large scale high yielding simple and economically viable process for the preparation of 1-(4-arylpiperazin1-yl)-ω-(N-substituted amino) alkane having formula III as defined above which would be useful for the treatment of hypertension and other related CVS and CNS disorders.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of 1[4-arylpiperazin-1-yl]-ω-(N-substituted amino) alkane of the formula III shown in the drawing accompanying this specification where R is selected from the group consists of H, a lower alkyl group having a straight or branched chain alkyl radial selected from the group consisting of such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert butyl, n-aryl, n-hexyl, 2-ethyl butyl and trifluoromethyl, halide radical selected from F, Cl, Br and I, a hydroxyl and a lower alkoxy group selected from methoxy and ethoxy, where R1 is a substituted amino alkyl group having a straight or branched chain containing 1 to 6 carbn atoms such as defined above in R or constituted a cyclic polymethylene system containing the nitrogen atom, in N(CH2)n wherein n=2-6 or it's derivative, 3-6 membered lactones such as a 2-pyrrolidinone , said process comprises condensing an arylpiperazin of formula I with a substituted amino alkyl chloride (R1-CI) of formula II having meaning as above , in the presence of an organic base selected from triethyl amine, tripropylamine, diethylaniline, dimethyl benzyl amine and N-methylmorpholine , wherein ratio of arylpiperin : substituted amino alkyl chloride : base ranges from 1:1:1 to 0.1:1:1 , in an organic solvent as herein described , at a temperature ranging from 50°-110°C for a period ranging between 4 to 16 hrs to obtain the desired 1[4-arylpiperazin-1-yl]-ω -(N-substituted amino) alkane.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the organic base used is selected from the group consisting of triethyl amine, tripropylamine, diethylaniline, dimethyl benzyl amine and N-methylmorpholine.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention the base used is recovered as hydrochloride and is recycled after converting into freebase.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention the organic solvent used is selected from the group consisting of benzene, xylene, toluene, dioxane and THF.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the compound of the formula III is obtained in 78-90% yield.<br>
In still anther embodiment of the present invention the compound 1-(4-arlypiperazin)-ω-(N-substituted amino)alkane obtained is selected from 1-(4-arlypiperazin)-ω-(N-substituted amino)ethane and 1-(4-arlypiperazin)-ω-(N-substituted amino)propane.<br>

The novelty of the present invention lies in the process for the preparation of 1-(-4-arylpiperazin-1-yl)-ω-(N-substituted amino) alkane which does not require any additional catalyst like Nal or Kl and the reaction carried out in a cheap solvent avoiding formation of unwanted compounds and the use of organic amine base facilitate the reaction to go smoothly and give much better yield, 78-90% as compared to the hitherto known processes.<br>
The amine hydrochloride formed in the reaction can be filtered easily and made use of repeatedly in the reaction there by improving the economics of the process. Purification of the compound is done by simple filtering through a small bed of silica gel, thus avoiding the use of column chromatography where in lot of solvent and time was consumed which effects the cost of production.<br>
The present process avoids the use of Na of NaH which are hazardous to handle in large scale preparation. Reaction can be carried out at low temperature between 50-110°C thus saving energy.<br>
The time period required for various reactions is between 6 hrs to 16 hrs only. The process is technically and economically feasible for the large-scale preparation in the industry.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
