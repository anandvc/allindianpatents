				<td>A motorist face cooling helmet visor comprising spectacle is attached below the spectacle material, fitted with cotton, felt and sponge made face covering frame pad. The frame pad protects motorist face from Sun rays and provides cooling by spraying water on the cotton and sponge made face covering frame pad, before start riding the two wheeler. While riding the two wheeler, the hot breeze passes through the wet part of sponge, felt and cotton frame face cover)ng pad and keeps rider&#x27;s face cool and fresh and protects rider&#x27;s face from scorching sun rays and heat. The rider will be pleasurable. While riding the motor cycle during the day without helmet, motorist feels the hot sun rays and hot breeze. So this Motorist face cooling helmet visor stops the hot breeze and provides cooling. Another object of the invention is to protect motorist from dust, the wet able part of the Helmet absorbs the dust.</td>

MOTORIST FACE COOLING HELMET VISOR<br>
This invention, motorist face cooling helmet visor relates to an improvement in helmet visor, a front wall structure, to provide coolness to the face. A front upper fibre glass goggle for forward viewing and lower front wall structure is used for providing coolness and freshness and to protect the scorching sun rays and dust to the motorist face, while riding the two wheeler.<br>
For many people in hot countries like India facing the lack of air circulation for coolness and freshness to the face of motorist while riding the two wheeler, causes discomfort with sweating, heat and scorching sun rays, which can result in lack of freshness, comfortable and coolness to the rider of the two wheeler.<br>
There have been many proposals to helmets and visors but these have all made for cold countries or other be provided fully covered with fibre glass. For example one previous device proposes, which is United States Patent, Patent No.4,555,816 named Ventilated Helmet. It is providing air passage rearwardly for air circulation to the protective covered top and back wall structure and upper interiors of the helmet. This Ventilated Helmet proposal have disadvantages that it is not providing air to the face of the motorist and the air circulates back side and top of the head, further it is not providing cool air inflow system in lower front wall structure, and it allows dust and hot breeze in the hot season.<br>
These problems are overcome by the present invention. In one form of the invention, a motorist face cooling helmet visor, a front wall structure comprising the front upper fibre glass goggle for forward viewing and lower front wall structure (2), the inner surface is fixed with the wetting pad, which is made out of with lA inch to 2 inch thickness of sponge and felt material as layers to keep the wetness for increased time and it is covered and stitched around with cotton cloth and felt material like a pad. The pad has been divided in to three parts, one is left side part, right part and the middle part. The left side of the pad is punched holes crossly (2 millimeter to 5 millimeter cross) to the left upper side and the right side of the pad is punched crossly to the right upper side. In the middle part of the pad is punched crossly to the upper side. The size and the range of the hole will be 2 millimeter to 5 millimeters in diameter at outer surface of the pad and the same inner surface hole will be 1 millimeter to 2 millimeter in diameter.<br>
In another form of the invention, the lower front wall structure (2) is made separately, the pad which is made out of with lA inch to 2 inch thickness of sponge and felt material as layers to keep the wetness for increased time and it<br><br>
is covered and stitched around with cotton cloth and felt material like a pad. The pad has been divided in to three parts, one is left side part, right part and the middle part. The left side of the pad is punched holes crossly (2 millimeter to 5 millimeter cross) to the left upper side and the right side of the pad is punched crossly to the right upper side. In the middle part of the pad is punched crossly to the upper side. The size and the range of the hole will be 2 millimeter to 5 millimeters in diameter at outer surface of the pad and the same inner surface hole will be 1 millimeter to 2 millimeter in diameter. . The number of holes can be punched in the pad is as suitable and required. Then the pad is kept in a frame, which may be made of any suitable material, such as metal or moulded plastic. Now this frame can be attached to goggle. Now the pad can be wetted for coolness and freshness or after discharging the wetness of the pad in the summer or hot climate.<br>
Now the motorist riding with the motorist face cooling helmet visor, the hot air or dust which directly touches the wet sponge and cotton material and the air passes through the wet part of the pad hole, so the wet pad absorbs dust or pollution and keeps rider's face cool and fresh and it protects rider's face from scorching sun rays by the pad and reduces the heat inside the helmet visor. The rider will be pleasurable.<br>
/ In one more form of the invention, a frame made like "U" shape and in the<br>
middle "J" shaped for the seating for nose and mouth. This frame is covered and<br>
stitched with thick wetting cotton cloth and felt material. Now this detachable<br>
frame will be attached to the goggle. This detachable frame can washable.<br>
The ability to be seen in the traffic is one of the most essential safety criteria the needs to be considered. In open face helmet or the elastic wearable visor or goggle the space for front wall structure is more than sufficient to attach the above said invention (wet pad) to the visor for coolness and freshness. Where as in full face helmet, it is to be provided the space for more visor part by reducing the chin bar (like sleek). So that the protection of visual ability can be kept as required and this invention can be applied.<br>
The visor a movable upper piece in the helmet can move upper side normally, and the visor can be used like a cap for helmet, because the pad comes upper side and it becomes like a cap of the helmet.<br>
To assist with understanding he invention, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, which shows one example of the invention.<br><br>
Brief description of the drawing :-	/<br>
FIG. 1 shows one example of a motorist face cooling helmet visor according to this invention.<br>
FIG.2 shows the goggle attached with face cooling helmet visor according to this invention.<br>
Referring to Fig.l can be seen that the motorist face cooling helmet visor according to this invention comprises the spectacle(l) part is made with fiber glass material and the bottom part of the visor(2) is made with sponge and cotton material made pad fixed within a frame.<br>
The inner part of the bottom part(2) of the fiber glass visor is pasted with the wetting pad, which is made out of with ty inch to 2 inch thickness of sponge and it is covered and stitched around with cotton cloth material like a pad. The bottom part(2) is divided into 3 parts, one is left side part(5) , right side part(4) and the middle part(6) The left side(5) of the pad is punched holes crossly to the left side, in the size of 2 millimeter to 5 millimeter at outer surface(7), the right side (4)of the pad is punched holes crossly to the right side, in the size of 2 millimeter to 5 millimeter at outer side(7) and the middle part(6) of the visor pad is punched holes crossly to the upper side in the size of 2 millimeter to 5 millimeter at outer surface(7) and the same all inner surface holes(8) will be 1 millimeter to 2 millimeter in diameter. The number of holes can be punched in the visor pad is as required in the blocks (3,9).<br>
Referring to Fig.2 can be seen that the according to this invention comprises the goggle (2.1) and bottom part of the visor (2.2) is made with sponge, cotton and felt material made fixed within a frame.<br><br><br>
