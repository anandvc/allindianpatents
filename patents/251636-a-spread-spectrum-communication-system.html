				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to wireless communications, and more particularly, to a<br>
spread spectrum communication system separating the base band from radio frequency<br>
site in the base station, capable of establishing loop networks of radio frequency sites.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Spread spectrum communication system can be divided into many types such as IS95<br>
CDMA, cdma2000, WCDMA, TD-SCDMA, etc. in accordance with different wireless<br>
modulation demodulation techniques. The fixed part of the spread spectrum<br>
communication system is composed of two elements: a base station controller (BSC) or<br>
central node (RNC) and several base stations (BTS) or nodes (Node B). The base station<br>
connects with the base station controller through an Abis or luB interface, Such an<br>
interface exists between each base station and the base station controller, thus there will be<br>
multiple interfaces when there are multiple base stations. Through the base station<br>
controller, every base station communicates with the others.<br>
In conventional spread spectrum communication systems, one base station takes<br>
charge of one or a few radio frequency sites to access radio services in one area. Because<br>
of limited coverage of one base station, it needs multiple base stations for larger area, thus<br>
multiple interfaces should be supported by the base station controller. The base stations<br>
connected with the base station controller will be consequently numerous, therefore,<br>
maintainability of the spread spectrum communication system is reduced to a certain<br>
extent and costs will be increased. The baseband and radio frequency site act as a whole,<br>
which is complex in structure and hard to be put outdoors. Due to the separation of<br>
locations, each base station requires to rent a room, thus n rooms should be rented for n<br>
base stations, which increases costs for the operator.<br><br><br>
Moreover, star network is commonly adopted in forming network between the<br>
baseband and radio frequency site today, or chain network. Star network requires more<br>
optical fibers; especially multiple pairs of radial optical fibers are needed in baseband.<br>
Chain network requires fewer optical fibers; however its reliability is low because power<br>
down or damage of any site will result in the failure of the following stage, which might<br>
produce a great effect owing to usually bad environment conditions of the base stations.<br>
Loop network can save a large amount of optical fibers, reduce difficulty in network<br>
topology and enhance network reliability, and the star network and chain network can be<br>
regarded as a special modality of loop network. However, forming loop network is most<br>
difficult. Optical synchronous transmission network SDH can actualize many types of<br>
forming networks including loop network, but hard to satisfy the requirement transmitting<br>
from the baseband to the radio frequency sites. The main problems are as following:<br>
In mobile communication systems, some system (such as CDMA) requires to keep the<br>
base station antenna transmission synchronous with the system time accurately. Thus it<br>
requires to obtain the system clock boundary through accurate timing system (for example:<br>
Global Positioning System GPS) in baseband portion, and to broadcast periodical<br>
boundary signals over the whole network. The optimal method for transmitting such<br>
boundary signals is to synchronistically insert the clock boundary information among<br>
forward and reverse data, which brings expenses for processing interfaces of the baseband<br>
and the radio frequency sites. Besides, if the baseband and the radio frequency sites are not<br>
installed at the same address, the transmission delay from the baseband to the radio<br>
frequency sites (the delay changes with the status of link turnover, and no such problem in<br>
chain or star network) should be measured accurately and in real time; then the advance of<br>
forward transmission time will be adjusted according to the delay to reversely correct the<br>
centre of the search window. However, real-time measurement of the transmission delay<br>
related to the turnover is not supported by SDH. Furthermore, signals transmitted from the<br>
baseband to the radio frequency sites have high speed and require high real-time and little<br>
turnover delay; transmission from the baseband to the radio frequency sites doesn't keep<br><br><br>
synchronization with SDH standard speed set. Thus the above-mentioned particularities<br>
make it hard for SDH to satisfy the requirement of transmission from the mobile<br>
communication baseband to the radio frequency sites.<br>
One characteristic of the loop network from the baseband to the radio frequency site is:<br>
the baseband portion is the only source of forward link and the only destination of reverse<br>
link without the direct communication between the radio frequency sites. So some certain<br>
optimizations of the loop network from the baseband to the radio frequency sites can be<br>
made basing on this characteristic.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a spread spectrum communication<br>
system to avoid low maintainability and high cost of the conventional spread spectrum<br>
communication system, and easy to form high real-time and transmission efficiency<br>
network to satisfy the requirement of transmitting from the baseband to the radio<br>
frequency sites.<br>
The first aspect of the invention provides a spread spectrum communication system,<br>
comprising a base station controller, a centralized baseband system and RF systems,<br>
wherein:<br>
the centralized baseband system is coupled to the base station controller through an<br>
Abis or Iub interface;<br>
the centralized baseband system comprises: one or more baseband subsystems and a<br>
clock subsystem which provides clock signals for the baseband subsystems;<br>
the baseband subsystems are coupled to the RF systems through inner interfaces.<br><br><br>
The second aspect of the invention provides a spread spectrum communication<br>
system, comprising a base station controller, a centralized baseband system and RF<br>
systems, wherein:<br>
the centralized baseband system is coupled to the base station controller through an<br>
Abis or Iub interface;<br>
the centralized baseband system comprises one baseband subsystem and a clock<br>
subsystem which provides clock signals for the baseband subsystem; the baseband<br>
subsystem further comprises a master baseband subsystem and several slave baseband<br>
subsystems; the master baseband subsystem is coupled to the slave baseband subsystems<br>
to centrally control all the slave baseband subsystems; and the slave baseband subsystems<br>
are coupled to the RF systems through inner interfaces.<br>
The centralized baseband system transmits forward signals to two loop links at the<br>
same time.<br>
The RF system receives the forward signals from the two loop links at the same time,<br>
but only one of the two loop links is selected at one moment by a link selector controlled<br>
by the link status, and an appropriate link is selected through switching by the link selector<br>
while the link is in abnormal condition (For example, if either link is damaged, switch to<br>
the other link, and if both links are normal, select either of them).<br>
The RF system transmits reverse signals in two directions of the loop links at the<br>
same time.<br>
The baseband system receives the reverse signals from the two loop links at the same<br>
time, but only one of the two loop links is selected at one moment by a link selector<br>
controlled by the link status, and an appropriate link is selected through switching by the<br>
link selector while the link is in abnormal condition.<br><br><br>
The present invention reduces the quantity of the base stations and the interfaces<br>
between the base stations and the base station controller through centralizing the baseband<br>
system of multiple base stations, and achieves the same coverage effect. The centralized<br>
baseband system and the RF systems are entirely independent, which is very convenient<br>
for site deploying. The RF systems can be put near to the antenna and the cable lose is<br>
reduced, the requirement of the transmission power and the input power of the base station<br>
is then reduced. Because there are only RF parts in each RF site, the structure of the site is<br>
simplified, and it makes the site easy to be outdoor and miniaturized. It will also be<br>
possible to use one room to cover a large coverage area, and if the centralized baseband<br>
system is an outdoor type, there is no necessary to rent a room at all. Finally, installing the<br>
base stations and the base station controller at the same spot breaks through the limit of the<br>
room space, so it saves a large amount of money for the operator and improves<br>
maintainability of the apparatus.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments:<br>
Now, the present invention will be described in details with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings and the preferred embodiments.<br>
The fixed part of the spread spectrum communication system is composed of two<br>
elements: a base station controller (BSC) (or central node RNC) and several base stations<br>
(BTS) (or nodes Node B). The base station connect with the base station controller<br>
through an Abis or lub interface. Such an interface exists between each base station and<br>
base station controller, thus there will be multiple interfaces when there are multiple base<br>
stations. And the base stations communicate with each other via the base station controller.<br>
The base station is usually composed of two parts: baseband system and radio frequency<br>
system, in which the baseband system conducts digits baseband processing and the<br>
interface connecting to the base station controller. The radio frequency site conducts the<br>
up and down conversion of the signal from/to RF band.<br>
In the conventional systems as shown in fig. 1, one base station takes charge of one or<br>
a few radio frequency sites to access radio services in one area. Because of limited<br>
coverage of one base station, it needs multiple base stations fro larger area, thus multiple<br><br><br>
interfaces should be supported by the base station controller, therefore, reliability of the<br>
spread spectrum communication system is reduced to a certain extent.<br>
The base station is complex in structure, hard to be put outdoors, and the cost is high.<br>
Because one room is required for each base station, multiple rooms are required in order to<br>
cover a large area. Therefore, costs for rooms will be increased.<br>
Each base station requires accurate timing system, so multiple independent accurate<br>
timing system are required for multiple base stations, which results in cost increasing and<br>
reliability decreasing.<br>
Besides, the locations of the base stations should be dispersed to meet coverage<br>
requirement, which certainly results in the difficulty of maintenance.<br>
In order to solve the above problems in the conventional arts, the present invention<br>
provides the first aspect of the spread spectrum communication system, as shown in fig. 2,<br>
comprising a base station controller, at least one centralized baseband system and multiple<br>
RF systems; the centralized baseband system is coupled to the base station controller<br>
through an Abis or Iub interface; the centralized baseband system comprises one or more<br>
baseband subsystems and one clock subsystem which can be shared by each baseband<br>
subsystem, i.e., clock signals are provided for several baseband subsystems at the same<br>
time; each baseband subsystems are coupled to multiple RF systems through inner<br>
interfaces. Each baseband subsystem can be designed corresponding to one clock<br>
subsystem which provides clock signals for each baseband subsystem respectively.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides the second aspect of the spread spectrum<br>
communication system, as shown in fig. 3, comprising a base station controller, at least<br>
one centralized baseband system and multiple RF systems; the centralized baseband<br>
system is coupled to the base station controller through an Abis or Iub interface; the<br>
centralized baseband system further comprises one master baseband subsystem, several<br><br><br>
slave baseband subsystems and a clock subsystem from which clock signals are sent to<br>
each master baseband subsystem and each slave baseband subsystem; the master baseband<br>
subsystem is coupled to the slave baseband subsystems to centrally control all the slave<br>
baseband subsystems;<br>
Multiple baseband subsystems can share one clock, so that each baseband subsystem<br>
need not be configured to an independent accurate clock (for example: Global Positioning<br>
System GPS), which reduces cost and improves reliability. Moreover, control circuit and<br>
interface circuit connecting with the baseband controller can be shared. The sharing can<br>
also reduce cost, simplify design and improve reliability. For the base station controller,<br>
centralized control represents one and only base station, so as to greatly reduce the total<br>
number of base stations controlled by the base station controller, which is beneficial to<br>
improve the centralization and reliability of the base station controller.<br>
Centralized baseband system and remote RF systems make it possible to install the<br>
base station baseband part and the base station controller at the sameaddress, and enhance<br>
the significance of applying such a configuration method. Fig.4 is an example of installing<br>
the baseband controller and the centralized baseband system at the sameaddress. It is<br>
shown that the former remote interface between the base station controller and the base<br>
station is changed into a close interface with less transmission method limit, allowing the<br>
use of simple interface with low requirement. For instance, the Compression Protocol<br>
regulated for fulfilling the requirements of long distance and low band width transmission<br>
can be removed so that setting up the base station and the base station controller can be<br>
greatly simplified.<br>
Fig. 5 is a topological structure of loop network forming of the centralized baseband<br>
system and radio frequency sites provided by the present invention. Double fiber<br>
bidirectional loop is the fundamental structure, from which other types such as four fiber<br>
loop network can be derived. There will be one centralized baseband system and multiple<br>
RF systems in one loop network. The RF system obtains forward service data and<br><br><br>
signaling from the base station through the loop network, and the baseband obtains reverse<br>
service data and signaling from the RF system through loop network.<br>
The loop network can be designed to be a forward/reverse multiplexing, entirely<br>
backup, rapid transmission conversion supported network by using the peculiarity of<br>
wireless communications, i.e., the RF system ends special real-time forward data and<br>
initiates special real-time reverse data at the same time and the baseband is the only source<br>
of forward link and the only destination of reverse link<br>
It is an example of a simple loop network including two RF systems R1 and R2 shown<br>
in fig. 5, and two RF stations divide the whole loop into 3 sections.<br>
Fig. 5a shows the forward and reverse multiplexing method while normal working;<br>
and the transmission signals of each section in normal conditions are marked in fig.5a. In<br>
normal working conditions, from baseband B0 clockwise, the transmission data of optical<br>
fibers in three sections are:<br>
On the optical fiber section from the baseband B0 to R1, inner loop transmission: R1<br>
forward link + R2 forward link, outer loop transmission: R1 reverse link + R2 reverse link.<br>
On the optical fiber section from R1 to R2, inner loop transmission: R1 reverse link +<br>
R2 forward link, outer transmission: R1 forward link + R2 reverse link. Operation done by<br>
R1: receiving the forward data belonging to Rl and inserting the reverse data of R1 into<br>
the former forward time slot. The inner loop and the outer loop operate in the same way.<br>
On the optical fiber section from R2 to baseband B0, inner loop transmission: R1<br>
reverse link + R2 reverse link, outer loop transmission: R1 forward link + R2 forward link.<br>
R2 operation is similar to R1 operation.<br><br><br>
Some special time slots are assigned for each RF system, and the baseband sends the<br>
same data to the inner loop and the outer loop in forward link at the same time. Although<br>
data transmit in two loops, the RF system only selects one loop as the real forward data to<br>
transmit. In reverse link, each RF system transmits data to the inner loop and the outer<br>
loop at the same time. Because the RF system has ended the forward time slot belonging<br>
to itself, the time slot can be employed to transmit the reverse data of the station. Thus the<br>
forward data and the reverse data of one RF system share one time slot, which saves band<br>
width efficiently.<br>
The reverse data from the inner loop and the outer loop are received in the baseband at<br>
the same time. However, the link selector selects only one loop as active. And different RF<br>
systems can select different active link at one moment. For example, at the moment T0,<br>
R1 active link can be inner loop and R2 active link can be outer loop. The link selector<br>
selects appropriate link in accordance with the status of links. When link abnormity takes<br>
place, the link selector turns over correspondingly.<br>
Fig. 5b shows the forward and reverse multiplexing method while abnormal working.<br>
When there is link breaks of the optical fiber as shown in fig. 5b, from baseband B0<br>
clockwise, the transmission data of optical fibers in three sections are:<br>
On the optical fiber section from the baseband B0 to R1, inner loop transmission: R1<br>
forward link + R2 forward link, outer loop transmission: R1 reverse link + R2 reverse link.<br>
On the optical fiber section from R1 to R2, inner loop transmission: R1 reverse link +<br>
R2 forward link, outer transmission: R1 forward link + R2 reverse link. Operation done by<br>
R1: receiving the forward data belonging to R1 and inserting the reverse data of R1 into<br>
the former forward time slot. The inner loop and the outer loop operate in the same way.<br>
11<br><br>
On the optical fiber section from R2 to baseband BO, inner loop transmission: R1<br>
reverse link + R2 reverse link, outer loop transmission: R1 forward link + R2 forward link.<br>
R2 operation is similar to R1 operation.<br>
At this moment, the forward link of R1 can be from the inner loop, but the forward<br>
data of R2 are from the outer loop because the inner loop has been broken. Similarly, the<br>
reverse data of R1 return from the outer loop, and the reverse link of R2 can still return<br>
from the outer loop.<br>
On the basis of the above analysis, no matter in normal status or in abnormal status,<br>
the RF systems carry out the same data processing although the links are switched. And<br>
the inner loop operation and the outer loop operation are completely identical to each other,<br>
so that the control complexity is reduced, and the switching speed is rapid due to entirely<br>
warm backup.<br>
Fig.6 is the implementation block diagram of the RF system in the loop network<br>
forming.<br>
For the inner loop, the forward/reverse mixed data coming from the upstream RF<br>
system are divided into two routes after receipt and framing: one route enters into the<br>
forward buffer memory, selects its own time slot at first, and then enters into a select<br>
circuit together with the forward data of the outer loop to select an activated forward<br>
output pursuant to certain rules; another route enters into a divided insertion multiplexing<br>
unit receiving the reverse signals locally generated simultaneously, and the time slot<br>
occupied by the forward link data is replaced by the reverse link data. Then the data is<br>
transmitted to the downstream through the transmission module of the inner loop.<br>
The outer loop processing procedure is similar to that of the inner loop. The reverse<br>
signals are broadcasted to the inner and the outer loops. And the forward signal of the RF<br>
system is selected depending upon the status of the present link, and it can also be selected<br>
manually.<br><br><br>
The loop network implementation device of the baseband part is similar to the RF<br>
systems, but it broadcasts the forward data in the inner and the outer loops at the same<br>
time, and selects the activated path in reverse link for each RF system pursuant to certain<br>
rules.<br>
Due to the flexibility brought by the loop network, topological structure of all kinds of<br>
networks including star network and chain network can be regarded as special loop<br>
network. Therefore, the same processing mechanism can be employed in different network<br>
topological structures, which can simplify the design and improve the reliability.<br>
Fig. 7 is a diagrammatic drawing regarding the chain network and the star network as<br>
the loop network, in which, fig. 7a is a typical loop network without double fibers break;<br>
for the chain network shown in fig. 7b, joining in of the dashed lines can primarily regard<br>
the chain network as a typical loop network, and then imagine the double fibers of the<br>
dashed lines have been broken, thus the network can be regarded as a kind of loop network<br>
with broken double fibers; and for the star network shown in fig. 7c, similarly, the network<br>
can be regarded as the loop network with broken double fibers composed of multiple<br>
independent single nodes. Because the chain network and the star network can be regarded<br>
as the loop network in abnormal conditions, the above analysis of the network forming<br>
operation method for the loop network structures of the present invention is also<br>
applicable for the two networks.<br>
Fig.8 is an embodiment of network forming link of the RF systems and the centralized<br>
baseband system in the spread spectrum communication system in accordance with the<br>
present invention. Fig. 8 integrates three methods of loop network, star network and chain<br>
network for the RF systems. The first, each RF system connects with the centralized<br>
baseband system respectively, so that RF systems are star connected with each other; the<br>
second, multiple RF systems connect in series, and the RF system at one end connects<br>
with the centralized baseband system after the chain is composed; the third, multiple RF<br><br><br>
systems connect in series, and the RF systems at two ends connect with the centralized<br>
baseband system, and these RF systems make up of the loop. It should be noted that<br>
besides the three integrated network forming methods shown in fig. 8, it can be any of the<br>
above methods, one or two, connect with the centralized baseband system. In sum, the<br>
forward and reverse multiplexing mechanism according to the present invention is entirely<br>
appropriate to the network forming structure of any above combinations.<br>
It will be understood that the above embodiments are used only to explain but not to<br>
limit the present invention. In despite of the detailed description of the present invention<br>
with referring to above preferred embodiments, it should be understood that various<br>
modifications, changes or equivalents can be made by those skilled in the art without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. All of the modifications,<br>
changes or equivalents should be covered in the scope of accompanying claims of the<br>
