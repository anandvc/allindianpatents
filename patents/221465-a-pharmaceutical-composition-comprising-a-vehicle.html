				<td>The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001]       The present invention relates to a stable pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibacterial agent, in particular to a composition mat is readily dispersible in bodily fluids. The invention also relates to a process for preparing such a composition and to a method of treatment and/or prevention of diseases caused by bacterial infection in a fluid-containing organ such as an udder of a milk-producing animal or an ear, comprising administration of the composition to the fluid-containing organ.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002]       Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland of milk producing animals, for example dairy cows, most often caused by bacterial infection. Bacteria enter through the teat canal of the animal and can cause acute, clinical, or sub-clinical mastitis. Over 135 organisms have been documented as causative pathogens for bovine mastitis. Three of the major groups of pathogens are gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, and gram-positive bacilli. Hygiene, environmental factors, and metabolic disturbances deriving from high milk yield combine to create conditions favorable to the onset of mastitis. An increased somatic cell count, associated with mastitis, is positively correlated with infection and negatively correlated with milk production. Frequently, an infected cow must be removed from the herd and dried up. Mastitis often affects a cow during its entire life unless the disease is properly treated, and in extreme cases an animal may become so severely infected that she dies. Infection rates average fronrl0%to 30% of the cows in a typical herd, with losses per cow ranging from $185 to $250 per cow per year. Bovine mastitis is the most economically costly disease to the dairy industry, with losses estimated at two billion dollars annually in the United States alone. The majority of these losses are due to reduced milk production.<br>
[0003]       Intramammary administration of compositions comprising an antibiotic for prevention and treatment of mastitis in milk producing animals is well known. Several compositions suitable for such administration are formulated in aqueous based vehicles. [0004]       For example, British Patent Application No. 2,273,655 discloses compositions for intramammary use comprising an insoluble antibiotic in an aqueous suspension for treatment of mastitis.<br>

[0055] The most commonly used packaging containers and delivery devices for compositions intended for intramammary administration to treat and/or prevent mastitis in milk producing animals as well as for compositions for otic administration to treat ear infections are constructed of oxygen permeable plastic materials, for example polyethylene, polypropylene, etc. and mixtures thereof. The use of oxygen permeable packaging containers and delivery devices for anti-mastitis formulations and for compositions for treatment and prevention of ear infections, poses serious problems for long term chemical and/or physical stability of compositions comprising an ingredient, for example an active medicament or an excipient, that is prone to oxidative degradation. <br>
[0056] Although the references cited above disclose a number of compositions for treatment of mastitis and other disease conditions, none addresses the problem of providing extended chemical and/or physical stability of compositions packaged in oxygen permeable containers, where the composition comprises a pharmaceutically active substance that is prone to oxidative degradation. Despite the above teachings, there still exists a need in the art for pharmaceutical compositions having one or more of the following advantages over prior art compositions used in treatment and prevention of mastitis by intramammary infusion: (a) extended chemical and/or physical stability even when packaged in oxygen permeable containers and delivery devices, particularly where the composition comprises a pharmaceutically active substance that is prone to oxidative degradation, (b) efficacy against a wide variety of infectious organisms, (c) rapid dispersibility in milk and in udder fluids to achieve efficacious medicament levels at sites of infection, (d) short milkout times for lactating cows, (e) zero day slaughter meat withdrawal period, (f) short milk withholding times post calving after dry cow treatment, and (g) minimal to no irritation after administration. <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0057] Novel pharmaceutical compositions having some or all of the advantageous attributes described above have now been developed. Accordingly, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a vehicle that comprises (a) an amphipathic oil that is water dispersible and ethanol insoluble, (b) microcrystalline wax, and (c) a pharmaceutically acceptable non-aqueous carrier; said vehicle having stably dispersed therein an antibacterial substance in an antibacterially effective amount. <br>
[0058] In one embodiment the antibacterial substance is prone to oxidative degradation, and the composition exhibits extended chemical and/or physical stability when packaged in an oxygen permeable container or delivery device. Such a composition can, for example, be administered by intramammary infusion for treatment and/or prevention of mastitis or other diseases of the udder in a milk-producing animal, and is efficacious against a wide variety of infectious organisms. <br>
[0059] The novel anti-mastitis composition has a low interfacial tension in aqueous fluids, thereby increasing dispersibility of the composition in milk and udder fluids, as compared to a conventional oil based formulation. This results in rapid distribution of the composition throughout the udder and thereby allows the antibacterial substance to reach infected tissue quickly, providing an efficacious level of the antibacterial substance at a site of infection. The interfacial tension of a composition in an aqueous fluid determines the energy needed for dispersion and spreading of the composition in the fluid, as well as the energy necessary for a suspended particle in the composition to cross the oil/milk or oil/udder fluid interfacial boundary. <br>
[0060] Preferably the composition is one that produces suitably short milkout times. <br>
Milkout time for a lactating cow is the period of time from administration of a mastitis treatment to resumption of production of saleable milk. Following administration of a composition, the concentration of active substance in milk must be reduced to a level acceptable to health organizations before the milk is deemed suitable for human consumption. A suitably short milkout time reduces monetary losses to a dairy farmer caused by a mastitis outbreak. <br>
[0061] Preferably the composition is one that provides a low milk withholding time post calving after dry cow treatment, with no antibiotic residues in the offspring. <br>
[0062] Preferably the composition is one that provides a zero day slaughter meat withdrawal period. This attribute is especially important since it allows a farmer to dispose of a treated cow at any time it is financially advantageous, rather than being required to keep and feed a cow for a specified amount of time after its mastitis treatment. <br>
[0063] A composition of the invention can alternatively or in addition be useful for treatment and/or prevention of an infection of the ear, for which purpose it can be administered by infusion into the ear canal of a human, companion animal, horse, livestock, or the like. Such a composition is efficacious against a wide variety of infectious organisms. <br>
[0064] Thus a pharmaceutical composition as described above is provided for treatment and/or prevention of an ear infection, the composition having a low interfacial tension in an aqueous fluid, thereby increasing the dispersibility of the composition in the waxy moist environment of an ear, as compared to a conventional composition. The resulting rapid distribution of the composition throughout mucous membranes and lipid containing wax of the ear canal allows the antibacterial substance to reach infected tissue quickly, providing an efficacious level of the antibacterial substance at the site of infection. Such a pharmaceutical composition also produces a protective coating for inflamed mucous membranes of the ear. <br>
[0065] Preferably such a composition helps to dissolve wax deposits in the ear, thus permitting better penetration of the antibacterial substance. <br>
[0066] Preferably a composition of the invention has improved physical stability when compared to conventional oil and aqueous compositions, for example by virtue of improved composition resuspendability. A composition of the invention has been shown to cause flocculation of certain drugs, thereby improving resuspendability and eliminating the problem of suspension caking and possible delivery of a subpotent or non-efficacious dose. <br>
[0067] Preferably a composition of the invention produces minimal to no irritation after administration. <br>
[0068] A process is provided for preparing a pharmaceutical composition of the invention. The process comprises mixing, in any suitable order, an amphipathic oil that is water dispersible and ethanol insoluble, microcrystalline wax, a pharmaceutically acceptable non-aqueous carrier, and an antibacterial substance to provide a composition having extended chemical and/or physical stability as described herein. <br>
[0069] Also provided is a therapeutic method of treatment or prevention of a bacterial infection in a subject, the method comprising administration of a composition as described herein to a fluid-containing organ of the subject via a natural exterior orifice of the organ, wherein upon such administration the composition disperses in the fluid. For example, the organ can be an udder of a milk-producing animal, in which case administration is by infusion or injection via a teat canal. Alternatively, the organ can be an ear, in which case administration is by infusion or injection via the external auditory meatus of the ear. <br>
[0070] Accordingly, in one embodiment a method is provided for treatment and/or prevention of an infectious disease of an udder, for example mastitis, in a milk producing animal, the method comprising intramammary infusion of a composition as provided herein. <br>
[0071] More particularly, a method is provided for effecting targeted delivery of an antibacterial substance to a site of mastitis infection in a milk producing animal, the method comprising intramammary administration of a composition as provided herein, for example by infusion or injection, to the udder of the animal. <br>
[0072] In another embodiment a method is provided for treatment and/or prevention of an infectious disease of an ear in a subject, the method comprising infusion or injection of a composition as provided herein into the ear. <br>
[0073] More particularly, a method is provided for effecting targeted delivery of an antibacterial substance to a site of an ear infection in a subject, the method comprising infusion or injection of a composition as provided herein into the ear of the subject. <br>
[0074] The present invention provides solutions to several long-standing problems in the art and possesses one or more advantages over compositions of prior art. Other features, advantages and benefits of the invention will be apparent from the description that follows. <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0075] The invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a vehicle that comprises an amphipathic oil that is water dispersible and ethanol insoluble, microcrystalline wax, and a pharmaceutically acceptable non-aqueous carrier; said vehicle having stably dispersed therein an antibacterial substance in an antibacterially effective amount. The term"ethanol insoluble"means that the amphipathic oil is essentially insoluble in ethanol at 20°C. <br>
[0076] In a particular embodiment of the invention the antibacterial substance is prone to oxidative degradation. According to this embodiment, the composition exhibits extended chemical and/or physical stability even when packaged in an oxygen permeable container or delivery device. The term"extended chemical and/or physical stability" herein means that a composition of the invention has greater chemical and/or physical stability than a reference composition comprising the same antibacterial substance at the same concentration. A"reference composition"in the present context means a composition lacking one or both of the amphipathic oil and the microcrystalline wax, but otherwise similar to the composition of the invention. <br>
[0077] Oxygen permeable containers or delivery devices can be made of any suitable thermoplastic material including, but not limited to, polymers and copolymers of polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl chloride, and particularly polyolefins. <br>
Polyolefins include, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutenes, polyisoprenes, polypentenes, copolymers thereof, and the like, and mixtures thereof. <br>
[0078] Compositions for intramammary administration are commonly packaged in syringes that are provided with a cannula nozzle for insertion into the teat to allow extrusion directly into the mammary gland via the streak canal. Intramammary suspension formulations are generally prepared in thickened vehicles to prevent settling of drug particles into the cannula nozzle, which can cause nozzle plugging resulting in incomplete expulsion of the composition. <br>
[0079] Cephalosporins are a class of antibacterial substance, many of which have a broad spectrum of activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. <br>
[0080] In an early effort to develop an intramammary suspension of the cephalosporin ceftiofur, 12.5 mg/ml ceftiofur hydrochloride was suspended in a thickened vehicle comprising 20 mg/ml glyceryl monostearate in peanut oil. Although clinically efficacious, the potency of this composition fell to below 90% of label after storage for less than 18 months at room temperature when packaged in polyethylene syringes. Oxidative degradation of ceftiofur hydrochloride was determined to be the primary cause of this potency decline. A room temperature shelf life wherein at least 90% of label potency is retained for a minimum of 24 months is desired for an intramammary suspension. <br>
[0081] A number of ceftiofur hydrochloride suspension compositions were then prepared in a variety of thickened vehicles and packaged in oxygen permeable polyethylene syringes. Ceftiofur hydrochloride formulations at a concentration of 12.5 mg/ml were manufactured. All vehicles were based on cottonseed oil, with the following additional components: (1) 50 mg/ml microcrystalline wax. <br>
(2) 70 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 1. 0 mg/ml propyl gallate. <br>
(3) 100 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 50 mg/ml LabraflTM M-1944CS. <br>
(4) 40 mg/ml GelucireTM 62/05 + 10 mg/ml GelucireTM 33/01. <br>
(5) 70 mg/ml LexemulTM AR. <br>
(6) 2.5 mg/ml CoagulanTM GP-1. <br>
(7) 10 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 5 mg/ml Hydrofol GlyceridesTM T 57L. <br>
(8) 30 mg/ml DrewpolTM 10-10-S. <br>
(9) 15 mg/ml beeswax blend. <br>
(10) 60 mg/ml DrewpolTM 10-10-S. <br>
(11) 10 mg/ml beeswax blend + 50 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1944CS. <br>
(12) 100 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 1. 0 mg/ml propyl gallate. <br>
(13) 70 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 100 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1944CS. <br>
(14) 70 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 100 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1944CS + 0.2 mg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene. <br>
(15) 70 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 50 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1944CS + 1.0 mg/ml propyl gallate. <br>
(16) 70 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 50 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1944CS + 0.2 mg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene. <br>
(17) 50 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 1.0 mg/ml propyl gallate. <br>
(18) 100 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 100 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1944CS + 1.0 mg/ml propyl gallate. <br>
(19) 100 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 100 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1944CS + 0.2 mg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene. <br>
(20) 100 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 50 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1944CS + 1.0 mg/ml propyl gallate. <br>
(21) 100 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 50 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1944CS + 0.2 mg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene. <br>
(22) 50 mg/ml microcrystalline wax + 100 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1944CS + 0.2 mg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene. <br>
[0082] LabrafilTM M-1944CS is an amphipathic oil that is dispersible in water and is essentially insoluble in ethanol at 20°C. GelucireTM 62/05 and GelucireTM 33/01 are essentially inert excipients derived from natural hydrogenated food grade fats and oils. <br>
Lexemul AR is an acid stable cationic, self emulsifying glyceryl monostearate. <br>
"Beeswax blend"refers to a blend containing white beeswax, camauba wax and candelilla wax. Coagulants GP-1 is N-acyl glutamic acid diamide, an amino acid gelatinization agent for oil. Drewpol is a modified glyceride. <br>
[0083] Most surprisingly, it was discovered that after 24 months storage at room temperature in oxygen permeable polyethylene syringes, only those ceftiofur hydrochloride compositions comprising both LabraftlTM M-1944CS and microcrystalline wax provided formulations that maintained at least 90% of label potency. Estimated room temperature shelf lives for the ceftiofur hydrochloride formulations comprising both Labrafil M-1944CS and microcrystalline wax in cottonseed oil were 2.4 to 3.7 times greater than estimated room temperature shelf lives of comparable formulations which did not contain Labrafil M-1944CS. Additionally, while a ceftiofur hydrochloride composition comprising Labrafil M-1944CS and beeswax blend in cottonseed oil, stored at room temperature, had a potency of less than 90% after storage for 24 months in oxygen permeable polyethylene syringes at room temperature, a ceftiofur hydrochloride formulation of comparable viscosity comprising LabraflF M- 1944CS and microcrystalline wax in cottonseed oil exhibited a potency of greater than 90% of label after 24 months in the same storage conditions. <br>

[0123] The most preferred cephalosporins for use according to the present invention are ceftiofur and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. <br>
[0124] Where the antibiotic is ceftiofur or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a preferred concentration range in a composition of the invention is about 1 to about 1000 mg/ml, more preferably about 5 to about 750 mg/ml, and still more preferably about 10 to about 100 mg/ml. For antibacterials other than ceftiofur, suitable concentration ranges that are antibacterially equivalent can be determined by one of skill in the art based upon published data. <br>
[0125] The term"amphipathic oil"is defined as a substance with a distinctly polar region and a distinctly non-polar region. Structurally these two regions of the amphipathic oil are sufficiently far apart that the unique properties of the two regions are distinctly separate. <br>
[0126] Amphipathic oils applicable to the current invention include all amphipathic oils that are water dispersible and ethanol insoluble. <br>
[0127] Preferred such amphipathic oils are polyglycolized glycerides prepared by an alcoholosis reaction of natural triglycerides with polyethylene glycols, and examples include, but are not limited to, the following Gattefossé oils or substantially equivalent oils from another manufacturer: LabrafilTM M-1944CS, LabrafilTM M-1966CS, LabrafilTM M-1969CS, LabrafilTM M-1980CS, LabrafilTM M-2125CS, LabrafilTM WL-2609BS, LabrafilTM ISO, and combinations thereof. <br>
[0128] Still more preferred amphipathic oils are polyglycolized glycerides prepared as above, comprising a main fatty acid component of either oleic acid or linoleic acid, and examples include, but are not limited to, the following Gattefossé oils or substantially equivalent oils from another manufacturer: LabrafilTM M-1944CS, LabrafilTM M-1966CS, LabrafilTM M-1969CS, LabrafilTM M-1980CS, LabrafilTM M-2125CS, LabrafilTM WL-2609BS, and combinations thereof. <br>
[0129] Still more preferred amphipathic oils are polyglycolized glycerides prepared as above, comprising a main fatty acid component of oleic acid, and examples include, but are not limited to, the following Gattefossé oils or substantially equivalent oils from another manufacturer: LabrafilTM M-1944CS, LabrafilTM M-1966CS, LabrafilTM M- 1980CS, and combinations thereof. <br>
[0130] The most preferred amphipathic oil is pegicol 5-oleate, for example LabrafilTM M-1944CS of Gattfossé Corporation. <br>
[0131] A preferred concentration range for the amphipathic oil in a composition of the invention is about 0.01% to about 99% weight/volume, more preferably about 1% to about 80% weight/volume, and still more preferably about 3% to about 25% weight/volume. <br>
[0132] Microcrystalline wax is as defined for example in Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd ed. or in National Formulary, 19th ed. (NF 19) and can be obtained from a number of manufacturers including Witco Corporation. <br>
[0133] A preferred concentration range for microcrystalline wax in a composition of the invention is about 0. 01% to about 50% weight/volume, more preferably about 1% to about 40% weight/volume, and still more preferably about 3% to about 15% weight/volume. <br>
[0134] Pharmaceutically acceptable non-aqueous carriers of the invention can be fully saturated, or partially or fully unsaturated. Examples of non-aqueous carriers include, but are not limited to, vegetable oils (such as cottonseed oil, corn oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, olive oil, fractionated coconut oils, peanut oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, almond oil, avocado oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, babassu oil, beechnut oil, linseed oil, rape oil, and the like), mineral oils, synthetic oils, and combinations thereof. Examples of fully saturated non-aqueous carriers include, but are not limited to, esters of medium to large chain fatty acids (such as fatty acid triglycerides with a chain length of about C6 to about C24). Mixtures of fatty acids are split from the natural oil (for example coconut oil palm kernel oil, babassu oil, or the like) and are refined. In some embodiments, about C$ to about C12 fatty acid medium chain triglycerides are useful. An illustrative saturated non-aqueous carrier comprises capric acid (about 20% to about 45% by weight of the carrier) and caprylic acid (about 45% to about 80% by weight of the carrier). Other fully saturated non-aqueous carriers include, but are not limited to, saturated coconut oil (which typically includes a mixture of lauric, myristic, palmitic, capric and capric acids), including those sold under the Miglyol trademark from Huls and bearing trade designations 810,812, 829, and 840). Also noted are the NeoBeeTM products sold by Drew Chemicals. Isopropyl myristate is another example of a non-aqueous carrier useful in compositions of the invention. Examples of synthetic oils include triglycerides, and propylene glycol diesters of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids having from 6 to 24 carbon atoms such as, for example hexanoic acid, octanoic (caprylic), nonanoic (pelargonic), decanoic (capric), undecanoic, lauric, tridecanoic, tetradecanoic (myristic), pentadecanoic, hexadecanoic (palmitic), heptadecanoic, octadecanoic (stearic), nonadecanoic, heptadecanoic, eicosanoic, heneicosanoic, docosanoic, and lignoceric acids, and the like. Examples of unsaturated carboxylic acids include oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids, and the like. It is understood that the non-aqueous carrier can comprise the mono-, di-, and glyceryl esters of fatty acids or mixed glycerides and/or propylene glycol diesters wherein at least one molecule of glycerol has been esterified with fatty acids of varying carbon atom length. A non-limiting example of a"non-oil"of the present invention is polyethylene glycol. <br>
[0135] Preferred non-aqueous carriers are selected from the group consisting of cottonseed oil, corn oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, almond oil, avocado oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, babassu oil, beechnut oil, linseed oil, rape oil, and fractionated coconut oil. <br>
[0136] The most preferred non-aqueous carrier is cottonseed oil. By way of example cottonseed oil is available in a preparation of 70% unsaturated fatty acids from Sigma Chemical Co. <br>
[0137] A preferred concentration range for the non-aqueous carrier in a composition of the invention is about 0.5% to about 99% weight/volume, more preferably about 10% to about 95% weight/volume, and still more preferably about 40% to about 90% weight/volume. <br>
[0138] A composition of the invention can be admixed with any conventional pharmaceutical additive which does not deleteriously react with the composition, including, but not limited to, antioxidants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, lubricants, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, coloring agents, alcohols, buffering agents, other conventional pharmaceutical additives, and combinations thereof. <br>
Examples include, but are not limited to, tocopherols, ascorbyl palmitate, butyl hydroxyanisole, butyl hydroxytoluene, benzoic acid, benzoic acid derivatives, ethylenediamine, sodium bisulfite, sulfur dioxide, maleic acid, propyl gallate, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, carbohydrates (such as lactose, amylose, and starch), and combinations thereof. <br>
[0139] Methods of administration of a composition of the invention are described herein as involving"infusion"or an"infusing"step. The terms"infusion"and"infusing" herein refer to a process of delivering a liquid composition directly into a fluid-containing organ, and encompass injection, for example using a syringe, that is completed within a very short space of time as well as more prolonged delivery. <br>
[0140] A composition of the invention can be administered for treatment or prevention of mastitis by inserting the cannula nozzle of a mastitis syringe into the external orifice of the streak canal of an udder of a milk producing animal and infusing the composition into the udder. <br>
[0141] A composition of the invention can be administered for treatment or prevention of an ear infection by inserting the nozzle of an ear syringe, otic drop dispenser, or other appropriate otic delivery device into the external auditory canal of the ear of a subject and infusing the composition into the ear. <br>
[0142] It will be appreciated that the preferred amounts of compositions to be administered in a specific case will vary according to the specific composition being utilized, the mode of application, the particular situs and organism being treated, and other factors. Dosages for a given purpose can be determined using conventional considerations, for example, by customary comparison of the differential activities of the subject compositions and of a known agent, e. g., by means of an appropriate conventional pharmaceutical protocol. <br>
[0143] An illustrative suspension of the invention containing as the antibacterial substance ceftiofur hydrochloride has the following composition: antibacterial substance 1-1000 mg/ml LabrafilTMM-1944CS 0.01-99% microcrystalline wax 0.01-50% cottonseed oil 0.5-99% (all percentages are weight/volume). <br>
EXAMPLES [0144] The following examples illustrate aspects of the present invention but should not be construed as limitations. <br>
Example 1 [0145] A suspension to be administered by intramammary infusion for treatment and/or prevention of lactating cow mastitis was prepared having the following composition: ceftiofur hydrochloride (micronized) 12.5 mg/ml LabraflTM M-1944CS 50 mg/ml microcrystalline wax NF 70 mg/ml cottonseed oil NF q. s. <br>
[0146] The microcrystalline wax and approximately 27% of the total amount of the cottonseed oil were heated to 85-98°C with mixing, in a kettle. The balance of the cottonseed oil was heated to 85-98°C with mixing, in a manufacturing tank. After the microcrystalline wax was completely melted the microcrystalline wax/cottonseed oil mixture in the kettle was transferred to the manufacturing tank containing cottonseed oil and mixed thoroughly. The resulting mixture was cooled to 38-45°C and the Labrafil M-1944CS was added to the manufacturing tank with mixing to form a vehicle. The ceftiofur hydrochloride was then added to the vehicle and the resulting composition was mixed to form a uniform suspension. The suspension was screened and filled into 12 ml high density polyethylene mastitis syringes. The packaged product was terminally sterilized by gamma irradiation at a dose of 25-40 kGy. <br>
[0147] The interfacial tension of the above suspension was determined using the drop volume technique by comparison with that of a reference suspension prepared with 70 mg/ml microcrystalline wax in cottonseed oil but without LabrafilTM M-1944CS. The interfacial tension of the suspension containing both Labrafil M-1944Cs and microcrystalline wax in cottonseed oil was 3.4 times lower than that of the reference suspension. <br>

[0149] The microcrystalline wax and cottonseed oil were heated to 85-98°C with mixing, in a manufacturing tank. After the microcrystalline wax was completely melted the mixture was cooled to 38-45°C and the LabrafilTM M-1944CS was added to the manufacturing tank with mixing. Ceftiofur hydrochloride was then added to the resulting vehicle and mixed to form a uniform suspension. The suspension was screened and filled into 12 ml high density polyethylene mastitis syringes. The packaged product was terminally sterilized by gamma irradiation at a dose of 25-40 kGy. <br>
[0150] The interfacial tension of the above suspension was determined using the drop volume technique by comparison with that of a reference suspension prepared with 100 mg/ml microcrystalline wax in cottonseed oil but without LabrafilTM M-1944CS. The interfacial tension of the suspension containing both Labrafil M-1944Cs and microcrystalline wax in cottonseed oil was 4.0 times lower than that of the reference suspension. <br>
Example 3 [0151] A suspension to be administered by intramammary infusion for treatment and/or prevention of lactating cow mastitis was prepared having the following composition: ceftiofur hydrochloride (micronized) 12.5 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1944CS 200 mg/ml microcrystalline wax NF 100 mg/ml cottonseed oil NF q. s. <br>

After the microcrystalline wax was completely melted the mixture was cooled to 38-45°C and LabrafilTM M-1944CS was added to the manufacturing tank with mixing. The ceftiofur hydrochloride was then added to the resulting vehicle and mixed to form a uniform suspension. The suspension was screened and filled into 12 ml high density polyethylene mastitis syringes. The packaged product was terminally sterilized by gamma irradiation at a dose of 25-40 kGy. <br>
[0153] The interfacial tension of the above suspension was determined using the drop volume technique by comparison with that of a reference suspension prepared with 100 mg/ml microcrystalline wax in cottonseed oil but without LabrafilTM M-1944CS. The interfacial tension of the suspension containing both Labrafil M-1944CS and microcrystalline wax in cottonseed oil was more than 28 times lower than that of the reference suspension. <br>
Example 4 [0154] A suspension to be administered by intramammary infusion for treatment and/or prevention of lactating and dry cow mastitis is prepared having the following composition: ceftiofur crystalline free acid (micronized) 25.0 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1966CS 100 mg/ml microcrystalline wax NF 50 mg/ml corn oil NF q. s. <br>
[0155] The microcrystalline wax and the corn oil are heated to 85-98°C with mixing, in a manufacturing tank. After the microcrystalline wax is completely melted, the mixture is cooled to 30-45°C and the LabrafilTM M-1966CS is added to the manufacturing tank with mixing. The ceftiofur crystalline free acid is added to the vehicle and mixed to form a uniform suspension. The suspension is screened and filled into 12 ml high density polyethylene mastitis syringes. The packaged product is terminally sterilized by gamma irradiation at a dose of 25-40 kGy. <br>

The balance of the mineral oil is heated to 85-98°C with mixing, in a manufacturing tank. After the microcrystalline wax is completely melted, the microcrystalline wax/mineral oil mixture in the kettle is transferred to the manufacturing tank containing mineral oil and mixed thoroughly. The resulting mixture is cooled to 38-45°C and the LabrafilTM M-1980CS is added to the manufacturing tank with mixing. The ceftiofur hydrochloride is then added to the resulting vehicle and mixed to form a uniform suspension. The suspension is screened and filled into 20 ml polypropylene containers. <br>
Example 6 [0158] A suspension to be administered by intramammary infusion for treatment and/or prevention of dry cow mastitis was prepared having the following composition: ceftiofur hydrochloride (micronized) 50 mg/ml LabrafilTM M-1944CS 50 mg/ml microcrystalline wax NF 70 mg/ml cottonseed oil NF q. s. <br>
[0159] The microcrystalline wax and approximately 27% of the total amount of the cottonseed oil were heated to 85-98°C with mixing, in a kettle. The balance of the cottonseed oil was heated to 85-98°C with mixing, in a manufacturing tank. After the microcrystalline wax was completely melted the microcrystalline wax/cottonseed oil mixture in the kettle was transferred to the manufacturing tank containing cottonseed oil and mixed thoroughly. The resulting mixture was cooled to 38-45°C and the LabrafilTM M-1944CS was added to the manufacturing tank with mixing. The ceftiofur hydrochloride was then added to the resulting vehicle and mixed to form a uniform suspension. The suspension was screened and filled into 12 ml high density polyethylene mastitis syringes. The packaged product was terminally sterilized by gamma irradiation at a dose of 25-40 kGy. <br>
Example 7 [0160] A suspension to be administered by intramammary infusion for treatment and/or prevention of lactating cow mastitis is prepared having the following composition: ceftiofur sodium (micronized) 20 mg/ml LabrafilTM WL-2609BS 75 mg/ml microcrystalline wax NF 100 mg/ml Miglyol 812 q. s. <br>
[0161] The microcrystalline wax and approximately 30% of the total amount of the Miglyol 812 are heated to 85-98°C with mixing, in a kettle. The balance of the Miglyol 812 is heated to 85-98°C with mixing, in a manufacturing tank. After the microcrystalline wax is completely melted the microcrystalline wax/MiglyolTM 812 mixture in the kettle is transferred to the manufacturing tank containing the Miglyol 812 and mixed thoroughly. The resulting mixture is cooled to 38-45°C and the Labrafil WL-2609BS is added to the manufacturing tank with mixing. The ceftiofur sodium is added to the resulting vehicle and mixed to form a uniform suspension. The suspension is screened and filled into 12 ml high density polyethylene mastitis syringes. <br>
The packaged product is terminally sterilized by gamma irradiation at a dose of 25-40 kGy. <br>
