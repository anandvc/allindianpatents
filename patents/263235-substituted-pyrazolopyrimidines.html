FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to chemical compositions, processes for the<br>
preparation thereof and uses of the composition. Particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to compositions that include substituted heterobicyclic pyrimidines of Formula<br>
(I):<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, X, W, and ring A are as defined herein; pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of substituted heterobicyclic pyrimidines of Formula (I); and their use in<br>
the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative diseases, neurotraumatic diseases,<br>
depression and/or diabetes. More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
substituted pyrazolopyrimidines of Formula (I).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to novel substituted heterobicyclic pyrimidine compounds,<br>
in particular substituted pyrazolopyrimidine oxindoles, that act as inhibitors of glycogen<br>
synthase kinase 3 and cyclin dependant kinase 5.<br>
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase<br>
composed of two isoforms (a and ß encoded by different genes. GSK3 is highly<br>
expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system, with GSK3ß predominating in<br>
the brain. Both isoforms of GSK3 phosphorylate and regulate the activity of several<br>
protein substrates, including glycogen synthase, ß-catenin, pyruvate dehydrogenase,<br>
elongation intiation factor 2b, and tau. GSK3 is regulated by insulin, which stimulates<br>
glycogen synthesis via receptor activation of PI3 kinase and protein kinase B. PKB<br>
phosphorylates GSK3ß on serine 9, resulting in its inactivation. Insulin also activates<br>
protein phosphatase 1. Both of these actions of insulin lead to dephosphorylation and<br>
activation of glycogen synthase (Srivastava and Pandey, Mol Cell Biochem.l82:135-<br>
141,1998; Cohen, Biochem See Trans., 21:555-567,1993), and production of glycogen<br>
from glucose. ß-catenin degradation is increased following phosphorylation by GSK3<br>
(Ikeda, et al., EMBO, 17:1371-1384,1998). The reduction in available ß-catenin may<br>
increase the sensitivity of neurons to amyloid ß (Aß) toxicity (Zhang, et al., Nature,<br>
395:698-702,1998). GSK3ß also phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase and prevents<br>
the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA (Hoshi, et al., PNAS, 93:2719-2723,1996).<br>
This acetyl CoA is critical for the synthesis of acetylcholine, the loss of which is<br>
implicated in the cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). GSK3a regulates<br>
production of Aß from the amyloid precursor protein (Phiel, et al., Nature. 423:435-9,<br>
2003). Two proteases, ß- and ?-secreatase liberate the amino and carboxy terminus<br>
(respectively) of Aß. In a concentration dependant manner, Aß precipitates into toxic,<br>
fibrillary species in the AD brain and is thought to lead to additional sequalae of the<br>
disease. Phosphorylation of eIF2B by GSK-3ß reduces protein translation. eIF2B<br>
activation by IGF1 is mediated by the inactivation of GSK3ß (Welsh, et al., FEBS Letts,<br>
421:125-130,1997). The role of tau phosphorylation by GSK3 will be discussed<br>
following description of CDK5.<br>
Cyclin Dependant Kinase 5 (CDK5) is also a serine/threonine protein kinase,<br>
and is structurally related to GSK 3. CDK5 activation predominates in the nervous<br>
system due to expression of p35, an accessory protein related to cyclins and necessary<br>
for CDK5 activity (Dhavan and Tsai, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, 2:749-759,2001). Unlike<br>
CDK1,2,4, and 6 which are active in the cell cycle, CDK5 is activated in neurons after<br>
cell division has ended, following differentiation and expression of p35. CDK5 activity<br>
is regulated by expression of p35 and a calpain-cleaved form of p35, known as p25<br>
(Patzke and Tsai, J Biol Chem, 277:8054-8060,2002). The generation of p25 leads to<br>
increased and mislocalized CDK5 activity since 1) p25 is missing the membrane<br>
localizing portion found in p35, and 2) p25 has a longer resident half life in the<br>
cytoplasm. CDK5 phosphorylates a number of substrates including DARPP-32, NR2a<br>
(NMDA receptor subunit), MEF-2, PSD-95, synaptojanin-1, CRMP2, and tau. DARPP-<br>
32 phosphorylation by CDK5 at thr75 leads to the inhibition of PKA in the dopamine 1<br>
receptor (Dl) signaling cascade, thereby inhibiting Dl signaling (Bibb, et al., Nature,<br>
402:669-671 1997). Facilitation of Dl signaling may be useful for the treatment of<br>
depression or Parkinson's Disease (Chergui, et al., PNAS, 10:2191-2196,2004). NR2a<br>
phosphorylation by CDK5 modulates long term potentiation and may induce apoptotic<br>
cell death following ischemia (Wang, et al., Nat Neurosci., 6:1039-47,2003). CDK5-<br>
dependent phosphorylation of PSD-95 dynamically regulates the clustering of PSD-<br>
95/NMDA receptors at synapses, providing a possible mechanism for rapid changes in<br>
density and/or number of synaptic receptors (Morabito, et. al., J Neurosci., 24:865-876,<br>
2004). CDK5 also phosphorylates the presynaptic phosphatase synaptojanin 1 and<br>
regulates its function both in vitro and in intact synaptosomes (Lee, et. al., PNAS,<br>
101:546-551,2004). CRMP2 is also phosphorylated by CDK5, leading to a reduction in<br>
CRMP-tubulin binding affinity and modulating growth cone collapse. CDK5 primarily<br>
phosphorylates CRMP2 at Ser.522 and GSK3ß secondarily phosphorylates at Thr509.<br>
Dual-phosphorylated CRMP2 s recognized with the antibody 3F4, highly reactive with<br>
the neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) of AD brain (Uchida, et al., Genes Cells, 10:165-179,<br>
2005). Overall, the role of CDK5 in synaptic formation and function is well<br>
substantiated.<br>
Experimental evidence supports a role for both GSK3 and CDK5 in the tangle<br>
and plaque pathology of AD, namely in the tau hyperphosphorylation that leads to NFT<br>
formation. AD brain is characterized by intracellular NFTs and extracellular senile<br>
plaques consisting of Aß deposits. Both of these protein aggregates are thought to<br>
precipitate the neuronal and synaptic loss, leading to the memory loss and cognitive<br>
decline of AD (Hardy, J Mol Ncurosci, 20:203-6, 2003).<br>
NFTs are composed of hyperphosphorylated, aggregated forms of the neuron<br>
specific, cytoskeletal protein tau (Cairns, et. al., J Pathol, 204:438-449,2004). The<br>
primary function of tau is to stabilize neuronal microtubules, to maintain axonal<br>
architecture, and to allow transport of materials both from the cell body to the synapse,<br>
and from the synapse back to the cell body. In AD, tau is hyperphosphorylated at many<br>
serine/threonine residues, leading to poor binding of tau to the microtubule and loss of<br>
trophic interplay between the cell body and the synapse. NFTs represent one of the<br>
characteristic features of the AD brain, and are also present in the brains of individuals<br>
with progressive supranuclear pafcsy, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17,<br>
Neimann-Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,<br>
dementia puglistica, etc.<br>
NFTs are composed of insoluble aggretates of tau protein, hyperphosphorylated<br>
on many serine and threonine residues and formed into paired helical filaments. The<br>
hyperphosphorylation of tau results in a lower affinity for the microtubule and may<br>
represent the first step toward aggregate formation. Both CDK5 and GSK3<br>
phosphorylate tau in both cell-free and cell-based in vitro systems at many of the same<br>
sites present in the AD brain. Antibodies directed against both GSK3 (Pei, et. al., J.<br>
Neuropath. Exp. Neurol., 58: 1010-1019,1999) and CDK5 (Pei, et. al., Brain Res,<br>
797:267-277,1998) decorate the NFTs in the AD brain, demonstrating the close<br>
association between these kinases and the hyperphosphorylated tau that comprises the<br>
tangles. Overexpression of either kinase activity in transgenic animal models (Lucas, et<br>
al., EMBO J., 20:27-39,2001; Cruz, et al., Neuron, 40:471-83,2003) also demonstrates<br>
their ability to hyperphosphorylate tau (both CDK5 and GSK3) and cause the formation<br>
of mature NFTs and neuronal toss (CDK5). Phosphorylation by GSK3 at many epitopes<br>
requires prior phosphorylation by a so called "priming" kinase C-terminal to the GSK3<br>
phosphorylation site (Cohen and Goedert, Nat Rev Drug Discov, 3:479-487,2004).<br>
Interestingly, CDK5 has been implicated as a priming kinase (at phosphoserine 235) for<br>
GSK3, which acts to phosphorylate threonine 231, a site that is phosphorylated early in<br>
the progression of AD NFT pathology (Augustinack, et. al., Acta Neuropathol (Berl).<br>
103:26-35,2002; Li T, Hawkes C, Qureshi HY, Kar S, Paudel HK, Biochemistry,<br>
45:3145-4154,2006).<br>
Other disease states in which GSK3 is thought to play a role include cerebral<br>
ischemia. GSK3 activity is increased in cellular and animal models of both<br>
neurodegeneration and apoptosis, such as cerebral ischemia (Bhat, et al., PNAS,<br>
97:11074-11079,2000). Lithium, as a representative GSK3 inhibitor, is neuroprotective<br>
in these models (Ren, et al., PNAS, USA, 100:6210-6215,2003). Lithium inhibits<br>
GSK3 at concentrations also known to be therapeutic in bipolar disorder (Gould, et al., J<br>
Clin Psychiatry, 65:10-21,2004), implicating GSK3 inhibition as a therapeutic avenue<br>
in this disease.<br>
GSK3 activity is increased in peripheral lymphocytes and brains of patients with<br>
schizophrenia, as evidenced by reduced levels of both the upstream inhibiting kinase<br>
AKT1, and the inhibitory ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3ß (Emamian, et al., Nat Genet,<br>
36:131-137,2004) Clinical treatment leads to normalization of this pathway.<br>
Diabetes mellitus type 2 is characterized by reduced insulin production due to<br>
loss of pancreatic beta cells following a period of reduced insulin sensitivity. With the<br>
insulin receptor signaling dysfunction that is also present in the disease, direct inhibition<br>
of GSK3 has been hypothesized 1o relieve the hyperglycemia and allow for normal<br>
glycogen synthesis and glucose utilization (Wagman, et al., Curr Pharm Des.,10:l 105-<br>
1137,2004).<br>
These compounds as GSK3 inhibitor are indicated to be useful for the treatment<br>
and/or prophylaxis of conditions in which mere is a need for inhibition of GSK3, such<br>
as diabetes, conditions associated with diabetes, chronic neurodegenerative diseases<br>
such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parldnson's Disease, progressive supranuclear palsy,<br>
subacute panencephalitic parkinsonism, postencephalitic parkinsonism, dementia<br>
puglistica, guan-parkinsonial dementia complex, Pick's disease, corticobasal<br>
degeneration, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism, Huntington's disease, AIDS<br>
associated dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and<br>
neurotraumatic diseases such as acute stroke, mood disorders such as schizophrenia and<br>
bipolar disorders, promotion of functional recovery post stroke, cerebral bleeding<br>
(solitary cerebral amyloid anigopathy), hair loss, obesity, atherosclerotic cardiovascular<br>
disease, hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome, syndrome X, ischemia, traumatic<br>
brain injury, cancer, leukopenia, Down's syndrome, Lewy body disease, inflammation<br>
and immunodeficiency.<br>
These compounds as CDK5 inhibitors are indicated to be useful for the treatment<br>
and/or prophylaxis of conditions in which there is a need for inhibition of CDK5 such as<br>
the chronic neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's Disease,<br>
progressive supranuclear palsy, subacute panencephalitic parkinsonism, postencephalitic<br>
parkinsonism, dementia puglistica, guan-parkinsonial dementia complex, Pick's disease,<br>
corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism, Huntington's<br>
disease, AIDS-associated dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and mood disorders<br>
such as depression.<br>

properties. It has been discovered that a class of compounds, referred to herein as<br>

or intermediates.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the present invention can<br>
also exist as various solvates, such as with water, methanol, ethanol,<br>
dimethylformamide, ethyl acetate and the like. Mixtures of such solvates can also be<br>
prepared. The source of such solvate can be from the solvent of crystallization, inherent<br>
in the solvent of preparation or crystallization, or adventitious to such solvent. Such<br>
solvates are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The present invention also encompasses the pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
prodrugs of the compounds disclosed herein. As used herein, "prodrug" is intended to<br>
include any compounds which are converted by metabolic processes within the body of<br>
a subject to an active agent that has a formula within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Since prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals<br>
(e.g., solubility, bioavailability, manufacturing, etc.) the compounds of the present<br>
invention may be delivered in prodrug form. Conventional procedures for the selection<br>
and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in Prodrugs,<br>
Sloane, K. B., Ed.; Marcel Dekker: New York, 1992, incorporated by reference herein<br>
in its entirety. Accordingly, prodrugs include, for example, compounds of the present<br>
invention wherein a hydroxy, amino, or carboxy group is bonded to any group that,<br>
when the prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free<br>
hydroxyl, free amino, or carboa ylic acid, respectively. Examples include, but are not<br>
limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional<br>
groups; and alkyl, carbocyclic, aryl, and alkylaryl esters such as methyl, ethyl, propyl,<br>
iso-propyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, cyclopropyl, phenyl, benzyl, and<br>
phenethyl esters, and the like.<br>
As used herein, "prodrug of an amino group" is intended to include a chemical<br>
moiety bonded to an amino group on a compound of the present invention, wherein<br>
when the compound of the present invention is administered to a mammalian subject,<br>
the chemical moiety bonded to :he amino group cleaves to form a free amino,<br>
respectively. Examples include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate<br>
derivatives of amine functional groups, as well as alkyl-C(=O)-, alkenyl-C(=O)-,<br>

It is recognized that compounds of the present invention may exist in various<br>
stereoisomeric forms. As such, the compounds of the present invention include both<br>
diastereomers and enantiomers. The compounds are normally prepared as racemates<br>
and can conveniently be used as such, but individual enantiomers can be isolated or<br>
synthesized by conventional techniques if so desired. Such racemates and individual<br>
enantiomers and mixtures thereof form part of the present invention.<br>
It is well known in the art how to prepare and isolate such optically active forms.<br>
Specific stereoisomers can be prepared by stereospecific synthesis using<br>
enantiomerically pure or enantiomerically enriched starting materials. The specific<br>
stereoisomers of either starting materials or products can be resolved and recovered by<br>
techniques known in the art, such as resolution of racemic forms, normal, reverse-phase,<br>
and chiral chromatography, recrystallization, enzymatic resolution, or fractional<br>
recrystallization of addition salts formed by reagents used for that purpose. Useful<br>
methods of resolving and recovering specific stereoisomers described in Eliel, E. L.;<br>
Wilen, S.H. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds; Wiley: New York, 1994, and<br>
Jacques, J, et al. Enantiomen, Racemates, and Resolutions; Wiley: New York, 1981,<br>
each incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.<br>
It is further recognized that functional groups present on the compounds of<br>
Formula (I) may contain protecting groups. For example, the amino acid side chain<br>
substituents of the compounds of Formula (I) can be substituted with protecting groups<br>
such as benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl groups. Protecting groups are known<br>
per se as chemical functional groups mat can be selectively appended to and removed<br>
from functionalities, such as hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups. These groups are<br>
present in a chemical compound to render such functionality inert to chemical reaction<br>
conditions to which the compound is exposed. Any of a variety of protecting groups<br>
may be employed with the present invention. Preferred protecting groups include the<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz; Z) group and the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group. Other<br>
preferred protecting groups according to the invention may be found in Greene, T.W.<br>
and Wuts, P.G.M., "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" 2d. Ed., Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
1991.<br>
Synthesis<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared in a number of<br>
methods well known to those skilled in the art, including, but not limited to those<br>
described below, or through modifications of these methods by applying standard<br>
techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. All processes<br>
disclosed in association with the present invention are contemplated to be practiced on<br>
any scale, including milligram, gram, multigram, kilogram, multikilogram or<br>
commercial industrial scale.<br>
It will be appreciated that he compounds of the present invention may contain<br>
one or more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms, and may be isolated in optically<br>
active or racemic forms. Thus, all chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms and all<br>
geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry<br>
or isomeric form is specifically indicated. It is well known in the art how to prepare<br>
such optically active forms. For example, mixtures of stereoisomers may be separated<br>
by standard techniques including, but not limited to, resolution of racemic forms,<br>
normal, reverse-phase, and chiral chromatography, preferential salt formation,<br>
recrystallization, and the like, or by chiral synthesis either from active starting materials<br>
or by deliberate chiral synthesis of target centers.<br>
As will be readily understood, functional groups present on the compounds of<br>
Formula (I) may contain protecting groups. For example, the amino acid side chain<br>
substituents of the compounds of Formula (I) can be substituted with protecting groups<br>
such as benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl groups. Protecting groups are known<br>
per se as chemical functional groups that can be selectively appended to and removed<br>
from functionalities, such as hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups. These groups are<br>
present in a chemical compound to render such functionality inert to chemical reaction<br>
conditions to which the compound is exposed. Any of a variety of protecting groups<br>
may be employed with the present invention. Preferred protecting groups include the<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz; Z) group and the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group. Other<br>
preferred protecting groups according to the invention may be found in Greene, T.W.<br>
and Wuts, P.G.M., "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" 2d. Ed., Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
1991.<br>
General routes to prepare the Examples of the present invention are shown in the<br>
Schemes and examples that follow. The reagents and starting materials are<br>
commercially available and/or, using well-known techniques, can be readily synthesized<br>
by one of ordinary skill in the art. All substituents in the synthetic Schemes, unless<br>
otherwise indicated, are as previously defined.<br>
Compounds of invention can be synthesized following various synthetic<br>
schemes disclosed herein.<br>

minutes and the mixture was stirred under argon overnight at room temperature. 135<br>
mL of 6N hydrochloric acid were then added dropwise and the mixture was refluxed for<br>
one hour. The reaction was permitted to cool to room temperature and a white solid was<br>
removed by filtration. The mother liquor was concentrated and residual water was<br>
removed by azeotroping with ethanol on a rotary evaporator (3 X 100 mL). The mixture<br>
was concentrated to dryness and was taken up into hot isopropanol (~300 mL). The<br>
solid that was present was removed by filtration and the mother liquor was concentrated<br>
to ½ volume at which point an equal volume of ethyl ether was added. This caused<br>

possible tautomeric forms - signal positions only and no integrations are given for the<br>
N-2 series due to inability to assign protons.<br>
Utility<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted heterobicyclic pyrimidine<br>
compounds, in particular substituted pyrazolopyrimidine oxindoles, that act as inhibitors<br>
of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and/or cyclin dependant kinase 5, and their use in the<br>
treatment of chronic neurodegenerative diseases, neurotraumatic diseases, depression<br>
and/or diabetes. Compounds of the present invention are well suited as inhibitors of<br>
GSK-3ß activity and/or CDK5 activity. Representative compounds of the invention<br>
have exhibited good in vitro potency against GSK-3ß kinase and/or CDK5 kinase. Table<br>
7 below provides data related to several example compounds of the invention with<br>
respect to, for example, ability to inhibit GSK-3ß activity and/or CDK5 activity.<br>
Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the<br>
prention and/or treatment of conditions mediated by GSK-30 activity and/or CDK5<br>
activity.<br>
Cloning, Expression and Purification of CDK5/GST-p25<br>
Two recombinant baculoviral constructs were created, one encoding for human<br>
CDK5 and the other encoding for human p25 with an arnino-terminal glutathione-S-<br>
transferase (GST) tag. PCR amplification of full-length CDK5 was performed utilizing<br>
human brain cDNA as a template and Pfu Turbo polymerase (Strategene). The PCR<br>
product from this reaction was subcloned into the baculoviral expression vector<br>
pFASTBACl (Gibco/BRL). The final construct, encoding for full-length human CDK5<br>
(base pairs 25-903 of GenBank Accession #NM_004935), is 292 amino acids long with<br>
a predicted MW of 33.3 kDa.<br>
For p25, the active truncated form of p35, amino acids 108-307 were PCR-<br>
amplified from human fetal brain cDNA (Clontech QUICK-Clone cDNA) using the<br>
Advantage 2 PCR system (Clontech). The PCR product was subcloned into the<br>
baculoviral transfer vector pFBGSTP (an engineered derivative of the baculoviral<br>
transfer vector pFASTBACl). The final baculoviral construct encodes for base pairs<br>
419-1021 of GenBank Accession ;MNM_003885, with an amino-terminal GST tag. The<br>
expressed GST-p25 is 444 amino acids long with a predicted MW of 50.3 kDa.<br>
The CDK5/GST-p25 complex was generated by coexpression. Sf21 cells were<br>
cultured in TNM-FHS media at a density of 1.5 x 106 cells/mL and infected with each<br>
recombinant virus at MOI values of 5 (for CDK5) and 10 (for GST-p25). The cells<br>
were harvested 40 h after infection For purification, the 100,000 x g supernatant<br>
solution was used. Expression was confirmed by running samples on SDS-PAGE,<br>
followed by immunoblot analysis utilizing antibodies against CDK5 (anti-CDK5 (268-<br>
283); Calbiochem #219449) and p35 (Santa Cruz #sc820). The CDK5/GST-p25<br>
complex was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography.<br>
Inhibition of CDK5/GST-p25 Kinase Activity<br>
Compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the kinase activity of .<br>
recombinant baculoviral CDK5/GST-p25 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay<br>
(ELISA) with time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) readout. Briefly, each 384-well<br>
FluoroNunc Maxisorp plate (Cat # 460372) plate was coated with 50 µl/well of 50<br>
ug/ml substrate solution (recombinant GST-Rb(773-928)) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS).<br>
The CDK5/GST-p25 assay mixture (total volume = 50 µl/well) consisting of 20 mM<br>
HEPES (pH 7.2), 10 uM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2,5 mM EGTA, 25 mM p-<br>
glycerophosphate, 0.05% BSA, 2.5% DMSO, and various concentrations of test<br>
compound were then added to the assay plate. Enzyme (2 ng/ml CDK5/GST-p25) was<br>
added and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 37°C for 20 minutes. Detection of the<br>
phosphorylated product was performed by adding 50 µl/well of phospho-Rb (Ser-780)<br>
antibody (Cell Signaling # 9307) diluted 1:10,000 in antibody dilution buffer (0.1%<br>
BSA in TBST). After 1-hour incubation at 37°C, 50 µl/well of Eu-Nl labelled anti-<br>
rabbit antibody (Wallac # AD01C5; 1:50,000 in antibody dilution buffer) was added.<br>
Incubation at 37°C then proceeded for 1 hour, followed by addition of 50 µl<br>
enhancement solution (Wallac #1244-105). The plate was gently agitated and after a few<br>
minutes, the fluorescence of the resulting solution was measured using a Multilabel<br>
Reader (Victor2 Model # 1420-018 or Envision Model # 2100). Inhibition data were<br>
analyzed using ActivityBase and IC50 curves were generated using XLFit 3.0.5.<br>
Cloning, Expression and Purification of His6-GSK-3ß<br>
Full-length GSK-30 was amplified from a sequence-verified I.M.A.G.E. EST<br>
acquired from Research Genetics (Invitrogen, Clone ID# CS0DB003YJ02). The final<br>
sequence-verified cDNA contained the coding region for a NH2-terminal tag, which<br>
encoded for 6 histidines and then eight vector-encoded amino acids prior to the start of<br>
GSK3ß, which contained bp # 43-342 of Genbank Accession # NM_002093, encoding<br>
amino acids #2-419. The predicted molecular weight of the tagged, 435 amino acid,<br>
full-length protein is 48.5 kDa. The major structural element of this protein is the kinase<br>
domain, which is from amino acids #56-340. Recombinant baculoviral DNA was<br>
prepared by transposition in E. coli (BAC-TO-BAC system: Invitrogen) and the virus<br>
generated and amplified in Sf21 insect cells. A suspension culture of Sf21 cells was<br>
infected at an MOI of 0.7 and cell density of 1.5 x 106 cells/mL in Excell 420 serum-free<br>
media (JRH BioScience) and harvested 65 h after infection. The 100,000 x g<br>
supernatant solution was used for purification. Expression was confirmed by running<br>
samples on SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis utilizing both a Penta-HIS<br>
antibody (Qiagen #34660) and a GSK-3a/GSK-3ß antibody (Calbiochem #368662, data<br>
not shown). The His6-tagged protei a was purified to in one step by Ni-NTA affinity<br>
chromatography.<br>
Inhibition of His6-GSK-3ß Kinase Activity<br>
Inhibitory effects of compounds on baculoviral GSK-3ß kinase activity were<br>
evaluated using an ELISA-based format in a 384-well FluoroNunc Maxisorp plate (Cat<br>
# 460372) with a time-resolved fluorescence readout. Briefly, each plate was coated with 50 µl/well of 20 µg/ml substrate solution (recombinant GST-Rb) in Tris-buffered<br>
saline (TBS). The GSK-3ß assay mixture (total volume = 50 µl/well) consisting of 50<br>
mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 20 µM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2,5 mM EGTA, 25 mM ß-<br>
glycerophosphate, 0.05% BSA, 2.5% DMSO, and various concentrations of test<br>
compound were then added to the: assay plate. Enzyme (200 ng/ml His6-GSK-3ß) was<br>
then added and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 37°C for 30 minutes. Detection of<br>
the phosphorylated product was performed by adding 50 µl/well of phospho-Rb (Ser-<br>
780) antibody (Cell Signaling # 9307) diluted 1:10,000 in antibody dilution buffer<br>
(0.1% BSA in TBST). After 1-hour incubation at 37°C, 50 µl/well of Eu-Nl labelled<br>
anti-rabbit antibody (Wallac # AD0105; 1:50,000 in antibody dilution buffer) was<br>
added. Incubation at 37°C then proceeded for 1 hour, followed by addition of 50 µl<br>
enhancement solution (Wallac #1244-105). The plate was gently agitated and after a few<br>
minutes, the fluorescence of the resulting solution was measured using a Multilabel<br>
Reader (Victor2 Model # 1420-018 or Envision Model 2100). Inhibition data were<br>
analyzed using ActivityBase and IC50 curves were generated using XLFit 3.0.5.<br>

Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosage Forms<br>
When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of Formula (I) can be<br>
administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can be<br>
administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous,<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal, and can be prepared in a manner well known<br>
in the pharmaceutical art.<br>
This invention also include.1: pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the<br>
active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of Formula (I) above in combination<br>
with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making the compositions of<br>
the invention, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an<br>
excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, for example, a capsule, sachet,<br>
paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-<br>
solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active<br>
ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders,<br>
lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols<br>
(as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to. 10% by<br>
weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile<br>
injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.<br>
In preparing a formulaaon, the active compound can be milled to provide the<br>
appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active<br>
compound is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200<br>
mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be<br>
adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation,<br>
e.g. about 40 mesh.<br>
Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol,<br>
mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin,<br>
calcium silicate, microcrystallme cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water,<br>
syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating<br>
agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying<br>
and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates;<br>
sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be<br>
formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient<br>
after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.<br>
The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage<br>
containing from about 5 to about 100 mg, more usually about 10 to about 30 mg, of the<br>
active ingredient. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units<br>
suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing<br>
a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic<br>
effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
The active compound can be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally<br>
administered in a pharmaceutical ly effective amount. It will be understood, however,<br>
that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a<br>
physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated,<br>
the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight,<br>
and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the<br>
like.<br>
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient<br>
is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition<br>
containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When<br>
referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is<br>
typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be<br>
readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and<br>
capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type<br>
described above containing fiom, for example, 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active<br>
ingredient of the present invention.<br>
The tablets or pills of the present invention can be coated or otherwise<br>
compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For<br>
example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component,<br>
the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be<br>
separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and<br>
permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release.<br>
A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials<br>
including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such<br>
materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which me compounds and compositions of the present<br>
invention can be incorporated foi administration orally or by injection include aqueous<br>
solutions, suitably flavored syrup:!, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions<br>
with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as<br>
elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and<br>
powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are<br>
administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect.<br>
Compositions in can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be<br>
breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to<br>
a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution,<br>
suspension, or powder composition; can be administered orally or nasally from devices<br>
which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>
The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary<br>
depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as<br>
prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the<br>
like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already<br>
suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the<br>
symptoms of the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this<br>
is referred to as "therapeutically effective amount." Effective doses will depend on the<br>
disease condition being treated as well as by the judgement of the attending clinician<br>
depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general<br>
condition of the patient, and the like.<br>
The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical<br>
compositions described above;. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional<br>
sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged<br>
for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile<br>
aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically<br>
will be between 3 and 11, mors preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8.<br>
It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or<br>
stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.<br>
The therapeutic dosage of the compounds of the present invention can vary<br>
according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the<br>
manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and<br>
the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a<br>
compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a<br>
number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and<br>
the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be<br>
provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10%<br>
w/v of the compound for parenteral adminstration. Some typical dose ranges are from<br>
about 1 ug/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose<br>
range is from about 0.01 mg/kg &gt;:o about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage<br>
is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease<br>
or disorder, the overall health status of Ihe particular patient, the relative biological<br>
efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of<br>
administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived<br>
from in vitro or animal model test systems.<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, in<br>
the treatment or prevention of inflammatory diseases, which comprise one or more<br>
containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a compound of Formula (I). Such kits can further include, if desired,<br>
one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, for<br>
example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional<br>
containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either<br>
as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered,<br>
guidelines for administration, and'or guidelines for mixing the components, can also be<br>
included in the kit.<br>
Various modifications of the invention, in addition to those described herein,<br>
will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description. Such<br>
modifications are also intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. Each<br>
reference cited in the present application, including patents, published patent<br>
applications, and journal articles, is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
As those skilled in the art will appreciate, numerous changes and modifications<br>
maybe made to the embodiments of the invention without departing from the spirit of<br>
the invention. It is intended that all such variations fall within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
