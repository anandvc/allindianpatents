Accordingly, the invention proposes a drive system for a sliver-producing textile machine, characterized in that both the sliver-delivering elements and the sliver coiler are driven by motors which have a load-dependent speed characteristic. The drive system comprises, preferably, a motor control unit which is designed so that any motor slip produced during operation remains within predefinable limits. The control unit preferably possesses a controllable power circuit which supplies the said motors. Preferably, the frequency of the electric power supplied by the power circuit is controllable, the power circuit comprising, for example, one or more frequency converters and the said motors then preferably being controllable by means of the supply frequency.<br>
For reasons of cost, three-phase asynchronous motors (squirrel-cage motors) are normally chosen, but the use of other motors capable of being controlled by the supply frequency (e.g. reluctance motors or even synchronous motors) is not precluded. The preferred type of motor is the so-called geared motor. The effective speed of such a motor is affected by both the supply frequency and the transformation or reduction ratio of the gear assigned to the motor. The gear can comprise change points so that the effective speed can be set for a given supply voltage. Preferably, however, the complete system is arranged so that change points are not necessary.<br>
The drive for the sliver coiler can comprise a number of motors, for example a first motor for the sliver feed rollers and the tube gear and a second motor for the revolving disc. Alternatively, there may be only one motor in the sliver coiler (cf DE-C-3734425), in which case the motor power must then be transferred mechanically between the upper and lower parts of the sliver coiler.<br>
The invention is of particular importance in the card, due to the fact that the acceptable tolerances for faulty drafts in the intermediate product of this machine are wider than, for example, in connection with a regulated second passage drawframe. The invention is therefore not intended for use in the autoleveller drawframe.<br>
Present card delivery speeds range from 10 m/min. to 300 m/min. The sliver count normally lies within the range of 3.5 to 6.5 ktex. The drive motors for the sliver-delivering elements of the card (outlet) have rotational speeds of between 150 and 4500 rpm at supply frequencies of between 5 and 150 Hz. A frequency converter power output of between 1.5 and 3 kWatt is required to supply power to both the card outlet and the sliver coiler.<br>
Examples of the invention are now described in greater detail, with reference to the embodiments illustrated in the figures.<br>

Sliver coiler<br>
The invention concerns a sliver-delivering machine and a sliver coiler (can press, can coiler) which is coupled to this machine, the machine being, in particular, a carding machine and possessing a drive for the sliver delivery elements and the sliver coiler possessing its own separate drive.<br>
Such arrangements are known from e.g. EP-A-512683, DE-C-3734425 and WO 92/04266. The advantages of the sliver coiler possessing its own drive (known as an "autonomous sliver coiler") are stated in DE-C-3734425. The drive for the sliver coiler is normally controlled by means of a sensor signal which samples the sliver feed between the card outlet and the sliver coiler. This signal is used to control a feedback control device provided specially for the sliver coiler drive. Other products (e.g. the Triitzschler DK760 card) comprise so-called servo shafts or servo-oxes which are controlled by an integral control device, each shaft being controlled separately. Such servo shafts are described in US-4530134, but without a sliver coiler (can press).<br>
Although the known devices operate perfectly they are expensive, either because they require additional elements or because the elements themselves are expensive, or both.<br>
There is a modem drive system for a textile machine based on frequency conversion - see, for example, "Three-phase motors with frequency converters for textile machines" (Textil Praxis International 1992, January, Page 37, 38), This type of drive for the card is described in e.g. DD-A-224626, a number of (single) converters being used in this case. Surprisingly, it transpires that such drive systems can be extended to include the sliver coiler. This is surprising because the document states that faulty drafts can easily occur in the sliver run between the machine and the sliver coiler and it is assumed that faulty drafts cannot be avoided without special drive system measures.<br>
According to this invention, the drive for the sliver delivering elements of the machine and the drive for the sliver coiler each have one or more frequency-controlled three-phase motors, and there is a common frequency converter or pair of frequency converters for supplying power to these motors, the paired converters being coupled together in order to produce the same output frequency or output frequencies in a preselectable ratio. The three-phase motors are preferably asynchronous motors, i.e., motors which have a slip such that they exhibit a load-dependent speed characteristic at a constant supply frequency. Such a characteristic can be used (in spite of the risk of a faulty draft) because it transpires that the load variations to be anticipated in operation exhibit types of behaviour at the determining points which are so similar that in practice the difference in the relative speed errors (i.e. the speed difference relative to the synchronous speeds) remains within very narrow limits (acceptable tolerances).<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a a sliver coiler, characterized in that the working elements are driven in operation by at least one motor without control loops which is provided in the sliver coiler and is controllable by way of the energising frequency, and that means are provided which allow controlling said motor by a textile machine which is provided upstream of the same.<br>
Examples of the invention are now described in greater detail, with reference to the embodiments illustrated in the figures.<br>
Fig.l shows a schematic side view of a card unit, comprising a material delivery device, the card itself and a sliver coiler coupled to the card.<br>
Fig.2 shows a schematic side view of the working rollers in the card outlet.<br>
Fig.3 shows a schematic view of the sliver-forming elements in the outlet.<br>
Fig.4 shows a schematic isometric representation of the sliver coiler.<br><br><br>

1.      A sliver coiler, characterised in that the woridng elements are driven<br>
m operation by at least one motor (100) without out control loops which is<br>
provided in the sliver coiler (42) and is controllable    by way of the<br>
energising frequency, and that means are provided which allow controlling<br>
said motor (100) by a textile machine which is provided upstream of the<br>
same.<br>
2.	A sliver coiler as claimed in claim 1, wherein the motor is a three*<br>
phase gear motor.<br>
3.	A sliver coiler as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein two such<br>
motors are present; where of the one motor drives the working elements in<br>
the head section (68) and the second motor the working elements  in the base<br>
section (70).<br>
4.	A sliver coiler as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein only one<br>
such motor (100) is provided in the sliver coiler and said motor directly or<br>
indirectly drives all working elements of the sliver coiler.<br>
5.	A sliver coiler, substantially as hereinabove described and illustrated<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
