rTHROMBIN   RECEPTOR-ANTAGONISTS<br>
The present invention relates to substituted tricyclic thrombin receptor antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in the treatment of diseases associated with thrombosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, hypertension, angina pectoris, arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebral ischemia and cancer.<br>
Thrombin is known to have a variety of activities in different cell types and thrombin receptors are known to be present in such cell types as human platelets, vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts.  It is therefore expected that thrombin receptor antagonists will be useful in the treatment of thrombotic, inflammatory, atherosclerotic and fibroproliferative disorders, as well as other disorders in which thrombin and its receptor play a pathological role.<br>
Thrombin receptor antagonists peptides have been identified based on structure-activity studies involving substututions of amino acids on thrombin receptors. In Bernatowicz et al, J. Med. Chem.. 39 (1996), p. 4879-4887, tetra- and pentapeptides are disclosed as being potent thrombin receptor antagonists, for example N-trans-cinnamoyl-p-fluoroPhe-p-guanidinoPhe-Leu-Arg-NH2 and N-trans-cinnamoyl-p-fluoroPhe-p-guanidinoPhe-Leu-Arg-Arg-NH2.   Peptide thrombin receptor anatgonists are also disclosed in WO 94/03479, published February 17, 1994.<br>
  1<br><br>
has been identified as a muscarinic receptor antagonist. The total synthesis of (+)-himbacine is disclosed in Chackalamannil et al, J. Am. Chem Soc, 118 (1996), p. 9812-9813.<br>

W-substituted heteroaryl refers to such groups wherein substitutable ring carbon atoms have a substituent as defined above, or where adjacent carbon atoms form a ring with an alkylene group or a methylenedioxy group.<br>
The term "Het" is exemplified by the single ring, bicyclic and benzofused heteroaryl groups as defined immediately above, as well as tricyclic groups such as benzoquinolinyl (e.g., 1,4 or 7,8) or phenanthrolinyl (e.g., 1,7; 1,10; or 4,7). Het groups are joined to group B by a carbon ring member, e.g., Het is 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl or 2-quinolyi.<br>
Examples of heteroaryl groups wherein adjacent carbon atoms form a ring with an alkylene group are 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine, 2,3-cyclohexenopyridine and 2,3-cycloheptenopyridine.<br>
The term "optional double bond" refers to the bond shown by the single dotted line in the middle ring of the structure shown for formula I. The term "optional single bond" refers to the bond shown by the double dotted line between X and the carbon to which Y and R""^ are attached in the structure of formula I. Compounds wherein the bond is absent are shown, for example, in Example 6.<br>
The above statements, wherein, for example, R"^ and R^ are said to be independently selected from a group of substituents, means that R"^ and R^ are independently selected, but also that where an R"^ or R^ variable occurs more than once in a molecule, those occurrences are independently selected. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the size and nature of the substituent(s) will affect the number of substituents which can be present.<br>
Compounds of the invention have at least one asymmetrical carbon atom and therefore all isomers, including diastereomers and<br><br>
rotational isomers are contemplated as being part of this invention. The invention includes (+)- and (-)-isomers in both pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures.  Isomers can be prepared using conventional techniques, either by reacting optically pure or optically enriched starting materials or by separating isomers of a compound of formula I.<br>
Typical preferred compounds of the present invention wherein Q<br><br>
with compounds having that absolute stereochemistry being more preferred. Typical preferred compounds of the present invention wherein Q is an aromatic ring have the following stereochemistry,<br><br>
with compounds having that absolute stereochemistry being more preferred.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some compounds of formula I, one isomer will show greater pharmacological activity than other isomers.<br>
Compounds of the invention with a basic group can form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with organic and inorganic acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral and carboxylic acids well known to those in the art. The salt is prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt. The free base form may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The free base form differs from its<br><br>
respective salt form somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salt is othenA/ise equivalent to its respective free base forms for purposes of the invention.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention are acidic (e.g., those compounds which possess a carboxyl group). These compounds form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with inorganic and organic bases. Examples of such salts are the sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, lithium, gold and silver salts. Also included are salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, N-methylglucamine and the like.<br>
Compounds of the present invention are generally prepared by processes known in the art, for example by the processes described below.<br>
In Scheme 1, a process is shown for preparing compounds of formula I wherein n is 0, the optional double bond is not present, Q forms a cyclohexyl ring, the single bond is present between X and the carbon to which Y is attached, X is -0-, Y is =0, B is -CH=CH-, Het is W-substitued pyridyl, R2 is methyl, and R"i, R3, R8, R9^ RIO and R"""" are each hydrogen. However, a similar process may be used to prepare compounds comprising other optionally substituted Het groups. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the process is equally applicable to preparing optically active or racemic compounds.<br><br><br><br>
Commercially available (/=?)-3-butyn-2-ol is O-protected as the tetrahydropyranyl ether by treatment with dihydropyran in the presence of catalytic amounts of para-toluenesulfonic acid to give intermediate 1a. Treatment of a solution of 1a in THF with n-BuLi at -78'C followed by quenching with benzylchloroformate and subsequent deprotection gives intermediate 2 which is esterified with dienoic acid 3 using standard conditions to yield the ester 4.  Selective reduction of the triple bond of 4 using Lindlar catalyst under hydrogen gives the intermediate 5, which upon thermal cyclization between 200-210°C followed by base treatment gives the tricyclic intermediate 6. The ester 6 is subjected to hydrogenation in the presence of platinum oxide to generate the intermediate saturated carboxylic acid, treatment of which with SOCI2 gives the corresponding acid chloride which is converted to the tricyclic aldehyde 7 by reduction using tributyltin hydride in the presence of Pd(0).  Condensation of the anion generated from phosphonate 8 with aldehyde 7 in THF gives the alkene 9 (final product).<br>
Intermediates of formula 8 wherein W is aryl or R^^-aryl can be prepared by a process similar to that described immediately below for<br><br><br>
phosphonate by treatment with tert-butyllithlum followed by quenching with diethylchlorophosphonate.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula 9 wherein W is optionally substituted aryl can be prepared from compounds of formula 9 wherein W is -OH using a triflate intermediate. For example, 3-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine is treated with triisopropylsilyl chloride, and the resultant hydroxy-protected compound is converted to the phosphonate as described above for preparing intermediate 8. The triisopropylsilyl-protected intermediate is then reacted with tricyclic intermediate 7 and the protecting group is removed under standard conditions. The resultant compound of formula 9 wherein W is OH is then treated with triflic anhydride at room temperature in a solvent such as CH2CI2; the triflate is then reacted with an optionally substituted arylboronic acid, e.g., optionally substituted phenylboronic acid, in a solvent such as toluene, in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 and a base such a K2CO3 at elevated temperatures and under an inert atmosphere.<br>
Compounds of formula 9 wherein W is a substituted hydroxy group (e.g., benzyloxy) can be prepared from compounds of formula 9 wherein W is hydroxy by refluxing in a suitable solvent such as acetone with a halogen-substituted compound such as optionally substituted benzyl bromide in the presence of a base such as K2CO3.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein Het is substituted by W through a carbon atom (e.g., wherein W is alkyl, alkenyl or arylalkyi) or a nitrogen atom (i.e., -NR^R^) can be prepared using a compound of formula I wherein W is chloroalkyi as an intermediate. Compounds of formula I wherein W is a polar group such as hydroxy alkyl, dihydroxyalkyi, -COOH, dimethylamino and -COH can be prepared as shown in Scheme 1B, wherein the starting material is a compound of formula I wherein W is alkenyl. The following Schemes 1A and 1B show well-known reaction conditions for preparing various W-substituted compounds wherein 0 is cyclohexyl, X is -0-, Y is =0, R'*^ is absent, R"" is methyl, R2, R3, R9, R10 and R^^ are each H, B is -CH=CH-, and Het is 2-pyridyl.<br><br><br><br>

A(pF-F)R(ChA)(hR)(l2-Y)-NH2 (1.03 mg) and 10% Pd/C (5.07 mg) were suspended in DMF (250 |il) and diisopropylethylamine (10 |il). The vessel was attached to the tritium line, frozen in liquid nitrogen and evacuated. Tritium gas (342 mCi) was then added to the flask, which was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. At the completion of the reaction, the excess tritium was removed and the reacted peptide solution was diluted with DMF (0.5 ml) and filtered to remove the catalyst. The collected DMF solution of the crude peptide was diluted with water and freeze dried to remove the labile tritium. The solid peptide was redissolved in water and the freeze drying process repeated. The tritiated peptide ([^HJhaTRAP) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1% aqueous TFA and purified by HPLC using the following conditions: column, Vydac CI8, 25 cm x 9.4 mm I.D.; mobile phase, (A) 0.1% TFA in water, (B) 0.1% TFA in CH3CN; gradient, (A/B) from 100/0 to 40/60 over 30 min; flow rate, 5 ml /min; detection, UV at 215 nm. The radiochemical purity of [3H]haTRAP was 99% as analyzed by HPLC. A batch of 14.9 mCi at a specific activity of 18.4 Ci/mmol was obtained. Preparation of platelet membranes<br>

Peptide Protein Res. 45:145-151 (1995)) from 20 units of platelet concentrates obtained from the North Jersey Blood Center (East Orange, NJ) within 48 hours of collection. All steps were carried out at 4° C under approved biohazard safety conditions. Platelets were centrifuged at 100 x g for 20 minutes at 4° C to remove red cells. The supernatants were decanted and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 15 minutes to pellet platelets. Platelets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCI, 5 mM EDTA, to a total volume of 200 ml and centrifuged at 4400 x g for 10 minutes. This step was repeated two additional times.

Aliquots of membranes were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80° C. Membranes were stable for at least 3 months. 20 units of platelet concentrates typically yielded 250 mg of membrane protein. Protein concentration was determined by a Lowry assay (Lowry et al, J. Biol. Chem.. 193:265-275 (1951)). High Throughput Thrombin Receptor Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
Thrombin receptor antagonists were screened using a modification of the thrombin receptor radioligand binding assay of Ahn et al. (Ahn et al. Mol. Pharmacol.. 51:350-356 (1997)). The assay was performed in 96 well Nunc plates (Cat. No. 269620) at a final assay volume of 200 ^1. Platelet membranes and [3H]haTRAP were diluted to 0.4 mg/ml and 22.2 nM, respectively, in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCIa, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% BSA). Stock solutions (10 mM in 100% DMSO) of test compounds were further diluted in 100% DMSO. Unless otherwise indicated, 10 ^1 of diluted compound solutions and 90 fii of radioligand (a final concentration of 10 nM in 5% DMSO) were added to each well, and the reaction was started by the addition of 100 |il of membranes (40 |ig protein/well). The binding was not significantly inhibited by 5% DMSO. Compounds were tested at three concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 |.iM). The plates were covered and vortex-mixed gently on a Lab-Line Titer Plate Shaker for 1 hour at room temperature. Packard UniFilter GF/C filter plates were soaked for at least 1 hour in 0.1% polyethyleneimine. The incubated membranes were harvested using a Packard FilterMate Universal Harvester and were rapidly washed four times with 300 |il ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA. MicroScint 20 scintillation cocktail (25 |il) was added to each well, and the plates were counted in a Packard TopCount Microplate Scintillation Counter. The specific binding was defined as the total binding minus the nonspecific binding observed in the presence of excess (50 |iM) unlabeled haTRAP. The % inhibition by a compound of [3H]haTRAP binding to thrombin receptors was calculated from the following relationship:<br><br>

Conscious chaired cynomolgus monkeys are allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. A needle catheter is inserted into a brachial vein for infusion of test drugs. Another needle catheter is inserted into the other brachial or saphenous vein and used for blood sampling. In those experiments where the compound is administered orally only one catheter is used. A baseline blood sample (1-2 ml) is collected in vacutainer tubes containing a thrombin inhibitor CVS 2139 (100 |ig/0.1 ml saline) as an anticoaculant. The drug is then infused intravenously over a period of 30 min. Blood samples (1 ml) are collected at 5, 10, 20, 30 min during and 30, 60, 90 min after termination of the drug infusion. In PO experiments the animals are dosed with the drug using a gavage cannula. Blood samples are collected at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360 min after dosing. 0.5 ml of the blood is used for whole blood aggregation and the other 0.5 ml is used for determining the plasma concentration of the drug or its metabolites. Aggregation is performed immediately after collection of the blood sample as described below. Whole Blood Aggregation:<br>
A 0.5 ml blood sample is added to 0.5 ml of saline and warmed to 37^C in a Chronolog whole blood aggregometer. Simultaneously, the impedance electrode is warmed in saline to 37°C. The blood sample with a stir bar is place in the heating block well, the impedance electrode is placed in the blood sample and the collection software is started. The software is allowed to run until the baseline is stabilized and then a 20 Q calibration check is performed. 20 Q. is equal to 4 blocks on the graphic<br><br>

Using the test procedures described above, in the in vitro thrombin receptor antagonist assay, compounds of the invention were found to have IC50 values (i.e., the concentration at which a 50% inhibition of thrombin receptor was observed) in the range of about 4 to 2000 nM, with preferred compounds having IC50 values in the range of about 4 to 100 nM.<br>
In the in vitro Platelet Aggregation Inhibition (PAI) assay, compounds tested were found to have IC50 values in the range of 67 to 1000 nM.  In the ex-vivo C. Monkey Whole Blood PAI, one compound tested showed 100% aggregation at 3 mpk (oral in betahydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin as cosolvent) and another showed 100% aggregation at 10 mpk (i.v. infusion over 30 min. in 5% dextrose).<br><br><br><br><br>
