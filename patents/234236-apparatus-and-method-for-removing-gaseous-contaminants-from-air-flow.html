				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR REMOVING GASEOUS<br>
CONTAMINANTS FROM AIR FLOW<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the operation of systems and devices that<br>
ventilate and otherwise reduce the amount of contamination in the air in spaces.<br>
These spaces may be occupied, or visited, by humans or other things. An<br>
example of such a space is a building occupied by humans. An example of such<br>
a system is an air-conditioning system. An example of such a device is an air-<br>
conditioning unit.<br>
Background<br>
It is usual to limit the amount of contaminant in the air in these spaces by<br>
introducing air from the outside into the spaces so as to lower the concentration<br>
of contaminant in the air in spaces and/or by cleaning air that is recirculated to<br>
and from the spaces by air handling units.<br>
When outside air is introduced into a space it usually causes some contaminated<br>
air from the space to go outside. It is usual to arrange the space and its<br>
ventilating equipment so that contaminated air outflow, to the extent reasonably<br>
practicable, does not contaminate the outside air that is introduced to the space.<br>
The contaminants in the space are usually those generated in the space.<br>
Examples are dusts etc. and gases and odours emitted by organisms, objects<br>
and surfaces in the space, contaminants emitted as a result of the smoking of<br>
tobacco and other substances in the space and contaminants released as a<br>
result of activities taking place in the space.<br>
In some instances contaminants are in the outside air that is introduced into the<br>
space.<br>
These contaminants in air may be particulate matter (e.g. dust) or gaseous<br>
substances (e.g. fully evaporated odourous chemicals).<br>
Generally, particulate matter is removed, fully or in part, by air cleaning and/or<br>
ventilation. Generally, gaseous contamination in spaces is reduced or removed<br>
by ventilation.<br>
Presently cleaning (removing) of particulate matter from air is a well-developed<br>
art and is commonly employed to clean air for delivery into spaces. Including<br>
thos,e normally occupied by humans.<br>
Presently cleaning of gaseous matter from air is not a well-developed art<br>
(not as well developed as cleaning (removing) of particulate matter from air)<br>
and is not commonly employed to clean air for delivery into spaces.<br>
Ventilation often introduces outside air into a space that may be in some<br>
combination be cooled and/or heated and/or humidified and/or dehumidified<br>
and/or otherwise conditioned. The ventilation air is introduced by itself or mixed<br>
with other air. Reduction of ventilation flow is desirable as it reduces the amount<br>
of energy used to maintain a particular value or range of temperature and/or<br>
humidity and/or other conditions in the space.<br>
The rate of ventilation of spaces not occupied by humans will usually be chosen<br>
so as to restrict the amount of contaminant(s) to a particular level or levels. The<br>
level(s) may be set with regard to the propensity of the atmosphere in the space<br>
to be flammable, corrosive, odourous or otherwise inimical to the space, to its<br>
content or to the operation or enjoyment of any organism, process or procedure<br>
that occurs in the space or in a related space.<br>
The rate of ventilation of spaces occupied by humans is usually determined by<br>
two criteria. The first criterion, health and safety, results in the determination of a<br>
certain ventilation rate.<br>
The health and safety criteria based ventilation rate criterion may be further<br>
divided into two sub-criteria.<br>
The first sub-criterion is related to the essentials of respiration and is the<br>
maintenance of minimum oxygen and maximum carbon dioxide levels in the<br>
space. The second sub-criterion is the maintenance of other health and safety<br>
relajed substances to limiting values in the concentration in air.<br>
Usually the health and safety criteria based ventilation rate will be the higher<br>
of the rates determined by the two sub-criteria.<br>
The second criteria is amenity of the occupant(s) of the space. Factors such as<br>
odour, irritation and the like are used in the determination of a usually different<br>
and usually higher ventilation rate.<br>
The ventilation rate used in practice is usually the higher of the rates determined<br>
by either of the two criteria.<br>
Ventilation rates in buildings in Australia, as an example, are usually set in<br>
accordance with Australian Standard AS 1668.2<br>
In the application of the 1991 edition of AS1668.2 (which is referenced in the<br>
edition of the Building Code of Australia that is generally applicable at the<br>
beginning of the year 2001) the required ventilation rate may be reduced if<br>
particulate matter is removed from the air in the space and it may be further<br>
reduced if certain odorous and irritating contaminants are removed from the<br>
space.<br>
Generally the odourous and irritating contamination is gaseous.<br>
The usual means of ventilating and heating or cooling or otherwise conditioning<br>
a space involves heating or cooling or otherwise conditioning a supply air flow,<br>
sending this supply air flow into the space, returning the air flow, or a proportion<br>
thereof, Jo an air handling and/or heating and/or cooling and/or humidification<br>
and/or dehumidification and/or otherwise conditioning apparatus for it to be again<br>
treated for a return supply to the space and so on. Outside air is usually added to<br>
the supply air or return air at some point after the air flow leaves the space and<br>
before the air flow enters the space. To achieve a balance of flows, a flow of air<br>
equal to the ventilation flow leaves the space by action of apparatus or through<br>
openings in the surfaces bounding the space.<br>
In some instances the ventilation air is separately delivered to the space.<br>
The ventilation air flow is usually smaller than the supply or return air flows<br>
here described.<br>
Removal of gaseous contaminants is usually achieved by adsorbent, chemisorbent<br>
or catalytic beds. It is a property of adsorbent, chemisorbent or catalytic beds suited<br>
to removal of a pollutant from an air flow under specific circumstances that there is a<br>
particular thickness of bed, dimension of the bed in the direction of airflow through<br>
the bed, herein termed the Critical Thickness, with certain characteristics.<br>
If the thickness of the bed is greater than the Critical Thickness then the pro-rata<br>
rate of removal of a particular contaminant, typically expressed as efficiency or ratio<br>
of inlet concentration minus outlet concentration all divided by inlet concentration,<br>
remains essentially constant until a certain period of time of operation of the<br>
apparatus has passed or a certain amount of contaminated air has passed into the<br>
bed. After this period of essentially constant efficiency has expired the efficiency of<br>
the bed will reduce as further operation of the apparatus occurs.<br>
It is a particular property of catalytic beds that degradation of performance over time<br>
is usually due to a process in which the utility of the catalyst is degraded by a<br>
process usually termed poisoning and this degradation may proceed at a fast or<br>
slow rate dependent on the concentration of "poison" in the air flow. The "poison" is<br>
not necessarily, and is usually not, the contaminant that is intentionally removed, or<br>
substantially altered, by the catalytic bed. In some circumstances, the degradation is<br>
very slow and the life of the catalytic bed is very long. In some circumstances where<br>
the rate of poisoning of a catalytic bed is adequately slow a catalytic bed may<br>
behave as a thick bed of low predictable efficiency.<br>
Typically in the operation of beds that are thicker than the Critical Thickness during<br>
the substantially constant efficiency part of their operating cycle the efficiency of<br>
these beds will be approximately 100% or a value close to this which differs, or<br>
appears to differ, from approximately 100% as a result of test procedure<br>
inaccuracies or of detail apparatus design or construction imperfections.<br>
A thin bed, thickness equal to or less than Critical Thickness, operates such that the<br>
efficiency of the bed, which initially is 100% or less than 100%, will reduce as<br>
operation of the apparatus occurs. This is a particular disadvantage of thin bed<br>
adsorptive chemisorptive, catalytic or combination thereof gas phase air cleaning<br>
devices.<br>
Additionally, with a thin bed if the constitution of the contamination in the incoming<br>
air flow varies within an anticipated range the operation of the device produces a<br>
concentration of contamination in the treated air that varies and which may be<br>
effectively unpredictable. This is a particular disadvantage of thin bed adsorptive,<br>
chemisorptive, catalytic or combination thereof gas phase air cleaning devices<br>
The particular advantage of thin bed adsorptive, chemisorptive, catalytic or<br>
combination thereof gas phase cleaning devices is that the pressure drop<br>
experienced by the air flow as it passes through the device bed is sufficiently low as<br>
to cause only an acceptable use of fan energy to propel the air flow through the bed.<br>
Present devices for the removal of gaseous matter from air flows at heating/ cooling/<br>
ventilation/ dehumidification/ humidification/ other conditioning apparatus, such as<br>
ducted air-conditioning apparatus, pass the return, and/or supply and/or ventilation<br>
air flow(s) through the device. These devices may be air washers, absorption<br>
process, or thin bed, a bed with a depth less than the Critical Thickness, adsorptive,<br>
chemisorptive, catalytic or combination thereof gas phase cleaning devices.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a means and a method for<br>
removing gaseous contaminants from the air flowing through an apparatus that<br>
uses thick bed cleaning to remove contaminants and retains the advantages of<br>
thin bed cleaning whilst overcoming, or at least ameliorating, the disadvantages of<br>
thick bed cleaning.<br>
Accordingly in one aspect, the present invention is an apparatus for removing<br>
gaseous contaminants from an air flow including a means to divide the air flow into<br>
a first air flow and at least one other air flow, a cleaning device for cleaning the first<br>
air flow and a means to combine the cleaned first air flow and all other air flows to<br>
form an outlet air flow. The first air flow is small when compared sum of the first<br>
air flow and each other air flow. The gas phase cleaning device passes the entire<br>
first air flow through a cleaning bed having a thickness of greater than the Critical<br>
Thickness for the contaminant of concern.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is a method for removing gaseous<br>
contaminants from an air flow including dividing the air flow into a first air flow and<br>
at least one other air flow, cleaning the first air flow by passing the first air flow<br>
through a gas phase cleaning device and combining the cleaned first air flow and<br>
all other air flows to form an outlet air flow. The gas phase cleaning device passes<br>
the entire first air flow through a cleaning bed having a thickness of greater than<br>
the Critical Thickness for the contaminant of concern. The first air flow is small<br>
when compared to the compared to the sum of the first air flow and each other air<br>
flow.<br>
Whilst the pressure drop through the bed is substantial there is an acceptable use of<br>
fan energy to propel the air flow as only a proportion of the air flow is passed through<br>
the bed. Energy use is essentially proportional to the product of airflow rate and<br>
pressure drop.<br>
More preferably the gas phase cleaning device will include a thick adsorbent,<br>
chemisorptive, catalytic (including photo catalytic) or combination thereof bed with<br>
one or more particulate arresting filters before and after the bed. The particulate<br>
arresting filter upstream of the bed is used to remove all or some of the matter that<br>
may adversely affect operation of the bed. The particulate arresting filter down<br>
stream of the bed is used to remove all or some of matter released from the bed.<br>
Preferably the gas phase cleaning device includes a fan with sufficient motive power<br>
to propel the chosen amount or proportion of contaminated air through the bed and<br>
any particulate arresting filters. The fan will typically have sufficient additional motive<br>
power to move the chosen portion of contaminated air against sufficient airflow<br>
resistance so that the device will operate satisfactorily in the circumstances of its<br>
application.<br>
Preferably the constant proportion of contaminant removed will be at least 98%.<br>
Preferably the air flow is divided into a first and second fir flow.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides an air cleaning system<br>
incorporating the at least one air cleaning apparatus.<br>
Some of the embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of<br>
example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
• Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of the air cleaning apparatus according to<br>
one embodiment of the invention.<br>
• Figure 2 is a schematic illustration of a system incorporating an air cleaning<br>
apparatus according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
• Figure 3 is a schematic illustration of a system incorporating an air cleaning<br>
 apparatus according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
• Figure 4 is a schematic illustration of a system incorporating an air cleaning<br>
appatratus according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
• Figure 5 is a schematic illustration of a system incorporating an air cleaning<br>
apparatus according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
Referring to figure 1, there is shown an apparatus 1 for removing gaseous<br>
contaminants from an air flow. The intake air flow 2 is divided into two air flows<br>
3,4, the first of which is small when compared to the intake air flow 2. The first air<br>
flow 3 is cleaned using in a cleaning unit 5 which includes a contaminant removal<br>
section 6. The contaminant removal section includes a bed 8 which has a<br>
thickness at least as thick as the critical thickness for a particular application. In<br>
the embodiment shown the bed has a filter 7 before the bed to remove particulate<br>
matter from the air flow and a filter 9 after the bed to remove particulate matter<br>
released from the bed. The air flow may pass through the contaminant removal<br>
section with the assistance of a fan 10. The air flow 11 exiting the contaminant<br>
removal section 6 is then fed back into the second air flow 4 to form a cleaner air<br>
flow 12 than the intake air flow.<br>
In respect of figures 2 to 5 show systems in which an air cleaning apparatus is used.<br>
It will be observed that, depending on the location and characteristics of fans<br>
located in the air-handling unit or in the associated ductwork and the location of the<br>
thick bed gas phase air cleaning device, the fan within the gas phase air cleaning<br>
device may be required to operate against a negligible external air flow resistance or<br>
it may be required to operate against an external airflow resistance.<br>
Referring to figures 2 to 5, a space 31 constituting a volume to be ventilated has<br>
an air inlet 32 and an air outlet 33. A heating/cooling/air-conditioning apparatus 34<br>
sends air to the space via duct 35. Air leaves the space via duct 36 and some of<br>
this air is discharged to atmosphere at air discharge 37 and some of this air is sent<br>
along duct 38 until this air flow is divided into two air flows. The second air flow is<br>
sent to the air-conditioner via ducts 39 and 40 and the first air flow of the air in duct<br>
38 is sent via duct 42 to the thick bed gas phase air cleaner 41 in which it is<br>
cleaned and then it is sent to the air-conditioner via ducts 43 and 40. Outside air<br>
enters at outdoor air inlet 44 and then is conveyed to the air-conditioner via ducts<br>
45 and 40. Air which enters the thick bed gas phase air cleaner 41 is caused to<br>
pass through the thick bed 46 by fan 47; alternatively other fans and duct<br>
resistances in the system of ductwork etc may cause the desired air movement<br>
without use of fan 47 or with assistance from fan 47.<br>
By means of this arrangement air-conditioner 34 is supplied with cleaned air from<br>
the thick bed gas phase air cleaner 41, outdoor air from outdoor air inlet 44 and air<br>
from space 31. The ventilation needs of the space are met by the combination of<br>
air flows from the thick bed gas phase air cleaner 41, and outdoor air inlet 44 with<br>
consequent reduction in the flow of air otherwise required from outdoor air inlet 44.<br>
Referring to figure 3 shows a similar system to figure 2 with an additional thick bed<br>
gas phase air cleaner 50 which bypasses the air-conditioning unit and at least one<br>
thick bed gas phase air cleaner included with the air-conditioning unit 51.<br>
Referring to figure 4 a similar system to figure 3 is shown with additional thick bed<br>
gas phase air cleaners 60 situated at various points around the system and<br>
additional ventilation ducts 61.<br>
Referring to figure 5 a similar system to figure 4 is shown that is used to remove<br>
contaminants from multiple spaces 31 and additional exit ducts 70.<br>
One example of a system including an apparatus according to one embodiment of<br>
the invention is:<br>
• a gas phase air cleaning apparatus of adsorptive, chemisorptive or catalytic (or<br>
combination thereof) nature is used to clean part of the air flow taken from or<br>
sent to a space.<br>
• the nature of the adsorptive, chemisorptive or catalytic (or combination thereof)<br>
air cleaning device is such that the rate of removal of a particular contaminant or<br>
contaminants expressed as efficiency (defined as the ratio of inlet concentration<br>
minus outlet concentration all divided by inlet concentration) remains essentially<br>
constant until a certain period of time of operation of the apparatus has passed<br>
or a certain amount of contaminated air has passed into the bed.<br>
• the gas phase air cleaning device is used such that the rate of removal of a<br>
particular contaminant or contaminants expressed as efficiency (defined as<br>
the ratio of inlet concentration minus outlet concentration all divided by inlet<br>
concentration) remains essentially constant.<br>
• the predictable efficiency of cleaning of the part of the air flow passing through<br>
the gas phase air cleaning device combined with the predictable proportion of<br>
the air flow that is passing through the gas phase air cleaning device is equivalent<br>
in effect to a predictable equivalent efficiency of gas phase air cleaning of the<br>
entire air flow.<br>
• the predictable equivalent efficiency of gas phase air cleaning of the entire air flow<br>
permits a reduction of ventilation of the space with consequent energy and<br>
capital savings<br>
• the predictable equivalent efficiency of gas phase air cleaning of the entire air flow<br>
permits an increase in the predictable quality of the air in the space without the<br>
use of energy that would have been used to achieve a similar result by means of<br>
increased ventilation.<br>
In another form of the arrangement<br>
• a gas phase air cleaning device of adsorptive, chemisorptive or catalytic (or<br>
combination thereof) nature is used to clean part of the air flow taken from<br>
outside and used to ventilate spaces.<br>
• the nature of the adsorptive, chemisorptive or catalytic (or combination thereof)<br>
air cleaning device is such that the rate of removal of a particular contaminant or<br>
contaminants expressed as efficiency (defined as the ratio of inlet concentration<br>
minus outlet concentration all divided by inlet concentration) remains essentially<br>
constant until a certain period of time of operation of the apparatus has passed or<br>
a certain amount of contaminated outside air has passed into the bed.<br>
• the predictable efficiency of cleaning of the part of the air flow passing through<br>
the gas phase air cleaning device combined with the predictable proportion of<br>
the air flow that is passing through the gas phase air cleaning device is equivalent<br>
in effect to a predictable equivalent efficiency of gas phase air cleaning of the<br>
entire air flow.<br>
• the predictable equivalent efficiency of gas phase air cleaning of the entire air<br>
flow permits an increase in the predictable quality of the air in the space superior<br>
to that which would otherwise be obtained with a chosen ventilation rate<br>
AN EXAMPLE OF USE OF PEEP BED GAS PHASE AIR<br>
CLEANING DEVICE - WITH CONCLUSIONS<br>
A new air-conditioned office building is to be constructed and the following applies<br>
• The building is to be occupied by 1,000 people during working hours in a<br>
space of 10 sq. m. floor area per person<br>
• Building regulations require that, for odour control the minimum ventilation<br>
rate is 7.5 litres per second (l/s) per person ie 7,500 l/s total<br>
• The owner of the facility requires that the odour levels in the building be<br>
equivalent, or better, to that which would be obtained if the building were<br>
ventilated at the rate of 15 l/s/person<br>
• Building regulations allow that the ventilation rate may be reduced to the<br>
greater of 2.5 l/s/person or 0.35 l/s/sq.m. of floor area when air cleaning that<br>
is in place removes odours from the air to the extent that the odour level is<br>
equivalent to that which it would be if the ventilation rate were 7.5 l/s/sq.m.<br>
• The amount of air required to be delivered to the air-conditioned space is<br>
 60,000 l/s and this required air delivery rate is set by the need for a<br>
particular heating or cooling effect in conjunction with certain other<br>
parameters chosen by the designers of the air-conditioning system.<br>
• Cooling effect (of air-conditioning) is obtained by electrically driven<br>
refrigeration plant and the cost of electricity is, at any time, $0.12 per kWH<br>
• Heating effect (of air-conditioning) is obtained by from a natural gas or<br>
similar fuel source and this is supplied to the building at a cost (per unit of<br>
energy supplied to the building), at any time, of $0.05 per kWH<br>
• The marginal capital cost of air-conditioning capacity (including heating and<br>
cooling effect delivered, at the time of construction) is $2000 per kW of<br>
marginal refrigeration capacity installed<br>
• The outdoor air temperatures are described as<br>
o winter heating season: 7,500 "degree hours", with outdoor air<br>
minimum design temperature 10C below design room temperature<br>
o summer cooling season: 10,000 degree hours (temperature<br>
equivalent, including cooling and dehumidification requirement) with<br>
outdoor air maximum design temperature 10C above design room<br>
temperature<br>
We note that this is a plausible scenario for a reasonably practicable design of an<br>
air-conditioning system of a building where the minimum ventilation requirements<br>
are set by the 1991 edition of Australian Standard 1668.2 in circumstances where<br>
the use of particulate (ie not gas phase filters) is arranged such that maximum<br>
advantage is obtained by their use in accordance with AS1668.2: 1991<br>
Say the real ventilation rate is reduced from 15 to 3.5 litres per second per person<br>
(or 10 sq m) by use of gas phase air filters<br>
Capital Cost Savings Calculation<br>
• Ventilation Reduction = (15-3.5) * 1,000 = 11,500 l/s<br>
• Associated Peak cooling load is: 11,500l/s * 10C * 1.2 (specific heat) or<br>
 138,000 watts or 138 kW<br>
• Associated marginal capital cost = 138 kW * $2,000/kW = $276,000<br>
Annual Heating Cost Savings Calculation<br>
• Annual heating savings = 11,500 l/s * 7,500 deg hr * 1.2 = 86,250,000 WH<br>
= 86,250 kWH<br>
• Using a plant efficiency of 80% the required input of energy to the plant is<br>
• 86,250/0.8 =107,812.5 kWH @ $0.05/kWH = $5,391/annum<br>
Annual Cooling Cost Savings Calculation<br>
• Annual cooling savings = 11500 l/s * 10,000 deg hr * 1.2 = 115,000,000<br>
WH=115,000kWH<br>
• Using a plant average Refrigeration Coefficient of Performance of 3.5 the<br>
required input of energy to the plant is 115,000/3.5 = 32,857 kWh @<br>
$0.12/kWH = $3,943 pa<br>
Annual Energy Cost Savings Calculation<br>
Thus total energy cost savings are $3,943 + $5,391 = $9,334/ annum<br>
Summary<br>
Capital savings are $276,000 and annual savings are $9,943<br>
A deep bed gas phase filter is available for use and it has these characteristics<br>
• Its efficiency, in accordance with AS 1668.2:1991, for removal of relevant<br>
odours and irritants, is not less than 98% (i.e. 0.98) during its estimated 3<br>
year lifetime<br>
• Its resistance to airflow through it is substantially constant and not greater<br>
than 500 Pascals<br>
• The filter is available in easily assembled 1000 l/s (airflow capacity)<br>
modules at an installed cost of $1,500 each. And the cost of air cleaning<br>
material in each module (including installation etc) is $1,500<br>
• Modules may be refilled with new air cleaning material<br>
Capital costs<br>
Potential savings (above) = $276,000<br>
Module Costs 12*1500 = $18,000<br>
Net capital savings = $258,000<br>
Running costs<br>
Required airflow through gas phase unit = 1,000 persons * (15-3.5) l/s / 0.98<br>
= 11,735 l/s<br>
Saved heating/cooling = $9,334<br>
Annual air cleaning material costs= $6,000 (12 module refills @ $1,500 / 3 years)<br>
Fan energy costs = 500 (Pa) * 11.735 (m3/sec) /<br>
0.70 (fan efficiency) * 2,500<br>
(hours/year) @ $0.12(/kWH)<br>
= $2,515<br>
TOTAL (net) saving = $819, say $800<br>
Conclusions:<br>
• an upfront saving of $ 258,000 results in an annual saving of $800<br>
when a reasonably pessimistic analysis is undertaken.<br>
• probably, in average circumstances of application in moderate climate<br>
areas there would be a net operating cost saving<br>
• in weather conditions less moderate than those used in the example<br>
greater capital and operating savings would be obtained<br>
• significant capital savings seem likely in most circumstances of<br>
application<br>
In other forms of the arrangement any number and/or combination of spaces is<br>
served by any number and/or combination of air handling and/or air conditioning,<br>
and/or ventilation systems and/or devices.<br>
Many other permutations and combinations of air handling units, conditioned<br>
