				<td>Introduction to the Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a method for the production of high strength (YS: 430 MPa min.), weldable plates with superior low temperature impact toughness (200 J min. at -20° C) and the plates so produced.<br>
Prior Art and Drawbacks:<br>
It is already known to produce weldable plates of high strength in conventional rolling mills.<br>
The major limitations with the plate mills are lower load bearing capacity (-3000 T) and absence of accelerated cooling facility.<br>
With these limitations, it is very difficult and is not possible to produce high strength weldable plates with superior low temperature impact toughness using a low C steel without addition of alloy elements (Cu, Ni, Mo, Cr).<br>
Moreover, in the known art, we found a number of Patents, which deal with controlled rolling of plates and hot strips using low alloy (containing Cu and Ni) low C steel micro-alloyed with Nb, V and Ti, resulting in products with excellent strength and impact toughness combination. Various types of techniques/technologies involving control of the cooling rate (between 800° C to 600° C and 600° C to 400° C), accelerated cooling at rates of 25° C/S, two stages controlled rolling has been employed.<br>
o	None of the Patents provides a strength guarantee of 430 MPa min. and a concurrent impact<br>
toughness guarantee of 200 J min. at -20° C.<br>
o	No accelerated cooling or controlled cooling has been resorted to get the desired strength<br>
toughness combination.<br>
o	The present proposal imposes a limit on the inclusion level, which none of the other Patent<br>
does. And we propose to avoid alloying elements like Cu, Ni and Cr.<br>
o	The deformation schedule used is different from others.<br><br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to produce high strength low temperature impact toughness steel plates in the existing plate mills so that cost can be minimized.<br>
It is another object to propose an improved method of rolling of steel plates in an existing-platemill without overloading the mill.<br>
It is yet another object of this invention to adopt a two stage rolling, the first one at a higher temperature " than the second stage.<br>
It is a further object to use a specially designed chemistry of steel for the rolling purposes.<br>
It is a still further object to propose an improved method of rolling plates in a plate milt by which it is possible to achieve API X-60 grade properties in plates up to 20mm plate thickness without overloading the mill.<br>
Yet another object is to propose such a method whereby the plates produced will exhibit excellent low temperature impact toughness properties in excess of 200 J at -20 °C.<br>
These and other objects of the invention will be apparent from the following paragraphs. Brief Statement of the Invention:<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided an improved method for the production of high strength weldable steel plates with superior low temperature impact toughness comprising subjecting a steel slab having the following chemical composition(wt %),<br>
C	Mn	S	P	Al	Nb	V<br>

0.10	1.3	0.04         0.05	0.06<br>
to a two stage rolling with an intermediate delay or cooling stage, the first stage being a high temperature rolling stage carried out at temperatures in thje region of 1200 °C to 1050°C,<br>
3<br><br>
the delay or cooling stage being provided to cool the rolled and deformed plate of the first stage to a temperature of around 950° C and<br>
the second low temperature rolling stage being carried out at temperatures in the region of 950° C to 800° C.<br>
In this method, the preferred chemical composition of the slab used was as follows:<br>
C: 0.08, Mn: 1.2, Si: 0.24, Al: 0.036, S: 0.005, P: 0.02, Nb: 0.03, V: 0.04 and before subjecting to the high temperature rolling, the slabs were austenitised at 1250±10°C to ensure complete solid solution of Nb-V precipitates.<br>
The high temperature rolling (deformation) was carried out in the y-re-crystallization zone where the austenite was subjected to repeat re-crystallization and the total deformation in the first stage was about 80%, reducing the plate thickness from about 210 mm to 40 mm.<br>
In this case, the degree of deformation per pass ranged from 10% to 22% increasing with decreasing temperature of deformation.<br>
In this method, there was introduced an intermediate delay or cooling stage, after the first rolling stage, wherein, the deformed slabs of the first stage were oscillated in the run-out table to bring down the temperature frwiffiOSO0 C to&amp;£50° C.<br><br>
After the delay or cooling stage, in the second stage, the rolled slabs of the first stage were subjected to a cumulative deformation of about 70%.<br>
The rolled slabs from the first stage were deformed, from about 40 mm to the final thickness (about 12 mm), in the second stage in the y-non re-crystallization zone.<br>
The finish rolling temperature was maintained in the range of 790° C to 830° C and the deformation in the last pass is 15% min.<br>
It was noticed that the mechanical properties of the 12 mm thick rolled plates conrormea to API X-60 Specification (YS: 430 MPa min. TS: 520 MPa, min, El. 30% min.) and even was found to be slightly better.<br>
4<br><br>
The mechanical properties of the 12 mm thick plates obtained were more or less as follows: YS: 440-500 MPa, TS: 520-560 MPa, El.: 32-38% and thus, the final plate showed excellent impact toughness in excess of 300 J at -20° C.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention: Example No. 1:<br>
For experimental purposes, we preferred a low C steel micro-alloyed with Nb and V.<br>
In this example, the preferred chemical composition of the steel used was as follows:<br>
C: 0.08, Win: 1.2, Si: 0.24, Al: 0.036, S: 0.005, P: 0.02, Nb: 0.03, V: 0.04<br>
The above amounts are in percentages and based on the weight percent of the steel plate.<br>
The slabs having of the above specially micro-alloyed composition were austenitised at 1250±10°C to ensure complete solid solution of Nb-V precipitates. The slabs were then subjected to a two stage controlled rolling.<br>
First Stage Rolling:<br>
High temperature rolling at 1200°C to 1050°C:<br>
This high temperature rolling ensures deformation in the y-re-crystallization zone where the austenite is subjected to repeated re-crystallization. The total deformation in this zone was around 80% (The thickness of the plate was reduced from about 210 mm to about 40 mm), the degree of deformation per pass ranged from 10% to 22%, increasing with decreasing temperature of deformation.<br>
An Intermediary Stage:<br>
The stage called "a delay stage" was introduced before proceeding to the second stage low temperature rolling.<br>
In this stage, the deformed slabs of the first stage were oscillated in the run table to bring down the temperature froM 10500C to950°C.<br><br>
5<br><br>
Once the temperature of the slabs deformed in the first stage reached a temperature of about 950° C, they were subjected to a second stage rolling which was a low temperature rolling carried out at a temperature in the range of 950° C to 800° C.<br>
The Second Stage Low Temperature Rolling at 950° C to 800° C:<br>
Here, the rolled slabs of the first stage were subjected to a cumulative deformation of about 70% (The thickness of the slab was reduced from about 40 mm to 12 mm) in the y-non re-crystallization zone. The finish rolling temperature was maintained in the range of 790° C-850°C. The deformation in the last pass was 15% min.<br>
Verification of the Properties of the End Product:<br>
The micro-structure of the steel plates, after the second stage, revealed a ferrite-pearlite structure. The ferrite grain size varied from surface to centre within a narrow band, being slightly coarser at the centre (6.8-7.2 um) as compared to the surface (5-6 urn). The pearlite volume fraction was found similar for all the plates samples, irrespective of FRT, varying between<br>
12-15%.<br>
The mechanical properties of the 12 mm thick plates conformed to the standard API X-60 Specification (YS: 430 MPa min, TS: 520 MPa, El. 30% min.) and even was slightly better. The typical range of mechanical properties obtained were as follows:<br>
YS: 440-500 MPa, TS: 520-560 MPa, El.: 32-38%. Confirmation of the Advantages Obtained:<br>
Impact tests were carried out on standard charpy samples of 10 x 10 x 55 mm at RT to -60° C. Ail the plates showed excellent impact toughness properties in excess of 300 J at -20° C. The impact energy values obtained at different temperature are given below:<br><br>
