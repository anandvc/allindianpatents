PROTECTIVE NEEDLE KNIFE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] Tha present invention relates to methods and devices for penetrating tissue, and in<br>
particular to a needle knife having a safety feature.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Laparoscopic surgery is one type of minimally invasive surgery in which a surgeon uses<br>
numerous trocar ports to access and visualize the tissue site of interest within the abdominal<br>
cavity of a fully anesthetized patient. The benefits of laparoscopic surgery, as compared to open<br>
incisional, abdominal surgery, include less pain, shorter recovery time, less scarring, and lower<br>
cost. Another way to access the abdominal cavity, however, is via natural openings (mouth,<br>
anus, vagina, urethra) of the body and through the peritoneal lining of the abdominal cavity.<br>
Obviously, the size and shape of instruments that may be passed through a body lumen in order<br>
to perform a medical procedure in the abdominal cavity are greatly restricted due to the<br>
anatomical properties of the lumen.<br>
[0003] General surgeons, gastroenterologists, and other medical specialists routinely use flexible<br>
endoscopes for intraluminal (within the lumen of the alimentary canal) examination and<br>
treatment of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, via the mouth, and the lower GI tract, via the<br>
anus. In these procedures, the physician pushes the flexible endoscope into the lumen,<br>
periodically pausing to articulate the distal end of the endoscope using external control knobs, to<br>
redirect the distal tip of the endoscope. In this way, the physician may navigate the crooked<br>
passageway of the upper GI past the pharynx, through the esophagus and gastro esophageal<br>
junction, and into the stomach. The physician must take great care not to injure the delicate<br>
mucosal lining of the lumen, which generally may stretch open to a diameter in the range of<br>
about 15-25 mm, but normally has a non-circular cross sectional configuration when relaxed.<br>
[0004] During such translumenal procedures, a puncture must be formed in the stomach wall or<br>
in the gastrointestinal tract to access the peritoneal cavity. One device often used to form such a<br>
puncture is a needle knife which is inserted through the working channel of the endoscope, and<br>
which utilizes energy to penetrate through the tissue. A guidewire is then feed through the<br>
endoscope and is passed through the puncture in the stomach wall and into the peritoneal cavity.<br>
- 1-<br><br>
Ally. Docket No.: 100873-92 (END 5836)<br>
The needle knife is removed, leaving the guidewire as a placeholder. A balloon catheter is then<br>
passed over the guidewire and through the working channel of the endoscope to position the<br>
balloon within the opening in the stomach wall. The balloon can then be inflated to increase the<br>
size of the opening, thereby enabling the endoscope to push against the rear of the balloon and to<br>
be feed through the opening and into the peritoneal cavity. Once the endoscope is positioned<br>
within the peritoneal cavity, numerous procedures can be performed through the working<br>
channel of the endoscope.<br>
[0005] While the current methods and devices used to penetrate tissue are effective, one<br>
drawback is the risk of damaging adjacent organs and tissue. Due to the low amount of energy<br>
and force of penetration needed to pass through tissue, there is the risk of penetrating adjacent<br>
tissue that is intended to be left unharmed during the procedure. Accordingly, there remains a<br>
need for improved tissue penetrating devices that include a safety feature to protect adjacent<br>
tissue. There also remains a need for a simplified procedure that requires less steps to form a<br>
puncture in tissue.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] The present invention provides devices and methods for endoscopically or<br>
laparoscopically penetrating tissue. In one exemplary embodiment, a tissue-penetrating device is<br>
provided and includes a flexible elongate shaft and a flexible elongate wire extending through<br>
the elongate shaft and having a needle tip at a distal end thereof for penetrating tissue. The<br>
needle tip can be conductive and the elongate wire can be adapted to couple to an energy source<br>
for delivering energy to the needle tip to facilitate penetration of the needle tip through tissue<br>
The device can also include a protective sheath disposed over at least a portion of the elongate<br>
shaft and movable relative to the elongate shaft between a distal position and a proximal<br>
position. The protective sheath is configured to protect the needle tip or electrically isolate the<br>
needle tip after the needle tip is inserted through tissue, thereby preventing unintentional<br>
penetration of adjacent tissue.<br>
[0007] In one exemplary embodiment, the needle tip can be separable from the elongate wire<br>
and it can be attached to the protective sheath. The needle tip can be spaced apart from a distal<br>
end of the elongate wire when the protective sheath is in the distal position, and the protective<br>
sheath can move the needle tip into contact with the elongate wire when the protective sheath<br>
-2-<br><br>
Atty. Docket No.: 100873-92 (END 5836)<br>
moves to the proximal position to allow energy to be delivered from the elongate wire to the<br>
needle tip. In an exemplary embodiment, the protective sheath is adapted to move from the<br>
distal position to the proximal position when the protective sheath is advanced into a tissue<br>
surface. The device can further include a biasing element disposed between the protective sheath<br>
and the elongate shaft for biasing the protective sheath to the distal position. The biasing<br>
element can be disposed within the protective sheath and around a portion of the elongate shaft.<br>
The elongate shaft can include an abutment configured to receive a force applied to the biasing<br>
element by movement of the protective sheath.<br>
[0008] In another exemplary embodiment, the needle tip can be formed on the distal end of the<br>
elongate wire, and it can be positioned proximal to a distal-most end of the protective sheath<br>
when the sheath is in the distal position, and it can be exposed and extend from the protective<br>
sheath when the protective sheath is in the proximal position. The protective sheath can be<br>
adapted to move from the distal position to the proximal position when the protective sheath is<br>
advanced into a tissue surface. A biasing element can be disposed between the protective sheath<br>
and the elongate shaft for biasing the protective sheath to the distal position, and it can be<br>
disposed within the protective sheath and around a portion of the elongate shaft. The elongate<br>
shaft can include an abutment configured to receive a force applied to the biasing element by<br>
movement of the protective sheath.<br>
[0009] In another embodiment, the device can include an expandable member disposed around a<br>
portion of the elongate shaft and adapted to expand radially relative to the elongate shaft. In one<br>
embodiment, the expandable member can be an expandable balloon. The device can also include<br>
various other features. For example, the needle tip can be configured to form a puncture hole in<br>
tissue that has an extent that is substantially equal to a diameter of the protective sheath to allow<br>
the protective sheath to pass through the puncture hole.<br>
[0010] Also disclosed herein are methods for penetrating tissue. In one embodiment, the method<br>
can include inserting a flexible elongate shaft through a body lumen, e.g., translumenally, and<br>
positioning a distal tip of the elongate shaft adjacent to a tissue surface to be penetrated. Force<br>
can be applied to the elongate shaft to cause a protective sheath disposed around a distal end of<br>
the elongate shaft to move proximally to allow a needle tip extending from a distal end of the<br>
protective sheath to penetrate through the tissue. Energy can be delivered to the needle tip<br>
-3-<br><br>
Atty. Docket No.: 100873-92 (END 5836)<br>
through an elongate wire disposed in the elongate shaft. In one embodiment, the needle tip can<br>
be mated to the protective sheath and it can be electrically isolated from the elongate wire when<br>
the protective sheath is in a distal position, and movement of the protective sheath proximally<br>
can be effective to position the needle tip in contact with the elongate wire.<br>
[0011] In another embodiment, the needle tip can be positioned proximal to a distal-most end of<br>
the protective sheath when the protective sheath is in a distal position, and movement of the<br>
protective sheath proximally can be effective to expose the needle tip to allow the needle tip to<br>
penetrate through tissue. The protective sheath can return to the distal position once the needle<br>
tip penetrates through the tissue.<br>
[0012] In a further embodiment, an expandable member disposed on the elongate shaft can be<br>
expanded to increase a size of a puncture hole formed by the needle tip after the needle tip<br>
penetrates through the tissue. The expandable member can be inflated with air or fluid. In<br>
another embodiment, the needle tip can be removed by pulling on an elongate wire coupled to<br>
the needle tip, and a guidewire can be inserted through the flexible elongate shaft to position the<br>
guidewire through the puncture formed in the tissue by the needle tip. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the needle tip can form a puncture hole in the tissue having an extent that is<br>
substantially equal to a maximum diameter of the protective sheath to facilitate insertion of the<br>
protective sheath through the puncture hole formed in the tissue.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0021] Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall<br>
understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the devices<br>
and methods disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings. Those skilled in the art will understand that the devices and methods<br>
specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting<br>
exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the present invention is defined solely by the<br>
claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one exemplary embodiment may<br>
be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such modifications and variations are<br>
intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0022] Various exemplary methods and devices are provided for penetrating tissue. In<br>
particular, a device is provided having a flexible elongate wire extending through an elongate<br>
shaft and having a needle tip at a distal end thereof for penetrating tissue. The device can also<br>
include a protective sheath disposed over at least a portion of the elongate shaft and configured<br>
to allow the needle tip to penetrate tissue only when the protective sheath is advanced into the<br>
tissue to be penetrated. While the device can be used in a variety of applications, it is preferably<br>
used in endoscopic or laparoscopic surgery. For example, the device can be inserted<br>
translumenally, and then penetrated through a tissue surface, such as the stomach, to form a<br>
puncture hole in the tissue to provide access to other areas of the body, such as the abdominal<br>
cavity. The protective sheath is particularly advantageous as it allows the device to penetrate<br>
through tissue, while preventing puncture or injury to adjacent tissue, such as organs disposed<br>
within the stomach cavity.<br>
[0023] FIG. 1A illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a device for penetrating tissue. As<br>
-5-<br><br>
Atty. Docket No.: 100873-92 (END 5836)<br>
shown, the device 10 generally includes a handle 12 with a flexible elongate shaft 14 extending<br>
therefrom and configured to be introduced translumenally. The elongate shaft 14 includes a<br>
flexible elongate wire 16 extending from the handle 12 through a hollow channel (not shown) in<br>
the shaft 14. A needle tip 18 is formed on or coupled to a distal end of the elongate wire 16 for<br>
penetrating tissue. The device 10 also includes a protective sheath 20 disposed over a distal end<br>
of the shaft 14 and configured to protect the needle tip 18 until it is positioned adjacent to tissue<br>
to be penetrated, as will be discussed in more detail below. The device 10 is also preferably<br>
adapted to coupled to an energy source to allow the needle tip 18 to be energized to facilitate<br>
penetration through tissue.<br>
[0024] The handle 12 of the device 10 can have any shape and size but it is preferably adapted to<br>
facilitate grasping and manipulation of the device. As shown in FIG. 1A, the handle 12 has a<br>
generally elongate cylindrical configuration. The handle 12 can also include other features, such<br>
as an actuating element (not shown) to enable the delivery of energy from an energy source<br>
through the elongate wire 16 to the needle tip 18, as will be discussed below. By way of non-<br>
limiting example, the actuating element can be a button, a switch, a knob, or any other member<br>
configured to actuate delivery of energy from an energy source. In lieu of an actuating element<br>
disposed on the handle 12, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the actuating element can be<br>
located elsewhere, including on a foot pedal. The energy source can be an internal energy<br>
source, such as a battery disposed in the handle 12, or the handle 12 can be adapted to be coupled<br>
to an external energy source. For example, a wire 26, a portion of which is shown in FIG. 1 A,<br>
can include a plug on a terminal end thereof for coupling the handle 12 to a power outlet.<br>
[0025] The shaft 14 of the device can also have a variety of configurations, and it can be flexible<br>
or rigid depending on the intended use. As noted above, the shaft 14 is preferably adapted to be<br>
inserted translumenally, and therefore at least portions of the shaft 14 are preferably semi-<br>
flexible or flexible to allow insertion through a tortuous lumen. One skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that the shaft 14 can be made from a variety of biocompatible materials that have<br>
properties sufficient to enable the shaft 14 to be inserted and moved within channels of a body<br>
lumen. The shaft 14 can also have an elongate length to allow the distal end of the shaft 14 to be<br>
positioned within the body while the proximal end remains external to the body. While the<br>
length can vary, in an exemplary embodiment, the length is in the range of about 100mm to<br>
300mm. The shaft 14 can also include one or more inner lumens extending therethrough for<br>
-6-<br><br>
Atty. Docket No.: 100873-92 (END 5836)<br>
receiving the elongate wire 16. The inner lumen(s) of the shaft 14 can also be used to pass other<br>
instruments or fluids through the device for use during a surgical procedure.<br>
[0026] The elongate wire 16 that extends through the shaft 14 can also have a variety of<br>
configurations, and it can be flexible or rigid depending on the intended use. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the elongate wire 16 is adapted to be used translumenally, and therefore is semi-<br>
flexible or flexible to allow it to bend and flex with the shaft 14 through a tortuous lumen. The<br>
elongate wire 16 is also preferably adapted to deliver energy to a needle tip 18 formed on or<br>
coupled to the distal end of the elongate wire 16 to facilitate penetration of the needle tip 18<br>
through tissue. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the elongate wire 16 can be made from<br>
a variety of conductive materials that have properties sufficient to enable the elongate wire 16 to<br>
conduct and deliver energy to tissue through the needle tip 18. In one embodiment, the elongate<br>
wire 16 can be a single wire electrode. The elongate wire 16 can also include other features,<br>
such as an inner lumen extending therethrough for receiving fluid, such as saline or water. The<br>
fluid can be used to irrigate the tissue site during penetration by the needle tip 18. While the<br>
elongate wire 16 can have a variety of lengths, it preferably is of a fixed length extending from<br>
the handle 12 to a position proximal to a distal-most end of the protective sheath 20. This<br>
prevents the elongate wire 16 from extending beyond the protective sheath 20 when the<br>
protective sheath 20 is in the distal position and the device 10 is not in contact with tissue.<br>
[0027] The needle tip 16 can have various shapes and sizes as well. In one embodiment,<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1B, the needle tip 18 generally has a blunt distal end that can penetrate<br>
through tissue only when energy is delivered thereto. The proximal end of the needle tip 18 is<br>
integrally formed with or coupled to the distal end of the elongate wire 16 to establish an<br>
electrical connection with an energy source. The needle tip 18 can also be made from a variety<br>
of materials. For example, while the needle tip 18 is adapted to be conductive, it need not be<br>
made entirely of conductive material as long as a conductive path exists through the needle tip<br>
18. If made from entirely conductive materials, a portion of the needle tip 18 can be coated with<br>
an insulating material. In other embodiments, the needle tip 18 can be made from a composite<br>
material, which includes conductive and non-conductive materials.<br>
[0028] One skilled in the art will appreciate that the needle tip can have a variety of other<br>
configurations and it can be adapted to treat tissue in a variety of ways. For example, the needle<br>
-7-<br><br>
Atty. Docket No.: 100873-92 (END 5836)<br>
tip can penetrate tissue, such as by cutting the tissue. The needle tip can be blunt and tissue<br>
penetration can be effected or assisted by electrical energy, and/or it can be sharpened so that it<br>
penetrates tissue by mechanical action. Where the needle tip 18 uses energy, i.e., electrosurgical<br>
cutting to penetrate tissue, a sufficient voltage will create an electric spark between the needle tip<br>
18 and the tissue. When the arcing occurs, the cellular fluid gets superheated, for example, to a<br>
temperature greater than 600 degrees Celsius, and the cells swell up due to the internal steam<br>
pressure within the cell. This can cause the cells to explode and vaporize, thus allowing the<br>
needle tip 18 to penetrate the tissue. Other exemplary configurations of a needle tip are also<br>
disclosed herein and can be used with the device of FIG. 1A and 1B.<br>
[0029] The protective sheath 20 can also have various shapes and sizes, but in the illustrated<br>
embodiment, it has a generally hollow configuration with a tapered conical tip having an opening<br>
through which the needle tip 18 can pass. As shown in FIG. 1B, the tip of the protective sheath<br>
20 can be in the form of an end cap 22 that is fixedly attached to the tubular protective sheath 20,<br>
or the end cap 22 can be integrally formed with the protective sheath 20. The protective sheath<br>
20 and the end cap 22 can be mated using a variety of techniques, including male and female<br>
connectors that enable temporary or permanent attachment between the protective sheath 20 and<br>
the end cap 22, or a variety of other methods such as adhesive bonding, that enable the end cap<br>
22 to be mounted to the protective sheath 20. In use, shown in FIG. 1B, the protective sheath 20<br>
is disposed over at least a portion of the shaft 14 and the needle tip 18, and it can be configured<br>
to move between a distal position, in which the needle tip 18 is substantially disposed within the<br>
protective sheath 20, and a proximal position, in which the needle tip 18 extends distally from<br>
the protective sheath 20.<br>
[0030] As noted above, the protective sheath 20 is moveable between a distal and proximal<br>
position. In its distal position, as shown in FIG. 1B, the needle tip 18 does not extend past the<br>
distal-most end of the protective sheath 20, preventing the needle tip 18 from penetrating tissue.<br>
The needle tip 18 can be fully contained within the protective sheath 20, or it can be disposed<br>
within the opening in the tip, as shown. The force of the distal end of the protective sheath 20<br>
against a tissue to be treated causes the protective sheath 20 to move in a proximal direction over<br>
the shaft 14. When so positioned, the needle tip 18 extends past the distal-most end of the<br>
protective sheath 20 to allow the needle tip 18 to contact and penetrate the tissue. After the<br>
needle tip 18 has penetrated the target tissue, or the device 10 has been moved out of contact<br><br>
Atty. Docket No.: 100873-92 (END 5836)<br>
with the target tissue, the pressure is removed from the protective sheath 20, thereby allowing the<br>
protective sheath 20 to move distally to cover the distal end of the needle tip 18 to prevent<br>
continued tissue penetration.<br>
[0031] In an exemplary embodiment, the device 10 can include a biasing element that is adapted<br>
to bias the protective sheath 20 to the distal position. In one embodiment, the biasing element<br>
can be a spring 24, as shown in FIG. 1B, for biasing the protective sheath 20 to the distal<br>
position.   The spring 24 can be disposed around the shaft 14 with its distal end resting against a<br>
distal abutment 26 formed within the protective sheath 20 and its proximal end resting against a<br>
proximal abutment 28 formed on the shaft 14. The biasing force of the spring 24 on the<br>
protective sheath 20 can be overcome by advancing the protective sheath 20 against a tissue<br>
surface, allowing the protective sheath 20 to retract into the proximal position when it is in<br>
contact with a tissue. As the protective sheath 20 moves proximally, the spring 24 compresses<br>
and the needle tip 18 is exposed to allow it to contact the tissue. A person skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that a variety of other biasing elements can be used to bias the protective sheath 20 to<br>
a distal position.<br>
[0032] In other embodiments, rather than the protective sheath 20 moving proximally to expose<br>
the needle tip 18 as described above, the needle tip and the protective sheath can move together<br>
to electrically couple the proximal end of the needle tip with a distal end of the elongate wire.<br>
This is illustrated in FIG. 2, which shows a device 110 having a protective sheath 120 disposed<br>
over at least a portion of the distal end of an elongate shaft 114. An elongate wire 116 extends<br>
through or is integrally formed with the elongate shaft 114, and a needle tip 118 is separable<br>
from the elongate wire 116 and it is fixedly coupled to the protective sheath 120. The protective<br>
sheath 120 includes an opening at its distal end through which the distal end of the needle tip 118<br>
extends.<br>
[0033] In use, the protective sheath 120 is movable between a distal position and a proximal<br>
position, in a manner similar to that previously described with respect to FIG. 1B. The needle tip<br>
118 is spaced apart from the distal end of the elongate wire 116 when the protective sheath 120 is<br>
in a distal, deactivated position. When a distal end of the needle tip 118 contacts tissue, the force<br>
of the tissue on the distal end of the needle tip 118 can move the protective sheath 120 and the<br>
needle tip 118 in a proximal direction, such that the needle tip 118 comes into contact with the<br>
-9-<br><br>
Atty. Docket No.: 100873-92 (END 5836)<br>
distal end of the elongate wire 116 to allow energy to be delivered from the energy source<br>
through the elongate wire 116 to the needle tip 118.<br>
[0034] The device 110 can also include a biasing element that is adapted to bias the protective<br>
sheath 120 and the needle tip 118 to one of the deactivated or activated positions. By way of<br>
example, the biasing element can be a spring 124, similar to spring 24 as described above in<br>
relation to FIG. 1B. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the spring 124 is disposed around the<br>
elongate shaft 114 with its proximal end resting against a proximal abutment 126 disposed on the<br>
elongate shaft 114, and its distal end resting against a distal abutment 128 formed within the<br>
protective sheath 120. The biasing force of the spring 124 on the protective sheath 120 and the<br>
needle tip 118 can be overcome by advancing the protective sheath 120 against a tissue surface,<br>
allowing the protective sheath 120 and the needle tip 118 to retract into the proximal activated<br>
position. As the protective sheath 120 and the needle tip 118 move proximally, an electrical<br>
connection is established between the needle tip 118 and the elongate wire 116, allowing energy<br>
to be delivered to the needle tip 118 through the elongate wire 116 from the energy source to<br>
allow the needle tip 118 to penetrate tissue. Once the tissue penetration has occurred, the force<br>
on the needle tip 118 and the protective sheath 120 is removed, allowing them to move distally to<br>
the deactivated position. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of other<br>
devices, or configurations, suitable for biasing can be used as the biasing element.<br>
[0035] In another exemplary embodiment, the tissue-penetrating devices disclosed herein can be<br>
configured to receive a guidewire therethrough for guiding additional devices through the<br>
puncture created in the penetrated tissue. By way of non-limiting example, the elongate wire 16<br>
and the needle tip 18 of the device of FIGS. 1A-1B can be removed from the device 10 by<br>
pulling on a proximal end of the elongate wire 16. A guidewire (not shown) can be inserted into<br>
the shaft 14 to position the guidewire through the puncture formed in the tissue by the needle tip<br>
18. Once the guidewire has been positioned through the shaft 14, the shaft 14 can be removed,<br>
leaving the guidewire in place. A variety of devices and surgical instruments can then be guided<br>
along the guidewire to facilitate a number of surgical procedures that can be performed at the site<br>
of the penetrated tissue.<br>
[0036] As previously mentioned, the needle tip of the tissue-penetrating device can have a<br>
variety of other configurations. For example, the needle tip can have a maximum width that is<br>
- 10-<br><br>
Atty. Docket No.: 100873-92 (END 5836)<br>
substantially equal to a maximum width of the protective sheath, thereby facilitating insertion of<br>
the protective sheath through tissue. In other words, the needle tip can be configured to form a<br>
penetration or cut in tissue that has an extent, e.g., a diameter or width, that is substantially equal<br>
to a diameter of the sheath. While various techniques can be used to form such a needle tip,<br>
FIGS. 4A-4B illustrate one such exemplary embodiment. In this embodiment, a device 400 is<br>
similar to the device of FIG. 2, except that a needle tip 418 has a multi-bladed configuration, at<br>
least at its distal-most end. In particular, the needle tip 418 includes three planar members 422,<br>
424, 426 that extend radially outward from a central shaft 428, and that are spaced substantially<br>
equidistant apart form one another around the shaft 428, as best shown in FIG. 4B. In order to<br>
accommodate the needle tip 418, a protective sheath 420 of the device 400 can likewise include<br>
three corresponding slits formed therein for receiving the planar members 422, 424, 426, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4A. In use, the needle tip 418 will form a cut in the tissue, and the extent or<br>
diameter of the cut will be substantially equal to the diameter of the protective sheath 420,<br>
thereby allowing the protective sheath 420 to be inserted through the tissue.<br>
[0037] The device of FIG. 4A can also be configured to receive a guidewire therethrough. As<br>
shown in FIG. 4C, the distal-most end of the protective sheath 420 can include a guidewire port<br>
430 formed therein that is positioned offset from the slits for receiving the needle tip 418. Thus,<br>
a guidewire 432 can extend substantially adjacent to an elongate wire 416 through a shaft 414,<br>
and it can extend out of the guidewire port 430 to be positioned through the tissue.<br>
[0038] The various devices disclosed herein can also include an expandable member that is<br>
adapted to increase the size of the puncture formed in tissue by a needle tip.   FIG. 3 illustrates<br>
one embodiment of an expandable member disposed on the device 10 of FIGS. 1A-1B. As<br>
shown, the expandable member is in the form of a dilating balloon 200 that is configured to be<br>
inflated to expand the size of the puncture. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that a<br>
variety of other expandable members can be used to expand a puncture created by a needle tip.<br>
When used in conjunction with the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1A-1B, the balloon 200 can<br>
be disposed on the elongate shaft 14 at a location proximal to the protective sheath 20. After the<br>
needle tip 18 and the protective sheath 20 have penetrated through tissue, the device 10 can be<br>
advanced to position the deflated balloon 200 within the puncture site. The balloon 200 can then<br>
be inflated using, for example, fluid or air introduced through a lumen in the device. As shown<br>
in FIG. 3, the device can include an insuflation tube 204 having a proximal port 202 and a distal<br>
- 11 -<br><br>
Atly. Docket No.: 100873-92 (END 5836)<br>
connector 206 coupled to the handle. In other embodiments, a port can be formed directly in the<br>
handle. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the expandable member can be associated<br>
with other devices, such as the guidewire described above. For example, the expandable<br>
member can be disposed on or positioned over the guidewire to allow for positioning the<br>
expandable member within the puncture site.<br>
[0039] The tissue-penetrating devices described herein can also be used with other surgical<br>
device or instruments. For example, an endoscope can be passed through the esophagus and<br>
positioned within the stomach. A tissue-penetrating device, such as the devices 10, 110<br>
described in FIGS. 1A-2, can be introduced through a working channel of the endoscope and<br>
used to create a puncture hole in the stomach wall by penetrating the tissue of the stomach wall.<br>
A guidewire can then be feed through the device to the site of the puncture hole created in the<br>
stomach wall, and the tissue-penetrating device can be removed, leaving the guidewire as a<br>
placeholder. An expandable member disposed on the guidewire or positioned over the guidewire<br>
can be positioned within the puncture site. Once the expandable member has been inflated and<br>
the size of the puncture hole in the stomach wall has been increased, the endoscope can be<br>
advanced into the expandable member to push the expandable member and the endoscope<br>
through the puncture hole and into the abdominal cavity. A person skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that a guidewire and separate expandable member are not necessary where the tissue-<br>
penetrating devices include an expandable member. In such a case, the expandable member can<br>
be positioned within the puncture and expanded to enlarge the puncture. The endoscope can then<br>
be advanced into the expandable member to push the expandable member and thus the<br>
endoscope through the puncture. Additional instruments and devices can then be passed through<br>
the working channel of the endoscope to perform various procedures.<br>
[0040] One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate further features and advantages of the<br>
invention based on the above-described embodiments. Accordingly, the invention is not to be<br>
limited by what has been particularly shown and described, except as indicated by the appended<br>
