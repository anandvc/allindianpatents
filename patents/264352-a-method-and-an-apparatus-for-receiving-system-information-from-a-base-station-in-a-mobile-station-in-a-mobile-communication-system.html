BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication system,<br>
and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for receiving system information<br>
from a Base Station (BS) in a Mobile Station (MS) in a mobile communication<br>
system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a mobile communication system, a BS transmits to an MS system<br>
information, which refers to various pieces of information required for<br>
communications between the BS and the MS, including information for channel<br>
establishment and a list of neighbor cells. The system information is carried in<br>
System Information Blocks (SIBs), generally 18 SIBs.<br>
The BS can use one of two methods to notify the MS of a change in the<br>
system information, i.e. a change in the SIBs. In one of the methods, the BS<br>
periodically transmits a Master Information Block (MIB) and the MS monitors<br>
the MIB. The MIB transmission period is equal to the monitoring period. The<br>
MIB, which provides information required for transmission of the SIBs, includes<br>
information bits called an MIB value tag and SIB value tags. The MIB value tag<br>
indicates whether the system information has been changed and the SIB value<br>
tags indicate an SIB that has been changed.<br>
The MIB or the SIBs can be broadcast on a Broadcast Control CHannel<br>
(BCCH).<br>
In this method, the MS monitors the system information in the same period<br>
as the transmission period of the system information of the BS. Therefore, when<br>
the system information is changed, modification time information is not needed.<br>
The modification time information indicates a time when the changed system<br><br>
information is applied.<br>
The other method is that the BS notifies the MS of a change in the system<br>
information when the change occurs, rather than periodically. This method<br>
requires the modification time information.<br>
A brief description will now be made of how it is determined whether the<br>
system information has been changed by use of the value tags. The following<br>
description applies to both the methods.<br>
If a first MIB value tag is 0 and a second MIB value tag is 0, this indicates<br>
that no change has occurred to the system information. If an SIB is changed, the<br>
MIB value tag is set to 1, to thereby notify the MS of a change in the system<br>
information. Each time the system information changes, the MIB value tag<br>
sequentially increases. The MIB value tag just notifies the MS of whether the<br>
system information has been changed, and does not indicate the changed system<br>
information. Hence, when receiving a different MIB value tag compared to the<br>
previous one, the MS identifies the changed system information by checking SIB<br>
value tags.<br>
If the MIB value tag is changed to 1 in the above example, the MS<br>
determines that the system information has been changed. To find out the changed<br>
system information, the MS then reads each of the 18 SIB value tags and acquires<br>
the changed system information from an SIB corresponding to a changed SIB<br>
value tag.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a signal flow for a conventional operation for receiving<br>
system information from an Evolved Radio Access Network (E-RAN) in a User<br>
Equipment (UE) in a mobile communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, in the mobile communication system, an E-RAN 100<br>
transmits an MIB with an MIB value tag to a UE 110 in step 120 and an SIB to<br>
the UE 110 in step 130. It is assumed that the MIB value tag is error-free and has<br>
an increased value and thus the UE 110 has read SIB value tags. To determine a<br>
changed SIB using a changed SIB value tag, the UE 110 checks an error in the<br><br>
received SIB in step 140. If the SIB has an error, the UE 110 neglects the SIB in<br>
step 150 and receives a new SIB in step 160. For the sake of convenience, a<br>
description of MIB transmission is not provided herein.<br>
In step 170, the UE 110 checks errors in the SIB. If no errors are detected,<br>
the UE 110 buffers the SIB in a buffer in step 180. If an error is detected in the<br>
received SIB, the UE 110 neglects the SIB and repeats SIB reception until no<br>
errors are detected in the procedure of FIG 1. The repetition causes a long time<br>
delay for the UE to receive normal SIBs and determine the changed system<br>
information. As a consequence, communications are delayed between the E-RAN<br>
and the UE.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The matters defined in the description such as a detailed construction and<br>
elements are provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
recognize that various changes and modifications of the embodiments described<br>
herein can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
Also, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions are omitted for the<br>
sake of clarity and conciseness.<br>
The present invention increases the reception success rate of SEBs by<br>
combining a previously stored SIB with a received SIB according to a combining<br>
condition that is defined by an MIB value tag, a modification time and an SIB<br>
value tag. Compared to the conventional technology, SIB value tags can be<br>
transmitted together with an MIB value tag or separately from the MIB value tag<br>
in the present invention. As previously described, one of the two methods for<br>
receiving system information in the UE requires the modification time<br>
information, whereas the other method does not require the modification time<br>
information. The present invention is applicable to the two cases.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a mobile communication system according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, an E-RAN 215 is configured in a simple structure<br>
having Evolved Node Bs (ENBs) 225, 230, 235, 240 and 245 and anchor nodes<br><br>
205 and 210. A UE 250 accesses an Internet Protocol (IP) network via the E-RAN<br>
215. The ENBs 225 to 245 are connected wirelessly to the UE 250. Since all user<br>
traffic including real-time services such as Voice over IP (VoIP) is serviced on a<br>
shared channel, the ENBs 225 to 245 collect the status information of UEs and<br>
schedule them, for reliable information transmission/reception.<br>
Typically, one ENB controls a plurality of cells. The ENB performs<br>
Adaptive Modulating and Coding (AMC) that determines a modulation scheme<br>
and a channel coding rate for a UE adaptively according to the channel status of<br>
the UE. Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) is carried out between the<br>
ENBs 225 to 245 and the UE 250. Because HARQ alone has limitations in<br>
satisfying different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, an outer ARQ is<br>
performed between the UE 250 and the ENBs 225 to 245 in an upper layer.<br>
HARQ increases a reception success rate by soft-combining previous<br>
received data with retransmitted data without discarding the previous received<br>
data. HARQ is adopted to achieve high transmission efficiency in high-speed<br>
packet communications such as High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)<br>
and Enhanced Dedicated CHannel (EDCH).<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a UE for receiving SIBs according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 3, a receiver 300 receives an SIB from the ENB 230. An<br>
error checker 310 checks errors in the received SIB by, for example, a Cyclic<br>
Redundancy Check (CRC). A controller 320 provides the SIB to a buffer 330 or a<br>
combiner 340 according to a condition defined by an MIB value tag, an SIB value<br>
tag, and a modification time that are associated with the SIB. The condition will<br>
be detailed later herein.<br>
The buffer 330 buffers the received SIB or a combined SIB and provides a<br>
buffered SIB to the combiner 340 and the received SIB or the combined SIB to a<br>
decoder 350 according to commands received from the controller 320. The<br>
combiner 340 combines the received SIB with the buffered SIB and provides the<br>
combined SIB to the buffer 330. The decoder 350 decodes the received SIB<br>
without errors or the combined SIB and provides the decoded SIB to the<br><br>
controller 320.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a signal flow for an operation for receiving an SIB in the<br>
UE according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, on the assumption that a UE 410 has received a<br>
changed MIB value tag and thus checked SIB value tags, the UE 410 receives an<br>
SIB from an E-RAN 400 in step 420. Since the MIB value tag has an increased<br>
value, the UE 410 should acquire changed system information from an SIB<br>
corresponding to a changed SIB value tag. Hence, the UE 410 checks errors in the<br>
received SIB in step 430. If the SIB has an error, the UE 410 buffers the SIB in<br>
the buffer 330 in step 440. This SIB is referred to as a buffered SIB. The UE 410<br>
also stores the MIB value tag and the SIB value tags in the buffer 330 or any<br>
other storage (not shown). In step 450, the UE 410 receives an MIB value tag and<br>
SIB value tags at the next scheduling time. It is assumed that the UE 410 receives<br>
modification time information in step 460.<br>
In step 470, the UE 410 receives an SIB. While the MIB value tag, the SIB<br>
value tags and the modification time information are received in separate steps,<br>
they can be received together. The UE 410 performs an error check on the<br>
received SIB in step 480. If the SIB has an error, the UE 410 compares at least<br>
one of the stored MIB value tag and SIB value tags with the received MIB value<br>
tag, SIB value tags, and modification time information. The UE 410 determines<br>
whether to combine or buffer the received SIB according to a combining<br>
condition after the comparison in step 495. The combining condition is defined<br>
according to whether the received MIB value tag has been changed, the received<br>
SIB value tags have been changed, and the UE receives the modification time<br>
information.<br>
For better understanding of the present invention, the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention are classified according to the following<br>
two criteria.<br>
(1) The preferred embodiments of the present invention are divided<br>
depending on whether the UE receives modification time information. The<br>
instance when the UE does not receive modification time information will be<br><br>
described with reference to FIGs. 5, 6 and 9. The instance when the UE receives<br>
modification time information will be described with reference to FIGs. 7 and 10.<br>
(2) The preferred embodiments of the present invention are divided<br>
depending on whether the UE receives an SIB earlier than an SIB value tag. The<br>
instance when the UE receives an SIB later than an SIB value tag will be<br>
described with reference to FIGs. 5, 6 and 7. The instance when the UE receives<br>
an SIB earlier than an SIB value tag will be described with reference to FIGs. 9<br>
and 10.<br>
Unlike the conventional technology, the UE can receive an SIB earlier than<br>
an SIB value tag in the present invention. The present invention is not limited to<br>
the instance when an SIB value tag is transmitted together with an MIB value tag<br>
in an MIB. That is, the SIB value tag can be transmitted separately from the MIB<br>
value tag depending on system configuration.<br>
FIGs. 5, 6 and 7 illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention in<br>
which the UE receives an SIB according to a combining condition.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates an operation for receiving an SIB in the UE according to a<br>
first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Combining condition 1 for the procedure of FIG 5 is that when the UE does<br>
not receive modification time information, the latest received MIB value tag (i.e.,<br>
a current MIB value tag) has the same value as a stored MIB value tag (i.e., a<br>
buffered MIB value tag). Since the MIB value tag has not been changed, current<br>
SIB value tags are identical to buffered SIB value tags. Therefore, the combining<br>
condition does not involve the SIB value tags.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the UE receives a current SIB in step 500 and checks<br>
for errors in the current SIB in step 510. When the current SIB has an error, the<br>
UE proceeds to step 520 and if the current SIB has no errors, the UE jumps to<br>
step 570.<br>
Since the current SIB is error-free, it can be applied to the UE immediately<br><br>
in step 570. Hence, the current SIB is directly output, without being buffered in<br>
the buffer.<br>
In step 520, the UE determines whether there is a buffered SIB in the buffer.<br>
In the absence of a buffered SIB, the UE buffers the current SIB in the buffer<br>
because the current SIB is the latest SIB in step 560.<br>
In the presence of a buffered SIB, the UE combines the buffered SIB with<br>
the current SIB in step 530 and checks for errors in the combined SIB in step 540.<br>
If the combined SIB has no errors, the UE outputs the combined SIB without<br>
buffering it in step 570. If the combined SIB has an error, the UE clears the buffer<br>
in step 550 and buffers the combined SIB in the buffer in step 580.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates an operation for receiving an SIB in the UE according to a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Combining condition 2 for the procedure of FIG. 6 is that when the UE does<br>
not receive modification time information, a current MIB value tag has a different<br>
value from that of a buffered MIB value tag and a current SIB value tag has the<br>
same value as a buffered SIB value tag.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the UE receives a current SIB in step 600 and checks<br>
for errors in the current SIB in step 605. When the current SIB has an error, the<br>
UE proceeds to step 610 and if the current SIB has no errors, the UE jumps to<br>
step 650.<br>
Since the current SIB is error-free, it can be applied to the UE immediately<br>
in step 650. Hence, the current SIB is directly output, without being buffered in<br>
the buffer.<br>
In step 610, the UE determines whether there is a buffered SIB in the buffer.<br>
In the absence of a buffered SIB, the UE buffers the current SIB in the buffer<br>
because the current SIB is the latest SIB in step 655.<br>
In the presence of a buffer SIB, the UE compares a current SIB value tag<br><br>
with a buffered SIB value tag in step 615. If the two SIB value tags are different,<br>
the UE clears the buffered SIB from the buffer in step 620 and buffers the current<br>
SIB in the buffer since the current SIB is the latest SIB in step 625.<br>
If the two SIB value tags are identical, the UE combines the current SIB<br>
with the buffered SIB in step 630 and checks for errors in the combined SIB in<br>
step 635. If no errors are detected from the combined SIB, the UE outputs the<br>
combined SIB without buffering it in step 650. If an error is detected in the<br>
combined SIB, the UE clears the buffered SIB from the buffer in step 640 and<br>
buffers the combined SIB in step 645.<br>
FIG 7 illustrates an operation for receiving an SIB in the UE according to a<br>
third exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Combining condition 3 for the procedure of FIG. 7 is that when the UE<br>
receives modification time information, a current MIB value tag has a different<br>
value from that of a buffered MIB value tag, a buffered SIB is received after a<br>
modification time, and a current SIB value tag has the same value as a buffered<br>
SIB value tag.<br>
Referring to FIG 7, the UE receives a current SIB in step 700 and checks<br>
for errors in the current SIB in step 705. When the current SIB has an error, the<br>
UE proceeds to step 710 and if the current SIB has no errors, the UE jumps to<br>
step 755.<br>
Since the current SIB is error-free, it can be applied to the UE immediately.<br>
Hence, the current SIB is directly output, without being buffered in the buffer in<br>
step 755.<br>
In step 710, the UE determines whether there is a buffered SIB in the buffer.<br>
In the presence of a buffered SIB, the UE proceeds to step 715 and in the absence<br>
of a buffered SIB, the UE proceeds to step 760. In step 760, since the buffered<br>
SIB does not exist in the buffer or was received before the modification time, the<br>
UE buffers the current SIB being the latest SIB in the buffer. If the current SIB<br>
has been received before the modification time information, this indicates that the<br><br>
current SIB is not the latest SIB.<br>
In step 715, the UE determines whether the buffered SIB was received after<br>
the modification time. If the buffered SIB was received before the modification<br>
time, the UE proceeds to step 760. If the buffered SIB was received after the<br>
modification time, the UE compares a current SIB value tag with a buffered SIB<br>
value tag in step 720. If the two SIB value tags are different, the UE clears the<br>
buffered SIB from the buffer in step 725 and buffers the received SIB in the<br>
buffer since the current SIB is the latest SIB in step 730.<br>
If the two SIB value tags are identical, the UE combines the current SIB<br>
with the buffered SIB in step 735 and checks for errors in the combined SIB in<br>
step 740. If no errors are detected from the combined SIB, the UE outputs the<br>
combined SIB without buffering it in step 755. If an error is detected in the<br>
combined SIB, the UE clears the buffered SIB from the buffer in step 745 and<br>
buffers the combined SIB in step 750.<br>
The embodiments depicted in FIGs. 5, 6 and 7 concern instances when the<br>
UE receives an MIB value tag and an SIB value tag before receiving an SIB. As<br>
previously stated, the UE can receive the SIB value tag separately from the MIB<br>
value tag. Hence, it may occur that the UE receives an SIB before the SIB value<br>
tag, which is illustrated in FIG. 8.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a signal flow for an operation for receiving an SIB earlier<br>
than an SIB value tag in the UE according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, a UE 810 receives a changed MIB value tag from an E-<br>
RAN 800 and thus is aware of a change in an SIB in step 820. Thus, the UE 810<br>
receives a new SIB in step 830 and receives an SIB value tag after the SIB<br>
reception in step 840.<br>
When an SIB value tag is transmitted separately from an MIB, the UE may<br>
fail to receive the SIB value tag due to transmission loss, for example, despite<br>
reception of an MIB value tag. FIGs. 9 and 10 describe the instance when the UE<br>
fails to receive the SIB value tag.<br><br>
FIG. 9 illustrates an operation for receiving an SIB in the UE according to a<br>
fourth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Combining condition 4 for the procedure of FIG 9 is that when the UE does<br>
not receive modification time information, a current MIB value tag has a different<br>
value from that of a buffered MIB value tag and a current SEB value tag has not<br>
been received.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the UE receives a current SIB in step 900 and checks<br>
for errors in the current SIB in step 910. When the current SIB has an error, the<br>
UE proceeds to step 920 and if the current SIB has no errors, the UE jumps to<br>
step 960.<br>
Since the current SIB is error-free, it can be immediately applied to the UE.<br>
Hence, the current SIB is directly output, without being buffered in the buffer in<br>
step 960.<br>
In step 920, the UE determines whether there is a buffered SIB in the buffer.<br>
In the presence of a buffered SIB, the UE proceeds to step 930 and in the absence<br>
of a buffered SIB, the UE proceeds to step 960. In step 960, since the buffered<br>
SIB does not exist in the buffer, the UE buffers the current SIB being the latest<br>
SIB in the buffer.<br>
In step 930, the UE combines the current SIB with the buffered SIB. The<br>
UE checks for errors in the combined SIB in step 940. If no errors are detected<br>
from the combined SIB, the UE outputs the combined SIB without buffering it in<br>
step 970. If an error is detected in the combined SIB, the UE clears the buffered<br>
SIB from the buffer in step 950 and buffers the current SIB in step 960. The UE<br>
does not buffer the combined SIB in step 960, because the UE cannot identify an<br>
SIB having changed system information among a plurality of SIBs if the UE has<br>
not received the SIB value tag. Thus, when the combined SIB has an error, this<br>
implies that the current SIB can be different from the buffered SIB. Thus, the<br>
erroneous combined SIB is discarded and instead, the current SIB having the<br>
latest system information is buffered in the buffer.<br><br>
FIG. 10 illustrates an operation for receiving an SIB in the UE according to<br>
a fifth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Combining condition 5 for the procedure of FIG 10 is that when the UE<br>
receives modification time information, a current MIB value tag has a different<br>
value from that of a buffered MIB value tag and a buffered SIB was received after<br>
a modification time.<br>
In FIG. 10, the UE receives a changed MIB value tag and receives an SIB<br>
value tag after receiving an SIB. As previously stated, the UE receives<br>
modification time information.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the UE receives a current SIB in step 1000 and checks<br>
for errors in the current SIB in step 1010. When the current SIB has an error, the<br>
UE proceeds to step 1020 and if the current SIB has no errors, the UE jumps to<br>
step 1080.<br>
Since the current SIB is error-free, it can be immediately applied to the UE.<br>
Hence, the current SIB is directly output, without being buffered in the buffer in<br>
step 1080.<br>
In step 1020, the UE determines whether there is a buffered SIB in the<br>
buffer. In the presence of a buffered SIB, the UE proceeds to step 1030 and in the<br>
absence of a buffered SIB, the UE goes to step 1090.<br>
In step 1090, since the buffered SIB does not exist in the buffer or if any,<br>
the buffered SIB was received before a modification time, the UE buffers the<br>
current SIB being the latest SIB in the buffer.<br>
In step 1040, the UE combines the current SIB with the buffered SIB. The<br>
UE checks for errors in the combined SIB in step 1050. If no errors are detected<br>
from the combined SIB, the UE outputs the combined SIB without buffering it in<br>
step 1080. If an error is detected in the combined SIB, the UE clears the buffered<br>
SIB from the buffer in step 1060 and buffers the combined SIB in step 1070.<br><br>
As is apparent from the above description, the present invention<br>
advantageously increases the reception success rate of an SIB through combining<br>
in a UE, even though the SIB received from an ENB has an error in a mobile<br>
communication system. Also, when the UE receives an SIB from an ENB, for<br>
operation, the present invention decreases a reception time delay.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
exemplary embodiments of the present invention thereof, it will be understood by<br>
those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made<br>
therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as<br>
