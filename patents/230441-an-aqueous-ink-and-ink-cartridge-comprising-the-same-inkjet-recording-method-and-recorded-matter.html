DESCRIPTION<br>
AQUEOUS INK, INK CARTRIDGE USING THE SAME, INKJET PRINTING METHOD AND RECORDED MATTER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an aqueous ink (hereinafter also referred to as ink), an inkjet printing method using the aqueous ink, a recorded matter obtained by the printing method, and devices using such an ink. More particularly, the present invention relates to a technique for making practical a surfactant which cannot be used or can be used only in a very small amount in an ink under normal conditions due to its low HLB (surfactant which is very poor in solubility in an ink, and is separated and precipitated in a state in which an ink containing the surfactant is stored).<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Various studies and reports have been made for inks for use in writing implements and inks for inkj et recording for the purpose of improving image quality of the obtained recorded matter and fixation and reliability of the ink. For example, as methods for improving fixation of a recorded matter, a method in which water-soluble alcohol is incorporated in an<br><br>
aqueous ink, a method in which a highly hydrophobic water-soluble organic solvent, e.g. cellosolve is incorporated in an aqueous ink, and the like have been proposed. However, incorporation of the above compounds in an ink in a large amount improves fixation but degrades quality of a recorded matter. Moreover, use of the above compounds may cause problems as to inflammability of an ink and safety of human bodies.<br>
On the other hand, a method in which a water-soluble surfactant is incorporated in an ink to improve fixation of a recorded matter is proposed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H5-132643. It can be said that this method is preferable in terms of safety, but the viscosity of an ink increases as the content of the surfactant in the ink is increased for improving fixation of the recorded matter.  For example, if the method is used for an inkjet printing method, reliability including ink ejection is impaired.  If the surfactant is added in an ink in a large amount for further improvement of fixation, the ink may spread on the surface of a recording medium to degrade image quality of the obtained recorded matter.<br>
On the other hand, it is proposed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H6-256696 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-253599<br><br>
that a hydrophilic surfactant is used in conjunction with a highly hydrophobic surfactant to improve fixation of a recorded matter. However, the amount of such a highly hydrophobic surfactant capable of being used in an ink is very small. Thus, fixation cannot be considerably improved compared to the conventional method using a water-soluble surfactant.<br>
In Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hll-71543, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H8-183921, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H6-9911, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H6-220376, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H10-140058, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H5-125313, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H10-265727, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H9-279067, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H9-217031, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H6-256696, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
HlO-130551 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
*<br>
No. 2001-26202 6, various propositions are made for the method in which a hydrophobic compound is used in an ink. Among them, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hll-71543, it is proposed that a water-insoluble material such as water-insoluble ethylene oxide, propylene oxide oil, water-insoluble alcohol or water-insoluble aldehyde is dissolved using an acid such as benzoic acid or xylene sulfonic acid,<br><br>
salt thereof, resorcin or the like, and using a co-solvent such as 2-pyrrolidone or glycol ester as required. However, in the above proposition, a water-insoluble material is dissolved using an acid or salt thereof, ester compound or polar compound, and therefore undesirable effects are produced on safety of human bodies, and solutes of internal additives and the like emerge in a member contacting an ink from the member to produce undesirable effects on stability and reliability of the ink. Moreover, if the acid or salt thereof is used in a large amount, precipitation easily occurs in the ink, or around an ink eject hole in the case of the Inkjet recording method, for example, and thus reliability of the ink or in recording is impaired. Especially in the Inkjet recording method, the influence may be significant because the size of ejected ink droplets is small.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
Further studies on the propositions in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H6-256696 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-253599 described above reveal that use of a highly hydrophobic surfactant in conjunction with a similar surfactant also has a problem such that the highly hydrophobic surfactant is easily separated from an<br><br>
ink due to a change in environment of the ink, for example a change in temperature. The highly hydrophobic surfactant forms micelles with the other surfactant which is hydrophilic, whereby it is apparently dissolved in the ink, but the clouding point of such a system is lower than that of a system where only the hydrophilic surfactant used in conjunction would be used. That is, due to use of the highly hydrophobic surfactant, an environment of unstable temperature of the surfactant occurs at a low temperature, and thus the highly hydrophobic surfactant is easily separated in ink or deposited on a member or the like contacting the ink to impair reliability and stability.<br>
In addition, in recent years, an ink showing a further improvement in fixation has found a wider range of applications with speedups in recording techniques, and development of an ink excellent in stability and reliability of the ink and allowing a recorded matter excellent in image quality to be stably obtained, and an inkjet recording method is desired*<br>
Thus, an object of the present invention is to solve the above problems and provide an ink which has a higher fixation of a recorded matter, is excellent in stability and reliability of the ink, and allows a recorded matter excellent in image quality to be<br><br>
stably obtained, and an inkjet recording method, and devices using such ink.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a technique which makes it possible to use in a large amount a surfactant having a low HLB (surfactant which is very poor in solubility in an ink, and is separated and precipitated in a state in which the ink containing the surfactant is stored).<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an ink capable of dissolving or dispersing stably a surfactant therein which improves fixation of the ink on a recording medium but is very poor in stability of dissolution or dispersion in the ink, and thus has been rarely used previously, and increasing the content of the surfactant, thereby making it possible to improve fixation of the ink on the recording medium and improving the quality of an obtained recorded image, an inkjet recording method and devices using such ink.<br>
The above objects are achieved by the present invention described below. That is, the present invention is an aqueous ink characterized by comprising micromicelles comprised of: at least two surfactants forming micelles in an opaque or translucent dispersed state in water when used in conjunction; and a compound having an alkyl group less hydrophobic than each of the above described<br><br>
surfactants, and having only a hydroxyl group as a water-soluble group. According to the present invention, unlike the previously adopted method in which a surfactant having a high solubility is added to an ink, a surfactant having a low solubility is stably dispersed in the ink in a micromicelle form as if it were dissolved, whereby the aqueous ink containing micromicelles has considerably improved fixation of a recorded matter, and an ink excellent in stability and reliability of the ink and allowing a recorded matter excellent in image quality to be stably obtained, an inkjet recording method and devices using such ink can be provided.<br>
It is preferable that the two or more surfactants include a first surfactant having an HLB equal to or greater than 6 and less than 10 and a second surfactant having an HLB of 10 to 15, wherein said first and second surfactants have the structurally same hydrophobic group unit, because more transparent micromicelles can be formed in the ink. These two or more surfactants are further preferably surfactants each having as a water-soluble group ethylene oxide having hydroxyl groups at the ends because excellent penetrability can be obtained. Of course, an excellent coloring material image can be formed by incorporating a coloring material in the ink. The most preferable invention is an aqueous ink<br><br>
characterized by comprising a first surfactant having an HLB equal to or greater than 6 and less than 10 and a second surfactant having an HLB of 10 to 15, of which at least the units composed of hydrophobic groups have the same structure, and a compound having a hydrophobic group different from the above described hydrophobic group unit and less hydrophobic than the above described units and a hydrophilic portion composed of only a hydroxyl group, and comprising micromicelles including the first and second surfactants and the above described compound. According to the present invention, it is made possible to use a surfactant being insoluble or having a low HLB, which has been difficult to use, by forming the surfactant into micromicelles, the surfactant can be effectively used in an inkjet eject system utilizing a change in environmental temperature or heat energy, and advantages can be obtained such as improvement in fixation which can be obtained independent behavior of the surfactant in image formation or on a sheet of paper.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will now be described more in detail while showing preferred embodiments of the invention. For developing an ink having improved fixation of a recorded matter, excellent in stability and reliability of the ink, and allowing a recorded matter of good quality to be obtained, the inventors of the present invention considered various mechanisms and made studies and evaluations on various coloring materials and ink compositions. As a result, it was found that by combining a compound having an alkyl group and having only a hydroxyl group as a water-soluble group with two or more surfactants which exhibit an opaque or translucent dispersed state in water under certain conditions, as constituent components of an ink which have not been considered previously, micromicelles, which are dispersed into a transparent single phase as if the<br><br>
hydrophobic components were dissolved in water and the dispersibility of which is hardly affected by heat are formed.  Furthermore, the inventors found a new fact that use of the micromicelles in an aqueous ink improves quality of a recorded matter, stabilizes an ink, and improves fixation of the obtained recorded matter, thus leading to the present invention.<br>
That is, it was found that by using an aqueous ink including micromicelles dispersible in water, characterized in that the micromicelles are comprised of two or more surfactants which exhibit an opaque or translucent dispersed state in water, and a compound having an alkyl group and having only a hydroxyl group as a water-soluble group, fixation of the ink and quality of the obtained recorded matter are improved and stability and reliability of the ink and the recorded matter are excellent when the ink is added to a recording medium, and the ink shows especially desirable results if used in inkjet recording.  In addition, it was found that the ink according to the present invention, having the above described construction, is considerably improved compared to use of the conventional ink especially in terms of improvement in fixation of the recorded matter and reliability of the ink.<br>
The "micromicelle" as used in the present<br><br>
invention means a micelle such that by utilizing the characteristic of micelle formation specific to a surfactant, a water-insoluble compound added to an aqueous phase forms and disperses transparent micelles as if it were dissolved in the aqueous phase without floating on a gas-liquid interface and precipitating at the bottom, and micelle formation is hard to be collapsed by heat. The micromicelle is not reactive to a coloring material, and exists substantially by itself in a liquid medium such as an ink.<br>
The micromicelle is different from a microemulsion transparently dispersing a water-insoluble compound with general resin components and a micelle dispersing a water-insoluble compound in a micelle form with a surfactant.  Specifically, in the microemulsion and the dispersion in a micelle form, a water-insoluble compound is dispersed as if it were dissolved in water, but thermal stability is poor, and therefore they are not preferable for the inkjet recording method in which recording is performed by acting heat energy on an ink. Furthermore, the amount of water-insoluble compound is proportional to the amount of surfactant to be dispersed in a micelle form, and therefore if a large amount of water-insoluble compound is required, the amount of the surfactant also increases, and the micelle enormously<br><br>
increases in size or is emulsified, and if the surfactant is used in an ink, an increase in viscosity of the ink and a reduction in surface tension easily occur, and if the surfactant is used in inkjet recording, ejection of the ink is often compromised.<br>
In contrast to this, the aqueous ink of the present invention comprising micromicelles dispersible in water, characterized in that the micromicelles are comprised of two or more surfactants which exhibit an opaque or translucent dispersed state in water when used in conjunction, and a compound having an alkyl group and having only a hydroxyl group as a water-soluble group has improved fixation and penetrability on a sheet of paper and has good thermal stability. Because neither an enormous increase in size of micelles nor formation of an emulsified state occurs, use of an ink using micromicelles in inkjet recording does not cause any problems for ejection and the like. The present invention will be described below.  First, if it is considered important to obtain high solubility for a surfactant in terms of stability and reliability of an ink, a highly hydrophilic compound is used as a penetrant for the purpose of generally improving fixation of a recorded matter, remarkable fixation cannot be obtained.  If fixation is<br><br>
considered most important, a highly hydrophobic compound is used, whereby remarkable fixation can be obtained, but the highly hydrophobic compound is precipitated or separated in the ink, and thus reliability and stability of the ink are impaired.<br>
In view of the situation, the inventors continuously made reviews and detailed studies on recording mediums and various compounds and inks existing in the world. As a result, it was found that, for example, the surface of plain paper such as copy paper is made hydrophobic for improvement in image quality of a recorded matter, and is configured to control penetration of an aqueous liquid when an aqueous ink is used.  From the above findings, the inventors concluded that for achieving good ink fixation, a hydrophobic part of the surface of a recording medium should be made hydrophilic by incorporating a highly hydrophobic compound in an aqueous ink.<br>
Generally, however, if a highly hydrophobic compound is added to an aqueous ink, the compound becomes unstable in the ink and is separated as a degree of its hydrophobicity increases. There is also available a method in which a highly hydrophobic compound is used in conjunction with a highly hydrophilic compound to form micelles which may be solubilized. However water molecules surrounding<br><br>
such micelles have weakened the strength of bonding with the micelles due to an increase in temperature or the like, and therefore the micelles enormously increase in size for maintaining stability or are separated from the highly hydrophobic compound for stability, resulting in impairment of reliability of the ink and reduction in penetrability.<br>
In regard to micelles formed by using a highly hydrophobic compound in conjunction with a highly hydrophilic compound, the inventors made studies and reviews again on a state of the micelles in an aqueous solution, and functional groups contributing to dissolution or dispersion of the micelles in water, and as a result, the inventors found the following:<br>
(1)	the micelle is compounds gathering with a hydrophobic part as a base point, in which a hydrophilic portion is hydrogen-bonded with water molecules to dissolve or disperse the compounds in water;<br>
(2)	typically, the micelle is formed more easily when the hydrophobic part and the hydrophilic portion have similar structures;<br>
(3)	when the hydration capability of the hydrophilic portion is reduced due to an increase in temperature or the like, dissolution or dispersion of the micelle collapses in a moment, or the micelle enormously increases in size for stability; and<br><br>
(4) ethylene oxide is usually used as . a hydration group.<br>
The contents of items listed above were examined again from a multilateral viewpoint and as a result, the composition of the ink of the present invention was achieved.<br>
The inventors presume that for the aqueous ink according to the present invention, stability and reliability of the aqueous ink and fixation of the obtained recorded matter are improved owing to the specific mechanisms described below.  Generally, it is presumed that in the case of a method in which a highly hydrophobic compound is used in conjunction with a highly hydrophilic compound to be formed into micelles, whereby the highly hydrophobic compound is made soluble, the process proceeds as shown in Figures 1 and 2. However, as the temperature of this system increases, for example, the bond between water molecules surrounding micelles and the micelles is weakened so that the micelles become hard to be maintained as shown in Figures 3 and 4, and as shown in Figures 5 and 6, the micelles enormously increase in size for attracting a larger number of water molecules (see Figure 6), or separate therefrom the highly hydrophobic compound to maintain stability (see Figure 5) .  In contrast to this, it is presumed that according to the composition of the ink of the<br><br>
present invention, the resulting micelles have a configuration in which a low-hydrophobic compound having only a hydroxyl group as a hydrophilic group is captured as if pellets were hammered into a ball, and thus the density of the hydrophilic groups possessed by the micelle increases, resulting in formation of micromicelles stable and resistant to a change in temperature, as shown in Figure 7.<br>
For good fixation, it is presumed that when an ink is deposited on copy paper or the like having the surface made hydrophobic for improving print quality, for example, a combination of two or more surfactants which exhibit an opaque or translucent dispersed state in water is actively deposited on a hydrophobic part of copy paper, whereby the copy paper is made hydrophilic in a direction of ink penetration to obtain good fixation as shown in Figure 8. A surfactant in a micromicelle form transparently dissolved in an ink droplet, shown in the Figure, has a strong affinity for water, and therefore the surfactant is hard to.be deposited on the hydrophobic part of the copy paper, and can contribute to fixation of a coloring material existing in a next ink droplet.<br>
For high quality of recorded images, it can be considered that a surfactant or a combination of surfactants transparently dissolved in water causes<br><br>
the ink to spread irregularly on the surface of paper as shown in Figure 9 due to variations in deposition of the surfactant on the hydrophobic part, whereas for the ink of the present invention, as shown in Figure 10, when the ink is added to the surface of a recording medium, a combination of two or more surfactants which exhibit an opaque or translucent dispersed state in water in the ink when used in conjunction is actively deposited on the hydrophobic part of the recording medium surface and the internal hydrophobic part, and therefore not only the ink almost uniformly spreads without causing variations, but also penetration of the ink into the internal part of the recording medium having pores is promoted, whereby penetration of the ink is improved to improve quality of the recorded matter formed on the surface of the recording medium.<br>
If two or more surfactants constituting the ink of the present invention, which exhibit an opaque or translucent dispersed state in water, are a combination of a first surfactant insoluble in water and a second surfactant having an HLB of 10 or greater, of which the hydrophobic groups have the same structure, the effect of the present invention is satisfactorily exhibited because the surfactants are not influenced by other components in the ink, or do not influence other components in the ink.  In<br><br>
such a combination, two or more surfactants which exhibit an opaque or translucent dispersed state in water are more preferably composed of nonionic surfactants because the surfactants are not influenced by other components in the ink, or do not influence other components in the ink.<br>
It is preferable that a clear ink state obtained by removing coloring materials from the ink of the present invention including a combination of two or more surfactants which exhibit an opaque or translucent dispersed state in water, and a compound having an alkyl group and having only a hydroxyl group as a water-soluble group is not an opaque or translucent dispersed state but a transparent state. This state implies that an aggregate formed by the combination of two or more surfactants which exhibit an opaque or translucent dispersed state in water, and a compound having an alkyl group and having only a hydroxyl group as a water-soluble group is in a micromicellar state, and such a state is a micellar state very stable and robust against external factors such as temperature, and therefore the ink of the present invention not only has improved reliability and but also satisfactorily exhibits the various effects described previously.<br>
In the combination of two or more surfactants which exhibit an opaque or translucent dispersed<br><br>
state in water and a compound having an alkyl group and having only a hydroxyl group as a water-soluble group, a mixed aqueous solution adjusted to have their contents suitable for use in an ink is preferably transparent because separation or precipitation of such components is hard to occur in the ink and also it is easy to obtain the stability of the ink.<br>
According to further studies by the inventors, it was found that when the combination of two or more surfactants which exhibit an opaque or translucent dispersed state in water is a combination of a first surfactant insoluble in water and a second surfactant having an HLB of 10 or greater, of which the hydrophobic groups have the same structure, the effect of the present invention is more satisfactorily exhibited if the boundary condition of the combination of surfactants is whether the value of the HLB is 10 or not. A combination of a compound having an HLB of 10 to 13 and a compound having an HLB equal to or greater than 6 and less than 10 is especially effective.  Furthermore, use of a compound having an HLB of 10 or greater and a cloudly point of<br>
50°C or higher results in a more desirable effect. In the combination of the first surfactant<br>
insoluble in water and the second surfactant having<br>
an HLB of 10 or greater, of which the hydrophobic<br><br>
groups have the same structure, micromicelles can be suitably formed if the structure of the surfactant has an unsaturated group, and especially preferable is use of a surfactant having an acetylene bonding group.<br>
Use of a surfactant such that the hydrophilic unit of the combined surfactant is composed of a ring-opened ethylene oxide or a combination of a ring-opened ethylene oxide and a ring-opened propylene oxide is preferable in terms of easy stabilization of an ink.  Especially preferable is a surfactant having as a water-soluble group ethylene oxide having a hydroxyl group at the terminal.<br>
Moreover, the surfactant is preferably a compound satisfying the following general formula (I) •<br>
A-C=C-B  (I)<br>
(In the general formula (I), A and B are each independently selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, and groups expressed by the following general formulae (IIA) and (IIB) , XA represents CnH2n+i (n is an integer number of 1 to 10), and XB represents CmH2m+i (m is an integer number of 1 to 10) . YA and YB represent a ring-opened ethylene oxide unit and/or a ring-opened propylene oxide unit, and a and b are each independently an integer number.)<br><br><br>
Use of a compound having a structure in which A and B in the general formula (I) are identical is one of preferred forms. Also preferable is use of a compound in which n is an integer number of 5 to 7 in CnH2n+i in the general formula (I) .<br>
Then, if the compound having an alkyl group and having only a hydroxyl group as a water-soluble group has a structure expressed by the following general formula (III), the effect of the present invention is easily exhibited.<br><br>
(In the general formula (III), Ri, R2 and R3 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 16 carbon atoms.  (X), (Y) and (Z) each independently represent OH or D-OH, and D represents a ring-opened ethylene oxide and/or a ring-opened propylene oxide.)<br><br>
Furthermore, it is preferable that the compound having a structure expressed by the general formula (III) is water-soluble. It is preferable particularly in terms of reliability that in the general formula (III), (X), (Y) and (Z) are OH groups. Furthermore, it is preferable that in the general formula (III), Ri and R3 are hydrogen atoms particularly in formation of a stable aggregate.  In the combination of a combination of the first surfactant insoluble in water and the second surfactant having an HLB of 10 or greater,, in which both surfactants have the same hydrophobic group structurally, and the compound having an alkyl group and having only a hydroxyl group as a water-soluble group, the effect of the present invention is more satisfactorily exhibited if the first surfactant insoluble in water and the second surfactant having an HLB of 10 or greater, of which the hydrophobic groups have the same structure, have a hydrophobic unit different from that of the compound having an alkyl group and having only a hydroxyl group as a water-soluble group. Owing to the fact that the hydrophobic units are different and the compound has only a hydroxyl group as a hydrophilic portion, stability is improved. This is presumably because the density of hydrophilicity of the aggregate increases.  Improvement of dispersion stability of<br><br>
micromicelles is ascribable to the fact that the compound has only a hydroxyl group as a hydrophilic portion.<br>
The aqueous ink of the present invention further contains a coloring material in a dissolved or dispersed state. The dissolved or dispersed coloring material described above refers to, for example, a compound or coloring material itself dissolved or dispersed in water (e.g. dye, or pigment having a hydrophilic group), and a capsulated material including or containing a coloring material. However, a method in which a coloring material is dispersed using a resin or the like as a dispersant like pigment dispersion is not suitable.  This is because for this type of method, not only the effect of the above described mechanism is hard to be exhibited due to creation of a state in which a resin is dispersed in an ink, but it can be hardly said that this method is a preferable option with respect to reliability of the ink. Hereinbelow, every state of the coloring material in the liquid medium as described above will be referred to as "dissolution" unless otherwise specified.<br>
The coloring material to be incorporated in the ink of the present invention is preferably a disperse coloring material with a water-soluble group bonded by a chemical reaction in terms of stability of the<br><br>
ink. A coloring material without a water-soluble group chemically bound thereto, e.g., a coloring material having physically adsorbed a polymer dispersant having such a water-soluble group, is much likely to lose the group by the action of the surfactant (s) present therewith. A water-soluble coloring material may be used in the aqueous ink of the present invention, but may be less effective than the water-disperse coloring material in some circumstances.  In this case, a coloring material directly dyeing a recording medium (direct dye, etc.) or a coloring material having an azo group in the structure may be used. A coloring material having a structure having a carboxyl group or a group of a salt thereof as a hydrophilic group is preferably used. Moreover, a coloring material having only a carboxyl group or a group of a salt thereof as a hydrophilic group of the coloring material is preferably used.  Particularly, the carboxyl group has a low affinity for water compared with the sulfone group, and therefore the effective of the aqueous ink of the present invention can be satisfactorily exhibited by using a coloring material having a carboxyl group.<br>
Specifically, coloring materials include, but not limited to, for example, dis- or tris-azo coloring materials of high substantivity such as<br><br>
direct black 168 and direct black 154, coloring materials having a dimeric structure such as direct yellow 142, direct yellow 86, direct red 227 and direct red 80, metal-containing coloring materials such as direct blue 199, and coloring materials expressed by the general formulae (A) to (C) in a free acid form as shown below.<br>

The amount of the above coloring material to be used is not specifically limited, but generally preferably in the range of 0.1 to 15 % by weight, more preferably 0.1 to 10% by weight based on the total weight of ink.<br>
For the aqueous ink of the present invention, further a monohydric alcohol is preferably used in the ink in terms of stability of the ink.  The<br><br>
monohydric alcohol has an effect of mixing water and oil as in drainage of water in gasoline, for example. This indicates that use of a monohydric alcohol in the ink is preferable in terms of stability of the ink in realization of the mechanism described previously. The monohydric alcohol has a desirable effect for vaporization and penetration into the recording medium when the ink is added onto the recording medium, and therefore the monohydric alcohol is effective for exhibiting the effect of the present invention more satisfactorily. The content of monohydric alcohol in the ink of the present invention is 0.1 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 10% by weight based on the total weight of ink. Specific examples of monohydric alcohols capable of being used as an ink component of the present invention include ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and n-butanol.<br>
Moreover, a water holding agent may be used in the aqueous ink of the present invention.  For the water holding agent, a compound selected from the group consisting of urea and urea derivatives is preferably used.  Incorporation of urea and urea derivatives in the ink results in an improvement in stability of the ink.  Further, the compound selected from the group consisting of urea and urea derivatives is effective as an auxiliary solvent and<br><br>
therefore preferable for stability of the ink.<br>
If the recording medium is bond paper, for example, the effect of improving fixation of the present invention is more easily exhibited owing to moisture holding ability of the bond paper. That is, it is presumed that owing to retention of water in the recording medium, time for conformity at the interface between the ink and recording medium is shortened to improve fixation.<br>
The urea derivative is preferably a compound other than cyclic compounds, for example at least one type selected from alkyl derivatives of urea and ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide adducts of urea, or it is preferably selected as appropriate from compounds derived by means of at least two of the above derivative groups. However, the selection depends on the amount and nature of each component constituting the ink. A water-soluble compound is preferably used.  The used amount of the above water holding agent is not specifically limited but generally, its content is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 15% by weight, further preferably 0.1 to 10% by weight based on the total weight of ink.<br>
The aqueous ink of the present invention may optionally contain various kinds of additives such as a water-soluble organic solvent, a surfactant, a rust inhibitor, a preservative, an antimold agent, an<br><br>
antioxidant, an antireductant, a vaporization promoter, a chelating agent, a water-soluble polymer and a pH regulator.<br>
For the liquid medium for use in the aqueous ink of the present invention, water is preferably used as described previously, but a mixture obtained by adding a water-soluble organic solvent to water is also preferably used.  Specific examples of water-soluble organic solvents which can be used include amides such as dimethyl formamide and dimethyl acetamide; ketones such as acetone; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol; alkylene glycols with an alkylene group containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylenes glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, thiodiglycol, hexylene glycol and diethylene glycol; glycerin; lower alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol monomethyl (or ethyl) ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl (or ethyl) ether and triethylene glycol monomethyl (or ethyl) ether; cyclic amide compounds such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, triethanol amine, sulfolane,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide, 2-pyrrolidone and e-caprolactam; and imide compounds such as succinimide.<br>
The water-soluble organic solvent that is used<br><br>
preferably has a solubility parameter value greater than that of the compound having an alkyl group and having only a hydroxyl group as a water-soluble group. This improves stability including stability of a gas-liquid interface in an ink state. As such a compound, a glycol compound which is a liquid at ordinary temperatures is especially preferably used among the compounds described above. The used amount of the water-soluble organic solvent which is incorporated in the ink of the present invention is not specifically limited, but is generally preferably in the range of 0.1 to 15% by weight, more preferably 0.1 to 10% by weight based on the total weight of ink.<br>
The content of the water-soluble organic solvent described above is generally preferably 1 to 40% by weight, more preferably 3 to 30% by weight based on the total weight of ink. The content of water in the ink is in the range of 30 to 95% by weight.  If the content of water is less than 30% by weight, the dissolution or the like of the coloring material is lowered, and the viscosity of the ink increases, which is not preferable.  If the content of water is greater than 95% by weight, the amount of vaporized components is too large to achieve adequate fixation characteristics*<br>
The aqueous ink of the present invention preferably has a surface tension of 40 dyn/cm (mN/m)<br><br>
or less.  For realization of the mechanism described previously, an aqueous ink with a droplet spreading after recording is more preferable for exhibiting the effect of the present invention, for example. The pH of the ink of the present invention is preferably 8 or greater in terms of stability of the ink.<br>
The aqueous ink of the present invention preferably has a plurality of counter ion components used in conjunction as counter ions for ionic hydrophilic groups of the coloring materials listed previously.  For example, it preferably has a plurality of alkali metal ions used in conjunction, or an alkali metal ion used in conjunction with an ammonium ion. When the ink of the present invention is used in inkjet recording, the ink may be more stable and ejected more easily if both of the ions are used together. Alkali metal ions may include Li+, Na+ and K+. .<br>
The aqueous ink of the present invention configured as described above may be used as a normal ink for stationery, but is especially effective when used in inkjet recording. Unlike recording onto a recording medium with a writing pressure as is done by stationery, inkjet recording is a system in which ink droplets are shot onto the surface of a recording medium such as paper to perform recording with penetration and spread of the ink droplets themselves,<br><br>
and thus the interface state of the ink droplet significantly influences recording quality.  Inkjet recording methods include a recording method in which mechanical energy is applied to an ink to eject liquid droplets, and an inkjet recording method in which heat energy is applied to an ink to cause foaming of the ink to eject liquid droplets, but the ink of the present invention is particularly suitable for the type of inkjet recording method in which an ink is foamed by heat energy to eject the ink, wherein the ink is very stably ejected and occurrence of satellite dots is prevented.  In this case, however, thermal property values (e.g. specific heat, heat expansion coefficient, heat conductivity, etc.) of the ink may be adjusted.<br>
For improvement of matching with a head for inkjet, it is desirable that the aqueous ink of the present invention should be adjusted so that as properties of the ink itself, the surface tension at 25°C is 30 to 40 dyn/cm (mN/m) , and the viscosity is 15 cP (mPa-s) or less, preferably 10 cP (mPa-s) or less, more preferably 5 cP (mPa-s) or less.  Thus, for adjusting the ink to have the properties described above and enabling recording on plain paper, the content of water contained in the ink of the present invention should be 50 to 98% by weight, preferably 60 to 95% by weight.<br><br>
The aqueous ink of the present invention is used in a head of the inkjet eject system, and is effective either as an ink housing (recording unit, ink cartridge, etc.) in which the ink is contained, or an ink to be filled in the housing.  Particularly, the present invention provides an excellent effect in a recording head and a recording apparatus of the bubble jet (registered tradename) system among inkjet recording systems.<br>
For the typical configuration and principle of the system, a basic principle disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,723,129 specification or U.S. Patent No. 4,740,796 specification is preferably used. This system is applicable for both the so called on-demand type and continuous type, but is particularly effective for the on-demand type because in the case of the on-demand type, at least one drive signal corresponding to record information and giving a rapid increase in temperature exceeding nuclear boiling is applied to an electrothermal converter placed in relation to a sheet and a liquid flow channel holding the ink, whereby heat energy is produced in the electrothermal converter, the heat action surface of the recording head undergoes film boiling and as a result, air bubbles can be formed in the ink in response to the drive signal on a one-to-one basis. The ink is ejected through an opening for<br><br>
eject by growth and shrinkage of the air bubbles to form at least one drop.  It is more preferable that the drive signal has a pulse shape because the growth and shrinkage of air bubbles occurs immediately and appropriately, thus making it possible to achieve eject of the ink excellent in responsiveness.  For the drive signal having a pulse shape, drive signals described in U.S. Patent No. 4,463,359 specification and U.S. Patent No. 4,345,262 specification are suitable.  If conditions described in the specification of U.S. Patent No. 4,313,124 of an invention of about the rate of increase in temperature of the heat action surface are employed, more excellent recording can be performed.<br>
For the configuration of the recording head, the present invention is effective not only for the configuration of combination of an eject port, a liquid channel and an electrothermal converter (straight liquid flow channel or perpendicular liquid flow channel) disclosed in each of the specifications described above, but also for the configuration described in U.S, Patent No. 4,558,333 specification and U.S. Patent No. 4,459,600 specification disclosing a configuration in which a thermally active part is placed in a curved area, or the atmosphere communicating eject system described in Japanese Patent No. 2962880, Japanese patent No.<br><br>
32 4 694 9 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hll-188870.  In addition, the present invention is effective for a configuration in which an eject port common for a plurality of electrothermal converters is an eject part of the electrothermal converter (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. S59-123670). A full line type recording head having a length matching the width of a maximum recording medium onto which the recording apparatus can print may have either a configuration in which the length is met by a combination of a plurality of recording heads as disclosed in the specifications described above, or a configuration as one integrally formed recording head, and the present invention can further effectively exhibit the effect described above.<br>
In addition, the present invention is effective when using a replaceable chip type recording head which is attached to an apparatus main body to enable electric connection to the apparatus main body and supply of an ink from the apparatus main body, or when using a cartridge type recording head integrally provided in the recording head itself. Addition of recovery means for the recording head, auxiliary assistance means and the like which are provided as components of the applied recording apparatus is preferable because the effect of the present invention can be exhibited more stably.  Specifically,<br><br>
they are capping means for the recording head, cleaning means, pressuring or suctioning means, an electrothermal converter or other heating element or preheating means by a combination thereof, and a preliminary eject mode performing eject for a purpose other than recording.<br>

The inks of Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Examples 1 to 8 having the compositions shown in Tables 1 and 2 were each placed in Inkjet Printer BJF 800 (trade name: manufactured by Canon Inc.), alphanumeric letters were continuously printed under<br>
an environment of 15°C, and evaluations were made based on the following criteria.<br>
o: Printed letters were not disturbed, and letters could be finely printed to the last.<br>
A: Printed letters were slightly disturbed, but letters could be printed to the last.<br>
x: Printed letters were disturbed, and letters could not be printed to the last. (Evaluation of Ejection after Standing)<br>
The inks of Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Examples 1 to 8 having the compositions shown in Tables 1 and 2 were each placed in Inkjet Printer BJF 800 (trade name: manufactured by Canon Inc.), and left standing under a laboratory environment for a month, alphanumeric letters were then printed, and<br><br>
evaluations were made based on the following criteria while comparing the printed letters with letters printed before the ink was left standing.<br>
o: Printed letters were not disturbed, letters could be finely printed, and they were not inferior to letters printed before the ink was left standing.<br>
A: Printed letters were slightly disturbed compared with letters printed before the ink was left standing.<br>
x: Printed letters were significantly disturbed compared with letters printed before the ink was left standing. (Evaluation of Print Quality)<br>
The inks of Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Examples 1 to 8 having the compositions shown in Tables 1 and 2 were each placed in Inkjet Printer BJF 600 (trade name: manufactured by Canon Inc.), various kinds of patterns were printed under a laboratory environment, and evaluations were made based on the following criteria.<br>
o: The ink was not inferior to the regular ink for Inkjet Printer BJF 800 (trade name: manufactured by Canon Inc.).<br>
A: The ink slightly spread compared with the regular ink for Inkjet Printer BJF 800 (trade name: manufactured by Canon Inc.).<br>
x: The ink significantly spread compared with<br><br>
the regular ink for Inkjet Printer BJF 800 (trade name: manufactured by Canon Inc.). (Evaluation of Water Resistance)<br>
The inks of Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Examples 1 to 8 having the compositions shown in Tables 1 and 2 were each placed in Inkjet Printer BJF 600 (trade name: manufactured by Canon Inc.), various kinds of patterns were printed under a laboratory environment, and then left standing for an hour, tap water was then dashed on the printed surface, and evaluations were made on contamination of the printed surface based on the following criteria.<br>
o: The printed surface was not contaminated, but kept clear.<br>
A: The printed surface was slightly contaminated, but the printed matter could be read without any trouble.<br>
*: The printed surface was badly contaminated, and the printed matter was hard to read.<br><br><br>
Evaluation of the cloudy point in the Examples leads to determination of whether micromicelles are formed or not.  It can be understood from Table 3 that Examples 1 to 6 in which a surfactant having an HLB of 10 to 13 was combined with a surfactant having an HLB equal to or greater than 6 and less than 10<br><br>
are further preferable as described previously. (Table 4) Results of Evaluation in Comparative<br><br>
The cloudy point in the Comparative Example was not measured because the clear ink was already cloudy, and therefore no measurements were needed.<br><br>
