This application claims the priority of provisional patent applications serial<br>
numbers 60/483,353 filed on June 27, 2003, titled Adjustable Gastric Band<br>
Having An Improved Attachment Mechanism, and 60/507, 612 filed on<br>

Mechanism the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
This present invention relates generally to a surgically implantable band for<br>
encircling an anatomical passageway, and is particularly directed to an adjustable<br>
gastric band for encircling the stomach for the control of obesity. The invention<br>
will be specifically disclosed in connection with an improved attachment<br>
mechanism for an adjustable gastric band.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Since the early 1980s, adjustable gastric bands have provided an effective<br>
alternative to gastric bypass and other irreversible surgical weight loss<br>
treatments for the morbidly obese. The gastric band is wrapped around an upper<br>
portion of the patient's stomach, forming a stoma that is less than the normal<br>
interior diameter of the stomach that restricts food passing from an upper<br>
portion to a lower digestive portion of the stomach. When the stoma is of the<br>
appropriate size, food held in the upper portion of the stomach provides a feeling<br>
of fullness that discourages overeating.<br>
In addition to a latched position to set the diameter of the gastric band,<br>
adjustability of gastric bands is generally achieved with an inwardly directed<br>
inflatable balloon, similar to a blood pressure cuff, into which fluid, such as<br>
saline, is injected through a fluid injection port to achieve a desired diameter.<br>
The balloon is typically deflated or only partially inflated when first placed in the<br>
body to allow for body adjustments and healing around the new band site. Since<br>
adjustable gastric bands may remain in the patient for long periods of times, the<br>
fluid injection port is typically installed subcutaneously to avoid infection, for	<br><br>
instance in front of the sternum. Following the initial implantation, the surgeon<br>
may adjust the band by loosing or tightening depending on the patients' needs.<br>
Adjusting the amount of fluid in the adjustable gastric band is achieved by<br>
inserting a Huber tip needle through the skin into a silicone septum of the<br>
injection port. Once the needle is removed, the septum seals against the hole by<br>
virtue of compressive load generated by the septum. A flexible conduit<br>
communicates between the injection port and the adjustable gastric band.<br>
An attachment mechanism for the adjustable gastric band has to provide an<br>
initial sizing of the stoma of the stomach. One generally known attachment is to<br>
suture ends of the adjustable gastric band. Another generally known attachment<br>
includes one end of the gastric band terminating in a flexible conduit that has a<br>
flared portion that is drawn through an opening in a second end of the gastric<br>
band and then sutured to the encircling band portion - securing the band to the<br>
stomach. After the sutures are in place, the injection port is anchored at a<br>
convenient location.<br>
United States patent no. 5,938,669 discloses an adjustable gastric banding<br>
device having a band connected by a tube to a control box and a balancing<br>
reservoir implanted under a patient's skin, the box containing an electric pump<br>
and an electronic control unit capable of communicating by radio with a monitor<br>
carried by the patient and with a controller intended for the doctor. The<br><br>
controller can operate the pump by remote control to transfer determined<br>
volumes of liquid in a closed circuit from the band to the reservoir or vice versa,<br>
to adjust the diameter f a passage in the stomach.<br>
United States patent no. 5,226,429 discloses a gastric band adapted for<br>
laparoscopic placement around the stomach and a method for deploying the<br>
band. Cameras are used for observing the placement of the band. The band is<br>
secured against slippage after being placed at the desired position.<br>
European patent application publication no. 1 319 371 discloses a strip to be<br>
implanted surgically, to form a restrictive ring around the stomach, has a closure<br>
near the transit between the feed tube and the loop section. The free end of the<br>
loop section has threading length for the closure, with lateral beads at the ends,<br>
and a plug with a locking hook to fit into the eyelet of the closure.<br>
International patent application publication no. WO 2004/108025 discloses a<br>
surgical ring comprising a flexible band and a closure means which has male and<br>
female elements for connecting two ends of the band. The female element has a<br>
structural discontinuity at which the deformability of the female element is<br>
greater than the rest of the female element.<br>
European patent application publication no. 1 396 242 discloses a surgical ring<br>
comprising a flexible band and a closure means for forming a closed loop. The<br><br>
band and the closure means preferably form a single piece of the same material.<br>
While these known approaches are effective in securing the gastric band, further<br>
improvements are desires that simplify the clinical implantation procedure, that<br>
provide long-term reliability, and that facilitate readjustment or removal.<br>
While sutures have been relied on as the most positive connection in the past, it<br>
is desirable to have a secure attachment that does not require sutures yet does<br>
not require a large force to create the secure attachment. Otherwise, it may be<br>
difficult to adequately grip and perform the attachment with laparoscopic<br>
instruments. Consequently, a significant need exists for an adjustable gastric<br>
band having an improved attachment mechanism.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0008]	The present invention addresses these and other problems in the prior<br>
art, by providing an adjustable gastric band device that is engaged with<br>
less force, thereby facilitating implementation with laparoscopic<br>
instruments, yet the attachment remains secure over long term use.<br>
[0009]	A general object of this invention is to provide an adjustable gastric<br>
band which comprises material having at least one first material<br>
property and having an attachment mechanism which comprises<br>
material that has at least one second material property corresponding to<br>
but different from the first material property. The attachment<br>
mechanism may include plastically or elastically deformable material.<br>
[0010]	Another object of this invention is to provide a readily reversible<br>
adjustable gastric band which can be fastened and unfastened without<br>
reducing the holding strength of the attachment mechanism.<br>
[0011]	A still further object of this invention is to provide an attachment<br>
mechanism requiring a light force to latch and a high force to unlatch<br>
the ends.<br>

Detailed Description of Embodiments of the Invention<br>
[0037]	In the following description, like reference characters designate like or<br>
corresponding parts throughout the several views. Also, in the<br>
following description, it is to be understood that terms such as front,<br>
back, inside, outside, and the like are words of convenience and are not<br>
to be construed as limiting terms. Terminology used in this patent is<br>
not meant to be limiting insofar as devices described herein, or<br>
portions thereof, may be attached or utilized in other orientations.<br>
Referring in more detail to the drawings, the invention will now be<br>
described.<br>
[0038]	Referring to Fig. 1, an adjustable gastric band 10 is shown wrapped<br>
around an upper portion of a stomach 12, kept in place by attaching the<br>
two ends together and extending a portion 14 of the stomach 12 over<br>
the adjustable gastric band 10 by suturing portion 14 to the stomach.<br>
Referring also to Fig. 2, the adjustable gastric band 10 includes a non-<br>
extensible strap 16 and an inflatable balloon 18, made of a medical<br>
grade silicone polymer or any other suitable material, is carried by the<br>
inner surface 20 of the strap 16. The balloon 18 may be secured to the<br>
inner surface 20 in any well known manner, or even made of unitary<br>
construction with the strap 16, although the strap 16 may typically be<br>
formed of a different material.<br>
[0039]	One end of a flexible conduit 22 is in fluid communication with the<br>
internal cavity 24 of the balloon 18, with the other end being in fluid<br>
communication with an internal cavity (not shown) of a remote<br>
injection port 26. The remote injection port 26 includes a silicone<br>
septum 28. At the time the adjustable gastric band 10 is implanted<br>
around a portion of the stomach, the remote injection port 26 is also<br>
implanted at a suitable location, usually within the rectus sheaths, for<br>
transcutaneous access via a Huber needle.<br><br><br>
[0040]	As is well known, the internal cavity 24, the flexible conduit 22 and<br>
the internal cavity of the remote injection port 26 are preferably at least<br>
partially filled with a physiologically compatible fluid, such as a saline<br>
solution. Postoperative adjustment of the perimeter enclosed by the<br>
balloon 18, and therefore the size of the stoma, is accomplished by<br>
addition or removal of fluid from the interior cavity 24 of the balloon<br>
18 by inserting a Huber needle percutaneously into the silicone septum<br>
28 of the injection port 18.<br>
[0041]	As is well known in the field the adjustable gastric band 10 may be<br>
made from any suitable medically compatible material having<br>
sufficient strength necessary for a particular laparoscopic surgery or<br>
particular patient.<br>
[0042]	As mentioned above, the two ends of the adjustable gastric band 10 are<br>
attached together (the specific attachment mechanism structure is not<br>
illustrated in detail in FIG. 1).<br>
[0043]	The present invention is directed to various embodiments of<br>
attachment mechanisms, for connecting the two ends together, which<br>
comprise a material that has at least one material property which<br>
different from that of the material of which the band is primarily<br>
comprised. The general construction of adjustable gastric band 10<br>
shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 and described above is common to the<br>
embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 3-7, with the embodiments differing<br>
by the specific attachment mechanisms. It is noted that the practice of<br>
the present invention may be used with any band, and is not limited to<br>
use with an adjustable gastric band having the exact features described<br>
above or below.<br>
[0044]	Turning now to FIG. 3, the adjustable gastric band 30 includes an<br>
elongated strap 32 extending in what is referred to herein as the<br>
longitudinal direction, even though when implanted the adjustable<br><br>
gastric band 30 has an arcuate configuration. The strap 32 includes an<br>
inner surface 34 and an outer surface 36, with the balloon 38 extending<br>
inwardly from adjacent the inner surface 34. The adjustable gastric<br>
band 30 includes a first end portion 40 which overlaps a second end<br>
portion 42. The first and second end portions 40, 42 are secured<br>
together by a deformable attachment mechanism.<br>
[0045]	Referring also to FIG. 4, in the embodiment depicted, the first end<br>
portion 40 of strap 32 has a first portion of the attachment mechanism<br>
associated with it depicted as an elongated cylindrical shaft portion 44<br>
having a plurality of engagement members 46, shown as frustroconical<br>
annular flanges 46, axially spaced along the shaft portion 44, angled<br>
away from the distal end 44a. The second end portion 42 of strap 32<br>
has a second portion of the attachment mechanism associated with it<br>
depicted as a laterally extending member 48 which extends generally<br>
perpendicularly from the outer surface 36.<br>
[0046]	The member 48 is configured to receive the first end portion 40.<br>
Referring also to FIGS. 6 and 7, the laterally extending member 48 at<br>
least partially defines a cavity, also referred to as a passageway, 50<br>
which is configured to receive the first end portion 40. The member 48<br>
includes two spaced apart legs 52, 54, which extend from the outer<br>
surface 36, and define a gap 56 therebetween. Gap 56 leads to the<br>
passageway 50.<br>
[0047]	As seen in FIG. 7, the surface 50a of passageway 50 is configured to<br>
cooperate with the engagement members 46 to resist axial withdrawal<br>
of the first end portion 40 from the passageway 50. More specifically,<br>
passageway 50 includes a plurality of axially spaced, generally annular<br>
shaped retention members 58, also referred to as rings 58, whose<br>
annular shape is interrupted by gap 56. In the embodiment depicted,<br>
each retention member 58 includes a generally frustroconical surface<br><br><br>
58a and a generally transverse (to the longitudinal direction) retention<br>
surface 58b.<br>
[0048]	The passageway 50 and a portion of gap 56 is surrounded by a<br>
retention actuator 60, shown as a "U" shaped member although any<br>
suitable shape may be used, disposed completely within the member<br>
48. The actuator 60 is made of any material which may be easily<br>
plastically deformed, or crimped to the desired shape without breaking,<br>
so as to urge the retention members 58 against the shaft 44 to produce<br>
increased resistance to withdrawal, axially or laterally, of the first end<br>
portion 40. Thus, at least this one material property of the actuator 60,<br>
plastic deformability which is not preceded by significant elastic<br>
deformation, a relatively low yield point, is different from the<br>
corresponding material property of the material from which the rest of<br>
the strap 16 is made. Energy is imparted to the actuator 60 to<br>
plastically deform it, resulting in secure attachment of the first end<br>
portion 40 to the second end portion 42.<br>
[0049]	More specifically, crimping deforms the actuator 60 causing it to<br>
squeeze against the shaft 44, causing the retention members 58 to<br>
present greater resistance to axial movement of the engagement<br>
members 46 in the direction of the arrow 62. Crimping may also close<br>
the gap 56.<br>
[0050]	To attach the first end portion 40 to the second end portion 42, the<br>
shaft 44 is pushed through the passageway 50. It is possible with the<br>
embodiment illustrated to set the band 30 to more than one diameter by<br>
advancing the shaft 44 through the passageway 50 to a desired<br>
position, with the engagement members 46 meeting minimal resistance<br>
to such axial movement from the frustroconical surfaces 58a. Once in<br>
the desired position, the actuator member 60 can actuate the<br>
attachment mechanism by being crimped with a grasper or other<br>
suitable device. To detach the two ends, the closed gap 56 may be<br><br><br>
spread apart such as by spreading the opposing surfaces of the gap 56<br>
apart with a grasper.<br>
[0051]	The actuator 60 may be made of any biologically suitable material<br>
which provides the desired deformation and force when crimped, such<br>
as a plastically deformable metal. Although the actuator 60 is shown<br>
completely disposed within the second end portion 42, such as insert<br>
molded, the actuator 60 may extend beyond the exterior surface so<br>
long as it remains retained to the second end portion 42 in some<br>
manner, and the integrity of the second end portion 42 is preserved.<br>
The width of gap 56 is selected to provide sufficient clearance to lay<br>
the shaft 44 therethrough and to be closed by crimping so that<br>
deformation of the actuator 60 is not unduly limited.<br>
[0052]	Referring now to FIGS. 8 and 9, another embodiment is illustrated<br>
having a deformable attachment mechanism which is elastically<br>
deformable. The adjustable gastric band 70 includes a first end portion<br>
72 and a second end portion 74, shown attached together with the inner<br>
surfaces 76 at each end 72 and 74 abutting each other. The first end<br>
portion 72 includes a first portion of the attachment mechanism<br>
associated with it depicted as a laterally extending member 78 which<br>
extends generally perpendicularly from the inner surface 76 of end 72.<br>
The member 78 is configured to engage the second portion of the<br>
attachment mechanism associated with the second end portion 74.<br>
More specifically, the laterally extending member 78 defines a<br>
passageway 80 in conjunction with the inner surface 76 at the first end<br>
portion 72 which is configured to receive the second end portion 74.<br>
The member 78 includes two spaced apart legs 82 and 84 which extend<br>
from the inner surface 76 at the opposite edges of the strap 70, with a<br>
cross member 86 extending therebetween.<br>
[0053]	The second portion of the attachment mechanism associated with the<br>
second end portion 74 is depicted as including a retaining member 88<br><br><br>
extending laterally from the outer surface 90 thereof. The retaining<br>
member 88 includes an inclined surface 92 which may be arcuate as<br>
shown, or planar. The retaining member 88 also includes the retention<br>
surface 96 which extends generally perpendicular from the outer<br>
surface 90, and perpendicular to any relative movement between the<br>
first and second end portions 72 and 74. The retention surface 96 must<br>
extend above the upper edge of the passageway 80 a distance sufficient<br>
to provide the desired force to resist disengagement. In the<br>
embodiment depicted, the retention surface 96 extends slightly beyond<br>
the top of the cross member 86.<br>
[0054]	The retaining member 88 includes a member 98, preferably made of a<br>
dissimilar material, or at least having dissimilar resilience properties,<br>
from the rest of strap 100. In particular, in this embodiment, the<br>
elasticity of the material from which member 98 is made is different<br>
than the elasticity of the material from which the strap 100 is made,<br>
having greater elasticity so as to bias the retaining member resiliently<br>
toward the shape shown. With the configuration illustrated, the greater<br>
elasticity allows easier compression of the retaining member 88 when<br>
inserting it through the passageway 80.<br>
[0055]	In the embodiment disclosed, the member 98 is diagrammatically<br>
shown as a coil spring, disposed in a cavity 102 formed in retention<br>
member 88. The cavity 102 with the member 98 may be formed using<br>
any suitable method, such as a two step molding process, insert<br>
molding, or other known techniques. The presence of cavity 102<br>
allows retention member 88 to deflect in the lateral direction more<br>
easily than if the cavity was the same material as the rest of the band<br>
100, typically silicone. The member 98 is laterally resilient, urging the<br>
retention member 88 outwardly so as to maintain the retention surface<br>
96 in a position that requires high longitudinal force to separate the two<br>
ends. With the laterally resiliency of member 98, perpendicular to the<br><br><br>
direction of removal, and the cavity 102, only a relatively light lateral<br>
force is required to move the retention surface 96 below or nearly<br>
below the cross member 86 to a position that does not block or<br>
presents reduced resistance to withdrawal of the second end portion 74<br>
from the passageway 80.<br>
[0056]	The dissimilar material, elastically deformable element and cavity<br>
within which it is disposed may be of any suitable shape. Referring to<br>
FIG. 10, an another embodiment of a resilient member 104 is<br>
diagrammatically illustrated disposed in the cavity 106. The member<br>
104 has a "V" shape, with the wide end opening toward the retention<br>
surface 108.<br>
[0057]	Referring to FIG. 11, there is shown another embodiment of an<br>
attachment mechanism, generally indicated at 110, which includes a<br>
receiver 112 carried by the first end portion 114, and a resilient<br>
member, illustrated as a dual cantilever spring 116 carried by the<br>
second end portion 118. The receiver 112 and the spring 116 may be<br>
made of any suitable medically compatible material having sufficient<br>
strength. In the embodiment depicted, the receiver 112 and the spring<br>
116 are made of an injection moldable polymer which are insert<br>
molded into the first and second end portions 114 and 116 of the<br>
adjustable gastric band (not numbered in FIG. 11), which is made of<br>
silicon. The material properties of the material from which the<br>
receiver 112 and the spring 116 different from the material properties<br>
of the material from which the strap is made. In particular in this<br>
embodiment as illustrated, the material is stiffer, more rigid and harder<br>
than the material (ejg., silicone) of the strap.<br>
[0058]	Referring also to FIG. 11A. the receiver 112 includes two pairs of<br>
spaced apart side walls 120, 122, 124 and 126 which defines a cavity,<br>
also referred to as a pocket, 120 that is configured to receive the two<br>
spaced apart legs 130 and 132 of the spring 116. The side walls 122<br><br><br>
and 124 include two openings 134 and 136 which are configured to<br>
receive the ends 138 and 140 of the legs 122 and 124. Each end 138<br>
and 140 include a respective step 142 and 144 which is dimensioned to<br>
respectively engage the side 146 and 148 of the respective opening<br>
134 and 136 to resist withdrawal from the pocket 128, as described<br>
below.<br>
[0059]	The spring 116 includes steps 150 and 152 extending outwardly from a<br>
respective leg 138 and 140. The second end portion 118 is molded<br>
about a portion of the spring 116 retaining it thereto, with the legs 138<br>
and 140 extending from the end 154. There are recessed surfaces 156<br>
and 158, which may include surface texturing or protuberances as<br>
illustrated, generally aligned with the steps 150 and 152, providing a<br>
location to grasp the second end portion 118 to squeeze the ends 138<br>
and 140 toward each other.<br>
[0060]	Referring also to FIG. 12, to connect the attachment mechanism 110<br>
together, the legs 130 and 132 are inserted into the pocket 128. The<br>
ends 138 and 140 includes ramps 160 and 162 which engage corners<br>
164 and 166 upon insertion, compressing the legs 130 and 132 toward<br>
each other as the legs are advanced into the pocket 128. The material<br>
and construction of the spring 116 provides resiliency to the two legs<br>
138 and 140. The ends 138 and 140 are advanced into the pocket 128<br>
until they can move outwardly to snap into the openings 134 and 136<br>
and hold the two end portions 114 and 118 together with end 154<br>
generally abutting end 168.<br>
[0061]	As depicted, the openings 134 and 136 extend completely through the<br>
spaced apart side walls 122 and 124, respectively, of the receiver 112<br>
and the steps 142 and 144 do not extend outside of the openings. The<br>
openings 134 and 136 are depicted as being covered by the silicon<br>
material of the end portion 114. Once attached as show, the receiver<br><br><br>
112 and spring 116 are not exposed, enclosed within the band shroud,<br>
posing no erosion threat to the surrounding tissue.<br>
[0062J	To detach the first end portion 114 from the second end portion 118,<br>
the recessed surfaces 156 and 158 are squeezed inwardly, causing the<br>
legs 130 and 132 to move inwardly until the ends 138 and 140<br>
withdraw from the openings 134 and 136, and the spring 116 can be<br>
withdrawn from the receiver 112. The recessed surfaces 156 and 158<br>
may be squeezed by use of a grasper.<br>
[0063]	Referring to FIGS. 13-15, there is shown yet another embodiment of<br>
an attachment mechanism, indicated generally at 170 which includes a<br>
first end portion 172 and a second end portion 174 made of the same<br>
material as the rest of the band, such as silicon. The first end portion<br>
172 includes a conically shaped retention member 176, more<br>
specifically illustrated as a frustroconical shape, disposed adjacent an<br>
annular groove 178 separating a first cylindrical portion 180 and the<br>
base 182 of retention member 176. A second cylindrical portion 184<br>
extends between the first cylindrical portion and the retention member<br>
176. Extending from the opposite end of retention member 176 is<br>
another cylindrical portion 186.<br>
[0064]	The second end portion 174 defines an internal, generally cylindrical<br>
cavity 188, also referred to as an opening, which is shaped<br>
complementarity to and configured to receive the first end portion 172,<br>
as depicted having an inner diameter slightly larger than the outer<br>
diameter of the first cylindrical portion 180 by an amount sufficient to<br>
allow the first end portion 172 to be inserted into the cavity 188 in the<br>
manner described below. Second end portion 174 includes two spaced<br>
apart transverse slot openings 190 and 192 in communication with the<br>
internal cavity 188, disposed on opposite sides of the second end<br>
portion 174.<br><br><br>
[0065]	A resilient member 196, depicted as a generally U shaped spring clip<br>
having two legs 198 and 200 extending from a base 202, generally<br>
parallel to each other in the free state. The spring clip 196 may be<br>
made of any suitable medically compatible material providing the<br>
necessary resilience and strength. One or more material properties of<br>
the material from which the spring clip 196 is formed is different than<br>
the corresponding one or more material properties of the material from<br>
which the strap is made. In the depicted embodiment, the spring clip<br>
196 has more hardness, rigidity, stiffness, resiliency and elasticity than<br>
the strap.<br>
[0066]	The spring clip 196 is carried by the second end portion 174 with the<br>
legs 198 and 200 disposed partially in the openings 190 and 192,<br>
respectively. The end portions of the legs 198a and 200a extend<br>
beyond the openings 190 and 192, and terminate in curved portions.<br>
The base 202 is molded into the second end portion 174, leaving the<br>
legs 198 and 200 free to be spread outwardly to allow retention<br>
member 176 to pass between the legs 198 and 200.<br>
[0067]	In the free state, the distance between the legs 198 and 200 is sufficient<br>
to permit the leading end 176a of retention member 176 to pass<br>
therebetween. Preferably, the diameter of end 176a is smaller than the<br>
corresponding distance between the legs 198 and 200. To connect the<br>
attachment mechanism 170 together, the first end portion 172 is<br>
inserted into the cavity 188. The inclined shape of the retention<br>
member 176 spreads the legs 198 and 200 apart as the first end portion<br>
172 is advanced into the cavity 188, until the openings 190 and 192 are<br>
aligned with groove 178, whereat the legs 198 and 200 move into the<br>
groove 178, preferably being resiliently urged against the cylindrical<br>
portion 184 as seen in FIG. 15, but at least move to a position<br>
sufficient to retain the first end portion 172 within the cavity 188<br>
adjacent the base 182 of retention member 176.<br><br><br>
[0068J	To detach the first end portion 172 from the second end portion, the<br>
legs 198 and 200 are pulled apart far enough to allow the base 182 to<br>
pass therebetween. This may be accomplished by use of a grasper.<br>
[0069]	Referring generally to FIGS. 16-23, and in particular to FIG. 16 and<br>
FIGS. 21-23, there is shown another embodiment of an attachment<br>
mechanism, indicated generally at 204, of an adjustable gastric band<br>
254, which includes a first end portion 206 and a second end portion<br>
174. FIG. 16 illustrates the attachment mechanism 204, without the<br>
band, in an exploded perspective view. The first end portion 206<br>
carries the insert assembly 210 and the second end portion 208 carries<br>
the housing assembly 212. The insert assembly 210 and housing<br>
assembly 212 may be attached to the first and second end portions 206<br>
and 208, in any suitable manner. In the depicted embodiment, insert<br>
assembly 210 and housing assembly 212 have been molded into the<br>
end portions 206 and 206 respectively, aligned longitudinally with the<br>
band 254. It is noted that the insert assembly 210 and housing<br>
assembly 212 could alternatively be oriented lateral or transverse to the<br>
band 254.<br>
[0070]	In the depicted embodiment, the insert assembly 210 includes the<br>
insert 214, a cap 216 and a retainer 218. The insert 214 is rotatably<br>
connected to the cap 216 by retainer 218. As depicted, the insert 214<br>
includes a hole 220 which is configured to receive part of the retainer<br>
218, which is illustrated as a threaded pin, although any suitable<br>
retainer or retaining structure may be used. The cap 216 also includes<br>
a hole 222 through which the threaded shaft portion 218a of retainer<br>
218 extends to engage with the internal threads of hole 220. The cap<br>
216 may include a counterbore or other recess (not shown) in its<br>
surface disposed adjacent the upper end 214a of the insert 214. Such a<br>
recess may be shaped complementarily to the adjacent portion of insert<br>
214 so as to receive a portion of insert 214 while still allowing<br><br><br>
sufficient rotation of insert 214. Any configuration which allows an<br>
insert to be carried suitably freely rotating by the first end portion 206<br>
may be used.<br>
[0071]	The insert 214 includes three legs 224, each of which includes a<br>
radially extending portion 224a and an axially extending portion 224b.<br>
Although three spaced legs 224 are depicted, there may be one or more<br>
spaced apart legs. In the embodiment depicted, legs 224 are equally<br>
circumferentially spaced, having 120° angles between them. Although<br>
the axially extending portions 224b are continuous and aligned with<br>
the radially extending portions 224a, the function of the legs 224 can<br>
be achieved without being continuous and aligned.<br>
[0072]	In the depicted embodiment, the housing assembly 212 includes the<br>
housing 226, the resistor 228, biasing member 230, depicted as an<br>
elastically deformable coil spring, and end cap 232. Referring also to<br>
FIG. 17, the housing 226 defines an internal cavity, also referred to as<br>
a bore, 234. The first portion 234a, also referred to as the entrance<br>
portion, of bore 234, starting at the upper end 226a of housing 226, has<br>
a nominal diameter which is complementary to the nominal outer<br>
diameter (not including the legs 224) of the insert 214. A plurality of<br>
longitudinal slots 236 are formed extending outwardly from the inner<br>
surface 234b of the entrance portion 234a. The slots 236 are<br>
configured to receive the legs 224, the number and spacing of slots 236<br>
matching the number and spacing of the legs 224. The width<br>
(circumferentially) and the depth (beyond the inner surface 234b) of<br>
the slots 236 are sized to provide clearance for the legs 224 to slide<br>
axially therethrough with no or little axial force required. As will be<br>
described, since the insert 214 rotates within the housing 226 to<br>
connect and disconnect (actuate and deactuate) the attachment<br>
mechanism 204, it is preferable that the legs 224 and the slots 236 be<br>
equally and uniformly spaced, circumferentially/angularly.<br><br><br>
[0073]	The bore 234 includes a second portion 234c. The second portion<br>
234c has a diameter provides diametrical clearance for the legs 224 so<br>
that the insert 214 may freely rotate within the housing 226 once the<br>
legs 224 have cleared the slots 236, as will be described below. In the<br>
depicted embodiment, the diameter of the second portion 234c is<br>
substantially the same as the depth of the slots 236, with the inner<br>
surface 234d being continuous with the bottoms 236a of slots 236.<br>
[0074]	The entrance portion 234 defines a plurality of arcuate ramps 238 and<br>
240 which extend outwardly relative to the inner surface 234b a<br>
distance that provides diametrical clearance for the legs 224. The ramp<br>
238 extends between the lower end of the longitudinally extending side<br>
236b to the upper end of the longitudinally extending stop surface 242.<br>
The ramp 240 extends between the lower end of the stop surface 242 to<br>
the lower end of the longitudinally extending side 236c. In the<br>
depicted embodiment, the inner surface 234d extends to the ramps 238<br>
and 240.<br>
[0075]	A plurality of longitudinal slots 244 are formed extending outwardly<br>
from the inner surface 234d from the lower end of second portion<br>
234c. The slots 244 are configured to receive the legs 228a of the<br>
resistor 228, providing enough clearance for the legs 228a to slide<br>
axially slide axially therealong with no or little axial force required,<br>
until stopped by the ends 244a. The number and spacing of slots 244<br>
match the number and spacing of the legs 228. In the depicted<br>
embodiment, the grooves 244 and the legs 228 are equally and<br>
uniformly spaced, circumferentially/angularly, although any number<br>
and orientation which provide the desired function may be used.<br>
[0076]	Referring also to FIG. 18, the inner surface 234d is shaped<br>
complementarily to the outer surface 228b of the resistor 228 which is<br>
disposed in the bore 234. In the depicted embodiment, the surface<br>
228b is cylindrical and has a diameter which is smaller than the<br><br><br>
diameter of the inner surface 234d by an amount sufficient to allow the<br>
resistor 228 to slide axially therein with no or little axial force<br>
required. To retain the resistor 228 within the housing 226, the end<br>
cap 232 is secured to the lower end 226b, with biasing member 230<br>
disposed between the lower end of the resistor 228 and the upper end<br>
of the cap 232, urging the resistor 228 toward the entrance end 234a.<br>
The cap 232 and the lower end 226b may be connected together in any<br>
suitable manner, such as threads.<br>
[0077]	The resistor 228 includes a plurality of inclined ramps 246 and<br>
declined ramps 248 (in the clockwise direction when viewed from the<br>
top) which intersect at radially oriented peaks 250 and valleys 252.<br>
The ramps 246 and 248, and the axially extending portion 224b are<br>
configured to cooperate together to bias the insert 214 rotationally as<br>
the insert 214 is urged against the resistor 228 during actuation and<br>
deactuation of the attachment mechanism 204. In the depicted<br>
embodiment, the axially extending portions 224b each include a lower<br>
surface 224c which terminates in a radially oriented edge 224d which<br>
is configured to engage the ramps 246 and 248 of the resistor 228. As<br>
will be appreciated, the configurations of the ramps 246 and 248, the<br>
axially extending portions 224b, the surfaces 224c and the edges 224d<br>
must be complementary to each other at the smaller circumferential<br>
distances approaching the center of the end of the insert 214, to avoid<br>
interference. Other configurations may be used which achieve the<br>
same functionality of these features. For example, the axially<br>
extending portions 224b may extend only axially, aligned with the rest<br>
of legs 224, not radially inward beyond the circumference of the insert<br>
214.<br>
[0078]	FIGS. 18-20 illustrate various positions of the insert 214 during<br>
actuation and deactuation of the attachment mechanism 204. It is<br>
noted that in FIGS. 18-20, the curvature of ramps 238' is opposite that<br><br><br>
of the curvature illustrated in FIG. 17. The shapes of the ramps and the<br>
legs may be any suitable shapes which cooperate together to achieve<br>
the indexed rotation of the insert 214 as described below.<br>
[0079]	In FIG. 18, the insert 214 is illustrated disposed at least partially in the<br>
bore 234 of the housing 216, with each leg 224 being disposed within a<br>
respective slot 236. When the legs 224 are so located, each edge 224d<br>
of the axially extending portions 224b is disposed to engage respective<br>
declined ramps 248. When the insert 214 is advanced axially into the<br>
bore, the declined surfaces of the ramps 248 bias the edges 224d<br>
rotationally, but rotation is initially prevented by stop 236b, until the<br>
insert 214 has been advanced far enough into the bore 234 for the<br>
upper edges 224e to clear the lower ends 238a' of the sides 236b/lower<br>
end of the ramps 238'. The resistor 228 moves axially within bore 134<br>
as the insert 214 advances, but does not rotate.<br>
[0080]	Once the upper edges 224e have cleared the lower ends 238a', and the<br>
insert 214 can rotate, the declined surfaces of the ramps 248 cause the<br>
insert to rotate until the lower edges 224d reach the valleys 252, which<br>
are the terminuses of the declined surfaces 248-the portions of the<br>
declined surfaces 248 at which rotation of the insert ceases. At this<br>
location, the upper edges 224e have rotated past the lower ends 238a',<br>
and underlie the ramps 238'.<br>
[0081]	When the axial force on insert 214 is then released, the upwardly<br>
biased resistor 228 urges the insert 214 upwardly, through the contact<br>
of edges 224d with the inclined ramps 246, urging the upper edges<br>
224e into engagement with the ramps 238'. It is noted that the upper<br>
edges 224e may be the only part of the radially extending portion 224a<br>
that contacts the surfaces 238', as illustrated in FIG. 18, or the surfaces<br>
224f may be configured to engage the ramps 238' in addition to<br>
engagement by the edges 224e, as illustrated in FIGS. 19 and 20, or to<br>
engage the ramps 238' instead of the upper edges 224e.<br><br><br>
[0082]	FIG. 19 illustrates the engagement of the upper edges 224e and<br>
surfaces 224f with the ramps 238', which exert an advancing<br>
(clockwise in the illustration) rotational bias on the insert 214.<br>
Concomitant with the upward biasing by the resistor 228, the inclined<br>
ramps 246 resist the advancing rotation of the insert 214. However,<br>
the advancing rotational bias imparted by ramp 238' is sufficient to<br>
overcome the resisting rotational bias imparted by the inclined ramps<br>
246, and the insert 214 advances rotationally until rotation is stopped<br>
by stop surface 242, as illustrated in FIG 20, and the insert is retained<br>
in the bore 234 and the attachment mechanism 204 is actuated,<br>
securing the ends of the band together.<br>
[0083]	As seen in FIG. 20, the lower edges 224d have advanced beyond the<br>
peaks 250. To separate the ends of the band, the attachment<br>
mechanism 204 is deactuated by depressing the insert 214, i.e.,<br>
advancing the insert into the bore 234, urging the lower edges 224d<br>
against the declined ramp 248. As with the actuation process, the<br>
declined ramps 248 bias the edges 224 rotationally, but in this case<br>
rotation is initially prevented by the stop surface 242, until the insert<br>
214 has been advanced far enough into the bore 234 for the upper<br>
edges 224e to clear the lower ends 242a of the stop surface 242.<br>
[0084]	Once the upper edges 224e have cleared the lower ends 242a, and the<br>
insert 214 can rotate, the declined surfaces of the ramps 248 cause the<br>
insert to rotate until the lower edges 224d reach the valleys 252. At<br>
this location, the upper edges 224e have rotated past the lower ends<br>
242a, and underlie the ramps 240'.<br>
[0085]	When the axial force on insert 214 is then released, the upwardly<br>
biased resistor 228 urges the insert 214 upwardly, through the contact<br>
of edges 224d with the inclined ramps 246, urging the upper edges<br>
224e into engagement with the ramps 240'. As mentioned above in<br>
reference to surfaces 238, the upper edges 224e may be the only part<br><br><br>
of the radially extending portion 224a that contacts the surfaces 240'.<br>
or the surfaces 224f may be configured to engage the ramps 240' in<br>
addition to engagement by the edges 224e or to engage the ramps 238'<br>
instead of the upper edges 224e.<br>
[0086]	The engagement of the upper edges 224e and surfaces 224f with the<br>
ramps 240' exert an advancing rotational bias on the insert 214, with<br>
the inclined ramps 246 resisting the advancing rotation of the insert<br>
214. The advancing rotational bias imparted by ramp 240' is sufficient<br>
to overcome the resisting rotational bias imparted by the inclined<br>
ramps 246, and the insert 214 advances rotationally into the slots 236,<br>
allowing the insert 214 to be withdrawn.<br>
[0087]	Referring to FIGS. 21-23, the attachment mechanism 204 is illustrated<br>
being actuated. FIG. 21 illustrates the first and second end portions<br>
206 and 206 prior to actuation, generally aligned and proximal to each<br>
other. There are arrows 206a and 208a shown on the cap 216 and the<br>
housing 226 in these figures to illustrate the rotation of the insert 214<br>
during actuation, and may be, but not necessarily, included in the<br>
actual device to allow visualization of the relative orientation and of<br>
rotation of the insert 214 during actuation. The legs 224 are aligned<br>
with the slots 236 so that the insert 214 may be inserted into the bore<br>
234. FIG. 22 illustrates the insert 214 advanced into the bore 236, a<br>
position at which the resistor 228 has moved axially. The insert 214 is<br>
caused to rotate as it is inserted far enough, and upon release of the<br>
axial force, is retained in the housing 226 as shown in FIG. 23, with<br>
the arrows 206a and 208a aligned. Deactuation is accomplished by<br>
advancing the insert 214 axially so it rotates, and then withdrawing it<br>
from the bore 234.<br>
[0088]	The components of the attachment mechanism 204 may made of any<br>
medically compatible materials, such as but not limited to metal,<br>
plastic or a combination thereof. In the embodiment depicted, the<br><br><br>
attachment mechanism 204 is made of different material(s) than the<br>
band. The material properties of the material(s) from which the insert<br>
assembly 210 and the housing assembly 212 are made are different<br>
from the material properties of the material from which the strap is<br>
made. Generally, the components are stiffer, more rigid and harder.<br>
The biasing member 230 has greater elasticity and resiliency.<br>
[0089]	Referring to FIGS 24-26, there is shown another embodiment of an<br>
attachment mechanism, indicated generally at 256, of an adjustable<br>
gastric band 258, which includes a first portion of the attachment<br>
mechanism associated with the first end portion 260 and a first portion<br>
of the attachment mechanism associated with the second end portion<br>
262. The first end portion 260, also referred to as a tongue portion,<br>
may be formed of the same material as the band 258, and is depicted as<br>
generally having the same width and thickness as the band 258.<br>
[0090]	In the embodiment depicted, the second portion 262 includes a<br>
proximal section 264, which is proximal to the band 258, an<br>
intermediate section 266, and a distal section 268. The edges 270 of<br>
the proximal section 264 are roughened or textured in order to resist<br>
unintended separation of the attachment mechanism 256, as described<br>
below. The edges 270 are depicted as including a plurality of laterally<br>
oriented ridges along the length of the proximal section 264. The<br>
edges 270 may be roughened or textured along their entire lengths, as<br>
depicted, but are not required to be. The inner surface 272 of the<br>
proximal section 264 is depicted as textured, but it may alternatively<br>
not be textured.<br>
[0091]	The intermediate section 266 includes a textured surface 274 which is<br>
configured to resist, and preferably prevent, relative longitudinal<br>
movement between the first end portion 260 and the second end<br>
portion 262 when the attachment mechanism 256 is actuated, as<br>
described below. A pair of outwardly opening recesses 276, also<br><br><br>
referred to as release slots, may be formed in the intermediate section<br>
266 adjacent the proximal section 264. The recesses 276 may<br>
alternatively characterized as being be disposed adjacent the<br>
intermediate section 266 and the proximal section 264, as disposed<br>
between the intermediate and proximal sections, as disposed in the<br>
proximal section 264 adjacent the intermediate section 266, or as<br>
disposed in both the proximal and intermediate sections. It is the<br>
location of the recess 276 relative to the latches (described below)<br>
which is relevant to the operation of the attachment mechanism 256.<br>
not such characterization.<br>
[0092]	The distal section 268 is pivotable relative to the intermediate section<br>
266 through the hinge 278. Depending on the material, the hinge 278<br>
may be an elastomeric hinge or a plastic living hinge.<br>
[0093]	The distal end 280 of the distal section 268 includes two spaced apart<br>
latches 282 extending laterally from the edges of the distal end 280.<br>
As depicted, the latches 282 define respective upright members having<br>
inwardly facing surfaces 282a which are preferably spaced apart a<br>
distance less than the distance between the edges 270. The distal end<br>
280 may be tapered, the width of distal end 280 decreasing along its<br>
length, or have a smaller width along its length in comparison to the<br>
width between the edges 270, such that the inner surfaces 282a engage<br>
the edges 270. The width of the first end portion 260, adjacent the<br>
latches 282 when the attachment mechanism 256 is attached, the width<br>
between the edges 270 and the width between surfaces 282a are<br>
configured to allow the surfaces 282a to engage the edges 270.<br>
[0094]	The latches 282 defined inwardly extending surfaces 282b which<br>
overlie the inner surface 284 of the distal end 280. The longitudinal<br>
widths of the latches 282, and the transverse distance between the inner<br>
surfaces 282c of the latches 282 allow the latches 282 to pass through<br>
the recesses 276 without significant resistance, as described below.<br><br><br>
[0095]	Referring to FIG. 25, the inner surface 260a of the first end portion 260<br>
is disposed adjacent the proximal section 264 and the intermediate<br>
section 266, with the distal end 260b adjacent the hinge 278. The<br>
distal section 268 is pivoted about the hinge 278 to capture the first end<br>
portion 260 between the distal section 268 and the proximal and<br>
intermediate sections 264 and 268. The distal section 268 exerts a<br>
clamping force against the first end portion to urge the inner surface<br>
260a proximal to the distal end 260b against the textured surface 274<br>
between the first end portion 260 and the second end portion 262,<br>
which may result at least in part due to the dimensions of the hinge<br>
278. The inclined surfaces 282d of the latches 282 act to spread the<br>
latches 282 apart allowing the latches 282 to be pushed downwardly<br>
past the first end portion 260 and the proximal section 264, until the<br>
inner surfaces 282c have cleared the edges 270, allowing the inwardly<br>
facing surfaces 282a to engage edges 270 and the inwardly extending<br>
surfaces 282b to abut or at least face the outer transverse surfaces<br>
264a, in the latched position as shown in FIG. 25.<br>
[0096]	FIG. 26 illustrates the attachment mechanism in an intermediate stage<br>
of being disconnected. To deactuate or disconnect the attachment<br>
mechanism 256, the distal end is moved longitudinally relative to the<br>
proximal section 264 and intermediate section 266, until the latches<br>
282 are aligned with the recesses 276, allowing the distal ends of the<br>
latches 282 to be moved laterally into the recesses 276 allowing the<br>
proximal and intermediate sections 264 and 266 to pivot relative to the<br>
distal section 268, thereby reducing the clamping force against the first<br>
end portion 260. Once the clamping force has been reduced, the first<br>
end portion may be separated from the second end portion 262.<br>
[0097]	The outer surfaces of the band 258 include pull tabs 286 and 288<br>
which may be grasped using a grasper or other suitable instrument to<br>
effect the movement of the distal end 280.<br><br><br>
[0098]	As mentioned above, the first end portion 260 may be made of the<br>
same material as the band 258, which is typically silicon. The distal<br>
end 280 may be made of any material having sufficiently rigid and<br>
elastic material properties to provide the necessary resiliency to the<br>
latches 282 and to produce the necessary clamping load to retain the<br>
first end portion 260, such as a hard plastic material, and thus is made<br>
of a material which is different from the rest of the band 258. The<br>
entire second end portion 262 may be, but is not necessarily made from<br>
a rigid material. Alternatively, any sections up to the distal end 280, or<br>
possibly even up to the latches 282, may be made of the same material<br>
or a material with similar properties as the material of the rest of the<br>
band 258. For example, all of distal section 268 may be made of a<br>
rigid material. The hinge 278 may be an elastomeric hinge or a plastic<br>
living hinge. Another possibility is for the intermediate section 266 to<br>
be made of a rigid material.<br>
[0099]	It is noted that the material of components of the above described<br>
attachment mechanisms may be made of any suitable material or<br>
materials having the one or more material properties necessary to<br>
perform the function of that component. If the functional<br>
requirement(s) of the component allow, the component may be made<br>
of the same material as the strap portion of the band (or of course made<br>
be made of a completely different material). For example, it may be<br>
possible to make an attachment mechanism component of siliconc<br>
having a higher Durometer than the strap made of silicone. In such<br>
example, the Shore A Durometer of the silicone strap may be 50 ± 5,<br>
with the component of the attachment mechanism having a Shore A<br>
Durometer of at least about 10 higher than the strap.<br>
[00100]	It will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the above<br>
invention has equally applicability to other types of implantable bands.<br>
For example, bands are used for the treatment of fecal incontinence.<br><br><br>
One such band is described in U.S. Patent 6,461,292 which is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Bands can also be used to treat<br>
urinary incontinence. One such band is described in U.S. Patent<br>
Application 2003/0105385 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Bands can also be used to treat heartburn and/or acid reflux.<br>
One such band is described in U.S. Patent 6,470,892 which is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Bands can also be used to treat<br>
impotence. One such band is described in U.S. Patent Application<br>
2003/0114729 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00101]	Thus, as used herein and in the claims, an implantable band is a band<br>
which may be implanted in a position to occlude flow, such as food or<br>
body fluids, through an anatomical passageway, such as a stomach or<br>
lumen.<br>
[00102]	In summary, numerous benefits have been described which result from<br>
employing the concepts of the invention. The foregoing description of<br>
one or more embodiments of the invention has been presented for<br>
