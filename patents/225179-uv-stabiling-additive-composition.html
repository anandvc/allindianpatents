This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119(e) of United States<br>
Provisional Application Serial No. 60/343,681, filed December 27, 2001.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved UV stabilizing additive composition. More<br>
specifically, this invention relates to an UV stabilizing additive composition comprising an<br>
ortho-hydroxy triazine compound, a hindered hydroxybenzoate compound and optionally a<br>
hindered amine compound.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Exposure to sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation is known to cause<br>
degradation of a wide variety of materials, especially polymeric materials. For example,<br>
polymeric materials such as plastics often discolor, lose gloss and/or become brittle as a result<br>
of prolonged exposure to UV light due primarily to a reduction in the molecular weight of the<br>
polymer. Accordingly, a large body of art has been developed directed towards materials such<br>
as UV light absorbers and stabilizers, which are capable of inhibiting such degradation in<br>
polymeric articles.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,670,491 discloses the use of a C12 to C20alkyl esters of 3,5-<br>
tertbutyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid to stabilize a titanium dioxide pigmented olefin composition.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,240, 977 discloses the use of a 3,5-disubstituted tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzate<br>
with a triazine based hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) in a pigmented polyolefin<br>
composition. U.S. Pat. No. 3,206,431 discloses the use of alkyl esters of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxybenzoic acid as light stabilizers for polyolefins in combination with a hindered phenol<br>
antioxidant. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,681,431 and 3,285,855 disclose the use of n-octadecyl 3,5-di-<br>
tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoate as an antioxidant for polyolefins. British Pat. No. 1,336,931<br>
teaches the use of aryl esters of 3,5-di-tert-butyt-4-hydroxybenzoic acid as light stabilizers<br>
for polyolefins in combination with a benzophenone and a peroxide decomposer. U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 3,502,613 teaches a synergistic combination of an aryl ester of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxybenzoic acid, a chlorobenzotriazole, a phenolic antioxidant, and a thiodipropionate<br>
ester as a light stabilizer for polypropylene. U.S. Pat. No. 4,237,042 discloses a light<br>
stabilizer composition for polyolefins comprising n-hexadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyI-4-<br>
hydroxybenzoate and a dialkyl pentaerythrityl diphosphite.<br>
None of the above documents disclose the use of a hindered hydroxybenzoate<br>

and detailed descriptions above, the examples provide further understanding of the present<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Examples 1 to 3. Gloss retention. Delta E. Delta Yt and Breaking Strength in a<br>
polypropylene homopolymer composition<br>
The UV additives of Examples 1 to 3 were mixed by using a dry blending<br>
technique. In addition to the additives, an antioxidant package containing 0.05% by weight<br>
Cyanoxยฎ 1741 (1,3,5-tris-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)-s-triazine-<br>
2,4,6(1 H,3H,5H)trione) from Cytec Industries Inc. 0.05% by weight Doverphosยฎ 9228<br>
(bis(2,4-dicumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite) from Dover Chemical Corporation and<br>
0.05% by weight calcium stearate were also mixed with the UV additives. These additives<br>
were compounded with a polypropylene homopolymer from Basell (PH350) and extruded<br>
using conventional single-screw extrusion parameters. After extrusion, standard 2 x 2 x<br>
0.125 inch plaques were injection molded using an Arburg injection molder.<br>
The performance criteria of Gloss retention. Delta E, Delta Yl and Breaking<br>
Strength were measured at set exposure intervals (2000 and 3125 hours) using<br>
accelerated exposure in a xenon weather-ometer under ASTM-G-155 testing conditions.<br>
Prior to gloss and color measurements, the samples were washed with Dl water and<br>
wiped.<br>
Gloss retention was conducted under ASTM Test Procedure D523 with a 60ยฐ<br>
angle.<br>
Yellow Index (Yl) and Delta E data was obtained using a Macbeth Color Eye<br>
Colorimeter using ASTM D2244-79 with 1" view and D65/100 observer. Delta Yl and Delta<br>
E is the difference between samples measured before and after the weather-ometer<br>
testing. Lower Delta E and Delta Yl means less color and less yellow index change<br>
respectively indicating better performance.<br>
For breaking strength, 3 tensile bars per each data point were tested on an Instron<br>
Engineering Company Tensile Tester (Model TTB). The average tensile breaking strength<br>
of the three test samples were measured and normalized to samples that were not UV<br>
exposed to give a % breaking strength. The cross-head speed of the tensile tester was 1<br>
inch (0.254 cm.) per minute.<br>
The results are shown in Tables 1 to 4 below.<br>
The results demonstrate that additive compositions containing a triazine UV.<br>
absorber with the hindered hydroxybenzoate perform better than compositions containing<br>
the hindered hydroxybenzoate alone.<br>
Examples 4 to 8. Gloss retention and Delta E in a plqmented TPO composition<br>
The UV additives of Examples 4 to 8 were mixed by using a-dry blending<br>
technique. In addition to the additives, an antioxidant package containing 0.05% by weight<br>
Cyanoxยฎ 1741 (1,3,5-tris-(3,5-di-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)-s-triazine-<br>
2,4,6(1 H,3H,5H)trione) from Cytec Industries Inc. 0.05% by weight Doverphosยฎ 9228<br>
(bis(2,4-dicumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite) from Dover Chemical Corporation and<br>
0.05% by weight calcium stearate were also mixed with the UV additives. These additives<br>
were compounded with reactor grade TPO polymer from Equistar (MF 1.3, Flex Modulus<br>
25,200 psi) and a gray pigment using a 4% let down ratio via conventional single-screw<br>
extrusion parameters. After extrusion, standard 2 x 2 x 0.125 inch plaques were injection<br>
molded using an Arburg injection molder. The total amount of UV stabilizer package for<br>
each sample was approximately 0.2 wt%, based on the total weight of the sample.<br>
The performance criteria of gloss retention were measured at set exposure<br>
intervals (2500, 3750 and 5000 kj) using accelerated exposure in a xenon weather-ometer<br>
under SAEJ1885 interior automotive testing conditions. Prior to gloss measurement, the<br>
samples were washed with DI water and wiped. The results are shown in table 5 below:<br>
(The 2500 kj interval samples were not washed and wiped and thus were not included in<br>
the results).<br>
The results in Table 5 demonstrate that a TPO composition eohtaning a mindereal<br>
hydroxybenzoate, hindered amine and triazine UV absorber, (Example 8), provides better<br>
gloss retention than the individual components or combination of components.<br>
Color change, (Delta E), were also measured for Examples 4 to 8 and are shown<br>
below in Table 6. Delta E measurements were obtained using the same procedure in<br>
Examples 1 to 3 above.<br>
The results show that the hindered hydroxybenzoate/HALS composition (Example<br>
7) had comparable Delta E performance to the composition containing a hindered<br>
hydroxybenzoate, hindered amine and triazine UV absorber (Example 8). It was<br>
speculated that the pigment in Example 7 was blocking or absorbing some of the UV<br>
radiation. This theory was tested in Examples 9 to 11 discussed below.<br>
Examples 9 to 11. Percent Gloss retention and Delta E change in a non-plgmented<br>
TPO system.<br>
Examples 7 and 8 were tested in a non-pigmented system along with a 0.2 wt%<br>
composition of Tinuvinยฎ 791. Tinuvin 791 is an UV additive package used in the TPO<br>
industry. The samples were prepared similar to Examples 4 to 8 except that a pigment<br>
was not used in the samples and Tinuvin 791 had its own proprietary anti-oxidant<br>
package. The results for gloss retention and Delta E are shown in Tables 7 and 8 below.<br>
The results in Tables 7 and 8 demonstrate the superior performance of the<br>
composition containing the hindered hydroxybenzoate, hindered amine and triazine UV<br>
absorber in a non-pigmented TPO system.<br>
Example 12. Comparison of UV absorbers<br>
A composition containing a benzotriazole UV absorber (Tinuvinยฎ 328), a HALS<br>
(Chimassorbยฎ 119) and a hindered hydroxybenzoate is compared to Example 8 with<br>
respect to gloss retention and Delta E. Example 12 was prepared according to the<br>
procedure of Examples 4 to 8 above except it had its own proprietary anti-oxidant<br>
package.<br>
The results show that the composition containing the triazine UV absorber was<br>
superior over the composition containing the benzotriazole UV absorber.<br>
Examples 13 to 19. Comparison to commercial TPO W stapllizers<br>
The following Examples illustrate that a TPO composition containing a hindered<br>
hydroxybenzoate, hindered amine and triazine UV absorber performs better than<br>
commercial TPO additives. The procedure of Examples 4 to 8 was used to make the<br>
following examples with the exception that the TPO was produced by Basell (Grade AH<br>
387 Bumper grade resin), the samples contained 5% talc and were washed with 01 water<br>
and wiped prior to measurement at all intervals. Examples 17 to 19 had their own<br>
proprietary anti-oxidant package. The composition percentages are approximations.<br>
The results demonstrate that the compositions'coniaining-tne rineeree<br>
hydroxybenzoate, hindered amine and triazine UV absorber in Examples 13 to 16 perform<br>
better than compositions containing commercial TPO additives.<br>
