				<td>Rubber powders (compounds) and process for the production<br>
The present invention relates to rubber powders which also<br>
contain, in addition to the rubber components, further<br>
constituents important for the production of the<br>
vulcanisable rubber mixture.<br>
If, in addition to the constituents of the basic batch,<br>
the rubber powder also contains crosslinking chemicals<br>
(accelerator, sulfur), it is known as a full compound. If<br>
the rubber powder in particular consists of the<br>
constituents of the basic batch, it is known as a semi-<br>
compound. Intermediate forms between these stages are also<br>
suitable.<br>
Numerous documents have been published relating to the aim<br>
and purpose of using rubber powders (powdered rubbers) and<br>
relating to processes for the production thereof.<br>
The interest in pulverulent rubbers is explained by the<br>
processing methods used in the rubber industry, where<br>
rubber mixtures are produced with a considerable input of<br>
time, energy and labour. The main reason for this is that<br>
the raw material, crude rubber, is in the form of bales.<br>
The bale is comminuted and intimately mixed over several<br>
processing stages with fillers, mineral oil plasticisers<br>
and vulcanisation auxiliaries in roll mills or internal<br>
mixers. The mixture is generally stored between the stages.<br>
Extruder/pelletisers or extruder/roller dies are generally<br>
arranged downstream from the internal mixers or roll mills.<br>
The only way forward from this highly complex method of<br>
rubber processing is to develop an entirely new processing<br>
technology.<br>
The use of pourable rubber powders has thus been discussed<br>
for some time as this approach makes it possible to process<br>
rubbers mixtures simply and rapidly in the same way as<br>
powdered thermoplastics.<br>
DE-PS 2822 148 discloses a process for the production of a<br>
pulverulent rubber containing filler.<br>
According to the said patent, an aqueous filler emulsion is<br>
added to a rubber latex, rubber solution or the aqueous<br>
emulsion of a rubber and the desired rubber powder is<br>
precipitated.<br>
In order to avoid the grain size dependent filler contents<br>
obtained from this process, variants have been filed under<br>
numbers DE-PS 3723 213 and DE-PS 3723 214 and are part of<br>
the prior art.<br>
According to DE-PS 3723 213, in a two-stage process, a<br>
quantity of &gt;50% of the filler is initially incorporated<br>
into the particles of rubber powder. In the second stage,<br>
the remainder of the filler is applied onto the so-called<br>
basic rubber grain.<br>
This may be considered a variant of dusting, as no bond is<br>
created between the filler and rubber.<br>
However, as E.T. Italiaander has pointed out (presentation<br>
151, technical conference of the Rubber Division of the<br>
ACS, Anaheim, California, 6-9 May 1997 (GAK 6/1997 (50)<br>
456-464)), despite the bright future predicted in the<br>
Delphi Report (Delphi Report, "Kiinftige Herstellverfahren<br>
in der Gummiindustrie", Rubber Journal, volume 154, no. 11,<br>
20-34 (1972)) for pulverulent and pelletised rubbers and<br>
numerous attempts made by well-known polymer manufacturers<br>
from the mid 1970"s until the early 1980"s to produce<br>
pulverulent NBR, SBR/carbon black masterbatches and<br>
pelletised NR, the rubber bale remains the standard form in<br>
which polymers are supplied.<br>
One disadvantage of known processes is firstly that a<br>
grinding operation is necessary in order to achieve a grain<br>
diameter of the filler particles of 10 Âµm, which is<br>
considered essential to the quality of the final product.<br>
However, this requires not only elevated energy input but<br>
also results in damage to the filler structure which,<br>
together with the active surface area, is a significant<br>
parameter for its efficacy in rubber applications.<br>
Secondly, the handling properties of prior art products<br>
suffer in that the particles stick together during storage.<br>
The object of the invention is accordingly to provide a<br>
pulverulent rubber containing filler which is easily<br>
processed, together with a process for the production<br>
thereof.<br>
The present invention provides a finely divided rubber<br>
powder (powdered rubber), which<br>
a)   contains a rubber matrix and additionally<br>
b)   one or more white and/or black fillers known from the<br>
rubber industry optionally modified with one or more of<br>
the organosilicon compounds of the formulae (I), (II)<br>
or (III),<br>
c)   one of more of the additions known for the production<br>
of rubber vulcanisates.<br>
All or part of the filler(s) may be used in premodified<br>
form or may have been modified during the present process.<br>
Depending upon the extent of processing (nature of the<br>
added mixture components), the product may be designated a<br>
semi-compound or full compound.<br>
The rubber powder in particular contains the organosilicon<br>
compounds in a form which has reacted with the filler if a<br>
silicate filler, in particular a precipitated silica, is<br>
used.<br>
The grain size range of the rubber powders according to the<br>
invention is generally between 0.05 and 10 mm, in<br>
particular between 0.5 and 2 mm.<br>
The powders according to the invention exhibit a narrower<br>
size distribution which is shifted towards smaller particle<br>
sizes than is known from the prior art (Kautschuk + Gummi<br>
+ Kunststoffe ,7, 28 (1975) 397-402).<br>
This fact facilitates processing of the powders.<br>
Moreover, due to the production process, the filler content<br>
of the individual particles is not determined by grain<br>
size.<br>
The pulverulent rubbers contain from 20 to 250 phr, in<br>
particular from 50 to 100 phr (phr: parts per hundred parts<br>
of rubber) , of filler, part or all of which has optionally<br>
been surface modified before the process according to the<br>
invention using the organosilicon compounds of the formulae<br>
(I), (II) or (III) known in the rubber sector.<br>
The following, individually or as mixtures, have proved to<br>
be suitable types of rubber:<br>
natural rubber, emulsion SBR having a styrene fraction of<br>
10 to 50%, butyl/acrylonitrile rubber.<br>
Butyl rubbers, terpolymers prepared from ethylene,<br>
propylene (EPM) and unconjugated dienes (EPDM), butadiene<br>
rubbers, SBR, produced using the solution polymerisation<br>
process, having styrene contents of 10 to 25%, as well as<br>
1,2-vinyl constituent contents of 20 to 55% and isoprene<br>
rubbers, in particular 3,4-polyisoprene.<br>
In addition to the stated rubbers, the following elastomers<br>
may be considered, individually or as mixtures:<br>
carboxyl rubbers, epoxy rubbers, trans-polypentenamer,<br>
halogenated butyl rubbers, rubbers prepared from 2-<br>
chlorobutadiene, ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers,<br>
epichlorohydrins, optionally also chemically modified<br>
natural rubber, such as for example epoxidised grades.<br>
Fillers which are generally used are the carbon blacks<br>
known from rubber processing and white fillers of a<br>
synthetic nature, such as for example precipitated silicas<br>
or natural fillers, such as for example siliceous chalk,<br>
clays etc. are additionally used.<br>
Carbon blacks, as are generally used in rubber processing,<br>
are particularly suitable.<br>
Such carbon blacks include furnace blacks, gas blacks and<br>
lamp backs having an iodine absorption value of 5 to<br>
1000 mVg, a CTAB value of 15 to 600 m2/g, a DBP adsorption<br>
of 30 to 400 ml/100 g and a 24 M4 DBP value of 50 to<br>
370 ml/100 g in a quantity of 5 to 250 parts, in particular<br>
of 20 to 150 parts, per 100 parts of rubber, in particular<br>
of 40 to 100 parts.<br>
Silicate fillers of synthetic or natural origin known from<br>
the rubber sector, in particular precipitated silicas, are<br>
also suitable.<br>
These generally have an N2 surface area, determined using<br>
the known BET method, of 35 to 700 m2/g, a CTAB surface<br>
area of 30 to 500 m2/g, a DBP value of 150 to 400 ml/100 g.<br>
The product according to the invention contains these<br>
silicas in a quantity of 5 to 250 parts, in particular of<br>
20 to 100 parts, relative to 100 parts of rubber.<br>
If the fillers comprise white natural fillers, such as<br>
clays or siliceous chalks having an N2 surface area of 2 to<br>
35 m2/g, these are used in a quantity of 5 to 350 parts,<br>
relative to 100 parts of rubber.<br>
Powders containing one or more of the above-stated fillers<br>
in the mixture are also suitable.<br>
Apart from the unmodified fillers of the stated type,<br>
modified fillers are optionally additionally used in the<br>
production of the rubber powders claimed in the present<br>
document.<br>
The proportion of unmodified fillers depends upon the<br>
specific mixture to be produced.<br>
In any event, the total quantity of filler amounts to 20 to<br>
250 phr.<br>
100%, in particular of 30 to 100%, preferably of 60 to 100%<br>
of this quantity consists of the unmodified fillers: silica<br>
and/or carbon black.<br>
Surface modification is generally performed using<br>
organosilicon compounds of the general formulae<br>

or<br>
R1n (R0)3-n Si- (Alkenyl)                                                          (III)<br>
in which<br>

unsaturated hydrocarbon residue having 1 to 2 0<br>
carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms,<br>

Modified fillers which are used according to the invention<br>
are described, for example, in EP-B 0442 143, EP-B 0177 674<br>
and, in particular in pellet form, in EP-A 0795 579 (white<br>
fillers) or in EP-B 0519 188 (carbon black).<br>
Bis(alkoxysilylalkyl)oligosulfanes of the bis(trialkoxy-<br>
silylpropyl)tetrasulfane and -disulfane types have in<br>
particular proved suitable for premodification or for<br>
addition to the filler suspension.<br>
The modified fillers known from the stated applications or<br>
patents or the organosilicon compounds stated therein are<br>
explicitly included in the present application as a<br>
constituent of the claimed compositions.<br>
Apart from the above-stated fillers, the rubber powders<br>
according to the invention in particular contain known<br>
processing or vulcanisation auxiliaries such as zinc oxide,<br>
zinc stearate, stearic acid, polyalcohols, polyamines,<br>
resins, waxes, plasticising oils, anti-ageing agents to<br>
counter the action of heat, light or oxygen and ozone,<br>
reinforcing resins, flame retardants, such as for example<br>
A1(OH)3 and Mg(OH)2, pigments, various crosslinking<br>
chemicals and accelerators and optionally sulfur in<br>
concentrations conventional in rubber processing,<br>
preferably sulfur modified by combination with surface<br>
active substances, as is commercially available.<br>
Grain size is determined from the filler suspension.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the process<br>
according to the invention, all the solids used are present<br>
in a grain size of 
rubber particles are precipitated from the suspension.<br>
Agglomeration may optionally occur as a result of the<br>
production process, but this has no negative influence on<br>
processing behaviour.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the<br>
production of finely divided rubber powders containing<br>
filler by precipitation from mixtures containing water,<br>
which mixtures contain finely divided filler(s) (carbon<br>
black and/or silicate filler) optionally modified with<br>
organosilicon compounds, water-soluble salts of a metal of<br>
groups IIa, IIb, IIIa and VIII of the periodic system of<br>
elements and a rubber latex or the aqueous emulsion of a<br>
rubber solution, optionally in the presence of an organic<br>
solvent, which process is characterised in that<br>
a)   =50 wt.%, but less than 100 wt.%, of the intended<br>
quantity of finely divided filler, preferably in the<br>
form of an aqueous suspension containing 2 to 15 wt.%<br>
of water, optionally with a of the (sic) quantity<br>
intended for modification of the filler surface of one<br>
or more organosilicon compounds according to the<br>
formulae (I), (II) or (III) in a quantity of 0.1 to 20<br>
wt.%, relative to the filler, in particular if the<br>
filler is a silicate filler, preferably precipitated<br>
silica, and/or =50 wt.%, but less than 100 wt.%, of a<br>
filler at least partially surface modified with one or<br>
more of the organosilicon compounds (formulae (I), (II)<br>
or III) (sic), in particular in the presence of an<br>
emulsifier, are mixed with a rubber latex or an aqueous<br>
emulsion of a rubber solution and the pH value of the<br>
mixture is reduced to a value in the range from 7.5 to<br>
6.5, in particular by addition of a Lewis acid (first<br>
stage),<br>
b)   the remaining proportion (splitting proportion) of the<br>
above-stated finely divided fillers, optionally<br>
together with the residual quantity intended for<br>
modification of the filler surface of organosilicon<br>
compounds of the formulae (I), (II) or (III), is added<br>
in the form of a suspension, the pH value is reduced to<br>
a value in the range from 
in particular by addition of a Lewis acid, such that<br>
the rubber present in the mixture completely<br>
precipitates together with the filler (second stage),<br>
c)   the precipitated solids are separated using measures<br>
known per se,<br>
d)   are optionally washed and<br>
e)   dried.<br>
The organosilicon compounds are in particular used when<br>
silicate fillers, preferably silicas, are used.<br>
The precipitation process is generally performed at room<br>
temperature, in particular at 20 to 80 Â°C.<br>
The quantities of filler and rubber are adjusted depending<br>
upon the application in accordance with the desired filler<br>
content of the resultant rubber.<br>
At a total content of =80 parts of filler phr, 1 to 10 wt.%<br>
of the filler is/are added as the remaining proportion in<br>
the second stage.<br>
The resultant particles do not stick together, even under<br>
pressure, such as when several sacks are stacked.<br>
This "inertisation" of the surface should not be confused<br>
with the known technique of dusting tacky powders with<br>
fillers. These only superficially adhering fillers are<br>
rapidly detached when exposed to mechanical stress, for<br>
example in conveying plant or on transfer into silos.<br>
The sticking and agglomeration of the finely divided<br>
powders, which it is the intention to avoid, then occurs<br>
despite the dusting.<br>
Unlike the tacky particles superficially coated with<br>
fillers as flow auxiliaries as are known from the prior<br>
art, according to the invention, filler particles are<br>
incorporated into the surface during the precipitation<br>
process for the production of the pulverulent rubber.<br>
Depending upon the filler loading with one or more of the<br>
above-stated fillers, the advisable distribution between<br>
the interior of the particles and an outer zone associated<br>
therewith is established.<br>
In a product having an elevated filler loading (&gt;80 parts<br>
of filler per hundred parts of rubber), only 1 to 10 parts<br>
of this quantity of filler are incorporated in the outer<br>
grain zone.<br>
However, if the pulverulent rubber contains a total of 
parts of filler per hundred parts of rubber, 10 to 20 parts<br>
thereof are preferably incorporated in the outer grain zone<br>
(peripheral zone), i.e. do not merely adhere by less<br>
effective adhesive forces.<br>
The distributions of the filler within the particles and in<br>
the so-called peripheral zone generally vary between these<br>
contents.<br>
The greater is the total filler content, the less is the<br>
need to suppress the tackiness of the powder by an<br>
increased concentration of filler in the peripheral zone.<br>
According to the invention, these proportions of the filler<br>
are not applied externally onto the individual rubber<br>
particles (c.f. DE-PS 37 23213), but are instead<br>
incorporated into the rubber surface.<br>
This distribution of the filler and the manner in which the<br>
fillers are bonded to the rubber composition bring about<br>
the elevated flowability of the powders according to the<br>
invention and prevent sticking during storage of the<br>
powder, without these properties being lost on exposure to<br>
mechanical stresses during conveying, transfer into silos<br>
etc .<br>
The above-stated carbon blacks are used as fillers in<br>
finely divided (fluffy) form, the carbon blacks generally<br>
having an average grain diameter of 1 to 9 Âµm, preferably<br>
of 1 to 8 Âµm, before they are suspended.<br>
This facilitates dispersion, such that aqueous suspensions<br>
containing filler particles of an average particle diameter<br>
of distinctly less than 10 Âµm are obtained without elevated<br>
energy input.<br>
Precipitated silica may advantageously be used in the form<br>
of a filter cake which has been washed until salt-free.<br>
Metal salts which may be considered are those originating<br>
from elements of groups IIa, IIb, IIIa and VIII of the<br>
periodic system of elements. This division into groups<br>
corresponds to the former IUPAC recommendation<br>
(Periodisches System der Elemente, Verlag Chemie, Weinheim,<br>
1985).<br>
Typical representatives are magnesium chloride, zinc<br>
sulfate, aluminium chloride, aluminium sulfate, iron<br>
chloride, iron sulfate, cobalt nitrate and nickel sulfate,<br>
wherein the salts of aluminium are preferred. Aluminium<br>
sulfate is particularly preferred.<br>
The salts are used in a quantity of 0.1 to 6.5 parts by<br>
weight, preferably in the form of an aqueous solution, per<br>
100 parts by weight of rubber. Acids suitable for<br>
establishing the defined pH values are primarily mineral<br>
acids, such as for example sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid<br>
and hydrochloric acid, wherein sulfuric acid is<br>
particularly preferred. However, carboxylic acids, such as<br>
for example formic and acetic acid, may also be used.<br>
The quantity of acid is determined by the nature and<br>
quantity of the water-soluble metal salt, the filler, the<br>
rubber and the optionally present alkali metal silicate.<br>
This quantity may readily be determined by initial<br>
investigatory testing.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the process<br>
according to the invention, up to 5 parts by weight per 100<br>
parts by weight of rubber of silica (SiO2) are additionally<br>
used in the form of an alkali metal silicate solution,<br>
preferably as water glass having an Na2O:SiO2 molar ratio<br>
of 2:1 to 1:4. The alkali metal silicate solution may here<br>
be added both to the rubber component and to the filler<br>
suspension. It is preferably added to the rubber component,<br>
especially when the process is performed continuously.<br>
The process according to the invention is generally<br>
performed as follows:<br>
first of all, a filler suspension is produced by dispersing<br>
a proportion, preferably &gt;50%, of the filler present in the<br>
final product, which filler is optionally in part surface<br>
modified with compounds according to the formulae (I), (II)<br>
or (III), in water together with the metal salt and<br>
optionally the alkali metal silicate solution. The overall<br>
quantity of water is determined by the nature of the filler<br>
and the degree of digestion. In general, the water-<br>
insoluble constituents of the filler amount to approx.<br>
6 wt.%. This value is not a binding restriction and both<br>
lower and higher quantities may be encountered. The maximum<br>
content is limited by the pumpability of the suspension.<br>
The filler suspension produced in this manner is then<br>
intimately mixed with the rubber latex optionally<br>
containing alkali metal silicate solution or the aqueous<br>
emulsion of a rubber solution optionally containing alkali<br>
metal silicate solution. Known stirrers, such as for<br>
example propeller stirrers, are suitable for this purpose.<br>
After mixing, a pH value in the range from 7.5 to 6.5 is<br>
established in the first stage using an acid while stirring<br>
is continued. This results in basic rubber grains having a<br>
homogeneous filler content. The size of these basic grains<br>
is controlled by the selected quantity of metal salt in the<br>
range from 0.1 to 6.5 phr. Control is effected by the<br>
largest grain size being obtained with the lowest quantity<br>
of metal salt.<br>
The solids content of the latex used generally amounts to<br>
20 to 25 wt.%. The solids content of the rubber solutions<br>
is generally 3 to 35 wt.%, that of the rubber emulsions<br>
generally from 5 to 30 wt.%.<br>
The process according to the invention may be performed<br>
both discontinuously and continuously.<br>
The precipitated rubber powder is advantageously separated<br>
by means of a centrifuge and then dried to a residual water<br>
content of generally 
drier.<br>
During the production process according to the invention,<br>
in addition to the preferably used known emulsifiers, such<br>
as for example fatty alcohol polyethylene glycol ethers, in<br>
a preferred embodiment further processing and optionally<br>
vulcanisation auxiliaries are generally added to the<br>
suspension in a quantity as is conventional for<br>
vulcanisable rubber mixtures or also in a smaller quantity.<br>
Such auxiliaries comprise known<br>
a)   activators, such as for example stearic acid,<br>
b)   antioxidants<br>
c)   processing auxiliaries such as resins and/or waxes,<br>
which are generally added in quantities of 0.5 to 10 wt.%,<br>
relative to the rubber content, directly to the filler<br>
suspension or with the latex emulsion/solution.<br>
Vulcanisation accelerators are further important additions.<br>
These are in particular selected from among the classes of<br>
sulfenamides, mercapto and sulfide accelerators, as well as<br>
thiurams, thiocarbamates and amines, and are generally<br>
added in a quantity of 0.1 to 8 wt.%, relative to the<br>
rubber content, directly to the filler suspension or with<br>
the latex emulsion/solution in finely divided form or in a<br>
known oil compatible with the rubber.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the rubber powder containing the<br>
above-stated constituents is mixed with the accelerator<br>
substances or these are sprayed, for example dissolved in<br>
an oil, onto the rubber powder.<br>
The sulfur necessary for vulcanisation, in particular in a<br>
finely divided (5 to 45 Âµm) modification combined with<br>
surface-active substances, is optionally mixed into the<br>
suspension or rubber powder in a quantity of 0.2 to 8 wt.%,<br>
relative to the rubber content.<br>
Nonionic, cationic or anionic surfactants are optionally<br>
also added as surface-active substances, especially when<br>
organosilicon compounds are added to the filler suspension.<br>
The use of finely divided solid compounds is particularly<br>
suitable. The grain size range of the above-stated<br>
substances is generally below 50 Âµm, in particular 10 Âµm.<br>
This facilitates the best possible distribution in the<br>
rubber powders according to the invention which are<br>
obtained using the process described in the present<br>
document.<br>
Incorporating generally known zinc salts, in particular<br>
zinc oxide, in a quantity of 0.5 to 8 wt.%, relative to the<br>
rubber content, is also of particular significance to<br>
subsequent use.<br>
A zinc oxide having a specific surface area of between 2 0<br>
and 50 m2/g is preferably used. This property is associated<br>
with the above-stated grain size range of 
particular of 
However, if all or some of the available additions have a<br>
grain size range greater than this, it is possible<br>
according to the prior art to pass the aqueous suspensions<br>
obtained before addition of the rubber content through<br>
known, suitable grinding units.<br>
Suspensions are then obtained having solids contents of the<br>
desired particle size distribution.<br>
In one particular embodiment, the suspension from which the<br>
rubber powder according to the invention is precipitated<br>
additionally contains a plasticising oil known as a<br>
processing auxiliary in the rubber industry.<br>
The purpose of this oil is, inter alia, to improve the<br>
processing characteristics of the plasticised crude mixture<br>
(injection behaviour, extrusion behaviour) and it is added<br>
either with the rubber latex/emulsion/solution or<br>
separately to the suspension.<br>
The rubber powders according to the invention are used for<br>
the production of vulcanisable rubber mixtures.<br>
The constituents necessary for producing the mixture are<br>
all preferably present in the rubber powder.<br>
They may, however, also additionally be mixed with other<br>
conventional rubbers, vulcanisation auxiliaries and<br>
fillers, if this is necessary for the properties of the<br>
desired vulcanisate.<br>
It is possible according to the invention directly to<br>
produce finely divided rubber powders containing optionally<br>
modified fillers and further constituents necessary for<br>
vulcanisation, which powders are free-flowing and also<br>
remain free-flowing after exposure to mechanical stresses<br>
(for example conveying, packaging).<br>
By virtue of the finely divided nature thereof, no grinding<br>
or other comminution measures are required to obtain finely<br>
divided products.<br>
The resultant finely divided rubber powders (semi-compounds<br>
and full compounds) are readily processable and give rise<br>
to vulcanisates having improved properties.<br>
Production Examples<br>
Example I<br>
Production of a semi-compound in powder form based on E-<br>
SBR, N234 and additions<br>
A stable dispersion is produced by stirring together 5.6 kg<br>
of N234, 1 kg of active ZnO, 2.2 kg of oil, 96 g of<br>
Marlipal 1618/25, 0.2 kg each of stearic acid, 6PPD and<br>
TMQ, 0.6 kg of Rhenosin C 90 in 134.4 L of water. The<br>
dispersion is mixed together with 95.69 kg of a 20.9% E-SBR<br>
latex emulsion with vigorous stirring. The pH value of the<br>
complete mixture is reduced to 6.5 by addition of an<br>
approx. 10% Al2(SO4)3 solution, so initiating precipitation.<br>
At this pH value, another stable dispersion prepared from 4<br>
kg of N234 and 96.0 L of completely deionised water is<br>
added and the pH value is then reduced to 6.0 by addition<br>
of further Al2(SO4)3. After the precipitation process, the<br>
great majority of the water is separated mechanically and a<br>
drying stage then reduces the residual moisture content to<br>
E-SBR and 48 parts of N234 and all added substances.(H-EPB<br>
I)<br>
Example II<br>
Production of a full compound in powder form based on E-<br>
SBR, N234 and additions<br>
A stable dispersion is produced by initially stirring<br>
together 5.6 kg of N234, 1 kg of active ZnO, 96 g of<br>
Marlipal 1618/25, 0.32 kg of sulfur and 0.04 kg of MBTS in<br>
126.6 L of completely deionised water. An oil solution is<br>
also produced from 2.2 kg of oil with 0.2 kg each of<br>
stearic acid, 6PPD and TMQ, 0.6 kg of Rhenosin C90, 0.32 kg<br>
of TBBS and heated to 75 Â°C. The oil solution is mixed<br>
together with 95.69 kg of a 20.9% E-SBR latex emulsion with<br>
vigorous stirring. The above-stated stable dispersion is<br>
then added to the latex/oil mixture. The pH value of the<br>
mixture is then reduced to 6.5 by addition of an approx.<br>
10% Al2(SO4)3 solution (beginning of precipitation). At this<br>
pH value, precipitation is interrupted and another stable<br>
dispersion prepared from 4 kg of N234 and 96.0 L of<br>
completely deionised water is added to the reaction<br>
mixture. After this process step, the pH value is further<br>
reduced to 5.5 by addition of further quantities of<br>
Al2(SO4)3. After the precipitation process, the great<br>
majority of the water is separated mechanically and a<br>
drying stage then reduces the residual moisture content to<br>
E-SBR and 48 parts of N234 and all added substances. (F-EPB<br>

Example III<br>
Production of a semi-compound in powder form based on E-<br>
SBR, silica and additions<br>

of Ultrasil 7000, 0.98 kg of Si 69, 0.6 kg of active ZnO,<br>
120 g of Marlipal 1618/25 in 108 L of completely deionised<br>
water. An oil solution is also produced from 5 kg of oil,<br>
0.2 kg of stearic acid, 0.3 kg of 6PPD, 0.2 kg of Protector<br>
G 35 and heated to 75 Â°C. The oil solution is mixed<br>
together with 95.69 kg of a 20.9% E-SBR latex emulsion with<br>
vigorous stirring. The above-stated stable dispersion is<br>
then added to the latex/oil mixture. The pH value is<br>
reduced to 7 by addition of an approx. 10% Al2(SO4)3<br>
solution. Once the pH value has been reduced to 7, another<br>
stable dispersion prepared from 3 kg of Ultrasil 7000,<br>
240 g of Si 69, 40 g of Marlipal and 27 L of completely<br>
deionised water is added. Once the dispersion has been<br>
added, the pH value is further reduced to 5.5 by means of<br>
Al2(SO4)3. After the precipitation process, the great<br>
majority of the water is separated mechanically and a<br>
drying stage then reduces the residual moisture content to<br>
E-SBR and 75 parts of Ultrasil 7000 and all added<br>
substances. (H-EPB III)<br>

together with 95.69 kg of a 20.9% E-SBR latex emulsion with<br>
vigorous stirring. The above-stated stable dispersion is<br>
then added to the latex/oil mixture. The pH value is<br>
reduced to 7 by addition of an approx. 10% Al2(SO4)3<br>
solution. Once the pH value has been reduced to 7, another<br>
stable dispersion prepared from 3 kg of Ultrasil 7000,<br>
240 g of Si 69, 40 g of Marlipal and 27 L of completely<br>
deionised water is added. Once the dispersion has been<br>
added, the pH value is further reduced to 5.5 by means of<br>

is mixed together with 47.85 kg each of a 20.9% NR and a<br>
20.9% E-SBR latex emulsion with vigorous stirring. The<br>
above-stated stable dispersion is then added to the<br>

0.1 to 20 wt.%, relative to the filler, and/or &gt;50<br>
wt.%, but less than 100 wt.%, of a filler at lease<br>
partially surface modified with one or more of the<br>
organosilicon compounds (formulae (I), (II) or<br>
(III) (sic), in particular in the presence of an<br>
emulsifier, are mixed with a rubber latex or an.<br>
aqueous emulsion of a rubber solution and the pH<br>
value of the mixture is reduced to a value in the range from 7.5 to<br>
6.5, in particular by addition of a Lewis acid (first stage).<br>
b)       the remaining proportion (splitting proportion) of<br>
the above-stated finely divided fillers, optionally together with the<br>
residual quantity intended for modification of the filler surface of<br>
organosilieon compounds of the formulae (I), II or (III), is added<br>
in the form of a suspension, the pH value is reduced to a value in<br>
the range from 
present in the mixture completely precipitates together with the<br>
filler (second stage),<br>

of a total content of = 80 parts of filler phr, 1 to 10 parts of this<br>
quantity is/are added as the remaining proportion in the second<br>
stage.<br>
6.      Process as claimed in claim 5, wherein<br>
of a total content of =. 80 parts of filler phr, 10 to 20 parts of this<br>
quantity are added as the remaining proportion in the second stage.<br>
7.      Process as claimed in one or more of the preceding claims, wherein<br>
a carbon black having an average particle size of 1 to 9 ~um is used.<br>
8.      Process as claimed in one or more of the preceding claims, wherein<br>
the white filler (precipitated silica) is used at least in part in the form<br>
of a filter cake which has been washed until salt-free.<br>
9.      Process or more of the preceding claims,<br>
before precipitating the rubber powder, further of the conventional<br>
processing and/or vulcanization auxiliaries, a) to i), as stated in claim<br>
2, are added to the suspension/emulsion, providing that the particle<br>
size of the added solid constituents is = 50 mm.<br>
Preferably 
10.    Process claim 9,<br>
the filler suspension containing one or more of the stated processing<br>
and/or vulcanization auxiliaries is passed through a grinder before<br>
addition of the rubber components.<br>
11.    Process claim 9,<br>
zinc oxide having a surface area of between 20 and 50 m2/g is<br>
premixed with the filler suspension and added in the first stage.<br>
12.    Process one or more of the preceding claims,<br>
one or more of the constituents a) to i) from claim 2 is/are premixed<br>
with the latex emulsion or rubber solution or the filler suspension<br>
and then the latex emulsion or rubber solution produced in this<br>
manner is mixed in the first stage with the filler suspension produced<br>
in this manner.<br>
13.    Process one or more of the preceding claim,<br>
the vulcanisation accelerator (s) is/are mixed with the rubber<br>
powder containing the above-stated additions (a to g) or is/are<br>
sprayed, in suspended or dissolved form in an oil compatible with<br>
the rubber, onto the rubber powder.<br>
14.    Process claim 13,<br>
sulfur is additionally used with the vulcanisation accelerator.<br>
15.    Use of the pulverulent rubber powders containing filler according to<br>
claims 1 to 7 for the production of vulcanisable rubber mixtures.<br>
This invention relates to finely divided, pulverulent<br>
rubbers containing filler which contain further processing<br>
and vulcanisation auxiliaries necessary for the production<br>
of vulcanisable rubber mixtures, which rubbers are pourable<br>
even after exposure to mechanical stress, and to a process<br>
for the production thereof, in which the rubber powder is<br>
obtained within two precipitation steps, and to the use of<br>
these powders for the production of vulcanisable rubber<br>
mixtures.<br>
The fillers used, which comprise not only precipitated<br>
silicas but also carbon blacks known in the rubber sector,<br>
are optionally surface modified with organosilicon<br>
compounds, especially with regard to the silicas.</td>
