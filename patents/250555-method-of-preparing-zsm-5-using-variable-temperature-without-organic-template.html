				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to preparation methods of ZSM-5 using variable<br>
temperatures without organic templates. More specifically, the present invention is<br>
directed to a method of preparing ZSM-5, characterized in that a reaction mixture for use<br>
in preparation of ZSM-5 is subjected to a two-step process, that is, nucleation at<br>
relatively high temperatures and then crystallization at relatively low temperatures,<br>
without the use of an organic template and a crystallization seed, thus easily controlling<br>
a crystal size and a particle size distribution with uniform particle size distribution and<br>
achieving substantial 100% crystallinity. In particular, upon the nucleation, the<br>
reaction time is adjusted to freely control both the crystal size and the particle size<br>
distribution.<br>
Background Art<br>
Since ZSM-5 having high silica content has been developed for the first time<br>
by Mobil Co. in the early 1970s, intensive research on such a material has been<br>
performed, due to its unique catalytic activity and shape selectivity resulting from the<br>
characteritics of ZSM-5 as a molecular sieve.<br>
Unlike conventional alumino-silicate zeolites, ZSM-5 is generally prepared<br>
using various types of organic materials as a templating agent. Among organic<br>
materials known to be effective for templating ZSM-5 structure,<br>
tetrapropylammonium cation has been known the most effective. In practice,<br>
commercial ZSM-5, currently available, has been synthesized using such a<br>
tetrapropylammonium cation. However, although tetrapropylammonium has<br>
excellent template effects, research into the preparation of ZSM-5 without the use of<br>
such an organic template has been conducted. As a result, some preparation<br>
processes were developed.<br>
The reason why the organic template is not used in the synthesis of ZSM-5 is<br>
expensive and very toxic, which can contaminate the environments. When ZSM-5 is<br>
synthesized using the organic template, secondary costs for treating a toxic organic<br>
material contained in unreactants are required. Also, the dangers of environmental<br>
contamination become very high.<br>
In addition, ZSM-5 prepared by use of the above organic material should be<br>
subjected to a calcining step at 550 °C to pyrolytically remove the organic material<br>
present in channel structure of the ZSM-5, before being used as a catalyst. However,<br>
when the organic material is removed by the calcining step, the incomplete pyrolysis<br>
thereof results in pore blockage of ZSM-5, thus drastically decreasing the activity of<br>
the catalyst. Further, the use of the organic template is disadvantageous in terms of<br>
additional costs due to the calcining step, and air contamination by gases discharged<br>
upon pyrolysis of the organic material.<br>
To overcome the above problems, in U.S. Patent No. 4,257,885 (1981) to<br>
Flanigen et al., there is disclosed a method of synthesizing ZSM-5 with or without the<br>
use of a crystallization seed in the absence of an organic material. However, the<br>
above method has a drawback in that a reaction period is 68-120 hours.<br>
Further, U.S. Patent No. 4,565,681 (1986) to Kuhl discloses a method of<br>
synthesizing ZSM-5 at 150-200 °C for 8-48 hours by mixing a silica source with an<br>
acid-treated alumina source in the absence of an organic material. Furthermore, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,240,892 (1993) to Klocke discloses a method of synthesizing ZSM-5<br>
from a silica precursor neutralized with sulfuric acid in the absence of an organic<br>
.template. However, the above methods have only 75% crystallinity, in spite of the<br>
reaction occurring at relatively high temperatures of 220 °C by using a crystallization<br>
seed acting to promote the crystallization.<br>
Likewise, U.S. Patent No. 5,254,327 (1993) to Martinez et al. discloses a<br>
method of synthesizing ZSM-5 by dissolving sodium aluminate in caustic soda without<br>
the use of a crystallization seed in the absence of an organic template, to prepare an<br>
aqueous solution, which is then mixed with colloidal silica. However, this method<br>
requires a reaction period not less than 48 hours.<br>
As mentioned above, the conventional methods of synthesizing ZSM-5 in the<br>
absence of the organic template are summarized by using the crystallization seed for<br>
promoting the crystallization, or neutralizing the alumina source with an acid solution<br>
to form a proper gel precursor, but have the disadvantage of a lengthy reaction period.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Leading to the present invention, intensive and thorough research into<br>
synthesis methods of ZSM-5, carried out by the present inventors aiming at problems<br>
encountered in the related art, resulted in the finding that a reaction mixture for<br>
preparation of ZSM-5 is subjected to a two-step variable temperature process, for<br>
example, nucleating at relatively high temperatures and then crystallizing at relatively<br>
low temperatures, without the use of an organic template and a crystallization seed,<br>
whereby a crystal size and a particle size distribution of the resulting ZSM-5 can be<br>
freely controlled. Moreover, ZSM-5 having substantially 100% crystallinity as well<br>
as desirable purity may be prepared.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of<br>
preparing ZSM-5 having a high crystallinity while freely controlling a crystal size and<br>
crystal size distribution, without the use of an organic template and a crystallization<br>
seed.<br>
It is another object of the present invention is to provide a method of easily<br>
preparing ZSM-5 having a uniform crystal size distribution and high crystallinity in<br>
wider composition ranges, instead of very narrow synthetic ranges regarded as the<br>
problem in the absence of the organic template.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Based on the present invention, a reaction mixture for use in preparation ZSM-<br>
5 is subjected to a two-step process, that is, nucleation and crystallization, thereby<br>
providing a preparation method of ZSM-5 having substantially 100% crystallinity<br>
while easily controlling a crystal size and a particle size distribution even in the<br>
absence of an organic template and a crystallization seed as a crystallization promoter.<br>
As such, the nucleation is performed at relatively high temperatures (180-210 °C) and<br>
the crystallization is carried out at relatively low temperatures (130-170 °C) until the<br>
crystallinity reaches substantially 100% with preference.<br>
Meanwhile, the crystal size is a very important factor for a catalytic reaction.<br>
In particular, it is preferred that the crystal size is smaller for the catalytic reaction<br>
requiring a rapid diffusion of a reactant and a product in pores of the zeolite. Further,<br>
in cases of catalytic reactions requiring not-too strong an acid site, the crystal size<br>
should not be too small. Hence, upon synthesizing ZSM-5 in the absence of the<br>
organic template by a hydrothermal reaction, the size of the resulting crystals should be<br>
properly controlled. For this, in the present invention, the two-step reaction is<br>
performed at the above variable temperatures to achieve the crystallization, thus easily<br>
controlling the crystal size and the particle size distribution important for the catalytic<br>
activity.<br>
In the present invention, the nucleation refers to a pure nucleation showing no<br>
presence of crystals of ZSM-5 on an XRD, while the crystallization refers to the<br>
increase of crystallinity over time on the XRD.<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
reaction mixture formation is performed differently from the conventional ones,<br>
whereby superior ZSM-5 can be easily synthesized in a wider composition range,<br>
instead of very narrow synthetic ranges regarded as the problem upon using no organic<br>
template.<br>
First, a silica source, an alkali metal oxide source, an alumina source and water<br>
are mixed to prepare a reaction mixture for preparation of ZSM-5. The preparation of<br>
the reaction mixture may be performed through a single-step or multi- step. At this<br>
point, although the temperature upon mixing the reactants is not particularly limited, it<br>
is typically room temperature. In the present invention, the reaction mixture is<br>
controlled to have a molar composition of M2O/SiO2 of about 0.07-0.14 (M: alkali<br>
metal ion), H2O/SiO2 of about 15-42 and SiO2/Al2O3 of about 20-100.<br>
In cases where the reaction mixture is obtained by the single step, a mixing<br>
sequence of the ingredients is not particularly limited. For example, the silica source,<br>
the alkali metal oxide source, water and the alumina source, in order, may be mixed.<br>
Otherwise, water, the alumina source, the alkali metal oxide source and the silica source<br>
may be sequentially mixed.<br>
However, since whether the silica source and/or the alumina source in the<br>
reaction mixture is present in an aqueous solution of a uniform gel state affects the<br>
quality of the resultant ZSM-5, a multi-step mixing procedure as mentioned below is<br>
preferably adopted, instead of the single step mentioned above.<br>
According to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, the silica<br>
source, the alkali metal oxide source (e.g., alkali metal hydroxide) and water are mixed<br>
to prepare a first aqueous solution. As such, it is preferable that the amount of the<br>
silica source in the first aqueous solution is controlled in the range of about 21.5-26.7<br>
wt%. This is because silica is not uniformly dissolved in water if water is present in<br>
either excessively small or large amount in the first aqueous solution. Separately, the<br>
alumina source, the alkali metal oxide source and water are mixed to obtain a second<br>
aqueous solution. As such, the alumina source in the second aqueous solution is<br>
controlled in the amount of about 0.9-4.4 wt%. This is also because the alumina source<br>
 should uniformly dissolved in water. Then, the second aqueous solution is added to the<br>
first aqueous solution. In consideration of the concentrations of the first aqueous<br>
solution and the second aqueous solution, in case that the H2O/SiO2 in the reaction<br>
mixture is below the required mol ratio, water is further added as a balance component.<br>
According to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention, the silica<br>
source, the alkali metal oxide source (e.g., alkali metal hydroxide) and water are mixed<br>
to obtain an aqueous silica source solution. As mentioned above, the amount of the<br>
silica source in the aqueous solution is preferably controlled in about 21.5-26.7 wt%.<br>
Separately, the alumina source is dissolved in water to prepare an aqueous alumina<br>
source solution, and is controlled in the amount of about 0.9-4.4 wt% in the aqueous<br>
alumina source solution. Then, the aqueous alumina source solution is added to the<br>
aqueous silica source solution. As such, considering the concentrations of the aqueous<br>
silica source solution and the aqueous alumina source solution, in case that the H2O/SiO2<br>
in the reaction mixture is below a required mol ratio, water is further added as a balance<br>
component. Thereby, the reaction mixture in the state of gel is simply obtained.<br>
As conventionally known, when the alumina source or the silica source is<br>
neutralized with an acid solution upon preparation of ZSM-5, since a precipitate such<br>
as sodium sulfate is generated, it is difficult to maintain consistency in the reaction<br>
composition. Therefore, the reaction composition essential for the synthesis of pure<br>
ZSM-5 cannot be accurately adjusted. However, the preparation method of ZSM-5<br>
according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention is advantageous in<br>
that neither a neutralization by an acid nor heating upon dissolution are not required,<br>
through the both relatively simple mixing method of the reactants and the two-step<br>
reaction at variable temperatures.<br>
Thereafter, the prepared reaction mixture is subjected to nucleation at the<br>
reaction temperature maintained at about 180-210 °C for the reaction time controlled in<br>
the range of 2-20 hours, depending on the crystal size and the particle size distribution<br>
of ZSM-5 to be prepared. Subsequently, the nucleated reaction mixture is crystallized<br>
at about 130-170 °C for about 10-200 hours.<br>
As mentioned above, the starting composition of the present invention, which<br>
has an influence on the properties of the resultant ZSM-5, is specifically described,<br>

As for the alkali metal oxide source, a proper alkali metal is exemplified by<br>
sodium (Na), lithium (Li), potassium (K), or cesium (Ce). Among them, sodium is<br>
preferable. In particular, it is most preferred that the alkali metal oxide source is used<br>
in the form of hydroxide.<br>
The silica source is preferably selected from the group consisting of colloidal<br>
silica, sodium silicate, white carbon and boehmite, and is representatively exemplified<br>
by colloidal silica, for example, 40 wt% Ludox AS-40 (Dupont Chem. Co.).<br>
In addition, the alumina serves as an important ingredient for the nucleation<br>
upon using no organic template, and the alumina source is exemplified by sodium<br>
aluminate and aluminum hydroxide.<br>
As such, the molar ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 in the reaction mixture for use in the<br>
preparation of ZSM-5 is preferably adjusted in the range of about 20-100. If the<br>
molar ratio is less than 20, it is difficult to synthesize pure ZSM-5 due to the formation<br>
of a modernite phase. Meanwhile, if the molar ratio exceeds 100, the nucleation per<br>
se cannot be performed and thus pure ZSM-5 is difficult to synthesize. More<br>
preferably, the above mol ratio is in the range of about 20-67. Although U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,240,892 discloses a mol ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 not more than 50 for the production<br>
of ZSM-5, the present invention provides the synthesis of ZSM-5 with substantially<br>
100% crystallinity and superior morphology even though the molar ratio of SiO2/Al2O3<br>
is not less than 50.<br>
Further, water used for the reaction mixture of the present invention is a very<br>
important ingredient for hydrothermal synthesis, with distilled water being preferred.<br>
The amount of water in the reaction mixture greatly affects the crystallization. In the<br>
present invention, the molar ratio of H2O/SiO2 is adjusted in the range of about 15-42,<br>
and preferably, about 22.5-29. Excessive addition of water results in a decreased<br>
crystallization rate and thus drastically increased crystallization time, thus lowering a<br>
reaction yield. Thus, the adding amount of water should be adjusted in the required<br>
range.<br>
According to the present invention, the reaction mixture having the<br>
composition range as described above is first subjected to the nucleation step of the<br>
two-step process. To induce the nucleation, the reaction mixture is reacted at about<br>
180-210 °C for about 2-20 hours. At this time, it is preferred that the molar ratio of<br>
M2O/SiO2 is adjusted depending on the given molar ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 in the reaction<br>
mixture. In consideration thereof, it is required to differently control the nucleation<br>
time. The reason is as follows.<br>
In cases where the molar ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 is relatively high (i.e.,<br>
SiO2/Al2O3=29 or higher), since pure ZSM-5 can be synthesized in the range of<br>
M2O/SiO2 of about 0.09-0.14, the nucleation time is relatively freely controlled. In<br>
particular, when the molar ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 is 29 or higher, the resultant ZSM-5<br>
becomes to have a hexagonal crystal morphology.<br>
On the other hand, when the mol ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 is low (i.e., SiO2/Al2O3<br>
less than 29), the molar ratio of M2O/SiO2 higher than 0.1 results in simultaneous<br>
production of the ZSM-5 and the modernite phase or production of only the modernite<br>
phase. Thus, the molar ratio of M2O/SiO2 should be maintained in the range not more<br>
than 0.1. However, if the molar ratio of M2O/SiO2 is less than 0.07, it is difficult to<br>
bring about the crystallization. Hence, it is preferred that the molar ratio of M2O/SiO2<br>
is maintained in the range of about 0.07-0.1. In this case, the nucleation rate and the<br>
crystallization rate become slow, and thus the crystallization time prolongs. In<br>
particular, if the molar ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 is less than 29, the resultant ZSM-5<br>
becomes to have a spiral crystal morphology.<br>
Particularly, at the molar ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 not more than 22 at which the<br>
modernite phase is produced, since the pure ZSM-5 is difficult to synthesize, the<br>
nucleation time should be long maintained to the extent of about 10-20 hours. In<br>
such a case, the subsequent crystallization rate becomes very slow, and the<br>
crystallization time is maintained in the range of about 96-200 hours to obtain pure<br>
ZSM-5.<br>
In the present invention, if the nucleation as the first step of the two-step<br>
process is carried out in an excessively short period, the results similar to single low<br>
temperature synthesis are obtained. On the contrary, if the nucleation time is too<br>
long, the results similar to single high temperature synthesis are obtained.<br>
Accordingly, the crystal size distribution becomes very wide and limitations are<br>
imposed on the use of the ZSM-5 as the catalyst. In particular, the nucleation<br>
temperature should be set to be relatively higher than the crystallization temperature.<br>
If the nucleation temperature is lower than the proper level, it is difficult to generate a<br>
rapid nucleation. Whereas, if it is higher than the proper level, the nucleation and the<br>
crystallization take place at the same time, and thus it is difficult to control the crystal<br>
size distribution. As a consequence, the nucleation temperature of the present<br>
invention is controlled in the range of about 180-210 °C, and preferably, about 180-<br>
190 °C.<br>
After the completion of the nucleation, the crystallization takes place to<br>
increase the crystallinity. In practice, it is preferable that the crystallization occurs<br>
until the crystallinity reaches substantially 100%. The temperature and time<br>
conditions required for the crystallization are determined in consideration of the<br>
composition of the reaction mixture, etc. Generally, the crystallization occurs at<br>
about 130-170 °C, and preferably, about 150-170 °C, relatively lower than the"<br>
nucleation temperature, for about 10-200 hours.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, the ZSM-5 can be prepared<br>
while an average crystal size is freely adjusted in the range of 1-6 µm, and preferably,<br>
2-3 µm, with a very narrow particle size distribution.<br>
Determination of the phase and calculation of the crystallinity of the reaction<br>
product obtained through the above processes are based upon the collection of data of<br>
29 7-9° and 22-25°, corresponding to characteristic peaks of ZSM-5, by use of an X-<br>
ray diffraction analyzer (Rigaku Model D/Max III). Further, the morphology of the<br>
product can be confirmed by means of a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Akasi<br>
Alpha 25A), and, to measure a specific surface area of the product, a BET<br>
(Micrometrics Co., ASAP 2010) method is typically adopted.<br>
Having generally described this invention, a further understanding can be<br>
obtained by reference to specific examples which are provided herein for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified.<br>

As apparent from Table 1, in cases where ZSM-5 is prepared through a two-step<br>
process (nucleation and crystallization) at variable temperatures according to the present<br>
invention, ZSM-5 having excellent properties as well as a specific surface area of 350 or<br>
more can be obtained. In Comparative Example 1 characterized by performing the<br>
nucleation and the crystallization at 190 °C and Example 4 characterized by performing<br>
the nucleation (190 °C) and the crystallization (150 °C), there is a remarkable difference<br>
between the crystal sizes and the particle size distributions even though the reaction<br>
mixture having the same composition is used. That is, in Example 4, the average<br>
crystal size amounts to about 2 µm as in FIG. 5b, whereas Comparative Example 1 has<br>
the average crystal size in the range of about 5-6 urn, with a very broad particle size<br>
distribution, as shown in FIG. 6b.<br>
Further, as in Table 2, in cases of Examples 22-26 having SiO2/Al2O3 of 50 or<br>
56, it can be seen that the resultant reaction product has a large crystal size and a broad<br>
particle size distribution as the nucleation time prolongs. In addition, when SiO2/Al2O3<br>
is controlled to 33 (Example 20 and Comparative Example 2) and 25 (Example 21 and<br>
Comparative Example 3), the two-step process using the variable temperatures results in<br>
a further decreased crystal size and particle size distribution than those of the synthesis<br>
process using the single temperature, as shown in Table 1, FIG. 22b (Example 20), FIG.<br>
23b (Comparative Example 2), FIG. 24b (Example 21) and FIG. 25b (Comparative<br>
Example 3).<br>
As a result, the reaction mixture is subjected to the two-step process at variable<br>
temperatures, and the nucleation as the first step is adjusted in the reaction time thereof,<br>
whereby the resulting ZSM-5 can be easily controlled in the crystal size and the particle<br>
size distribution while not affecting the BET surface area.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, the present invention provides a method of preparing<br>
ZSM-5 through a two-step process at variable temperatures in the absence of an<br>
organic template and a crystallization seed. By the above method, superior ZSM-5<br>
having substantially 100% crystallinity and better quality can be assured while a<br>
crystal size and a particle size distribution are easily controlled.<br>
