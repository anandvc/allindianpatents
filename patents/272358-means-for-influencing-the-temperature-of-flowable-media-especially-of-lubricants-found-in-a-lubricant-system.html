				<td>Means for Influencing the Temperature of Flowable Media,<br>
Especially of Lubricants found in a Lubricant System<br>
The invention relates to a means for influencing the temperature of flowable media,<br>
especially of lubricants found in a lubricant system, having a line through which the medium flows<br>
and at least one element which is assigned to the line section for influencing the temperature and<br>
which can be activated by supplying energy.<br>
Means of this type can be used for example in mechanical systems, especially in large<br>
machines, when operating states must be expected there in which for flowable operating media, for<br>
example lubricating oils, temperatures occur which had to an unfavorable operating behavior,<br>
specifically an overly great viscosity. These operating states, as can occur during cold running<br>
phases of certain systems or specifically in wind power plants under winter conditions, make it<br>
difficult to transport the operating media, for example the lubricant circulation. For this reason, on a<br>
certain line section, for example on the (ubricant line which leads from a mechanism via a pump and<br>
via filter means and the Hike back to the mechanism, there are conventionally means with elements<br>
for increasing or also reducing the temperature of the flowing media.<br>
 <br>
Known means of this type are made such that on the indicated line section one or more elements<br>
(heating elements, cooling elements) for influencing the temperature are attached on the<br>
outside wall and can be activated as necessary. In order to achieve a sufficient action for the<br>
medium located within the line section, it is necessary in this connection to provide external<br>
insulation which encompasses the line section and which lies over the elements in order to prevent<br>
excess losses to the outside. Aside from the fact that in spite of insulating outside jacketing in this<br>
connection sufficient efficiency is not achieved when the temperature of the inner medium is<br>
influenced, the external insulation jacketing leads to an awkwardly shaped outside contour of the<br>
line section which requires a large amount of space so that installation in mechanical systems under<br>
narrowed installation conditions becomes very difficult. Efficiency is especially low when the<br>
elements are attached to a nonmetallic line section, for example to an oil intake tube via which<br>
lubricating oil from the mechanism is intaken by means of a pump.<br>
With respect to this prior art, the object of the invention is to devise a means for influencing<br>
the temperature which is characterized not only by comparatively far better efficiency, but also by<br>
an especially space-saving construction.<br>
This object is achieved as claimed in the invention by a means which has the features of<br>
claim 1 in its entirety.<br>
Because in the invention at least one temperature-influencing element is located within the<br>
medium-carrying line section and can be supplied with energy via a connecting means which is<br>
located in the wall of the line section, on the one hand losses are prevented which arise in the prior<br>
art by heat transfers between the temperature-influencing elements located on the outside wall of the<br>
line section to the vicinity, even if there is complex external insulation over the elements. On the<br>
other hand, efficiency is very greatly improved as a result of the direct heat transfer between the<br>
medium and the elements placed in its flow path. Since moreover in the means as claimed in the<br>
invention the necessity is obviated of awkwardly shaped external insulation which surrounds the<br>
 <br>
line section and the elements located outside on it, the means as claimed in the invention is also<br>
characterized by an especially compact, space-saving construction, so that the means can also be<br>
used without difficulty in mechanical systems where narrowed space conditions prevail and little<br>
installation space is available.<br>
Preferably at least one temperature-influencing element is located within an element unit,<br>
and the connecting means is made such that it forms a holding device for fixing the position of the<br>
element unit.<br>
In the cases in which there is a means for raising the temperature of the pertinent media and<br>
the element unit is accordingly a heating unit which contains at least one heating element which can<br>
be activated by electrical energy, for especially advantageous exemplary embodiments the<br>
arrangement is such that the heating unit has at least one heating strip which extends in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the line section and which is intended as a heating element.<br>
Heating strips in the form of self-regulating surface heating strips are known and are<br>
commercially available. The self-regulating property enables use of such heating strips without the<br>
need for electrical control means. Since these heating strips are moreover available in any desired<br>
length, these heating strips are especially well suited for use in the means as claimed in the<br>
invention.<br>
In heating strips, even if they have a multilayer structure in the conventional manner and an<br>
outside protective jacket of polyolefin, in conjunction with certain media (oils) over very long<br>
operating intervals the protective jacket of the heating strips can be adversely affected. In an<br>
especially advantageous exemplary embodiment of the invention it is therefore provided that the<br>
heating unit containing at least one heating strip has a shell which surrounds at least one heating<br>
strip and which seals it against the medium.<br>
 <br>
This can advantageously be a corrugated tube of high-quality steel which is welded tight on<br>
one end and is connected to the connecting means on its other end.<br>
Here the arrangement can be made such that the connecting means has a pipe union which is<br>
located on one end region of the line section and through which the assigned end of the corrugated<br>
tube extends.<br>
This end of the corrugated tube can be welded to a sleeve-like adapter which with the<br>
interposition of a seal arrangement can be screwed to the outer end area of the pipe union which can<br>
form a penetration for a connecting cable for power supply of at least one heating strip which is<br>
located in the corrugated tube.<br>
In the corrugated tube there are preferably two heating strips which run longitudinally and<br>
which are held spaced apart from one another by a separating element which extends between them,<br>
so that the thermal influence of the heating strips on one another and thus any adverse effect on the<br>
self-regulating property of each individual heating strip are avoided.<br>
In exemplary embodiments in which the line section can be an oil intake tube, therefore a<br>
component with nonmetallic wall, the arrangement is preferably made such that the line section has<br>
a metallic elbow which is bent relative to the longitudinal axis of the intake tube and which is<br>
connected to the oil intake tube, and that on the elbow there is a pipe union, the pipe union<br>
preferably extending in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the intake tube, so that the<br>
corrugated tube which has been screwed to the pipe union is fixed in the position which extends in<br>
the direction of the longitudinal axis of the intake tube.<br>
The invention is explained below in detail with reference to an exemplary embodiment<br>
shown in the drawings, in which<br>
 <br>
FIG. 1 shows a shortened longitudinal section of one exemplary embodiment of the means<br>
as claimed in the invention, the illustrated exemplary embodiment being made for increasing the<br>
temperature of the lubricating oil which is flowing through an oil intake tube;<br>
FIG. 2 shows a dismounted view of a heating strip which is shown slightly enlarged<br>
compared to a practical embodiment and partially cut through for use in the means as claimed in the<br>
invention;<br>
FIG. 3 shows a highly schematically simplified sketch simply for illustration of the<br>
positioning of the two heating strips which are drawn on a smaller scale compared to FIG. 2, within<br>
the shell of the heating unit provided in the exemplary embodiment of the invention and<br>
FIG. 4 shows a longitudinal section of simply the shell of the heating unit, drawn isolated<br>
and enlarged compared to FIG. 1 and to one practical embodiment.<br>
The invention is explained below with reference to the drawings using one exemplary<br>
embodiment in which there is a means for increasing the temperature of the lubricating oil which is<br>
flowing through the intake tube 1. The nonmetallic intake tube 1 made in the conventional manner<br>
is connected on one end by means of a connecting fitting 3 to a mechanism which is not shown and<br>
on the opposite end has a metallic pipe elbow 5 which is bent at a right angle relative to the<br>
longitudinal axis 7 of the intake tube 1 and leads to a pump which is not shown, which sucks the<br>
lubricating oil out of the mechanism and forms part of a pertinent lubricant circuit.<br>
As access to the line section formed by the intake tube 1 and the elbow 5, a pipe union 9 is<br>
welded to the elbow 5 such that it forms a passage with an axis which coincides with the<br>
longitudinal axis 7 of the intake tube 1. An elongated heating unit labeled 11 as a whole extends<br>
through the passage formed by the pipe union 9 into the interior of the intake tube 1 along the axis 7<br>
into the vicinity of the end-side connecting fitting 3. The heating unit 11 has a corrugated tube 13 of<br>
 <br>
conventional design of high grade steel as a shell which seals the interior of the heating unit 11<br>
fluid-tight against the surrounding lubricating oil. The corrugated tube 13 which is shown separately<br>
and enlarged in FIG. 4 is welded fluid-tight to the closure body 15 on the end which has been placed<br>
on the right in the drawings. On the other incoming end assigned to the pipe union 9, the corrugated<br>
tube 13 is welded to a sleeve-like adapter 17 at the weld 19. In a longitudinal section placed<br>
between the outer end 21 and the weld 19 the adapter 17 has a thickened area with a conical surface<br>
23 which is tilted to the inside in the direction to the weld 19 and in which an annular groove 25 is<br>
made for a gasket which is not shown in FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 1 shows the heating unit 11 in the installed state, the corrugated tube 13 extending into<br>
the pipe union 9 which forms a holder for the heating unit 11, i.e. with its inside wall aligns the<br>
corrugated tube 13 so that it extends along the axis 7 in the intake tube 1. In the outside edge area<br>
the pipe union 9 has a conical surface which is complementary to the conical surface 23 of the<br>
adapter 17, which in the installed state is adjoined by the conical surface 23 of the adapter 17, and<br>
which is sealed thereon via the gasket 27 (FIG. 1) which sits in the annular groove 25. The outer end<br>
section of the pipe union 9 has an outside thread 29 in order to screw the adapter to the pipe union<br>
by means of a union nut 31 which is supported on the annular shoulder 33 (FIG. 4) of the adapter<br>
17.<br>
As is best shown in FIG. 4, the adapter 17 on its open end 21 has an inner widened area with<br>
an inside thread 35 into which a hollow threaded plug 37 can be screwed which is part of the<br>
penetration of an electrical connecting cable in the form of a so-called oil connection 39. Electrical<br>
power supply of the heating elements located in the heating unit 11 within the corrugated tube 13<br>
takes place via this connection 39.<br>
Details of the structure and the arrangement of the heating elements can be taken from<br>
FIGS. 2 and 3. FIG. 2 shows the structure of a heating strip which is intended for use in the<br>
invention, which is labeled 41 as a whole in FIG. 2 and in the conventional manner has two<br>
 <br>
electrical leads 43 which run at a distance from one another and between which there is strip-like<br>
material 45 which in the conventional manner forms a self-regulating resistance element between<br>
the conductors 43. As is known, the electrical resistance of the material 45 has a positive<br>
temperature coefficient so that with rising temperature of the material 45 the strength of the current<br>
flowing between the conductors 43 decreases and self-limitation of the heating action occurs. Since<br>
heating strips 41 are available in any length, the power and temperature ranges desired at the time<br>
can be accommodated without the need for control means.<br>
As can be taken from FIG. 2, the heating strip 41 is made such that the self-regulating<br>
material 45 is surrounded by an electrical insulating jacket 47. The latter in turn is enclosed by a<br>
protective braid 49 of galvanized copper litz wire. This braid is used for grounding (protective<br>
conductor) of the heating strip, protects individuals according to VDE (Association of German<br>
Electrical Engineers) Standards, and offers additional mechanical protection. An outside jacket 51<br>
of polyolefin forms the outer termination of the structure.<br>
In this example the heating unit 11 has two heating strips 41 which are located running<br>
longitudinally within the corrugated tube 13 and which, as the outline sketch from FIG. 3 illustrates,<br>
are thermally insulated from one another by a joint strip 53 which runs longitudinally between them.<br>
This thermal decoupling of the heating strips 41 prevents the temperatures of the two strips from<br>
being mutually brought to bear and thus the intensity of the heating output, a function of the<br>
temperature of the surrounding medium, is not influenced by the other heating strip. The use of<br>
heating strips 41 is advantageous in several respects. Thus, based on the self-limitation of power,<br>
vise without a temperature limiter is possible. The heating strips 41 can be cut off in any length to<br>
adapt to the pertinent conditions of use by the parallel current supply.<br>
A joint strip 53 in the form of precompressed polyurethane foam has proven especially<br>
effective as the separating element between the heating strips 41. In particular, it can be an open-cell<br>
polyurethane soft foam, impregnated with a synthetic resin made flame-retardant.<br>
 <br>
