Technical Field<br>
[0008]	This invention relates generally to networked communications and more<br>
particularly to communication systems characterized by a plurality of hierarchically layered<br>
mobility management agents.<br>
-1A-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. CE14029R<br>
Background<br>
[0009]	One-way and two-way wireless communications are a relatively well-understood<br>
area of endeavor. In many cases, various network elements comprise an infrastructure that<br>
supports the communications needs of one or more mobile stations. These communications<br>
needs can comprise voice calls, data communications, and so forth. In many cases, modern<br>
communications networks comprise a large number of geographically differentiated wireless<br>
access points that essentially define the network's edge. Such geographic differentiation, in<br>
turn, facilitates significant reuse of various network resources such as radio frequency bearer<br>
channels, control channels, time slots, spreading codes, and so forth. Aggressive reuse of<br>
such resources then facilitates viably supporting a relatively large user population.<br>
[0010]	Such communication networks, however, have become ever more complex.<br>
Pursuant to one approach, geographically parsed points of access couple to one another and<br>
to a plurality of mobility management agents (such as, but not limited to, Home Agents) that<br>
are hierarchically differentiated from those wireless access points and, in many cases, from<br>
each other as well. These coupled relationships serve to facilitate various mobility<br>
management functions such as, but not limited to:<br>
	- Connected mode mobility (for example, handover of a presently communicating<br>
mobile station from one wireless access point to another);<br>
	- Idle mode mobility (for example, supporting and effecting location updates for<br>
and/or paging of supported mobile stations);<br>
	- Subscriber and call session management (for example, authentication, authorization,<br>
and accounting services, policy administration, and so forth);<br>
	- Radio frequency resource management (for example, resource scheduling,<br>
admission control dynamic quality of service management, load balancing, and so forth);<br>
to name but a few.<br>
[0011]	Unfortunately, while such an architectural approach indeed successfully supports<br>
the intended service capability, there are issues of concern. For example, such proposals<br>
often tend to present significant scaling difficulties and barriers to feature growth and<br>
expansion. The end result represents increased costs (both for service providers and for<br>
subscribers) as pertain both to the infrastructure and to the mobile stations themselves, rapid<br>
obsolescence, and/or delayed expansion or upgrades with respect to capacity and/or features.<br>

Attorney Docket No. CE14029R<br>
Detailed Description<br>
[0018]	Generally speaking, pursuant to these various embodiments, a wireless access<br>
point (and in particular a wireless access point having native mobility agent functionality)<br>
facilitates a communication need of a mobile station, with respect to a communication system<br>
that comprises a plurality of hierarchically layered mobility management agents (such as, but<br>
not limited to, Mobile Internet Protocol Home Agents). In a preferred approach, the wireless<br>
access point acquires a surrogate Internet Protocol address to use on behalf of the mobile<br>
station and then uses that surrogate Internet Protocol address as a surrogate address for the<br>
mobile station and its own Internet Protocol address as a. care-of address for the mobile<br>
station when interacting with a first mobility management.agent to support the<br>
communication need of the mobile station,<br>
[0019]	Pursuant to one approach, the wireless access point provides the surrogate Internet<br>
Protocol address by detecting the mobile station (as when, for example, the mobile station<br>
becomes attached to the wireless access point), acquiring the surrogate Internet Protocol<br>
address (from, for example, a local Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server),<br>
and transmitting a registration request (such as a Mobile Internet Protocol registration<br>
request) to that first mobility management agent. In a preferred approach, that registration<br>
request presents the surrogate Internet Protocol address as a surrogate address for the mobile<br>
station and (he Internet Protocol address of the wireless access point as a care-of address for<br>
the mobile station. It may be noted that the surrogate Internet Protocol address need not be<br>
the same as a home address assigned to the mobile.<br>
[0020]	So configured, the wireless access point can establish, a data path, between itself<br>
and the first mobility management agent to support the back-and-forth transmission of both<br>
real time and non-real time data packets as correspond to the mobile station. If necessary<br>
and/or as desired, a similar approach can be employed with other mobility management<br>
agents of oilier hierarchical layers of the communication network. Accordingly, those skilled<br>
in the art will appreciate the relative ease by which these teachings can be scaled upwardly to<br>
accommodate essentially any sized communication network.<br>
[0021]	These teachings are also applicable to handover scenarios and other mobility<br>
management events. When handing over the mobile station to another wireless access point<br>
that shares the first mobility management agent with the aforementioned wireless access<br>
-4-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. CE14029R<br>
point (as when, for example, both wireless access points share a common subnet), it may be<br>
possible to persist the surrogate Internet Protocol address by communicating that address to<br>
the second wireless access point. This, in turn, can avoid the necessity of altering or re-<br>
defining any already -existing data paths or tunnels associated with mobility management<br>
agents serving higher levels within the hierarchy of the communication system.<br>
[0022]	When handing wet the mobile station to a wireless access point that does not<br>
share the same mobility management agent (as when, for example, the two wireless access<br>
points do not share a common subnet and the resources thereof), the wireless access point that<br>
receives the hand over can benefit from these teachings by acquiring a surrogate Internet<br>
Protocol address as suggested above and employing that surrogate address along with its own<br>
Internet Protocol address (again as a care-of address) when interacting with its own mobility<br>
management agent to establish a new data tunnel on behalf of the mobile station. This, in<br>
turn, may further entail interactions with mobility management agents serving higher levels<br>
within the hierarchy of the communication system in order to establish a data path from the<br>
mobile station to the desired end point (such as the Home Agent that serves the mobile<br>
station's home subnet).<br>
[0023]	Again, those skilled in the art will appreciate that these solutions are readily<br>
scalable. In many instances, these approaches also serve to establish and/or maintain the<br>
necessary data paths in a manner that tends to minimize, at least to some extent, the tearing<br>
down and building up of at least some data tunnels, as at least some existing data tunnels that<br>
serve to connect various layers of the communication system are often reusable.<br>
[0024]	These and other benefits may become clearer upon making a thorough review and<br>
study of the following detailed description. Referring now to the drawings, and in particular<br>
to FIG. 1, a process 100 suitable for use by a wireless access point in a communication<br>
system to facilitate one or more mobile station communication needs (where tha'.<br>
communication system comprises a plurality of hierarchically layered mobility management<br>
agents) comprises the provision 101 and use 102 of a surrogate Internet Protocol (IP) address<br>
on behalf of the mobile station. The communication need itself can comprise any of a wide<br>
variety of presently known of hereafter-developed communication needs, such as (but not<br>
limited to) a need to transmit or to receive a data packet, a need to receive a page, a need to<br>
respond to a page, a need to perform a location update, a need to perform a routing area<br>
-5-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. CE14029R<br>
update, a need to effect a hand over from one wireless access point to another wireless access<br>
point, and so forth, to name but a few.<br>
[0025]	Provision 101 of the surrogate Internet Protocol address (and referring now<br>
momentarily to FIG. 2) will preferably comprise detecting 201 the mobile station (when, for<br>
example, the mobile station becomes attached to the wireless access point in accordance with<br>
well understood prior art practice) and then acquiring 202 the surrogate Internet Protocol<br>
address in response to such detection. This acquisition 202 can be facilitated in numerous<br>
ways. By one approach, the wireless access point can acquire a local Internet Protocol<br>
address from a local subnet resource (such as a local Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP)<br>
server) in accordance with present practice.<br>
[0026]	The wireless access point can then, in a preferred approach, transmit 203 a Mobile<br>
Internet Protocol registration request (as is known in the art) to a mobility management agent<br>
to present the surrogate Internet Protocol address as a surrogate for the mobile station, and the<br>
wireless access point's own Internet Protocol address as a care-of address for the mobile<br>
station.<br>
[0027]	In a preferred approach, the mobility management agent will typically comprise a<br>
local resource that is directly associated with the wireless access point's local subnet. For the<br>
purposes of illustration, this mobility management agent can comprise, for example, a local<br>
[0028]	In some cases, of course, this local Horne Agent will not comprise the Home<br>
Awgent for the mobile station's, own home, subnet. In such a case, the Home Agent for the<br>
mobile station's home subnet comprises a hierarchically different mobility management agent<br>
as viewed with respect to the local Home Agent. By these teachings, and in a preferred<br>
approach, in such a case the wireless, access point can then transmit another Mobile Internet<br>
Protocol registration request, this time to the Home Agent for me mobile station's home<br>
subnet. This Mobile Internet protocol registration request will preferably present the mobile<br>
station's home Internet Protocol address (wherein it shall be understood herein that a "home"<br>
address can comprise a traditional home address as is assigned to that mobile station or a<br>
primary Internet Protocol address as is otherwise associated with that mobile station) as a<br>
home address and the surrogate Internet Protocol address as a care-of address.<br>
-6-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. CE14029R<br>
[0029]	So configured, and referring again to FIG. 1, this surrogate Internet Protocol<br>
address is then used 102, along with the wireless access point's own Internet Protocol<br>
address, when interacting with one or more mobility management agents (such as Home<br>
Agents) when supporting the communication needs of the mobile station,<br>
[0030]	As one illustration of such use, and referring again to the illustrative scenario<br>
presented earner, the Home Agent for the mobile station will now tunnel all packets destined<br>
for the mobile station (which this Home Agent identifies by the mobile station's home<br>
Internet Protocol address and which again may comprise a previously assigned address or a<br>
more recently acquired address) to the surrogate Internet Protocol address first obtained by<br>
the wireless access point onbehalf of the mobile station. In the above scenario, the local<br>
Home Agent (i.e., the Home Agent that comprises a part of the wireless access point's local<br>
subnet) will then use its information to further tunnel such packets to the wireless access<br>
point using the surrogate Internet Protocol address in the role of a home address and the<br>
wireless access point's own Internet Protocol address as a care-of address. The wireless<br>
access point can then decapsulate both tunnels and forward the packets to the mobile station<br>
baaed upon its earlier correlation of the acquired surrogate Internet Protocol address with the<br>
mobile station itself.<br>
[0031]	In many cases, of course, the hierarchical structure of the communication system<br>
will comprise more layers than those suggested above in the provided example.<br>
Notwithstanding such increased complexity, these same teachings are readily applied in such<br>
a setting. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these teachings are deployable in such a<br>
context without presenting significant scaling problems. In general, with additional<br>
hierarchical layers (supporting a corresponding plurality of hierarchically layered mobility<br>
management agents) one can further acquire, for each level of the plurality of hierarchically<br>
layered mobility managenasnt agents save one level, a surrogate Internet Protocol address to<br>
again use as described above on behalf of the mobile station. The highest hierarchical layer<br>
mobility management agent will typically not benefit from itself acquiring such a surrogate<br>
Internet Protocol address and hence can be excluded from this practice in many instances.<br>
[0032]	The mobility management agent at each level of a plurality of hierarchically<br>
differentiated mobility management agents can then employ usage of these Internet Protocol<br>
addresses as described earlier to effect the establishment of corresponding tunnels to facilitate<br>
the passage of mobile station packets to and from the mobile station with respect to sources<br>
-7-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. CE14029R<br>
and targets that are external to the local subnet to which the mobile station is presently<br>
attached.<br>
[0033]	A wireless access point can be configured in any of many ways to participate in<br>
and otherwise Facilitate such a process. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the<br>
above-described processes are readily enabled using any of a wide variety of available and/or<br>
readily configured platforms, including partially or wholly programmable platforms as are<br>
known in the art or dedicated, purpose platforms as may be desired for some applications.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, an illustrative approach to such a platform will now be provided.<br>
[0034]	In this illustrative embodiment, the wireless access point 300 comprises, in<br>
relevant part, a mobility agent 301. This mobility agent 301 operably couples, in turn, to a<br>
mobile station interface 302 (such as, for example, a wireless base station) and a local<br>
network interface 303 (where the local network may comprise, for example, an Internet<br>
Protocol-compatible subnet as is known in the art). In a preferred approach this mobility<br>
agent 30L also bas access to an Interact Protocol address 304 (comprising, for example, its<br>
own Internet Protocol address) and one or more surrogate Internet Protocol addresses 305<br>
(murtiple such surrogate Internet Protocol addresses may be provided when supporting, for<br>
example, the communication needs of a corresponding plurality of mobile stations or in<br>
settings where multiple surrogate addresses are employed with a single mobile station).<br>
These addresses can be stored, for example, in one or more memories using well understood<br>
prior art techniques in this regard.<br>
[0035]	In a preferred approach, the mobility agent 301 is configured and arranged (for<br>
example, via suitable programming using prior art practice in this regard) to selectively<br>
support the creation of a tunnel with a first mobility management agent (such as, for example,<br>
a local Home Agent) using a surrogate Internet Protocol address on behalf of a given mobile<br>
station and the wireless access point's own Internet Protocol address to support the mobile<br>
station's communication need or needs in accordance with the previously described<br>
processes. In particular, the mobility agent 301 can serve to acquire a surrogate Internet<br>
Protocol address for a given mobile station and to effect the usage of that surrogate Internet<br>
Protocol address as described above.<br>
[0036]	Referring now to FIG. 4, a number of examples will now be provided while.<br>
making reference to a simple system illustration.<br>
-8-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. CE14029R<br>
	EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0037]	In this example a mobile station 401 becomes attached to a first wireless access<br>
point 300A. This first wireless access point 300A has its own (likely previously acquired)<br>
Internet Protocol address IPL In this example, regardless of whether the mobile station 401<br>
is Mobile Internet Protocol proficient and in accordance with the teachings presented above,<br>
this first wireless access point now acquires a surrogate Internet Protocol address EP2 from a<br>
suitable local resource (for example, from a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Server<br>
(not shown) as may comprise a part of the local subnet that comprises the first wireless access<br>
point 3G0A itself).<br>
[0038]	Upon acquiring this surrogate Internet Protocol address IP2, the wireless access<br>
point 300A then transmits a Mobile Internet Protocol registration request to a local mobility<br>
management agent 402. In some instances, this mobility management agent also comprises a<br>
part of the local subnet that comprises this wireless access point 300A. In this embodiment,<br>
the local subnet fabric comprises a first Internet Protocol network 403 as is known in the art,<br>
The registration request presents the surrogate Internet Protocol address IP2 as a home<br>
address for the mobile, station and the wireless access point's Internet Protocol address IPI as<br>
a care-of address. The local mobility management agent 402 (which may comprise, for<br>
example, a local Home Agent) and this wireless access point 300A then establish a data<br>
tunnel via the Internet Protocol network 403 to carry data packets to (and optionally from if<br>
desired) the mobile station under the auspices of the addressing scheme described.<br>
[0039]	In this example, this local mobility management agent 402 is not the home<br>
mobility management agent, i.e. the mobility management agent on the subnet corresponding<br>
to the home address for this particular mobile station 401. Accordingly, and again in<br>
conformance with the teachings set forth above, the wireless access point 300A now<br>
transmits another Mobile Internet Protocol registration request to a home mobility<br>
management agent 404 as corresponds to this particular mobile station 401. This registration<br>
request presents the mobile station's home Internet Protocol address as a home address and<br>
the surrogate Internet Protocol address EP2 as a care-of address.<br>
[0040]	Accordingly, the home mobility management agent 404 will now tunnel packets<br>
destined to the mobile station's home Internet Protocol address to the local mobility<br>
management agent 402 using the surrogate Internet Protocol address IP2 as the destination.<br>
-9-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. CE14029R<br>
Upon receiving such a packet, the local mobility management agent 402 will use its own<br>
address correlations and further tunnel those packets to the wireless access point 300A. The<br>
latter will then decapsulate both tunnels and forward the packets on to the mobile station 401.<br>
[0041]	Those skilled in the art will appreciate that this approach permits a fully Internet<br>
Protocol-based infrastructure to compatibly interact with a non-Internet Protocol capable<br>
mobile station. Skilled practitioners will also understand and appreciate that this approach<br>
avoids the need to decapsulate data packets at network elements such as the local mobility<br>
management agent 402. Instead, all de-tunneling (including de-tunneling of multiple levels<br>
of tunnels-within-tunnels) occurs at the wireless access point; i.e., at a lowest layer within the<br>
hierarchically differentiated strata of the communication network itself.<br>
	EXAMINE 2<br>
[0042]	In this next example, which might be viewed as a continuation of events beyond<br>
that described in EXAMPLE 1 presented above, the mobile station 401 has moved and is now<br>
attached to a second wireless access point 300B. In this exmple, this second wireless access<br>
point 300B also comprises a part of the same subnet as includes the original wireless access<br>
point 300 A. In this example, this second wireless access point has. its own Interact Protocol<br>
address JP3.<br>
[0043]	As per the teachings described above, me second wireless access point 300B can<br>
now use that previously acquired surrogate Internet Protocol address IP2 on behalf of the<br>
mobile station 401 as and when the latter hands over to the second wireless access point<br>
300B.<br>
[0044]	The second wireless access point 300B then transmits a Mobile Internet Protocol<br>
registration request to the mobility management agent 402. Again, in accordance with these<br>
teachings, this registration request presents the surrogate Internet Protocol address IPS as a<br>
home address and the Internet Protocol address IP3 of the second wireless access point 300B<br>
as a care-of address. This permits establishing a corresponding data tunnel as between the<br>
first mobility management agent 402 and the second wireless access point 300B to again<br>
support the communication needs of the mobile station 401.<br>
[0045]	In a preferred approach, the previously established tunnel between the first<br>
wireless access point 300A and the first mobility management agent 402 can now be torn<br>
down. Those skilled in the art will appreciate, however, that the tunnel as was previously<br>
-10-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. CE14029R<br>
established with the home mobility management agent 404 need not be altered. Instead, that<br>
network element can continue to operate as before and data packets destined for the mobile<br>
station 401 will be effectively routed to the second wireless access point 300B where they<br>
can be decapsulated and forwarded to the mobile station 401.<br>
	EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0046]	In this example, the mobile station 401 has roamed beyond the coverage area of<br>
the wireless access points as were previously discussed and is now attached to a third<br>
wireless access point 300C that comprises a part of a different subnet. As before, this third<br>
wifeless access point 300C has its own corresponding Internet Protocol address 1P4.<br>
Accordingly, in a preferred approach, this third wireless access point 300C will essentially<br>
repeat the steps set forth in the first example above. This includes acquiring a new surrogate<br>
Internet Protocol address IP5 from a local resource and using that surrogate Internet Protocol<br>
address IP5 and its own Internet Protocol address IP4 with both a local mobility management<br>
agent 405 and the home mobility management agent 404 for the mobile station to establish<br>
corresponding data tunnels as described above.<br>
[0047]	Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these teachings are generally<br>
applicable without requiring reprogramming or other alteration of the mobile stations<br>
themselves. In particular, these teachings can be effectuated in a relatively transparent<br>
manner to the mobile station. As a result, these teachings can be employed with Internet<br>
Protocol and Mobile Internet Protocol capable mobile station, but are also useful when<br>
employed with non-Mobile Internet Protocol and/or non-Internet Protocol capable mobile<br>
stations. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that these teachings are readily<br>
employed to good effect in a network that comprises multiple hierarchical levels of mobility<br>
management agents.<br>
[0048]	Those skilled in the art will recognize that a wide variety of modifications,<br>
alterations and combinations can be made with respect to the above described embodiments<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, and that such modifications,<br>
alterations, and combinations are to be viewed as being within the ambit of the inventive<br>
concept.<br>
