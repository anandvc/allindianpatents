PROCESS FOR PREPARING PHENYLORGANOSILICON INTERMEDIATES<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to a method for preparing phenyl-containing organosilicon intermediates using an aromatic halogenated solvent during the coupling reaction involving a phenyl Grignard reagent and a precursor halosilane. The process comprises contacting a phenyl halide with magnesium in a solvent such as ether, or aromatic haiogsnatcd solvent/ether'mixtures to form a Grignard reagent, and thereafter contacting the Grignard reagent with a precursor chlorosflane in aromatic halogenated solvent to form the desired organosilicon intermediates, and then filtering and distilling to acquire the organosilicon intermediate reaction product. [0002]   The inventors of the present invention have found that the use of aromatic halogenated solvents in conjunction with ethers, the traditional Grignard reaction solvents, results in lower reaction temperatures, the ability to separate the desired organosilicon intermediate from the by-produced magnesium halides with ease which results in higher yields of purer organosulconintennediates, and, created the ability reduce the amount of waste solvent that normally occurs with the traditional Grignard process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]   The reaction of organic halides with magnesium metal in the presence of<br>
oxygenated solvents such as dialkyl ethers to form reactive complexes typically refisrred<br>
to as Grignard reagents is well known. The production and reactions of Grignard<br>
reagents has been the subject of books and numerous review articles. Such reviews are<br>
provided, for example, in Coates, et at, ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOUNDS, VoL 1,<br>
pp. 76 -103, (1967), Methuen and Co. Ltd, London, UK.; and in Kirk/Othmer,<br>
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY, Vol. 10,721-734 (1966), The<br>
Interscience Encyclopedia, Inc., NY  N.Y. The structure of me Grignard reagent has not<br>
been determined with certainty, however it is generally believed that the Grignard reagent<br>
exists as a complex in solution and thatsolvent can play a critical role in such complex y GRANTED<br>
formation. The unpredictable effect of solvent on the formation and reactivity of	<br>
Grignard reagents is discussed in the above cited review artides, and the inventors herein believe, but should not be held to such a theory, that the following reaction equations<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
556/MUMNP/2004	15-5-2007	11MAY 2007<br><br>
may be the actual mechanisms in the inventive process, wherein by way of example, phenyl chloride is used as the organic halide reactant:<br>
MeSiCl3<br>
PhenylCl + Mg —&gt;{PhenylMgCl}	&gt; Phenylmethyldichlorosilane+MgCI2<br>
aromatic halogenated solvent<br>
,[0004]... It is also well known from the patent literature that phenyl magnesium chloride as a Grignard reagent can be prepared by reacting chlorobenzene with-magnesium at reflux temperatures in the presence of a catalytic amount of a halide catalyst selected from the class consisting of carbon tetrachloride and silicon tetrachloride. Cf. U.S. paten) 2,795,627 issued to Ramsden on June 11,1957. Also, Ramsdcn teaches, in U.S. patent 2,795,628, that also issued on June 11,1957, that phenylmagnesum chloride Grignard reagents can be prepared by reacting magnesium having an oxidized surface, with sulfur-free aromatic halogenated agents at reflux temperatures.<br>
{0005]    Finally, it is important to note that U.S. 5,596,120, that issued to Bank, et al, on January 21,1997 teaches the preparation of alkyl-containing organosilanes in a one-step process that comprises contacting magnesium metal with a mixture comprising an organic halide and a halosilane in a co-solvent comprising about one to 15 moles of a dialkyl ether and a mole of allyl ofaloride and about 0.05 to less man two moles of a liquid aromatic hydrocarbon solvent per mole of the dialkyl ether, at a temperature within a range of about 5°C. to 200°C, it being especially noted that the process is directed to toluene, xylene, and benzene as the hydrocarbon solvents.<br>
THE INVENTION [0006]   The present invention deals with a method for preparing phenyl-containing organosilicon intermediates using an aromatic halogenated solvent during the coupling reaction involving a phenyl Grignard reagent and a precursor halosilane. The process comprises contacting a phenyl halide with magnesium in a solvent such as ether, or aromatic halogesated/ether mixtures to form a Grignard reagent, and contacting the Grignard reagent with a precursor chlorosilane in an aromatic halogenated solvent to form the desired organosilicon intermediates, and then filtering and distilling  to acquire the organosilicon intermediate reaction product<br><br>
[0007]   More specifically, the invention deals with a method for preparing phenyl-containing organosilicon intermediates, wherein the method comprises contacting a phenyl-containing Grignard reagent with a precursor chlorosiiane having the general formula R.S SIX 4+ wherein each R is independently selected from the phenyl group, the vinyl group, the methyl group, or hydrogen, X is chlorine or bromine and. has a value of 0,1, or2, sad allowing the Grignard reagent to react with the precursor chlorosiiane to form a phenyl-containing organosilicon intermediate, wherein the reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent selected from the group: a mixture of a dialkyl ether solvent and aromatic halogenated soivent'or a mixture of a mixture of dialkyl ether solvents and an aromatic balogenated solvent [0008]  In a further embodiment there is a method for preparing phenyl -containing <br>
organosilicon intermediates wherein the method comprises contacting magnesium metal with a mixture comprising a phenylhalide wherein the halide is selected from 1 chloride and bromide; a precursor chlorosiiane having the general formula R,S SiX4-4wherein each R is independently selected from the phenyl group, the vinyl group, the methyl group, or hydrogen, X is chlorine or bromine, and , has a value of 0,1, or 2; a co-solvent selected from the group consisting of a mixture of a dialkyl ether solvent and an aromatic halogenated solvent or a mixture of a mixture of dialkyl ether solvents and an aromatic halogenated solvent<br>
{0009)   Although die phenyl Gngnard reagent can be prepared separately, and then used in the coupling reaction with the mixture of a dialkyl ether and aromatic halogenated solvent, or a mixture of a mixture of dialkyl ethers and aromatic halogenated solvent it is preferred that all of these embodiments are "one-step" processes for the preparation of phenyi-contauring organosilicon intermediates because it is not necessary to isolate an intermediate Grlgnard-type reagent in the process and then further react this Grignard-type reagent with the precursor halosilaae to form the organosilicon intermediates. Further, it is not necessary to conduct a separate solubilization step on the resulting product slurry to facilitate recovery of the organosilicon intermediates and the excess solvents.<br><br>
9<br>
(0010]   The magnesium metal used in this invention can be any of the known forms of the metal that are currently used for Grignard-type reactions. For example, the metal can be any of those known in the art that are in the form of powder, flakes, granules, chips, lumps, and shavings, and the like.<br>
(0011]   Contact of the magnesium metal with the phenyl halide can be undertaken in standard type reactors suitable for running Grignard type reactions. The reactor can be a batch, semi-batch, or continuous type of reactor. A preferred reactor is a continuous reactor. The environment in which the present method is carried out should be inert for best results. Therefore, in a preferred method, the reactor is purged and blanketed with an inert gas such as, for example,'nitrogen or argon.<br>
[0012]    Generally, the initial charge of magnesium metal is placed in the reactor containig  a co-solvent mixture. The phenyl halide in additional co-solvent is then fed to the reactor at a controlled rate. Once the reaction is started, the mole ratio of magnesium to the phenyl halide fed to the reactor is not critical and can be varied within wide limits, m a batch process, it is preferred that the final mole ratios of magnesium to phenyl halide provide the phenyl halide in sufficient excess to ensure essentially total conversion of the magnesium to the magnesium salts. When the present process is conducted as a continuous process, the magnesium metal is typically present in excess in relation to me phenyl halide fed to the reactor, m such a case, the rate of feed of the phenyl halide to the reactor can be controlled to ensure acceptable levels of conversion of the phenyl halide to the organosilicon intermediates and, minimal presence of the unreacted phenyl magnesium halide complexes. Any excess phenyl halide and/or solvents can be captured and recycled to the reactor.<br>
[0013]   Phenyl halides useful in this invention are those described by the formula RX wherein R is phenyl and X is selected from chlorine or bromine atoms. Preferred for this invention is phenyl chloride.<br>
[0014]   Chlorosilanes useful as precursor silanes in this invention have the general formula R,S SiX 4-a wherein each R is independently selected from the phenyl group, the vinyl group, the methyl group, or hydrogen, X is chlorine or bromine and has a value of 0,1, or 2.<br><br>
[0015]   Such silanes include, for example, silicon tetrachloride, methyitrichlorosilane, dimethyldichlorosilane, phenylmethyidichlorosilane, phenyltrichlorosilane, diphenyldichlorosilane, vinyltrichlorosilane, hydridotrichlorosilane, divinyldichlorosilane, methylvinyidichlorosilane, phenylvinyldichlorosliane, hydridomethyldichlorosilane, hydridophenyldichlorosilane, hydridovinyidichlorosliane and dihydridodichlorosilane, and the like.<br>
[OOlo]   Thediaikyi ethers useful in this invention include, for example, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, ethylmethyl ether, n-butylmethyi ether, n-butylethyl ether, di-n-butyl ether, di-isobutyf ether, isobutylmethyl ether, and isobutylemyl ether, and the like. The preferred ether is diethyl ether.<br>
(0017]   For the formation of the.Grignard reagent, the solvent can be selected from ether, an aromatic haiogenated solvent, a mixture of a mixture of ether/aromatic haiogenated co-solvent, or a mixture of a mixture of ethers and an aromatic haiogenated solvent, and the like, h being preferred to use the mixture of an ether/aromatic haiogenated solvent so that the coupling reaction can be carried out in the presence of the aromatic haiogenated solvent, according to mis invention, without having to change solvents or remove additional solvents. For the coupling reaction, it is preferred to use a mixture of dialkyl ether and an aromatic haiogenated solvent [0018]   Further, for the coupling reaction between the Grignard reagent and the precursor organohalosilane, it is preferred that the amount of ether in the co-solvent mixture be as small as is possible and therefore, his preferred that the ratio of eiher to the aromatic haiogenated solvent be in  the range of about 022. to 0.5:2. [0019]   The inventors herein have discovered that this method provides very low viscosity slurries from which the MgCl2 can be separated easily and essentially completely and it leads to substantial improvements in mass transfer and allows for a significant reduction in the total amount of solvent required for the reaction when compared to prior art methods. Generally, this method does not require an initiator for the reaction.<br><br>
