				<td>SUB-TYPE SELECTIVE AMIDES OF DIAZABICYCLOALKANES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds that bind to and modulate the<br>
activity of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, to processes for preparing<br>
these compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds<br>
and to methods of using these compounds for treating a wide variety of conditions<br>
and disorders, including those associated with dysfunction of the central nervous<br>
system (CNS).<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The therapeutic potential of compounds that target neuronal nicotinic<br>
receptors (NNRs), also known as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), has<br>
been the subject of several recent reviews (see Breining et al., Ann. Rep. Med.<br>
Chem. 40: 3 (2005), Hogg and Bertrand, Curr. Drug Targets: CNS Neurol. Disord.<br>
3: 123 (2004), Suto and Zacharias, Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 8: 61 (2004), Dani<br>
et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 14: 1837 (2004), Bencherif and Schmitt, Curr.<br>
Drug Targets: CNS Neurol. Disord. 1: 349 (2002)). Among the kinds of<br>
indications for which NNR ligands have been proposed as therapies are cognitive<br>
disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit disorder and<br>
schizophrenia (Newhouse et al., Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 4: 36 (2004), Levin and<br>
Rezvani, Curr. Drug Targets: CNS Neurol. Disord. 1: 423 (2002), Graham et al.,<br>
Curr. Drug Targets: CNS Neurol. Disord. 1: 387 (2002), Ripoll et al., Curr. Med.<br>
Res. Opin. 20(7): 1057 (2004), and McEvoy and Allen, Curr. Drug Targets: CNS<br>
Neurol. Disord. 1: 433 (2002)); pain and inflammation (Decker et al., Curr. Top.<br>
Med. Chem. 4(3): 369 (2004), Vincler, Expert Opin. Invest. Drugs 14(10): 1191<br>
(2005), Jain, Curr. Opin. Inv. Drugs 5: 76 (2004), Miao et al., Neuroscience 123:<br>
777 (2004)); depression and anxiety (Shytle et al., Mol. Psychiatry 7: 525 (2002),<br>
Damaj et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 66: 675 (2004), Shytle et al., Depress. Anxiety 16:<br>
89 (2002)); neurodegeneration (O'Neill et al., Curr. Drug Targets: CNS Neurol.<br>
Disord. 1: 399 (2002), Takata et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 306: 772 (2003),<br>
Marrero et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 309: 16 (2004)); Parkinson's disease<br><br>
(Jonnala and Buccafusco, J. Neurosci. Res. 66: 565 (2001)); addiction (Dwoskin<br>
and Crooks, Biochem. Pharmacol. 63: 89 (2002), Coe et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem.<br>
Lett. 15(22): 4889 (2005)); obesity (Li et al., Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 3: 899<br>

(2004), Young et al., Clin. Ther. 23(4): 532 (2001)).<br>
A limitation of some nicotinic compounds is that they are associated with<br>
various undesirable side effects, for example, by stimulating muscle and ganglionic<br>
receptors. It would be desirable to have compounds, compositions and methods for<br>
preventing and/or treating various conditions or disorders (e.g., CNS disorders),<br>
including alleviating the symptoms of these disorders, where the compounds<br>
exhibit nicotinic pharmacology with a beneficial effect (e.g., upon the functioning<br>
of the CNS), but without significant associated side effects. It would further be<br>
highly desirable to provide compounds, compositions and methods that affect CNS<br>
function without significantly affecting those receptor subtypes which have the<br>
potential to induce undesirable side effects (e.g., appreciable activity at<br>
cardiovascular and skeletal muscle sites). The present invention provides such<br>
compounds, compositions and methods.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides certain amide compounds which can be<br>
formed from certain heteroaryl carboxylic acids and certain diazabicycloalkanes,<br>
particularly 3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane and 3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane.<br>
These amide compounds bind with high affinity to NNRs of the 42 subtype,<br>
found in the CNS, and exhibit selectivity for the 42 subtype over the 7 NNR<br>
subtype, also found in the CNS. The present invention also relates to<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts prepared from these compounds and the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof, which can be used for treating and/or<br>
preventing a wide variety of conditions or disorders, and particularly those<br>
disorders characterized by dysfunction of nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission<br>
or the degeneration of the nicotinic cholinergic neurons. Also provided are<br>
methods for treating and/or preventing disorders, such as CNS disorders, and also<br>
for treating certain conditions (e.g., alleviating pain and inflammation), in<br>
mammals in need of such treatment. The methods involve administering to a<br><br>
subject a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds (including salts) or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions including such compounds. Further provided is a<br>
method for treatment of disorders selected from the group consisting of age-<br>
associated memory impairment, mild cognitive impairment, pre-senile dementia<br>
(early onset Alzheimer's disease), senile dementia (dementia of the Alzheimer's<br>
type), Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, AIDS<br>
dementia complex, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity<br>
disorder, dyslexia, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and schizoaffective<br>
disorder. Even further provided is a method for treatment of disorders selected<br>
from the group consisting of the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the<br>
Alzheimer's type, attention deficit disorder, mild cognitive impairment and age<br>
associated memory impairment.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions incorporate a compound of the present<br>
invention which, when employed in effective amounts, interacts with relevant<br>
nicotinic receptor sites of a subject, and hence acts as a therapeutic agent to treat<br>
and prevent a wide variety of conditions and disorders. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions provide therapeutic benefit to individuals suffering from such<br>
disorders and exhibiting clinical manifestations of such disorders, in that the<br>
compounds within those compositions, when employed in effective amounts, can<br>
(i) exhibit nicotinic pharmacology and affect relevant nicotinic receptors sites (e.g.,<br>
act as a pharmacological agonist to activate nicotinic receptors), and/or (ii) elicit<br>
neurotransmitter secretion, and hence prevent and suppress the symptoms<br>
associated with those diseases. In addition, the compounds have the potential to (i)<br>
increase the number of nicotinic cholinergic receptors of the brain of the patient,<br>
(ii) exhibit neuroprotective effects, and/or (iii) when employed in effective<br>
amounts, to not cause appreciable adverse side effects (e.g., significant increases in<br>
blood pressure and heart rate, significant negative effects upon the gastro-intestinal<br>
tract, and significant effects upon skeletal muscle). The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising the compounds of the invention, are believed to be safe<br>
and effective with regards to prevention and treatment of a wide variety of<br>
conditions and disorders.<br>
The foregoing and other aspects of the present invention are explained in<br>
detail in the detailed description and examples set forth below.<br><br>

Detailed Description<br>
The subtype selective compounds, pharmaceutical compositions including<br>
these compounds, methods of preparing the compounds, and methods of treatment<br>
and/or prevention using the compounds are described in detail below.<br>
The compounds and methods described herein will be better understood<br>
with reference to the following preferred embothments. The following definitions<br>
will be useful in defining the scope of the invention:<br>

metal salts such as magnesium salt and calcium salt; ammonium salt; organic basic<br>
salts such as trimethylamine salt, triethylamine salt, pyridine salt, picoline salt,<br>
dicyclohexylamine salt, and N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine salt; and salts with<br>
basic amino acid such as lysine salt and arginine salt. The salts may be in some<br>
cases hydrates or ethanol solvates. Representative salts are provided as described<br>
in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,597,919 to Dull et al., 5,616,716 to Dull et al. and 5,663,356<br>
to Ruecroft et al.<br>
The compounds of Formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof<br>
may exist in solvated, for example hydrated, as well as unsolvated forms, and the<br>
present invention encompasses all such forms.<br>
As used herein, an "agonist" is a substance that stimulates its binding<br>
partner, typically a receptor. Stimulation is defined in the context of the particular<br>
assay, or may be apparent in the literature from a discussion herein that makes a<br>
comparison to a factor or substance that is accepted as an "agonist" or an<br>
"antagonist" of the particular binding partner under substantially similar<br>
circumstances as appreciated by those of skill in me art. Stimulation may be<br>
defined with respect to an increase in a particular effect or function that is induced<br>
by interaction of the agonist or partial agonist with a binding partner and can<br>
include allosteric effects.<br>
As used herein, an "antagonist" is a substance that inhibits its binding<br>
partner, typically a receptor. Inhibition is defined in the context of the particular<br>
assay, or may be apparent in the literature from a discussion herein that makes a<br>
comparison to a factor or substance that is accepted as an "agonist" or an<br>
"antagonist" of the particular binding partner under substantially similar<br>
circumstances as appreciated by those of skill in the art. Inhibition may be defined<br>
with respect to a decrease in a particular effect or function that is induced by<br>
interaction of the antagonist with a binding partner, and can include allosteric<br>
effects.<br>
As used herein, a "partial agonist" or a "partial antagonist" is a substance<br>
that provides a level of stimulation or inhibition, respectively, to its binding partner<br><br>
that is not fully or completely agonistic or antagonistic, respectively. It will be<br>
recognized that stimulation, and hence, inhibition is defined intrinsically for any<br>
substance or category of substances to be defined as agonists, antagonists, or partial<br>
agonists.<br>
As used herein, "intrinsic activity" or "efficacy" relates to some measure of<br>
biological effectiveness of the binding partner complex. With regard to receptor<br>
pharmacology, the context in which intrinsic activity or efficacy should be defined<br>
will depend on the context of the binding partner (e.g., receptor/ligand) complex<br>
and the consideration of an activity relevant to a particular biological outcome. For<br>
example, in some circumstances, intrinsic activity may vary depending on the<br>
particular second messenger system involved. See Hoyer, D. and Boddeke, H.,<br>
Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 14(7): 270-5 (1993). Where such contextually specific<br>
evaluations are relevant, and how they might be relevant in the context of the<br>
present invention, will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
As used herein, modulation of a receptor includes agonism, partial agonism,<br>
antagonism, partial antagonism, or inverse agonism of a receptor.<br>
As used herein, neurotransmitters whose release is mediated by the<br>
compounds described herein include, but are not limited to, acetylcholine,<br>
dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and glutamate, and the compounds described<br>
herein function as modulators at the <x4p2 subtype of the cns nnrs.></x4p2>

Compound Preparation<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared via the coupling<br>
of mono-protected diazabicycle (i.e., one in which one of the two amine functional<br>
groups is rendered un-reactive by suitable derivatization) with a suitably<br>
functionalized heteroaryl acid chloride or other reactive carboxylic acid derivative.<br>
There are numerous methods for preparing the mono-protected<br>
diazabicycles used to prepare the compounds of the present invention. Methods for<br>
the synthesis of a suitably protected 3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane are described in<br>
PCT WO 02/070523 to Colon-Cruz et al. and in U.S. application 2006/0019985 to<br>
Zhenkun et al., in which N-benzylmaleimide is condensed with either<br>
paraformaldehyde and N-benzylglycine or N-(methoxymethyl)-N-<br>
(trimethylsilylmethyl)benzylamine	to	produce	3,7-dibenzyl-3,7-<br>
diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane-2,4-dione	(also	known	as	2,5-<br>
dibenzyltetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-l,3-dione). Subsequent transformation of<br>
this intermediate can follow several paths. In one instance, treatment with a-<br>
chloroethylchloroformate produces 3-benzyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane-2,4-<br><br>
dione (also known as 24)enzyltetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-l,3-dione), which is<br>
then sequentially reduced (using borane-dimethylsulfide complex), converted into<br>
its N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl) derivative, and hydrogenated (to remove the second<br>
benzyl group).	This produces N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-<br>
diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane, which can be used in coupling with carboxylic acids,<br>
and their derivatives, to produce compounds of the present invention. Alternately,<br>
3,7-dibenzyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane-2,4-dione can be reduced (with lithium<br>
aluminum hydride), partially hydrogenated (to remove one benzyl group),<br>
converted into its N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl) derivative, and hydrogenated (to remove<br>
the second benzyl group), to produce N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-<br>
diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane. Other methods for installation and removal of the<br>
benzyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, and other amine protecting groups are well known by<br>
those skilled in the art and are described further in T. W. Greene and P.G. M.<br>
Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
New York (1999).<br>
An alternative preparation of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-<br>
diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane has been described in U.S. applications 2004/0186107 to<br>
Schrimpf et al. and 2005/0101602 to Basha et al., and involves the condensation of<br>
maleimide and N-(methoxymethyl)-N-(trimethylsilylmethyl)benzylamine to give 7-<br>
benzyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane-2,4-dione (also known as 5-<br>
benzyltetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-l,3-dione). Subsequent treatment with a<br>
reducing agent (e.g., lithium aluminum hydride) produces the 3-benzyl-3,7-<br>
diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane, the free amine of which can be protected by a tert-<br>
butoxycabonyl group, followed by removal of the benzyl protecting group by<br>
hydrogenolysis.<br>
Maleate esters can be used as alternatives to maleimides in these<br>
condensation reactions. Thus, according to PCT WO 96/007656 to Schaus et al.,<br>
condensation of N-benzylglycine with paraformaldehyde and dimethylmaleate will<br>
give N-benzyl-cis-3,4-pyrrolidinedicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester. This compound<br>
can then be reduced, for example, with lithium aluminum hydride, to give the diol,<br>
which can be further reacted with methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of<br>
triethylamine to produce the corresponding dimesylate. Further treatment with<br>
ammonia and heat provides the N-benzyl protected 3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane.<br><br>
As described above, this can be converted into N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-<br>
diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane.<br>
Suitable derivatives of 3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (bispidine) can be<br>
used to make compounds of the present invention. One such derivative is N-(tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, which can be made in a variety of<br>
ways. One synthesis proceeds through N-benzyl-N'-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-<br>
diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, described by Stead et al. in Org. Lett. 7: 4459 (2005).<br>
Thus the Mannich reaction between N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)piperidin-4-one,<br>
benzylamine and paraformaldehyde affords N-benzyl-N'-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-<br>
diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one, which can be treated sequentially with p-<br>
toluenesulfonhydrazide and sodium borohydride (to remove the carbonyl oxygen),<br>
giving N-benzyl-N'-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane. The<br>
benzyl group can be removed as described above to provide N-(tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane.	Alternative syntheses of<br>
diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes, suitable for conversion to either N-(tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane or another mono-protected<br>
derivative, have been described by Jeyaraman and Avila in Chem. Rev. 81(2): 149-<br>
174 (1981) and in U.S. Patent 5,468,858 to Berlin et al.<br>
One means of making amides of the present invention is to couple the either<br>
N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane or N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-<br>
3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane with a suitably functionalized carboxylic acid and<br>
then remove the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group. Many such carboxylic acids<br>
are commercially available, and others can be easily prepared by procedures known<br>
to those skilled in the art. The condensation of an amine and a carboxylic acid, to<br>
produce an amide, typically requires the use of a suitable activating agent, such as<br>
N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbothimide	(DCC),	(benzotriazol-1-<br>
yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium	hexafluorophosphate	(BOP),<br>
(benzotriazol-l-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP),<br>
0-(benzotriazol-1 -yl)-N,N,N',N'-bis(tetramethylene)urornum hexafluorophosphate<br>
(HBPyU),	O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetrametoyluromum<br>
hexafluorophosphate	(HBTU),	O-(benzotriazol-l-yl)-N,N,N',N'-<br>
tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), or (l-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)carbothimide) (EDCI) with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt).<br><br>
Other activating agents are well known to those skilled in the art (for example, see<br>
Kiso and Yajima, Peptides, pp 39-91, Academic Press, San Diego, CA (1995)).<br>
Alternatively, the amide bond can be formed by coupling a mono-protected<br>
diazabicycle with a suitably functionalized acid chloride, which may be available<br>
commercially or may be prepared by conversion of the suitably functionalized<br>
carboxylic acid. The acid chloride may be prepared by treatment of the appropriate<br>
carboxylic acid with, among other reagents, thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride.<br>
After amide formation, removal of the protecting group (e.g., the tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl group) with acid, either aqueous or anhydrous, will afford the<br>
compounds of the present invention.<br>
Those skilled in the art of organic synthesis will appreciate that there exist<br>
multiple means of producing compounds of the present invention which are labeled<br>
with a radioisotope appropriate to various diagnostic uses. Thus, condensation of a<br>
"C- or 18F-labeled heteroaromatic carboxylic acid with either N-(tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.O]octane or N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-<br>
diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, using the methods described above, and subsequent<br>
removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl group will produce a compound suitable for use<br>
in positron emission tomography.<br>
Methods of Treatment<br>
The compounds of the present invention are modulators of the 42 NNR<br>
subtype, characteristic of the CNS, and can be used for preventing and/or treating<br>
various conditions or disorders, including those of the CNS, in subjects which have<br>
or are susceptible to such conditions or disorders, by modulation of 42 NNRs.<br>
The compounds have the ability to selectively bind to the 42 NNRs and express<br>
nicotinic pharmacology (e.g., to act as agonists, partial agonists, antagonists and<br>
the like). For example, compounds of the present invention, when administered in<br>
effective amounts to patients in need thereof, provide some degree of prevention of<br>
the progression of the CNS disorder (i.e., providing protective effects),<br>
amelioration of the symptoms of the CNS disorder, and/or amelioration of the<br>
reoccurrence of the CNS disorder.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be used to treat and/or prevent<br>
those types of conditions and disorders for which other types of nicotinic<br><br>
compounds have been proposed as therapeutics. See, for example, the references<br>
previously listed in the "Background of the Invention" section, as well as Williams<br>
et al., Drug News Perspec. 7(4): 205 (1994), Arneric et al., CNS Drug Rev. 1(1): 1-<br>

al., 5,597,919 to Dull et al., 5,604,231 to Smith et al. and 5,852,041 to Cosford et<br>
al., the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
The compounds and their pharmaceutical compositions are useful in the<br>
treatment and/or prevention of a variety of CNS disorders, including<br>
neurodegenerative disorders, neuropsychiatric disorders, neurologic disorders, and<br>
addictions. The compounds and their pharmaceutical compositions can be used to<br>
treat and/or prevent cognitive deficits (age-related and otherwise), attentional<br>
disorders and dementias (including those due to infectious agents or metabolic<br>
disturbances); to provide neuroprotection; to treat convulsions and multiple<br>
cerebral infarcts; to treat mood disorders, compulsions and addictive behaviors; to<br>
provide analgesia; to control inflammation (such as mediated by cytokines and<br>
nuclear factor kappa B) and treat inflammatory disorders; to provide pain relief;<br>
and to treat infections (as anti-infectious agents for treating bacterial, fungal and<br>
viral infections). Among the disorders, diseases and conditions that the<br>
compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be used<br>
to treat and/or prevent are: age-associated memory impairment, mild cognitive<br>
impairment, pre-senile dementia (early onset Alzheimer's disease), senile dementia<br>
(dementia of the Alzheimer's type), Lewy body dementia, HIV-dementia, vascular<br>
dementia, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, AIDS dementia complex, attention deficit<br>
disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, schizophrenia,<br>
schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, Parkinsonism including<br>
Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease, Huntington's chorea, tardive dyskinesia,<br>
hyperkinesia, progressive supranuclear palsy, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, multiple<br><br>
sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, mania, anxiety, depression, panic<br>
disorders, bipolar disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive<br>
disorder, rage outbursts, Tourette's syndrome, autism, drug and alcohol addiction,<br>
tobacco addiction, obesity, cachexia, psoriasis, lupus, acute cholangitis, aphthous<br>
stomatitis, asthma, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, pouchitis, viral<br>
pneumonitis and arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis),<br>
endotoxaemia, sepsis, atherosclerosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and<br>
neoplasias.<br>
It is advantageous that the treatment or prevention of diseases, disorders<br>
and conditions occurs without appreciable adverse side effects (e.g., significant<br>
increases in blood pressure and heart rate, significant negative effects upon the<br>
gastro-intestinal tract, and significant effects upon skeletal muscle). The<br>
compounds of the present invention, when employed in effective amounts, can<br>
modulate the activity of the 42 NNRs without appreciable interaction with the<br>
nicotinic subtypes that characterize the human ganglia (as demonstrated by their<br>
lack of the ability of to elicit nicotinic function in adrenal chromaffin tissue) or<br>
skeletal muscle (as demonstrated by their lack of ability to elicit nicotinic function<br>
in cell preparations expressing muscle-type nicotinic receptors). Thus, these<br>
compounds are capable of treating and/or preventing diseases, disorders and<br>
conditions without eliciting significant side effects associated activity at ganglionic<br>
and neuromuscular sites. Thus, administration of the compounds provides a<br>
therapeutic window in which treatment of certain diseases, disorders and<br>
conditions is provided, and certain side effects are avoided. That is, an effective<br>
dose of the compound is sufficient to provide the desired effects upon the disease,<br>
disorder or condition, but is insufficient (i.e., is not at a high enough level) to<br>
provide undesirable side effects.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides the use of a compound or Formula I,<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in therapy (such as a therapy<br>
described above).<br>
In yet another aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound<br>
or Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for use in the treatment of a CNS disorder (such as a disorder, disease<br>
or condition described above).<br><br>
In a further aspect the invention provides the use of a compound of Formula<br>
I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for use in the treatment mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's<br>
type, attention deficit disorder, mild cognitive impairment and age associated<br>
memory impairment.<br>
Diagnostic Uses<br>
The compounds can be used in diagnostic compositions, such as probes,<br>
particularly when they are modified to include appropriate labels. The probes can<br>
be used, for example, to determine the relative number and/or function of specific<br>
receptors, particularly the a4|32 receptor subtype. For this purpose the compounds<br>
of the present invention most preferably are labeled with a radioactive isotopic<br>
moiety such as 11C, 18F, 76Br, 123I or 1251.<br>
The administered compounds can be detected using known detection<br>
methods appropriate for the label used. Examples of detection methods include<br>
position emission topography (PET) and single-photon emission computed<br>
tomography (SPECT). The radiolabels described above are useful in PET (e.g.,<br>
11C, 18F or 76Br) and SPECT (e.g., 123I) imaging, with half-lives of about 20.4<br>
minutes for 11C, about 109 minutes for 18F, about 13 hours for 123I, and about 16<br>
hours for 76Br. A high specific activity is desired to visualize the selected receptor<br>
subtypes at non-saturating concentrations. The administered doses typically are<br>
below the toxic range and provide high contrast images. The compounds are<br>
expected to be capable of administration in non-toxic levels. Determination of<br>
dose is carried out in a manner known to one skilled in the art of radiolabel<br>
imaging. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,969,144 to London et al.<br>
The compounds can be administered using known techniques. See, for<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. 5,969,144 to London et al. The compounds can be<br>
administered in formulation compositions that incorporate other ingredients, such<br>
as those types of ingredients that are useful in formulating a diagnostic<br>
composition. Compounds useful in accordance with carrying out the present<br>
invention most preferably are employed in forms of high purity. See, U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,853,696 to Elmalch et al.<br><br>
After the compounds are administered to a subject (e.g., a human subject),<br>
the presence of that compound within the subject can be imaged and quantified by<br>
appropriate techniques in order to indicate the presence, quantity, and functionality<br>
of selected NNR subtypes. In addition to humans, the compounds can also be<br>
administered to animals, such as mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. SPECT and PET<br>
imaging can be carried out using any appropriate technique and apparatus. See<br>
Villemagne et al., In: Arneric et al. (Eds.) Neuronal Nicotinic Receptors:<br>
Pharmacology and Therapeutic Opportunities, 235-250 (1998) and U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,853,696 to Elmalch et al. for a disclosure of representative imaging<br>
techniques.<br>
The radiolabeled compounds bind with high affinity to selective NNR<br>
subtypes (e.g., 42) and preferably exhibit negligible non-specific binding to<br>
other nicotinic cholinergic receptor subtypes (e.g., those receptor subtypes<br>
associated with muscle and ganglia). As such, the compounds can be used as<br>
agents for noninvasive imaging of nicotinic cholinergic receptor subtypes within<br>
the body of a subject, particularly within the brain for diagnosis associated with a<br>
variety of CNS diseases and disorders.<br>
In one aspect, the diagnostic compositions can be used in a method to<br>
diagnose disease in a subject, such as a human patient. The method involves<br>
administering to that patient a detectably labeled compound as described herein,<br>
and detecting the binding of that compound to selected NNR subtypes (e.g., 42<br>
receptor subtype). Those skilled in the art of using diagnostic tools, such as PET<br>
and SPECT, can use the radiolabeled compounds described herein to diagnose a<br>
wide variety of conditions and disorders, including conditions and disorders<br>
associated with dysfunction of the central and autonomic nervous systems. Such<br>
disorders include a wide variety of CNS diseases and disorders, including<br>
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. These and other<br>
representative diseases and disorders that can be evaluated include those that are<br>
set forth in U.S. Patent No. 5,952,339 to Bencherif et al.<br>
In another aspect, the diagnostic compositions can be used in a method to<br>
monitor selective nicotinic receptor subtypes of a subject, such as a human patient.<br>
The method involves administering a detectably labeled compound as described<br><br>
herein to that patient and detecting the binding of that compound to selected<br>
nicotinic receptor subtypes (e.g., the 42 receptor subtype).<br>

According to one embothment of the present invention there is provided a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising as active ingredient a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a compound of the present invention, in association with one<br>
or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, excipients and/or inert carriers.<br>
The manner in which the compounds are administered can vary. The<br>
compositions are preferably administered orally (e.g., in liquid form within a<br>
solvent such as an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or within a solid carrier).<br>
Preferred compositions for oral administration include pills, tablets, capsules,<br>
caplets, syrups, and solutions, including hard gelatin capsules and time-release<br>
capsules. Compositions may be formulated in unit dose form, or in multiple or<br>
subunit doses. Preferred compositions are in liquid or semisolid form.<br>
Compositions including a liquid pharmaceutically inert carrier such as water or<br>
other pharmaceutically compatible liquids or semisolids may be used. The use of<br>
such liquids and semisolids is well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
The compositions can also be administered via injection, i.e., intravenously,<br>
intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intraarteriaHy, intrathecally, and<br>
intracerebroventricularly. Intravenous administration is a preferred method of<br>
injection. Suitable carriers for injection are well known to those of skill in the art,<br>
and include 5% dextrose solutions, saline, and phosphate buffered saline. The<br>
compounds can also be administered as an infusion or injection (e.g., as a<br>
suspension or as an emulsion in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or mixture of<br>
liquids).<br>
The formulations may also be administered using other means, for example,<br>
rectal administration. Formulations useful for rectal administration, such as<br>
suppositories, are well known to those of skill in the art. The compounds can also<br>
be administered by inhalation (e.g., in the form of an aerosol either nasally or using<br>
delivery articles of the type set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,922,901 to Brooks et al.,<br>
the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety); topically (e.g., in<br>
lotion form); transdermally (e.g., using a transdermal patch, using technology that<br><br>
is commercially available from Novartis and Alza Corporation, or by powder<br>
injection); or by buccal, sublingual or intranasal absorption. Although it is possible<br>
to administer the compounds in the form of a bulk active chemical, it is preferred<br>
to present each compound in the form of a pharmaceutical composition or<br>
formulation for efficient and effective administration.<br>
Exemplary methods for administering such compounds will be apparent to<br>
the skilled artisan. The usefulness of these formulations may depend on the<br>
particular composition used and the particular subject receiving the treatment. For<br>
example, the compositions can be administered in the form of a tablet, a hard<br>
gelatin capsule or as a time release capsule. These formulations may contain a<br>
liquid carrier that may be oily, aqueous, emulsified or contain certain solvents<br>
suitable to the mode of administration.<br>
The administration of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein<br>
can be intermittent, or at a gradual, continuous, constant or controlled rate to a<br>
warm-blooded animal, (e.g., a mammal such as a mouse, rat, cat, rabbit, dog, pig,<br>
cow, or monkey); but advantageously is preferably administered to a human being.<br>
In addition, the time of day and the number of times per day that the<br>
pharmaceutical composition is administered can vary.<br>
The appropriate dose of the compound is that amount effective to prevent<br>
occurrence of the symptoms of the disorder or to treat some symptoms of the<br>
disorder from which the patient suffers. By "effective amount", "therapeutic<br>
amount" or "effective dose" is meant that amount sufficient to elicit the desired<br>
pharmacological or therapeutic effects, thus resulting in effective prevention or<br>
treatment of the disorder. Thus, when treating a CNS disorder, an effective amount<br>
of compound is an amount sufficient to pass across the blood-brain barrier of the<br>
subject, to bind to relevant receptor sites in the brain of the subject, and to<br>
modulate the activity of relevant nicotinic receptor subtypes (e.g., modulate<br>
neurotransmitter secretion, thus resulting in effective prevention or treatment of the<br>
disorder). Prevention of the disorder is manifested by delaying the onset of the<br>
symptoms of the disorder. Treatment of the disorder is manifested by a decrease in<br>
the symptoms associated with the disorder or an amelioration of the reoccurrence<br>
of the symptoms of the disorder.<br>
The effective dose can vary, depending upon factors such as the condition<br><br>
of the patient, the severity of the symptoms of the disorder, and the manner in<br>
which the pharmaceutical composition is administered. For human patients, the<br>
effective dose of typical compounds generally requires administering the<br>
compound in an amount sufficient to modulate disease-relevant receptors to affect<br>
neurotransmitter (e.g., dopamine) release but the amount should be insufficient to<br>
induce effects on skeletal muscles and ganglia to any significant degree. The<br>
effective dose of compounds will of course differ from patient to patient but in<br>
general includes amounts starting where CNS effects or other desired therapeutic<br>
effects occur, but below the amount where muscular and ganglionic effects are<br>
observed.<br>
Typically, to be administered in an effective dose, compounds require<br>
administering in an amount of less than 5 mg/kg of patient weight. Often, the<br>
compounds may be administered in an amount from less than about 1 mg/kg<br>
patient weight to less than about 100 µg/kg of patient weight, and occasionally<br>
between about 10 µg/kg to less than 100 µg/kg of patient weight. The foregoing<br>
effective doses typically represent that amount administered as a single dose, or as<br>
one or more doses administered over a 24 hours period. For human patients, the<br>
effective dose of the compounds may require administering the compound in an<br>
amount of at least about 1, but not more than about 1000, and often not more than<br>
about 500 mg/ 24 hr/ patient.<br>
Compositions useful as diagnostics can be employed, as set forth in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,853,696 to Elmalch et al. and 5,969,144 to London et al., the<br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The compounds also can<br>
be administered in formulation compositions that incorporate other ingredients,<br>
such as those types of ingredients that are useful in formulating a diagnostic<br>
composition.<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the present invention, and<br>
should not be construed as limiting thereof. In these examples, all parts and<br>
percentages are by weight, unless otherwise noted.<br><br><br>
Preparation of membranes from rat cortex; Rats (female, Sprague-Dawley),<br>
weighing 150-250 g, were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and were allowed<br>
free access to water and food supplied by PMI Nutrition International, Inc.<br>
Animals were anesthetized with 70% CO2, and then decapitated. Brains were<br>
removed and placed on an ice-cold platform. The cerebral cortex was removed and<br>
placed in 20 volumes (weight:volume) of ice-cold preparative buffer (137 mM<br>
NaCl, 10.7 mM KC1, 5.8 mM KH2PO4, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 20 mM HEPES (free<br>
acid), 5 mM iodoacetamide, 1-6 mM EDTA, pH 7.4); PMSF, dissolved in<br>
methanol to a final concentration of 100 µM, was added and the suspension was<br>
homogenized by Polytron. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 20<br>
min at 4°C and the resulting pellet was re-suspended in 20 volumes of ice-cold<br>
water. After 60 min incubation on ice, a new pellet was collected by centrifugation<br>
at 18,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C. The final pellet was re-suspended in 10 volumes<br>
of buffer and stored at -20°C.<br>
Preparation of membranes from SH-EPl/human 42 clonal cells: Cell<br>
pellets from 40 150 mm culture dishes were pooled, and homogenized by Polytron<br>
(Kinematica GmbH, Switzerland) in 20 milliliters of ice-cold preparative buffer.<br>
The homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The resulting<br>
pellet was re-suspended in 20 mL of ice-cold preparative buffer and stored at -<br>
20°C.<br>
On the day of the assay, the frozen membranes were thawed and spun at<br>
48,000 x g for 20 min. The supernatant was decanted and discarded. The pellet<br>
was resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Life<br>
Technologies) pH 7.4 and homogenized with the Polytron for 6 seconds. Protein<br>
concentrations were determined using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, with<br>
bovine serum albumin as the standard (Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL).<br>
Membrane preparations (approximately 50 ug for human and 200-300 ug<br>
protein for rat 42) were incubated in PBS (50 L and 100 µL respectively) in the<br>
presence of competitor compound (0.01 nM to 100 µM) and 5 nM [3H]nicotine for<br>
2-3 hours on ice. Incubation was terminated by rapid filtration on a multi-manifold<br>
tissue harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) using GF/B filters presoaked in<br>
0.33% polyethyleneimine (w/v) to reduce non-specific binding. Tissue was rinsed<br><br>
3 times in PBS, pH 7.4. Scintillation fluid was added to filters containing the<br>
washed tissue and allowed to equilibrate. Filters were then counted to determine<br>
radioactivity bound to the membranes by liquid scintillation counting (2200CA Tri-<br>
Carb LSC, Packard Instruments, 50% efficiency or Wallac Trilux 1450 MicroBeta,<br>
40% efficiency, Perkin Elmer).<br>
Data were expressed as disintegrations per minute (DPMs). Within each<br>
assay, each point had 2-3 replicates. The replicates for each point were averaged<br>
and plotted against the log of the drug concentration. IC50, which is the<br>
concentration of the compound that produces 50% inhibition of binding, was<br>
determined by least squares non-linear regression. Ki values were calculated using<br>
the Cheng-Prussof equation (1973):<br><br>
where N is the concentration of [3H]nicotine and Kd is the affinity of nicotine (3<br>
nM, determined in a separate experiment).<br>
7 nAChR Subtype<br>
Rats (female, Sprague-Dawley), weighing 150-250 g, were maintained on a<br>
12 h light/dark cycle and were allowed free access to water and food supplied by<br>
PMI Nutrition International, Inc. Animals were anesthetized with 70% CO2, then<br>
decapitated. Brains were removed and placed on an ice-cold platform. The<br>
hippocampus was removed and placed in 10 volumes (weightrvolume) of ice-cold<br>
preparative buffer (137 mM NaCl, 10.7 mM KC1, 5.8 mM KH2PO4, 8 mM<br>
Na2HPO4, 20 mM HEPES (free acid), 5 mM iodoacetamide, 1-6 mM EDTA, pH<br>
7.4); PMSF, dissolved in methanol to a final concentration of 100 µM, was added<br>
and the tissue suspension was homogenized by Polytron. The homogenate was<br>
centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C and the resulting pellet was re-<br>
suspended in 10 volumes of ice-cold water. After 60 min incubation on ice, a new<br>
pellet was collected by centrifugation at 18,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C. The final<br>
pellet was re-suspended in 10 volumes of buffer and stored at -20°C. On the day of<br>
the assay, tissue was thawed, centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 20 min, and then re-<br>
suspended in ice-cold PBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, 138 mM NaCl,<br><br>
2.67 mM KC1, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM<br>
MgCl2, Invitrogen/Gibco, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of approximately 2 mg<br>
protein/mL. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem.<br>
193: 265 (1951), using bovine serum albumin as the standard.<br>
The binding of [3H]MLA was measured using a modification of the<br>
methods of Davies et al., Neuropharmacol. 38: 679 (1999). [3H]MLA (Specific<br>
Activity = 25-35 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Tocris. The binding of [3H]MLA<br>
was determined using a 2 h incubation at 21°C. Incubations were conducted in 48-<br>
well micro-titre plates and contained about 200 µg of protein per well in a final<br>
incubation volume of 300 µL. The incubation buffer was PBS and the final<br>
concentration of [3H]MLA was 5 nM. The binding reaction was terminated by<br>
filtration of the protein containing bound ligand onto glass fiber filters (GF/B,<br>
Brandel) using a Brandel Tissue Harvester at room temperature. Filters were<br>
soaked in de-ionized water containing 0.33% polyethyleneimine to reduce non-<br>
specific binding. Each filter was washed with PBS (3 x 1 mL) at room<br>
temperature. Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 50 µM non-<br>
radioactive MLA in selected wells.<br>
The inhibition of [3H]MLA binding by test compounds was determined by<br>
including seven different concentrations of the test compound in selected wells.<br>
Each concentration was replicated in triplicate. IC50 values were estimated as the<br>
concentration of compound that inhibited 50 percent of specific [3H]MLA binding.<br>
Inhibition constants (Ki values), reported in nM, were calculated from the IC50<br>
values using the method of Cheng et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22: 3099-3108<br>
(1973).<br>
Example 2: Determination of Dopamine Release<br>
Dopamine release was measured using striatal synaptosomes obtained from<br>
rat brain, according to the procedures set forth by Rapier et al., J. Neurochem. 54:<br>
937 (1990). Rats (female, Sprague-Dawley), weighing 150-250 g, were maintained<br>
on a 12 h light/dark cycle and were allowed free access to water and food supplied<br>
by PMI Nutrition International, Inc. Animals were anesthetized with 70% CO2,<br>
then decapitated. The brains were quickly removed and the striata dissected.<br>
Striatal tissue from each of 2 rats was pooled and homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 M<br>
sucrose (5 mL) containing 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, using a glass/glass homogenizer.<br><br>
The tissue was then centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded<br>
and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 20 min. The resulting pellet<br>
was re-suspended in perfusion buffer containing monoamine oxidase inhibitors<br>
(128 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 2.4 mM KCl, 3.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4,<br>
25 mM HEPES, 1 mM ascorbic acid, 0.02 mM pargyline HC1 and 10 mM glucose,<br>
pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 15 min at 25,000 x g. The final pellet was resuspended<br>
in perfusion buffer (1.4 mL) for immediate use.<br>
The synaptosomal suspension was incubated for 10 min at 37°C to restore<br>
metabolic activity. [3H]Dopamine ([3H]DA, specific activity = 28.0 Ci/mmol,<br>
NEN Research Products) was added at a final concentration of 0.1 µM and the<br>
suspension was incubated at 37°C for another 10 min. Aliquots of tissue (50 µL)<br>
and perfusion buffer (100 µL) were loaded into the suprafusion chambers of a<br>
Brandel Suprafusion System (series 2500, Gaithersburg, MD). Perfusion buffer<br>
(room temperature) was pumped into the chambers at a rate of 1.5 mL/min for a<br>
wash period of 16 min. Test compound (10 µM) or nicotine (10 µM) was then<br>
applied in the perfusion stream for 48 sec. Fractions (24 sec each) were<br>
continuously collected from each chamber throughout the experiment to capture<br>
basal release and agonist-induced peak release and to re-establish the baseline after<br>
the agonist application. The perfusate was collected directly into scintillation vials,<br>
to which scintillation fluid was added. [3H]DA released was quantified by<br>
scintillation counting. For each chamber, the integrated area of the peak was<br>
normalized to its baseline.<br>
Release was expressed as a percentage of release obtained with an equal<br>
concentration of L-nicotine. Within each assay, each test compound was replicated<br>
using 2-3 chambers; replicates were averaged. When appropriate, dose-response<br>
curves of test compound were determined. The maximal activation for individual<br>
compounds (Emax) was determined as a percentage of the maximal activation<br>
induced by L-nicotine. The compound concentration resulting in half maximal<br>
activation (EC50) of specific ion flux was also defined.<br>
Example 3: Selectivity vs. Peripheral nAChRs<br>
Interaction at the Human Muscle nAChR Subtype<br>
Activation of muscle-type nAChRs was established on the human clonal<br><br>
line TE671/RD, which is derived from an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (Stratton<br>
et al., Carcinogen 10: 899 (1989)). These cells express receptors that have<br>
pharmacological (Lukas, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 251: 175 (1989)),<br>
electrophysiological (Oswald et al., Neurosci. Lett. 96: 207 (1989)), and molecular<br>
biological profiles (Luther et al., J. Neurosci. 9: 1082 (1989)) similar to the<br>
muscle-type nAChR.<br>
TE671/RD cells were maintained in proliferative growth phase according<br>
to routine protocols (Bencherif et al., Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2: 52 (1991) and<br>
Bencherif et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 257: 946 (1991)). Cells were cultured in<br>
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco/BRL) with 10% horse serum<br>
(Gibco/BRL), 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan UT), ImM sodium<br>
pyruvate, 4 mM L-Glutamine, and 50,000 units penicillin-streptomycin (Irvine<br>
Scientific). When cells were 80% confluent, they were plated to 12 well<br>
polystyrene plates (Costar). Experiments were conducted when the cells reached<br>
100%confluency.<br>
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function was assayed using 86Rb+<br>
efflux according to the method described by Lukas et al., Anal. Biochem. 175: 212<br>
(1988). On the day of the experiment, growth media was gently removed from the<br>
well and growth media containing 86Rubidium chloride (106 µCi/mL) was added to<br>
each well. Cells were incubated at 37°C for a minimum of 3 h. After the loading<br>
period, excess 8 Rb+ was removed and the cells were washed twice with label-free<br>
Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (138 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KC1, 1.47 mM<br>
KH2PO4, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 0.9 mM CaCl2,0.5 mM MgCl2, Invitrogen/Gibco, pH.<br>
7.4), taking care not to disturb the cells. Next, cells were exposed to either 100 uM<br>
of test compound, 100 uM of L-nicotine (Acros Organics) or buffer alone for 4<br>
min. Following the exposure period, the supernatant containing the released 86Rb+<br>
was removed and transferred to scintillation vials. Scintillation fluid was added<br>
and released radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
Within each assay, each point had 2 replicates, which were averaged. The<br>
amount of 86Rb+ release was compared to both a positive control (100 µM L-<br>
nicotine) and a negative control (buffer alone) to determine the percent release<br>
relative to that of L-nicotine.<br>
When appropriate, dose-response curves of test compound were<br><br>
determined. The maximal activation for individual compounds (Emax) was<br>
determined as a percentage of the maximal activation induced by L-nicotine. The<br>
compound concentration resulting in half maximal activation (EC50) of specific ion<br>
flux was also determined.<br>
Interaction at the Rat Ganglionic nAChR Subtype<br>
Activation of rat ganglion nAChRs was established on the<br>
pheochromocytoma clonal line PC 12, which is a continuous clonal cell line of<br>
neural crest origin, derived from a tumor of the rat adrenal medulla. These cells<br>
express ganglion-like nAChR s (see Whiting et al., Nature 327: 515 (1987); Lukas,<br>
J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 251: 175 (1989); Whiting et al., Mol. Brain Res. 10: 61<br>
(1990)).<br>
Rat PC 12 cells were maintained in proliferative growth phase according to<br>
routine protocols (Bencherif et al., Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2: 52 (1991) and Bencherif<br>
et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 257: 946 (1991)). Cells were cultured in<br>
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco/BRL) with 10% horse serum<br>
(Gibco/BRL), 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan UT), ImM sodium<br>
pyruvate, 4 mM L-Glutamine, and 50,000 units penicillin-streptomycin (Irvine<br>
Scientific). When cells were 80% confluent, they were plated to 12 well Nunc<br>
plates (Nunclon) and coated with 0.03% poly-L-lysine (Sigma, dissolved in 100<br>
mM boric acid). Experiments were conducted when the cells reached 80%<br>
confluency.<br>
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function was assayed using 86Rb+<br>
efflux according to a method described by Lukas et al., Anal. Biochem. 175: 212<br>
(1988). On the day of the experiment, growth media was gently removed from the<br>

Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (138 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KC1, 1.47 mM<br>
KH2P04, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, Invitrogen/Gibco, pH.<br>
7.4), taking care not to disturb the cells. Next, cells were exposed to either 100 µM<br>
of test compound, 100 µM of nicotine or buffer alone for 4 min. Following the<br>
exposure period, the supernatant containing the released 86Rb+ was removed and<br>
transferred to scintillation vials. Scintillation fluid was added and released<br><br>
radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting<br>
Within each assay, each point had 2 replicates, which were averaged. The<br>
amount of 86Rb+ release was compared to both a positive control (100 µM nicotine)<br>
and a negative control (buffer alone) to determine the percent release relative to<br>
that of L-nicotine.<br>

determined. The maximal activation for individual compounds (Emax) was<br>
determined as a percentage of the maximal activation induced by L-nicotine. The<br>
compound concentration resulting in half maximal activation (EC50) of specific ion<br>
flux was also determined.<br>
Interaction at the Human Ganglionic nAChR Subtype<br>
The cell line SH-SY5Y is a continuous line derived by sequential<br>
subcloning of the parental cell line, SK-N-SH, which was originally obtained from<br>
a human peripheral neuroblastoma. SH-SY5Y cells express a ganglion-like<br>
nAChR (Lukas et al., Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 4: 1 (1993)).<br>
Human SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in proliferative growth phase<br>
according to routine protocols (Bencherif et al., Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2: 52 (1991)<br>
and Bencherif et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 257: 946 (1991)). Cells were<br>
cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco/BRL) with 10% horse<br>

Example 4: Novel Object Recognition (NOR) Task<br>
The novel object recognition (NOR) task was performed in accord with the<br>
description of Ennaceur and Delacour Behav. Brain Res. 100: 85-92 (1988).<br>
Synthetic Examples<br>
Example 5: Synthesis of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-<br>
diazabicyclo [3.3.0] octane<br>
Example 5 relates to the synthesis of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,7-<br>
diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane, which was prepared as described in U.S. applications<br>
2004/0186107 to Schrimpf et al. and 2005/0101602 to Basha et al., according to<br>
the following techniques:<br>
5-Benzyltetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-l,3-dione(or 7-benzyl-3,7-<br>
diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2,4-dione)<br>
Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 0.50 mL, 6.5 mmol) was added to a cold (0°C)<br>
solution of maleimide (6.27 g, 0.0646 mol) in dichloromethane (150 mL) under<br>
nitrogen. A solution of N-(memoxymemyl)-N-(trimethylsilylmethyl)benzylamine<br>
(20 g, 0.084 mol) in dichloromethane (100 mL) was added drop-wise over 45 min.<br>
After the addition was complete, the mixture was warmed slowly to ambient<br>
temperature and stirred for 16 h. The mixture was concentrated and the resulting<br><br>

Example 11: Tabular Spectral and Receptor Binding Data<br>
The above illustrated amide coupling procedures were utilized to make the<br>
compounds shown in Tables 1 and 2. In some cases, compounds were synthesized<br>
on a scale sufficient to obtain nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data. In other<br>
cases, compounds were produced on a smaller scale in various kinds of parallel<br>
synthesis apparatus and were (structurally) characterized by LCMS only.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Summary of Biological Data<br>
Compounds of Tables 1 and 2, representative of the present invention,<br>
exhibited inhibition constants (Ki values) at the rat and human 42 subtypes in<br>
the ranges of 1 nM to 1000 nM and 1 nM to 220 nM respectively, indicating high<br>
affinity for the 42 subtype. Ki values at the 7 subtype vary within the range of<br>
1700 nM to 210,000 nM (in many cases the compounds did not bind sufficiently in<br>
high through-put screening at the 7 subtype to warrant Ki determination). These<br>
same compounds exhibited relatively little functional activity at either the human<br>
muscle (1-25% of the maximal response to nicotine) or human ganglion (1-20% of<br>
the maximal response to nicotine) subtypes.<br>
Certain exemplified compounds were assessed in the NOR task. Thus, both<br>
N-(5-chlorofuran-2-ylcarbonyl)-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane (Figure 1) and N-(5-<br>
chlorofuran-2-ylcarbonyl)-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (Figure 2) were active in<br>
OR in rats, at 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg respectively. This provides evidence of the<br>
efficacy (and potency) of the compounds of the present invention in treating<br>
cognitive deficits, attentional disorders and dementias, and the potential of these<br>
compounds for human therapy.<br>

Compounds, pharmaceutical compositions including the compounds, and methods of preparation and use thereof<br>
are disclosed. The compounds are amide compounds which can be prepared from certain heteoraryl carboxylic acids and certain<br>
diazabicycloalkanes. The compounds exhibit selectivity for, and bind with high affinity to, neuronal nicotinic receptors of the a4B2<br>
subtype in the central nervous system (CNS). The compounds and compositions can be used to treat and/or prevent a wide variety<br>
of conditions or disorders, particuarly CNS disorders. The compounds can: (i) alter the number of nicotinic cholinergic receptors of<br>
the brain of the patient, (ii) exhibit neuroprotective effects, and (iii) when employed in effective amounts, not result in appreciable<br>
adverse side effects (e.g. side effects such as significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate, significant negative effects upon<br>
the gastrointestinal tract, and significant effects upon skeletal muscle).</td>
