Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention 1 clates to an apparatus for detecting motion vectors, and, more particularly, to an apparatus for determining a motion vector of a search block by using motion vectors of neighboring blocks of the search block.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
As is well known, transmission of digitized video signals can deliver video images of a much higher quality then those delivered via transmission of analog signals When an image signal comprising a sequence of image "frames" is expressed in a digital form, a substantial amount of data is generated for transmission, especially in the case of a high definition television (HDTV) system. Since, however, the available frequency bandwidth of a conventional transmission channel is limited, in order to transmit the substantial amounts of digital data through the limited channel bandwidth, it is inevitable to compress or reduce the volume of the transmission data Among various video compression techniques, the so-called hybrid coding technique, which<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
combines temporal and spatial compression techniques together with a statistical coding technique, is known to be most effective.<br>
Most hybrid coding techniques employ a motion compensated DPCM(differential pulse code modulation), two-dimensional DCT(discrete cosine transform), quantization of DCT coefficients, and VLC(variable length coding). The motion compensated DPCM is a process of determining the movement of an object between a current frame and a previous frame, and predicting the current frame according to the motion flow of the object to produce a differential signal representing the difference between the current frame and its prediction.<br>
The two-dimensional DCT, which reduces or removes spatial redundancies between image data such as motion compensated DPCM data, converts a block of digital image data, for example, a block of 8 x 8 pixels, into a set of transform coefficient data. This technique is described in, e.g., Chen and Pratt, "Scene Adaptive Coder", IEEE Transactions on Communications, COM-32, No. 3, pp. 225-232(March 1984) . By processing such transform coefficient data with a quantizer, zigzag scanning, and VLC, the amount of data to be transmitted can be effectively compressed.<br>
Specifically, in the motion compensated DPCM, current frame data is predicted from previous frame data based on an estimation of the motion between the current and the previous frames. Such estimated motion may be described in terms of<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
two dimensional motion vectors representing the displacement of pixels between the previous and the current frames.<br>
One of the methods which have been used most frequently in estimating the displacement of an object in a video sequence is the block matching algorithm. According to the block matching algorithm, a current frame is divided into a plurality of search blocks. The size of a search block typically ranges between 8x8 and 32 x 32 pixels. To determine a motion vector for a search block in the current frame, a similarity calculation is performed between the search block of the current frame and each of a plurality of equal-sized candidate blocks included in a generally larger search region within a previous frame. An error function such as the mean absolute error or mean square error is used to carry out a similarity measurement between the search block of the current frame and each of the candidate blocks in the search region. And a motion vector, by definition, represents the displacement between the search block and a candidate block which yields a minimum error function. Since the search block is compared with all possible candidate blocks within a search region corresponding to the search block (i.e., full search block matching), there occurs heavy computational requirement, which in turn exacts a complex hardware having the capability of very high speed processing and/or a large number of processors for real-time processing.<br>
In light of the severe computational demands in a full<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
search block matching procedure described above, slmplified algorithms such as a three step search and a search for a minimum distortion have been proposed (see, e.g., J.R. Jain et al. , "Displacement Measurement and Its Application in Interframe Image Coding", IEEE Transactions of Communications COM-29, No. 12, pp. 1799-1808 (December 1981)).<br>
Although these simplified searching methods may reduce the computational burden and the hardware requirement, they still involve a considerable amount of computation.<br>
Typically, a motion in a video sequence may be focalized upon an object with most of its background stationary or the motion may be simply translational, e.g., as in case of a camera panning. In such event, there may be found a number of motion vectors virtually with an identical value in a frame of the video sequence. Especially, a motion vector of a block may have a correlation with motion vectors of neighboring blocks, which can be utilized in reducing the computational burden required to determining the motion vectors.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is, therefore, a primary object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for determining a motion vector of a search block by using motion vectors of neighboring blocks of the search block.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for determining a motion vector of a search block included in a search frame of a video signal by using motion vectors of processed neighboring blocks, wherein the search frame is divided into a multiplicity of blocks which include a set of processed block whose motion vectors have been determined, and the set of processed blocks contain the processed neighboring blocks which are the blocks neighboring the search block, the apparatus comprising: a motion vector detection block for selecting a candidate motion vector among the motion vectors of the processed neighboring blocks and a 0 vector, providing the candidate morion vectors as the motion vector of the search block in case a distortion betwen the search block and a predicted block corresponding to the candidate motion vector is smaller than a predetermined threshold value, and providing a full search trigger signal in case the distortion is not smaller than the predetermined threshold value, whetein the predicted block corresponding to the candidate motion vector is a block included in a reference frame of the video signal displaced from the search block by the candidate motion vector; and a full search block for determining the motion vector of the search block by using a full search block matching in response to the full search trigger signal.<br><br>

Brief Description of the According Drawings<br>
The above and other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments given in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of the motion vector detecting apparatus of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 provides a detailed block diagram of a motion vector detection block shown in Fig. 1;<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a block diagram of a motion vector detecting apparatus of the present invention.<br>
A current frame and a previous frame (in other words, a search frame and a reference frame) of a video signal are inputted to a motion vector detection block 100 and a full<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
search block 200. At the motion vector detection block 100, to find a motion vector of a search block, i.e., a block currently being processed, motion vectors of processed neighboring blocks of the search block together with a 0 vector are examined to select a candidate motion vector, wherein processed blocks refers to blocks whose motion vectors are determined and the processed neighboring blocks are processed blocks neighboring the search block.<br>
The processed neighboring blocks whose motion vectors are utilized in detecting the motion vector of the search block B( i, j) are exemplified in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4, the search frame consists of a multiplicity of slices, each of which includes a number of blocks, the number of slices and the number of blocks in each slice being N2 and N1, respectively. The search frame are processed from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. Therefore, among 9 neighboring blocks surrounding the search block B(i,j), motion vectors of 4 neighboring blocks, i.e., an upper left block B(i-1, j-1), an upper middle block B(i,j-1), an upper right block B(i+l,j-l), and a middle left block B(i-l,j), are known when the search block is processed, wherein j represents a slice number and i designates a location of a block in a slice, i and j being positive integers not larger than N1 and N2, respectively. It can be easily known that, if a search block is not located on the boundary of a frame, the number of processed neighboring blocks is 4. In case the search block<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
is on the boundary as in the case of B(1,l), B(1/2) and so on, the number of processed neighboring blocks may be less than 4.<br>
After the candidate motion vector is determined, a distortion between the search block and a predicted block corresponding to the candidate motion vector is compared with a predetermined threshold, wherein a predicted block corresponding to a vector is determined as a block of the reference frame which is displaced from the search block by the vector.<br>
If the distortion between the search block and the predicted block corresponding to the candidate motion vector is smaller than the threshold, the candidate motion vector is decided as a motion vector of the search block and provided on a line L300 through the full search block 200. Otherwise, a full search trigger signal is applied to the full search block 200 which detects a motion vector of the search block by using a full search block matching method in response to the full search trigger signal. The full search block 200 provides either the motion vector provided from the motion vector detection block 100 or the motion vector determined therein. The motion vector provided from the full search block 200 is fed back to the motion vector detection block 100, to be used in detecting motion vectors of subseguent blocks, e.g., B(i+1,j), of the current frame.<br>
In the present invention, the motion vector of the search block is either selected among the motion vectors of the<br><br>
-9-<br>
processed neighboring blocks or decided by using the full search block matching. Therefore, the amount of computation is reduced compared to a motion estimator usxng only the full search block matching. Especially, the reduction is more prominent for a video signal wherein moving objects occupy a small portion thereof, because neighboring blocks are likely to yield similar motion vectors.<br>
In case processed neighboring blocks of a search block are less than 4 blocks, as in the case of B( 1,1), B( 1, 2 ) , B(l,3), B(2,l), B(3,l) and so on, the operation of the motion vector detection block 100 may be disabled and the motion vector of the search block may be determined by using the full search block matching method. Alternatively, if at least one processed neighboring block exists, for example, in the case of the search blocks B(l,2), B(l,3), B(2,l), B(3,l) and so on, the motion vector detection block 100 may operate in a similar manner to the cases of 4 processed neighboring blocks.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, there is provided a detailed block diagram of the motion vector detection block 100 shown in Fig. 1. The motion vectors of the processed blocks are fed to a motion vector memory 110, to be stored therein. Among them, neighboring vectors which refer to motion vectors of the processed neighboring blocks are selected and coupled to a candidate vector deciding block 120.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 4, when the search block B(i,j) is being processed, at least motion vectors of the blocks B(i-<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
1, j-1) to B(N1, j-1) and B(l,j) to B(i-l,j) should be stored at the motion vector memory 110. (Note that B( i, j-1) to B(N1, j-l) are necessary in determining motion vector of remaining blocks, i.e., B(i+1, j) to B(N1, j) included in a 1th slice; and B(l, j ) to B(i-1, j) are used in determining motion vectors of blocks included in a (j+1)st slice.) Therefore, the motion vector memory 110 should at least have (N1+1) memory spaces each of which can accomodate a motion vector of a processed block.<br>
At the candidate vector deciding block 120, an X-vector and an Y-vector are selected among the neighboring vectors, wherein the X-vector refers to a neighboring vector which is most similar to a horizontal vector and the Y-vector refers to a neighboring vector which is most similar to a vertical vector, the horizontal and the vertical vectors referring to vectors whose y component and x component are 0, respectively.<br>
To do this, a directivity D(V) of a vector V may be defined as the following:<br><br>
wherein Vx and V are X and Y components of V, respectively. A motion vector with a minimum directivity is most similar to the horizontal vector and is selected as the X-vector and a motion vector with a maximum directivity is most similar to the vertical vector and is selected as the Y-vector. In case<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
there exists a motion vector whose x component V is 0, Eq. (1) is not defined. In this case, the motion vector is the vertical vector, and therefore, is determined as the Y-vector.<br>
A set of three candidate vectors, the set including the X-vector and the Y-vector provided from the candidate vector deciding block 120 and a 0 vector are fed to an error detection block 130.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, in case the number of processed neighboring blocks is 1, (for example, a search block B(2,l)) the motion vector of the processed neighboring block (B(l,l)) may be decided as both of the X and the Y vectors.<br>
At the error detection block 130, a distortion between the search block and each of three predicted blocks corresponding to the three candidate vectors inputted thereto is determined, wherein the distortion is a value which represents a difference between two blocks. Of the three candidate vectors, one with a minimum distortion is selected as the candidate motion vector. If the minimum distortion of the candidate motion vector is smaller than the threshold TH, the candidate motion vector is determined as the final motion vector of the search block. Accordingly, a procedure for detecting a motion vector of the search block is completed and the motion vector is provided on L300 through the full search block 200.<br>
If the minimum distortion is not smaller than the threshold TH, the full search trigger signal is applied from<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
the error detection block 130 to the full search block 200, which detects a motion vector of the search block by using the full search block matching method.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, there is shown a more detailed block diagram of the error detection block 130 shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The previous frame is coupled to a frame memory 132 which provides the three predicted blocks which are blocks of the previous frame displaced from the search block by the X-vector, the Y-vector and the 0 vector, respectively, in response to the three candidate vectors provided from the candidate vector deciding block 120. The three predicted blocks are fed to an error calculator 134 which calculates a distortion between the search block and each of the three predicted blocks. At a minimum selection block 136, a candidate vector which corresponds to a minimum distortion is selected as the candidate motion vector. The candidate motion vector and the minimum distortion are fed to a comparator 138.<br>
At the comparator 138, the minimum distortion is compared with the predetermined threshold TH. If the minimum distortion is smaller than TH, the candidate motion vector is provided as the motion vector of the search block; and otherwise, the full search trigger signal is applied to the full search block 200.<br>
As described above, in case moving objects occupy a small portion of the video signal, motion vectors of neighboring blocks are likely to be similar. In addition, if the<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
background is stationary or is moving mainly in a horizontal or a vertical direction, motion vectors are likely to be similar to the 0 vector, the horizontal vector or the vertical vector. Therefore, in this situation, the candidate motion vector is likely to be determined as the motion vector of the search block, to thereby reduce the computational burden entailed in determining the motion vector by using the conventional method.<br>
