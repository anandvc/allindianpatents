				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of an  improved elastomer-double base-composite propellant and method of preparation thereof.<br>
Composite propellants (CP) and composite modified double base propellants are generally used to meet the requirement of superior energy. For such known propellants in the prior art, nitrocellulose, hereinafter to be named as NC is incorporated as binder, more particularly in case of double base propellant, hereinafter to be named as DBP and composite modified double base propellant. herein after to be named as CMDBP. The major drawback of such known propellants in the prior art is that the binder like NC has poor solid loading capability and as well as poor low temperature properties.<br>
To overcome these limitations of known such propellants in the prior art, various types of elastomers are required to be incorporated in DBP and CMDBP formulations to get the resulted elastomer modified composite double base propellant, hereinafter to be named as EMCDBP. The elastomers applied in such cases are generally like polyglycol adipate, polyethylene glycol, polycaprolactone, hydroxy terminated poly butadiene, hereinafter to be named as HTPB etc. of these elastomers, HTPB is generally used as binder to form CP formulations.<br>
This formulation has inherent disadvantage of its own like non-compatibility and immiscibility of HTPB with nitrate ester plasticiser.<br>
This disadvantage has been overcome by incorporating ester or glycol blocks in HTPB chain by block copolymerisation technique wherein HTPB is used for ring opening polymerization to yield a block copolymer.<br>
Such known propellants are not free from disadvantages.<br><br>
Such known EMCDBP using the said block copolymer, comprising HTPB incorporated with ester or glycol block, alone as binder has limited ambient stress capabilities because of the longer cross link length of the block-copolymer in the propellant formulations.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of such known propellant of the prior art is the unsuitability in cartridge loading applications wherein lower elongation and better tensile strength properties are essentially required to provide structural integrity of cured propellant grains. Therefore, there is a great need for perfecting the EMCDBP formulations with improved stress capabilities, homogenitv. selected chain length of elastomer, suitable for cartridge loading capability and structural integrity of the propellant grains.<br>
