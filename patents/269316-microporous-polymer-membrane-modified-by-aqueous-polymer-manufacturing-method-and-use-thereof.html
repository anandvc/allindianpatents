The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
?001?The invention relates to a membrane material modified by aqueous polymer used for energy storage devices such as non-aqueous electrolyte batteries, and a preparation method and use thereof, which belongs to the field of manufacturing energy storage devices such as battery, capacitor and so on. <br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
?002?Microporous polymer membrane is one of the indispensable materials for manufacturing non-aqueous electrolyte energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries, rechargeable lithium metal batteries and supercapacitors. The commercial membrane used by non-aqueous electrolyte energy storage devices is mainly microporous polyolefin membrane, microporous polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and microporous polyolefin/polyvinylidene fluoride composite membrane.<br>
?003?The microporous polyolefin membrane manufactured by mechanical two-way stretch method (dry method) and solvent extraction method (wet method) is mainly polyethylene membrane, polypropylene membrane and polyethylene-polypropylene composite membrane. As polyolefin is a non-polar material, the compatibility of polyolefin with electrolyte solution (polar organic solvent) is poor. It plays only the role of a mechanical isolation between anode and cathode. The membrane has no fixation to electrolyte which makes most of electrolyte solution exist in the battery in a free state. During charge-discharge cycles, redox side-reaction occurs inevitably between the free electrolyte with anode and cathode materials to consume the electrolyte in battery which results in poor liquid. It leads to polarizations increase of battery and it is easy to produce lithium dendrite formed by lithium deposition crystal in charge-discharge cycles and thereby results in membrane piercing phenomenon. Dry area and the lithium dendrite caused by the poor liquid of the batteries is easy to lead the phenomenon of electrostatic breakdown in the batteries and direct short circuit between the anodes and the cathodes, resulting in potential safety hazards, such as combustion and explosion of the lithium-ion batteries. The potential safety hazards of the lithium-ion batteries restrict development space used in high-power and large-capacity electric power sources.<br>
?004?Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and derivatives thereof possess membrane-forming ability only in the presence of plasticizers. The PVDF membrane containing plasticizers has poor process operability because of serious disadvantage of self-adhered property and relatively low mechanical strength. It can not be separately prepared to be microporous polymer membrane.  The preparation method of such microporous polymer membrane basically adopts the following procedure. The PVDF membrane containing plasticizer and battery electrode of anode and cathode are prepared to be dry battery cell by thermal bonding. Then, organic solvent is used to extract the dry battery cell to form PVDF microporous polymer membrane bonded with anode and cathode. To solve the technical difficulties for preparation of PVDF microporous polymer membrane to allow that it can be separately prepared to be membrane like microporous polyolefin membrane and enhance the operability in preparation of battery,  PVDF solution is coated on the microporous polyolefin membrane, and then the solvent extraction method or phase inversion method is used to prepare microporous polyolefin/polyvinylidene fluoride composite membrane.<br>
?005?The main disadvantage of the microporous polyolefin membrane, the microporous polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and the microporous polyolefin/polyvinylidene fluoride composite membrane is their relatively lower heat resistance. Once the internal temperature of the batteries exceeds 150?, though the polyolefin-based materials will melt, micropores will disappear, and thereby block ion conduction, so-called fuse protective effect, as the microporous polymer membrane will shrink greatly while melting and decrease in size, direct short circuit may occur between anodes and cathodes of batteries, and causing safety problems of batteries, such as combustion and explosion.<br>
?006?To overcome heat resistance problem of microporous polyolefin membrane, reduce shrinkage thereof at high temperature and improve safety of batteries, CN101250276 discloses a method for modifying microporous polyolefin membrane. The method is dipping the membrane of a liquid lithium-ion battery into the solution comprising organic solvents (like acetone) and chemical crosslinking agent monomer (difunctional acrylic ester monomer) and polymers with crosslinking function (polyvinylidene fluoride, polytetrafluoroethylene, etc.). Poly-reaction of monomers directly affects performance of the modified membrane in modification and conditions are hard to control. It requires adding 0.0001%-0.1% of a thermal initiator to the battery core, and requires adding a certain amount of the chemical crosslinking monomer between anode and cathode pieces. This makes the manufacturing process of batteries complicated.<br>
?007?In general, a new modified polyolefin membrane are urgently needed at present for reducing shrinkage thereof at high temperature, and a low-cost membrane used for non-aqueous electrolyte energy storage devices by a simple production method.<br>
?008?The inventor of the invention has synthesized a microporous polymer membrane prepared from aqueous polymeric colloid emulsion by a mass of tests, based on which the aqueous polymeric colloid emulsion is coated on non-woven fabric to prepare a membrane CN101226994 with higher heat resistance and mechanical strength. The preparation process is a clean and environment-friendly production technique using water as a solvent. Whether the non-polar microporous polyolefin membrane can be modified by the polar aqueous polymers, the inventor has made bold attempt.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
?009?A first technical problem to be solved by the invention is to provide a microporous polyolefin membrane modified by aqueous polymer with little thermal shrinkage.<br>
?010?The technical proposal of the invention is as follows: It consists of microporous polyolefin membrane and the aqueous polymer coating on its surface. The aqueous polymer coating is obtained by the following steps: Polymer colloidal emulsion is prepared by copolymerizing 100 parts (by weight) of water-soluble polymer, 30-500 parts of hydrophobic monomer, 0-200 parts of hydrophilic monomer and 1-5 parts of initiator. 0-100% inorganic filler, 0-50% of an organic filler and 20-100% plasticizer (on the basis of 100% solid content of the polymer colloidal emulsion) are added to the emulsion to give slurry. The slurry is coated on the surface of the microporous polyolefin membrane and then drying to obtain the modified membrane.<br>
?011?The water-soluble polymer of the invention is polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone or water-soluble copolymer of polyvinyl pyrrolidone. The polymerization degree of the polyvinyl alcohol is 1700-2400, and the hydrolysis degree is 50-99. The polyethylene oxide has a molecular weight in the range between 100,000-2,000,000; the polyvinyl pyrrolidone or water-soluble copolymer of polyvinyl pyrrolidone has a molecular weight in the range between 500-100,000, preferably 10,000-30,000.<br>
?012?The structural formula of the hydrophobic monomer is CH2=CR1R2, wherein:<br>
R1=-H or -CH3;<br>
R2=-C6H5, -OCOCH3, -COOCH3, -COOCH2CH3, -COOCH2CH2CH2CH3, -COOCH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH2CH3 or -CN. The hydrophobic monomer is selected at least one from the above mentioned hydrophobic monomers.<br>

?014?The described microporous polyolefin membrane is microporous polypropylene membrane (PP membrane), microporous polyethylene membrane (PE membrane) or 3-layer composite membrane PP/PE/PP. The porosity of the polyolefin membrane is 20%-90%, preferably 35%-85%.<br>
?015?The second technical problem to be solved by the invention is to provide an environment friendly preparation technique, so can obtain a modified membrane with low cost and excellent performance for non-aqueous electrolyte energy storage devices.<br>
?016?The preparation method of the microporous polyolefin membrane modified by aqueous polymer described above comprises the following steps:<br><br>
?016?(a)	Preparation of polymer colloid emulsion<br>
?016?Adding water-soluble polymer and hydrophilic monomer to water, stirring until the solids completely dissolve. Adding hydrophobic monomer and initiator to the reactor for poly-reaction to obtain the polymeric colloid emulsion.<br>
?017?(b)	Preparation of polymeric colloid slurry<br>
?018?Adding 0-100% of an inorganic filler, 0-50% of an organic filler and 20-100% of a plasticizer to the polymer colloid emulsion (based on 100% solid content thereof), stirring, grinding and filtering to obtain the aqueous polymer slurry. And<br>
?019?(c)	Preparation of the microporous polyolefin membrane modified by aqueous polymer by coating<br>
?020?Coating the aqueous polymer slurry (obtained in step b) on one or two surfaces of the microporous polyolefin membrane, drying to obtain the microporous polyolefin membrane modified by aqueous polymer.<br>
?021?In order to improve surface energy and roughness of the microporous polyolefin membrane so as to bond the microporous polyolefin membrane and the aqueous polymer slurry, the described microporous polyolefin membrane is surface modified by the following methods. <br>
?022?In the invention, the inventor modifies surface of the microporous polyolefin membrane by the following methods: (1) pretreating the microporous polyolefin membrane by at least one of heat treatment (corona), plasma treatment, high-energy irradiation treatment or light treatment; (2) precoating the surface of the microporous polyolefin membrane by at least one of coupling agents or bonders; (3) modifying surface of the microporous membrane by both (1) and (2). The treatment methods change surface characteristic of the microporous membrane only, can keep inherent characteristic of the membrane and do not affect the microporous structure, etc.<br>
?023?The third technical problem to be solved by the invention is to provide the use of the microporous polyolefin membrane modified by aqueous polymer to preparing lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors and battery/supercapacitor energy storage devices.<br>
?024?Advantages of the invention are as follows:<br>
?025?The polyolefin membrane modified by aqueous polymer has thermal shutdown effect (the polyolefin membrane is molten at high temperature, resulting in closing of micropores) and little thermal shrinkage, so can solve the major problem of shrinkage of the polyolefin membrane at high temperature, improve the battery safety. And the rupture temperature of the membrane is increased, so ensures integrity of the membrane at high temperature, thus further improving the battery safety. In addition, due to its high polarity, the coating material can improve liquid absorbency and retention of the membrane, thus better improving charge and discharge performance, rate performance, cycle life and safety performance of the batteries.<br>
?026?In this invention, chemical reaction is absent in preparation of the membrane, thus being easy to control. And, the slurry and the polyolefin membrane have excellent cohesiveness to ensure interfacial bonding stable and uniform. In addition, the slurry and the electrodes have good compatibility so as to ensure battery good performance. Other techniques for preparing the batteries are completely consistent with the existing techniques. Meanwhile, flame retardance of the coating material ensures safety protection of the batteries by the membrane from the following three aspects: 1. the thermal shutdown performance of the membrane; 2. no short circuit (direct contact) between the anode and the cathode due to little shrinkage of the modified membrane in the invention; and 3. avoiding further combustion of the batteries in the event of any safety accident due to self flame retardance of the membrane.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
?027?The polyolefin membrane modified by aqueous polymer of the invention is obtained by the following steps: Polymer colloidal emulsion is prepared by copolymerizing 100 parts (by weight) of water-soluble polymer, 30-500 parts of hydrophobic monomer, 0-200 parts of hydrophilic monomer and 1-5 parts of initiator. 0-100% inorganic filler and 20-100% plasticizer (on the basis of 100% solid content of the polymer colloidal emulsion) are added to the emulsion to give slurry. The slurry is coated on the surface of the microporous polyolefin membrane and then drying to obtain the modified membrane.<br>
?028?The described microporous polyolefin membrane is microporous polypropylene membrane (PP membrane), microporous polyethylene membrane (PE membrane) or 3-layers composite membrane PP/PE/PP. The porosity of the polyolefin membrane is 20%-90%, preferably 35%-85%.<br>
?029?As polyolefin materials are non-polar high polymers and free from polar groups, surface energy thereof is relatively low. Because the polyolefin materials are chemically inert and functionalized properties such as wettability, bondability, dyeability and biocompatibility are relatively poor, resulting in poor compatibility of membrane materials with a majority of polymers and lower bonding strength with polymeric colloid in practical application. Therefore, for smooth implementation of the invention, the polyolefin membrane needs surface modification to introduce polar groups or coating precoating layers on surfaces of the microporous polyolefin membrane so as to improve surface energy of the membrane material  and improve roughness of membrane surfaces, increase surface bondability and eliminate weak boundary layers of the surfaces, thus achieving bonding of the membrane with the aqueous polymer slurry. <br>
?030?At present, surface modification methods of the polyolefin membrane mainly include chemical modification, physical modification, blending modification, surfactant method, plasma treatment, photografting modification, high-energy radiation grafting modification, etc. Chemical oxidation, physical sandblasting, polishing, etc. having disadvantages of difficult thickness control, complex post-treatment techniques of the membrane material, etc., thus scale production is difficult. However, the modified membrane has poor uniformity due to difficult control of grafting reaction when graft modifying polymer monomers on the polyolefin membrane by present technologies, such as plasma, lighting and high-energy radiation.And the grafting reaction occurs in micropores of the membrane resulting in the reduction of pore volume and porosity, and the change of pore shape and tortuosity after grafting. This affects properties of the membrane and further affects battery performance. <br>
?031?In the invention, the inventor pretreats the microporous polyolefin membrane by the following methods: (1) heat treatment (corona), plasma treatment and high-energy irradiation treatment or light treatment; (2) precoating surface of the microporous polyolefin membrane by at least one of coupling agents or bonders; (3) modifying surface of the microporous membrane by combination of the two methods. The treatment methods change surface characteristic of the microporous membrane only, can keep inherent characteristic of the membrane and do not affect the microporous structure, etc.<br>
?032?Preferably, the microporous membrane is pretreated by at least one of heat treatment (corona), plasma treatment, lighting, high-energy radiation and the like, and then coated by at least one of coupling agent or bonder such as acrylonitrile modified EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer) and functionalized silanes (vinylsilane, octylsilane, aminosilane, epoxy silane, 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, isocyanate silane, etc.).<br>
?033?The water-soluble polymer of the invention is polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone or water-soluble copolymer of polyvinyl pyrrolidone; the polymerization degree of the polyvinyl alcohol is 1700-2400, and the hydrolysis degree is 50-99. The polyethylene oxide has a molecular weight in the range between 100,000-2,000,000; the polyvinyl pyrrolidone or water-soluble copolymer of polyvinyl pyrrolidone has a molecular weight in the range between 500-100,000, preferably 10,000-30,000.<br>
?034?The structural formula of the hydrophobic monomer is CH2=CR1R2, wherein:<br>
R1=-H or -CH3;<br>
R2=-C6H5, -OCOCH3, -COOCH3, -COOCH2CH3, -COOCH2CH2CH2CH3, -COOCH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH2CH3 or -CN. The hydrophobic monomer is selected at least one from the above-mentioned hydrophobic monomers;<br>
?035?The structural formula of the hydrophilic monomer is CHR3=CR4R5, wherein:<br>
R3=-H, -CH3 or -COOLi;<br>
R4=-H, -CH3 or -COOLi;<br>
R5=-COOLi, -CH2COOLi, -COO(CH2)6SO3Li, -CONH2, -CONHCH3,  , -CONHCH2CH3, -CON(CH3)2 or -CON(CH2CH3)2. The hydrophilic monomer is selected at least one from the above-mentioned hydrophilic monomers.<br>
?036?The preparation method of the microporous polyolefin membrane modified by aqueous polymer of the invention is environment-friendly with low production cost and excellent performance of the modified microporous polyolefin membrane. The preparation method comprises the following steps:<br>
?037?(a) Preparation of polymeric colloid emulsion<br>
Adding water-soluble polymer and hydrophilic monomer and the auxiliaries to water, stirring and heating until the solids completely dissolve. Keeping reactor temperature at the required reaction temperature of 30-90?, adding the hydrophobic monomer to the reactor (once, batches or dropwise), and adding an initiator to initiate 4-35h polymerization reaction to obtain the polymeric colloid emulsion, wherein the initiator can also be added dropwise or batches during reaction.<br>
?038?The initiator is ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide or azobisisobutylamidine or a redox initiation system composed of the above-mentioned initiator with Na2SO3 and FeSO4.<br>
?039?Not less than 3 parts by weight of auxiliary also can be added as an emulsifier to stabilize the colloid emulsion to some degree. The auxiliary can be selected from dodecyl sulfonate, dodecyl benzene sulfonate and vinyl sulfonate.<br>
?040? (b)	  Preparation of polymeric colloid slurry<br>
?041?Adding 0-100% of an inorganic filler, 0-50% of an organic filler and 20-100% of plasticizer to the polymeric colloid emulsion (based on 100% solid content thereof), stirring and dispersing uniformly, and grinding for 2-10h, preferably 3-5h, And then, filtering the slurry by a sieve with less than 200 meshes to remove materials of larger particles which are not ground. <br>
?042?The plasticizer is at least one of propylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, diethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, trimethyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl lactate, methyl lactate, ethyl butyrate, diethyl carbonate, tributyl propionate, amylmethylacetate, isopropyl acetate, diisobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, dipropyl ketone, ethyl butyl ketone or methylamylketone. <br>
?043?To improve heat resistance, porosity and membrane rigidity of the microporous polymers membrane, an inorganic filler can be added to the aqueous polymeric colloid emulsion. Usually, the inorganic filler is micropowder with larger specific surface area and stronger surface adsorption capacity that will benefit adsorption of electrolyte and dissociation of electrolyte salt, thus improving ionic conductivity of the membrane. The inorganic filler is fume colloidal silica, alumina, titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, magnesia, calcium carbonate or fiber glass.<br>
?044?To improve dispersibility of the inorganic filler in the polymeric colloid emulsion, a silane coupling agent can be added. The coupling agent can be selected from 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 2-aminoethyl-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, <br>
3-glycidyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilicane or<br>
vinyltri(2-methoxyethoxy)silane. The addition amount of the silane coupling agent is 0.5-5.0% of the inorganic filler by weight.<br>
?045?To enhance the safety of the modified microporous polyolefin membrane, a micron- sized organic filler also can be added to modify the membrane because organic filler is good for blocking the ionic conduction of the membrane. So, once working temperature of the batteries is out of control, within 100-130?, the modified microporous polyolefin membrane is to prevent ionic from continuous flow to ensure the safety of batteries. The micron-sized organic filler can be selected at least one from ultrafine polyethylene wax, oxide wax powder and ultrafine polyethylene wax powder. Amount of the organic filler added is 5.0-20% based on 100% solid content of the polymeric colloid emulsion.<br>
?046?(c)	Surface modification of the polyolefin membrane<br>
?047?As polyolefin materials are non-polar high polymers, such microporous membrane has lower surface energy, poor compatibility with a majority of polymers and lower bonding strength with polymeric colloid.To overcome the disadvantage and improve surface energy of the microporous membrane, the polyolefin membrane is surface modified by the following methods:<br>
?048?1) treating the microporous polyolefin membrane by at least one of heat treatment, plasma treatment, high-energy irradiation treatment or light treatment; <br>
?047?2)coating surface of the microporous polyolefin membrane by at least one of EVA modified by acrylonitrile or functionalized silanes (vinylsilane, octylsilane, aminosilane, epoxy silane, 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, isocyanate silane, etc.); or<br>
?047?3) pretreating the microporous polyolefin membrane by at least one of heat treatment, plasma treatment, high-energy irradiation treatment or light treatment, and then coating surface of the microporous polyolefin membrane by at least one of the EVA modified by acrylonitrile or the functionalized silanes.<br>
?048?(d)	Preparation of the microporous polyolefin membrane modified by aqueous polymer by coating<br>
?049?Coating the aqueous polymer slurry (obtained in step b) on one or two surfaces of the microporous polyolefin membrane which is surface modified in step c. The coating thickness (wet) is 2-600µm, preferably 5-400µm.<br>
?049?The coating ways comprise printing, micro-intaglio printing, dip coating, reverse roller coating, direct roller coating, roller scrape coating, comma knife coating, precision direct micro-roller coating, precision reverse micro-roller coating, slide coating, extrusion coating, slot coating, curtain coating, etc. <br>
?050?The microporous membrane is coated once by any one of the methods, combination of a plurality of methods above, or by one-machine multi-point coating method, for example, coating 1-drying 1; coating 2-drying 2, etc., that is, one support is continuously coated with different materials, or different positions of one support are coated. So it can be coated continuously by a plurality of methods by one coater.<br>
?051?(e)	Drying<br>
?052?The wet membrane coated in step d is dried by heated air, hot air, infrared radiation and heating methods of other technologies. Drying temperature is 30-160?, preferably 40-100?. The final membrane is obtained with thickness of 10-100µm, preferably 12-50µm.<br>
?053?The microporous polyolefin membrane modified by aqueous polymer above-mentioned can be used for preparing lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors and battery/supercapacitor energy storage devices.<br>
?054?The invention will be further described in conjunction with the following preferred examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>

?056?a	Preparation of polymeric colloid emulsion<br>
?057?Lipophilic monomers styrene (St)/butyl acrylate (BA)/acrylonitrile (AN) were added to aqueous periston solution for ternary copolymerization in aqueous phase. The copolymer composition was PVP:St:BA:AN=10:2:4:2 (by weight; the same below) and the copolymer content is 15%.<br>
?058?The polymer emulsion was prepared through following steps: 1000g distilled water was added to a four-mouth reaction vessel with condensate water. Then 100g periston was added to the reaction vessel, and the reaction vessel was heated to 90? under stirring. When the material was transparent, 20g styrene (St) monomer and 2g ammonium persulfate initiator were added. After reacting for 20h, the mixture changed into white emulsion. Then, 40g butyl acrylate (BA) was added. After reacting for 2h, 20g acrylonitrile monomer and 1.5g initiator were added to the reaction vessel. The polymeric colloid emulsion was obtained after 12h polymerization.<br>
?059?b	Preparation of polymeric colloid slurry<br>
?060?19g zirconium dioxide filler, 5g polyethylene wax powder and 160g benzyl alcohol plasticizer were added to the polymeric colloid emulsion obtained above. After 6h high-speed stirring and 5h ball milling, the polymeric colloid slurry was obtained. Viscosity of the slurry was determined at ambient temperature of 20.6? and RH=64%: Tslurry=35? and viscosity=2500mpa•s.<br>
?061?c	Surface modification of the polyolefin membrane<br>
?062?The surface modification of polyolefin is mainly to improve wettability and bondibility of the polyolefin with the aqueous polymer slurry. A simple method easy for scale production is combination of pretreatment and precoating method. That is, the microporous membrane is pretreated by such treatment methods as corona, plasma, lighting and high-energy radiation, and then coated by coupling agent or bonders, So a coating is introduced between the microporous membrane and the aqueous slurry which has excellent bonding strength with the microporous polyolefin membrane and the aqueous polymer slurry. ?063?In the example, the microporous polypropylene (PP) membrane with thickness of 16µm and basic weight of 10.8g/m2 was corona treated (corona power of 400w) at speed of 20m/min. Then, 20 parts of the EVA rubber modified by acrylonitrile (solid content was 20%) and 200 parts of ethyl acetate were prepared into the slurry with solid content of 1.8%. The slurry was coated on the pretreated polypropylene microporous membrane by printing. The coating thickness (one side on the pretreated membrane) was controlled to be less than 2µm based on gravure rollers, speed, rubber roller pressure and the like parameters.<br>
?064?d	Preparation of the microporous polyolefin membrane modified by aqueous polymer by coating<br>
?065?The prepared aqueous slurry was coated on the precoated microporous PP membrane by continuous roller coating process (belt speed is 5m/min). In the roller coating process, slurry thickness was controlled by a scraper. Coating was performed and the coating layer can be controlled by contacting the belts with the feeding rollers running in the opposite direction. Subsequently, coated wet membrane was sent to an oven with circulating hot air for drying to obtain a modified polypropylene membrane with thickness of 25µm.<br>
?066?Air permeability of the membrane prepared above approximated 40 (sec/in2•100ml•1.22kPa), which referred to time for passing 100ml air per square inch at pressure of 1.22kPa (the same for the examples below). Shrinkability and air permeability of the membrane at different temperatures were listed in Table 1 and Table 2.<br>

?068?Table 1 refers to shrinkability data of the modified polypropylene membrane in example 1 at different temperatures. Compared with the polypropylene (PP) membrane, the modified polypropylene membrane keeps better shape at 160?. The temperature resistance is very beneficial to battery safety. In addition, the shrinkability of the membrane in the example of the invention was tested in free state, the shrinkability in the batteries will be smaller, which is consistent with the thermal box test of batteries hereinafter.<br><br>

?077?Table 4 refers to air permeability data of the modified polyethylene membrane in example 2 at different temperatures. As shown in Table 4, when temperature rose to 130?, air increasingly permeating the membrane quickly increased, that is, the air permeability obviously reduced. The main reason was that melting point of the membrane materials was achieved when temperature rose to 130?, resulting in melting; and micropores were blocked due to tension and porosity suddenly reduced and even disappeared, thus air permeability quickly reduced. Such performance is very beneficial to battery safety, the membrane is blocked in case of abnormal circumstances of the batteries when temperature rises to above 130?, thus blocking further reaction and avoiding explosion and combustion of the batteries.<br>
