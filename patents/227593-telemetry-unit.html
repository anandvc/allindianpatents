				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a telemetry unit for a tyre monitoring<br>
apparatus.<br>
It is known to provide a tyre monitoring apparatus for measuring the<br>
pressure within vehicle tyres.<br>
The tyre monitoring apparatus may also measure other parameters within<br>
a tyre environment, such as the local temperature of a tyre. The measured<br>
data is transmitted, for example via a radio wave link, to the cabin of the<br>
vehicle where it is electronically processed before being displayed to the<br>
vehicle driver. This enables the recipient of the transmitted data to<br>
monitor changes in the condition of the tyre, for example to reduce<br>
damage to the tyre (s) of a vehicle, or to predict tyre failure. This is of<br>
particular advantage at high vehicle speeds, when the environment within<br>
a tyre is at its most hostile and the likelihood of damage to a tyre and,<br>
indeed, injury to the occupants of the vehicle, is at its greatest.<br>
The majority of existing tyre monitoring apparatus use a battery as the<br>
power source, which is located on or within a wheel or tyre. Such<br>
arrangements have several undesirable limitations, for example limited<br>
battery life and size or weight which can be accommodated within a tyre.<br>
This can have a further undesirable knock on effect, in that if there is a<br>
limited power source available, for example as a result of weight<br>
implications, the number and frequency of data transmissions that can be<br>
relayed for processing is compromised.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to reduce or substantially obviate the<br>
disadvantages referred to above.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a telemetry unit for<br>
a tyre monitoring apparatus, the telemetry unit including a housing<br>
having sensor means for measuring data relevant to the local environment<br>
of the telemetry unit, transmission means for transmitting measured data<br>
to a remote location, a piezoelectric power generator adapted to generate<br>
and store an electrical charge in response to rotation of the tyre for<br>
powering the unit, and control means for controlling the sensor means<br>
and transmission means, in which the control means is arranged vary the<br>
rate of transmission of data from the telemetry unit in dependance on the<br>
rotary speed of the tyre.<br>
Preferably, the piezoelectric power generator is arranged to produce at<br>
least one pulse of electric charge for each rotation of the tyre, and the<br>
control means is adapted to monitor the number and/or frequency of the<br>
pulses generated in order to determine the appropriate rate of<br>
transmission of data.<br>
The control means is adapted to initiate monitoring of the local<br>
environment and transmission of measured data after a predetermined<br>
number of pulses has been detected.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the housing is adapted to be mounted to an<br>
inner wall of a tyre.<br>
An exterior surface of the housing may have a substantially arcuate<br>
profile adapted for bonding to an arcuate interior surface of a vehicle tyre.<br><br><br>
An exterior surface of the housing may include an external profile for<br>
complimentary engagement with the internal pattern of a vehicle tyre.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the housing is releasably mounted on a<br>
footing adapted to be bonded to the internal wall of a tyre, for example by<br>
means of clips. The footing may include air channels for allowing<br>
movement of air about the housing, in use.<br>
Preferably, the sensor means includes at least one of a pressure sensor<br>
and/or a temperature sensor.<br>
Conveniently, an actuator is movably mounted in the housing and<br>
adapted for contact with the piezoelectric element under centrifugal<br>
forces.<br>
The invention is advantageous in that it provides a telemetry unit, which<br>
is suitable for measuring and transmitting data from inside the harsh<br>
environment of a rotating pneumatic tyre. Measurement and transmission<br>
of data from within the tyre is possible for normal operating conditions<br>
within a tyre, for detecting potential failure or blow out of a tyre, for<br>
example.<br>

Figure 10 shows an end view of the unit of Figures 6 to 9 in use in a<br>
pneumatic tyre; and<br>
Figure 11 is a side view of the unit as shown in Figure 10.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 4, a power generator/sensor unit is indicated<br>
generally at 10, for use in a tyre monitoring apparatus. The unit 10<br><br><br>
includes a housing 12 made as a reinforced injection moulding composite<br>
for moulding in and adapted to withstand the harsh environment of<br>
pneumatic vehicle tyre. Although the housing 102 is described as being<br>
made as a composite moulding, any suitable material can be used.<br>
The housing 12 has a base or footing 16 having a shallow convex outer<br>
profile, indicated at C in Figure 2, for bonding to a correspondingly<br>
arcuate interior surface of a vehicle tyre. The base 16 defines a chamber,<br>
indicated at 18 in Figure 1, having an internal base wall 20.<br>
The unit 10 includes a piezoelectric element 11 in the form of a<br>
piezoceramic disc 14 having a radius R, which is mounted centrally on a<br>
brass supporting disc 15 having a radius greater than r.<br>
The element 11 is mounted in the housing 12 for generating electrical<br>
power to operate circuitry within the unit 10.<br>
The base 16 of the housing 12 includes two opposed recesses 22, one of<br>
which can be seen clearly in figure 1, for supporting part of the periphery<br>
of the brass disc 15, when supported on the base 16, the central portion of<br>
the brass disc 15 is spaced apart from the base wall 20 by a small<br>
distance. A cover 26 is received on the base 16, which overlays the part<br>
of the periphery of the brass disc 15 supported on the recesses 22, such<br>
that the disc is clamped between the cover 26 and the recesses 22 along<br>
two edge portions 47.<br>
A cap 28 is provided over the cover 26, the cap including a central<br>
formation 30 which extends through a central aperture 27 in the cover 26.<br>
A printed circuit board (PCB) 32 is mounted in the housing 12 on the cap<br>
28, as shown in figure 5a, the PCB 32 includes a micro processor, a radio<br><br><br>
frequency (RF) transmitter, pressure and temperature sensor circuitry,<br>
including pressure and temperature sensors, and supervision and control<br>
circuitry, which form part of a tyre monitoring apparatus. The PCB 32<br>
also includes a rectifier for converting an alternating current output from<br>
the piezoceramic disc 14 into a direct current output ; an energy storage<br>
element in the form of a series of a capacitors, which store the direct<br>
current output from the rectifier until required, and ADC-DC controller<br>
which is provided for regulating voltage output from the capacitors. The<br>
unit 10 uses ultra low leakage type capacitors, to ensure that as high a<br>
percentage of the generated charge is retained as possible and that<br>
internal leakage is kept to a minimum.<br>
The PCB 32 is in electrical communication with the piezoceramic disc 14<br>
via two wires, not shown, and is securably located on the cap 28 by a<br>
potting compound 34, to protect the PCB 32 during installation or transit,<br>
and from the harsh environment within a rotating pneumatic tyre. The<br>
potting compound 34 can be any suitable type but in this embodiment is a<br>
two-part epoxy adhesive.<br>
An actuator 36 is disposed between the piezoceramic disc 14, the cover<br>
26 and the cap 28, the actuator consisting of an integrally formed foot 38<br>
and a stem 40. The stem 40 extends into the central formation of the cap<br>
28 and includes a central bore 42. As can be seen clearly in Figure 2, the<br>
foot 38 includes an integrally formed elongate projection or nose 44,<br>
which is in contact with the piezoceramic element. The nose 44 extends<br>
diametrically across the piezoelectric element 11, as indicated in Figure 4,<br>
which shows the contact area 45 of the nose 44 on the piezoelectric<br>
element 11 and the areas of support 47 for the disc 15 on the base 16. It<br>
will be appreciated that the piezoelectric element 11 is configured<br>
substantially as a simply supported beam, supported on one side by the<br><br><br>
recesses 22 in the base 16 and contactable on its opposite side by the nose<br>
44 of the actuator 36.<br>
The actuator 36 is connected to the cap 28 by a screw 46, which passes<br>
through the cap 28 and is securably received in the bore 42 of the stem<br>
40. The base 16 is connected to the cover 26 by four screws 48, which<br>
pass through the comers of the base 16 and which are securably received<br>
in the cover 26.<br>
The arrangement is such that the piezoelectric element 11 can be<br>
deflected downwardly (as viewed in Figure 2) under the influence of the<br>
actuator 36, as will be described in more detail below.<br>
However, the maximum deflection of the piezoelectric element 11 is<br>
limited by the distance between the underside of the brass disc 15 and the<br>
internal base wall 20, set at 0.4 mm in the embodiment of Figures 1 to 4.<br>
Thus, the element 11 is protected against excess deflection which might<br>
otherwise damage the structure and generating capacity of the element<br>
11, the movement of the actuator 36 within the housing 12 in the opposite<br>
direction, i..e. perpendicularly away from the piezoceramic disc 14,<br>
upwards as viewed in Figure 2, is restricted by walls 27 of the cover 26.<br>
The embodiment of figures 1 to 4, the maximum distance between the<br>
upper side of the foot 38 of the actuator 36 and the walls 27 of the cover<br>
26 is 0.6 mm when the power generator 10 is in the rest position shown in<br>
Figure 2. Hence, the maximum travel of the actuator 36 within the<br>
housing 12 is 1 mm in the embodiment of figures 1 to 4. This maximum<br>
distance of travel of the actuator 36 within the housing 12 is set at a<br>
predetermined low value to protect the piezoceramic disc 14 from<br>
damage due to deflection and/or impact of the actuator 36 on the upper<br>
surface of the piezoceramic disc 14 in use. It will be understood that the<br><br><br>
maximum travel of the actuator and deflection of the piezoelectric<br>
element can be limited to any distance suitable for protecting the integrity<br>
of the structure and charge generating capacity of the piezoelectric<br>
element.<br>
The arrangement of the piezoceramic disc 14, in combination with the<br>
components of the PCB 32, which are associated with the piezoceramic<br>
disc 14, as described above, form part of a power generator, for supplying<br>
power for the circuitry of the unit 10.<br>
Operation of the power generator will now be described, by way of<br>
example, in which the unit 10 is mounted in a pneumatic tyre on the<br>
wheel of a vehicle, with the outer surface of the base 16 of the housing 12<br>
bonded to a correspondingly arcuate profile of an interior surface of the<br>
tyre, and in which the unit 10 includes a piezoceramic disc 14 of any<br>
suitable known construction.<br>
It will be appreciated that mechanical excitation of the disc 14 generates a<br>
voltage. The effect is substantially linear, i. e. the electric field generated<br>
varies directly with the applied mechanical stress, and is direction<br>
dependent, so that compressive and tensile stresses generate voltages of<br>
opposite polarity.<br>
The cap 28, PCB 32, potting compound 34 and the actuator 36 act on the<br>
disc 14 as a single unit mass, in use, i. e. with the cap, actuator, circuitry<br>
and potting compound acting as a composite actuating mass. When the<br>
wheel is in rotation, centrifugal forces act on the cap 28, PCB 32 and the<br>
potting compound 34, which urge the actuator 36 radially outwards in the<br>
direction of the piezoelectric element 11. This centrifugal action on the<br>
actuator 36 causes the piezoelectric element 11 to deflect, typically<br><br><br>
between 0. 2 to 0. 4 mm at its central region 45 from arrest position when<br>
the wheel is not in rotation. Since the piezoelectric element 11 acts as a<br>
simply supported beam and the nose 44 of the actuator 36 is in contact<br>
with the disc 14 at the central position 45 between the area of support for<br>
the brass disc 15, the deflection is in the form of a uniform bending of the<br>
discs 14 and 15 between the two areas of support 47 of the brass disc 15.<br>
It will be understood that, as the vehicle is in motion, the external area of<br>
the tyre adjacent the unit 10 comes in to contact with the surface along<br>
which the vehicle is travelling, once with every revolution of the wheel.<br>
This contact deforms the area of the tyre adjacent the unit, which<br>
deformation is transmitted to the power generator, ultimately in the form<br>
of a deformation of the piezoelectric element 11 by the actuator 36.<br>
Hence, the piezoceramic disc 14 is subjected to variations in mechanical<br>
excitation during rotation of the wheel on the road surface, whereby each<br>
excitation results in a potential difference being generated by the<br>
piezoceramic disc 14. This process is set out below, with reference to a<br>
rotating wheel, starting from a position where the area of the tyre adjacent<br>
the unit 10 is moving towards contact with a road surface.<br>
With the wheel in rotation, the actuator 36 is in contact with the<br>
piezoceramic disc 14, under centrifugal action from the cap 28, PCB 32<br>
and potting compound 34, as described above. The piezoceramic disc 14<br>
therefore experiences a substantially constant deflection under the<br>
centrifugal forces which are transmitted through the actuator 3 6. As the<br>
wheel rotates further, the area of the tyre adjacent the unit 10 comes into<br>
contact with the road surface and deforms. The deformation results in a<br>
deacceleration of the tyre in the region of the point of contact with the<br>
road surface, causing a sudden reduction in the centrifugal forces<br>
experienced by the actuator 36, almost instantaneously, substantially to<br><br><br>
zero. This change in centrifugal acceleration causes a reduction in the<br>
deflection experienced by the piezoceramic disc 14 under action of the<br>
actuator 36 and generates a first pulse of electrical charge, which is<br>
communicated to the PCB 32.<br>
As the wheel rotates further, at the instant where the area of the tyre<br>
adjacent the unit 10 moves away from contact with the road surface, the<br>
acceleration of the tyre adjacent the unit 10 increases suddenly, which<br>
results in an instantaneous increase in the centrifugal forces experienced<br>
by the actuator 36. Hence, piezoceramic disc 14 is again caused to deflect<br>
under centrifugal action of the actuator 36, cap 28, PCB 32 and potting<br>
compound 34, as described above, which generates a second pulse of<br>
electrical charge of opposite polarity to the first pulse described above,<br>
which is communicated to the PCB 32.<br>
Hence, during a single revolution of the wheel two pulses of electrical<br>
charge, of opposite polarity, are generated in quick succession,<br>
constituting a single alternating current output. The rectifier rectifies the<br>
alternating current output into a direct current output, which is stored in<br>
the capacitors for use to power the tyre monitoring apparatus. For each<br>
revolution of the wheel, a small storable electrical charge is generated,<br>
typically of 5-10 nanocoulombs.<br>
In addition to the storable charge generated with each revolution of the<br>
wheel due to contact with the road surface, the unit 10 may also transmit<br>
other excitation forces to the piezoelectric element 14, for example<br>
accelerations/deflections which are caused by vibrations due to<br>
imperfections in the road surface, or out of balance forces on the wheel<br>
itself. If the excitation is sufficient to cause deflection of the piezoelectric<br><br><br>
disc 14, an additional storable charge will be generated and stored in the<br>
capacitors, as described above.<br>
In some circumstances, the forces acting on the unit 10 inside a vehicle<br>
tyre will not be sufficient to cause uniform bending of the piezoceramic<br>
disc 14, as described above. Instead, the deformation will be in the form<br>
of a localized squashing of the structure of the disc 14 at the point of<br>
contact with, and in the region immediately adjacent to, the actuator. In<br>
operation, the localised &amp; # x0; squashing of the disc structure also<br>
generates potential difference across the element 11, for generating<br>
charge substantially as described above.<br>
The unit 10 is particularly advantageous in that the control circuitry is<br>
used as an actuating mass for the piezoelectric element 11. In the<br>
described embodiment, the weight of the cap 28, the PCB 32 and the<br>
potting compound 34 operate as a single unit to act as an actuating<br>
mass/exciter for the piezoceramic disc 14, without the need for any<br>
additional mass. Since there is an overall saving in weight in the power<br>
generator, to minimise localised wear caused by the unit 10 adjacent the<br>
area of mounting in the vehicle tyre, and thus reduce the likelihood of a<br>
localised bald spot occurring in the tread of the tyre.<br>
The outer surface C of the base 16 may include an external profile for<br>
complimentary engagement with the internal pattern of a vehicle tyre, to<br>
limit further the effects of localised wear on the tyre, in use.<br>
In order to utilise the small amounts of power generated by the power<br>
generator and to remove the need for a battery backup to power the tyre<br>
monitoring apparatus, an ultra low power consumption protocol is used to<br>
control the consumption of power stored by the capacitors.<br><br><br>
Operation a tyre monitoring apparatus will now be described by way of<br>
example, illustrating the stages which are implemented to ensure that the<br>
optimum low power protocol is realised, starting with the monitoring<br>
apparatus in a sleep mode, with reference to Figure 5. As referred to<br>
above, the tyre monitoring apparatus includes a unit 10 having a<br>
piezoelectric power generator, a microprocessor, a radio frequency (RF)<br>
transmitter, pressure and temperature sensor circuitry and supervision and<br>
control circuitry.<br>
Example 1<br>
Stage 1 The microprocessor is in sleep mode, in which all internal<br>
processing is suspended, apart from a monitor circuit, for monitoring the<br>
wake up requirements of the microprocessor. In this embodiment, the<br>
monitor circuit monitors an externally referenced clock in the form of a<br>
crystal oscillator, located outside the microprocessor in the power/sensor<br>
unit. Hence, in sleep mode, the majority of the microprocessor circuitry is<br>
disabled and the power consumption of the tyre monitoring apparatus is<br>
at minimum level, for example approximately 24 micro ampere of supply<br>
current.<br>
Stage 2 after a predetermined time, in this embodiment 60 seconds, the<br>
monitor circuit wakes up the microprocessor. Upon wake up, the micro<br>
processor switches from the external clock to an internal clock, in the<br>
form of an internal resistor capacitor oscillator. This switch is<br>
implemented to facilitate a higher speed operation of the analogue to<br>
digital conversions and subsequent calculations which are utilised by the<br>
tyre monitoring apparatus. The switch also initiates power to the internal<br>
circuitry of the microprocessor, which allows the main program of the<br><br><br>
microprocessor to be used and to enable the microprocessor to enter a<br>
measure and control phase.<br>
Stage 3 Once the micro processor has 'woken up', power is provided to<br>
the temperature and pressure sensor circuitry. A prescribed time is then<br>
allowed to elapse, in this embodiment 0.5 milli seconds, to facilitate<br>
settling of the sensor circuitry, after which time the micro processor<br>
measures the local pressure and temperature within the tyre. The values<br>
are then stored within the micro processor and the power to the sensor<br>
circuitry is removed instantaneously.<br>
Stage 4 The stored pressure and temperature values are concatenated<br>
with a sensor identification and cyclic redundancy check to form a data<br>
packet for transmitting to a receiver unit/display unit in the vehicle.<br>
Stage 5 The microprocessor then switches from the internal clock back to<br>
the external clock. This change is employed to ensure accurate time<br>
signals for the transmission of the data via the radio frequency (RF) link,<br>
since the external clock is a quartz crystal time reference unit, which<br>
ensures that a higher absolute frequency accuracy is attainable than with<br>
the internal clock.<br>
Stage 6 The microprocessor sets a control line to a logic high OF 3 V,<br>
which enables the RF transmitter, thus causing it to emit a radio<br>
frequency carrier. A settling time of approximately 1 millisecond then<br>
elapses to facilitate settling of the RF transmitter components prior to the<br>
transmission of data from the PCB 32, a pseudo bit pattern, used to bias a<br>
radio frequency data sheer, is then concatenated with the sensor<br>
identification and cyclic redundancy check for transmitting. The data to<br><br><br>
be transmitted is then frequency modulated onto A4 33 MHz radio wave<br>
for propagation to the receiver unit.<br>
Stage 7 The data is transmitted and power to the RF transmitter is then<br>
inhibited instantaneously, at which point the microprocessor then RE-<br>
ENTERS  'SLEEP' mode.<br>
Hence, by utilising the low power protocol described in stages 1-7 of the<br>
above example, the tyre monitoring apparatus utilises only a minimum<br>
amount of power from the power generator, to transmit a reading of the<br>
local pressure and temperature within the tyre. After use, the micro<br>
processor remains in sleep mode for a predetermined period, as referred<br>
to in Stage 2 above, while the energy stored in the capacitors is recharged<br>
by excitation of the piezoceramic disc 14, as described with reference to<br>
Figures 1 to 4. Hence, using a continuous cycle of stages 1-7, the tyre<br>
monitoring apparatus is able to monitor the local condition of the tyre,<br>
utilising the small electrical charges generated by the piezoceramic disc<br>
14, without the need for a back-up battery supply. The continuous cycles<br>
are of advantage during normal operating conditions of the tyre, whereby<br>
any changes in tyre pressure or temperature, which might indicate a<br>
potential problem or failure of the tyre can be monitored, to avoid a<br>
blowout, for example. This has particular advantage at high vehicle<br>
speeds.<br>
Principally, there is a tri-way interdependency of critical factors in the<br>
protocol for the telemetry unit, between the charge generation capability<br>
of the piezoelectric element, the charge storage size and efficiency, and<br>
the RF transmitter reliability governed by the transmitter on time. For a<br>
given type of piezoelectric element, there is an optimum charge<br>
capacitance for the power generator and optimum transmission time for<br><br><br>
the RF transmitter. The piezoelectric element must have sufficient charge<br>
generation overcome the impedance of the storage capacitors, and the<br>
capacitors must have sufficient capacitance to hold the charge required to<br>
perform the measurement/transmission cycle. The RF transmitter on time,<br>
i. e. when the transmitter is active and transmitting, must be optimised<br>
between a maximum period in which there is sufficient charge to transmit<br>
the data prior to the energy storage being exhausted, and a minimum<br>
period below which the reliability of the RF link is adversely effected. If<br>
transmission time is extended beyond the optimum period, the effective<br>
frequency of data transmissions is reduced for a given capacitance.<br>
The data transmitted to the in-car receiver unit is shown to the driver of<br>
the vehicle on the display unit for each of the sensor circuits in the tyre<br>
monitoring apparatus, with respect to each tyre of the vehicle. The<br>
display unit informs the driver of the data visually and/or by audible<br>
means, for example a link to the audio system in the vehicle.<br>
Each tyre/wheel of the vehicle is marked by an individual identifying<br>
feature that relates to a specific sensor located within that tyre. This<br>
identifying feature is also represented on the display unit, in combination<br>
with the data from the sensor within the tyre. In the event that the wheel<br>
is moved to another position on the vehicle it can always be related to the<br>
relevant information on the display unit. Suitable identifying features<br>
include colour-coded symbols and alpha numeric symbols.<br>
Each sensor has a unique electronic serial number, which can be used to<br>
aid the security of the radio transmission data. The unique electronic<br>
serial number can also act as an electronic tagging feature for security and<br>
anti counterfeiting purposes.<br><br><br>
With reference to the preferred embodiment of the power generator, it has<br>
been described that a storable electrical charge is generated, by the<br>
piezoelectric element with each revolution of the vehicle wheel.<br>
Therefore, it will be appreciated that the generation of charge is<br>
proportional to the speed at which the vehicle is travelling. In the above<br>
example of the power consumption protocol, the time delay between<br>
transmission of data from the tyre monitoring apparatus and the "wake<br>
up" of the micro processor for measuring and transmitting a further<br>
reading is set to a predetermined value. In a slow moving vehicle, the<br>
electrical charge which is generated and stored within a predetermined<br>
time period is less than would be generated and stored in a vehicle<br>
travelling at a faster speed in the same time period. Therefore, the time<br>
interval between "wake up" of the microprocessor is set at a<br>
predetermined value, selected to allow a sufficient electrical charge to be<br>
generated and stored for measurement and transmission of the parameters<br>
of a tyre on a slow moving vehicle, for example 25 KMH.<br>
However, as the speed of the vehicle increases, the rate of electrical<br>
charge generation also increases. Thus, the time period required to<br>
generate sufficient electrical charge to enable the tyre monitoring system<br>
to measure and transmit the tyre parameters is reduced.<br>
To take advantage of this, the low power protocol described above can be<br>
modified so that the micro processor is "awoken" from its sleep mode at<br>
intervals relative to a function of the speed of the vehicle or the state of<br>
the electrical charge stored in the capacitors, which enables the<br>
transmission of data to be varied in proportion to the speed of the vehicle.<br>
The following example shows a preferred mode of operation, in which<br>
the rate of transmission of data from the tyre monitoring apparatus is<br><br><br>
proportional to the speed of the vehicle, starting with the monitoring<br>
system in a "sleep" mode, substantially as described in example 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
Stage 1 As the wheel rotates, storable power outputs are produced by the<br>
power generator, one per revolution, as described above. In this example,<br>
this characteristic of the power generator is used to monitor the speed of<br>
the vehicle and/or the state of charge of the capacitors. A small portion of<br>
each storable power output is signal conditioned to take in to<br>
consideration false triggers of power which may be experienced by the<br>
piezoelectric disc 14 during rotation of the wheel, for example<br>
accelerations/deflections which are caused by vibrations due to<br>
imperfections in the road surface. The conditioned signal is then supplied<br>
to an interrupt circuit in the microprocessor, which momentarily wakes<br>
the micro processor from its sleep mode and increments a counter in the<br>
micro processor. The microprocessor then returns instantly to the sleep<br>
mode.<br>
Stage 2 Both the average charge generated per revolution of the wheel<br>
and the value of stored charge sufficient to measure and transmit data<br>
from the unit 10 are known. Hence, the number of "interrupts" or<br>
increments of the counter required for the capacitors to store a charge<br>
sufficient for measurement and transmission of data from the apparatus<br>
can be calculated. Therefore, the micro processor can be set to "wake up",<br>
substantially as described in stage 2 of example 1, after a predetermined<br>
number of revolutions of the wheel, for example 50 revolutions. At this<br>
point, power is initiated to the internal circuitry of the microprocessor,<br>
which allows the main program of the microprocessor to be used and to<br>
enable the micro processor to enter a measure and control phase.<br><br><br>
The internal clock of the microprocessor monitors the time taken for the<br>
predetermined number of revolutions to be completed. Hence, a value of<br>
average speed of the vehicle during the time period can be calculated<br>
from the elapsed time and the distance travelled which is cross-<br>
referenced from a table of data relating to the diameter of the wheel.<br>
Stage 3 As described in example 1, once the micro processor has 'woken<br>
up', power is provided to the temperature and pressure sensor circuitry. A<br>
prescribed time is then allowed to elapse, for example 500 micro seconds,<br>
to facilitate settling of the sensor circuitry, after which time the micro<br>
processor measures the local pressure and temperature within the tyre.<br>
The values are then stored within the microprocessor and the power to the<br>
sensor circuitry is removed instantaneously.<br>
Stage 4 The stored pressure and temperature values are concatenated with<br>
a sensor identification and cyclic redundancy check, as described in stage<br>
4 of example 1, and the value of speed calculated during stage 2.<br>
Further stages 5 to 7 are then carried out substantially as described with<br>
reference to stages 5 to 7 in the above example.<br>
Since the speed of the data transmissions is proportional to the speed of<br>
the vehicle, this mode of operation provides a major safety improvement<br>
over known tyre monitoring apparatus, in that the information is<br>
transmitted and updated regularly, depending on the speed of the vehicle.<br>
This has particular advantage in that a catastrophic failure of a tyre is<br>
more likely to occur, possibly with greater consequences, at high vehicle<br>
speed. The unit 10 is more regularly updated at high vehicle speeds than<br>
at lower speed, thereby improving vehicle safety by warning the driver of<br>
any deflation of the vehicle tyres, for example.<br><br><br>
A power/sensor unit according to a further embodiment of the invention<br>
is indicated at 100 in Figure 6 to 11, which corresponds substantially to<br>
the unit 10 described above.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the unit 100 includes a housing 112, which<br>
consists of a base portion 116 and a cap 128 mounted on the base portion<br>
116. The housing 112 is removably mounted on a resilient base or footing<br>
151 made of a rubber or any other suitable material. A pair of resilient<br>
clip arms 153 are pivotably provided on the footing 151, for snap-fitting<br>
engagement with formations 117 on the base portion 116 of the housing<br>
112. The unit 100 can be simply removed from the footing 151 by<br>
unclipping the arms 153 from their engagement with the formations 117,<br>
for repair or installation in another tyre using a new footing 151, for<br>
example.<br>
The footing 151 is adapted to be permanently secured to an internal<br>
surface 159 of a tyre, as shown in Figure 10 and 11, and can be disposed<br>
of with the tyre after use. Two air channels 155 are provided in the<br>
footing 151, which have the dual function of allowing air movement<br>
about the unit 100, in use, and providing a footing of sufficient flexibility<br>
to aid protection and shock absorption for the internal components of the<br>
unit 100, whilst propagating the flexure of the tyre during rotation to the<br>
internal components of the unit 100.<br>
The footing 151 is generally elliptical and has a greater surface area than<br>
the base portion 116 of the housing 112. The shape and size of the footing<br>
151 is designed to spread the load of the unit 100 on a tyre, to reduce<br>
adverse tyre wear in the region of the unit 100, that may otherwise be<br>
expected when providing a localised mass on the inside of a tyre, the<br>
mass of the unit 100 being in the region of between 30-50 grams.<br><br><br>
Referring specifically to Figures 7 to 9, the internal configuration of the<br>
housing 112 and the internal components of the unit 100 will now be<br>
described.<br>
The unit 100 includes a piezoelectric element 114 mounted on a brass<br>
supporting disc 115, substantially as described with reference to Figures 1<br>
to 4. The base portion 116 of the housing 112 defines a compartment 118<br>
formed by a base wall 120 and a peripheral wall 121.<br>
Recesses 122 are formed in the peripheral wall 121, for supporting a part<br>
of the periphery of the brass disc 115. When supported on the base<br>
portion 116, the central portion of the brass disc 115 is spaced apart from<br>
the base wall 120. In this embodiment, tabs 123 are provided which<br>
extend over a portion of the recesses 122, for engagement with the<br>
periphery of the brass disc 115, for retaining the brass disc 115, and<br>
thereby the piezoelectric element 114, on the base portion 116.<br>
The unit 100 includes a one-piece moulded actuator 136 defining a<br>
chamber 137, which is movably mounted in the housing 112. A printed<br>
circuit board or PCB (not shown), corresponding to the PCB 32 described<br>
with reference to the embodiment of Figures 1 to 4 is mounted in the<br>
chamber 137. The PCB is in electrical communication with the<br>
piezoceramic disc 114 via wires (not shown), which pass through an<br>
aperture 139 in the floor of the chamber 137. The PCB is securely located<br>
on the actuator 136 by a potting compound (not shown), which protects<br>
the PCB during installation or transit of the unit 100, as well as from the<br>
harsh environment within a rotating pneumatic tyre in use.<br>
An elongate projection or nose 144 is formed on the underside of the<br>
actuator 136, as can be seen in Figure 8. In a normal rest position in the<br><br><br>
housing 112, the nose 144 is in contact with the piezoceramic disc 114, as<br>
can be seen in Figure 9. In the rest position, the underside of the actuator<br>
136 is spaced from an internal surface 141 of the base portion 116 by a<br>
distance of approximately 0.3 mm. In use, the piezoelectric element 114<br>
is deflected in the direction of the base wall 120 under action of the<br>
actuating mass, and it will be appreciated, therefore, that the maximum<br>
deflection is limited to approximately 0.3 mm, as the periphery of the<br>
actuator 136 comes into contact with the internal surface 141. This<br>
maximum deflection is limited to protect the piezoelectric element 114<br>
from excessive bending, and may be any suitable distance, for example<br>
between 0.2 and 0.5 mm. It will be appreciated that the components of the<br>
PCB and potting compound form part of an actuating mass for excitation<br>
of the piezoelectric element, with the actuator 136.<br>
The housing 112 is injection moulded from plastics and is adapted to<br>
withstand the harsh environment within a pneumatic vehicle tyre. The<br>
piezoceramic disc 114, and actuator 136 and control circuitry form are<br>
thus part of a power generator for use in a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
The unit 100 operates substantially in the same way as the unit 10, as<br>
described above therefore operation of the unit 100 is not described in<br>
significant detail.<br>
In summary, it will be appreciated that the units 10,100 each serve as a<br>
telemetry unit, which is capable of measuring and transmitting data<br>
relevant to tyre conditions local to the unit.<br>
The concept of mounting an in-tyre telemetry unit to the inner surface of<br>
a tyre by means of a sacrificial footing 151 which can be permanently<br><br><br>
bonded to the tyre is not limited to the application with units having a<br>
piezoelectric power generator as described above. The footing can be<br>
used with any suitable telemetry unit. Accordingly, the applicant may<br>
claim independent patent protection to this concept.<br><br><br>
