TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
APPARATUS AND PROCESS FOR MAKING<br>
TAPE USEFUL AS A TIRE CAP PLY FROM GREIGE FABRIC<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a process for<br>
making tape which can be used as cap plies, breakers and reinforcement<br>
in the carcass of tires, and in particular, an apparatus and process for<br>
making such a tape from greige fabric. The tape can be produced to the<br>
dimensions of the application, such as a cap ply of a specified number of<br>
ends.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The tire industry has long had considerable interest in belted tire<br>
constructions for reinforcing tires. An example of a tire reinforcement is<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 3,720, 569 to Kimble. This reinforcement is<br>
formed by passing a plurality of cords in the desired spaced relationship<br>
through an extruder. The cords may be coated with a rubber latex in a<br>
multiple dip operation to form a unitary strip. Such reinforcement<br>
constructions may offer the advantage of better road stability and longer<br>
tread life in both radial and bias ply constructions. However, such<br>
constructions are subject to belt-edge separation failures because the<br>
adhesion of the reinforcement to the tire rubber is inadequate.<br>
Cap plies that envelop radial tire belts may be used to help<br>
minimize such belt-edge separation failures. Initially, cap plies were<br>
applied as a full width strip with an overlap splice. Experience has shown<br>
that the splice could pull open during curing. In addition, there is a<br>
limitation on the extension of the belt, since the cap ply is applied over the<br>
belt. Moreover, with this configuration, the same width of material must be<br>
applied across the whole belt. As a result of these limitations, a narrower<br>
cap ply tape was developed in the 1990's. This tape is spirally wound<br>
about the belt. Such a tape is made by slitting rubberized fabric. The<br>
width of the tape depends on the number of cords per inch, which varies<br>
according to the tire manufacturer. It was found that such a tape can<br>
increase winding tension, as there is no splice. Also, such a tape can be<br><br>
applied in extra layers at the belt edges to improve tire performance.<br>
However, this process is dependent on several processes/steps, i.e.,<br>
weaving fabric, treating fabric to achieve good adhesion to the calendered<br>
rubber, compounding rubber, skimming or calandering the rubber onto the<br>
treated fabric and slitting the rubberized fabric to specific widths. These<br>
are inherently high cost/labor intensive procedures. Because of the slitting<br>
step, there may be cut cords on the edges of the tape, which may create<br>
edge fray. Consequently, such a process produces a fair amount of scrap<br>
material. Moreover, the tape so produced can be non-uniform, due to the<br>
possible varying number of single end cords in each strip. With each step<br>
the potential for error and the additive variances requires allowance for<br>
excessive tolerances in the tire building process. Finally, the addition of<br>
rubber to ensure good adhesion of the fabric to the tire rubber adds to the<br>
overall weight of the tire.<br>
The process for making belt cord fabric is similar to the slit fabric<br>
process in that it includes treating fabric, with, for example, an rfl dip to<br>
achieve good adhesion. However, the belt cord fabric differs in significant<br>
ways: the weft cord is identical to the warp cord, the fabric is ready-to-use<br>
in the belt building process in that it does not require slitting, and the fabric<br>
does not require a rubberizing step.<br>
Because of the inherent drawbacks in the slit rubberized fabric<br>
process, a process for the preparation of a cap ply tape from single end<br>
cords using a cross-head extruder has been developed. Such a process<br>
is commonly known as the "Steelastic® process", and is illustrated in Fig.<br>
1. In the Steelastic® process, shown generally at 1, a plurality of cords 2<br>
and rubber 3 are brought into a die head 4, where the cords are<br>
encapsulated by rubber to give a good adhesion to the tire rubber. A tape<br>
which comprises a plurality of rubberized single end cords is thus formed.<br>
The cords must be treated with a resourcinol-formaldehyde latex dip<br>
before they are brought into the die head to ensure good adhesion to the<br>
rubber introduced in the extrusion step.<br>
The Steelastic® process provides improved uniformity as compared<br>
to the slit rubberized fabric process, since there no possibility of uneven<br>
slitting and hence there is exact control of the number of single end cords<br>
in the tape. Moreover, this process has reduced scrap as compared to the<br>
slit rubberized fabric process, since there are no cut cords on the edges of<br>
the tape. In addition, longer lengths per roll of tape are possible with the<br>
Steelastic® process. However, the extruder and the die heads used in this<br><br>
process represent a major capital investment. Moreover, the tape itself is<br>
still dependent on a rubber compounding step and the addition/application<br>
of rubber as a means to ensure good adhesion to the tire rubber<br>
compounds, hence increasing weight and cost. In addition, the Steelastic®<br>
process requires above ambient pressures and temperatures. Therefore,<br>
there exists a need in the tire industry to develop a process for making<br>
tape or strip which can be used as cap plies, breakers and reinforcement<br>
in the carcass of tires, which is less capital intensive and less labor<br>
intensive than processes of the prior art. Moreover, there needs to be a<br>
process which produces more uniform tape and which does not produce<br>
waste. In addition, it would be desirable to produce a packaged tape or<br>
strip which is ready to apply to a tire as a cap ply or which can be used as<br>
breakers and reinforcement in the carcass of tires.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Applicants have recognized that cement flows much better than<br>
rubber, and that the use of cement for encapsulating single end cords is<br>
superior to the rubber used in the Steelastic® process. In addition,<br>
applicants have recognized that cement can be applied at ambient<br>
temperature and ambient pressure, as opposed to rubber in the<br>
Steelastic® process, which must be applied in a heated extruder. Thus,<br>
the present invention overcomes the problems associated with the prior art<br>
by providing a process which is does not require the use of extruder dies<br>
as in the Steelastic® process.<br>
In addition, the process of the present invention is not as labor<br>
intensive as the slit rubberized fabric process of the prior art, as it does not<br>
involve slitting of fabric. In addition, it is not as capital intensive as the slit<br>
rubberized fabric process, as it does not require a calender roll. Moreover,<br>
the process of the present invention avoids the potential for error in that it<br>
does not have a slitting step, and hence the possibility of non-uniformity<br>
due to the possible varying number of single end cords in each strip is<br>
virtually eliminated. Also, since there is no slitting step in the process of<br>
the present invention, no edge fray is created and there are no cut cords<br>
on the edges of the tape. Thus, the process of the present invention<br>
produces less scrap than the slit rubberized fabric process. Finally, the<br>
overall weight of the tire could be reduced, since there is no need to add<br>
rubber to ensure good adhesion of the fabric to the tire rubber.<br><br>
Therefore, in accordance with the present invention, there is<br>
provided a process for making a tape from a fabric. The process<br>
comprises dipping a fabric comprising a plurality of single end cords in a<br>
solvent-based cement that includes an elastomeric composition dissolved<br>
in a solvent, and drying the cement so that the majority of the solvent<br>
evaporates, thereby forming a tape comprising the fabric encapsulated in<br>
the elastomeric composition. The resulting ready-to-apply tape can be<br>
produced to the dimensions of the application, such as a cap ply of ten<br>
ends.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an<br>
apparatus and a process for making strip, or tape which can be used as<br>
cap plies, breakers and reinforcement in the carcass of tires. The process<br>
of the present invention will be described in the context of the operation of<br>
the apparatus of the present invention with respect to Figs. 2-7. The<br>
tape is made from a greige "belt-cord fabric" (as opposed to "tire-cord<br>
fabric"), or mini-fabric, which comprises a plurality of single ends cords.<br>
This belt-cord fabric can be made on a fabric loom, such as a fabric loom<br>
which is commercially available from Jakob Muller, AG, of Frick,<br>
Switzerland. This machine can be set to make fabric which has a width<br>
smaller than traditional tire-cord fabric used in the slit rubberizerd-fabric<br>
process. The width of the greige fabric is the width of the desired cap ply,<br><br>
typically about 1/4" - 3/8". This fabric can be made by running a plurality of<br>
single end cords in the warp direction. The number of single end cords per<br>
inch for cap plys or carcass applications varies depending on the cord<br>
construction, and for a particular construction, depending on the tire type<br>
and the tire manufacturer. A weft yarn is run in the cross-machine<br>
direction. The weft yarn is an elastic yarn which is covered with cotton.<br>
The purpose of the weft yam is to keep the single end cords in continuous,<br>
pre-determined proximity of one another.<br>
Typical synthetic yarns useful for the cords of the present invention<br>
are made from polyamides, such as 6,6 nylon, 6 nylon, or any copolymers<br>
thereof. Alternatively, the yarns may comprise polyesters, aramid fibers,<br>
rayon, glass or carbon, etc. A particularly suitable yarn for use with the<br>
present invention is T-728, which is a heat stabilized 66 nylon,<br>
commercially available from DUSA International of Wilmington, Delaware.<br>
To meet the strength and durability requirements for tire applications, the<br>
yarns are normally prepared from high viscosity polymers containing<br>
stabilizers and are drawn at high draw ratios to yield high tenacity yarns,<br>
as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,311,691.<br>
The greige fabric, shown generally at 10 in Fig. 2, enters the<br>
apparatus of the present invention. The apparatus of the present invention<br>
includes a frame having a plurality of vertical beams 12, a pair of<br>
horizontal beams 14, and a set of braces 16. The greige fabric is typically<br>
treated with an activator for bonding rubber to the cords. Typically, a<br>
resourcinol-formaldehyde latex (rfl) is used as the activator dip. This<br>
process is not shown as it is a standard industry practice. The treated<br>
fabric is sent to a guide roll 18, which may be optional, depending on the<br>
distance the fabric must travel. The treated fabric is then sent to a dip<br>
station, shown generally at 20 in Fig. 2. Dip station 20 includes a take-out<br>
22, a cement dip pan 24 and a mechanism 26 for lifting and lowering the<br>
dip pan.<br>
The fabric is dipped in the cement dip pan by the mechanism set<br>
forth below. As can be seen from Fig. 2 in particular, dip pan 22 includes<br>
a plurality of receiving rolls 32. The rolls keep the fabric advancing<br>
through the dip pan and ensure that the fabric is submerged in the dip<br>
pan. Rolls 32 include a plurality of crests 32a as shown in Fig. 4 and a<br>
plurality of grooves, or valleys 32b as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The fabric<br>
rests in the grooves 32b of the receiving roll. A press roll 34 is disposed<br>
above the middle dip pan roll 32. Press roll 34 includes a plurality of<br><br>
crests 34a and valleys 34b. As can be seen from Fig. 4, crests 34a mesh<br>
with the valleys 34b of receiving roll 32. It should be noted that several<br>
strips of fabric may be dipped at one time. The strips of fabric stay on the<br>
crests of the press roll and in the valleys of the dip pan roll to press the<br>
cement into the spaces between the strips of fabric as they travel through<br>
the dip pan. A solvated, or wet tape, is shown coming out of the grooves<br>
of the dip pan roll at 33 in Fig. 4. If several strips of fabric are dipped,<br>
guide rolls may be used at this point forward in the process to keep the<br>
strips of fabric separate.<br>
Again, variations of the specific equipment used may be made<br>
without departing from the scope of the present invention. For instance, if<br>
there is enough tension in the fabric as it travels through the dip pan, the<br>
use of the press roll may not be necessary. In this case, there just must<br>
be enough tension in the fabric to keep it in the valleys of the receiving roll<br>
of the dip pan. In this case, an appropriate support, such as a guide roll or<br>
a glass bar, can be used for the fabric.<br>
The dip that is used in the dip pan is a solvent-based cement. This<br>
solvent-based cement includes an elastomeric composition, which is<br>
dissolved in a solvent, such as toluene. This elastomeric composition may<br>
comprise, for example, but is not limited to, a natural rubber, or a natural<br>
rubber with styrene butadiene or styrene butadiene with polybutadiene.<br>
These constituent materials in the elastomeric composition may be mixed<br>
with reinforcing agents, activators and/or plasticizers, depending on the<br>
needs of the end user. The percentage of solvents in the cement depends<br>
on the speed at which the cords are run through the apparatus. This<br>
percentage is typically in the range of 10 - 30%.<br>
The solvated, or wet tape is then sent to a guide roll 36 and to<br>
another guide roll 38 as shown in Fig. 2, and more particularly in Fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 5 is a cut-away view showing a portion of an exemplary guide roll of<br>
the present invention. As can be seen from Fig. 5, grooves 40 are formed<br>
in the guide roll for accommodating the solvated tape. Ft should be noted<br>
that rather than using guide rolls for guiding the tape after it leaves the dip<br>
pan, sleeves may be used around the guide rolls after the dip pan. The<br>
purpose of either the guide rolls or the sleeves is to keep the tape aligned<br>
and to prevent it from rolling as it passes out of the apparatus as shown in<br>
Fig. 2.<br>
The solvated tape is then sent to an oven 42, where it goes through<br>
one pass, to another guide roll 44, and then another pass through the<br><br>
oven. In the oven, the fabric must be fixed in a single plane. This is done<br>
by maintaining the tension in the fabric, and is necessary to maintain the<br>
integrity of the tape. The cement, including the solvent and the<br>
elastomeric composition, are dried in the oven. This drying typically<br>
occurs at about 110° C for some period of time, which is dependent on the<br>
speed at which the greige fabric is being driven through the apparatus.<br>
The drying drives off, or evaporates, the majority of the solvent. What<br>
remains is the ready to apply fabric, encapsulated in the elastomeric<br>
composition, thereby forming the tape. This tape is shown at 46 in Fig. 6.<br>
In the final product, some small residual amount of solvent remains as a<br>
component of the tape. The solvent may comprise 0.0009 - 5% of the<br>
weight of the tape.<br>
From the oven, the tape is sent back through guide roll 38, to a<br>
series of guide rolls, 46, 48 and 50, and to a drive unit, shown generally at<br>
52 in Figs. 2 and 6. Another drive unit 54, including shaft 54a and rolls<br>
54b and 54c, is optional, and is used only when drive unit 52 is not<br>
operational. As can be seen from Fig. 2, drive unit 52 includes a shaft 52a<br>
and geared rolls 52b and 52c, for driving the tape through the apparatus.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the drive unit is supported in a frame 56, which<br>
includes a support bar 58 for presenting the tape as it moves through the<br>
apparatus. The support roll is held between a pair of supports 60.<br>
The tape, which is shown at 62 in Fig. 6, is then sent to a pair of<br>
type-two guide rolls, 62 and 64 and to a mechanism 66 for presenting the<br>
tape to an optional comb 68 as shown in Fig. 7. Mechanism 66 includes<br>
vertical supports 66a, a horizontal bar 66b as well as a roller 66c. The bar<br>
and the roller are held together by an end cap 66d. The tape rolls over<br>
roller 66c and is advanced to comb 68. The comb of Fig. 7 is similar to a<br>
comb used in a known single end cord process to keep the cords<br>
separated, except that in the comb of Fig. 7 has less teeth, and the teeth<br>
are more widely spaced, than a comb used in a known single end cord<br>
process, in order to accommodate the tape. The tape is then sent to a<br>
winder 70 as shown in Fig. 8, which is supported by a framework 72 as<br>
shown in Fig. 7. After the winder, the tape is sent to a bobbin 74, where it<br>
is wound and stored. A pair of bobbins is shown in Fig. 7.<br>
 After the comb, the tape is sent to a guide wheel 76 as shown in<br>
Fig. 8. The guide wheel is held onto the framework 72 of the winder by a<br>
fastener 78. From guide wheel 76 the tape is sent to another guide wheel<br>
80. Similar guide wheels can be found in a known apparatus for making<br><br>
single end cord; however, such guide wheels have crests and valleys for<br>
accommodating the single end cords. In contrast, in the apparatus of the<br>
present invention, the surfaces of both guide wheels 76 and 80 do not<br>
have crests and valleys, but rather are smoothed out to accommodate the<br>
tape. The use of such a guide wheel is optional in the present invention,<br>
and is used to ensure that the tape stays in place. As the tape moves<br>
from guide wheel 76 to guide wheel 80 and to the final package (i.e., the<br>
winder 70 with tape wound on it), the tension in the tape is maintained by<br>
a dancer arm 82. The end of the dancer arm pivots about an upper pivot<br>
point 84, and about a lower pivot point 86. The movement of the dancer<br>
arm is limited by a lower limit device 88, which keeps the dancer arm from<br>
hitting against the bobbin. Upper pivot point 84 and lower limit device 88<br>
are held against the framework by a plate 90, which fastens to the<br>
framework of the winder. A guide roll 92 guides the tape to a guide 94,<br>
through which the tape travels to be presented to the final package.<br>
With the present invention, because the individual cords are dipped<br>
in a cement, the cords have better access to the cement than to rubber in<br>
the prior art, because rubber does not flow as well as cement. Thus more<br>
complete coverage of the fabric, and the cords in the fabric, can be<br>
achieved as compared to processes of the prior art. Consequently, with<br>
the present invention it is possible to produce a superior tape as compared<br>
to the slit fabric or Steelastic® process. While it might be possible to<br>
achieve the desired encapsulation characteristics for elastomeric<br>
compositions such as rubber at high heat and high pressures, the present<br>
invention is able to achieve these desired encapsulation characteristics at<br>
ambient temperature and ambient pressure while the cement is being<br>
applied.<br>
The tape of the present invention is ready to use as a cap ply for a<br>
tire. When used in this application, the tape is wound directly onto the tire.<br>
The single end cord in the tape then adheres to the rubber in the tire<br>
curing process. Alternatively, as noted above, the tape may be used as a<br>
breaker and reinforcement in the carcass of tires. The tape of the present<br>
invention is generally about 1/4" to 3/8" wide.<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail with reference to<br>
the following example which is intended to illustrate the invention without<br>
restricting the scope thereof.<br><br>
EXAMPLE<br>
A tape was made using the apparatus of Fig. 2 as described above.<br>
A greige, single weft tire cord fabric made from nylon 6,6 was sent through<br>
the apparatus to a pre-dip pan where rfl dip was applied. The dip in the<br>
pre-dip pan was made by adding water, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), or<br>
caustic pellets, resourcinol flake and formaldehyde to a tank. This solution<br>
had a solids content of about 6%. The solution was mixed for<br>
approximately 30 minutes. This solution was then aged for a minimum of<br>
about 3 hours (minimum of 2 hours, maximum of 4 hours). In another<br>
tank, a latex was added. Then water was mixed with ammonium<br>
hydroxide, NH4OH and added to the latex slowly. Then an anti-foaming<br>
agent was added and this was mixed slowly. This solution had a solids<br>
content of about 35%. This solution was then combined with the solution<br>
from the first tank. The combined solutions were mixed together for about<br>
30 minutes prior to use. The fabric was dipped in this combined solution<br>
for about 3 seconds. The dip was cured a temperature of about 226° C,<br>
for a dwell time in the range of 100 and 200 seconds. The fabric was then<br>
sent to another oven, where the dip was cured at a temperature of 165° C.<br>
The fabric was then dipped in a mixture of toluene (85 kg) and a rubber-<br>
based elastomeric composition (15 kg). The toluene and the elastomeric<br>
composition were dried in an oven at a temperature of 110° C, so that the<br>
majority of the toluene was driven off. A tape which was M- inch wide was<br>
formed.<br><br>
