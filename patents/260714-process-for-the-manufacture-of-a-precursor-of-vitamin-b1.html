				<td>Process for the Manufacture of a Precursor of vitamin B1<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the manufacture of Grewe-diamine (GDA; 5-aminomethyl-2-methy]-pyrimidine-4-yl-amine) of formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
by hydrolysis of a N-(4-amino-2-methyl-pyrimidine-5-y3-methyl)-alkanamide with an aqueous alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide solution. More precisely, the present invention relates to the hydrolysis of such N-substituted alkanamide wherein the hydrolysis is carried out in the presence of an organic solvent, preferably in the presence of an organic solvent with a dielectric constant from 7 to 35, more preferably in the presence of an organic solvent which is essentially not soluble in water under the reaction conditions.<br>
GDA is an important precursor for the synthesis of vitamin BI, see e.g. G. Moine and H-P. Hohmann in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, VCH, Vol. A 27, 1996, 515-517 and the references cited therein.<br>
To perform the processes described in the prior art CEP-A 1 138 675, DE-A 35 11 373), i.e. the hydrolysis of N-acetyl GDA or N-formyl GDA, drastic reaction conditions are necessary, The process described in DE-A 3511 373 has the disadvantage that the overall yield is low and that the product has to be further purified by sublimation.<br>
Therefore, there existed a need for a process for the manufacture of GDA where the product is obtained in high yield and high purity.<br>
This need is, fulfilled by a process for the manufacture of Grewe-diamine comprising the following step (step a): hydrolyzing a compound of formula II,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is hydrogen or straight- or branched-chain CM alkyl, with an aqueous alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide solution in the presence of an organic solvent.<br>
Concerning substituent R: Substituent R is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl. Preferably R is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl or n-butyl, more preferably R is hydrogen or methyl; most preferably R is hydrogen.<br>
The manufacture of the compound of formula II is known to the person skilled in the art and may be, e.g., performed as described in any of JP 58-065 279 (publication number; application number: 56-162 106), EP-A 0 172 515, EP-A 0 001 760, US 4,226,799 and<br>
DE-A35 11 273.<br>
Concerning the organic solvent: Examples of suitable organic solvents are such organic solvents that have a dielectric constant (εr) in the range from 7 to 35 (see C, Reichardt, Solvents and Solvent Effects in Organic Chemistry, VCH, 1988, p. 408-410), Examples of preferred solvents are aliphatic alcohols, especially aliphatic C1-4-alcohols, ethers and mixtures thereof. Examples of more preferred solvents are those which are essentially not soluble in water under the reaction conditions.<br>
"Essentially not soluble in water under the reaction conditions" means that a biphasic liquid system is formed. A biphasic liquid system is, e.g., formed under the reaction conditions with aliphatic C3-4alcohols, ethers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of aliphatic C1-4-alcohols are methanol, ethanol, propan-1-ol, propan-2-ol, bu~ tan-l-ol, butan-2-ol, 2-methyl-propan-2-ol, and 2-methyl-propan-l-ol.<br>
The most preferred aliphatic C3-4-alcohols are selected from the group consisting of pro-pan-]-ol, propan-2-ol, butan-1-ol, butan-2-ol, and 2-methyl-propan-2-ol, more preferably selected from the group consisting of propan-2-ol, butan-1-ol, and butan-2-ol. These are also the most preferred organic solvents used in the process according to the present invention.<br>
Preferred ethers are ethers, in which GDA is soluble. The most preferred ethers are tetra-hydrofuran, and 1,2-dimethoxyethane,<br>
Concerning the alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxide: Examples are sodium, potassium, caesium, calcium and magnesium hydroxide with sodium hydroxide being preferred.<br>
Concerning the alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxide solution: Preferably the solution has a concentration in the range of from 5 to 30 weight-%, more preferably in the range of from 15 to 28 weight-%.<br>
Reaction conditions:<br>
Conveniently the hydrolysis (step a) is carried out at a temperature in the range of from 20 to 110°C, preferably at a temperature in the range of from 30°C to 90°C, more preferably at a temperature in the range of from 40DC to 85 °C.<br>
Conveniently the reaction time is in the range of from 30 to 240 minutes, preferably in the range of from 30 to 120 minutes.<br>
Conveniently the reaction is carried out at normal pressure and may be carried out under air atmosphere.<br>
In specific embodiments of the invention the process comprises further steps. These steps depend on the organic solvent used (in step a).<br>
If the hydrolysis (step a) is, e.g., carried out in the presence of an organic solvent which is essentially not soluble in water under the reaction conditions the process may further comprise additional steps bl), cl), dl) and d2) (see below).<br>
If the hydrolysis (step a) is carried out in the presence of methanol the process may further comprise additional step b2) (see below).<br>
If the hydrolysis (step a) is carried out in the presence of ethanol the process may further comprise additional steps b3), c3) and d3) (see below).<br>
If the hydrolysis (step a) is carried out in the presence of an organic solvent which is essentially not soluble in water under the reaction conditions the process of the present invention preferably comprises the following additional step(s)<br>
bl) phase separating the reaction mixture after the end of the reaction in an aqueous and in an organic phase;<br>
cl) optionally extracting the aqueous phase with the solvent being essentially not soluble in water and combining the organic phases.<br>
Step bl):<br>
The aqueous phase, i.e. the aqueous alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide solution, and the solvent being essentially not soluble in water form a biphasic liquid system. After the end of the reaction, i.e., when the compound of the formula II has been hydrolysed to GDA, the two phases are separated from each other. The aqueous phase contains the alkali or alkaline earth metal formate formed during the reaction and the organic phase contains the solvent and the product.<br>
Preferably the phase separation is performed at a temperature in the range of from 40°C to 80°C, more preferably at a temperature in the range of from 50°C to 70°C.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention steps a), bl) and cl) are performed subsequently in the order given (which is the best mode of the invention).<br>
According to other specific embodiments of the process of the present invention the isolation of the product GDA may be effected by either of two alternatives dl) and d2) for the workup,<br>
Alternative 1 (step dl)):<br>
After the steps a), bl) and cl) have been performed the solvent being essentially not soluble in water is evaporated from the organic phase. This evaporation is preferably carried out at a temperature of from 40°C to 80°C and/or at a pressure of from 5 to 30 mbar.<br>
Alternative 2 (step d2)):<br>
After the steps a), bl) and cl) have been performed the GDA is crystallised from the separated organic phase. This may be achieved by cooling down the organic phase, preferably to a temperature of from 20 to -10°C, more preferably to a temperature of from 5 to 0°C. From the mother liquor additional GDA can be crystallised. The GDA crystals are then separated from the liquid.<br>
If the hydrolysis (step a) is carried out in the presence of methanol the process preferably further comprises step b2):<br>
b2) crystallising the Grewe-diamine from the reaction solution.<br>
This may be achieved by cooling down the reaction solution, preferably to a temperature in the range of from 20 to -10°C, more preferably to a temperature in the range of from 5 to 0°C. From the mother liquor additional GDA can be crystallised. The GDA crystals are then separated from the liquid.<br>
If the hydrolysis (step a) is carried out in the presence of ethanol the process preferably further comprises steps b3), c3) and d3);<br>
b3) crystallising the by-product alkali or alkaline earth formate from the reaction solution, c3) separating the crystallised alkali or alkaline earth formate from the reaction solution, and<br>
d3) evaporating water and ethanol from the remaining reaction solution.<br>
Step b3) may be achieved by cooling down the reaction solution, preferably to a temperature in the range of from 20 to -10°C, more preferably to a temperature in the range of from 5 to 0°C. From the mother liquor additional alkali or alkaline earth metal formate can be crystallised.<br>
A further advantage of the process of the present invention, besides the high yield (preferably &gt; 98%) and the high purity of the product (preferably &gt; 97%), is that the GDA obtained is essentially free from aniline, 2-chloroaniline and/or from any alkali or alkaline earth metal formate. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the content of 2-chloroaniline is below 
The thus obtained GDA may, e.g., be further reacted with carbon disulfide and 3-chloro-5-acetoxypentan-2-one or another chloroketone derivate such as 3-chloro-5-hydroxypentan-2-one, 3-mercapto-5-hydroxypentan-2-one or 3-mercapto-5-acetoxypentan-2-one to form the compound of formula III<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with R1 being C1-4~alkanoyl, preferably aceryl (see e.g. G. Moine and H-P. Hohmann in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, VCH, Vol. A 27,1996,515-517 and the references cited therein).<br>
Therefore, such a process for the manufacture of a compound of the formula III is also a part of the present invention.<br>
The compound of formula in may then further be reacted with an acid to form the compound of formula IV<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(see e.g. G. Moine and H-P. Hohmann in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, VCH, Vol. A 27, 1996, 515-517 and the references cited therein).<br>
Therefore, such a process for the manufacture of a compound of formula IV is also a part of the present invention.<br><br>
The compound of the formula IV may then further be oxidized, preferably with vitamin BI of formula V<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(see e.g. G. Moine and H-P. Hohmann in "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, VCH, Vol. A 27, 1996,515-517 and the references cited therein).<br>
Therefore, the present invention comprises a process for the manufacture of vitamin Bj wherein a compound of formula II<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with R being hydrogen or straight- or branched chain C1-4 alkyl is hydrolysed to Grewe-diamine according to the process of the present invention described above in detail, the thus obtained Grewe-diamin is further reacted to a compound of formula IV,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
preferably as described above in more detail, and the thus obtained compound of formula IV is further oxidized, preferably with H2O2, to yield vitamin Bl.<br>
Finally the present invention comprises the use of GDA obtained according to the process of the present invention as described above as intermediate in a process for the manufacture of vitamin Bl.<br>

Fig. 1 gives a short overview over the processes wherein methanol or ethanol are used as a solvent for the hydrolysis of a compound of the formula II (left side) and the processes wherein aliphatic C3- or C4 alcohols are used as a solvent for the hydrolysis of a compound of the formula II (right side).<br>
When methane! or ethanol are used as a solvent for the hydrolysis of a compound of the formula H the reaction solution is a homogeneous reaction system, whereas when aliphatic C3- or C4-alcohols are used as a solvent for the same purpose the reaction solution is a heterogeneous reaction system.<br>
If methanol is used as the solvent, the GDA may be obtained by crystallisation out of the reaction solution.<br>
If ethanol is used as the solvent, the by-product sodium formate is separated from the product GDA by crystallisation. The QDA itself is then obtained by concentration of the solution after separation of the crystalline sodium formate (see table 2 below). When aliphatic C3 or C4-alcohols or mixtures thereof are used as the solvent the water and the organic phase are separated at the end of the reaction and the GDA is either obtained by concentration of the organic phase (see alternative 1 above) or by crystallisation of the GDA out of the organic phase (see alternative 2 above).<br>
Fig. 2 shows a scheme of an example of the work-up and isolation of the hydrolysed GDA according to the present invention when the hydrolysis is performed in an aliphatic C3-alcohol or mixtures thereof, As starting material NFGDA with a purity of 95% and a content of 2-chloroaniline of a maximum of 4000 ppm is used. The hydrolysis is carried out by reacting a C3-alcohol solution containing 20 weight-% NFGDA (based on the total amount of the reaction solution) with an aqueous NaOH solution containing 1.05 mol equivalents of NaOH (based on the molar amount of NFGDA) at a temperature of from 80 to 85°C for 2 to 5 hours. Afterwards the organic and the aqueous phase are separated from each other at a temperature of from 40 to 60°C.<br>
The water phase is extracted with the C3-alcohol and then evaporated to regain the sodium formate in a yield of 80 to 90% based on the amount of the sodium formate (= amount of NFGDA used) formed during the hydrolysis (see right side of the figure), For the work-up of the organic phase there are two alternatives: According to alternative 1 (left side) the organic phase is concentrated, i.e. the solvent is evaporated, at a temperature of 50°C and at a pressure of 10 mbar. In the thus separated Cs-alcohol 90-95% of the 2-chloroaniline contained in the starting material are found. The thus isolated GDA is further dried at a temperature of 60°C and at a pressure of 20 mbar for 12 hours. The thus obtained GDA has a purity of 90-94%, a content of 2-crloroaniline below 250 ppm, it contains 6-10% of sodium formate and the isolated yield of GDA (based on the amount of NFGDA used) is 93-98%.<br>
According to alternative 2 (middle) the organic phase is cooled to a temperature of 0°C for 12 hours whereby the GDA crystallises. The separated crystals are then dried at a temperature of 60°C and at a pressure of 20 mbar for 12 hours. The thus obtained GDA has a purity of 94-96%, &amp; content of 2-chloroaniline below 50 ppm, it contains 4-6% of sodium formate and the isolated yield of GDA (based on the amount of NFGDA used) is 75-80%.<br>
Fig. 3 shows, a scheme of an example of the work-up and isolation of the hydrolysed GDA according to the present invention when the hydrolysis is performed in an aliphatic C4-alcohol or mixtures thereof. As starting material NFGDA with a purity of 95% and a maximum content of 2-chloroaniline of 4000 ppm is used. The hydrolysis is carried out by reacting a C4-alcohol solution containing 20 weight-% NFGDA (based on the total amount of the reaction solution) with an aqueous NaOH solution containing 1.05 mol equivalents of NaOH (based on the molar amount of NFGDA) at a temperature of from 80 to 100°C for ] to 4 hours. Afterwards the organic and the aqueous phase are separated from each other at a temperature of from 40 to 60°C.<br>
The water phase is extracted with the C4-alcohol and then evaporated to regain the sodium formate in a yield of 80 to 90% based on the amount of the sodium formate (= amount of NFGDA used) formed during the hydrolysis (see right side of the figure). For the work-up of the organic phase there are two alternatives: According to alternative 1 (left side) the organic phase is concentrated, i.e. the solvent is evaporated, at a temperature of 60°C and at a pressure of 20 mbar. In the thus separated C4-alcohol 90-95% of the 2-chloroaniline contained in the starting material are found. The thus isolated GDA is further dried at a temperature of 60°C and at a pressure of 20 mbar for 12 hours. The thus obtained GDA has a purity of 93-95%, a content of 2-chloroaniline below 250 ppm, it contains 2-6% of sodium formate and the isolated yield of GDA (based on the amount of NFGDA used) is 96-98%.<br>
According to alternative 2 (middle) the organic phase is cooled to a temperature of 0°C for 12 hours whereby the GDA crystallises. The separated crystals are then dried at a temperature of 60°C and at a pressure of 20 mbar for 12 hours. The thus obtained GDA has a purity of 94-97%, a content of 2-chloroaniline below 50 ppm, it contains 2-4% of sodium formate and the isolated yield of GDA (based on the amount of NFGDA used) is 75-80%.<br>
