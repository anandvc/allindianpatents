				<td>A RACEMATE, DIASTEREOISOMER, OR OPTICAL ISOMER OF A COMPOUND<br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds, processes for their synthesis, compositions and methods for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In particuLar, the present invention provides novel peptide analogs, pharmaceutical compositions containing such analogs and methods for using these analogs in the treatment of HCV infection.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major etiological agent of post-transfusion and community-acquired non-A non-B hepatitis worldwide. It is estimated that over 200 million people worldwide are infected by the virus. A high percentage of carriers become chronically infected and many progress to chronic liver disease, so-called chronic hepatitis C. This group is in turn at high risk for serious liver disease such as liver cirrhosis, hepatocelluLar carcinoma and terminal liver disease leading to death.<br>
The mechanism by which HCV establishes viral persistence and causes a high rate of chronic liver disease has not been thoroughly elucidated. It is not known how HCV interacts with and evades the host immune system. In addition, the roles of celluLar and humoral immune responses in protection against HCV infection and disease have yet to be established. ImmunoglobuLins have been reported for prophylaxis of transfusion-associated viral hepatitis, however, the Center for Disease Control does not presently recommend immunoglobuLin treatment for this purpose. The lack of an effective protective immune response is hampering the development of a vaccine or adequate post-exposure prophylaxis measures, so in the near-term, hopes are firmly pinned on antiviral interventions.<br>
Various clinical studies have been conducted with the goal of identifying pharmaceutical agents capable of effectively treating HCV infection in patients afflicted with chronic hepatitis C. These studies have involved the use of interferon-alpha, alone and in combination with other antiviral agents. Such studies have shown that a substantial number of the participants do not respond to these<br>
therapies, and of those that do respond favorably, a large proportion were found to relapse after termination of treatment.<br>
Until recently, interferon (IFN) was the only available therapy of proven benefit approved in the clinic for patients with chronic hepatitis C. However the sustained response rate is low, and interferon treatment also induces severe side-effects (i.e. retinopathy, thyroiditis, acute pancreatitis, depression) that diminish the quality of life of treated patients. Recently, interferon in combination with ribavirin has been approved for patients non-responsive to IFN alone. However, the side effects caused by IFN are not alleviated with this combination therapy. Pegylated forms of interferons such as PEG-lntron® and Pegasys® can apparently partially address these deleterious side-effects but antiviral drugs' still remain the avenue of choice for oral treatment of HCV.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for the development of effective antiviral agents for treatment of HCV infection that overcome the limitations of existing pharmaceutical therapies.<br>
HCV is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family. The single strand HCV RNA genome is approximately 9500 nucleotides in length and has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. In infected cells, this polyprotein is cleaved at muLtiple sites by celluLar and viral proteases to produce the structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. In the case of HCV, the generation of mature nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases. The first one, as yet poorly characterized, cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction (henceforth referred to as NS2/3 protease); the second one is a serine protease contained within the N-terminal region of NS3 (NS3 protease) and mediates all the subsequent cleavages downstream of NS3, both in cis, at the NS3-NS4A cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B sites. The NS4A protein appears to serve muLtiple functions, acting as a cofactor for the NS3 protease and possibly assisting in the membrane localization of NS3 and other viral replicase • components. The complex formation of the NS3 protease with NS4A seems necessary to the processing events, enhancing the proteolytic efficiency at all of the<br>
sites. The NS3 protein also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities. NS5B is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the replication of HCV.<br>
A general strategy for the development of antiviral agents is to inactivate virally encoded enzymes that are essential for the replication of the virus.<br>
More recently, the NS3 protease has been found to potentially have an additional impact by blocking the IFN-mediated celluLar antiviral activity in the infected cell (Foy et a/., Science, 17 April 2003). This lends credence to a hypothesis that the NS3/NS4A protease may represent a dual therapeutic target, the inhibition of which may both block viral replication and restore interferon response of HCV infected cells.<br>
wherein a preferred meaning of R2 is an unsubstituted or mono- or disubstituted quinolinyl residue as defined therein, are described as hepatitis C viral NS3 protease inhibitors, an enzyme essential for the replication of the hepatitis C virus.<br>
The present invention provides tripeptide compounds that have improved potency against the HCV NS3 protease. Furthermore, compounds being highly active in cell cuLture are provided.<br>
An advantage of one aspect of the present invention resides in the fact that compounds according to this Invention specifically inhibit the NS3 protease and do not show significant inhibitory activity against other human serine proteases such as human leukocyte elastase (HLE), or cysteine proteases such as human liver cathepsin B (Cat B).<br>
Compared to the compounds as disclosed in WO 00/09543, compounds as provided by this invention exhibit unexpected advantages. In general they show one or more of the following advantages:<br>
- lower IC50 values in a NS3-NS4A protease assay;<br>
- lower EC6o values in a cell based HCV RNA replication assay;<br>
- better solubility; and/or<br>
- higher plasma levels when administered orally in the rat.<br>

METHODOLOGY<br>
Several ways of carrying out the synthesis of compounds of formuLa I with different quinoline derivatives are disclosed In WO 00/09558. The dipeptide intermediate 15 (Scheme 2) and 2-carbomethoxy-4-hydroxy-7-methoxyquinoline 9 (Scheme 1) were synthesized according to the general methods described in WO 00/09543.<br>
Compounds of formuLa I wherein Rc is NHSO2Rs as defined herein are prepared by coupling the corresponding acid of formuLa I (i.e. Rc is hydroxy) with an appropriate suLfonamide of formuLa RsSOaNH2 in the presence of a coupling agent under standard conditions. Although several commonly used coupling agents can be employed, TBTU and HATU have been found to be practical. The suLfonamides are available commercially or can be prepared by known methods.<br>
The following schemes illustrate two convenient processes using known methods for preparing the compounds of formuLa 1 when R1 is vinyl and Rc is OH.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
Briefly, the synthesis of dipeptide 3 is carried out by coupling the P1 residue to the properly protected frans-hydroxy proline under standard conditions. The stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group is Inverted by the well known Mitsunobu reaction using para-nitrobenzpic acid. Coupling of dipeptide with the P3 moiety (prepared using standard methodology and exemplified in the examples section) yielded tripeptide 6. introduction of the quinoline moiety to the hydroxyl group of the tripeptide 7 with inversion of stereochemistry can be carried out using either a Mitsunobu reaction or by converting the free hydroxyl group into a good leaving group (such as a brpsylate) and displacing it with the hydroxyl quinoline derivative 9. For the synthesis of the 2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl) derivatives, the quinoline used contains a 2-carbomethoxy group as shown in 9. Conversion of the carboxylate group to the aminothiazole derivative is carried out by well known synthetic methodology and is described and exemplified in WO 00/09543 and WO 00/09598. Finally the C-terminal ester is hydrolyzed under basic aqueous conditions.<br>
Scheme 2 describes another reaction sequence for making compounds of FormuLa I. In this case the quinoline moiety is introduced to the dipeptide in a similar way as described in Scheme 1. Finally, the P3 moiety is coupled under standard conditions to the dipeptide 21. Conversion of the resuLting tripeptide to the final compound is carried out as described in Scheme 1.<br>
SYNTHESIS OF P1 FRAGMENTS<br>
P1 moieties of compounds of FormuLa (1) were prepared using the protocols outlined in WO 00/59929, published October 12, 2000, and WO 00/09543, published on February 24,2000. In particuLar, reference is made to pages 33-35, Example 1 of WO00/59929 and Pages 56-69 , Example 9-20 of WO00/09543 for the preparation of 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylicacid P1 moieties.<br>
SYNTHESIS OF P2 SUBSTITUENTS<br>
Compounds of formuLa 9 can be synthesized from commercially available materials using the techniques described in International Patent Applications WO 00/59929, WO 00/09543, WO 00/09558 and U.S. Patent 6,323,180 B1.<br>
Examples of synthesis of different 2-carbomethoxy-4-hydroxyquinoline derivatives were carried out as follows:<br><br>
Synthesis of 2-carbomethoxy-4-hydroxy-quinoline derivatives was carried out from the corresponding anilines according to the procedure of: Unangst, P.C.; Connor, D.T. J. Heterocyc. Chem. 29, 5,1992,1097-1100. The procedure is shown in scheme 3 below:<br>
Briefly, properly substituted anilines at the 2, 3 and/or 4 position are allowed to react with dimethyl acetylene dicarboxylate and the resuLting enamine is heated at high temperatures to effect the cyclization.<br>
The corresponding anilines are commercially available or may require some well known chemical transformation. For example it can be that the nitro is commercially available and is then converted to the corresponding amine by using a reducing agent. Also when the carboxylic acid is commercially available, it can be transformed into the corresponding amine via a Curtius rearrangement.<br>
Further details of the invention are illustrated in the following examples which are understood to be non-limiting with respect to the appended claims. Other specific ways of synthesis or resolution of the compounds of this invention can be found in WO 00/09543; WO 00/09558 &amp; WO 00/59929 and in co-pending application 09/368,670, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>

Step 1: Formation of the aminothlazole ring<br>
A series of 8-mL vials were disposed in a reaction block from an ACT496 synthesizer (from Advanced Chemtech). In each vial was added the thio-derivatlve (8) of interest (0.0688 mmole), the bromoketone (0.0625 mmole) and isopropanol (500 uL). The closed vials were heated at 70°C for 1 h. The solvent was then evaporated using a vacuum centrifuge (SpeedVac) and was co-evaporated with 1,2-dlchloroethane. The crude products were dried under high vacuum overnight.<br>
Step 2: Removal of the Boc protecting group .<br>
All the vials were treated with 30% TFA in DCM (500 uL) for 1 h. All vials were<br>
transferred on a vacuum centrifuge to remove the volatile material.<br>
Step 3: Coupling<br>
In each vial was added the corresponding carbamate (21c to 21 g) and carbamate<br>
acid (4b to 4k) (0.0875 mmole), HATU (0.0875 mmole, 33.27 mg) and DIPEA (0.313<br>
mmole, 55 uL) in 500 uL of DMSO and the reaction mixture was allowed to proceed<br>
overnight.<br>
Step 4: Saponification and Purification<br>
All reactions were diluted with 400 uL of DMSO and 200 uL THF. A solution of 500 uL of 2N aq LiOH (1 mmol) was added to each vial and allowed to proceed overnight after which time, the mixture was neutralized by the addition of 400 uL of AcOH. All compounds were purified by semi-prep reversed-phase HPLC (Symmetry column 5 cm x 19 cm, CH3CN / H20 0.06% TFA gradient).<br>

Cell Based HCV RNA Replication Assay<br>
Cell CuLture<br>
Huh7 cells that stably maintain a subgenomic HCV replicon were established as previously described (Lohman et al., 1999. Science 285:110-113) and designated as the S22.3 cell-line. S22.3 cells are maintained in DuLbecco's Modified Earle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 mg/mL neomycin (Standard Medium). During the assay, DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, containing 0.5% DMSO and lacking neomycin was used (Assay Medium). 16 hours prior to compound addition, S22.3 cells are trypsinized and diluted to 50 000 cells/mL in Standard Medium. 200 uL (10 000-cells) are distributed into each well of a 96-well plate. The plate was then incubated at 37°C with 5% C02 until the next day.<br>
-104-<br>
Preparation of Test Compound<br>
10 uL of test compound (in 100% DMSO) was added to 2 m!_ of Assay Medium for a final DMSO concentration of 0.5% and the solution was sonicated for 15 min and filtered through a 0.22 uM Millipore Filter Unit. 900 uL was transferred into row A of a Polypropylene Deep-Well Titer Plate. Rows B to H contain 400 uL aliquots of Assay Medium (containing 0.5% DMSO), and are used to prepare serial dilutions (1/2) by transferring 400 uL from row to row (no compound was included in row H).<br>
Application.of test compound to cells<br>
Cell cuLture medium was aspirated from the 96-well plate containing the S22.3 cells. 175 uL of assay medium with the appropriate dilution of test compound was transferred from each well of the compound plate to the corresponding well of the cell cuLture plate (row H was used as the "No inhibition control"). The cell cuLture plate was incubated at 37°C with 5% C02for 72 h.<br>
Extraction of Total CelluLar RNA<br>
Following the 72 h incubation period, the total celluLar RNA was extracted from the S22.3 cells of the 96-well plate using the RNeasy 96 kit (Qiagen®, RNeasy Handbook. 1999.). Briefly, assay medium was completely removed from cells and . 100 uL of RLT buffer (Qiagen®) containing 143 mM p-mercaptoethanol was added to each well of the 96-well cell-cuLture plate. The microplate was gently shaken for 20 sec. 100 uL of 70% ethanol was then added to each microplate well, and mixed by pipetting. The lysate was removed and applied to the wells of a RNeasy 96 (Qiagen®) plate that was placed on top of a Qiagen® Square-Well Block. The RNeasy 96 plate was sealed with tape and the Square-Well Block with the RNeasy<br>
96 plate was loaded into the holder and placed in a rotor bucket of a 4K15C centrifuge. The sample was centrifuged at 6000 rpm (-5600 x g) for 4 min at room temperature. The tape was removed from the plate and 0.8 mL of Buffer RW1 (Qiagen® RNeasy 96 kit) was added to each well of the RNeasy 96 plate. The RNeasy 96 plate was sealed with a new piece of tape and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 4 min at room temperature. The RNeasy 96 plate was placed on top of another clean Square-Well Block, the tape removed and 0.8 mL of Buffer RPE (Qiagen® RNeasy 96 kit) was added to each well of the RNeasy 96 plate. The RNeasy 96 plate was sealed with a new piece of tape and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 4 min at room temperature. The tape was removed and another 0.8 mL of Buffer RPE (Qiagen® RNeasy 96 kit) was added to each well of the RNeasy 96 plate. The RNeasy 96 plate was sealed with a new piece of tape and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Tape was removed, the RNeasy 96 plate was placed on top of a rack containing 1.2-mL collection microtubes. The RNA was eluted by adding 50 uL of RNase-free water to each well, sealing plate with a new piece of tape and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. The plate was then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 4 min at room temperature. The elution step was repeated with a second volume of 50 uL RNase-free water. The microtubes with total celluLar RNA are stored at -70°.<br>
Quantification of Total CelluLar RNA<br>
RNA was quantified on the STORM® system (MolecuLar Dynamics®) using the RiboGreen® RNA Quantification Kit (MolecuLar Probes®). Briefly, the RiboGreen reagent was diluted 200-fold in TE (10 mM Tris-HCI pH =7.5, 1 mM EDTA). Generally, 50 uL of reagent was diluted in 10 mL TE. A Standard Curve of ribosomal RNA was diluted in TE to 2 ug/mL and pre-determined amounts (100, 50, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 0 uL) of the ribosomal RNA solution are then transferred in a new 96-well plate (COSTAR # 3997) and the volume was completed to 100 uL with TE. Generally, column 1 of the 96-well plate was used for the standard curve and the other wells are used for the RNA samples to be quantified. 10 uL of each RNA sample that was to be quantified, was transferred to the corresponding well of the 96-well plate and 90 uL of TE was added. One volume (100 uL) of diluted RiboGreen reagent was added to each well of the 96-well plate and incubated for 2 to 5 minutes at room temperature, protected from light (a 10 (iL RNA sample in a<br>
200 uL final volume generates a 20X dilution). The fluorescence intensity of each well was measured on the STORM® system (MolecuLar Dynamics®). A standard curve was created on the basis of the known quantities of the ribosomal RNA and the resuLting fluorescent intensities. The RNA concentration in the experimental samples was determined from the standard curve and corrected for the 20X dilution.<br><br>
Real-Time R.T.-PCR<br>
The Real-Time R.T.-PCR was performed on the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System using the TaqMan EZ R.T.-PCR Kit from (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems®). R.T.-PCR was optimized for the quantification of the 5' IRES of HCV RNA by using the Taqman technology (Roche MolecuLar Diagnostics Systems) similar to the technique previously described (Martell et a!., 1999. J. Clin. Microbiol. 37: 327-332). The system exploits the 5'-3" nucleolytic activity of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. Briefly, the method utilizes a dual-labeled fluorogenic hybridization probe (PUTR Probe) that specifically anneals to the template between the PCR primers (primers 8125 and 7028). The 5' end of the probe contains a fluorescent reporter (6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM]) and the 3' end contains a fluorescent quencher (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine [TAMRA]). The FAM reporter's emission spectrum was suppressed by the quencher on the intact hybridization probe. Nuclease degradation of the hybridization probe releases the reporter, resuLting in an increase in fluorescence emission. The ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector measures the increase in fluorescence emission continuously during the PCR amplification such that the amplified product was directly proportion to the signal.<br>
The amplification plot was analysed early in the reaction at a point that represents the logarithmic phase of product accumuLation. A point representing a defined detection threshold of the increase in the fluorescent signal associated with the exponential growth of the PCR product for the sequence detector was defined as the cycle threshold (Cr). CT values are inversely proportional to the quantity of input HCV RNA; such that under identical PCR conditions, the larger the starting concentration of HCV RNA, the lower the CT. A standard curve was created automatically by the ABI Prism 7700 detection system by plotting the CT against each standard dilution of known HCV RNA concentration.<br>
Reference samples for the standard curve are included on each R.T.-PCR plate. HCV Replicon RNA was synthesized (by T7 transcription) in vitro, purified and quantified by OD2eo- Considering that 1 ug of this RNA = 2.15 X 1011 RNA copies, dilutions are made in order to have 10s, 107, 106,10s, 104,103 or TO2 genomic RNA copies / 5 uL Total celluLar Huh-7 RNA was also incorporated with each dilution (50 ng / 5 uL). 5 uL of each reference standard (HCV Replicon + Huh-7 RNA) was combined with 45 uL of Reagent Mix, and used in the Real-Time R.T.-PCR reaction.<br>
The Real-Time R.T.-PCR reaction was set-up for the experimental samples that were purified on RNeasy 96 -well plates by combining 5 uL of each total celluLar RNA sample with 45 uL of Reagent Mix.<br>
Following the termination of the R.T.-PCR reaction the data analysis requires setting of threshold fluorescence signal for the PCR plate and a standard curve was constructed by plotting the Cr value versus RNA copy number used in each reference reaction. The CT values obtained for the assay samples are used to interpolate an RNA copy number based on the standard curve. Finally, the RNA copy number was normalized (based on the RiboGreen RNA quantification of the total RNA extracted from the cell cuLture well) and expressed as genome equivalents / ug of total RNA [g.e./ug].<br>
The RNA copy number [g.e./ug] from each well of the cell cuLture plate was a measure of the amount of replicating HCV RNA in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor. The % inhibition was calcuLated with the following equation: <br>
A non-linear curve fit with the Hill model was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (EC50) was calcuLated by the use of SAS software (Statistical Software System; SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, N.C.).<br>
When the compounds of this invention are evaluated in the preceding en2ymatic and cell based assays, the compounds are found to be highly active.<br>

Based on the initial testing where each compound was spiked into rat plasma and run through HPLC or HPLC/MS at a concentration of 0.5 //M, the retention time, ionic mass, and the possible separation among compounds by HPLC and/or HPLC/MS were used as basis for pooling 3-4 compounds into one "cassette".<br>
2. Oral vehicle and compound preparation:<br>
Each "cassette" contains 3-4 compounds at 5 or 4 mg/kg for each compound. The cassettes were prepared as an oral suspension in 0.5% aqueous methylcelluLose and 0.3% of polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate (Tween-80). The dosing volume was 10 mL/kg via oral gavage.<br>
3. Dosing and plasma sampling:<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats were fasted overnight in individual cages, with access to aqueous 10% dextrose. Two rats were dosed with each "cassette". Plasma samples (~1 mL) were collected at 1 and 2 h post-dosing from the 2 rats and pooled for extraction and analysis.<br>
4. Compound extraction and analysis:<br>
From each cassette, plasma samples at 1 and 2 h, blank plasma, blank plasma spiked with all the compounds at 0.5 &gt;t/M of each, are extracted by the solid phase extraction method. Samples were analyzed by HPLC and HPLC/MS for comparison purpose. Plasma concentrations are estimated based on the single concentration of 0.5 µM standard.<br>
