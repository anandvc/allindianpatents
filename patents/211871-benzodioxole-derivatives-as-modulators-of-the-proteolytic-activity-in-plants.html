BENZODIOXOLE DERIVATIVES AS MODULATORS OF THE PROTEOLYTIC<br>
ACTIVITY IN PLANTS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to the use of benzodioxole derivatives to modify enzyme<br>
activity in plants.<br>
State of the art<br>
Ptperonyi butoxide is a benzodioxole polyoxyethytene known for some time as a<br>
synergist of insecticides such as for example of pyrethrins, pyretfirotds and<br>
carbamate types insecticides.<br>
Its relatively low toxicity with regard to humans and animals and its appreciable<br>
effects on a large spectrum of insecticides has allowed its use to spread rapidly in<br>
agriculture.<br>
The mechanisms at the heart of this synergistic effect have not yet been clarified,<br>
even if from time to time direct or indirect regulation effects on some specific<br>
enzymes involved in the inactivation or in the cataboHsm of the insecticide<br>
molecules with which it synergises have been proposed, such as for example non<br>
specific esterases present in insect homogenates (Plperonyl Butoxide The<br>
insecticide   Synergist",   1998,  Academic  Press,   p-215),   more   recently  on<br>
microsomal oxidases     (Alzogaray RA Arch. Insect Biochem* Physiol, 2001,<br>
46:119*126), or on cytochrome P45Q mono oxygenases (Kotze et at. Int J.<br>
Parasitol, 1997,27:33-40). However, as yet, an effect of PBO on enzymes of plant<br>
origin has not been described, let alone In particular on the proteolytic or<br>
peptidase class of enzymes.<br>
The significance of the proteases and their physiological inhibitors as key<br>
enzymes in the regulation of cellular processes both in the animal and plant<br>
kingdoms is known and widely recognised*<br>
In plants, for example, the balance between proteolytic enzymes and natural<br>
inhibitors is at the heart of the precise temporal regulations of the germination<br>
process of dormant seeds.<br>
It is also known that over the course of evolution, the production of natural<br>
inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes has been selected in plants, among others, as a<br>
protection mechanism against parasites* The usefulness of interventions based on<br><br>
this type of approach is confirmed for exampie in Harsuikar A,M. et ah Plant Physiol, 1999,121:497-506. An approach based on the use of protease inhibitors expressed transgenically, is described in EP 502730 and in EP 339009: in the first the expression of the inhibitor is sufficient to determine a protective effect against nematodes, in the second, the transgenic expression erf a natural protease toh&amp;tor potentiates the insecticide effect of the product of the first gene encoding the Bt toxin (Bacillus thurfngiensis toxin). The same approach is described by &amp; Macintosh et ah in J. Agric Food Chem. 1990,38:1145-1152. It is therefore evident that the availability of a product endowed with regulatory activity of the activity of proteolytic enzymes of plant origin is of great industrial interest for a wide spectrum of applications. Summary of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is the use of benzodioxole derivatives of formula I, amongst which the preferred is piperonyl butoxide (PBO) as modulators of the activity or of the content of proteolytic enzymes in plants. Proteolytic enzymes able to hydrotyse peptide bonds, are preferably selected from the group consisting of: carboxypeptidases, aminopeptidases, dipeptidases, endopeptidases.<br>
Treatment with benzodioxole derivatives is carried out on plants, preferably transgenic for a protein with insecticidic function, preferably belonging to the category of the Bacillus thufingiensis toxins {Bt-toxin)t belonging to the Cry group. Preferably such transgenic plants are cotton, maize, tomato, potato and soya, or even more preferably, cotton-According to a further aspect the invention extends to the use of compositions containing the benzodioxole derivatives as the active ingredients in combination with suitable emuisifiers and optionally with photoprotective compounds selected from the group consisting of. benzotriazoles, benzophenones and sterically hindered amines, as modulators of the activity or of the content of proteolytib enzymes in plants.<br>
According to a further aspect the invention extends to a process for regulating the proteolytic activity in plants, preferably transgenic, even more preferably cotton, maize, soya, tomato, potato comprising essentially the treatment of such plants<br><br>
with benzodioxole derivatives and with the compositions containing such compounds, in a way such that the final concentration of PBO is comprised of between 50 and 500 grams/hectare and is performed at the end of the vegetative cycle.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the use of benzodioxole derivatives comprised in the following general formula I:<br><br>
wherein Ri, R2 and R3 being the same or different are selected from the group consisting oft hydrogen; alky) QrCe; CH2OR4 where R4 is selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen, -(CH2CH20)n»R5, in which n is an integer from 1 to 4 and R5 is selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen, alkyl Ci-Ca, aryl non substituted or substituted by: alkyl C1-C4, halogen, cyano group <cn group carboxyalkyl re is hydrogen or alkyl ci-ga a>R8 group f where R7 and R^ being the same or different are: hydrogen or alkyl C1-C4 or together with the atom of nitrogen to which they are bound, representing a piperldinyl, pyrrolidine, morphoiine group; R5 Is in addition selected from the group consisting of: aralkyl C7-C© non substituted or substituted on the aromatic ring by substituents selected from the group consisting of: alkyl C1-C4, halogen, a cyano group, a -SO3H group, a carboxyalkyl group -COOR9, where R9 has the same meaning as Re arkl where, when R1, R2 and R3 are the same, they cannot be hydrogen, said use based on the surprising finding that the previuosfy defined compounds are endowed with the capacity to modulate the activity or the content of plant proteolytic enzymes.<br>
Preferably, in the above mentioned compounds, the substituents Ri, R2 and R3 being the same or different are selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen, alkyl CrC* CH2OR4 where R4 is selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen, •(CHsCHiDVRB. in which n is an integer from 1 to 2 and R5 is selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen, alkyl CVC4, benzyl, aryl non substituted or<br><br>
substituted by: alkyl CrGa, and where, when R1f R2 and R3 are the same, they can never be hydrogen.<br>
Still more preferably in such compounds of formula I, the substituents R1# R2 and R3 being the same or different, are selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen, propyl, CH*OR4 where R4 Is -(CH2CH20)rRs arid R5 is selected from the group consisting of: alkyl CrC*. phenyl, toluyl and where, when R*, R2 and R3 are the same, they can never be hydrogen* Still more preferably such compounds correspond to piperonyl-butoxide (PBO) or 5^2^2-Butoxyethoxy)ethoxy]meth^ 6-propyM ,3-benzodioxole, of formula (II):<br><br>
For simplicity we will make reference in the following text, only to the compound piperonyl-butoxide. known by the abbreviation PBO or the term "benzodtoxole derivatives", being understood that with this abbreviation and with this term is intended to refer in the present application, to all the compounds of general formula I, comprising the preferred substituents.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention the terms proteases, proteinases or peptidases are used in an equivalent manner and are intended to refer to the peptidlc hydrolases, denominated for simplicity proteolytic enzymes or proteases over the course of the present description, le. to enzymes with hydrolytic activity towards peptide or amldic bonds independently of their position, therefore either when they are internal to the polypeptide chain, or at the N- or C- terminal ends. According to this definition therefore, both endopeptidases type enzymes, and exopeptidases, such as the aminopeptidases or carboxypeptidases which hydrotyse the peptide bonds liberating single amino acids sequentially from the N-or O terminal ends are comprised within the defmiton of proteolytic enzymes: The proteolytic enzymes on which PBO exherts its regulatory activity, are preferably selected from the group consisting of: carboxypeptidases, aminopeptidases, dipeptidases, endopeptidases, wherein the endopeptidases are preferably selected from the group consisting   of: serine proteases, cystein<br><br>
proteases, cathepsins, metallo-endopeptidases; the cystein proteases are preferably selected from the group consisting of: bromelain, calpain, ficin, papain, chymopapain.<br>
The regulation of proteolytic activity in plants, for example through the activation of specific inhibitors has a predominantly defensive role in comparison to the proteases of insects and pathogenic micro-organisms. In the case of tenons produced by mechanical or biological means, protease inhibitors are synthesfeed de novo contributing to the defence strategy of the plant The modulatory potential of the inhibitors on the endogenous proteases could be modest in seeds and tends to disappear during germination; an important role has been attributed to the inhibitors during seed maturation to prevent protein degradation during the accumulation phase. Therefore according to further object the invention comprises as a further embodiment the PBO proteolytic modulation activity on seeds; according to a further embodiment PBO is also useful to determine the activation of plant's defensive pathways in the case of wounds or lesions allowing the regulation of general tissue growth.<br>
A further advantage of the novel activity on plant cell proteolytic activity herein described is the regulation of the production, of the maturation or of the degradation, or in other words of the turn-over of endogenous proteinaceous substances, for example those with natural insecticide or fungicide functions or with tissue repair functions. This mechanism may help in potentiating the natural response of the plant cell towards possible parasitic aggression, or towards externally derived stresses.<br>
An example of substances endowed with fungicide activity, is described in Leah et al. J. Biol. Chem.,1991, 266:1564-1573 and is non extensively enlisted herein: Ribosome Inactivating Proteins (RIP), which have specificity for only distantly correlated ribosomes, such as fungi, but not for plant ribosornes, or the chitinases and the (1-3) -p-glucanases» which interfere with the synthesis of the cell walls of the fungus. Other substances produced by the plant in the form of inactive protein precursors, and having defensive functions against bacteria and fungi in their mature forms, are thionines, described'for example in Bohlmann H. Critical Reviews In Plant Sciences, 1994,13:1-16.<br><br>
Treatment with PBO according to the novel use herein described is carried out as known to the skilled man on all plant types, concentrating on the air exposed areas of the plant, and in particular on the leaves. The treatment can also be performed on seeds* In its preferred embodiment the treatment Is preferably carried out on transgenic plants selected from the group consisting of: cotton, maize, potato, tomato and soya. According to this preferred embedment, &amp;e invention refers to the use of benzodioxole derivatives as modulators of the proteolytic activity in plants transgenic for the insertion of a transgene encoding a protein.<br>
The plant proteolytic activity variation obtained after treatment with PBO, has a differential effect depending on the system considered as &amp; may aftras to increase or even to reduce the availability of a protein, or of a protein in its active conformation. It is known that a steady state level is the result of the rate of protein degradation and production. However proteolysis is also known as a mechanism for protein activation. As a result, the new use allows an increase in the natural or induced defences of the plant towards parasitic infection or external attacks. Accordingly, a further and preferred embodiment of the invention is the regulation of transgenicalty expressed protein levels through the modulation of the proteolytic activity within a plant ceil. Particularly preferred are plants transgenic for one of the Bacillus thuringiensis toxins.<br>
In particular, in the case of plants transgenic for the Bacillus thuringiensis Bt toxin gene, the possibility of controlling the mechanism of proteolysis is extremely important both to control the activity of the transgenic toxin or to regulate its production*<br>
It is however to be noted that this preferred embodiment of the invention is not limited to a single production or activation mechanism on the transgenic protein, but extends to all the mechanisms activated by PBO through a direct or indirect effect (such as through protease inhibitors) on proteolytic enzymes. An increase in the levels of proteolytic enzymes can be monitored by direct or indirect assays* Among the indirect assays the activity of proteases on various endogenous or exogenous substrates can be measured according to methods well known in the art.<br><br>
In the case of transgenic plants, the transgene encodes one of the Cry protein of Bacillus thuringiensis and even more preferably for a protein selected from the group consisting of: Cryl, Cry ft, Cry ill, Cry IVf in particular CrylA (a), (b) or (c). According to a particularly preferred embodiment the plant is cotton and the transgene encodes for the Cryl toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis. The authors of the present invention have addittonaHy observed foai in cotton transgenic for the Bt Cryl protein, the amount of transgenic toxin afler PBO treatment is higher than in transgenic untreated plants and this finding correlates with a loss in proteolytic activity in PBOtreated plants versus untreated, during a period of at least 100 days.<br>
Hence the use of benzodioxole derivatives of formula I as proteolytic modulators is particularly advantageous in transgenic plants, preferably selected from the group consisting of: cotton, maize, tomato, potato or soya preferably when they are transgenic for BMoxin, still more preferably for the Cry I toxin, for inhibiting the proteolytic mechanisms directly or indirectly modifying the expression of the transgenic (i.e. inactivating or reducing) Bt toxin in the plant ceB. Particularly preferred is the PBO treatment of cotton transgenic for one of the Bacillus thuringiensis toxins.<br>
The levels of Bt toxin in plants are measured as known In the field, for example with immunoenzymatic assays carried out with antibodies specific for the Bt toxin. Alternatively, quantities of Bt toxin less than the useful limits can be estimated by directly measuring the lack of mortality in the parasitic insects in the field or in the laboratory*<br>
According to an additional embodiment, the invention provides a process to regulate the proteolytic activity in plants, preferably to inhibit at least partially the proteolytic activity of a plant, comprising essentially the treatment of the plants with PBO or its derivatives or with the compositions comprising PBO as the active ingredient, in a way such that the concentration of the active ingredient is comprised from 50 to 800 grams/hectare, more preferably from 100 to 400 grams/hectare, even more preferably from 200 to 350 grams/hectare. The process according to the invention is preferably repeated up to three times per vegetative cycle and even more preferably is carried out at the end of the vegetative cycle.<br><br>
This preferred aspect is of particular relevance when the plant is transgenic and In particular when such plant preferably cotton, maize, tomato, potato and soya, is transgenic for the Cry toxin of Bacillus thuringiensls. As a matter of fact the modulatory activity of PBO is observed few hours after the treatment up to few days, during different phases of the plant growth cycle.<br>
The modulation of protease activity by PBO in plants is preferably a negative modulation, through a direct inhibition of PBO on the enzyme, or through an indirect effect such as, for example, through the activation of protease inhibitors or the de novo synthesis of specific protease inhibitors.<br>
Treatment with PBO is conveniently carried out using compositions with appropriate excipients or emulsifies. Therefore according to a further aspect the invention relates to the use of compositions containing the benzodtoxole derivatives of formula I as the active ingredient, or the preferred embodiments thereof, such as.PBO, In combination, with appropriate emulsffiers or excipients and optionally with photoprotector compounds, as modulators of the activity or the content of proteolytic enzymes in plants. The emulsifiers used are selected from the group consisting of: calcium salts of alkylarylsulphonic acids, polyglycol esters of fatty acids, alkylarylpolyglycol ethers, polyglycol ethers of fatty alcohols, ethylene oxide-propylene oxide condensation products, atkyl pofyethers, sorbitanic fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylensorbitanic fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitanic esters. Particularly preferred are the emulsifiers selected from the group consisting of: alkylarylpolyglycol ethers and calcium salts of alkytaryteutfonic add. The emulsifiers are present at a minimum concentration of 2% (w/w). The concentration of PBO in the compositions with emulsifiers or excipients is comprised from 1 to 98% (w/w), preferably from 20 to 95%, even more preferably from 50 to 90%.<br>
For the purposes herein the mixture of active ingredients in combination with the appropriate excipients or emulsifiers is denominated "concentrate". To the concentrate is optionally added a protective agent against photo oxidation (photoprotectors) selected from the class of compounds consisting of: benzotriazoles, benzophenones, and stencally hindered amines, in concentrations<br><br>
comprised from 0,1% to 10%, preferably from 0:5% to 8%, even more preferably.<br>
from 1 % to 5% in weight of the concentrate.<br>
Amongst benzotriazoles, compounds are selected from the group consisting of: 2-<br>

The invention will be now better detailed in the following experimental examples, which do not represent any limitation thereof. EXPERIMENTAL PART<br>
Example 1. In vitro inhibition of cvsteinte endopeotidases bv Diperonvl butoxkte The assays were carried out in the reverse-micelles assay dispersed in organic solvent, describe^ by Walde et al. In Eur. J, BiochemM 1988, 173:401-409, and already reported in the literature in kinetic studies of the inhibition of trypsin with natural and synthetic inhibitors* Such an assay was adapted to the following purified plant enzymes; papain, ficin and bromelain (Sigma catalogue N°: P4762, F4125, B5144 respectively) in the presence of substrate CBZ (L lysfne-p-nitrophenyl ester, Sigma catalogue N° C3637), and carried out respectively with Wo (molar ratio water/surfactant or HaO/AOT)= 23,25,28. The enzyme assay on reverse-micelle has been already described in the literature for the enzyme trypsin and was adapted to different enzymes* These values were obtained by vigorously mixing, in a quartz spectrophotometry cell, 1 ml of 50 mM AOT-ISO with, appropriate volumes of protease and different buffer solutions, respectively MES (2^[NwhoipholinoJethanesuffonic acid) for the enzyme papain, HEPES (N-P-HydroxyethyiJpiperazine-N'-pHBthanesulfonic add]) for the enzyme ficin and acetate for the enzyme bromelain. When the solution was completely transparent and apparently homogeneous, it was adjusted thermostatically to 30°C, To this solution was added an appropriate volume of substrate CBZ (dissolved in acetonitrile/H20, 80:20 (v/v) at a concentration of 15 mM) and following further agitation (the solution returned to being transparent), the change in absorbance was measured (Aabs) at 340 nm with a Gary 219 spectrophotometer* The assay conditions in summary, were the following: Papain:<br>

The experimental data obtained are represented graphically in the form of Dixon-plot (described for example in: 'Quantitative Problems in Biochemistry", E A. Dawes, 5th ed. 1972 Baltimore, The Williams and Wilkins Company), in the figures 1,2 and 3. Such a graphical representation allows the calculation of the Kt values (inhibition constant) obtained for PBO respectively on papain: 2.6x10*3 M, on ficin: 4.5x10"* M and on bromelain: 1x10"4 M, therefore indicating that the inhibitory effect of PBO is higher on bromelain. The test results, obtained at non saturating<br><br>
substrate concentrations, indicate that, under these conditions, PBO inhibits all<br>
the proteases tested. In particular from the Dixon plots presented in figures 1-3 it<br>
is possible to evaluate the IC50.of PBO which on the papain system is equal to<br>
2x1 (T3 Mt on the enzyme ficin ft is equal to 0.8x1 O^M and on the enzyme<br>
bromelain Is equal to 0.4x10"^.<br>
Example 2, Inhibition of bromelain bv PBO.<br>
The assay was carried out as described in Heinrikson &amp; Kezdy, 1976, Methods in<br>
Enzymot 45, p. 740. The conditions are summarised briefly herein: SOpg of<br>
bromelain was mixed with variable quantities of Na CBZ-Utysine p-nitrophenyi<br>
ester substrate in 3 ml of 10 mM acetate buffer pH 4,6 containing KO! (0,1 M) and<br>
L-cystein (1 mM). The changes in the initial velocities erf the reaction were<br>
measured by the changes in absorbance at 340 nm/rninf in the presence erf a 1%<br>
solution of PBO in H2O In two different experiments.<br>
The results are presented in table 1.<br>
Table 1. The effect of 1 % PBO on the activity of bromelain*<br>
the data indicate that 1% PBO has an inhibitory effect on bromelain which for substrate concentrations comprised of between 20*24 (iM and 48-50 (iM, is variable from 65 to 60%<br>
The experiment was repeated using increasing concentrations of PBO and a fixed substrate concentration (240 pM). The data are reported in table 2.<br><br>
Table 2. Effect of increasing quantities of PBO on the activity of the enzyme bromelain<br><br>
higher than 0.5% has an inhibitory activity of the proteolytic enzyme bromelain.<br>
This effect is concentration dependent. The degree of the inhibition is in<br>
agreement with the data obtained in the previous examples.<br>
Example 3. Effect of PBO on carboxvoeptldase and endopepttdase in cotton<br>
seedlings.<br>
With the aim to evaluate the effect of PBO on the endogenous plant enzymatic<br>
system in cotton in vitro assays were carried out using acetonic powders got from<br>
treated (PBO) and untreated freeze dried seed sprouts, without the addition of any<br>
specific exogenous substrate. The basic idea was to "freeze* the physiologic<br>
protein hydrolysis    enzymatic activity and to re-establish the process simply<br>
solubillzing the proteolytic enzymatic system in suitable buffers, which were 0.1 M<br>
phosphate pH  6.5  and  0.1   M trls-HCI pH 7.7,  for evaluating  both  the<br>
carboxypeptidase and the endopeptidase activities according to the method<br>
described by Hiie et al. 1972; Funkhouser et ah 1980.<br>
Materials and methods<br>
Cotton seeds (cv. Carmela) were obtained from "Semites Battle", Barcelona (E).<br>
Germination conditions<br><br>
The seeds were previously rinsed in tap water and then imbibed with aeration in distilled water over night (Funkhouser, EA et al.» Z. Pftanzenphysiol., 1980, 100, 319-324).<br>
After this process, seeds were planted In settled and sterile sand and then watered with distilled water (untreated seeds) and with tie same volume of a micro-suspension of saturated PBO (1% w/v) (treated seeds). The plastic bows containing seeds were covered by a plastic film and placed in a germinator In the dark for 4 days at 30°C as described in Hile, J.N. and Dure, L.S. J. Biol Chem., 1972,247; 5034-5040. Freeze drying<br>
The cotton sprouts of 4 days were collected and frozen in Squid nitrogen and freeze dried (Hile et al. 1972). After this process, the material was crushed in a pestle and freed from fibrous material and settled up to obtain a pretty homogeneous meal of about 0,5 mesh. Acetonh powders preparation<br>
The meals were defatted using n-hexane (1:10 w/v) at room temperature and then treated with acetone at -20°C to remove pigments and pofyphenolic compounds, in this case mainly gossypol. The powders obtained were stored in a diy box at room temperature. Carboxypeptidase assay<br>
The acetonic powder (30 mg) was suspended in buffer (4 ml) and incubated at 37°C for 30,60,90,120 minutes. The proteolysis was stopped adding 1 ml of 12% trichloroacetic acid. In this case, the buffer used was 0.1 M phosphate pH 6.5 (Hile et al. 1972). The control was a suspension of the same sample prepared in the same way but, in this case, it was immediately deactivated, adding 1 ml erf trichloroacetic acid. The trials with treated and untreated samples were carried out at the same time. Photometric analysis<br>
Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then removed by filtration, before with Whatman paper n. 4 and then by micro-filtration (Orange Scientific Braine I'Alleud, Belgium (0 0.2 pm)). Finally, the hydrolyzed protein samples were<br><br>
analyzed as clear solutions by determining the.absorbance at 280 nm in a quartz<br>
cuvette.<br>
Each series of analysis was performed twice. The comparison between the values<br>
of carboxypeptidase activity of treated and untreated samples was done using the<br>
average value of each series of analysis.<br>
From the data shown in Rg. 4 it may be inferred that the proteolyic ac&amp;iy rebtoti<br>
to carboxypeptidase in treated samples is lower than in the untreated ones.<br>
In Table 3 the percentage of these differences is also reported.<br>
Table 3 - Carboxypeptidase activity of treated and untreated cotton sprouts at the 4* day of germination,<br><br>
Endopeptidase assay<br>
The acetonic powder (30 mg) was suspended in buffer (4 ml) and incubated at<br>
37°C for 15% 30, 60,90,120 minutes. The proteolysis was stopped adding 1 ml of<br>
12% trichloroacetic acid, in this case the buffer used was 0,1 M phosphate pH 7/7<br>
(Funkhouser et ai. 1980). The control was a suspension of the same sample<br>
prepared in the same way but was immediately deactivated, adding up 1 ml of<br>
trichloroacetic acid. The trials with treated and untreated samples were carried out<br>
at the same time.<br>
Photometric analysis<br>
Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then removed by filtration,<br>
before with Whatman paper n. 4 and then by micro-filtration (Orange Scientific<br><br>
Braine I'Alleud, Belgium {0 0.2 Jim)). Finally, the hydrolyzed protein samples were analyzed as clear solutions by determlnfng the absorbance at 280 nrn in a quartz cuvette.<br>
Each series of analysis was performed threefold. The comparison between the values of endopeptidase activity of treated and untreated samples was done using the average value of each series of analysis. As it is possible to see in Fig. 5,*o the endopeptidase activity in PBO treated cotton sprouts is lower than in foe untreated ones. In Table 4 the percentage of these differences is also reported<br><br><br><br>
Example 4. Effect of PBO on Bt-toxin content in transgenic cotton plant samples.<br>
With the aim to find the correlation between Bt toxin levels and the effect erf the<br>
PBO treatment on cotton plants, the Bt toxin concentration was measured in Bt<br>
transgenic cotton plant samples (cv.SicalaV2i) treated with PBO or untreated (the<br>
control).<br>
The assay was carried out on samples collected at different plant development<br>
stages, which were: 4t 35,60,85 days after sowing.<br>
Materials and methods.<br>
In order to determine the Bt toxin concentration in PBO treated or untreated cotton<br>
samples, a specific ELISA assay was used. The ELISA Cry1Ah/Cry1Ac Plate Kit<br>
was obtained from Envirotogix (Portland, Maine -USA), The assay was performed<br>
according to the Envirologix protocol with the following modifications:<br>
1 The cotton freeze-dried powder got from leaf or cotyledon tissues was used<br>
instead of the fresh and whole leaf tissue. 2; The Bt toxin extraction from the cotton freeze-dried powder was done wRh a<br>
sample/buffer ratio of 1:25 (w/v). 3. The extraction was made leaving the sample in the buffer for at least 4 hours<br>
at room temperature, instead of using the Envirologix Disposable Tissue<br>
Extractor, The extract was then clarified by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 5 min<br>
at room temperature. Figure 6a shows the Bt concentrations in PBO treated or untreated cotton plant samples at the plant development stages reported above. In figure 6 and in table 5 Is also shown that there is a significant .lower Bt content in PBO~treated samples at 35, 60f 85 days after planting, whereas no difference was found at 4 days. Figure 6b shows the difference in percentage between PBO-treated and untreated cotton plant samples* In table 5 are summarized the results obtained with the described assay.<br><br>
Table 5. Bt content and differences between PBO treated with and untreated samples in transgenic cotton<br><br>
Example 5. Effect of PBO treatment on protease (endoprotease) activity in cotton plants at different growing stages*<br>
With the aim to evaluate the action of PBO on the proteolytic activity in cotton plants, the enzymatic activity was tested on samples of PBO treated and untreated cotton leaves (as control). The samples were collected at different development stages of plants, which were: 4, .35, 60 and 85 days after sowing. These samples were also analysed for determining the Bt content (as described in example 4). To this aim, the enzymatic activity was tested on crude freeze dried leaf extracts with two different assays: the Radial Diffusion Assay (RDA), in which a protein, such as the bovine gelatine,, was used as a substrate to test the endopeptidase activity, and a photometric assay described In the next example, in which DL-BAPA was used as a substrate, to determine a general peptidase activity.<br>
Materials and Methods Plant culture<br>
Cotton seeds of the cv. Sicala V2i were previously rinsed in distilled water and then placed in equal number in suitable plastic boxes containing settled and sterile sand. Seeds were watered with equal volumes of distilled water and the culture boxes were then covered with a plastic film to avoid evaporation during germination, which was carried out in the dark for 4 days at 30*C: The seeds to<br><br>
be analysed after 4 days of germination were watered with distilled water or with<br>
an equal volume of a micro-suspension saturated of PBO (2% w/v). After 4 days,<br>
these sprouts were collected for testing, whereas the other sprouts were moved in<br>
suitable pots and located in the greenhouse at 24°C during the day and 20°C m<br>
the night<br>
Tr&amp;atments<br>
At fixed times of 4t 35, 60,85 days after sowing, 10 plants faWy homogeneous for<br>
height were treated with a commercial PBO formulation (Endura) 2% (ntfv).<br>
Treatments were given out vaporizing the diluted formulation on the plants taking<br>
care to treat both leaves sides.<br>
Freeze drying<br>
Two days after each treatment, a sample of the treated plants, and the<br>
correspondent controls, were collected and all leaves were frozen in liquid<br>
nitrogen and freeze dried. After this process, the material was powdered in a<br>
pestle and then stored in a dry box at room temperature.<br>
Extract preparation<br>
A powder aliquot, which represents each step of plant growth, of the treated and<br>
controls samples was extracted in two steps. The powder sample was extracted<br>
with buffer 0.1 M Tris-HCI pH 77 (1:20 w/v) using an Ultraturrax blender at 24,000<br>
x RPM for 2 min in a ice bath to avoid overheating. The extract was then clarified<br>
by centrifugation at 5,000 x g at 10°C, for 20 min. The clear supernatant was<br>
collected and filtrated with Whatman paper n°4. The pellet was further extracted<br>
with the same procedure, with the exception that in this case the extraction ratio<br>
was 1:10 (w/v). Finally, the supematants of the two extractions processes were<br>
joined and then concentrated 4-5 times by centrjftjgation at 3,000 x g at 15*C for 2<br>
hours, using suitable concentrators (Amicon Inc. Beverly, MA - USA), fitted with a<br>
membrane of 10 KD cut off.<br>
Protein concentration<br>
For each extract, the amount of soluble proteins was determined by the Biuret<br>
method and the enzymatic activity was then expressed as specific activity i.e.<br>
Unfts/mg soluble proteins.<br><br>
RDA was performed as described in Santarius, K, and Ryan, C.f Anal. Biochern,,<br>
1977,77:1-9 in Petri dishes containing bovine gelatine as substrate, dispersed in<br>
agar gel. Each dish contained 5 wells of which 4 were filled with suitable aliquots<br>
of concentrated cotton extracts, whereas one was filled with a bovine ^-trypsin as<br>
standard solution (0.2 U/ml). The dishes were covered and seated with a ptesfc<br>
film to avoid evaporation and then incubated at 37°C for 16 hours.<br>
The enzymatic activity in the protein-agar gel produced a ctear radial diffusion<br>
zone around each circular wells, due to the bovine gelatine proteolysis against an<br>
opaque background.<br>
The trypsin equivalents were calculated by measuring the radii of the clear zones<br>
produced by the plant extracts and compared to a standard curve obtained by a<br>
serial dilution of trypsin. Each dish contained a standard solution of trypsin that<br>
was used to plot a standard curve for each plate, thus the endopeptidase activity<br>
was expressed as units of trypsin equivalents.<br>
Each analysis was performed in quadruplicate. Figure 7 shows the values of<br>
endopeptidase activity obtained with RDA of the treated and untreated cotton<br>
samples. This experiment points out that the commercial PBO formulation<br>
(Endura), especially at 35, 60, 85 days after sowing, significantly inhibited the<br>
endopeptidase activity in cotton leaves of Slcala V2i genotype. In table 6 are<br>
shown the differences between treated and untreated  cotton samples as<br>
percentages*<br>
Table 6. Endopeptidase activity of PBO treated and untreated samples by the<br><br><br>
The photometric assay was carried out as. described in .Erianger, B*F, et al. Arch. BiochernM 1961, 95:271-278, In the assay is measured the absorbance variation due to DL-BAPA hydrolysis at 410 nm. The assay was performed mixing directly in the cuvette 20 jU of cotton crude extract with 980 |xJ of DL-BAPA in buffer 0.1 M Trfe-HCI pH 8*2, One peptidase unit was defined as the amount of the enzyme which produces one unit of absorbance variation (410 nm) per minute at pH &amp;2 and 30°a<br>
Each series of analysis was performed in duplicate or triplicate. Figure 8 reports the values of peptidase activity in PBO treated and untreated cotton samples calculated as U/mg of soluble protein. In this figure is shown a maximum of peptidase activity around 60 days of development. At this time foe treatment with commercial PBO formulation (Endura) shows a maximum significant inhibition of the proteolytic activity on the Sfcala V2i cotton. Differences in the proteolytic activity are observed throughout the plant growing cycle by tWs assay in PBO treated vs untreated cotton plants* A statistically significant inhibition is observed during the most part of the plant growing cycle. Finally, in table 7 is shown the specific activities of peptidase of treated and untreated Sicala V2i cotton samples. In this table it is also reported the activity differences in percentage between the treated and untreated samples*<br>
