The present invnetion relates to a homogeneous coating composition, a<br>
process for making the coating and a coated article.<br>
Background<br>
[0002]       References relating to ultraviolet absorbers ("UVAs") in photopolymerizable coatings include U.S. Patent Nos. 5,318,850 (Pickett et al.), 5,559,163 (Dawson et al.), 5,977,219 (Ravichandran et al. '219), 6,187,845 (Renz et al.) and 6,262,151 (Ravichandran et al. M51), and published PCT Application No. WO 98/34981 (Eastman Chemical Company). U.S. Patent No. 5,294,473 (Kawamoto) describes polyethylene 2,6-dinaphthalate ("PEN") photographic supports that can contain UVAs.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
10003]       When exposed to sufficiently intense or sufficiently lengthy outdoor weather conditions, polymeric coatings eventually fail. UVAs can be added to a coating composition prior to polymerization in order to extend the life of the polymerized coating or to protect an underlying material. However, the presence of the UVA can compromise polymerization when ultraviolet light ("UV") curing is employed. Also, many UVAs have only limited solubility in photopolymerizable coating compositions unless solvents are also employed. Solventless coating compositions are desirable for a variety of reasons including possible environmental damage and increased material costs that may accompany solvent use, and the greater time and possible fire or explosion hazards that may accompany solvent drying. UVAs may also "bloom" (become apparent at the surface) in a cured coating if solvents have been employed to attain high UVA loading levels.<br>
[0004]        We have found that large amounts of benzotriazole UVAs can be dissolved in polymerizable compositions containing a vinyl-functional crosslinkable film former and a copolymerizable monomer that solubilizes the benzotriazole. The resulting compositions need not employ solvents (although they may do so if desired) and can provide cured coatings having very good UV resistance, yet can avoid blooming even at very high benzotriazole loading levels.<br><br><br>
[0005]   The present inviton provides in one aspect a homogenous coating composition comprising:<br>
a)	at least one vinyl-fimctiODal crossliskable film foimer;<br>
b)	more than 15 weight percent benzotriazole UV absoiber, and<br>
c)	at least one copolymerizable mooomer that sohibilizes the benzotriazole. [0006]      In another aspect, the invention provides a process for making a UV resistant coating comprising<br><br>
a)	providing a support;<br>
b)	coating at least a portion of the support with a homogenous nodxture comprising (i) at least one vinyl-fimctional crosslinkable Ska foinaer; (ii) more than 15 weight percent benzotriazole UV absorber, and Oa) at least one copolymerizable monomer that solubilizes the benzotriazole; and<br>
c)	polymerizing the coating.<br>
[0007]       In a fUrther aspect, flae invention provides an article comprising a support overcoated with a UV resistant coating comprising the polymerized reaction product of a homogenous mixture coxnprising:<br>
a)	at least one vinyl-funtiohal crosslinkable film former,<br>
b)	more than IS weight percent benzotriazole UV absorber, and<br>
c)	at least one copolymerizable monomer that solubilizes the benzotriazole. [0008]       These and other aspects of the inveittion will be s^parent fitom the detailed description below.<br>

[0012]       Fig. 4 is a schematic perspective view of a stack of two polymeric layers forming an interface.<br><br><br>
[0013]        Like reference symbols in the various figures of the drawing indicate Hke elements. The elements in the drawing are not to scale.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
[0014]        By using the term "homogenous" with respect to a composition or mixture we<br>
refer to a liquid that on visual inspection appears to have a single phase free of precipitates<br>
or undissolved solids. A homogenous composition or mixture may be found on more<br>
detailed inspection to be a suspension, dispersion, emulsion or other microscopically<br>
multiphase form.<br>
[0015]       By using the term "polymer" we refer to homopolymers and copolymers, as<br>
well as to homopolymers or copolymers that may be formed in a miscible blend, e.g., by<br>
coextrusion or by reaction, including, e.g., transesterification. The term "copolymer"<br>
includes alternating, random and block copolymers.<br>
[0016]       By using the term "coating thickness" we refer unless otherwise specified to<br>
the thickness of a coating after it has been polymerized or otherwise cured.<br>
[0017]       By using the term "film former" we refer to a material that can be coated in a<br>
thin layer (e.g., of about 0.05 mm before polymerization) on a suitable support and<br>
polymerized to form a substantially continuous coating.<br>
[0018]       By using the term "vinyl-functional" with respect to a crosslinkable film<br>
fonner, we refer to a material having vinyl (-CH=CH2) groups that through the action of<br>
heat, light, electron beam or other activating energy (and if need be in the presence of a<br>
suitable initiator) can form a substantially continuous coating of crosslinked polymer. The<br>
crosslinked state is generally characterized by solvent insolubility, but may be<br>
characterized by swellability in the presence of an appropriate solvent.<br>
[0019]       By using the term "copolymerizable" with respect to a monomer we refer to a<br>
monomer that can be polymerized with a vinyl-functional crosslinkable film fonner to<br>
form a substantially continuous coating of crosslinked polymer.<br>
[0020[       By using the term "blooming" we refer to the formation of a visible deposit or<br>
nonunifonn discoloration at the surface of a cured polymer coating.<br>
[0021]       By using the term "solubilizes" with respect to liquids, we refer to dissolution<br>
of a solid into a liquid to form a homogeneous mixture. By using the term "solubilizes"<br>
with respect to cured coatings made from liquid monomers, we refer to the dissolution of a<br><br>
solid into the liquid monomers to form a homogeneous mixture, and to the retention of the<br>
solid in the cured coating without blooming, internal haze, or other visible signs of phase<br>
separation.<br>
[0022]       By using the term "visible light-transmissive" with respect to an article or<br>
element thereof, we mean that the article or element has an average transmission over the<br>
visible portion of the spectrum, Tvis of at least about 20%, measured along the normal<br>
axis.<br>
[0023]       By using the term "optically clear" with respect to an article or element thereof<br>
we refer to an absence of visibly noticeable distortion, haze or flaws as detected by the<br>
naked eye at a distance of about 1 meter, preferably about 0.5 meters.<br>
[0024]       By using words of orientation such as "atop", "on", "uppermost" and the like<br>
for the location of various elements in an article of the invention, we refer to the relative<br>
position of the element with respect to a horizontal support or reference plane. We do not<br>
intend that such elements or articles should have any particular orientation in space during<br>
or after their manufacture.<br>
[0025]       By using the term "overcoated" to describe the position of a layer with respect<br>
to a support or other element (e.g., an underlying layer) in an article of the invention, we<br>
refer to the recited layer as being atop the support or other element, but not necessarily<br>
contiguous to the support or other element. By using the term "separated by" to describe<br>
the position of a first element with respect to two other elements, we refer to the first<br>
element as being between the other elements but not necessarily contiguous to either other<br>
element.<br>
[0026]       By using the term "weathering" we refer to the effects of prolonged exposure<br>
to simulated or actual outdoor weather conditions including sun, rain, airborne<br>
contaminants and heat, or to simulated or actual indoor illumination conditions including<br>
high-intensity bulbs, indoor lighting and the like. For cured polymer coatings or<br>
polymeric substrates, common weathering failure modes include yellowing, cracking,<br>
peeling, delamination or haze.<br>
[0027]        Referring to Fig. 1, an article of the invention is shown generally at 10. Article<br>
10 includes support 12 made of plastic or other material subject to degradation when<br>
exposed to weathering. Support 12 is overcoated with primer layer 13 and UV resistant<br>
coating layer 14. Coating 14 contains a high percentage of a benzotriazole UV absorber<br><br>
(not shown in Fig. 1) that helps to protect support 12 from weattxering mchiding TJV. exposure.<br>
[0028]       Pig. 2 shows a fihn article of the inveotioa 20 hay Lag flepdble film sappoit 22 overcoated on its upper and lower surfaces with primer layers 23,25 and UV resistant coating layers 24,26; Coating 26 is a hardcoat layer containing submicrdn inorganic particles 28 that help protect the lower surface of article 20 from damage or abrasion. [0029]      Fig. 3 shows a multilayer optical film article of flie invention 30 having flexible film support 32 trade from a large number (e.g 10, 100, 1000 or even more) of -thin layers such as'layers 34,38,42,46 and 50 of a first polymer and layers 36,40,44 and 48 ofa second polymer. Notall oftheselayers are shown in Fig. 3. The missing layers are indicated using an ellipsis. Outer skin layer 60 lies atop primer layer 58 and protects-the underlying layers in article 30 fiom damage.<br>
[0030]       Referring to Fig. 4, two adjacent layers 36 and 38 are shown in perspective view. Layer 36 (and other layers of the same second polymer such, as layers 40, 44 and 48, not shown in Fig. 4) have in-plane indices of refraction nix and nly in the x- and y-axis (in-plane) directions and index of refraction nlz in the z-axis (out-of-plane) direction. Layer 38 (and other layers of the same first polymer such as layers 34, 38, 42,46 and 50, not shown in Fig. 4) have in&gt;plane indices of refraction n2x and n2y in the x- and y-axis directions and index of refraction n2z in, the z-axis direction, hxcident light ray 75 will be refracted as it passes through layer 3^, reflected at iater&amp;ce 77, refracted as it passes once again.dirough layer 76 and then will exit layn 76 as reflected ray 79. The refiectacce characteristics of the multilayer optical film article will be determined by Qie respective indices of refraction for the layers within the support In particular, reflectivity AXdll depend upon the relationship between the indices of refraction of each layer material in the X, y, and z directions. A multilayer optical film article such as article 30 of Fig. 3 can. have especially useful optical properties when formed using at least one uniaxially birefringent polymeric material having two indices (typically along the x and y axes, or nx and ny) that are approximately equal, and different from the third index (typically along the z axis, or nz). Multilayer optical films in which all are optical layers are isotropic in their refractive index can also be used.<br>
[0031] A variety of supports can be employed in the invention. Representative supports include cellulosic polymer materials (e.g., cellulose triacetate or "TAC"); polyolefins such<br><br><br>
as low-density polyethylene C'LDPE*0, linear low-density polyethylene ("LLDPE"), high density poiyethylene ("HDPE"), polypropylene ("PP") and cyclic oleiip copolymer (e.g., metallocene-catalyzed cyclic olefin copolymers or "COCs"); acrylic polymers<br>
including acrylates and methacrylates<br>
such as polymethyl methacrylate ("PMMA"), ethylene ethyl acrylate ("EEA"). ethylene methyl acrylate ("EMA") and ethylene vinyl acrylate ("EVA"); Styrenic polymers such as polystyrene ("PS"), aciylonitrile-butadiene-styrene ("ABS"), styrene-acrylonitrile ("SAN"), styrcnc/malcic anhydride ("SMA") and poly a-methyl styrcne; polyamides such as nylon 6 ("PA6"); polyvinyl chloride CPVCOLpoIyoxvmethvlene ("POM"1. polyvinylnaphthalfcne ("PVN")i polyetheretherketone ('TEEK"), polyairyletherketone ("PAEK"), fluoTopoiymers (e.g., DYNEOK™ HTE tetpclymer of hexafluoropropylene, tetrafluoroetbylene, and ethylene), polycarbonates such as polycarbonate of bisphenol A ("PC"), polyarylate ("PAR"), polysulfone C'PSuI"), polyphenylcne oxide ("PPO"), polyetherimide ("PEI"), polyarylsulfone ("PAS"), poly ether sulfone ("PES"), polyamideimide ("PAl"), polyimide and polyphthalamide. A ftirther preferred class of supports includes polyesters, such as heat stabilized PET ("HSPET"), tcrephthlate polyesters<br>
and copolyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate ("PET"d terephth'al'ate copolyestors<br>
("coPETs") naphthalate polyesters and copolyeaterS such as polyethylene naphthalate' ("PEN"), naphthalate copolyesters ("coPENs") and polybutylen? 2.6-naphaialate ("PEN"). A preferred coPEN employs carboxylate subunits derived fix)m 90 mol% dimethyl naphthalene'dicarboxylate and 10 mol% dimethyl terephthalate and glycol subunits derived from 100 mol% ethylene glycol subimits to provide a polymer having an intrinsic viscosity (IV)iof 0.48 dL/g and an index of refraction is approximately 1.63. [0032]       For applications where optica] performance is important, the cured coating preferably has a visible light transmission of at least 70% at 550 nm, and more preferably at least 80%. The support can if desired be uni-directiorially oriented, biaxially oriented or heat-stabilized, using heat setting, annealing under tension or other techniques that will discourage shrinkage up to at least the heat stabilization temperature when the support is not constrained. The support can have any desired thickness. For applications involving flexible film supports that are made or coated using roll-to-roll processing equipment, the support preferably has a thickness of 0.005 to mm, more preferably 0.025 to 0.25 mm. If skin layers and other optional non-optical layers are employed in multilayer optical films containing first and second polymer<br><br>
layers, the skin layer and non-optical layers can be thicker than, thinner than or the same thickness as the first and second polymer layers. The thickness of the skin layers and non-optical layers is generally at least four tizse^, typically at least 10 times, and can be at least 100 times, the thickness of at least one of the individual first and second polymer layers. [0033]       A variety of vinyl-fimctional cTosslinkable film fonners (sometimes referred to below as "film formers") can be employed in the invention. Representative film formers typically will be monomers or oligomers having di- or higher vinyl fimctionality such as alkyl di-, tri-, tetra- and bigher-fiujctionnl aciylates and methacrylates, and monomers and oligomers having allyllic, fiunaric or crotonic unsaturation.

Hexanediol diacrylate, butanediol diacrylate, pentaerythrltol triacrylate ('TETA"), pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, tiimethylolpropane triacrylate ("TMPTA") and aliphatic or cycloaliphatic.urethane acrylate oligomers are especially preferred film formers. Use of film formers containing'urethane functionality can<br><br><br>
contribute to toughness in the cured coating. Use of Oligomeric film formers can reduce shrinkage, curl, and residual stress but may also compromise hardness. Mixtures of film formers can be employed. The composition should contaid 8u£Bcient fihn former to provide a cured coating having the desired thickness and durability. Preferably, llie composition contains  10 to 90 weight percent film former based on tlie total weight of solids in the composition. More preferably, the composition contains 20<br>
to 80 weight percent film former, and most preferably 25 to 60 weight percent film former.<br>
[0034]      A variety of benzotriazoles can be employed in the invention Representative benzotriazoles include those described in U.S. P'atent No. 3,004,896 (HeUer et al. 896), 3,055,896 (Boyle et al.), 3,072,585 (Milionis et al.), 3,074,910 (Dickson,. Jr.), 3,189,615 (Heller et al. 615), 3,230,194 Ooyle), 4,127,586 (Rody et al. '586), 4,226,763 (Dexter et al. '763), 4,275,004 (Winter et al. '004), 4,315,848 (Dexter et al.

Polymerizable benzotriazoles can be employed if desired. Most preferably the benzotriazole is substituted in the 5-position of the benzo ring by a thio ether, alkylsulfonyl or phenylsulfonyl moiety such as the benzotriazoles described in U.S. Pateni Nos. 5,278,314 (Winter et al. '314), 5,280,124 (Winter et al. '124). Winter et al. 349 and Winter et al. '914, or substituted in die 5-position of the benzo ring by an'electron withdrawing group such as tha benzotriazoles described in Ravichandran et aL '219. Further preferred benzotriazoles also include 2-(2-hydroxy-3,5-di-alpha-cumylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazoleCnNUVlK™ 234 or TINUVD^OO, both commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals), 5-chloro-2-(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylphcnyl)-2H-<br>
TM<br>
benzotriazole (TINUVIN   326, commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals), 5 chloro-2-(2-hydroxy-3.5 -di-tert-butylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole CnNUVIN™327, commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals), 2-(2rhydroxy-3,5-di-tert-amylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazolc (TINUVIN™328, commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals), 2-(2-hydroxy-3-alpha-cumyl-5-tert-octylphenyl)-2H-bcnzotriazole<br>
(TINUVNTM   928, commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals) and 5-<br><br>
trifluoromctliyl-2-(2-hydroxy-3-alpha-cumyl-5-tert-octylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazote 139, commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals). Mixtures of benzotriazoles can be employedTINUVIN   328. TINUVIN™928 and CQH39 are especially preferred benzotriazoles due to their high solubility in monomers such as isobomyl acrylate. Due to its relatively low cost, TINlJVTDSr™928 is an especially preferred choice for use on PET and HSPET supports. Due to its performance, CGL-139 is an especially prefeired choice for use on naphthalate polyester supports, which require special UV protection at certain wavelengths.<br>
[0035]       The coinposition contains more than IS weight percent of the benzotriazole. The benzotriazole upper amount limit will depend in part on the chosen benzotriazole, monomer and other ingredients in the composition. The upper amount limit generally corresponds to the level at which blooming, hazing or phase separation is observed. Blooming may not be observed until after cure and some aging has taken place. Heat or solvents (e.g., ethyl acetate, toluene, acetone or hexanes) can be used to facilitate quick dissolution of the benzotriazole in the coating composition. Preferably, the .composition contains 16 to 35 weight percent benzotriazole in the coating composition based on the total weight of solids in the composition. More preferably, the composition contains 20 to   35 weight percent benzotriazole, and most preferably   21 to 35 weight percent benzotriazole.<br>
[0036]       A variety of copolymerizible monomers that solubilize the UV absorber (sometimes referred to below as "solubilidng monomers'" can be employed in the invention. Usually the solubilizing mononier will be monofunctional, and when combined by itself with an appropriate UV photoinitiator and appropriately irradiated with UV light usually will cure or gel but will-not readily form a substantially continuous coating of crosslinked polymer. However, somfc bifimctional monomers (e.g., butahediol diacrylate) having a suitably low viscosity and suitable solubilizing power for a UV absorber may be employed in the invention as both a vinyl-functional crosslinkable film former and as a<br>
solubilizing monomer, thus providing a composition wherein the film former and monomer are<br>
the same species. In most instances however the vinyl-fimctional crosslinkable film former and the solubilizing monomer will be distinct chemical species. The solubilizing<br>
monomer should be able to solubilize a sufficient amount of the benzotriazole so that a<br>
composition of the. invention will form a homogenous mixture. Unlike a solvent, the<br>
solubilizing monomer will largely remain in the coating composition after application of<br><br><br>
the coating composition to the support and exposute to suitable drying conditions, and will largely be incorporated into the cured composition. Representative solubilizingmonomers includr monofimctional monomers such as isooctyl aciylate (e.g.. SR-440, commercially available from Saitomer Company, Tg = about -45 to -54° Q, 2-plhylhexyl acrylate (Tg -= about -50" C), cyclohcxyl aciylate (Tg " about 19" C), t-butyl acrylate (Tg - about 41C). n-octyldecyl acrylate (Tg ■ about 42" C), glycidyl methacrylate (e.g., SR-379, commercially available from Sartomer Company, Tg » about 41-74" C), 1,4-butanediol diacrylate (e.g., SR-213), benzyl methaoylate (Tg = about 54" C), isobomyl acrylate (e.g.. SR-S06, commercially available from Sartomer Company, Tg = about 88-94° C), isobomyl methacrylate (e.g., SR-423, commercially available from Sartomer Company, Tg - about 110C), t-butylcyclohexyl acrylate, 1-adamantyl acrylate, dicyclopentenyl acrylate and n-vinyl caprolactam. Higher Tg solubilizing monomers are preferred where harder cured coatings are desired. Acrylates are preferred over methacrylates where rapid reactivity is desired. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that lower Tg solubilizing monomers may be preferred where softer cured coatings are desired and that methaciylates may be preferred where slower reactivity is desired. Isobomyl acrylate and t-butylcyclohexyl acrylate are especially preferred solubilizing monomers. Mixtures ofsolubilizing monomers can be employed. The composition should contain sufficient solubilizing monomer to solubilize the benzottiazole in the composition and form a homogenous mixture that does not exhibit blooming ait6r cure. Preferably, the composition contains 5 to   95 weight percent solubihzing monomer based on the total weight of solids in the composition. More preferably, the composition contains 10 to  80 weight percent solubilizing monomer, and most preferably 15 to 60-weight percent solubilizing monomer.<br>
[0037J       Preferably the compositions of the invention are photopolymerizable. When a photoinitiator is not employed, then a curing technique such as e-beam irradiation can be used to effect photocuring. More preferably the compositions contain a photoinitiator, e.g., a UV photoinitiator or a photoinitiator that can be activated by UV or visible light ("UV/V is" photoinitiator), and will be light polymerizable. A variety of photoinitiators can be employed to facilitate pbotopolymerization. Care should be taken in selection of the photoinitiator so that the coating will be both photopolymerizable and UV protecting after cure. Exemplary photoinitiators Include l-phenyl-2-hydroxy-<br><br><br>
2-methyl-l-propanone; oUgo{2-hydroxy-2methyl-l-[4-(methylvinyl)phenyI]propanone}; 2-hydroxy 2-inetbyl 1-phenyl propan-l one (DAROCURETM 1173, commercially available firom Ciba Specialty Chemicals); bis (2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4,4-trijmethylpenty] pbospbine oxide; 2,4,6- Irime&amp;yl benzoyl-diphenylphosphiiie oxide; 2-methyl -l-[4(methylthio) -2- inoipbolinopropan]-l-one; 1-hydioxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone; 4-(2-hydroxy) phenyl-2-hydroxy-2-(methylpropyl)ketoiie; 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl acetophenone; benzophenone; benzoic acid; (n-S,2,4- cycIopei],tadien-l-yI) [1.2,3 .4,5,6-n)-(l-inethylethyl) benzene]-iroii(+) hexafluorophosphate; 4-(dimetfayl aimno)-ethyl ether, and mixtures thereof. Conunercially available phptoinitiatorB include l-hydroxycyclohexylphenyUcetone (IRGACURE™ 184, commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals); a SO.SO weight basis mixture of 1-bydroxycycIohexyiphenylketone and benzophenone (IRGACURETM  SOO, commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals); bis(n,5,2,4-cyclopentadien-l-yl)-bis[2,6 -dilluoroT3-(iH-pyrrol-l-yl)phenyl]titaniiim (IRGACURE TM /84 DC, commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals); 2-benzyl -2-N,N- dimethyl amino -l-(4-moiphoIinophenyl) -1- butanone (IRGACURE™- 369, commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals); 2,2-<br>
TM,<br>
Dimethoxy-l,2-diphenylcthan-l-one (IRGACURE   651, commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals); bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) pheaylphosphineoxide (IRGACURE   ' 819); and the EB3. KBl. TZT, KIP lOOF, ITX, EDB, X15 and KT37 series of ESACURE'^M photoinitiators (commercially available from Sartomer Company). Mixtures of photoinitiators can be employed, and can be especially useful for obtaining good absorption at short wavelengths for surface cure together with good absorption at long wavelengths for bulk cure. When oxygen is present during curing at levels above about 400 ppm then it may be preferable to employ a second photoinitiator that absorbs at a wavelength less than about 360 nm. Suitable second photoinitiators include<br>
IRGACURE™ 184, DAROCURE   1173, hydroxy-alkyl phenyl ketone photoinitiators and benzophenone. When a photoinitiator is employed in the composition, sufGcient photoinitiator should be present to attain the desired rate, degree and depth of photocuring without unduly harming storage stability. Preferably, the composition contains O.l to 8 weight percent photoinitiator based on the total weight of solids in the composition. More preferably, the composition contains  0.5 to 5 weight<br><br><br>
percent photoinitiator and most preferably about 1 to about 4 weight percent photoinitiator.<br>
[0038]      The compositions of theinvention can also containsubmicron inorgaiuc particles such as silica or aluznina particles. Inclusion of such particles can alter the hardness, scratch resistance or abrasion resistance of the cured coating, sometimes accompanied by a decrease in UV resistance. Preferably the inorganic particles are submicron particles having an average particle diameter leas than  100 nxn. Most preferably the inorganic particles are fimctionalized or are treated with a suitable coupling agent (e.g., a silanbl) to increase the available loading level or to improve pax^icle retention in the cured coating. Representative inorganic particles are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,104,929 CBilkadi) and Pickett et al., and include fiuned silicas such as ABROSILTM OX-SO silica (commercially available froni Degussa&gt;Htils AG) and CABOSIL TM MS silica (commercially available from Cabot Corp.); silica hydrosols such as the NALCOTM series of colloidal silica sols (commercially available from Nalco Chemical Company), the LUDOX'"' series of silica sols (oommercially available from DuPont Silica Products) and the KLEBOSOL™ and HIGHLINK'™ series of colloidal silica sols (commercially available from Clariant Corporation). Representative aluminas include   Aluminum Oxide C (commercially  available firom Degussa-Hiils AG) and KLEBOSOL™ 30CAL25 alumina modified colloidal silica (commercially available from Clariant Corporatibn). When hydrosols are employed, suitable control or adjustmetit of pH may be desirable to maintain a dispersion of the inorganic particles and to prevent lindesired side reactions or inadvertent cure. When employed, the composition should contain sufficient inorganic particles to provide the desired degree of hardness and scratch or abrasion resistance. When siUca is used as the subiuicron pailiclc, the composition preferably con.tains   1 to   65 weight percent inorganic particles based on the total weight of solids in the composition, more preferably   IS to 60 weight percent inorganic particles, and most preferably<br>
2S to   50 weight percient inorganic particles. Hairdness and scratch or abrasion resistance are often more dependent on particle volume fraction than on particle weight fraction, so these values preferably are adjusted as appropriate when inorganic particles having a density significantly different from that be silica are employed.<br><br><br>
[0039]       The compositions of the invention can contain a variety of adjuvants to alter the behavior or performance of the composition before or after apphcation to a support. Preferred adjuvants include fillers (e.g., particles of about 1 to about 10 micrometers average particle diameter), which can impart a hazy or diffuse appearance to the cured coating. Other preferred adjuvants include pigments, dyes, optical brighteners, leveling agents, flow agents and other surface-active agents, defoamers, solvents to aid in coating and to accelerate or to slow the drying rate, waxes, indicators, light stabilizers (e.g., hindered amine light stabilizers or "HALS") and antioxidants. The types and amounts of such adjuvants will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0040]       The smoothness, continuity, weathering characteristics or adhesion of the coating composition to the underlying support preferably can be enhanced by priming, application of a tie layer or other appropriate pretreatment. Preferred pretreatments include low solids solutions of polyvinylidene dichloride; solvent-borne mixtures of polyester resins and aziridine crosshnkers; solvent-bome or aqueous polyol resins with optional crosshnkers such as aziridines or melamines; electrical discharge in the presence of a suitable reactive or non-reactive atmosphere (e.g., plasma, glow discharge, corona discharge, dielectric barrier discharge or atmospheric pressure discharge); chemical pretreatment and flame pretreatment. These pretreatments help make the support more receptive to the cured coating composition. When a tie layer is employed, it may have a thickness of a few nm (e.g., 1 or 2 ran) to about 500 run, and can be thicker if desired. The coating compositions of the invention can be applied using conventional coating methods such as roll coating (e.g., gravure roll coating), spin coating, spray coating (e.g., conventional or electrostatic spray coating), padding or other techniques that will be familiar to those skilled in the art. Preferably the coating is applied at a rate that will yield a cured coating thickness less than about 0.1 mm, more preferably less than about 0.05 mm, and most preferably between about 0.01 mm and about 0.025 mm. On single-side-coated thin supports, excessive curl may be observed when coating thicknesses greater than about 0.05 mm are employed. When high levels of inorganic particles are incorporated into the coating composition then thinner coating thicknesses may be desired in order to achieve through curing.<br>
[0041]       If the coating composition contains a solvent, the applied coating can be dried using air, heat or other conventional techniques. The applied coating can be crosslinked<br><br>
using any appropriate method. When crossiinking using UV radiation, light having a wavelength between 360-440 nni is prefeiTed, with light having a waveleaeth of 39S-440 nm being most preferred. A variety of UV light sources can be employed. Representative sources include   t FUSIONTM H-bulb high-ibtensity mercury lamp (which emits three bands centered at 254, 313, 365 nnl and is comznercially available from Fusion UV Systems, Inc.), a FUSION D-buIb iron-doped mercury lamn (which adds emission at 380-400 nm but which may emit less at lower v/avelengths, and is commercially available from Fusion UV Systems, Lac.) and a FUSION V-butb gallium-doped mercury lamp (which adds emission at 404-415 nm but which may emit less at lower wavelengths, and is comznercially available from Fusion UV Systems, Laic.). In general, lower wavelengths promote surface cure and higher wavelengths promote bulk cure. A FUSION D-b.ulb generally represents a dJesirable overall compromise. Curing can take place undef a suitable atmosphere, e. g., a nitrogen atmosphere to provide inerted curing.<br>
[0042)       The cured coating preferably is visible light transmissive and niore preferably is optically clear. The cured coating preferably provides significant protection against not only uy exposure but also weathering in general. The bcnzotriazole component in the coating can provide useful absorbance at wavelengths beyond 400 nm when used la a suitably high concentration, while exhibiting permanence in the polymer network and an absence of blooming. Most preferably the cured coating enables an underlying support to have at least a S and most preferably at least a 10 year useful life When weathered outdoors in Miami, Florida at a 45° south-facing exposure angle. End of useful lifotin such an evaluation can be taken as the time at which excessive yellowness occurs (as indicated by an increase of 4 or more in the b*-value obtained using a D65 light source, reflected mode and the CIE L*a*b* color space); or by significant cracking, peeling or dclainination; or by sufficiently intense haze to be objectionable td the naked eye. Weathering can also be evaluated using the sarhe criteria and a suitable accelerated weathering testing cycle such as the cycle described in ASTM G155 or equivalent. When so evaluated, the cured coating preferably maintains acceptable appearance through a radiant dose of 17,000 kJ/m2 at 340 nm (believed to be equivalent to about 5 years of Miami, Florida 45" south-facing exposure] and more preferably maintains acceptable; appearance through a radiant dose of 34,000 kJ/m2 at 340 nm (believed to be eqiuvalent to about 10 years of Miami,<br><br>
Florida 45° south-facing exposure). Unacceptable appearance is taken to be an increase of<br>
the b* value by 4 units or more, or the onset of significant cracking, peeling, delamination<br>
or haze. In contrast, unprotected naphthalate polyester films have a usefiil life of onlv<br>
about 6 to 12 months when weathqred outdoors in Miami, Florida at 45° south-facing<br>
exposure angle, and maintain acceptable appearance through a raiiiant dose of about 2,340<br>
kJ/m2 at 340 nm when evaluated using an accelerated weathering testing cycle.<br>
[0043]       Various functional layers or other supplemental coatings can be applied to the<br>
ciured coating, contposition to alter or improve the cured coating <br>
chemical properties. Such supplemental coatings can include<br>
antireflective coatings; anti-fogging coatings; antistatic coatings; flame retardants;<br>
additional abrasion resistant or hardcoat layers; visible light-transmissive conductive<br>
layers or electrodes (eg., of indium tin oxide); magnetic or magneto-optic coatings or'<br>
domains; photographic emulsions or images; prismatic coatings; holographic coatings or<br>
images; adhesives such as pressure sensitive adhesives or hot melt adhesives; primers to<br>
promote adhesion by adjacent layers; and low adhesion backsize materials for use when<br>
the coated support is to be used in adhesive roll form.<br>
[0044]       The coatings of the invention can be treated with, for example, inks or other<br>
printed indicia such as those used to display product identification, orientation<br>
infonnation, advertisements, warnings, decoration, or other information. Variotis<br>
techniques can be used to print on such articles, including screen<br>
printing, inkjet printing, thermal transfer printing, letterpress printing, offset printing,<br>
flexographic printing, stipple printing, laser printing, and so forth A variety of inks can<br>
be used, including one and two component inks, oxidatively drying and UV-drying inks,<br>
dissolved inks, dispersed inks;-and 100% ink systems.<br>
[0045]       The-coatings of the invention can be used for a variety of ^plications.<br>
Representative apphcatidns inplude but are not limited to coatings on multilaver visible<br>
mirror films such as those used in mirfors, .light tubes, lamp and bulb cavity reflectors,<br>
solar concentrators,     solarcollectors, mirror firushes and imitation chrome;<br>
multilayer infirared ("IR") mirror apphcations such as.vehicular or .architectural<br>

bodies; apparel (e.g., athletic shoes) and home appliances.<br><br>
[0046] The invention will now be described with reference to the following non-limiting examples, in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Examples 1-12 and Comparative Examples 1-5<br>
[0047]       The solubility of the benzotriazole 2-(2-hydroxy-3-alpha-cumyl-5-t-octylplienyl)-5-trifluoromethylbenzotriazole (CGL-139, experimentally available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals) in various solubilizing monomers was determined. Mixtures were made up using 5% increments of the benzotriazole. The benzotriazole and solubilizing monomer to be tested were mixed with gentle heating to 70° C in a water bath until dissolved, then allowed to stand for 48 hours at room temperature. After 48 hours, each mixture was inspected for benzotriazole precipitation. Solubility was determined to within 5% by recording the highest concentration tested for which there was no precipitation and the lowest concentration for which precipitation occurred. The results are set out below in Table 1. Where reported in the hterature, the Tg of a polymer made entirely of the tested solubilizing monomer is also given.<br><br><br><br>
Examples 21-27 and Comparative Examples 6-17<br>
[0051]       Several coating compositions were prepared by adding varying amounts of CGL-139 benzotriazole to mixtures cpntaining isobomyl aery late ("IBOA", obtained as SR-506 from Saitomer Company), hexanediol diacrylate ("fiDODA", obtained as SR-238<br><br><br>
applied using a standard coater, dried and cured in-line using a 12 ni/min line speed at coating thicknesses ranging from 6 to 35 micrometers in an inert atmospbeare having an oxyjgen concentration below .100 ppm. UV photocuring energy was supplied using a high intensity FUSIONTS-bulb powered with 236 Joules/sec-om input power. Under those<br><br>
conditions the D-bulb yielded doses and intensities in the various UV wavelength regions set out below in Table 3.<br><br>
[0054]       The coated ari:icles were exposed to an accelerated weathering test similar to the procedure in ASTM G155, using a modified cycle 1 with a black panel temperature of 70° C during the light only cycle, and were then evaluated at intervals corresponding to UV dose levels of 9,400, 18,700, and 30,500 kj/m2 at 340 nm. These doses are beheved to be equivalent to more than 2.5, 5, and 8.25 years, respectively, of outdoor weathering in Miami, Florida at a 45° south-facing exposure angle. The change in the b* value was measured at each interval using a BYK Gardner TCSII Colorimeter and a D65 light source, large area reflected mode, specular included, CIE L*a*b* color space. Set out below in Table 4 are the Example or Comparative Example No., benzotriazole amount, relative amounts of IBOA/HDODA/PETA/UA/Si02, and the measured change in the b*<br>
value at each weathering interval. The symbol "R" indicates that a sample was retired due to significant cracking, peeling, delamination or haze.<br><br><br><br>
[0055]       As shown in Table 4, coatings containing more benzotriazole and articles with thicker coatings tended to give better weathering performance. The articles of Examples 21 and 22 (which contained 20 percent benzotriazole had a 10 μm coating thickness) did not reach or exceed a 4 unit b* increase until a dose of 23,400 kj/M2, whereas the articles of Comparison Examples 6 and 7 (which contained 10 percent benzotriazole and had a 10 μm coating thickness) exceeded a 4 unit change after a dose of 9,400 and 14,000 kJ/m2, respectively. The article of Example 23 (which contained 22 percent benzotriazole and had a 20 |j,m coating thickness) did not reach or exceed a 4 unit b* increase until a dose of 28,100 kJ/m2, whereas the article of Comparison Example 8 (which contained 8 percent benzotriazole and had a 20 |am coating thickness) exceeded a 4 unit change after a dose of 23,400 kj/M2. The article of Comparison Example 9 (which contained 15 percent benzotriazole and had a 20 ).im coating thickness) exceeded a 4 unit change after a dose of 28,100 kJ/m2 and thus appeared to give performance roughly comparable to the article of Example 23. However, in a further comparison performed using a higher IBOA level, the article of Example 24 (which like the article of Example 23 contained 22 percent benzotriazole and had a 20 |j,m coating thickness) had not yet exceeded a 4 unit b* increase after a dose of 28,100 kJ/m2, whereas the articles of Comparison Examples 10 and 11 (which contained 8 and 15 percent benzotriazole, respectively and had a 20 μm coating thickness) reached or exceeded a 4 unit change after doses of 23,400 and 28,100 kJ/m , respectively. A comparison like that drawn for Examples 23 and 24 and their respective Comparison Examples 8-11 could also be drawn for Examples 25 and 26 and their respective Comparison Examples 12 and 13, with comparable weathering perfonnance being observed for articles containing a lower IBOA level (viz., the articles of Example 25 and Comparison Example 12) and with better weathering perfonnance being observed for an article containing both a higher benzotriazole level and higher IBOA level {viz., the article of Example 26 vs. the article of Comparison Example 13). [0056]       Silica-containing articles also showed improved weathering at high UVA levels. The article of Example 27 (which contained 16.6 percent UVA and had an 11 μm coating thickness) did not exceed a 4 unit change in its b* value until a dose of 23,400 kJ/m2, whereas the articles of Comparison Examples 14-17 (which respectively contained 5.8, 11.1, 15 and 15 percent UVA and had an 11, 11, 8 or 15 μm coating thickness) exceeded a 4 unit change or<br><br>
were withdrawn due to cracking peeling delamination or haze after doses of 9,400 to 18,700 kJ/m2.<br>
Example 28<br>
[0057] A coating solution was prqiared in which butanediol diacrylate served both as the vinyl functional crosslinkable film former and as the solubilizing monomer. 13.58 Parts SR-213 (1.4-butanediol diacrylate), 2.72 parts CGL-139 (UVA), 0.17 parts TINUVlN TM123<br>
(HALS), 0.17 parts IRGACURE ™819 and 0.34 parts IRGACURE TM 184(photoinitiators), o.02 parts TEGO RAD 2100 (leveling agent), and 3 parts ethyl acetate (solvent) were combined and blended until the solids bad dissolved, this correspanded to a CGL-139 loading of 16;0% of the total coating solids. The solution was coated onto a PVdC primed VM2000 film (commercially available firom 3M). The solvent was flashed off at 70 C. The coating was<br>
cured under mtrogen using a FUSIONTMO-bulb. One specimen of the coated article was left at room conditions for one week. The specimen exhibited no blooming during this time. Two additional specimens of the coated ufticle were oven treated at about 100° C for one week. One specimen was allowed to hang free in the oven, while the other was placed horizontally between two glass plates, with a piece of plain polyester film between the upper glass plate and the coated side of the specimen. Neither specimen exhibited signs of blooming.<br><br><br>
