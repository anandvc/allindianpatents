3. Preamble to the description<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
1978<br><br>
2008<br><br>
17 SEP<br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel powder hair color / dye composition with improved fragrance and colour deposition and a method of preparation of the said composition.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Permanent hair dye systems have commonly been comprised of a combination of a dye material and a developer or activator solution, most commonly hydrogen peroxide. Additive materials including thickeners, fillers and perfumes are sometimes included in the hair dye system.<br>
Typically, the two parts of the system are packaged separately until use, when they are combined in one container, then mix well and activate the product and carefully pouring the mixed solution onto the roots of the hair and combing or working the solution into the hair by hand to thoroughly and completely saturate the hair. The mixture is usually left on the hair for about 15 to 30 minutes, depending upon the shade and color depth desired. Finally, the dye solution is shampooed out of the hair and the hair is dried.<br>
Care must be taken to prevent run offs onto clothing, furnishings, etc. Once the two solutions are mixed together, the mixture must be used within a relatively short time, such as within one hour.<br>
Such a conventional system has a variety of shortcomings, including: (1) problems in mixing the components together; (2) the added time needed to prepare the working dye solution; (3) the harshness of the systems to the hair due to ammonia; (4) the additional processing steps, packaging, shipping expenses, and waste generated due to multiple containers.<br>
Two types of powder hair dyes are generally known. One is a so- called one component type, that is a mixture of a powdered oxidation dye and a powdered oxidizing agent packaged together. The powder dye is mixed with water and applied to head to colour the hair and the mixture is kept on hair for 30 to 45 minutes to get the desired colour. The<br>
2<br><br>
other is a so-called two component type, that is a powdered oxidation dye and a powdered oxidizing agent separately packaged. The two component mixture is mixed just prior to their use to prepare a colouring mixture. Both types of dyes can be stored without deterioration until being prepared as the tinting mixture. Incorporation of conditioners and perfumes, in this type product is difficult because of compatibility issue and in powder form. Also incorporation of perfume in presence of oxidizing agent is also a stability issue. Method of preparation plays an important role in stability of the product. Embodiments of the present invention are directed towards these and other objectives.<br>
There is ample literature available on synthetic dyes, precursors to dyes, coupling agents, oxidizing agents etc. in powder form.<br>
European Patent EP1733761 describes an oxidative hair colouring composition comprising yogurt powder for improving combability of hair and further relates to process of coloring hair using said composition in combination with an oxidizing agent, preferably hydrogen peroxide.<br>
US Patent 4,808,189 discloses a powdered hair dye comprising an admixture of an oxidative dye component and an amount of a powdered oxidizing agent, wherein said dye component is present in the form of a cyclodextrin inclusion complex, which will give high stability for longer shelf life, color-fastness and deeper color.<br>
US patent 6,488,918 describes methods of making the powdery cosmetic composition using cross-linked silicone elastomer to improve the storage stability.<br>
US Patent 6,613313 describe an oxidation hair dye composition containing aniline compound which exhibits excellent spreadability, applicability, level-dyeing property and shampoo resistance and a method of dyeing hair with the hair dye composition.<br>
US 5,769,901 describe a powdered hair dye composition comprising: an oxidative dye component in powdered form in an amount effective for coloring hair;<br>
3<br><br>
an oxidizing component in powdered form in an amount effective to activate the oxidative dye component; an effective amount of a thickening component in powdered form; and sucrose in powdered form, wherein the sucrose is present in the hair dye composition in an amount of approximately 30-65 weight percent, based on the total weight of the powdered hair dye composition, wherein said powdered hair dye composition is mixed with water before application to the hair.<br>
Although the above prior arts claim powdered hair dye formulations, however, the problems such as free flowing properties of the formulation, avoiding dusting while manufacturing and application of the powder hair dyes with ease remain a problem till date. Further, incorporation of fragrance in the powdered hair dye is not possible as most of the fragrances are reported to be liquids.<br>
Therefore, the present inventors have attempted to overcome the aforementioned problems by incorporating silicone conditioners as well as encapsulated volatile organic compounds to improve the conditioning together with long lasting encapsulated fragrance and improved colour deposition. The invention further aims to provide improved process for manufacturing hair dye formulation for better stability &amp; efficacy of the product.<br>
Object of the invention:<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to obviate the aforesaid drawbacks by providing a stable composition resulting into a definite keratin colouration with improved conditioning and long lasting fragrance and process for preparation thereof.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
In accordance with the above objective, the present invention discloses a powder hair colour composition for colouring keratin fibers comprising of (i) 1 to 30 % w/w primary intermediates and couplers , (ii) 10 to 45 % w/w powder oxidizing component, (iii) 0.1 to 10 % w/w powder anionic surfactant, (iv) 0.1 to 20% w/w cellulose gum, (v) 0.1 to 10 % w/w hydroxy acids,(vi)   1 to 40 % w/w filler or diluent material,(vi)0.1 to 5% w/w<br>
