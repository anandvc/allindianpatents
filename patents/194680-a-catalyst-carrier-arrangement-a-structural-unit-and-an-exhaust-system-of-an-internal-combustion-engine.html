				<td>This invention relates to a catalyst carrier arrangement, a structural unit and an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine.<br>
The subject of the invention relates to a catalyst carrier arrangement and a structural unit and to an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine.<br>
For catalytically converting components of an exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine, it is known to apply at least one catalytically active substance to a catalyst carrier body. The catalyst carrier body has gas passages through which an exhaust gas can flow. The gas passages extend in the longitudinal direction of the catalyst carrier body. It is known to design a catalyst carrier body in the form of a honeycomb. The catalyst carrier body may be formed from layers of sheet metal which are at least partially structured. Furthermore, catalyst carrier bodies which consist of a ceramic material are known. Such catalyst carrier bodies are extruded.<br>
The catalyst carrier body is arranged in a housing which is part of an exhaust system. Various configurations of the housing are known depending on the material of the catalyst carrier body.<br>
WO 90/02251 has disclosed a housing with a catalyst carrier body which is suitable in particular for installation close to the engine and inside the exhaust system. The housing has a larger cross section than the catalyst carrier body. The housing has an approximately rectangular opening, the length of which is greater than the maximum length of the catalyst<br>
-1A-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
carrier body and the width of which is greater than the maximum width of the catalyst carrier body. The catalyst carrier body is attached to a flat or curved retention plate which has a greater length and width than the opening in the housing. The retention plate serves as a closure cover for the housing, the catalyst carrier body projecting into an inner chamber in the housing. This simplifies installation and removal of the catalyst carrier body in or from the housing.<br>
Further designs of catalyst carrier arrangements are known, for example, from WO 96/27735, WO 96/01698 and WO 96/19647.<br>
Particularly in the case of internal combustion engines which are installed in passenger vehicle, installing a catalyst carrier body close to the engine is not without problems, since the spatial conditions inside an engine chamber of the vehicle are relatively constricted.<br>
DE 26 35 725 A1 has disclosed a catalyst carrier arrangement having a housing in which at least one catalyst carrier body is arranged. The catalyst carrier body has a multiplicity of passages which are separated from one another by partitions and extend in an axial direction of the catalyst carrier body. The housing has a flange which is directed essentially radially outwards. The flange can be arranged between a cylinder head and a manifold of an internal combustion engine. The housing is formed integrally with the flange.<br>
DE 43 17 092 A1 has disclosed a catalyst carrier arrangement which is arranged in the exhaust manifold of an internal combustion engine. The catalyst carrier arrangement has a housing which is designed in the form of a frame. The<br>
-2-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
framelike housing has collar-like beads, in order to ensure that a catalyst carrier body is fixed both radially and axially in the housing. The housing is connected to a flange. The flange is welded to one of the collar-like beads. It is also known from DE 43 17 092 A1 that it is possible to connect the flange to a plurality of housings.<br>
DE 43 22 526 A1 has disclosed a further design of a catalyst carrier arrangement for an internal combustion engine. The catalyst carrier arrangement has a housing in which a catalyst carrier body is arranged. A flange which has a collar which is fixed to the housing is connected to the housing. The flange is fixed, together with an exhaust pipe, to the cylinder head of an internal combustion engine.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of providing a catalyst carrier arrangement which is of simple design and allows installation close to the engine. A further object of the invention is to provide a structural unit which simplifies the assembly of at least two catalyst carrier bodies in the vicinity of the internal combustion engine. A further object of the invention is to provide an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine which can be produced with little outlay.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a catalyst carrier arrangement, a structural unit and an exhaust system. Advantageous refinements and configurations of the catalyst carrier arrangement, the structural unit and the exhaust system form the subject of the respective subclaims.<br>
-3-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
The novel design of the catalyst arrangement has a housing in which a catalyst carrier body is arranged which has a multiplicity of passages which are separated from one another by partitions and extend in an axial direction of the catalyst carrier body. The housing extends at least partially in an axial direction of the catalyst carrier body. The arrangement according to the invention has a housing which has at least one flange which is directed essentially radially outwards, at least partially surrounds the catalyst carrier body and can be arranged between a cylinder head and a manifold of an internal combustion engine. The flange has at least a section which projects at least partially into the housing. This design of the catalyst arrangement according to the invention forms a sharp transition between the housing and the flange, so that the catalyst carrier arrangement according to the invention requires relatively little installation space. Particularly in the case of existing internal combustion engines, the problem exists that they cannot be retrofitted with catalyst carrier arrangements of this type since a catalyst carrier arrangement as is known, for example, from DE 43 22 526 A1 has a radius of curvature in the transition region between [lacuna] and housing. Such a catalyst carrier arrangement can only be fitted by adapting the further components. With the design according to the invention of the catalyst carrier arrangement, it is not absolutely necessary to adapt the exhaust manifold or the cylinder head in this way.<br>
Owing to the fact that the flange extends at least partially into the housing, the load on a joint between flange and housing is also relieved, since some of the forces acting on the catalyst carrier body and the housing are introduced directly into the flange via the housing. Relieving the load<br>
-4-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
on the joint between the housing and the flange also has a beneficial effect on the service life of the catalyst carrier arrangement.<br>
The design of the catalyst carrier arrangement according to the invention also allows retrofitting on existing internal combustion engines, with the result that emissions of certain harmful components of the exhaust gas can be reduced.<br>
The catalyst carrier arrangement preferably has dimensions which are such that the catalyst carrier body can be introduced at least partially into an outlet passage from an internal combustion engine. This arrangement means that the catalyst carrier body, which is provided with a catalyst, can quickly be brought to its operating temperature, so that the emission of harmful components is reduced during a cold-start phase of an internal combustion engine, in particular a vehicle engine.<br>
According to an advantageous configuration of the catalyst carrier arrangement, it is proposed for the housing to have on or in its outer wall a recess into which at least a section of the flange projects. The recess is preferably formed by a groove, in particular a continuously encircling groove. The flange has a passage opening which preferably has an internal diameter which is greater than the external diameter of the housing. The flange is positioned in the region of the groove. Owing to a radially outwardly directed deformation of the housing, at least in the region of the groove, the section of the flange passes into the recess. The plastic deformation of the housing can be achieved by placing the housing under a sufficiently high internal pressure. If appropriate, the<br>
-5-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
deformation of the housing may take place at an elevated temperature.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of the catalyst arrangement, it is proposed for the recess to be formed by at least one radially outwardly directed swaged section in the outer wall. The swaged section is preferably designed in the form of a bead.<br>
According to an even more advantageous configuration of the invention, it is proposed for a section of the flange to extend as far as the catalyst carrier body. If the catalyst carrier arrangement is configured in this way, the housing is preferably of two-part design.<br>
According to an advantageous configuration of the catalyst carrier arrangement, it is proposed for the housing to have an extent in the axial direction of the catalyst carrier body which is smaller, preferably significantly smaller, than a length of the catalyst carrier body. As a result, the catalyst carrier arrangement has a relatively low heat-storage mass, so that an operating temperature of the catalyst carrier arrangement can be reached more quickly. A further advantage of this configuration is to be seen in the fact, that the external dimensions of the catalyst carrier arrangement can be reduced to a required level so that when the catalyst carrier arrangement is arranged in an outlet from an internal combustion engine there is no need to enlarge an outlet passage. The effect is also achieved that the free flow cross section in the outlet passage is reduced by the catalyst carrier arrangement only to an insignificant extent or that the flow behavior of the exhaust gas is affected to an<br>
-6-<br><br>
40552<br>
insignificant extent.<br>
A housing whose extent in the axial direction of the catalyst carrier body is smaller, preferably significantly smaller, than a length of the catalyst carrier body is suitable in particular for accommodating metallic catalyst carrier bodies which are wound helically.<br>
If it is intended, instead of a helically wound catalyst carrier body, to arrange, for example, a catalyst carrier body which is wound in the form of an S in the housing, it is proposed for the housing to be formed by at least two housing parts, each housing part extending over part of the longitudinal extent of the catalyst carrier body. This configuration of the housing has the advantage that it prevents the catalyst carrier body being spread open by the housing parts. It is not necessary for the overall length of the individual housing parts to correspond to the overall length of the catalyst carrier body. There may be free sections between individual housing parts. Given a sufficiently long housing, it is also possible for a catalyst carrier body which is wound in the form of an S to be arranged in a single-piece housing.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of the catalyst carrier arrangement, it is proposed for the housing or the housing parts to be designed in ring or sleeve form. This configuration has the advantage that the housing or the housing parts are relatively simple to produce. The external contour of the housing or the housing parts preferably corresponds to the cross section of the outlet passage or of the exhaust-gas flow path adjoining the outlet passage.<br>
-7-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of the invention, it is proposed for the flange to form a single carrying unit together with a housing or with a housing part. This has the advantage that there is no need to handle a plurality of parts.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of the carrying unit, it is proposed for the housing or a housing part to have at least one stop which can be brought to bear against a catalyst carrier body. This allows a defined installation position of a catalyst carrier body inside the housing or the housing part.<br>
Preferably, the catalyst carrier arrangement is configured in such a way that the flange has at least one sealing surface for gastight connection to a manifold and a cylinder head. The sealing surface is preferably of annular design, so that it surrounds the catalyst carrier body. In this case, a preferred configuration of the catalyst arrangement is one in which the flange itself forms a seal. Such a configuration of the catalyst carrier arrangement is suitable particularly when the catalyst carrier arrangement is arranged directly on the internal combustion engine, since it is possible to dispense with additional sealing means. Thus the flange forms a seal between an engine block and a manifold of the internal combustion engine. The proximity of the catalyst carrier arrangement to the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine ensures that the catalyst carrier body heats up relatively quickly, with the result that the catalyst carrier arrangement can be fully effective within a short time. The flange preferably forms a metallic seal.<br>
-8-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
Depending on the geometry of the seal, it may, under certain circumstances, be expedient to design the flange with at least one sealing element, with the result that the costs of producing the flange can be reduced, since there is no need to accurately form sealing surfaces on the flange.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of the catalyst carrier arrangement, it is proposed for the catalyst carrier body to be a metallic catalyst carrier body. This is preferably a monolithic honeycomb bed. Using a metallic catalyst carrier body has the advantage that the catalyst carrier body can be brazed at least to the housing and/or the flange, so that increased stability of the catalyst carrier arrangement is achieved.<br>
The metallic catalyst carrier body may comprise layers of metal sheet which are at least partially structured. As an alternative, the catalyst carrier body may be produced from a sintered metal.<br>
As an alternative to a metallic catalyst carrier body, it is also possible to use a ceramic catalyst carrier body. In this case, however, it should be ensured that the different thermal expansions caused by different coefficients of expansions of the materials of the catalyst carrier body and of the housing, which is metallic, are compensated for by suitable measures.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of the catalyst carrier arrangement, it is proposed for the catalyst carrier body to have at least one region which has at least one passage which has a larger cross section than the further passages. This measure ensures that the flow behavior of the<br>
-9-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
exhaust-gas stream is not affected, or is affected only to a very slight extent, by the catalyst support. Such an affect is important in particular if it has a feedback effect on the mixture formation within a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine.<br>
According to a further invention idea, a structural unit having at least two catalyst carrier arrangements is proposed, the catalyst carrier arrangement having a common flange. The number is catalyst carrier arrangements preferably corresponds to the number of outlet passages from an internal combustion engine. As a result, it is possible to reduce the assembly outlay on the catalyst carrier arrangements. In particular in the case of a structural unit in which the number of catalyst carrier arrangements corresponds to the number of outlet passages of an internal combustion engine, it is possible, given a suitable design of the internal combustion engine and an appropriately configured structural unit, to connect this structural unit, to connect this structural unit directly to the internal combustion engine, so that part of each catalyst carrier body projects into an outlet passage of the internal combustion engine.<br>
Preferably, such a structural unit is configured in such a way that each catalyst support is arranged inside a sealing surface. As an alternative, appropriate seals may be formed on the joint collar for each catalyst support.<br>
According to a further inventive idea, an exhaust system for an internal combustion engine having a catalyst carrier arrangement and/or having a structural unit is proposed,<br>
-10-<br><br><br>
E 40552<br>
the exhaust system having at least one exhaust-gas flow path in which a catalyst carrier body is at least partially arranged. The exhaust system according to the invention makes it possible to install catalyst carrier bodies in the immediate vicinity of an internal combustion engine.<br>
Preferably, one catalyst carrier body is in each case arranged in each flow path, making it possible to reduce the emission of harmful components in the exhaust gas.<br>
In order to make the exhaust system as effective as possible and to avoid bypass flows of an exhaust gas, it is proposed for each catalyst carrier body with a housing to have a cross section which essentially corresponds to a cross section of an exhaust-gas flow path.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of the exhaust system having at least one manifold which has at least one flange for connection to an internal combustion engine, it is proposed for the collar to bear at least partially against the flange. In particular, the collar is designed in such a way that it can be connected to the flange in a gastight manner.<br>

Figs. 1 and 2 show a first exemplary embodiment of a catalyst carrier arrangement. The catalyst carrier arrangement has a housing 1 which is of two-part design. The housing 1 has a first housing part 2 and a second housing part 3. The first housing part 2 and the second housing part 3 are of essentially tubular design. A catalyst carrier body 4 is arranged inside the housing 1. The catalyst carrier body 4 has a multiplicity of passages 8 which are separated from one another by partitions 7 and extend in the longitudinal direction of the longitudinal axis 12 of the catalyst carrier body 4. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the catalyst carrier body 4 is formed by layers of metal sheet which are at least partially structured and are preferably intertwined in the form of an S. Other configurations of the catalyst carrier body 4 are possible. The catalyst carrier body may also consist of a nonmetallic material, in particular of a ceramic.<br>
-13-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
The housing 1 is divided in a division plane E which runs essentially transversely to the longitudinal direction of the passages 8. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the division plane E lies essentially in a plane of symmetry of the catalyst carrier body 4. However, this is not absolutely necessary. The housing may also be divided asymmetrically.<br>
A flange 5 is arranged between the first housing part 2 and the second housing part 3. The flange 5 is arranged in the division plane E. The catalyst carrier body 4 penetrates through the flange 5. For this purpose, the flange 5 has a passage opening 13 which is adapted to the outer contour of the catalyst carrier body 4. The flange 5 extends through the housing 1 as far as the catalyst carrier body 4.<br>
The metallic catalyst carrier body 4 is at least partially connected to the first housing part 2 and the second housing part 3 of the housing 1. The joint between the catalyst carrier body 4 and the first housing part 2 or the second housing part 3 is preferably a brazed joint. Preferably, there is also a brazed joint between the flange 5 and the catalyst carrier body 4. In addition, or as an alternative, there may be a brazed joint between the flange 5 and the first housing part 2 and/or the second housing part 3 of the housing 1. The joint between the flange 5 and the first housing part 2 and/or the second housing part 3 of the housing 1 may also be a material-to-material joint. The joint may be formed, by way of example, by welding, in particular by laser welding, friction welding, arc welding or resistance welding.<br>
The flange 5 is essentially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 12 of the catalyst carrier body 4. It is also designed to<br>
-14-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
be essentially perpendicular to the housing 1, Owing to the fact that the flange 5 extends as far as the catalyst carrier body 4, there is a sharp-edged transition between the flange 5 and the housing 1. This sharp-edged transition between the flange 5 and the housing 1 allows the catalyst carrier arrangement to be positioned very accurately in the exhaust duct of an exhaust system. In particular, it is not absolutely necessary to machine the edge of an outlet passage on the cylinder. Owing to the fact that the flange 5 projects into the housing 1, the forces acting on the housing 1 from the catalyst carrier body 4 are also introduced into the flange 5 via the housing 3. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the end faces of the housing parts 2, 3 butt against the flange 5. Via these end faces, a force which is acting on the catalyst carrier body and is caused by the flowing exhaust gas is introduced into the flange 5. This reduces the load on the connection between the flange 5 and the catalyst carrier body 4 or between the flange 5 and the first housing part 2 and/or the second housing part 3 of the housing 1. Figure 3 shows an enlarged illustration of the connection region between the housing parts 2, 3 and the flange 5.<br>
The flange 5 has two bores 6, through which attachment elements, in particular screws, can project, by means of which elements the catalyst carrier arrangement is connected to an exhaust system. The bores 6 lie on a common axis 10. The flange 5 is designed as a seal which has at least one sealing surface 9.<br>
As can be seen in particular from Fig. 1, the catalyst carrier body 4 has two passages 14 which are formed at a distance from one another and have a larger cross section than the other<br>
-15-<br><br><br>
E 40552<br>
passages 8 of the catalyst carrier body 4. The passages 14 are formed essentially in the central region of the catalyst carrier body 4. In the case of the catalyst carrier body 4 illustrated in Fig. 1, the passages 14 are formed in the regions in which winding spindles engage for producing the catalyst carrier body 4. The catalyst carrier body is preferably produced in accordance with the method which is known from WO 97/00725 or WO 97/00135.<br>
Figs. 4, 5 and 6 show a second exemplary embodiment of a catalyst carrier arrangement. The catalyst carrier arrangement has a two-part housing 1. A catalyst carrier body 4 is arranged in the housing 1. The catalyst carrier body 4 has a multiplicity of passages 8 which are separated from one another by partitions 7. The passages 8 extend in the longitudinal direction of the catalyst carrier body. The partitions 7 may be formed by metal sheets which are at least partially structured.<br>
The housing 1 is divided in a division plane E which runs essentially transversely to the longitudinal direction of the passages 8, so that the housing 1 has a first housing part 2 and a second housing part 3. Each housing part 2, 3 partially surrounds the catalyst carrier body 4.<br>
A flange 5 is arranged between the first housing part 2 and the second housing part 3 of the housing 1. The flange 5 is of platelike design. It is arranged in the division plane E. The flange 5 has a passage opening 13 through which the catalyst carrier body 4 extends. The form of the passage opening 13 essentially corresponds to the outer contour of the catalyst carrier body 4. The inner edge 15 of the passage opening 13<br>
-16-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
bears against the outer casing of the catalyst carrier body 4. The flange 5 is preferably brazed to the catalyst carrier body 4.<br>
The flange 5 has sealing elements 11, which are arranged on opposite surfaces, with sealing faces 9. The sealing elements 11 end at a distance from the first housing part 2 and the second housing part 3, as can be seen in particular from Fig. 6.<br>
The flange 5 is arranged between the housing parts 2, 3, as illustrated by Figure 6. The mutually facing end faces of the housing parts 2, 3 bear against the flange 5. The flange 5 extends as far as the catalyst carrier body 4. The flange 5 can be joined to the housing 1 or to the housing parts 2, 3 in the manner which has already been explained with reference to the first exemplary embodiment.<br>
Figs. 7, 8 show a further exemplary embodiment of a catalyst carrier arrangement. The catalyst carrier arrangement has a housing 1 which is of two-part design. The housing 1 has a first housing part 2 and a second housing part 3. The first housing part 2 and the second housing part 3 are of essentially tubular design. A catalyst carrier body 4 is arranged inside the housing 1. The catalyst carrier body 4 has a multiplicity of passages 8 which are separated from one another by partitions 7 and extend in the longitudinal direction of the longitudinal axis 12 of the catalyst carrier body 4.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the catalyst carrier body 4 is formed by layers of metal sheet which are at least<br>
-17-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
partially structured and are intertwined essentially in the form of an S, as can be seen from Fig. 7. other configurations of the catalyst carrier body 4 are possible.<br>
The housing 1 is divided in a division plane E which runs essentially transversely to the longitudinal direction of the passages 8. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the division plane E lies essentially in a plane of symmetry of the catalyst carrier body 4. However, this is not absolutely necessary.<br>
A flange 5 is formed between the first housing part 2 and the second housing part 3. The flange 5 lies in the division plane E. The catalyst carrier body 4 penetrates through the flange 5. To this end, the flange 5 has a passage opening 13 which is adapted to the outer contour of the catalyst carrier body 4.<br>
The flange 5 and the housing part 2 form a carrying unit 27. The housing part 2 and the flange 5 are connected to the housing part 2, The flange 5 is preferably brazed or welded to the housing part 2.<br>
As can be seen in particular from Fig. 9, the second housing part 3 lies at a certain distance in the axial direction from the flange 5.<br>
The metal catalyst carrier body 4 is preferably at least partially connected to the first housing part 2 and the second housing part 3 of the housing 1. The joint between the catalyst carrier body 4 and the first housing part 2 or the second housing part 3 is preferably a brazed joint. There is preferably also a brazed joint between the flange 5 and the<br>

E 40552 catalyst carrier body 4.<br>
The flange 5 has two bores 6 through which attachment elements, in particular screws, can extend, by means of which elements the catalyst carrier arrangement can be connected to a cylinder head and/or a manifold of an internal combustion engine (not shown). The bores lie on a common axis 10.<br>
The flange 5 is of platelike design. It preferably forms a seal which has at least one sealing surface 9.<br>
As can be seen in particular from Fig. 7, the catalyst carrier body 4 has two main passages 14 which are formed at a distance from one another and have a larger cross section than the other passages 8 in the catalyst carrier body 4. The passages 14 are formed essentially in the central region of the catalyst carrier body 4. In the case of the catalyst carrier body 4 illustrated in Fig. 7, the main passages 14 are formed in the regions in which winding spindles engage for the purpose of producing the catalyst carrier body 4. The catalyst carrier body is preferably produced in accordance with the method which is known from WO 97/00725 or WO 97/00135.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a further exemplary embodiment of a catalyst carrier arrangement, in full section. The catalyst carrier arrangement has a catalyst carrier body 4. The catalyst carrier body 4 has a multiplicity of passages 8 which are separated from one another by partitions 7 and extend in the longitudinal direction of the longitudinal axis 12 of the catalyst carrier body.<br>
The housing 1 surrounds the catalyst carrier body 4. The<br>
-19-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
housing 1 has an extent in the longitudinal direction of the catalyst carrier body 1 which is smaller, in particular significantly smaller, than the length of the catalyst carrier body 4.<br>
The housing 1 is of annular design. The housing 1 is connected to a flange 5 which, together with the housing 1, forms a carrying unit 27. The flange 5 as such may form a seal.<br>
The flange 5 has a passage opening 13 through which the catalyst carrier body 4 extends. A section 43 which is adjacent to the passage opening 13 projects into the housing 1. The housing 1 has a continuously encircling recess 44, into which the section 43 projects. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated the recess 44 is in the form of a step, as can be seen from Figure 11. The recess 44 is delimited by two faces which run essentially perpendicular to one another and against which the flange 5 bears. The transition region between the flange 5 and the housing 1 is sharp-edged, so that the catalyst carrier arrangement is able to adopt a predefined installation position. The flange 5 is preferably joined to the housing 1 by means of a brazed joint. As an alternative, the flange 5 may be joined to the housing 1 by welding. The brazed joint between the flange 5 and the housing 1 may be formed at the same time as a brazed joint between the housing 1 and the catalyst carrier body. In order to ensure that the flange 5 does not leave its predetermined position when handling the unbrazed catalyst arrangement, it is proposed for the flange 5 to be connected to the housing 1 in a force-fitting and/or form-fitting manner.<br>
In addition to the housing 1 illustrated in Fig. 10, at least<br>
-20-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
one housing part may be provided at a distance from the housing 1. Such an arrangement is expedient in particular if the catalyst carrier body 4 is a metallic catalyst carrier body which is wound in the form of an S.<br>
Figs. 12, 13 and 14 show a further embodiment of a catalyst carrier arrangement. The catalyst carrier arrangement has a single-part housing 1. A catalyst carrier body 4 is arranged in the housing 1. The catalyst carrier body 4 has a multiplicity of passages 8 which are separated from one another by partitions 7. The passages 8 extend in the longitudinal direction of the catalyst carrier body. The partitions 7 may be formed by metal sheets which are at least partially structured.<br>
The catalyst carrier arrangement has a flange 5. A section 43 of the flange 5 projects partially into the housing 1. The housing 1 has a recess 46 in its outer wall 45. The section 43 of the flange 5 projects into the recess 46. The recess 46 is formed by a groove. The groove 46 is designed so as to run continuously around the circumferential direction of the housing 1.<br>
The joint, which is illustrated in particular in Figure 14, between the flange 5 and the housing 1 may also be formed by dividing the housing 1 in the region of the recess 46.<br>
The section 43 of the flange 5 is preferably introduced into the recess 46 in the housing 1 by the external diameter of the housing 1, in the uninstalled state of the housing 1, being smaller than the internal diameter of the passage opening 13, preferably a little smaller than the internal diameter of the<br>
-21-<br><br>
E 40552<br><br>
passage opening 13 of the flange 5. The flange 5 is positioned in the region of the recess 46. Then, the housing 1 is widened at least in the region of the recess 46, so that the section 43 of the flange 5 passes into the recess 46. The housing 1 may be widened, by way of example, by plastic deformation of the housing 1. This plastic deformation can be achieved by mechanically acting on the housing 1. The housing 1 can also be widened by applying a pressurized medium, in particular air, to the internal chamber of the housing 1.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the flange 5 has sealing elements 11 which are arranged on both sides of the flange 5. The sealing elements 11 end at a distance from the first housing part and the second housing part 3, as is illustrated in particular in Fig. 14.<br>
The axial extent of the housing 1 essentially corresponds tc the axial extent of the catalyst carrier body 4. This is not obligatory. The axial extent of the individual housing parts or both housing parts 2, 3 may also be less than the axial extent of the catalyst carrier body 4. The catalyst carrier body 4 may also project out of the housing 1.<br><br>
Figures 15 to 17 show a further exemplary embodiment of a catalyst carrier arrangement. The catalyst carrier arrangeme comprises a housing 1 and a flange 5. A catalyst carrier bod 4 is arranged in the housing l. The catalyst carrier body 4 has a multiplicity of passages which are separated from one another by partitions 7 and extend in the axial direction of the catalyst carrier body 4. The partitions 7 extend essentially in the longitudinal direction of a longitudinal axis 12 of the catalyst carrier body 4. Figure 15 shows that<br>
-22-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
the catalyst carrier body 4 is formed essentially in the form of an S. It is formed by a plurality of layers of metal sheet which are at least partially structured.<br>
The flange 5 extends essentially radially outward. It is of essentially platelike design. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the flange 5 has two bores through which suitable attachment means, in particular screws, can extend, by means of which attachment means the catalyst carrier arrangement is connected to an exhaust system. The bores 6 lie on a common axis 10. This is not absolutely necessary. On its opposite faces, the flange 5 has sealing elements 11. The sealing elements have sealing surfaces 9. The seals 11 form a gastight connection between the exhaust system and the catalyst arrangement and between a housing of an engine, in particular an internal combustion engine.<br>
The flange 5 has a passage bore 13 through which the housing 1 extends. The flange 5 has a section 43 which is adjacent to the passage bore 13. The section 43 of the flange 5 extends partially into the housing 1. On its outer wall 45, the housing 1 has a recess 47. The section 43 projects into the recess 47. The recess 47 is formed by swaged sections 48 which are directed radially outward. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the swaged sections 48 are formed on both sides of the flange 5. The swaged sections are in the form of beads. They may also be designed in the form of nubs or in some other way. The swaged sections may be formed by rams or the like.<br>
Fig. 18 shows a structural unit 25 having a plurality of housings 1 which have a common flange 5. The flange 5 is connected to the housings 1. The flange 5 is formed<br>
-23-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
essentially transversely to the longitudinal extent of the housings 1.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in accordance with Fig. 18, each housing 1 is of oval design, other cross sections of the housings 1 are possible, it is not absolutely necessary for each housing 1 to have the same cross section. The cross sections of the housings 1 may be differently adapted to one another and the distance between the housings 1 may vary. The layout of the cross sections of the housings and their arrangement relative to one another is determined essentially by the geometry of an internal combustion, in particular on the arrangement of the outlet passages and the number thereof. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, four housings 1 which are spaced apart from one another are provided.<br>
The flange 5 is preferably designed in such a way that the opposite side faces 34, 35 in each case form a sealing surface. The side faces 34, 35 are used to connect the structural unit 25 in a sealed manner between a cylinder head and a manifold of an internal combustion engine (not shown).<br>
It can be seen in particular from Fig. 18 that the side face 34 has a sealing surface 39 which is of continuously encircling design. Each housing 1 is arranged inside that surface of the flange 5 which is delimited by the sealing surface 39. As an alternative, each housing 1 may be surrounded by at least one sealing surface. Instead of forming a sealing surface directly on the flange 5, it is also possible to use a sealing element which comes to bear against the collar 5.<br>
-24-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
In order to join the structural unit 25 to a cylinder head and/or a manifold of an internal combustion engine, the flange 5 has bores 6, through each of which a connecting element, for example, a screw or a threaded pin, can extend.<br>
Preferably, each housing 1 has a stop 38 which projects into a chamber 28 in the housing 1. The stop 38 is preferably of annular design. The stop 3 8 may also be designed in the form of projections. The stop 38 is used to fix a catalyst carrier body which is arranged in the chamber 28 in the housing 1.<br>
In order to fix the flange 5 to a cylinder head or a manifold, the flange 5 has bores 6 through which, by way of example, a screw can extend.<br>
A catalyst carrier body 4 is arranged in each housing 1. The longitudinal extent of the catalyst carrier body 4 preferably corresponds to the axial length of the housing 1. in the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the catalyst carrier body 4 is a metallic honeycomb body which comprises smooth metal sheets 2 9 and structured metal sheets 30, which between them delimit passages 8 for an exhaust gas. The catalyst carrier bodies 4 extend on both sides of the flange 5.<br>
As an alternative to a metallic catalyst carrier body, it is also possible to use a ceramic catalyst carrier body, in the case of such a use of a ceramic catalyst carrier body, an insulating mat is arranged between the catalyst carrier body and the housing, with the result that different thermal expansions of the honeycomb body in the structural unit are compressed.<br>

The catalyst carrier arrangement according to the invention is particularly suitable for installation close to the engine. Fig. 19 shows the catalyst carrier arrangement illustrated in Fig, 2 in the installed position. A cylinder head 16 of an internal combustion engine has an outlet passage 17. The opening of the outlet passage 17 is surrounded by a sealing surface 18.<br>
A catalyst carrier body 4 partially projects into the outlet passage 17. The catalyst carrier body 4 is arranged in a two-part housing 1. That section 10 of the catalyst carrier body 4 which is arranged in the carrying unit 2 7 formed by the flange 5 and the first housing part 2 projects into the outlet passage 17. The flange 5 bears against a sealing surface 18 of the cylinder head 16. The flange 5 is designed as a metallic seal. Threaded bolts 19 extend through the openings 6 in the flange 5.<br>
The second housing part 3, together with that section 41 of the catalyst carrier body 4 which is arranged in the second housing part 3, projects into an exhaust duct 21 of the manifold 20. The exhaust duct 21 forms an exhaust-gas flow path 42 for an exhaust gas from the internal combustion engine.<br>
The manifold 20 has a connection piece 22. The connection piece 22 has bores 23 which are of corresponding design to the bores 6 of the flange 5. Threaded bolts 19, which are connected to the cylinder head 16, extend through the bores 6 of the flange 5 and the bores 23 of the connection piece 22. In order to fix the manifold 20 and the flange 5 on the cylinder head 16, nuts 24 are screwed onto the threaded bolts<br>
-26-<br><br>
E 40552<br>
As has already been explained above, the flange 5 is designed in the form of a metallic seal. This configuration of the flange 5 produces a gastight connection between the cylinder head 16 and the manifold 20. For this purpose, the flange 5 bears against the sealing surface 18 of the cylinder head 16. The connection piece 22 also has a sealing surface 26, which comes to bear against the flange 5. The manifold 20, together with the catalyst carrier arrangement, forms part of an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine.<br>
If an internal combustion engine has a plurality of outlet passages 17, a catalyst carrier arrangement may be positioned in each outlet passage.<br>
