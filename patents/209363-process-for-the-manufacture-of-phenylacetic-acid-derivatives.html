Examples of compounds of formula II can be found among the 4-phenyl-pyridine derivatives such as 2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-methyl-N-(6-morpholm-4-yl-4--o-tolyl-pyridin-3-yl)-isobutyramide and among the 4-phenyl pyrimidin derivatives such as 2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-methyl-N-(2-morpholin-4-yl-4-o-tolyloxy-pyrimidin"5-yl)-isobutyramide. It has been surprisingly found that the compounds of formula II are antagonists of the neurokinin-l (NK-1, substance P) receptor. Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter being so-named because of their prompt contractile action on extravaiScular.smooth muscle tissue. The receptor for substance P is a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors.<br>
Compounds of formula II are described e.g. in EP-A-1035115 and WO 00/50398.<br><br>
The following definitions of the general terms used in the present description apply irrespective of whether the terms in question appear alone or in combination.<br>
As used herein, the term "lower alkyr denotes a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group containing from 1-7 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl and the like. Preferred lower alkyl groups are groups with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, A preferred 'lower alkyl substituted by halogen" is trifluoromethyl.<br>
The term "lower alkoxy" denotes a group wherein the alkyl residues are as defined above, and which is attached via an oxygen atom.<br>
The term "halogen" denotes chlorine, iodine, fluorine and bromine.<br>
The term "cycloalkyF denotes a saturated carbocyclic group, containing 3-7 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "cyclic tertiary amine" denotes, for example, pyrrol-l-yl, ixnidazol-1-yI, piperidin-1-yi, piperazin-l-yl, morphoIin-4-yi,thiomorpholin-4-yl, 1-oxo-thiomorpholin-4-yi or l,l-dioxo-thiomorpholin-4-yl.<br>
The term "5 or 6 membered heterocyclic group" denotes, for example pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, oxadiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, fiiryl, pyranyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, isothiazolyl, piperazinyl or piperidyl.<br>
The term "aryl" denotes 5 or 6 membered carbocyclic aromatic compounds or condensed carbocyclic aromatic compounds such as phenyl and naphthyl<br>
The compounds of formula II can be manufactured according to e.g. WO 00/50398, i.e. by converting a compound of formula<br><br>
into the corresponding acid halide (chloride or bromide), and by reacting the obtained halide with a compound of formula<br><br><br>
to a compound of formula II, wherein the definition of the substituents is given above.<br>
Compounds of general formula I can be manufactured, on their turn, by successively alkylating (twice) a compound of formula<br><br>
with an R3a-halide (in the presence of a strong base such as BuLi) to a compound of general formula<br><br>
and I, respectively.<br>
This method for manufacturing the compounds of general formula I is high-yielding but requires the use of the expensive starting materials of formula IV. Furthermore, the dialkylated product of general formula I may contain rather high quantities of the mono alkylated intermediate V and/or of overalkylated compounds, e.g. at the benzene ring. These by-products are quite difficult to remove by crystallization and their concentration in the final product mixture strongly varies in accordance with the reaction conditions. Consequently the above process is unsuitable for scale-up.<br>
Alternatively, the acid of formula IV can be converted into the corresponding ester of formula<br><br><br>
wherein R2a, R2b, R3a, R3b have the significance given above and R7 is lower alkyl. The ester of formula VI is then dialkyiated and subsequently saponified (or hydrolyzed) to the compound of formula I.<br>
The second variant of the state-of-the-art method allows to overcome the above purification problem, but it involves an additional esterification/ saponification (hydrolysis) step, thus still increasing the costs and complexity of the whole manufacturing process.<br>
The problem at the root of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for preparing the compounds of formula I which can overcome the disadvantages mentioned above.<br>
This problem is solved, according to the invention, by a process for preparing the compounds of formula I comprising the steps ofi<br>
a)	reacting a Grignard derivative of a compound of formula<br><br>
wherein X is C1, Br or I, with a compound of formula to a compound of formula <br>
b)	carbonylating the compound of formula IX in the presence of a strong acid, wherein<br>
the compound of formula I is obtained.<br><br>
The process according to the present invention allows to obtain yields which are higher than those provided by the above described conventional process, no major side-products are observed and no complex purification operations are necessary.<br>
Furthermore, the reactants used (formulae VII and VIII) are much cheaper than those applied in the above conventional processes (compounds of formula IV) and are easily available on the market, so that the overall manufacturing costs of compounds of formula I, and therefore also of compounds of formula II, are strongly decreased.<br>
The process according to the present invention is therefore suitable for the scale-up production of the compounds of formula 11.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention R3a, R3a^ are, independently from each other, hydrogen; halogen; lower alkyl, optionally substituted by halogen; lower alkoxy, or cyano; and R3a, R3B are, independently from each other, hydrogen; lower aUcyl; lower cycloalkyl or, if taken together, -(CH2)n- with n=2,3 or 5.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, R3a, R2a are, independently from each other, lower alkoxy; lower alkoxycarbonyl; or lower alkyl optionally substituted by halogen and R3a, R3b are, independently from each other, lower alkyl or, if taken together, -(CH2)5-,<br>
According to a still more preferred embodiment of the invention, the process is applied for the manufacture of 2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyphenyl)-2-methyl-propionic acid.<br>
The Grignard reaction (step a) takes place in an ether, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dipropyl ether, dibutyl ether and the like, or in a mixture of ethers and aromatic solvents such as toluene and xylene. The reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature varying between 15°C and the boiling point of the reaction mixture itself (reflux). The purity of the alcohol intermediate of formula IX is not critical; it can be as low as 70%, for preparing the acid of formula I in a purity of at least 97%.<br>
The carbonylation reaction (step b) is preferably performed at a temperature varying between -20 C and 60C, more preferably between 10 °C and 30 °C, and in the presence of a chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and dichlorobehzene.<br>
The addition of a strong acid is necessary for the carbonylation reaction to proceed. Preferred acids are the fluorinated sulfonic acids of formula CnF2n+iSO3H (n= 0-20, preferably 0-6), C2F5O-C2F4SO3H and mbctures thereof, The acids FSO3H, CF3SOsH-and<br><br>
mixtures thereof are particularly preferred. The strong acid is preferably added in amounts varying between 1 and 10 molar equiv,, preferably between 2 and 5 molar equiv..<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention water is added to the reactants mixture of step b) in an amount up to 5 molar equiv. (relative to the alcohol of formula IX), preferably in an amount varying between 0.1 and 1 molar equiv. and, still more preferably, in an amount varying between 0.2 and 0.7 molar equiv.. The addition of water is not mandatory but it generally enables a reproducible increase of the selectivity towards the compound of formula I. The addition of a reagent such as formic acid, which under the reaction conditions decomposes to give water and CO, has the same effect.<br>
The carbonylation may take place at pressures of CO varying between 1 and 500 bar, preferably between 10 and 100 bar and, even more preferably, between 20 and 60 bar. The concentration, defined as gram of alcohol of formula IX per gram of solvent used, may vary between 1 and 30%, preferably between 1 and 15%, without implying major consequences on yield and selectivity towards the compounds of formula I.<br>
In order to avoid possible decomposition of the alcohol IX during the charging of the reactor, i.e. before the carbonylation starts, it may be appropriate, on a large scale, to add it to the mixture of solvent, acid and water (if necessary), already under CO pressure. The carbonylation reaction is then almost instantaneous. Accordingly, the carbonylation step may take place either in a semi-batch or in a continuous flow reactor.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention concerns a process for the manufacture of compounds of formula II comprising the subsequent steps of converting a compound of formula I into the corresponding acid halide (chloride or bromide) and reacting said halide with a compound of formula III to a compound of formula II, wherein the compound of formula I is obtained by the steps of:<br>
a)	reacting a Grignard derivative of a compound of formula VII with a compound of formula VIII, to a compound of formula DC; and<br>
b)	carbonylating the compound of formula IX wherein the compound of formula I is obtained.<br>
Preferably, the process acicording to the present invention is applied for manufiacturing therapeutically active compounds 2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-methyl-N-(6-morpholin-4-yl-4-o-tolyl-pyridin-3-yI)-isobutyramideor2-(3,5"bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-methyl-N"(2-morpholin-4-yl-4-o-tolyloxy-pyrimidin-5-yl)-isobutyramide.<br><br>
