The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field to which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a stand structure fox foldable vehicle which is simple in construction and can be applied even to a vehicle whose vehicle height is largely changed before and after folding thereof.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br><br><br>
As a stand structure for foldable two-wheel vehicle, there is known, for example, that which is described in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 8-282566 "Foldable Bicycle".<br>
FIG. 10 of the publication describes a bicycle including a pair of roller legs 40 for both moving and stopping.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
According to the above-mentioned technology, adjustment of height at the position where the stand is set out can only be performed, and unbalance of the bicycle at the time of moving and at the time of stopping is restrained by changing the swing angles of the roller legs 40 for both moving and stopping; therefore, the construction is complicated.  In addition, there is no consideration about application to a vehicle whose vehicle height is changed largely before and after folding thereof.<br>
[0004]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a stand structure for foldable vehicle which is simple in construction and can be applied even to a vehicle whose vehicle height is changed<br><br><br>
largely before and after folding thereof.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to attain the above object, the present invention is characterized in that, in a stand structure for foldable vehicle using a stand respectively before and after folding a part of the vehicle, a turning shaft portion of the stand is provided with a ratchet mechanism, and the stand can be held at a predetermined position between a stand storing position and a stand projecting position.<br>
In a vehicle whose vehicle height is largely changed such as a foldable vehicle, the stand can be used by changing the stand height before and after the folding, so that usability can be enhanced.<br>
[0006] The present invention is characterized in that the ratchet mechanism is provided with a release mechanism for releasing the engagement of a ratchet, and the release mechanism includes a release lever for operation in the direction of turning the stand to the storing position, disposed in.the vicinity of the stand along the longitudinal direction of the stand.<br>
In the case of storing the stand into the storing position, the engagement of the ratchet can be released<br><br><br><br>
by operating the release lever in the direction of storing the stand, so that the operation of storing the stand can be performed swiftly. [0007] The present invention is characterized in that the ratchet mechanism is comprised of a ratchet pawl portion turned integrally with the stand, and a ratchet recessed portion provided on the vehicle body side, the stand is held at a predetermined position by engagement between the ratchet recessed portion and the ratchet pawl portion, and the pawl portion is so constructed that the engagement between the ratchet recessed portion and the ratchet pawl portion is released by a release plate rotated integrally with the release lever.<br>
The ratchet mechanism and the release mechanism can be constituted in a simple construction. [0008] The present invention is characterized in that a front wheel of the foldable vehicle is oscillatable to the rear side of the vehicle body, a rear wheel is oscillatable to the front side of the vehicle body, and the stand projecting position is provided on the rear side of the vehicle body with respect to a perpendicular extended downward from a stand turning shaft to the ground.<br><br><br>
Even where the difference in the vehicle height dependent on the folding is large, it is possible to easily cope with this by changing the setting angle of the single stand.<br>

FIG. 3 is an action view for illustrating the folding of the two-wheel vehicle according to the present invention, and description will be made sequentially in correspondence with arrows ® to © shown in FIG. 1.<br>
1)  In the condition shown in FIG. 2, a brake of the front wheel 11 is first applied to lock the front<br><br>
wheel 11, and then a switch for operating the electric motor of the rear wheel 12 is made. Namely, the rear wheel 12 is rotated in the same rotating direction as at the time of running (this is the forward direction); by this, the rear wheel 12 approaches the front wheel 11 in FIG. 3, so that the front swing arm 37 on the side of the front wheel 11 and the rear swing arm 42 on the side of the rear wheel 12 are swung in the directions of arrows (D, ®  with the front swing shaft 57 and the rear swing shaft 58 as centers, respectively. When the above-mentioned switch is made, the control unit drives the motor after releasing lock mechanisms for the front and rear wheels, in the procedure which will be described later. [0017]<br>
2)  The handles 17, 18 (the handle 18 on the deep side is not shown) are folded to the inside as indicated by ®, the rearview mirrors 21, 22 (the rearview mirror 22 on the deep side is not shown) are folded as arrow ®, the handle post 23 is tilted to the rear side of the vehicle<br>
body as arrow ©, and the handles 17, 18 and the rearview mirrors 21, 22 are contained into the vehicle body through the above-mentioned opening portion.  In this case, the storage net 66 and the handles 17, 18 do not interfere with each other, so that folding can be<br><br>
performed even with the luggage contained in the storage net 66. [0018]<br>
3)	The seat 13 is moved forward as arrow ©.<br>
4)	The steps 15, 16 (the step 16 on the deep side<br>
is not shown) are kicked up to the upper side as arrow ®. [0019]<br>
By this, folding of the two-wheel vehicle 10 is completed. The sequence of folding is not limited to the above, and, for example, the handle post 23 may be tilted to the rear side together with the folded handles 17, 18 after the seat 13 is moved forward.<br>
By the folding of the front wheel 11 and the rear wheel 12, the minimum height from the ground of the vehicle body becomes greater than the minimum height from the ground at the time of running which is shown in FIG. 2, and, therefore, the stand 51 is fixed at a position further swung downward from the position shown in FIG. 2. [0020]<br>
FIG. 4 is a side view showing the folded condition of the two-wheel vehicle according to the present invention.<br>
In the condition where the two-wheel vehicle 10 is folded, the two-wheel vehicle 10 has a roughly<br><br><br>
rectangular parallelopiped form which is flat to the left and right and has a width roughly equal to the width 17 0 mm of the number plate of the motorcycle. According to this, the two-wheel vehicle 10 can be easily contained in a component member of the four-wheel vehicle, particularly, in an outer plate, whereby both reinforcing of the four-wheel vehicle and mounting of the two-wheel vehicle are possible at the same time. [0021]<br>
FIG. 5 is a perspective view showing the condition where the two-wheel vehicle is mounted on the four-wheel vehicle according to the present invention, and shows the condition where the two-wheel vehicle 10 is contained in a door 72 fitted to a side body 71 constituting the vehicle body of the four-wheel vehicle 70.<br>
The two-wheel vehicle 10 has component portions so folded that the vehicle width is contained within the width of the number plate, as described above. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the width of the containing space and to reduce the thickness of the door 72, so that a vehicle compartment space of the four-wheel vehicle 70 can be sufficiently secured. [0022]<br>
The four-wheel vehicle 70 has a construction in<br><br>
which the door 72 as a vehicle body component member and side walls 73, 74 as vehicle body component members are provided with outer panels 76, 77, 78 as transparent or translucent outer panel members permitting the inside to be seen therethrough. Therefore, the two-wheel vehicle 10 mounted on the four-wheel vehicle 70 can be visually recognized from the outside, and the four-wheel vehicle 70 permitting the folded two-wheel vehicle 10 mounted thereon to be recognized at a glance has a characteristic design, which can enhance the attractiveness of the article of commerce.<br>
Besides, in the present embodiment, the tires on the rear side consist of two wheels each, and the vehicle has a total of six wheels, three wheels on each of the left side and the right side, but the vehicle is herein referred to as a four-wheel vehicle as a generic name.<br>
[0023]<br>
The above-mentioned four-wheel vehicle 70 includes an on-vehicle generator 301 disposed in a lower portion space S of the side wall 74. The on-vehicle generator 301 is a multi-pole alternator which is of a water-cooled 4-cycle engine integral type and incorporates a starter, and will be detailed later.<br>
[0024]<br><br><br>
FIG. 6 is a perspective view showing two kinds of two-wheel vehicles mounted on the four-wheel vehicle according to the present invention, and shows the condition where the two-wheel vehicle 10 is contained in the door 72 on the left side of the four-wheel vehicle 70 and a foldable two-wheel vehicle 80 (hereinafter referred to simply as "the two-wheel vehicle 80") is contained in the door 79 on the right side.  The two-wheel vehicle 80 will be detailed later.<br>
Thus, the four-wheel vehicle 70 can contain a plurality of the two-wheel vehicles 10, 80 in the doors 72, 7 9 or in other vehicle body component members. [0025]<br>

The sensor ring 106 is for detecting the rotational frequency of the wheel 68.<br>
The rotary magnet body 112 and the stator 115 are members constituting an electric motor 116. Numeral 117 denotes an axle of the rear wheel 12. [0039]<br>
FIG. 13 is a sectional view (exploded view) showing the wheel structure of the two-wheel vehicle according to the present invention.  The wheel 68 includes a hub portion 121 for receiving the axle 117, a disk portion 122 spreading radially outwards from the hub portion 121, and a rim portion 123 provided at the outer circumference of the disk portion 122, with a tire 124 fitted on the rim portion 123.<br>
The disk portion 122 is a portion integrally formed with a drum 127 constituting a drum brake 126 on the side facing the rear swing arm 42. Numeral 128 denotes a cast iron liner which is insert molded on the inside of the drum 127 for enhancing abrasion resistance, 131 denotes a magnet body fitting portion provided at the inside<br><br><br>

The rear swing arm 42 includes a convex portion 135 provided at the periphery of the axle 117, and the stator 115 fitted to the convex portion 135 by bolts 137 ..., in which the convex portion 135 functions also as a brake panel (which is a component part of the drum brake 126).<br>
Namely, the convex portion 135 is a portion for fitting thereto brake shoe shafts 138, 138 (the brake shoe shaft 138 on one side is not shown) which constitute a swing shaft for the brake shoe (not shown) to be pressed against the inner circumferential surface of the cast iron liner 128 of the drum 127, and a cam shaft 143 which is formed at its one end with a cam 141 for moving the brake shoe to the drum side and is integrally fitted at its other end with an arm member 142 to be swung attendant on a brake operation.<br>
[0041]<br>
FIG. 14 is a sectional view showing the wheel structure of the two-wheel vehicle according to the present invention, and shows the condition where the axle<br><br>
117, the stator 115 of the electric motor 116, the brake shoe shafts 138, 138 (symbol 138 on one side is not shown) of the drum brake 126 and the cam shaft 143 are fitted to the convex portion 135 of the rear swing arm 42, the wheel 68 is rotatably fitted to the axle 117 through bearings 145, 146, the drum 127 of the drum brake 126 is integrally formed on the disk portion 122 of the wheel 68, the sensor ring 106 is fitted to the disk portion 122 of the wheel 68 by bolts 147 ..., and the rotary magnet body 112 is fitted to the inner circumferential surface of the rim portion 123.

The above-mentioned wheel 68 has a structure in which the electric motor 116 for driving the wheel 68 is incorporated in the wheel 68, and the drum brake 12 6 for braking the wheel 68 is disposed on the radially inner side of the electric motor 116. Therefore, the electric motor 116 and the drum brake 126 can be disposed concentrically, the width of the wheel 68 can be made small, and a small-type compact wheel 68 can be achieved. Such a wheel structure may be adopted for the front<br><br>
wheel 11 (See FIG. 2).<br>
[0043]<br>
In addition, since the electric motor 116 and the drum brake 126 are provided on the same side of the disk portion 122 of the wheel 68, it is possible to enhance the assemblability of the electric motor 116 and the drum brake 126 to the wheel 68 and the maintainability of the electric motor 116 and the drum brake 126.<br>
[0044]<br>
Further, since the rear swing arm 42 as a rear wheel support member for rotatably supporting the wheel 68 functions also as a brake panel of the drum brake 126 and is fitted with the stator 115 of the electric motor 126, the number of component parts can be reduced as compared with the case where a stator-fitting member is provided and/or the brake panel is specially provided. Besides, at the time of manufacture, component parts (the brake shoe shaft 138, the brake shoe, the cam shaft 143, the arm portion 142, etc.) of the drum brake 126 and the stator 115 can be preliminarily and partly assembled onto the rear swing arm 42, and, separately, the sensor ring 106 and the rotary magnet body 112 can be preliminarily and partly assembled onto the wheel 68; therefore, by the process of fitting the partly assembled wheel 68 to the<br><br>
partly assembled rear swing arm 42, productivity can be enhanced.<br>
[0045]<br>
Furthermore, with the wheel 68 provided with the rotary magnet body 112, according to the present invention, a slip ring mechanism or the like for supplying electric current to the stator 115 is unnecessitated and structure is simplified, as compared with the case where, for example, the stator is provided on the side of the wheel.  In addition, with the rotary magnet body 112 included of the magnetic material ring 111 and the permanent magnets 107 ..., 108 ... fixed on the magnetic material ring 111, the magnetic material ring 111 on which the permanent magnets 107 ..., 108 ... are preliminarily fixed can be fitted to the wheel 68, whereby assemblability can be enhanced as compared with the case where, for example, the permanent magnets are fitted directly to the wheel.<br>

ST05:  It is judged whether or not the lock detection switch of the lock pin for locking the front<br><br>
swing arm and the rear swing arm is OFF (namely, whether or not the front swing arm and the rear swing arm are unlocked).<br>
When the lock detection switch is ON (NO) (namely, when the locked condition is detected), ST05 is carried out again.<br>
When the lock detection switch is OFF (YES) (namely, when the unlocked condition is detected), ST06 is entered. [0059]<br>
ST06: An electric current is passed to the electric motor to rotate the rear wheel forward, thereby starting the folding of the front and rear wheels.<br>
ST07:  It is judged whether or not the lapse of time t from the start of passage of the electric current to the electric motor is shorter than a predetermined period of time tst.<br>
When t ^ tst (NO), ST09 is entered.<br>

ST09:  Passage of electric current to the electric motor and the solenoid is stopped. [0061]<br>
Next, the action of folding the front and rear wheels will be described along the flow shown in the flowchart in FIG. 10.<br>
First, in FIG. 1, the motor operating switch 24 provided on the right-side handle 18 is tilted to the "FOLD" side. [0062]<br>
Then, when the front brake is operated by gripping the front brake lever (not shown) provided on the right-side handle 18, the front lever is locked by the brake lock lever which will be described later, and a rear brake lever (not shown) provided on the left-side handle 17 is ungripped and therefore the rear brake is not operated, it is detected by a front brake operation detection switch (not shown) that the front brake is operated, whereas it is detected by a rear brake operation detection switch (not shown) that the rear brake is not operated, and a control device (not shown)<br><br>
passes an electric current to the solenoid shown in FIG. 18, thereby operating the actuator 17 8. [0063]<br>
FIGS. 21(a), (b) are action views for illustrating the action of the swing arm unlocking mechanism according to the present invention.<br>
When the actuator 178 (See FIG. 18) is operated, in (a), the arm lock pin 165 is pulled through the wire 168, and is moved as indicated by the arrow, so that the tip end of the arm lock pin 165 is disengaged from the penetration hole 161a of the projected piece 161, and the front swing arm 37 is unlocked.<br>

and the rear wheel 12 is driven at a low speed by the electric motor 116. The rotating direction of the electric motor 116, namely, of the rear wheel 12 at this time is the forward rotation direction (the rotating direction at the time of running, namely, the direction of the arrow).<br>
[0065]<br>
By this, the rear wheel 12 moves to the front side of the vehicle body (the direction of the void arrow (front) is the front side). At this time, the front wheel 11 is in the braked condition and is not moved to the front side of the vehicle body, so that the distance between the front wheel 11 and the rear wheel 12 is decreased, whereby the front swing arm 37 and the rear swing arm 42 respectively unlocked with reference to the vehicle body are tilted with the front swing shaft 57 and the rear swing shaft 58 as centers, respectively, gradually into folded conditions.<br>
[0066]<br>
Then, when the predetermined period of time has elapsed from the start of the passage of electric current to the electric motor 116 or when the front wheel folding detection switch 184 and the rear wheel folding detection switch 186 are both turned ON, the control device stops<br><br>
the passage of electric current to the electric motor 116. By this, the folding of the front and rear wheels 11, 12 is completed. [0067]<br>
Next, the action of unfolding the front wheel 11 and the rear wheel 12 which have been folded will be described below.<br>
FIG. 23 is a flowchart for illustrating the main points of unfolding the front and rear wheels of the two-wheel vehicle according to the present invention.  STXX represents a step number.<br>
ST11:  It is judged whether or not an unfolding switch (Here, the motor operating switch is referred to as the unfolding switch in the meaning of using the motor operating switch by tilting to the "UNFOLD" side.) provided on the handle is ON.<br>
When the unfolding switch is OFF (NO), ST11 is carried out again.<br>
When the unfolding switch is ON (YES), ST12 is entered. [0068]<br>
ST12:  It is judged whether or not the front brake has been operated by gripping the front brake lever.<br>
When the front brake has not been operated (NO),<br><br><br>
ST12 is carried out again.<br>
When the front brake has been operated (YES), ST13 is entered. [0069]<br>
ST13: It is judged whether or not the rear brake lever has been ungripped and the rear brake has not been operated.<br>
When the rear brake has been operated (NO), ST12 is carried out again.<br>
When the rear brake has not been operated (YES), ST14 is entered. [0070]<br>
ST14:  It is judged whether or not the lock detection switches on the front swing arm side and on the rear swing arm side are OFF.<br>
When the lock detection switches are ON (NO), ST14 is carried out again.<br>
When the lock detection switches are OFF (YES), ST15 is entered. [0071]<br>
ST15: An electric current is passed to the electric motor to rotate the rear wheel reversely, thereby starting to unfold the front and rear wheels.<br>
ST16:  It is judged whether or not the lapse of<br><br><br>
time t from the start of passage of electric current to the electric motor is shorter than a predetermined period of time tst.<br>
When t = tst (NO), ST16 is carried out again.<br>
When t 
ST17: The passage of electric current to the electric motor is stopped. [0072]<br>
The condition of ST14 mentioned above will be described referring to the following figure.<br>
FIGS. 24(a), (b) are action views for illustrating the condition of the lock detection switch according to the present invention.<br>
In (a), in the condition where the front and rear wheels are folded, the projected piece 161 (See FIG. 21(a)) is located on the outside of the window 158, so that there is nothing that restricts the position of the tip end of the arm lock pin 165, and the arm lock pin 165 is in the condition of being moved to the most left-side position in the figure by an elastic force of the spring 167. [0073]<br>
In (b), with the arm lock pin 165 moved to the most left-side position, the roller of the lock detection<br><br><br>
switch 174 comes off from the detection piece 173, so that the lock detection switch 174 is turned OFF.<br>
Based on this OFF condition, the control device starts passing an electric current to the electric motor 116, in FIGS. 22(a) and (b), so that the front and rear wheels 11, 12 are unfolded. [0074]<br>
Next, the condition immediately before completion of the unfolding of the front and rear wheels 11, 12 will be described.<br>

The handle post 23 is a member provided with step portions 23d, 23e (symbol 23e is not shown; detailed later), adjacently to the groove portions 23b, 23c. [0100]<br>
The action of the handle support mechanism 227 described above will be described below.<br>
FIGS. 37 (a) to (c) are action views for illustrating the action of the knob of the handle support mechanism according to the present invention, in which (a) is a sectional view, and (b) and (c) are views of the bar 266 and the handle post 23 from direction A of (a).<br>
In (a), the knob 236 is pushed, whereby the bar 266<br><br>
is lifted from the groove portions 23b, 23c of the handle post 23.<br>
[0101]<br>
In (b), with the bar 266 lifted from the groove portions 23b, 23c, the knob 236 comes to be rotatable. Then, the knob 236 is rotated in the direction of the arrow. Since the above-mentioned step portions 23d, 23e are present in the direction of the arrow of each of the groove portions 23b, 23c, the knob 236 can be rotated without interference with the handle post 23.<br>
[0102]<br>
In (c), the knob 236 is shown as being rotated by 90°  from the position of (b).  The bar 266 comes into the condition of being disposed along the cutout portion 23a of the handle post 23, whereby the knob 236 becomes capable of coming out of the cutout portion 23a of the handle post 23 together with the handle clamp lever 237 (See (a)), namely, the connection between the handle post 23 and the handle clamp lever 237 is released by the knob 236.<br>
[0103]<br>
FIGS. 38(a), (b) are action views for illustrating the actions of the handle clamp lever and peripheral component parts of the handle support mechanism according<br><br><br>
to the present invention. While description will be made below based on the constitution on the side of the handle 17, the same action applies also to the side of the handle 18:<br>
In FIGS. 37(a) to (c), the knob 236 is rotated to release the connection between the handle post 23 and the handle clamp lever 237, and, thereafter, in FIG. 38(a), the handle clamp lever 237 is kicked up in the direction of the arrow with the connection pin 243 as a center. [0104]<br>
Returning to FIG. 34, the distance LI between the first end portion 241a of the handle clamp lever 237 and the axis of the connection pin 243 is greater than the distance L2 between the second end portion 241b and the axis of the connection pin 243, and, therefore, in FIG. 38(a), a gap with a distance C is generated between the second end portion 241b and the washer 262 by the kick-up of the handle clamp lever 237. [0105]<br>
With the gap with the distance C thus generated, in (b), the handle 17 can be moved in the direction of the arrow together with the nut member 244 and the center bolt 253, and the convex portion 17d of the handle 17 can be disengaged from the recessed portion 263 of the handle<br><br>
post 23, whereby restriction on the rotation of the handle 17 is eliminated, and the handle 17 can be folded.<br>
[0106]<br>
FIG. 39 is a front view showing the folded condition of the handles according to the present invention, and shows the condition where the handles 17, 18 are folded to the greatest extent.<br>
Thus, by folding the handles 17, 18, the maximum width WH (The maximum width WH is smaller than the width of the above-mentioned number plate.) of the handles 17, 18 can be made to be very small, as compared with the maximum width of the handles 17, 18 before folding, which is markedly advantageous as to the containing space, particularly, the containing width in the case of mounting the two-wheel vehicle on a vehicle.<br>
[0107]<br>
FIG. 40 is an illustration for illustrating the folding of the rearview mirrors according to the present invention. After the folding of the handles 17, 18 is completed, the rearview mirrors 21, 22 are rotated in the directions of the arrows so as to have roughly the same width as the width in the vehicle width direction of the handles 17, 18 (namely, the interval of the handles 17, 18) . Here, after the rearview mirrors 21, 22 are rotated,<br><br>
the reflective surfaces of the rearview mirrors 21, 22 are directed to the lateral sides of the vehicle body. Where the maximum width of the rearview mirrors 21, 22 at this time is WM, the maximum width WM is smaller than the width of the above-mentioned number plate. [0108]<br>

Even where the difference in vehicle height before and after folding is large, it is possible to easily cope with this by changing the setting angle of the single stand 51.<br>
In addition, the function of the stand 51 can be sufficiently displayed before and after the folding. [0133]<br>
FIG. 50 is a perspective view of the handles of the two-wheel vehicle according to the present invention, and shows that winkers 233, 234 are respectively provided on the front side of the vehicle body of switch cases 231,<br><br>
232 fitted to the handles 17, 18 (For 234, the.condition where LEDs are not fitted is shown.). [0134]<br>
The winkers 233, 234 are included of a plurality of LEDs, which are characterized by small size, low heat properties, and high luminance.<br>
Because of the small size, the winkers 233, 234 and, hence, the switch cases 231, 232 can be constituted to be compact.<br>
In addition, because of the low heat properties, there is no risk of thermally affecting other electrical components contained in the switch cases 231, 232.<br>
Further, because of the high luminance, the visual recognizability of the winkers 233, 234 from the front side can be enhanced. The winker is disposed on the back surface of the switch case on the upper side of the brake lever, the group of LEDs of 233a are provided in three stages while being directed to the front side, and the group of LEDs of 233b are provided in three stages while being directed to the left front side, so that recognizability from the front side and from the lateral side is secured. As for the winker 234, the LEDs are disposed similarly. [0135]<br><br><br>
FIG. 51 is a sectional view taken along line 51-51 of FIG. 50, and shows that a slant surface 561 curved down toward the front side is provided in the switch case 231, the slant surface 561 is provided with hole portions 562 ... in a stepped form, and the LEDs 563 are respectively inserted in the hole portions 562 .... Each of the LEDs has a terminal connected to a substrate 564, and the substrate 564 and base members (561, 562) are joined integrally.  Since the LEDs are held by the base members, the LEDs are advantageous against vibration. Numeral 565 denotes a lens, 566 denotes a left-right tiltable winker switch, and 567 denotes a horn switch. [0136]<br>
FIG. 52 is a perspective view showing another embodiment of the winker switch of the two-wheel vehicle according to the present invention, and shows that a jog dial switch 571 is adopted as the winker switch. Here, numeral 572 denotes the handle, 573 denotes a grip, and 574 denotes a rear brake lever. [0137]<br>
The jog dial switch 571 not only has the function of the winker switch but also has the function of a dimmer switch for changeover between a high-beam and a low-beam of the head lamp and the function of a horn<br><br>
switch. A display portion 568 for displaying the switch functions is provided on an upper surface of the switch 571; the upper and lower HI/LOW arrows represent the dimmer switch, and the left and right TURN arrows represent the winker switch. [0138]<br>
Where the jog dial switch 571 is thus fitted to the handle 572 of the two-wheel vehicle, the surroundings of the handle can be constructed in a small-type simple construction, as compared with the case of separately fitting various switches, and in conjunction with the small-type LED winkers, the handle switches can be made more smaller in size. [0139]<br>
FIG. 53 is a front view of the jog dial switch according to the present invention. The jog dial switch 571 includes an operating portion 576 having a concave surface at a central portion thereof.<br>
Numeral 577, 578 respectively denote a left operating button and a right operating button which constitute the winker switch; when the left operating button 577 is pressed, the left winker blinks, and when the right operating button 578 is pressed, the right winker blinks.<br><br>
[0140]<br>
Numeral 581, 582 respectively denote an upper operating button and a lower operating button which constitute the dimmer switch; when the upper operating button 581 is pressed, the high-beam is turned ON, and when the lower operating button 582 is pressed, the low-beam is turned ON.<br>
Numeral 583 denotes a horn switch button disposed at the center of the operating portion 576; when the horn switch button 583 is pressed, a horn sounds. [0141] [Effects of the Invention]<br>
