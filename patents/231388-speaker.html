				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a speaker having an<br>
attaching construction, in which the speaker is mounted on<br>
a plate by the utilization of an elastic deformation and<br>
restoration of an engaging piece.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally,it is a general practice to use an<br>
attaching construction shown in Figs. 6 and 7 as a<br>
structure to mount a speaker on a plate. In Figs. 6 and 7,<br>
1 is a speaker, 2 is a frame generally circumferential in<br>
form, and 3 is a cone-formed vibration plate having a<br>
resilient hook (edge) at nearly an upper end. The frame 2<br>
has an upper plate 2a having an upper surface bonded, by<br>
abutment, with an underside of a top plate 3a of the<br>
vibration plate 3, thus fixing the vibration plate 3 on the<br>
frame 2 at the inner thereof. The frame 2 has a lower<br>
plate 2b having an underside arranged, by abutment, on the<br>
upper surface of a plate 4. A screw 5 at its thread 5a is<br>
screwed in a screw hole 2c formed in the lower plate 2b.<br>
In the Fig. 6 attaching construction, a fixing hole 4a<br>
is  formed  by  screwing  in  the plate 4 a thread 5a of a<br><br>
screw 5, such as a tapping screw, being screwed in the<br>
screw hole 2c, thereby firmly fixing the frame 2 and the<br>
plate 4 together by screwing at three to four points.<br>
Meanwhile, in the Fig. 7 attaching construction, the screw<br>
5 screwed in the screw hole 2c is screwed in the fixing<br>
hole 4b formed in a position corresponding to the screw<br>
hole 2c. A nut 6, e.g. a U-formed speed nut, is screwed<br>
from the tip of the thread 5a projecting downward of the<br>
fixing hole 4b, thereby tightening the frame 2 lower plate<br>
2b and the plate 4 together at three to four points.<br>
However, in the speaker attaching construction in<br>
Fig. 6 or 7, troublesome operation is required in<br>
tightening, one by one, the screw 5 by means of a<br>
screwdriver while holding the speaker 1 during attaching<br>
operation. Furthermore, the Fig. 7 attaching construction<br>
requires the operation to tighten the nut 6 at back of the<br>
plate 4 in addition to the operation to tighten the screw<br>
5 at front of the plate 4.<br>
Consequently, there is a proposal, in Patent<br>
Document 1 (JP-A-2001-352590), of an attaching<br>
construction that fixing is facilitated by the utilization<br>
of elastic deformation and restoration of an engaging<br>
piece. The attaching construction in Patent Document 1 is<br>
a speaker mounting structure that the frame is fixed to a<br>
plate by engaging in a fixing hole formed in the plate the<br><br>
engaging hook and clip formed in the frame. By engaging,<br>
in the plate fixing hole, the engaging hook, downwardly<br>
bent in the left and right lower portion of the frame, the<br>
engaging clip at its slant guide is elastically deformed<br>
by abutted against the upper edge of the fixing hole.<br>
Elastically restored by passing of the slant guide through<br>
the fixing hole, the engaging clip at its U-formed engager<br>
engages with the upper edge of the fixing hole.<br>
Furthermore, the engaging hook and the engaging clip are<br>
arranged inner than the outer edge of an annular seal<br>
member bonded to the frame mounting surface and closely<br>
contacted with the plate, thereby blocking the water<br>
intruding at an opening or fixing hole of the plate by the<br>
seal member and preventing it from flowing toward the<br>
vehicular compartment.<br>
Similarly, Patent document 2 (JP-B-7-9504) discloses<br>
a structure that a frame is projected with an insert-<br>
engager at one end and an insert-receiver at the other end<br>
thereof, so that an engaging fixture is inserted in the<br>
insert-receiver to hold it by a clamp piece and fit and<br>
fix a projection of the engaging fixture in a fit hole of<br>
the insert-receiver, whereby the frame insert-receiver is<br>
inserted in a plate insert hole and the engaging fixture<br>
is inserted in the insert hole into an engagement thereof<br>
with an edge of the insert hole, wherein the engager when<br><br>
inserted in the insert hole is narrowed and the engager<br>
when passed is elastically restored.<br>
Besides, Patent Document 3 (JP-A-4-34091) discloses<br>
an attaching construction eliminated of the need for<br>
tightening the nut at back of the plate. By using a<br>
cylindrical fixing tool having a polygonal engaging piece<br>
at one end and a screw hole at the other end and in a<br>
sheet form bendable circumferentially at between a screw<br>
hole and an engaging piece and having a plurality of clamp<br>
pieces generally L in form, the fixing tool is inserted in<br>
a insert-hole in the plate. By engaging the engaging<br>
piece with an engaging groove corresponding to the<br>
engaging piece form of the speaker main body, rotation is<br>
restricted. Further, a fixing bolt is screwed to the<br>
fixing tool, and projected circumferentially while bending<br>
a center region of the clamping piece thereby attaching<br>
the speaker main body to the plate.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the meanwhile, in the attaching construction of<br>
Patent Document 1, 2 utilizing an elastic deformation and<br>
restoration of the engaging piece, the engaging hook or<br>
insert-engager provided at one side of the frame is caught<br>
in the fixing hole so that the frame is stably mounted on<br>
the plate by an elastic deformation and restoration of the<br><br>
engaging piece serving as an engager of an engaging clip<br>
or fixture provided at the other side of the frame. After<br>
setting up the frame, the engager remains in a state<br>
elastically deformed to a certain extent. The stress,<br>
resulting from the elastic force, is applied to the frame<br>
at all times. This results in a fracture at a stress-<br>
concentrated point in the frame, thus constituting a cause<br>
to lower the durability. Furthermore, where the fixing<br>
hole is different in form or size in the plate or where<br>
the plate has a different thickness, the engager of the<br>
frame could not be engaged thus resulting in a<br>
disadvantage of inferior versatility.<br>
The present invention, proposed in view of the<br>
problem, aims at providing a speaker attaching<br>
construction and speaker that fixing operation can be<br>
facilitated by the utilization of an elastic deformation<br>
and restoration of an engaging piece and, furthermore,<br>
stable setup of the speaker is available by eliminating<br>
the application of the stress due to an elastic force to<br>
the frame, thus improving durability in the frame or the<br>
fixing parts. Another object is to provide a speaker<br>
attaching structure and speaker excellent in versatility<br>
that can cope with the cases where the fixing hole is<br>
different in form or size or where the plate has a<br>
different thickness.<br><br>
The present invention provides a speaker having an<br>
attaching construction for mounting the speaker on a plate,<br>
said speaker comprising removable fixtures each having a<br>
first engaging member on one side of an engaging plate and<br>
a second engaging member formed with an engaging piece on<br>
the other side of the engaging plate, a speaker frame<br>
having receivers at a plurality of fixing points, wherein<br>
the first engaging members are in engagement with the<br>
receivers and wherein the engaging pieces are adapted to<br>
pass through fixing holes of the plate and to be<br>
elastically restored, wherein at least one of the fixing<br>
points is arranged in a lower position of the speaker<br>
frame, characterized in that the fixture located at the<br>
lower position comprises an internal space, whereby water<br>
intruding between the speaker frame and the plate is<br>
drained outward of the plate through said internal space of<br>
the fixture at the lower position.<br>
The fixture is preferably secured on the speaker frame<br>
by tightening a screw in a screw hole formed in the first<br>
engaging member.<br>
The second engaging member may be hollow.<br><br>
A speaker attaching construction in the invention is<br>
characterized by mounting, on a plate, a speaker removably<br>
provided with fixtures, having an engager on one side of<br>
an engaging plate and an engager formed with an engaging<br>
piece on other side of the engaging plate, at a plurality<br>
of points by engaging the engagers with receivers of a<br>
speaker frame, through clamping the plate and an adapter<br>
or the plate by means of the engaging pieces passed fixing<br>
hole of the plate and elastically restored and the<br>
engaging plate or the speaker frame.<br>
Meanwhile, a speaker attaching construction in the<br>
invention is characterized by mounting, on a plate, a<br>
speaker removably provided with fixtures, having an<br>
engager on one side of an engaging plate and an engager<br>
formed with an engaging piece on other side of the<br>
engaging plate, at a plurality of points by engaging the<br>
engagers with receivers of a speaker frame, through<br>
engaging the engaging pieces passed fixing holes of the<br>
plate and elastically restored, at least one of the fixing<br>
points being arranged close to a lower end of the speaker<br>
frame, whereby a water intruding between the speaker frame<br>
and the plate is to be drained outward of the plate<br>
through an internal space of the fixture close to the<br>
lower end. The fixing point is taken, say, one or a<br>
plurality of points nearby the lower end immediately<br><br>
beneath the center of a circular frame.<br>
Meanwhile, a speaker in the invention is<br>
characterized by being removably provided with fixtures,<br>
having an engager on one side of an engaging plate and an<br>
engager formed with an engaging piece on other side of the<br>
engaging plate, at a plurality of points by engaging the<br>
engagers with receivers of a speaker frame, the engaging<br>
piece being deformed inward as inserted in a fixing hole<br>
of the plate and elastically restored after passed the<br>
fixing hole, to clamp the plate and an adapter or the<br>
plate by means of the elastically restored engaging piece<br>
and the engaging plate or the speaker frame. The fixture<br>
is suitably secured to speaker frame by tightening a screw<br>
in a screw hole formed in the engager.<br>
In the speaker attaching construction and speaker of<br>
the invention, there are provided, on a speaker, fixtures<br>
having engaging pieces to elastically deform and restore.<br>
With the utilization of an elastic deformation and<br>
restoration of the engaging pieces, the speaker can be<br>
fixed by merely inserting the engaging pieces in fixing<br>
holes of the plate. Thus, the speaker can be easily fixed.<br>
For example, fixing operation is easy even in a narrow<br>
space, e.g. attaching a speaker to an automotive doorplate.<br>
Furthermore, fixing is made by clamping the plate,<br>
etc. by the engaging pieces, engaging plates, etc. of<br><br>
fixtures provided at a plurality of points, wherein fixing<br>
is made when the engaging pieces are elastically restored.<br>
This eliminates the application, to the frame, of a stress<br>
resulting from an elastic force. Thus, the speaker can be<br>
stably set up wherein durability is improved in the frame<br>
and fixing parts.<br>
Meanwhile, by removably providing fixtures, e.g. By<br>
preparing a plurality of kinds of fixtures, handling is<br>
possible even in the case wherein the fixing hole is<br>
different in form or size. Furthermore, by suitably using<br>
fixtures that are different in the dimension of between the<br>
engaging plate and the engaging piece for example, it is<br>
easy to cope with a plate having a different thickness,<br>
thus providing excellent versatility.<br>
Meanwhile, by arranging at least one of fixing points<br>
of fixtures in a position near the lower end of the speaker<br>
frame, the water intruding between the speaker frame and<br>
the plate can be drained outward of the plate through an<br>
internal space of the fixture nearby the lower end. This<br>
can enhance the effects of water-draining and<br>
waterproofing, e.g. prevent water from intruding in a<br>
vehicular compartment.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Based on Figs. 1 to 4, explanation is made on an<br>
embodiment of a speaker attaching construction in the<br>
present invention.<br>
A speaker 1 in this embodiment has a vibration plate<br>
3, in a cone form having a resilient hook (edge) at<br>
generally an upper end thereof, fixed inner of a metal<br>
frame 2 in generally a circumferential form, as shown in<br>
Figs. 1 to 3. The frame 2 has an upper plate 2a having an<br>
upper surface bonded, by abutment, with a lower surface of<br><br>
a top plate 3a of the vibration plate 3. Incidentally,<br>
although not shown, an adapter generally circumferential<br>
in form, such as a urethane cushion, is provided by<br>
adhesion on the upper surface of the top plate 3a of the<br>
vibration plate 3 provided on the upper plate 2a of the<br>
frame 2.<br>
The frame 2 has a lower plate 2b provided with a<br>
thick-walled step 2d in an inner portion thereof. The<br>
step 2d is formed with an insert-hole 2e for a screw 5.<br>
In nearly a center of the insert-hole 2e, there is formed<br>
a first receiver 2f that is a hole square in cross-section<br>
wherein the square has a width/depth length greater than a<br>
diameter of the insert-hole 2e. In a lower end of the<br>
insertion-hole 2e, there is recessed a second receiver 2g<br>
that is square in form greater in width/depth length than<br>
the square of the first receiver 2f. Furthermore, a<br>
cutout is formed along an outer peripheral edge in the<br>
lower plate 2b of the frame 2 in a lower-surface outer<br>
portion thereof. In the cutout, a circumferential,<br>
waterproofing seal material 7 is arranged along the outer<br>
peripheral edge. Incidentally, the seal material 7 has a<br>
function as an anti-resonant plate for a plate 4.<br>
Meanwhile, because the insert-hole 2e and the receivers 2f,<br>
2g are provided inner of the seal material 7 in the outer<br>
peripheral edge, water can be prevented from intruding to<br><br>
the outer of the speaker through those points.<br>
The lower plate 2b of the frame 2, at its underside,<br>
is arranged abutting against the upper surface of the<br>
plate 4. The frame 2 and the plate 4 are arranged such<br>
that the insert-hole 2e, first and second receivers 2f, 2g<br>
of the frame 2 corresponds in position to a fixing hole 4c<br>
of the plate 4. The first receiver 2f is formed in such a<br>
shape and size that an engager 8b of a fixture 8, referred<br>
to later, while the second receiver 2g is formed in such a<br>
shape and size that is to engage an engaging plate 8a of<br>
the fixture 8, referred to later.<br>
Meanwhile, the fixture 8, formed of resin, such as<br>
ABS resin or nylon resin, has a rectangular-parallelepiped<br>
engager 8b in a position above the sguare engaging plate<br>
8a, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4.  Inside the engager 8b,<br>
there is vertically formed a screw hole 8c in which is to<br>
be screwed a thread 5a of the screw 5, e.g. a tapping<br>
screw.  Below the engaging plate 8a, there is vertically<br>
formed a hollow 8e rectangular in cross-section at an<br>
inside of the engager 8d.  In both sides of the engager 8d,<br>
square cutouts 8g are respectively formed extending from<br>
the  engaging  plate  8a  to  lower-end  bridges  8f.<br>
Furthermore, in the upper ends of the both bridges 8f,<br>
there are respectively formed fan-like engaging pieces 8h<br>
in a manner spreading laterally in an upward direction.<br><br>
The engaging piece 8h, arranged in the cutout 8g as viewed<br>
from side, has a slant 8i that is slanted in a manner<br>
spreading upwardly, a slant 8j that is slanted in a manner<br>
reducing upwardly, and a top end face 8k extending<br>
horizontally from a top end of the slant 8j.<br>
The engager 8b of the fixture 8 is inserted and<br>
engaged in the first receiver 2f of the frame 2 while the<br>
engaging plate 8a of the fixture 8 is inserted and engaged<br>
in the second receiver 2g. The screw 5, to be inserted<br>
into the insert-hole 2e from the top surface of the step<br>
2d, at its thread 5a, is screwed to the screw hole 8c of<br>
the fixture 8. By tightening the screw 5, the frame 2 and<br>
the fixture 8 are secured in the engagement state.<br>
Furthermore, the fixture 8 at its engager 8d is externally<br>
inserted in the fixing hole 4c of the plate 4. The plate<br>
4 is fit between the underside of an engaging plate 8a<br>
peripheral protrusion and the upper end face 8k of the<br>
engaging piece 8h. The fixture 8 is engaged with and<br>
fixed on the plate 4.<br>
The speaker 1 is rendered in a state that the<br>
fixture 8 is previously integrated with the frame 2 by<br>
screwing with a screw 5, as shown in Fig. 1. When fixing<br>
the speaker 1 to the plate 4, fixtures 8 are arranged in<br>
positions of fixing holes 4c in the plate 4. While the<br>
speaker 1 at its lower portion is inserted in the mount<br><br>
hole 4d of the plate 4, the engagers 8d at their tips are<br>
inserted in the fixing holes 4c. The fixing hole 4c is<br>
circular, to have a diameter formed nearly equal to or<br>
somewhat smaller than the outer diameter of a circular<br>
region of the engager 8d. As the insertion proceeds, the<br>
wing-like engaging piece 8h at its slant 8i goes into<br>
abutment against an outer edge of the fixing hole 4c. By<br>
the outer edge of the fixing hole 4c, the outward<br>
protrusion of the engaging piece 8h is pushed in the<br>
hollow 8e and hence the engaging piece 8h is deformed<br>
elastically.<br>
Thereafter, when the slant 8i at its outer end<br>
passes the fixing hole 4c, the engaging piece 8h goes into<br>
elastic restoration. By the elastic force of the engaging<br>
piece 8h, the engaging piece 8h passes the inner side of<br>
the fixing hole 4c while putting the slant 8j along the<br>
outer edge of the fixing hole 4c. When completely passed<br>
at the inner, the engaging piece 8h is elastically<br>
restored completely. Simultaneously, the plate 4 is<br>
fixedly clamped between the upper end face 8k of the<br>
engaging piece 8h and the underside of the engaging plate<br>
8a. Thus, the fixtures 8 and the speaker 1 fixed with the<br>
fixtures 8 are engaged and stably fixed on the plate 4.<br>
The dimension, between the upper end face 8k of the<br>
engaging piece 8h and the underside of the engaging plate<br><br>
8a, is provided, say, correspondingly to a thickness of<br>
the plate 4. The plate 4 even different in thickness can<br>
be easily coped with by using fixtures 8 that the<br>
dimension of between the upper end face 8k of the engaging<br>
piece 8h and the underside of the engaging plate 8a<br>
corresponds to the thickness of the plate 4. Meanwhile,<br>
in the state the speaker 1 is attached, the engaging<br>
pieces 8h are elastically restored by the fixtures 8<br>
provided in a plurality of points. The frame 2 and the<br>
fixtures 8 are free from the stresses imposed by an<br>
elastic force.<br>
Thereafter, in the case of removing the speaker 1<br>
out of the plate 4, the screws 5 are loosened and removed<br>
to withdraw the frame 2 out of the inserted fixtures 8<br>
thus removing the speaker 1. The fixtures 8 in a state<br>
left on the plate 4 can be removed by inserting the hand<br>
through the mount hole 4d and pushing toward the front<br>
while pushing the engaging pieces 8h at the both sides<br>
into the hollow 8e. Accordingly, removal operation is<br>
easy to perform. By inserting the removed fixtures 8<br>
again in the frame 2, the speaker 1 can be easily fixed<br>
again on the plate 4.<br>
Next, explanation is made on a speaker attaching<br>
construction in another embodiment, based on Fig. 5.<br>
Incidentally, the structure not especially referred to in<br><br>
this embodiment is basically similar to the speaker 1 in<br>
the embodiment and the construction of attaching the same.<br>
In the speaker 1 of this embodiment, there is<br>
internally provided a cone-formed vibration plate 3, not<br>
shown, in a generally circumferential frame 2 wherein, in<br>
an insert-hole 2e in a step 2d of a frame 2, there is<br>
formed a first receiver 2f that is a hole square in cross-<br>
section having a square width/depth length greater than a<br>
diameter of the insert-hole 2e. Furthermore, on the<br>
underside of a lower plate 2b of the frame 2, there is<br>
secured a fixed plate 2h in a plate-circumferential form.<br>
In a corresponding point of the fixed plate 2h to the<br>
insert-hole 2e, there is formed a square hole greater in<br>
length than the square of the first receiver 2f. The hole<br>
is provided as a second receiver 2g. Along the periphery<br>
of and on the outer surface of the fixed plate 2h, there<br>
is firmly fixed an adapter 9 in a plate-circumferential<br>
form, e.g. urethane sponge cushion having a waterproofing<br>
and vibration-preventing function.<br>
Meanwhile, the fixture in this embodiment is formed<br>
longer in the distance between the underside or outer<br>
surface of the engaging plate 8a and the upper end face 8k<br>
'. of the engaging piece 8h, than the fixture 8. The<br>
engaging plate 8a is inserted in and engaged with the<br>
second receiver 2g of the fixed plate 2h while the engager<br><br>
8b is inserted in and engaged with the first receiver 2f<br>
of the frame 2. The screw 5, to be inserted in the<br>
insert-hole 2e, at its thread 5a is screwed to the screw<br>
hole 8c of the fixture 8. By tightening the screws 5, the<br>
frame 2 and the fixtures 8 are firmly fixed in the<br>
engagement state.<br>
The attaching construction in Fig. 5 provides a<br>
correspondence between the second receiver 2g, first<br>
receiver 2f and insert-hole 2e of the fixed plate 2h and<br>
the mount hole 40a of the vehicular door panel 40. By<br>
abutting the outer surface of the adapter 9 against the<br>
door panel 40, the frame 2 is arranged. By inserting the<br>
engager 8d of the fixture 8 in the mount hole 40a of the<br>
door panel 40 in a direction of from the inner to outer,<br>
the fixture 8 is engaged in the door panel 40 due to an<br>
elastic deformation and restoration of the engaging piece<br>
8h similarly to the foregoing embodiment, thereby<br>
arranging the speaker 1 facing the inward of the door<br>
panel 40. In this embodiment, there is formed a space<br>
between the outer surface of the fixed plate 2h and the<br>
door panel 40 in the attaching state, providing a<br>
circumference hermetically closed by the interposing<br>
adapter 9.<br>
Furthermore, of among the three fixing points (see<br>
Figs. 1 and 2) in the frame 2 and door panel 40 due to the<br><br>
fixtures 8, the fixing point with the Fig. 5 fixture 8 is<br>
provided in a position close to the lowermost end lying<br>
immediately below a circular center, in front view, of the<br>
speaker 1. With the structure, the water at around the<br>
speaker 1 or the water on the speaker 1 can be drained to<br>
the outside of the door panel 40 through the fixture 8<br>
hollow 8e or the like, as shown by the two-dot-chain line<br>
in the figure. Thus, it is possible to prevent or<br>
suppress the gathering of an adapter 9 water lying in a<br>
position between the door panel 40 and the fixing plate 2h<br>
at an outer of the fixture 8. With the excellent draining<br>
function of the fixture 8 and the waterproofing function<br>
of the adapter 9, water is prevented from intruding in a<br>
vehicle compartment thus providing a high waterproofing<br>
effect.<br>

the invention is suitable if used, say, where a speaker is<br>
fixed on a speaker-mounting plate to be provided in an<br>
automobile. Besides, it can be used where a speaker is<br>
fixed on a plate to. be provided in a proper location.<br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	A speaker having an attaching construction for<br>
mounting the speaker (1) on a plate (40), said speaker (1)<br>
comprising removable fixtures (8) each having a first<br>
engaging member (8b) on one side of an engaging plate (8a)<br>
and a second engaging member (8d) formed with an engaging<br>
piece (8h) on the other side of the engaging plate (8a), a<br>
speaker frame (2) having receivers (2f, 2g) at a plurality<br>
of fixing points, wherein the first engaging members(8b)<br>
are in engagement with the receivers (2f, 2g) and wherein<br>
the engaging pieces (8h) are adapted to pass through fixing<br>
holes (40a) of the plate (40) and to be elastically<br>
restored, wherein at least one of the fixing points is<br>
arranged in a lower position of the speaker frame (2) ,<br>
characterized in that the fixture (8) located at the lower<br>
position comprises an internal space (8e), whereby water<br>
intruding between the speaker frame (2) and the plate (40)<br>
is drained outward of the plate (40) through said internal<br>
space (8e) of the fixture (8) at the lower position.<br>
2.	A speaker as claimed in claim 1, wherein the fixture<br>
(8) is secured on the speaker frame (2) by tightening a<br>
screw in a screw hole formed in the first engaging member<br>
(8b).<br><br>
3. A speaker as claimed in claim 1, wherein the second<br>
engaging member (8d) is hollow.<br><br>
A speaker attaching construction wherein speakers (I) are removably installed in a plurality of places in such a<br>
manner that a fastener (8) having an engaging section (8b) provided on one surface side of a locking plate (8a) and having a locking<br>
section (8d). which is formed with a locking piece (8h), provided on the other surface side of the locking plate (8a) has its engaging<br>
section (8b) inserted in an engagement receiving section (2f) of a frame (2) and each speaker (1) is attached to an attaching plate<br>
(4) by clamping the attaching plate (4) by the locking piece (8h) passed through an attaching hole (4c) in the attaching plate (4) and<br>
elaslically restored and by the locking plate (8a), thus making it possible to facilitate the attaching operation and to stably install a<br>
speaker without the possibility of stresses due to the elastic force being loaded on the frame.</td>
