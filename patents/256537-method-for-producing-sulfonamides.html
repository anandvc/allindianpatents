Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing sulfonamides I<br><br>
where the variables are each defined as follows:<br>
R1, R2, R3 and R4 are each hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C6-<br>
haioalkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy or C1-C6-haloalkoxy;<br>
R5 and R6 are hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyl, C3-C6-alkenyl, C3-C6-alkynyl, C3-C7-cycloalkyl,<br>
C3-C7-cycloalkenyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, phenyl or benzyl.<br>
In the prior art, for example in WO 01/83459, a process is described for preparing<br>
heterocyclyl-substituted phenylsulfamoylcarboxamides by the reaction of benzoic acid<br>
derivatives with sulfamides in the presence if appropriate of a coupling reagent.<br>
Moreover it is known for example from WO 04/39768 that N-aroylsulfonamides can be<br>
prepared by the reaction of corresponding benzoic acid derivatives with sulfonic<br>
diamides under the influence of base, by initially introducing sulfonic diamides and the<br>
base and then adding the benzoic acid derivative.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a simple, economically viable and<br>
implementabie process for preparing sulfonamides I, which firstly distinctly reduces<br>
byproduct formation and simultaneously can achieve high ylelds and high purity of<br>
product of value.<br>
 We have found that, surprisingly, this object is achieved by a process in which m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides II are reacted with amino sulfones III under the influence of 1.5 to 3 equivalents of base IV based on the amino sulfone III, which comprises, in<br>
step a), reacting the amino sulfone III with 0.1 -1.3 equivalents of base IV, and, in step<br>
b), reacting the reaction mixture resulting from step a) with m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides II<br>
and the remaining portion of base IV.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for preparing sulfonamides I<br><br>
  I, <br>
where the variables are each defined as follows:<br>
R1, R2, R3 and R4 are each hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, C1-C6-alkyl,<br>
C1-C6-haloalkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy or C1-C6-haloalkoxy;<br><br>
R5 and R6 are each hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyl, C3-C6-alkenyl, C3-C6-alkynyl,<br>
C3-C7-cycloalkyl, C3-C7-cycloalkenyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, phenyl or<br>
benzyl;<br>
by reacting m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides II<br><br>
where the variables R1, R2, R3 and R4 are each as defined above:<br>
with amino sulfones III<br>
H2N-SO2NR5R6 III,	<br>
where the variables R5 and R6 are each as defined above;<br>
under the influence of B equivalents of base IV, wherein, in step a), the amino<br>
sulfone III is reacted with B1 equivalents of base IV, and, in step b), the reaction<br>
mixture resulting from step a) is reacted with m-nitrobenzoyl chloride !! and B2<br>
equivalents of base IV;<br>
where	B is 1.5 - 3 equivalents of base IV with respect to the amino sulfone III;<br>
B1 is a subportion of B and is in the range from 0.1-1.3 equivalents of<br>
base IV with respect to the amino sulfone III; and<br>
B2 is a subportion of B and is the difference between B and B1.<br>
Depending on the substitution pattern, the sulfonamides I prepared by the process<br>
according to the invention may comprise one or more centers of chirality and are then<br>
present in the form of an enantiomeric or diastereomeric mixtures. The invention thus<br>
provides a process for preparing either the pure enantiomers or diastereomers, or their<br>
mixtures.<br><br>
The organic molecular moieties specified for the substituents R1, to R6 and Ra, Rb and<br>
Rc constitute collective terms for individual lists of the individual group members. All<br>
hydrocarbon chains, i.e. all alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy and haloalkoxy moieties, may be<br>
straight-chain or branched.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, halogenated substituents preferably bear from one to five<br>
identical or different halogen atoms. The term halogen in each case represents<br>
fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>

If the organic phase used is a water-miscible solvent, the reaction can also be carried<br>

In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, the multiphase<br>

When a multiphase system is used, it is possible, for example, to initially charge<br>

the phase transfer catalyst without additional solvent or in one of the aforementioned<br>
organic solvents or solvent mixtures.<br>
Thereafter, the aqueous solution of the base amount B2 and the reaction mixture<br>
resulting from step a) are added either successively or simultaneously with mixing and<br>
then the reaction is brought to completion within the desired temperature range.<br>
When a multiphase system is used in step a) of the process according to the invention,<br>
the amino sulfone III is preferably introduced in an inert solvent. Subsequently<br>
B1 equivalents of base IV, i.e., 0.1-1.3 equivalents, preferably 0.1-1 equivalent, very<br>

general the solvent used is removed by customary methods, distillatively for example.<br>
The crude product can then be taken up in a non-water-miscible organic solvent, any<br>
impurities extracted with unacidified or acidified water, and the system can then be<br>
dried and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. For further purification it is<br>
possible to employ the typical methods such as crystallization, precipitation (for<br>

the skilled worker, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid or phosphoric<br>
acid, for example.<br>
The reaction mixture can then be worked up by the methods customary therefor. In<br>
general, the phases are separated and the solvent used will be removed by customary<br>
processes, for example by distillation. For further purification, the customary processes<br>
such as for example crystallization (for example also by addition of a nonpolar solvent<br><br>
such as pentane, cyclohexane, heptane or toluene, or mixtures of the solvents<br>
mentioned) can be employed.<br>
When a biphasic system is used, workup will generally be effected by extraction.<br>
In a further preferred variant of the reaction in the process according to the invention,<br>
the dilute reaction mixture resulting from step c) is heated in a step d) and the phase<br>
separation is carried out at this temperature. This version of the process according to<br>
the invention is preferred primarily in those cases where step c) does not produce a<br>
clear solution.<br>
Preferably the dilute reaction mixture obtained in step c) is heated to a temperature a<br>
short way beneath the boiling point and the phase separation is carried out at that<br>
temperature. Subsequently the product of value can be recovered by typical methods,<br>
such as removal of the solvent and, if appropriate, subsequent crystallization, for<br>
example.<br>
Furthermore, the organic phase resulting from step d) can be subjected if necessary<br>
again to a step c) and, if appropriate, step d), it being possible for the repetition of<br>
steps c) and d) to take place as often as desired, preferably once.<br>
The amino sulfones III required for the preparation of the sulfonamides I are known in<br>
the literature (Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of organic<br>
chemistry] Vol. E11, 1985, p. 1019; Hamprecht etal., Angew. Chem. 93, 151, 1981) or<br>
can be prepared in accordance with the literature cited.<br>
The m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides II required for the preparation of the sulfonamides I are<br>
known from the literature and can be prepared, for example, by reacting m-nitrobenzoic<br>
acids VII<br><br>
where the variables are each defined as follows:<br>
R1, R2, R3, R4 are each hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, C1-C6-alkyl,<br>
C1-C6-haloalkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy or C1-C6-haloalkoxy;<br>
with chlorinating agents.<br>
The present invention accordingly further provides a process for preparing<br>
sulfonamides I wherein the m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides II required for the purpose are<br>
prepared from m-nitrobenzoic acids VII and chlorinating agents.<br><br>
In particularly preferred embodiments of the process according to the invention the<br>
variables R1, R2, R3 and R4 of the m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides II have the definitions stated<br>
above in connection with the sulfonamides I, more particularly the definitions stated<br>
there as being preferred, and, both considered alone and considered in combination<br>
with one another, they represent particular embodiments of the process according to<br>
the invention.<br>
The preferred embodiments of the reaction of m-nitrobenzoic acids VII with chlorinating<br>
agents are subject to the conditions stated below in connection with the reaction of<br>
fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic acids VIIA with chlorinating agents in the presence of<br>
catalytic amounts of a phosphine derivative IX, more particularly the embodiments<br>
specified there as being preferred.<br>
The prior art (for example WO 89/02891, WO 04/106324, WO 04/035545 and<br>
US 6,251,829) describes in particular processes for preparing fluorinated benzoyl<br>
chlorides from fluorinated benzoic acids. However, the problem of eliminating the<br>
fluorine substituent occurs in the processes described in the prior art, in particular when<br>
catalysts such as N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or nitrogen bases such as<br>
pyridine, picoline or lutidine are used.<br>
The fluoride released in turn has a damaging effect on the apparatus technology<br>
("fluoride corrosion") and therefore entails correspondingly costly apparatus made of<br>
higher-value materials. Moreover, the elimination of the fluoride leads to<br>
contaminations or secondary components in the product of value.<br>
However, when the process is carried out without catalyst, the ylelds are distinctly<br>
lower or higher reaction temperatures are required.<br>
It is thus a further object of the present invention to provide a simple, economically<br>
viable and implementable process for preparing fluorinated m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides<br>
IIA, which firstly distinctly reduces fluoride elimination and simultaneously can achieve<br>
high ylelds and high purity of product of value.<br>
We have found that, surprisingly, this object is achieved by a process in which<br>
fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic acids VII are reacted with chlorinating agents, which<br>
comprises effecting the reaction in the presence of catalytic amounts of a phosphine<br>
derivative IX and, if appropriate, in the presence of a Lewis acid.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further relates to a process for preparing fluorinated<br>
m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides IIA<br><br><br>
where the variables are each defined as follows:<br>
R1, R2, R3 and R4 are each hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, C1-C6-alkyl, C1-<br>
C6-haloalkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy or C1-C6-haloalkoxy;<br>
where at least one of the R1, to R4 radicals is fluorine,<br>
by reacting fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic acids VIIA<br><br>
where the variables are each defined as follows:<br>
R1, R2, R3, R4 are each hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C6-<br>
haloalkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy or C1-C6-haloalkoxy;<br>
where at least one of the R1, to R4 radicals is fluorine,<br>
with chlorinating agents,<br>
which comprises effecting the reaction in the presence of catalytic amounts of a<br>
phosphine derivative IX<br><br>
where the variables are each defined as follows:<br>
Ra, Rb, Rc are each C1-C6-alkyl or phenyl, which may optionally be substituted<br>
by C1-C4-alkyl;<br>
X is oxygen or two single-bonded chlorine atoms;<br>
n is 0 or 1.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for preparing fluorinated sulfonamides IA (i.e.<br>
sulfonamides I where at least one of the radicals R1, to R4 is fluorine) wherein the<br>
fluorinated m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides IIA required for the purpose are prepared by the<br><br>
process stated above from fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic acids VII.<br>
Specified below are the preferred embodiments of the reaction of fluorinated<br>
m-nitrobenzoic acids VIIA with chlorinating agents in the presence of catalytic<br>
amounts of a phosphine derivative IX, with these embodiments, both considered alone<br>
and considered in combination with one another, representing special embodiments of<br>
the process according to the invention.<br>
This process according to the invention for preparing fluorinated m-nitrobenzoyl<br>
chlorides IIA comprises the reaction of fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic acids VIIA with<br>

be in the range from 500 mbar to 10 bar. Preference is given to carrylng out the<br>
reaction in the region of standard pressure, i.e: in the range from 0.9 to 1.2 bar.<br>
The reaction time required for the reaction is generally in the range from 1 h to 24 h, in<br>
particular in the range from 2 h to 8 h.<br>
The process according to the invention can in principle be carried out in substance.<br>
However, preference is given to carrylng out the process according to the invention in<br>

In principle, all solvents which are capable of dissolving the fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic<br>
acids VIIA, the chlorinating agent and the phosphine derivative III at least partly and<br>

edition 2004, p. 496-499).<br>
Preferred chlorinating agents are oxalyl chloride, phosphorus trichloride,<br>

chloride is very preferred.<br>
The fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic acids VIIA and the chlorinating agent are generally<br>
reacted with one another in equimolar amounts. It may be advantageous to use the<br>
chlorinating agent in an excess based on the m-nitrobenzbic acids VIIA. Preference<br>
is given to using the chlorinating agent and the fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic acids<br>
VIIA in a ratio of 2:1, more preferably 1.5:1.<br>
The catalysts used are phosphine derivatives IX<br><br>
where the variables are each defined as follows:<br>
Ra, Rb, Rc	are each C1-C6-aIkyl or phenyl, which may optionally be<br>
substituted by C1-C4-alkyl;<br>
X is oxygen or two'single-bonded chlorine atoms;<br>
n is 0 or 1.<br>
Preference is given to using triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO),<br>
triphenyldichlorophosphine, tri(C1-C6-a[kyl)phosphine, tri(C1-C6-alkyl)phosphine oxide<br>
and tri(C1-C6-alkyl)dichlorophosphine;<br>
more preferably triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine oxide and tri(C1-C6-<br>
aIkyl)phosphine oxide;<br>
exceptionally preferably triphenylphosphine oxide.<br><br>
The phosphine derivative IX is used generally in amounts of from 0.01 to 5 mol%,<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 1 mol%, more preferably from 0.1 to 0.5 mol%, based on the<br>
amount of fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic acid VII used.<br>
Moreover, the process according to the invention may additionally be carried out in the<br>
presence of Lewis acids. The Lewis acids used are customary Lewis acids (cf., for<br>
example, Lewis Acids in Organic Synthesis, ed. H. Yamamoto, Vol. 1 and 2, Weinheim<br>
2000).<br>
Suitable Lewis acids are in particular boron compounds such as<br>
boron halides (e.g. BF3, BCI3, BF3 etherate), boric acid (H3BO3), boric anhydride, boric<br>
esters (e.g. tri-C1-C4-aIkyl borate), borate (e.g. sodium borate/borax),<br>
boronic acids (e.g. C1-C6-alkylboronic acids, arylboronic acids, especially<br>
phenylboronic acid), C1-C4-alkyl boronates (e.g. C1-C6-alkyl C1-C4-alkyl boronates,<br>
C1-C4-alkyl aryl boronates), cyclic boric esters (e.g. tris(C1-C4-alkoxy)boroxin, especially<br>
trimethoxyboroxin, and triethanolamine borate).<br>
Particular preference is given to boric acid, tri-C1-C4-alkyl borates or cyclic boric esters.<br>
The Lewis acid is used generally in amounts of from 0.01 to 5 mol%, preferably from<br>
0.1 to 1 mol%, based on the amount of m-nitrobenzoic acid II used.<br>
The process can be carried out either continuously or discontinuously (batchwise or<br>
semibatchwise).<br>
In the process according to the invention, the reactants and reagents can in principle<br>
be combined in any sequence, i.e. the reactants and the phosphine derivative IX and, if<br>
appropriate, the Lewis acid may be introduced separately, simultaneously or<br>
successively into the reaction vessel and reacted.<br>
Advantageously, the fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic acid VIIA and the phosphine<br>
derivative IX and, if appropriate, the Lewis acid are initially charged in an inert solvent<br>
and the chlorinating agent is added with mixing, for example stirring.<br>
However, it is also possible to initially charge the chlorinating agent together with<br>
the phosphine derivative IX and, if appropriate, the Lewis acid, and then to add the<br>
fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic acid VIIA, preferably dissolved in an inert solvent.<br>
The reaction mixtures may be worked up in a customary manner, for example by<br>
distilling off the solvent and removing the excess chlorinating reagent.<br>
Some of the end products are obtained in the form of viscous oils which can be freed of<br>
volatile fractions or purified under reduced pressure and at moderately elevated<br>
temperature. When the intermediates and end products are obtained as solids, the<br>
purification can also be effected by recrystallization or digestion.<br><br>
Preference is given to not effecting any further purification after the reaction has ended.<br>
The fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic acids IIA required for the preparation of the fluorinated<br>
m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides VIIA are known in the literature or can be prepared by<br>
nitrating the corresponding benzoic acids or by nitrating the corresponding methyl<br>
benzoates and subsequently hydrolyzing (for example, R. Beckert et al., Organikum,<br>
22nd edition 2004, p. 358-361).<br>
The fluorinated m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides IIA obtainable by the process according to the<br>
invention may be used as starting materials for the preparation of sulfonamides IA<br>
which are themselves valuable intermediates for the synthesis of pharmacologically<br>
active compounds or crop protection compositions.<br>
The present invention therefore further provides a process for preparing sulfonamides<br>
IA starting from fluorinated m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides IA.<br>
Depending on the substitution pattern, the fluorinated m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides IIA may<br>
comprise one or more centers of chirality and are then present in the form of an<br>
enantiomeric or diastereomeric mixtures. The invention thus provides a process for<br>
preparing either the pure enantiomers or diastereomers, or their mixtures.<br>

corresponding benzotrichlorides X in the presence of a catalyst or in a weakly acidic<br>
medium.<br><br>
where the variables are each defined as follows:<br>
R1, R2, R3 and R4 are each hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, C1-C6-alkyl,<br>

The present invention accordingly relates additionally to a process for preparing<br>
sulfonamides I wherein the m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides II required for the purpose are<br>
prepared by hydrolyzing benzotrichlorides X in the presence of a catalyst or in a weakly<br>
acidic medium.<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments of the process according to the invention the<br>
variables R1, R2, R3 and R4 of the m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides II have the definitions<br>
specified above in connection with the sulfonamides I,more particularly the definitions<br>
specified there as being preferred, which, considered both alone and in combination<br>
with one another, represent special embodiments of the process according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The preferred embodiments of the hydrolysis of corresponding benzotrichlorides X are<br>
subject to the conditions specified below in connection with the hydrolysis of fluorinated<br>
m-nitrobenzotrichlorides XA, more particularly the embodiments specified there as<br>
being preferred.<br>
In the prior art (e.g. O. Scherer et al., Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1964, 677, 83-95;<br>
WO 06/090210) processes are described for preparing aromatic acid chlorides from the<br>
corresponding benzoic acids. Under the reaction conditions described in the prior art,<br><br>
however, the problem occurs of the elimination of fluorine substituents located on the<br>
aromatic structure.<br>
The fluoride released has the disadvantages such as those already outlined above in<br>
connection with the preparation of benzoyl chlorides from the corresponding benzoic<br>
acids.<br>
Accordingly a further object of the present invention is to provide a process for<br>
preparing fluorinated m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides IIA by hydrolysis of corresponding<br>
fluorinated m-nitrobenzotrichlorides XA which significantly reduces the elimination of<br>
fluoride, it being possible at the same time to obtain high ylelds and a high purity of the<br>
product of value.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that this object is achieved by means of a process<br>
wherein fluorinated m-nitrobenzotrichlorides XA are hydroiyzed in the presence of a<br>
catalyst or in a weakly acidic medium at temperatures less than 80°C.<br>
The present invention accordingly further provides a process for preparing fluorinated<br>
m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides IIA<br><br>

C1-C6-haloalkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy or C1-C6-haloalkoxy;<br>
where at least one of the radicals R1, to R4 is fluorine,<br>
by hydrolyzing fluorinated m-nitrobenzotrichlorides XA<br><br>
where the variables R1, R2, R3 and R4 are each as defined above,<br>
wherein the reaction takes places in the presence of a catalyst or in a weakly<br>
acidic medium and also at temperatures less than 80°C.<br><br>
The present invention further provides a process for preparing fluorinated<br>

purpose are prepared by the above-specified process from fluorinated<br>
m-nitrobenzotrichlorides XA.<br>
The variables R1, R2, R3 and R4 have the definitions stated beforehand in connection<br>
with the fluorinated m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides IIA, more particularly the definitions stated<br>
beforehand as being preferred, at least one of the radicals R1, to R4 in the combination<br>
of all four radicals R1, to R4 being fluorine, and where these aforementioned definitions,<br>
considered both alone and in combination with one another, represent special<br>
embodiments of the process according to the invention.<br>
The preferred embodiments of the hydrolysis of the fluorinated m-nitrobenzo-<br>

m-nitrobenzotrichlorides IIA can also be carried out only in the presence of a suitable<br>
catalyst, without additional acid. This version of the reaction regime is preferred.<br>
The reaction mixtures are worked up by customary methods known to the skilled<br>
worker, such as by removing the solvent, for example. The catalyst can be removed by<br>
extraction methods known to the skilled worker, as for example by dissolving the<br>
reaction mixture in a suitable solvent, such as in aromatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene and chlorobenzene, preferably chlorobenzene, and then<br>
carrylng out extraction with aqueous mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric<br>
acid.<br>
Alternatively the reaction mixture obtained can also be supplied in the form of its melt<br>
directly to the next reaction stage, without further purification.<br>

sulfonamides I, more particularly fluorinated sulfonamides I A, wherein the<br>
m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides II required for the purpose, more particularly the fluorinated<br>
m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides IIA, are prepared by the aforementioned process from<br>
benzotrichlorides X and m-nitrobenzoic acids VII, more particularly from<br>
benzotrichlorides XA and fluorinated m-nitrobenzoic acids VIIA.<br>
Described below are the preferred embodiments of the reaction of the<br>
benzotrichlorides X and m-nitrobenzoic acids VII to form m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides II,<br>
and these embodiments, considered both alone and in combination with one another,<br>
represent special embodiments of the process according to the invention.<br>

typically at temperatures of 70°C to 160°C, preferably 70°C to 120°C, with particular<br>
preference 80°C to 110°C, if appropriate in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a<br>

The sulfonamides I and IA obtainable in accordance with the processes according to<br>
the invention can be used as starting materials for the preparation of aniline<br>
derivatives VI, which in turn are valuable intermediates for the synthesis of<br>
pharmacologically active compounds or crop protection agents.<br>
A further subject matter of the present invention, therefore, is the provision of a process<br>
for preparing aniline derivatives VI by reducing sulfonamides I prepared beforehand by<br>
the abovementioned processes according to the invention:<br><br><br>
In connection with the aniline derivatives VI the variables R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6<br>
have the definitions stated above in connection with the sulfonamides I, more<br>
particularly the definitions stated above as being preferred, and these aforementioned<br>
definitions, considered both alone and in combination with one another, represent<br>
special embodiments of the process according to the invention.<br>
The reduction of the sulfonamides I to aniline derivatives VI is accomplished, for<br>
exampie, using nascent hydrogen. For this purpose the nitro compound is reacted with<br>
an acid in the presence of a base metal. Base metals are of course those which are<br>
dissolved by a Bronsted acid with evolution of hydrogen. Metals of this kind generally<br>
have a standard potential 
in the range from -0.1 to -1.0 V (in acidic aqueous solution at 15°C and 1 bar).<br>
Examples of suitable metals are Zn, Fe and Sn, more particularly Fe. Acids<br>
contemplated for this purpose include not only inorganic mineral acids, examples being<br>
hydrochloric acid or dilute sulfuric acid, or mixtures of inorganic acid and one of the<br>
aforementioned solvents, gaseous HCI in an ether or an alcohol or a mixture thereof,<br>
for example, or organic carboxylic acids, appropriately acetic acid, propionic acid or<br>
butyric acid.<br>
The reaction conditions correspond substantially to the reaction conditions employed<br>
for the reduction of aliphatic or aromatic nitro groups to aliphatic or aromatic amino<br>
groups using nascent hydrogen (see, for example, H. Koopman, Rec. Trav. 80 (1961),<br>
1075).<br>
Depending on the nature of the metal and acid, the reaction temperature is situated<br>
generally in the range from -20 to +120°C, preference being given, when using<br>
alkanoic acids such as acetic acid, to using temperatures in the range from 50 to<br>
100°C. The reaction time can be from a few minutes to several hours, e.g. about<br>
20 minutes to 5 hours. Preferably the sulfonamide I for reduction is charged to the<br>
reaction vessel and then the respective metal, preferably in finely divided form, more<br>
particularly as a powder, is added to the reaction mixture with thorough mixing. The<br>
addition takes place preferably over a period of 10 minutes to 2 hours. It is of course<br>
also possible to introduce the metal and the acid initially and to add the sulfonamide I, if<br>
appropriate together with an inert solvent. Frequently the reaction mixture is left to<br>
afterreact at reaction temperature for a certain additional period, e.g. 10 minutes to<br><br>
4 hours.<br>
The reduction of I to VI is preferably conducted with iron powder in dilute acid. Suitable<br>
acids are mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid or organic acids such as formic acid,<br>
acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid. Preference is given to using acetic acid. The<br>
amount of iron powder is preferably 2 to 5 mol, more particularly 2.5 to 4 mol, per mole<br>
of the sulfonamide I. The amount of acid is generally not critical. Appropriately at least<br>
an equimolar amount of acid is used, based on the sulfonamide I, in order that<br>
reduction of the starting compound is as near complete as possible. The reaction can<br>
be carried out continuously or discontinuously. The reaction temperatures are in that<br>
case in the range from 50 to 100°C, preferably 65 to 75°C. In one embodiment, for<br>
example, the iron powder is introduced initially in acetic acid and then the sulfonamide I<br>
is introduced into the reaction vessel. The addition takes place preferably over the<br>
course of 20 to 60 minutes with the constituents being mixed, by stirring for example.<br>
After the end of the addition the reaction is allowed to continue for 0.5 to 2 hours more,<br>
preferably about 1 hour, at reaction temperature. Alternatively the iron powder can also<br>
be added with stirring to the mixture of the sulfonamide I in glacial acetic acid and the<br>
reaction can be completed as described above.<br>
The working-up for obtaining aniline derivative VI can take place by the methods that<br>
are customary for that purpose. Generally speaking the solvent will first be removed, by<br>
distillation, for example. For further purification it is possible to employ customary<br>
techniques such as crystallization, chromatography, on silica gel for example, stirring<br>
with a solvent, examples being aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene,<br>
xylene or aliphatic hydrocarbons such as petroleum ether, hexane, cyclohexane,<br>
pentane, carboxylic esters such as ethyl acetate, etc, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Also suitable as reducing agents, furthermore, are metal hydrides and semimetal<br>
hydrides such as aluminum hydride and hydrides derived therefrom such as lithium<br>
aluminum hydride, diisobutylaluminum hydride, boron hydrides such as diborane, and<br>
boronates derived therefrom, such as sodium borohydride or lithium boronate. For this<br>
purpose the sulfonamide I is contacted with the complex metal hydride in an inert<br>
solvent at 10 to 65°C, advantageously 20 to 50°C. The reaction time is preferably 2 to<br>
10 hours, and advantageously 3 to 6 hours. The reaction is preferably conducted in an<br>
organic solvent that is inert toward the reducing agent. Suitable solvents include -<br>
depending on the reducing agent selected - e.g. alcohols, examples being<br>
C1-C4 alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol or n-butanol, and<br>
mixtures thereof with water, or ethers such as diisopropyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether,<br>
ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In general 0.5 to 3, advantageously 0.75 to 2.5, mol of metal hydride, metal<br>
hemihydride, boron hydride and/or boronate is used per mole of sulfonamide I. The<br><br>
process follows the procedure described in Organikum, VEB Deutscher Verlag der<br>
Wissenschaften, Berlin 1976, 15th edition, pp. 612-616.<br>
A further suitable reducing agent for the conversion of the sulfonamide I into the aniline<br>
derivative VI is hydrogen in the presence of catalytic amounts of a transition metal<br>
catalyst, more particularly with transition metals from transition group 8. This reduction<br>
of the sulfonamides I to aniline derivatives VI with hydrogen is preferred.<br>
Outlined below are the preferred embodiments of this reduction, which, considered<br>
both alone and in combination with one another, represent special embodiments of the<br>
process according to the invention.<br>
The reaction takes place typically at temperatures of 0°C to 100°C, preferably at 10°C<br>
to 50°C, either solventlessly or in an inert solvent (cf. e.g. Tepko et al., J. Org. Chem.<br>
1980,45,4992).<br>
Depending on the solubility of the substrate for hydrogenation, suitable solvents are<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane and mixtures of<br>
C5-C8 alkanes;<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene;<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform and chlorobenzene;<br>
ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, dioxane, anisole<br>
and tetrahydrofuran;<br>
carboxylic esters such as ethyl acetate;<br>
nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile;<br>
ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone and tert-butyl methyl<br>
ketone;<br>
alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol and tert-<br>
butanol:<br>
and also dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide,<br>
carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, or aqueous solutions of organic acids such as<br>
acetic acid and water,<br>
with particular preference alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol,<br>
n-butanol and tert-butanol; aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, O-, m- and p-xylene<br>
and also chlorobenzene.<br>
It is also possible to use mixtures of the stated solvents. In addition it is also possible to<br>
operate without solvent.<br>
Preferred transition metal catalysts comprise a transition metal from the group Ni, Pd,<br>
Pt, Ru, Rh and Ir. Particular preference is given to palladium, platinum, ruthenium and<br>
iridium.<br><br>
The transition metal catalysts can be used as they are or in supported form. Preference<br>
is given to using supported catalysts. Examples of supports are activated carbon,<br>
alumina, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, carbonates and the like, preferably activated carbon.<br>
It is also possible to use transition metal catalysts doped with various transition group<br>
elements, e.g. copper, iron, nickel or vanadium, in various proportions.<br>
The transition metals can also be used in the form of activated metals such as Raney<br>
nickel or in the form of compounds.<br>
Furthermore, the transition metals can also be used in the form of compounds. Suitable<br>
transition metal compounds are, for example, palladium oxide and platinum oxide. Also<br>
suitable are noble metal sulfides such as platinum sulfide (cf. Houben-Weyl, Methoden<br>
der organischen Chemie, vol. IV/iC, pp. 520-526).<br>
The catalysts are used generally in an amount of 0.005 to 10 mol% (calculated as<br>
metal), preferably 0.001 to 10 moI%, more preferably 0.0055 to 2 mol%, with particular<br>
preference 0.005 to 0.5 mol%, based in each case on the sulfonamide I for reduction.<br>
The reduction can be carried out under standard hydrogen pressure or under elevated<br>
hydrogen pressure, with for example a hydrogen pressure of 0.01 to 50 bar, preferably<br>
0.1 to 40 bar, with particular preference from 1 to 20 bar, with especial preference 1 to<br>
16 bar.<br>
If appropriate the nitro compounds of the formula II are purified prior to the<br>
hydrogenation by means of extractive stirring with activated carbon or recrystallization<br>
from an organic solvent by addition of a second solvent, e.g. acetone/water.<br>
In the case of chlorinated sulfonamides I the hydrogenation is carried out - depending<br>
on the sensitivity of the substituent - preferably at 20 to 170°C, with particular<br>
preference at 20 to 140°C, with great preference at 20 to 80°C.<br>
In the case of sulfonamides I having reactive halogen substituents it is further advisable<br>
to carry out hydrogenation in neutral solution, where appropriate with oniy slightly<br>
elevated pressure, with small amounts of nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium,<br>
rhodium or else iridium catalysts. Noble metal sulfides such as platinum sulfide are also<br>
suitable.<br>
The reaction mixture is worked up after the catalyst has been separated off by known<br>
methods. Generally speaking, first the solvent is removed, by distillation for example.<br>
For further purification it is possible to employ typical techniques such as extraction,<br>
crystallization, chromatography (on silica gel, for example) or stirring with a solvent<br><br>
(aromatic hydrocarbons, for example, such as benzene, toluene or xylene, or aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons, for example, such as petroleum ether, hexane, cyclohexane, pentane,<br>
carboxylic esters such as ethyl acetate, etc, and mixtures thereof).<br>
The reduction of the sulfonamides I to aniline derivatives VI can also take place with<br>
sodium sulfide, advantageously in aqueous ammoniacal solution, in the presence of<br>
ammonium chloride. The reaction temperature is generally between 40 to 90°C,<br>
preferably between 60 to 80°C. It is judicious to use 3 to 4 mol of sodium sulfide<br>
per mole of sulfonamide I.<br>
The examples which follow serve to further illustrate the invention:<br>
1. Preparation of the fluorinated m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides IIA<br>
The ylelds of fluorinated m-nitrobenzoyl chloride IIA were, unless stated otherwise,<br>
determined by means of quantitative HPLC:<br>
Sample preparation:<br>
First, the fluorinated m-nitrobenzoyl chlorides IIA formed as the product were converted<br>
to the corresponding methyl esters. To this end, the samples of the fluorinated m-<br>
nitrobenzoyl chlorides IIA to be determined were weighed into a 100 ml standard flask<br>
which was made up to 100 ml with methanol. The mixture was left to stir at room<br>
temperature for a further 10 min.<br>
Chromatographic conditions:<br>
Column: symmetry C18 5 µm 250 x 4.6 mm from Waters®<br>
Wavelength: 222 nm<br>
Eluent: gradient of A (0.1% by volume of H3PO4 in H2O) and B (0.1% by volume of<br>
H3PO4 in CH3CN); 10 min 70% B, then B rising from 70% to 100% within<br>
15 min, then, back to 35% within 2 min, then 7 min 35% B.<br>
Flow rate: 1 ml/min<br>
Pressure: approx. 150 bar<br>
Calibration:<br>
The calibration was effected with external standard (corresponding methyl<br>
nitrobenzoate). To establish the standard, a total of 5 samples of the pure substances<br>
were weighed in the following concentrations (precision +/- 0.1 mg): approx. 0.1 g/l,<br>
approx. 0.2 g/l, approx. 0.3 g/l, approx. 0.4 g/l, approx. 0.5 g/l.<br>
With the aid of a suitable PC program, a calibration line was established. For the<br>
substances detailed above, this was a linear function. Standard deviation, correlation<br>
coefficient and straight-line equation were calculated.<br>
For each of the components, their concentration can thus be determined based on the<br><br>
particular external standard.<br>
The fluoride values were determined by means of the following test method:<br>
1 - 2 ml of the sample were extracted with 50 ml of demineralized water. After the<br>
aqueous phase had been removed, depending on the concentration expected, an<br>
aliquot part thereof was used for the measurement.<br>
The measurement was effected in a buffer solution (TISAB) at pH 5.26 by means of an<br>
ion-selective electrode (measurement concentration &gt; 1 mg/l of fluoride; detection limit<br>
The error limit is +/- 0.002 g/l.<br>
The following units were used:<br>
Ion-sensitive fluoride electrode	e.g. Metrohm 6.0502.150<br>
Reference electrode	e.g. Metrohm 6.0733.100<br>
Ion meter	e.g. Radiometer PHM 250<br>

18.5 g (0.1 mol) of 4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid and 0.1 g (0.00036 mol) of<br>
triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) were initially charged in chlorobenzene and the<br>
suspension was heated at 95°C with stirring. Subsequently, 16.8 g (0.14 mol) of thionyl<br>
chloride were added within 10 min. The reaction mixture was stirred at 105-110°C for a<br>
further 2 h.<br>
Subsequently, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and the<br>
fluoride content of the solution was determined, which was 0.01 g/l.<br>
Subsequently, the solvent and excess thionyl chloride were removed by distillation.<br>
After addition of chlorobenzene, 40.8 g (98% of theory; determined by means of<br>
19F-NMR with internal standard) of the title product were obtained as a solution in<br>
chlorobenzene.<br>

These experiments show that the process according to the invention distinctly reduces<br>
the fluoride elimination:<br>
When the process is carried out according to known reaction conditions without<br>
catalyst or with catalysts such as DMAP, DMF or pyridine, there is elimination of<br>
fluoride which leads to a fluoride concentration of from 0.02 to 0.26 g/l, whereas the<br>
fluoride concentration when the reaction takes place under the inventive conditions is<br>
only 0.01 g/l.<br>
Example 1.10<br>
A mixture of 475 g (1.6 mol) of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride and 1.5 g<br>
(9.1 mmol) of iron chloride was introduced and melted by heating to 75°C. Over the<br>
course of 2 h 29.2 g (1.6 mol) of water were metered in beneath the surface. In the<br>
course of the metered addition hydrogen chloride was produced, and was taken off via<br>
a suitable off-gas system. During the reaction the internal temperature rose slightly.<br>
After the end of the metered addition the system was stirred at 75°C for 3 h. Residues<br>
of hydrogen chloride were driven off by introduction of nitrogen. The warm melt was<br>
transferred with stirring to a vessel containing 367 g of chlorobenzene which had been<br>
conditioned at 10°C. After cooling to approximately 20°C, this organic phase was<br>
extracted once with 300 g of 32% aqueous hydrochloric acid. Phase separation gave<br>
732.0 g of a solution of 50.5% by weight (97% of theory) of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-<br>
nitrobenzoyl chloride in chlorobenzene. The free fluoride content of the organic phase<br>
was less than 0.01 g/1000 g (
* In these examples, the yleld was determined by means of 19F-NMR with internal standard.<br><br>
Example 1.11<br>
A mixture of 296 g (1 mol) of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride and 0.95 g<br>
(5.7 mmol) of iron chloride was introduced and melted by heating to 70°C. Over the<br>
course of 2 h 18.1 g (1 mol) of water were metered in beneath the surface. During the<br>
metered addition hydrogen chloride was formed, and was taken off via a suitable off-<br>
gas system. During the reaction there was a slight increase in the internal temperature.<br>
Toward the end of the metered addition a precipitate was formed which, at the end of<br>
the subsequent stirring time, had dissolved again. After the end of the metered<br>
addition, stirring was continued at 75°C for 3 h. Residues of hydrogen chloride were<br>
driven off by introduction of nitrogen. The warm melt was cooled and solidified. This<br>
gave 235 g of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoyl chloride with a purity of 97.5% (96% of<br>
theory).<br>
Example 1.12<br>

trichloride, 0.95 g (5.7 mmol) of iron chloride and 18.2 g (1 mol) of water were reacted<br>
at 80°C. This gave 238 g of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoyl chloride with a purity of<br>
97% (97% of theory).<br>
Example 1.13<br>
In the same way as in example 1.11, 296 g (1 mol) of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzo-<br>
trichloride, 0.5 g (3 mmol) of iron chloride and 18.2 g (1 mol) of water were reacted at<br>
120°C. After the end of the metered addition of the water, stirring was continued for<br>
30 minutes at 120-125°C. The system was subsequently cooled to 60°C. Residues of<br>
hydrogen chloride were driven off by introduction of nitrogen. The warm melt was<br>
cooled and solidified. This gave 236 g of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoyl chloride with<br>
a purity of 95% (95% of theory). The free fluoride content was 0.110 g/1000 g<br>
(110 ppm).<br>
Example 1.14<br>
A mixture of 148 g (0.5 mol) of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride and 0.5 g<br>
(3 mmol) of iron chloride was introduced and melted by heating to 85°C. Over the<br>
course of 1 h 111 g (1 mol) of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid in solid form were<br>
added. During the metered addition hydrogen chloride was formed, and was taken off<br>
via a suitable off-gas system. During the metered addition a precipitate formed. The<br>
temperature was raised to 120°C and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. In the course of<br>
this stirring period the precipitate dissolved again. Residues of hydrogen chloride were<br>
driven off by introduction of nitrogen. The warm melt was cooled and solidified. This<br>
gave 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoyl chloride with a purity of 95% (94% of theory).<br>

in 30 ml of toluene. The suspension was subsequently stirred at RT for 2 h. The<br>
mixture was acidified by means of addition of cone, hydrochloric acid and stirred for<br>
1 h. The solid was filtered off, washed once with 1N HCI solution and recrystallized<br>
from chlorobenzene. A final filtration and drylng under reduced pressure gave rise to<br>

0.75 g (12.0 mmol) of tributylmethylammonium chloride in 633 g of chlorobenzene was<br>
admixed at 20°C with 41.0 g (50% in water) of NaOH over the course of 60 min. The<br>
addition of a solution of 59.7 g (0.25 mol) of 2~chloro-4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoyl chloride<br>
and 62 g of chlorobenzene took place 15 min after the beginning of addition of the<br>

for 1 h and diluted by addition of 430 g of water. The aqueous phase was acidified to a<br>
pH of 1 using concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 320 g of cyclohexane were added.<br>
The mixture obtained was cooled to 0°C. The precipitate was isolated by filtration and<br>
dried at 70°C under reduced pressure. This gave 80.1 g (88% of theory) of N-(2-chloro-<br>
4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoyl)-N'-isopropyl-N'-methylsulfamide in a purity of 96%. The solid<br>
contained 2.2% of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoic acid (determination via quantitative<br>

admixed over the course of 60 min at 20°C with 43.7 g (50% in water) of NaOH. After<br>
the base had been added for 15 minutes, a parallel addition commenced of 64.0 g<br>
(0.26 mol) of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoyl chloride in 67 g of chlorobenzene. This<br>
addition took place over the course of 45 min. The reaction mixture was subsequently<br>
stirred at 20°C for 1 h and diluted by addition of 424 g of water and 138 g of isohexane.<br>
The aqueous phase was acidified to a pH of 5.5 using concentrated hydrochloric acid<br>
and then separated off at 68°C. The organic phase was extracted a second time with<br>
addition of 430 g of water and 60 g of isohexane, and the phases were separated at<br>
68°C. The resulting organic phase was admixed with a further 280 g of isohexane and<br>
then cooled to 0°C. Filtration, washing with water and drylng under reduced pressure at<br>
70°C gave 82.4 g (87% of theory, purity 96.5%) of N-(2-chloro-4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoyl)-<br>
N'-isopropyl-N'-methylsulfamide.<br>
Example 2.8:<br>

0.77 g (12.0 mmol) of tributylmethylammonium chloride in 637 g of chlorobenzene was<br>
admixed over the course of 60 min at 20°C with 43.7 g (50% in water) of NaOH. After<br>
the base had been added for 15 minutes, a parallel addition commenced of 65.0 g<br>
(0.26 mol) of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoyl chloride in 70 g of chlorobenzene. This<br>
addition took place over the course of 45 min. The reaction mixture was subsequently<br>
stirred at 20°C for 1 h and diluted by addition of 424 g of water and 138 g of isohexane.<br>
The aqueous phase was acidified to a pH of 4.5 using concentrated hydrochloric acid<br>
and then separated off at 68°C. The organic phase was extracted a second time with<br>
addition of 430 g of water and 60 g of isohexane, and the phases were separated at<br>
68°C. The resulting organic phase was admixed with a further 280 g of isohexane and<br>
then cooled to 0°C. Filtration, washing with water and drylng under reduced pressure at<br>
70°C gave 82.1 g (87% of theory, purity 97%) of N-(2-ch!oro-4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoyl)-<br>
N'~isopropyl=N'=methylsu!famide. !n the solid, HPLC analysis found no contamination<br>
with 2-chloro-4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoic acid.<br>
Example 2.9:<br>
A solution of 8.22 g (54.0 mmol) of N-methyl-N-(1-methylethyl)sulfamoylarnide in 25 g<br>
of water and 6.48 g (162.4 mmol) of NaOH was admixed with 1.74 g (5.40 mmol) of<br>
tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) and 10 g of chlorobenzene. Subsequently, at<br>
25°C, a solution of 10.49 g (48.6 mmol) of 4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoyl chloride and 25 g of<br>
chlorobenzene was added dropwise over 40 min. The two-phase reaction mixture was<br>
subsequently stirred at 25°C for 3 h. Following phase separation, the organic phase<br>
was dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent was removed under reduced<br>
pressure. This gave 4.56 g (46.2%) of N-(4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoyl)-N'-isopropyl-N'-<br>
methylsulfamide having an m.p. of 164-165°C.<br><br>
Example 2.10:<br>
A solution of 10.5 g (69.0 mmol) of N-methyl-N-(1-methylethyl)sulfamoylamide,<br>
190.0 mg (0.80 mmol) of tributylmethylammonium chloride in 160 g of chlorobenzene,<br>
and 0.86 g of water was admixed with 10.9 g (137.0 mmol, 50%) of NaOH.<br>
Subsequently at 20°C a solution of 15.8 g (66.0 mmol) of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-3-<br>
nitrobenzoyl chloride and 16 g of chlorobenzene was added dropwise in 65 min. The<br>
two-phase reaction mixture was subsequently stirred overnight at 20°C. The reaction<br>
mixture was diluted with 106 g of water and acidified to a pH of 1 with sulfuric acid<br>
(98% strength). Following phase separation, the organic phase was cooled to 0°C and<br>
filtered. The resulting solid was washed on the filter with dilute sulfuric acid (pH 1) and<br>
finally dried at 70°C under reduced pressure. This gave 9.3 g (37.3% of theory) of<br>
N-(2-chloro-4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoyl)-N'-isopropyl-N'-methylsulfamide. Additionally an<br>
organic phase was obtained that contained 6.08 g (24.4% of theory) of N-(2-chloro-4-<br>
fluoro-3-nitrobenzoyl)-N'-isopropyl-N'-methylsulfamide and also 3.29 g (22.5% of<br>
theory) of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoic acid (determination by quantitative HPLC in<br>
the same way as in ex. 2.3).<br>
3. Preparation of the aniline derivatives VI<br>
Example 3.1; N-(N-(4-Fluoro-3-aminobenzoyl)-N'-isopropyl-N'-methylsulfamide<br>
89.0	g (0.28 mol) of N-(4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoyl)-N'-isopropyl-N'-methylsulfamide in<br>
methanol were admixed with 5.9 g (10 mol%) of Pd/C and hydrogenated with 2-5 bar of<br>
hydrogen with stirring at 25-30°C- After 12 h the solution was depressurized, the<br>
reaction mixture was filtered and the solvent was removed by distillation. This gave<br>
80.0	g (98%) of the title compound in the form of a beige solid (m.p.: 148-150°C).<br>

(0.055 mol%) of 3% Pt/C and hydrogenated with 5 bar of hydrogen with stirring at<br>
70°C. After 12 h the solution was depressurized, the reaction mixture was filtered and<br>
the solvent was removed by distillation. This gave 4.7 g (64%) of the title compound in<br>
the form of a solid (m.p.: 147-149°C).<br>
Example 3.3: N-(N-(2-Chloro-4-fluoro-3-aminobenzoyl)-N'-isopropyl-N'-methylsulfamide<br>

of methanol were admixed with 0.19 g (0.15 mol%) of 10% Pd/C and hydrogenated<br>
with 5 bar of hydrogen with stirring at 70°C. After 10 h the solution was depressurized,<br>
the reaction mixture was filtered and the solvent was removed by distillation. This gave<br>
6.4 g (89%) of the title compound in the form of a solid (m.p.: 147-149°C).<br>
Example 3.4: N-(N-(2-Chloro-4-fluoro-3-aminobenzoyl)-N'-isopropyl-N'-methylsulfamide<br>
182.4 g (0.500 mol) of N-(2-chloro-4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoyl)-N'-isopropyl-N'-<br>

Pt-2%V/C and hydrogenated with 5 bar of hydrogen with stirring at 60°C. After 6 h the<br>
solution was depressurized, the reaction mixture was filtered and the solvent was<br>
removed by distillation. This gave 157.1 g (97%) of the title compound in the form of a<br>
solid (m.p.: 147-149°C).<br>
Example 3.5: N-(N-(2-Chloro-4-fluoro-3-aminobenzoyl)-N'-isopropyl-N'-methylsulfamide<br>
