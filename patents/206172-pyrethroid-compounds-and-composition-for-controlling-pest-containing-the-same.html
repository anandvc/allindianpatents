				<td>The present invention relates to a pyrethroid compound and a composition for controlling pest which contains said compound as an active ingredient.<br>
It has been known that some pyrethroid compounds containing an alcohol moiety derived from a certain fluorine-substituted benzyl alcohol exhibit an insecticidal activity (EP-A-54360). These compounds, however, are not always sufficient in practical pest-controlling effect as an active ingredient of compositions for controlling pest.<br>
In order to find a pyrethroid compound having a practically pest-controlling effect, the present inventors earnestly investigated and consequently found that 4-raethoxymethyl-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl 3-(2,-methyl-1-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate represented by the formula shown below has an excellent pest-controlling effect and is very effective particularly in preventing domestic epidemics, whereby the present invention has been accomplished.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to 4-methoxymethyl-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl 3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate (hereinafter referred to as the present compound) represented by the formula:<br><br>
-2-<br><br>
anci a composition for controlling pest which contains the present compound as an active ingredient.<br>
The present compound has stereoisomers relative to the asymmetric carbon atom on the cyclopropane ring and includes any active one of these stereoisomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
In the present compound,(1R)-isomer or (1R)-enriched isomers are preferable in view of the excellent pesticidal activity. Moreover, (1R)-trans-isomer or (1R)-trans-enriched isomers are particularly preferable for controlling pests for preventing domestic epidemics.<br>
The present compound can be produced, for example, by reacting an alcohol compound represented by the formula:<br><br><br>
-3-<br>
with a carboxylic acid compound represented by the<br>
formula:<br><br>
or a reactive derivative {e.g., acid halide or acid anhydride) of said carboxylic acid compound.<br>
The reaction is usually carried out in a solvent in the presence of a condensing agent or a base.<br>
The condensing agent includes, for example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-{3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride.<br>
The base includes, for example, organic bases such as triethylamine, pyridine, N,N-diethylaniline, 4-dimethylaminopyridine and diisopropylethylamine.<br>
The solvent includes, for example, hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and hexane; ethers such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; and halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and chlorobenzene.<br>
The reaction time ranges usually from 5 minutes to 72 hours.<br>
The reaction temperature ranges usually from<br><br>
-4-<br>
-20°C to + 100°C (or from -20°0 to the boiling point of the solvent in the case where the boiling point of the solvent is lower than +100°C), preferably from -5°C to + 100°C (or from -5°C to the boiling point of the solvent in the case where the boiling point of the solvent is lower than + 100°C) .<br>
Although the molar ratio of the alcohol<br>
compound to the carboxylic acid compound or its reactive derivative can be selected without any limitation, it is preferable to carry out the reaction by using them in an approximate molar ratio of 1:1.<br>
The condensing agent or the base can be used in any amount of usually 1 mole or more, preferably 1 mole to 5 moles, per mole of said alcohol compound. The condensing agent or the base is appropriately chosen depending on the kind of said carboxylic acid compound or its reactive derivative to be reacted.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the reaction solution is poured into water and then subjected to conventional work-up procedures such as extraction with an organic solvent, concentration and the like to obtain the present compound. Also, the present compound can be purified by operations such as chromatography, distillation and the like.<br>
The above-mentioned alcohol compound and carboxylic acid compound can be produced according to, for example, the process disclosed in EP-A-54360.<br><br>

When the present compound is used as an active ingredient of a composition for controlling pest, formulations in the form of emulsifiable concentrates, wettable powders or flowable concentrates are applied usually after having been diluted with water so that the formulations have a concentration of the present compound falling within the range of from 0.1 to 10,000 ppm. Formulations in the form of oil formulations, aerosols, fumigrants, smoking formulations, volatile formulations, foggings, ULV formulations, poisonous baits or resin formulations are applied as they are.<br>
Both the applying dosage and the applying concentration of the above formulations can be properly determined depending on conditions such as the type of formulations/ when, where and how these formulations are applied, kind of pests, degree of damage, and the like.<br>
The present compound exhibits a marked pest-controlling effect (insecticidal, knocking-down and repellent effect} when vaporized by heating. Therefore, it is particularly useful as an active ingredient of a composition for controlling pest for preventing domestic epidemics. [0020] [Embodiments]<br>
The present invention is illustrated in further detail with reference to the following production example, formulation examples and test<br>
-22-<br><br>
Toho Chemical Co., Ltd.), and thoroughly stirring and mixing the resulting mixture.<br>
