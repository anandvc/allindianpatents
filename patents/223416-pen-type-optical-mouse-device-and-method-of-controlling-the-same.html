				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a pen-type optical mouse device and a method<br>
of controlling the same, and more particularly, to a pen-type optical mouse device and a<br>
method of controlling the same wherein a light guide causes light emitted from an<br>
illuminator to be incident on a surface at a predetermined angle, and a path of the light<br>
reflected from the surface is changed so that an image of the surface is imaged upon an<br>
image sensor, thereby allowing to write letters or draw a figure through a natural writing<br>
action.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
A conventional mouse is a computer peripheral device which points a position<br>
by using a cursor displayed on a display device of a computer system and comprises a<br>
ball for allowing the change of a position and function buttons.<br>
However, in such a conventional ball-type mouse, since the ball is not<br>
smoothly rotated on a slick surface, there is a limitation on a usage place and thus a<br>
mouse pad is required in order to ensure the smooth rotation of the ball. In addition,<br>
even if the ball of the mouse is rotated on the mouse pad, coordinate axes changed in<br>
accordance with the rotation of the ball do not exactly correspond thereto. Thus, there is<br>
a problem in that the cursor cannot be smoothly moved on the screen of the display<br>
device<br>
Further, in a case where a letter is inputted or a precision work is carried out<br>
using the ball-type mouse, a user has to operate a click button provided at the leading<br>
end of the mouse while holding and moving the mouse. However, in such a case, there<br>
are problems in that it is troublesome to perform such an operation of moving the mouse<br><br>
and thus the rapidity and accuracy of measurement of the coordinates are degraded<br>
Particularly, there is a disadvantage in that since the shape of the mouse is different<br>
from those of general writing instruments, natural writing and drawing cannot be<br>
performed with the mouse. In addition, since the ball-type mouse essentially utilizes<br>
rotation of the ball, dust or the like may be collected between the ball and a device for<br>
sensing the rotation of the ball. Thus, there are disadvantages in that the durability of<br>
the mouse may be deteriorated and the interior of the mouse should be periodically<br>
cleaned.<br>
Moreover, as for optical mouse devices for a computer which employ a method<br>
of detecting coordinates by using light, an optical mouse with an optical sensor and a<br>
pad combined* and an optical mouse employing a CMOS sensor have been used. The<br>
optical mouse with the optical sensor and the pad is constructed such that a coordinate<br>
detecting means including a light emitting element and a light receiving element, and a<br>
cross line pattern is inscribed on a mouse pad. In such a case, there is a problem in that<br>
since the optical mouse inevitably requires an exclusive pad, use of the mouse is<br>
limited.<br>
Meanwhile, in case of the recently developed optical mouse employing the<br>
CMOS sensor, there are advantages in that an additional pad is not required contrary to<br>
a conventional optical mouse device, and its durability is improved since any moving<br>
parts are not employed therein The principle of such an optical mouse is specifically<br>
disclosed in US Patent No 6,233,368 Bl entitled "CMOS digital optical navigation<br>
chip" issued on May 15, 2001. In this patent, a work surface or sheet surface disposed<br>
directly below the optical mouse is illuminated with an illuminator (illuminating light<br>
source and its system) contained in the optical mouse; an imaging system contained<br>
therein images an arbitrary pattern or feature on the work or sheet surface on the plane<br>
of the CMOS sensor, and a processing unit detects a direction and the degree of<br>
movement of the mouse from variations in image information with time. In addition to<br>
such an optical mouse, U S Patent No 4,794,384 entitled "optical translator device"<br>
issued on December 27, 1988 discloses the constitution in which when a work surface is<br>
illuminated with partially coherent light from a light source, a detector array detects<br>
changes in a speckle pattern reflected by the work surface so that movement of the<br>
mouse can be detected.<br>
Such constitution has an advantage in that there is no limitation on usage<br>
environments thereof However, since the shape of the mouse is different from those of<br>
general writing instruments, the movement of the mouse is performed in a state where<br>
the entire mouse is held in a user's hand and so it is difficult to achieve accurate<br>
coordinate movement As a result, there is a problem in that it is not easy to perform a<br>
graphic operation or to write the user's signature using the mouse.<br>
A pen-type mouse for implementing accurate cursor control when performing a<br>
delicate graphic operation or writing the user's signature has been developed. An<br>
example of such a pen:type mouse is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,151,015<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as '"015 patent") entitled "pen like computer pointing device"<br>
issued on November 21, 2000 As shown in FIG. 1, the pointing device includes a<br>
cylindrical body 102, an illumination source 104, a lens 110, an optical motion sensor<br>
108, a switch 106, communications links 116, 118, and buttons 112, 114. The<br>
illumination source 104 emits light, and the lens 110 allows reflected light, which is<br>
generated when the light emitted from the illumination source 104 is reflected off a<br>
work surface, to be imaged Then, when an image of the work surface imaged through<br>
the lens 110 is captured with the optical motion sensor 108, a direction and amount of<br>
movement of the pointing device are obtained from variations in the image due to<br>
motion of the pointing device, and they are then transmitted to a computer through the<br>
communications links 116, 118<br>
However, the optical pointing device of the '015 patent has the following three<br>
disadvantages in performing a delicate graphic operation or smoothly writing one's<br>
signature.<br>
First, there is a disadvantage in that it is difficult to hold the pointing device in<br>
one's hand due to large diameter thereof. Referring to .FIG. 1, the optical motion sensor<br>
108 for capturing the image of the work surface is disposed in a direction perpendicular<br>
to a central axis of the pointing device Here, since the optical motion sensor 108,<br>
which is a kind of IC chip, has a standard size of a semiconductor chip, the dimension<br>
thereof in the (horizontal) direction perpendicular to the central axis of the pointing<br>
device is relatively longer than that in a (vertical) direction parallel to the central axis<br>
Therefore, since the installation of the optical motion sensor 108 in the manner shown<br>
in FIG. 1 results 'in enlargement of the diameter of the pointing device, it is difficult to<br>
use the pointing device while holding it in one's hand.<br>
The second disadvantage is that the motion of the pointing device cannot be<br>
accurately detected on a particular work surface Referring to FIG 1 again, since the<br>
optical pointing device of the '015 patent does not have a means for transferring the<br>
light emitted from the illumination source 104 to the work surface at a small angle, an<br>
angle ".' of the light from the illumination source 104 incident on the work surface may<br>
be increased, as shown in FIG. 2. Accordingly, if the work surface illuminated with the<br>
illumination source 104 does not have any patterns thereon or has the same color<br>
throughout the entire surface, there is a problem in that the motion of the mouse cannot<br>
be detected FIG. 2 is a magnified view showing a work surface 21, such as that of<br>
copying paper, having a uniform color and no patterns. When viewing the surface with<br>
the naked eye under normal illumination, the irregularities of such a surface cannot be<br>
recognized. However, a general work surface actually has fine irregularities such as<br>
those of the work surface 21 shown in FIG. 2 In FIG. 2, if the angle - of the light that<br>
is irradiated from the illumination source 104 onto the work surface is over 40 degrees,<br>
the light is irradiated onto both left and right side slant surfaces 24, 23 of a convex<br>
portion Thus, the left and right side slant surfaces 24, 23 of the convex portion cannot<br>
be discriminated therebetween in the image of the work surface imaged through the<br>
lens<br>
The third disadvantage is that when the pointing device is spaced apart from<br>
the work surface, the position of the cursor cannot be chased. Referring to FIG. 3, upon<br>
input of letters or figures, a writing operation with a pen is generally comprised of a<br>
combination of a pen-down action by which the pen comes into contact with a work<br>
surface and is then moved thereon, and a pen-up action by which the pen is spaced apart<br>
from the work surface and is then moved For example, as shown in FIG 3, when<br>
writing an alphabetic capital letter "X," the writing action is comprised of a step of<br>
writing "/" through the pen-down action (step SI), a step of moving the pen through the<br>
pen-up action (step S2), and a step of writing "V through the pen-down action (step S3).<br>
In general, in the pen-up action, the distance to be spaced apart from the surface is about<br>
3 mm or less.<br>
On the contrary, when it is intended to write the letter "X" by using the optical<br>
pointing device of the '015 patent, the pointing device comes into contact with the<br>
surface, a set button thereof is clicked, and then "/" is continuously written without a<br>
break (step SI) Subsequently, the set button is released, and the pointing device is<br>
moved to a proper position with being kept in contact with the surface (step S2). Then,<br>
the set button is clicked again, and "\" is written with the pointing device being kept in<br>
contact with the surface (step S3). Here, even when the pointing device is merely<br>
moved without inputting a letter (step S2), the pointing device should be in contact with<br>
the surface in order to chase coordinates thereof. If the pointing device is spaced apart<br>
from the surface, the distance between the surface 21 and the lens 110 is increased, so<br>
that the lens 110, which is designed to be properly operated under the condition that the<br>
pointing device is in contact with the surface 21, cannot cause the light to be accurately<br>
imaged on the optical motion sensor 108. Correct measurement of the coordinates<br>
cannot therefore be made in the state of the pen-up action, so that it is difficult to input<br>
letters or figures through a smooth or natural writing action.<br>
The aforementioned writing action may be smoothly or naturally made only<br>
when the state where the mouse device is in contact with the surface and the state where<br>
the mouse device is not in contact with the surface are successively connected with each<br>
other. With such a conventional mouse device, since a letter or figure should be written<br>
or drawn only in a state where the mouse device is always in contact with the surface, it<br>
is difficult to smoothly perform the writing action and to correctly input a desired letter<br>
Further, since almost all works are processed through the Internet at the present time, a<br>
case where a user should write his/her comment or signature on a document displayed<br>
on a monitor often takes place. However, it is very difficult to input a unique style of<br>
handwriting such as a signature with the conventional mouse devices Accordingly, it is<br>
nearly impossible that the user realizes his/her signature on the monitor.<br>
Consequently, in order to achieve the smooth input of the letter or figure, there<br>
is a need for a means capable of correctly measuring values of positions of the mouse<br>
device so that the coordinates thereof can be continuously chased irrespective of the<br>
state where the mouse device is in contact with the surface or not<br>
Meanwhile, even if the problems in the conventional pen-type optical mouse<br>
device required for a delicate graphic operation or a smooth writing operation may be<br>
solved, two other critical problems is expected. The pen-type optical mouse device is<br>
actually used in a slightly slanted state with respect to the work surface rather than in an<br>
upright state. Thus, the central axis (or longitudinal axis) of the pen-type optical mouse<br>
device is inclined at a certain inclination angle with respect to the direction (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as "z-axis") normal to the work surface. As a result, the "y-axis" of the pen-<br>
type optical mouse device is influenced by the inclination angle, whereas the "x-axis"<br>
thereof is not influenced by the inclination angle. That is, a magnification in each of the<br>
"x-" and "y-" axis directions of the pen-type optical mouse device becomes different<br>
from each other For example, if the user draws a circle with the pen-type optical<br>
mouse device, information on the motion of the mouse device is recognized as an<br>
ellipse having different ratios of width and height rather than the circle. Here, the<br>
aforementioned "x-," "y-," and "z-" axes are defined as follows. The "z-axis" is defined<br>
as the direction normal to the work surface or sheet surface, and the work or sheet<br>
surface, i.e. a plane normal to the "z-axis," is defined as the "x-y plane." At this time,<br>
the "y-axis" is defined as a straight line or direction that is included in a plane formed<br>
by both the normal ("z-axis") and the central axis of the pen-type optical mouse device<br>
and is also placed in the "x-y plane." The "x-axis" is defined as another direction that is<br>
Deroendicular to the "y-axis" and simultaneously placed in the "x-y plane "<br>
In addition, the optical motion sensor 108 for capturing the image of the work<br>
surface utilizes its horizontal and vertical directions as reference directions for the<br>
motion of the mouse device Since the pen-type optical mouse device generally takes<br>
the shape of a cylinder, the optical motion sensor disposed within the mouse device may<br>
be rotated from a reference angle in accordance with a posture in which the user grasps<br>
the mouse device Accordingly, if the user grasps the mouse device in an unsuitable<br>
posture, a direction in which the mouse device is horizontally moved is not parallel to<br>
the horizontal direction of the optical motion sensor 108 contained in the mouse device.<br>
Thus, there is a problem in that the moving direction of the mouse device sensed by the<br>
optical motion sensor 108 is rotated at a certain angle from the actual moving direction<br>
thereof, thereby producing a distortion of the moving direction thereof.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is conceived to solve the problems as mentioned above.<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to provide a pen-type optical mouse device<br>
wherein an image sensor is installed on a side of the interior of a main body of the pen-<br>
type optical mouse device, so that the mouse device is slim and thus can be easily<br>
grasped with a hand.<br>
A second object of the present invention is to provide a pen-type optical mouse<br>
device wherein light emitted from an illumination unit is guided to be irradiated onto a<br>
work surface at a small angle therewith so that movement of the mouse device can be<br>
correctly sensed regardless of the condition of the work surface.<br>
A third object of the present invention is to provide a pen-type optical mouse<br>
device and a method of controlling the same, wherein it is possible to discriminately<br>
sense conditions that the mouse device is moved with it being kept in contact with a<br>
work surface and without contact with the work surface, a writing command is<br>
automatically recognized depending on sensed contact pressure, and a continuous chase<br>
of coordinates of the mouse device is performed regardless of whether it is in contact<br>
with the work surface or not, so that either writing a letter or drawing a figure can be<br>
conveniently performed in the same way as handwriting with a pen.<br>
A fourth object of the present invention is to provide a pen-type optical mouse<br>
device and a method of controlling the same, wherein trapezoidal distortion is<br>
minimized and distortion of coordinate values of the mouse device according to a<br>
grasping posture, in which a user grasps the mouse device, is compensated so that the<br>
accurate movement of the cursor and the exact writing input can be obtained<br>
irrespective of the posture in which the user grasps the mouse device.<br>
In order to achieve the first object, a path of an imaging system is folded in the<br>
right angle by means of an optical path converter so that the image sensor is installed on<br>
a side of the interior of the main body of the pen-type optical mouse device according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
In order to achieve the second object, according to the present invention, light<br>
emitted from an illumination unit is guided by means of a light guide so that the light is<br>
irradiated onto the work surface at a small angle therewith.<br>
In order to achieve the third object, according to the present invention, a writing<br>
command is automatically recognized by sensing contact pressure of the mouse device<br>
through a contact sensing means, and a lens having a long focal length or a telecentric<br>
system is used to lengthen a depth of focus of an optical system, so that the coordinates<br>
of the mouse device are measured regardless of whether the mouse device is in contact<br>
with the work surface or not.<br>
In order to achieve the fourth object, according to the present invention, the<br>
trapezoidal distortion is minimized by adjusting an arrangement angle(s) of either or<br>
both the optical path converter or/and the image sensor or by using the telecentric<br>
system.<br>
To further achieve the fourth object, according to the present invention, the<br>
anisotropy of magnification in sensing the coordinate values of the mouse device can be<br>
corrected on the basis of a correction factor that is calculated according to a writing<br>
habit inputted by a user, or on the basis of an inclination of a central axis of the mouse<br>
device which is sensed by an inclination sensor<br>
To conclusively achieve the fourth object, according to the present invention,<br>
the coordinate values of the mouse device is corrected on the basis of a rotation angle of<br>
the mouse device which is calculated with respect to a reference angle thereof according<br>
to the writing habit inputted by the user, or on the oasis of the rotation angle of the<br>
mouse device sensed by a rotation angle sensor.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described<br>
in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a pen-type optical mouse device according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
The pen-type optical mouse device shown in FIG 4 includes a main body 10 of<br>
the mouse device, an illumination unit 11, an imaging system 13, an image sensor 14, a<br>
control means 15, a transmitting means 16, a set button 17, a wheel switch 18, and a<br>
contact sensing means 19.<br>
The main body 10 of the mouse device takes the form of a pen with a circular<br>
or elliptical cross-section such that a user can conveniently grasp it. Preferably, the<br>
main body 10 includes a plurality of grip portions (not shown) by which a user can hold<br>
it between his/her fingers.<br>
The contact sensing means 19 detects contact pressure generated when a<br>
leading end of the main body 10 comes into contact with an arbitrary work surface 20<br>
such as a desk surface, in the same way as, for example, a pressure sensor. The<br>
illumination unit 11 emits light when the contact sensing means 19 disposed at the<br>
leading end of the main body 10 detects pressure, i.e. by means of a signal indicating<br>
that the pen-type optical mouse device comes into contact with the work surface. Of<br>
course, the illumination unit 11 may be operated by using the set button 17 or the wheel<br>
switch 18. In addition, the control means 15 may cause the illumination unit 11 to emit<br>
faint light when the mouse device is not in use and to emit a normal luminosity when<br>
the contact sensing means 19 detects the pressure or the image sensor 14 detects any<br>
variations in an image captured thereon upon use of the mouse device.<br>
The light guide 12 guides the light emitted from the illumination unit 11 so as<br>
to be irradiated onto the work, surface 20 at a certain angle therewith. However, the<br>
light guide 12 may be omitted, if necessary. For example, it is possible to implement a<br>
pen-type optical mouse device without the tight guide 12 if the pen-type optical mouse<br>
device is used on an arbitrary work surface such as a desk surface.<br>
Reflected light generated when the light irradiated through the light guide 12 is<br>
reflected by the work surface is imaged by the imaging system 13 which, in turn,<br>
outputs it to the image sensor 14<br><br>
The image sensor 14 receives the light imaged by the imaging system 13 and<br>
converts it into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the control means 15.<br>
The control means 15 performs amplifying, filtering and photoelectric conversion in<br>
accordance with the electrical signals converted by the image sensor 14, and calculates<br>
coordinate values of the cursor to be displayed on a monitor<br>
The transmitting means 16 provides the coordinate values calculated by the<br>
control means 15 and the status signals set by the set buttons and sensed by sensors to a<br>
control means disposed within a computer through a mouse port. Of course, the<br>
transmitting means 16 can support both wire and wireless transmissions. The set button<br>
17 and the wheel switch 18 are function buttons for performing predetermined<br>
operations through the control means 15.<br>
Preferably, the pen-type optical mouse device further includes an inclination<br>
sensor (not shown) for sensing an inclination of a central axis of the mouse device with<br>
respect to the direction normal to the work surface in order to correct the anisotropy of<br>
magnification of the mouse device due to the inclination thereof, and a rotation angle<br>
sensor (not shown) for sensing a rotation angle of the mouse device with respect to a<br>
reference angle thereof in order to correct distortion due to an individual difference in a<br>
grasping posture of the mouse device. Here, the inclination sensor may be comprised of<br>
sensors for detecting the inclination of the central axis of the pen-type optical mouse<br>
device by using gravity acting on a massive piece contained in the main body,<br>
movement of a fluid filled in a closed space, variations in a capacitance or an electric<br>
current, or an encoder. A sensor employing micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)<br>
technology that is highlighted at the present time may also be used as the inclination<br>
sensor.<br>
Further, the pen-type mouse device is preferably used as a portable standalone-<br>
type input device separately from a computer. To this end, the mouse device further<br>
includes a memory (not shown) for storing movement traces of the mouse device when<br>
carried with a user Therefore, when the user takes notes of important contents on a<br>
paper or memo pad by using the pen-type optical mouse device that is carried with the<br>
user, the movement traces of the mouse device are stored in the form of vector images<br>
or bitmap images into its internal memory. The information stored as such can be<br>
confirmed by using specific application software when the mouse device is connected<br>
with a computer via wired or wireless connection.<br>
FIG. 5 is a view showing an example of the inner constitution of the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device according to the present invention<br>
In FIG. 5, like reference numerals are denoted for indicating the same<br>
components as FIG 4.<br>
Since the operations of the illumination unit 11, the light guide 12, the imaging<br>
system 13, the image sensor 14 and the control means 15 are identical with those<br>
described with reference to FIG. 4, the detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
The imaging system 13 includes an imaging lens 13a, and a reflector or a right<br>
prism 13b that serves as an optical path converter. The imaging lens 13a images the<br>
light which is emitted from the illumination unit 11, irradiated through the light guide<br>
12 onto and then reflected by the work surface 20.<br>
The reflector or right prism 13b is installed in a path of the light, which has<br>
passed through the imaging lens 13a, to change the path of the light so that the light is<br>
exactly imaged on the image sensor 14.<br>
FIG. 6 is a view showing another example of the inner constitution of the pen-<br>
type optical mouse device according to the present invention.<br>
The constitution of FIG. 6 is similar to that of FIG. 5 except for the structure of<br>
the imaging system. That is, the constitution of FIG. 6 is provided with a pentaprism<br>
13c instead of the reflector or right prism 13b, which serves as the optical path<br>
converter.<br>
The pentaprism 13c is. installed in a path of the light, which has passed through<br>
the imaging lens 13a, to change the path of the light by 90 degrees so that the light is<br>
exactly imaged on the image sensor 14, in the same manner as the reflector or right<br>
prism.<br>
Moreover, in the case where the pentaprism 13c is used as the optical path<br>
converter, the direction in which the mouse device is actually moved is consistent with<br>
the direction of the cursor displayed on a monitor.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart for explaining the operation of the pen-type optical mouse<br>
device according to the present invention<br>
In FIG. 7, when a user grasps the main body 10 with his/her hand as if he/she<br>
holds a real pen, and then moves it into contact with the work surface 20, the contact<br>
sensing means 19 disposed at the leading end of the pen-type optical mouse device<br>
detects contact pressure. At this time, the illumination unit 11 emits light in response to<br>
signals indicating that the mouse device is in contact with the work surface<br>
An example of the illumination unit 11 is shown in FIG. 8. In the figure, the<br>
illumination unit 11 includes a circular or elliptical printed circuit board (PCB) 11b, a<br>
plurality of light emitting means lla mounted at a predetermined interval on the PCB<br>
11b, and a power wire 11e for supplying electric power to the PCB 11b. Here, the<br>
plurality of light emitting means lla are employed in order to increase the amount of<br>
the reflected light captured on the image sensor 14 through the imaging system 13 by<br>
increasing the amount of the light irradiated onto the work surface even while using a<br>
compact and low luminance light emitting means<br>
On the other hand, the light emitting means lla mounted on the PCB l1b may<br>
be operated in various manners. First, when the mouse device is not in use, the control<br>
means 15 causes the light emitting means lla to emit faint light therefrom. When the<br>
set button 17 or wheel switch 18 that acts as a function button is manipulated, the light<br>
emitting means 11 a can be normally operated. Alternatively, although the light emitting<br>
means lla are operated to emit faint light when the mouse device is not in use, the<br>
control means 15 may cause the light emitting means 1 la to emit the normal luminosity<br>
when the contact sensing means 19 detects the contact pressure or the image sensor 14<br>
detects any variations in the image captured thereon. Here, since the light emitting<br>
means lla emit the faint light even when the mouse device is not in use, the variations<br>
in the image captured on the image sensor 14 are detected if the mouse device is moved<br>
to be used, so that the mouse device can be quickly converted into the normal operating<br>
state.<br>
In addition, supply or turning off of the electric power to the light emitting<br>
) means 1 la may be performed by signals from the contact sensing means 19 so that the<br><br>
luminosity of the light emitting means can be adjusted. In such a way, since the mouse<br>
device is not operated when it is not in use, a electric power can be saved<br>
As described above, when the contact sensing means 19 detects the contact<br>
pressure or the image sensor 14 detects the variations in the image captured thereon, the<br>
illumination unit 11 as shown in FIG. 5 or 6 emits the light.<br>
Then, the light emitted from the light emitting means 1 la of the illumination<br>
unit 11 is irradiated onto the work surface through the light guide 12.<br>
FIG 9 is a view showing an example of the light guide of the pen-type optical<br>
mouse device according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 9, the light guide 12<br>
includes a convex lens 12a, a light waveguide 12b, and a concave lens 12c. The convex<br>
lens 12a collimates light, which has been emitted from the light emitting means lla<br>
while diverging at a certain angle (20 degrees or more in some cases, or 140 degrees or<br>
more in the other cases), in the form of parallel rays. The light converted into the<br>
parallel rays by the convex lens 12a passes through the light waveguide 12b of the light<br>
guide 12. At this time, in order to prevent the light from leaking out from the light<br>
guide 12, all surfaces of the light waveguide 12b meets total reflection requirements for<br>
the proceeding light Further, a slant reflecting-surface is installed in the light<br>
waveguide 12b so that the light is irradiated onto the work surface at a small angle<br>
therewith, as shown in FIG. 9 The light proceeding through the light waveguide 12b is<br>
irradiated onto the work surface through a final stage of the light guide 12, i.e. the<br>
concave lens 12c Meanwhile, the concave lens 12c causes the light passing through the<br>
light guide 12 to be diffused in some degree so that an irradiated area having a desired<br>
size is produced and the light is uniformly irradiated onto the work surface.<br>
The reason that the light from the light guide 12 has to be irradiated onto the<br>
work surface 20 at a small value will be described with reference to FIG. 10. In the<br>
figure, the work surface 21 is a magnified surface having a uniform color and no<br>
patterns, such as that of copying paper. When viewing the work surface 21 with the<br>
naked eye under normal illumination, the irregularities of such a surface cannot be<br>
recognized However, there are in fact fine irregularities such as those of the work<br>
surface 21 shown in FIG 10. Therefore, contrary to that shown in FIG. 2, if the<br><br>
illuminating angle of the light, which is emitted from the illumination unit 11 and<br>
irradiated onto the work surface 21 through the light guide 12, is a small angle (about 10<br>
to 25 degrees), the light can be irradiated onto the left slant surface 26 of a convex<br>
portion of the work surface, whereas the light cannot be irradiated onto the right slant<br>
surface 25 of the convex portion at all. Thus, when the light is irradiated onto the work<br>
surface at the small angle, the left and right slant surfaces of the convex portion are<br>
observed as images having brightness different from each other, i.e. images having<br>
different patterns, in an image of the work surface captured on the image sensor 14<br>
through the imaging system 13<br>
Of course, although the illuminating angle of the light emitted from the light<br>
guide 12 and then irradiated onto the work surface 21 is influenced by the work surface<br>
21 and intervals between the heights of the irregularities, it is preferably 25 degrees or<br>
less in consideration of the intervals and the heights of the irregularities of a general<br>
work surface Meanwhile, if the angle is too small, the efficiency of illumination is<br>
deteriorated Further, if the irregularities do not have a uniform size, lower convex<br>
portions of the irregularities are shielded with higher convex portions thereof so that it<br>
is difficult to effectively form images of the irregularities. Thus, in this case, the angle<br>
is preferably 10 degrees or more.<br>
Next, the reflected light that has been irradiated onto and then reflected by the<br>
work surface is incident on the imaging system 13 so as to be imaged.<br>
When the reflected light that has been irradiated onto and then reflected by the<br>
work surface passes through the imaging lens 13a of the imaging system 13, as shown<br>
in FIG. 5, the path of the reflected light is changed by the reflector or right prism 13b<br>
serving as the optical path converter installed slantingly at an angle of 45 degrees in the<br>
path of the reflected light, and thus, the light is exactly captured and imaged on a<br>
surface of the image sensor 14 attached to a side of the main body of the mouse device<br>
That is, an image plane of the optical system is consistent with the surface of the image<br>
sensor.<br>
Of course, the other means in addition to the reflector or right prism 13b may<br>
be used as the optical path converter. As shown in FIG. 6, the pentaprism 13 c can be<br><br>
used as the optical path converter of the imaging system 13.<br>
In the case where the reflector or right prism 13b shown in FIG. 5 is used as<br>
the optical path converter, the left and right portions of the images are changed to the<br>
opposite, and the coordinate values of the mouse device are read in a direction opposite<br>
to a moving direction of the mouse device. Thus, this should be taken into<br>
consideration when calculating the coordinate values. However, in the case where the<br>
pentaprism 13c shown in FIG. 6 is used as the optical path converter, the left and right<br>
portions of the images are not changed to the opposite. Thus, the coordinate values are<br>
calculated in the moving direction of the mouse device. Further, upon use of the<br>
pentaprism 13c, the distance between the imaging lens 13a and the pentaprism 13c can<br>
be reduced, thereby achieving miniaturization of the pen-type optical mouse device.<br>
Moreover, the distance between the work surface 21 and the imaging lens 13a<br>
should be nearly same as the distance between the imaging lens 13a and the image<br>
sensor 14 so that the magnification of the imaging system 13 becomes a value close to<br>
1. The distance should be set to be twice as long as the focal length of the used imaging<br>
lens 13a. If the imaging system 13 is configured such that its magnification is larger or<br>
smaller than 1, an actually moved distance of the mouse device becomes different from<br>
a moved distance recognized by the image sensor 14 and the control means 15 in view<br>
of hardware Thus, operating accuracy of the mouse device is deteriorated or its<br>
operation is inefficiently made However, in a case where a highly delicate operation<br>
should be made using the mouse device, it is necessary to artificially lower its<br>
magnification As for means for artificially adjusting the magnification of the optical<br>
system so as to utilize such an advantage, a zoom lens may be used, or an auxiliary<br>
device for adjusting the optical path length between the work surface and the imaging<br>
lens 13a or the distance between the imaging lens 13a and the image sensor 14 may be<br>
added<br>
The imaging lens 13a of the pen-type optical mouse device may be comprised<br>
of a general spherical lens made of optical glass, or a plastic injection-molded aspheric<br>
lens for miniaturizing the pen-type optical mouse device and reducing its weight. If an<br>
aspheric convex lens is used, the diameter of the imaging systemU can be further<br><br>
reduced so that the mouse device can be slimmed. Further, the mouse device becomes<br>
lighter than that employing a glass lens, and thus, a load with which the user's hand is<br>
burdened in a manual operation can be alleviated and the operation of the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device can be more stably performed. ]n particular, since the imaging<br>
system 13 according to the present invention employs the imaging lens 13a having a<br>
focal length longer than that of an imaging lens of a conventional optical mouse device,<br>
the depth of focus of the imaging system 13 is increased so that the pen-type optical<br>
mouse device can be normally operated on a work surface disposed below a glass sheet<br>
and even when it is not in contact with the work surface but located at a position slightly<br>
above the work surface.<br>
Since the pen-type optical mouse device is actually used in a slightly inclined<br>
state rather than in an upright state, the imaging system 13 may have the trapezoidal<br>
distortion, tf the trapezoidal distortion is generated, a problem that the moved distance<br>
of the mouse device is sensed differently in accordance with the moving direction of the<br>
mouse device would be produced, or the operation of the mouse device would be<br>
abnormal. Thus, as for the imaging lens 13a, it is preferable to use an imaging lens in<br>
which the trapezoidal distortion is minimized. As shown in FIG. 11, when the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device is naturally grasped by a user, it is considered that the work<br>
surface 20 is inclined relatively to the image sensor 14 as the main body 10 of the<br>
mouse device is slanted. When the light reflected by the work surface 20 is received by<br>
the image sensor 14 through the imaging lens 13a', the trapezoidal distortion can be<br>
minimized by inclining the image sensor 14 in consideration of the degree of the<br>
inclination of the work surface 20. That is, a position of the image sensor 14 is adjusted<br>
in response to the inclination pf the work surface 20. Alternatively, the trapezoidal<br>
distortion may be minimized by adjusting a position of the optical path converter 13b,<br>
13c. or the positions of the image sensor 14 and the optical path converter.<br>
Then, the image sensor 14 converts the image of the work surface formed by<br>
the imaging system 13 including the imaging lens 13a and the optical path converter<br>
into electrical signals that in turn are transmitted to the control means 15.<br>
The image sensor 14 can be installed on a side of the interior of the main body<br><br>
owing to the optical path converter of the imaging system 13 for changing the path of<br>
the converging light by 90 degrees, as shown in FIG. 5 or 6 Therefore, even though the<br>
width of the image sensor 14 is larger than the diameter of the mouse device, it can be<br>
installed at any position of the interior of the main body so that the pen-type optical<br>
mouse device can be slimmed<br>
The control means 15 calculates the movement of the mouse device, i.e. x- and<br>
y-coordinate values changed according to the moving direction and distance of the<br>
mouse device, and then transmits the calculated coordinate values to a computer<br>
through the transmitting means 16. At this time, the computer causes the position and<br>
movement of the cursor to be displayed on a monitor<br>
Next, the principle that the image sensor 14 and the control means 15 recognize<br>
the moving direction and distance of the mouse device in accordance with the<br>
movement thereof will be explained below<br>
Generally, the pen-type optical mouse device sequentially receives the image<br>
of the work surface 21 through the imaging system 13 at a rate of about 1,500 pieces per<br>
second. The image of the work surface 21 is comprised of 18 x 18 pixels. If a work<br>
surface having a specific pattern (it is not always necessary to be a pattern, and it may<br>
be a flaw or a color-changeable portion) is observed by using the mouse device, a<br>
specific feature corresponding to the specific pattern exists at a position in the image of<br>
the work surface Thus, as the pen-type optical mouse device is moved, the position of<br>
the feature in the image corresponding to the specific pattern, which is observed every<br>
time, is moved in proportion to the moving direction and speed of the mouse device.<br>
Accordingly, when the moving direction and amount of the feature are determined, the<br>
moving direction and distance of the mouse device can be recognized<br>
Subsequently, the user moves the cursor to a desired position by moving the<br>
pen-type optical mouse device and then presses down the set button 17 mounted on the<br>
main body so that an icon or program on a screen of the monitor can be selected or<br>
executed.<br>
The set button 17 and the wheel switch 18 are operated in the same way as a<br>
click unit of a conventional mouse Therefore, an icon, or a text or letter in a document<br><br>
prepared by a word processor program can be selected by using the set button 17 or the<br>
wheel switch 18 For example, when the cursor is placed on a desired icon or the like,<br>
execution of a program can be performed, or a function among a menu in a pop-up<br>
menu window can be executed, by pressing down the button Further, the screen of the<br>
monitor can be scrolled up and down by using the wheel switch<br>
Next, a pen-type optical mouse device employing a telecentric system<br>
according to the present invention will be explained.<br>
As described above, a writing action with a pen is comprised of a combination<br>
of a pen-down action by which the pen is moved while coming into contact with a work<br>
surface, and a pen-up action by which the pen is moved while being spaced apart from<br>
the work surface That is, in order to smoothly and naturally input a letter or figure by<br>
using the pen-type optical mouse device, such pen-down and pen-up actions should be<br>
made in the same way as the pen Thus, in order to achieve the smooth and natural<br>
input of a letter or figure by means of the pen-type optical mouse device, it is required<br>
to perform the following steps, the steps of determining the pen-down action or the pen-<br>
up action during the writing action, and controlling the mouse device in such a manner<br>
that a letter or figure can be drawn while chasing coordinates of the mouse device in<br>
accordance with a moving path thereof during the pen-aown action and the coordinates<br>
can be chased in accordance with the moving path thereof during the pen-up action.<br>
The pen-type optical mouse device according to a further embodiment of the<br>
present invention includes the illumination unit 11, the light guide 12, a telecentric<br>
system 30, the image sensor 14 and the control means 15, as shown in FIG 12<br>
The telecentric system 30 includes a lens 31, a diaphragm 32, and a reflector<br>
33. Light that has passed through the diaphragm 32 is reflected by the reflector 33 and<br>
is then received by the image sensor 14. Here, the telecentric system 30 has a long<br>
depth of focus, and a magnification of the imaging system is not much influenced by a<br>
distance between the pen-type optical mouse device and the work surface Further, even<br>
though the work surface 20 is inclined with respect to the mouse device, the<br>
magnification of the telecentric system 30 is kept constant regardless of the distance<br>
between a point on the work piece 20 and the lens 31 Thus, it is not necessary to<br>
20<br>
correct an amount of movement of the mouse device sensed by the image sensor 14<br>
according to the inclination angle of the work surface 20. Furthermore, even though an<br>
object surface 35 is not perpendicular to an optical axis as shown in FIG. 13, the height<br>
of the image measured on the image sensor 14 is proportional to the height of principal<br>
rays incident on the lens 31 Thus, the trapezoidal distortion is not much produced<br>
Accordingly, even though the pen-type optical mouse device is inclined with respect to<br>
the work surface in use, the occurrence of the trapezoidal distortion can be minimized.<br>
As explained above in detail, however, the trapezoidal distortion can be<br>
minimized by arranging the image sensor 14 in response to the inclination of the work<br>
surface 20 or the object surface 35. Further, it can be minimized by regulating a<br>
position and angle of the optical path converter, e.g., the reflector 33, or by regulating<br>
the positions and angles of both the image sensor 14 and the reflector 33.<br>
Tn addition, an interval between the illumination unit 11 and the light guide 12,<br>
arrangement angles thereof, or the like is very important in the presqnt invention since it<br>
greatly influences the alignment of the imaging system., optical efficiency, and the like.<br>
If the optical efficiency is low, the electric power consumption is increased since higher<br>
electric power illumination units should be used. Further, a portion of light may enter<br>
into the main body of the mouse device directly, and then cause an optical noise to the<br>
image sensor due to scattering Actually, since an illumination unit 11' and a light guide<br>
12" can be integrally formed with each other as shown in FIG. 14, a problem of<br>
alignment of the illumination system can be resolved Further, it can be of help in<br>
improving productivity of the mouse device and miniaturizing the optical mouse device<br>
As described above, by means of an advantage of the long depth of focus of the<br>
telecentric system, changes in position of the pen-type optical mouse device according<br>
to the present invention can be stably detected regardless of whether the mouse device<br>
is moved in contact with the work surface or not. That is, since the pen-type optical<br>
mouse device of the present invention allows the image of the work surface to be<br>
formed on the image sensor regardless of whether the mouse device is in contact with<br>
the work surface, the coordinates of the mouse device can always be correctly<br>
measured. Thus, the pen-down and pen-up actions required for the smooth writing<br><br>
action can be performed without any restrictions<br>
In addition, it is preferred that the pen-type optical mouse device further include<br>
an inclination sensor (not shown) for sensing an inclination of a central axis of the pen-<br>
type optical mouse device with respect to the direction normal to the work surface, a<br>
rotation angle sensor (not shown) for sensing a rotation angle of the pen-type optical<br>
mouse device with respect to a reference angle thereof, and an internal memory (not<br>
shown) for storing traces of movement of the pen-type optical mouse device when<br>
carried with and then utilized by a user<br>
The pen-type optical mouse device according to the present invention may<br>
further include a writing means for actually writing a letter or drawing a figure on a<br>
paper sheet while outputting a letter or a figure to the computer monitor<br>
Referring to FIG 15, the writing means 40 is provided in a main body 45 of<br>
the pen-type optical mouse device according to the present invention and a pressure<br>
sensing means 42 is installed at a rear end of the writing means. Here, since the<br>
illumination unit 11, the light guide 12, the telecentric system 30, the image sensor 14,<br>
etc perform the same functions as those of the embodiments described above, the<br>
detailed descriptions thereof will be omitted On the other hand, the main body 45 is<br>
provided with a hole 50 or transparent window disposed on the optical path such that<br>
the light, which is emitted from the illumination unit 11, irradiated onto the work<br>
surface 20 and then reflected by the work surface 20, is imaged on the plane of the<br>
image sensor 14 through the imaging system 31, 32, 33<br>
In such a case, since writing operation can be made while actually writing or<br>
drawing a letter or figure on the paper sheet by using the writing means 40, the user can<br>
input the letter or figure while checking the state where it is actually written onto the<br>
sheet without viewing the monitor In particular, the pen-type optical mouse device in<br>
which the writing means is employed can be usefully utilized during a conference or<br>
discussion<br>
Moreover, whether the writing means 40 is in use or not can be selected since<br>
the writing means 40 is constructed such that a tip 41 thereof can protrude from or be<br>
retracted into the main body 45 by operating a selection key 44, When the writing<br><br>
means 40 is in use, pressure exerted onto the work surface by the writing means is<br>
transmitted to the pressure sensing means 42, and thus, the writing input is performed.<br>
When the writing means is not in use, since the tip 41 of the writing means has been<br>
retracted into the main body 45, the pressure may be transmitted to the pressure sensing<br>
means 42 through a pressure transmitting portion 43 installed on a leading end of the<br>
main body 45. Alternatively, in order to sense the pressure when the writing means 40<br>
is not in use, an additional contact sensing means (not shown) may be provided at the<br>
leading end of the main body 45 Otherwise, a pen point with ink contained therein and<br>
a pen point without ink contained therein may be provided, and then, contact sensing<br>
means may be provided to both of them, respectively.<br>
Furthermore, the writing means 40 is exchangeable. That is, in a case where<br>
the ink contained in the writing means 40 has been used up, only the writing means 40<br>
can be exchanged so that the pen-type optical mouse device is used again<br>
FIG 16 is a flowchart for explaining a method of controlling the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device according to the present invention.<br>
If there is no external light input during a predetermined period of time, the<br>
control means 15 causes the illumination unit 11 to emit a minimum luminosity (step<br>
S10).<br>
If the user brings the main body 10 of the mouse device into contact with the<br>
work surface 20, such as a desk surface, the contact sensing means 19 senses the contact<br>
pressure causing the illumination unit II to be activated in a normal operating state If<br>
the user moves the main body 10 of the mouse device, the image sensor 14 senses<br>
variations in the captured image causing the illumination unit 11 to be activated in the<br>
normal operating state Alternatively, if the user selects either the set button 17 or the<br>
wheel switch 18, the illumination unit 11 is activated in the normal operating state<br>
(steps S20-S30)<br>
Furthermore, it is checked as to whether a predetermined standby time has<br>
passed If there is no any external input such as light level, variations in the captured<br>
image, and the contact pressure within the predetermined standby time, the control<br>
means 15 causes the illumination unit 11 to emit the minimum luminosity (step S40)<br><br>
If the contact sensing means 19 has sensed the contact pressure, its magnitude P<br>
is checked as to whether it is greater than that of a predetermined reference pressure PO<br>
(step S50). The predetermined reference pressure PO is the minimum pressure which<br>
should be exerted on the work surface 20 when the user generally performs the writing<br>
action. That is, when the optical mouse device comes into contact with the work<br>
surface 20 with a pressure smaller than the reference pressure PO or is spaced apart from<br>
the work surface 20, it is not recognized as the writing command. Thus, when the<br>
mouse device is moved under this condition, the cursor is merely moved Therefore,<br>
when the user intends to move the cursor without performing the writing action, it is<br>
possible to move the mouse device in a state where the mouse device is in weak contact<br>
with the work surface 20 Further, if the reference pressure PO is set at zero, the writing<br>
command can be recognized whenever the pen-type optical mouse device comes into<br>
contact with the work surface regardless of the magnitude of the contact pressure.<br>
Thus, the writing input can be made in the same manner as when an actual writing<br>
action is made regardless of a difference in grasping power which may be produced<br>
when an individual grips the mouse device<br>
If the magnitude of the sensed contact pressure is greater than that of the<br>
predetermined reference pressure, the writing command is transmitted to the control<br>
means 15 Simultaneously, the control means 15 calculates the coordinate values of the<br>
mouse device according to the movement thereof, then processes information on the<br>
inputted letter or figure, and outputs the processed information to the transmitting<br>
means 16. Then, the inputted letter or figure is outputted onto the monitor (steps<br>
S60-S80) Here, the information on the letter or figure is changed according to the<br>
magnitude of the contact pressure sensed by the contact sensing means 19, and<br>
thickness of the letter or figure displayed on the monitor is adjusted according to the<br>
magnitude of the contact pressure sensed by the contac: sensing means 19.<br>
If the magnitude of the sensed contact pressure is smaller than that of the<br>
predetermined reference pressure, a cursor moving command is transmitted to the<br>
control means 15. Simultaneously, the control means 15 calculates the coordinate<br>
values of the mouse device according to the movement thereof and then outputs a<br><br>
moved position of the cursor to the transmitting means 16 so that the moved position of<br>
the cursor is outputted onto the monitor (steps S90~S110)<br>
As described above, the contact sensing means 19 serves as a function button<br>
for commanding that the writing input is made onto the monitor. That is, according to<br>
the present invention, whether the main body 10 of the mouse device comes into contact<br>
with the work surface 20 is first sensed. Thereafter, the writing input can be made in the<br>
contact state (ON state), whereas the coordinates of the cursor is measured and the<br>
cursor is merely moved without performing the writing input in the non-contact state<br>
(OFF state) Alternatively, the contact sensing means 19 may be replaced with a general<br>
ON-OFF switch<br>
Next, a case whereby an actual writing input is made using the pen-type optical<br>
mouse device according to the present invention will be explained For example, when<br>
the user intends to input the alphabetic capital letter "X," the following steps of writing<br>
"/" in the pen-down state (step S1), moving the mouse device in the pen-up state (step<br>
S2), and writing "V in the pen-down state (step S3) should be combined as explained<br>
above (refer to FIG 3) Here, when the mouse device is moved in the pen-down state,<br>
the pen-down state of the mouse device is sensed by the contact sensing means 19 since<br>
a certain pressure is exerted onto the mouse device by the work surface. In this case,<br>
the writing command is automatically recognized and performed.<br>
Further, when the pen is moved in a state where it is spaced apart from the<br>
work surface, the pen-up state of the mouse device can be recognized since there is no<br>
pressure sensed by the contact sensing means 19 At this time, since there is no writing<br>
command, only the chase of the coordinates is performed. According to the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device of the present invention, even if the distance between the lens 31<br>
and the work surface 20 is increased somewhat, there is no influence on the imaging of<br>
the light, which has been reflected by the work surface 20, onto the image sensor 14<br>
owing to the telecentric system 30 with the long depth of focus Further, if a lens with a<br>
long focal length is employed instead of the telecentric system, the image of the work<br>
surface can be sensed by the image sensor 14 in a state where the pen-type optical<br>
mouse device is spaced apart from the work surface<br>
In such a way, since the command for inputting the letter or figure is<br>
automatically controlled by whether or not the pen-type optical mouse device exerts a<br>
certain pressure on the work surface, the user can cause the letter or figure to be<br>
displayed onto the computer monitor as smoothly and naturally as when he/she writes or<br>
draws the letter or figure on the sheet as usual<br>
As described above, according to the pen-type optical mouse device of the<br>
present invention, since the pen-down and pen-up actions can be discriminately<br>
recognized and the measurement of the coordinates can be made by the telecentric<br>
system regardless of whether the mouse device is in contact with the work surface, the<br>
writing input can be easily made through a natural writing action.<br>
FIG. 17 is a flowchart for explaining a method of correcting the anisotropy of<br>
magnification due to variations in the inclination of the pen-type optical mouse device,<br>
and FIG 18 is a flowchart for explaining another method of correcting the anisotropy of<br>
magnification due to the variations in the inclination of the pen-type optical mouse<br>
device. And FIG 19 is a view for explaining another method of correcting the<br>
anisotropy of magnification due to the variations in the inclination of the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device<br>
As shown in FIG 19, when the pen-type optical mouse device is used in a state<br>
where it is inclined with respect to the work surface, the magnification of the optical<br>
mouse device along the x- and y-axes become different from each other The problems<br>
resulted from the anisotropy of magnification can be corrected according to the<br>
following procedures<br>
First, the user checks, through a computer program, whether or not his/her own<br>
writing habit has been inputted (step S210) If the user's writing habit has been<br>
inputted, correction factor is calculated according to the writing habit inputted by the<br>
user (step S220)<br>
More specifically, x- and y-axis oriented straight lines, which are perpendicular<br>
to each other and have the same length, are first displayed onto the monitor through the<br>
computer program. Then, the user is requested to move the mouse device along the two<br>
straight lines. Here, the aforementioned x-, y-, and z-axes are defined as follows. The<br><br>
z-axis is defined as the direction normal to the work surface or sheet surface, and the<br>
work surface or sheet surface, i e a plane normal to the z-axis, is defined as the x-y<br>
plane. Then, the y-axis is defined as a straight line or direction that is simultaneously<br>
included in the x-y plane and a plane formed by the normal (z-axis) and the longitudinal<br>
axis of the pen-type optical mouse. The x-axis means the direction that is perpendicular<br>
to the y-axis and simultaneously placed in the x-y plane<br>
First, the user is requested to move the mouse device from a start point of a line<br>
drawn along the x-axis direction to an end point thereof, and the changes Ax in the x-<br>
axis coordinate among the information on the movement of the mouse device<br>
transmitted to the computer during the movement thereof are calculated and summed up<br>
accumulatively<br><br>
The user is then requested to move the mouse device from a start point of a<br>
line drawn along the y-axis direction to an end point thereof, and the changes Ay in the<br>
y-axis coordinate among the information on the movement of the mouse device<br>
transmitted to the computer during the movement thereof are calculated and summed up<br>
accumulatively.<br><br>
Here, if the lengths of the x- and y-axis oriented straight lines drawn on the<br>
monitor are the same and the magnification of the pen-type optical mouse device is<br>
constant regardless of the direction thereof, the measured xtotal and ytotal should be the<br>
same value. However, since the pen-type optical mouse device is inclined with respect<br>
to the work surface, the values of the xtotal and ytotal are different from each other.<br>
Therefore, it is necessary to artificially increase or decrease either the length of<br>
the x-axis or y-axis oriented straight lines. If the y-axis oriented length is to be changed<br>
to correct the anisotropy of magnification, a correction factor m for the y-axis<br>
coordinate should be obtained Here, the correction factor m is obtained by the<br>
following equation (1)<br>
xtotal ytotal (1)<br>
It is then checked as to whether the image sensor 14 has sensed the variations<br><br>
in the image (step S230). If the image sensor 14 has sensed the variations in the image,<br>
the coordinate values in accordance with the movement of the mouse device are<br>
calculated based on electrical signals converted by the image sensor 14 (step S240).<br>
Based on the calculated correction factor, the anisotropy of magnification in<br>
the coordinate values of the mouse device is corrected (step S250). The anisotropy of<br>
magnification is corrected by converting the amount of the y-axis directional movement<br>
 in the calculated coordinate values of the mouse device into a new value by<br>
using the calculated correction factor m in accordance with the following equation.<br>
Here, is expressed as the equation (2).<br>
 (2)<br>
In this embodiment, the step of correcting the anisotropy of magnification (step<br>
S250) may also be performed by the control means 15 of the pen-type optical mouse<br>
device in addition to the computer program. In such a case, the correction factor m<br>
calculated through the computer program is transmitted to the control means 15, which<br>
in turn corrects the coordinate values of the mouse device based on the correction factor<br>
received from the computer and then outputs the corrected coordinate values to the<br>
transmitting means 16 (step S260).<br>
If the user has not yet inputted his/her own writing habit through the computer<br>
program, the anisotropy of magnification in the calculated coordinate values of the<br>
mouse device is calculated on the basis of a value of the inclination of the central axis of<br>
the pen-type optical mouse device that has been predetermined according to a writing<br>
habit of a general user For example, if the inclination of the central axis of the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device that has been previously determined according to the writing habit<br>
of a general user is 0, the y-axis directional magnification is decreased by cos 8<br>
compared with the x-axis directional magnification. Thus, after the anisotropy of<br>
magnification is corrected by converting the amount of the y-axis directional movement<br>
Ay in the coordinate values of the mouse device calculated by the control means 15 into<br>
the value Aym* according to the following equation (3), the corrected coordinate values<br>
of the mouse device are outputted to the transmitting means 16. Here, the value is<br>
expressed as the equation (3)<br>
 (3)<br>
The problem of the anisotropy of magnification produced when the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device is used in a state where it is inclined with respect to the sheet<br>
surface can be solved by the aforementioned method. However, it is also possible to<br>
solve the problem of the anisotropy of magnification by using the inclination sensor<br>
designed for sensing the inclination of the central axis of the pen-type optical mouse<br>
device with respect to the normal orthogonal to the work surface, as will be described<br>
below<br>
First, the inclination of the central axis of the pen-type optical mouse device<br>
with respect to the normal orthogonal to the work surface is sensed by using the<br>
inclination sensor (step S310).<br>
Then, it is checked as to whether the image sensor 14 has sensed the variations<br>
in the image (step S32O). If the image sensor 14 has sensed the variations in the image,<br>
the coordinate values of the mouse device in accordance with the movement thereof are<br>
calculated based on the electrical signals converted by the image sensor 14 (step S33O).<br>
Based on the calculated inclination Ø of the central axis of the pen-type optical<br>
mouse device sensed by the inclination sensor, the anisotropy of magnification in the<br>
calculated coordinate values of the mouse device is corrected (step S340) After the<br>
anisotropy of magnification is corrected by converting the changes Ay of the y-axis<br>
coordinate in the coordinate values of the mouse device into the value iccording<br>
to the following equation (3), the corrected coordinate values of the mouse device are<br>
outputted to the transmitting means (step S3 50)<br>
In this embodiment, the step of correcting the anisotropy of magnification (step<br>
S340) may also be performed by a computer program in addition to the control means<br>
15 of the pen-type optical mouse device. In such a case, the computer program corrects<br>
the coordinate values of the mouse device based on the inclination of the mouse device<br>
received from the mouse device. At this time, the step of outputting the corrected<br>
coordinate values of the mouse device to the transmitting means 16 (step S3 50) is<br>
omitted.<br>
Further, when the pen-type optical mouse device is used in a state where it is<br>
inclined with respect to sheet surface, the image is not likely to be correctly imaged by<br>
the imaging lens since the distance between the work surface and the imaging lens is<br>
changed. In order to minimize an image blur resulting from the aforementioned, the<br>
imaging system should allow a portion of the work surface close to the central axis of<br>
the pen-type optical mouse device to be imaged. That is, the optical axis of the imaging<br>
system should be inclined by a predetermined angle with respect to the central axis of<br>
the pen-type optical mouse device so that the imaging system with a finite diameter<br>
allows the portion of the work surface close to the central axis of the pen-type optical<br>
mouse device to be imaged Therefore, in the pen-type optical mouse device of the<br>
present invention, the image blur resulted from the variations in the inclination of the<br>
mouse device can be minimized by arranging the imaging system in such a manner that<br>
the optical axis thereof is inclined by a predetermined angle (about 6 degrees) with<br>
respect to the central axis of the pen-type optical mouse device.<br>
FIG. 20 is a flowchart for explaining a method of correcting distortion due to an<br>
individual difference in grasping postures of the pen-type optical mouse device<br>
according to the present invention, FIG. 21 is a flowchart for explaining another method<br>
of correcting the distortion due to an individual difference in the grasping postures of<br>
the pen-type optical mouse device according to the present invention, and FIGS. 22 and<br>
23 are views for explaining the methods of correcting the distortion due to an individual<br>
difference in the grasping postures of the pen-type optical mouse device according to<br>
the present invention<br>
FIG. 22 (a) is a sectional view of the pen-type optical mouse device in a case<br>
where the pen-type optical mouse device is grasped normally and FIG. 22 (b) is a<br>
sectional view of the pen-type optical mouse device in a case where the pen-type optical<br>
mouse device is grasped abnormally As shown in FIG. 22 (a), in a case where the pen-<br>
type optical mouse device is grasped normally, the moving direction (dotted line) of the<br>
mouse device recognized by the image sensor 14 is parallel to a central axis (x-axis in<br>
the figure) in the cross-section of the pen-type optical mouse device Thus, the actual<br>
moving direction (solid line) of the mouse device coincides with the moving direction<br>
(dotted line) of the mouse device recognized by the image sensor 14.<br><br>
However, as shown in FIG. 22 (b), in the case where the pen-type optical<br>
mouse device is abnormally grasped, the moving direction (dotted line) of the mouse<br>
device recognized by the image sensor 14 deviates by a predetermined angle from the<br>
central axis (x-axis in the figure) of the cross-section of the pen-type optical mouse<br>
device. As a result, the moving direction (dotted line) of the mouse device recognized<br>
by the image sensor 14 deviates by the predetermined angle from the actual moving<br>
direction (solid line) of the mouse device. Thus, the distortion may be produced since<br>
the moving direction of the mouse device is erroneously recognized by the deviated<br>
angle.<br>
The distortion due to an individual difference in the grasping postures of the<br>
pen-type optical mouse device can be corrected by the following method to be described<br>
later.<br>
Referring to FIG 20, it is checked as to whether the user has inputted his/her<br>
own writing habit through the computer program (step S4I0) If the writing habit of the<br>
user has been inputted, the rotation angle of the mouse device is calculated with respect<br>
to the reference angle thereof based on the writing habit inputted by the user (step<br>
S420)<br>
In connection with input of the user's writing habit, the user moves the pen-<br>
type optical mouse device along the x-axis direction according to the guide of the<br>
computer program so as to draw a horizontal line of a predetermined length onto the<br>
monitor screen At this time, if a grasping position of the pen-type optical mouse device<br>
deviates from the reference angle thereof, an oblique line which is inclined by the angle<br>
Ø deviated from the reference angle will be drawn onto the monitor screen Thus, the<br>
rotation angle of the mouse device with respect to the reference angle thereof can be<br>
easily calculated by obtaining the inclination of the oblique line with respect to the x-<br>
axis directional line. Here, the reference angle means the rotation angle of the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device existing in a state where the horizontal direction recognized by the<br>
image sensor is parallel to the direction along which the pen-type optical mouse device<br>
is moved horizontally.<br>
Thereafter, it is checked as to whether or not the image sensor 14 has sensed<br><br>
the variations in the image (step S430) If the image sensor 14 has sensed the variations<br>
in the image, the coordinate values in accordance with the movement of the mouse<br>
device are calculated based on the electrical signals converted by the image sensor 14<br>
(step S440). Then, the coordinate values of the mouse device are corrected based on the<br>
rotation angle of the pen-type optical mouse device with respect to the reference angle<br>
thereof (step S450).<br>
Hereinafter, how to correct the coordinate values of the mouse device based on<br>
the reference angle of the pen-type optical mouse device will be described in detail<br>
As shown in FIG 23, when the pen-type optical mouse device moves from an<br>
A(xo, yo) point to a B(x', y") point by shifting the values of the coordinates in amounts of<br>
Ax and Ay in the x-axis and y-axis directions, respectively, x' - x0 - ?x and y' -y0 -<br>
?y<br>
If the rotation angle of the pen-type optical mouse device with respect to the<br>
reference angle thereof obtained using the computer program is Ø, coordinate values of<br>
a new B(xc, yc) point obtained by correcting the distortion due to an individual<br>
difference in the grasping postures of the pen-type optical mouse device is expressed as<br>
the following equation (4)<br>
On the other hand, since a relative coordinate system is used in the mouse<br>
device, information on a current position of the mouse device is not transmitted to the<br>
computer, but the amount of movement of the mouse device from the previous position<br>
is transmitted thereto Therefore, the amounts of movement Axc, Ayc of the mouse<br>
device should be obtained from the above equation instead of the corrected coordinate<br>
values of the B(xo yc) point<br>
According to the relationship, ?xc xc - x0 and Ayc yc yo, the amounts of<br>
movement Axc, Ayc obtained by correcting the distortion due to rotation of the grasping<br>
position of the pen-type optical mouse device from the reference angle thereof by the<br>
angle Ø are expressed as the following equation (5).<br>
Therefore, it is not necessary to set a point just before the movement thereof as<br>
a.reference point and to store the coordinate values with respect to the reference point.<br>
In other words, if only the information on the amount of movement of the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device and the current rotation angle with respect to the reference angle<br>
are given, the distortion of the coordinate values of the pen-type optical mouse device<br>
due to an individual difference in the grasping postures thereof can be corrected through<br>
the above equation.<br>
In this embodiment, the step of correcting the coordinate values of the mouse<br>
device (step S450) may also be performed by the control means 15 of the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device in addition to the computer program. In such a case, the rotation<br>
angle of the mouse device calculated through the computer program is transmitted to the<br>
control means 15, which in turn corrects the coordinate values of the mouse device<br>
based on the rotation angle received from the computer and then outputs the corrected<br>
coordinate values to the transmitting means 16 (step S460).<br>
The distortion of the coordinate values of the pen-type optical mouse device<br>
due to an individual difference in the grasping postures thereof can be corrected<br>
according to the above method. However, it is also possible to correct the distortion of<br>
the coordinate values of the pen-type optical mouse device due to the changes in the<br>
grasping postures thereof using the rotation angle sensor for sensing the rotation angle<br>
of the mouse device with respect to the reference angle thereof, as described below<br>
Referring to FIG 21, the rotation angle of the pen-type optical mouse device<br>
with respect to the reference angle thereof is first sensed by the rotation angle sensor<br>
(step S510) which operates on the same principle as the inclination sensor except that a<br>
central axis thereof is different from that of the inclination sensor<br>
Thereafter, it is checked as to whether the image sensor has sensed the<br>
variations in the image (step S520). If the image sensor has sensed the variations in the<br>
image, the coordinate values in accordance with the movement of the mouse device are<br>
calculated based on the electrical signals converted by the image sensor (step S530)<br>
Then, the calculated coordinate values of the mouse device are corrected based on the<br>
rotation angle of the mouse device sensed by the rotation angle sensor with respect to<br>
the reference angle thereof, and the corrected coordinate values thereof are outputted to<br>
the transmitting means (steps S540-S550). At this point, since the procedures of<br>
correcting the coordinate values of the pen-type optical mouse device based on the<br>
rotation angle of the mouse device sensed by the rotation angle sensor are the same as<br>
those of the foregoing, the description thereof will be omitted.<br>
In this embodiment, the step of correcting the coordinate values of the mouse<br>
device (step S540) may also be performed by a computer program in addition to the<br>
control means 15 of the pen-type optical mouse device. In such a case, the computer<br>
program corrects the coordinate values of the mouse device based on the rotation angle<br>
of the mouse device received from the mouse device. At this time, the step of<br>
outputting the corrected coordinate values of the mouse device to the transmitting<br>
means 16 (step S55O) is omitted.<br>
The pen-type optical mouse device and method of controlling the same<br>
according to the present invention have the following effects.<br>
Firstly, since the light emitted from the light emitting means through the light<br>
guide is irradiated onto the work surface at a small angle therewith and is not diffused to<br>
the surroundings to increase the amount of reflected light, the pen-type optical mouse<br>
device can be operated normally on almost all work surfaces. Further, the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device can be operated without an additional mouse pad.<br>
Secondly, since the path of the converging reflected light is changed by 90<br>
degrees through the optical path converter so that the image sensor is installed on a side<br>
of the interior of the main body of the pen-type optical mouse device, the pen-type<br>
optical mouse device can be manufactured to have a diameter slightly larger than that of<br>
the lens regardless of the size of the image sensor Thus, the pen-type optical mouse<br>
device can be constructed to be slim enough to allow the user to easily grasp it<br>
Thirdly, since a zoom lens can be used instead of the simple imaging lens, or<br>
the function of adjusting the arrangement of the imaging system can be added, the<br>
operating accuracy of the mouse device can be adjusted and variability of enabling the<br><br>
mouse device to be suitable for high precision operations can be obtained<br>
Fourthly, since the telecentric system or a lens with a long focal length<br>
compared with the diameter thereof is used so as to increase the depth of focus, the pen-<br>
down and pen-up actions of the mouse device can be discriminately recognized and the<br>
measurement of the coordinates of the mouse device can be made regardless of whether<br>
the mouse device is in contact with the work surface. Thus, the writing input can be<br>
made through a smooth and natural writing action<br>
Fifthly, since the arrangement angle(s) of one or both of the optical path<br>
converting means and the image sensor is adjusted, or the telecentric system is used, the<br>
influence of the trapezoidal distortion on the pen-type optical mouse device is<br>
minimized even though the mouse device is inclined with respect to the work surface in<br>
use<br>
Sixthly, since the writing command is automatically recognized with sensing<br>
the contact pressure of the mouse device through the contact sensing means, a natural<br>
and convenient writing input can be made.<br>
Seventhly, the anisotropy of magnification due to the changes in the inclination<br>
of the pen-type optical mouse device and the distortion due to an individual difference<br>
in the grasping postures thereof can be corrected. Thus, the accurate movement of the<br>
cursor and the exact writing input can be made regardless of the postures in which the<br>
user grasps the mouse device.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiments<br>
thereof, and it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and<br>
modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
The present invention relates to a pen-type optical mouse device and a method<br>
of controlling the same wherein indicating the position of the cursor or writing input can<br>
be performed by using reflected light<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a pen-type optical mouse<br>
device and a method of controlling the same wherein a user can conveniently grasp the<br>
mouse device with his/her hand, the writing input can be made through a natural writing<br>
action, and coordinate values of the mouse device can be corrected in accordance with<br>
the user's writing habit<br>
According to the present invention, the pen-type optical mouse device can be<br>
slimmed down such that the user can easily hold it by installing an image sensor on a<br>
side of the interior of a main body of the mouse device. In addition, a writing command<br>
can be automatically recognized by means of a contact sensing means, and a long depth<br>
of focus can be ensured by means of a lens with a long focal length or a telecentric<br>
system Thus, the mouse function and the writing function can be performed with a<br>
smooth and natural writing action. Furthermore, the accurate cursor movement and<br>
writing input can be achieved even if the user grasps the pen-type optical mouse device<br>
in any posture</td>
