[31]	According to an aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for reproducing image<br>
data and text-based subtitle data recorded on a storage medium to display a caption on an image based on the image data, comprises: a video decoder for decoding the image data; and a subtitle decoder for converting presentation information item into a bitmap image based on style information, and for controlling output of the converted presentation information item synchronized with the decoded image data. The text-based subtitle data includes the presentation information item which is a unit of displaying the caption and the style information which specifies an output style of the caption.<br><br>
WO 2005/083708	PCT/KR2005/000549<br>
[32]	The subtitle decoder may decode the subtitle data recorded separated from the<br>
image data and output the subtitle data, overlaying the subtitle data on the decoded image data. The style information and the presentation information may be formed in units of packetized elementary streams (PESs), and the subtitle decoder may parse and process the style information and the presentation information in units of PESs.<br>
[33]	The style information may be formed with one PES and recorded in the from part of<br>
the subtitle data, and a plurality of presentation information items may be recorded in units of PESs after the style information, and the subtitle decoder may apply one style information item to the plurality of presentation information items.<br>
[34]	In addition, the presentation information may include text information indicating<br>
the contents of the caption and composition information controlling the output of a bitmap image obtained by converting the text information. The subtitle decoder may control the time when the converted text information is output by referring to the composition information.<br>
[35]	The presentation information may specify one or more window regions in which a<br>
caption is to be output on a screen, and the subtitle decoder may output the converted text information in the one or more window regions at the same time.<br>
[36]	An output start time and an output end time of the presentation information among<br>
the composition information may be defined as time information on a global time axis used in a playlist that is a reproducing unit of the image data, and the subtitle decoder may synchronize the output of the converted text information with the output of the decoded image data by referring to the output start time and the output end time.<br>
[37]	If the output end time information of a presentation information item currently<br>
reproduced is the same as the output start time information of a next presentation information item, the subtitle decoder may continuously reproduce the two presentation information items.<br>
[38]	If the next presentation information item does not have to be reproduced, the<br>
subtitle decoder may reset an internal buffer between the output start time and the output end time, and if the next presentation information item has to be reproduced continuously, the subtitle decoder may maintain the buffer without resetting the same.<br>
[39]	The style information may be a set of output styles that are pre-defined by the<br>
producer of the storage medium and are to be applied to the presentation information, and the subtitle decoder may convert the plurality of presentation information items recorded thereafter into bitmap images based on the style information.<br>
[40]	In addition, the text information among the presentation information may include<br>
text to be converted into a bitmap image and in-line style information to be applied to only part of the text, and by applying the in-line style information only part of the text to which the style information pre-defined by the producer is applied, the subtitle<br><br>
WO 2005/083708	PCT/KR2005/000549<br>
decoder may provide a function emphasizing part of the text.<br>
[41]	As the in-line style information, the subtitle decoder may apply a relative value of<br>
predetermined font information or a predetermined absolute value included in the style information pre-defined by the producer to part of the text.<br>
[42]	In addition, the style information may further include user changeable style in-<br>
formation, and after receiving selection information from a user on one style among the user changeable style information items, the subtitle decoder may apply the style information pre-defined by the producer, then apply the in-line style information, and then finally apply the user changeable style information item corresponding to the selection information to the text.<br>
[43]	As the user changeable style information, the subtitle decoder may apply a relative<br>
value of predetermined font information among the style information items pre-defined by the producer to the text.<br>
[44]	If the storage medium permits predetermined style information defined in a re-<br>
producing apparatus in addition to the style information pre-defined by the producer, the subtitle decoder may apply the predetermined style information to the text.<br>
[45]	In addition, the style information may include a set of color palettes to be applied to<br>
the presentation information and based on a color defined in the color palette, the subtitle decoder may convert all presentation information items after the style information into bitmap images.<br>
[46]	Separately from the set of color palettes included in the style information, the pre-<br>
sentation information may further include a set of color palettes and a color update flag, and if the color update flag is set to T, the subtitle decoder may apply the set of the color palettes included in the presentation information, and if the color update flag is set to '0', apply the original set of color palettes included in the style information.<br>
[47]	By setting the color update flag to T and gradually changing the transparency value<br>
of a color palette included in the plurality of continuous presentation information items, the subtitle decoder may implement a fade in/out effect, and if the fade in/out effect is finished, reset a color look-up table (CLUT) in the subtitle decoder, based on the original set of color palettes included in the style information.<br>
[48]	In addition, the style information may include region information indicating the<br>
location of a window region for the converted presentation information to be output on the image, and font information required for converting the presentation information into a bitmap image, and by using the region information and the font information, the subtitle decoder may convert the converted presentation information into a bitmap image.<br>
[49]	The font information may include at least one of an output start location of the<br>
converted presentation information, an output direction, sort, line space, a font<br><br>
WO 2005/083708	PCT/KR2005/000549<br>
identifier, a font style, a font size, or a color, and the subtitle decoder converts the presentation information into a bitmap image based on the font information.<br>
[50]	As the font identifier, the subtitle decoder may refer to indication information on a<br>
font file included in a clip information file storing attribute information of a recording unit of the image data,<br>
[51]	In addition, the subtitle decoder may buffer the subtitle data and a font file referred<br>
to by the subtitle data before the image data is reproduced.<br>
[52]	In addition, if a plurality of the subtitle data items supporting a plurality of"<br>
languages are recorded on the storage medium, the subtitle decoder may receive selection information on a desired language from a user, and reproduce a subtitle data item corresponding to the selection information among the plurality of subtitle data items.<br>
[53]	According to another aspect of the present invention, a method of reproducing data<br>
from a storage medium storing image data and text-based subtitle data to display a caption on an image based on the image data, comprises: decoding the image data; reading style information and a presentation information item; converting the presentation information item into a bitmap image based on the style information; and controlling output of the converted presentation information item synchronized with the decoded image data. The text-based subtitle data includes the presentation information which is a unit of displaying the caption and the style information which specifies an output style of the caption.<br>
[54]	According to still another aspect of the present invention, a storage medium is<br>
provided to store: image data; and text-based subtitle data to display a caption on an image based on the image data, wherein the subtitle data includes: one style information item specifying an output style of the caption; and a plurality of presentation information items that are displaying units of the caption, and the subtitle data is separated from the image data and recorded separately.<br>
[55]	Additional aspects and/or advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the<br>
description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.<br>
Mode for Invention<br>
[56]	The present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the ac-<br>
companying drawings, in which example embodiments of the invention are shown.<br>
[57]	Referring to FIG. 1, a storage medium (such as the medium 230 shown, for<br>
example, in FIG. 2) according to an example embodiment of the present invention is formed with multiple layers in order to manage a multimedia data structure 100 of multimedia image streams recorded thereon. The multimedia data structure 100 includes clips 110 that are recording units of a multimedia image, play lists 120 that are<br><br>
WO 2005/083708	PCT/KR2005/000549<br>
reproducing units of a multimedia image, movie objects 130 including navigation commands that are used to reproduce a multimedia image, and an index table 140 that is used to specify a movie object to be first reproduced and titles of movie objects 130.<br>
[58]	The clips 110 are implemented as one object which includes a clip AV stream 112<br>
for an audio-visual (AV) data stream for a high picture quality movie and clip information 114 for the attribute corresponding to the AV data stream. For example, The AV data stream may be compressed according to a standard, such as the motion picture experts group (MPEG). However, such clips 110 need not require the AV data stream 112 to be compressed in all aspects of the present invention. In addition, the clip information 114 may include audio/video properties of the AV data stream 112, an entry point map in which information regarding a location of a randomly accessible entry point is recorded in units of a predetermined section and the like.<br>
[59]	The playlist 120 is a set of reproduction intervals of these clips 110, and each re-<br>
production interval is referred to as a play item 122. The movie object 130 is formed with navigation command programs, and these navigation commands start reproduction of a playlist 120, switch between movie objects 130, or manage reproduction of a playlist 120 according to preference of a user.<br>
[60]	The index table 140 is a table at the top layer of the storage medium to define a<br>
plurality of titles and menus, and includes start location information of all titles and menus such that a title or menu selected by a user operation, such as title search or menu call, can be reproduced. The index table 140 also includes start location information of a title or menu that is automatically reproduced first when a storage medium is placed on a reproducing apparatus.<br>
[61]	Among these items, the structure of the clip AV stream in which a multimedia<br>
image is compression-coded will now be explained with reference to FIG. 2. FIG. 2 illustrates an example data structure of an AV data stream 210 shown in FIG. 1 and a text-based subtitle stream 220 according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[62]	Referring to FIG. 2, in order to solve problems relating to bitmap-based caption<br>
data as described above, a text-based subtitle data stream 220 according to an embodiment of the present invention is provided separately from the clip AV data stream 210 recorded on a storage medium 230, such as a digital versatile disc (DVD). The AV data stream 210 includes a video stream 202, an audio stream 204, a presentation graphics stream 206 for providing subtitle data, and an interactive graphics stream 208 for providing buttons or menus to interact with a user, all of which are multiplexed in a moving picture main stream, known as an audio-visual 'AV data stream, and recorded on the storage medium 230.<br>
[63]	The text-based subtitle data 220 according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention represents data for providing subtitles or captions of a multimedia image to<br><br><br>
WO 2005/083708<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000549<br><br>
be recorded on the storage medium 230, and can be implemented by using a markup language, such as an extensible markup language (XML). However, such subtitles or captions of a multimedia image are provided using binary data. Hereinafter, the text-based subtitle data 220 providing the caption of a multimedia image using binary data will be referred to briefly as a 'text-based subtitle stream'. The presentation graphics stream 206 for providing subtitle data or caption data also provides bitmap-based subtitle data in order to display subtitles (or captions) on a screen.<br>
[64]	Since the text-based subtitle data stream 220 is recorded separately from the AV<br>
data stream 210, and is not multiplexed with the AV data stream 210, the size of the text-based subtitle data stream 220 is not limited thereto. As a result, subtitles or captions can be provided using a plurality of languages. Moreover, (he text-based subtitle data stream 220 can be conveniently produced and effectively edited without any difficulty.<br>
[65]	The text-based subtitle stream 220 is then converted into a bitmap graphic image,<br>
and is output on a screen, overlaid over a multimedia image. The process converting text-based data thus into a graphic-based bitmap image is referred to as rendering. The text-based subtitle stream 220 includes information required for rendering caption text.<br>
[661	The structure of the text-based subtitle stream 220 including rendering information<br>
will now be explained in detail with reference to FIG. 3. FIG. 3 is a diagram for explaining an example data structure of the text-based subtitle stream 220 according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[67]	Referring to FIG. 3, the text-based subtitle stream 220 according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention includes a dialog style unit (DSU) 310, and a plurality of dialog presentation units (DPU) 320 through 340. The DSU 310 and the DPUs 320-340 are also referred to as a dialog unit. Each of the dialog units 310-340 forming the text-based subtitle stream 220 is recorded in the form of a packetized elementary stream (PES), or simply known as a PES packet 350. Also, the PES of the text-based subtitle stream 220 is recorded and transmitted in units of transport packets (TP) 362. A series of the TPs is referred to as a transport stream (TS).<br>
[68]	However, the text-based subtitle stream 220 according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention is not multiplexed with the AV data stream 210 and is recorded as a separate TS on a storage medium 230, as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
[69]	Referring again to FIG. 3, in one PES packet 350 included in the text-based subtitle<br>
stream 220, one dialog unit is recorded. The text-based subtitle stream 220 includes one DSU 310 positioned at the front and a plurality of DPUs 320 through 340 following the DSU 310. The DSU 310 includes information specifying the output style of a dialog in a caption displayed on the screen on which a multimedia image is reproduced. Meanwhile, the plurality of DPUs 320 through 340 include text in-<br><br>
WO 2005/083708	PCT/KR2005/000549<br>
formation items on the dialog contents to be displayed and information on respective output times.<br>
[70]	FIG. 4 illustrates a text-based subtitle stream 220 having the data structure shown in<br>
FIG. 3 according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[711	Referring to FIG. 4, the text-based subtitle stream 220 includes one DSU 410 and a<br>
plurality of DPUs 420.<br>
[72]	In the example embodiment of the present invention, the number of DPUs is<br>
defined as num_of_dialog_presentation_units. However, the number of DPUs may not be specified separately. An example case is using a syntax such as while(processed_length<end_of_file></end_of_file>
[731	The data structures of a DSU and a DPU will now be explained in more detail with<br>

In case of FIG. 12A, the color palette collection 1220 can be included instead of the palette reference information 1120. Dialog text in-<br><br>
WO 2005/083708	PCT/KR2005/000549<br>
formation (region_subtitle) 1334 is included as dialog region information 1230 for a dialog to be output, and in order to specify an output style to be applied to it, a region style identifier (region_style_id) 1332 can be included. The example shown in FIG. 13 is just an embodiment of a DPU and the DPU having data structures shown in FIGS. 11 through 12B can be implemented with modification in a variety of ways.<br>
[105]	FIG. 14 is a diagram for explaining the data structure of dialog text information<br>
(region_subtitle) shown in FIG. 13.<br>
[106]	Referring to FIG. 14, dialog text information 1134 shown in FIG. 11, 1234 shown<br>

[107]	FIG. 15 illustrates dialog text information 1334 shown in FIG. 13 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 15, the dialog text information 1334 is implemented by inline style information (inline_style) 1510 and dialog text (text_string) 1520. Also, it is preferable that information indicating the end of an inline style is included in the embodiment shown in FIG. 15. Unless the end part of an in-line style is defined, an in-line style once specified may be applied to continuously thereafter contrary to the intention of a producer.<br>
[108]	Meanwhile, FIG. 16 is a diagram for explaining constraints in continuously re-<br>
producing continuous DPUs.<br>
[109]	Referring to FIG. 16 and FIG. 13, when the plurality of DPUs as described above<br>
are needed to be reproduced continuously, the following constraints are needed.<br>
[110]	1) Dialog start time information (dialog_start_PTS) 1310 defined in a DPU<br>
indicates a time when a dialog object begins to be output on a graphic plane (GP) to be explained later with reference to FIG. 17.<br>
[Ill]	2) Dialog end time information (dialog_end_PTS) 1310defined in a DPU indicates<br>
a time to reset a text-based subtitle decoder processing a text-based subtitle to be explained later with reference to FIG. 17.<br>
[ 112]	3) When a plurality of DPUs described above are needed to be reproduced con-<br>
tinuously, the dialog end time information (dialog_end_PTS) of a current DPU should be the same as the dialog start time information (dialog_start_PTS) of a DPU to be reproduced continuously next. That is, in FIG. 16, in order to continuously reproduce DPU #2 and DPU #3, the dialog end time information included in DPU #2 should be the same as the dialog start time information included in DPU #3.<br>
[113]	Meanwhile, it is preferable that a DSU according to the present invention satisfies<br>
the following constraints.<br>
[114]	1) A text-based subtitle stream 220 includes one DSU.<br>
[115]	2) The number of user changeable style information items (user_control_style)<br><br>
WO 2005/083708	PCT/KR2005/000549<br>
included in all region styles (region_style) should be identical.<br>
[116]	Meanwhile, it is preferable that a DPU according to the present invention satisfies<br>
the following constraints.<br>
[117]	1) A window region for at least two captions should be defined.<br>
[118]	The structure of an example reproducing apparatus based on the data structure of a<br>
text-based subtitle stream 220 recorded on a storage medium according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to FIG. 17 herein below.<br>
[119]	FIG. 17 is a diagram for explaining the structure of an example reproducing<br>
apparatus for reproducing a text-based subtitle stream according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[120|	Referring to FIG. 17, the reproducing apparatus 1700, also known as a playback<br>
device, includes a buffer unit which comprises a font preloading buffer (FPB) 1710 for storing font files, and a subtitle preloading buffer (SPB) 1712 for storing text-based subtitle files, and a text-based subtitle decoder 1730 which decodes and reproduces the text-based subtitle stream previously recorded on a storage medium, as an output, via a graphics plane (GP) 1750 and a color look-up table (CLUT) 1760.<br>
[121]	Specifically, the buffer unit includes a subtitle pre-loading buffer (SPB) 1710 in<br>
which a text-based subtitle data stream 220 is pre-loaded, and a font pre-loading buffer (FPB) 1712 in which font information is pre-loaded.<br>
[122]	The subtitle decoder 1730 includes a text subtitle processor 1732, a dialog<br>
composition buffer (DCB) 1734, a dialog buffer (DB) 1736, a text subtitle renderer 1738, a dialog presentation controller 1740, and a bitmap object buffer (BOB) 1742.<br>
[123]	The text subtitle processor 1732 receives the text-based subtitle data stream 220<br>
from the text subtitle pre-loading buffer (SPB) 1710, transfers style related information included in the DSU and dialog output time information included in the DPU described above, to the dialog composition buffer (DCB) 1734, and transfers dialog text information included in the DPU, to the dialog buffer (DB) 1736.<br>
[124]	The presentation controller 1740 controls the text renderer 1738 by using the style<br>
related information included in the dialog composition buffer (DCB) 1734, and by using the dialog output time information, controls a time for a bitmap image rendered in the bitmap object buffer (BOB) 1742 to be output to the graphics plane (GP) 1750.<br>
[125]	According to control of the presentation controller 1740, the text subtitle renderer<br>
1738 converts dialog text information into a bitmap image, that is, performs rendering, by applying a font information item corresponding to dialog text information stored in the dialog buffer (DB) 1736 among font information items pre-loaded in the font preloading buffer (FPB) 1712, to the dialog text information. The rendered bitmap image is stored in the bitmap object buffer (BOB) 1742 and according to control of the<br><br>
WO 2005/083708	PCT/KR2005/000549<br>
presentation controller 1740, is output to the graphics plane (GP) 1750. At this time, a color specified in the DSU is applied by referring to the color look-up table (CLUT) 1760.<br>
[126]	As style relation information to be applied to dialog text, information defined in the<br>
DSU by a producer can be used, and style related information pre-defined by a user can also be applied. The reproducing apparatus 1700, as shown in FIG. 17, applies the style information defined by a user prior to the style related information defined by a producer.<br>
[127]	As described with reference to FIG. 8, as style related information to be applied to<br>
dialog text, region style information (region_style) defined in a DSU by a producer is basically applied, and if an in-line style is included in a DPU including dialog text to which the region style information is applied, in-line style information (inline_style) is applied to the corresponding part. Also, if a producer defines user changeable styles additionally in the DSU and one of the user changeable styles defined by a user is selected, the region style and/or in-line style are applied and then, the user changeable style is finally applied. Also, as described with reference to FIG. 15, it is preferable that information indicating the end of applying an inline style is included in (he contents of the in-line style.<br>
[ 128]	Furthermore, a producer can specify whether to permit or prohibit using style<br>
related information defined in the reproducing apparatus itself separately from the style related information defined by the producer and recorded on a storage medium.<br>
[129]	FIG. 18 is a diagram explaining a pre-loading process of a text-based subtitle data<br>
stream 220 in a reproducing apparatus 1700, as shown, for example, in FIG. 17, according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[130]	Referring to FIG. 18, a text-based subtitle data stream 220, shown in FIG. 2, is<br>
defined in a subpath of the playlist described above. In the subpath, a plurality of text-based subtitle data streams 220 supporting a plurality of languages can be defined. Also, a font file to be applied to a text-based subtitle can be defined in a clip information file 910 or 940 as described above with reference to FIG. 9A and FIG. 9B. Up to 255 text-based subtitle data streams 220 that can be included in one storage medium can be defined in each playlist. Also, up to 255 font files that can be included in one storage medium can be defined. However, in order to guarantee seamless presentation, the size of a text-based subtitle data stream 220 should be smaller than or equal to that of the pre-loading buffer 1710 of a reproducing apparatus 1700, shown, for example, in FIG. 17.<br>
[131]	FIG. 19 is a diagram explaining a reproduction process of a DPU in a reproducing<br>
apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
[132]	Referring to FIG. 19, FIG. 13, and FIG. 17, the process of reproducing a DPU is<br><br><br>
WO 2005/083708	PCT/KR2005/000549<br>
shown. The presentation controller 1740 controls a time for a rendered dialog to be output on a graphics plane (GP) 1750, shown in FIG. 17, by using dialog start lime information (dialog_start_PTS) and dialog end time information (dialog_end_PTS) specifying the output time 1.310 of a dialog included in a DPU. At this time, the dialog start time information specifies a time when transferring a rendered dialog bitmap image stored in the bitmap object buffer (BOB) 1742 included in the text-based subtitle decoder 1730 to the graphics plane (GP) 1750 is completed. That is, if it is the dialog start time defined in the DPU, bitmap information required for constructing a dialog should be ready lo be used after transferring the information to the graphics plane (GP) 1750 is completed. Also, the dialog end time information specifies a time when reproducing a DPU is finished. At this time, both the subtitle decoder 1730 and the graphics plane (GP) 1750 are reset. It is preferable that a buffer in the subtitle decoder 1730 such as the bitmap object buffer (BOB) 1742 is reset between a start time and an end time of a DPU regardless of continuous reproduction.<br>
[133]	However, when continuous reproduction of a plurality of DPUs is needed, the<br>
subtitle decoder 1730 and the graphics plane 1750 are not reset and the contents stored in each buffer, such as (he dialog composition buffer (DCB) 1734, the dialog buffer (DB) 1736, and the bitmap object buffer (BOB) 1742, should be maintained. That is, when the dialog end time information of a DPU currently being reproduced and the dialog start time information of a DPU to be continuously reproduced thereafter is the same, the contents of each buffer are not reset but maintained.<br>
[134]	In particular, as an example of applying continuous reproduction of a plurality of<br>
DPUs, there is a fade in/out effect. The fade in/out effect can be implemented by changing a color look-up table (CLUT) 1760 of a bitmap object which is transferred to the graphics plane (GP) 1750. That is, a first DPU includes composition information such as a color, a style, and an output time, and a plurality of DPUs continuing thereafter have composition information identical to that of the first DPU, but update only color palette information. In this case, by gradually changing transparency among color information items, from 0% to 100%, the fade in/out effect can be implemented.<br>
[135]	In particular, when the data structure of the DPU as shown in FIG. 12B is used, the<br>
fade in/out effect can be effectively implemented by using the color update flag 1260. That is, if the dialog presentation controller 1740 checks and confirms that the color update flag 1260 included in the DPU is set to '0', that is, if it is an ordinary case not requiring the fade in/out effect, color information included in die DSU shown in FIG. 6 is basically used. However, if the presentation controller 1740 confirms that the color update flag 1260 is set to T, that is, if the fade in/out effect is needed, by using color information 1270 included in the DPU, instead of using the color information 610 included in the DSU shown in FIG. 6, the fade in/out effect can be implemented. At<br><br><br>
WO 2005/083708	PCT/KR2005/000549<br>
this time, by adjusting the transparency of the color information 1270 included in the DPU, the fade in/out effect can be implemented simply.<br>
[ 136]	After thus showing the fade in/out effect, it is preferable to update the color look-up<br>
table (CLUT) 1760 to the original color information included in the DSU. This is because unless it is updated, the color information once specified can be applied continuously thereafter contrary to the intention of the producer.<br>
[137]	FIG. 20 is a diagram explaining a process in which a text-based subtitle stream is<br>
synchronized with moving picture data and output in a reproducing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[138]	Referring to FIG. 20, the dialog start time information and dialog end time in-<br>
formation included in a DPU of the text-based subtitle data stream 220 should be defined as time points on a global time axis used in a playlist so as to be synchronized with the output time of an AV data stream 210 of a multimedia image. Accordingly, discontinuity between the system time clock (STC) of an AV data stream and the dialog output time (PTS) of the text-based subtitle data stream 220 can be prevented.<br>
[139]	FIG. 21 is a diagram explaining a process in which a text-based subtitle data stream<br>
is output to a screen in a reproducing apparatus according to an embodiment of the pr esent invention.<br>
[140]	Referring to FIG. 21, shown is a process in which by applying rendering in-<br>
formation 2102 including style related information, dialog text information 2104 is converted into a bitmap image 2106, and the converted bitmap image is output at a corresponding location on a graphics plane (GP) 1750, based on output location information (such as region_horizontal_position, and region_vertica_position) included in composition information 2108.<br>
[141]	Rendering information 2102 represents style information such as the width of a<br>
region, the height, a foreground color, a background color, text sort, a font name, a font style, and a font size. As described above, the rendering information 2102 is defined in the region style collection in a DSU. Meanwhile, the composition information 2108 indicates the start time and end time of presentation, horizontal and vertical location information of a window region in which a caption is output on a graphics plane (GP) 1750 and so on. This is defined in a DPU.<br>
[142]	FIG. 22 is a diagram explaining a process of rendering a text-based subtitle data<br>
stream 220 in a reproducing apparatus 1700, shown, for example, in FIG. 17 according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[143]	Referring to FIG. 22, FIG. 21, and FIG. 8, a window region specified by using<br>
region_horizontal_position, region_vertical_position, region_width, and region_height that are location information 830 of a window region for a caption defined in a DSU is specified as a region in which a caption is displayed on a graphics plane (GB) 1750.<br><br>
WO 2005/083708	PCT/KR2005/000549<br>
The bitmap image of a rendered dialog is displayed from a start point location specified by text_horizontal_position and text_vertical_position that are the output location 840 of the dialog in die window region.<br>
[144]	Meanwhile, a reproducing apparatus according to the present invention stores style<br>
information (style_id) selected by a use in a system register area. FIG. 23 illustrates an example status register disposed in a reproducing apparatus for reproducing a text-based subtitle data stream according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[145]	Referring to FIG. 23, the status register (player status registers, hereinafter referred<br>
to as PSRs) stores style information (Selected Style 2310) selected by a user in the 12th register. Accordingly, for example, even after the reproducing apparatus 1700, shown, for example, in FIG. 17, performs a menu call or another operation, if the user pushes a style information change button, the style information selected previously by the user can be made to be applied first by referring to PSR 12. The register storing the information can be changed.<br>
[146]	A method of reproducing a text-based subtitle data stream 220 based on a storage<br>
medium recording the text-based subtitle stream 220 and the structure of a reproducing apparatus reproducing the subtitle data stream 220 described above will now be explained with reference to FIG. 24. FIG. 24 is a flowchart of the operations of a method of reproducing a text-based subtitle data stream 220 according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[147]	Text-based subtitle data stream 220 including DSU information and DPU in-<br>
