				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING REVERSE<br>
CHANNEL INFORMATION OF A MOBILE STATION IN A MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for<br>
transmitting channel information in a mobile communication system, and in<br>
particular, to an apparatus and method for transmitting reverse channel<br>
information in a mobile communication system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, a mobile communication system provides service to a plurality<br>
of mobile stations using a scheduling method. The service includes voice and<br>
data communication service. The term "scheduling" refers to a process of<br>
granting a right to provide a service to a particular mobile station among a<br>
plurality of mobile stations according to their priorities or other factors, and<br>
determining data rates of services provided to the mobile stations. Because the<br>
services are divided into voice and data, the scheduling is performed in different<br>
ways for each. For voiceservice, the scheduling needs only the information on<br>
channel and power resources available for the voice service. However, for data<br>
communication or service, the scheduling needs more information because data<br>
generally consumes more channel and power resources compared with the voice<br>
service. Therefore, to provide data service, the channel state, location , and the<br>
priority of a particular mobile station, etc. should be considered.<br>
The data service can be divided into forward data transmission and<br>
reverse data transmission according to its transmission direction. The "forward<br>
data transmission" refers to data transmission from a base station to a mobile<br>
station, and the "reverse data transmission" refers to data transmission from a<br>
mobile station to a base station. The forward data transmission and the reverse<br>
data transmission need different scheduling information. A description will now<br>
be made of information necessary for the forward data transmission and<br>
information necessary for the reverse data transmission.<br>
Data transmission in a radio link is achieved through a packet data<br>
channel on a per-physical layer packet (PLP) basis. In a system with scheduling,<br><br>
a mobile station gets permission, or a grant, from a base station to transmit<br>
packets in the reverse direction. In a particular system, a mobile station may<br>
occasionally start reverse data transmission at a lowest possible data rate.<br>
However, when the data rate is increased or decreased after the initial<br>
transmission, the mobile station can transmit reverse data in response to a grant<br>
from a base station, i.e., in response to a control signal from the base station<br>
Therefore, the foregoing case in which initial transmission is possible at the<br>
lowest data rate will not be considered herein. As described above, when mobile<br>
stations want to transmit reverse data, a base station performs scheduling on the<br>
mobile stations on a per-transmission time basis to grant or deny reverse packet<br>
data transmission. The scheduling information is transmitted to mobile stations<br>
by the base station. As a result, only the mobile station receiving the reverse<br>
transmission grant from the base station transmits a reverse packet. Although a<br>
physical channel over which the mobile station transmits packet data in response<br>
to the reverse transmission grant can have different channel names according to<br>
systems, it is generally called a "reverse packet data channel (R-PDCH)."<br>
As described above, the base station performs scheduling collectively<br>
considering channel conditions and mobile station conditions in a process of<br>
granting/disapproving reverse data transmission of mobile stations. Therefore, a<br>
scheduler of the base station should have a variety of state information for the<br>
mobile stations. For example, the state information includes information on the<br>
amount of transmission data stored in a buffer of each mobile station and a<br>
reverse channel for each mobile station. Therefore, in a common mobile<br>
communication system adopting the scheduling scheme, mobile stations should<br>
report (or feed back) the scheduling information to the base station. Although a<br>
reverse channel over which the mobile stations feed back the scheduling<br>
information to the base station can have different channel names according to<br>
systems, it is generally called a "reverse request channel (R-REQCH)."<br>
Table 1 illustrates information transmitted over the R-REQCH in a<br>
CDMA2000 Release D system, a North American version of a mobile<br>
communication system, by way of example.<br><br><br><br>
The information transmitted over the R-REQCH and the number of bits<br>
of the corresponding information, illustrated in Table 1, are subject to change in<br>
other systems. In any case, however, in a system adopting the scheduling, mobile<br>
stations transmit the similar feedback information to a base station. A description<br>
will now be made of the information fields illustrated in Table 1.<br>
(1)	RESERVED: A currently undefined bit, and can be used for various<br>
purposes in the future.<br>
(2)	MAXIMUMTPR: Information on the reverse channel state of a<br>
mobile station, and indicates the maximum TPR that a mobile station can use for<br>
R-PDCH. The abbreviation "TPR" stands for a traffic-to-pilot ratio, and refers to<br>
a ratio of transmission power of an R-PDCH to transmission power of a pilot<br>
channel. In a general mobile communication system, power of mobile stations is<br>
controlled by a base station. A description will now be made of a general reverse<br>
power control process performed in a mobile communication system.<br>
If a reverse channel of a mobile station is in a bad state, a base station<br>
orders the mobile station to increase power of its pilot channel. In contrast, if the<br>
reverse channel is in a good state, the base station orders the mobile station to<br>
decrease power of its pilot channel. In this way, the base station maintains a<br>
reception state of a reverse radio link. In other words, the base station maintains a<br>
received reverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each mobile station in a time-<br>
varying reverse radio link. Therefore, it can be considered that a level of pilot<br>
transmission power of a mobile station controlled at a particular time indicates a<br>
channel state of the corresponding mobile station. For example, assuming that<br>
there are a mobile station A and a mobile station B in communication with a base<br>
station, if pilot transmission power of the mobile station A is higher than pilot<br>
transmission power of the mobile station B at a specific time, it can be regarded<br>
that a radio channel of the mobile station B is superior in channel state to a radio<br>
channel of the mobile station A.<br>
Commonly, mobile stations are limited in maximum transmission power.<br>
For example, if maximum transmission power of a mobile station is limited to<br><br>
200mW, it means that possible maximum transmission power of the mobile<br>
station at a particular time should not exceed 200mW. In this situation where the<br>
maximum transmission power is limited, if a pilot channel of a mobile station is<br>
being power-controlled, power allocable to an R-PDCH by the mobile station at a<br>
particular time is changed according to a power level of the pilot channel. That is,<br>
it means that the power allocable to an R-PDCH is changed according to whether<br>
the pilot channel of the mobile station is in a good state or a bad state. For<br>
convenience, it will be assumed herein that physical channels transmitted by<br>
mobile stations include only two types of channels: a pilot channel and an R-<br>
PDCH. Actually, however, the physical channels transmitted by the mobile<br>
stations can include other channels as well.<br>
On this assumption, if a mobile station is being power-controlled by the<br>
base station and power allocated to its pilot channel at a particular time is 50mW,<br>
available power allocable to an R-PDCH becomes 200mW-50mW=150mW. In<br>
this case, a ratio of maximum power allocable to the R-PDCH by the mobile<br>
station to power of the pilot channel is 150mW/50mW=3. MAXIMUMTPR<br>
refers to the ratio of maximum power allocable to the R-PDCH by the mobile<br>
station to power of the pilot channel. The MAXIMUMTPR is commonly<br>
expressed in dB. The mobile station feeds back information on its reverse channel<br>
state by transmitting the MAXIMUM_TPR, i.e., the ratio of maximum power<br>
allocable to the R-PDCH to power of the pilot channel, to the base station. Based<br>
on the MAXIMUM_TPR received from the mobile station, the base station can<br>
determine a reverse channel state of the mobile station, and can also determine a<br>
maximum data rate allocable to the mobile station in a scheduling process.<br>
(3) SRID: Is a service identifier corresponding to buffer information,<br>
indicating the amount of data stored in a buffer, transmitted over an R-REQCH by<br>
a mobile station. For example, assuming that a mobile station alternately<br>
transmits a packet for a service A and a packet for a service B, if the amount of<br>
data stored in a buffer of the mobile station for the service A and the amount of<br>
data stored in a buffer for the service B at a particular time are 100 bytes and 300<br>
bytes, respectively, then the mobile station sets the SR_ID to a value<br>
corresponding to the service A and writes "100 bytes" in a field indicating the<br>
amount of data stored in a buffer before transmission, when feeding back<br>
information on the amount of data stored in a buffer for the service A. The service<br>
identification information written in the SRID can be previously agreed upon<br>
with the base station.<br><br>
(4) EVENT: Indicates the amount of data stored in a buffer,<br>
corresponding to the SR_ID.<br>
As described above, in a mobile communication system, a mobile station<br>
transmits its reverse channel state information and buffer information to a base<br>
station over an R-REQCH, and the base station schedules reverse transmission<br>
using the information received from the mobile station.<br>
Table 2 illustrates MAXIMUMTPR field values and their associated<br>
maximum TPRs in a mobile communication system, by way of example.<br><br>
As can be understood from Table 2, in a CDMA2000 Release D system,<br>
MAXIMUMTPR is expressed using 4 bits. Referring to Table 2, a mobile station<br>
transmits '0000' if a TPR value available for an R-PDCH is less than 4 dB,<br>
transmits '0001' if the TPR value falls within a range between 4 dB and 5 dB, and<br>
transmits '0010' if the TPR value falls within a range between 5 dB and 6 dB. In<br><br>
this way, the MAXIMUM_TPR values are expressed at 1-dB intervals between<br>
'0000' and '1010'. In addition, MAXIMUM_TPR='1011' indicates a range<br>
between 14 dB and 16 dB, MAXIMUM_TPR='1100' indicates a range between<br>
16 dB and 18 dB, and MAXIMUM_TPR=' 1101' indicates a range between 18 dB<br>
and 20 dB, Furthermore, MAXIMUM_TPR='1110' indicates a range between 20<br>
dB and 24 dB, and MAXIMUM_TPR=' 1111' indicates a TPR value larger than or<br>
equal to 24 dB. In the foregoing case where the TPR value available for an R-<br>
PDCH of a mobile station is expressed with 4 bits, TPR values smaller 14 dB are<br>
expressed at 1-dB intervals, and TPR values larger than 14 dB are expressed at 2-<br>
dB intervals. In addition, TPR values larger than 20 dB are expressed at 4-dB<br>
intervals.<br>
Next, with reference to Table 3, a description will be made of TPR values<br>
according to encoder packet (EP) sizes used for an R-PDCH in the CDMA2000<br>
Release D system.<br><br>
Table 3 illustrates examples of TPR values used for an R-PDCH in the<br>
CDMA2000 Release D system. The phrase "TPR values used for an R-PDCH"<br>
refers to TPR values specified to be used for respective packet data rates. For<br>
example, in Table 3, a TPR value corresponding to an encoder packet size of 192<br>
is 0.75 dB. When Table 3 is used, a mobile station transmits reverse packets using<br>
a frame having a fixed 10-ms length. As a result, encoder packets having 192 bits,<br>
408 bits, ..., and 15384 bits are transmitted for a 10-ms frame. Therefore, their<br>
data rates become 19.2 Kbps, 40.8 Kbps, •••, and 1.5384 Mbps, respectively. That<br><br>
a TPR value for EP size=192 is 0.75 dB indicates that a TPR value, i.e., a ratio of<br>
R-PDCH power to pilot power, used for transmission of 19.2-Kbps packet data by<br>
a mobile station is 0.75 dB.<br>
It can be understood from Table 3 that the EP size increases<br>
approximately on a double basis from 192 bits to 3096 bits, and increases<br>
approximately on a one-and-a-half-times basis at 3096 bits or more. This is<br>
because the increase in EP size on a double basis at a large-EP size range reduces<br>
a resolution of distribution of the EP sizes. For this reason, the TPR value<br>
corresponding to the EP size increases at about 3-dB intervals from 192 bits to<br>
3096 bits, and increases at less-than-2-dB intervals at 3096 bits or more.<br>
Table 2 and Table 3 show the opposite resolution tendencies. That is, in<br>
Table 2, TPR values available for an R-PDCH of a mobile station, feedbacked<br>
over an R-REQCH, are densely arranged at their smaller values and sparsely<br>
arranged at their larger values. In Table 3, TPR values corresponding to EP sizes<br>
are sparsely arranged at about 3-dB intervals at their smaller values and densely<br>
arranged at their larger values.<br>
Table 4 illustrates a combination of Table 2 and Table 3, i.e., a relation<br>
between MAXIMUMTPR field values, their associated maximum TPRs, and EP<br>
sizes.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 4, the third column represents EP sizes corresponding to TPR<br>
ranges indicated by MAXIMUM_TPR values feedbacked over an R-REQCH.<br>
Now, with reference to Table 4, a description will be made of TPR values and<br>
their associated EP sizes. MAXIMUM_TPR='1101' on the R-REQCH indicates<br>
that a TPR value available for an R-PDCH by a mobile station ranges falls within<br>
a range between 18 dB to 20 dB. EP sizes falling within the foregoing range<br>
include 12312 and 15384 in Table 3. If a mobile station transmits a<br>
MAXIMUM_TPR value to a base station in the foregoing method, the base<br>
station performs scheduling using the feedback information received from the<br>
mobile station. In some cases, however, the feedback information includes two or<br>
more EP sizes as described above. In this case, the base station cannot correctly<br>
determine whether an EP size supportable by the mobile station is 12312 or<br>
15384, causing a possible failure in scheduling. The failure in scheduling reduces<br>
the entire transmission throughput of a mobile communication system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a reverse<br>
feedback information transmission apparatus and method for enabling accurate<br>
scheduling in a mobile communication system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a reverse feedback<br>
information transmission apparatus and method for increasing the entire<br>
transmission efficiency in a mobile communication system.<br>
To achieve the above and other objects, there is provided a mobile station<br>
apparatus for generating and transmitting channel state information in a mobile<br>
communication system that receives the channel state information between a<br>

transmission according to the channel state information. The apparatus includes a<br>
receiver for receiving a channel state information table transmitted from the base<br><br>
station; a first memory for storing the received channel state information table; a<br>
second memory for storing reverse transmission data; a controller for mapping the<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The above and ether objects, features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description<br>
when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter for transmitting a<br>
MAXIMUMTPR value over an R-REQCH in a mobile station according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a mobile station for transmitting a<br>
MAXIMUM_TPR value according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description, a<br>
detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
has been omitted for conciseness.<br><br>
A method for feeding back reverse channel information, i.e., a<br>
MAXIMUM_T PR value, of a mobile station, proposed in the present invention,<br>
follows three principles.<br>
First, the present invention follows a resolution tendency of EP sizes in a<br>
quantization process of MAXIMUM_TPR. For example, when the EP sizes and<br>
their associated TPR values illustrated in Table 3 are provided, the present<br>
invention quantizes MAXIMUM_TPR such that the tendency of Table 3 should<br>
be satisfied. Referring to Table 3, because EP sizes and their associated TPR<br>
values are arranged at about 3-dB intervals within a small-EP size range and<br>
arranged at about 2-dB intervals within a large-EP size range, MAXIMUM_TPR<br>
is also sparsely quantized at a small-TPR value range and densely quantized at a<br>
large-TPR value range, thereby matching its tendency to the tendencies of the EP<br>
sizes and their associated TPR values, defined in Table 3.<br>
Second, in the present invention, a TPR value indicated by a<br>
MAXIMUM_TPR field value fedback from a mobile station ranges between<br>
adjacent TPR values for EP sizes, defined in Table 3. Referring to Table 3,<br>
because a TPR value corresponding to EP size=12312 is 18 dB and a TPR value<br>
corresponding to the next EP size= 15384 is 19.125 dB, a TPR value indicated by<br>
a MAXIMUMTPR field value, for example, '1110', ranges between 18 dB and<br>
19.125 dB. When a mobile station performing quantization in this manner feeds<br>
back a MAXIMUM_TPR field value of '1110', a base station can determine that<br>
a maximum EP size supportable by the mobile station is 12312.<br>
Third, in the present invention, a TPR value indicated by a<br>
MAXIMUMTPR field value fedback by a mobile station does not indicate a<br>
maximum TPR value available for an R-PDCH, but indicates a maximum TPR<br>
value supportable by the mobile station, including TPR values for an R-PDCH<br>
and an R-SPICH. That is, a TPR value indicated by a MAXIMUM_TPR field<br>
value proposed in the present invention is set such that it should become a<br>
maximum supportable TPR on (R-PDCH + R-SPICH + R-PDCCH) of a mobile<br>
station. This method is efficient especially when TPR values for the R-SPICH and<br>
the R-PDCCH are variable according to EP size. Here, the R-SPICH is the<br>
abbreviation for a reverse secondary pilot channel, and this channel is used by a<br>
mobile station to transmit packets at a high data rate. The R-PDCCH is the<br>
abbreviation for a reverse packet data control channel, and this channel is used to<br>
transmit control information necessary for demodulation of an R-PDCH which is<br><br>
transmitted together with the R-PDCCH.<br>
The foregoing three principles proposed in the present invention may be<br>
applied collectively or selectively.<br>
Table 5 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the present invention, to<br>
which the first proposed principle is applied.<br><br>
Referring to Table 5, TPR is sparsely quantized at 2-dB intervals at a<br>
small-TPR value range and densely quantized at 1-dB intervals at a large-TPR<br>
value range, so that its tendency is matched to the tendencies of the EP sizes and<br>
their associated TPR values, defined in Table 3.<br>
Next, a description will be made of an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, to which the second principle is applied. With reference to Table 6, a<br>
description will be made of a method for transmitting MAXIMUM_TPR<br>
according to the second principle proposed in the present invention.<br><br><br>
In Table 6, 'ep_size[x]' in 'TPR[ep_size[x]]' represents a TPR value<br>
corresponding to an EP size. That is, it means an xth EP size among successive EP<br>
sizes, and represents a TPR value for the corresponding EP size. This value is in<br>
accordance with Table 3 defining TPR values for EP sizes. In Table 6, ep_size[l],<br>
ep_size[2], ep_size[3], ep_size[4], •••, and ep_size[10] represent 192, 408, 792,<br>
1560, •••, and 15384, respectively, and can be an arrangement representing EP<br>
sizes. For example, because TPR[ep_size[l]] in Table 6 corresponds to a first EP<br>
size in Table 3, it becomes a TPR value corresponding to EP size=192. That is,<br>
the TPR value is 0.75 dB. The reason why ' 1011' ~ ' 1111' are unused in Table 6 is<br>
because the invention is applied to the CDMA2000 Release D system in which<br>
the EP sizes are divided into 10 groups. For example, in a system where the EP<br>
sizes are divided into 11 groups, '1010' represents 'TPR[ep_size[10]] 
TPR[ep_size[11]', and '1011' represent 'TPR[ep_size[11] 
Next, a description will be made of an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, to which the third principle is applied. With reference to Table 7, a<br><br>
description will be made of a method for mapping MAXIMUM_TPR according<br>
to the third principle proposed in the present invention, and reporting the mapping<br>
result to a base station.<br><br><br>
Now, a description will be made of a structure of a transmitter for<br>
transmitting a MAXIMUM_TPR value reported from a mobile station to a base<br>
station over an R-REQCH according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter for transmitting a<br>
MAXIMUM_TPR value over an R-REQCH in a mobile station according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The transmitter illustrated in FIG. 1 is<br>
similar in structure to a general transmitter using a convolutional code. The<br>
transmitter includes a controller 101, a frame quality indicator 102, an encoder<br>
tail bit adder 103, a convolutional encoder 104, a block interleaver 105, and a<br>
modulator 106.<br>
In operation, 12-bit information output from the controller 101 is<br>
provided to the frame quality indicator 102. The reason why the information is<br>
comprised of 12 bits is because it is assumed herein that the information is<br>
transmitted over an R-REQCH defined in Table 1. The number of bits constituting<br>
the information is subject to change according to channel type. The information<br>
includes MAXIMUM_TPR values defined in Table 5 to Table 7 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. That is, the 12-bit information includes<br>
MAXIMUM_TPR values satisfying at least one of the 3 principles proposed in<br>
the present invention.<br>
The frame quality indicator 102 adds an error detection code, e.g., cyclic<br>
redundancy check (CRC) code, to the 12-bit information, and outputs the CRC-<br>
added information to the encoder tail bit adder 103. The encoder tail bit adder 103<br>
adds encoder tail bits for convergence into a specific state to the input information,<br>
and outputs the encoder tail-added information to the convolutional encoder 104.<br>
The convolutional encoder 104 convolutional-encodes the encoder tail-added<br>
information, and outputs the convolution-encoded information to the block<br>
interleaver 105. The block interleaver 105 interleaves the convolution-encoded<br>
information, and outputs the interleaved information to the modulator 106. The<br>
modulator 106 modulates the interleaved information and transmits the modulated<br>
information in the reverse direction.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a mobile station for transmitting a<br>
MAXIMUMTPR value according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
With reference to FIG. 2, a description will now be made of a structure and<br>
operation for transmitting a MAXIMUM_TPR value according to an embodiment<br><br>
of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a controller 211 is similar in structure to the<br>
controller 101 of FIG. 1. The other elements 102 to 106 of FIG. 1 are included in a<br>
transmitter 215. The transmitter 215 further includes a radio frequency (RF)<br>
processor (not shown).<br>
During initial communication, the mobile station receives a TPR table<br>
defined in Table 5 to Table 7 over a signaling channel or a predetermined control<br>
channel. Although the table can be previously stored in the mobile station, it will<br>
be assumed herein that the table is transmitted from a base station to a mobile<br>
station. Upon receiving the table defined in the present invention, a receiver 210<br>
down-converts, demodulates and decodes the received table information, and<br>
outputs the result to the controller 211. The controller 211 stores the received<br>
table information in a TPR memory 212. The stored table can include the values<br>
created in accordance with Table 5, Table 6, and/or Table 7.<br>
In accordance with an alternative embodiment, the table described above<br>
may be formed using any one or more of the three principles defined in the<br>
present invention. If the table is generated in this way, it will change.<br>
In a process of transmitting reverse data, the controller 211 detects the<br>
amount of data stored in a transmission memory 214, and calculates a ratio of<br>
traffic power available for reverse transmission. This ratio becomes a TPR value<br>
as described previously. If the TPR value corresponds to any one of the TPR<br>
values stored in the TPR memory 212, the controller 211 generates a message to<br>
be transmitted over the R-REQCH illustrated in Table 1 using the corresponding<br>
TPR value. The transmitter 215 transmits the generated message in the reverse<br>
direction. In this manner, the mobile station can more correctly transmit<br>
scheduling information to a base station.<br>
As can be understood from the foregoing description, the mobile station<br>
forms a MAXIMUMTPR table according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, thereby transmitting more appropriate scheduling information in the<br>
reverse direction. In this way, the entire efficiency of the system can be increased.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a<br>
certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br><br>
art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
