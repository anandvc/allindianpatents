Composition for Nucleic-Acid Transfection<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for a nucleic acid transfection into cells (hereinafter may be referred to as a "nucleic-acid-transfecting composition").<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
For a nucleic acid (e.g., a gene) transfection, there have already been known methods which make use of cationic lipid alone, or a complex formed between the nucleic acid and liposomes containing cationic lipid (see, for example, Patent Document 1).  In such a method, commercially available reagents such as "Lipofectamine," "Lipofectin," "Transfectam," "Genetransfer," and "Lipofectamine 2000" are employed. [0003]<br>
However, these commercially available reagents pose problems as described below.  (a) Such a commercially available reagent exhibits poor storage stability, or fails to attain intracellular transfection and expression of a gene by use of, for example, liposomes at high reproducibility, (b) Such a commercially available reagent is very unstable in<br><br>
serum (fetal bovine serum) added to a medium for cell culture, and thus the reagent requires an intricate process for a nucleic acid transfection (i.e., a serum-containing medium in which cells are cultured is temporarily replaced with a serum-free medium, and then the serum-free medium is replaced with the serum-containing medium after a nucleic acid transfection) . Recently, it has been elucidated that such a commercially available reagent is very unstable also in blood or a living body.  (c) Most of these commercially available reagents (e.g., Lipofectamine, Lipofectin, and Lipofectamine 2000) are provided only in the form of a dispersion containing lipid dispersed in water. Therefore, an aqueous solution of a gene is added to such a reagent for transfecting the gene into cells. However, in such a case, liposomes encapsulating the gene fail to be produced, although a complex in which the gene is bound to the outside of liposomes can be produced. Lipofectamine 2000 should not be excessively stirred or shaken and must be handled with the greatest care for preventing formation of cationic lipid peroxide.  (d) Such a commercially available reagent exhibits very potent cytotoxicity. [0004]<br>
Thus, many problems are involved in some commercially available reagents for a nucleic acid (e.g., a gene) transfection -by use of cationic lipid singly or cationic-lipid-containing liposomes. Patent Document 1: JP-A-1990-135092<br>

[0016]<br>

The composition of the present invention may further contain a sterol compound (e.g., cholesterol and/or cholestanol). The amount of the sterol compound is preferably 0 to 50 mol%, more preferably 16 to 50 mol%, on the basis of the total lipid content of the composition. [0019]<br>
The amount of the aforementioned phospholipid contained in the composition of the present invention may be appropriately determined on the basis of the total lipid content of the composition. However, the ratio by mole of the compound represented by formula (I) to the phospholipid is preferably 2 : 3 to 16 : 1, more preferably 1.3 : 1 to 4 : 1. [0020]<br>

[0022]<br>
No particular limitation is imposed on the amount of the compound represented by formula (I) contained in the composition of the present invention, so long as the amount is enough to transfect a nucleic acid into cells. The amount of the compound may be appropriately determined in<br>
consideration of, for example, the type of a nucleic acid of interest, the use of the nucleic acid, or the form of the composition. For example, in the case of a nucleic acid (200 ng) transfection, the amount of the compound represented by formula (I) contained in the composition is preferably 125 to 2,000 pmol, more preferably 250 to 1,000 pmol.  In the case of siRNA transfection, the amount of the compound represented by formula (I) contained in the composition is preferably 0.1 to 10 mol, more preferably 0.5 to 2 mol against 1 mol of phosphate group.

[0023]<br>
The composition of the present invention may be in the form of a simple mixture of the compound represented by formula (I), the phospholipid, and an optional sterol compound. Alternatively, the composition may be in the form of a lipid membrane structure produced from the compound represented by formula (I), a phospholipid, and a sterol compound. [0024]<br>
No particular limitation is imposed on the form of the lipid membrane structure, and the lipid membrane structure may be in the form of, for example, a dry lipid mixture, an aqueous solvent dispersion, or a dry or frozen product of the dispersion.<br>
[0025]<br>
Examples of the aqueous solvent dispersion form of the lipid membrane structure include a single-lamellar liposome, a multi-lamellar liposome, an O/W emulsion, a W/O/W emulsion, a spherical micelle, a thread-like micelle, and an amorphous layered structure. Of these, a liposome form is preferred. No particular limitation is imposed on the size of the dispersed lipid membrane structure.  For example, when the lipid membrane structure is in the form of liposomes or emulsion, the structure has a particle size of 50 nm to 5 urn, whereas when the lipid membrane structure is in the form of spherical micelles, the structure has a particle size of 5 to 100 nm. When the lipid membrane structure is in the form of thread-like micelles or amorphous layered structure, the structure is preferably lamellar forms each having a thickness of 5 to 10 nm. [0026]<br>
Next will be described methods for producing various forms of the lipid membrane structure.<br>
(1) The lipid membrane structure in the form of dry mixture may be produced by, for example, temporarily dissolving all the components of the lipid membrane structure in an organic solvent (e.g., chloroform), and then subjecting the resultant solution to drying under reduced pressure by means of an evaporator, or to spray drying by means of a spray dryer. [0027]<br>
 (2) The lipid membrane structure in the form of aqueous solvent dispersion may be produced by adding the aforementioned dry mixture to an aqueous solvent, and then emulsifying the resultant mixture by means of, for example, an emulsifier (e.g., a homogenizer), an ultrasonic emulsifier, or a high-pressure jet emulsifier. Alternatively, the lipid membrane structure in the form of aqueous solvent dispersion may be produced through a method well-known as a liposome production method (e.g., the reverse-phase evaporation method).  For control of the size of the lipid membrane structure, extrusion (extrusion typed filtration) may be carried out under high pressure by means of, for example, a membrane filter having pores of uniform size. [002&amp;]<br>
No particular limitation is imposed on the composition of an aqueous solvent (dispersion medium) employed. Examples of the aqueous solvent which may be employed include buffers such as phosphate buffer, citrate buffer, and phosphate buffered saline; saline; and culture media for cell culture. Such an aqueous solvent (dispersion medium), in which the lipid membrane structure can be stably dispersed, may further contain, for example, a sugar (aqueous solution thereof), or a polyhydric alcohol (aqueous solution thereof). Examples of the sugar include monosaccharides such as glucose, galactose, mannose, fructose, inositol, ribose, and xylose; disaccharides such as lactose, sucrose, cellobiose,<br>
trehalose, and maltose; trisaccharides such as raffinose and melezitose; polysaccharides such as cyclodextrin; and sugar alcohols such as erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, and maltitol. Examples of the polyhydric alcohol include glycerin, diglycerin, polyglycerin, propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monoalkyl ether, diethylene glycol monoalkyl ether, and 1,3-butylene glycol.  In order to stably store the lipid membrane structure dispersed in such an aqueous solvent (dispersion medium) for a long period of time, preferably, the amount of electrolytes in the aqueous solvent (dispersion medium) is reduced to a minimum possible level, from the viewpoint of physical stability (e.g., from the viewpoint of preventing aggregation).  From the viewpoint of chemical stability of lipid, preferably, the pH of the aqueous solvent (dispersion medium) is adjusted to fall within a range of 3.0 to 8.0 (i.e., from slightly acidic to around neutral), or dissolved oxygen is removed through nitrogen bubbling. [0029]<br>
No particular limitation is imposed on the sugar or polyhydric alcohol concentration of the aqueous solvent in which the lipid membrane structure is dispersed. However, for example, the sugar (aqueous solution thereof) concentration is preferably 2 to 20% (w/v), more preferably 5 to 10% (w/v), and the polyhydric alcohol (aqueous solution thereof) concentration is preferably 1 to 5% (w/v), more<br>
preferably 2 to 2.5% (w/v) . When the aqueous solvent (dispersion medium) employed is a buffer, the buffering agent concentration is preferably 5 to 50 mM, more preferably 10 to 20 mM. No particular limitation is imposed on the lipid membrane structure concentration of the aqueous solvent dispersion, but the total lipid concentration (the amounts of components of the lipid membrane structure, including di(Ci2-i5 alkyl)dimethylammonium halide, phospholipid, and optional sterol compound) of the dispersion is preferably 0.2 to 50 mM, more preferably 1 to 10 mM. [0030]<br>
(3) A dry or frozen product of the lipid membrane structure dispersed in any of the aforementioned aqueous solvents may be produced by subjecting the aqueous solvent dispersion of the lipid membrane structure to a common drying process (e.g., lyophilization or spray drying) or to a freezing process. When the above-produced aqueous solvent dispersion of the lipid membrane structure is further dried, the lipid membrane structure can be stored for a long period of time. When an aqueous solution containing a nucleic acid is added to the thus-dried lipid membrane structure, advantageously, the lipid mixture is effectively hydrated, and thus the nucleic acid can be effectively retained in the lipid membrane structure. [0031]<br>
In the case where the aqueous solvent dispersion of the lipid membrane structure is lyophilized or spray-dried, when<br>
a sugar (aqueous solution thereof) (e.g., a monosaccharide such as glucose, galactose, mannose, fructose, inositol, ribose, or xylose,- a disaccharide such as lactose, sucrose, cellobiose, trehalose, or maltose,- a trisaccharide such as raffinose or melezitose,- a polysaccharide such as cyclodextrin; or a sugar alcohol such as erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, or maltitol) is employed, the lipid, membrane structure can be stably stored for a long period of time.  In the case where the aqueous solvent dispersion of the lipid membrane structure is frozen, when any of the aforementioned sugars (aqueous solution thereof), or a polyhydric alcohol (aqueous solution thereof) (e.g., glycerin, diglycerin, polyglycerin, propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monoalkyl ether, diethylene glycol monoalkyl ether, or 1,3-butylene glycol) is employed, the lipid membrane structure can be stably stored for a long period of time.  Such a sugar and polyhydric alcohol may be employed in combination. [0032]<br>
The nucleic-acid-transfecting composition of the present invention may be in the form of a composition containing a nucleic acid of interest (i.e., a nucleic-acid-containing composition).  Such a nucleic-acid-containing composition will next be described. [0033]<br>
The nucleic-acid-containing composition may be in the<br>
form of a simple mixture of a compound represented by formula (I), a phospholipid, a nucleic acid, and an optional sterol compound. Alternatively, the composition may be in the form of a mixture of a nucleic acid and a lipid membrane structure formed of a compound represented by formula (I), a phospholipid, and a sterol compound.  The lipid membrane structure may retain the nucleic acid. As used herein, the term "retain" refers to the case where nucleic acid is present in a lipid membrane of the lipid membrane structure, on the surface of the membrane, inside of the membrane, in a lipid layer of the structure, and/or on the surface of the lipid layer. When the lipid membrane structure is represented as microvesicles (e.g., liposomes), the nucleic acid may be encapsulated in the microvesicles. [0034]<br>
In this case, the lipid membrane structure with nucleic acid may be in the form of, for example, a dry mixture, an aqueous solvent dispersion, or a dry or frozen product of the dispersion, as with the case of the aforementioned lipid membrane structure. [0035]<br>
Next will be described methods for producing various forms of a lipid membrane structure with nucleic acid.<br>
(1) The nucleic-acid-containing composition in the form of dry mixture may be produced by, for example, temporarily dissolving the components of the lipid membrane structure and a nucleic acid in an organic solvent (e.g., chloroform), and<br>
then subjecting the resultant mixture to drying under reduced pressure by means of an evaporator, or to spray drying by means of a spray dryer. [0036]<br>
(2) The nucleic-acid-containing composition in the form of aqueous solvent dispersion containing the lipid membrane structure and a nucleic acid may be produced through several known methods.  In consideration of the mode for retaining the nucleic acid in the lipid membrane structure or the properties of the mixture, the production method may be appropriately selected from among the below-described methods 2-1 to 2-5. [0037] (2-1) Production method 1<br>
In production method 1, an aqueous solvent is added to the aforementioned dry mixture, and the resultant mixture is emulsified by means of, for example, an emulsifier (e.g., a homogenizer), an ultrasonic emulsifier, or a high-pressure jet emulsifier.  For control of size (particle size), extrusion (extrusion typed filtration) may be carried out under high pressure by means of a membrane filter having pores of uniform size.  In this production method, firstly, the lipid membrane structure and a nucleic acid must be dissolved in an organic solvent for preparing a dry mixture of the components of the lipid membrane structure and the nucleic acid. This production method is advantageous in that it can utilize to a maximum extent interaction between the<br>
components of the lipid membrane structure and the nucleic acid. Even when the lipid membrane structure has a lamellar structure, the nucleic acid can enter between multi-lamellar structures. Thus, this production method is advantageous in that the percent retention of the nucleic acid in the lipid membrane structure can be increased. [0038] (2-2) Production method 2<br>
In production method 2, the components of the lipid membrane structure are temporarily dissolved in an organic solvent; the organic solvent is removed through evaporation; and an aqueous solvent containing a nucleic acid is added to the resultant dry product, followed by emulsification.  For control of size (particle size), extrusion (extrusion typed filtration) may be carried out under high pressure by means of a membrane filter having pores of uniform size. This method is applicable to a nucleic acid which is difficult to dissolve in an organic solvent but can be dissolved in an aqueous solvent. This method is advantageous in that, when the lipid membrane structure is in the form of liposomes, a nucleic acid can also be retained in the internal aqueous phase of the structure. [0039] (2-3) Production method 3<br>
In production method 3, an aqueous solvent containing a nucleic acid is added to the lipid membrane structure in the form of, for example, liposomes, emulsion, micelles, or<br>
lamellar structure which has already been dispersed in an aqueous solvent. This method is applicable to a water-soluble nucleic acid.  In this method, a nucleic acid is added to the lipid membrane structure which has already been prepared. Therefore, when a nucleic acid of high molecular weight is employed, the nucleic acid may fail to enter inside the lipid membrane structure and may be present on (bound to) the surface of the lipid membrane structure. As has been known, when production method 3 is applied to the lipid membrane structure in the form of liposomes, a nucleic acid is sandwiched between liposome particles; i.e., a sandwich structure (generally called "complex") is formed.  In this production method, since an aqueous dispersion containing only the lipid membrane structure is produced in advance, no attention must be paid to, for example, degradation of a nucleic acid during emulsification, and size (particle size) is readily controlled. Therefore, the nucleic-acid-containing composition can be readily produced through production method 3, as compared with the case of production method 1 or 2. [0040] (2-4) Production method 4<br>
In production method 4, the lipid membrane structure dispersed in an aqueous solvent is dried, and an aqueous solvent containing a nucleic acid is added to the resultant dry product.  Similar to the case of production method 3, production method 4 is applicable to a water-soluble nucleic<br>
acid.  Production method 4 differs from production method 3 in terms of mode of presence of the lipid membrane structure and a nucleic acid.  In production method 4, the lipid membrane structure is temporarily dispersed in an aqueous solvent, and the resultant dispersion is dried. At this stage of the method, the lipid membrane structure is present in the form of a solid lipid membrane fragment.  In order to cause such a lipid membrane fragment to be present in a solid form, preferably, as described above, a sugar (aqueous solution thereof), more preferably sucrose or lactose (aqueous solution thereof), is added to the aqueous solvent employed. When an aqueous solvent containing a nucleic acid is added to the lipid membrane fragment present in a solid form, the lipid membrane fragment is rapidly invaded by water and hydrated, to thereby reconstitute the lipid membrane structure.  In this case, the thus-reconstituted lipid membrane structure retains the nucleic acid within its structure. [0041]<br>
In production method 3, when a nucleic acid of high molecular weight is employed, the nucleic acid fails to enter inside the lipid membrane structure and is present on (bound to) the surface of the lipid membrane structure. However, production method 4 greatly differs from production method 3 in this regard. That is, in the case of production method 4, the entirety or a portion of a nucleic acid is incorporated in the inside of the lipid membrane structure.  In production<br>
method 4, since a dispersion containing only the lipid membrane structure is produced in advance, no attention must be paid to degradation of a nucleic acid during emulsification, and size (particle size) is readily controlled. Thus, the nucleic-acid-containing composition can be readily produced through production method 4, as compared with the case of production method 1 or 2.  In addition, in production method 4, the lipid membrane structure is temporarily subjected to lyophilization or spray drying. Therefore, this method is advantageous in that, for example, storage stability of the final product (nucleic-acid-containing composition) is readily assured, the size (particle size) of a dry product can be restored by mixing the product with an aqueous solution of a nucleic acid, and a nucleic acid of high molecular weight is readily retained inside the lipid membrane structure. [0042] (2-5) Other methods<br>
An aqueous solvent dispersion of a mixture of the lipid membrane structure and a nucleic acid may be produced through a method well known as a liposome production method (e.g., the reverse-phase evaporation method).  For control of size (particle size), extrusion (extrusion typed filtration) may be carried out under high pressure by means of a membrane filter having pores of uniform size. [0043]<br>
(3) When the aforementioned aqueous solvent dispersion<br>
of the lipid membrane structure-nucleic acid mixture is further dried, lyophilization, spray drying, or a similar technique may be employed.  In this case, the aqueous solvent employed is preferably a solvent containing any of the aforementioned sugars (aqueous solution thereof), more preferably sucrose or lactose (aqueous solution thereof). When the aqueous solvent dispersion of the lipid membrane structure-nucleic acid mixture is further frozen, a common freezing technique may be employed.  In this case, the aqueous solvent employed is preferably a solvent containing a sugar (aqueous solution thereof) or a polyhydric alcohol (aqueous solution thereof). [0044]<br>
The thus-produced composition of the present invention realizes an effective nucleic acid transfection into cells. Therefore, the composition of the present invention can be employed as a nucleic-acid-transfecting agent (e.g., a nucleic-acid-transfecting reagent or drug). When the nucleic-acid-containing composition of the present invention is employed in  vitro,   for example, the composition may be added to a suspension containing a target cell, or the target cell may be cultured in a medium containing the composition, to thereby transfect the nucleic acid into the target cell. When the nucleic-acid-containing composition of the present invention is employed in  vivo,   the composition may be administered to a human or a non-human animal.  The composition may be orally or parenterally administered.  The<br>
oral dosage form may be a generally known one; for example, tablet, powder, or granules. The parenteral dosage form may be a generally known one; for example, injection, eye drop, ointment, or suppository.  Parenteral administration is preferred, with injection being particularly preferred. Preferably, intravenous injection or local injection into a target cell or organ is carried out. [0045]<br>
The nucleic-acid-transfecting composition of the present invention can be employed in a screening method for selecting a substance which enhances or inhibits expression of a target nucleic acid, the method including the following steps (1) to (3):<br>
(1)	a step of bringing a test substance into contact with a cell into which a target nucleic acid has been transfected;<br>
(2)	a step of determining the level of expression of the target nucleic acid in the cell which has been brought into contact with the test substance; and<br>
(3)	a step of selecting a test substance showing an expression level as determined in (2) above that is higher or lower than the level of expression of the target nucleic acid in a control cell. Specifically, the composition can be employed for transfection of the target nucleic acid into the cell and/or for exposure (introduction) of the cell to the test substance.<br>
[0046]<br>
Examples of the target nucleic acid include disease-associated genes and plasmid DNA containing such a gene. Examples of the test substance include low-molecular-weight compounds having a molecular weight of less than 10,000, preferably 100 to 2,000, and short nucleotides such as antisense oligonucleotide, antisense DNA, antisense RNA, shRNA, siRNA, and miRNA.<br>
The level of expression of the nucleic acid may be determined through, for example, a known technique such as northern blotting, RT-PCR, or quantitative PCR, or a determination method employing a DNA array.<br>
Examples of the control cell include a cell which is not exposed to the test substance, and a cell into which a short nucleotide or predetermined substance that does not affect the target nucleic acid has been transfected.<br>

Test Example 1 Test for transfection of nucleic acid into CHO cells<br>
An aqueous solution of siRNA having the below-described<br>
sequences (1 pmol/|iL) was 6.25-fold diluted with an F12 Ham medium, to thereby prepare a siRNA-diluted solution. Separately, the lyophilized liposome product of Preparation Example 1 was reconstituted with an appropriate amount of water to give a solution having a DC-3-12D concentration of<br>
about 1 mM.<br>

Antisense: 3'-UA-UGUAGUGCAUGCGCCUUAUGAAGCU-5' (SEQ ID NO: 2)<br>
The thus-obtained solution was 20.8- or 125-fold diluted with an F-12 HAM medium. Each of the thus-diluted solutions was added to and mixed with an equiamount of the siRNA-diluted solution, to thereby form a siRNA/liposome complex.  In this case, the ratio of the amount of DC-3-12D-derived cations to the amount of siRNA-derived anions is about 6 (for the case of 20.8-fold dilution) or about 1 (for the case of 125-fold dilution).  Subsequently, the resultant solution was added to and mixed with an equiamount of a 20%-FBS-containing F-12 HAM medium, to thereby prepare a siRNA/liposome-complex-containing medium.  Medium for CHO (pMAM-luc) cells (JCRB013 6.1, obtained from Human Science Research Resources Bank) was replaced with the siRNA/liposome-complex-containing medium, to thereby initiate transfection. After culturing at 37°C and 5% C02 for about 41 hours, the medium was replaced with an F-12 HAM medium containing 1 |j,M dexamethasone and 10% FBS.  After culturing at 3 7°C and 5% C02 for about six to about eight hours, cells were observed under a microscope, and cytotoxicity was evaluated according to the following scores (-: cells cover about 85 to about 100% of the field of view, and no trace of damage due to toxicity is observed; ±: cells cover about 85<br><br>
to about 10 0% of the field of view, but some trace of damage due to toxicity is observed; +: cells cover about 70 to about 80% of the field of view; ++: cells cover about 50 to about 70% of the field of view; and +++: cells cover only less than about 50% of the field of view). The results are shown in Table 3. After removal of the medium, the cells were washed with PBS.  Subsequently, the cells were lysed with PLB, and then luciferase activity was determined.  For a control, the above-described experiment was repeated, except that water was employed in place of the siRNA solution.  The experiment was carried out for the lyophilized liposomes of Preparation Examples 2 to 6 in the same manner as in the case of Preparation Example 1.  Percent knockdown (%) was calculated on the basis of the following formula (1). The results are shown in Table 3. [0058]<br>
Formula (1): 100 x (luciferase activity in the presence of siRNA)/(luciferase activity in the absence of siRNA) [0059]<br>
Separately, for a positive control, percent knockdown was evaluated by use of Lipofectamine 2 000 (trade name: product of Invitrogen).<br>
The siRNA solution (1 pmol/fiL) was 2.5-fold diluted with an F-12 HAM medium, to thereby prepare a siRNA-diluted solution.  Separately, Lipofectamine 2000 (trade name: product of Invitrogen) was 50-fold diluted with an F-12 HAM medium. The thus-diluted solution was added to an equiamount<br>
of the siRNA-diluted solution, to thereby prepare a siRNA/Lipofectamine 200 0-containing medium. The thus-prepared medium (20 (µL) was added to separately cultured CHO (pMAM-luc) cells (medium amount: 100 µL) , to thereby initiate transfection. After culturing at 37°C and 5% CO2 for about 41 hours, the medium was replaced with an F12-Ham medium<br>
containing 1 µM dexamethasone and 10% FBS. After culturing at 37°C and 5% CO2 for about seven hours, cells were observed under a microscope, and cytotoxicity was evaluated according to the aforementioned scores. After removal of the medium, the cells were washed with PBS(-).  Subsequently, the cells<br>
were lysed with 1 x PLB, and then luciferase activity was determined.  For a control, the above-described experiment was repeated, except that water was employed in place of the siRNA solution, and percent knockdown (%) was calculated on the basis of formula (1). As a result, cytotoxicity was found to be low (score: -), but white spots were observed in the cells.  Percent knockdown was found to be 3 8%. [0060]<br>

Each of the thus-diluted solutions was added to and mixed with an equiamount of the siRNA-diluted solution, to thereby form a siRNA/liposome complex.  In this case, the ratio of the amount of DC-3-12D-derived cations to the amount of siRNA-derived anions is about 4 (for the case of 28.8-fold dilution), about 1 (for the case of 115-fold dilution), or about 0.5 (for the case of 215-fold dilution).  Subsequently, the resultant solution was added to and mixed with an equiamount of a 20%-FBS-containing DMEM medium, to thereby prepare a siRNA/liposome-complex-containing medium. Medium for cells of the NFAT Reporter HeLa Stable Cell Line (product of Panomics) was replaced with the siRNA/liposome-complex-containing medium, to thereby initiate transfection. After culturing at 37°C and 5% CO2 for about 18 hours, the medium was replaced with a DMEM medium containing 10 ng/mL PMA, 0.5 µM  calcium ionophore A23187, and 10% FBS.

As shown in Tables 6 and 7, the compositions of Preparation Examples 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, and 2 0 (i.e., the compositions of the present invention) exhibited excellent nucleic-acid-transfecting performance and low cytotoxicity.  Particularly, the compositions of Preparation<br>
Examples 6, 8, 12, 15, and 2 0 were found to be preferable, and the compositions of Preparation Examples 6, 8, 12, and 15 were found to be more preferable. [0073]<br>
These data indicate that when the concentrations of, for example, the compound represented by formula (I), phospholipid, and cholesterol employed in the present invention are appropriately determined, the resultant nucleic-acid-transfecting composition exhibits more excellent performance in terms of transfection of nucleic acid and cytotoxicity. [0074]<br>
Test Example 5 Test for transfection of nucleic acid into HeLa cells<br>
Nucleic-acid-encapsulated liposomes and nucleic-acid-complex-form liposomes were compared in terms of nucleic-acid-transfecting performance. (1) Evaluation of nucleic-acid-encapsulated liposomes<br>
The lyophilized liposome product of Preparation Example 6 was reconstituted with the aqueous siRNA solution employed in Test Example 2 (34.3 pmol/µL, 18.5 pmol/µL, or 4.6 pmol/(J,L) to give a solution having a DC-3-18:lD concentration of about 1 mM, thereby forming siRNA-encapsulated liposomes. The thus-obtained solution was 428.6-, 230.8-, or 57.7-fold diluted with a DMEM medium.  Each of the thus-diluted solutions was added to and mixed with an equiamount of a 20%-FBS-containing DMEM medium, to thereby prepare a siRNA-<br>
encapsulated-liposomes-containing medium. Medium for cells of the NFAT Reporter HeLa Stable Cell Line (product of Panomics) was replaced with the siRNA-encapsulated-liposomes-containing medium, to thereby initiate transfection. After culturing at 3 7°C and 5% CO2 for about 18 hours, the medium was replaced with a DMEM medium containing 10 ng/mL PMA, 0.5 µM calcium ionophore A23187, and 10% FBS. After culturing at 37°C and 5% CO2 for about six hours, cells were observed under a microscope, and cytotoxicity was evaluated according to the aforementioned scores in a manner similar to that described in Test Example 1. After removal of the medium, the cells were washed with PBS(-).  Subsequently, the cells<br>
were lysed with 1 x PLB, and then luciferase activity was determined.  For a control, the above-described experiment was repeated, except that water was employed in place of the siRNA solution.  Percent knockdown (%) was calculated on the basis of formula (1).  The results are shown in Table 8.<br>
[0075]<br>
(2) Evaluation of nucleic-acid-complex-form liposomes<br>
The aqueous siRNA solution employed above in (1) (1 pmol/|LiL) was diluted with a DMEM medium, to thereby prepare a DMEM medium containing siRNA (80.2 fmol/µL, 80.3 fmol/)µL, or 81.4 fmol/uL).  Separately, the lyophilized liposome product of Preparation Example 6 was reconstituted with an appropriate amount of water to give a solution having a DC-3-18:1D concentration of about 1 mM.  The thus-obtained solution was 428.6-, 230. 8-, or 57.7-fold diluted with the<br>
DMEM medium containing siRNA (80.2 fmol/µL, 80.3 fmol/µL, or 81.4 fmol/µL) , to thereby yield siRNA-complex-form liposomes. Each of the thus-diluted solutions was added to and mixed with an equiamount of a 2 0%-FBS-containing DMEM medium, to thereby prepare a medium containing siRNA-complex-form liposomes. Medium for cells of the NFAT Reporter HeLa Stable Cell Line (product of Panomics) was replaced with the siRNA-complex-liposomes-containing medium, to thereby initiate transfection. After culturing at 3 7°C and 5% CO2 for about 18 hours, the medium was replaced with a DMEM medium containing 10 ng/mL PMA, 0.5 µM calcium ionophore A23187, and 10% FBS. After culturing at 37°C and 5% CO2 for about six hours, cells were observed under a microscope, and cytotoxicity was evaluated according to the aforementioned scores in a manner similar to that described in Test Example 1. After removal of the medium, the cells were washed with PBS(-). Subsequently, the cells were lysed with 1 x PLB, and then luciferase activity was determined.  For a control, the above-described experiment was repeated, except that water was employed in place of the siRNA solution.  Percent knockdown (%) was calculated on the basis of formula (1). The results are shown in Table 8. [0076] [Table 8]<br><br>
Formula Removed <br>
[0077]<br>
As shown in Table 8, as compared with the case of the complex-form liposomes, the siRNA-encapsulated liposomes obtained by adding the siRNA solution directly to the lyophilized liposomes exhibited high knockdown effect regardless of the amount of the liposomes added.<br>
