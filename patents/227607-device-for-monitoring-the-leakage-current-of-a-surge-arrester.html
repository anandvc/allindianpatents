Device for monitoring the leakage current of a surge arrester<br>
The invention relates to a device for monitoring the leakage<br>
current of a surge arrester in accordance with the<br>
precharacterizing clause of the main claim.<br>
Surge arresters for electrical power transmission systems are<br>
extremely reliable devices. However, it is often nevertheless<br>
desirable to monitor the operating state of the arrester. This<br>
is particularly the case when the devices are subject to<br>
unusually stringent requirements, for example owing to the<br>
design or environmental conditions, or are installed at<br>
particularly significant points in the system, such as at<br>
machine transformers or strategically important substations. In<br>
this case, the user would wish to be able to use monitoring<br>
devices to identify in good time whether the arrester is<br>
capable of reliably arresting surges having the specified power<br>
content at any time or whether the arrester has been damaged or<br>
is at risk of failure. In addition to the established method of<br>
introducing a monitoring spark gap in series with the arrester,<br>
in the case of which witness marks on the polished electrodes<br>
of the spark gap are evaluated, and in addition to the method<br>
of using surge counters which register the occurrence of an<br>
arresting process above a specific amplitude, methods involving<br>
the measurement of leakage currents are known in particular in<br>
the case of modern metal-oxide arresters. In the case of metal-<br>
oxide arresters, the active part is not DC-isolated from the<br>
power supply system but is connected permanently to the<br>
voltage. The electrical properties of the active part are thus<br>
reflected, at any point in time in the leakage current through<br>
the arrester. So-called total leakage current measurement is<br>
known, in the case of which the peak value for the total<br>
leakage current is usually evaluated, use being made<br><br>
of the fact that an increasing resistive component is<br>
superimposed on the normally predominantly capacitive leakage<br>
current<br><br>
as the temperature of the active part increases or as the<br>
voltage applied to said active part increases, and this<br>
increasing resistive component increases the total leakage<br>
current. Various influencing variables which are included in<br>
the total leakage current may, however, result in erroneous<br>
interpretations, and only a low degree of information quality<br>
can be achieved with this method.<br>
The Patent Abstract of Japan JP 11307226 A has disclosed a<br>
monitoring device for a surge arrester. The monitoring device<br>
is supplied from an external power supply device. The voltage<br>
produced by this external power supply device is synchronized<br>
with the system voltage of the surge arrester in order to<br>
ensure monitoring of the surge arrester.<br>
Furthermore, the Patent Abstract of Japan JP 2003037932 A has<br>
disclosed a surge arrester which has a device which monitors<br>
the ageing of the arrester. Leakage-current monitoring detects<br>
the leakage current of the surge arrester. In addition, the<br>
number of arresting processes of the surge arrester is<br>
monitored. When a predetermined number of arresting processes<br>
has been reached, correspondingly differently colored light<br>
signals are output.<br>
Patent Abstracts of Japan JP 09145759 A and JP 2000321318 A<br>
have each disclosed apparatuses for monitoring a surge<br>
arrester. For monitoring purposes, the leakage current of an<br>
arrester is monitored and evaluated in a computer unit. For<br>
this purpose, a Fourier transformation is carried out, for<br>
example. The result of the analysis is represented in each case<br>
on a display device.<br>
The Patent Abstract of Japan JP 03001476 A has disclosed a<br>
monitoring device for inspecting a surge arrester. An<br>
instrument transformer is inserted into the ground current path<br><br>
of a surge arrester. In this case, the ground connection forms<br>
the primary winding. The instrument transformer is fed<br><br>
an inspection current from an external AC voltage source.<br>
The Patent Abstract of Japan JP 08017552 A has disclosed a<br>
device for monitoring a leakage current of a surge arrester.<br>
The leakage current of the surge arrester is monitored by means<br>
of a detection device. A resistive component is calculated from<br>
the measured leakage current by means of a computation unit.<br>
This resistive component of the leakage current is used to<br>
diagnose the state of the surge arrester.<br>
The zinc oxide material used, for example, for metal-oxide<br>
arresters has a conductance which is nonlinear as a function of<br>
the voltage and leads to the formation of a third harmonic<br>
component in the resistive leakage current of the arrester when<br>
a sinusoidal voltage is applied. If the resistive component of<br>
the leakage current is increased, for example by means of<br>
degradation, this results in a shift to the range of altered<br>
nonlinearity of the characteristic and thus in a further rise<br>
in the third harmonic component content. Methods are therefore<br>
known in which analysis of the third harmonic of the leakage<br>
current is carried out. For this purpose, the leakage current<br>
is generally output via a measuring element and passed via a<br>
filter arrangement, by means of which the third harmonic<br>
component is filtered out and is evaluated in terms of its<br>
amplitude. However, at present this method has the disadvantage<br>
that the available devices are costly and require a high degree<br>
of experience for correctly measuring and interpreting the<br>
measured values. In addition, these devices require auxiliary<br>
power for their voltage supply and are therefore generally not<br>
used for continuous long-term monitoring on arresters.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of providing a<br>
device for monitoring the leakage current of a surge arrester<br>
using the third harmonic<br><br>
of the leakage current, in the case of which no auxiliary power<br>
is required for the supply of the components and the<br>
measurement results can be evaluated in a simple manner, and<br>
which can be produced in a cost-effective manner, with the<br>
result that continuous long-term monitoring of the surge<br>
arrester is possible.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by the<br>
characterizing features of the main claim in conjunction with<br>
the features of the precharacterizing clause.<br>
As a result of the fact that the filter arrangement is<br>
connected to an evaluation circuit for the third harmonic,<br>
which, if appropriate, outputs at least one warning signal to a<br>
display apparatus which is connected to the evaluation circuit,<br>
and the fact that a transformer is connected in the arrester<br>
circuit, via which transformer the power for a voltage supply<br>
to the filter arrangement and the evaluation circuit can be<br>
output, no auxiliary power is required for the electronic<br>
components, i.e. the latter are fed the leakage current, and no<br>
user-dependent erroneous interpretation is possible and only<br>
low demands are placed on the qualifications of the user since<br>
the result of the monitoring is displayed. Furthermore, the<br>
device can be produced from standard electronic components, as<br>
a result of which it is cost-effective. The device can<br>
therefore be installed permanently at the arrester for<br>
continuous monitoring purposes.<br>
The measures specified in the dependent claims make<br>
advantageous developments and improvements possible. A<br>
measuring resistor can advantageously be used as the measuring<br>
element, but the use of a current-compensated coil arrangement<br>
comprising a current compensator is also possible.<br>
An active bandpass filter having a frequency of 150 Hz can be<br>
used as the filter arrangement, and a microprocessor can be<br><br>
used as the evaluation circuit. In one simplified embodiment,<br>
the microprocessor<br><br>
can be replaced by a single discrete or integrated threshold<br>
value switch.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the display apparatus has one<br>
or more light-emitting diodes, in which case only one light-<br>
emitting diode can be provided for the simplified version with<br>
the threshold value switch, which light-emitting diode displays<br>
the instance of a predetermined threshold value being exceeded.<br>
However, three light-emitting diodes with the colors of a<br>
traffic light are particularly advantageously connected to the<br>
microprocessor and display the fault-free, the critical and the<br>
faulty operating modes. It is particularly advantageous to<br>
connect a coil arrangement having a toroidal core and two<br>
windings, which are wound around the toroidal core and whose<br>
connections are passed to the outside, into the arrester<br>
circuit, since, in the critical case, i.e. when the evaluation<br>
circuit outputs a warning signal, an external measuring device<br>
can be connected which can carry out a more accurate<br>
measurement and evaluation of the operating state.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the<br>
drawing and will be explained in more detail in the description<br>
below. In the drawing:<br><br>
figure 1 shows one circuitry refinement of the monitoring<br>
device according to the invention,<br>
figure 2 shows a further embodiment of the checking circuit<br>
used in figure 1 for the third harmonic, and<br>
figure 3 shows a further embodiment of the evaluation circuit<br>
used in figure 1 with a display.<br>
The device for monitoring the leakage current illustrated in<br>
figure 1 has a metal-oxide arrester 1 having a protection spark<br><br>
gap 2 for arrester currents and the actual leakage current path<br>
3. In addition to the arrester 1,<br><br>
the device comprises three switching units, a voltage supply<br>
unit 4, a checking circuit 5 for the third harmonic and an<br>
evaluation unit 6. The checking circuit 5 has a measuring<br>
resistor 7, which is connected into the leakage current path 3,<br>
and an active bandpass filter 8 having a mid-frequency of<br>
150 Hz. In addition, a coil arrangement 9 is arranged in the<br>
leakage circuit 3, said coil arrangement 9 having a toroidal<br>
core 10 and two coils 11 wound around the toroidal core, the<br>
connections of the coils being passed to the outside for<br>
connection to an external measuring device.<br>
The evaluation unit 6 essentially comprises a microprocessor<br>
circuit 12 and three light-emitting diodes 13, 14, 15, which,<br>
in the exemplary embodiment, are selected to be the colors of a<br>
traffic light, namely green, amber and red. Of course other<br>
light sources can in principle also be used, in which case, if<br>
appropriate, one or more audible display elements are also<br>
conceivable in place of the visual display elements.<br>
The voltage supply unit 4 comprises a transformer 16, whose<br>
primary winding 17 is connected into the leakage current path<br>
3, and whose secondary winding 18 is connected to a switched<br>
mode power supply 19 having a rectification circuit and a<br>
filter circuit. The bandpass filter 8 and the microprocessor<br>
circuit 12 are connected to the outputs of the switched mode<br>
power supply 19 for their voltage supply. The auxiliary power<br>
is output, floating, from the leakage current flowing in the<br>
leakage current path 3 via the transformer 16, the secondary<br>
coil 18 providing the switched mode power supply 19 with an<br>
alternating current. The switched mode power supply carries out<br>
rectification and filtering and makes a positive and a negative<br>
DC voltage having a corresponding zero potential available at<br>
its output.<br><br>
During operation of the arrester 1, the leakage current is<br>
checked by the measuring resistor 7 and passed on to the active<br>
bandpass filter 8, which filters out the third harmonic<br><br>
from the checked leakage current. The microprocessor circuit 12<br>
evaluates the third harmonic on the basis of the magnitude of<br>
its peak value and drives the LEDs 13 to 15. For this purpose,<br>
the microprocessor circuit 12 contains three threshold values,<br>
in which case, in the event of a peak value below a first<br>
threshold value, normal operation is indicated by a green LED<br>
13, in the event of a peak value above the first threshold<br>
value but below the second threshold value, the critical range<br>
is indicated by an amber LED 14, and, in the event of a peak<br>
value above the second threshold value, faulty operation is<br>
indicated by a red LED.<br>
As has already been explained above, the coil arrangement 9,<br>
which can be connected as a current-compensated coil, is used<br>
merely as an additional sensor for an external measuring device<br>
for precise, compensated measurement of the third harmonic, if,<br>
for example, the amber LED 14 blinks.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a further embodiment of a checking circuit<br>
5, which can be used in place of the checking circuit shown in<br>
figure 1, i.e. the measuring resistor 7 shown in figure 1 is<br>
replaced by a current-compensated coil arrangement, which has a<br>
toroidal core 20 having two coils 21, 22 and a current<br>
compensator 23 connected to the connections of the coils 21,<br>
22. In this case, the total magnetic field of the coil<br>
arrangement is brought to zero by means of a reverse current,<br>
with the result that the measured voltage is available at the<br>
output of the current compensator 23. The active bandpass<br>
filter 8 in turn filters out the third harmonic.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates one variant of the evaluation unit 6, in<br>
the case of which the microprocessor circuit 12 is replaced by<br>
a single threshold value switch 24, which has only one<br>
threshold value for the display of the critical operating<br>
range. In this exemplary embodiment, there is only one LED 25,<br>
which can illuminate or blink amber, for example.<br><br>
The coil arrangement 9 can also be provided in all of the<br>
exemplary embodiments.<br><br>
