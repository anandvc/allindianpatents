				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
BASE FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE FILTER CARTRIDGE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to lubricating oil filtration in internal combustion<br>
engines in general.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Internal combustion engines are known to generally comprise a lubrication<br>
system with which a disposable filter cartridge is associated contained in a<br>
cup, which it is not necessary to describe in detail.<br>
Said cartridge is intended to be removably coupled, generally by a<br>
threaded system and by way of suitable interposed seal means, to a base<br>
provided on the engine structure and comprising a suitable seat.<br>
The base of said cartridge is provided with apertures for the entry of the oil<br>
to be filtered and for the exit of the filtered oil, said seat presenting<br>
corresponding arrival and departure channels for the oil to be filtered and<br>
for the filtered oil respectively.<br>
Engines exist in which the cartridge carrying seat generally faces<br>
downwards, and others in which it generally faces upwards.<br>
Sunken regions which fill with oil during engine operation are generally<br>
present at the mutually facing surfaces of said seat and said cartridge.<br>
When the cartridge is to be removed, for example for its replacement, at<br>
least a part of the oil present in said regions is no longer retained, hence is<br>
free to pour out of the base.<br><br>
If the cartridge carrying seat generally faces downwards, the loss of said<br>
oil fraction is generally not a problem because the oil is retained by the<br>
cup of the cartridge.<br>
However if the cartridge carrying seat faces generally upwards, the loss of<br>
said oil fraction can be a problem for at least one of the following reasons:<br>
soiling of engine parts and accessories reaching high temperature, oil<br>
seepage into electrical and/or electronic equipment, dirtying of the engine<br>
compartment and panels, and contamination of the workplace floor.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a base for a filter<br>
cartridge able to overcome the aforesaid problem.<br>
A further object of the invention is to attain said object within the context of<br>
a simple, rational, reliable and economical construction.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Said objects are attained by a base presenting the characteristic elements<br>
indicated in the claims.<br>
In a totally general sense it comprises an upwardly facing engagement<br>
seat for receiving a filter cartridge contained in a cup-shaped sealed<br>
casing and provided with apertures for the entry of the oil to be filtered and<br>
for the exit of the filtered oil. According to the invention, there is<br>
peripherally associated with said seat a salient enveloping element with<br>
which it forms a sort of bowl, from the base of which there branches a<br>
recovery conduit extending to a suitable collection site, such as the engine<br>
oil sump, and intercepted by a check valve, described in detail hereinafter,<br>
the closed or open state of which depends on whether the cartridge and<br>
base are mutually engaged or disengaged respectively.<br><br>
All the objects of the invention are attained by virtue of the aforesaid<br>
means.<br>
In this respect, when in its closed state, i.e. with the cartridge mounted,<br>
said valve enables the oil to undergo normal filtration, whereas when in its<br>
closed state, i.e. with the cartridge removed and with the aid of said<br>
enveloping element, it allows automatic recovery of the oil which would<br>
otherwise spill out of the base.<br>
Preferably the valve is closed and opened automatically, for example by<br>
elastic thrust means interposed between the valve and the base, and<br>
loaded by the action of the cartridge during its mounting.<br>
The characteristics and the constructional merits of the invention will be<br>
apparent from the ensuing detailed description given with reference to the<br>
figures of the accompanying drawings, which illustrate a preferred<br>
embodiment thereof given by way of non-limiting example.<br>
Figure 1 is an axial section through the invention with the cartridge shown<br>
mounted.<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of the check valve of the invention.<br>
Figure 3 is a partial schematic view showing the cartridge during an<br>
intermediate stage of its unscrewing from its seat.<br>
Figure 4 is a view similar to the preceding showing the cartridge removed.<br>
Said figures, and in particular Figures 1, 3 and 4, show the base 1 on<br>
which a seat 2 is provided for mounting a lubricating oil filtration cartridge,<br>
of the disposable type.<br>
In the illustrated example said seat 2 lies horizontally and is open<br>
upwards, but could equally be slightly inclined.<br><br>
The seat 2 is provided with a central conduit 4 for exit of the filtered oil,<br>
and with a concentric annular groove 5 for feeding the oil to be filtered to<br>
the cartridge 3.<br>
A usual arrival conduit for the oil to be fed, not shown for simplicity, and a<br>
recovery conduit 6 of different cross-sections, described hereinafter, open<br>
into said groove 5.<br>
As can be seen, into said central conduit 4 there is screwed a hollow stem<br>
7 which extends beyond the seat 2 with a threaded portion provided for<br>
fixing the overlying cartridge 3.<br>
Said cartridge 3, of known type, comprises a cup-shaped outer casing 8,<br>
to the mouth of which there is seam-joined an annular ring 9 carrying an<br>
underlying gasket 10 for sealing along the outer annular edge of the seat<br>
23 (Figure 1).<br>
Proceeding in the figure from the bottom upwards, said cup 8 internally<br>
contains a centrally holed disc 11, a lip-shaped annular retention gasket<br>
12, a hollow cylindrical filtering body 13, and a thrust spring 14 positioned<br>
between the base of the cup 8 and the upper cover 130 of the filtering<br>
body 13, to elastically clamp the assembly together.<br>
A central anti-emptying tube 15 is also provided, coupled to the perforated<br>
lower cover of the filtering body 13.<br>
The central hole of said disc 11 has a thread to be screwed onto the<br>
hollow stem 7, about said hole said disc 11 presenting a circumferential<br>
series of holes 110 facing the lip gasket 121, which acts as a valve. Said<br>
gasket 12 closes and opens automatically when the engine is stopped and<br>
started respectively.<br><br>
In this respect, during engine operation the oil to be filtered, which is under<br>
pressure, enters the chamber defined by the groove 5, passes through the<br>
holes 110 and into the cartridge by raising the gasket, then passes<br>
through the filtering body 13 and finally reaches the exit conduit 4 via the<br>
tube 15 and the stem 4.<br>
According to the invention, the base 1 comprises an enveloping element<br>
33, said recovery conduit 6 being intercepted by a check valve, or valving<br>
element, indicated by 66.<br>
Said enclosing element 33 consists of a relatively thin enclosing wall<br>
projecting upwards from the base and having its inner surface suitably<br>
spaced from the outer surface of the bottom end of the cartridge 3.<br>
In the illustrated example said wall is integral with the base 1, but could<br>
also be constructed separately of metal or other suitable material, and<br>
then suitably secured to the base 1.<br>
The valving element 66 comprises a cylindrical rod 16 presenting at its<br>
bottom an annular gasket 17, in an intermediate position two diametrically<br>
opposing longitudinal ribs 18 provided lowerly with an elastically<br>
deformable anti-withdrawal tooth 19, and at its top a widened head 20<br>
beyond which there is a coaxial threaded pin 21.<br>
The widened head 20 and the pin 21 are received in the groove 5.<br>
The holed arm of a right-angled appendix 23 is engaged with said pin 21<br>
and fixed thereto by the nut 22, the other arm passing beyond the seat 2<br>
to rest against the ring 9 of the cartridge 3 with a sliding engagement.<br>
Said other arm is shaped to maintain the valve 66 closed when the<br>
cartridge 3 is mounted, and to prevent the valve from rotating when the<br>
cartridge 3 is screwed in or out.<br><br>
With reference to the recovery conduit 6, this connects the groove 5 to a<br>
convenient collection point, for example the engine oil sump. It comprises<br>
(see Figures 1, 3 and 4) a lower smaller diameter portion with which it<br>
sealedly engages the gasket 17, and an upper larger diameter portion<br>
presenting an intermediate circumferential ledge 24.<br>
This latter acts as an abutment for the underlying teeth 19, and as a<br>
support for an overlying thrust spring 25 mounted about the upper part of<br>
the rod 16, below the head 20.<br>
When the cartridge 3 is removed, for example to be replaced, the region<br>
between the groove 5 of the base 1 and the lip gasket 12 is filled with<br>
unfiltered oil.<br>
As the unscrewing of the cartridge 3 proceeds, it rises from the seat 2 and<br>
is followed by the valving element 66 by the effect of the thrust of the<br>
spring 25.<br>
When there is no longer a seal between the cartridge 3 and seat 2, the oil<br>
contained between this latter and the lip gasket 12 seeps to the outside of<br>
the cartridge 3 and is distributed uniformly on the flat surface bounded by<br>
the wall 33 (see Figure 3).<br>
When the cartridge 3 has been completely unscrewed it can be removed<br>
(see Figure 4), the oil lying above the seat 2, within the groove 5, and in<br>
the top of the recovery conduit 6 then discharging into the engine oil sump.<br><br>
