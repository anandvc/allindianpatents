The present invention relates to a ventilation system for a car window. <br>
As a known car window ventilation system of such a type, there have been a detachable car ventilation system in which a window panel integrally molded from plastics, or the like, and having a plurality of ventilating holes is put between a door sash frame and an upper end edge of window glass in a car so that natural ventilation to let fresh air in is performed (JP-A-2-220924); a car window ventilation system in which an exhaust fan is merely provided in a slight gap between a door sash frame and an upper end edge of window glass in a car (JP-U-6-55818); and so on.<br>
These car window ventilation systems are, however, of the type in which a window panel is put between a door sash frame and an upper end edge of window glass in a car so that four sides of the window panel are not adjustable. Hence, there is a defect that the systems lack applicability to windows different in size and shape and to different types of cars. Furthermore, air exhausting only by means of a fan without use of natural ventilation to let fresh air in involves a defect that the capacity of ventilation is often insufficient.<br>
In any of the related art, known ventilation systems, the ventilating member is constituted by a single layer filter. Hence, there is an inconvenience of invasion of dust or rainwater. Furthermore, the known ventilation systems were configured so as to be easily subjected to mischief from the outside. In addition, there was a risk that something might be thrown into the car from the outside through such airflow holes because of the shape of airflow holes in the related-art ventilating members.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a ventilation system for a car window which is configured such that the system can be widely applied to car windows different in size and shape or different types of cars; which is configured such that members such as a fan unit, etc. can be used in various combinations as constituent members of the system in accordance with a ventilating function so that the system can be flexibly adapted to user's option and dust, rainwater, or the like, can be prevented from invading the car from the outside directly; and in which the quantity of air flowing through airflow members can be adjusted.<br>
The foregoing object is achieved by the invention defined in Claims.<br>
According to the present invention, the car window ventilation system can be adapted to user' s option as to whether only a natural ventilation function is used to let fresh air in or a fan unit is additionally used to perform forced ventilation, whether a housing is provided with sunshade and weatherproof eaves or not, and whether a solar battery is used or a battery built in the car is used for actuating the fan unit. Furthermore, when blocking plates which are portions for connecting a car window frame and an upper edge of window glass to each other (that is, adjustable blocking plates substantially as thick as the window glass) are formed by simply cutting a blocking plate material of transparent acrylic resin, or the like, having a predetermined thickness into predetermined contours while one and the same body housing is always used in the ventilation system, the ventilation system can be generally applied to windows different in size and shape and to cars different in types. Hence, the ventilation system can be attached to various types of cars because the ventilation system is not formed as an exclusive product which is produced by use of an expensive mold as in the related art and which can<br><br>
be applied to no car type but a specific car type. It is, however,<br>
Â« a matter of course that final contour finishing of the blocking<br>
plates is performed by a cutting machine placed in a car window<br>
ventilation system maker, a car repair shop, or the like,<br>
because general users cannot finish such blocking plates.<br>
Furthermore, when a cover plate is provided on a cover frame to which the airflow members are attached so as to be able to be opened/closed to adjust the quantity of air flowing through all the airflow members, a ventilating function can be given to the car window so that the quantity of air flowing through the car window can be adjusted.<br>
Although the following embodiments show the case where the car window ventilation system according to the present invention is attached to a side door of a car, it is a matter of course that the ventilation system having the same configuration as described above can be applied also to a rear window of the car.

Figs. 7(a) to 7(e) show a car window ventilation system provided with a cover plate but with no fan unit according to a third embodiment of the present invention. Figs . 8 (a) to 8 (e) and Figs. 9(a) to 9(d) show a car window ventilation system provided both with a cover plate and with a fan unit according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. Figs. 10(a) and 10(b) show a cover frame to which the innermost airflow member is attached. Figs. 11(a) and 11(b) show a cover plate which is fitted into the cover frame so that the quantity of air flowing through all airflow members can be adjusted.<br>
Figs. 1 (a) , 2(a), 7 (a) and 8 (a) show a state in which the car window ventilation system according to the present invention is installed in a location in which window glass 6 of a car is retracted to a predetermined retreat position, that is, in a location in which an upper edge 6a of the window glass 6 is moved down to a position shown, for example in Fig. 1 (a) . The reference numeral 1 designates an upper edge of a window frame; 2, a lower edge of the window frame; 3, a rear edge of the window frame; 4, an inclined edge of the window frame; and 5, a front edge of the window frame.<br>
Incidentally, the configuration of Fig. 9(a) showing a central section of the car window ventilation system according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention is applied also to the car window ventilation system according to the third embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 7(a) except the fan unit.<br>
The reference numeral 11 designates a body housing. A ventilation opening 11a is provided in the center of the body housing 11. A groove lib for the blocking plate A 13 is formed<br><br>
in the rear side of the body housing 11. A groove l1C for the blocking plate B 14 is formed in the front edge of the body housing 11. A groove lid for the window glass 6 is formed in the lower edge of the body housing 11. A groove 11'e for the blocking plate B 14 is formed in an inclined edge of a front portion 11' of the body housing 11 which extends forward substantially in parallel with the contour of an inclined edge of the window frame. A groove 11'd for the window glass 6 is formed in the horizontal lower edge of the body housing 11. Hence, the body housing 11 inclusive of the front portion 11' is shaped like a tadpole or a half of spectacles as a whole. On this occasion, the lower edge of the body housing 11 is disposed at a distance from the lower edge 2 of the window frame of the car so as to be located considerably above the lower edge 2. This is because it is made possible that the car window ventilation system according to the present invention is installed in any window frame only by changing the contours of the blocking plates A 13 and B 14 without necessity of deforming the body housing 11 even in the case where the window frame is different in size and shape from the window frame having the contour shown in Fig. 1(a).<br>
The left end of the rear blocking plate A 13 is fitted into a window glass-retracting groove formed in the rear edge 3 of the window frame. The right end of the blocking plate A 13 is fitted into the rear groove 11b of the body housing 11. As is obvious from Fig. 3(b) or Fig. 4(b), a stopper having a step portion in a range of engagement with the blocking plate A 13 can be preferably fitted into the groove 11b. Hence, the distance between the leading end of the blocking plate A 13 having a step portion in the range of engagement with the stopper and the bottom of the groove 11b can be preferably adjusted. That is, the distance between the leading end of the blocking plate A 13 and the stopper can be adjusted in a range of size S. This adjustment is performed by swinging the blocking plate<br><br>
A 13 in directions of the arrows A and B in Fig. 1 (a) or in Fig. (2a) so that the blocking plate A 13 goes into and out of the groove 11b of the body housing 11. The blocking plate A 13 is shaped like a right-angled triangle as a whole. The blocking plate A 13 is finally fixed to the body housing 11 by operating a tool in a facing llf to connect fixing screws 15, 15 into nuts, respectively, which are not shown in detail but buried in a facing llf. On this occasion, a blocking shim 13a as a final gap blocking member can be put between the body housing 11 and the blocking plate A 13.<br>
On the other hand, the left end of the front blocking plate B 14 is fitted into the front groove 11cof the body housing 11. Other ends of the front blocking plate B 14 is fitted into the window glass groove of the inclined edge 4 of the window frame, the window glass groove of the front edge 5 of the window frame and the horizontal groove 11'd and inclined groove 11'e of the body housing 11. As is obvious from Fig. 3(c) or 4(c), the left end of the front blocking plate B 14 is fitted into the front groove 11cof the body housing 11 as follows. A stopper having a step portion in a range of engagement with the blocking plate B 14 can be preferably fitted into the groove lie. Hence, the distance between the leading end of the blocking plate B 14 having a step portion in the range of engagement with the stopper and the bottom of the groove 11ccan be preferably adjusted. That is, the distance between the leading end of the blocking plate B 14 and the stopper can be adjusted in a range of size S', This adjustment is performed by swinging the blocking plate B 14 in directions of the arrows A^ and B' in Fig. 1(a) or Fig. 2(a) so that the blocking plate B 14 goes into and out of the groove 11cof the body housing 11. The blocking plate B 14 is shaped like a knife handle as a whole. The blocking plate B 14 is finally fixed to the body housing 11 by operating a tool in a facing llg' to connect fixing screws 15', 15' into nuts, respectively, which are not shown<br><br>
in detail but buried in a facing llg. On this occasion, a blocking shim 14a as a final gap blocking member can be put between the body housing 11 and the blocking plate B 14.<br>
The facings llf, llf ', llg and llg' are closed upward and opened downward in Fig. 1(a) so that the fitting states of the blocking plates A 13 and B 14 to the body housing 11 are kept when the fixing screws 15 and 15' are slightly loosened to adjust the state of fitting of the blocking plates A 13 and B 14 to the body housing 11.<br>
The window glass 6 of the car is fitted into the lower groove lid of the body housing 11 as follows. In the condition that the window glass 6 of the car is entirely pulled into a groove of the lower edge 2 of the window frame, the blocking plates A 13 and B 14 as well as the body housing 11 with a rubber seal 17 fitted into the groove lid in advance are fitted (in a temporarily assembled state) into the window glass grooves of the rear and upper edges 3 and 1 of the window frame and the inclined and front edges 4 and 5 of the window frame. Then, the fixing screws 15 and 15' are fastened to nuts which are not shown in detail but buried in the facings llf and llg, respectively, so that the blocking plates A 13 and B 14 are finally perfectly fixed to the body housing 11. Then, a car window glass opening/closing handle is operated to move up the car window glass 6 from the lower edge of the window frame so that the upper edge of the window glass 6 is pressed against the rubber seal 17 in the lower groove lid of the body housing 11. In this condition, a window glass-locking glass retainer 35, which is attached to the front portion 11' of the body housing 11 by a pin 36 as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 5 to prevent failure such as vibration, or the like, from occurring between the front portion 11' of the body housing 11 inclusive of the front blocking plate B 14 and the window glass 6, is operated so that a clamp member 37 of the glass retainer 35 locks the window glass 6 at the front portion 11' of the body housing 11 by the force<br><br>
of a compression spring 38. As shown in Figs. 1(a) and 2(a), such window glass-locking glass retainers 35 can be further provided in a plurality of places in the body housing 11. For example, in Figs. 1(a) and 2(a), such glass retainers 35 are further provided in two places in the body housing 11.<br>
To prevent the car window ventilation system according to the present invention from being stolen or destroyed, a circuit for providing electric bridge connection between the blocking plates A 13/B 14 (or 14') and the grooves llb/llc of the body housing 11 may be provided with an alarm connected to a midpoint of the circuit so that the alarm can issue an alarm sound when the alarm circuit is interrupted.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3(a) and 4(a), in the car window ventilation system according to the present invention, an inner chamber is formed so as to be surrounded by an inner wall 11a' which is continued to the ventilation opening 11a of the body housing 11 through a step portion and which has a larger opening cross-sectional area than that of the ventilation opening 11a. An airflow member 21 made of a perforated metal is interchangeably provided while being guided by the inner wall 11a' . Another airflow member 20 made of a perforated metal is interchangeably provided through a gap member 22 so as to follow the airflow member 21. A large number of airflow holes 20a in the airflow member 20 and a large number of airflow holes 21a in the airflow member 21 are arranged eccentrically in the whole surfaces of the perforated metals 21 and 20 so that the large number of airflow holes 20a are not aligned with the large number of airflow holes 21a in Fig. 1(a) . Hence, a mesh plate 19 is used as an airflow member provided through a gap member 22 so that dust or rainwater is prevented from reaching the mesh plate 19 from the outside of the car directly. The mesh plate 19 may be replaced by a paper filter, a synthetic fiber filter, or the like, which is permeable to air. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 3(a) and 4(a), three layers of airflow members are<br><br>
arranged. Further, a ventilation substrate 18 is disposed in the inner side than the mesh plate 19. The ventilation' substrate 18 is fixed to the body housing 11 by screws 23 through bores 18c. The ventilation substrate 18 has a large number of airflow openings 18b because the ventilation substrate 18 also needs to have an airflow function. It is a matter of course that the ventilation substrate 18 has a ventilation opening 18a having the same size and shape as that of the ventilation opening 11a of the body housing 11. The large number of airflow openings 18b are used for airflow and also used for fixing the ventilation substrate 18 to the body housing 11 when several operation knobs 24 used for assembling/disassembling the ventilation substrate 18 with/from the body housing 11 or for lifting the car window ventilation system as a whole are fastened with corresponding nuts 25 respectively.<br>
Drain holes 26 and 26' which are formed in the inner wall 11a' so as to be opened to the outside of the body housing 11 are provided in a lower region of the body housing 11 than the inner chamber surrounded by the inner wall 11a' continued to the ventilation opening 11a of the body housing 11 in the condition that the body housing 11 is attached to the window.<br>
The second and the fourth embodiments shown in Figs. 2 (a) and 8 (a) are different from the first and the third embodiments shown in Figs. 1(a) and 7(a) in the points that sunshade and weatherproof eaves 12 constituted by eaves elements 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d and 12e are provided in the body housing 11 and that a fan unit 30 is provided as a forced ventilation unit.  It is, however, a matter of course that various combinations of constituent members of the ventilation system can be made as embodiments other than the second and the fourth embodiments because the present invention is characterized in that various combinations of constituent members of the ventilation system can be made at user's option, as described in the beginning of this specification. The sunshade and weatherproof eaves 12 are<br><br>
partially shown also in Fig. 5. The fan unit 30 is further shown in Figs. 2 (a) , 4 (a) , 8 (a) and 9 (a) . The fan unit 30 is attached to the inside of the ventilation substrate 18. A fan-mounting plate 33 serving also as an airflow plate is fixed at an inner end of a fan housing 31 attached to the ventilation substrate 18. A vane wheel 32 is mounted on a main shaft in the airflow and fan-mounting plate 33 so as to be rotatable. The fan unit 30 is mounted at user's option.<br>
Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing a system for actuating the fan unit 30 in the second embodiment of the present invention. A current obtained by photoelectric conversion in a solar panel<br>
41	which can be attached to the inside of front glass of the car is supplied to a condenser 42. A current from the condenser<br>
42	flows into a change-over switch 43 while prevented from flowing back. A current from the change-over switch 43 flows in a rechargeable battery 44, so that larger electric power than necessary is stored in the battery 44. A current from the battery 44 flows in the fan unit 30 through a temperature sensor<br>
(for example, thermostat) 45 and a timer 46 which can be set to determine the running time of the fan. When the inside room of the car is cooled to a temperature of not higher than the temperature set in the temperature sensor 45 in advance, a signal from the temperature sensor 45 is returned to the change-over switch 43 so that the change-over switch 43 is operated by a cigarette lighter plug socket, or the like, in the car through a lead wire connected from the change-over switch 43 to the latter.  In this case, electric power generated by the solar panel can be used for purposes other than the purpose of operating the car window ventilation system, that is, the electric power can be used for charging a battery 47 originally built in the car to supplement the car battery with the electric power.<br>
Other than the method shown in the block diagram of Fig. 6, there is, for example, a case where a cigarette lighter power<br><br>
supply is used in the condition that an attachment plug is attached into a cigarette lighter plug socket not shown but provided in the car. In such a case, electric power from the cigarette lighter power supply can be supplied to the fan unit. Further, there is a case where the car window ventilation system according to the present invention is provided in a solar car. In such a case, electric power from a solar generator of the solar car can be supplied to the fan unit.<br>
Figs. 7(a) to 7(e) show the third embodiment of the present invention. Figs. 8(a) to 8(e) and Figs. 9(a) to 9(d) show the fourth embodiment of the present invention. Figs. 10(a) and 10 (b) and Figs. 11(a) and 11 (b) are common to the third and fourth embodiments. The reference numeral 11 designates a body housing. A ventilation opening 11a is provided in the center of the body housing 11. A groove 11b for the blocking plate A 13 is formed in the rear side of the body housing 11. A groove 11cfor the blocking plate B 14' is formed in the front edge of the body housing 11. A groove lid for the window glass 6 is formed in the lower edge of the body housing 11. A groove 11' e for the blocking plate B 14 ' is formed in an inclined upper edge of a front portion 11' of the body housing 11 which extends forward substantially in parallel with the contour of an inclined edge of the window frame. A groove 11' d for the window glass 6 is formed in the horizontal lower edge of the body housing 11. Hence, the body housing 11 inclusive of the front portion 11' is shaped like a tadpole or a half of spectacles as a whole. On this occasion, the lower edge of the body housing 11 is disposed at a distance from the lower edge 2 of the window frame of the car so as to be located considerably above the lower edge 2. This is because it is made possible that the car window ventilation system according to the present invention is installed in any window frame only by changing the contours of the blocking plates A 13 and B 14 ' without necessity of deforming the body housing 11 even in the case where the window frame is<br><br>
different in size and shape from the window frame having the<br>
Â«<br>
contour shown in Figs. 7(a) and 8(a)-<br>
The window glass 6 of the car is fitted into the lower groove lid of the body housing 11 as follows. In the condition that the window glass 6 of the car is entirely pulled into a groove of the lower edge 2 of the window frame, the blocking plates A 13 and B 14' as well as the body housing 11 with a rubber seal 17 fitted into the groove lid in advance are fitted (in a temporarily assembled state) into the window glass grooves of the rear and upper edges 3 and 1 of the window frame and the inclined and front edges 4 and 5 of the window frame. Then, the fixing screws 15 and 15' are fastened to nuts which are not shown in detail but buried in the facings llf and llg, respectively, so that the blocking plates A 13 and B 14' are finally perfectly fixed to the body housing 11. Then, a car window glass opening/closing handle is operated to move up the car window glass 6 from the lower edge of the window frame so that the upper edge of the window glass 6 is pressed against the rubber seal 17 in the lower groove lid of the body housing 11. In this condition, a window glass-locking glass retainer 35, which is attached to the front portion 11' of the body housing 11 by a pin 36 as shown in Figs. 7(a), 8(a) and 5 to prevent failure such as vibration, or the like, from occurring between the front portion 11' of the body housing 11 inclusive of the front blocking plate B 14' and the window glass 6, is operated so that a clamp member 37 of the glass retainer 35 locks the window glass 6 at the front portion 11' of the body housing 11 by the force of a compression spring 38. As shown in Figs. 7 (a) and 8 (a), such window glass-locking glass retainers 35 can be further provided in a plurality of places in the body housing 11. For example, in Figs. 7(a) and 8(a), such glass retainers 35 are provided in two places in the body housing 11. In Figs. 7 (a) and 8 (a) , such a glass retainer 35 is provided in one place in the front portion 11' of the body housing 11.  In Figs. 7(e)<br><br>
and 8(e), the front blocking plate B 14' is fitted into the inclined groove ll'e of the front portion 11' of the body housing 11 in the condition that the front portion 11' rides on the window glass 6 by the groove 11'd. The front portion 11' is fixed to the front blocking plate B 14' by screws 11'A provided in three places.<br>
Referring to Fig. 9(a), in the car window ventilation system according to the present invention, an inner chamber is formed so as to be surrounded by an inner wall 11a' which is continued to the ventilation opening 11a of the body housing 11 through a step portion and which has a larger opening cross-sectional area than that of the ventilation opening 11a. An airflow member 21 made of a perforated metal is interchangeably provided while being guided by the inner wall 11a' . Another airflow member 20 made of a perforated metal is interchangeably provided through a gap member 22 so as to follow the airflow member 21. A large number of airflow holes 20a in the airflow member 20 and a large number of airflow holes 21a in the airflow member 21 are arranged eccentrically in the whole surfaces of the perforated metals 21 and 20 so that the large number of airflow holes 20a are not aligned with the large number of airflow holes 21a in Fig. 7(a) . Hence, a mesh plate 19 is used as an airflow member provided through a gap member 22 so that dust or rainwater is prevented from reaching the mesh plate 19 from the outside of the car directly. The mesh plate 19 may be replaced by a paper filter, a synthetic fiber filter, a filter having airflow perorations 19a, or the like, which is permeable to air. Further, as shown in Figs . 9 (a) , 9(b) and 10 (a) through 11(b), a cover frame 52 of a cover unit 51 is attached to the body housing 11 so as to be guided by the inner wall 11a' through the gap member 22. For example, an airflow member 55 made from wire netting or the like and located so as to follow the airflow members 21, 20 and 19 is attached to the cover frame 52. An opening 54 is formed in the center of the cover frame 52. A<br><br>
cover plate 56 is provided on the cover frame 52 so as to block<br>
â¢<br>
the opening 54. The cover plate 56 can be slid on a step portion 53 of the cover frame 52 so as to be opened/closed by the manipulation of a knob 62. To frictionally fit the cover plate 56 to the cover frame 52 in any open position, pins 60 urged to be pressed by springs 61 are provided in holes 57, 57 on the left and right sides of the cover plate 56 respectively. Hence, the pins 60 are frictionally fitted to the side walls of the step portions 53 of the cover frame 52. The cover plate 56 is made slidable on the step portions 53 of the cover frame 52, while sealed by a seal ring 58 fitted in a seal groove 59 formed in the cover plate 56, and made to be fixed in any position. The knob 62 in the lower portion of the cover plate 56 is manipulated so that the cover plate 56 is locked with the cover frame 52 by tightening of a lock bolt 65 attached to the ventilation substrate 18 and having an end reaching the cover plate 56. As a result, the quantity of air flowing through the opening 54 of the cover frame 52, that is, all the airflow members 21, 20, 19 and 55 can be adjusted to any value inclusive of zero.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 9(a), four layers of airflow members are arranged. Further, a ventilation substrate 18 is disposed in the inner side than the mesh plate 19. The ventilation substrate 18 is fixed to the body housing 11 by screws 23 through bores 18c.
