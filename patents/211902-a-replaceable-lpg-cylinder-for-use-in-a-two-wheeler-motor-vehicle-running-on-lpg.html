				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a replaceable LPG cylinder for use in a two wheeler motor vehicle running on LPG.<br>
Use of LPG as fuel for propulsion of automobiles offers advantages of low running costs, lower emissions, longer engine life and lower maintenance costs when compared to their gasoline/diesel counterparts. LPG as fuel has also been found to be non-carcinogenic, non-lead bearing. It has further been found that leaner mixtures of LPG can be combusted and higher compression ratios can be obtained due to the higher octane number and because the fuel is in gaseous form.<br>
LPG is being commercially used in automobiles in Australia, Japan, USA, Holland, Italy, New Zealand among other countries.<br>
Efforts are being made in India, which has a huge motor vehicle population, for use of LPG in automobiles, with adequate safeguards. The LPG commercially available in India is a mixture of butane  and  propane with  traces  of  other<br><br>
hydrocarbons.<br>
This invention proposes a replaceable LPG cylinder as aforesaid, which is user-friendly in that it is capable of being easily installed in a housing provided therefor, the housing itself being immovably locatable in the vehicle. The cylinder, when depleted, can easily be replaced by a fresh cylinder.<br>
The cylinder is so constructed that it can be rigidly attached to the housing,  when located within it, so that it is securely installed in place.<br>
Various features of the cylinder proposed herein will be apparent from the following further description.<br>
According to this invention, the replaceable LPG cylinder for use in a two wheeler motor vehicle running on LPG, comprises a foot-ring rigidly attached to the bottom of the cylinder; a diametvical member rigidly attached to the foot-ring, said member being fitted with a non-rotatable  nut,  such that the  cylinder  is<br><br>
accommodable in a housing, provided for the vehicle, the housing having a threaded stud rigidly attached to its base, said stud being threadedly engageable with the said nut. The cylinder proposed herein will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which Illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of this invention, wherein<br>
Fig.  1 illustrates  the embodiment in elevation<br>
  Fig.  2 illustrates the embodiment in bottom  plan view<br>
Fig.  3  illustrates  the  embodiment   installed within the housing<br>
and<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates details of the fastening stud and nut.<br>
The LPG cylinder C is accommodable within a housing H provided for the two wheeler vehicle running on LPG.<br>
The  cylinder  C comprises a foot-ring  F  rigidly<br><br>
attached to the bottom J of the cylinder C. A diametral member D is rigidly attached to the foot-rinq F, said member D being fitted with a non-rotatable nut N threadedly engageable with a threaded stud T rigidly attached to the base M of the housing H.<br>
The outlet O of the cylinder is provided with a coupling R for connection to the LPG supply pipeline P of the vehicle, the coupling being disposed horizontally to save housing space.<br>
During installation of the cylinder C in the housing, the cylinder is more securely held in place by a cross-arm A which is clamped down on the top Q of the cylinder and bolted in position at G.<br>
The cylinder C, thus Installed, within the housing can easily be removed for being replaced by a fresh cylinder.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of  the<br><br>
features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the cylinder proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A replaceable LPG cylinder for use in a two<br>
wheeler motor vehicle running on LPG, said<br>
cylinder comprising a foot-ring rigidly attached<br>
to the bottom of the cylinder; diametvical member<br><br>
rigidly attached to the foot-ring, said member being fitted with a non-rotatable nut, such that the cylinder is accommodable in a housing,  provided for the vehicle, the housing having a threaded stud rigidly attached to its base, said stud being threadedly engageable with the said nut.<br>
2.	A replaceable LPG cylinder for use in a two wheeler motor vehicle running on LPG as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the outlet of the cylinder is provided with a coupling for connection to the LPG supply pipeline of the vehicle, the coupling being disposed horizontally.<br>
3.	A replaceable LPG cylinder for use in a two wheeler motor vehicle running on LPG substantially as herein described with reference to, and as<br><br>
illustrated in, the accompanying drawings.</td>
