DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[012] Reference will now be made in detail to implementations and embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
[013] FIG. 1A shows a conventional RGB stripe structure on panel 100 for an Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Display (AMLCD) having thin film transistors (TFTs) 116 to activate individual colored subpixels - red 104, green 106 and blue 108 subpixels respectively. As may be seen, a red, a green and a blue subpixel form a repeating group of subpixels 102 that comprise the panel<br>
[014] As also shown, each subpixel is connected to a column line (each driven by a column driver 110) and a row line (e.g. 112 and 114). In the field of AMLCD panels, it is Imown to drive the panel with a dot inversion scheme to reduce crosstalk or flicker. FIG. 1A depicts one particular dot inversion scheme - i.e. 1x1 dot inversion - that is indicated by a "+"<br><br>
and a "-" polarity given in the center of each subpixel. Each row line is typically connected to a gate (not shown in BIG. 1A) of TFT 116. Mage data - delivered via the column tines - are typically connected to the source of each TFT. Image data is written to the panel a row at a time and is given a polarity bias scheme as indicated herein as either ODD ("0") or EVEN ("E") schemes. As shown, row 112 is being written with ODD polarity scheme at a given time while row 114 is being written with EVEN polarity scheme at a next time. The polarities alternate ODD and EVEN schemes a row at a time in mis 1x1 dot inversion scheme.<br>
[015] FIG. IB depicts another conventional ROB stripe panel having another dot inversion scheme - i.e. 1x2 dot inversion. Here, the polarity scheme changes over the course of two rows - as opposed to every row, as in Ixl dot inversion. In both dot inversion schemes, a few observations are noted: (1) in 1x1 dot inversion, every two physically adjacent subpixels (in bom the horizontal and vertical direction) are of different polarity; (2) in 1x2 dot inversion, every two physically adjacent subpixels hi the horizontal direction are of different polarity; (3) across any given row, each successive colored subpixel has an opposite polarity to its neighbor. Thus, for example, two successive red subpixels along a row will be either (+,-} or (-,+). Of course, in 1x1 dot inversion, two successive red subpixels along a column will have opposite polarity, whereas in 1x2 dot inversion, each group of two successive red subpixels will have opposite polarity. This changing of polarity decreases noticeable visual effects that occur with particular images rendered upon an AMI-CD panel.<br>
[016] FIG. 2 shows a panel comprising a repeat subpixel grouping 202, as further described in the '353 application. As may be seen, repeat subpixel grouping 202 is an eight subpixel repeat group, comprising a checkerboard of red and blue subpixels with two columns of reduced-area green subpixels in between. If the standard 1x1 dot inversion scheme is applied to a panel comprising such a repeat grouping (as shown in FIG. 2), then it becomes apparent that the property described above for RGB striped panels (namely, that successive colored pixels in a row and/or column have different polarities) is now violated. This condition may cause a number of visual defects noticed on the panel - particularly when certain image patterns are dispkyed. This observation also occurs with other novel subpixel repeat grouping - for example, the subpixel repeat grouping in FIG, 1 of die '352 application - and other repeat groupings that are not an odd number of repeating subpixels across a row. Thus, as the traditional RGB striped panels have three such repeating subpixels in its repeat group (namely, R, G and B), these traditional panels do not necessarily violate the above noted conditions. However, the repeat grouping of FIG. 2 in the present application has four (i.e. an even<br><br>
number) of subpixels in its repeat group across a row (e.g. R, G, B, and G). It will be appreciated that the embodiments described herein are equally applicable to all such even modulus repeat groupings.<br>
[017] To prevent visual degradation and other problems within AMLCDs, not only must the polarity of data line transitions be randomized along each select line, but the polarity of data line transitions must also be randomized also for each color and locality within the display. While this randomization occurs naturally with RGB triplet color sub-pixels in combination with commonly-used alternate column-inversion data driver systems, this is harder to accomplish when an even-number of sub-pixels are employed along row lines.<br>
[01 8] In one even modulo design embodiment, rows are formed from a combination of smaller green pixels and less-numerous-but-larger red and blue pixels. Normally, the polarity of data line transitions is reversed on alternate data lines so that each pixel is capacitively coupled about equally to the data lines on either side of it This way, these capacitor-induced transient errors are about equal and opposite and tend to cancel one another out on the pixel itself. However in this case, the polarity of same-color subpixels is the same and image degradation can occur.<br>
[019]   FIG. 3 shows an even mocialo pixel layout which utilises 2x1 dot inversion.<br>
Vertical   image   degradation   is   eliminated   since   same   color   subpixels   alternate   in   polarity.<br>
Horizontal image degradation due to same-color subpixels is reduced by changing the phase of<br>
dot ii&amp;veraioij periodically. Driver chips 301A teoagh D provide data to die display; the driver outputs are driven V, V,... or -,+»-,+»... The phasing of tbe polarity is shown in FIG. 4 for the first 4 toes of the display. For example, the first column of chip 301B has the phase -,-<br>
.+.+	<br>
[020]  hi one embodiment, a subpixel - bordered on either side by column lines driving<br>
•i<br>
the same polarity at a given time - may suffer a decreased luminance for any given image signal So, two goals are to reduce the number of effected subpixels - and to reduce the image degradation effects of any particular subpixel that cannot avoid having been so impacted. Several techniques in mis application and in other related applications incorporated herein are designed to minimize both the number and the effects of image degraded subpixels.<br>
[021] One such technique is to choose which subpixels are to be degraded, if degradation may not be avoided, hi FIG. 3, the phasing is designed so as to localize the same-polarity occurrence on the circled blue subpixels 302. hi this manner, the polarity of same color subpixels along a row is inverted every two driver chips, which will minimize or<br><br>
eliminate the horizontal image degradation. The periodic circled blue subpixels 302 will be slightly darker (i.e for normally-black LCD) or lighter (i.e. for nonnally-white LCD) than other blue subpixels in the array, but since the eye is not as sensitive to blue luminance changes, the difference should be substantially less visible.<br>
[022] Yet another technique is to add a correction signal to any effected subpixels. If it is known which subpixels are going to have image degradation, then it is possible to add a correction signal to the image data signal. For example, most of the parasitic capacitance mentioned in this and other applications tend to lower the amount of luminance for effected subpixels. It is possible to heuristically or empirically determine (e.g. by testing patterns on particular panels) the performance characteristics of subpixels upon the panel and add back a signal to correct for the degradation. In particular to Figure 3, if it is desired to correct the small error on the circled pixels, then a correction term can be added to the data for the circled blue subpixels.<br>
[023] In yet another embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to design different driver chips that will further abate the effects of image degradation. As shown in FIG. 5, a four-phase clock, for example, is used for polarity inversion. By the use of this pattern, or patterns similar, only the blue subpixels in the array will have the same-polarity degradation. However, since all pixels are equally degraded, it will be substantially less visible to the human eye. If desired, a correction signal can be applied to compensate for the darker or lighter blue subpixels.<br>
[024] These drive waveforms can be generated with a data driver chip that provides for a more complex power-supply switching system than employed in the relatively simple alternate polarity reversal designs. In this two-stage data driver design, the analog signals are generated as they are done now in the first stage. However, the polarity-switching stage is driven with its own cross-connection matrix in the second stage of the data driver to provide the more complex polarity inversions indicated.<br>
[025] Yet another embodiment of the techniques described herein is to localize the image degradation effect on a subset of blue subpixels across the panel in bom the row and column directions. For example, a "checkerboard" of blue subpixels (i.e. slopping every other blue subpixel in either the row and/or column direction) might be used to localize the image degradation signal. As noted above, the human eye - with its decreased sensitivity in blue color spatial resolution - will be less likely to notice the error. It will be appreciated that other<br><br>
subsets of blue subpixels could be chosen to localize the error. Additionally, a different driver chip with four or fewer phases might be possible to drive such a panel<br>
[026] FIG. 6 is yet another embodiment of a panel 600 comprised substantially of a subpixel repeating group 602 of even modulo. In this case, group 602 is comprised of a checkerboard of red 104 and green 106 subpixels interspersed with two columns of blue 108 subpixels. As noted, it is possible (but not mandatory) to have the blue subpixels of smaller width than the red or the green subpixels. As may be seen, two neighboring columns of blue subpixels may share a same column driver through m interconnect 604, possibly with the TFTs of the blue subpixels appropriately remapped to avoid exact data value sharing.<br>
[027] With standard column drivers performing 2x1 dot inversion, it can be seen that blue subpixel column 606 has the same polarity as the column of red and green subpixels to its immediate right Although mis may induce image degradation (which may be compensated for with some correction signal), it is advantageous that the degradation is localized on the dark colored (e.g. blue) subpixel column; and, hence, less visible to the human eye.<br><br><br><br>
