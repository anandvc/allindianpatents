THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"THE COMPOUND PH (3-CI) (5-OCHF2HF2)CH(OH)C(0)-(S)AZE-PAB(2,6-DIF)(OH) OR A PHARMACEUTICALLY ACCEPTABLE SALT THEREOF"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
20 AUG 2007<br>
                            GRANTED  20-8-2007<br>
1<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel pharmaceutically useful compounds, in particular compounds that are, and/or compounds that are metabolised to compounds which are, competitive inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases, especially thrombin, their use as medicaments, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and synthetic routes to their production.<br>
Background<br>
Blood coagulation is the key process involved in both haemostasis (i.e. the prevention of blood loss from a damaged vessel) and thrombosis (i.e. the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel, sometimes leading to vessel obstruction).<br>
Coagulation is the result of a complex series of enzymatic reactions. One of the ultimate steps in this series of reactions is the conversion of the proenzyme prothrombin to the active enzyme thrombin.<br>
Thrombin is known to play a central role in coagulation. It activates platelets, leading to platelet aggregation, converts fibrinogen into fibrin monomers, which polymerise spontaneously into fibrin. polymers, and activates factor XIII, which in turn crosslinks the polymers to form insoluble fibrin. Furthermore, thrombin activates factor V and factor VIII leading to a "positive feedback" generation of thrombin from prothrombin.<br>
2<br><br><br>
WO 03/018551	PCT/SE02/01557<br><br>
By inhibiting the aggregation of platelets and the formation and crosslinking of fibrin, effective inhibitors of thrombin would be expected to exhibit antithrombotic activity. In addition,' antithrombotic activity would be expected to be enhanced by effective inhibition of the positive feedback 5     mechanism.<br>
Prior Art<br>
The early development of low molecular weight inhibitors of thrombin has 10     been described by Claesson in Blood Coagul. Fibrinol. (1994) 5, 411.<br>
Blomback et al (in J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 24, suppl. 107, 59, (1969)) reported thrombin inhibitors based on the amino acid sequence situated around the cleavage site for the fibrinogen Aα chain. Of the amino acid sequences 15 discussed, these authors suggested the tripeptide sequence Phe-Val-Arg (P9-P2-P1, hereinafter referred to as the P3-P2-P1 sequence) would be the most effective inhibitor.<br>
Thrombin inhibitors based on dipeptidyl derivatives with an α,ω)-aminoalkyl 20 guanidine in the PI-position are known from US Patent N° 4,346,078 and. International Patent Application WO 93/11152. Similar, structurally related, dipeptidyl derivatives have also been reported. For example International Patent Application WO 94/29336. discloses compounds with, for example, aminornethyt benzamidines, cyclic aminoalkyl amidines and 25 cyclic aminoalkyl guanidines in the PI-position (Intemational Patent Application WO 97/23499 discloses prodrugs of certain of these compounds); European Patent Application 0 648 780, discloses compounds with, for example, cyclic aminoalkyl guanidines in the PI-position.<br><br>
3<br><br>
WO 03/018551	PCT/SE02/01557<br><br>
Thrombin inhibitors based on peptidyl derivatives, also having cyclic aminoalkyl  guanidines  (e.g.   either 3-  or 4-  aminomethyl-1-amidino-piperidine) in the P1-position are known from European Patent Applications 0 468 231, 0 559 046 and 0 641 779. 5<br>
Thrombin inhibitors based on tripeptidyl derivatives with arginine aldehyde in the P1-position were first disclosed in European Patent Application 0 185 390.<br>
10 More recently, arginine aldehyde-based peptidyl derivatives, modified in the P3-position, have been reported. For example, International Patent Application WO 93/18060 discloses hydroxy acids, European Patent Application 0 526 877 des-amino acids, and European Patent Application 0 542 525 O-methyl mandelic acids in the P3-position. 15<br>
Inhibitors of serine proteases (e.g. thrombin) based on electrophilic ketones in the P1-position are also known. For example, European Patent Application 0 195 212 discloses peptidyl a-keto esters and amides, European Patent Application 0 362 002 fluoroalkylamide ketones, European 20 Patent Application 0 364 344α,β, δ,-triketocompounds, and European Patent Application 0 530 167 a-alkoxy ketone derivatives of arginine in the Pl-position.<br>
Other, structurally different, inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases based 25     on C-terminal boronic acid derivatives of arginine and  isothiouronium analogues thereof are known from European Patent Application 0 293 881.<br>
More recently, thrombin inhibitors based on peptidyl derivatives have been<br>
disclosed in European Patent Application 0 669 317 and International Fatent<br>
30     Applications WO 95/35309, WO 95/23609, WO 96/25426, WO 97/02284,<br>
4<br><br><br><br>
WO 03/018551<br><br>
PCT/SE02/01557<br><br>
WO 97/46577, WO 96/32110, WO 96/31504, WO 96/03374, WO 98/06740, WO 97/49404, WO 98/57932, WO 99/29664, WO 00/35869 and WO 00/42059.<br>
5     In particular, WO 97/02284 and WO 00/42059 disclose thrombin inhibitors with substituted mandelic acids in the P3 position.<br>
However, there remains a need for effective inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases, such as thrombin.   There is also a need for compounds which<br>
10 have a favourable pharmacokinetic profile and are selective in inhibiting thrombin over other serine proteases, in particular those involved in haemostasis. Compounds which exhibit competitive inhibitory activity towards thrombin would be expected to be especially useful as anticoagulants and therefore in the therapeutic treatment of thrombosis and<br>
15     related disorders.<br>

12<br><br>
WO 03/018551	PCT/SE02/01557<br>
between -10°C and room temperature in the presence of an appropriate solvent (e.g. water, tert/-butanol or a mixture thereof). When asymmetric oxidants such as AD-mix-a or AD-mix-p. are employed, this method,may be used to prepare compounds of formula IX that have specific 5 configurations of groups (i.e. R or S) about both of the C-atoms to which the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups are attached.<br>

Compounds of formulae V, VII, VIII, X, XI, XII and azetidine-2-carboxylic acid are either commercially available, are known in the literature, or may<br>
20 be obtained either by analogy with the processes described herein, or by conventional synthetic procedures, in accordance with standard techniques, from readily available starting materials using appropriate reagents and reaction conditions.

25 of the corresponding protected phenols (where the protecting group may be, for example, methyl, allyl, benzyl or tert-butyl) under standard conditions.<br>
Compounds of formula I may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional techniques.<br>

The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable derivatives" of compounds of formula Ia includes pharmaceutically-acceptable salts (e.g. acid addition salts).<br>
5 Alkyloxyaryl groups that R and R may represent comprise an alkyl and an aryl group linked by way of an oxygen atom. Alkylaryl and alkyloxyaryl groups are linked to the rest of the molecule via the alkyl part of those groups, which alkyl parts may (if there is a sufficient number (i.e. three) of carbon atoms) be branched-chain. The aryl parts of alkylaryl and io alkyloxyaryl groups which R2 and R3 may represent, or be substituted by, include carbocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic groups, such as phenyl, naphthyl, pyridinyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiadiazolyl, indolyl and benzofuranyl and the like.<br>
15 Aikyl groups which R and R may represent may be straight-chain or, when there is a sufficient number (i.e. a minimum of three) of carbon atoms, be branched-chain and/or cyclic. Further, when there is a sufficient number (i.e. a minimum of four) of carbon atoms, such alkyl groups may also be part cyclic/acyclic. Such alkyl groups may also be saturated or, when there<br>
20 is a sufficient number (i.e. a minimum of two) of carbon atoms, be unsaturated.<br>
Halo groups with which R2 and R3 may be substituted include fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. 25<br>

Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that, in order to obtain compounds of the invention in an alternative, and, on some occasions, more convenient, 15 manner, the individual process steps mentioned hereinbefore may be performed in a different order, and/or the individual reactions may be performed at a different stage in the overall route (i.e. substituents may be added to and/or chemical transformations performed upon, different intermediates to those mentioned hereinbefore in conjunction with a 20 particular reaction). This may negate, or render necessary, the need for protecting groups.<br>
The type of chemistry involved will dictate the need, and type, of protecting groups as well as the sequence for accomplishing the synthesis. 25<br>
The use of protecting groups is fully described in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", edited by J W F McOmie, Plenum Press (1973),. and "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd edition, T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wutz, Wiley-lnterscience (1999). 30<br>

Medical and pharmaceutical use<br>
Compounds of the invention may possess pharmacological activity as such. 10     Compounds of the invention that may possess such activity include, but are not limited to, compounds of formula I.<br>
However, other compounds of the invention (including compounds of formula  la) may not possess such activity, but may be administered<br>
15 parenterally or orally, and may thereafter be metabolised in the body to form compounds that are pharmacologically active (including, but not limited to, corresponding compounds of formula I). Such compounds (which also includes compounds that may possess some pharmacological activity, but that activity is appreciably lower than that of the "active"<br>
20 compounds to which they are metabolised), may therefore be described as "prodrugs" of the active compounds.<br>
Thus, the compounds of the invention are useful because they possess pharmacological activity, and/or are metabolised in the body following oral 25 or parenteral administration to form compounds which possess pharmacological activity. The compounds of the invention are therefore indicated as pharmaceuticals.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is thus provided the 30     compounds of the invention for use as pharmaceuticals.<br>

Biological Tests<br>
The following test procedures may be employed.<br>
Test  A<br>
Determination of Thrombin Clotting Time (TT)<br>
The inhibitor solution (25 µL) is incubated with plasma (25 µL) for three<br>
minutes.    Human thrombin (T 6769; Sigma Chem. Co or Hematologic<br>
Technologies) in buffer solution, pH 7.4 (25 uL, 4.0 NIH units/mL), is then<br>
added and the clotting time measured in an automatic device (KC 10;<br>
Amelung).<br>
The thrombin clotting time (TT) is expressed as absolute values (seconds) as well as the ratio of TT without inhibitor (TT0) to TT with inhibitor (TT;). The latter ratios (range 1-0) are plotted against the concentration of inhibitor (log transformed) and fitted to sigmoidal dose-response curves according to the equation<br>
y = a/[l+(x/IC50)s] where: a = maximum range, i.e. 1; s = slope of the dose-response curve; and IC50 - the concentration of inhibitor that doubles the clotting time. The calculations are processed on a PC using the software program GraFit Version 3, setting equation equal to: Start at 0, define end = 1 (Erithacus Software, Robin Leatherbarrow, Imperial College of Science, London, UK).<br>
Test B<br>
Determination of Thrombin Inhibition with a Chromogenic, Robotic Assay The thrombin inhibitor potency is measured with a chromogenic substrate method, in a Plato 3300 robotic microplate processor (Rosys AG, CH-8634<br>
31<br><br>
WO 03/018551	PCT/SE02/01557<br><br>
Hombrechtikon, Switzerland), using 96-well, half volume microtitre plates<br>
(Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA; Cat No 3690).   Stock solutions of test<br>
substance in DMSO (72 µL), 0.1-1 mmol/L, are diluted serially 1:3 (24 +<br>
48 µL) with DMSO to obtain ten different concentrations, which are<br>
5     analysed as samples in the assay. 2 uL of test sample is diluted with 124 µL<br>
assay   buffer,   12   uL   of  chromogenic   substrate   solution   (S-2366,<br>
Chromogenix, Molndal, Sweden) in assay buffer and finally 12 uL of α-<br>
thrombin    solution    (Human    α-thrombin,    Sigma    Chemical    Co.    or<br>
Hematologic Technologies) in assay buffer, are added, and the samples<br>
10     mixed.	The    final    assay    concentrations    are:     test    substance<br>
0.00068 - 13.3 µmol/L, S-2366 0.30 mmol/L, a-thrombin 0.020 NlHU/mL. The linear absorbance increment during 40 minutes incubation at 37°C is used for calculation of percentage inhibition for the test samples, as compared to blanks without inhibitor. The IC5o-robotic value, 15 corresponding to the inhibitor concentration which causes 50% inhibition of the thrombin activity, is calculated from a log concentration vs. % inhibition curve.<br>
Test C<br>
20     Determination of the Inhibition Constant Ki for Human Thrombin<br>
Kj-determinations are made using a chromogenic substrate method, performed at 37°C on a Cobas Bio centrifugal analyser (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Residual enzyme activity after incubation of human a-thrombin with various concentrations of test compound is determined at<br>
25     three different substrate concentrations, and is measured as the change in optical absorbance at 405 nm.<br>
Test compound solutions (100 uL; normally in buffer or saline containing<br>
BSA  10 g/L) are mixed with 200 uL  of human  a-thrombin (Sigma<br>
30    Chemical Co) in assay buffer (0.05 mol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.4, ionic strength<br>
32<br><br>
WO 03/018551<br><br>
0.15 adjusted with NaCl) containing BSA (10 g/L), and analysed as samples in the Cobas Bio. A 60 µL sample, together with 20 uL of water, is added to 320 µL of the substrate S-2238 (Chromogenix AB, Molndal, Sweden) in assay buffer, and the absorbance change (AA/min) is monitored. The final 5 concentrations of S-2238 are 16, 24 and 50 µmol/L and of thrombin 0.125 NIHU/mL.<br>
The steady state reaction rate is used to construct Dixon plots, i.e. diagrams of inhibitor concentration vs. l/(∆A/min).    For reversible, competitive 10     inhibitors, the data points for the different substrate concentrations typically form straight lines which intercept at x = -Ki.<br>
Test D<br>
Determination of Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT)<br>
15 APTT is determined in pooled normal human citrated plasma with the reagent PTT Automated 5 manufactured by Stago. The inhibitors are added to the plasma (10 µL inhibitor solution to 90 uL plasma) and incubated with the APTT reagent for 3 minutes followed by the addition of 100 uL of calcium chloride solution (0.025 M) and APTT is determined by use of the<br>
20 coagulation analyser KC10 (Amelung) according to the instructions of the reagent producer.<br>
The clotting time is expressed as absolute values (seconds) as well as the<br>
ratio of APTT without inhibitor (APTT0) to APTT with inhibitor (APTTj). 25     The latter ratios (range 1 -0) are plotted against the concentration of inhibitor<br>
(log transformed) and fitted to sigmoidal dose-response curves according to<br>
the equation<br>
y = a/[l+(x/IC50)s]<br>
where: a = maximum range, i.e. 1; s = slope of the dose-response curve; and 30    IC50 - the concentration of inhibitor that doubles the clotting time.   The<br>
33<br><br>
WO 03/018551	PCT/SE02/01557<br>
calculations are processed on a PC using the software program GraFit Version 3, setting equation equal to: Start at 0, define end = 1 (Erithacus Software, Robin Leatherbarrow, Imperial College of Science, London, UK). IC50APTT is defined as the concentration of inhibitor in human plasma that 5     doubles the Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time.<br>
Test E<br>
Determination of Thrombin Time ex vivo<br>
The inhibition of thrombin after oral or parenteral administration of the<br>
10 compounds of the invention, dissolved in ethanol:SolutolK:water (5:5:90), is examined in conscious rats which, one or two days prior to the experiment, are equipped with a catheter for blood sampling from the carotid artery. On the experimental day blood samples are withdrawn at fixed times after the administration of the compound into plastic rubes<br>
15 containing 1 part sodiuro citrate solution (0.13 mol per L) and 9 parts of blood. The tubes are centrifuged to obtain platelet poor plasma.<br>
50 pL of plasma samples are precipitated with 100 µL of cold acetonitrile. The samples are centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4000 rpm. 75 µL of the 20 supernatant is diluted with 75 µL of 0.2% formic acid. 10 µL volumes of the resulting solutions are analysed by LC-MS/MS and the concentrations of thrombin inhibitor are determined using standard curves.<br>
Test F<br>
25     Determination of Plasma Clearance in Rat<br>
Plasma clearance is estimated in male Sprague Dawley rats. The compound is dissolved in water and administered as a subcutaneous bolus injection at a dose of 4 umol/kg. Blood samples are collected at frequent intervals up to 5 hours after drug administration. Blood samples are centrifuged and plasma<br>
30    is separated from the blood cells and transferred to vials containing citrate<br>

PCT/SE02/01557<br><br><br>
(10% final concentration).   50 uL of plasma samples are precipitated with 100 u-L of cold acetonitrile. The samples are centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4000 rpm.  75 uL of the supernatant is diluted with 75 uL of 0.2% formic acid.  10 uL volumes of the resulting solutions are analysed by LC-MS/MS 5     and the concentrations of thrombin inhibitor are determined using standard curves.  The area under the plasma concentration-time profile is estimated using the log/linear trapezoidal rule and extrapolated to infinite time. Plasma clearance (CL) of the compound is then determined as CL-Dose/AUC 10     The values are reported in mL/min/kg.<br>

Determination of in vitro Stability<br>
Liver microsomes are prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats and human liver<br>
15 samples according to internal SOPs. The compounds are incubated at 37°C at a total microsome protein concentration of 3 mg/mL in a 0.05 mol/L TRIS buffer at pH 7.4, in the presence of the cofactors NADH (2.5 mmol/L) and NADPH (0.8 mmol/L). The initial concentration of compound is 5 or 10 umol/L.  Samples are taken for analysis up to 60 minutes after the start<br>
20 of the incubation. The enzymatic activity in the collected sample is immediately stopped by adding 20% myristic acid at a volume corresponding to 3.3% of the total sample volume. The concentration of compound remaining (FINAL CONC) in the 60 min. sample is determined by means of LCMS using a sample collected at zero time as reference<br>

Arterial Thrombosis Model<br>
Vessel damage is induced by applying ferric chloride (FeCl3) topically to<br>
the carotid artery. Rats are anaesthetised with an intraperitoneal injection of 5     sodium   pentobarbital   (80   mg/kg;   Apoteksbolaget;   Umea,   Sweden),<br>
followed by continuous infusion (12 mg/kg/h) throughout the experiment. Rat body temperature is maintained at 38°C throughout the experiment by external heating.   The experiment starts with a 5 minutes control period. Five minutes  later, human   l25I-fibrinogen (80 kBq;  IM53;  Amersham 10     International, Buckinghamshire, UK) is given intravenously and is used as a marker for the subsequent incorporation of fibrin(ogen) into the thrombus. The proximal end of the carotid artery segment is placed in a plastic tube (6 mm; Silastic®; Dow Corning, MI, USA) opened lengthways, containing FeCl3-soaked (2 uL; 55% w/w; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) filter paper 15     (diameter 3 mm; 1F; Munktell, Grycksbo, Sweden). The left carotid artery is exposed to FeCl3 for 10 minutes and is then removed from the plastic tube and soaked in saline. Fifty minutes later, the carotid artery is removed and   rinsed   in   saline.   Reference   blood   samples   are   also   taken  for determination of blood 125I-activity, 10 minutes after the injection of 125I-20    fibrinogen, and at the end of,the experiment.    The 125I-activity in the reference blood samples and the vessel segment are measured in a gamma counter (1282 Compugamma; LKB Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) on the same day as the experiment is performed. The thrombus size is determined as the amount of    I-activity incorporated in the vessel segment in relation 25     to the    I-activity in the blood (cpm/mg).<br>
