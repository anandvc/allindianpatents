				<td>Device and method for printing containers<br>
The invention relates to a device in accordance with the preamble of Claim 1, 30<br>
or 31 and to a method in accordance with the preamble of Claim 41, 57 or 59 and<br>
in this case especially to a device or respectively a method for applying a print,<br>
preferably in multiple colours, directly onto the outer surfaces of containers.<br>
Containers in terms of the invention are, in particular, packaging means, in the<br>
form of containers, for the most varied types of liquid products and in this case, in<br>
particular, also bottles or bottle-type containers or cans or can-like containers.<br>
Printing inks in terms of the invention are those colours or inks, in particular, in<br>
lightly viscous liquid form that can be processed with print heads that are digitally<br>
actuatable and operate according to the ink jet print head principle.<br>
Consequently, print heads in terms of the invention are, in particular, print heads<br>
that have a plurality of print nozzles for discharging the printing ink, for example<br>
in at least one row, and that are individually actuatable for discharging the<br>
printing ink and, for this purpose, have a print generating element at the<br>
respective nozzle opening, for example in the form of an electrode of a piezo<br>
element.<br>
Devices for printing containers by using print heads that operate according to the<br>
ink jet print head principle and with relative movement between the print heads<br>
and the respective containers are known. In the case of a known device (WO<br>
2004/009360), during the printing process the containers are each positioned on<br>
a mandrel in the form of a container support. A plurality of print heads are<br>
provided distributed about the mandrel, with which print heads, when the mandrel<br>
is rotated, a coloured printed image, consisting of a plurality of colour sets, is<br>
applied to the respective container. The mandrels are provided on a rotatably<br>
driven transport element, with which, during the printing, the containers are<br>
moved on a transport section formed between a container inlet and a container<br>
outlet.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a device with which, at high output, it is<br>
possible to print containers with a high-quality print formed by at least one printed<br>
image. A device according to Claim 1, 30 or 31 is realized to achieve this object.<br>
A method for printing containers is the object of Claim 41, 57 or 59.<br>
In the case of the invention, the containers are printed on their outside surfaces<br>
by applying the printing ink with the print heads directly onto the outer surface of<br>
the container or with a transfer print method by using transfer elements or<br>
transfer pads onto which the respective printed image is applied with the print<br>
heads and is then transferred onto the containers.<br>
Further developments, advantages and application possibilities of the invention<br>
are produced from the following description of exemplary embodiments and from<br>
the Figures. In this case, all described and/all graphically represented features,<br>
individually on their own or in arbitrary combination, are in principle objects of the<br>
invention, independent of their summary in the claims or their dependency. The<br>

Figure 22 shows, shows a schematic representation and part representation in<br>
each case, of different operating states of the device in Figures 20 and 21, in<br>
various positions.<br>
In Figures 1 - 3 the reference 1 is given to a device for printing containers 2 in<br>
multiple colours on their outer or outside surface and, in this case, preferably on<br>
a region of the container outside surface that is realized in a rotationally-<br>
symmetrical manner with reference to the container axis, for example on a<br>
circular cylindrically shaped or frustum-shaped or substantially circular<br>
cylindrically shaped or frustum-shaped region of the outer surface of the<br>
container.<br>
The containers 2 are supplied to the device 1 by means of a conveyor, identified<br>
schematically in the Figures by the reference 3, standing upright, i.e. oriented<br>
with their container axes in the vertical direction and in a single-track container<br>
flow in the direction of transport specified by the arrow T and after they pass a<br>
corona tunnel 4 and a separating screw 5 they reach a rotor 7 of the device 1. At<br>
the periphery of the rotor 7, which is rotatably driveable about a vertical machine<br>
axis MA in the direction of the arrow R, printing stations 8 are formed at regular<br>
angular spacings offset about said machine axis, said printing stations<br>
comprising in each case substantially a container support 9, in the form of a<br>
turntable that is rotatable in a controlled manner about an axis parallel to the<br>
machine axis, a printing group 10 and a device 11 for drying and/or setting the<br>
printing ink. Each printing group 10, in the specific embodiment represented,<br>
includes four print heads. 10.1 - 10.4 for generating various colour sets of a<br>
multiple colour print or printed image and another print head 10.5 for flat printing<br>
or applying a transparent sealing or protective coating, for example a covering<br>
finish onto the printed image generated with the print heads 10.1 - 10.4.<br>
The print heads 10.1 - 10.4 are digitally actuatable print heads of the ink jet print<br>
head type, for example print heads that can be obtained commercially under the<br>
reference "XAAR" or "Xaar500". The print heads 10.1 - 10.5 each comprise,<br>
correspondingly, a housing with a plurality of individually actuatable print nozzles<br>
for discharging the printing ink in the distribution and quantity corresponding to<br>
the respective printed image or colour set on the background to be printed on ,<br>
i.e. in the present case onto the outer surface of the container to be printed on.<br>
The print nozzles, oriented with their axes horizontally or substantially<br>
horizontally, are positioned on each print head 10.2 -10.5 in at least one row<br>
parallel or substantially parallel to the vertical machine axis MA. The discharging<br>
of the printing ink is achieved, for example, through corresponding actuation of<br>
electrodes or of piezo elements in the print heads 10.1 -10.5, for example at an<br>
actuating frequency of up to 50 kHz and a relative movement between the<br>
respective print head and the surface to be printed of 560 mm/second. The<br>
number of print nozzles per print head is, for example, in the range of 500 with a<br>
print width of approximately 70 mm. The print heads 10.1 - 10.4 include colour<br>
printing ink in different colours, namely in yellow, magenta, cyan and black.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 - 3, the print heads 10.1 - 10.5 of all the printing stations<br>
8 are positioned on a common circular line surrounding the machine axis MA in<br>
such a manner that the print heads of all the printing groups 10 entrained with the<br>
rotating rotor 7 are situated, with reference to the machine axis MA, inside a<br>
circular path on which the container supports 9 move. The print nozzles of all the<br>
print heads 10.1 - 10.5, consequently, with reference to the machine axis MA,<br>
are aligned with their axes constantly radially outwards such that the discharging<br>
of the printing ink onto the containers 2 is supported by the centrifugal force<br>
when the rotor 7 is rotating.<br>
The printing group 10 of each printing station 8, as detailed, is realized in a<br>
rotating manner with the rotor 7, however, for the print head change, is at the<br>
same time pivotable about the machine axis MA in a successive manner or is<br>
switchable further in the direction of rotation of the rotor and in opposition to said<br>
direction of rotation such that when a container 2 is being printed, each print<br>
head 10.1 -10.5 can be moved at least once into a printing position in which the<br>
relevant print head with its print nozzles is directly adjacent the container 2<br>
standing upright on the container support 9 with a small distance in between (e.g.<br>
less than 1 mm). The device 11, which performs the drying of the printing ink<br>
through an application of energy or heat and/or UV radiation, is provided about<br>
the axis of the respective container support 9 offset by approximately 90° relative<br>
to the printing group 10. With the device 1, the devices 11 are positioned on a<br>
common circular line surrounding the machine axis MA, the radius of said circular<br>
line being identical or substantially identical to the distance between the axes of<br>
the container supports 9 and said machine axis MA, in such a manner that in the<br>
direction of rotation R of the rotor the respective device 11 is ahead of the<br>
associated container support 9.<br>
For the printing, the containers 2 are transferred in each case individually via the<br>
transport star 6 to a printing station 8, at which, with a controlled rotational<br>
movement of the container support 9 and consequently with a controlled<br>
rotational movement of the containers 2 about their container axes, one after the<br>
other the colour sets forming the colour print are printed with the print heads 10.1<br>
- 10.4 and then the protective coating is applied with the print head 10.5.<br>
In detail, the printing of each container is effected such that, after the transfer to a<br>
printing station 8, the colour set corresponding to the print head or the final<br>
protective coating are printed onto the outer surface of the container with the<br>
print heads 10.1 - 10.5 each switched into the printing position, and during the<br>
printing of each colour set and possibly also even during the switching further of<br>
the printing group 10 by a print head spacing or by a print head, the drying of the<br>
applied printing ink is performed by means of the device 11. During each printing<br>
step, i.e. during the printing of the respective colour set or the applying of the<br>
protective coating and the drying of the printing ink or of the protective coating,<br>
each container 2 is rotated by 360°. Each printing step with the drying is effected<br>
for example on an angular region of the rotational movement of the rotor 7 of ca.<br>
50° such that the printing of the containers 2 is completed reliably before the<br>
containers 2 reach a container outlet at which they are discharged via a transport<br>
star 12 on a conveyor 13. The resetting of the printing groups 10 into the initial<br>
position is effected in the angular region of the rotational movement of the rotor 7<br>
between the transport stars 12 and 6. An improved or sharper printed image is<br>
achieved through the treatment in the corona tunnel by charging the containers 2<br>
electrostatically on their outer surface.<br>
An optoelectric control system 14 is provided in the direction of rotation R of the<br>
rotor directly before the transport star 12, by means of which control system the<br>
print on the containers 2, which are moved past said system and are rotated<br>
further about the container axis, is checked so that containers with a faulty print<br>
can be discharged on the conveyor 13.<br>
Figures 4-6 show, in the form of another specific embodiment, a device 1a<br>
which only differs substantially from the device 1 in that at the individual printing<br>
stations 8 instead of the printing groups 10, printing groups 10a are provided that<br>
have the print heads 10.1 - 10.5 at a support 15, which can be switched further<br>
for the print head change by rotating about an axis parallel to the machine axis<br>
MA. The print heads 10.1 - 10.5 are provided distributed at regular angular<br>
distances on the periphery of the support 15. The supports 15 are situated, in<br>
their turn, inside the path of movement of the container supports 9 such that each<br>
print head moved into the printing position, i.e. positioned directly adjacent the<br>
container 2 to be printed,- is aligned with its print nozzles radially outwards with<br>
reference to the machine axis MA. The printing of the containers 2 is effected, in<br>
the case of the device 1 a, once again onto the angular region of the rotational<br>
movement of the rotor 7 between the transport star 6 and the control system 14,<br>
the corresponding print head being switched into the printing position for each<br>
colour set and for the sealing or protective coating. The printing ink or the<br>
sealing or protective coating is dried by means of the device 11 during the<br>
printing. The respective container 2 is rotated by 360° during the printing steps<br>
(applying the colour sets, the sealing or protective coating and the drying).<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show, in the form of another embodiment, a device 1b which<br>
only differs substantially from the device 1 in that instead of the rotor 7, there is<br>
provided a transport system 16, which on at least one transport element, which<br>
forms a closed loop and is driveable in an endlessly circulating manner, has a<br>
plurality of printing stations 8 at regular spacings, each with a container support<br>
9, a printing group 10 and a device for drying the printing ink.<br>
The containers 2 are supplied to the device 1a once again via the transport star 3<br>
with the corona tunnel 4 and are transferred in each case individually via the<br>
transport start 6 to a printing station 8, with which the respective container 2 is<br>
then moved during the printing in the direction of transport TS on the transport<br>
section 17 of the transport system 16. The printed containers 2 are forwarded to<br>
the conveyor 13 with the transport star 12 that forms a container outlet.<br>
The printing of the containers 2 with the individual printing inks or colour sets of<br>
the multi-coloured print and the applying of the sealing or protective coating is<br>
effected analogously to the description given in conjunction with the device 1.<br>
For this purpose, the printing groups 10, entrained with the transport system 16<br>
or their print heads 10.1 - 10.5 are moveable or switchable for the print head<br>
change relative to the transport system 16 in the direction of transport TS and in<br>
opposition to said direction of transport and are situated on the inside of the loop<br>
formed by the transport system 16. The devices 11 of all the printing stations 8<br>
are positioned on a common loop line which also intersects the vertical axes of<br>
rotation of the container supports 9, the container supports 9 being ahead of the<br>
associated device 11 in each case in the direction of transport TS.<br>
In detail, the printing of the containers 2 is effected once again in such a manner<br>
that by switching further the print heads 10.1 - 10.5, the respective colour set or<br>
the sealing or protective coating are applied, and during the printing process,<br>
possibly also still during the switching further of the print heads, the drying of the<br>
printing ink and the sealing or protective coating is effected by means of the<br>
associated device 11, the respective container with the container support 9 being<br>
rotated by 360°.<br>
Figures 10-12 also show, in the form of another embodiment of the invention, a<br>
device 1c for printing containers 2 in multiple colours. The device 1c differs from<br>
the device 1 in that a plurality of container supports 9 is provided on the<br>
periphery of the rotor 7 at regular angular spacings about the vertical machine<br>
axis MA, however, said container supports 9 are not components of the printing<br>
stations each with independent printing groups.<br>
In the case of the device 1c, one single printing group or unit 18 is in fact<br>
provided with a plurality of print head units 18.1 - 18.5, each unit of which having<br>
a plurality of print heads 19, in the specific embodiment represented two print<br>
heads in each case. The print heads 19 are realized in the same manner as the<br>
print heads 10.1 - 10.5. Each print head unit 18.1 - 18.5 or its print heads 19<br>
serve in the manner described in more detail below for simultaneously<br>
discharging the colour sets of a colour associated with the respective print head<br>
unit or the sealing or protective coating onto a number of containers 2<br>
corresponding to the number of print heads 19, i.e. in the case of the specific<br>
embodiment represented for simultaneously discharging onto two containers 2.<br>
The print head units 18.1 - 18.5 are also each realized with two devices 20 that<br>
can be switched on or off for drying the respective print or the printing ink, for<br>
example by the application of energy, e.g. by heating and/or UV light, in each<br>
case one device 20 being associated with one print head 19. The print head<br>
units 18.1 - 18.5 with their print heads 19 and their devices 20 are positioned on<br>
a common support 21, which can be moved or pivoted back and forth about the<br>
machine axis MA by a stroke that corresponds to a machine spacing, as is<br>
indicated in particular in Figure 12 with the arrows TR1 and TR2. The print unit<br>
18 formed by the print head units 18.1 - 18.5 and the support 21 is therefore<br>
floating. It is situated, with reference to the machine axis MA, inside the path of<br>
movement on which the container supports 9 move when the rotor 7 rotates. In<br>
addition, the individual print heads 19 are positioned such that they point radially<br>
outwards with their print nozzles, each positioned in a row parallel or<br>
substantially parallel to the machine axis MA, with reference to said machine<br>
axis, such that the discharging of the printing ink is once again supported by the<br>
centrifugal force when the rotor 7 is rotating.<br>
The arrangement is also such that the spacing between the print heads 19 on<br>
each print head unit 18.1 - 18.5, but also the spacing between adjacent print<br>
heads 19 on print head units 18.1 -18.5 following one another in the<br>
circumferential direction of the rotor 7 is identical to the angular spacing between<br>
two adjacent container supports 9. In addition, the devices 20 in the activated or<br>
switched-on state, seen in a top view of the rotor 7, are offset by 90° relative to<br>
the print heads and are positioned on a circular line that surrounds the machine<br>
axis MA and also intersects the axes of rotation of the container supports in the<br>
direction of rotation R of the rotor ahead of the adjacent container support or the<br>
container 2 standing upright on said container support in each case. Each print<br>
head unit 18.1 - 18.4 has associated therewith in each case a colour set or a<br>
colour, namely yellow, magenta, cyan or black. The print head unit 18.5 or its<br>
print heads 19 serve for discharging or printing the sealing or protective coating.<br>
The print head units 18.1 - 18.5 are provided following one another in the<br>
direction of rotation R of the rotor in order of their reference numbers, i.e. in the<br>
direction of rotation R of the rotor the print head unit 18.1 forms the first print<br>
head unit of the printing unit 18 and the print head unit 18.5 forms the last print<br>
head unit of the printing unit 18.<br>
The multi-coloured printing of each container 2 is effected once again in several<br>
chronological printing steps in which the printing, i.e. discharging the relevant<br>
colour set or the sealing or protective coating and the drying is effected with the<br>
containers 2 rotating about the container axes, for example rotating about 360°.<br>
The individual printing steps are executed at each container chronologically one<br>
after the other by the print head units 18.1 - 18.5, with each print head unit 18.1<br>
- 18.5 at two containers simultaneously in each case. During each printing step,<br>
the printing unit 18 is entrained in the same direction and in a synchronous<br>
manner with the rotor 7 (arrow TR1). The devices 20, in this case, are delivered<br>
and activated so that the drying of the generated colour sets is also effected<br>
during each printing step.<br>
After the completion of each printing step and before the introduction of a new<br>
printing step, the printing unit 18 is pivoted back, with devices 20 retracted, in<br>
opposition to the direction of rotation R of the rotor by the machine spacing into<br>
the initial position (arrowTR2), in which then, on account of the rotational<br>
movement of the rotor 7, an unprinted container 2 in each case is adjacent the<br>
print heads 19 of the print head unit 18.1 and a container 2 in each case that has<br>
already been printed in a previous printing step by the print heads 18.1 - 18.4 is<br>
adjacent the print heads 19 of the print head units 18.2-18.5 for another printing<br>
step. In the next printing step, the floating printing unit 18 is then entrained again<br>
in the same direction and in a synchronous manner with the rotational movement<br>
of the rotor 7 by the machine spacing (arrow TR1) and after completion of this<br>
printing step is pivoted back by the machine spacing into the original position<br>
(arrow TR2). The machine spacing, in this case, is twice the spacing between<br>
two container supports 9.<br>
The printing of the containers 2 in multiple colours is completed before said<br>
containers 2 reach the transport star 12 that forms the container outlet, so that,<br>
also in the case of the device 1c, a control system 14, for example an<br>
optoelectric control system is provided in the direction of rotation R of the rotor<br>
before the transport star 12 for checking the respective print on the containers 2<br>
moved past said system and being rotated at the same time so that containers 2<br>
with missing or faulty print can subsequently be discharged onto the conveyor<br>
13.<br>
Figures 13-15 show, in the form of another embodiment, a device 1 d which<br>
differs in the first instance from the device 1c in that instead of the rotor 7 a<br>
transport system 16 is provided that forms a closed loop and is driven in an<br>
endlessly circulating manner. The container supports 9 are provided on said<br>
transport system 16. In addition, at the transport section 17 of the transport<br>
system 16 on which the printing of the containers 2 in multiple colours is effected,<br>
there is provided a printing unit 18a, which comprises a plurality of print head<br>
units, namely a total of six print head units 18.1 - 18.6, three of which print head<br>
units 18.1 - 18.3 or 18.4 - 18.6 are positioned in each case on each side of the<br>
transport section 17. The transport system 16 has the container supports 9 at<br>
regular spacings.<br>
The print head units 18.1 - 18.6 are realized in the identical manner as described<br>
for the device 1c for the print head units 18.1 -18.5 used there, i.e. each print<br>
head unit 18.1 - 18.6 has two print heads 19 spaced apart by half the machine<br>
spacing and two devices 20 also spaced apart by half the machine spacing. In<br>
addition, the print heads 19 and devices 20 of print head units 18.1 - 18.3 or 18.4<br>
- 18.6 adjacent one side of the transport section 17 are each spaced apart by<br>
half the machine spacing.<br>
The printing unit 18a or the print head units 18.1 - 18.6 positioned on a support<br>
(not shown) are moveable by a drive (not shown) in a synchronous manner and<br>
in the same direction with the movement of the transport system 16 out of an<br>
initial position in the direction of transport TS by the machine spacing and in<br>
opposition to the direction of transport TS back into the initial position, said<br>
floating movement also being synchronized with the movement of the transport<br>
system 16 in such a manner that after the movement back into the initial position,<br>
each print head 19 with its printing nozzles is once again situated directly<br>
opposite a container support 9 or a container 2 at that location.<br>
The containers 2 to be printed are supplied to the device 1d by means of the<br>
conveyor 3 with the corona tunnel 4 and are transferred in each case individually<br>
to a container support 9 by means of the transport star 6. Once the containers 2<br>
have been printed on the transport section 17, the printed containers are<br>
removed from the container supports 9 by means of the transport star 12 and are<br>
forwarded to the conveyor 13.<br>
The printing of the containers 2 is once again executed in several chronological<br>
printing steps, in each printing step a number of containers 2 that corresponds to<br>
the number of print heads 19 of the print head units 18.1 - 18.6, i.e. in the case<br>
of the device 1d in each case two containers 2 being printed simultaneously with<br>
the two different colours associated with the print head units (at the print head<br>
units 18.1/18.4, 18.2/18.5) or with the finish that forms the sealing or protective<br>
coating and a printing ink (at the print head units 18.3/18.6). During each printing<br>
step the print heads 19 of the print head units 18.1 - 18.6 are adjacent a<br>
container 2. The printing is carried out by rotating the containers 2, for example,<br>
by 360° with the devices 20 activated such that the printing ink applied with one<br>
print head 19 is dried by the device 20 following said print head in the direction of<br>
rotation of the respective container 2 before a printing ink or finish is applied once<br>
again in the same printing step by the other print head 19. During each printing<br>
step the printing unit 18a is entrained in the same direction and in a synchronous<br>
manner with the transport unit. At the end of the printing step the printing unit<br>
18a is moved back into the initial position so that in another printing step a print<br>
application can then be effected with the print head units 18.1 and 18.4 onto still<br>
unprinted containers 2 in each case and a print application can be effected with<br>
the print head units 18.2, 18.3 and 18.5, 18.6 onto such containers 2 that have<br>
already been printed in a previous printing step with the print head units 18.1,<br>
18.4 or 18.2, 18.5.<br>
Whereas, in the case of the abovementioned devices 1 - 1 d, the printing of the<br>
containers 2 in multiple colours on their container outer surface is effected<br>
directly with the printing groups or their print heads, Figures 16 and 17 show a<br>
device 1e for printing containers 2 in multiple colours in a transfer print. The<br>
printing in multiple colours is once again effected on the container outer surface<br>
or container outside surface and in this case preferably, with regard to the<br>
container axis, on a rotationally symmetrically realized region of the container<br>
outer surface, for example on a circular cylindrical-shaped or frustum-shaped<br>
region of the container outer surface.<br>
By means of a conveyor, which is schematically represented in Figures 16 and<br>
17 and identified with the reference 30, the containers 2 are supplied to the<br>
device 1e in the direction of transport specified by the arrow T, standing upright<br>
and in a single-track container flow, and having passed a corona tunnel 31<br>
provided on the conveyor 30 and a separating screw 32 they reach a rotor or<br>
turntable 34 of the device 1e by means of a transport star 33. At the rotor 34 the<br>
containers 2 are retained so as to be rotatable about their container axes at<br>
container supports provided at that location (not shown) and are moved during<br>
the printing with the rotor 34 on a circular transport section. The printed<br>
containers are removed from the rotor 34 by a transport star 35 and are<br>
forwarded to a conveyor 36.<br>
The printing of the containers 2 in multiple colours is effected by using transfer<br>
pads 37, which are provided on the periphery of a transfer drum 38, which is<br>
rotatably driveable about the machine axis MA in the direction of rotation R of the<br>
rotor but at a speed that is increased compared to the rotational speed of the<br>
rotor 34. The transfer pads 37 are provided at the transfer drum 38 so as to be<br>
adjustable radially relative to the machine axis MA between a switched-on<br>
position located radially further outside and a switched-back position located<br>
radially further inside. In addition, the transfer pads 37 are positioned such that<br>
they move with their outer face, curved in an arcuate manner about the machine<br>
axis MA, inside the circular path of movement of the containers 2 or of the<br>
container supports between the transport stars 33 and 35.<br>
A printing group 39 is provided in the direction of rotation R of the rotor 34 or of<br>
the transfer drum 38 upstream of the transport star 33, with which printing group<br>
the printed image to be discharged onto the container 2 is applied to the outer<br>
face of the transfer pad 37. The printing group 39 comprises a plurality of print<br>
heads 39.1 - 39.4 following one another in the direction of rotation R of the rotor<br>
for different colours, for example for yellow, magenta, cyan and black or for<br>
generating the various colour sets.<br>
The print heads 31.1 - 31.4 are digitally controllable print heads of the ink jet<br>
print head type, for example print heads that are commercially available under<br>
the name "XAAR" or "Xaar500". The print heads 31.1 - 31.4 each comprise<br>
accordingly a housing with a plurality of individually actuatable print nozzles or<br>
nozzle openings for discharging printing ink in the distribution and quantity<br>
corresponding to the respective printed image or colour print onto the<br>
background to be printed, i.e. in the present case onto the outside surface to be<br>
printed of each transfer pad moved past the printing group 39. The printing<br>
nozzles positioned with their axes horizontally or substantially horizontally are<br>
positioned at each print head 39.1 - 39.4 in at least one row parallel or<br>
substantially parallel to the vertical machine axis MA. The discharging of the<br>
printing ink is achieved through corresponding actuation of electrodes or of piezo<br>
elements or actuators in the print heads, for example at an actuating frequency<br>
up to 50 kHz and a relative movement between the respective print head and the<br>
surface of a transfer pad to be printed of ca. 560 mm/second. The number of<br>
print nozzles per print head, for example, is in the range of 500 with a print width<br>
of 70 mm. The print heads 39.1 - 39.4 include printing inks each in different<br>
colours, namely yellow, magenta, cyan and black.<br>
In the direction of rotation R of the rotor upstream of the printing group 39 there is<br>
a cleaning station 40, for example in the form of a cleaning roller, by means of<br>
which any printing ink or ink residue is removed from the print or transfer pad 37<br>
before a new printed image is applied.<br>
At the region of the rotor 34 utilized for printing the containers 2, said region in<br>
the specific embodiment represented corresponding to an angular region of<br>
approximately 180°, following the inlet star 33 there is provided a device 41 for<br>
applying a finish forming a sealing or protective coating on the respective<br>
container print, connecting thereto in the direction of rotation R of the rotor a<br>
device 42 for drying the container print, including the sealing and protective<br>
coating, for example by application of energy, for example heating or UV light<br>
and connecting thereto directly in front of the outlet star 35 an optoelectric control<br>
system 43, by means of which the printed containers are checked with regard to<br>
the quality of the print whilst rotating about their vertical axes so that wrongly<br>
printed containers 2 can then be discharged on the conveyor 36.<br>
In detail, the printing of the containers 2 is effected with the device 1e in such a<br>
manner that the containers 2 transferred individually in each case with the inlet<br>
star 33 to the rotor 34 or to the container supports at that location are rolled over<br>
by the switched-on transfer pads, provided with the printed images on the outer<br>
surface, by reason of the transfer drum 38 that rotates somewhat faster<br>
compared to the rotor 34, the containers therefore roll off the transfer pads by<br>
rotating about their vertical container axes and consequently the printed image is<br>
transferred from the respective transfer pad onto a container 2. As the<br>
respective transfer pad 37 is still rolling off, that is still inside the transfer region,<br>
the containers 2 are moved past the device 41, by means of which the finish that<br>
forms the sealing or protective coating is applied to the respective container,<br>
rotating about the container axis in a continuous manner, onto the part of the<br>
container print already generated by rolling off the transfer pad 37 on the outer<br>
surface of the container.<br>
The devices 41 and 42 and the control system 43 are situated with the rotor 34 in<br>
a non-entraining manner on the periphery of the path of movement of the<br>
containers 2.<br>
After the completed transfer of the printed image from the transfer pad 37 onto<br>
the outer surface of the relevant container 2 or after the completed rolling off of<br>
said container on the relevant transfer pad 37 and after the completed applying<br>
of the sealing or protective coating, the relevant transfer pad 37 is switched back<br>
and the respective container 2, continuing to be rotated about its container axis,<br>
is moved past the device 42 for drying the print and past the control system 43<br>
and finally is discharged with the transport star 35 onto the conveyor 36.<br>
After passing the transport star 35, the transfer pads 37 are switched-on once<br>
again, i.e. moved radially outwards for the cleaning process at the cleaning<br>
station 40 and for the application of a new printed image at the printing group 39.<br>
The treatment of the containers 2 in the corona tunnel 31 and the electrostatic<br>
charging of the containers 2 at that location produce a substantial improvement<br>
in the multi-colour print that is generated with the transfer print onto the outer<br>
surfaces of the containers.<br>
In a very schematic representation, Figures 18 and 19 show a device 1 f that is<br>
once again realized for a transfer print in multiple colours on the outer surfaces of<br>
containers 2. In the case of this device, the printing of the containers 2 is<br>
effected on a transport system 44 that forms a closed loop and is driven in an<br>
endlessly circulating manner or respectively on a substantially linear transport<br>
section 45 of said system. Container supports 46 are provided at regular<br>
spacings on the transport system 44. The containers 2 to be printed are supplied<br>
to the transport section 45 via the conveyor 30 with the corona tunnel 31 and are<br>
transferred individually in each case via the transport star 33 to a container<br>
support 46, with which the relevant container 2, retained so as to be rotatable<br>
about its container axis, is moved during the printing in the direction of transport<br>
TS to the transport star 35, by means of which the printed containers 2 are<br>
removed from the transport system 44 and forwarded to the conveyor 36.<br>
For printing the containers 2 in multiple colours, there is a print device 47<br>
provided at the transport section 45 that includes a plurality of transfer elements<br>
or transfer pads 48, which are provided at an auxiliary conveyor 49 so as to be<br>
rotating with said auxiliary conveyor, said auxiliary conveyor forming a closed<br>
loop. The auxiliary conveyor 49 having the transfer pads 48 forms a vertical loop<br>
that is provided with its upper horizontally extending loop length 49.1 parallel to<br>
the transport section 45 and directly adjacent to said transport section on one<br>
side. In their initial position, the transfer pads 48, which, for example, are<br>
substantially rectangular and with their longitudinal extension are oriented in the<br>
circumferential direction or in the direction of movement of the auxiliary conveyor<br>
49, are positioned with their surface sides in planes perpendicular to the loop<br>
plane of the auxiliary conveyor 49.<br>
The auxiliary conveyor 49 is driven in such a manner that its upper length 49.1<br>
moves in the direction of transport TS of the transport section 45, however at a<br>
greater speed than the transport section 45.<br>
At the upper length 49.1, following one another in the direction of transport TS<br>
there is provided a cleaning station 50 in the form of a cleaning roller for<br>
removing printing ink residue on the transfer pads 48 and then a printing group<br>
51. The printing group 51 comprises a plurality of print heads 51.1 - 51.5<br>
following one another in the direction of transport TS, said print heads being<br>
realized, for example, in an identical manner to the print heads 39.1 - 39.5,<br>
however being positioned in such a manner that the print nozzles of said print<br>
heads are oriented with their axes in the vertical direction and the rows on each<br>
print head formed by the print nozzles are oriented in the horizontal direction<br>
perpendicularly or at right angles to the direction of transport TS. The printing<br>
group 51, positioned above the path of movement of the transfer pad 48,<br>
executes the printing of each transfer pad 46 moved past on the top side<br>
positioned in a horizontal plane. After the printing each transfer pad 48 is set up<br>
such that with its side that has the printed image, it is positioned in a vertical<br>
plane parallel to the direction of transport TS such that the respective container 2<br>
to be printed, being rotated about its container axis, rolls off a transfer pad 48<br>
and in so doing the printed image is transferred from the transfer pad 48 to the<br>
outer surface of the container. At the same time a device 52 applies the sealing<br>
or protective coating and a device 53 dries the print.<br>
The device 1f also offers, among other things, the advantage of it being possible<br>
to position the print heads of the print group 51 that operate according to the ink<br>
jet print head principle in a position that is optimum for the method of operation,<br>
namely with their print nozzles above the path of movement of the transfer pads<br>
48 and with the axes of the print nozzles oriented downwards in the vertical<br>
direction.<br>
Once the printed image has been transferred, the relevant transfer pad 48 is<br>
pivoted back again into its initial position.<br>
In a very schematic manner, Figures 20 - 22 show a device 1g that is realized<br>
similar to the devices 1, 1a - 1d for printing containers 2 in multiple colours on<br>
their outer surfaces by applying the printing ink<br>
directly onto the outer surface of the container. In the case of this device, the<br>
printing is executed on a transport element in the form of a rotor 54, which is<br>
rotatably driven about the vertical machine axis (arrow R) and on which are<br>
provided container supports 55, offset from one another at regular angular<br>
spacings about the vertical machine axis, for the containers 2 standing upright,<br>
i.e. with their container axes oriented in the vertical direction. A ring-shaped print<br>
head support 56, which is positioned in an axially identical manner to the<br>
machine axis, is provided inside the path of movement of the container supports<br>
55, on said print head support in the same spacing or at the same angular<br>
spacing that is between the container supports 55, print heads 57.1 - 57.4 are<br>
provided for printing inks in the various colours, namely in yellow (print head<br>
57.1), in magenta (print head 57.2), in cyan (print head 57.3) and black (print<br>
head 57.4) along with other print heads 57.5 for applying the coating or protective<br>
finish. The print heads 57.1 - 57.5 are each provided in groups on the print<br>
head support 56 in such a manner that each group has the print heads 57.1 -<br>
57.5 once and the print heads 57.1 - 57.5 in each group have the same<br>
sequence, i.e. for example are provided following one another in the order of<br>
their reference numbers in the circumferential direction of the print head support<br>
56, for example in opposition to the direction of rotation R of the rotor 54. The<br>
arrangement of the print heads 57.1 - 57.5 is additionally such that in each<br>
printing stage (e.g. positions a and c in Figure 22) one print head 57.1 - 57.5 is<br>
always situated directly opposite a container 2 or its outside surface in the<br>
printing position. In this specific embodiment, the print heads 57.1 - 57.5<br>
together with the print head support 56 form the printing group 57.<br>
For printing, the containers 2 are once again supplied to the inlet or transport star<br>
6 via the corona tunnel 4 and the separating screw 5 (arrow T) and are<br>
transferred in each case individually from said inlet or transport star to a printing<br>
station formed by a container support 55. The printed containers 2 are removed<br>
at the outlet or transport star 12 and supplied via the conveyor 13 to another use<br>
(arrow T).<br>
The container 2 is printed in multiple colours during the transport with the rotor 54<br>
between the inlet star 6 and the outlet star 12. The colour sets forming the<br>
respective multi-colour print and the connecting protective coating are applied in<br>
each case one after the other with the print heads 57.1 - 57.4 or with the print<br>
head 57.5 with the containers 2 being rotated or pivoted in a controlled manner<br>
about the container axes with the container supports 55, for example with a<br>
controlled rotational movement in each case about 360°.<br>
In detail, the printing of each container 2 is executed such that, after being<br>
transferred from the inlet star 6 the container 2 is situated opposite a container<br>
support 55 in a first angular region of the rotational movement of the rotor 54, i.e.<br>
in a first printing stage it is situated opposite a print head for generating a first<br>
colour set, for example the print head 57.1 (Figure 22, position a). During this<br>
printing stage the print head support 56 is entrained in the same direction and in<br>
a synchronous manner with the rotor 54. When the colour set is applied, the<br>
container 2 is rotated in a controlled manner about its vertical container axis by<br>
360° and at the same time the printing ink applied in each case is dried by means<br>
of a suitable device 58 that is associated with each print head 57.1 - 57.5.<br>
The printing stage for applying another colour set or for applying the protective<br>
coating that follows the first or in each case another printing stage is introduced<br>
by the container support 55 or all the print heads 57.1 - 57.5 being stopped for a<br>
short time or being moved by a spacing in opposition to the rotational movement<br>
so that the containers "overtake" the print heads 57.1 - 57.5 by a spacing<br>
(distance between the print heads) (Figure 22, position b) and thus another print<br>
head is situated opposite each container 2 in a printing position, for example,<br>
after the print head 57.1 the print head 57.2, after the print head 57.2 the print<br>
head 57.3, after the print head 57.3 the print head 57.4 or after the print head<br>
57.4 the print head 57.5. It is obvious that in each printing stage following a<br>
previous printing stage that is effected once again on an angular region of the<br>
rotational movement of the rotor 54, the print head support 56 or the print heads<br>
57.2 - 57.5 are also entrained with the rotor 54 in a synchronous manner at the<br>
identical speed and in the same direction.<br>
With rotor 54 the printed containers 2 are moved past a hardening or curing<br>
station 59 for complete hardening of the printing ink and of the protective coating<br>
and then, connected thereto, before reaching the outlet star 12, are moved past a<br>
control station or a control system 14, by means of which the print on the<br>
container moved past said system and also rotated about its vertical container<br>
axis is checked so that any containers with a faulty print can be discharged on<br>
the conveyor 13.<br>
In the case of the device 1 g, the number of container supports 55 on the rotor 54<br>
is an integer multiple of the number of print heads 57.1 - 57. 5 in each print head<br>
group. Accordingly, the angular spacing or spacing between container support<br>
55 in the case of the device 1g is equal to 3607(n1 x n2), wherein<br>
n1 = number of print heads 57.1 - 57. 5 per print head group, namely for<br>
example five<br>
n2 = number of print head groups on the print head support 56.<br>
It has been assumed above that the print head change between two printing<br>
stages following one after the other is effected by slowing down the print head<br>
support 56 briefly so that the print heads 57.1 - 57.5 are "overtaken" by the<br>
containers 2. In principle, a print head change is also obviously possible in the<br>
reverse manner by briefly accelerating the print head support 56 in each case so<br>
that the container supports 55 or the containers 2 are "overtaken" by the print<br>
heads 57.1 - 57.5 during the print head change. In each case, however, the<br>
print head support 56 in the printing stage after the print head change and before<br>
a new print head change is driven in the same direction and in a synchronous<br>
manner with the rotor 54.<br>
For reasons of simplicity, the print head support 56 is represented as a ring in<br>
Figures 20 - 22. In the embodiment of the device 1g in practice, it is possible for<br>
said support to have any arbitrary embodiment that can be used for the function.<br>
Thus it is possible, in particular, to realize the print head support 56, for example,<br>
in two parts at least, comprising at least one first element that is entrained with<br>
the rotor 54 and at least one other guided element, which is provided at said first<br>
element and is switchable further for the respective print head change relative to<br>
the first element about the vertical machine axis through stepwise rotation by a<br>
spacing (distance between the print heads 57.1 - 57.5), for example in<br>
opposition to the direction of rotation R of the rotor 54 or in said direction of<br>
rotation.<br>
The device 1g has, among other things, the advantage that at least the larger<br>
part of the angle of the rotational movement of the rotor 54 is available for the<br>
printing process, the number of print heads 57.1 - 57.5 can nevertheless be kept<br>
relatively small such that the total number of print heads 57.1 - 57.5, for<br>
example, is equal to the number of container supports 55, and the respective<br>
print head change can be effected through short movement strokes.<br>
In the case of the device 1g also, the print heads 57.1 - 57.2 are positioned once<br>
again inside the path of movement of the containers 2 on the rotor 54 so that the<br>
applying of the printed images or of their colour sets is supported by the<br>
centrifugal force of the rotating rotor 54 and print head support 56.<br>
The invention has been described above by way of exemplary embodiments. It<br>
is obvious that numerous changes and variations are possible without departing<br>
from the inventive concept underlying the invention.<br>
Thus it has been assumed above that during the printing the containers 2 stand<br>
with their container bottom on a container support or on a surface of a rotor or of<br>
a transport system. Obviously embodiments are also possible where the<br>
containers 2 are retained in another manner during the printing, for example<br>
suspended at a container or neck flange provided in the region of the container<br>
mouth.<br>
It has also been assumed above that the drying of the respective colour set is<br>
effected during the printing. In principle, however, it is also possible for the<br>
drying not to be effected until the respective colour set has been applied to the<br>
outer surface of the container.<br>

64. Method according to one of Claims 60 - 63, characterized in that the<br>
pivoting of the transfer pads (37, 48) is effected about at least one axis<br>
parallel or substantially parallel to the direction of their movement.<br>
65. Method according to one of Claims 58 - 64, characterized in that the<br>
transfer pads (37, 48) for the transferring of the printed images are<br>
moved parallel to the direction of transport (R, TS) of the containers (2),<br>
but at a speed that deviates from the transport speed of the containers<br>
(2) with regard to direction and/or magnitude.<br>
66. Method according to one of the preceding Claims 41 - 65, characterized<br>
in that the containers (2) are treated in a corona tunnel (4, 31) before the<br>
printing.<br>
<br>
The invention relates to a device and a method for printing<br>
containers, especially in multiple colours, on at least one<br>
outer surface of the container, using a print formed by at least<br>
one printed image, at least one printing group provided with<br>
print heads operating according to the ink jet printing<br>
principle, for producing partial printed images of the printed<br>
image to be applied to the outer surface of the container in at<br>
least one printing step, and a transport element for moving<br>
the container during the printing in a transport direction.<br>
The printing groups are moved with the transport element at<br>
least one printing step.</td>
