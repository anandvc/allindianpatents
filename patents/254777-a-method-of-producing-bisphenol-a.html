patent (U.S. patent 4,849,569).<br>
A catalytic distillation column reaction is a benefit first, because the reaction<br>
is occurring concurrently with distillation, the initial reaction..products and.loiher<br>
stream components are removed from the reaction zone as quickly as possible<br>
reducing the likelihood of side reactions. Second, because all the components^are<br>
boiling the temperature of reaction is controlled by the boiling point of the mixtuine^at<br>
the system pressure. The heat of reaction simply creates more boil up^but&gt;no<br>
increase in temperature at a given pressure. As a result, a great deal of contrGclover<br>
the rate of reaction and distribution of products can be achieved by regulati'ngiithe<br>
system pressure.<br>
U.S. patent 5,679,312 discloses producing bisphenol-A by carrying out the<br>
reaction by feeding phenol and acetone concurrently downflow in a distillation<br>
column reactor having acidic ion exchange resin catalysts held on trays by screens.<br>
An inert stripping gas, e.g., nitrogen or argon, is fed in the bottom of the distilJatipn<br>
column reactor to aid in removing the water of reaction. With its concurrentfesol'Of<br>
the phenol and acetone the patentee gets only about 96% conversion ofethe<br>
acetone. The patentee exhibited a lack of skill and knowledge in regard to .catalytic<br>
distillation and its areas of significant commercial use as well as being unable to<br>
envision how a catalytic distillation system could be used to carry out the reaction of<br>
acetone with phenol to produce bisphenol-A. ; -<br>
It is an adva ntage of the present invention that the catalytic distillation.system,<br>
with its inherent benefits is employed for the production of bisphenolTA from the<br>
condensation reaction of phenol and acetone. It is a further advantage th-at-an inert<br>
hydrocarbon serves to remove water of reaction from the reaction system and is<br>
easily reused by return to the reaction system. It is a further advantage? that<br>
substantially all of the acetone is trapped in the reaction zone and near;100%<br>
conversion is obtained.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bisphenol-A is efficiently produced from the condensation of phenoband<br>
acetone via countercurrent and multistage contact with a solid acid catalyst in'the<br>
presence of stripping medium which is inert under the reaction conditions and<br>
boiling in the range of 50 to 90 °C at the pressure in the column, preferably inert<br>
hydrocarbons, which includes aliphatic hydrocarbons such as normal,he^a,ng,..; A.<br>
preferred contacting system is a distillation column.reactor where the,-catalyst is<br>
contained within a distillation mass transfer structure. A preferred water"re.nnffiyal<br>
agent is a C6 hydrocarbon, e.g., normal hexane.<br>
In the present invention the stripping medium is one that is inert and which<br>
has both a liquid and vapor state in the reactor, i.e., boiling, such that thevMapjDrs<br>
strip the water from the reaction mixture and are condensed along with the water and<br>
separated therefrom. Preferably the stripping medium is not soluble feany<br>
substantial degree with water, so the separation can be made by decanting. The<br>
preferred mode of operation is that characterized by a distillation condition ^existing<br>
within the reaction zone. The present invention is carried ouUn a catalyst- packed<br>
column which can be appreciated to contain a vapor phase and,s©maJi.guicl.,p|isse.<br>
as in any distillation. The distillation column reactor is operated lata,pressure such<br>
that the reaction mixture (or components thereof) is boiling in the.eolumn and/or in<br>
the bed of the catalyst (distillation conditions). As in any.distillation.there is a<br>
temperature profile along the column. At some point along the-Golumn: oc;©^glyst<br>
bed a component of the reaction mixture may be a liquid and a vapor at a higher<br>
temperature point in the column, thus creating an internaLreflux; whefe^Sgsejris of:<br>
the vaporized material in the column, e.g. water and the stripping medium is<br>
removed as a vapor.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention may be described as a proeessifor<br>
the reaction of phenol with acetone to produce bisphenol-A comprising:<br>
(a) feeding a stoichiometric excess of phenol to a catalyst .zone.wllicri<br>
preferably comprises a bed of solid acidic catalyst, such as ion-exchange resin, in<br>
a. distillation column reactor and<br>
(b) feeding acetone toward the bottom of said catalyst zone;<br>
(c) providing a hydrocarbon, which is inert under the .reaction c.ond|tipRs;and<br>
boiling in the range of 50 to 90 °C at the pressure in the distillation sojumn reactor,<br>
in a state of distillation comprising both a vapor and liquid thereof<br>
distillation column reactor;<br>
(d) concurrently in said distillation column reactor<br>
(i) contacting said acetone and phenol in the presence of .said«aeidic<br>
catalyst under conditions of temperature and pressure to form a reaction ^mixture<br>
containing unreacted acetone, unreacted phenol, bisphenol-A, and water, whereby<br>
said acetone is dissolved in said phenol such that substantially .all of said-acefone<br>
is converted to bisphenol-A; V- (ii) stripping said water from said reaction mixture utilizing said<br>
hydrocarbon vapor;<br>
(e) removing said bisphenol-A and unreacted phenol from the dtstiation .<br>
column reactor as bottoms; .<br>
(f) removing said water and hydrocarbon vapor from the distillation column<br>
reactor as overheads; and<br>
(g) condensing said overheads and separating the condensed«?inrert<br>
hydrocarbon from the condensed water.<br>
In a preferred process the additional steps are: (h) recycling the condensed hydrocarbon to said distillation column reactor (i) flashing said bottoms to separate said unreacted phenol frorm/said<br>
bisphenol-A; and<br>
(j) condensing the separated phenol and recycling the condensed separated<br>
phenol to near the top of said distillation column reactor. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OFTHE DRAWING<br>
The FIGURE is a flow diagram of a preferred reactor system employe$4r*the<br>
.instant invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT <br>
Bisphenol-A is formed via the reaction of two moles of phenol with on&amp;4ftQ\e<br>
acetone:<br>
2(C6H5OH) + (CH3)2(CO) « [(C6H4OH)]2C(CH3)2 + H2O .<br>
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is small (K=0,8 mole fraction basis).<br>
The reaction is generally catalyzed by acidic ion exchange resins and is<br>
conventionally carried out in the presence of a large stoichiometric excess of phenol<br>
which enhances the conversion of acetone and minimizes the production-sQfobyproducts.<br>
However, at practical phenol/acetone charge ratios single stage<br>
conversion of phenol is small, For example, at a charge composition of 2Q/1j*loJar.<br>
phenol/acetone, phenol conversion is only 12% while acetone conversion is:::92$&gt;.<br>
Previously the bisphenol-A was recovered from the reaction mjxtu,re?via<br>
crystallization of a bisphenol-A/phenol adduct. Feed to the crystallize/ -usua -lly<br>
contains on the order of 20 wt.% bisphenol-A, This concentration is obtalra^d :iby<br>
allowing the bisphenol-A to build up in the reaction mixture by using<br>
reaction stage with intermediate removal of water via vacuum of inert<br>
between the stages. In so doing the unreacted phenol and acetone and<br>
distribute between the overhead product streams-andihe bottoms stream,coteita inihg<br>
the BPA product. In conventional processing the phenol, acetone and water«are<br>
subsequently separated in downstream distillation columns.<br>
The present invention, simplifies the overall processing scheme by combining<br>
reaction and separation steps. This is accomplished by performing -the. reaction in<br>
a multistage distillation column reactor configured with structured pa:ckJRg;COo|a.iri|ng<br>
the catalyst and which operates with an inert stripping medium fed to the r<br>
the column that preferentially removes the water of reaction from the reaction zcine.<br>
The water is removed in the distillate stream from the column .. The countercurrentfeed of the present invention provides anothjgridvrjtage<br>
in that by feeding liquid phenol to the column above the reaction zpne,, .aee^prje is<br>
removed from the ascending vapor stream and returns to the reaction! zone. Thesnet<br>
effect is to "trap" the acetone within the reaction zone where it reacts essentia;%to<br>
completionThe stripping medium (preferably inert hydrocarbons;) has the -additional<br>
function of controlling the reboiler temperature and the temperature profile; in^he<br>
lower portion of the reaction zone which is preferably in the 70-80 ° grange/line .<br>
inert hydrocarbon has the additional advantage of being readily separablelrpfisthe<br>
water in the distillate stream via decantation. The inert hydrocarbon Iayerlra.rrj4he<br>
decanter is preferably returned to the column. Thus a constant feed of tdifiiiert<br>
stripping medium is not necessary and makeup can be added as required. CATALYSTS ..-....,<br>
The reaction of phenol and acetone to produce bisphevnol-A is :catalyzed.rby<br>
acidic catalysts, preferably cation exchange resins. Suitable acid cation exchange<br>
resins include those which contain sulfonic acid groups, and which may be obtained<br>
by polymerization or copolymerization of aromatic vinyl compounds followed-toy<br>
sulfonation. Examples of aromatic vinyl compounds suitable for preparing polymers<br>
or copolymers are: styrene, vinyl toluene, vinyl naphthalene, vinyl ethylfoenzene,<br>
methyl styrene, vinyl chlorobenzene and vinyl xylene. A large variety of methods<br>
may be used for preparing these polymers; for example, polymerization al=onre,-or: in<br>
admixture with other monovinyl compounds, or by crosslinking with pQlyyfayl<br>
compounds; for example, with divinyl benzene, divinyl toluene, divinyl phenylether<br>
and others. The polymers may be prepared in the presence or absence of solvents<br>
or dispersing agents, and various polymerization initiators:may be used,. :e.g.,<br>
inorganic or organic peroxides, persulfates, etc.<br>
The sulfonic acid group may be introduced into these vinyl aromatic polymers<br>
by various known methods; for example, by sulfating the polymers with concentrated<br>
sulfuric and chlorosulfonic acid, or by copolymerizing aromatic compounds^which<br>
contain sulfonic acid groups (see e.g., US Pat. No. 2,366/007). Further sulfonic<br>
acid groups may be introduced into the polymers which already contain suifonic'acid<br>
groups; for example, by treatment with fuming sulfuric acid, i,e., sulfuric acid which<br>
contains sulfur trioxide. The treatment with fuming sulfuric acid is preferab ly carried ;<br>
out at 0 to 150° C and the sulfuric acid should contain sufficient sulfur trioxide so that<br>
ft still contains 10 to 50% free sulfur trioxide after the reaction. The resulting<br>
products preferably contain an average of 1.3 to 1,8 sulfonic acid groupsp.er<br>
aromatic nucleus. Particularly, suitable polymers which contain sulfonic aoidgfofips<br>
are copolymers of aromatic monovinyl compounds with aromatic polyviny!<br>
compounds, particularly, divinyl compounds, in which the polyvinyl benzen e content<br>
is preferably 1 to 20% by weight of the copolymer (see, for example, German-Patent<br>
Specification 908,240). The ion exchange resin is generally used in a granular size<br>
of about 0.25 to 1 mm, although particles from 0.15 mm up to about2 mrn may. be<br>
employed. The finer catalysts provide high surface area, but also result-inHIgh<br>
pressure drops through the reactor. The macroretieularform of these catalysts frave<br>
much larger surface area exposed and limited swelling which all of these resins<br>
undergo in a non-aqueous hydrocarbon medium compared to the gelular catalysts.<br>
The container employed to hold the catalyst particles may have any'conlgwration,<br>
such as the pockets disclosed in the patents above or the container may be:a<br>
single cylinder, sphere, doughnut, cube, tube or the like.<br>
Each container containing a solid catalytic material comprises a catalyst<br>
component. Each catalyst component is intimately associated with a -spacing<br>
component which is comprised of at least 70 volume % open space,up,to:abQut::95<br>
volume % open space. This component may be rigid or resilient ora combination<br>
thereof. The combination of catalyst component and spacing component formse<br>
catalytic distillation structure. The total volume of open space for the catalytic<br>
distillation structure should be at least 10 volume % and preferably at least JO<br>
volume % up to about 65 volume %, Thus, desirably the spacing CQmppnent.pr<br>
material should comprise about 30 volume % of the catalytic distillation strgctuje,<br>
preferably about 30 volume % to 70 volume %. Resilient materials:arepre,ferre,d.<br>
One suitable such material is open mesh knitted stainless wire, known generally as<br>
demisterwire or an expanded aluminum. Other resilient components may besimilar<br>
open mesh knitted polymeric filaments of nylon, teflon and the like. Qthermaterijls<br>
such as highly open structures foamed material, e.g., reticulated polyurethanefoarn<br>
(rigid or resilient) may be formed in place or applied around the catalyst cpmpprjegt.<br>
In the case of larger catalyst components such as from about 1/4 inch to Y<br>
pellets, spheres, pills and the like, each such larger component may be individually,<br>
intimately associated with or surrounded by the spacing component as describfd<br>
above.<br>
It is not essential that the spacing component entirely cover the catalyst<br>
component. It is only necessary that the spacing component intimately associated<br>
with the catalyst component serve to space the various catalyst components away<br>
from one another as described above. Thus, the spacing component provides in<br>
effect a matrix of substantially open space in which the catalyst components are<br>
randomly but substantially evenly distributed.<br>
A preferred distillation structure is described in U.S. patent 5,730,843 noted<br>
above, which comprises at least two wire mesh tubes arrayed in a substantially<br>
parallel, adjacent and vertically aligned row and at least one offset wire mesh tube<br>
disposed adjacent to and spaced from said vertically aligned wire mesh tubes. In a<br>
more preferred embodiment the distance between the vertically aligned tubes of the<br>
columns is sufficient to allow the offset wire mesh tube to overlap the vertically<br>
aligned wire mesh tubes without contacting said vertically aligned wire rnesh tub:es<br>
to thereby form a tortuous fluid pathway.<br>
Referring now to the FIGURE a flow diagram of a preferred reactor system is<br>
shown. The distillation column reactor 10 is seen to contain beds of catalyst 12 and<br>
14 which comprise a reaction zone having 50 equilibrium stages with 4 trays above<br>
the reaction zone and 4 trays below the reaction zone. Stage 1 is the condenseriO<br>
and stage 60 is the reboiler 40. Phenol is fed via flow line 101 .above stage 3 and<br>
acetone is fed via flow line 102 above stage 40. The acetone and phenol react in<br>
the reaction zone to produce a reaction mixture containing phenol, acetone,<br>
bisphenol-A and water. N-hexane recycle is fed via flow line 103 , combined withnhexane<br>
recycle 114 to the reboiler 40 through flow lines 116, 117, and 110<br>
eventually to the bottom of the distillation column reactor 10 at about stage 59. The<br>
n-hexane strips the water of reaction out as it is formed and removes it as overheads<br>
via flow line 104. The overheads are condensed in condenser 20 and collected in<br>
receiver/decanter 30 where the water is separated and removed via flow line 1'06,<br>
N-hexane (containing a small amount of acetone) is taken from the receiver/decanter<br>
30 via flow line 107 and returned to the distillation column reactor 10 at about stage<br>
56. The water contains about 2% acetone which corresponds to about 99.5%<br>
conversion. The bottoms product containing phenol, bisphenol-A and only trade<br>
amounts of water and acetone is removed from the distillation column reactor 10 via<br>
flow line 111 from reboiler 40.<br>
The bottoms product removed via flow line 111 is flashed to 3 psi in flash<br>
drum 50 producing a n-hexane rich vapor stream in flow line 112 and a<br>
phenol/bisphenol-A liquid stream in flow line 113. The n-hexane rich vapor stream<br>
in flow line 112 is cooled (not shown) and passed to knock out chamber 60 where<br>
any liquid is removed via flow line 115 before compressing (not shown) and recycling .<br>
via flow line 114. A recycle stream from the recovery section (not shown) is also fed<br>
to chamber 60 via line 116. Liquid from the knock out chamber 60 in flow line 115<br>
contains essentially phenol and is recycled to distillation column reactor above stage<br>
3. The phenol/bisphenol-A liquid stream in flow line 113 is combined and sent to the<br>
bisphenol-A recovery system where the bisphenol-A is reeovered.by crystallization.<br>
In the operation of this process the normal hexane or other stripping-ifvedjuiisis<br>
recovered and recycled. The only feed of this component to -thecolumn is atstartiapi<br>
and for makeup of that lost during the recovery.<br>
The recovery of the bisphenol-A is summarily described as follows:<br>
The phenol/bisphenol-A stream is combined with other phenol rich recycle .<br>
streams from the crystallization systems and is sent to an evaporator system<br>
operating at ~2 psi. The resulting vapor is partially condensed producing a hexanerich<br>
recycle and phenol rich liquid recycle. The liquid product from the evaporator<br>
containing 29 wt.% bisphenol-A is fed to a crystallization system which generates a<br>
slurry of bisphenol-A/phenol adduct in phenol. The slurry is centrifugally separated<br>
into a mother liquor stream which is cycled to the evaporation system and a solid<br>
adduct stream which is wet with phenol for further processing to recover phenol for<br>
recycle.<br>
The solid adduct stream is combined with net feed liquid phenol stream and<br>
heated to resolution temperature. The resulting solution stream is sent to a second<br>
crystallization system producing a slurry stream which is separated into further<br>
purified adduct stream and mother liquor stream. The latter is cycled to the<br>
evaporator feed tank.<br>
The phenol wet solid is melted and fed to a second vacuum evaporation<br>
system to dephenolate the adduct and product bisphenol-A melt product stream<br>
which contains a small amount of phenol. The phenol vapor stream is condensed<br>
and sent to the phenol recycle tank. The combined phenol recycle stream is fed to<br>
the catalytic distillation column via stream 101.<br>
Final purification of the bisphenol-A is via hexane stripping to remove residual<br>
phenol and steam stripping to remove residual hexane. The recovered hexane<br>
streams are recycled to the CD column. The purified bisphenol-A melt is pelletized<br>
or flaked and finally bagged.<br>
