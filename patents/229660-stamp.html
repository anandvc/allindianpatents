BACKGROUND OF THR TNVENTTON<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a stamp, and more particularly to a stamp that can keep ink from getting on a person's fingers and be used with only one hand.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Some conventional stamps are mounted with inkpads, and they are convenient for a user. Such stamps often have a cover mounted on the face of the stamp, and the cover has the inkpad inside. When the stamp with the inkpad is used, a person removes the stamp from the cover with two hands, and ink on the devices easily stains a person's hands.<br>
The present invention provides a stamp to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problem. ST JIVTMARY OF THR TNVRNTTON<br>
An objective of the present invention is to provide a stamp with a housing, an arm, a character unit, a control unit and a cover, which can be used without getting ink on a person's hands. The arm is mounted inside the housing and the character unit is attached to the arm. The control unit is mounted through the housing and the arm. When using the stamp, the cover is taken off. The control unit is pressed and pushed along the housing, the arm also can be pushed and the character unit is pushed out and rotated to stamp. The stamp can be easily operated with one hand and prevent ink from staining a person's fingers.<br><br>
Other objectives, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. BRTRF nRSCRTPTTON OF THE PR AWTNfiS<br>

The cap (411) is on the top surface of the control unit (40). The neck (412) is integrally formed with the bottom surface of the control unit (40) and aligned with the cap (411). The neck (412) has a diameter substantially equal to the width of the elongated slot (12). The annular shoulder (413) is integrally formed and coaxially aligned with the neck (412). With further reference to Fig. 3, the legs (414) have outer sides (not numbered), are formed beneath the annular shoulder (413) and are mounted in the keyhole (24). The stops (415) are formed respectively on the outer sides of the legs (414) and abut the inner top surface of the cavity (23). The slot (416) is defined between the two legs (414) to allow the legs (414) to be squeezed together so the stops (415) can pass through the keyhole (24). The spring (43) is mounted inside the cavity (23) in the sliding block (21) and is attached to the legs (414).<br>
The cover (50) is mounted on the open end of the housing (10) to receive the tongue (11), the recessed sidewalls (111) and the character unit (30). The cover (50) has a top surface (not numbered), two sidewalls (not numbered).<br><br>
an open end (not numbered), a closed end (not numbered), a longitudinal tongue (51) and a top opening (52) and two optional detents (53). The open end faces the housing (10), and the closed end is opposite to the open end. The top opening (52) is defined in the top surface and communicates with the opening of the cover (50). The longitudinal tongue (51) is formed inside the cover (50) at the closed end beside the top opening (52), extends toward the open end and has an internal dovetail groove (not numbered) and an external dovetail key (not numbered). When the arm (20) and the character unit (30) have been retracted into the housing (10), the external dovetail key on the longitudinal tongue (51) slides into the dovetail groove (16) in the housing (10). The detents (53) are defined respectively on the sidewalls of the cover (50) to selectively receive and hold the ribs (17) on the recessed sidewalls (111) of the housing (10) to hold the cover (50) on the housing (10). The longitudinal tongue (51) abuts the inner surface of the tongue (11) so that the housing (10) will not rotate and easily release from the cover (50).<br>
With reference to Figs. 4 to 8, the control unit (40) extends and retracts the character unit (30). With the button (41) in the inner hole (13), the button (41) is pressed to align the neck (412) with the elongated slot (12). Then the button (41) is moved out along the elongated slot (12), and the pushed button (41) pushes the arm (20) out along the keys (15) in the housing (10). When the neck (412) of the button (41) aligns with the outer hole (14), half of the character unit (30) extends beyond the tongue (11) on the housing (10). The torsional spring (33) rotates the character unit (30) perpendicular to the bar (22), and the spring (43) in the sliding block (21) pushes the annular shoulder (413)<br><br>
into the outer hole (14) in the housing (10). Consequently, the character unit (30) is ready to stamp.<br>
After stamping, the user can press the button (41) down and pull the button (41) towards the inner hole (13). The character unit (30) is pivoted downward by the tongue (11), so that the arm (20) and the character unit (30) can be retracted into the housing (10). Thereafter, the cover (50) is mounted on the housing (10).<br>
With a stamp in accordance with the present invention, a user can simply push and move the button (41) on the control unit (40) to make the character unit (30) extend out to stamp, so that the user's fingers will not be stained by ink.<br>
