NEW THIOESTER DERIVATIVES OF THIAZOLYL ACETIC ACID<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel thioester derivatives of thiazolyl acetic acid of general formula (I), useful as an intermediate for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics having general formula (II). In addition, the present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of thioester derivatives. The present invention also provides for a process for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics using said thioester derivatives.<br><br>
wherein, Ri represents H, trityl, CH3, CRaRbC00R2<br>
(Ra and Br independently of one another represent hydrogen or<br>
methyl and R2 represents H or C1-C4 alkyl)<br>
R3 is CH3 -CH=CH2, -CH2OCH3, -CH2OCOCH3<br>
R4 is H or a sah or a carboxylic protecting group or an inner salt<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Use of acid chlorides, anhydrides, esters, amide etc. is reported in the chemical literature for activation of carboxylic acid of formula (IV).<br><br>
Activation in the form of acid chloride required protection and deprotection of NHâ€™ group.<br><br>
Activation of acid (IV) is reported by SO2CI2/DMF in US patent 5,856,502 and SOCI2/DMF in US patent 5,037,988. These processes suffer the limitation of using harmful and pungent smelling chemicals like SOCI2, SO2CI2 along with solvents like benzene, toluene, etc. and involving stringent conditions for carrying out the reactions on commercial scale.<br>
In US patent Nos. 4,576,749 and 4,548,748, the acid of formula (IV) has also been<br>
activated by reacting with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) or 2-mercaptobenzothiazole<br>
(MBT) in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) to produce reactive ester of the<br>
acid (IV) which is then reacted with cephem moiety to prepare cephalosporin antibiotics,<br>
but the processes are time consuming accompanied with low yields, hence, not suitable.<br>
US patent No. 4767852 discloses a process for production of ciphers by acylating 7-<br>
amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid with 2-mercaptobenzothiazolyl-(Z)-2-(2"aminothiazol-<br>
4-yl)-2-methoxyimmoacetate (MAEM). Similarly, US Pat.No.5026843 (1991) disclosed a<br>
process for preparing ceftriaxone disodium hemiheptahydrate by acylation of 7-amino-3-<br>
[(2,5-dihydro-6-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-oxo-l,2,4-triazin-3yl)	thiomethyl]-3-cephem-4-<br>
carboxylic acid (7-ACT) by using MAEM as acylating agents in good yield and quality. Thus MAEM has become the standard acylating agent for the preparation of cephalosporins antibiotics having an examine group and a 2-aminothiazolyl group in 7-position of cephem compounds.<br>
However, the synthesis of MAEM from acid (III) and 2,2'-dithio-bis-benzothiazole involves use of costly condensing agent triphenylphosphine (TPP). Moreover, during condensation of MAEM with 7-aminO'3'Cephem-4-carboxylic acid compound (III), a toxic compound 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) is also produced as a byproduct [Chemical Abstracts, 111, p. 19243 (1989)], which is difficult to remove. Thus, it is evident that the procedures described in the prior art for the preparation of these cephalosporin antibiotics are complex, involving protection, deprotection and also associated with generation of toxic byproduct. Hence, there is a need to develop new acylating agents which are capable of transferring the 2-aminothiazolyl moiety to cephem compounds of formula (III) in good yield, without producing this toxic byproduct. On the similar lines, a new thioester was reported by D.G.Walker, Tet. Lett.  1990, 31,64(S1 to<br><br>
acylate the cephem moiety to get caffeine sulfate but yields obtained by using this thioester were in the range of 54-73% which cannot be considered as good yield to operate a process at commercial scale. The same thioester is exploited in US patent No. 5869649 for making three more important cephalosporin antibiotics.<br>
In the CO pending application US Application No. 09/754,302, the Applicant has disclosed another novel thioester derivatives of thiazole acetic acid and its use in the synthesis of various cephalosporin antibiotics. In continuation of search for more such derivatives, the Applicant has observed that the title compound (I) works equally well and also has the similar advantages as described in the aforementioned US application.<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
The primary objective of this invention is to provide novel thioester derivatives of thiazolyl<br>
acetic acid of formula (I) used for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics of formula<br>
(II).<br>
Another objective of this invention is to prepare new thioester derivatives of thiazolyl<br>
acetic acid of formula (I) which is better than the earlier reactive derivatives and also<br>
suitable for being used in the manufacture of cephalosporin antibiotics.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of<br>
thioester derivatives of formula (I) from thiazolyl acetic acid of formula (IV) and 1,2,5,6<br>
tetrahydro-2-methyl-5, 6- dipxo-l,2,4-triazin-3-thiol (VI).<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
cephalosporin antibiotics of general formula (II) at low temperature, which will be simple<br>
and cost effective.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to produce cephalosporin antibiotics<br>
having high purity and free from toxic byproducts.<br>
One more objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
cephalosporin antibiotics of general formula (II) from said novel thioester derivatives.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a new thioester derivatives of thiazolyl acetic acid of<br>
formula (I) and also provides a method by which the said thioester derivatives can be<br>
prepared by reacting thiazolyl acetic acid of general formula (IV) with the commercially<br><br>
available 1,2,5,6 tetrahydro-2-methyl-5,6 dioxo-l,2,4-triazin-3-thiol (VI) using Vilsmeier<br>
reagent (V) as a condensing agent.   (Ber. 60B, 119 (1927). The thioester derivatives thus<br>
obtained are reacted with 7-amino-cephem carboxylic acids of general formula (III) to<br>
produce cephalosporin antibiotic compounds of general formula (II) as described above.<br>
The cephalosporin antibiotics obtained are of high purity (95-99%). The method is<br>
workable on commercial scale without necessitating the protection of the amino group of<br>
the   acylating   agents,   and   avoiding   the   generation   of   the   toxic   product   2-<br>
mercapto benzothiazole.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides novel derivatives of thiazolyl acetic acid represented by<br>
formula (I)<br><br>

Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method by which cephalosporin antibiotics are obtained in high purity and excellent yield without the necessity for protecting the amino group of the acylating agents and avoiding the production of toxic byproduct namely 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT).<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the substituent R3 in cephem compound (II) and (III) represents methyl, acetyloxymethyl, methoxymethyl, vinyl, pyridylmethyl, propenyl, 2,5-dihydro-6-hydroxy-2-methyU5-oxo-l,2,44riazine-3-thiol, furanyl-2-carbonyIthiol.

In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the substituent R4 represents hydrogen, salt, a standard carboxylic protecting group, or a inner salt. Especially it is termed as carboxylate ion when R3 is pyridylmethyl, which ultimately explains the neutrality of the molecules.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides the use of Vilsmeier reagent of formula (V) as condensing agent.<br><br>
Still another embodiment of the invention provides acylation of (III) (when R5 is H) is<br>
performed in presence of a water miscible solvent like tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetonitrile,<br>
acetone, dioxane, N,N-dimethylfonnamide etc. but the preferable solvents are THF and<br>

carried out in aprotic organic solvents like halogenated hydrocarbons, toluene, acetonitrile,<br>
alkyl ethers etc., but preferable solvent is acetonitrile and dichloromethane. More suitable<br>
salivating   agents   used   for  the   reaction   are   hexamethyldisalazane,   bis   (trimethyl)<br>
silylacetamide and trimethylsilyl chloride or a mixture thereof.<br>

triazin-3-thiol of general formula (VI) is also tried in various coupling reactions of<br>
carboxylic acids and amines. Most of amide formation reactions have shown good results.<br>
L-alanine, 5'methylisoxazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-thienylacetic acid, etc. are some of the<br>
compounds, which have been activated by above mentioned thiol of formula (VI).  Some<br>
of the results are summarized in the following table.<br><br><br>
Many other beneficial results are obtained by applying disclosed invention in a different<br>
manner or by modifying the invention within the scope of disclosure.  However, since the<br>
major characteristic feature of the present invention resides in the use of novel reactive<br>
thioester derivatives of thiazolyl acetic acid of general formula (I) in preparing the<br>
cephalosporin antibiotics, the technical scope of the present invention should not be limited<br>
