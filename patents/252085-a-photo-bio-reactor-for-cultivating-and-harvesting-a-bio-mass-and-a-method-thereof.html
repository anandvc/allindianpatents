				<td>Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a PhotoBioreactor for cultivation of Botryococcus braunii and a<br>
method for efficiently growing the microalgae. More particularly, the invention relates to<br>
a PhotoBioreactor and method for cutivation of biomass for producing bio-diesel. The<br>
bioreactor and the method can be adapted to production of other microalgae including<br>
spirulina.<br>
Botryococcus braunii, is a highly rich renewable source of hydrocarbons. The high cost of<br>
known microalgal culture systems relates to the need for light and the relatively slow<br>
growth rate of the algae. The photobioreactors must be designed keeping in mind that<br>
light is needed continuously for microalgal cultures. Since the intensity of light decreases<br>
rapidly with the depth of the culture, the geometry of the reactor is equally important.<br>
Important concern is to reduce the costs of these systems further to make them<br>
economically competitive.<br>
Bioreactor System design depends on organism property, media property and system<br>
kinetics. The property of the organism is important because we need the organism to<br>
grow in the desired fashion so that the acclaimed metabolic route is followed to yield us<br>
the preponderance of desired product. Factors such as Oxygen / Carbon Dioxide<br>
dependency play crucial role, hence the importance of the size of the bubble and the time<br>
it spends in the liquid column. We also need to take care of the hydrodynamic shear since<br>
the growth may decrease sharply after increase of gas flow rate beyond certain value due<br>
to cell damage. Cell damage is dependent on the strain used, the bubble size based on the<br>
nozzle because smaller nozzle, which produce smaller bubbles, are more detrimental. But<br>
there is advantage of having smaller nozzle as it gives in more diffusion of the gas in the<br>
medium, and hence we need to make an optimum choice. Thus there is a need of proper<br>
sparger. In general superficial air velocity of 0.085 m/s can be considered the upper limit<br>
beyond which organism without cell wall can undergo damage. In case of scale up, when<br>
more quantity of gas is required, we must assure either increasing the number of nozzles<br>
or increasing the diameter does not exceed this velocity.<br>
Algae use light as an energy source and obtain all the carbon they need from inorganic<br>
sources (CO2) and are thus photoautotroph. Micro algal biotechnology has the potential to<br>
produce a vast array of products including foodstuffs, industrial chemicals and<br>
compounds with therapeutic applications, bioremediation solutions and hydrocarbons.<br>
Background Art<br>
Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Ohio University have been demonstrating the and<br>
biomass production in photobioreactors using sunlight. Large solar collectors on the roof<br>
track the sun, collect sunlight, and distribute it through large optical fibers to the<br>
bioreactor's growth chamber. The fibers function as distributed light sources to illuminate<br>
cyanobacteria (algae). Each growth chamber consists of a series of illumination sheets<br>
containing the optical fibers and moist cloth-like membranes on which the algae grow. By<br>
stacking the membranes vertically and better distributing the light, more algae can be<br>
produced via photosynthesis in a smaller area.Ohio University photobioreactors use<br>
sunlight to sequester carbon from coal-fired power plants as they produce biomass.A<br>
drawback of this system is that in horizontal cultivator systems, light penetrates the<br>
suspension only to 5 cm, leaving most of the algae in darkness. The top layer of algae<br>
requires only about 1/10th the intensity of full sunlight to maximize growth, so the<br>
remaining sunlight is wasted.<br>
James C. Ogbonna and Hideo Tanaka have developed a prototype photobioreactor<br>
consisting of four units built with 0.5-cm-thick transparent Pyrex glass for the cultivation<br>
of C. pyrenoidosa. Each unit was equipped with a centrally fixed glass tube into which<br>
the light source was inserted. Transparent glass tubes were used as housings for the<br>
lamps, so the reactor was illuminated by simply inserting the lamps into the glass tubes<br>
(no mechanical fixing). Any light source could be used. Either 4-W fluorescent or<br>
halogen lamps with controllable light intensity were used as the illuminating system.<br>
Because the lamps are not mechanically fixed and can easily be replaced, the same reactor<br>
can be used for efficient cultivation of various cells by using a light source with<br>
controllable light intensity or by simply replacing the light source with one that gives the<br>
desired light intensity. For mixing, an impeller modified in shape is used so that it did not<br>
touch the glass housing unit during rotation.<br>
United States Patent 5,614,378 (Yang , et al, March 25, 1997) discloses a photo bio<br>

each adjacent cylindrical light irradiator is within 1 mm to 20 cm, for a time sufficient to<br>
produce said biologically-active compound, while irradiating said cells with said first<br>
light cylindrical irradiator and said second light cylindrical irradiator. This photo<br>
bioreactor may also be used in a method to fix carbon dioxide, to produce, e.g., fuels<br>
and/or chemical feed stocks. In this application, the cultured cells are suitably, e.g.,<br>
Botryococcus braunii.<br>

race strain producing hydrocarbons mainly consisting of 30-33C hydrocarbons and<br>
containing above a specific weight ratio of a 30C hydrocarbon to the total of<br>

Botryococcus is raked by a platinum wire while observing characteristic properties of the<br>
alga of the genus Botryococcus in a colony state, etc., by using a stereoscopic microscope<br>

Japanese Patent JP9173050 method for efficiently culturing a microalgae belonging to<br>
green algae, which has ability to fix CO2 by light energy and converts it into useful<br>
substances such as fuel comprises culturing microalgae (e.g. Botryococcus braunii<br>
CCAP807/1, etc.) belonging to such as Botryococcus, Chlorella, or Haematococcus,<br>
which belongs to green algae, while adding intermittently a disinfectant such as<br>
hypochlorous acid, hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide and ozone to the culture medium<br>
intermittently each in a quantity of 0.01-200ppm so as to attain an effective quantity of<br>
the disinfectant in an open system under conditions of light illuminance and aeration of<br>
0.05-5wm air containing CO2 in concentration of 0.03-30% at culturing temperature of<br>
10-4°C for about 10 days.<br>
Accordingly, various types of Biorectors known in the art are described along with draw<br>
backs in the following paragraphs.<br>
A common CSTR type reactor, which is externally illuminated by light source. This has a<br>
poor surface to volume value and since the illumination is from outside, a major part of<br>
light energy is wasted and inefficiently utilized.<br>
A common lab scale reactor provides high light supply capacity and can be illuminated<br>
by both artificial and solar light. However, this has a poor surface to volume value and so<br>
a large number of light tubes would be required and thus would be energy consuming, a<br>
factor very detrimental for scale up.<br>
A Flat Plate reactor derives the laminar concept from plants. If light energy has to be<br>
available continuously to the cells, a lamination of photobioreactor directed to the light<br>
source seems to be the best solution. Apart from the high surface/volume value offered in<br>
case of tubular reactors, plate-type reactors have some advantages with respect to<br>
compactness. The advantages of a flat plate photobioreactor include easy introduction of<br>
turbulence, easy approachability of inner walls, providing easy control of wall growth and<br>
fouling and they may be tilted towards sun, ensuring higher absorption of incident energy.<br>
However, there is a major demerit of problems faced when attempting to scale-up since a<br>
corresponding increase in width would lead to a reduction of light intensity in the inner<br>
section of the reactor.<br>
In a typical airlift reactor, mass transfer is high and short liquid circulation time can be<br>
obtained. Further there is insignificant hydrodynamic stress. The riser can comprise of the<br>
dark zone and the down comer as photic zone. Airlift operation uniformly suspends<br>
microplantlets and improves exposure to light. Also there is continuous addition of<br>
nutrient medium and high cell density would be obtained in matter of time such that<br>
biomass is retained within vessel. Possibly modification include introducing alternating<br>
dark and transparent section in the inner column to take into account of organism specific<br>
flashing light effect. However, if the light source is from outside then there would be<br>
major loss in the energy.<br>
One of the most promising closed tubular photobioreactors design is the helical reactor.<br>
Tubular systems are generally arranged in a Horizontal serpentine form and made of glass<br>
or plastic tubes. Recirculation of culture suspension can be obtained by airlift technology<br>
or by means of pump. Floating or submerging the tubes on or in a pool of water<br>
controlled temperature, oxygen degassing being guaranteed by flexible tube elements.<br>
Biocoil is an arrangement of coiled polyethylene tubes of about 30-60 mm diameters<br>
around an open circular framework.<br>
Helical tubular photobioreactor is advantageous because it allows a larger ratio of surface<br>
area to culture volume to receive illumination effectively, thereby reducing the selfshading<br>
phenomenon. Thus there is improved light transfer since the tube diameter has<br>
short light path to reduce light attenuation through culture suspension However this<br>
reactor has a drawback that upscaling involves large area for a given biomass production.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The ability of photoautotrophic microbes to make use of solar energy for metabolism is<br>
dependent upon the effective surface area of the rays to which it is subjected, which<br>
reduces with increase in population. As opposed to heterotrophic microorganisms where<br>
mixing solves the distribution of the organic molecules as energy carriers by mixing, the<br>
supply of photons is based on the surface area. Light gradient would always tend to occur<br>
due to mutual shading of the cells and light absorption. The light intensity in a<br>
photobioreactor decreases exponentially with the depth. Since the intensity of light<br>
decreases rapidly with the depth of the culture, the geometry of the reactor is equally<br>
important.<br>
High alteration between subjecting to light regime and dark regime in the order of<br>
microseconds to up to a second results in enhancement of photosynthetic efficiency. It has<br>
been observed that turbulence in an optically dense culture increases the efficiency of<br>
light utilization by photosynthesis. This effect is denoted as a flashing light effect. This<br>
effect is due to the fact that photosynthesis does not cease at the instant when light is<br>
removed but continues until the energy absorbed in the prior light period has been used<br>
and chemically stored. Short cycle time flashing light effect could be a result of fast effect<br>
of electron acceptors associated with the photo-system II followed by their oxidation in<br>
the dark period. In turbulence, individual cells are subjected to a pattern of light and dark<br>
periods. The flashing light effect could thus increase photo-accepting capacity. The<br>
subjection of Light &amp; Dark regime should not be in the order of seconds, as it would then<br>
lead to reduction in photosynthetic activity resulting in reduced biomass yield. But the<br>
exact order of the Light/Dark value depends on the organism of choice and the product<br>
required. However, it is evident that this Light/Dark cycle will determine the efficiency<br>
and productivity that we desire for a given compound. Algal culture is in light demand<br>
through antenna pigments in the cell. Antennas that are damaged need a recovery time.<br>
Helical tubular bioreactor facilitates temperature control and restricts contaminants<br>
because it is a closed bioreactor. There is better CO: transfer from the gas stream to the<br>
liquid culture medium due to the extensive CO2 absorbing pathway. Possibly, a<br>
modification may include introducing alternating dark and transparent section in the inner<br>
column to take into account of organism specific flashing light effect. Its disadvantages<br>
include requirement of a large land area for a given volume. Another aspect is that the<br>
system is suitable only for disperse culture suspension as pump action disperses cell<br>
clumps.<br>
Some factors that influence the light requirement of an algae culture are:<br>
/. Type of algae culture and optimum wavelength: The Light requirement of algae<br>
depends on the major pigment present on the algae. Different pigments absorb light in<br>
different range of wavelengths; chlorophyll a in the range of 400-450 nm (between Violet<br>
and Blue) and around 680nm(Red), p-carotene 400-500 nm (Violet to Green), chlorophyll<br>
b (400-500nm). Further we also need to remember that energy delivered is inversely<br>
proportional to the wavelength, but the penetration is directly proportional to the<br>
wavelength. In Green algae Chlorophill a, Chlorophill b and (3-carotene are light<br>
harvesting pigments which have their absorption wavelength maxima in the range<br>
400nm-500nm and 620-680nm.<br>
2. Type of Light source: Some of the efficient light sources from the electric consumption<br>
and wavelength requirement point of view are Light Emitted diodes (LEDs), Fluorescent<br>
lights, and incandescent/halogen lamps. Fluorescent lamps are used most frequently for<br>
the cultivation of phototrophic organisms. The emission wavelength emitted from the<br>
mercury vapor can be converted to continuous radiation by modifying the composition of<br>
the fluorescent material, which allows for an optimum spectrum of photosynthesis. LEDs<br>
are one of the most efficient one in converting electricity to light with desired<br>
wavelength. However, if broader wavelength is required then combination of LEDs has to<br>
be used. We also need to keep into account the increase in wavelength due to absorption<br>
of rays as Heat energy.<br>
3. Intensity of Light source: The light intensity at which the cell growth begins is called<br>
the compensation intensity (Ic) and the light intensity after which no further increase in<br>
growth takes place with increased light intensity is called the saturation intensity (Is).<br>
After a certain more increased value of light intensity, decrease in specific growth rate<br>
starts to takes place. This phenomenon is called photoinhibition and the intensity is<br>
denoted (Id). Further, the values of Ic, Is and Id is strain and temperature dependent. The<br>
specific growth rate of algae increases linearly with light intensity up to the saturation<br>
light intensity, thereafter-light inhibition is observed. Generally, the Is increases as the<br>
temperature is increased resulting in increased specific growth rate.<br>
In general, the helical system bioreactors prove to be better than the stirred system. This<br>
can be attributed to large dark volume characterized by cylindrical reactors. This dark<br>
volume can be taken care by inserting transparent pipes into the cylinder from the top<br>
through holes in the lid, holding fluorescent tubes, such that it can easily be removed<br>
during sterilization. T-shaped multifunctional stirrer is used to agitate the suspension and<br>
to supply sterile air.<br>
The denser is the culture of micro algae, the more problematic is the light penetration,<br>
and extremely limited. This restricts the commercial production to just flat plate<br>
photobioreactor and narrow bore tubular reactor. In spite of the efficient performance of<br>
thin channel flat plate types of photobioreactors, there is difficulty in scaling it up for<br>
production of significant quantities of product. This further limits our choice to tubular<br>
photobioreactor. The major disadvantage of tubular reactors is that for the same amount<br>
of volume, the area required is much more in comparison to other reactors. Other<br>
possibilities comprise of bubble column and airlift reactors that are more compact than<br>
tubular devices and can be deployed if a certain loss of productivity is acceptable.<br>
From Commercial point of view, a PBR must have high productivity, large volume, low<br>
maintenance and building expenses, and flexibility and ease to control culture parameters.<br>
Use of Immobilized Algal Cells<br>
Immobilized cell culture offers important advantages over free suspension in particular<br>
when the cells are slow growing. Extra-cellular products can be recovered continuously<br>
with ease. Since micro algae are shear sensitive, immobilization can protect cells against<br>
hydrodynamic shear forces. Immobilization by Calcium Alginate beads results in cells<br>
with enhanced chlorophyll content in attempt to capture more of the available light. Gelentrapped<br>
cells are thus protected from photoinhibition, a condition in which intense<br>
irradiance actually causes a loss in photosynthetic performance. However, Alginate gelimmobilized<br>
cells have a lower growth rates and lower biomass production relative to<br>
free controls, possibly because immobilization can reduce availability of substrate to the<br>
cells. It is to be noted that Immobilized cells retain the ability to produce hydrocarbons,<br>
whose structure and relative abundance are not affected by immobilization. PUF<br>
(Polyurethane Foams) support matrices have broad range of porosity and mechanical<br>
strength. However, the exposure to light to the cells drops down noticeably and so does<br>
the growth. Cotton gauze - immobilized B. braunii cells show higher levels of<br>
hydrocarbon production, biomass growth, and photosynthetic activity when compared<br>
with cells immobilized in PUF. Despite advantages, the practicability of immobilized<br>
algal culture remains questionable unless the cells can be cultured in long-duration<br>
continuous culture and the hydrocarbons can be extracted continuously, say by doing<br>
some protein engineering for post-translational modification in the corresponding DNA<br>
sequence, or by selectively subjecting the beads to extracting solvent such that the<br>
hydrocarbon is extracted and the cell remains as it is inside the beads.<br>
B. braunii has a disperse culture growth and growth into clump-form is not an advantage<br>
to the organism, rather causes reduction in the supply of oxygen to the inner cells. Hence<br>
application of Tubular coiled reactor is advantageously is the best for the purpose. High<br>
surface to volume value is desired for more or less equal distribution of light intensity.<br>
Hence application of Tubular coiled reactor serves best for the purpose.<br>
hi a preferred embodiment, to introduce proper Flashing light effect for the organism B.<br>
braunii dark strips of appropriate width are introduced at regular intervals, such that the<br>
order is not more than a second. For maximum utilization of energy, light is provided<br>
from inside and not from outside, such as inside the coiled helix in the Tubular coiled<br>
reactor. To ensure better distribution of light, straight tube-lights may be preferred over<br>
bent 'U' shaped tube-lights. Light of appropriate wavelength must be used which is<br>
optimum for B. braunii. Typically in Green algae Chlorophill a, Chlorophill b and 6-<br>
carotene are light harvesting pigments which have their absorption wavelength maxima in<br>
the range 400nm-500nm and 620-680nm. Either single fluorescent light can be deployed<br>
covering the entire wavelength of 400-700nm, or 2 LEDs can be made use of, one with<br>
the emission bandwidth of 400-500nm and another with 600-700 nm as LEDs have a<br>
narrow bandwidth. The choice would be governed by comparative economics.Light<br>
intensity is kept to be around saturation intensity, as an increase further would lead to<br>
decrease in growth rate and wastage of energy. Use of Solar-Light and optical fibre can be<br>
deployed since in a Tropical country such as India there is abundant supply of solar<br>
energy.<br>
Care is taken to ensure appropriate and more-or-less uniform temperature as the<br>
saturation intensity changes with change hi temperature, and would thus lead to errors in<br>
observation. In general superficial air velocity of 0.085 m/s can be considered the upper<br>
limit beyond which organism without cell wall can undergo damage. Since each cell of B.<br>
braunii has its own cell wall, we can operate at values above this numerical figure, but at<br>
the same time the value should not be very high as micro algae are known to be shear<br>
sensitive.<br>
The Carbon-Dioxide percentage of 5% can be considered to be optimum for microalgae<br>
growth though the exact optimum value would be dependent on other factors such as the<br>
strain &amp; temperature.<br>
Tubular Helical PBR takes into account of most of the above considerations. The only<br>
demerit is the large land area required for scale up as for a given volume the coiled tube<br>
would be very long<br>
. The present invention nullifies this effect and thereby reduces the problem of large land<br>
area.<br>
In an embodiment, a peristaltic pump is provided it is not harmful for the shear-sensitive<br>
organism such as the B. Braunii. Usage of pump also reduces the chances of reverse flow.<br>
Additionally, the pump action also disperses cell clumps and thereby facilitates more of<br>
absorption of nutrients and light by individual cells. Care should be taken that pressure of<br>
the medium being pumped does not exceed the osmotolerance pressure which is 1<br>
atmosphere (guage).<br>
The present 'Flash Light Super Helical Photo Bio Reactor' takes care of the scalability<br>
issue of traditional helical photobioreactor and also introduces increase in the<br>
photosynthetic activity of the microalgae by Flash-Light effect.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the bio-rector comprises a helical tubular system having at<br>
least two substantially coaxial helical transparent autoclavable tubular coils(l) for flow of<br>
a culture medium containing micro algae to be cultivated, each coil being hydraulically<br>
connected to its adjacent coaxial coil, said coils having annular spaces interposed<br>
between the adjacent coils and a space enclosed by the inner diameter of innermost coil,<br>
the first and the last coil each having a free end. The number of coaxial coils may be 2 or<br>
3 or more. The end of each coil is hydraulically connected to the starting point of<br>
adjascent coil.<br>
The primary requirements of the tube forming superhelical structure is that it should be<br>
transparent and autoclavable. Further, it should be non-fragile and economical. One<br>
possibility was that of Glass. Though glass satisfies the first two criteria extremely well, it<br>
is highly delicate and mishandling or accidental touch can destroy the entire setup.<br>
Further, the cost of fabrication using Glass for the above scheme turns out to be<br>
extremely high. More importantly, the brittle and fragile nature of glass makes it<br>
incapable to tolerate high guage pressure over an extended period. Lastly, there is<br>
constraint on the fabrication in limiting the gap distance between any two adjacent rings<br>
to be not less than a centimeter, which reduces the compactness and thereby the<br>
scalability.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, pipe material used which is resistant to heat and is<br>
autoclavable is transparent type Silicone Tube. Though the transparency of Silicone is not<br>
as good as that of a Glass, silicone is flexible, non-fragile, autoclavable and costs almost<br>
half of what it costs for fabrication using Glass. The photostage of present invention<br>
comprises said transparent autoclavable tubular coils made from silicon polymer material.<br>
The bio reactor has a means(2,3) of providing Flash-Light effect i.e. periods of light and<br>
darkness on each point alternately for predetermined time periods on the inner and outer<br>
surfaces of each of said coil. In a preferred embodiment means(3) for providing periods<br>
of light is a plurality of tubelights uniformally placed in the annular space between two<br>
adj ascent coils and the space enclosed by inner diameter of the innermost coil. In another<br>
embodiment, a plurality of light emitting diodes is used for this purpose. An optic fiber<br>
coil may be used to provide solar illumination in another embodiment. In another<br>
embodiment, a combination of these means are used. In a preferred photo bio-reactor<br>
means(2) of providing period of darkness comprises a plurality of opaque strips or wires<br>
of predetermined width or diameter which obstruct the light from means of illumination<br>
falling on various points along the surface of the helical tubular coils and thus provide<br>
periods of light and darkness for the culture medium circulating in the helical tubular<br>
coils. In a preferred photo bio-reactor said alternating light and darkness time periods on<br>
each point along the flow path of said circulating culture medium are in the ratio 1:0.1 to<br>
1: 0.2. In an embodiment, these coils are wound around a 'wire cage'(2) as illustrated in<br>
Figure 2, which would provide strips of shadow or less light intensity zone at regular<br>
intervals to result in alternating light and darkness time periods on each point along the<br>
flow path. Vertical strips of black-paper at the opposite face of the cage after the tube<br>
may be provided to further ensure reduction in light intensity in that zone. In another<br>
preferred embodiment of photo bio-reactor said means of providing periods of light and<br>
darkness comprises an electronic flashing device. In order to get best results, there is<br>
preferably a cycle comprising alternately continuous darkness time period of 8 hours after<br>
each period of 16 hours of said alternating light and darkness time periods.<br>
The bio reactor has a de-gasser chamber(4) having hydraulic connection with said free<br>
end of the first coaxial coil for removing unwanted gases from said culture medium.<br>
Optionally, a stirrer(S) is provided in said de-gasser chamber for keeping the bio-mass in<br>
suspension in said culture medium. In a preferred embodiment, the stirrer is a magnetic<br>
stirrer or a small air-lift reactor for suspending the culture. The de-gasser chamber has<br>
hydraulic connection with a heat exchanger(6) for controlling temperature of said culture<br>
medium preferably between 25° C and 36° C. The heat exchanger may comprise a water<br>
bath for heating and/ or a chilling unit for cooling.<br>
The water bath may comprise copper coils for flow of said culture medium, fitted inside a<br>
container for water circulation.<br>
The bio reactor has a rneans(7) for causing flow of said culture medium in said coils<br>
without said means coming into direct contact with said medium. In a preferred<br>
embodiment this means is a perislatic pump(7), which acts on the outer surface of the<br>
tube to cause pumping of the culture medium without coming in contact with the<br>
medium. A gas injection means(8) is connected to said de-gasser chamber of the bio<br>
reactor on one end and said free end of last coil on the other end. In a prferred<br>
embodiment the gas injection means may be a Y-shaped junction(8) having two inlet<br>
arms and one outlet arm with said outlet arm connected to said free end of last coil and<br>
said two inlet arms connected to a CO2 source and an air source respectively.The flow of<br>
the air plus carbon-dioxide and the pump together are kept such that the relative<br>
superficial velocity of the gas with respect to the liquid does not exceed the value 0.085<br>
m/s. We can obtain such value by taking air flow rate to be 
flow rate to be 0.085 m/s. In a preferred embodiment flow rate of said circulating culture<br>
medium is from .085 m/s to 0.10 m/s and said gas flow rate is between 0.170 m/s to 0.200<br>
m/s.<br>
A preferred method of cultivating and harvesting a bio-mass in the photo bio-reactor of<br>
present invention comprises the steps of:<br>
(a) circulating a culture medium containing a micro algae in said reactor at a<br>
predetermined flow rate;<br>
(b) providing alternately period of light and darkness for predetermined time periods on<br>
each point along the flow path of said circulating culture medium;<br>
(c) removing unwanted gases from said circulating culture medium;<br>
(d) controlling temperature of said culture medium between 25° and 36° C;<br>
(e) optionally, stirring said circulating culture medium to keep said micro algae in<br>
suspension;<br>
(f) injecting CO2 and air into said circulating culture medium to ensure a predetermined<br>
gas flow rate;<br>
(g) providing continuous darkness for a predetermined time period on each point along<br>
the flow path of said circulating a culture medium; and<br>
(h) harvesting cultivated micro algae from said circulating culture medium.<br>
The micro algae used is Botryococcus braunii. The method may also be adapted for<br>
cultivating and harvesting spirulina or any other algae.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the modified Chu-13 medium is used to culture B. braunii.<br>
This medium has the following composition (Kgnr3) at four-fold normal strength:<br>
KN03 (0.2) Copper (0.02ppm)<br>
K2HPO4 (0.04) Cobalt (0.02ppm)<br>
MgS04.7H2O (0.1) Molybdenum (0.02ppm)<br>
CaCl2.6H2O (0.08) Manganese (O.Sppm)<br>
Ferric Citrate (0.01) Boron (O.Sppm)<br>
Citric Acid (0.1)<br>
The production of hydrocarbons in B. braunii appears to be growth associated,<br>
irrespective of the specific culture conditions and the nutrients used. The production of<br>
hydrocarbon is energetically demanding and thus it leads to slow growth rate of algae and<br>
so is not dominated by the amount of nutrients present. The color of algal colonies is<br>
dependent on the carotenoid-to-chlorophyll ratio, which is affected by the intensity of<br>
light. Carbohydrates concentration, cellular nitrogen, and phosphorus content of B.<br>
brauni are decreased by extended exposure to a light intensity.<br>
Colony size increase with increased light intensity initially when the cell concentration is<br>
low and sufficient light for photosynthesis was available. As the cell concentration<br>
increase, the average light intensity within the photobioreactor decreased because of<br>
mutual shading, and thus the production rates of extracellular polysaccharides and<br>
hydrocarbons decrease with decreasing average light intensity. The equilibrium colony<br>
size is determined by a dynamic balance between the mechanical strength of colonies and<br>
the hydrodynamics stress due to turbulence in the reactors.<br>
The pH of the culture medium is generally adjusted to between 7.4 and 7.6 before<br>
inoculation. A regular increase in pH is observed during active growth followed by a<br>
slight decline later. The increase in pH is partly due to the consumption of dissolved CO2<br>
for photosynthesis. Similar changes in pH are observed in CO2 enriched culture during<br>
exponential growth.<br>
Potentially domestic sewage that has been pretreated by activated sludge treatment can be<br>
used as a medium for hydrocarbon production by B. braunii. Sewage can reduce the cost<br>
of producing the hydrocarbons. Secondary stage-treated sewage (STS) has been<br>
characterized, and found to contain a large amount of nitrogen (as nitrate) and phosphorus<br>
(as phosphates). Botryococcus cannot grow on industrial wastewater containing a high<br>
concentration of inorganic ions. Potentially, the productivity of continuous algal culture<br>
can be improved by optimizing the dilution rate. The optimal dilution rate is expected to<br>
depend on the strength of wastewater and the intensity of illumination.<br>
The pH is adjusted to 7.5 before sterilization. Optimum temperature for growth is 25-30°<br>
C. Reviews of the different techniques available (flocculation, filtration, centnfugation<br>
and air flotation) have concluded that centnfugation is possibly the most reliable<br>
technique and only slightly more expensive than other techniques.<br>
Here we have assumed that the goal of microalgal biotechnology efforts to recover a high<br>
value product from the microalgal biomass. Thus, the high value product needs to be<br>
separated from the biomass. Depending on the process, the microalgal cells may need to<br>
be physically disrupted. Both ball mills and high pressure homogenisers have been used<br>
successfully to disrupt microalgal cells to enhance recovery.<br>
Depending on the product to be recovered, in the process it might entail reducing the<br>
water content of the microalgal biomass. Absence of water in the biomass enhances the<br>
recovery of lipid soluble components . Microalgal mass can be dehydrated in spray<br>
dryers, drum dryers, freeze dryers and sun dryers. In the case of Heat sensitive<br>
compounds commercial producers have developed technologies that limit exposure to<br>
conditions known to cause degradation.<br>
In some cases the biomass may not need to be dehydrated, and the extraction and<br>
fractionation can be carried out on the wet biomass. Further downstream processing may<br>
be needed to isolate the active compound depending on the intended final product.<br>
Use of solvents and enzymes might help with cellular disruption and product recovery but<br>
care must be taken regarding what aids are used if the product is intended for human<br>
consumption.<br>
NIES-N-836. B. braunii, sourced from Japan (NIES culture collection centre) was<br>
obtained from Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore, India and was<br>
used for evaluation of the performace of the reactor and other studies.<br>
Example 1<br>
In order to inroduce flash light effect, a wire strip is intermittently interposed between<br>
light source and tube. In an embodiment, for every tubular length of 2.3 cm the wire strip<br>
has a thickness of 0.3 cm.<br>
Thus Flash-Lighi effective ratio = time in darkness / time in light = 0.3/2.0 =1: 0.15<br>
Example 2<br>
The Biomass estimation is carried out by the following steps:<br>
1. 25ml. medium is harvested.<br>
2. Take eppendorf and pre-weigh it.<br>
3. Transfer the pellet into eppendorf and lyophilize.<br>
4. Weigh the eppendorf again. The difference hi weights is the weight of the biomass.<br>
Hydrocarbon estimation by gravimetric method:<br>
1. Sonicate known quantity of biomass in n-hexane for 30 min.<br>
2. Centrifuge and take the supernatant in pre-weighed vials and evaporate the solvent<br>
under nitrogen to complete dryness.<br>
3. Repeat the extraction 2 more times, pool the solvents and evaporate to complete<br>
dryness with nitrogen.<br>
4. The weight of hydrocarbons is calculated by the difference in the weight of vial.<br>
Determination of growth of B. braunii:<br>
The doubling time for biomass growth rate in the exponential phase is found to be nearly<br>
8-9 days at 27°C and 14-15 days at 31°C as shown in the Figure 5 and 3 respectively. The<br>
hydrocarbon accumulation was found to be growth associated and comprised 50-55% of<br>
the cell mass as shown in Figures 4 and 6.<br><br><br><br><br>
