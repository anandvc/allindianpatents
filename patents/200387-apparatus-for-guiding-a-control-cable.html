				<td>APPARATUS FOR GUIDING A CONTROL CABLE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to mechanical control cable mechanisms and, more particularly, to an apparatus for guiding a control cable that may be used to control brake or gear shifting devices on a bicycle.<br>
Bicycle brake and shifting devices frequently use control cables of the type wherein an inner cable slides within an outer casing. Such control cables usually are connected between a controlling device, such as brake lever, a shifting lever or twist grip shifter, and a controlled device such as a brake or a transmission. Since the controlled device ordinarily is located at some distance from the controlling device, and since the controlled device ordinarily is mounted at a fixed position determined by the configuration of the bicycle, the control cable often must follow a curved path from the controlling device to the controlled device. Unfortunately, when the cable must follow a steep curve, the outer casing sometimes cannot bend satisfactorily, or else the friction between the inner cable and the outer casing caused by the curve becomes excessive. As a result, such steep curves cannot be accommodated by the control cable.<br>
One technique used to overcome the problem of bending the outer casing to follow sharp curves involves using a roller mounted on a frame, wherein the radius of curvature of the outer peripheral surface of the roller is set to match the required curve. The frame may includes a cable entry portion and a cable exit portion, wherein the inner wire enters the cable intry portion, passes around the roller, and exits the cable exit portion. While this technique is satisfactory for many applications, the radius of the roller can not be made too small because he inner cable also resists bending. For example, when an inner wire is constructed of nultiple strands wound together, the optimum radius of the roller is 200 times the diameter of  single strand. For a typical strand diameter of 0.32 millimeters, the optimum roller radius hen would be approximately 64 millimeters. Such a roller is extremely large and would be<br><br>
unacceptable for many applications. Consequently, smaller rollers are used despite the fact that such smaller rollers are not preferred. However, even though the inner cable may be forced to pass over the outer peripheral surface of such a smaller roller, the inner cable resists such bending and tends to rub against the cable entry portion and the cable exit portion of the frame. The smaller the radius of the roller, the greater the resistance to bending by the wire, and the greater the rubbing. Such rubbing can cause excessive friction, thus eliminating the benefit of using a roller to guide the inner cable around steep curves.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus for guiding a control cable of the type wherein the cable may be guided around steep curves without excessive friction. In one embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus for guiding a cable includes a frame and a cable guide member mounted to the frame for rotation around a guide member axis. The cable guide member includes a curved outer peripheral cable guide surface disposed radially outwardly from the guide member axis for guiding the cable. A bearing having a cable guide surface is disposed radially outwardly from the outer peripheral cable guide surface. When the cable guide member has a small radius of curvature, the cable may contact the bearing and thus avoid the excessive friction encountered in the prior art.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus for guiding a control cable includes a frame and a cable guide member mounted to the frame for rotation around a guide member axis. The cable guide member includes a curved outer peripheral cable guide surface disposed radially outwardly from the guide member axis for guiding the cable. A first bearing having a first bearing cable guide surface is disposed radially outwardly from the outer peripheral cable guide surface, and a second bearing having a second bearing cable guide surface is disposed radially outwardly from the outer peripheral cable guide surface. The first bearing is spaced apart from the second bearing in a circumferential direction of the outer peripheral cable guide surface. When the cable guide member has a small radius of curvature, the cable may contact the first and second bearings and again avoid the excessive friction encountered in the prior art.<br><br>
In a more specific embodiment, the frame includes a first cable duct and a second cable duct. The first cable duct includes a first opening that tangentially aligns with the outer peripheral cable guide surface of the cable guide member, and the second cable duct includes a second opening that tangentially aligns with the outer peripheral cable guide surface of the cable guide member. The inner wire passes through the first cable duct, passes around the outer peripheral guide surface of the cable guide member and passes through the second cable duct. The first bearing is aligned between the first cable duct and the outer peripheral guide surface of the cable guide member, and the second bearing is aligned between the second cable duct and the outer peripheral guide surface of the cable guide member. The bearings are thus positioned for maximum reduction of friction when the outer peripheral cable guide surface has a small radius of curvature. If desired, the first and second bearings may comprise first and second rollers which accommodate the cable with very small friction.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus for guiding a cable includes a frame and a cable guide member mounted to the frame for rotation around a guide member axis. The cable guide member includes a curved outer peripheral cable guide surface disposed radially outwardly from the guide member axis for guiding the cable, wherein the cable guide surface terminates at first and second ends. The cable guide member includes a first abutment and the frame includes a second abutment for contacting the first abutment and for limiting a range of motion of the cable guide member. In a more specific embodiment, the cable guide member and the cable guide surface each has an approximately semicircular shape. The cable guide member includes a bounded opening forming a first abutment and a second abutment, and the frame includes a projecting member which forms a third abutment disposed between the first and second abutments for contacting the first and second abutments and for limiting a range of motion of the cable guide member. A cable guide member constructed in this manner has a reduced size and weight over prior art structures.<br>
A cable guide constructed according to the present invention may be used wherever cable bends are desired. For example, the cable guide may be positioned at a controlling device such as a brake lever, shifting lever, twist grip shifter or other controlling device. Alternatively, the cable guide may be positioned at a controlled device such as a brake arm,<br><br>
hub   brake,   derailleur,   internal   hub   transmission,   or   other   controlled   device, transmission, or other controlled device.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a an apparatus for guiding a cable comprising: a frame; a cable guide member mounted to the frame for rotation around a guide member axis, wherein the cable guide member has a curved outer peripheral cable guide surface disposed radially outwardly fi-om the guide member axis (X) for guiding the cable; and a first bearing disposed radially outwardly fi-om the outer peripheral cable guide surface, wherein the first bearing has a first bearing cable guide surface; characterised in that the frame has first cable duct, and the first bearing is disposed in close proximity to the first cable duct.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a partial cross sectional front view of a particular embodiment of a cable guide according to the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a rear view of the apparatus shown in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 shows the apparatus or Figures 1 and 2 attached to a brake arm;<br>
Figure 4 shows the apparatus of Figures 1 and 2 attached to a control lever; and Figure 5 shows the apparatus of Figures 1 and 2 attached to a derailleur.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS Figure 1 is a partial cross sectional front view of a particular embodiment of a cable guide 10 according to the present invention, and Figure 2 is a rear view of cable guide 10. As shown in those Figures, cable guide 10 includes a fi-ame 14 having a first cable duct 18 and a second cable duct 22. In this embodiment, first and second cable ducts 18 and 22 are formed as tubular members having first and second cable duct openings 26 and 30. As shown in Figures 1 and 3, first cable duct opening 26 is sized for receiving an outer casing 40 of a control cable 42 therein, and second cable duct opening 30 is sized for receiving an inner cable 34 of control cable 42 therethrough.<br><br>
A cable guide member 50 having a curved outer peripheral cable guide surface<br>
54 is mounted to frame 14 through a pivot shaft 58 for rotation around a guide<br>
member axis X. In this embodiment, cable guide member 50 and cable guide surface<br>
54 each has a roughly semicircular shape and includes openings 60, 62 and 64 to<br>
reduce the size and weight of the structure. Opening 62 includes abutments 65 and 66<br>
which cooperate with an abutment formed by a stop pin 44 extending from a side of<br>
frame 14 to limit the range of motion of cable guide member 50. Opening 62 should<br>
have an angular distance that corresponds roughly to the intended cable stroke. Stop<br>
pin 44 and abutments 65 and 66 allow the use of a cable guide member 50 having a<br>
semicircular shape without the risk of the inner cable 34	<br><br>
talling off the cable guide surface 54.<br>
A first bearing in the form of a first roller 70 is mounted to frame 14 through a pivot shaft 74 for rotation around a first roller axis Y, and a second bearing in the form of a second roller 78 is mounted to frame 14 through a pivot shaft 80 for rotation around a second roller axis Z, wherein guide member axis X, first roller axis Y and second roller axis Z are substantially parallel to each other. Roller 70 is disposed radially outwardly from outer peripheral cable guide surface 54 in close proximity to first cable duct 18 and is aligned between first cable duct 18 and outer peripheral cable guide surface 54. Similarly, roller 78 is disposed radially outwardly from outer peripheral cable guide surface 54 in close proximity to second cable duct 22 and is aligned between second cable duct 22 and outer peripheral cable guide surface 54. In this embodiment, cable guide member 50, first roller 70 and second roller 78 are completely exposed on frame 14.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, first and second cable duct openings 26 and 30 both are substantially tangentially aligned with outer peripheral cable guide surface 54. Furthermore, first and second rollers 70 and 78 include respective first and second cable guide surfaces 86 and 88 that lie substantially in the same plane as outer peripheral cable guide surface 54. In this embodiment, first and second rollers 70 and 78 are positioned at substantially the same radial distance from guide member axis X. Inner cable 34 passes tlirough first cable duct opening 26, passes around outer peripheral cable guide surface 54, and passes through second cable duct opening 30. If outer peripheral cable guide surface 54 has a small radius of curvature and therefore defines a steep curve such that inner cable 34 resists bending around outer peripheral cable guide surface 54, then inner cable 34 will contact first cable guide surface 86 and/or second cable guide surfaces 88. Unlike prior art structures, very little friction is created between inner cable 34 and rollers 70 and 78, so cable performance is not adversely affected. In this embodiment, cable guide member 50 may have a radius of 17.5 millimeters or more, preferably 19.2 millimeters, or 20 millimeters to the centerline of the inner cable.<br>
Figure 3 shows cable guide 10 mounted to a brake assembly 100. In this embodiment.<br><br>
brake assembly 100 includes a brake arm 104 and a brake arm 106. A brake shoe 108 is mounted to an intermediate portion of brake arm 104, and a brake shoe 110 is mounted to an intermediate portion of brake arm 106. A connecting link 114 having a mounting flange 115 is pivotably mounted to the upper end of brake arm 104 through a pivot shaft 118, and a wire connector 122 is disposed at the upper end of brake arm 106. Frame 14 of cable guide 10 is mounted to connecting link 114 by inserting second cable duct 22 into mounting flange 115. Outer casing 40 of a control cable 42 is fitted within first cable duct opening 26, and the end of inner cable 34 is fixed to wire connector 122. A sealing member 116 is fitted around second cable duct 22 and inner wire 34 to help prevent contaminants from entering second cable duct 22. As a result of cable guide member 50, first roller 70 and second roller 78, inner cable 34 bends around an angle of approximately 90° with little friction as it proceeds from brake arm 104 to brake arm 106.<br>
Figure 4 shows the cable guide 10 mounted to a control lever assembly 200. In this embodiment, a mounting bracket 204 is structured for mounting a control member such as a brake lever 208 to a handlebar II. Brake lever 208 is pivotably mounted to mounting bracket 204 through a pivot shaft 212, and mounting bracket 204 includes a cable adjustment barrel 216 having a barrel opening 220 through which inner cable 34 passes. Frame 14 of cable guide 10 is mounted to mounting bracket 204 by inserting second cable duct 22 into barrel opening 220. As a result of cable guide member 50, first roller 70 and second roller 78, inner table 34 bends around an angle of approximately 90° with little friction as it proceeds from first cable duct 18 to the cable attachment point (not shown) on lever 208.<br>
Figure 5 shows the cable guide 10 mounted to a derailleur 300. Derailleur 300 may be . conventional derailleur that includes a base member 304 which mounts derailleur 300 to a licycle frame (not shown), link members 308 and 312, and a movable member 316 upporting a chain guide 320. Base member 304, link members 308 and 312, and movable member 316 are connected together in the conventional way to form a four-bar linkage mechanism for guiding chain guide 320 among a plurality of sprockets (not shown) mounted  a rear wheel of the bicycle. Of course, the invention also could be applied to a front erailleur, and derailleurs other than a four-bar linkage type may be used as well. In this<br><br>
embodiment, first cable duct 18 and second cable duct 22 form an acute angle, rather than the 90° angle formed in the previous embodiments. Frame 14 of cable guide 10 is mounted to derailleur 300 by inserting second cable duct 22 into an opening 322 of a cable guide 324 formed in base member 304. In a conventional derailleur, opening 322 ordinarily is sized for receiving outer casing 40 of control cable 42, so second cable duct 22 has approximately the same outside diameter as outer casing 40. Inner cable 34 of control cable 42 passes through cable guide 324 and attaches to a cable connector 330 fixed to the side of link 308. As a result of cable guide member 50, first roller 70 and second roller 78, inner cable 34 can bend around a very acute angle (or any desired angle) with little friction as it proceeds from first cable duct 18 to cable connector 330.<br>
While the above is a description of various embodiments of the present invention, further modifications may be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, cable guide member 50 may be formed as a full circle as shown in phantom in Figure 1 instead of a semicircle. Cable guide member may be formed as a solid, and stop pin 44 may be omitted. Frame 14 may be formed to cover part or all of cable guide member 50, first roller 70 or second roller 78 rather than leaving these components exposed. Rollers 70 and 78 may be replaced by solid members having low coefficients of friction. First cable duct 18 and second cable duct 22 may be shaped to mate with any desired structure, and they may be placed at whatever orientation is desired to make the inner cable bend at the desired angle. The components may be formed from many different materials. For example, cable guide member 50, first roller 70 and second roller 78 may be formed from POM, and frame 14 may be formed from aluminum.
