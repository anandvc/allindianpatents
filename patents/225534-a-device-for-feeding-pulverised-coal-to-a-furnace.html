				<td>This invention relates to a device for feeding pulverised coal to a furnace. This invention specifically relates to a system of feeding pulverised coal to a furnace, such as a drop tube furnace.<br>
The present invention finds usage In studying chemical reactivity and combustion behaviour of various coals in an experimental furnace such as a drop tube furnace.<br>
Experimental furnaces are generally used to simulate combustion and deposition conditions in pulverised fuel boilers. The essential characteristics of such reactors are heating rate, high temperature, dynamic particle phase and atmosphere simulating conditions. For example, the essential components of an experimental furnace such as a vertical drop tube furnace system include a fuel feeder, a reactor and equipment for sampling and analysis. The drop tube furnace is a valuable tool when attempting to simulate coal combustion on a small scale. In this furnace pulverised coal is carried down through a water cooled feeder into a heated ceramic tube containing pre-heated all After passing through the tube the particles are collected in a water cooled probe in different zones where the reactions are effectively quenched. The flow of these gases is kept sufficiently low to ensure that laminar flow conditions are met. Turbulent flow would cause the reduction of collection efficiency and the lowering of the sample integrity. The degree of decomposition experienced by the particles depends on conditions within the furnace. The residence time inside the furnace, oxygen content and the temperature can be altered as per the requirements.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No: 5,997,234, wherein a silicon pellet feed system has<br>
been described for use with a silicon melt furnace used to grow a silicon web. A reservoir for<br>
containing feed particles is coupled to the upper end of a feed tube. The lower end of the feed<br>
tube is positioned adjacent to a pair of rotatable drive rollers driven by a motor through a<br>
coupling and a pair of gears. The rollers are mounted at an angle with respect to horizontal and<br>
the outlet end of the roller feed path is located above a delivery tube leading to the silicon melt<br>
furnace.	The      elements	are       surrounded      by        an    enclosure    having    a<br>
vacuum outlet for       enabling	the       enclosure       to	be  evacuated      to    a<br><br>
working vacuum level and a gas inlet for enabling an inert gas to be back filled into the<br>
enclosure. The feed rate is determined by the angle of the drive rollers, the speed of the<br>
motor and the shape of the bottom end of the feed tube. The rollers are resilient to<br>
provide enhanced surface friction for the particle flow and to prevent trapped feed<br>
particles from jamming the motor. The said system is not suitable for the purposes of an<br>
experimental furnace such as a vertical drop tube furnace system, which requires<br>
feeding pulverised coal to the furnace.<br>
Prior art search for a feeding system for feeding pulverised coal to a furnace was made<br>
based on literature survey and patent databases, which did not yield any relevant<br>
references.<br>
Hence, there is a definite need to provide a feeding system for a furnace, specifically a<br>

pneumatic vibrator positioned on the periphery of the feeder hopper, a needle valve<br>
arrangement in the said feed hopper, a depth gauge micrometer, a distribution chamber<br>
with primary and secondary airline at the bottom of the said feed hopper. Adjusting the<br>
pressure of compressed air allows setting of the frequency of vibration of me pneumatic<br>
vibrator. The needle valve arrangement in conjunction with the vibratory hopper<br>
controls the feed rate. The rate of coal flow is measured by the depth gauge<br>
micrometer. The distribution chamber with primary and secondary airline at the bottom<br>
of the said feed hopper allows uniform mixing of air with coal before being charged into<br>
the furnace reactor.<br>

combination a feed hopper incorporating a needle valve arrangement, a pneumatic<br>
vibrator with adjustable pressure of compressed air, a depth gauge micrometer and a<br>
distribution chamber having primary and secondary compressed air-lines, capable of<br>
controlling and measuring a consistent feed rate of pulverized coal to a furnace reactor.<br>
The device of the present invention for feeding pulverized coal to a furnace works as<br>
follows:<br>
Pulverised coal is stored in the feed hopper (1). Pulverised coal is pushed from hopper<br>
to the distribution chamber (6) with the help of the pneumatic vibrator (2) and<br>
compressed primary air (4). Primary air is around 15-30% of the total air. By changing<br>
the frequency of vibration and by adjusting the position of needle valve (3) the coal flow<br>
rate is adjusted. The frequency of vibration in the pneumatic vibrator (2) is set by<br>
changing the pressure of compressed air. The rate of coal flow is measured by the<br>
depth gauge micrometer (8). After hopper coal with primary air enters the distribution<br>
chamber (6), the coal is mixed with secondary air uniformly. From the distribution<br>
chamber (6) the pulverised coal and air mixture enters the reactor (7).<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the device of the present<br>
invention for feeding pulverized coal to a furnace in actual practice and should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
Pulverised coal was stored in the feed hopper of capacity 5 kg. Pulverised coal was<br>
pushed from the hopper to the distribution chamber with the help of the pneumatic<br>
vibrator. The pressure of air for pneumatic vibrator was 1.5 kg/cm2. Compressed<br>
primary air rate was 60 liters per minute and pressure was 1.6 kg/cm2. The secondary<br>
air rate was 130 liters per minute. From the distribution chamber the pulverised coal and<br>
air mixture enterered the furnace reactor. The rate of coal flow as measured by the<br>
depth gauge micrometer was 1.5 kg/hr.<br>
Example-2<br>
Pulverised coal was stored in the feed hopper of capacity 5 kg. Pulverised coal was<br>
pushed from the hopper to the distribution chamber with the help of the pneumatic<br>
vibrator. The pressure of air for pneumatic vibrator was 1.8 kg/cm2. Compressed<br>
primary air rate was 65 liters per minute and pressure was 1.7 kg/cm2. The secondary<br>
air rate was 140 liters per minute. From the distribution chamber the pulverised coal and<br>
air mixture enterered the furnace reactor. The rate of coal flow as measured by the<br>
depth gauge micrometer was 2.0 kg/hr.<br>
Example-3<br>

pushed from the hopper to the distribution chamber with the help of the pneumatic<br>
vibrator. The pressure of air for pneumatic vibrator was 1.3 kg/cm2. Compressed<br>
primary air rate was 50 liters per minute and pressure was 1.3 kg/cm2. The secondary<br>
air rate was 123 liters per minute. From the distribution chamber the pulveri'seo coal and<br>
air mixture enterered the furnace reactor. The rate of coal flow as measured by the<br>
