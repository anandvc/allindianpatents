METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE<br>
UPON LIFE EXPECTANCY OF AN ELECTRIC ENERGY STORAGE DEVICE<br>
IN A HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to life expectancy of an electrical<br>
energy storage device. More particularly, the invention is concerned with the<br>
effects that periods of rest have upon such life expectancy.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Various hybrid powertrain systems use electrical energy storage<br>
devices to supply electrical energy to electrical machines, which are operable<br>
to provide motive torque, often in conjunction with an internal combustion<br>
engine. One such hybrid powertrain architecture comprises a two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input<br>
member for receiving power from a prime mover power source and an output<br>
member for delivering power from the transmission to a vehicle driveline.<br>
First and second electric machines, i.e. motor/generators, are operatively<br>
connected to an energy storage device for interchanging electrical power<br>
therebetween. A control unit is provided for regulating the electrical power<br>
interchange between the energy storage device and the electric machines. The<br>
control unit also regulates electrical power interchange between the first and<br>
second electric machines.<br>
[0003] One of the design considerations in vehicle powertrain systems is an<br>
ability to provide consistent vehicle performance and component/system<br>
service life. Hybrid vehicles, and more specifically the battery pack systems<br>
utilized therewith, provide vehicle system designers with new challenges and<br>
tradeoffs. It has been observed that service life of an electrical energy storage<br>
device, e.g. a battery pack system, increases as resting temperature of the<br>
battery pack decreases.    However, cold operating temperature introduces<br><br>
2<br>
limits in battery charge/discharge performance until temperature of the pack is<br>
increased. A warm battery pack is more able to supply required power to the<br>
vehicle propulsion system, but continued warm temperature operation may<br>
result in diminished service life.<br>
[0004] Modern hybrid vehicle systems manage various aspects of operation<br>
of the hybrid system to effect improved service life of the battery. For<br>
example, depth of battery discharge is managed, amp-hour (A-h) throughput is<br>
limited, and convection fans are used to cool the battery pack. Ambient<br>
environmental conditions in which the vehicle is operated has largely been<br>
ignored. However, the ambient environmental conditions may have<br>
significant effect upon battery service life. Specifically, same models of<br>
hybrid vehicles released into various geographic areas throughout North<br>
America would likely not result in the same battery pack life, even if all the<br>
vehicles were driven on the same cycle. The vehicle's environment must be<br>
considered if a useful estimation of battery life is to be derived. Additionally,<br>
customer expectations, competition and government regulations impose<br>
standards of performance, including for service life of battery packs, which<br>
must be met.<br>
[0005] End of service life of a battery pack may be indicated by ohmic<br>
resistance of the battery pack. The ohmic resistance of the battery pack is<br>
typically flat during much of the service life of the vehicle and battery pack<br>
however, thus preventing a reliable estimate of real-time state-of-life ('SOL')<br>
of the battery pack throughout most of the service life. Instead, ohmic<br>
resistance is most useful to indicate incipient end of service life of the battery<br>
pack.<br>
[0006] Furthermore, service life of a battery pack is affected by resting<br>
temperature, i.e. life of a battery pack system increases as resting temperature<br>
of the battery pack decreases. Therefore a battery pack control system that is<br>
operable to determine a state-of-life of a monitored battery pack would benefit<br>
from a parametric value that is indicative of an effect of temperature of the<br>
battery pack during quiescent or stasis periods.  Such quiescent periods occur<br><br>
3<br>
when the battery pack is neither charging nor discharging, e.g. when a hybrid<br>
vehicle using the battery pack is shutdown.<br>
[0007] Therefore, it would be useful to have a method and apparatus which<br>
determines an effect of temperature during a quiescent period on life<br>
expectancy of a battery pack for a hybrid vehicle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] A hybrid vehicular powertrain includes an electrical energy storage<br>
device operative to exchange electrical energy with a first and second electric<br>
machines each machine operable to impart torque to a two-mode, compound-<br>
split electro-mechanical transmission having four fixed gear ratios and two<br>
continuously variable operating modes. A method to determine an effect of<br>
temperature during a period of vehicle inactivity on life expectancy of the<br>
electrical energy storage device includes determining a weighted average<br>
temperature of the electrical energy storage device during the period of<br>
inactivity. The weighted average temperature is based upon an average<br>
temperature of the electrical energy storage device during the period of<br>
inactivity and a temperature of the electrical energy storage device<br>
substantially contemporaneous with a vehicle shut-down. Further, the method<br>
includes determining a resting temperature factor for the electrical energy<br>
storage device based upon the weighted average temperature of the electrical<br>
energy storage device during the period of inactivity. And, a life expectancy<br>
for the electrical energy storage device is determined based on the resting<br>
temperature factor.<br>

arrangement of parts, an embodiment of which is described in detail and<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and<br>
wherein:<br><br>

[0010]    Fig.  1   is a schematic diagram of an exemplary architecture for a<br>
control system and powertrain, in accordance with the present invention;<br>
[0011]    Fig. 2 is an algorithmic block diagram, in accordance with the present<br>
invention; and,<br>
[0012]    Figs. 3 and 4 are exemplary data graphs, in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Fig. 1 shows a control system and an exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
system which has been constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
invention. The exemplary hybrid powertrain system comprises a plurality of<br>
torque-generative devices operable to supply motive torque to a transmission<br>
device, which supplies motive torque to a driveline. The torque-generative<br>
devices preferably comprise an internal combustion engine 14 and first and<br>
second electric machines 56, 72 operable to convert electrical energy supplied<br>
from an electrical storage device (ESD) 74 to motive torque. It is understood<br>
that ESD may include one or more batteries or alternative electrical energy<br>
storage apparatus. The exemplary transmission device 10 comprises a two-<br>
mode, compound-split electro-mechanical transmission having four fixed gear<br>
ratios and two continuously variable operating modes, and includes a plurality<br>
of gears operable to transmit the motive torque to an output shaft 64 and<br>
driveline through a plurality of torque-transfer devices contained therein.<br>
Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in detail in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6.953,409. entitled "Two-Mode, Compound-Split, Hybrid<br>
Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed Ratios", which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
5<br>
[0014] The control system comprises a distributed control module<br>
architecture interacting via a local area communications network to provide<br>
ongoing control to the powertrain system, including the engine 14, the<br>
electrical machines 56, 72, and the transmission 10.<br>
[0015] The exemplary powertrain system been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention. The hybrid transmission 10<br>
receives input torque from torque-generative devices, including the engine 14<br>
and the electrical machines 56, 72, as a result of energy conversion from fuel<br>
or electrical potential stored in electrical energy storage device (BSD) 74. The<br>
ESD 74 typically comprises one or more batteries. Other electrical energy<br>
storage devices that have the ability to store electric power and dispense<br>
electric power may be used in place of the batteries without altering the<br>
concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74 is preferably sized based upon<br>
factors including regenerative requirements, application issues related to<br>
typical road grade and temperature, and, propulsion requirements such as<br>
emissions, power assist and electric range. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to transmission power inverter module (TPIM) 19 via DC lines<br>
referred to as transfer conductor 27. The TPIM 19 transfers electrical energy<br>
to the first electrical machine 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19<br>
similarly transfer electrical energy to the second electrical machine 72 by<br>
transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is transferable between the electrical<br>
machines 56, 72 and the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is<br>
being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters and<br>
respective motor control modules configured to receive motor control<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality.<br>
[0016] The electrical machines 56, 72 preferably comprise known<br>
motors/generator devices. In motoring control, the respective inverter<br>
receives current from the ESD and provides AC current to the respective<br>
motor over transfer conductors 29 and 31. In regeneration control, the<br>
respective inverter receives AC current from the motor over the respective<br><br>
6<br>
transfer conductor and provides current to the DC lines 27. The net DC<br>
current provided to or from the inverters determines the charge or discharge<br>
operating mode of the electrical energy storage device 74. Preferably,<br>
Motor A 56 and Motor B 72 are three-phase AC electrical machines and the<br>
inverters comprise complementary three-phase power electronic devices.<br>
[0017] The elements shown in Fig. 1, and described hereinafter, comprise a<br>
subset of an overall vehicle control architecture, and are operable to provide<br>
coordinated system control of the powertrain system described herein. The<br>
control system is operable to gather and synthesize pertinent information and<br>
inputs, and execute algorithms to control various actuators to achieve control<br>
targets, including such parameters as fuel economy, emissions, performance,<br>
driveability, and protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and<br>
motors 56, 72. The distributed control module architecture of the control<br>
system comprises an engine control module ('ECM') 23, transmission control<br>
module (TCM') 17, battery pack control module ('BPCM') 21, and the<br>
Transmission Power Inverter Module ('TPIM') 19. A hybrid control module<br>
('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and coordination of the<br>
aforementioned control modules. There is a User Interface ('UI') 13 operably<br>
connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator typically<br>
controls or directs operation of the powertrain, including the transmission 10.<br>
Exemplary vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a<br>
brake pedal, transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control.<br>
Within the control system, each of the aforementioned control modules<br>
communicates with other control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local<br>
area network ('LAN') communications bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for<br>
structured communication of control parameters and commands between the<br>
various control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is<br>
application-specific. By way of example, one communications protocol is the<br>
Society of Automotive Engineers standard J1939. The LAN bus and<br>
appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-control module<br>
interfacing between the aforementioned control modules, and other control<br><br>
7<br>
modules providing functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and<br>
vehicle stability.<br>
[0018] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TP1M 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, the HCP 5 generates various commands, including: an engine<br>
torque command, clutch torque commands, for various clutches of the hybrid<br>
transmission 10; and motor torque commands, for the electrical machines A<br>
and B, respectively.<br>
[0019] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates an axle torque request. For<br>
simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally having bi-directional interface with<br>
engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various parameters that are sensed by ECM<br>
23 include engine coolant temperature, engine input speed to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0020] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
control signals, i.e. clutch torque commands to the clutches of the<br>
transmission.<br>
[0021] The BPCM 21 interacts with various sensors associated with the ESD<br>
74 to derive information about the state of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. Such<br>
sensors comprise voltage and electrical current sensors, as well as ambient<br>
sensors operable to measure operating conditions of the ESD 74 including,<br>
e.g., temperature and resistance measured across terminals of the ESD 74 (not<br>
shown). Sensed parameters include ESD voltage, VBAT, ESD current, IBAT, and<br>
ESD temperature, TBAT.   Derived parameters preferably include ESD current,<br><br>
8<br>
IBAT, ESD internal, RBAT, as may be measured across terminals of the ESD,<br>
ESD state-of-charge, SOC, and other states of the BSD, including available<br>
electrical power, PBAT_MIN and PBAT_MAX.<br>
[0022] The Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPIM) 19 includes the<br>
aforementioned power inverters and motor control modules configured to<br>
receive motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom to<br>
provide motor drive or regeneration functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable<br>
to generate torque commands for machines A and B based upon input from<br>
the IICP 5, which is driven by operator input through Ul 13 and system<br>
operating parameters. Motor torques are implemented by the control<br>
system, including the TPIM 19, to control the machines A and B. Individual<br>
motor speed signals are derived by the TPIM 19 from the motor phase<br>
information or conventional rotation sensors. The TPIM 19 determines and<br>
communicates motor speeds to the IICP 5.<br>
[0023] Each of the aforementioned control modules of the control system is<br>
preferably a general-purpose digital computer generally comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, read only memory (ROM), random<br>
access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0024] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br><br>
9<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0025] The action described hereinafter occurs during active operation of the<br>
vehicle, i.e. that period of time when operation of the engine and electrical<br>
machines are enabled by the vehicle operator, typically through a 'key-on'<br>
action. Quiescent periods include periods of time when operation of the<br>
engine and electrical machines are disabled by the vehicle operator, typically<br>
through a "key-off action. In response to an operator's action, as captured by<br>
the UI 13, the supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other<br>
control modules determine required transmission output torque. To.<br>
Selectively operated components of the hybrid transmission 10 are<br>
appropriately controlled and manipulated to respond to the operator demand.<br>
For example, in the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 1, when the<br>
operator has selected a forward drive range and manipulates either the<br>
accelerator pedal or the brake pedal, the F1CP 5 determines how and when the<br>
vehicle is to accelerate or decelerate. The HCP 5 also monitors the parametric<br>
states of the torque-generative devices, and determines the output of the<br>
transmission required to effect a desired rate of acceleration or deceleration.<br>
Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates over a range of<br>
output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator demand.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic diagram is shown,<br>
demonstrating an exemplary method for estimating a state of life of the BSD<br>
74 in real-time, based upon monitored inputs. The method is preferably<br>
executed as one or more algorithms in one of the controllers of the control<br>
system, typically the HCP 5. The estimated state of life of the ESD 74<br>
('SOLK') is preferably stored as a scalar value in a non-volatile memory<br>
location for reference, updating, and for resetting, each occurring at<br>
appropriate points during life of the vehicle and the BSD 74.<br><br>
10<br>
[0027] The exemplary method and apparatus to estimate state-of-life<br>
('SOL") of the energy storage device in the hybrid control system in real-time<br>
is disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent Application No. ___/____________.<br>
Attorney Docket No. GP-308433, entitled "Method and Apparatus for Real-<br>
Time Life Estimation of an Electric Energy Storage Device in a Hybrid<br>
Electric Vehicle", which is incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary<br>
method and apparatus to estimate state-of-life comprises an algorithm that<br>
monitors in real-time an ESD current IBAT (in amperes), an ESD temperature<br>
TBAT, an ESD voltage VBAT, an ESD ohmic resistance RBAT, and a ESD State-of<br>
-Charge factor ('SOC'). These parameters, IBAT, TBAT. VBAT, and RBAT, are used<br>
to determine a parametric value for ESD current integrated over time 110, a<br>
parametric value for depth of discharge factor 112, a parametric value for<br>
driving temperature factor 114, and, a parametric value for resting temperature<br>
factor TREST 116.<br>
[0028] Each of the aforementioned factors, i.e. the integrated ESD current,<br>
depth of discharge, driving temperature factor, and resting temperature factor,<br>
are combined, preferably by a summing operation shown in block 120 with a<br>
previously determined state of life factor, SOLK, to determine a parametric<br>
value for the SOL, i.e. SOLK+1, which is shown as an output to block 120. The<br>
algorithm to determine the state of life factor, SOLK, is preferably executed<br>
multiple times during each trip (defined as an engine on-off cycle). The<br>
resting temperature factor TREST preferably comprises a derived parametric<br>
value. As described hereinbelow, resting temperature factor TREST 116 is<br>
determined based upon a time-based temperature of the ESD 74 during<br>
quiescent periods of ESD operation. Quiescent periods of ESD operation are<br>
characterized by ESD power flow that is de minimus whereas active periods of<br>
ESD operation are characterized by ESD power now that is not de minimus.<br>
That is to say, quiescent periods of ESD operation are generally characterized<br>
by no or minimal current flow into or out of the ESD. With respect to an ESD<br>
associated with a hybrid vehicle propulsion system for example, quiescent<br>
periods of ESD operation may be associated with periods of vehicle inactivity<br><br>
11<br>
(e.g. powertrain, including electric machines, is inoperative such as during<br>
periods when the vehicle is not being driven and accessory loads are off but<br>
may include such periods characterized by parasitic current draws as are<br>
required for continuing certain controller operations including, for example,<br>
the operations associated with the present invention). Active periods of ESD<br>
operation in contrast may be associated with periods of vehicle activity (e.g.<br>
accessory loads are on and/or the powertrain, including electric machines, is<br>
operative such as during periods when the vehicle is being driven wherein<br>
current flows may be into or out of the ESD).<br>
[0029] Referring now to Fig. 3, a method and system for determining the<br>
resting temperature factor 116 is now described. The method is preferably<br>
executed as one or more algorithms and associated calibrations in one of the<br>
aforementioned controllers, preferably the HCP 5. The method and system<br>
include determining a temperature of the electrical energy storage device when<br>
the device enters the quiescent period, determining an average temperature of<br>
the electrical energy storage device during the quiescent period, determining a<br>
weighted average temperature of the electrical energy storage device during<br>
the quiescent period based upon the average temperature and the shutdown<br>
temperature; and, determining a parametric value for the resting temperature<br>
factor 116, based upon the weighted average temperature, which is useable to<br>
adjust a life expectancy parameter of the electrical energy storage device.<br>
This is discussed in greater detail hcreinbelow.<br>
[0030] Determining temperature of the electrical energy storage device when<br>
the device enters the quiescent period preferably comprises capturing a value<br>
for ESD temperature, TBAT when the vehicle is shutdown by the operator, e.g.<br>
at a key-off event. Determining an average temperature of the electrical<br>
energy storage device during the quiescent period preferably comprises<br>
executing an algorithm to monitor ESD temperature, TBAT at regular intervals<br>
during the quiescent period, and calculating a running average value. Elapsed<br>
time during shutdown is monitored. A weighting factor is determined from<br>
the shutdown temperature, the average temperature, and the elapsed time. The<br><br>
12<br>
weighting factor preferably comprises a curve having a nonlinear time decay<br>
based upon temperature of the system, with the decay factor based upon<br>
whether the system is heating or cooling. The weighting factor is determined<br>
by quantity of parametric measurements of temperature used to calculate the<br>
resting temperature factor (block 116). For example, when a large quantity of<br>
temperature samples are taken indicating a long resting time, the parametric<br>
value for resting temperature closely approximates actual temperature, and the<br>
resting temperature factor would comprise a time-average value of the resting<br>
temperature. The weighting factor is applied to the average temperature of the<br>
ESD during the quiescent period to determine a weighted average temperature<br>
during the quiescent period.<br>
[0031] The resting temperature factor 116, useable for determining the<br>
aforementioned life expectancy parameter SOL of the electrical energy storage<br>
device, is determined based upon the weighted average temperature, as shown<br>
with reference to Fig. 3. Fig. 3 comprises a datagraph having temperature<br>
(degrees, C) as the on the X-axis, and parametric values for resting<br>
temperature factor 116 on the Y-axis. The curve comprises an exponential<br>
function having a nominal value, or zero point, at about 25 C. Establishing the<br>
nominal value for the resting temperature factor at a nominal temperature<br>
value of 25 C is preferable in the exemplary system because life-expectancy<br>
testing and data for the exemplary ESD 74 was conducted at an ambient<br>
temperature of 25 C. Therefore, a parametric value for nominal resting<br>
temperature factor 116 at 25 C is zero, and the parametric value changes for<br>
lower and higher resting temperatures. This includes increasing the resting<br>
temperature factor 116 when the weighted average temperature during the<br>
quiescent period is less than the nominal temperature value of 25 C, and<br>
decreasing the resting temperature factor 116 when the weighted average<br>
temperature during the quiescent period is greater than the nominal<br>
temperature value of 25 C.<br><br>
13<br>
[0032] As shown in Fig. 3, the resting temperature factor 116 increases<br>
exponentially with increasing weighted average temperature during the<br>
quiescent period, due to resulting decrease in life expectancy of typical ESDs<br>
resulting at higher ambient and higher ESD operating temperatures. The<br>
resting temperature factor 116 decreases exponentially with decreasing<br>
weighted average temperature during the quiescent period, due to resulting<br>
increase in life expectancy of typical ESDs resulting at higher ambient and<br>
higher ESD operating temperatures. Specific calibration values for resting<br>
temperature factors 116 at various temperatures are application-specific, and<br>
depend upon design of the specific ESD, the design life-expectancy of the<br>
ESD, and operating characteristics of the hybrid system utilizing the ESD.<br>
The resting temperature factor 116 is an element of the control system for the<br>
aforementioned powertrain system.<br>
[0033] Referring now to Fig. 4, an exemplary datagraph is shown for a<br>
specific application, comprising an effect of ESD temperature on the resting<br>
temperature factor. Based upon an elapsed resting time and ESD temperature<br>
during the resting time, a resting temperature factor is determinable. The<br>
plotted lines comprise lines of equal effect, i.e. the lines reflect a<br>
time/temperature relationship that results in a similar change in ESD life. For<br>
example, a short elapsed time at a higher temperature has a similar effect on<br>
ESD life as a longer elapsed time at a lower temperature.<br>

preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications and<br>
alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
