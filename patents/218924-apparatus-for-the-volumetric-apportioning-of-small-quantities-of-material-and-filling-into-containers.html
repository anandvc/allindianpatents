The invention is based on an apparatus for the volumetric apportioning of small quantities of material and filling of the latter into containers <br>
In the case of a known apparatus of this type, the material to be apportioned, for example medical powder, granules or similar portable material, is compacted by rams into the narrow apportioning chambers, which are open at the bottom, with the result that it is held together by bridge-forming in the form of a compact while it is transported to the discharging station. However, sometimes part crumbles away on the underside, with the result that the dose is reduced and the apparatus is soiled while in operation.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The apparatus according to the invention has the advantage that the apportioned quantities of material have in each case the same volume. Since no compact is formed, less heat is generated in a quantity of material, which is important In particular in the case of heat-sensitive medicaments. Also, the apparatus according to the invention can be used for processing tacky products.<br>
The measures presented in the subclaims are advantageous developments and improvements of the apportioning apparatus specified in Claim 1.<br>
Drawing<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is	.^	<br><br>
represented in the drawing and is described in more detail below. Figure l shows an apportioning apparatus in cross-section, Figure 2 shows the apportioning apparatus according to Figure 1 in a view from below and Figure 3 shows a partial, cross- of the apportioning apparatus in cross-section, in the plane III-III of Figure 2.<br>
Description of the exemplary embodiment<br>
The apportioning apparatus represented serves in particular for apportioning small quantities of material such as medical powders, granules and similar pour able products and for filling the latter into preferably hard-gelatin capsules. A relatively thick apportioning disc 11, which has sum upwardly projecting surround 12, is fastened on a vertical shaft 13 and is turned step by step by a specific smgle in each case. The apportioning disc 11 has, uniformly distributed on a pitch circle, for example six groups with in each case five apportioning chambers 15 in the form of narrow through-bores. The lower opening of the apportioning chambers 15 of a respective group can be closed by means of a slide 17. Each slide 17 has, corresponding to the arrangement of the apportioning chambers 15 of a group, congruent apertures 18, which in the filling position are offset with respect to the apportioning chambers 15 (Figure 3) and in the discharging position are aligned with them. The actuate slides 17, which bear against the underside of the apportioning disc 11, are mounted displaceably, sliding on an arc of a circle, between stop lugs 25, 26 in graduations 21, 22 of two bearing rings 23, 24, which are fastened specially with respect to the apportioning disc 11 on the underside of the latter. Tension springs 27, which are hooked on the one hand on a pin 28 on the slides 17 and on the other hand on a pin 29 on the inner bearing ring 23, pull the slides 17 into the closed position, in which they shut off the lower opening of the apportioning chambers 15 (Figure 3) . For opening the apportioning chambers 15, there protrudes from the underside of each slide 17 a stop pin 31, which strikes<br><br>
a bar 33, which can be extended into its circulating path, when a group of apportioning chambers 15 runs into the discharging station, with the result that the slide 17 concerned is displaced into its discharging position, in which its apertures 16 are in congruence with the associated apportioning chambers 15. Before the advancing of the apportioning disc 11, the bar 33 is withdrawn, with the result that the slide 17 concerned is returned by the associated tension spring 27 back into its closed position.<br>
The product to be apportioned and filled is deposited on the upper side of the apportioning disc 11, from where it is brushed by fixedly arranged diverters {not shown) upon rotation of the apportioning disc 11 into the apportioning chambers 15 of the latter outside its discharging region, the slides 17 being in their closed position. Before running into the discharging station, the upper openings of the apportioning chambers 15 are brushed off by the diverters, with the result that the product in the apportioning chambers 15 is flush with the upper side of the apportioning disc 11. in the final phase of a group of apportioning chambers 15 to be discharged running into the discharging or filling station, the stop pin 31 of the slide 17 concerned strikes the extended bar 33, with the result that the slide 17 is pressed into its discharging position. The material in the apportioning chambers 15 of the group of apportioning chambers 15 respectively brought into the discharging position is pushed by a group of rams 36, which can be moved up and down and which enter the apportioning chambers 15 to be discharged, downwards into presented lower parts a of hard-gelatin capsules. These lower parts a are seated in receptacles 41 of holders 42 of a closing wheel of the apparatus. The receptacles 41 are aligned congruently with the apportioning chambers 15.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A device (10) for metering and dispensing powder (1) into hard gelatin<br>
capsules or the like, having a filling-material container (11) for the powder (1), which<br>
can rotate cyclically and in the base (12) of which groups (2 to 5) of bores (13) for the<br>
powder (1) are formed, having compacting rams (21)  which can be moved into and<br>
out of the bores (13) in order to form powder compacts, and having transfer rams (22)<br>
which are surrounded by a deflector element (23) for the powder (1), for pushing the<br>
powder compacts moth provided capsule lower parts (6), characterized in that a space<br>
(30) for the powder (1) is formed between a peripheral wall (15) of the filling-material<br>
container (11) and the deflector element (23), so that the powder (1) located in the<br>
space (30) can be fed to that region of the first group (2) of bores (13) which follows<br>
the deflector element (23), as seen in the direction in which the powder (1) is<br>
conveyed.<br>
2.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the slides (17) are of an arcuate<br>
form and are displaceable on an arc, and are held in the closed position by a spring<br>
(27).<br>
3.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the slides (17) are arranged in a sliding manner in circular grooves (21, 22) of the apportioning disc (11).<br>
4.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 3, wherein, when it runs into the discharging station, a respective slide (17) is moved into its discharging position by a movable stop (33), counter to the force of the spring (27), and is released again before the advancing of the apportioning disc (11).<br><br>
5. The apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein in the circular grooves {21, 22) there are arranged fixed steps {25, 26), against which the slides (17) are drawn into the closed position by the springs (27).<br><br></td>
