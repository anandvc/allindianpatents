CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Applications No. 2004-083678, No. 2004-083702, No. 2004-083706, and No. 2004-083708 which were filed on March 22, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a vehicle.  The invention especially relates to a vehicle frame, a vehicle swing arm, a vehicle handlebar fixing structure, and an output shaft supporting structure for the vehicle.<br>
Description of the Related Art (Vehicle Frame)<br>
There has been well known in the art to provide the vehicle frame in which one main frame is bent and formed (Refer to US Patent No. 3,504,934, for example.}.<br>
Fig. 5 in US Patent No. 3,504,934 will be described in reference to Fig. 12 as follows. Reference numerals used in Fig. 12 are replaced with other reference numerals.<br>
Fig. 12 is a side elevational view of a vehicle provided with the prior art frame, and this figure shows<br><br>
that this frame is constituted by a lower bent part 302 where one main frame 301 of the vehicle is bent downward and by an upper bent part 303 bent upward, a saddle 304 is fixed to the upper bent part 303, a sub-frame assembly 307 is fixed to the intermediate part between the lower bent part 302 and the upper bent part 303 through a ball joint 306 and at the same time the rear part of the sub-frame assembly 307 is fixed through the ball joint 311 to the rear part of the main frame 301, more particularly the lower end of a downward directed portion 308 and the rear wheel 312 is fixed to the sub-frame assembly 307 through the wheel shaft.<br>
The lower bent part 302 and the upper bent part 303 of the main frame 301 are portions where plural locations of the pipe are bent into an obtuse angle shape. As its manufacturing method, when each of the bent portions is bent into a predetermined angle one by one, the number of forming steps is increased to cause its productivity to be deteriorated. If the number of bending locations is reduced, a bending shape is made simple and the similar downward protruding portion and the similar upward protruding portion are formed, its productivity could be improved. In addition, there is provided one main frame 301, so that it is desirable that its strength and rigidity are higher.<br><br>
Further, when the main frame 301 is not covered by a cover but entirely exposed outside, or a part of the main frame 301 is covered by the cover to cause it to be partly exposed outside, an outer appearance of the main frame 301 provides a preferable feeling to its owner, and its preferable value as a commodity can be increased. (Vehicle Swing Arm)<br>
There has been well known in the art to provide a swing arm comprised of a leaf spring (Refer to US Patent No. 4,405,027, for example.).<br>
FIG. 7 in US Patent No. 4,405,027 will be described in reference to Fig. 13 as follows. Reference numerals used in Fig. 13 are replaced with other reference numerals.<br>
Fig. 13 is a side elevational view of a vehicle to indicate the prior art swing arm and this side elevational view shows an arrangement that a power unit 304 is hang down at the rear and upper part of a frame 301 through a bracket 302, suspension plates 303, 303 (only reference numeral 303 at the figure looking person is indicated); leaf springs 306, 306 (only reference numeral 306 at the figure looking person is indicated) are extended from the rear and lower part of the frame 301; rear axles 311, 311 (only reference numeral 311 at the figure looking person is indicated) extending from the power unit 304 in a lateral direction through each of a rubber mount 307 and a ball<br><br>
bearing 308 are rotatably supported at the rear ends of these leaf springs 306, 306; and each of the rear wheels 312 is fixed to these rear axles 311, 311.<br>
The aforesaid prior art discloses a structure in which the power unit 304 is hung at the frame 301, so that it is necessary that a frame side fixing part for fixing the bracket 302 is arranged at the frame 301, and the power unit 304 moved up and down together with the leaf spring 306 is provided with the power unit side fixing part for fixing the suspension plates 303, 303. If this structure does not hung the power unit at the frame 301, it is possible to eliminate any arrangement of the aforesaid side fixing part or the power unit side fixing part and thus it is also possible to increase a degree of freedom in shape, i.e. a degree of freedom in design of the frame 301 and the power unit 304.<br>
In addition, although the leaf spring 306 is a member that can be easily flexed in an upward or downward direction, the frame 301 and the power unit 304 are connected by the bracket 302, suspension plates 303, 303, so that the upward or downward swinging motion of the leaf spring 306 is restricted, an amount of upward or downward stroke of the rear wheels 312 is reduced to cause a riding comfortable feeling at the vehicle to be deteriorated.<br>
Further,  it is also desired to reduce a cost and<br><br>
weight of a suspension for the aforesaid rear wheels 312. (Vehicle Handlebar Fixing Structure)<br>
There have been well known in the art to cause a handlebar to be fixed to the upper end of a stem pipe with a nut (Refer to Japanese Utility Model Publication JP-A-UM-59-33740, for example) and to cause a handlebar to be fixed to the upper end of a steering shaft with a bolt (Refer to Japanese Patent Laid-Open JP-A-62-205888, for example).<br>
Fig. 3 in JP-A-UM-59-33740 will be described in reference to Fig. 14. Reference numerals used in Fig. 14 are replaced with other reference numerals.<br>
Fig. 14 is a sectional view for showing the prior art vehicle handlebar fixing structure and this sectional shows a structure that a stem pipe 303 is supported at the upper part of a head pipe 301 through a bearing 302, the upper end of the stem pipe 303 is formed with a male thread 304 and an axial extending concave groove 306, a collar 311 is fixed to a handlebar pipe 307 through a bracket 308, the collar 311 is fitted to the upper end of the stem pipe 303, a convex part (not shown) arranged at the inner circumferential surface of the collar 311 is inserted into the concave groove 306 of the stem pipe 303 to set position of the collar 311 in respect to the stem pipe 303, a nut 312 is screwed onto a male thread 304 of the stem pipe 303 to fasten the collar 311 and the bracket 308, thereby a<br><br>
handlebar pipe 307 is fixed to the stem pipe 303.<br>
Fig. 3 in JP-A-62-205888 will be described in reference to Fig. 15. Reference numerals used in Fig. 15 are replaced with other reference numerals.<br>
Fig. 15 is a front elevational view (a sectional view in part) for showing the prior art vehicle handlebar fixing structure, an outer circumference of the upper end of a steering shaft 321 is formed with a tapered surface 322, an inner circumference of the lower part of a handlebar stem 324 having the handlebar 323 fixed at the upper part is formed with an inner tapered surface 326, an inner tapered surface 326 is fitted to the aforesaid tapered surface 322 and at the same time a groove 328 formed at the lower end of the handlebar stem 324 is engaged with a pin 327 protruded from the steering shaft 321 so as to set position of the handlebar stem 324 in regard to the steering shaft 321, a bolt 331 is passed into the handlebar 323 and the handlebar stem 324, the bolt 331 is screwed into a threaded hole 332 arranged at the handlebar stem 324 and the handlebar bar 323 is fixed to the steering shaft 321.<br>
In Fig. 14, although the nut 312 and the upper end of the stem pipe 303 are hardly exposed because they are covered by a bracket 308 at their front side, right and left sides, if it becomes possible not to use the bracket 308, for example, but to cover the nut 312 and the upper<br><br>
end of the stem pipe 303 only with the handlebar pipe 307, a simple structure can be attained while its outer appearance is being improved.<br>
In addition, since a concave groove 306 for use in position setting the handlebar pipe 307 can be seen from above the stem pipe 303, its outer appearance characteristic is deteriorated.<br>
In Fig. 15, since the head part of the bolt 331 is exposed above the handlebar bar 323 and an engagement part between the pin 327 and the groove 328 is also exposed at a front part and a rear part of the steering shaft 321, there remains a problem in view of its outer appearance. (Output Shaft Supporting Structure for Vehicle)<br>
There has been well known in the art to cause an output shaft of a transmission to be protruded out of a side surface of the transmission and the output shaft to be cantilevered (Refer to Japanese Patent Publication JP-B-1-47356, for example.).<br>
Fig. 1 in JP-B-1-47356 will be described in reference to Fig. 18. Reference numerals used in Fig. 18 are replaced with other reference numerals.<br>
Fig. 18 is a sectional view for showing the prior art output shaft supporting structure for a vehicle and this sectional shows that an output shaft 302 is rotatably attached to a transmission 301 through a bearing (not<br><br>
shown), this output shaft 302 is protruded toward a side direction, a sprocket 302 is fixed to the protruded portion, a shaft 307 is rotatably arranged at a chain case 306 constituting a swing arm 304, a sprocket 308 is attached to this shaft 307 and a chain 311 is applied between these sprockets 303, 308.<br>
The aforesaid output shaft 302 is arranged in a canti-lever form and if its output is increased, it becomes easily a flexed state, so that it is necessary to increase an outer diameter of the output shaft 307. If its outer diameter is increased, a size of the transmission 301 is increased and at the same time its weight is also increased.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
(Main Object)<br>
One of objects of the present invention is to simplify a bending shape of a vehicle frame, increase its strength and rigidity, and improve an outer appearance of the vehicle.<br>
Aspect 1A of the invention relates to a vehicle in which a front fork is attached to a head pipe in such a way that it enables to be steered, a front wheel is attached to a lower end of the front fork, and one vehicle body frame is extended from the head pipe in a rearward direction,<br><br>
wherein the vehicle body frame has a shape as seen from a side elevational view with an S-shape being laid in a forward or rearward direction of the vehicle, both a foot-straddling part and a foot-mounting part are arranged at a front arcuate part downward-protruded and installed at a front half part of the S-shape of the vehicle body frame, and an engine is arranged in a space below a rear arcuate part upward-protruded and installed at a rear half part of the S-shape of the vehicle body frame.<br>
Making the vehicle body frame into one S-shaped frame enables the vehicle body frame to be smoothly bent in an arcuate form and the number of bent portions to be reduced<br>
In addition, either an entire or a part of one S-shaped frame is exposed outside to enable a slim and stream-like outer appearance to be attained.<br>
In aspect 2A of the invention, the engine is fixed to the swing arm extending substantially from an intermediate part of the S-shaped part of the vehicle body frame in a rearward direction.<br>
Since the engine is positioned at the rear side of the S-shaped frame, it becomes possible to assure an engine arrangement space and an upward or downward motion space for the engine when the swing arm is swung at the space below the rear arcuate part.<br>
In aspect 3A of the invention, the front arcuate part<br><br>
and the rear arcuate part have the same radius of curvature.<br>
Setting a radius of curvature of the front arcuate part and a radius of curvature of the rear arcuate part to the same value to each other enables the front arcuate part and the rear arcuate part to be formed with a same machining tool and further enables machinability of the S-shaped frame to be improved more.<br>
In aspect 4A of the invention, the vehicle body frame is configured from a rectangular pipe.<br>
Since the vehicle body frame is configured from a rectangular pipe, the rectangular pipe having the same outer diameter and the same width and height of a sectional surface as those of the round pipe has a large section modulus as compared with those of the frame configured from a round pipe, for example, so that its strength and rigidity can be improved. In addition, it becomes easily possible to weld a bracket to the flat surface of the rectangular pipe or directly fix the bracket to it with small screws and the like.<br>
In aspect 5A of the invention, a stopper against which the swing arm abuts is provided at a rear end of the S-shape of the vehicle body frame.<br>
It becomes easy to arrange the stopper at the rear end of the S-shaped portion of the vehicle body frame, and<br><br>
it becomes possible to cause the stopper to be abutted against the rear portion of the swing arm.<br>
In accordance with the aspect 1A, making the vehicle body frame with one S-shaped frame enables the frame to be smoothly flexed in an arcuate form and at the same time enables the number of flexed portions to be decreased and enables machinability of the frame to be improved. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce a cost of the vehicle body frame.<br>
In addition, exposing either an entire one S-shaped frame or a part of it outside enables a slim stream-like outer appearance characteristic to be attained, the outer appearance characteristic to be improved and further enables a productivity characteristic to be increased.<br>
The aspect 2A enables an engine arrangement space as well as an upward or downward motion space for the engine when the swing arm is swung to be assured at a space below the rear arcuate part. With such an arrangement as above, the vehicle space can be effectively utilized and a small-sized and compact vehicle can be attained.<br>
The aspect 3A has the same radius of curvature at the front arcuate part and the rear arcuate part to each other enabling machinability of the S-shaped frame to be improved more and a productivity of the S-shaped frame to be increased. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce a cost of<br><br>
the frame.<br>
The aspect 4A has a frame formed by a rectangular pipe, so that its strength and rigidity can be increased more as compared with those of the frame formed with the round pipe. In addition, making the frame with the rectangular pipe facilitates a welding of the bracket to the frame or direct fixing of the component parts to it with small screws and the like, enables a productivity 'of the vehicle to be increased and further a cost of the vehicle to be reduced.<br>
The aspect 5A enables the stopper to be easily arranged at the rear end of the S-shaped portion of the frame and causes the stopper to be abutted against the rear portion of the swing arm, so that the present invention enables a swinging motion of the swing arm to be positively stopped as compared with a system in which the stopper abuts against the front part of the swing arm, for example. (Subsidiary Object 1)<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to increase a degree of freedom in design of a vehicle body frame and a swing arm of a vehicle, • improve a riding comfortable feeling at the vehicle, and reduce a cost and weight of a suspension.<br>
In aspect IB of the invention, a swing arm is attached to a vehicle body frame in such a way that it'<br><br>
enables to be swung in an upward or downward direction, a wheel shaft is attached to an end of the swing arm, and a wheel is attached to the wheel shaft. Further, the swing arm is of a leaf spring, a part near a fixing part thereof to the vehicle body frame is supported from above and below by a supporting member, and the swing arm has a function of a suspension spring.<br>
As compared with an example of the prior art in which the fixing location for the swing arm side and the frame side is necessary when the supporting member and the suspension spring are applied over the swing arm side and the frame side, the present invention does not restrict a shape of the swing arm and the frame because there is not provided any member to be fixed at the end side of the swing arm and the frame side.<br>
In addition, it becomes possible to increase an amount of swing of the swing arm by making the swing arm with the leaf spring, and also it becomes possible to cause the swing arm itself to act as the suspension spring.<br>
In aspect 2B of the invention, the supporting member is a tubular bushing having the inner cylinder, an outer cylinder and a rubber provided between the inner cylinder and the outer cylinder.<br>
A vibration energy transmitted to the vehicle body frame is absorbed with damping force of the rubber in the<br><br>
tubular bushing while a transmittance of shock or vibration from a road surface to the vehicle body frame is being dampened.<br>
In aspect 3B of the invention, an engine driving the wheels is installed on the swing arm.<br>
Fixing of the engine to the swing arm enables a vibration of engine to be dampened with the swing arm and further vibration transmitted to the vehicle body frame to be restricted.<br>
In aspect 4B of the invention, a stopper for stopping an upward swing of the swing arm is provided at a rear end of the vehicle body frame.<br>
Arranging of the stopper at the rear end of the vehicle body frame becomes easy and a simple configuration enables the upward swinging of the swing arm to be stopped.<br>
In accordance with the aspect IB, a shape of the swing arm and frame is not restricted because there is not provided any member to be fixed at the end side of the swing arm and the frame side. Therefore, a degree of freedom in design of the swing arm and the frame can be increased.<br>
In addition, making the swing arm with a leaf spring enables an amount of swing of the swing arm to be increased, an upward or downward stroke of the wheels to be increased and a riding comfortable feeling to be improved.<br><br>
Further, making the swing arm with a leaf spring enables the swing arm itself to act also as a suspension spring and any special suspension spring not to be arranged, so that a structure of the suspension for supporting the wheels can be simplified and a low cost and light weight of the vehicle can be attained.<br>
The aspect 2B enables vibration energy transmitted to the vehicle body frame to be absorbed with a damping force of the rubber in the tubular bushing while transmittance of either shock or vibration from a road surface to the vehicle frame is being dampened with an elastic force of the leaf spring.<br>
The aspect 3B enables a vibration of engine to be dampened by the swing arm and vibration transmitted to the vehicle body frame to be restricted because the engine is fixed to the swing arm.<br>
The aspect 4B enables the stopper to be easily arranged at the vehicle body frame because the rear end of the vehicle body frame is provided with a stopper and at the same time enables an upward swinging of the swing arm to be stopped with a simple configuration and enables its cost to be restricted. (Subsidiary Objection 2)<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to improve an outer appearance of a handlebar fixing part and<br><br>
further make the handlebar fixing part a simple structure by setting the fastening members such as a bolt or a nut and the like for use in fixing the handlebar to the steering stem and making the position setting part for position setting the handlebar to the steering stem in a vehicle handlebar fixing structure hardly exposed to the external part.<br>
In aspect 1C of the invention, a steering stem is rotatably attached to a head pipe, the front fork is attached to a lower end of the steering stem in such a way that it enables to be steered/- the front wheel is attached to the lower end of the front fork, and a handle is fixed to an upper end of the steering stem. Further, a female thread and a position setting part are provided at the upper end of the steering stem, the handle includes a pair of right and left handlebars connected by a connector member, and the handle is fixed to the upper end of the steering stem by setting a position of the connector member at the position setting part and by screwing a piece of bolt, which passes through the connector member from between the right and left handlebars, into the female thread.<br>
The handle includes a pair of right and left handlebars, and a piece of bolt passed from between the right and left handlebars and through the connector member<br><br>
is screwed into the female thread to cover the head part of the bolt with a pair of right and left handlebars and make them hardly seen and the handle fixing part has a simple structure.<br>
In addition, when the position of the connector member is set by the position setting part at the upper end of the steering stem, it becomes possible to prevent the position setting part from being exposed to the external part.<br>
In aspect 2C of the invention, the position setting part is either a concave part or a convex part which fits to the connector member.<br>
Even if the handlebar fixing structure is simple, the steering stem and the connector member are fitted to each other through the concave part and the convex part to improve a connecting strength.<br>
In accordance with the aspect 1C, the handle is constituted by a pair of right and left handlebars and a piece of bolt passed from between the right and left handlebars and through the connector member is screwed into the female thread, so that the head part of the bolt is covered by a pair of right and left handlebars and hardly seen and even if there is not provided any cover covering the head part of the bolt in particular, its outer appearance characteristic can be improved, more, a simple<br><br>
structure of the handlebar fixing part can be attained and its cost can be restricted.<br>
Further, when the connector member is set in its position by the position setting part at the upper end of the steering stem, it is possible to prevent the position setting part from being exposed out of the vehicle and to improve more the outer appearance characteristic.<br>
In accordance with the aspect 2C, the position setting part is either the concave part or the convex part fitted to the connector member, so that even if the handlebar fixing structure is simple, its connecting strength can be improved by fitting the steering stem to the connector member through the concave part and the convex part. (Subsidiary Objection 3)<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to enable the output shaft supporting structure for a vehicle to be adapted for a large output and further to make a small-sized and light weight driving source by reducing an outer diameter of the output shaft.<br>
In Aspect ID of the invention, an output shaft is arranged at one end of a crank shaft of the engine through a clutch, and a chain is applied between a drive sprocket arranged at the output shaft and a driven sprocket arranged at the wheel shaft of the wheels to drive the wheels.<br><br>
Further, the output shaft is supported at both sides of the drive sprocket through bearings.<br>
Even if the output shaft is short in its length, the output shaft is supported at both sides of the drive sprocket, so that it becomes possible to rigidly support the output shaft.<br>
In aspect 2D of the invention, an intermediate shaft is arranged below the output shaft, a first central sprocket and a second central sprocket are attached to the intermediate shaft, the chain includes a first chain and a second chain separate from the first chain, the first chain is applied over the drive sprocket and the first central sprocket, and a second chain is applied over the second central sprocket and the driven sprocket.<br>
Arrangement of the intermediate shaft below the output shaft enables either the position of the intermediate shaft or the number of teeth of the first central sprocket and the second central sprocket attached to the intermediate shaft.<br>
In aspect 3D of the invention, the crank shaft and the output shaft are arranged on the same axis.<br>
Arrangement of the crank shaft and the output shaft on the same axis enables the clutch to be easily installed between these members.<br>
In  aspect  4D  of  the  invention,  the  engine  is<br><br>
installed on a swing arm supporting the wheel shaft at one end, and the intermediate shaft is arranged near the swing arm.<br>
Arrangement of the intermediate shaft at the swing arm nearer than the output shaft enables a relative inclination between the second central sprocket at the intermediate shaft and the driven sprocket at the wheel shaft to be reduced even if the swing arm is twisted during a running of the vehicle, for example.<br>
In accordance with the aspect ID, the output shaft can be rigidly supported because the output shaft is supported at both sides of the drive sprocket. Accordingly, it can accommodate for a large output by this output shaft supporting structure and in addition, when the outputs are the same to each other, the present invention enables an outer diameter of the output shaft to be made lower as compared with that of the canti-levered output shaft and also the present invention enables a small-sized and light weight engine acting as a driving source to be attained.<br>
In accordance with the aspect 2D, it is possible to increase a degree of freedom of a power transmittance path ranging from the output shaft to the wheel shaft by changing a position of the intermediate shaft because the intermediate shaft is arranged below the output shaft. In<br><br>
addition, it is also possible to increase a degree of freedom of transmission ratio between the output shaft and the wheel shaft by changing the number of teeth of the first central sprocket and the second central sprocket.<br>
In accordance with the aspect 3D, it is possible to make an easy placement of a clutch between the crank shaft and the output shaft because these shafts are arranged on the same axis and the present invention does not need any plurality of gears or sprockets for use in connecting between the crank shaft and the output shaft as found in a state in which the crank shaft and the output shaft are not arranged on the same axis, for example, so that a cost for these members can be restricted.<br>
In accordance with the aspect 4D, it is possible to reduce a relative inclination between the second central sprocket at the intermediate shaft and the driven sprocket at the wheel shaft and to perform an efficient power transmission even if the swing arm is twisted during running of the vehicle, for example, because the intermediate shaft is arranged nearer at the swing arm than the output shaft.<br>

Fig.  9 is a sectional view for showing a vehicle<br><br>
engine in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The engine 27 comprises an engine main body 261 and the engine main body 261 comprises a cylinder head integral type cylinder block 262 and a crank case 27a connected to the lower end surface of the cylinder block 262.<br>
The cylinder block 262 is provided with, at its center part, a single cylinder 266 for storing a piston 264.<br>
The crank case 27a is a member in which a pair of upper and lower case half bodies 263a, 263b is connected by plural bolts, and a crank shaft 121 is rotatably attached to a connected part between these case half bodies 263a, 263b through a plane bearing 267 and a ball bearing 268. Further, reference numeral 272 denotes a connecting rod for connecting a piston 264 to the crank shaft 121, and reference numeral 273 denotes a fuel tank fixed to the lower part of the crank case 27a.<br>
In addition, the inside part of the crank case 27a is provided with a crank chamber 275 arranged at the central part of it, an oil reservoir chamber 276 and a valve chamber 277 arranged at the side part of the crank chamber 275, respectively.<br>
The crank chamber 275 corresponds to a location where a crank part 271a of the crank shaft 121 is arranged.<br>
The oil reservoir chamber 276 is a location where a<br><br>
specified amount of lubricant oil is stored and stores an oil slinger 278 fixed to the crank shaft 121 so as to agitate the lubricant oil and disperse it (that is, so as to generate oil mist).<br>
The oil slinger 278 comprises a plurality of long arm vanes 278a and a plurality of short arm vanes 278b, and these long arm vanes 278a and short arm vanes 278b are flexed to each other in a direction opposite to an axial direction of the crank shaft 121.<br>
In this way, arrangement of the oil reservoir chamber 276 provided with the oil slinger 278 within the crank case 27a enables lubricant oil in the oil reservoir chamber 276 to be agitated in whatever operating attitude the engine 27 may take through rotation of the oil slinger 278 and then always enables oil mist to be generated.<br>
A valve chamber 277 passes through one side of the cylinder block 262 and extends up to its head part and the upper part of the valve chamber 277 is provided with a valve device 281 opening or closing an intake valve and an exhaust valve. Further, reference numeral 282 denotes a head cover covering the upper part of the cylinder block 262; and reference numerals 283, 284 denote a rocker shaft and a rocker arm constituting the valve device 281.<br>
The aforesaid crank chamber 275 and the oil reservoir chamber 276 are communicated with each other through a<br><br>
through-pass hole 271b opened at the crank shaft 121.<br>
Since the through-pass hole 271b is made such that an opening to the oil reservoir chamber 276 is arranged at the central part of the oil reservoir chamber 276, a storage amount of lubricant oil in the oil reservoir chamber 276 is set in such a way that the aforesaid opening is not sunk in whatever inclination state or inverted state the engine 27 may take.<br>
The crank case 27a comprises a valve chamber 286 communicated with the valve chamber 277 at its lower part, and an oil returning chamber 287 enclosing the valve chamber 286.<br>
The valve chamber 286 corresponds to a location where it is communicated with the bottom part of the crank chamber 275 through a valve hole 288 and one-way valve 291 for opening or closing the valve hole 288.<br>
The one-way valve 291 is a member for closing the valve hole 288 at the time of reducing pressure and opening the valve hole 288 at the time of increasing pressure in response to a pressure pulsation at the crank chamber 275.<br>
The oil returning chamber 50 corresponds to a location where it is communicated with the oil reservoir chamber 276 through a through-pass hole 292 and in turn it is also communicated with the valve chamber 277 through an orifice not shown.<br><br>
Reference numeral 293 in this figure denotes a recoil starter and reference numeral 294 denotes an ignition coil.<br>
Action of the engine 27 described above will be explained as follows.<br>
During operation of the engine 21, when the oil slinger 278 agitates lubricant oil to generate oil mist at the oil reservoir chamber 276 through rotation of the crank shaft 121, the oil mist is absorbed into the crank chamber 275 through the through-pass hole 271b when a pressure in the crank chamber 275 is reduced under an ascending motion of a piston 264 so as to lubricate around the crank part 271a and the piston 264.<br>
In addition, when a pressure in the crank chamber 275 is increased due to a descending motion of the piston 264, the aforesaid oil mist is supplied from the valve hole 288 to the valve chamber 286 and the valve chamber 277 together with blow-by gas generated at the crank chamber 275 by opening the one-way valve 291, the oil mist and the blow-by gas are separated from each other at the valve chamber 277, the oil mist lubricates each of the members of the valve device 281 and the blow-by gas is discharged to an air cleaner.<br>
Further, the oil mist sent to the valve chamber 277 returns back to the oil reservoir chamber 276, the lubricant oil liquefied at the valve chamber 277 returns<br><br>
back to the oil return chamber 287 through an orifice not shown. Then, returning of the oil mist and the liquefied lubricant oil in such a way as described above is carried out without any trouble in whatever inclination the engine 27 may take. In addition, even if the engine vibrates during running operation due to corrugations at a road, returning of the oil mist and the lubricant oil can be carried out without any trouble.<br>
Action when the swing arm 22 described above is swung will be explained as follows. Fig. 10 is a first action figure indicating an action when a vehicle swing arm in accordance with the present invention is swung.<br>
When the swing arm 22 is swung upwardly in respect to the main frame 21 to increase an amount of swing, an upward motion of the swing arm 22 is stopped with a second stopper 77 arranged at the rear end of the main frame 21 so as to prevent the swing arm 22 from being excessively swung.<br>
Fig. 11 is a second action figure indicating an action when the vehicle swing arm in accordance with the present invention is swung and an action of the bushing and stopper will be explained as follows.<br>
When the swing arm 22 is swung upwardly, an outer cylinder 82 of the second bushing 68 is pushed up by the swing arm 22 and moves upwardly, so that the rubber 83 of the second bushing 68 is deformed to generate both an<br><br>
elastic force and a damping force. Then, when an upward swinging amount of the swing arm 22 is large, the outer cylinder 82 is moved substantially in an upward direction against the elastic force of the rubber 83, and the outer cylinder 82 abuts against a stopper main body 76b of the first stopper 76. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent an excessive deformation of the second bushing 68, more particularly the rubber 83 by the first stopper 76, so that the rubber 83 is hardly flexed and a life of the second bushing 68 can be extended. (Vehicle Frame)<br>
As already been described in reference to Figs. 1 and 2, at first, the present invention relates to the vehicle 10 in which the front fork 14 is attached to the head pipe 12 in such a way that it can be steered, the front wheel 16 is attached to the lower end of the front fork 14, and the main frame 21 acting as one frame is extended from the head pipe 12 in a rearward direction characterized in that the main frame 21 is formed into a shape in which the S-shape is laid in a forward or rearward direction of the vehicle as seen from its side elevational view, the downward protruded front arcuate part 36 arranged at the front half part of the S-shape is provided with a bottom part 36a acting as a foot-straddling part and with floor supporting portions 44, 45 acting as feet-mounting portions, and then<br><br>
the engine 27 is arranged in a space below the upward protruded rear arcuate part 38 set at the S-shaped rear half part.<br>
Making the main frame 21 with one S-shaped frame causes the main frame 21 to be smoothly flexed into an arcuate shoe and at the same time enables its bending location to be reduced and further machinability of the main frame 21 to be improved. Accordingly, a cost of the main frame 21 can be reduced.<br>
In addition, exposing either an entire or a part of one S-shaped frame outside enables a slim and stream-line type outer appearance to be attained, a preferable impression to be given to a viewer and its outer appearance to be improved. Accordingly, it is possible to increase a product characteristic of the vehicle 10.<br>
Further, the S-shaped front arcuate part 36 is utilized to form the bottom part 36a acting as a foot straddling part and floor supporting parts acting as feet-mounting parts and to form an engine installing space through utilization of space below the S-shaped rear arcuate part 38, so that it is possible to attain the simple vehicle 10 capable of utilizing effectively the lower space.<br>
Secondly, the present invention is characterized in that the engine 27 is attached to the swing arm 22<br><br>
extending from the substantial intermediate part of the S-shape part of the main frame 21 in a rearward direction.<br>
It is possible to assure the engine installing space as well as the upward or downward motion space for the engine 27 when the swing arm 22 is swung at a space below the rear arcuate part 38. With such an arrangement as above, it is possible to effectively utilize a space of the vehicle 10 and make the vehicle 10 small-sized and compact.<br>
Thirdly, the present invention is characterized in that the front arcuate part 36 and the rear arcuate part 38 have the same radius of curvature.<br>
Setting the same radius of curvature of the front arcuate part 36 and the rear arcuate part 38 enables machinability of the S-shaped main frame 21 to be improved more and a productivity of the S-shaped main frame 21 to be increased. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce a cost of the main frame 21.<br>
Fourthly, the present invention is characterized in that the main frame 21 is composed of a rectangular pipe.<br>
Since the main frame 21 is composed of the rectangular pipe, its strength and rigidity can be improved more as compared with those of the frame composed of a round pipe, for example. In addition, making the main frame 21 with the rectangular pipe facilitates welding of a bracket to the main frame 21 or fixing some parts directly<br><br>
to the main frame with small screws and the like, enables productivity of the vehicle 10 to be increased and further enables a cost of the vehicle 10 to be reduced.<br>
Fifthly, the present invention is characterized in that the rear end of the S-shaped portion of the main frame 21 is provided with the second stopper 77 to which the swing arm 22 abuts.<br>
Since the rear end of the S-shaped part of the main frame 21 is applied, the second stopper 77 can be easily arranged and at the same time the second stopper 77 is abutted against the rear portion of the swing arm 22, so that the present invention enables a swinging action of the swing arm 22 to be positively stopped as compared with that of abutment of the stopper against the front part of the swing arm, for example.<br>
In the above embodiment, although the main frame 21 is constituted by the front linear part 35, front arcuate part 36, central linear part 37 and rear arcuate part 38 as shown in Fig. 1, the present invention is not limited to this constitution, but it may be constituted only by the front linear part 35 and the rear arcuate part 38<br>

has a function of the suspension spring.<br>
As compared with the case in which when the supporting member and the suspension spring are applied over the swing arm side and the frame side as found in the prior art, for example, their fixing locations are required for the swing arm and the frame, the present invention shows that a shape of the swing arm 22 and a shape of the vehicle body frame 11 are not restricted because no members to be attached are present at the end of the swing arm 22 and the vehicle body frame 11, so that a degree of freedom in design for the swing arm 22 and the vehicle body frame<br>
11	can be increased.<br><br>
In addition, the swing arm 22 is of a leaf spring to enable a swinging amount of the swing arm 22 to be increased, an upward or downward stroke of the rear wheels 24, 26 to be increased and further a riding comfortable feeling at the vehicle 10 to be improved.<br>
Further, making the swing arm 22 with a leaf spring enables the swing arm 22 itself to act as a suspension spring and no special suspension spring is required, so that it is possible to make a simple suspension for supporting the rear wheels 24, 26 as well as to attain both a low cost and a light weight of the vehicle 10.<br>
Secondly, the present invention is characterized in that the supporting member is comprised of the second bushing 68 acting as a tubular bushing composed of the inner cylinder 81, outer cylinder 82 and rubber 83 present between these inner cylinder 81 and outer cylinder 82, the inner cylinder 85 and the third bushing 69 acting as a tubular bushing composed of rubber 86 vulcanized and adhered to the inner cylinder 85.<br>
It is possible to absorb vibration energy transmitted to the vehicle body frame 11 with damping force of the rubbers 83, 86 of the second bushing 68 and the third bushing 69 while a transmission of either a shock or a vibration from a road surface to the vehicle body frame 11 is being loosened.<br><br>
Thirdly, the present invention is characterized in that the engine 27 for use in driving the rear wheels 24, 26 is fixed to the swing arm 22.<br>
It is possible to dampen a vibration of the engine with the swing arm 22 because the engine 27 is fixed to the swing arm 22 and further it is possible to restrict the vibration transmitted to the vehicle body frame 11.<br>
Fourthly, the present invention is characterized in that the rear end of the vehicle body frame 11 is provided with the second stopper 77 acting as a stopper for stopping an upward swinging motion of the swing arm 22.<br>
Arrangement of the second stopper 77 at the rear end of the vehicle body frame 11 enables the second stopper 77 to be easily installed at the vehicle body frame 11, the upward swinging of the swing arm 22 to be terminated by a single configuration and a cost of the second stopper 77 to be restricted.<br>
Further, it is preferable that the swing arm composed of a leaf spring in accordance with the present invention is made of spring steel, resin and FRP (Fiber Reinforced Plastic) and the like.<br>
The vehicle swing arm of the embodiment is preferable for a three-wheeled vehicle and a four-wheeled vehicle. (Vehicle Handlebar Fixing Structure)<br>

The handle 18 is constituted by a pair of right and left handlebars 177, 178 and at the same time a piece of handle fixing bolt 182 passed from between the right and left handlebars 177, 178 through the handle supporting<br><br>
plate 176 is screwed into the female thread 203, so that the head part 182a of the handle fixing bolt 182 is covered by a pair of right and left handlebars 177, 178 and is hardly seen and even if there is not provided a cover covering the head part 182a of the handle fixing bolt 182, in particular, its outer appearance characteristic can be improved more and further the handlebar fixing part can have a simple structure and its cost can be restricted.<br>
Further, when the spacer 164 at the handle supporting plate 176 is set in its position with the convex parts 207, 208 at the upper end of the steering stem 13, the convex parts 207, 208 are not exposed out and the outer appearance characteristic of the handlebar fixing part can be improved more.<br>
Secondly, the present invention is characterized in that the position setting part is set as either the concave parts or convex parts 207, 208 to be fitted to the handle supporting plate 176.<br>
Since the position setting part is set as the spacer 174 at the handle supporting plate 176, more particularly the convex parts 207, 208 fitted to the concave parts 205, 206, fitting of the steering stem 13 to the spacer 174 at the handle supporting plate 176 through concave parts or convex parts enables a connecting strength to be increased even though a simple handlebar fixing structure is applied.<br><br>
As already been illustrated in Figs. 8A and 8B, although the convex parts 207, 208 are arranged at the steering stem 13 (refer to Fig. 6), i.e. at the nut member 183 and the concave parts 205, 206 are arranged at the spacer 174, the present invention is not limited to this arrangement and the concave part may be arranged at the nut member 183 and the convex part may be set at the spacer 174.<br>
The  vehicle  handlebar  fixing  structure  of  the embodiment is preferable for a three-wheeled vehicle or a four-wheeled vehicle. (Output Shaft Supporting Structure for Vehicle)<br>
Fig. 16 is a side elevational view for showing another preferred embodiment of a power transmission mechanism of a vehicle in accordance with the present invention to indicate a structure for transmitting a power from the engine 27 (refer to Fig. 2) to the rear wheels 24, 26. The same constitution as that of the preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 2 is denoted by the same reference numerals and its detailed description will be eliminated.<br>
A power transmission mechanism 221 comprises a drive sprocket 222 fixed to an output shaft 132 of the engine 27, an intermediate shaft 223 arranged below the output shaft 132,  a first central sprocket 224 and a second central sprocket 226 fixed to the intermediate shaft 223, a driven<br><br>
sprocket 227 fixed to a wheel shaft 23 of the rear wheels 24, 26, a first chain 228 applied between the drive sprocket 222 and the first central sprocket 224, and a second chain 231 applied between the second central sprocket 226 and the driven sprocket 227.<br>
Fig. 17 is a sectional view taken along line 17-17 of Fig. 16 and this figure shows that a bearing 236 is fixed to the case 27a of the engine 27 with small screws 235 ...; a shaft end receiving part 238 is fixed to the bearing 236 with bolts 237 ... ; the output shaft 132 is rotatably attached to these bearing 236 and the shaft end receiving part 238 through bearings 241, 242 and at the same time an intermediate shaft 223 is rotatably attached to the bearing 236 and the shaft end receiving part 238 through bearings 243, 244; and a drive sprocket 222 is connected in spline to the output shaft 132 while being position set with collars 246, 247. Further, reference numeral 223a denotes a male spline formed at the intermediate shaft 223 for connecting in spline the first central sprocket 224 and the second central sprocket 226.<br>
Returning to Fig. 16, arrangement of the intermediate shaft 223 at the power transmission mechanism 221 enables the intermediate shaft 223 to approach to or coincide with the swing arm 22 in an upward or downward direction, for example, even when the vehicle body frame 11 (refer to Fig.<br><br>
1)  oscillates  in  a  lateral  direction  during  turning operation of the vehicle and the swing arm 22 is twisted, it is possible to reduce a relative inclination between the second central sprocket 226 and the driven sprocket 227 and to perform an efficient power transmission.<br>
As already been described in reference to the aforesaid Figs. 2 and 5, the present invention is the vehicle 10 (refer to Fig. 1) in which at first the output shaft 132 is arranged at one end of the crank shaft (the crank shaft) 121 of the engine 27 through a centrifugal clutch 127 acting as a clutch, the chain 28 is applied over the drive sprocket 72 arranged at the output shaft 132 and the wheel shaft 23 for the rear wheels 24, 26 acting as wheels so as to drive the rear wheels 24, 26 characterized in that the output shaft 132 is supported at both sides of the drive sprocket 72 through bearings (bearings) 131, 135.<br>
Even if the output shaft 132 is short in its length, the output shaft 132 is supported at both sides of the drive sprocket 72, so that the output shaft 132 can be rigidly supported. Accordingly, this output shaft supporting structure can accommodate for a large output and when the outputs are similar to each other, it is possible in the present invention to reduce more an outer diameter of the output shaft 132 as compared with a cantilevered output shaft and to make a small-sized and light weight<br><br>
formation of the engine 27 acting as a driving source.<br>
In addition, since the shaft end receiving part 134 for supporting the end of the output shaft 132 covers an outside part of the drive sprocket 72, the drive sprocket<br>
&gt;	72 is hardly seen from the side part of the vehicle to<br>
enable an outer appearance characteristic of the vehicle 10<br>
to be improved and at the same time it can be functioned as<br>
a cover for protecting the drive sprocket 72.<br>
As already been described in reference to Figs. 16<br>
	and 17, secondly, the present invention is characterized in<br>
that the intermediate shaft 223 is arranged below the<br>
output shaft 132, the first central sprocket 224 and the<br>
second  central  sprocket  226  are  attached  to  the<br>
intermediate shaft 223, a chain is constituted by the first<br>
chain 228 and a second chain 231 separate from the first<br>
chain 228, the first chain 228 is applied over the drive<br>
sprocket 222 and the first central sprocket, and the second<br>
chain 231 is applied over the second central sprocket 226<br>
and the driven sprocket 227.<br>
Since the intermediate shaft 223 is arranged near the output shaft 132, changing the position of the intermediate shaft 223 enables a degree of freedom of a power transmission path ranging from the output shaft 132 to the wheel shaft 23 to be increased. In addition, the number of teeth of the first central sprocket 224 and the second<br><br>
central sprocket 226 is changed to enable a degree of freedom of a transmission ratio between the output shaft 132 and the wheel shaft 23 to be increased.<br>
Thirdly, as already been described in reference to Fig. 5, the present invention is characterized in that the crank shaft 121 and the output shaft 132 are arranged on the same axis.<br>
Since the crank shaft 121 and the output shaft 132 are arranged on the same axis, the centrifugal clutch 127 can be easily installed between these members, for example, the present invention does not require any plural number of gears or sprocket for use in connecting the crank shaft to the output shaft as found in such a state as one in which the crank shaft and the output shaft are not arranged on the same axis and so its cost can be restricted.<br>
Fourthly, as already been described in Figs. 2 and 16, the present invention is characterized in that the engine 27 is arranged on the swing arm 22 supporting the wheel shaft 23 at one end and the intermediate shaft 223 is arranged nearer the swing arm 22 than the output shaft 132.<br>
Since the intermediate shaft 223 is arranged nearer the swing arm 22 than the output shaft 23, it is possible to reduce a relative inclination between the second central sprocket 226 at the intermediate shaft 223 and the driven sprocket 227 at the wheel shaft 23 even if the swing arm 22<br><br>
is twisted during running of the vehicle, so that the power transmission can be efficiently carried out.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 5, although the bearing part 128 supporting the output shaft 132 and the shaft receiving part 134 are separately made in the preferred embodiment, they are not restricted to this form, but they may be integrally assembled.<br>
The vehicle output shaft supporting structure of the embodiment is preferable for the engine and an output shaft of a transmission machine installed in a motorcycle, a three-wheeled vehicle or a four-wheeled vehicle.<br><br><br>
