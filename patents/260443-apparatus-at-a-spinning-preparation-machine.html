ENGLISH TRANSLATION VARIFICATION<br>
CERTIFICATE u/r. 20(3)(b)<br>
I, DARSHANA, an authorized agent for the applicant, RIETER INGOLSTADT GMBH, GERMANY do hereby verify that the content of English translation of ertified claiming German Priority No. 10 2007 011 357.0 dated 07.03.2007 thereof is correct and complete.<br>
ASEAN SAARC PATENT &amp; TRADE MARK SERVICES<br>
AGENT   FOR RIETER INGOLSTADT GMBH<br><br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for arrangement after the outlet-side drawing rollers of a drafting system.<br>
On spinning preparation machines with a drafting system, it is known to provide a compressing device following the drawing rollers, where said compressing device combines the fiber material that is spread out in the drafting system. With a drawing frame, the fiber material is present as a web in the drafting system, which after subsequent compression into a fiber sliver is transported by a calendar roller pair into a rotating sliver duct, which deposits the fiber sliver loop-like in a sliver can.<br>
For example, from the drawframe RSB-D 40 from Rieter Ingolstadt Spinnereimaschi-nenbau AG it is known to use a web nozzle with a web guide nozzle for the compression, downstream of which is arranged a sliver funnel with injector channels. The sliver exiting from the sliver funnel is transported by the calendar rollers to a separate injector, which threads the sliver into the sliver duct.<br>
This known arrangement has proven to be very effective. However, with a more compact construction of the drafting system, the components lie more closely together, which affects the handling and the accessibility of the individual components in the area downstream of the drafting system.<br>
It is the objective of the present invention to make an apparatus available between a drafting system and a sliver duct that eases the handling and accessibility.<br>
This objective is solved with an apparatus of the initially named type by the features of claim 1.<br>
The advantages of the invention are to be seen in particular in that by means of the carrier according to the invention, a compact assembly is obtained, in which the most important web guide elements and sliver guide elements are integrated, or on which they are provided. Thus, the result is an extremely simple handling. In addi-<br>
2<br><br>
tion, the carrier has the advantage that the number of individual components can be significantly reduced. Therefore, the user is not forced to handle individual parts in the small installation space, but rather, can remove the carrier with the components arranged upon it, especially the compressing device and the threading-in device, from its operating position, and reinsert it as a whole. For this, merely the calendar roller facing away from the drafting system must be pivoted away, or removed in another manner, in order then to release and remove the carrier along with the compressing device and the threading-in device from the operation position, preferably with a single maneuver.<br>
The carrier is preferably formed as a circumferential frame. The compressing device is then arranged on an upper part of the frame, and the threading-in device is arranged on a lower part of the frame. The two frame parts are preferably connected by lateral struts. According to an alternative, a strut is present only on one side. These implementations ease the handling and facilitate the compactness of the construction.<br>
A closed formation of the frame facilitates its rigidity and thus the precise mounting in its operating position.<br>
Preferably, the carrier can be brought into its operating position between the drafting system and the sliver duct, and can be removed again from this position, by an essentially linear movement. For this, the carrier is preferably held at both of its lateral struts and guided from the front into its operating position. Circuitous movements in multiple spatial directions are unnecessary. Here, the carrier can be grasped, e.g., with both hands, left and right of the calendar rollers, and brought into position. Alternately, the carrier can also be positioned with only one hand, which further facilitates a simplified handling.<br>
It is especially preferable that the compressing device and/or the threading-in device, or parts of the above named elements, are formed as one piece on the carrier,<br>
3<br><br>
because otherwise mechanical twisting, unaligned connections, or fiber accumulations can result at the connection sites.<br>
It is especially preferable that the compressing device and the threading-in device are formed and arranged such that the calendar rollers are located between them. They provide for the transport of the fiber band, formed in the compressing device, into the downstream sliver duct, wherein the threading-in device is provided directly after the calendar rollers.<br>
If the compressing device projects from the one side and the threading-in device projects from the other side, respectively, into the gap formed by the calendar rollers, there results a nearly closed web guide and sliver guide from the compressing device, or even from the output cylinder of the drafting system, up to the sliver duct of the turn-table. The lateral evasion of the fiber sliver during the feed-in procedure in the direction of nip line of the two calendar rollers is prevented by the compressing device projecting from above into the calendar roller gap. In addition, the extremely short sliver path from the drafting system into the sliver duct, as well as the guidance, which is present everywhere, of the fiber sliver over the named course provides a very low susceptibility to trouble because the fiber sliver does not have an opportunity to exit from an open site.<br>
Preferably, the compressing device includes a web nozzle, which can be built similar to known web nozzles for the collection of the drafted fiber materials present in web form. In such an embodiment, the web nozzle preferably includes a pivotable wall plate, which is held on the carrier by magnets and, in the event of a congestion in the web nozzle, is pivoted against the magnetic force away from the carrier. In doing so, the pivoted wall plate can divert the fiber web that is dammed, but initially is still being fed, in a target way out of the calendar area. In addition, a shutoff signal can be given to the machine, preferably by means of an electronic contact. By a pivoting away from the drafting system and forward, a service person has easy access to the web nozzle, in the event that a blockage with fiber material should occur here.<br>
4<br><br>
Preferably, the carrier can be grasped with the hands, or with a hand, at the pivo-table wall plate such that - possibly in addition to the grasping at the above named lateral carrier struts - here too, the overall handling is made easier.<br>
In addition, it has proven to be advantageous that the carrier is held at a drafting system mounting by magnets. On the one hand, the carrier can be removed in a simple manner by a corresponding exertion of force, and on the other hand it is held securely in its operating position. In the event that laps form at the upper outlet roller or at the calendar, or a disruption occurs in the area of the web nozzle, it is possible, by means of this construction, that the undesirably accumulated fiber material pushes the carrier away, out of its operation position. Through this, an electrical contact (or the breaking of an electrical contact) can then bring about an automatic shutdown of the spinning preparation machine. Alternately, or additionally, a sensor can be used here, which monitors the operating position of the carrier and advantageously, also of the pivotable wall plate located on it.<br>
According to a further development of the invention, the carrier is held in a cylindrical bearing, respectively, at both sides of the carrier by means of magnets. The magnets on one side are preferably formed such that they can be adjusted, so that the other side of the carrier can tightly abut the cylindrical bearing there. In this way, a seal-less air supply can be guaranteed (see below).<br>
A further constructive simplification results when a scraper for one of the calendar rollers is arranged on the compressing device.<br>
Preferably, the compressing device has at least one injector bore, which is connected with a first air supply line for compressed air. Advantageously, there are at least two injector bores present, in order to lend the fiber web sufficient thrust for the transport through the constriction of the compressing device.<br>
5<br><br>
The injector bore(s) are preferably formed in an insert, which can be inserted into the web nozzle. In this implementation, the compressing device is essentially formed by the web nozzle and the web nozzle insert. A sliver funnel located between the web nozzle insert and the calendar rollers, frequently present in known machines, can be omitted in this embodiment.<br>
Advantageously, the threading-in device also has at least one injector bore, which is connected with a second air supply line for compressed air. Here too, two injector bores are preferable in order to create the desired spin in the sliver before depositing in the spinning can.<br>
It is particularly preferable that the first air supply line and/or the second air supply line run in the carrier, because thereby, no hoses that are space intensive and disruptive during handling, are necessary in the service space. Furthermore, with the otherwise present hoses, during a sliver congestion at the web nozzle or during similar disruptions, undesired fiber material can easily deposit on the hoses, which further complicates the handling. Also, during insertion of parts into the operating position, attention would have to be paid to the cable routing.<br>
It is especially preferable that the first and the second air supply line are fed from a common supply feed provided at the carrier, because then, only one individual external air supply to the carrier must be present. Advantageously here, no seal is used at the compressed air transfer site to the supply feed. Instead, the carrier preferably tightly abuts to the corresponding compressed air transfer site, for example, using the above named cylindrical bearings. Preferably, the first and the second air supply lines are formed by bores in the carrier, wherein furthermore, preferably a distributing main in the carrier leads from the supply feed to a junction, from which the first and the second branch off.<br>
Preferably, the quantity of the supplied compressed air in both air supply lines can be adjusted independently of each other, if necessary, even up to closing or inter-<br>
6<br><br>
rupting one of the two air supply lines. For this, a manual adjustment capability or an electrically controlled or regulated adjustment can be provided.<br>
The described air supply in a solid component - especially implemented as bores, preferably in the named carrier - to the injector bores of the compressing device and/or threading-in device can also be regarded as a separate aspect of the invention. Space consuming, failure prone hose connections to the injector bores can be omitted. The space conditions and the accessibility for grasping are optimized by this, and the manageability is significantly increased. With this type of air supply line(s), an implementation of the carrier with arrangement of the compressing device as well as the threading-in device is not necessary, but of course, possible. Also, the other described implementation possibilities (supply feed, distributing main, air supply lines branching off from the distributing main, adjustability of the air supply, etc) are included in this separate aspect of the invention as advantageous further developments - independent of whether a carrier is present at all, or whether the carrier is formed according to the first aspect of the invention. It can also be possible that a mounting or a separate carrier is provided in each case for the compressing device as well as for the threading-in device. Here, then, the air supply lines preferably run in the respective mounting.<br>
The invention also relates to a spinning preparation machine, especially a carder, drawframe, or a combing machine with a drafting system, wherein the spinning preparation machine has an apparatus of the previously described implementation.<br>
The drafting system of the spinning preparation machine according to the invention is preferably arranged inclined, wherein the fiber sliver(s), spread out to a fiber web, pass through the drafting system slanting downwards, as seen in the direction of movement. Here, the drafting system is preferably operated from the front, if necessary using a platform for an increase in height. With such an embodiment, the user has access to the carrier with both hands, which grasp past the loading arm on both<br>
7<br><br>
the left and right side. The calendar roller facing the loading arm and the upper rollers are usually suspended from the loading arm.<br>
With such an arrangement, the drafting system is inclined relative to the horizontal, preferably with an slope between 40° and 75°relative to the horizontal.<br>
Due to the slope of the drafting system, an upper redirection roller can be omitted, such that the drafting system is preferably formed as a 3 over 3 drafting system, thus, having a preliminary drawing region and a main drawing region, without a downstream upper redirection roller.<br>
Advantageous further developments of the invention are characterized by the features of the dependent claims. In the scope of the claims, arbitrary combinations of the features mentioned in the claims as well as the features mentioned in the description including the following description of the Figures, are possible.<br>
In the following, an exemplary embodiment of the invention is described in detail using the Figures, wherein the same reference numbers are used for the same functional elements. They show:<br>

In Figures 1 and 2, the essential parts of a drawframe as an example of a spinning preparation machine are schematically represented in side view. The heart of the drawframe is the drafting system 1, in which one or more fiber slivers FB - spread out to a web - supplied to the drafting system 1, are drafted in a known way. Here, the fiber sliver(s) FB pass through the drafting system 1 in the direction f3 (see Figure 1). At the output of the drafting system 1, a relatively consistent fiber web results which is compressed in a compressing device 20 into a fiber sliver FB and is transported by a pair of calendar rollers 38,48 into a usually curved sliver duct 71, which is integrated into a turn-table 72, and placed into a can K. The turn-table 72, and thus, the sliver duct 71 rotate about a vertical axis indicated by a dashed line. The can K is also rotated, in that it is placed on a rotating can table 73. The two vertical axes of rotation, of the can table 73 and turn-table 72, run in opposite directions, in a known way, such that the fiber sliver FB is placed in a cycloidal shape into the can K.<br>
The can K stands at an opening in the lower structure 62, which also supports the drafting system 1. A platform 63, upon which an operator B can climb, is arranged in front of the lower structure 62.<br>
For drafting the supplied fiber sliver or slivers FB, the present drafting system 1 includes three pairs of rollers (see Figure 2). These consist, on the one hand of the inlet roller pair, which is composed of the lower inlet roller 35 and the upper inlet roller 45. This is followed in the direction of movement f3 of the fiber sliver or slivers FB by<br>
9<br><br>
the lower middle roller 36 and the upper middle roller 46. Together, the rollers 35, 45, 36, 46 form the so-called preliminary drafting region. The last roller pair in the drafting system 1 is formed by the lower outlet roller 37 and the upper outlet roller 47, which together with the middle rollers 36, 46 represent the so-called main drafting region. The named roller pairs run with different circumferential speeds, such that the fiber sliver or slivers FB, which are spread out into a web in the drafting system 1, and are clamped along the nip line of the respective roller pairs, are drafted according to the ratio of the circumferential speeds.<br>
The lower rollers 35, 36, 37 are supported at their ends in bearings 31, or 32, or 33 (see Figure 1), which for their part are arranged on a support body 65. The upper rollers 45, 46, 47 are supported on a loading arm 50 with two side flanges 52a 52b (see Figure 3), which are connected at their free ends by means of a horizontal bar 54, and are supported at their respective other ends in a pivot bearing 58. By means of this linkage, the loading arm 50 can be swung about the pivot axis 59, see arrow f2 in Figure 1. In order to realize an optimal clamping effect of the fiber sliver or slivers FB in the drafting system 1, the loading arm 50, with its suspended upper rollers 45, 46, 47 is locked in the loading position represented in Figure 1, by means of two pivoted levers 75. The claws at the ends of pivoted levers 75 engage into the horizontal bar 54 of the loading arm 50. During pivoting up of the pivoted levers 75 about the pivot axis 76 (see arrow fl) the loading arm is released and can be swung up around the pivot axis 59. This situation is represented in Figure 2.<br>
The drafting system shown in the Figures 1 - 3 is a so-called 3 over 3 drafting system, which as present is inclined towards the operator B by about approximately 45° relative to a horizontal plane.<br>
It should be noted that in Figures 1 and 2 only mechanical components of the drawframe are represented. Control devices, a central computer, drives, and similar are not shown, because they are not essential in context of the present invention and<br>
10<br><br>
preferably correspond to the known embodiments. Drives with belt transmission and also individual drives, as well as a combination thereof are possible here.<br>
As can be in seen in Figures 1 and 2, an operator B of the drafting system 1 approaches the drawframe from the front, in that he initially steps upon the platform 63, so that he may work at an optimal height. The drafting system 1 is then arranged in front of the abdomen and chest of the operator B. In order to be able to access the fiber sliver or slivers FB in the drafting system 1 - for example for inserting ends of slivers, of the slivers to be drafted, or for cleaning the drafting system 1 - he unlocks the loading arm 50, in order to subsequently pivot it towards himself. In the top view according to Figure 3, the opened drafting system 1 is represented once again for an improved overview.<br>
It is clear from Figures 2 and 3 that the operator B grasps around the loading arm 50 on both sides in order to be able to able to access drafting system 1 or the fiber sliver or slivers FB. Because the free end of the loading arm 50 assumes its rest position in front of his chest, the operator B has a clear view over the loading arm 50 onto the drafting system 1. The favorable ease of use is supported by the inclined arrangement of the drafting system 1.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 represent a section of a drafting system 1 that is yet further inclined relative to the drafting system 1 from the Figures 1-3 (approximately 60° relative to approximately 45°) with a compressing device 20 and a threading-in device 10. Further, in the drafting system 1, in addition to the embodiment shown in Figures 1-3, in each case a cleaning rod 39 contacting the lower rollers 35, 36, 37 is provided, in addition, a pressure rod 49 is arranged in a known way in the main drawing region.<br>
As is clear in context of the Figures 4-8, the compressing device 20 and the threading-in device 10 are integrated into a carrier 2, wherein essential parts of the two devices 20, 10 are formed as one piece with the carrier 2. The carrier 2 is formed as a circumferential, closed frame with an upper frame part 3 and lower frame part 4<br>
11<br><br>
running parallel to it, as well as two connecting side struts 5, 6 connecting the two frame parts 3,4. The compressing device 20 is provided in the upper half of the carrier, the threading-in device 10 is provided in the lower half. In between these two, a central opening 11 is provided, in which the calendar rollers 38,48 engage from both sides, indicated in Figure 6 by the two dashed circles.<br>
The compressing device 20 includes a web nozzle 21 that is formed in the carrier 2, and which has a concave curved contour 23 (see Figure 7), against which the drawn fiber web runs head-on. In this way, the web is forcibly redirected to a web nozzle insert 26, centrally inserted into the web nozzle 20, such that it leaves the web nozzle 21 formed to a fiber sliver FB. The web nozzle 21 is limited towards the bearings 31 -34 by a rigid wall 22, towards the operator by a wall plate 24, which is pivotable in a recess 25. In Figure 4, the wall plate 24 is represented in the working position, in which it is held by magnets 29 at the upper frame part 3, and in Figure 5 in the fault position. In the event of a sliver congestion in the web nozzle 21, the web presses the wall plate 24 from the working position into the fault position, wherein an electrical contact causes the shutdown of the machine.<br>
On the side of the compressing device 20 lying opposite from the wall plate 24, a scraper 28 is mounted, whose free end abuts the calendar roller 48 and scrapes off fiber material.<br>
The web nozzle 21 tapers in the direction of the calendar rollers 38, 48, and extends with a blunt tip 8 into the upper gap formed by the calendar rollers 38, 48. This means that the fiber sliver FB after exiting from the web nozzle 21, or the web nozzle insert 26, is immediately grabbed by the calendar rollers 38, 48 and need not pass through any free paths, which would otherwise increase the danger of sliver run faults.<br>
In the web nozzle insert 26, two injector bores 27 are provided, which run obliquely relative to the vertical, from the outside into the interior of the insert 26, and which<br>
12<br><br>
serve for transporting an initially loose end of the fiber sliver through the insert 26. The two injector bores 27 are supplied with compressed air, which is secured through a supply feed 15 provided on the carrier 2, wherein no seal is used at the compressed air transfer site. The supply feed 15 provides air to a distributing main 17 that is running in the carrier 2, and which in turn opens into a first air supply line 18, which finally leads to the injector bores 27. The lines 17,18 are implemented as bores in the carrier 2.<br>
The threading-in device 10 is arranged below the calendar rollers 38, 48, and serves to thread the fiber sliver FB into the subsequent sliver duct 71. A blunt tip 7 of the threading-in device 10 extends into the lower gap formed by the calendar rollers 38, 48. The threading-in device 10 includes an insert 12 inserted from below, which points to the fiber duct 71, and which is held in the carrier 2 with a set screw 12a or similar (see Figure 6).<br>
Two injector bores 13 are also provided in the insert 12, which on the one hand, help to transport the fiber sliver FB into the sliver duct 71, and on the other hand serve for creating spin in the sliver FB. The distribution main 17 opens into an air supply line 14 which feeds the two injector bores 13. The line 14 is also implemented as a bore in the carrier 2.<br>
While the bore opening of the perpendicular bore for the distribution main 17 is closed and sealed by a blanking plug 16, a set screw or throttle screw 16b, or similar is threaded into the bore openings of the first and second air supply line 18,14, respectively, and which can close to a variable degree the transition from the distribution main 17 into the first or second air supply line, 18 or 14, respectively. In this way, the air supply into the injector bores 18 or 14 can be regulated. Alternately, this could be realized with a controlled valve mechanism.<br>
The carrier 2 can be grasped simply with both hands or with one hand at the side struts 5,6 and / or the wall plate 24, and in nearly linear movement (according to the<br>
13<br><br>
double arrow f4) can be brought into its working position, shown in the Figures 4 and 5, and again removed from it. Two lateral guide grooves 19 (see Figure 7) at the struts 5, 6 also serve for this, and during insertion and removal of the carrier 2, glide along two pins, not shown, on the machine. The carrier 2 is held in cylindrical bearings at a drafting system mounting by means of magnets, not shown, such that it can be removed from its work position by overcoming this force. Also, during a sliver congestion or a lap formation in the area of the outlet rollers and / or the calendar rollers, the carrier 2 can be pressed by the fiber material out of its working position, wherein advantageously the machine is then automatically shut down by means of an electronic contact or by a sensor triggering.<br>
The invention was described in detail by means of an exemplary embodiment. Further implementation possibilities can be realized within the scope of the claims. For example, the carrier could also be composed from two or more frame parts, which are screwed together or held fixed together in another way, and if applicable, are re-leasably connected together. Here too, the carrier is preferably brought into, or removed from, its work position as a whole.<br>
