PYRIMIDONE COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compounds that are useful as an active ingredient of a medicament for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of diseases mainly caused by abnormal activity of tau protein kinase 1, such as neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer disease).<br>
Background Art<br>
Alzheimer disease is progressive senile dementia, in which marked cerebral cortical atrophy is observed due to degeneration of nerve cells and decrease of nerve cell number.    Pathologically, numerous senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are observed in brain.    The number of patients has been increased with the increment of aged population, and the disease arises a serious social problem.   Although various theories have been proposed, a cause of the disease has not yet been elucidated.    Early resolution of the cause has been desired.<br>
It has been known that the degree of appearance of two characteristic pathological changes of Alzheimer disease well correlates to the degree of intellectual dysfunction.    Therefore, researches have been conducted from early 1980's to reveal the cause of the disease through molecular level investigations of components of the two pathological changes.    Senile plaques accumulate extracellularly, and  j3   amyloid protein has been elucidated as their main component (abbreviated as "A j3 " hereinafter in the specification- Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 120, 885 (1984); EMBO J., 4, 2757 (1985); Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82, 4245 (1985)).    In the other pathological change, i.e., the neurofibrillary tangles, a double-helical filamentous substance called paired helical filament (abbreviated as "PHF" hereinafter in the specification) accumulate intracellularly, and tau protein, which is a kind of microtubule-associated<br><br>
protein specific for brain, has been revealed as its main component (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85, 4506 (1988); Neuron, 1, 827 (1988)).<br>
Furthermore, on the basis of genetic investigations, presenilins 1 and 2 were found as causative genes of familial Alzheimer disease (Nature, 375, 754 (1995); Science, 269, 973 (1995); Nature. 376, 775 (1995)), and it has been revealed that presence of mutants of presenilins 1 and 2 promotes the secretion of A)S   (Neuron, 17, 1005 (1996); Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94, 2025 (1997)).    From these results, it is considered that, in Alzheimer disease, Aj3   abnormally accumulates and agglomerates due to a certain reason, which engages with the formation of PHF to cause death of nerve cells.    It is also expected that extracellular outflow of glutamic acid and activation of glutamate receptor responding to the outflow may possibly be important factors in an early process of the nerve cell death caused by ischemic cerebrovascular accidents.<br>
It has been reported that kainic acid treatment that stimulates the AMPA receptor, one of glutamate receptor, increases mRNA of the amyloid precursor protein (abbreviated as "APP" hereinafter in the specification) as a precursor of A)3   (Society for Neuroscience Abstracts, 17, 1445 (1991)), and also promotes metabolism of APP (The Journal of Neuroscience, 10, 2400 (1990)).    Therefore, it has been strongly suggested that the accumulation of Aβ  is involved in cellular death due to ischemic cerebrovascular disorders.    Other diseases in which abnormal accumulation and agglomeration of Aβ  are observed include, for example, Down syndrome, cerebral bleeding due to solitary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Lewy body disease and the like. Furthermore, as diseases showing neurofibrillary tangles due to the PHF accumulation, examples include progressive supranuclear palsy, subacute sclerosing panencephalitic parkinsonism, postencephalitic parkinsonism, pugilistic encephalitis, Guam parkinsonisnrdementia complex, Lewy body disease and the like.<br>
The tau protein is generally composed of a group of related proteins that forms several bands at molecular weights of 48'65 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and it promotes the formation of microtubules.    It has been verified<br><br>
that tau protein incorporated in the PHF in the brain suffering from Alzheimer disease is abnormally phosphorylated compared with usual tau protein (J. Biochem., 99, 1807 (1986); Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 83, 4913 (1986)).    An enzyme catalyzing the abnormal phosphorylation has been isolated.    The protein was named as tau protein kinase 1 (abbreviated as "TPKl" hereinafter in the specification), and its physicochemical properties have been elucidated (J. Biol. Chem., 267, 10897 (1992)). Moreover, cDNAof rat TPKl was cloned from a rat cerebral cortex cDNA library based on a partial amino acid sequence of TPKl, and its nucleotide sequence was determined and an amino acid sequence was deduced.    As a result, it has been revealed that the primary structure of the rat TPKl corresponds to that of the enzyme known as rat GSK-3   0   (glycogen synthase kinase 30, FEBS Lett., 325, 167(1993)).<br>
It has been reported that A )3 , the main component of senile plaques, is neurotoxic (Science, 250, 279 (1990)).    However, various theories have been proposed as for the reason why Aβ causes the cell death, and any authentic theory has not yet been established.    Takashima et al. observed that the cell death was caused by Aβ treatment of fetal rat hippocampus primary culture system, and then found that the TPKl activity was increased by Aβ treatment and the cell death by A β  was inhibited by antisense of TPKl (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA, 90, 7789 (1993); EP616032).<br>
In view of the foregoing, compounds which inhibit the TPKl activity may possibly suppress the neurotoxicity of Aβ    and the formation of PHF and inhibit the nerve cell death in the Alzheimer disease, thereby cease or defer the progress of the disease.    The compounds may also be possibly used as a medicament for therapeutic treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disorder, Down syndrome, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral bleeding due to Lewy body disease and the like by suppressing the cytotoxicity of Aβ.    Furthermore, the compounds may possibly be used as a medicament for therapeutic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy, subacute sclerosing panencephalitic parkinsonism, postencephalitic parkinsonism, pugilistic encephalitis, Guam parkinsonisnrdementia complex, Lewy body disease, Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration and<br><br>
frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, traumatic injuries, brain and spinal cord trauma, peripheral neuropathies, retinopathies and glaucoma, as well as other diseases such as non-insulin dependent diabetes, obesity, manic depressive illness, schizophrenia, alopecia, breast cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid cancer, T or B-cell leukemia, and several virus-induced tumors.<br>
As structurally similar compounds to the compounds of the present invention represented by formula (I) described later, the compounds disclosed in the International Publication Nos. WO01/70729, WO03/037888 and WO03/027080 are known.    However, these compounds are not enough as medicament in the pharmacokinetics and so on.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide compounds useful as an active ingredient of a medicament for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer disease.    More specifically, the object is to provide novel compounds useful as an active ingredient of a medicament that enables radical prevention and/or treatment of the neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease by inhibiting the TPKl activity to suppress the neurotoxicity of Aβ and the formation of the PHF and by inhibiting the death of nerve cells.<br>
In order to achieve the foregoing object, the inventors of the present invention conducted screenings of various compounds having inhibitory activity against the phosphorylation of TPKl.    As a result, they found that compounds represented by the following formula (I) had the desired activity and were useful as an active ingredient of a medicament for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of the aforementioned diseases.    The present invention was achieved on the basis of these findings.<br>

The phosphorylation was started by adding ATP, and the reaction was conducted at 25t for 2 hours, and then stopped by adding 21% perchloric acid on ice cooling.    The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes and adsorbed on P81 paper (Whatmann), and then the paper was washed four times with 75 mM phosphoric acid, three times with water and once with acetone.   The paper was dried, and the residual radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. The results are shown in the table below.    The test compound markedly inhibited the P-GS1 phosphorylation by TPK1.    The results strongly suggest that the medicaments of the present invention inhibit the TPK1 activity, thereby suppress the Aβneurotoxicity and the PHF formation, and that the medicaments of the present invention are effective for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of Alzheimer disease and the above-mentioned diseases.<br><br><br><br><br>
Experiment 2 * Inhibitory activity on tau phosphorylation in vivo<br>
Test compound was administrated to male CD-I mice of 5-6 weeks weighing 25-35 g (Charles River Japan, inc.) at 1, 3, 10, 30 mg/kg p.o. (0.5% Tween/H20 suspension) and after lhour, mice were decapitated and cortex was promptly removed, followed by being frozen in liquid N2.    Cortex was directly homogenized with 2.3% SDS homogenization buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, 2.3% SDS, 1 mM each of EDTA, EGTA and DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail (sigma P2714) containing 0.2  11 M 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 13  n M bestatin, 1.4 n M E-64, 0.1 mM leupeptin, 30 nM aprotinin, pH 6.8) and centrifuged at 15000 x g for 15 min at 4°C.    Protein concentrations were determined using DC protein assay kit (BIORAD). Supernatants were diluted with sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% Bromophenol Blue, pH6.8) to adjust the protein concentrations around 0.5 - 2 mg/mg and then boiled for 5 min. 10  11 g of samples were applied on 10% SDS-PAGE mini slab gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes.    Membranes were incubated with PBS containing 5% non-fat milk for Ih at room temperature and then probed with pS396 anti-body (BIOSOURCE) over night at 4°C.   Anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated anti-body (Promega) was used as secondary anti-body.    Membranes were visualized by ECL kit (Amerasham Bioscience) and detected by LAS 1000 (Fuji Photo Film).<br>
