METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANUFACTURING GRANULAR METALLIC IRON<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing<br>
reduced iron by directly reducing an iron oxide source such as<br>
ii iron ore and iron oxide in a thermal reduction furnace/ and an<br>
apparatus for manufacturing reduced iron by this method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
II The direct reduced iron producing method has been known as<br>
a method for directly reducing an iron oxide source such as iron<br>
.1 ore and iron oxide (which may be hereinafter referred ,jto as iron<br>
oxide-containing material), by using a carbonaceous lireducing<br>
agent (carbonaceous material) such as coal and a reducing gas so<br>
as to obtain reduced iron. The direct reduced iron producing<br>
method is based on such a procedure as charging a raw material<br>
mixture including the iron oxide-containing material and the<br>
,i<br>
carbonaceous reducing agent onto the hearth of a moving<br>
|i hearth-type thermal reduction furnace (for example, rotary hearth<br>
furnace), heating the raw material mixture with the heat from a<br>
burner and radiation heat while the raw material mixture is moved<br>
in the furnace so as to reduce the iron oxide includedijin the raw<br>
material mixture by the carbonaceous reducing agent, carburizing<br>
and melting the metallic iron (reduced iron) thus obtained,<br><br>
coalescing the molten metallic iron to granules while separating it from the subgenerated slag, and cooling and solidifying the molten metallic iron so as to obtain granular metallic iron {reduced iron).<br>
The direct reduced iron producing method does nqt require a large scale facility such as blast furnace and has= high flexibility with regards to resources for example, this method makes it unnecessary to use coke, therefore recently has been vigorously studied for commercial application.  However, the<br>
direct reduced iron producing method has various problems to be<br>
If<br>
solved in order to be applied on an industrial scale, 'including the stability of operation, safety, economy and quality of the<br>
granular metallic iron (product).	j<br>
II<br>
The granular metallic iron produced by the direct reduced<br>
iron producing method is sent to an existing steel making facility<br>
such as electric furnace or converter, and is used as the iron<br>
source. Therefore, with respect to the quality of the granular<br>
metallic iron, it is required to decrease the sulfur content in<br>
the granular metallic iron (may be hereinafter referred to as S<br>
content) to as low a level as possible.  It is also desirable that<br>
the carbon content in the granular metallic iron (may be<br>
hereinafter referred to as C content) is high within a reasonable<br>
range, in order to broaden the applicability of the granular<br>
metallic iron as the iron source.<br>
;	j<br>
The inventors of the present application previously<br><br>
proposed a technology. disclosed in Patent Document 111, which increases the purity of granular metallic iron so as to improve the quality of the granular metallic iron.  Patent Document 1 discloses a method of increasing the purity of the granular metallic iron, which prevents the metallic iron from being<br>
ii<br>
oxidized again in a zone from the last stage of reduction to the<br>
'	'	!!<br>
completion of carburization and melting by controlling the<br>
■l|<br>
compacts during carburizing and melting to a proper irlevel.<br>
Patent Document 1 also describes a technology to decrease<br>
the sulfur content in the granular metallic iron.  Specifically,<br>
such a method of decreasing the sulfur content is disclosed that<br>
is based on controlling the basicity of the slag which is a<br>
byproduct generated when melting the metallic iron. .|S<br>
I] The inventors ofi the present application also previously<br>
proposed a technology described in Patent Document 2, besides that<br>
ti<br>
of Patent Document 1, which decreases the sulfur content in the<br>
granular metallic iron.  Patent Document 2 discloses afmethod of<br>
if decreasing the sulfur content in the granular metallic, iron by<br>
\f controlling the basicity of the slag-forming component, that is<br>
determined from the composition of the raw material mixture, and<br>
controlling the MgO content in the slag-forming component.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will now be[described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.  It is<br>
understood that the drawings are not intended to limit the present<br>
Ij invention, and there may be conceived various modifications to<br>
an extent that fits the foregoing and subsequent descriptions and<br><br>
are regarded as falling within the scope of the present invention.<br>
'	'<br>
&gt;j<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram explanatory of an example of the constitution of a rotary hearth-type thermal redaction furnace, among moving hearth-type thermal reduction furnaces. In a rotary hearth-type thermal reduction furnace A,-; a raw material mixture 1 including an iron oxide-containing material and a carbonaceous reducing agent is charged continuously through a material-charging hopper (charging means) 3 onto a rotary hearth 4 located in a furnace body 8.  The raw material mixture 1 may<br>
include CaO, MgO, SiO? or other components which are included as<br>
k<br>
the gangue or ash content, and may also include coal, !;dolomite, binder and the like as required.  The raw material mixture 1 may be in the form of plain compacts or formed compacts such as pellets or briquettes. The raw material mixture 1 may be charged together with a carbonaceous material 2 in a powdery state. ;|<br>
A procedure of charging the raw material raixtureU into the thermal reduction furnace A will now be described. ;:Before charging the raw material mixture 1, the carbonaceous material<br>
2	in a powdery state is charged from the material charging hopper<br>
3	onto the rotary hearth 4 so as to form a bed of the carbonaceous material 2, upon 'which the raw material mixture 1 is charged.<br>
While Fig. 1 shows■ the case where one material-charging<br>
hopper 3 is used to charge.both the raw material mixture 1 and<br>
i! the carbonaceous material 2, two or more hoppers maybe used to<br>
charge the raw material mixture 1 and the carbonaceous material<br><br>
2 separately-  The carbonaceous material 2 that is charged to form<br>
■i<br>
the bed is very useful not only for improving the efficiency of<br>
reducing, but also_for accelerating the desulfurization of the<br>
granular metallic iron obtained by heat reduction.<br>
The rotary hearth 4 of the rotary hearth-type thermal<br>
i| reduction furnace A shown in Fig. 1 is driven to rotate<br>
counterclockwise. While the rotating speed depends on the size<br>
and operating conditions of the thermal reduction furnace A, the<br>
hearth typically makes one full turn in about 8 to 16 minutes.<br>
i<br>
i!<br>
The furnace body 8 of the thermal reduction furnace A has a plurality of heating burners (heating means) 5 installed on the wall surface thereof, so as to supply heat to the hearth through the combustion heat of the heating burner 5 or radiation heat therefrom.<br>
The raw material mixture 1 charged onto the rotary hearth 4 constituted from a refractory material is heated by the combustion heat of the heating burner 5 or radiation heat<br>
therefrom while moving on the rotary hearth 4 toward thejperiphery<br>
i' in the thermal reduction furnace A.  Iron oxide included in the<br>
raw material mixture 1 is reduced while moving through!a heating<br>
zone within the thermal reduction furnace A.  Then, reduced iron<br>
is melted while being carburized by the remaining carbonaceous<br>
ij<br>
reducing agent. The molten reduced iron is then coalesced to<br>
ii<br>
granular metallic iron 10 while the molten slag which'fis formed as a byproduct is separated therefrom.  The granular metallic iron<br><br>
10 is cooled and solidified by the cooling means in !a zone downstream of the thermal reduction furnace A, and is then discharged successively from the hearth by a discharging device (discharging means) 6 such as screw. At this time, while the slag is discharged at the same time, the metallic iron and the slag are separated by a separating means (such as a sieve or a magnetic classifier) after discharged from a hopper 9.  In Fig. 1, reference numeral 7 denotes a waste gas duct.      =|<br>
When manufacturing the granular metallic iron in the moving<br>
hearth-type thermal reduction furnace, it is desired to.'carburize<br>
ii<br>
the granular metallic iron with a sufficient amount of carbon (may be hereinafter referred to as C) in order to broaderi the<br>
applicability of the granular metallic iron as an iron source,<br>
i-and to minimize the sulfur (may be hereinafter referred to as S)<br>
ij<br>
content in order to improve the quality of the granular metallic<br>
iron as described above.<br>
The inventors of the present application conducted research<br>
i; ii<br>
aimed at increasing the C content and minimizing thesis content in the granular metallic iron.  It was found that the composition<br>
of the granular.metallic iron, which is obtained by heat-reducing<br>
l	:!<br>
the raw material mixture including the iron oxide-containing<br>
II<br>
material and the carbonaceous reducing agent, is greatly affected<br>
■f by the flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the thermal<br>
reduction furnace .   ■;<br>
The inventors of the present application verified that the<br><br>
composition of the granular metallic iron is influenced by the flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the thermal reduction furnace through such a mechanism as follows .  The smaller the flow<br>
;! I<br>
velocity of the atmospheric gas in the thermal reduction furnace, the smaller the flow velocity of the atmospheric gas becomes in the vicinity of the raw material mixture. Since the raw material mixture is surrounded by a reducing gas discharged from the bed material, a slower flow velocity accelerates the reduction and carburization reactions as a high reduction degree of the atmospheric gas is maintained, thus enabling a granular metallic iron having a high C content to be obtained. It was also verified that, when the reduction degree of the atmospheric gas is high in the vicinity of the raw material mixture, S in the raw material mixture can be easily fixed in the form of CaS in the slag by the<br>
CaO component of the raw material, thus accelerating the decrease<br>
■i<br>
in the S content in the :granular metallic iron which is:'produced. A similar effect can be achieved also by decreasing the mean gas flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the furnace, instead of decreasing the mean flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the, vicinity of the raw material mixture within the furnace. .In the description that follows, the mean gas flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the furnace will be taken as the. flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the thermal reduction furnace.<br>
Fig. 2 is a graph showing the relationships between the mean gas flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the thermal!reduction<br><br>
furnace and the C content in the granular metallic iron, and<br>
ii s.<br>
between the mean gas flow velocity and the S content in the granular metallic iron. In Fig. 2, the proportion of sulfur content u (S) / [S] " is used as an index of the sulfur content in the granular metallic iron, where (S) represents the concentration.jof sulfur in the molten slag and [S] represents the concentration^ sulfur in the molten iron (reduced iron) . The value of C consent shown in Fig. 2 is given as a relative value normalized to the C content in the granular metallic iron (which is set to 1) obtained in the apparatus shown in Fig. 3, which will be described later, where all the heating burners installed in the furnace are air burners. Similarly, the proportion of sulfur content shown inijFig. 2 is given as a relative value normalized to the sulfur content in the granular metallic iron (which is set to 1) obtained ,;in the apparatus shown in Fig. 3, which will be described later, where all the heating burners installed in the furnace are air burners. The mean gas flow velocity is given by calculating the mean gas flow velocity at a position between an air burner 5e and an oxygen<br>
burner 5f of the apparatus shown in Fig. 3, which will be described<br>
ij later.  The method of measuring the mean gas flow velocity will'<br>
s<br>
be described later.	:<br>
i:<br>
As will be clearly seen from Fig. 2, there is a correlation between the mean gas flow velocity of the atmospheric gas and the C content in the granular metallic iron.  A correlation exists<br>
:j<br>
also between the mean gas flow velocity of the atmospheric gas<br><br>
and the S content in the granular metallic iron. Specifically,<br>
the concentration of sulfur in the molten slag (S) can be increased<br>
relative to the concentration of sulfur in the molten iron<br>
(reduced iron) [S], by controlling the mean gas flow velocity to<br>
5 meters per second or less (particularly 2.5 meters per second<br>
or less) and, as a result, the concentration of sulfur in the molten<br>
iron (reduced iron) [S] can be decreased.<br>
i The flow velocity of the atmospheric gas is preferably<br>
controlled at least in a zone ranging from the last stage of<br>
reducing the iron oxide (may be referred to simply as the last<br>
stage of reduction in this specification) to the completion of<br>
melting of the metallic iron (may be referred to simply as the<br>
completion of melting in this specification) in the furnace body.<br>
This is because, in the area from the last stage of reduction to<br>
the melting zone, the vicinity of the raw material mixture is kept<br>
as a reducing atmosphere by the gas discharged from vthe<br>
carbonaceous reducing agent and the bed material, and this<br>
atmospheric gas has great influence on the composition of the<br>
granular metallic iron.  Therefore, the C content in the granular<br>
metallic iron can be increased and S content can be decreased by'<br>
controlling the gas velocity in this zone.  The flow velocity of<br>
the atmospheric gas may be controlled throughout the furnace body,<br>
not only in the zone from the last stage of reduction of the iron<br>
oxide to the completion of melting of the metallic iron. While.<br>
ii the position in the furnace body corresponding to the last stage<br><br>
of reduction varies depending on the scale and operation<br>
conditions of the thermal reduction furnace, as a rough guideline,<br>
il<br>
it may be a position about two thirds from the upstre'am in the<br>
heating zone.  The heating zone refers to an area within the<br>
.1<br>
ji<br>
furnace body where the heating burners are installed'!<br>
The flow velocity of atmospheric gas in the predetermined<br>
if zone of the furnace body can be controlled by providing means for<br>
controlling the flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the moving<br>
i hearth-type thermal reduction furnace.  For example, '!the flow<br>
I! I<br>
velocity control means imay be oxygen burners provided as part of<br>
!j<br>
the heating burners that heat the inside of the thermal reduction<br>
il furnace, or such a construction as the height from the 'hearth to<br>
the ceiling (may be referred to simply as the height of the ceiling<br>
in this specification} at least in the zone from the last stage<br>
ii<br>
of reduction to the completion of melting within the furnace body<br>
is larger than the height from the hearth to the ceiling in the<br>
other zones of the furnace body. This will be described below<br>
by making reference to the drawings.	;<br>
First, a rotary hearth-type thermal reduction furnace<br>
:	i!<br>
!i<br>
having oxygen burners used as part of the heating burners that<br>
ii heat the inside of the thermal reduction furnace as ,t'he flow<br>
velocity control means will be described.  Fig. 3 is a ."schematic<br>
■i sectional view of the rotary hearth-type thermal reduction<br>
furnace shown in Fig. 1 developed along a hypothetical cylindrical<br>
surface which includes line B-B, showing an area from the<br><br>
material-charging section to the metallic iron-discharging<br>
ii<br>
section in the rotary hearth-type thermal reduction furnace.<br>
Portions identical to those shown in Fig. 1 are identified with<br>
identical reference numerals.	Ij<br>
Fig. 3 shows the zone from the last stage of reduction to the completion of melting as an area where the heating burners 5a through 5h are installed, and the heating burners 5f through<br>
i	.!<br>
5hare installed oh the wall surface of the furnace body/8 . Among the heating burners, the heating burners 5a through 5e are air burners and the heating burners 5f through 5h are oxygen burners. Air burner refers to a burner that burns a combustible gas {for example, methane gas) by mixing air therewith, and oxygen burner refers to a burner that burns a combustible gas by mixing oxygen<br>
therewith.  In the air burner, larger quantities of gases that<br>
jl do not contribute to the combustion (i.e. uninvolved gases with<br>
-i<br>
combustion, such as nitrogen, argon) are supplied per 'unit time<br>
i!<br>
than in the case of the oxygen burner when the both burners burn the same amount of a combustible gas. As shown in Fig. 3, the furnace body 8 has a cooling zone 11 provided therein for cooling the molten iron obtained by heat reduction, and the codling zone 11 has a cooling means 12 installed therein.        .j<br>
i1<br>
The raw material mixture 1 charged through the-material<br>
if<br>
charging hopper 3 in the upstream at a position located on the left-hand side in Fig. 3 is heated and reduced while i'moving to<br>
ij<br>
the right-hand side (downstream) in Fig. 3. .The.floW velocity<br><br>
of the atmospheric gas in the furnace can be decreased' by using the oxygen burners 5f through 5h as at least part of the burners that heat the inside of the thermal reduction furnace. In the case where air burners are used for all of the heating burners 5a through 5h, since oxygen accounts for about 20% by volume of air, a gas flow rate of about 80% by volume of the air which does not contribute to the combustion has an influence on the attempt to increase -the flow velocity in the thermal reduction-furnace . The use of the oxygen burners as at least part of the heating burners, however, makes it possible to decrease the total gas quantity supplied to the thermal reduction furnace and, as a<br>
ii<br>
result, to decrease the flow velocity of atmospheric gas in the furnace while maintaining the level of combustion heat generated by using the air burners.<br>
The mean gas flow velocity of atmospheric gas in the furnace<br>
V (m/sec.) is calculated by dividing the total gas flow rate Q<br>
(m3/sec.) by the cross sectional area D (m2) of the inner space<br>
of the furnace perpendicular to the moving direction in the<br>
!i furnace as indicated by the equation (1) .  The total gas flow rate<br>
!j<br>
Q'{m3/sec.) is the quantity of gas flowing per unit time after<br>
ii<br>
combustion, determined from the quantity of fuel supplied into the furnace per unit time (second) and the quantity :iof oxygen-containing gas supplied per unit time (second) for burning the fuel.<br>
V = Q/D	(1)<br><br>
When methane gas, for example, is supplied as the fuel and<br>
is burned in the furnace, the chemical reaction represented"by<br>
(2) occurs.  The quantity of gas generated by combustion can be<br>
calculated from the quantity of fuel supplied into the furnace<br>
and the quantity of oxygen-containing gas supplied for burning<br>
the fuel.  The quantity of gas is preferably calculated by<br>
converting the quantity into volume at the actual temperature and<br>
!i<br>

The gas generated by combustion in the furnace flows from the upstream of the hearth toward the waste gas duct 7,, or from the downstream of the hearth toward the waste gas duct .-7, in the case where the waste gas duct 7 is provided above the space between the air burners 5c and 5d as shown in Fig. 3. Thus, the mean gas flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the zone from the last stage of reduction to the completion of melting may be calculated by dividing the gas flow rate passing the start position of the<br>
i!<br>
last stage of reduction (position between the air burner 5e and the oxygen burner 5f in Fig. 3) by the longitudinal sectional area of the furnace {area of the flow path) at the start position of<br>
the last stage of reduction (position between the air;j'burner 5e<br>
'i<br>
and the oxygen burner 5f in Fig. 3).  In this case, the gas passing<br>
|i the start position of the last stage of reduction flows from the<br>
right toward the left in Fig. 3.  Therefore, the gas!!flow rate<br>
through the start position of the last stage of reduction may be<br><br>
determined by calculating the total quantity of gas after combustion from the quantity of fuel supplied to the!] oxygen burners 5f through 5h and the quantity of oxygen-including gas supplied for burning the fuel. This is because, since the waste gas duct 7 is provided above the space between the air burners 5c and 5d, the flow velocity of the gas generated by burning the fuel in the air burners 5a through 5e has no influence on the mean gas flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the zone from the last<br>
stage of reduction to the completion of melting.<br>
■|	.	;:<br>
ri	'I<br>
The mean gas flow velocity can be controlled by adjusting<br>
the number of air burners and oxygen burners, the arrangement of<br>
the air "burners and the oxygen burners, or the quantities of the<br>
fuel and the oxygen-containing gas for burning the fuel: supplied<br>
to the air burners and to the oxygen burners.  Instead of the air<br>
burners and the oxygen burners, a burner to which a relatively<br>
large quantity of gas. that does not contribute to combustion<br>
i|<br>
(uninvolved gas with combustion) is supplied per unit time (second<br>
ii<br>
burner) and a burner to which a relatively small quantity of gas<br>
I	j;<br>
that does not contribute to combustion is supplied per unit time (first burner), where the "relatively large" and the "relatively small" mean a relative comparison based on the same amount of fuel in combustion, may be used.<br>
According to the present invention, there is no limitation on the position where the waste gas duct 7 is installed, ji In order to make the flow velocity of the atmospheric gas as low as'possible<br><br>
in the zone from the last stage of reduction to the completion<br>
ii<br>
of melting, however, it is preferable to install the waste gas<br>
■j<br>
duct 7 at a position upstream (nearer to the position where the raw material mixture is supplied) than the zone from the last stage<br>
i!<br>
of reduction to the completion of melting.'	■'<br>
i .While there is no restriction on the zone of the thermal<br>
reduction furnace where the oxygen burners are installed, the<br>
ii<br>
jj<br>
burner may be installed at least in the zone from the last stage<br>
I;<br>
of reduction to the completion of melting.  The oxygen burners<br>
i may also be used in the entire zone within the thermal reduction<br>
furnace.	■'<br>
ji<br>
While there is no restriction on the position where an oxygen burner (first burner) is installed, the burner is preferably installed at a position at least 1 meter above the surface of the hearth. This is because, even when the oxygen burners |]are used instead of the air burners, the gas velocity becomes high if the oxygen burners are installed near the hearth.<br>
In order to decrease the flow velocity of the atmospheric<br>
gas in the vicinity of the raw material mixture, it is preferable<br>
;j<br>
to install the oxygen burners (first burners) as far away from<br>
the hearth surface as possible .  However, when the oxygen burners<br>
ii are installed away from the hearth too much, efficiency of heating<br>
J! becomes lower.  Installing the oxygen burners near the ceiling<br>
ii<br>
may result in damaging of the ceiling caused by the heat:|from the burner.  Thus, the oxygen burners (first burner) are preferably<br><br>
installed at positions at least 1 meter away from the ceiling<br>
it<br>
surface.	||<br>
Oxygen concentration in the oxygen-containing gas:'supplied " to the oxygen burners (first burners) is preferably as high as possible so as to decrease the flow velocity of the atmospheric gas. This is because a higher oxygen concentration leads to a lower concentration of gases that do not contribute to combustion. The proportion of oxygen gas in the gas supplied may be, for example, 90% by volume or higher.<br>
The constitution of the rotary hearth-type thermal<br>
ii<br>
reduction furnace employed as the flow velocity control means will now be described, where the height from the hearth to the ceiling<br>
is at least in the zone from the last stage of reduction to the<br>
:i<br>
completion of melting of the metallic iron in the entire furnace<br>
is larger than the height from the hearth to the ceiling in the<br>
r other zones of the furnace body.<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic sectional view showing an example of partially modifying the constitution shown in Fig. 3, where the furnace body 8 has the heating burners 5a through 5e and the heating burners 5i through 5k installed on the wall surface thereof, while the area where the heating burners 5i through 5k are installed corresponds to the zone from the last stage of reduction to the completion of melting. In Fig. 4, all of the heating burners are air burners.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the furnace body 8 having such a conffiguration<br><br>
as the height of the ceiling in the zone where the heating burners 5i through 5k are installed is larger than the ceiling height in the other zones. Making the ceiling higher in this way enables the volume of the inner space of the furnace corresponding to the zone from the last stage.of reduction to the completion of melting to be increased.  This in turn enables the flow velocity of the<br>
i:<br>
atmospheric gas in the furnace to be lower than in the case where the ceiling in this zone is lower.<br>
Fig. 5 is a graph showing the relationship between the relative value of the ceiling and the relative value of ;the mean flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the furnace. ..<br>
The relative value of height of the ceiling was "given in terms of the height of the ceiling in the zone from the last stage of reduction to the completion of melting relative to the height-of the ceiling in the zones up to the last stage of reduction (other zones) , by taking as a reference the case where the ceiling height is not changed between the input area where the raw material mixture is charged and the output area where the granular metallic iron is discharged to the outside {namely, the case offsetting the ceiling height constant as shown in Fig. 3).     {<br>
The relative value of the mean gas flow velocity of the atmospheric gas was given in terms of a value calculated from mean gas flow velocity with changed ceiling height in the zone from the last stage of reduction to the completion of melting, by taking as a reference the case where the ceiling height is not"changed<br><br>
between the input area where the raw material mixture is charged and the output area where the granular metallic iron is discharged to the outside (namely, the case of setting the ceiling height constant as shown in Fig. 3) . The mean gas flow velocity was calculated for a position where the height of'the ceiling above the hearth is changed (for example, between the heating burners<br>
!j<br>
5e and 5i in the case shown in Fig. 4) .	■!       '<br>
As will be clearly seen from Fig. 5, the flow velocity of<br>
the atmospheric gas in the furnace decreases when the ceiling<br>
height is increased.	i;<br>
While the case where only the air burners are used as the heating burners is shown in Fig. 4, one or plurality of oxygen burners (first burners) may also be provided for a part of the<br>
heating burners as the flow velocity control means.<br>
il In the example of the constitution shown in Fig. 3 and Fig.<br>
•4, a partition wall may be installed in the furnace, in order to<br>
minimize the influence exerted by the flow velocity of the<br>
!' I-<br>
atmospheric gas in the other zones of the furnace on the flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the zone from the last stage of reduction to the completion of melting in the furnace. For example, in the case where the zone from the last stage of reduction to the completion of melting is the zone where the oxygen'burners 5f through 5h are installed as shown in Fig. 3, a suspended partition wall may be installed on the ceiling between-i the air burner 5e and the oxygen burner 5f.  In this case, an exhau'st means<br><br>
may be installed on the ceiling in each zone so as to discharge<br>
si<br>
the waste gas from each zone to the outside.<br>
While the case of using the rotary hearth-type ithermal reduction furnace as the moving hearth-type thermal reduction furnace has been described, the present invention is not limited<br>
I;<br>
to the rotary hearth-type thermal reduction furnace, and any moving hearth-type such as straight type thermal reduction furnace may also be employed.<br>
As described above, the method for manufacturing the granular metallic iron according to one aspect of the.present invention, whereby the granular metallic iron is manufactured by reducing the raw material mixture including the iron oxide-containing material and the carbonaceous reducing agent, comprises: a step of charging the raw material mixture onto a hearth of a moving hearth-type thermal reduction furnace; a step of reducing the iron oxide in the raw material mixture by the carbonaceous reducing agent through the application of heat, thereby forming metallic iron, subsequently melting the metallic iron, and then coalescing the molten metallic iron to granular metallic iron while separating-the molten metallic iron from subgenerated slag; and a step of cooling and solidifying the metallic iron; wherein the heat-reducing step includes a step of controlling a flow velocity of an atmospheric gas in a predetermined zone of the furnace within a predetermined range.<br>
According to the method of manufacturing the granular<br><br>
metallic iron of the present invention, the quality of the granular metallic iron can be improved by controlling.the flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in a predetermined zone of the furnace within a predetermined range when manufacturing the granular metallic iron In the moving hearth-type thermal reduction furnace. More specifically, the C content in the granular metallic iron can be increased and the S content can be decreased-.<br>
According to the method of manufacturing the granular<br>
metallic iron of the present invention, the flow velocity of the<br>
,s<br>
atmospheric gas is preferably in a range from 0 meters per second<br>
i	■■<br>
to 5 meters per second on average. When the velocity is within this range, the reduction degree of the atmospheric gas is maintained at a high level so that reduction and carburization proceed efficiently, and therefore the C content in the granular metallic iron can be increased and the S content can be decreased. Also, according to the method of manufacturing the granular metallic iron of the present invention, it is preferable that the predetermined zone is a zone from a last stage of reducing the<br>
iron oxide to the completion of melting of the metallic iron.  This<br>
■i makes it possible to improve the quality of the granular metallic<br>
iron by keeping the reducing atmosphere in this zone. ;<br>
Also, according to the method of manufacturing the granular<br>
metallic iron of the present invention, it is preferable that<br>
burners are used in heating of the thermal reduction furnace, and<br><br>
one<br>
a first burner is used in the predetermined zone, while In a z or zones other than the predetermined zone a second burner to which a larger quantity of gas which do not contribute to the combustion i-s supplied per unit time than to the first burner, in'the case that the same quantity of fuel is burned in the both burners, is used.  In this case, it is preferable to use the oxygen burners in the predetermined zone- and use at least air burners i*n a zone or zones other than the predetermined zone.  This makes it possible to make the total quantity of gas supplied into the thermal reduction furnace smaller compared to a case of using air burners as some or all of the heating burners in the predetermined zone, while maintaining the same level of heat generation. As a result, the flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in ,the<br>
predetermined zone can be decreased.	;<br>

i<br>
granular metallic iron is.manufactured by reducing a raw material<br>
mixture including an iron oxide-containing material and a<br>
carbonaceous reducing agent, comprises: a thermal reduction<br>
furnace for reducing iron oxide in the raw material mixture by<br>
the carbonaceous reducing agent through the application of heat,<br>

According to the apparatus of manufacturing the granular metallic iron of the present invention described above, since the flow.velocity of the atmospheric gas in the predetermined zone is lower than that of the apparatus without flow velocity control<br>
means, higher reduction degree of the atmosphere in the<br>
'I predetermined zone can be maintained so as to obtain a granular<br>
metallic iron of high quality. More specifically, granular<br>
metallic iron having higher C content and lower S content can be<br>
obtained.<br>
According to the apparatus for manufacturing the granular metallic iron of the present invention, the flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the predetermined zone is preferably in<a range from meters per second to on average and more preferably in a .></a>
 <br>
per second on average. This makes it possible to maintain the reduction degree of the. atmospheric gas at a high level in the predetermined zone so that reduction and carburization proceed efficiently, and therefore C content in the granular metallic iron can be increased and S content can be decreased.<br>
Also, according to the apparatus for manufacturing the<br>
granular metallic iron of the present invention, it is preferable<br>
that the predetermined zone is a zone from a last stage of reducing<br>
the iron oxide to completion of melting the metallic iron. This<br>
which makes it possible to obtain a granular metallic iron having<br>
a higher quality, as reduction degree of the atmosphere in the<br>
predetermined zone is kept at a higher level than that of the other<br>
zones.	:j<br>

burner in the case that the same quantity of fuel is burned in<br>
i the both burners, while the first burner is installed in the<br>
predetermined zone and the second burner is installed in;another<br>
!	-I<br>
zone or zones.  In this case, it is preferable that the first<br>
I* burner is an oxygen burner and the second burner is an air l-burner.<br>
[ I This makes it possible to decrease the total quantity 'of gas<br>
supplied into the thermal reduction furnace while maintaining the<br><br>
same level of. heat generation, compared to a case of -using air burners as some or all of the heating burners in the predetermined zone. As a result/ the flow velocity of the atmospheric gas in the predetermined zone can be decreased so as to obtain a granular metallic iron having higher C content and lower S content.<br>
Also, according to the apparatus for manufacturing the<br>
|i ii'<br>
granular metallic iron of the present invention, it is preferable that the first burner is installed at a position at least 1 meter away from the surface of the hearth.
