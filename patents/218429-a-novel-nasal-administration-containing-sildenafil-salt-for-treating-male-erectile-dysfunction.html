				<td>The present invention relates to a novel pharmaceutical composition containing sildenafil useful for nasal administration for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction due to organic, psychogenic and mixed causes. The composition is also particularly effective in patients with erectile dysfunction due to spinal cord injury. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be in the form of a solution or a colloidal dispersion in a pharmaceutical vehicle. The composition can be filled into specially designed dosing device for nasal administration.<br>
Sildenafil has the chemical formula C22H30N6O4S<br>
Sildenafil is potent and selective inhibitor of type V cyclic guanosine mono phosphodiestrase (cGMP) with utility for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction. Recently, it has been hypothesized that penile erections are dependent on nitric oxide (NO) and its second messenger CGMP. Sildenafil amplifies the neuronal nitric oxide (NO) / cGMP pathway implicated in the relaxation of the corpus cavernosum. The drug is well tolerated orally with headache, dyspepsia, facial flushing and muscular ache are the most common<br>
adverse events reported [Steers, W. D.  et al. 2nd Meet Eur. Soc. Impotence Res. (Oct 1-4,<br>
Madrid)i997, Abst 80]. It is administered orally at a dose of 25mg to 100mg. sildenafil treated patients have a significant improvement in sex life satisfaction rating compared   with the placebo groups [Terret et al. Bio Org.<br>
Med.Chem. Lett., 6(15), 1819-1824(1996); Boolell. et al. Br.J.Urol. 78(2),257-261(1996)].<br>
The pharmaceutical composition available in markets for oral administration contains sildenafil citrate (Manufactured by M/s Pfizer Inc.). Sildenafil citrate is soluble in dimethylformamide, sparingly soluble in acetic acid, slightly soluble in alcohol. About 3.5 mg is soluble in water.<br><br>
In JP 10298062 a pharmaceutical composition in the form of tablets that rapidly soluble in the oral cavity and manufacturing procedure has been disclosed.<br>
In WO 9830209 a rapidly releasing and taste masking pharmaceutical composition comprising a core containing sildenafil, an inner coating layer formed of a water soluble polymer and an outer coating layer formed on inner coating containing saliva insoluble polymer and a process for preparing such oral dosage form has been disclosed.<br>
In US patent, US 5,874,437 nitrosated and nitrosylated phosphodiestrase inhibitors having the formula NOn , where n = 1 or 2 and compositions comprising such compound in pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a method for treating male impotence in humans by administering the compounds and compositions thereof has been disclosed.<br>
With the development of various devices for application of drugs in the nasal cavity and the specialized anatomy and physiology of nasal cavity and its ready accessibility made the nasal cavity a particularly attractive delivery site for the systemic administration of drugs, since no injection is required, and first pass metabolism is circumvented.<br>
Although the permeability of nasal epithelium to drug molecules varies greatly depending on the chemical and physical properties of the drug, a number of strategies have been explored to increase the nasal membrane permeability. These include<br>
1)	increasing the residence time of the drug in the nasal mucosa.<br>
2)	increasing the blood flow to the nasal mucosa.<br><br>
3) modifying drug-membrane characteristic with surface active agents.<br>
No pharmaceutical composition containing sildenafil for nasal administration has been reported till date.<br>
The main objective of present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition containing sildenafil, for application in the nasal cavity which can elicit rapid onset of action at a reduced dose when compared to the oral dosage form available for treatment of male erectile dysfunction.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a method for preparing the pharmaceutical composition containing sildenafil for nasal application.<br>

The preferred dosage form is "Monospray", which is a unidose device supplied by M/s Valois, filled with single dose of medicament.<br>
The active substance in the pharmaceutical composition sildenafil may be present as a base or its salt form with organic acids such as citric acid, lactic<br><br>
acid, acetic acid and the like or inorganic acids such as sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, orthophosphoric acid etc.<br>
The amount of sildenafil or its salt present in the pharmaceutical composition may range from 2.5 to 25.0 percent, preferably 5.0 to 20.0 percent more preferably 7.5 to 15.0 percent. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention contains sildenafil or its salt in the form of a liquid solution or colloidal dispersion in a suitable inert pharmaceutical vehicle.<br>
The pharmaceutical vehicle comprises of a solvent in which sildenafil is dissolved or dispersed, a co-solvent and / or solubilising agent which aids in dissolving sildenafil, a penetration enhancer for improving the penetration of sildenafil through the barriers in nasal mucosa, a stabilizing agent to prevent degradation of sildenafil and a buffering agent to adjust pH of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The poor solubility of sildenafil in water alone necessitates the use of other solvents, co-solvents and / or solubilising agets to dissolve it in the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The solvents used in the pharmaceutical composition may be selected from a group of "Protogenic" solvents, which act as proton donors, such as liquid hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, lactic acid, solutions of ascorbic acid, citric acid. The volume of such solvents and co-solvents present in the pharmaceutical composition may range from 10.0 to 80.0 percent, preferably 20.0 to 60.0 percent.<br><br>
The co-solvents used in the pharmaceutical composition may be selected from a group of "Amphiprotic" solvents, which act as both proton acceptors and proton donors, such as the alcohols ethyl alcohol, propylene glycol, glycerol and polyethylene glycols having a nominal molecular weight of 200 - 600 or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, which enhances the solubility of sildenafil or its salts byformation of complex. The volume of such co-solvents and co-solvents present in the pharmaceutical composition may range from 4.0 to 40.0 percent, preferably 15.0 to 30.0 percent.<br>
The solubilising agent used in the pharmaceutical composition may be selected from surface-active agents such as polysorbate 80, polymers which can form molecular adducts and have anti-nucleating properties such as poloxamers, polyvinylpyrrolidone. The amount of such solubilising agent present in the pharmaceutical composition may range from 1.0 to 30.0 percent, preferably 5.0 to 15.0 percent.<br>
The buffering agent used in the pharmaceutical composition may be selected from hydrochloric acid, sodium acetate, glacial acetic acid, orthophosphoric acid, potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate, sodium hydroxide and the like.<br>
The penetration enhancers for intranasal application known in the art are ethyl alcohol, propylene glycol, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, bile salts, cyclodextrins etc. The penetration enhancers used in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is selected from among these and the amount present in each ml of the composition may range from 10.0 to 30.0 percent, preferably 15.0 to 25.0 percent.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical substances used as stabilizing agents, known in the art are disodium ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, ascorbic acid etc. The stabilizing agent used in the pharmaceutical composition for stabilisation of sildenafil may be selected from among these substances. The amount of such stabilizing agents present in the composition may range from 0.01 to 0.1 percent.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may optionally contain anti-microbial preservative. The anti-microbial agent may be selected from benzalkonium chloride, phenyl mercuric acetate, phenylethyl alcohol and the like. The amount of such anti-microbial preservative may range from 0.02 to 0.5 percent.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may optionally contain a viscosity building agent to increase the viscosity of the composition, thereby prolongs the contact time of the composition with the nasal mucosa, preventing its rapid drain to the larynx region of throat. The viscosity building agent may be selected from hydrocollids such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, poly acrylic acid and the like or water soluble polymers such as carbopol, sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose etc. The amount of such viscosity building agent used in the pharmaceutical composition may range from 1.0 to 5.0 percent.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition is prepared by dissolving or dispersing sildenafil or its salt in the pharmaceutical vehicle comprising of solvent, co-solvent and / or solubilising agent, penetration enhancer along with other optional ingredients. The pH of the pharmaceutical composition is adjusted using a buffering agent. The pharmaceutical composition is then filled in either a multiple dose container fitted with a mechanical pump and a nasal<br><br>
applicator with an over cap or a "Monospray"(supplied by M/s Valois) nasal liquid unidose device. The preferred device is "Monospray".<br>
The "Monospray" is a nasal liquid unidose device useful in administrating high potency molecules enabling less frequent administration and treatment of crisis conditions. The device comprises an actuator with over cap, spring, piston, dosage chamber and a ball for closing the dosage chamber rear end after filling with medicine. A "Monospray" with a nominal volume of the dosage chamber in between 50.0 to 150.0 microlitres is selected to deliver 2.5 to 37.5mg, preferably 5.0 to 25.0mg, more preferably 7.5 to 15.0 mg of sildenafil.<br>

The present invention relates to an improved pharmaceutical composition containing sildenafil intended for nasal administration for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction due to organic, psychogenic and mixed causes. The composition is also particularly effective in patients with erectile dysfunction due to spinal cord injury. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be in the form of a solution or a colloidal dispersion in a pharmaceutical vehicle. The composition can be filled into specially designed dosing device for nasal administration.<br>

Headache, dyspepsia, facial flushing and muscular ache are the common adverse events reported [Steers, W. D. et al. 2nd Meet Eur. Soc. Impotence Res. (Oct 1-4, Madrid) 1997, Abst 80]. It is administered orally at a dose of 25mg to lOOmg. Sildenafil treated patients have a significant improvement in sex life satisfaction rating compared with the placebo groups [Terret et al. Bio Org. Med.Chem. Lett., 6(15),1819-1824(1996); Boolell. et al. Br.J.Urol. 78(2),257-261(1996)].<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions available in the markets for oral administration contains sildenafil citrate (M/s Pfizer Inc.). Sildenafil citrate is soluble in dimethylformamide, sparingly soluble in acetic acid, slightly soluble in alcohol. About 3.5 mg is soluble in water.<br>
In JP 10298062 a pharmaceutical composition in the form of tablets that rapidly soluble in the oral cavity and manufacturing procedure has been disclosed.<br>
In WO 9830209 a rapidly releasing and taste masking pharmaceutical composition comprising a core containing Sildenafil, an inner coating layer formed of a water soluble polymer and an outer coating layer formed on inner coating containing saliva insoluble polymer and a process for preparing such oral dosage form has been disclosed.<br>
According to the above patents sildenafil is administered orally about one hour before intercourse. This is a major disadvantage of the oral formulations, creating in convenience to the partners. Rapid onset of action is highly desirable in such therapeutic indication for patients. Considering the above parameters an<br><br>
attempt has been made to develop an intranasal formulation containing sildenafil citrate or base in a solution form which possesses rapid onset of action at a reduced dose when compare to the oral dosage form available for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction.<br>
With the development of various devices for application of drugs in the nasal cavity and the specialized anatomy and physiology of nasal cavity and its ready accessibility made the nasal cavity a particularly attractive delivery site for the systemic administration of drugs, since no injection is required, and first pass metabolism is circumvented.<br>
Although the permeability of nasal epithelium to drug molecules varies greatly depending on the physicochemical properties of the drug, a number of strategies have been explored to increase the nasal membrane permeability. These include<br>
1)	increasing the residence time of the drug in the nasal mucosa.<br>
2)	increasing the blood flow to the nasal mucosa.<br>
3)	modifying drug-membrane characteristic with surface-active agents.<br>
In US patent, US 5,874,437 nitrosated and nitrosylated phosphodiestrase inhibitors having the formula NOn , where n = 1 or 2 and compositions comprising such compound in pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a method for treating male impotence in humans by administering the compounds and compositions thereof has been disclosed.<br>
In WO 00/00199 an intranasal dosage unit of cyclic guanosine monophosphate specific phosphodiesterase inhibitors are described which are combined with suitable intranasal carriers having a buffer, surfactant and absorption enhancers, in order to achieve a peak plasma concentration of the inhibitor in less than 1 hour, and desirably with in 30 minutes of administration in mammals. In this active ingredient is dispersed in a buffer followed by thickening agent, humectant and surfactant are added.<br>
However the disadvantage associated with this type of suspension formulations is that the dispersed drug particles in the viscous medium may have to over come the resistance caused by the medium to reach onto the surface of the mucous membrane for its dissolution and penetration through the membrane. Further the drug is in solid state with less fluid volume and surface area made available for dissolution and penetration that reduces the absorption of drug compared to solution. The dispersion system may delay onset of action initially, though it prolongs the duration of action due to slow penetration. The delay in the onset of action may cause patient incompliance. Further, the limited<br><br>
solubility of the sildenafil citrate may leads to improper dosing of the formulation.<br>
In EP 0967214 intranasal formulations of Sildenafil mesylate together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction or female sexual disorders are described. In this, sildenafil free base is added to an aqueous solution of methane sulfonic acid and solubility enhancer (Caffeine) and a buffer are added. Similarly compositions are prepared using nicotinamide, vanillin or benzyl alcohol instead of caffeine as penetration enhancers.<br>
However, the above process in making the solution involves the conversion of sildenafil into mesylate followed by solubilising the mesylate salt. This process involves conversion of sildenafil to mesylate salt, which is tedious and time consuming.<br>
The above patent also claimed an intranasal powder formulation by using sildenafil mesylate and lactose. The composition was milled to an average particles of 20 microns size and filled into a gelatin capsule for use with a commercial nasal device. Inhalation of this powder may cause irritation to the mucous membrane, and absorption of the active ingredient is slow compared to the solution form as described above.<br>
In WO 9966933 a method for rapidly and reliably delivering sildenafil to the systemic circulation of a patient intranasally in a pharmaceutical composition contained sildenafil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salts and carrier was disclosed. According to this method sildenafil citrate was dissolved with the help of mesylic acid and the pH adjusted to 2.8 to 3.0 with sodium hydroxide. It has also disclosed a "sildenafil nasal spray solution" containing sildenafil hydrochloride dissolved in phosphate buffer and isotonicity adjusted with sodium chloride.<br>
It also discloses an "aqueous nasal gel" which contains sildenafil hydrochloride, methocel and an acetate buffer. It has also disclosed a composite nasal spray solution containing sildenafil hydrochloride, and apomorphine hydrochloride.<br>
Considering the importance attached to removal of the drawbacks/disadvantages of the presently available composition containing sildenafil we undertook research work towards developing an improved composition which can be administered through nasal route wherein the active drug gets rapidly absorbed.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved pharmaceutical composition intended for nasal administration for the treatment<br><br>
of male erectile dysfunction due to organic, pyschogenic and mixed causes containing sildenafil for nasal application.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved pharmaceutical composition in the form of a solution or colloidal dispersion intended for nasal administration for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction due to organic, psychogenic and mixed causes containing sildenafil for nasal application in a suitable pharmaceutical vehicle, comprising of a solvent, co-solvent and / or solubilizing agent, penetration enhancer, stabilising agent, buffering agent, and a tonicity agent; optionally contain an anti-microbial agent and / or viscosity modifying agents.<br>
Still another objective of the invention is to provide a method for preparing the improved pharmaceutical composition containing sildenafil in the form of a solution or colloidal dispersion intended for nasal administration for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction due to organic, psychogenic and mixed causes.<br>
The present invention is based on our finding that the poorly water soluble sildenafil or its salt, dissolves completely in mild acids such as lactic acid, hydrochloric acid, ascorbic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, orthophosphoric acid or methyl sulfonic acid and the resulting solution when mixed with solubilisers and penetration enhancers such as polyethyleneglycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, ethyl alcohol, purified diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, propyleneglycol monolaurate and the pH is adjusted 3.0 to 8.0 with citrate, acetate or phosphate buffer and tonicity is adjusted with sodium chloride or dextrose or mannitol, the resulting composition acquires unique property of promoting rapid absorption of sildenafil resulting in rapid onset of action when administered through the nasal route due to synergistic activities of the above said components. It was noticed that the free base of sildenafil is preferably more soluble in ascorbic acid and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether.<br>
We have further noted that lactic acid, is more preferable as it is highly biocompatible and is present in organs such as lever, kidney, thymus gland, stratum coraeum, human amniotic fluid and other organs and body fluids.<br>
The above said pharmaceutical composition has rapid onset of action upon administration through nasal route with out any adverse effects due to the synergistic effect of the ingredients employed in the composition which results in keeping the active ingredient namely sildenafil or its salt in solution or dispersion form and absorption is further promoted by penetration enhancers making it absorb readily when the composition is administered through the nasal route for eliciting the desired therapeutic response.<br><br>
The above said composition can be filled into a suitable container fitted with nasal applicator. The composition can be filled either in multiple dose container fitted with an applicator or "Monospray" (supplied by M/s Valois India Pvt, Ltd., 407, Madhava,Bandra-kurla Complex, Bondra(E), Mumbai- 400 051), filled with single dose of medicament.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved pharmaceutical composition intended for nasal administration for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction due to organic, psychogenic and mixed causes in the form of solution or colloidal dispersion, which comprises solution or colloidal dispersion of Sildenafil or its salt in a "Protogenic" solvent containing solubilisers and penetration enhancers, stabilizing agent, buffering agents and an isotonicity agent, the solution or the dispersion having a pH in the range of 3.0 to 8.0.<br>
The solution or the dispersion is stable at room temperature and sub ambient temperatures as well without any precipitation and/or re-crystallisation. The composition is not a mere admixture of the ingredients employed resulting in a composition having the aggregate properties of the said ingredients. The composition in solution form is preferred to the dispersion form as the former has more rapid absorption and onset of action than that of a dispersion form.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition so formed is then filled in either a multiple dose containers fitted with a mechanical pump and a nasal applicator with an over cap or a "Monospray" (supplied by M/s Valois India Pvt., Ltd., 407, Madhava, Bandra-kurla Complex, Bondra(E), Mumbai- 400 051), nasal liquid unidose device.
