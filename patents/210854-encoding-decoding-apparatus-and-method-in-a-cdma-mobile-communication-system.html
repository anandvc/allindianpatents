				<td>ENCODING/DECODING APPARATUS AND METHOD IN A CDMA MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to an encoding/decoding apparatus and method in a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) mobile communication system, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for transmitting a reverse rate indicator channel (R-RICH) used in a synchronous mobile communication system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, a reverse supplemental channel (R-SCH) fundamentally supports a variable rate transmission scheme. In the 'Variable rate transmission scheme", a mobile station varies its transmission rate arbitrarily. Generally, a change in a data rate causes a change in a code rate of error correcting codes used in constructing a frame, a symbol repetition frequency, and a length and type of Walsh codes for spreading. Therefore, the mobile station should inform a base station of a data rate of the currently transmitted reverse supplemental channel, so that a base station receiver can correctly receive the reverse supplemental channel. A channel defined for this use is called a reverse rate indicator channel (R-RICH).<br>
The number of kinds of data rates that can be transmitted by the mobile station over the reverse supplemental channel depends upon the number of reverse supplemental channels that can be simultaneously used by the mobile station. The number of the reverse supplemental channels is determined by the base station considering an amount of data to be transmitted over a reverse link during call setup, and then reported to the mobile station. Therefore, the number of information bits transmitted over the reverse rate indictor channel varies depending on the number of the reverse supplemental channels. That is, when the number of the reverse supplemental channels is 1, the mobile station informs a reverse data rate using 4 bits. Further, when the number of the reverse supplemental channels is 2, the mobile station informs the reverse data rate using 7 bits. Since the number of the reverse supplemental channels that can be simultaneously used by the mobile station cannot be changed until a separate<br>
command is received from the base station, the mobile station transmits either 4-bit information or 7-bit information over the reverse rate indicator channel. That is, the mobile station will never transmit both the 4-bit information and the 7-bit information at the same time. Conventionally, a (24,4) or (24,7) code is defined as an error correcting code to be used in the reverse rate indicator channel.<br>
A disadvantage of the reverse rate indicator channel (R-RICH) lies in that the number of bits transmitted for transmission of the reverse rates depends upon only the number of the reverse supplemental channels. That is, the number of different data rates that can be transmitted by the mobile station over the reverse supplemental channel is not considered in determining the number of bits transmitted over the reverse supplemental channel. When the number of the transmission bits is determined regardless of the number of different data rates that can be transmitted by the mobile station over the reverse supplemental channel, the mobile station may transmit more bits than actually required bits. For example, when the number of reverse supplemental channels is 1 and the number of different (or "kinds of) data rates that can be transmitted by the mobile station over the reverse supplemental channel is 4, the minimum number of bits needed for transmitting the data rates is 2. However, in the prior art, when the number of the reverse supplemental channels is 1, the minimum number of the bits required for transmitting the data rates is 4.<br>
In the conventional method in which the number of bits to be transmitted over the reverse rate indicator channel depends upon the number of the reverse supplemental channels, the number of the bits transmitted over the reverse rate indicator channel is larger than needed. Transmitting unnecessarily large number of the bits over the reverse rate indicator channel causes an increase in a code rate of an encoder, making it difficult to apply an optimal encoding method.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a structure of an R-RICH transmitter. Referring to FIG. 1, an encoder 100 encodes a 4-bit or 7-bit input rate indicator and outputs 24 coded symbols. A symbol repeater 110 repeats 16 times the 24 coded symbols provided from the encoder 100. A signal mapper 120 performs signal mapping on the coded symbols output from the symbol repeater 110 by mapping 0 to 1 and 1 to -1. A spreader 130 spreads the signal-mapped symbols.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, the rate indicator has 4 bits or 7 bits, and encoded into 24 coded symbols before transmission. When errors occur during<br>
transmission of the rate indicator encoded into the coded symbols, the rate indicator may incorrectly indicate the code rate of the corresponding reverse supplemental channel, the symbol repetition frequency, and the length and type of the spread Walsh code. As a result, the receiver cannot correctly analyze the reverse supplemental channel. Therefore, the rate indicator should be encoded by a (24,4) or (24,7) encoder having good performance. In addition, the rate indicator should be decoded as fast as possible in order to analyze the corresponding supplemental channel.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
In general, Hamming distance distribution for codewords of the error correcting codes serve as a measure indicating the performance of linear error correcting codes. The "Hamming distance" indicates the number of non-zero symbols in a codeword. That is, for a certain codeword '0111', the number of 1's included in the codeword is 3, so the Hamming distance is 3. The least value among the Hamming distance values is called a "minimum distance d^", and an increase in the minimum distance of the codeword improves the error correcting performance of the error correcting codes. In other words, the "optimal code" means a code having the optimal error correcting performance. This is disclosed in detail in a paper, The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes, F.J.Macwilliams, N.J.A. Sloane, North-Holland. In addition, a paper, An Updated Table of Minimum-Distance Bounds for Binary Linear Codes (A.E. Brouwer and Tom Verhoeff, IEEE Transactions on information Theory, VOL 39, NO. 2, MARCH 1993), discloses an intercode minimum distance, which depends on the input and output values of the binary linear codes for the optimal code.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a structure of an R-RICH transmitter for minimizing the number of bits assigned to a rate indicator according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 10, an encoder 1200 encodes a k-bit rate indicator and outputs a coded symbol stream comprised of 24 coded symbols. The number k of the bits assigned to the rate indicator is determined depending on the number of kinds of the data rates that can be transmitted by the mobile station over the reverse supplemental channel. The encoder 1200 serves as one of (24,1) encoder, (24,2) encoder, (24,3) encoder, (24,4) encoder, (24,5) encoder, (24,6) encoder and (24,7) encoder depending on the number k of input bits. A symbol repeater 1210 repeats 16 times the 24 coded symbols provided from the encoder 1200. A signal mapper 1220 performs signal mapping on the coded symbols output from the symbol repeater 1210 by mapping 0 to 1 and 1 to -1. A spreader 1230 spreads the signal-mapped symbols.<br>
As stated above, minimizing the number of bits assigned to the rate indicator causes a decrease in a code rate of the encoder, thereby improving performance of the rate indicator channel.<br>
The encoder for encoding the rate indicator channel includes (24,1) encoder, (24,2) encoder, (24,3) encoder, (24,4) encoder, (24,5) encoder, (24,6) encoder and (24,7) encoder. According to the above-stated paper, an optimal (24,1) linear encoder with 1 input bit and 24 output bits has a maximum distance 24; an optimal (24,2) linear encoder with 2 input bits and 24 output bits has a maximum distance 16; an optimal (24,3) linear encoder with 3 input bits and 24 output bits has a maximum distance 13; an optimal (24,4) linear encoder with 4 input bits and 24 output bits has a maximum distance 12; an optimal (24,5) linear encoder with 5 input bits and 24 output bits has a maximum distance 12; an optimal (24,6) linear encoder with 6 input bits and 24 output bits has a maximum distance 10; and an optimal (24,7) linear encoder with 7 input bits and 24 output bits has a maximum distance 10.<br>
The (24,1) encoder to the (24,7) encoder for encoding the rate indicator will be described in turn.<br>
1. (24.1) Encoder<br>
The (24,1) encoder provided by the invention is constructed to generate an optimal (24,1) code by repeating a (2,1) Reed-Muller code 32 times and then puncturing 40 symbols from the repeated code. Although there are many ways to create the (24,1) code, it is possible not only to minimize hardware complexity but also to create an optimal codeword in terms of error correcting performance by utilizing a method of puncturing a first order Reed-Muller code according to an embodiment of the present invention. It will be assumed that the embodiment of the present invention generates the error correcting codes using the Reed-Muller code. Also, it is possible to minimize the hardware complexity by minimizing a length of the Reed-Muller code before puncturing.<br>
The (24,1) encoder outputs coded symbols of length 24 by repeating 32 times 2 coded symbols output from a (2,1) Reed-Muller code generator and then puncturing 40 symbols from the repeated coded symbols. A change in the puncturing positions where the 40 symbols are punctured from the repeated coded symbols of length 64 causes a change in the minimum distance dmin of the codeword. Therefore, in order to make a (24,1) encoder with excellent error<br>
correcting performance in the coded symbols of length 64, it is important to calculate the puncturing positions where the largest minimum distance can be obtained.<br>
The simplest puncturing pattern for the 40 puncturing positions needed to generate an optimal (24,1) linear code is {even-numbered puncturing positions and positions 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15}. In this case, a transmitter and a receiver of the mobile communication system transmitting the 1 information bit using the encoding/decoding method according to the present invention previously exchange or otherwise pre-store the 40 puncturing positions. The puncturing positions are generally defined in a communication protocol. Alternatively, the transmitter may previously provide information on the puncturing positions.<br>
With reference to FIG. 11, a method for encoding an optimal (24,1) code according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described. FIG. 11 illustrates a structure of an encoder included in a transmitter according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 11, one input information bit aO is applied to a (2,1) Reed-Muller encoder 1300. Here, the input information bit aO constitutes a rate indicator. The Reed-Muller encoder 1300 encodes the input information bit aO and outputs coded symbols of length 2 (or a coded symbol stream). The coded symbols constitute a Reed-Muller code. The 2 coded symbols are provided to a repeater 1310. The repeater 1310 outputs 64 coded symbols by repeating the received 2 coded symbols 32 times. Upon receiving the 64 coded symbols, a puncturer 1320 punctures coded symbols in the 40 optimal puncturing positions from the received 64 coded symbols, and outputs coded symbols of length 24. The puncturer 1320 punctures the even-numbered symbols and the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th symbols in the above-stated 40 optimal puncturing positions from the received 64 coded symbols, and then outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
A general code theory defines a generating matrix in order to show a mapping relation between the input information and the coded symbols. When the symbol repetition and puncturing are included, a generating matrix for a final (24,1) encoder is represented by<br>
Equation 1<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The generating matrix of Equation 1 selects 24 symbols in a first row if the 1-bit input signal is 1, and selects no symbol if the 1-bit input signal is 0. When no symbol is selected, the symbol stream is comprised of 24 O's.<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates a (24,1) encoder based on the above generating matrix. Referring to FIG. 12, an input information bit aO having a value of 0 or 1 is applied to a multiplier 1410. At the same time, a signal generator 1400 outputs one symbol stream constituting the generating matrix, stored in a memory. That is, the signal generator 1400 stores a symbol stream R1=1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 of length 24 corresponding to the generating matrix in the memory, and provides the stored symbol stream Rl to the multiplier 1410. The multiplier 1410 then multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream Rl by the input information bit aO, and outputs a coded symbol stream of length 24.<br>
2. (24.2) Encoder<br>
The (24,2) encoder provided by the invention is constructed to generate an optimal (24,2) code by repeating a (4,2) Reed-Muller code 8 times and then puncturing 8 symbols from the repeated code. Although there are many ways to create the (24,2) code, it is possible not only to minimize hardware complexity but also to create an optimal codeword in terms of error correcting performance by utilizing a method of puncturing a first order Reed-Muller code according to an embodiment of the present invention. It will be assumed that the embodiment of the present invention generates the error correcting codes using the Reed-Muller code. Also, it is possible to minimize the hardware complexity by minimizing a length of the Reed-Muller code before puncturing.<br>
The (24,2) encoder outputs coded symbols of length 24 by repeating 8 times 4 coded symbols output from a (4,2) Reed-Muller code generator and then puncturing 8 symbols from the repeated coded symbols. A change in the puncturing positions where the 8 symbols are punctured from the repeated coded symbols of length 32 causes a change in the minimum distance dmin of the codeword. Therefore, in order to make a (24,2) encoder with excellent error correcting performance in the coded symbols of length 32, it is important to calculate the puncturing positions where the largest minimum distance can be obtained.<br>
The simplest puncturing pattern for the 8 puncturing positions needed to generate an optimal (24,2) linear code is {0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28}. In this case, a<br>
transmitter and a receiver of the mobile communication system transmitting 2 information bits using the encoding/decoding method according to the present invention previously exchange or otherwise pre-store the 8 puncturing positions. The puncturing positions are generally defined in a communication protocol. Alternatively, the transmitter may previously provide information on the puncturing positions.<br>
With reference to FIG. 13, a method for encoding an optimal (24,2) code according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described. FIG. 13 illustrates a structure of an encoder included in a transmitter according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 13, 2 input information bits aO and al are applied to a (4,2) Reed-Muller encoder 1500. Here, the input information bits aO and al constitute a rate indicator. The Reed-Muller encoder 1500 encodes the input information bits aO and al, and outputs coded symbols of length 4 (or a coded symbol stream). The coded symbols constitute a Reed-Muller code. The 4 coded symbols are provided to a repeater 1510. The repeater 1510 outputs 32 coded symbols by repeating 8 times the received coded symbols of length 4. Upon receiving the 32 coded symbols, a puncturer 1520 punctures Olh, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th symbols in the 8 optimal puncturing positions from the 32 coded symbols, and thus outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
A general code theory defines a generating matrix in order to show a mapping relation between the input information and the coded symbols. When the symbol repetition and puncturing are included, a generating matrix for a final (24,2) encoder is represented by<br>
Equation 2<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The generating matrix of Equation 2 selects 24 symbols in a first row if the first input information bit of the 2 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbol if the first input information bit is 0. The generating matrix selects 24 symbols in a second row if the second input information bit of the 2 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbols if the second input information bit is 0. A coded symbol stream for the input information bits is generated by XORing all the selected streams in a symbol unit.<br>
FIG. 14 illustrates a (24,2) encoder based on the above generating matrix. Referring to FIG. 14, of the input information bits aO and al having a value of 0 or 1, the input information bit aO is applied to a multiplier 1620, and the input information bit al is applied to a multiplier 1622, respectively. At the same time, a signal generator 1600 provides two symbol streams constituting the generating matrix, stored in a memory, to the associated multipliers. That is, the signal generator 1600 stores a symbol stream Rl=101 101 101 101 101 101 101 101 of length 24 corresponding to the first row of the generating matrix in the memory, and provides the stored symbol stream Rl to the multiplier 1620. Further, the signal generator 1600 stores a symbol stream R2=011 Oil Oil Oil Oil Oil Oil 011 of length 24 corresponding to the second row of the generating matrix in the memory, and provides the stored symbol stream R2 to the multiplier 1622. The multiplier 1620 then multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream Rl by the input information bit aO, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to an XOR operator 1640. Further, the multiplier 1622 multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream R2 by the input information bit al, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to the XOR operator 1640. The XOR operator 1640 then XORs the received 2 symbol streams of length 24 in a symbol unit, and outputs a coded symbol stream of length 24.<br>
3. (24,3) Encoder<br>
The (24,3) encoder provided by the invention is constructed to generate an optimal (24,3) code by repeating a (8,3) Reed-Muller code 4 times and then puncturing 8 symbols from the repeated code. Although there are many ways to create the (24,3) code, it is possible not only to minimize hardware complexity but also to create an optimal codeword in terms of error correcting performance by utilizing a method of puncturing a first order Reed-Muller code according to an embodiment of the present invention. It will be assumed that the embodiment of the present invention generates the error correcting codes using the Reed-Muller code. Also, it is possible to minimize the hardware complexity by minimizing a length of the Reed-Muller code before puncturing.<br>
The (24,3) encoder outputs coded symbols of length 24 by repeating 4 times 8 coded symbols output from a (8,3) Reed-Muller code generator and then puncturing 8 symbols from the repeated coded symbols. A change in the puncturing positions where the 8 symbols are punctured from the coded symbols of length 32 causes a change in the minimum distance dmjn of the codeword. Therefore, in order to make a (24,3) encoder with excellent error correcting<br>
performance in the coded symbols of length 32, it is important to calculate the puncturing positions where the largest minimum distance can be obtained.<br>
The simplest puncturing pattern for the 8 puncturing positions needed to generate an optimal (24,3) linear code is {0,3,5,6,7,8,16,24}. In this case, a transmitter and a receiver of the mobile communication system transmitting 3 information bits using the encoding/decoding method according to the present invention previously exhange or otherwise pre-store the 8 puncturing positions. The puncturing positions are generally defined in a communication protocol. Alternatively, the transmitter may previously provide information on the puncturing positions.<br>
With reference to FIG. 15, a method for encoding an optimal (24,3) code according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described. FIG. 15 illustrates a structure of an encoder included in a transmitter according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 15, 3 input information bits aO, al and a2 are applied to a (8,3) Reed-Muller encoder 1700. Here, the input information bits aO, al and a2 constitute a rate indicator. The Reed-Muller encoder 1700 encodes the input information bits aO, al, and a2, and outputs coded symbols of length 8 (or a coded symbol stream). The coded symbols constitute a Reed-Muller code. The 8 coded symbols are provided to a repeater 1710. The repeater 1710 outputs 32 coded symbols by repeating 4 times the received coded symbols of length 8. Upon receiving the 32 coded symbols, a puncturer 1720 punctures 0th, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 16th and 24th symbols in the 8 optimal puncturing positions from the 32 coded symbols, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
A general code theory defines a generating matrix in order to show a mapping relation between the input information and the coded symbols. When the symbol repetition and puncturing are included, a generating matrix for a final (24,3) encoder is represented by<br>
Equation 3<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The generating matrix of Equation 3 selects 24 symbols in a first row if<br>
the first input information bit among the 3 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbol if the first input information bit is 0. The generating matrix selects 24 symbols in a second row if the second input information bit among the 3 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbols if the second input information bit is 0. Further, the generating matrix selects 24 symbols in a third row if the third input information bit among the 3 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbols if the third input information bit is 0. A coded symbol stream for the input information bits is generated by XORing all the selected streams in a symbol unit.<br>
FIG. 16 illustrates a (24,3) encoder based on the above generating matrix.<br>
Referring to FIG. 16, of the input information bits aO, al, and a2 having a value<br>
of 0 or 1, the input information bit aO is applied to a multiplier 1820, the input<br>
information bit al is applied to a multiplier 1822, and the input information bit a2<br>
is applied to a multiplier 1824, respectively. At the same time, a signal generator<br>
1800 provides three symbol streams constituting the generating matrix, stored in<br>
a memory, to the associated multipliers. That is, the signal generator 1800 stores<br>
a  symbol   stream  Rl=100   101   0101   101   0101   101   0101   of length  24<br>
corresponding to the first row of the generating matrix in the memory, and<br>
provides the stored  symbol stream  Rl   to the multiplier   1820.  The  signal<br>
generator 1800 stores a symbol stream R2=010 Oil 0011 Oil 0011 Oil 0011 of<br>
length 24 corresponding to the second row of the generating matrix in the<br>
memory, and provides the stored symbol stream R2 to the multiplier 1822.<br>
Further, the signal generator 1800 stores a symbol stream R3=001 000 1111 000<br>
1111 000 1111 of length 24 corresponding to the third row of the generating<br>
matrix in the memory, and provides the stored symbol stream R3 to the multiplier<br>
1824. The multiplier 1820 then multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream Rl<br>
by the input information bit aO, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to an<br>
XOR operator 1840. The multiplier 1822 multiplies the symbols of the symbol<br>
stream R2 by the input information bit al, and outputs a symbol stream of length<br>
24 to the XOR operator 1840. Further, the multiplier 1824 multiplies the symbols<br>
of the symbol stream R3 by the input information bit a2, and outputs a symbol<br>
stream of length 24 to the XOR operator 1840. The XOR operator 1840 then<br>
XORs the received 3 symbol streams of length 24 in a symbol unit, and outputs a<br>
coded symbol stream of length 24.<br>

an optimal (24,4) code by repeating a (16,4) Reed-Muller code 4 times and then puncturing 8 symbols from the repeated code. Although there are many ways to create the (24,4) code, it is possible not only to minimize hardware complexity but also to create an optimal codeword in terms of error correcting performance by utilizing a method of puncturing a first order Reed-Muller code according to an embodiment of the present invention. Also, it is possible to minimize the hardware complexity by minimizing a length of the Reed-Muller code before puncturing. It will be assumed that the embodiment of the present invention generates the error correcting codes using the Reed-Muller code.<br>
The (24,4) encoder outputs coded symbols of length 24 by repeating twice 16 coded symbols output from a (16,4) Reed-Muller code generator and then puncturing 8 symbols from the repeated coded symbols. A change in the puncturing positions where the 8 symbols are punctured from the coded symbols of length 32 causes a change in the minimum distance dmin of the codeword. Therefore, in order to make a (24,4) encoder with excellent error correcting performance in the coded symbols of length 32, it is important to calculate the puncturing positions where the largest minimum distance can be obtained.<br>
The simplest puncturing pattern for the 8 puncturing positions needed to generate an optimal (24,4) linear code is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,16}. In this case, a transmitter and a receiver of the mobile communication system transmitting 4 information bits using the encoding/decoding method according to the present invention should previously agree on the 8 puncturing positions. The puncturing positions are generally defined in a communication protocol. Alternatively, the transmitter may previously provide information on the puncturing positions.<br>
With reference to FIG. 2, a method for encoding an optimal (24,4) code according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described. FIG. 2 illustrates a structure of an encoder included in a transmitter according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, 4 input information bits aO, al, a2 and a3 are applied to a (16,4) Reed-Muller encoder 200. Here, the input information bits aO, al, a2 and a3 constitute a rate indicator. The Reed-Muller encoder 200 encodes the input information bits aO, al, a2 and a3, and outputs coded symbols of length 16 (or a coded symbol stream). The coded symbols constitute a Reed-Muller code. The 16 coded symbols are provided to a repeater 210. The repeater 210 outputs 32 coded symbols by repeating twice the received coded symbols of length 16. Upon receiving the 32 coded symbols, a<br>
puncturer 220 punctures Olh, 1st, 2nd 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 16th symbols in the 8 optimal puncturing positions from the 32 coded symbols, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
A general code theory defines a generating matrix in order to show a mapping relation between the input information and the coded symbols. When the symbol repetition and puncturing are included, a generating matrix for a final (24,4) encoder is represented by<br>
Equation 4<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The generating matrix of Equation 4 selects 24 symbols in a first row if the first input information bit among the 4 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbol if the first input information bit is 0. The generating matrix selects 24 symbols in a second row if the second input information bit among the 4 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbols if the second input information bit is 0. The generating matrix selects 24 symbols in a third row if the third input information bit among the 4 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbols if the third input information bit is 0. Further, the generating matrix selects 24 symbols in a fourth row if the fourth input information bit among the 4 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbols if the fourth input information bit is 0. A coded symbol stream for the input information bits is generated by XORing all the selected streams in a symbol unit.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a (24,4) encoder based on the above generating matrix. Referring to FIG. 7, of the input information bits aO-a3 having a value of 0 or 1, the input information bit aO is applied to a multiplier 920, the input information bit al is applied to a multiplier 922, the input information bit a2 is applied to a multiplier 924, and the input information bit a3 is applied to a multiplier 926, respectively. At the same time, a signal generator 900 provides 4 symbol streams R1-R4 constituting the generating matrix, stored in a memory, to the multipliers 920-926, respectively. To be specific, the signal generator 900 reads a symbol stream Rl=1010 1010 1101 0101 0101 0101 of length 24 corresponding to the first row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read<br>
symbol stream Rl to the multiplier 920. The signal generator 900 reads a length-24 symbol stream R2=1001 1001  1011 0011 0011 0011 corresponding to the second row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R2 to the multiplier 922. The signal generator 900 reads a length-24 symbol stream R3=1000 0111 1000 1111 0000 1111 corresponding to the third row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R3 to the multiplier 924. Finally, the signal generator 900 reads a length-24 symbol stream R4=0111  1111 1000 0000 1111  1111 corresponding to the fourth row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R4 to the multiplier 926. Then, the multiplier 920 multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream Rl by the input information bit aO, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to an XOR operator 940. The multiplier 922 multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream R2 by the input information bit al, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to the XOR operator 940. The multiplier 924 multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream R3 by the input information bit a2, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to the XOR operator 940. The multiplier 926 multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream R4 by the input information bit a3, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to the XOR operator 940. The XOR operator 940 then XORs the 4 symbol streams of length 24 in a symbol unit, and outputs a coded symbol stream of length 24.<br>

The (24,5) encoder provided by the invention is constructed to generate an optimal (24,5) code by puncturing 8 symbols from a (32,5) first order Reed-Muller code. Although there are many ways to create the (24,5) code, it is possible not only to minimize hardware complexity but also to create an optimal codeword in terms of error correcting performance by utilizing a method of puncturing a first order Reed-Muller code according to an embodiment of the present invention. It will be assumed that the embodiment of the present invention generates the error correcting codes using the Reed-Muller code. Also, it is possible to minimize the hardware complexity by minimizing a length of the Reed-Muller code before puncturing.<br>
The (24,5) encoder outputs coded symbols of length 24 by outputting 32 coded symbols generated by a (32,5) Reed-Muller code generator and then puncturing 8 symbols from the 32 coded symbols. A change in the puncturing positions where the 8 symbols are punctured from the coded symbols of length 32 causes a change in the minimum distance dmin of the codeword. Therefore, in<br>
order to make a (24,5) encoder with excellent error correcting performance in the (32,5) first order Reed-Muller code, it is important to calculate the puncturing positions where the largest minimum distance can be obtained.<br>
The simplest puncturing pattern for the 8 puncturing positions needed to generate an optimal (24,5) linear code is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. In this case, a transmitter and a receiver of the mobile communication system transmitting 5 information bits using the encoding/decoding method according to the present invention previously exchange or otherwise pre-store the 8 puncturing positions.

At the same time, a signal generator 2000 provides 5 symbol streams R1-R5 constituting the generating matrix, stored in a memory, to the multipliers 2020-2026, respectively. To be specific, the signal generator 2000 reads a symbol stream Rl=0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 of length 24 corresponding to the first row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream Rl to the multiplier 2020. The signal generator 2000 reads a length-24 symbol stream R2=0011 0011 0011 0011 0011 0011 corresponding to the second row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R2 to the multiplier 2022. The signal generator 2000 reads a length-24 symbol stream R3=0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 corresponding to the third row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R3 to the multiplier 2024. The signal generator 2000 reads a length-24 symbol stream R4=llll 1111 0000 0000 1111 1111 corresponding to the fourth row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R4 to the multiplier 2026. Finally, the signal generator 2000 reads a length-24 symbol stream R5-0000 0000 1111 1111 1111 1111 corresponding to the fifth row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R5 to the multiplier 2028. Then, the<br>

The (24,6) encoder provided by the invention is constructed to generate an optimal (24,6) code by puncturing 8 symbols from an extended orthogonal code obtained by extending a codeword using one mask function for a (32,5) orthogonal code (or first order Reed-Muller code).<br>
FIG. 19 illustrates a structure of the extended orthogonal code. Referring to FIG. 3, when Ml is the mask function in use, 32 orthogonal codewords W of length 32 are used for the upper 32 codewords, and 32 codewords (Ml+W) determined by XORing the mask function Ml and the 32 orthogonal codewords W are used for the next 32 codewords. Therefore, a total of 26=64 codewords are used as the extended orthogonal codes. The mask function for optimizing a (24,6) code is determined experimentally .<br>
For example, the mask function Ml is as follows. Ml=00000000 1110 1000 1101 1000 11000000<br>
Although there are many ways to create the (24,6) linear code, it is possible not only to minimize hardware complexity but also to generate an optimal codeword in terms of error correcting performance by utilizing a method of puncturing an extended first order Reed-Muller code according to an embodiment of the present invention so that an inverse fast Hadamard transform is performed in a decoding process. The embodiment of the present invention generates an error correcting code using the extended orthogonal code. Further, it<br>
is possible to minimize the hardware complexity by minimizing a length of the orthogonal code before puncturing.<br>
The (24,6) codeword is generated by puncturing 8 symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from a (32,6) extended code generator. Here, a change in the puncturing positions where the 8 symbols are punctured from the 32 extended coded symbols causes a change in the minimum distance dmin of the codeword. Therefore, in order to make a (24,6) encoder with excellent error correcting performance in the (32,6) extended orthogonal code, it is important to calculate the puncturing positions where the largest minimum distance can be obtained.<br>
The 8 puncturing positions needed for generating an optimal (24,6) linear code are calculated through experimentation. The simplest puncturing pattern is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. In this case, a transmitter and a receiver of the mobile communication system transmitting the 6 information bits using the encoding/decoding method according to the present invention previously exchange or otherwise pre-store the 8 puncturing positions. The puncturing positions are generally defined in a communication protocol. Alternatively, the transmitter may previously provide information on the puncturing positions.<br>

Referring to FIG. 20, 6 input information bits aO, al, a2, a3, a4 and a5 are applied to a (32,6) extended orthogonal encoder 2100. Here, the 6 input information bits aO, al, a2, a3, a4 and a5 constitute a rate indicator. The extended orthogonal encoder 2100 encodes the 6 input information bits aO, al, a2, a3, a4 and a5, and outputs coded symbols of length 32 (or a coded symbol stream). The 32 coded symbols output from the extended orthogonal encoder 2100 are provided to a puncturer 2110. The puncturer 2110 punctures 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6lh and 7th symbols in the 8 optimal puncturing positions from the 32 coded symbols, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>

The signal generator 2200 reads a length-24 symbol stream R4=llll 1111 0000 0000 1111 1111 corresponding to the fourth row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R4 to the multiplier 2226. The signal generator 2200 reads a length-24 symbol stream R5=0000 0000 1111 1111 1111 1111 corresponding to the fifth row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R5 to the multiplier 2228.

7. (24.1) Encoder<br>
The (24,7) encoder provided by the invention is constructed to generate an optimal (24,7) code by puncturing 8 symbols from an extended orthogonal code obtained by extending a codeword using 2 mask functions for a (32,5) orthogonal code (or first order Reed-Muller code).<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a structure of the extended orthogonal code. Referring<br>
to FIG. 3, when Ml and M2 are the 2 mask functions stated above, 32 orthogonal codewords W of length 32 are used for the upper 32 codewords, and 32 codewords (Ml+W) determined by XORing the mask function Ml and the 32 orthogonal codewords W are used for the next 32 codewords. Further, 32 codewords (M2+W) determined by XORing the mask function M2 and the 32 orthogonal codewords W are used for the next 32 codewords, and 32 codewords (M1+M2+W) determined by XORing the mask function Ml and M2 and the 32 orthogonal codewords W are used for the last 32 codewords. Therefore, a total of 27=128 codewords are used as the extended orthogonal codes. The 2 mask functions for optimizing a (24,7) code are determined experimentally .<br>
For example, the 2 mask functions Ml and M2 are as follows. Ml=00000000 1110 1000 1101 1000 11000000 M2=00000000 110000000111 11100010 1000<br>
Although there are many ways to create the (24,7) linear code, it is possible not only to minimize hardware complexity but also to use an optimal codeword by utilizing a method of puncturing an extended first order Reed-Muller code according to an embodiment of the present invention so that an inverse fast Hadamard transform is performed in a decoding process. Further, it is possible to minimize the hardware complexity by minimizing a length of the orthogonal code before puncturing. It will be assumed that the embodiment of the present invention generates an error correcting code using the extended orthogonal code.<br>
The (24,7) codeword is generated by puncturing 8 symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from a (32,7) extended code generator. Here, a change in the puncturing positions where the 8 symbols are punctured from the 32 extended coded symbols causes a change in the minimum distance dmjn of the codeword. Therefore, in order to make a (24,7) encoder with excellent error correcting performance in the (32,7) extended orthogonal code, it is important to calculate the puncturing positions where the largest minimum distance can be obtained.<br>
The 8 puncturing positions needed for generating an optimal (24,7) linear code can be calculated through experimentation. The simplest puncturing pattern is {0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28} or {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. In this case, a transmitter and a receiver of the mobile communication system transmitting the 7 information bits using the encoding/decoding method according to the present invention<br>
previously exchange or otherwise pre-store the 8 puncturing positions. The puncturing positions are generally defined in a communication protocol. Alternatively, the transmitter may previously provide information on the puncturing positions.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a structure of an optimal (24,7) encoder included in the transmitter according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4, 7 input information bits aO, al, a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 are applied to a (32,7) extended orthogonal encoder 400. Here, the 7 input information bits aO, al, a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 constitute a rate indicator. The extended orthogonal encoder 400 encodes the 7 input information bits aO, al, a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6, and outputs coded symbols (or a coded symbol stream) of length 32. The 32 coded symbols output from the extended orthogonal encoder 400 are provided to a puncturer 410. The puncturer 410 punctures 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th symbols or 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th symbols in the 8 optimal puncturing positions from the 32 coded symbols, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
A general code theory defines a generating matrix to show a mapping relation between the input information and the coded symbols. When the symbol puncturing is included, a generating matrix for a final (24,7) encoder is represented by<br>
Equation 7<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The generating matrix of Equation 7 selects 24 symbols in a first row if the first input information bit among the 7 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbol if the first input information bit is 0. The generating matrix selects 24 symbols in a second row if the second input information bit among the 7 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbol if the second input information bit is 0. The generating matrix selects 24 symbols in a third row if the third input information bit among the 7 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbol if<br>
the third input information bit is 0. The generating matrix selects 24 symbols in a fourth row if the fourth input information bit among the 7 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbol if the fourth input information bit is 0. The generating matrix selects 24 symbols in a fifth row if the fifth input information bit among the 7 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbol if the fifth input information bit is 0. The generating matrix selects 24 symbols in a sixth row if the sixth input information bit among the 7 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbol if the sixth input information bit is 0. The generating matrix selects 24 symbols in a seventh row if the seventh input information bit among the 7 input information bits is 1, and selects no symbol if the seventh input information bit is 0. A coded symbol stream for the input information bits is generated by XORing all of the selected rows in a symbol unit.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a (24,7) encoder based on the above generating matrix. Referring to FIG. 8, of the input information bits aO-a6 having a value of 0 or 1, an input information bit aO is applied to a multiplier 1020, an input information bit al is applied to a multiplier 1022, an input information bit a2 is applied to a multiplier 1024, an input information bit a3 is applied to a multiplier 1026, an input information bit a4 is applied to a multiplier 1028, an input information bit a5 is applied to a multiplier 1030, and an input information bit a6 is applied to a multiplier 1032, respectively. At the same time, a signal generator 1000 provides 7 symbol streams R1-R7 constituting the generating matrix, stored in a memory, to the multipliers 1020-1032, respectively. To be specific, the signal generator 1000 reads a length-24 symbol stream Rl= 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 corresponding to the first row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream Rl to the multiplier 1020. The signal generator 1000 reads a length-24 symbol stream R2=0011 0011 0011 0011 0011 0011 corresponding to the second row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R2 to the multiplier 1022. The signal generator 1000 reads a length-24 symbol stream R3= 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 corresponding to the third row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R3 to the multiplier 1024. The signal generator 1000 reads a length-24 symbol stream R4=l 111 1111 0000 0000 1111 1111 corresponding to the fourth row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R4 to the multiplier 1026. The signal generator 1000 reads a length-24 symbol stream R5=0000 0000 1111 1111 1111 1111 corresponding to the fifth row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R5 to the multiplier 1028. The<br>
signal generator 1000 reads a length-24 symbol stream R6=1110 1000 1101 1000 1100 0000 corresponding to the sixth row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R6 to the multiplier 1030. Finally, the signal generator 1000 reads a length-24 symbol stream R7=1100 0000 0111 1110 0010 1000 corresponding to the seventh row of the generating matrix, stored in the memory, and provides the read symbol stream R7 to the multiplier 1032. Then, the multiplier 1020 multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream Rl by the input information bit aO, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to an XOR operator 1040. The multiplier 1022 multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream R2 by the input information bit al, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to the XOR operator 1040. The multiplier 1024 multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream R3 by the input information bit a2, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to the XOR operator 1040. The multiplier 1026 multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream R4 by the input information bit a3, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to the XOR operator 1040. The multiplier 1028 multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream R5 by the input information bit a4, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to the XOR operator 1040. The multiplier 1030 multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream R6 by the input information bit a5, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to the XOR operator 1040. The multiplier 1032 multiplies the symbols of the symbol stream R7 by the input information bit a6, and outputs a symbol stream of length 24 to the XOR operator 1040. The XOR operator 1040 then XORs the 7 symbol streams of length 24 in a symbol unit, and outputs a coded symbol stream of length 24.<br>
The above (24,1) encoder, (24,2) encoder, (24,3) encoder, (24,4) encoder, (24,5) encoder, (24,6) encoder and (24,7) encoder have something in common with one another in that they can be analogized from the structure of the orthogonal code in the light of the structure of the encoder. That is, the (24,1) encoder uses the (2,1) orthogonal code, the (24,2) encoder uses the (4,2) orthogonal code, the (24,3) encoder uses the (8,3) orthogonal code, the (24,4) encoder uses the (16,4) orthogonal code, and the (24,5) encoder uses the (32,5) orthogonal code. The (32,6) extended orthogonal code used in the (24,6) encoder is an orthogonal code extended by the (32,5) encoder using a basis (mask function) of one additional codeword. The (32,7) extended orthogonal code used in the (24,7) encoder is an orthogonal code extended by the (32,5) encoder using bases (mask functions) of two additional codewords. Therefore, the (24,1) encoder, (24,2) encoder, (24,3) encoder, (24,4) encoder, (24,5) encoder, (24,6) encoder and (24,7) encoder have the above-stated common point. Based on this,<br>
a first embodiment of the present invention provides a single encoder capable of serving as all of the (24,1) encoder, (24,2) encoder, (24,3) encoder, (24,4) encoder, (24,5) encoder, (24,6) encoder and (24,7) encoder having different sizes.<br>
First Embodiment (Encoder)<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a structure of an encoder serving as all of the (24,1) encoder, (24,2) encoder, (24,3) encoder, (24,4) encoder, (24,5) encoder, (24,6) encoder and (24,7) encoder having different lengths. That is, the encoder of FIG. 5 encodes 1 to 7 input information bits with different Walsh codes or masks having a length of 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a controller 510 controls an encoding operation by determining the number of the input information bits. That is, when the number of the input information bits is 1, the controller 510 controls a Walsh code generator 500 to generate one Walsh code having a length of 2. Further, the controller 510 sets a repetition frequency of a repeater 550 to 32, and controls a puncturer 560 to puncture symbols in the 40 puncturing positions corresponding to the one input information bit. When the number of the input information bits is 2, the controller 510 controls the Walsh code generator 500 to generate 2 different Walsh codes having a length of 4. Further, the controller 510 sets a repetition frequency of the repeater 550 to 8, and controls the puncturer 560 to puncture symbols in the 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 2 input information bits. When the number of the input information bits is 3, the controller 510 controls the Walsh code generator 500 to generate 3 different Walsh codes having a length of 8. Further, the controller 510 sets a repetition frequency of the repeater 550 to 4, and controls the puncturer 560 to puncture symbols in the 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 3 input information bits. When the number of the input information bits is 4, the controller 510 controls the Walsh code generator 500 to generate 4 different Walsh codes having a length of 16. Further, the controller 510 sets a repetition frequency of the repeater 550 to 2, and controls the puncturer 560 to puncture symbols in the 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 4 input information bits. When the number of the input information bits is 5, the controller 510 controls the Walsh code generator 500 to generate 5 different Walsh codes having a length of 32. Further, the controller 510 sets a repetition frequency of the repeater 550 to 1, and controls the puncturer 560 to puncture symbols in the 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 5 input information bits. When the number of the input<br>
information bits is 6, the controller 510 controls the Walsh code generator 500 and a mask generator 505 to generate 5 different Walsh codes and one mask, all having a length of 32, respectively. Further, the controller 510 sets a repetition frequency of the repeater 550 to 1, and controls the puncturer 560 to puncture symbols in the 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 6 input information bits. When the number of the input information bits is 7, the controller 510 controls the Walsh code generator 500 and the mask generator 505 to generate 5 different Walsh codes and 2 different masks, all having a length of 32, respectively. Further, the controller 510 sets a repetition frequency of the repeater 550 to 1, and controls the puncturer 560 to puncture symbols in the 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 7 input information bits.<br>
The Walsh code generator 500, under the control of the controller 510, selectively generates different Walsh codes of length 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32. For example, upon receiving one input information bit, the Walsh code generator 500 generates one Walsh code of length 2 under the control of the controller 510. Upon receiving 2 input information bits, the Walsh code generator 500 generates 2 different Walsh codes of length 4 under the control of the controller 510. Upon receiving 3 input information bits, the Walsh code generator 500 generates 3 different Walsh codes of length 8 under the control of the controller 510. Upon receiving 4 input information bits, the Walsh code generator 500 generates 4 different Walsh codes of length 16 under the control of the controller 510. Upon receiving 5 to 7 input information bits, the Walsh code generator 500 generates 5 different Walsh codes of length 32 under the control of the controller 510.<br>
The mask generator 505 selectively generates masks of length 32 under the control of the controller 510. For example, upon receiving 1 to 5 input information bits, the mask generator 505 generates no mask under the control of the controller 510. However, upon receiving 6 input information bits, the mask generator 505 generates one mask of length 32 under the control of the controller 510. Further, upon receiving 7 input information bits, the mask generator 505 generates two different masks of length 32 under the control of the controller 510. Alternatively, the mask generator 505 may be designed to continuously generate 2 different masks, without being controlled by the controller 510. In this case, O's are input as the input information bits in order not to affect the output of the XOR operator 540.<br>
Multipliers 520-532 multiply the 1 to 7 input information bits by the<br>
Walsh codes and the masks from the Walsh code generator 500 and the mask generator 505 on a one-to-one basis, and output coded symbol streams each having 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 coded symbols. When 4 input bits are received as the input information bits, input bits having a value '0' are provided as the remaining input information bits a4, a5 and a6, so that the output values are not affected. The XOR operator 540 XORs the coded symbol streams from the multipliers 520-532, and outputs one coded symbol stream having 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 coded symbols. The repeater 550, under the control of the controller 510, repeats the coded symbol stream from the XOR operator 540 a predetermined number of times, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 64 coded symbols. For example, when one input bit is received as the input information bit, the repeater 550 repeats 32 times the 2 coded symbols output from the XOR operator 540 under the control of the controller 510, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 64 coded symbols. However, when 2 to 7 input bits are received as the input information bits, the repeater 550 repeats 8, 4, 2 or 1 times the 4, 8, 16 or 32 coded symbols output from the XOR operator 540 under the control of the controller 510, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 32 coded symbols. A memory 570 stores 8 puncturing positions corresponding to each of the 1 to 7 input information bits. The 40 puncturing positions corresponding to the 1 input information bit, stored in the memory 570, are all the even-numbered symbol positions and 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th symbol positions. The 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 2 input information bit, stored in the memory 570, are 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th symbol positions. The 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 3 input information bit, stored in the memory 570, are 0th, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 16th and 24th symbol positions. The 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 4 input information bits, stored in the memory 570, are 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 16th symbol positions. The 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 5 input information bits, stored in the memory 570, are 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th symbol positions. The 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 6 input information bits, stored in the memory 570, are 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7lh symbol positions. The 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 7 input information bits, stored in the memory 570, are 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th symbol positions.<br>
Shown in Table 1 are puncturing positions associated with the number of the input information bits, stored in a memory table of the memory 550.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The puncturer 560 receives the coded symbol stream having 32 or 64 coded symbols from the repeater 550, punctures coded symbols in the 8 or 40 puncturing positions read from the memory 570 from the 32 or 64 coded symbols under the control of the controller 510, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. That is, if the number of the input information bits is 1, the puncturer 560 punctures the coded symbols in the 40 puncturing positions read from the memory 570 among the 64 coded symbols output from the repeater 550 under the control of the controller 510, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. However, if the number of the input information bits is 2 to 7, the puncturer 560 punctures the coded symbols in the 8 puncturing positionsread from the memory 570 among the 32 coded symbols output from the repeater 550 under the control of the controller 510, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. Specifically, if the number of the input information bits is 1, the puncturer 560 punctures all the even-numbered coded symbols and the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7lh, 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th coded symbols (as shown in Table 1) from the 64 coded symbols output from the repeater 550, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. If the number of the input information bits is 2, the puncturer 560 punctures the 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th coded symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from the repeater 550, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. If the number of the input information bits is 3, the puncturer 560 punctures the 0th, 3rd. 5Ih. 6th, 7th, 8th, 16th and 24th coded symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from the repeater 550, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. If the number of the input information bits is 4, the puncturer 560 punctures the 0th, 1st,<br>
2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 16th coded symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from the repeater 550, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. If the number of the input information bits is 5, the puncturer 560 punctures the 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th coded symbols or the 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th coded symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from the repeater 550, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. If the number of the input information bits is 6, the puncturer 560 punctures the 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th coded symbols or the 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th coded symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from the repeater 550, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. If the number of the input information bits is 7, the puncturer 560 punctures the 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th coded symbols or the 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th coded symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from the repeater 550, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols.<br>
With reference to FIG. 5, a description of the encoder will be made separately for the respective cases where the encoder serves as a (24,1) encoder to a (24,7) encoder. It will be assumed herein that the input information bits applied to the encoder constitute a rate indicator.<br>
First, a description will be made of one case where the encoder serves as the (24,7) encoder. A 7-bit rate indicator of aO, al, a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 is applied to the encoder, and at the same time, bit information indicating that the 7-bit rate indicator is applied to the encoder is provided to the controller 510. The controller 510 then provides the Walsh code generator 500 with a control signal instructing it to generate Walsh codes of length 32. Upon receiving the control signal, the Walsh code generator 500 generates Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4, W8 and W16 of length 32, and provides the generated Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4, W8 and W16 to the associated multipliers, respectively. To be specific, the Walsh code Wl is provided to the multiplier 520, the Walsh code W2 to the multiplier 522, the Walsh code W4 to the multiplier 524, the Walsh code W8 to the multiplier 526, and the Walsh code W16 to the multiplier 528. Shown in Table 2 are the Walsh codes of length 32 generated by the Walsh code generator 500.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
At the same time, the mask generator 505 generates a mask Ml=0111 0111 0010 0100 0110 OOOO OOOO OOOO and a mask M2-0010 0110 0101 0100 0101 0100 0100 OOOO, and provides the generated masks Ml and M2 to the multipliers 530 and 532, respectively.<br>
Meanwhile, the 7 input information bits of the rate indicator are provided to the associated multipliers, respectively. Shown in Table 3 are the relations between the 7 input information bits and the associated multipliers.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Therefore, shown in Table 4 are the input information bits and the Walsh codes or masks provided to the respective multipliers.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The multipliers multiply the input information bits by the Walsh codes or masks, provided thereto as shown in Table 4, and provide their outputs to the XOR operator 540.<br>
Specifically, the multiplier 520 multiplies the input information bit aO by the Walsh code Wl every symbol (i.e., in a symbol unit), and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 522 multiplies the input information bit al by the Walsh code W2 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 524 multiplies the input information bit a2 by the Walsh code W4 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 526 multiplies the input information bit a3 by the Walsh code W8 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 528 multiplies the input information bit a4 by the Walsh code W16 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 530 multiplies the input information bit a5 by the mask Ml every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 532 multiplies the input information bit a6 by the mask M2 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540.<br>
The XOR operator 540 then XORs the symbol streams of length 32 output from the multipliers 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532 in a symbol unit, and provides its output to the repeater 550.<br>
The coded symbol stream Ws of length 32, output from the XOR operator 540, can be defined as<br>
Equation 8 Ws=(W 1 xaO)+(W2xa 1 )+(W4xa2)+(W8xa3)+(W 16xa4)+(M 1 xa5)+(M2xa6)<br>
At this moment, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal for controlling a repetition frequency over the output of the XOR operator 540. In the (24,7) encoder, as the symbol stream output from the XOR operator 540 has a length of 32, the repeater 550 does not perform repetition (herein, defined as one-time repetition). To this end, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal instructing it to output the intact input signal. In response to the control signal, the repeater 550 provides the puncturer 560 with the intact symbol stream of length 32 output from the XOR operator 540.<br>
At this point, the controller 510 provides the puncturer 560 with a control signal instructing it to puncture symbols in the puncturing positions for the (24.7)<br>
code. The controller 510 may provide the puncturer 560 with length information (7 bits) of the rate indicator as the control signal. The puncturer 560 then receives 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 7 input information bits of the rate indicator from the memory 570, and punctures coded symbols in the 8 puncturing positions from the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the repeater 550. That is, the puncturer 560 punctures 8 symbols in the puncturing positions read from the memory 570 among the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the repeater 550. For example, when the puncturing positions from the memory 570 are 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th symbol positions (as shown in Table 1), the puncturer 560 punctures 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th coded symbols from the coded symbols of length 32, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
Until now, an operation of the (24,7) encoder has been described with reference to one case where the encoder has the puncturing pattern {0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28}. Alternatively, however, the encoder may puncture the 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th coded symbols from the coded symbol stream of length 32 in order to reduce hardware complexity. In this case, the mask generator 505 generates a mask Ml-0000 0000 1110 1000 1101 1000 1100 0000 and a mask M2=0000 0000 110000000111 11100010 1000.<br>
Second, a description will be made of one case where the encoder serves as the (24,6) encoder. A 6-bit rate indicator of aO, al, a2, a3, a4 and a5 is applied to the encoder, and the remaining rate indicator bit a6 is initialized to 0 and applied to the encoder. At the same time, bit information indicating that the 6-bit rate indicator is applied to the encoder is provided to the controller 510. The controller 510 then provides the Walsh code generator 500 with a control signal instructing it to generate Walsh codes of length 32. Upon receiving the control signal, the Walsh code generator 500 generates Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4, W8 and W16 of length 32, and provides the generated Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4, W8 and W16 to the associated multipliers, respectively. To be specific, the Walsh code Wl is provided to the multiplier 520, the Walsh code W2 to the multiplier 522, the Walsh code W4 to the multiplier 524, the Walsh code W8 to the multiplier 526, and the Walsh code W16 to the multiplier 528. Shown in Table 5 are the Walsh codes of length 32 generated by the Walsh code generator 500.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
At the same time, the mask generator 505 generates a mask Ml=0111 0111 0010 0100 0110 OOOO OOOO OOOO, and provides the generated mask Ml to the multiplier 530.<br>
Meanwhile, the 6 input information bits of the rate indicator are provided to the associated multipliers, respectively. Shown in Table 6 are the relations between the 6 input information bits and the associated multipliers.<br>
Table 6<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Therefore, shown in Table 7 are the input information bits and the Walsh codes or mask provided to the respective multipliers.<br>
Table 7<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The multipliers multiply the input information bits by the Walsh codes or mask, provided thereto as shown in Table 7, and provide their outputs to the XOR operator 540.<br>
Specifically, the multiplier 520 multiplies the input information bit aO by<br>
the Walsh code Wl every symbol (i.e., in a symbol unit), and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 522 multiplies the input information bit al by the Walsh code W2 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 524 multiplies the input information bit a2 by the Walsh code W4 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 526 multiplies the input information bit a3 by the Walsh code W8 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 528 multiplies the input information bit a4 by the Walsh code W16 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 530 multiplies the input information bit a5 by the mask Ml every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540.<br>
Meanwhile, since the input information bit a6 applied to the multiplier 532 is initialized to 0, an output of the multiplier 532 does not affect the output of the XOR operator 540 regardless of the mask M2 from the mask generator 505. That is, the multiplier 532 outputs a symbol stream comprised of coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of symbol values of the symbol stream from the mask generator 505. Therefore, the output of the multiplier 532 does not affect the output of the XOR operator 540. Initializing the input information bit a6 to 0 is equivalent to a switching operation for cutting off the output of the multiplier 532.<br>
The XOR operator 540 then XORs the symbol streams of length 32 output from the multipliers 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532 in a symbol unit, and provides its output to the repeater 550.<br>
The coded symbol stream Ws of length 32, output from the XOR operator 540, can be defined as<br>
Equation 9 (Equation  Removed)<br>
At this moment, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal for controlling a repetition frequency over the output of the XOR operator 540. In the (24,6) encoder, as the symbol stream output from the XOR operator 540 has a length of 32, the repeater 550 has a repetition frequency of 1. Therefore, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal instructing it to repeat the input signal once (i.e., to output the intact input signal).<br>
In response to the control signal, the repeater 550 provides the puncturer 560 with the intact symbol stream of length 32 output from the XOR operator 540.<br>
At this point, the controller 510 provides the puncturer 560 with a control signal instructing it to puncture symbols in the puncturing positions for the (24,6) code. The controller 510 provides the puncturer 560 with length information (6 bits) of the rate indicator as the control signal. The puncturer 560 then receives 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 6 input information bits of the rate indicator from the memory 570, and punctures coded symbols in the 8 puncturing positions from the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the repeater 550. That is, the puncturer 560 punctures 8 symbols in the puncturing positions read from the memory 570 among the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the repeater 550. For example, when the puncturing positions from the memory 570 are 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th symbol positions (as shown in Table 1), the puncturer 560 punctures 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th coded symbols from the coded symbols of length 32, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
Alternatively, however, the encoder may puncture the 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th coded symbols from the coded symbol stream of length 32 in order to reduce hardware complexity. In this case, the mask generator 505 generates a mask Ml =0000 0000 1110 1000 1101 1000 11000000.<br>
Third, a description will be made of one case where the encoder serves as the (24,5) encoder. A 5-bit rate indicator of aO, al, a2, a3 and a4 is applied to the encoder, and the remaining rate indicator bits a5 and a6 are initialized to 0 and applied to the encoder. At the same time, bit information indicating that the 5-bit rate indicator is applied to the encoder is provided to the controller 510. The controller 510 then provides the Walsh code generator 500 with a control signal instructing it to generate Walsh codes of length 32. Upon receiving the control signal, the Walsh code generator 500 generates Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4, W8 and W16 of length 32, and provides the generated Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4, W8 and W16 to the associated multipliers, respectively. To be specific, the Walsh code Wl is provided to the multiplier 520, the Walsh code W2 to the multiplier 522, the Walsh code W4 to the multiplier 524, the Walsh code W8 to the multiplier 526, and the Walsh code W16 to the multiplier 528. Shown in Table 8 are the Walsh codes of length 32 generated by the Walsh code generator 500.<br>

Meanwhile, the 5 input information bits of the rate indicator are provided to the associated multipliers, respectively. Shown in Table 9 are the relations between the 6 input information bits and the associated multipliers.<br>

Therefore, shown in Table 10 are the input information bits and the Walsh codes provided to the respective multipliers.<br>
Table 10<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The multipliers multiply the input information bits by the Walsh codes, provided thereto as shown in Table 10, and provide their outputs to the XOR operator 540.<br>
Specifically, the multiplier 520 multiplies the input information bit aO by the Walsh code Wl every symbol (i.e., in a symbol unit), and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 522 multiplies the input information bit al by the Walsh code \V2 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 524 multiplies the input information bit a2 by the Walsh code W4 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540.<br>
The multiplier 526 multiplies the input information bit a3 by the Walsh code W8 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 528 multiplies the input information bit a4 by the Walsh code W16 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540.<br>
Meanwhile, since the input information bits a5 and a6 applied to the multipliers 530 and 532 are initialized to 0, outputs of the multipliers 530 and 532 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 540 regardless of the masks Ml and M2 from the mask generator 505. That is, the multipliers 530 and 532 output symbol streams each comprised of coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of symbol values of the symbol stream from the mask generator 505. Therefore, the outputs of the multipliers 530 and 532 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 540. Initializing the input information bits a5 and a6 to 0 is equivalent to a switching operation for cutting off the outputs of the multipliers 530 and 532.<br>
The XOR operator 540 then XORs the symbol streams of length 32 output from the multipliers 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532 in a symbol unit, and provides its output to the repeater 550.<br>
The coded symbol stream Ws of length 32, output from the XOR operator 540, can be defined as<br>
Equation 10<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
At this moment, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal for controlling a repetition frequency over the output of the XOR operator 540. In the (24,5) encoder, as the symbol stream output from the XOR operator 540 has a length of 32, the repeater 550 has a repetition frequency of 1. Therefore, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal instructing it to repeat the input signal once (i.e., to output the intact input signal). In response to the control signal, the repeater 550 provides the puncturer 560 with the intact symbol stream of length 32 output from the XOR operator 540.<br>
At this point, the controller 510 provides the puncturer 560 with a control signal instructing it to puncture symbols in the puncturing positions for the (24,5) code. The puncturer 560 then receives 8 puncturing positions read from the<br>
memory 570, and punctures coded symbols in the 8 puncturing positions from the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the repeater 550. That is, the puncturer 560 punctures 8 symbols in the puncturing positions read from the memory 570 among the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the repeater 550. For example, when the puncturing positions from the memory 570 are 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th symbol positions (as shown in Table 1), the puncturer 560 punctures 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28[h coded symbols from the coded symbols of length 32, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
Alternatively, however, the encoder may puncture the 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th coded symbols from the coded symbol stream of length 32 in order to reduce hardware complexity.<br>
Fourth, a description will be made of another case where the encoder serves as the (24,4) encoder. A 4-bit rate indicator of aO, al, a2 and a3 is applied to the encoder, and the remaining input information bits a4, a5 and a6 are initialized to '0'. At the same time, bit information indicating that the 4-bit rate indicator is applied to the encoder is provided to the controller 510. The controller 510 then provides the Walsh code generator 500 with a control signal instructing it to generate Walsh codes of length 16. Upon receiving the control signal, the Walsh code generator 500 generates Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4 and W8 of length 16, and provides the generated Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4 and W8 to the associated multipliers, respectively. To be specific, the Walsh code Wl is provided to the multiplier 520, the Walsh code W2 to the multiplier 522, the Walsh code W4 to the multiplier 524, and the Walsh code W8 to the multiplier 526. Shown in Table 11 are the Walsh codes of length 16 generated by the Walsh code generator 500.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Therefore, shown in Table 13 are the input information bits and the Walsh codes provided to the respective multipliers.<br>
Table 13<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The multipliers multiply the input information bits by the Walsh codes, provided thereto as shown in Table 13, and provide their outputs to the XOR operator 540. Specifically, the multiplier 520 multiplies the input information bit aO by the Walsh code Wl every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 522 multiplies the input information bit al by the Walsh code W2 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 524 multiplies the input information bit a2 by the Walsh code W4 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 526 multiplies the input information bit a3 by the Walsh code W8 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540.<br>
Meanwhile, since the multipliers 528, 530 and 532 receive the input information bits a4, a5 and a6 initialized to '0', the outputs of the multipliers 528, 530 and 532 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 540 regardless of the Walsh code W16 from the Walsh code generator 500 and the masks Ml and M2 from the mask generator 505. To be specific, the multiplier 528 outputs a symbol stream having coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of a value of the Walsh code W16 from the Walsh code generator 500. Similarly, the multipliers 530 and 532 output symbol streams each having coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of values of the masks Ml and M2 from the mask generator<br>
505. As a result, the outputs of the multipliers 528, 530 and 532 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 540, though they are provided to the XOR operator 540. Initializing the input information bits a4, a5 and a6 to ;0' is equivalent to a switching operation for cutting off the outputs of the multipliers 528, 530 and 532.<br>
The XOR operator 540 then XORs the symbol streams of length 16 output from the multipliers 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532 in a symbol unit, and provides its output to the repeater 550.<br>
The coded symbol stream Ws of length 16, output from the XOR operator 540, is then defined as<br>
Equation 11 <br>
(Equation  Removed)<br><br>
At this moment, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal for controlling a repetition frequency over the output of the XOR operator 540. In the (24,4) encoder, as the symbol stream output from the XOR operator 540 has a length of 16, a repetition frequency of the repeater 550 will be 2. Therefore, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal instructing it to repeat the input signal two times. In response to the control signal, the repeater 550 repeats the symbol stream of length 16 output from the XOR operator 540 two times, and provides the puncturer 560 with a symbol stream of length 32.<br>
At this point, the controller 510 provides the puncturer 560 with a control signal instructing it to puncture symbols in the puncturing positions for the (24,4) code. The puncturer 560 then receives 8 puncturing positions read from the memory 570, and punctures coded symbols in the 8 puncturing positions from the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the repeater 550. That is, the puncturer 560 punctures 8 symbols in the puncturing positions read from the memory 570 among the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the repeater 550. For example, when the puncturing positions from the memory 570 are 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 16th symbol positions (as shown in Table 1), the puncturer 560 punctures 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 16th coded symbols from the coded symbols of length 32, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
Fifth, a description will be made of another case where the encoder serves as the (24,3) encoder. A 3-bit rate indicator of aO, al and a2 is applied to the encoder, and the remaining input information bits a3, a4, a5 and a6 applied to the encoder are initialized to '0'. At the same time, bit information indicating that the 3-bit rate indicator is applied to the encoder is provided to the controller 510. The controller 510 then provides the Walsh code generator 500 with a control signal instructing it to generate Walsh codes of length 8. Upon receiving the control signal, the Walsh code generator 500 generates Walsh codes Wl, W2 and W4 of length 8, and provides the generated Walsh codes Wl, W2 and W4 to the associated multipliers, respectively. To be specific, the Walsh code Wl is provided to the multiplier 520, the Walsh code W2 to the multiplier 522, and the Walsh code W4 to the multiplier 524.

The multiplier 522 multiplies the input information bit al by the Walsh code W2 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. The multiplier 524 multiplies the input information bit a2 by the Walsh code W4 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540.<br>
Meanwhile, since the multipliers 526, 528, 530 and 532 receive the input information bits a3, a4, a5 and a6 initialized to 0, the outputs of the multipliers 526, 528, 530 and 532 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 540 regardless of the Walsh codes W8 and W16 from the Walsh code generator 500 and the masks Ml and M2 from the mask generator 505. To be specific, the multipliers 526 and 528 output symbol streams each comprised of coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of symbol values of the Walsh codes W8 and W16 from the Walsh code generator 500. Similarly, the multipliers 530 and 532 output symbol streams each comprised of coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of symbol values of the masks Ml and M2 from the mask generator 505. As a result, the outputs of the multipliers 526, 528, 530 and 532 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 540, though they are provided to the XOR operator 540. Initializing the input information bits a3, a4, a5 and a6 to '0' is equivalent to a switching operation for cutting off the outputs of the multipliers 526, 528, 530 and 532.<br>
The XOR operator 540 then XORs the symbol streams of length 8 output from the multipliers 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532 in a symbol unit, and provides its output to the repeater 550.<br>
The coded symbol stream Ws of length 8, output from the XOR operator 540, is then defined as<br>

(Equation  Removed)<br>
At this moment, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal for controlling a repetition frequency over the output of the XOR<br>
operator 540. In the (24,3) encoder, as the symbol stream output from the XOR operator 540 has a length of 8, a repetition frequency of the repeater 550 will be 4. Therefore, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal instructing it to repeat the input signal four times. In response to the control signal, the repeater 550 repeats the symbol stream of length 8 output from the XOR operator 540 four times, and provides the puncturer 560 with a symbol stream of length 32.<br>
At this point, the controller 510 provides the puncturer 560 with a control signal instructing it to puncture symbols in the puncturing positions for the (24,3) code. The controller 510 may provide the puncturer 560 with length information (3 bits) of the rate indicator as the control signal. The puncturer 560 then receives 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 3 input information bits of the rate indicator from the memory 570, and punctures coded symbols in the 8 puncturing positions from the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the repeater 550. That is, the puncturer 560 punctures 8 symbols in the puncturing positions read from the memory 570 among the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the repeater 550. For example, when the puncturing positions from the memory 570 are 0th, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 16th and 24th symbol positions (as shown in Table 1), the puncturer 560 punctures 0th, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 16th and 24th coded symbols from the coded symbols of length 32, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
Sixth, a description will be made of another case where the encoder serves as the (24,2) encoder. A 2-bit rate indicator of aO and al is applied to the encoder, and the remaining input information bits a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 applied to the encoder are initialized to '0'. At the same time, bit information indicating that the 2-bit rate indicator is applied to the encoder is provided to the controller 510. The controller 510 then provides the Walsh code generator 500 with a control signal instructing it to generate Walsh codes of length 4. Upon receiving the control signal, the Walsh code generator 500 generates Walsh codes Wl and W2 of length 4, and provides the generated Walsh codes Wl and W2 to the associated multipliers, respectively.

The multiplier 522 multiplies the input information bit al by the Walsh code W2 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540.<br>
Meanwhile, since the multipliers 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532 receive the input information bits a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 initialized to 0, the outputs of the multipliers 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 540 regardless of the Walsh codes W4, WS and W16 from the Walsh code generator 500 and the masks Ml and M2 from the mask generator 505. To be specific, the multipliers 524, 526 and 528 output symbol streams each comprised of coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of symbol values of the Walsh codes W4, W8 and W16 from the Walsh code generator 500. Similarly, the multipliers 530 and 532 output symbol streams each comprised of coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of symbol values of the masks Ml and M2 from the mask generator 505. As a result, the outputs of the multipliers 524,<br>
526, 528, 530 and 532 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 540, though they are provided to the XOR operator 540. Initializing the input information bits a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 to '0' is equivalent to a switching operation for cutting off the outputs of the multipliers 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532.<br>
The XOR operator 540 then XORs the symbol streams of length 4 output from the multipliers 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532 in a symbol unit, and provides its output to the repeater 550.<br>
The coded symbol stream Ws of length 4, output from the XOR operator 540, is then defined as<br>
Equation 13 (Table Removed)<br>
At this moment, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal for controlling a repetition frequency over the output of the XOR operator 540. In the (24,2) encoder, as the symbol stream output from the XOR operator 540 has a length of 4, a repetition frequency of the repeater 550 will be 8. Therefore, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal instructing it to repeat the input signal eighth times. In response to the control signal, the repeater 550 repeats the symbol stream of length 4 output from the XOR operator 540 eighth times, and provides the puncturer 560 with a symbol stream of length 32.<br>
At this point, the controller 510 provides the puncturer 560 with a control signal instructing it to puncture symbols in the puncturing positions for the (24,2) code. The puncturer 560 then receives 8 puncturing positions read from the memory 570, and punctures coded symbols in the 8 puncturing positions from the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the repeater 550. That is, the puncturer 560 punctures 8 symbols in the puncturing positions read from the memory 570 among the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the repeater 550. For example, when the puncturing positions from the memory 570 are 0th, 4th, 8th, 12lh, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th symbol positions (as shown in Table 1), the puncturer 560 punctures 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th coded symbols from the coded symbols of length 32, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>

A 1-bit rate indicator of input information bit aO is applied to the encoder, and the remaining input information bits al, a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 applied to the encoder are initialized to ;0'. At the same time, bit information indicating that the 1-bit rate indicator is applied to the encoder is provided to the controller 510. The controller 510 then provides the Walsh code generator 500 with a control signal instructing it to generate a Walsh code of length 2. Upon receiving the control signal, the Walsh code generator 500 generates a Walsh code Wl of length 2, and provides the generated Walsh code Wl to the associated multiplier.

(Table Removed)<br>
Therefore, shown in Table 22 are the input information bit and the Walsh code provided to the respective multiplier.<br>
Table 22<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The multiplier multiplies the input information bit by the Walsh code, provided thereto as shown in Table 22, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540. Specifically, the multiplier 520 multiplies the input information bit aO by the Walsh code Wl every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 540.<br>
Meanwhile, since the multipliers 522,  524,  526,  528,  530 and 532<br>
receive the input information bits al, a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 initialized to 0, the outputs of the multipliers 522, 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 540 regardless of the Walsh codes W2, W4, W8 and W16 from the Walsh code generator 500 and the masks Ml and M2 from the mask generator 505. To be specific, the multipliers 522, 524, 526 and 528 output symbol streams each comprised of coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of symbol values of the Walsh codes W2, W4, W8 and W16 from the Walsh code generator 500. Similarly, the multipliers 530 and 532 output symbol streams each comprised of coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of symbol values of the masks Ml and M2 from the mask generator 505. As a result, the outputs of the multipliers 522, 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 540, though they are provided to the XOR operator 540. Initializing the input information bits al, a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 to '0' is equivalent to a switching operation for cutting off the outputs of the multipliers 522, 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532.<br>
The XOR operator 540 then XORs the symbol streams of length 2 output from the multipliers 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, 530 and 532 in a symbol unit, and provides its output to the repeater 550.<br>
The coded symbol stream Ws of length 2, output from the XOR operator 540, is then defined as<br>
Equation 14 (Equation  Removed)At this moment, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal for controlling a repetition frequency over the output of the XOR operator 540. In the (24,1) encoder, as the symbol stream output from the XOR operator 540 has a length of 2, a repetition frequency of the repeater 550 will be 32. Therefore, the controller 510 provides the repeater 550 with a control signal instructing it to repeat the input signal 32 times. In response to the control signal, the repeater 550 repeats the symbol stream of length 2 output from the XOR operator 540 32 times, and provides the puncturer 560 with a symbol stream of length 64.<br>
At this point, the controller 510 provides the puncturer 560 with a control signal instructing it to puncture symbols in the puncturing positions for the (24,1)<br>
code. The puncturer 560 then receives 40 puncturing positions read from the memory 570, and punctures coded symbols in the 40 puncturing positions from the coded symbols of length 64 provided from the repeater 550. That is, the puncturer 560 punctures 40 symbols in the puncturing positions read from the memory 570 among the coded symbols of length 64 provided from the repeater 550. For example, when the puncturing positions from the memory 570 are all the even-numbered symbol positions and the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th symbol positions (as shown in Table 1), the puncturer 560 punctures the even-numbered coded symbols plus the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th coded symbols from the coded symbols of length 64, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
First Embodiment (Decoder)<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a structure of a decoder corresponding to the encoder of FIG. 5. A description of the decoder will be made separately for the respective cases where the encoder serves as a (24,1) decoder to a (24,7) decoder.<br>
First, a description will be made of a case where the decoder serves as the (24,7) decoder corresponding to the (24,7) encoder described in conjunction with FIG. 5. The (24,7) decoder receives a coded symbol stream comprised of 24 coded symbols having a value of'+!' or '-!', encoded by the (24,7) encoder. The received code symbol stream is applied to a zero (0) inserter 650.<br>
Meanwhile, upon receiving predetermined code length information, a controller 630 provides the (24,7) decoder with a control signal instructing it to insert '0', an intermediate value between '+!' and '-!', in the puncturing positions for the (24,7) encoder. The zero inserter 650, under the control of the controller 630, receives information on the 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 7 input information bits from a memory 660. For example, the puncturing positions corresponding to the 7 input information bits are 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th symbol positions or 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th symbol positions.<br>
Therefore, the zero inserter 650 inserts ;0' in the puncturing positions provided from the memory 660 among the 24 coded symbols constituting the received coded symbol stream, and provides the zero-inserted symbol stream having 32 coded symbols to a symbol accumulator 600. The controller 630 then provides the symbol accumulator 600 with a control signal instructing it to accumulate the symbols repeated as many times as a repetition frequency of the<br>
(24,7) encoder. Since the (24,7) encoder has not performed symbol repetition, the symbol accumulator 600 outputs the 32 intact received symbols. The 32 received symbols are provided to a correlation calculator 620, and also provided to multipliers 602, 604 and 606. A mask generator 610 then generates mask function Ml, M2 and M1+M2, all having a length of 32, and provides the mask function Ml to the multiplier 602, the mask function M2 to the multiplier 604 and the mask function M1+M2 to the multiplier 606. The mask functions are varied according to the puncturing positions (or the puncturing pattern). When the puncturing positions are used, the mask functions used in the encoder are used. Then, the multiplier 602 multiplies the received symbols by the mask function Ml in a symbol unit, and the multiplier 604 multiplies the received symbols by the mask function M2 in a symbol unit. Also, the multiplier 606 multiplies the received symbols by the mask function M1+M2 in a symbol unit. A switch 652, under the control of the controller 630, provides the symbol stream output from the multiplier 602 to a correlation calculator 622. A switch 654, under the control of the controller 630, provides the symbol stream output from the multiplier 604 to a correlation calculator 624. A switch 656, under the control of the controller 630, provides the symbol stream output from the multiplier 606 to a correlation calculator 626. Then, the correlation calculator 620 calculates all correlations between the received symbol stream of length 32 and 32 Walsh codes of length 32, and provides a correlation comparator 640 with a Walsh code number having the highest correlation, a correlation value and a mask number '0' indicating that no mask function was used in the preceding stage. The correlation calculator 622 calculates all correlations between a symbol stream determined by multiplying the received symbol stream of length 32 by the mask function Ml and the 32 Walsh codes of length 32, and provides the correlation comparator 640 with a Walsh code number having the highest correlation, a correlation value and a mask number ' 1' indicating the mask number is used in the preceding stage. The correlation calculator 624 calculates all correlations between a symbol stream determined by multiplying the received symbol stream of length 32 by the mask function M2 and the 32 Walsh codes of length 32, and provides the correlation comparator 640 with a  Walsh code number having the highest correlation, a correlation value and a mask number '2' indicating the mask number is used in the preceding stage. The correlation calculator 626 calculates all correlations between a symbol stream determined by multiplying the received symbol stream of length 32 by the mask function M1+M2 and the 32 Walsh codes of length 32, and provides the correlation comparator 640 with a Walsh code number having the highest correlation, a correlation value and a mask<br>
number '3' indicating the mask number is used in the preceding stage. The correlation comparator 640 then selects a largest value among the values received from the correlation calculators 620, 622, 624 and 626, connects the corresponding Walsh code number and mask number, and outputs the connected value as decoded bits.<br>
Second, a description will be made of a case where the decoder serves as the (24,6) decoder corresponding to the (24,6) encoder described in conjunction with FIG. 5. The (24,6) decoder receives a coded symbol stream comprised of 24 coded symbols having a value of'+!' or '-!', encoded by the (24,6) encoder. The received code symbol stream is applied to the zero (0) inserter 650.<br>
Meanwhile, upon receiving predetermined code length information, the controller 630 provides the (24,6) decoder with a control signal instructing it to insert '0', an intermediate value between '+!' and '-!', in the puncturing positions for the (24,6) encoder. The zero inserter 650, under the control of the controller 630, receives information on the 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 6 input information bits from a memory 660. For example, the puncturing positions corresponding to the 6 input information bits are 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th symbol positions.<br>
Therefore, the zero inserter 650 inserts '0' in the puncturing positions provided from the memory 660 among the 24 coded symbols constituting the received coded symbol stream, and provides the zero-inserted symbol stream having 32 coded symbols to the symbol accumulator 600. The controller 630 then provides the symbol accumulator 600 with a control signal instructing it to accumulate the symbols repeated as many times as a repetition frequency of the (24,6) encoder. Since the (24,6) encoder has performed symbol repetition one time, the symbol accumulator 600 outputs the 32 intact received symbols. The 32 received symbols are provided to the correlation calculator 620, and also provided to the multipliers 602, 604 and 606. The mask generator 610 then generates mask function Ml and M2, all having a length of 32, and provides the mask function Ml to the multiplier 602 and the mask function M2 to the multiplier 604. The mask functions are varied according to the puncturing positions (or the puncturing pattern). When the puncturing positions are used, the mask functions used in the encoder are used. Then, the multiplier 602 multiplies the received symbols by the mask function Ml in a symbol unit, and the multiplier 604 multiplies the received symbols by the mask function M2 in a<br>
symbol unit. The switch 652, under the control of the controller 630, provides the symbol stream output from the multiplier 602 to the correlation calculator 622. The switches 654 and 656, under the control of the controller 630, cut off the symbol streams output from the multipliers 604 and 606, so the outputs of the multipliers 604 and 606 are not used . Then, the correlation calculator 620 calculates all correlations between the received symbol stream of length 32 and 32 Walsh codes of length 32, and provides the correlation comparator 640 with a Walsh code number having the highest correlation, a correlation value and a mask number '0' indicating that no mask function was used in the preceding stage. The correlation calculator 622 calculates all correlations between a symbol stream determined by multiplying the received symbol stream of length 32 by the mask function Ml and the 32 Walsh codes of length 32, and provides the correlation comparator 640 with a Walsh code number having the highest correlation, a correlation value and a mask number T indicating the mask number is used in the preceding stage. The correlation comparator 640 then connects the Walsh code number and mask number received from the correlation calculator 620, and outputs the connected value as decoded bits.<br>
Third, a description will be made of a case where the decoder serves as the (24,5) decoder corresponding to the (24,5) encoder described in conjunction with FIG. 5. The (24,5) decoder receives a coded symbol stream comprised of 24 coded symbols having a value of'+!' or '-!', encoded by the (24,5) encoder. The received code symbol stream is applied to the zero (0) inserter 650.<br>
Meanwhile, upon receiving predetermined code length information, the controller 630 provides the (24,5) decoder with a control signal instructing it to insert '0', an intermediate value between '+!' and '-!', in the puncturing positions for the (24,5) encoder. The zero inserter 650, under the control of the controller 630, receives information on the 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 5 input information bits from a memory 660. For example, the puncturing positions corresponding to the 5 input information bits are 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th symbol positions. Therefore, the zero inserter 650 inserts '0' in the puncturing positions provided from the memory 660 among the 24 coded symbols constituting the received coded symbol stream, and provides the zero-inserted symbol stream having 32 coded symbols to the symbol accumulator 600. The controller 630 then provides the symbol accumulator 600 with a control signal instructing it to accumulate the symbols repeated as many times as a repetition frequency of the (24,5) encoder.<br>
Since the (24,5) encoder has performed symbol repetition one time, the symbol accumulator 600 outputs the 32 intact received symbols. The 32 received symbols are provided to the correlation calculator 620, and also provided to the multipliers 602, 604 and 606. Since the switches 652, 654 and 656 at the output nodes of the multipliers 602, 604 and 606 are turned off under the control of the controller 630, the outputs of the multipliers 602, 604 and 606 are cut off, making operations of the multipliers 602, 604 and 606 ineffective. The controller 630 then provides the correlation calculator 620 with a control signal instructing it to calculate correlations between the received symbol stream of length 32 and Walsh codes having the same code length (i.e., Walsh codes of length 32). Then, the correlation calculator 620 calculates all correlations between the received symbol stream of length 32 and 32 Walsh codes of length 32, and provides the correlation comparator 640 with a Walsh code number having the highest correlation, a correlation value and a mask number value of "0". The correlation comparator 640 then connects the Walsh code number and mask number received from the correlation calculator 620, and outputs the connected value as decoded bits.<br>
Fourth, a description will be made of another case where the decoder serves as the (24,4) decoder corresponding to the (24,4) encoder described in conjunction with FIG. 5. The (24,4) decoder receives a coded symbol stream comprised of 24 coded symbols having a value of '+!' or '-!', encoded by the (24,4) encoder. The received code symbol stream is applied to the zero inserter 650.<br>
Meanwhile, upon receiving predetermined code length information, the controller 630 provides the zero inserter 650 with a control signal instructing it to insert '0', an intermediate value between '+!' and '-!', in the puncturing positions for the (24,4) encoder. The zero inserter 650, under the control of the controller 630, receives information on the puncturing positions corresponding to the 4 input information bits from the memory 660. For example, the 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 4 input information bits are 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6lh and 16th symbol positions. Therefore, the zero inserter 650 inserts ;0' in the puncturing positions provided from the memory 660 among the 24 coded symbols constituting the received coded symbol stream, and provides the zero-inserted symbol stream comprised of 32 coded symbols to the symbol accumulator 600. The controller 630 then provides the symbol accumulator 600<br>
with a control signal instructing it to accumulate the symbols repeated as many times as a repetition frequency of the (24,4) encoder.<br>
Since the (24,4) encoder has performed symbol repetition two times, the symbol accumulator 600 accumulates the two symbols in the repeated positions among the 32 received symbols, and outputs a symbol stream of length 16. The 16 received symbols output from the accumulator 600 are provided to the correlation calculator 620, and also provided to the multipliers 602, 604 and 606. The switches 652, 654 and 656 connected to output nodes of the multipliers 602, 604 and 606 are turned OFF under the control of the controller 630, so that the outputs of the multipliers 602, 604 and 606 are not used . The controller 630 then provides the correlation calculator 620 with a control signal instructing it to calculate correlations between the received symbol stream and the Walsh codes having the same length (i.e., Walsh codes of length 16). The correlation calculator 620 then calculates all correlations between the received symbol stream of length 16 and the Walsh codes of length 16, and provides the correlation comparator 640 with a Walsh code number having the highest correlation, a correlation value, and a value of "0" indicating the mask number. The correlation comparator 640 then connects the Walsh code number and the mask number received from the correlation calculator 620, and outputs the connected value as decoded bits.<br>
Fifth, a description will be made of another case where the decoder serves as the (24,3) decoder corresponding to the (24,3) encoder described in conjunction with FIG. 5. The (24,3) decoder receives a coded symbol stream comprised of 24 coded symbols having a value of '+!' or '-!', encoded by the (24,3) encoder. The received code symbol stream is applied to the zero inserter 650.<br>
Meanwhile, upon receiving predetermined code length information, the controller 630 provides the zero inserter 650 with a control signal instructing it to insert '0', an intermediate value between '+!' and '-!', in the puncturing positions for the (24,3) encoder. The zero inserter 650, under the control of the controller 630, receives information on the puncturing positions corresponding to the 3 input information bits from the memory 660. For example, the 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 3 input information bits are 0th, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 16th and 24th symbol positions. Therefore, the zero inserter 650 inserts '0' in the puncturing positions provided from the memory 660 among the 24 coded<br>
symbols constituting the received coded symbol stream, and provides the zero-inserted symbol stream comprised of 32 coded symbols to the symbol accumulator 600. The controller 630 then provides the symbol accumulator 600 with a control signal instructing it to accumulate the symbols repeated as many times as a repetition frequency of the (24,3) encoder.<br>
Since the (24,3) encoder has performed symbol repetition four times, the symbol accumulator 600 accumulates the four symbols in the repeated positions among the 32 received symbols, and outputs a symbol stream of length 8. The received symbols of length 8 output from the accumulator 600 are provided to the correlation calculator 620, and also provided to the multipliers 602, 604 and 606. The switches 652, 654 and 656 connected to output nodes of the multipliers 602, 604 and 606 are turned OFF under the control of the controller 630, so that the outputs of the multipliers 602, 604 and 606 are not used . The controller 630 then provides the correlation calculator 620 with a control signal instructing it to calculate correlations between the received symbol stream and the Walsh codes having the same length (i.e., Walsh codes of length 8). The correlation calculator 620 then calculates all correlations between the received symbol stream of length 8 and the 8 Walsh codes of length 8, and provides the correlation comparator 640 with a Walsh code number having the highest correlation, a correlation value, and a value of "0" indicating the mask number. The correlation comparator 640 then connects the Walsh code number and the mask number received from the correlation calculator 620, and outputs the connected value as decoded bits.<br>
Sixth, a description will be made of another case where the decoder serves as the (24,2) decoder corresponding to the (24,2) encoder described in conjunction with FIG. 5. The (24,2) decoder receives a coded symbol stream comprised of 24 coded symbols having a value of '+!' or '-!', encoded by the (24,2) encoder. The received code symbol stream is applied to the zero inserter 650.<br>
Meanwhile, upon receiving predetermined code length information, the controller 630 provides the zero inserter 650 with a control signal instructing it to insert '0', an intermediate value between '+!' and '-!', in the puncturing positions for the (24,2) encoder. The zero inserter 650, under the control of the controller 630, receives information on the puncturing positions corresponding to the 2 input information bits from the memory 660. For example, the 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the 2 input information bits are 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th,<br>
20th, 24th and 28th symbol positions. Therefore, the zero inserter 650 inserts '0' in the puncturing positions provided from the memory 660 among the 24 coded symbols constituting the received coded symbol stream, and provides the zero-inserted symbol stream comprised of 32 coded symbols to the symbol accumulator 600. The controller 630 then provides the symbol accumulator 600 with a control signal instructing it to accumulate the symbols repeated as many times as a repetition frequency of the (24,2) encoder.<br>
Since the (24,2) encoder has performed symbol repetition eight times, the symbol accumulator 600 accumulates the eight symbols in the repeated positions among the 32 received symbols, and outputs a symbol stream of length 4. The received symbols of length 4 output from the accumulator 600 are provided to the correlation calculator 620, and also provided to the multipliers 602, 604 and 606. The switches 652, 654 and 656 connected to output nodes of the multipliers 602, 604 and 606 are turned OFF under the control of the controller 630, so that the outputs of the multipliers 602, 604 and 606 are not used . The controller 630 then provides the correlation calculator 620 with a control signal instructing it to calculate correlations between the received symbol stream and the Walsh codes having the same length (i.e., Walsh codes of length 4). The correlation calculator 620 then calculates all correlations between the received symbol stream of length 4 and the 4 Walsh codes of length 4, and provides the correlation comparator 640 with a Walsh code number having the highest correlation, a correlation value, and a value of "0" indicating the mask number. The correlation comparator 640 then connects the Walsh code number and the mask number received from the correlation calculator 620, and outputs the connected value as decoded bits.<br>
Seventh, a description will be made of another case where the decoder serves as the (24,1) decoder corresponding to the (24,1) encoder described in conjunction with FIG. 5. The (24,1) decoder receives a coded symbol stream comprised of 24 coded symbols having a value of '+!' or '-!', encoded by the (24,1) encoder. The received code symbol stream is applied to the zero inserter 650.<br>
Meanwhile, upon receiving predetermined code length information, the controller 630 provides the zero inserter 650 with a control signal instructing it to insert '0', an intermediate value between '+1' and '-1', in the puncturing positions for the (24,1) encoder. The zero inserter 650, under the control of the<br>
controller 630, receives information on the puncturing positions corresponding to the 1 input information bit from the memory 660. For example, the puncturing positions corresponding to the 1 input information bit are all the even-numbered symbol positions and 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th symbol positions. Therefore, the zero inserter 650 inserts '0' in the puncturing positions provided from the memory 660 among the 24 coded symbols constituting the received coded symbol stream, and provides the zero-inserted symbol stream comprised of 64 coded symbols to the symbol accumulator 600. The controller 630 then provides the symbol accumulator 600 with a control signal instructing it to accumulate the symbols repeated as many times as a repetition frequency of the (24,1) encoder.<br>
Since the (24,1) encoder has performed symbol repetition 32 times, the symbol accumulator 600 accumulates the 32 symbols in the repeated positions among the 64 received symbols, and outputs a symbol stream of length 2. The received symbols of length 2 output from the accumulator 600 are provided to the correlation calculator 620, and also provided to the multipliers 602, 604 and 606. The switches 652, 654 and 656 connected to output nodes of the multipliers 602, 604 and 606 are turned OFF under the control of the controller 630, so that the outputs of the multipliers 602, 604 and 606 are not used. The controller 630 then provides the correlation calculator 620 with a control signal instructing it to calculate correlations between the received symbol stream and the Walsh codes having the same length (i.e., Walsh codes of length 2). The correlation calculator 620 then calculates all correlations between the received symbol stream of length 2 and the 2 Walsh codes of length 2, and provides the correlation comparator 640 with a Walsh code number having the highest correlation, a correlation value, and a value of "0" indicating the mask number. The correlation comparator 640 then connects the Walsh code number and the mask number received from the correlation calculator 620, and outputs the connected value as decoded bits.<br>
Second Embodiment (Encoder)<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a structure of an encoder serving as all of the (24,1) encoder to the (24,7) encoder having different lengths according to a second embodiment of the present invention. That is, the encoder of FIG. 9 encodes 1 to 7 input information bits with different Walsh codes or masks having a length of 32, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. Unlike the encoder according to the first embodiment, the encoder according to the second embodiment does not include the symbol repeater.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, a controller 1110 controls an encoding operation by determining the number of the input information bits. That is, the controller 1110 provides a puncturer 1160 with a control signal instructing it to puncture symbols in 8 puncturing positions corresponding to the input information bits. A Walsh code generator 1100 generates Walsh codes of length 32. For example, upon receiving the input information bits, the Walsh code generator 1100 generates 5 different Walsh codes of length 32. A mask generator 1105 generates masks of length 32. For example, upon receiving the input information bits, the mask generator 1105 generates 2 different masks of length 32.<br>
Multipliers 1120-1132 multiply the 1 to 7 input information bits by the Walsh codes and the masks from the Walsh code generator 1100 and the mask generator 1105 on a one-to-one basis, and output coded symbol streams each having 32 coded symbols. An XOR operator 1140 XORs the coded symbol streams from the multipliers 1120-1132, and outputs one coded symbol stream having 32 coded symbols. The coded symbol stream of length 32 output from the XOR operator 1140 is provided to the puncturer 1160. A memory 1170 stores 8 puncturing positions corresponding to each of the 1 to 7 input information bits.<br>
Shown in Table 23 are puncturing positions associated with the number of the input information bits, stored in a memory table of the memory 1170.<br>
Table 23<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The puncturer 1160 receives the coded symbol stream having 32 coded symbols from the XOR operator 1140, punctures coded symbols in the 8 puncturing positions read from the memory 1170 from the 32 coded symbols under the control of the controller 1110, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. That is, if the number of the input information bits is 1, the puncturer 1160 punctures the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from the XOR operator 1140 under the control of the controller 1110, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. If the number of the input information bits is 2, the puncturer 1160 punctures the 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th 24th and 28th symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from the XOR operator 1140 under the control of the controller 1110, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. If the number of the input information bits is 2, the puncturer 1160 punctures the 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th 24th and 28th symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from the XOR operator 1140 under the control of the controller 1110, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. If the number of the input information bits is 3, the puncturer 1160 punctures the 0th, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 16th and 24th symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from the XOR operator 1140 under the control of the controller 1110, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. If the number of the input information bits is 4, the puncturer 1160 punctures the 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 16th symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from the XOR operator 1140 under the control of the controller 1110, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols. If the number of the input information bits is 5, the puncturer 1160 punctures the 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th symbols from the 32 coded symbols output from the XOR operator 1140 under the control of the controller 1110, and outputs a coded symbol stream having 24 coded symbols.

With reference to FIG. 9, a description of the encoder will be made separately for the respective cases where the encoder serves as a (24,1) encoder to a (24,7) encoder. It will be assumed herein that the input information bits applied to the encoder constitute a rate indicator.<br>
First, a description will be made of a case where the encoder serves as the (24,7) encoder. A 7-bit rate indicator of aO, al, a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 is applied<br>
to the encoder. The Walsh code generator 1100 then generates Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4, W8 and W16 of length 32. The Walsh code generator 1100 may operate either under the control of the controller 1110 or without separate control. FIG. 9 illustrates an example where the Walsh code generator 1100 operates without separate control. The Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4, W8 and W16 generated by the Walsh code generator 1100 are provided to the associated multipliers, respectively. To be specific, the Walsh code Wl is provided to the multiplier 1120, the Walsh code W2 to the multiplier 1122, the Walsh code W4 to the multiplier 1124, the Walsh code W8 to the multiplier 1126, and the Walsh code W16 to the multiplier 1128.

At the same time, the mask generator 1105 generates a mask Ml= 0111 0111 0010 0100 0110 OOOO OOOO OOOO and a mask M2= 0010 0110 0101 0100 0101 0100 0100 OOOO, and provides the generated masks Ml and M2 to the multipliers 1130 and 1132, respectively.<br>
Meanwhile, the 7 input information bits of the rate indicator are provided to the associated multipliers, respectively. Shown in Table 25 are the relations between the 7 input information bits and the associated multipliers.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The multipliers multiply the input information bits by the Walsh codes or masks, provided thereto as shown in Table 26, and provide their outputs to the XOR operator 1140. Specifically, the multiplier 1120 multiplies the input information bit aO by the Walsh code Wl every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 1140. The multiplier 1122 multiplies the input information bit al by the Walsh code W2 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 1140.

The multiplier 1132 multiplies the input information bit a6 by the mask M2 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 1140.<br>
The XOR operator 1140 then XORs the symbol streams of length 32 output from the multipliers 1120, 1122, 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130 and 1132 in a symbol unit, and provides its output to the puncturer 1160.<br>
The coded symbol stream Ws of length 32, output from the XOR operator 1140, is then defined as<br>
Equation 15 (Equation  Removed)<br>
At this moment, the controller 1110 provides the puncturer 1160 with a control signal instructing it to puncture symbols in the puncturing positions for the (24,7) code. The puncturer 1160 then receives 8 puncturing positions from the memory 1170, and punctures coded symbols in the 8 puncturing positions from the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the XOR operator 1140. That is, the puncturer 1160 punctures 8 symbols in the puncturing positions read from the memory 1170 among the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the XOR operator 1140. For example, when the puncturing positions from the memory 1170 are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4lh, 5th, 6th and 7th symbol positions, the puncturer 1160 punctures 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th coded symbols from the coded symbols of length 32, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
Second, a description will be made of a case where the encoder serves as the (24,6) encoder. A 6-bit rate indicator of aO, al, a2, a3, a4 and a5 is applied to the encoder, and the remaining rate indicator bit a6 applied to the encoder is initialized to 0. The Walsh code generator 1100 then generates Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4, W8 and W16 of length 32. The Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4, W8 and W16 generated by the Walsh code generator 1100 are provided to the associated multipliers, respectively. To be specific, the Walsh code Wl is provided to the multiplier 1120, the Walsh code W2 to the multiplier 1122, the Walsh code W4 to the multiplier 1124, the Walsh code W8 to the multiplier 1126, and the Walsh code W16 to the multiplier 1128. Shown in Table 27 are the Walsh codes of length 32 generated by the Walsh code generator 1100.<br>

At the same time, the mask generator 1105 generates a mask Ml =0111 0111 0010 0100 0110 OOOO OOOO OOOO, and provides the generated mask Ml to<br>
the multiplier 1130.<br>

Therefore, shown in Table 29 are the input information bits and the Walsh codes or mask provided to the respective multipliers.<br>
Table 29<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The multipliers multiply the input information bits by the Walsh codes or mask, provided thereto as shown in Table 29, and provide their outputs to the XOR operator 1140. Specifically, the multiplier 1120 multiplies the input information bit aO by the Walsh code Wl every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 1140. The multiplier 1122 multiplies the input information bit al by the Walsh code W2 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 1140. The multiplier 1124 multiplies the input information bit a2 by the Walsh code W4 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 1140. The multiplier 1126 multiplies the input information bit a3 by the Walsh code W8 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 1140. The multiplier 1128 multiplies the input information bit a4 by the Walsh code W16 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 1140. The multiplier<br>
1130 multiplies the input information bit a5 by the mask Ml every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 1140.<br>
Meanwhile, since the input information bit a6 applied to the multiplier 1132 is initialized to 0, an output of the multiplier 1132 does not affect the output of the XOR operator 1140 regardless of the mask M2 from the mask generator 1105. That is, the multiplier 1132 outputs a symbol stream comprised of coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of symbol values of the symbol stream from the mask generator 1105. Therefore, the output of the multiplier 1132 does not affect the output of the XOR operator 1140. Initializing the input information bit a6 to 0 is equivalent to a switching operation for cutting off the output of the multiplier 1132.<br>
The XOR operator 1140 then XORs the symbol streams of length 32 output from the multipliers 1120, 1122, 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130 and 1132 in a symbol unit, and provides its output to the puncturer 1160.<br>
The coded symbol stream Ws of length 32, output from the XOR operator 1140, is then defined as<br>
Equation 16 (Equation  Removed)<br><br>
At this moment, the controller 1110 provides the puncturer 1160 with a control signal instructing it to puncture symbols in the puncturing positions for the (24,6) code.

That is, the puncturer 1160 punctures 8 symbols in the puncturing positions read from the memory 1170 among the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the XOR operator 1140. For example, when the puncturing positions from the memory 1170 are 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24Ih and 28th symbol positions, the puncturer 1160 punctures 0th, 4th, 8lh, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28lh coded symbols from the coded symbols of length 32, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
Alternatively, however, the (24,6) encoder may puncture the 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th coded symbols from the coded symbol stream of length 32 in order to reduce hardware complexity. In this case, the mask generator 1105<br>
generates a mask Ml-0000 0000 1110 1000 1101 1000 1100 0000. For example, when the puncturing positions from the memory 1170 are 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th symbol positions, the puncturer 1160 punctures 0th, ls!, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th coded symbols from the coded symbols of length 32, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
Third, a description will be made of a case where the encoder serves as the (24,5) encoder. A 5-bit rate indicator of aO, al, a2, a3 and a4 is applied to the encoder, and the remaining rate indicator bits a5 and a6 applied to the encoder are initialized to 0. The Walsh code generator 1100 then generates Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4, W8 and W16 of length 32. The Walsh codes Wl, W2, W4, W8 and W16 generated by the Walsh code generator 1100 are provided to the associated multipliers, respectively. To be specific, the Walsh code Wl is provided to the multiplier 1120, the Walsh code W2 to the multiplier 1122, the Walsh code W4 to the multiplier 1124, the Walsh code W8 to the multiplier 1126, and the Walsh code W16 to the multiplier 1128.

The multiplier 1128 multiplies the input information bit a4 by the Walsh code W16 every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 1140.<br>
Meanwhile, since the input information bits a5 and a6 applied to the multipliers 1130 and 1132 are initialized to 0, outputs of the multipliers 1130 and 1132 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 1140 regardless of the masks Ml and M2 from the mask generator 1105. That is, the multipliers 1130 and 1132 output symbol streams each comprised of coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of symbol values of the symbol streams from the mask generator 1105. Therefore, the outputs of the multipliers 1130 and 1132 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 1140. Initializing the input information bits a5 and a6 to 0 is equivalent to a switching operation for cutting off the output of the multipliers 1130 and 1132.<br>
The XOR operator 1140 then XORs the symbol streams of length 32 output from the multipliers 1120, 1122, 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130 and 1132 in a symbol unit, and provides its output to the puncturer 1160.<br>

Therefore, the outputs of the multipliers 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130 and 1132 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 1140. Initializing the input information bits a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 to 0 is equivalent to a switching operation for cutting off the output of the multipliers 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130 and 1132.<br>
The XOR operator 1140 then XORs the symbol streams of length 32 output from the multipliers 1120, 1122, 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130 and 1132 in a symbol unit, and provides its output to the puncturer 1160.<br>
The coded symbol stream Ws of length 32, output from the XOR operator 1140, is then defined as<br>
Equation 20 (Equation  Removed) At this moment, the ontroller 1110 provides the puncturer 1160 with a control signal instructing it to puncture symbols in the puncturing positions for the (24,2) code. The puncturer 1160 then receives 8 puncturing positions from the memory 1170, and punctures coded symbols in the 8 puncturing positions from the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the XOR operator 1140. That is, the puncturer 1160 punctures 8 symbols in the puncturing positions read from the memory 1170 among the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the XOR operator 1140. For example, when the puncturing positions from the memory 1170 are 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th and 28th symbol positions, the puncturer 1160 punctures 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16*, 20lh, 24th and 28th coded symbols from the coded symbols of length 32, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>
Seventh, a description will be made of a case where the encoder serves as the (24,1) encoder. A 1-bit rate indicator of aO is applied to the encoder, and the<br>
remaining rate indicator bits al, a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 applied to the encoder are initialized to 0. The Walsh code generator 1100 then generates a Walsh code Wl of length 32. The Walsh code Wl generated by the Walsh code generator 1100 is provided to the associated multiplier. To be specific, the Walsh code Wl is provided to the multiplier 1120. Shown in Table 42 is the Walsh code of length 32 generated by the Walsh code generator 1100.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Meanwhile, the 1 input information bit of the rate indicator is provided to the associated multiplier. Shown in Table 43 is the relation between the 1 input information bit and the associated multiplier.<br>
Table 43<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Therefore, shown in Table 44 are the input information bit and the Walsh code provided to the multiplier.<br>
Table 44<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The multiplier multiplies the input information bit by the Walsh code, provided thereto as shown in Table 44, and provides its output to the XOR operator 1140. Specifically, the multiplier 1120 multiplies the input information bit aO by the Walsh code Wl every symbol, and provides its output to the XOR operator 1140.<br>
Meanwhile, since the input information bits al, a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 applied to the multiplier 1122, 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130 and 1132 are initialized to 0, outputs of the multipliers 1122, 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130 and 1132 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 1140 regardless of the Walsh codes W2, W4, W8 and W16 from the Walsh code generator 1100 and the masks Ml and M2 from the mask generator 1105. That is, the multipliers 1122, 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130<br>
and 1132 output symbol streams each comprised of coded symbols all having a value '0' regardless of symbol values of the symbol streams from the Walsh code generator 1100 and the mask generator 1105. Therefore, the outputs of the multipliers 1122, 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130 and 1132 do not affect the output of the XOR operator 1140. Initializing the input information bits al, a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 to 0 is equivalent to a switching operation for cutting off the output of the multipliers 1122, 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130 and 1132.<br>
The XOR operator 1140 then XORs the symbol streams of length 32 output from the multipliers 1120, 1122, 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130 and 1132 in a symbol unit, and provides its output to the puncturer 1160.<br>
The coded symbol stream Ws of length 32, output from the XOR operator 1140, is then defined as<br>
Equation 21 (Table Removed)At this moment, the controller 1110 provides the puncturer 1160 with a control signal instructing it to puncture symbols in the puncturing positions for the (24,1) code. The puncturer 1160 then receives 8 puncturing positions from the memory 1170, and punctures coded symbols in the 8 puncturing positions from the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the XOR operator 1140. That is, the puncturer 1160 punctures 8 symbols in the puncturing positions read from the memory 1170 among the coded symbols of length 32 provided from the XOR operator 1140. For example, when the puncturing positions from the memory 1170 are 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th symbol positions, the puncturer 1160 punctures 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th coded symbols from the coded symbols of length 32, and outputs 24 coded symbols.<br>

Further, the present invention utilizes an apparatus and method of puncturing an extended first order Reed-Muller code, so that an inverse fast Hadamard transform is used in a decoding process, thereby making it possible to minimize hardware complexity and generate an optimal code in terms of error correcting<br><br>
