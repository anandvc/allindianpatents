Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)   inhibitor.<br>
Background Art<br>
Serious problems associated with cancer chemotherapy include intrinsic resistance to an anticancer drug, which invalidates the effect of the anticancer drug from the beginning of cancer therapy, and development of acquired resistance to an anticancer drug (i.e., reduction of the effect of the drug, which is caused by long-term continuous administration thereof). Overcoming such anticancer drug resistance has been envisaged to lead to improvement of the performance of cancer chemotherapy, and thus attempts have been made to elucidate various resistance mechanisms. Particularly, expression of a drug transporter, which actively transports an anticancer drug out of cancer cells, thereby reducing the amount of intracellular accumulation of the drug, is considered to play an important role in such a resistance mechanism.<br>
Particularly, P-glycoprotein, which is a drug transporter discovered in the 1970s, and is encoded by an MDRl   gene, has been considered a potent target molecule of a<br><br><br>
multidrug-resistance-overcoming agent, since this protein causes cross-resistance to a plurality of anticancer drugs having different chemical structures and action mechanisms. However, it has been gradually elucidated that a drug transporter other than P-glycoprotein is also associated with an anticancer drug resistance mechanism, and demand has arisen for development of a resistance-overcoming agent which targets such a drug transporter.<br>
Under such circumstances, there was discovered, in 1998, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which is a drug transporter belonging to a group which is called "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily" to which P-glycoprotein also belongs (see Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 15665-15670 (1998)). BCRP has a structure including only one ATP-binding cassette, which differs from that of P-glycoprotein or another drug transporter, which has two ATP-binding cassettes. BCRP is intimately involved in the mechanism of resistance to a topoisomerase I inhibitor (e.g., irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11) or topotecan) or to a topoisomerase II inhibitor (e.g., mitoxantrone). Meanwhile, BCRP has been elucidated to exhibit substrate specificity different from that of P-glycoprotein, since BCRP does not act on, for example, paclitaxel or vincristine, which is excreted by P-glycoprotein, and BCRP is involved in excretion of a camptothecJn derivative (e.g., CPT-11 or 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38: active metabolite of CPT-11)), which is rarely excreted extracellularly by P-glycoprotein<br><br>
(see Cancer Res. 59, 5938-5946 (1999)).  In addition, BCRP has been suggested to be involved in the limitation of the bioavailability of an orally administered anticancer drug (see J. Clin. Oncol. 20, 2943-2950 (2002)).  In view of the foregoing, demand has arisen for development of a BCRP inhibitor, which is envisaged to exhibit the effect of overcoming anticancer drug resistance that is not overcome by a conventional resistance-overcoming agent, and to improve the bioavailability of an anticancer drug.<br>
Hitherto, a variety of P-glycoprotein inhibitors have been developed for the purpose of overcoming anticancer drug resistance. However, since few BORP-specific inhibitors have been reported, and such inhibitors have been considered to exhibit unsatisfactory BCRP-inhibiting effect, demand has arisen for a drug which exhibits more potent BCRP-inhibiting effect (see Mol. Cancer. Ther. 1, 427-434 (2002)). Incidentally, some diphenylacrylonitrile derivatives have been reported to exhibit anticancer effect (see J. Med. Chem. 41, 3022-3032 (1998). However, a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative exhibiting anticancer-drug-resistance-overcoming effect or BCRP-inhibiting effect has not yet been known.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a BCRP inhibitor.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
With an aim to attain the above object, the present inventors have screened a variety of compounds through use of<br><br>
a cancer cell line whose anticancer drug resistance has been imparted by BCRP, and have found that the diphenylacrylonitrile derivatives represented by the following formula (1) exhibit potent BCflP-inhibiting effect. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a BCRP inhibitor containing, as an active ingredient, a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative represented by the following formula (1) or a salt thereof:<br>

The diphenylacrylonitrile derivatives (I), or salts thereof, of the present invention may, for example, be prepared through the following reaction scheme.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br><br><br><br><br><br>
(wherein R has the same meaning as described above).<br>
That is, a benzaldehyde (2) and a benzyl cyanide (3) are subjected to a condensation reaction, to thereby yield a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative (1). However, when the target compound is a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative (1) in which R is a hydroxyl group, an R-protected benzaldehyde (2) and an R-protected benzyl cyanide (3) (wherein the protective group may be, for example, a methoxymethoxy group, a<br>
methoxyethoxymethoxy group, a methylthiomethoxy group, a tetrahydropyranyloxy group, a cyclopropylmethoxy group, a benzyloxy group, a trimethylsilyloxy group, or a tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy group) are subjected to a condensation reaction, followed by removal of the protective groups.<br>
The condensation reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium alkoxide, sodium hydroxide, or potassium hydroxide. When sodium alkoxide is employed, the condensation reaction is performed in an alcoholic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol, at between room temperature and reflux temperature, whereas when sodium hydroxide is employed, the condensation reaction is performed in a solvent mixture of water and an inert solvent, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, with a quaternary ammonium salt or a similar compound being added thereto.<br>
After completion of condensation reaction, the hydroxy-protective group is removed. The removal is preferably achieved by hydrolysis in the presence of, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, or trifluoroacetic acid. Also, the benzyloxy group is preferably deprotected through catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium carbon, or platinum oxide.<br>
The diphenylacrylonitrile compound of the present invention may be administered as is. Alternatively, so long as the effects of the present invention are not reduced, the diphenylacrylonitrile compound may be mixed with a carrier<br>
which is generally employed for drug preparation, such as a dispersing aid or an excipient, and may be used in the form of an injection or a peroral preparation such as a powder, a solution, a capsule, a suspension, an emulsion, a syrup, an elixir, a granule, a pill, a tablet, a troche, or a lemonade.<br>
Examples of such a carrier include water-soluble monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides, such as mannitol, lactose, and dextran; gel-forming or water-soluble celluloses, such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, and methyl cellulose; water-absorbing and poorly water-soluble celluloses, such as<br>
crystalline cellulose, a-cellulose, cross-linked carboxymethylcellulose sodium, and derivatives thereof; water-absorbing and poorly water-soluble polysaccharides, such as hydroxypropyl starch, carboxymethyl starch, cross-linked starch, amylose, amylopectin, pectin, and derivatives thereof; water-absorbing and poorly water-soluble gums, such as gum arabi, tragacanth gum, glucomannan, and derivatives thereof; cross-linked vinyl polymers, such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cross-linked polyacrylic acid and salts thereof, cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol, polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate, and derivatives thereof; and molecular aggregate (e.g., liposome)-forming lipids, such as phosphorlipid and cholesterol.<br>
When the d3.phenylacrylonitrile compound of the present invention exhibits low solubility, the compound may be subjected to solubilization. Examples of the solubilization<br>
technique include techniques which are generally applicable to drugs, such as a technique in which a surfactant (e.g., a polyoxyethylene alcohol ether, a polyoxyethylene acyl ester, a sorbitan acyl ester, or a polyoxyethylene sorbitan acyl ester) is added to the diphenylacrylonitrile compound, and a technique employing a water-soluble polymer (e.g., polyethylene glycol).  If desired, there may be employed, for example, a technique for forming a soluble salt of the diphenylacrylonitrile compound, or a technique for forming a clathrate compound by use of cyclodextrin or a similar material. A solubilization technique may be appropriately selected in accordance with the target diphenylacrylonitrile compound.<br>
The BCRP inhibitor may be employed as an anticancer-drug-resistance-overcoming agent for a cancer which has acquired BCRP-mediated resistance through administration of an anticancer drug. Meanwhile, the BCRP inhibitor may be employed as an anticancer-drug-effeet-enhancing agent for a cancer which originally expresses BCRP and exhibits low sensitivity to an anticancer drug. No particular limitations are imposed on the target anticancer drug of an anticancer-drug-resistance-overcoming agent or anticancer-drug-effeet-enhancing agent containing the BCRP inhibitor as an active ingredient, so long as the anticancer drug can serve as a substrate for BCRP (hereinafter may be referred to as BCRP substrate). Examples of such an anticancer drug include topoisomerase I inhibitors such as irinotecan<br>
hydrochloride/CPT-11 (active metabolite: SN-38) and topotecan; topoisomerase II inhibitors such as mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, bisanthrene, and etoposide; and antifolates such as methotrexate.<br>
The dose of the BCRP inhibitor of the present invention may be appropriately determined in accordance with, for example, the administration method or the symptom of a patient. The daily dose for an adult is preferably 1 mg to 10 g, more preferably 100 mg to 10 g, particularly preferably 500 mg to 10 g. No particular limitations are imposed on the ratio between an anticancer drug and the BCRP inhibitor, and the preferred ratio varies in accordance with, for example, the type of an anticancer drug or inhibitor to be employed. When, for example, irinotecan hydrochloride is employed as an anticancer drug, the ratio by weight of the anticancer drug to the BCRP inhibitor is preferably 1:1 to 1:500, particularly preferably 1:1 to 1:100, more preferably 1:1 to 1 :10.<br>

Examples<br>
The present invention will next be described in more detail by way of Examples, which should not be construed as limiting the invention thereto. Example 1: Production of diphenylacrylonitrile derivative<br>
When a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative was synthesized from a raw material having a hydroxyl group (a benzaldehyde derivative or a benzyl cyanide derivative), firstly, the hydroxyl group was protected through the below-described protection process; subsequently, the resultant product was subjected to a condensation process; and finally, the protective group was removed through a deprotection process. When a raw material having no hydroxyl group was employed, the raw material was subjected to the condensation process without being subjected to the protection process.

(Figure Removed)<br>
X=-CHO, -CH,.CN     MEM = methoxyethoxymethyl In a reaction vessel, a benzaldehyde derivative or benzyl cyanide derivative having a hydroxyl group was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran under stirring. The reaction vessel was ice-cooled, and sodium hydride (content: 60%, suspended in oil) was gradually added in an amount depending on the hydroxyl group number (e.g., 1.2 eguivalents (OH-basis) for the case where the hydroxyl group number is one, or 2.4 equivalents for the case where the hydroxyl group number is two) . Thereafter, a calcium chloride tube was provided on the reaction vessel. After completion of generation of hydrogen, 2-methoxyethoxymethyl chloride was added in an amount depending on the hydroxyl group number (e.g., 1 equivalent (OH-basis) for the case where the hydroxyl group number is one, or 2 eguivalents for the case where the hydroxyl group number is two) . Subsequently, diisopropylamine was added in an amount stoichiometrically equivalent to that of the added 2-methoxyethoxymethyl chloride.  The resultant mixture was refluxed under heating for two hours, with a calcium chloride tube being provided on the reaction vessel. After the resultant product was cooled, insoluble matter was removed through filtration.  The resultant tetrahydrofuran solution was concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure.  The thus-concentrated product was partitioned between chloroform and brine. An aqueous sodium hydroxide solution was added to the thus-obtained chloroform layer, and the resultant mixture was<br>
partitioned. The resultant chloroform layer was washed with water twice. The chloroform layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and then concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. By means of silica gel column chromatography, the thus-concentrated product was subjected to elution with hexane/chloroform to chloroform. The thus-obtained fraction was concentrated, to thereby yield an oily product.<br>

(Figure Removed)<br>
Process A: A benzaldehyde derivative and a benzyl cyanide derivative, in stoichiometrically equivalent amounts, were placed in a reaction vessel, and ethanol was added to the container.  Subsequently, a calcium chloride tube was provided on the container, and the derivatives were dissolved in the ethanol under stirring. Separately, metallic sodium was weighed in a container containing n-hexane, the sodium was gradually added to a container containing ethanol, and a calcium chloride tube was provided on the container. After the sodium was completely dissolved in the ethanol, the resultant sodium ethoxide solution was added to the<br>
aforementioned reaction vessel. The reaction mixture was refluxed for about one hour. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and water was added to the mixture, followed by removal of ethanol through evaporation under reduced pressure. The resultant residue was partitioned between chloroform and brine. Brine was added to the thus-separated chloroform layer, and the resultant mixture was partitioned. The thus-separated chloroform layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, followed by filtration. A small amount of silica gel for column chromatography was added to the resultant filtrate, followed by shaking and filtration. The solvent was removed through evaporation under reduced pressure.  The resultant product was dissolved in ethanol, and an appropriate amount of activated carbon was added to the resultant solution. The resultant mixture was subjected to filtration by use of a celite pad, and the filtrate was concentrated.  The thus-precipitated crystals of a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative were subjected to filtration under reduced pressure. This procedure was performed three times, and the resultant crystals were separated. The thus-precipitated crystals were recrystallized from isopropanol twice.  The resultant crystals were washed with hexane, and then dried. Process B: A benzaldehyde derivative and a benzyl cyanide derivative, in stoichiometrically equivalent amounts, were placed in a reaction vessel, and these derivatives were dissolved in methylene chloride. An aqueous solution (10 to<br><br>
20 mL) of sodium hydroxide (1.2 eq.) was added to the resultant solution, along with methyltrioctylammonium chloride (1/5 eq.), followed by stirring at room temperature for four hours. After completion of reaction, the resultant reaction mixture was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and then subjected to filtration, followed by concentration of the filtrate.  The resultant residue was recrystallized from isopropanol.<br>

A diphenylacrylonitrile derivative having a protected hydroxyl group was dissolved in ethanol, and a small amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to the resultant solution, followed by stirring for a whole day and night.

Human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cell line was subcultured at 5% C02 and 37°C by use of a Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 jig/mL of streptomycin (10% FBS/Ham's F-12).  SN-38-resistant A549 cell<br><br>
Klines were selected by subculturing the A549 cell line in a medium for two months while the concentration of SN-38 contained in the medium was increased in a stepwise manner (4 to 10 ng/mL). Subsequently, the resultant SN-38-resistant A549 cell lines were subjected to cloning by means of limiting dilution, to thereby establish six cloned SN-38-resistant A549 cell lines (A549/SN-38-1 to 6).<br>
Example 3: Anticancer drug sensitivity test of A549/SN-38 cell line<br>
The A549 cell line or each of the A549/SN-38-1 to 6 was suspended in 10% FBS/Ham's F-12, and the resultant suspension was inoculated into a 96-well microplate, followed by culturing at 5% CC&gt;2 and 37°C overnight.  Thereafter, a solution of an anticancer drug in 10% FBS/Ham's F-12 (50 |4.L) was added to each of the wells, followed by culturing at 5%<br>
C02 and 37°C for 48 hours. After completion of culturing, the number of viable cells was counted by use of a viable cell counting reagent [TetraColor ONE (trade name), product of Seikagaku Corporation] according to the attached instruction manual. Table 2 and Fig. 1 show the sensitivities of the A549 cell line and the six A549/SN-38 cell lines to various anticancer drugs.  "Idso" corresponds to the concentration of an anticancer drug required for 50% inhibition of cell growth. "Relative resistance value" is obtained by dividing the ICso for an A549/SN-38 cell line by the IC50 for the A549 cell line. The greater the relative resistance value, the higher<br><br>
"the level of acquired resistance. The A549/SN-38 cell lines exhibited particularly strong resistance to SN-38 and mitoxantrone, which are BCRP substrates.<br>

Example 4: RT-PCR analysis of A549/SN-38 cell line<br>
RT-PCR was performed for analyzing the expression of mRNA of a drug transporter in the A549 cell line, the six A549/SN-38 cell lines, and human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line, which is known to express BCRP. The total RNA was extracted from cells by use of an RNA extraction reagent fISOGEN (trade name), product of Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.], and RT-PCR was performed by use of an RT-PCR reagent [Ready To Go RT-PCR Beads (trade name), product of Amersham pharmacia biotech] and a thermal cycler [iCycler (trade mane), product<br>
'of BIO-RAD] according to the attached instruction manual<br>
(total RNA: 0.5 ug) . The resultant PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis by use of 2% agarose gel, and then staining with ethidium bromide, followed by detection by use of a transilluminator.  In addition, real-time RT-PCR was performed by use of a real-time RT-PCR reagent [SYBR Green RT-PCR Reagents (trade name), product of Applied Biosystems] and a sequence detection system [ABI PRISM 7000 (trade name), product of Applied Biosystems] according to the attached instruction manual, for quantitative analysis (total RNA: 0.1 fig) .  PCR primers corresponding to BCRP, MDR1, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and G3PDH (endogenous control gene) were designed on the basis of the following known mRNA base sequences<br>
(accession Nos. AF098951, AF016535, L05628, U63970, AF009670, and M33197), respectively.  Fig. 2 shows the results of the RT-PCR, and Fig. 3 shows the results of the real-time RT-PCR. Expression of BCRP was remarkably increased in all the six A549/SN-38 cell lines, as compared with the case of the A549 cell line.  In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the level of expression of MRP2 (whose substrate is SN-38, which is also a BCRP substrate) between the A549 cell line and the A549/SN-38 cell lines. Meanwhile, no significant difference was observed in the level of expression of the other drug transporters between the A549 cell line and the A549/SN-38 cell lines.  These results suggest that BCRP is involved in the anticancer drug resistance mechanism of the A549/SN-38 cell lines.  Through<br>
"the above RT-PCR analysis, expression of BCRP was found in the human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line.  In addition to the studies on expression of the aforementioned drug transporters, expression of topoisomerase-I, topoisomerase-II, Bcl-2, Bax,<br>
or iKBa was studied by means of western blotting, and topoisomerase-I activity was studied on the basis of DMA relaxation reaction. However, there were not obtained data suggesting that these proteins are involved in the anticancer drug resistance mechanism of the A549/SN-38 cell lines.<br>
Example 5: Amount of anticancer drug accumulated in A549/SN-38 cell line<br>
The A549 cell line or the A549/SN-38-4 cell line (4 x 1C)6 cells/mL) was suspended in 10% FBS/RPMI1640 (1 mL) , and<br>
an SN-38 DMSO solution (1 (O.L, final concentration: 300 ng/mL) was added to the resultant suspension, followed by incubation<br>
at 37°C for 60 minutes. Thereafter, centrifugation was performed (2°C, 1,400 x g, 1 min), and the resultant supernatant was removed.  Ice-cooled PBS was added to the thus-precipitated cells, and the cells were resuspended therein, followed by centrifugation (2°C, 1,400 x g, 1 min) for washing of the cells. This washing procedure was<br>
performed again, followed by addition of PBS (375 uL) and sonication of the cells.  To the resultant cell sonicate,<br>
methanol (375 jiL) and 10% zinc sulfate solution (15 (J.L) were added, and the resultant mixture was stirred, followed by<br>
centrifugation (2°C, 12,500 x g, 5 min) and collection of the<br>
Supernatant. The thus-collected supernatant was dispensed in a white 96-well microplate for fluorescence intensity<br>
measurement (200 (a/well), and then the amounts of SN-38 and an SN-38-glucuronide contained in the supernatant were measured by use of a microplate fluorometer [SPECTRA max GEMINI XS (trade name), product of Molecular Devices] (SN-38: excitation wavelength 380 nm, emission wavelength 560 nm; SN-38-glucuronide: excitation wavelength 370 nm, emission wavelength 430 nm), to thereby calculate the amount of intracellular accumulation of SN-38 and the glucuronide. As is clear from the results shown in Fig. 4, the amount of SN-38 accumulated in the A549/SN-38-4 cell line is about 1/5 that of SN-38 accumulated in the A549 cell line.  The results support that BCRP is involved in the anticancer drug resistance mechanism of the A549/SN-38 cell lines.  In contrast, virtually no SN-38-glucuronide was detected in both the A549 cell line and the A549/SN-38-4 cell line, indicating that glucuronidation is not involved in the anticancer drug resistance mechanism.<br>
Example 6: Effect of diphenylacrylonitrile derivative in overcoming anticancer drug resistance of A549/SN-38-4 cell line<br>
The effect of a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative on BCRP-mediated anticancer drug resistance was studied by use of the human lung cancer A549/SN-38-4 cell line, which had acquired anticancer drug resistance through BCRP expression.<br>
•The human lung cancer A549 cell line or the A549/SN-38-4 cell line was suspended in 10% FBS/Ham's F-12, and the resultant suspension was inoculated into a 96-well microplate, followed by culturing at 5% C02 and 37°C overnight (2 x 103 cells/50 HL/well) .  Thereafter, a 10% FBS/Ham's F-12 solution (25 (J.L) containing a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative and SN-38 or mitoxantrone was added to each of the wells, followed by<br>
culturing at 5% C02 and 37°C for 48 hours. After completion of culturing, the number of viable cells was counted by use of TetraColor ONE according to the attached instruction manual.  Fig. 5 shows the effect of the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative (compound 1) in overcoming SN-38 resistance or mitoxantrone resistance, and Table 3 shows the SN-38 resistance overcoming effect of each of the tested diphenylacrylonitrile derivatives, which is represented by EC5o-  "ECso" corresponds to the concentration of a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative required for 50% reduction of the relative resistance value.  The relative resistance value is obtained by dividing the ICso (i.e., the concentration of an anticancer drug required for 50% inhibition of cell growth) for the A549/SN-38-4 cell line by the ICso for the A549 cell line.  The greater the relative resistance value, the higher the level of acquired resistance. The results reveal that each of the diphenylacrylonitrile derivatives exhibits potent effect of overcoming the SN-38 resistance or mitoxantrone resistance of the A549/SN-38-4 cell line. When the concentration of the<br>
*Wiphenylacrylonitrile derivative falls within the range such that the derivative overcomes the anticancer drug resistance in a concentration-dependent manner, the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative per se does not affect growth of the A549 cell line and the A549/SN-38-4 cell line. The results suggest that the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative of the present invention inhibits BCRP, and overcomes the anticancer drug resistance of cancer cells.<br>
(Table Removed)Example 7: Effect of diphenylacrylonitrile derivative in enhancing sensitivity of MCF-7 cell line to anticancer drug<br>
The effect of a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative on the sensitivity of cancer cells to an anticancer drug was studied by use of human, breast cancer MCF-7 cell line, which is known<br>
*f:o express BCRP (Blood 99, 3763-3770 (2002)).  The MCF-7 cell line was suspended in 10% FBS/RPMI1640, and the resultant suspension was inoculated into a 96-well microplate, followed by culturing at 5% C02 and 37°C overnight (3 x 103 cells/50 piL/well) . Thereafter, a solution of a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative and SN-38 in 10% FBS/RPMI1640 (25 [iL) was added to each of the wells, followed by culturing at 5% C02 and 37°C for 48 hours. After completion of culturing, the number of viable cells was counted by use of TetraColor ONE according to the attached instruction manual.  Table 4 shows change in the sensitivity of the MCF-7 cell line to SN-38, which change is caused by a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative, by use of ICso (i.e., the concentration of SN-38 required for 50% inhibition of cell growth).  The results reveal that each of the tested diphenylacrylonitrile derivatives enhances the sensitivity of the MCF-7 cell line to SN-38. When the concentration of the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative falls within the range such that the derivative enhances the SN-38 sensitivity in a concentration-dependent manner, the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative per se does not affect growth of the MCF-7 cell line.  The results suggest that the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative of the present invention inhibits BCRP, and enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to an anticancer drug.<br>

Example 8: Effect of diphenylacrylonitrile derivative in overcoming anticancer drug resistance of human BCRP transduced mouse leukemia P388 cell line<br>
Mouse leukemia P388 cell line or human BCRP transduced P388 cell line (P388/BC.RP cell line, obtained from Yoshikazu Sugimoto, The Cancer Chemotherapy Center of Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research) was suspended in 10% FBS/RPMI1640, and the resultant suspension was inoculated into a 96-well microplate (1 x 104 cells/50 uL/well). Thereafter, a solution of a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative<br>
and SN-38 in 10% FBS/RPNI1640 (25 uL) was added to each of the wells, followed by culturing at 5% C02 and 37°C for 48 hours. After completion of culturing, the number of viable cells was counted by use of TetraColor ONE according to the attached instruction manual.  The results are shown in Fig. 6, Each of the tested diphenylacrylonitrile derivatives exhibited potent effect of overcoming the SN-38 resistance of<br>
P388/BCKP cell line.  In contrast, the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative did not affect the sensitivity of the P388 cell line to SN-38.  The results demonstrate that the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative of the present invention has .BCRP-inhibiting effect.<br>
Example 9: Effect of diphenylacrylonitrile derivative on multidrug resistance of MES-SA/Dx5 cell line<br>
Human uterine cancer MES-SA cell line or MES-SA/Dx5 cell line which had acquired multidrug resistance through overexpression of P-glycoprotein [Cancer Res. 45, 4091-4096 (1985)] was suspended in 10% FBS/DMEM, and the resultant suspension was inoculated into a 96-well microplate, followed by culturing at 5% C02 and 37°C overnight (3 x 103 cells/50 |O.L/well) .  Thereafter, a solution of a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative and paclitaxel in 10% FBS/DMEM (25 ^L) was added to each of the wells, followed by culturing at 5% C02 and<br>
37°C for 48 hours. After completion of culturing, the number of viable cells was counted by use of TetraColor ONE according to the attached instruction manual.  Table 5 shows the effect of each of the tested diphenylacrylonitrile derivatives on multidrug resistance by use of ECso-  "ECso" corresponds to the concentration of a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative required for 50% reduction of the relative resistance value. The results revealed that when the concentration of the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative falls within the range employed for the test, the derivative does<br>
idiot affect the paclitaxel resistance of the MES-SA/Dx5 cell line.  In addition, the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative per se did not affect growth of the MES-SA cell line and the MES-SA/Dx5 cell line. The results indicate that the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative of the present invention does not act on P-glycoprotein, and has BCRP specificity.<br>

The P388 cell line or the P38Q/BCRP cell line (1 x 107 cells/mL), or the MCF-7 cell line (3 x 106 cells/mL) was suspended in 10% FBS/RPMI1640 (1 mL), and a diphenylacrylonitrile derivative and SN-38 (final•^concentration: 500 ng/mL) were added to the resultant suspension, followed by incubation at 37°C for 60 minutes. Thereafter, centrifugation was performed (2°C, 1,400 x g, 1 nun) , and the resultant supernatant was removed.  Ice-cooled 10% FBS/RPMI1640 was added to the thus-precipitated cells, and the cells were resuspended therein, followed by<br>
centrifugation (2°C, 1,400 x g, 1 min) for washing of the cells.  This washing procedure was performed again, followed<br>
by addition of PBS (375 p,L) and sonication of the cells.  To the resultant cell sonicate, methanol (375 |iL) and 10% zinc sulfate solution (15 |iL) were added, and the resultant mixture was stirred, followed by centrifugation (2°C, 12,500 x g, 5 min) and collection of the supernatant.  The thus-collected supernatant was dispensed in a white 96-well microplate for fluorescence intensity measurement (200<br>
(iL/well), and then the amount of SN-38 contained in the supernatant was measured by use of a microplate fluorometer (SN-38: excitation wavelength 380 run, emission wavelength 560 nrn) , to thereby calculate the amount of intracellular accumulation of SN-38. As is clear from the results shown in Fig. 7, the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative of the present invention increases the amount of accumulation of SN-38 in the P388/J3CRP cell line.  In addition, as is clear from the results shown in Fig. 8, the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative of the present invention increases the amount of accumulation of SN-38 in the MCF-7 cell line.  The results suggest that the diphenylacrylonitrile derivative of the present invention<br>
