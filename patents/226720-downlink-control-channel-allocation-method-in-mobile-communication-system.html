DOWNLINK CONTROL CHANNEL ALLOCATION<br>
METHOD IN MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a channel allocation method in a CDMA (Code<br>
Division Multiple Access) mobile communication system and, more particularly, to a<br>
downlink control channel allocation method suitable for using a physical shared<br>
channel as a control channel.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, a downlink channel in a CDMA IMT-2000 system employs a method of<br>
multiplying an orthogonal code such as an orthogonal variable spreading factor(OVSF)<br>
or Walsh code to a transmission bit to spread it.<br>
Lately, studies are being conducted to determine a transmission method of a new<br>
data dedicated channel in order to increase a transmission rate of uplink in the IMT-<br>
2000 system. In case of applying the enhanced data dedicated channel to uplink, a<br>
downlink control channel has the following characteristics.<br>
First, it is assumed that new signaling information (control signals) required for<br>
operating an enhanced dedicated channel (E-DCH) is required for downlink. In this<br>
case, the information can be considered in association with an automatic repeat request<br>
(ARQ), scheduling and some other cases. Even though signal information requires<br>
high reliability, such signaling information can be multiplexed through a shared<br>
channel and transmitted to multiple terminals thanks to its small amount of data. Re-<br>
quirement for a physical channel structure for an L1 signaling at downlink is as<br>
follows.<br>
-	Preferably, the L1. signaling on downlink exists independently from a data<br>
dedicated channel of downlink.<br>
-	Signaling of every user should be transmitted at every transmission time interval<br>
(TT1).<br>
-	In order to reduce a delay phenomenon, signaling should be detected by a<br>
terminal before deinterleaving.<br>
Existing methods proposed for the downlink signaling are as follows.<br>
A first method is to transmit signal information by using an existing downlink<br>
data/control channel. Namely, in this method, the size of signaling information is not<br>
so big that signaling information can be transmitted by changing a frame structure of a<br><br>
downlink control channel or signaling information can be transmitted by using a<br>
remaining space after a downlink, data channel is punctured. In addition, in this<br>
method, signaling information can be also transmitted by increasing a transmission rate<br>
of the downlink data channel.<br>
A second method is to use an independent orthogonal code channel. In this<br>
method, signaling information is transmitted to each terminal by using an independent<br>
orthogonal code channel. In this case, an independent physical channel can be used for<br>
transmission of a downlink L1 signaling. The physical channel can be used as a<br>
dedicated channel of each terminal or as a shared channel for multiple terminals.<br>
The method of using the independent orthogonal code channel can be divided into<br>
a method of using a dedicated channel and a method of using a shared channel. In the<br>
method for transmitting signaling information by using the dedicated channel, an in-<br>
dependent orthogonal code channel is allocated to each terminal and signaling in-<br>
formation is transmitted thereto.<br>
The method of using the shared channel is divided into a method of using time-<br>
division shared channel and a symbol-level orthogonal code division multiplexing<br>
method.<br>
The method of using a time-division shared channel is to time-divide one<br>
orthogonal channel and allocates it to multiple users. Namely, one TT1 is divided by<br>
the number of users and the divided time interval is allocated to each user to transmit<br>
signal information. At this time, the number of bits differs depending on the size of<br>
requested signaling information.<br>
The symbol-level orthogonal code division multiplexing method is to transmit<br>
signaling information by using an orthogonal signal in units of symbol. Namely, in<br>
general, in the CDMA downlink, the orthogonal code channel uses a orthogonal signal<br>
in units of chip, and in order to extend the orthogonal code channel, signaling in-<br>
formation is transmitted by using the symbol-level orthogonal signal. In this case, the<br>
orthogonal signal can be generally extended by using a Hadamard code, and data is<br>
transmitted by using the Hadamard code which is able to support the number of a<br>
maximum transmission users.<br>
However, considering the downlink physical channel structure required for the ca<br>
se where the data dedicated channel is applied to uplink, the related art signaling<br>
transmitting method has the following problems.<br>
1. The method of using existing downlink data/control channel<br>
This method has such problems that an existing channel structure must be changed,<br><br>
a quality of the existing channel can be degraded in case of using the data channel, and<br>
it is difficult to secure a sufficient transmission space for transmitting signaling in-<br>
formation.<br>
2. The method of using the independent orthogonal code channel<br>
1)	Use of the dedicated channel<br>
In spite of the flexible and easy channel allocation and operation, the method of<br>
using the dedicated channel has the following problems: Because the orthogonal<br>
channel of downlink is a critical resource, there is a high possibility that it can not be<br>
used sufficiently. In addition, as the number of codes increase, a PAR (Peak to<br>
Average Ratio) also increases considerably.<br>
2)	Use of the shared channel<br>
-	in case of using time-division multiplexing<br>
The time-division multiplexing method in which time is divided has advantages<br>
that the PAR does not increase and it can be easily implemented. However, it is disad-<br>
vantageous in that it is difficult to flexibly allocated a signaling channel according to<br>
change in the number of data, and thus, more signaling information is required. In<br>
addition, it is difficult to flexibly allocated power according to a channel situation by<br>
users (it is difficult to effectively use resources).<br>
-	in case of using symbol-level code-division multiplexing<br>
The symbol-level code division multiplexing has an advantage in that because it<br>
does not have a time delay, users can transmits signaling information simultaneously,<br>
but if there are too many users, the length of the orthogonal code should be lengthened.<br>
In addition, the more the number of users or the transmission rate increases, the more<br>
orthogonal codes should be used, causing increase in the PAR<br>
As for the orthogonal code, in order to maintain orthogonality, a channel must not<br>
be changed during one period, but if the length of the code is lengthened, the or-<br>
thogonality may be broken. In addition, if the length of the code is continuously<br>
increased to increase available users, a problem arises that the length of the code<br>
would exceed a transmission unit.<br>
Moreover, in order to increase the transmission rate, a plurality of orthogonal codes<br>
should be allocated to one user. Then, one user is to receive several orthogonal code<br>
channels, complexity of a terminal increases.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
The present invention is implemented in a mobile communication system.<br>
However, the present invention can be also applied to a communication system<br>
operating according to a different standard.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described.<br>
The present invention proposes a method for efficiently allocating a control channel<br>
by combining merits of the time-division multiplexing and symbol-level code-division<br>
in a downlink control channel using an independent orthogonal code channel.<br>
In general, because it is advantageous to adjust, transmission power by units of<br>
orthogonal code channel, if there are many orthogonal code channels, a power resource<br>
can be efficiently allocated. Thus, if the number of orthogonal code channels increases,<br>
a problem arises that the PAR increases. In case of the time-division multiplexing,<br>
since there is only one orthogonal code channel, it is difficult to distribute bits and in-<br>
dividually allocate power according to channel situation by users. Thus, in order to<br><br>
solve such problems, the present invention proposes a new channel structure capable<br>
of increasing a code channel by using a short Hadamard code and time-dividing it.<br>
In addition, the present invention proposes a new channel structure capable of<br>
maintaining a low PAR while supporting various transmission rates by putting an eye<br>
on the fact that the Hadamard code can be extended by Sylvester method.<br>
Moreover, the present invention proposes a method for individually allocating<br>
power to the newly proposed channel structure for an effective use of power.<br>
Ebwer of the transmission channel can be applied differently to every Hadamard<br>
code channel.<br>
In order to effectively distribute power in a downlink shared channel, charac-<br>
teristics of the downlink channel of each user should be known. However, requesting<br>
each user to report characteristics of a downlink channel through uplink for the small<br>
amount of signaling information causes a severe channel waste, so a different<br>
reference needs to be used. In general, in a system such as the E-DCH or the 3GPP2<br>
Release-D, transmission power or a transmission power margin is to be reported for<br>
scheduling, and the information (the transmission power or transmission power<br>
margin) has a substantially close relation to propagation attenuation in downlink. Thus,<br>
the present invention proposes using the information to determine downlink channel<br>
power.<br>
The time-code division multiplexing method will be described in detail as follows.<br>
Control channel structure of time-code division multiplexing<br>
Figure 1 is a conceptual view showing signaling channel allocating method using<br>
time-code division multiplexing technique in accordance with a preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, dividing one transmission time interval (TTI) into M number<br>
of sections forms a basic allocation unit of a control channel, which is defined as a unit<br>
(basic) channel. A length of the unit channel is determined according to a length of the<br>
Hadamard code, a reference of an initial generation. In this case, a short Hadamard<br>
code becomes the initial generation basis in order to enhance transmission allocation<br>
efficiency, which is defined as a basic Hadamard code.<br>
If the basic Hadamard code is too short, the overall number of available orthogonal<br>
codes can be limited, whereas, if the basic Hadamard code is too long, the or-<br>
thogonality can be broken according to characteristics of a transport channel. Thus, the<br>
basic Hadamard code should be allocated with a suitable length according to a<br>
structure of a system and a service environment.<br><br>
The basic Hadamard code can be extended to a new Hadamard code through<br>
Sylvester method, and a length of the extended Hadamard oode is integer multiple of<br>
the basic Hadamard code. Thus, basic Hadamard code channels (CHI~CHM) can be<br>
respectively allocated to one unit channel or one extended Hadamard code channel<br>
(CHM+1,..., CHK+1) can be allocated to several unit channels. One information<br>
symbol is transmitted through such Hadamard code channel, and the number of<br>
transmission bits can differ depending on a modulation method.<br>
In the present invention, power of the transport channel, can be applied differently<br>
to each Hadamard code channel. In order to efficiently distribute power in the<br>
downlink shared channel, characteristics of downlink channel of each user should be<br>
known. However, requesting each user to report characteristics of a downlink channel<br>
to transmit a small amount of signaling information causes a severe channel waste, so<br>
a different reference needs to be used. In general, in a system such as the E-DCH or<br>
the 3GPP2 Release-D, transmission power or a transmission power margin is to be<br>
reported for scheduling, a value of which, however, has a substantially close relation to<br>
propagation attenuation in downlink. Thus, in the present invention, transmission<br>
power or a transmission power margin of the terminal is used to determine downlink<br>
channel power.<br>
Orthogonal code channel structure and its generating and<br>
extending method<br><br><br>
If n = p+1 (p is a prime factor) and<br>
(mod 4) in the initial reference matrix (H0), then the basic Hadamard code can be<br>
generated by a quadratic residue method, and the generated basic Hadamard matrix (H0<br>
) forms a circular Hadamard matrix as shown in Figure 3. At this time, the other<br>
remaining matrixes except for the first row and column of H0 has a circulation<br>
transition structure. In such a structure, if only one orthogonal code vector and an<br>
offset are known for detection of the Hadamard code, every code channel can be<br>
decoded and thus complexity of a terminal can be reduced.<br>
First, if the initial reference matrix and the extension matrix are defined as shown in<br>
Figure 3, first orderl extended matrix using them can be expressed by equation (2)<br>
shown below:<br><br>
A usable length of the code channel can be divided into two case of 12 and 24. If a<br>
transmission interval with the length of 24 is assumed, two symbols can be transmitted<br>
through a code channel with the length of 12 and one symbol can be transmitted<br>
through a code channel with the length of 24.<br>
If [+1,+1, +1, +1, +1, +1,..., +1] is selected as a code channel, the extended code<br>
with the length of 24 cannot be used. Namely, in case of the code extended by one<br>
Hadamard code cannot be used if an upper-level rode is used, and such a concept is as<br>
shown in Figure 2. The number of unavailable codes has the same value as the<br>
dimension of H . The number of cases of combining the codes 12 and 24 is as shown<br>
in Figure 4.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, although the number of transmission symbols are the<br>
same with each other in every case, the number of code channels differs. In general, as<br>
the number of code channels is reduced, the PAR is advantageously reduced. But if a<br>
long code is used, a greater spread rate is used, so that an SNR gain of 3dB can be<br>
obtained in case of transmitting a symbol by using the same power. Thus, a tactful<br>
combination in consideration such trade-off can allow allocation of suitable signaling<br>
channels to various users.<br>
Figure 5 is a block diagram when the proposed downlink signaling channel is<br>
applied to the CDMA system<br>
With reference to Figure 5, when signaling information is received from each user<br><br>
(terminal), a channel type selecting unit 10 classifies every signaling information into<br>
certain groups according to each length of channel codes by using control information<br>
of an upper layer. An actual orthogonal code and time section are allocated to the in-<br>
formation of each classified group in a time-code division multiplexing units<br>
11-1~11-n, modulated, and then, power-controlled in power controllers 12-1-1-12-1- l<br>
and 12-k-1~ 12-k-lk by code channels. In this case, the power controllers differently<br>
set power of a transport channel for each Hadamard code channel by using<br>
transmission power or a transmission power margin reported from users (terminals) for<br>
scheduling.<br>
Thereafter, the respective power controlled code channels are combined in a<br>
combining unit 13 and channelized according to an OVSF or a Walsh function in a<br>
channelizing unit 14.<br>
When the downlink control channel structure in accordance with the present<br>
invention is applied to the 3GPP E-DCH system, transmission is made by units of TTI<br>
and TTI is 2ms or 10ms. In this case, if it is assumed that a data symbol is band-spread<br>
by a spreading factor (SF=64), the number of 3GPP symbols existing in one TTI is 120<br>
(2ms) and 600 (10ms), respectively. If SF=64 and a code channel is generated on the<br>
basis of a Hadamard code with a length of 12 or 20, 10 (2ms) and 50 (10ms) unit<br>
channels are generated in the case that the length of the Hadamard code is 12, and 6<br>
(2ms) and 30 (10ms) unit channels are generated in the case that the length of the<br>
Hadamard code is 20. In this case, the number of data symbols transmittablc in one<br>
TTI is 120 (2ms) and 600 (10ms), respectively. At this time, signaling information can<br>
be allocated to the code channels with the length of 12 and 24 or 20 and 40 and used<br>
according to characteristics of signaling information as requested.<br>
If it is assumed that a symbol is band-spread by a spreading factor SF=128 for high<br>
reliability, the number of 3GPP symbols existing in one TTI is 60 (2ms) and 300<br>
(10ms), respectively. Thus, when a code channel is generated on the basis of a<br>
Hadamard code with a length of 12 or 20, 5 (2ms) and 25 (10ms) unit channels are<br>
generated in the case that the length of the Hadamard code is 12 and 3 (2ms) and 15<br>
(10ms) unit channels are generated in the case that the length of the Hadamard code is<br>
20. In this case, the number of data symbols transmittable during one TTI is 60 (2ms)<br>
and 300 (10ms), respectively.<br>
If an extended Hadamard code is used, 60 and 300 are not divided by the length of<br>
24 or 40 without a remainder, so in this case, a method can be employed in which<br>
sections of the code channel using 24 or 40 are defined to multiple sections and other<br><br>
remaining sections uses an orthogonal code with the length of 12 or 20.<br>
In the case of 3GPP2, transmission is made by units of frame, and as the frame unit,<br>
5ms, 10ms and 20ms are considered. If SF= 128, then 48, 96 and 192 symbols are<br>
transmitted during each frame interval, and in this case, if the unit channel with the<br>
length of 12 is used, the oode channel (Hadamard code) can be extended to 24 and 48<br>
or the like. Thus, like in the 3GPP, signaling information can be allocated to the code<br>
channels with the length of 12, 24, 48 or the like for use according to characteristics of<br>
each signaling information.<br>
Channel allocation rule<br>
Channel allocation can be determined by multiple references, and the number of si-<br>
multaneous users, a transmission data rate of individual user, a channel situation of an<br>
individual user, transmission power of a base station and an output PAR at a base<br>
station transmission amp are the most critical references. The present invention<br>
proposes the following channel allocation reference to effectively use power at a<br>
viewpoint of a base station.<br>
Users having the similiar geometrical or downlink channel characteristics are<br>
classified to a group, and the same code channels are allocated to each user group and<br>
a code channel is transmitted with optimum transmission power. A group requesting<br>
low power or a high transmission rate is allocated to a short Hadamard code channel,<br>
and a group requesting high power or a low transmission rate is allocated to a long<br>
Hadamard code channel.<br>
In this case, the group allocation is performed according to a requested SNR (Signal<br>
to Noise Ratio) and a transmission rate of each user, and a detailed classification<br>
reference is a selection factor of a system designer. Accordingly, in allocating a<br>
channel with respect to a group, a long code channel is preferentially allocated to a<br>
channel which has a high SNR and a low transmission rate. A detailed channel assign<br>
rules are as follows.<br><br>
, the 'k' number of basis Hadamard codes are allocated to a group g, and<br><br>
bit is moved to the next group g+1<br><br><br>
dimensionally and allocates transmission bits<br>
4.	Transmission power corresponding the group g is determined as<br><br>
5.	The above process is repeated for every group<br>
wherein Nb is the total number of transmittable bits in one transmission TTI/Frame,<br>
Ng is the number of transmission bits belonging to the group g, and Pg is total request<br>
power for transmitting the bits belonging to the group g. In addition,<br><br>
: average request power per bit of the group g, and Pth indicates a maximum power<br>
limit for downlink transmission.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, users having the similar geometrical or downlink channel<br>
characteristics are grouped (step S10), and specific signature channels are allocated to<br>
each group (step S11). Subsequently, K number of basic Hadamard codes are allocated<br>
to the group g according to the number of transmission bits as shown in the assign rule<br>
1 and P g, Ng and Pg,b for the group g are calculated according to the allocation rule 2.<br>
Also. The group g is reconfigured according to the assign rule 2.<br>
Thereafter, as shown in the assign rule 3, the base station checks whether the<br>
average request power (<br><br>
) per bit of the group g is larger than the maximum transmission power (Pth), and if the<br>
average request power per bit is larger than the maximum transmission power, the base<br>
station extends the basis Hadamard code n-dimensionally and then allocates<br>
transmission bits.<br>
Once the transmission bits are allocated, transmission power corresponding to the<br>
group g, namely, transmission power of the extended Hadamard rode channel is<br>
determined. This operation is repeatedly performed for every group at a step S12.<br>
When the channels are allocated to every group and the transmission power of the<br>
allocated channel is determined, the transmission step S13 is performed.<br>
As so far described, the present invention has the following advantages.<br><br>
That is, by combining the merits of the time-division multiplexing and the symbol-<br>
level code division in the downlink control channel using the independent orthogonal<br>
code channel, signaling information can be flexibly allocated to a control channel.<br>
In addition, since the channel is generated by extending the basis Hadamard code<br>
by Sylvester method, a low PAR can be maintained while supporting various<br>
transmission rates, and especially, high transmission efficiency can be obtained by<br>
using a small amount of power through the power controlling between individual<br>
codes.<br>
The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be<br>
construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be readily applied<br>
to other types of apparatuses. The description of the present invention is intended to be<br>
illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications,<br>
and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. In the claims, means-<br>
plus-function clauses are intended to cover the structure described herein as<br>
performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents but also equivalent<br>
structures.<br><br>
