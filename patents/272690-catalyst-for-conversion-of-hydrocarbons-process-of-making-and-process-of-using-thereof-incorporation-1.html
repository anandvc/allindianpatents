25 and the first series transition metals in a three dimensional interconnecting crystalline tetrahedral framework. The crystalline tetrahedral framework is synthesized from an aqueous gel containing, as needed, a silica source, an aluminum source, a phosphorus source, a source for the Group 4, Group 5,<br>
30   Group 13, Group 14, Group 15 and the first series transition<br><br><br>

PCT7US2008/006631<br><br>
metal element(s) and, optionally, an organic structure-directing agent. The reaction mixture is heated to form crystals and then cooled. The crystals are separated from the synthesis liquor and are washed, dried and calcined. At least 5 one metal selected from Group 6, Group 7, Group 8, Group 9 or Group 10 is deposited on the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate (hereinafter referred to as "deposited metal"). The catalyst may be used in a process for converting C2-C12 hydrocarbons into aromatics.<br>
10 One example of the invention is a catalyst on which at least one Group 10 metal, such as platinum, is deposited on a zeolite having at least two elements selected from Group 13 or Group 14, such as germanium and either tin or boron, in the zeolite  framework.    This  example  includes  a  process  for<br>
15 synthesizing a zeolite by: a) preparing a zeolite having at least two elements selected from Group 13 or Group 14, such as germanium and either tin or boron, in the zeolite framework; b) depositing at least one metal selected from Group 10 on the zeolite; and c) calcining the zeolite, said calcining occuring<br>
20 after preparation of the zeolite, before depositing at least one metal selected from Group 10 on the zeolite or after depositing at least one metal selected from Group 10 on the zeolite. This example of the invention also includes a process for  the  conversion  of  hydrocarbons  of:    a)  contacting  a<br>
25 hydrocarbon stream containing alkanes, olefins and mixtures thereof having 2 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule with at least<br><br><br>
one zeolite-based catalyst wherein the zeolite has at least two elements selected from Group 13 or Group 14, such as germanium and either tin or boron, in the zeolite framework and wherein at least one metal selected from Group 10 has been deposited on 5 the zeolite; and b) recovering the product. Another example of the invention is a catalyst on which at least one Group 10 metal, such as platinum, is deposited on a zeolite having at least one element selected from Group 13 or Group 14, such as boron,  in the zeolite framework.   This example includes a<br>
10 process for synthesizing a zeolite by: a) preparing a zeolite having boron incorporated into the zeolite framework; b) depositing at least one metal selected from Group 10 on the zeolite; and c) calcining the zeolite on which at least one metal selected from Group 10  is deposited,  said calcining<br>
15 occuring after preparation of the zeolite, before depositing at least one metal selected from Group 10 on the zeolite or after depositing at least one metal selected from Group 10 on the zeolite. This example of the invention also includes a process for the conversion of hydrocarbons of contacting a hydrocarbon<br>
20 stream containing alkanes, olefins and mixtures thereof having 2 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule with at least one zeolite-based catalyst wherein boron is incorporated into the zeolite framework and wherein at least one metal selected from Group 10 has been deposited on the zeolite and recovering the product.<br>
25 Another example of the invention is a ZSM-5 zeolite having germanium and at least one selected from the group consisting<br><br><br>
of tin and boron incorporated into the zeolite framework. This example also includes a process for synthesizing a zeolite by preparing a ZSM-5 zeolite containing germanium and at least one selected from the group consisting of tin and boron 5 incorporated into the zeolite framework and calcining the zeolite.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Crystalline silicates, aluminosilicates, aluminophosphates<br>
10 and silicoaluminophosphates have uniform pores through which molecules can diffuse. Aluminosilicates include zeolites. Examples of zeolites are MFI (ZSM-5), BEA (Beta), MWW (MCM-22), MOR (Mordenite), LTL (Zeolite L) , MTT (ZSM-23) , MTW (ZSM-12), TON (ZSM-22) and MEL (ZSM-11).<br>
15 Crystalline silicates, aluminosilicates, aluminophosphates and silicoaluminophosphates have structures of T04 tetrahedra, which form a three dimensional network by sharing oxygen atoms where T represents tetravalent elements, such as silicon; trivalent elements, such as aluminum; and pentavalent elements,<br>
20 such as phosphorus. "Zeolite" in the present application includes aluminosilicates with open three-dimensional framework structures composed of corner-sharing T04 tetrahedra, where T is Al or Si, but also includes tetravalent, trivalent and divalent T atoms which able to isoelectronically replace Si and Al in<br>
25 the framework, e.g., germanium(4 + ) , titanium (4 + ), boron (3 + ), gallium  (3+),  iron  (3+) ,  zinc  (2 + )  and  beryllium  (2 + ) .<br><br><br>
"Zeolite"  is  primarily  a  description  of  structure,  not composition.<br>
Silicates, aluminosilicates, aluminophosphates and silicoaluminophosphates generally crystallize from an aqueous 5 solution. The typical technique for synthesizing silicates, aluminosilicates, aluminophosphates or silicoaluminophosphates comprises converting an aqueous gel of a silica source, an aluminum source and a phosphorus source, as needed, to crystals by     a     hydrothermal     process,      employing      a<br>
10 dissolution/recrystallization mechanism. The reaction medium may also contain an organic structure-directing agent which is incorporated in the microporous space of the crystalline network during crystallization, thus controlling the construction of the network and assisting to stabilize the<br>
15 structure through the interactions with the silicon, aluminum or phosphorus components.<br>
The aqueous gel contains in addition to the silica source, the aluminum source, the phosphorus source, as needed, and the optional organic structure-directing agent, and a source of at<br>
20 least one other element from Group 4, Group 5, Group 13, Group 14, Group 15 or the first series transition metals to be incorporated into the framework of the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate.<br>
Examples of the silica source are silicon oxide or silica<br>
25 (Si02) which is available in various forms, such as silica sol, commercially available as Ludox AS-40™, precipitated silica,<br><br><br>
commercially available as Ultrasil VN3SP   and fumed silica, commercially available as Aerosil 200™.<br>
Examples of the aluminum source are sodium aluminate, aluminum nitrate,  aluminum sulfate,  aluminum hydroxide  and<br>
5  pseudobohemite.<br>
Examples of the phosphorus source are phosphoric acid (85 wt%), P2O5, orthophosphoric acid, triethylphosphate and sodium metaphosphate.<br>

15 hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, oxalic acid or formic acid.<br>
The reaction mixture is stirred and heated to a temperature of about 100°C to about 200°C to form crystals. The reaction mixture  is  cooled to room temperature.   The<br>
20 crystals are separated from the synthesis liquor. The liquid portion of the synthesis liquor may be removed by filtration, evaporation, spray drying or any other means for removing liquid, e.g., water, from the crystals. The crystals are washed with water and then dried and calcined.<br>
25 The silicates are essentially aluminum-free but may contain aluminum and other impurities up to 500 ppm.<br><br><br>
WO 2008/147543	PCT7US2008/006631<br>
The aluminosilicates may have a silicon to aluminum atomic ratio (Si:Al) greater than 2:1. In one embodiment of the present invention, the silicon to aluminum atomic ratio is in the range from 15:1 to 200:1. In another embodiment of the 5 present invention, the silicon to aluminum atomic ratio is in the range from 18:1 to 100:1.<br>
The aluminophosphates may have an aluminum to phosphorus atomic ratio  (A1:P)  in the range from about 0.8:1 to about 1.2:1  as  disclosed  in  U.S.  Patent  no.  4,310,440,  hereby 10   incorporated by reference.<br>
The silicoaluminophosphates may have a silicon to aluminum to phosphorus atomic ratio represented by (SxAlyPz)C&gt;2 where "x", "y" and "z" represent the mole fractions of silicon, aluminum and phosphorus respectively, present as tetrahedral oxides, 15 said mole fractions being such that they are within the pentagonal compositional area defined by points ABCD and E of a ternary diagram with values represented in the table below:<br>
Mole Fraction<br><br>
	X	y	z<br>
A	0.01	0.47	0.52<br>
B	0.94	0.01	0.05<br>
C	0.98	0.01	0.01<br>
D	0.39	0.60	0.01<br>
E	0.01	0.60	0.39<br>
as disclosed in U.S. Patent no. 4,440,871, hereby incorporated 30   by reference.<br><br><br>
The amount of Group 4, Group 5, Group 13, Group 14, Group<br>
15 and the  first  series transition metals present  in the<br>
crystalline framework is in the range from 0.1 wt.% to 25 wt.%.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, this range is from<br>
5 0.1 wt. % to 10 wt. %. In another embodiment of the present invention, this range is from 0.1 wt.% to 5 wt.%.<br>
The silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate has average pore size in the range from 2 angstroms to 20 angstroms, i.e., microporous.<br>
0 At least one metal selected from Group 6, Group 7, Group 8, Group 9 or Group 10 is deposited on the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate ("deposited metal") . The metal is deposited not only on the surface of the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or<br>
5 silicoaluminophosphate but also in the pores and channels which occur in the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate. The metal is deposited on the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate by any known method of depositing a<br>
0 metal on a silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate. Typical methods of depositing a metal on a silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate are ion exchange, impregnation and vapor deposition.  In one embodiment of the present invention,  the<br>
5 metal is present in the range from 0.05% to 3% by weight. In another embodiment of the present invention,  the metal  is<br><br><br>
present in the range from 0.1% to 2% by weight. In another embodiment of the present invention, the metal is present in the range from 0.2 to 1.5% by weight.<br>
However, for silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate 5 or silicoaluminophosphate-based catalysts on which metals have been deposited, the process temperatures and catalyst regeneration temperatures cause the metal to "sinter", i.e., agglomeration of the metal particles resulting in an increase of metal particle size on the surface of the zeolite and a<br>
10 decrease of metal surface area, causing a loss of catalyst performance, specifically catalyst performance, e.g., activity and/or selectivity.<br>
Without the present invention and its claims being limited by  theory,  it  is  believed  that  certain  elements  in  the<br>
15 framework and certain metals deposited on the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate associate to resist sintering of the deposited metal. U.S. Patent no. 6,784,333 discloses and claims an aluminum-silicon-germanium zeolite on which platinum has been deposited for use<br>
20   in a process  for the aromatization of hydrocarbons.   The<br>
presence of germanium in the framework of the zeolite and the<br>
presence  of  platinum  deposited  on  the  zeolite  apparently<br>
results in higher selectivity for benzene, toluene and xylenes<br>
(BTX)  which remains essentially constant over a significant<br>
25 time on stream. Without the invention of U. S. Patent no. 6,784,333 and its claims being limited by theory, it may be<br><br><br>
that the germanium in the framework and the platinum deposited on the zeolite associate such that the platinum remains dispersed and sintering is reduced.<br>
Besides germanium, there may be other elements in the 5 crystalline framework which associate with platinum or other deposited metals. Elements in the crystalline framework may be selected from Group 4, Group 5, Group 13, Group 14, Group 15 and the first series transition metals of the Periodic Table of Elements.   Specific examples of these elements are germanium,<br>
10 boron, gallium, indium, tin, titanium, zirconium, vanadium, chromium, iron, niobium and phosphorus. One or more elements may be in the crystalline framework. Specific examples of elements in the framework are germanium and at least one selected from the group consisting of tin and boron.<br>
15 Besides platinum, there may be other deposited metals which associate with germanium or other elements in the crystalline framework. Deposited metals may be selected from Group 6, Group 7, Group 8, Group 9 and Group 10 of the Periodic Table of Elements.   Specific examples of the deposited metal<br>
20 are platinum, molybdenum, rhenium, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium and iridium. One or more metals, such as bimetallics, e.g., Pt/Sn, Pt/Ge, Pt/Pb or metal/ metal oxide combinations, e.g. Pt/Ge02, may be deposited.<br>
The crystalline framework of which these elements from<br>
25 Group 4, Group 5, Group 13, Group 14, Group 15 and the first series transition metals are part and on which metals selected<br><br><br>
from Group 6, Group 7, Group 8, Group 9 and Group 10 are deposited need not be limited to a zeolite but may be any microporous silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate. 5 Before or after deposition of the metal, the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate may be bound by oxides or phosphates of magnesium, aluminum, titanium, zirconium, thorium, silicon, boron or mixtures thereof.  The process steps of binding and depositing metal can<br>
10 occur in any order. Binding may occur before or after metal deposition.<br>
The catalyst may be calcined at different stages in the synthesis. For example, there may be a first calcination of the    silicate,    aluminosilicate,    aluminophosphate    or<br>
15 silicoaluminophosphate to remove the organic structure-directing agent followed by metal deposition and subsequent calcinations at lower temperatures. The calcination to remove the organic structure-directing agent is at a temperature of about 300°C to about 1000°C or about 300°C to about 750°C for a<br>
20 time sufficient to remove essentially all of any structure-directing agent, e.g., one to six hours or about four hours. One example of calcination is at 550 °C for ten hours. Calcination may occur after binding. This calcination is at a temperature in the range of from about 300°C to about 1000°C<br>
25 for a time in the range of from about one hour to about 24 hours.   Calcination may also occur after metal deposition to<br><br><br>
fix the metal. This calcination should not exceed a temperature of 500°C and may be at a temperature of about 200°C to about 500°C for a time in the range of from about 0.5 hour to about 24 hours.  These calcinations need not be separate but<br>
5 may be combined to accomplish more than one purpose. When the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate is calcined, it may be bound or unbound and it may have metal deposited on it or not. Calcination can occur, in an environment of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, water<br>
0   vapor, helium and mixtures thereof.<br>
The catalyst, bound and unbound, will have porosity in addition to the uniform porosity of the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate. For an unbound catalyst, the average pore size of the catalyst<br>
5 can vary for bound and unbound catalyst and is in the range from 2 angstroms to 100 angstroms. In one embodiment of the present invention, the average pore size is in the range from 5 angstroms to 50 angstroms. In another embodiment of the present invention, the average pore size is in the microporous<br>
0 range from 5 angstroms to 20 angstroms. For a bound catalyst, the average pore size of the catalyst may vary from 5 angstroms up to 100 microns.<br>
Some catalysts used for hydrocarbon conversion are susceptible to sulfur poisoning.  However, for some catalysts<br>
5 used for hydrocarbon conversion, modest amounts of sulfur, such as about 0 to 200 ppm in the feed, are acceptable and sometimes<br><br><br>
preferred. The catalyst may also be pretreated with sulfur. A standard sulfurization method that is well known in the art consists in heating in the presence of a sulfur compound, such as hydrogen sulfide, or a mixture of a sulfur compound and an 5 inert gas, such as hydrogen or nitrogen, to a temperature of between 150 and 800°C. Non-limiting examples of sulfur compounds are H2S, an organosulfide compound, such as dimethyl disulfide or DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) , or CnH2n+2S or CnH2n+2S2, where n = 1-20.  In  one  embodiment  of  the  present  invention,  the<br>
10   temperature is between 250 and 600°C.<br>
The catalyst may contain a reaction product, such as a sulfide of the deposited metal, that is formed by contacting the catalyst with sulfur or a sulfur compound. In one embodiment of the present invention, the amount of sulfur on<br>
15   the catalyst is in the range of from 10 ppm to 0.1 wt.%.<br>
The catalyst may also contain elements other than sulfur, such as tin, germanium or lead. These elements would be present in the range of from 1:1 to 1:100 as a ratio of the deposited metal to tin, germanium or lead.  These elements may<br>
20   be added to the catalyst by wet impregnation, chemical vapor deposition or other methods known in the art.<br>
The silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate-based catalyst which contains at least one element selected from Group 4, Group 5, Group 13, Group 14,<br>
25   Group 15 and the first series transition metals isomorphously<br><br><br>
incorporated into the zeolite framework and at least one metal selected from Group 6, Group 7, Group 8, Group 9 and Group 10 deposited on the zeolite can be used in a process for conversion of hydrocarbon streams containing C2-C12 alkanes, 5 olefins or mixture thereof which may be straight, branched, cyclic or mixtures thereof, into aromatics.<br>
The zeolite may be base-exchanged with an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, such as cesium, potassium, sodium, rubidium, barium, calcium, magnesium and mixtures thereof, to<br>
10 reduce acidity and form a non-acidic zeolite. A non-acidic zeolite has substantially all of its cationic sites of exchange, e.g., those typically associated with aluminum, occupied by nonhydrogen cationic species, e.g., alkali or alkaline  earth  metals.    These  cationic  sites  are  often<br>
15 responsible for cracking of hydrocarbons into undesired products. A zeolite may be non-acidic by exchange with a base or by having a low aluminum content. The base-exchange may occur before or after the noble metal is deposited. Such a base-exchanged catalyst may be used to convert C6-C12 alkanes,<br>
20 such as might be obtained from natural gas condensate, light naphtha, raffinate from aromatics extraction and other refinery or chemical processes, to aromatics, such as benzene, ethyl benzene, toluene and xylenes. Base-exchange may take place during  synthesis  of  the  zeolite  with  an  alkali metal  or<br>
25 alkaline earth metal being added as a component of the reaction mixture or may take place with a crystalline zeolite before or<br><br><br>
after deposition of the noble metal. The zeolite is base-exchanged to the extent that most or all of the cations associated with aluminum are alkali metal or alkaline earth metal. An example of a monovalent base:aluminum molar ratio in 5 the zeolite after base exchange is at least about 0.9. For a divalent or trivalent base, the molar ratio would be half (0.45) or a third (0.3) as that for a monovalent base, respectively, and for mixtures of monovalent, divalent and trivalent bases, the above molar ratios would be apportioned by<br>
10   their respective content in the mixture.<br>
Depending on the element incorporated into the zeolite framework, the zeolite may be non-acidic without base-exchange, e.g., boron, germanium or tin in an aluminum-free zeolite. "Aluminum-free" has a meaning of having aluminum content of no<br>
15  more than 0.4wt%.<br>

solution with stirring. 1.2527 grams of germanium dioxide were 5   dissolved gradually with stirring. Gel was formed after 35.2<br>
grams of Ludox HS-30 were introduced into solution. Gel was<br><br><br>
stirred for about 15 minutes (pH=12.76).<br>
Crystallization was made in stainless steel 300 ml autoclave at 165°C for 5 days with stirring (100 rpm).<br>
Analysis results are: 41.6 wt. % Si; 0.41 wt. % B; 0.83 wt. % 5   Ge.<br>
Identified as ZSM-5 by XRD.<br>
l%Pt/GeBZSM-5<br>
Incipient wetness impregnation was carried out by adding<br>
10 drop wise a solution of 0.0412 g Pt (NH2) 4 (N03) 2 dissolved in 0.96 grams of deionized water to 2.003 grams of laboratory prepared GeBZSM-5. The material was dried for 1 hour in a 110°C drying oven then calcined in air at 280°C for 3 hours.<br>
The catalyst powder was pressed and sized to 20-40 mesh.<br>
15 0.25 cm3 (0.127 g) of the sized catalyst was mixed with 1.75 ml of inert quartz chips and was pretreated at 460°C for 1 hour in flowing H2. Catalytic testing was then started.<br>
20   Catalyst Testing<br>
All catalysts were tested according to the same procedure. Catalyst particles, mixed with inert quartz chips, were loaded into a 1/4" OD plug flow reactor. n-hexane was vaporized into a stream of flowing hydrogen at a temperature<br>
25 of approximately 150°C. This gas mixture was passed through the  reactor  at  a  LHSV of  8.6  hr-1  ,  the  reactor being<br><br><br>
maintained at a temperature of 515°C by an external heating<br>
jacket.     The  reaction  products  were  analyzed  by  gas<br>
chromatography.   Products ranging in size from methane to<br>
dimethylnaphthalene  were  observed.     A  variety  of  C6<br>
5   isomerization products  were  observed,  including  isohexanes<br>
(e.g., 2-methylpentane) and olefins (e.g. 1-hexene.)  For the<br>
purposes of calculating conversion and selectivity, these C6<br>
products were considered to be unreacted.   The selectivities<br>
reported  are  calculated  as  the  sum of  benzene,  toluene,<br>
10   xylenes, and ethylbenzene produced divided by the total amount<br>
of all benzene, C1-C5, and C7+ materials recovered.   These<br>
selectivities are presented on a molar C6 basis.<br><br>
