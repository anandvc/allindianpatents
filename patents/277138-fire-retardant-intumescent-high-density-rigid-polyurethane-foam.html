				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the rigid polyurethane foam (PUF) having excellent<br>
flame resistant property in respect to limiting oxygen index (LOI), heat release rate and<br>
smoke evolution properties. More particularly, the invention relates to the unique<br>
combinations of different flame retardant (FR) additives and intumescent compounds<br>
incorporated into the foam without affecting the physical and mechanical properties of<br>
the resultant PUFs. The intumescent flame retardant polyurethane foams of the present<br>
invention are characterized by different ways, such as self-extinguishing properties,<br>
intumescent properties, and charring properties which respond to provide protection<br>
when exposed to fire. The charred foam is an insulator of low combustibility which, at<br>
the same time, retards the release of flammable gases from the heated mass. According to<br>
this invention the present high density rigid PUF yields strong intumescent char which<br>
protects the material inside the rigid PUF.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Rigid polyurethane foam (PUF) has a wide range of applications such as insulation,<br>
structural, packaging and so on, because of their higher strength to weight ratio, excellent<br>
insulation properties, lower density, excellent dimensional stability, and low water vapor<br>
permeability. Now-a-days because of the strict regulations in safety and security in<br>
defense, aerospace, military and consumer sectors intumescent PUF plays an important<br>
fire retardant packaging material.<br>
Generally, flame retardant PUFs are prepared by two methods, viz; (1) incorporating<br>
suitable additives into the reactants, (2) modification of the formulation process to<br>
incorporate the flame retarding compounds containing functional groups which become<br>
chemically bound to the polymer chain. In practice, the use of additives is generally<br>
preferred because it is more flexible. There are large numbers of flame retardant additives<br>
commercially available in the different category like halogens, phosphorus, inorganic<br>
materials, nitrogen based organic materials and so on.<br>
The selection of the flame retardants (FR) for suitable application is a major task.<br>
Because some of the FR additives leach out and/or migrate towards the surface causing<br>
the failure of the mechanical properties and also deteriorate flame retardant properties<br>
with time. It has been reported in the literature that in the case of halogenated flame<br>
retardants corrosive, toxic gases (dioxins) and smokes are released while combustion,<br>
which erode the instruments and pollute the environment. In most of the cases addition of<br>
these FR additives lead to inferior mechanical properties (Troitzsch J., 1990,<br>
"International Plastics Flammability Handbook", 2nd Ed., Hanser Publishers, New York;<br>
Grand, A. F, et al., 2000, Fire Retardancy of Polymeric Materials; Marcel Dekker, Inc.,<br>
New York).<br>
The use of different flame retardant chemicals and intumescent mixtures for inclusion in<br>
polyurethane materials such as thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer, polyurethane based<br>
paints and coatings, and flexible polyurethane foams have been reported in the literatures<br>
based on the intumescent flame retardant chemicals (Wang, J., et al., 2004, J. Appl.<br>
Polym. Sci., 91, 1193; Camino, G., et al, 1988, Costa, L. Polym. Degrad. Stab. 20, 271;<br>
Camino, G., et al., 1989, Polym. Degrad. Stab. 23, 359; Camino, G., et al., 1991, Polym.<br>
Degrad. Stab. 33, 131; Modesti, M., 2002, Polym. Degrad. Stab. 77, 195; Xie, R., 2001,<br>
J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 80, 1190; Bian, X-C, et al., 2007, J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 104, 3347;<br>
Shi, L., 2006, Polym. Int., 55, 862; Anna, P., et al., 2001, Polym. Degrad. Stab. 74, 423;<br>
Ma, Z., et al., 1997, J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 63,1511).<br>
It has been observed that the conventional phosphorus-halogen containing flame<br>
retardants (e,g chlorophosphate esters) cannot effectively retard the fire at higher<br>
temperature (&gt; 500 °C). This is due to their volatilization as well as the insufficient char<br>
formation at higher temperatures.<br>

a suitable combination of intumescent char forming additives based mainly on non-<br>
halogenated FR additives.<br>

The application of fire retardant and intumescent char forming materials in rigid PUF is<br>
not well-explored. However, none of the patents discloses the unique combination of<br>
different additives to achieve specific properties for important special applications.<br>
In recent years there has been worldwide serious concern regarding the use of FR<br>
additives, which are subjected to the stringent conditions set by statutory government<br>
regulations. As a result there is a need for the development of halogen-free flame<br>
retardant materials. The environmental friendly FR additives having good flame retarding<br>
properties are in particular demand. Recently attention has been directed towards the<br>
intumescent type flame retardant systems, as they are quite effective in flame retardance<br>
and also do not produce toxic gases in the event of fire. Intumescent compositions of the<br>
prior art usually contain an intumescent additives having at least three components, i.e., a<br>
carbonific, a spumific, and a catalyst. Good intumescent compositions should be able to<br>
at least double their volume (swollen) compared to original size, when they come in<br>
contact with a flame.<br>
PUFs burn readily when ignited by external heating source, thus they are unsuitable for<br>
certain applications in which fire is a hazard. Accordingly, it is desirable to make PUF<br>
which are flame retardant or self-extinguishing, and if possible, release less toxic gas and<br>
smoke, so as to eliminate or minimize the hazard of fire.<br>
The present invention provides the combination of novel fire retardant additives to<br>
prepare rigid PUF which can be used in the critical applications like in defense,<br>
aerospace, military, automotive, buildings and construction, computer, packaging, rail<br>
transport, telecommunication, electrical and electronics, etc.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of this invention is to provide the intumescent high density rigid<br>
polyurethane foam having excellent fire retardant, self-extinguishing characteristics,<br>
releasing lesser amount of heat and toxic smokes.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to provide mechanically stable voluminous<br>
(approximately double than unburnt foam) multi-cellular swollen char after burning<br>
without affecting the material inside the PUF.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention reports the preparation of intumescent fire retardant rigid PUF<br>
using suitable polyols, diisocyanates and a proper combination of suitable fire retardant<br>
additives. This specialty PUFs, on burning provides a voluminous multi-cellular swollen<br>
char with lesser release of heat and smokes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Intumescent fire retardant compounds are characterized by their foaming and char-<br>
forming properties. The phenomenon of intumescent fire retardance is based on the<br>
production from the reagents of gaseous materials which expand the sample into charred<br>
carbonaceous foam on heating. The charred foam is an insulator of low combustibility<br>
which, at the same time, retards the release of flammable gases from the heated mass.<br>
The present invention relates to the intumescent flame retardant high density rigid<br>
polyurethane foam prepared by one-shot, molding method. The composition of the foam<br>
forming mixtures (Table 1) comprises of Polyol, Isocyanate, Catalyst, Chain extender,<br>
Cross-linking agents, Blowing agents, Surfactants, Fillers and the unique combinations of<br>
flame retardant additives, which impart the intumescing char when ignited.<br>
The rigid PUF prepared by polyol based either on polyether or polyester, polyisocyanate<br>
and blowing agents. Physical as well as chemical blowing agents can be used in the<br>
preparation of PUFs. Water is one of the most widely used chemical blowing agents. It<br>
reacts with diisocyanate and then generates gaseous carbon dioxide and polyurea. This<br>
in-situ prepared carbon dioxide inflates reactant mixture; as a result, a cellular structure is<br>
formed. The widely used physical blowing agents are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydro<br>
chlorofiuorocarbons (HCFCs), fluorocarbons (FCs), and low boiling hydrocarbons<br>
(HCs). The formation of polyurethane is based on the reaction of diisocyanate with<br>
polyol. The reaction is exothermic in nature and the reaction heat can be used to form a<br>
cellular structure by the evaporation of physical blowing agents present in the reaction<br>
formulation.<br>
The polyether based polyol of this invention is selected from the polyoxyalkylene<br>
polyether polyols, are generally prepared by the reaction of an alkylene oxide, such as<br>
ethylene oxide, 1, 2-propylene oxide with a polyhydric initiator or starter. The polyhydric<br>
initiator or starter can be, for example, glycerol, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane,<br>
triethanolamine, aromatic diamines, sucrose, sorbitol, etc. The polyethers used in the<br>
present invention preferably have molecular weight of about 400 to about 700 g/mol and<br>
an average hydroxy functionality of about 3 to 8.<br>
The low molecular weight compounds containing hydroxyl groups, or amino groups, or<br>
thiol groups or carboxyl groups are used as chain extenders or cross-linking agent to form<br>
branched or three-dimensional network structure. Examples of such compounds include<br>
ethylene glycol, 1,2-and 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,4- and 2,3-butylene glycol, 1,5-pentane<br>
diol, 1,6-hexane diol, 1,8-octane diol, neopentyl glycol, glycerol, trimethylol propane,<br>
trimethylol ethane, 1,2,6-hexane triol, pentaerythritol, mannitol and sorbitol.<br>
The organic polyisocyanates include toluene diisocyanate (TDI),<br>
methylenediphenyldiisocyanate (MDI) (in the form of pure as well as crude), modified<br>
MDI and TDI, prepolymers of MDI and TDI, polymeric diphenyl methane diisocyanate<br>
(PMDI).<br>
The blowing agents comprise of water alone or water in combination with other<br>
conventional physical blowing agents such as n-pentane, cyclopentane, isopentane,<br>
butane, isobutane, hexane, heptane, HCFC 141b, HCFC 142b, HCFC 134a, HCFC 245fa,<br>
HFC 134a, HFC 152a, HFC 245fa and HFC 365mfc.<br>
The catalyst includes tertiary amines such as N-alkyl morpholamine, N, N'- dialkyl<br>
cyclohexylamines, (where the alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, etc.) also<br>
dimethyl hexahydroaniline, diethylhexa hydroaniline, N, N, N', N", N"pentamethyl<br>
diethylenetriamine, N, N'-diethyl aminoethanol, N, N-dicyclohexylamine, triethyl amine,<br>
tributylamine, triamylamine, pyridine, quinoline, dimethyl piperidine, and organometalic<br>
compounds including those of bismuth, lead, tin, titanium, iron, antimony, mercury, zinc,<br>
nickel, cerium, molybdenum, vanadium, copper, manganese, zirconium, etc., examples of<br>
which include stannous octoate, dibutyltin dilaurate, bismuth nitrate, lead benzoate,<br>
lithium acetate, ferric chloride, thorium nitrate, triphenyl aluminum. They are used as<br>
blowing catalysts as well as sometimes gelling catalyst.<br>
The surfactants employed for the desirable uniform cell structure include paraffins, fatty<br>
alcohols, silicone oils and dimethylpolysiloxanes.<br>
According to this invention the suitable combination of the flame and intumescent fire<br>
retardant additive comprises of a halogenated phosphate ester, nitrogen and phosphorus<br>
containing compound, intercalated expandable graphite flakes, triazine compounds and<br>
its derivatives, polyhydroxy compounds and hydrated silicates. A suitable nitrogen and<br>
phosphorus containing compound is ammonium phosphate, ammonium polyphosphate,<br>
melamine phosphate, melamine polyphosphate, ethylenediamine phosphate, ammonium<br>
dihydrogen phosphate, aluminum orthophosphate, piperazine phosphate, guanidine<br>
phosphate, phosphoric ester polyols or urea phosphate. Suitable polyhydroxy compounds<br>
used are pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, polyethylene glycol and phosphoric ester-<br>
based polyols. The amount of flame and intumescent fire retardant additive combination<br>
used in the foam is an amount effective to give the combined reduction of flame retardant<br>
and mechanically stable with carbonaceous char properties desired by the user. The<br>
combined weight of the flame retardant additive combination is typically about 10 to 50<br>
php weight percent of the total weight of the polyol in the formulation.<br>
The present invention provides the flame retardant rigid PUF with intumescent mixtures,<br>
which produce physically strong and voluminous multi-cellular carbonaceous swollen<br>
char during burning [as shown in Figure 1 (a &amp; b)]. The importance of this mechanism is<br>
that because of the formation of intumescent char, the bulk of the material will not be<br>
affected by the flame. In addition, this solid char layer protects the remaining polymer<br>
from the heat of combustion, thus it limits the heat and mass transfer and access of<br>
oxygen to the polymer. The flame cannot spread further due to dearth of oxygen and fuel.<br>
In this way it retards the degradation of PUF and reduces smoke production and evolution<br>
of toxic gases during burning. The obtained char is stable at higher temperature (550 °C)<br>
and gives higher value of the limiting oxygen index (LOI) (approx. 33 %).<br>
Further aspect of the present invention is to provide the particle size and surface<br>
treatment of the FR additives which play a crucial role in fire resistant and mechanical<br>
properties of PUF. This intumescent fire retardant additive having the particle size is in<br>
the range from 5 to 200 urn and FR surface is coated with reactive functional group to<br>
have better compatibility with the polymer matrix.<br>
The particle size and surface treatment of the FR additives play a crucial role in density<br>
and mechanical properties of PUF. The physico-mechanical properties of polymer<br>
improved with addition of fillers having low particle size and/or suitable surface<br>
modification. Lower particle size increases the interfacial interaction (more aspect ratio)<br>
between filler with polymer matrix. Modification of the surface of the additive via<br>
specific functional group improves the compatibility with the polymer matrix.<br>
A significant advantage in the foams produced in the present invention is that they swell<br>
or intumesce and char when exposed to flame and form an insulating fire-retardant<br>
barrier between the flame and the unburnt portions of the foam. The char formed on the<br>
foam after exposure to heat provides a high resistance to heat flow between the heat<br>
source and the foam surface. In addition, foam of this invention inhibits the formation of<br>
hot or flaming droplets which can cause excessive damage even though the flame has<br>
been extinguished or inhibited. This kind of intumescent char has low thermal<br>
conductivity and high oxidation resistance, so that it not only affords protection to the<br>
material present inside by virtue of its low thermal conductivity, but its surface reaches a<br>
high temperature and thus re-radiates a large fraction of the incident heat load.<br>
The present invention is now demonstrated by way of illustrative non limiting examples.<br>
The following specific examples will serve further to illustrate the practice and<br>
advantages of this invention.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
The process for the preparation of the rigid PUF is as follows: all of the ingredients (as<br>
shown in Table 1) except isocyanate, were first well mixed in a plastic container. Then<br>
isocyanate was added into the container with vigorous stirring for 20 seconds. The<br>
resulting mixture was poured into a mold, which is used to produce the rigid PUF. After<br>
the preparation the foams were kept in an oven at 70 °C for 24 h to complete the<br>
polymerization reaction. The particle size of flame retardants is very important since<br>
physical properties of the resulting products are significantly affected. Generally, the<br>
finer the particle size of fillers impart better properties of the resultant products. It is<br>
preferred to use flame retardants having an average particle size of less than 30 microns,<br>
and especially about 10 microns or less.<br>
The intumescent mixture for the rigid polyurethane foam produced in this invention is<br>
very efficient, and renders excellent retardant to flame, heat and smoke. Table 2<br>
summarizes the different physical, mechanical and fire retardant properties of rigid PUF<br>
prepared in this invention. Table 3, Table 4, Figure 2 and 3 show the comparative results<br>
of rigid PUF and commercial reference sample (Reference 1 and 2).<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The rigid PUF is characterized by following various tests. The density of the PUF<br>
samples was measured according to ASTM D 1622-03. The mechanical properties such<br>
as compressive strength at 10% strain in parallel to foam rise direction was performed<br>
according to ASTM D 1621-00. The morphology of the PUF samples was studied with a<br>
JEOL, JSM 5800 scanning electron microscope, Japan. The thermal conductivity of the<br>
PUFs was tested between two plates on a guarded hot plate apparatus as per ASTM C<br>
177-97. The thermal stability of PUF was examined on a thermogravimetry analysis<br>
(TGA), (Q50, TA Instruments, USA) under nitrogen environment at a heating rate of 20<br>
°C /min.<br>
The flame retardant properties of the PUF were determined by Limiting Oxygen Index<br>
(LOI) according to the ASTM D-2863 test. This LOI expresses the minimum percentage<br>
of oxygen in a flowing mixture of oxygen and nitrogen required to support flaming<br>
combustion. A higher value of LOI indicates a lesser probability of burning since a<br>
greater amount of oxygen would be required to support combustion. Therefore, the LOI<br>
of 21.0 means that combustion can be supported in air (content of oxygen in air is about<br>
21%) whereas the LOI of 31.0, indicates that the relative amount of oxygen in the<br>
environment of the sample must be considerably greater than what is found in air, to<br>
support combustion.<br>
The char yields (CY) of the foams were measured on a muffle furnace at 550°C for 30<br>
min. The cone calorimeter test is also used to indicate flammability or lack of it with<br>
respect to a test sample and measured according to ASTM E-1354. In this test, the<br>
objective is to determine the ignition time, heat release rate, amount of smoke released,<br>
amount of mass loss at the fixed or varied heat flux. To achieve this objective, at high<br>
intense heat, the foam should have a minimum heat release rate, minimum smoke<br>
evolution and greater the ignition time. The smoke density was measured as per ASTM D<br>
2843-04. The smoke generated in the process of burning of sample is measured by the<br>
change of light intensity. The size of the PUF specimen was 100 x 100 x 12 mm3 (length<br>
x width x thickness). The maximum smoke density was measured from the curves of peak<br>
maxima of the light absorption vs time. This smoke density rating represents the total<br>
amount of smoke present in the chamber for the 4 min time and was measured by using<br>
the equation;<br>
Smoke density rating = A/T x 100<br>
Where, A and T are the area under the curve of light absorption vs. time and total area of<br>
the curve respectively.<br>
<br>
