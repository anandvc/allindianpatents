[Invent ion Title]<br><br>
ANTISTATIC SILICONE RELEASE COATING FILMS<br><br>
[Technical Field]<br><br>	The invention relates to an antistatic silicone release film having a layer coated with an antistatic silicone release composition, and, in particular, to an antistatic silicone release film having a layer coated with an antistatic silicone release composition and used for semiconductors, electronics and display devices while addressing problems of static electricity generated when a general release film is separated from adhesive and an adhesive layer, and of contamination by such static electricity that directly causes critical product defects. The invention also relates to an antistatic silicon release film that can reduce product contamination by static electricity in peeling the film from adhesive or an adhesive layer, has good adhesiveness between a substrate and a coated layer because of no interruption in curing a release layer, and also thereby has a stable release property.<br><br>
[Background Art]<br><br>	Recently, the field of semiconductors, electronics and display devices are rapidly developing. In the field, synthetic resins or synthetic fibers are increasingly used, leading to a troublesome problem of static electricity to be settled. Generally, in the field of release films whose main purpose is to protect adhesive layers, more and more resins or fibers have been used and require antistatic performance for the use. Conventionally, adhesive layers have been made antistatic in order to settle the problem of contamination due to static electricity occurring when a release film is separated from an adhesive layer. However, if the adhesive layer is made antistatic, it does not fully exhibit antistatic performance since antistatic agents are not well compatible with adhesive. Therefore, re]ease layers have been made antistatic, in addition to adhesive layers in many cases. Release property as a physical property required in a release film for the field of precision<br>
materials requires a proper peeling force depending on types and use of adhesive, high residual adhesiveness for not lowering adhesiveness by a release layer being transferred to an adhesive layer, solvent resistance that release layers are not peeled off by organic solvent of solvent type adhesive, high light transmission if release films are for optical use, etc.<br><br>	Conventional antistatic technologies include internally adding anion compounds such as organic sulfonate and organic phosphate, depositing metallic compounds, coating with conductive inorganic particles, coating with low molecular anion or cation compounds, coating with conductive polymers, etc.<br><br>	A known conventional method of I)roducing antistatic release films with the aforementioned antistatic technologies is to contain metals, e.g., lithium, copper, magnesium, calciLun, iron, cobalt or nickel, etc., in silicone compositions (see US patent publication No. 4,764,565). The aforementioned method, however, is not cost effective and also has a limit in achieving ant istatic performance: with the method, forming a uniformly coated layer for optical use is interrupted.<br><br>	If the antistatic composition is of conductive polymers, ion—type polymers, etc., it interrupts curing of silicone release coating compositions, and it is hard to form a release coated layer. Close adhesion between an antistatic layer and a silicone layer is also deteriorated, so that silicone is transferred to adversely affect the function of adhesive. Therefore, in case of a conventional antistatic release film, both of the antistatic performance and the release property can be implemented by applying antistatic compositions on a substrate and drying the film and then applying release coating compositions, or by first applying antistatic compositions on one side of a substrate and then applying release compositions on the other side of the substrate. However, since such a method of forming a conventional antistatic release film requires a coating and drying process to be carried out at least twice, a lot of processing time and cost is needed.<br><br>
[Disclosure)<br><br>
[Technical Problem]<br><br>	It is an idea of the invention to respond to such requirements and to address problems in prior art technologies. It is an object of the invention to provide a good silicone release film being made antistatic by reducing product contamination (lue to static electricity in peeling the film from adhesive, when the film according to the invention is used as a release film for semiconductors, electronics and display devices produced in an in—line or off—line production process,<br><br>	It is another object of the invention to provide a very good antistatic silicone release film having a layer coated with an antistatic silicone release composition (hereinafter, antistatic silicone release film) being made sufficiently antistatic by applying a coating process only once, and of good adhesiveness between a substrate and a coated layer because there is no interruption in curing of release compositions.<br><br>
The aforementioned and other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from reading the following description illustrating preferred embodiments of the invention. [Advantageous Effects]<br><br>	As described above, if the antistatic silicone release film according to the invention is produced through an in—line or off—line production process and is used as a release film for semiconductors, electronics and display devices, it is advantageous in that it is possible to reduce product contamination due to static electricity when peeling the film from adhesive layers thanks to a high level of ant istatic performance.<br><br>	The antistatic silicone release film according to the invention exhibits very good adhesiveness between a substrate and a coated layer because there does not occur interruption in curing a release layer, whereby the inventive film may be properly used for the aforementioned use thanks to stable release characteristics.<br><br>	The aforementioned and other objects and advantages of the invention<br>
will become apparent to those skilled in the art from reading the following description illustrating preferred embodiments of the invention.<br><br>
[Best Model]<br><br>	An antistatic silicone release film according to the invention to achieve the aforementioned objects is characterized in that it comprises a polyester film and a layer coated with an antistatic silicone release composition at least once on at least one side of the polyester film, wherein the antistatic silicone release film satisfies both of the following equations 1 and 2:<br><br>	SR12 (1) and  SAS80 (2)<br><br>	where SR(~/sq)' is a surface resistance of the coated layer and SAS(%) is a residual adhesiveness of the coated layer.<br><br>	Preferably, the antistatic silicone release film according to the invention is characterized in that the antistatic silicone release composition comprises organo polysi loxane, organo hydrogen polysi loxane, silane coupling agent, conductive polymer resin and platinum chelate catalyst.<br><br>	Preferably, the antistatic silicone release film according to the invention is characterized in that conductive polymer resin in the antistatic silicone release composition is produced by polymerizing polythiophene or derivatives thereof in polyanions.<br><br>
Preferably, the antistatic silicone release film according to the invention is characterized in that the amount of the conductive polymer resin in the ant istatic silicone release composition is 0.05 to 0.5 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of organo polvsiloxane,<br><br>	Preferably, the antistatic silicone release film according to the invention is characterized in that the amount of the silane coupling agent in the antistatic silicone release composition is 0.05 to I parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of organo polysiloxane.<br><br>	More preferably, the antistatic silicone release film according to the<br>
invention is characterized in that the antistatic silicone release composition comprises 1.2 to 5 parts by weight of a solid content.<br><br>	More preferably, the antistatic silicone release film according to the invention is characterized in that the amount of organo hydrogen polysiloxane in the antistatic silicone release composition has 0.5 to 1.2 hydrogen atoms coupled to a silicone atom in the organo hydrogen polysiloxane for one vinyl group of the organo polysiloxane.<br><br>	Hereinafter, the invention will be described in more detail with reference to the preferred embodiments of the invention.<br><br>	It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the embodiments are intended only to illustrate the invention in more detail, and the scope of the invention is not limited by those embodiments.<br><br>	The polyester film used in the invention is not limited to a specific type, and a known conventional polyester film can be used as a substrate film for antistatic coating. In the invention, exemplary polyester films are of polyester resins, e.g., polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, etc. It should be noted that a substrate for the antistatic coating composition of the invention is not limited to a polyester sheet or film.<br><br>	The polyester consisting of the film of the invention is obtained by polycondensing aromatic dicarboxylic acid and aliphatic glycol. Examples of the aromatic dicarboxylic acid include terephthalic acid, 2,6—naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, etc. Examples of the aliphatic glycol include ethylene glycol, diethylene glycole, 1,4—cyclohexane dimethanol, etc.<br><br>	Examples of polyester include polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene—2,6—naphthalene dicarboxylate (PEN), etc. The exemplary polyester may be of copolymers containing a third component. Examples of the dicarboxylic acid component of the copolymer polyester include isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, 2,6—napbthalene dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, oxycarboxvlic acid (e.g., P—oxybenzoic acid). Examples of the glycol component include ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol,propylene glycol, butanediol, 1,4—cyclohexane dimethanol, neopentyl glycol, etc.<br><br>	Two or more types of the components of dicarboxylic acid and glycol may be mixed and used. For the film of the invention, uniaxial or biaxial orientation films are used for all of high transparency, productivity and workability. The conductive polymer resin contained in the antistatic silicone release composition of the invention is preferably polyanions mixed with polythiopene or derivatives thereof in order to obtain antistatic performance. In particular, the conductive polymer resin is obtained by using independently or mixing the compounds represented in the following chemical formula 1 and the chemical formula 2 and then polymerizing the resultant mixture under polyanions,<br><br>	[Chemistry Figure 1]<br><br>
(Figure Removed )<br><br><br>	In the above chemical formula 1, R1 and R2 represent hydrogen atoms,<br>
		aliphatic hydrocarbon groups of Cl to 12,	alicyclic hydrocarbon groups or<br>
		aromatic hydrocarbon groups, respectively,	and correspond particularly to<br>
		methyl groups, ethyl groups, propyl groups,	isopropyl groups, butyl groups,<br>
		benzene groups, etc.<br>	 [Chemistry Figure 2]<br>
	(Figure Removed )<br><br>	Where n represents an integer of 1 to 4.<br><br>	The poly anions are acidic polymer, also polymeric carboxylic acid or<br>
polymeric stilfonic acid, polyvinyl sulfonic acid, etc. Examples of polymeric carboxylic acid are polyacrylic acid, polymerhacrylic acid, polymaleic acid, etc. An example of polymeric sulfonic acid is polystylene sulfonic acid, etc.<br><br>	In the meantime, in the invention, polymer emulsion is tised, which comprises 0.5 weight% of poly(3,4—ethylene dioxythiopene) and 0.8 weight% of polystylene sulfonic acid.<br><br>	The amount of the conductive polymer resin is 0.05 to 0.5 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of organo polysiloxane in the composition for forming layers coated with antistatic silicone release composition of the invention. If the amount thereof is less than 0.05 parts by weight, it is hard to make a film sufficiently antistatic. If the amount thereof is more than 0.5 parts by weight, platinun catalyst does not function and a problem is thus caused in the curing process.<br><br>	An exemplary molecular structure of organo polysiloxane of the invention is shown in the following chemical formula 3:<br>	[Chemistry Figure 3]<br>
	(Figure Removed )<br>	R1 is CHCH2, and<br>	R9 is CH2—CH2—CH9—CH2—CH= CH2. CH3,<br><br>	Where m and n are an integer greater than zero (0).<br><br>	The organo polysiloxane shown above contains a vinyl group in the molecule, where the vinyl group may be present in any part of the molecule, but preferably at the end of the nolecule in particular. It may be of a normal or branch type molecular structure, or a combination thereof. Organo hydrogen polysiloxane used as a hardener in the coating composition according to the invention has an exemplary molecular structure shown in the following chemical formula 4:<br><br>	[Chemistry Figure 4]<br>
	(Figure Removed )<br><br>	Where q and p are an integer greater than zero (0).<br><br>	The organo hydrogen polysiloxane has a normal branch or ring type molecular structure, or a combination thereof. Viscosity or molecular weight thereof is not limited to a specific value, but it must be well compatible with the organo polysiloxane. For the amount of the organo hydrogen polysiloxane in the invention, it is preferable that 0.5 to 1.2 hydrogen atoms are coupled to a silicone atom, on the basis of one vinyl group of the organo polysiloxane. If the number of hydrogen atoms coupled to a silicone atom is less than 5, on the basis of one vinyl group of organo polysiloxane, the composition is not cured well If the number of hydrogen atoms to be coupled thereto is more than 1.2, elasticity or physical properties may be deteriorated after a curing process. lo the meantime, in the antistatic silicone release composition according to the invention, if the amount of organo— hydrogen polysiloxane is more than that of organo polysiloxane, too much crosslinking is facilitated to cause reduced flexibility thus to create cracks in the resulting film and result in reduced smoothness in the film.<br><br>	The silane coupling agent in the antistatic silicone release composition according to the invention is an important component as a bridge between a substrate and a coated layer and for blocking functional groups acting as catalyst poison in the conductive polymer resin. Examples of the silane coupling agent in the invention include epoxy silane, amino silane, vinyl silane, methacryloxy silane, isocyanate silane coupling agents, etc.<br><br>	The platinum chelate complex used as a catalyst in the antistatic silicone release composition according to the invention I)lays an important role in curing the coating composition. If the coating composition and a coating substrate contain nitrogen, phosphor, sulfur compounds or polymeric<br><br>
substances of ion type, the platinum chelate complex cant function as a catalyst, and the silicone release comilposition is not completely cured to<br>
		lose release property or to result in lowered adhesiveness	between an<br>
		antistatic layer and a silicone layer, so that silicone is	transferred. In<br>
		the invention, the silane coupling agent is used to block the	functional<br>
		group in the antistatic silicone release composition in order	to prevent<br>
		interruption of curing. By coating with the mixture of an	antistatic<br>
		composition and a release composition only once, both of	antistatic<br>
		performance and release property is implemented.<br>	      The antistatic silicone release composition according to	the invention<br>
		is diluted to contain 1.2 to 5 weight% of a solid content based	on the total<br>
		weight of the coating composition and then coated on a polyester	film. The<br>
		solvent used in the coating composition is not limited to a	specific type,<br>
		provided that it can disperse the solids in the invention to be	coated on a<br>
		polyester film or antistatic polyester film, but is preferably	water. If the<br>
		amount of solid content in the antistatic silicone release	composition is<br>
		less than 1.2 weight%, it is hard to achieve a sufficient	peeling force for<br>
		adhesive and antistatic performance. If the amount thereof is	more than 5<br>
		weight%, transparency of a resultant film is lowered and aging	may be caused<br>
		in curing the coating composition.<br>	      Hereinafter, with the embodiments and comparative	examples of the<br>
		invention, the invention will be described in imiore detail.<br><br>	      Embodiment<br>	      Embodiment 1<br>

For the experiment, 3 µl of the following test reagent was applied with a micro syringe to the samples in which a 3M 810 adhesive tape was laminated on a silicone coated layer and taken off to decide a curing level depending on a degree of reagent spreading on the basis of a standard sample of an adhesive tape which was not laminated on a silicone release coated layer.<br>	— Test reagent	IPA + Violet pigment<br><br>	— IPA &gt; melts the 3M 810 adhesive layer, but cant melt a silicone release coated layer.

The experiment was carried out to measure solvent resistance of the film surface of the samples.<br><br>	For the measurement, after soaking a cotton stick in a specific organic solvent, the otton stick ran to and fro on the silicone coated film surface ten times at a speed of 5cm/sec with a load of 100g while keeping the angle of the cotton stick at 45 degrees. The state of the coated surface was evaluated on the basis of following criteria.<br><br><br><br>	Experimental example 6: Measuring rub—off property<br><br>	The silicone release coated layer was rubbed strongly with a finger to check a degree of silicone removal on the polyester film to see adhesive characteristics between a cured silicone layer and a substrate.<br><br>	[Table 1]<br>

TOL:	Toluene)<br><br>	As seen in the above table 1, it is known that the embodiments 1 to 3 of the invention can implement both of very good antistatic performance and stable release property. However, in case of the comparative example 1 in which an excessive amount of conductive polymer resin was added, curing of the coating composition was poor. In case of the comparative example 2 in which the amount of conductive polymer resin was not enough, antistatic performance was not achieved. In case of the comparative examples 3 and 4 in which antistatic agent was used that interrupts curing of the silicone release composition as described above in the invention, a curing level of a silicone release coated layer and adhesiveness between a substrate and a layer coated with a silicone release composition was poor.<br><br>	In this specification, only some examples of various embodiments carried out by the inventors are illustrated, but it should be noted that the technical scope of the invention is not limited thereto and may be of course modified and varied by those skilled in the art.<br>	From the foregoing description, it will be observed that various modifications and changes can be made without departing from the true sprit and scope of the present invention.
