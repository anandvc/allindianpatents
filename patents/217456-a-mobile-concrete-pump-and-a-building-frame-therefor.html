				<td>The invention concerns a mobile concrete pump comprising a<br>
building frame seated on the structure of a truck chassis, the<br>
building frame comprising two longitudinal side members<br>
mutually spaced apart by a free space and resting on said<br>
chassis structure, the building frame serving to receive a<br>
supporting device, a core pump with material supply container<br>
and functional units which form a distribution mast, as well as<br>
a driving assembly for actuating the functional units, which<br>
are arranged along with the core pump in the free space zone<br>
located between the two longitudinal side members. The<br>
invention further concerns a building frame for mobile concrete<br>
pumps.<br>
In mobile concrete pumps a prefabricated building frame is<br>
seated upon the structure of a truck chassis and connected<br>
therewith. The drive subassemblies for activating the<br>
functional units, during operation of the pump, are coupled to<br>
the truck motor via an auxiliary drive or a distributor<br>
transmission. Depending upon the model of pump, the drive<br>
subassemblies may include one or more hydraulic pumps as well<br>
as additional auxiliary pumps, for example for the drive of the<br>
stirring mechanism in the material supply container for the<br>
core pump.<br>
As the core pump, generally a two cylinder piston pump is<br>
employed, which includes two drive cylinders and conveyor<br>
cylinders connected hydraulically with each other in pairs, of<br>
which the pistons are pair-wise rigidly connected with each<br>
other via a common piston rod which passes through a water box,<br>
and are driven in counter-stroke via a hydraulic drive.<br><br>
Concrete is supplied via the material supply container, in<br>
which container a stirring mechanism and a pipe switch are<br>
located. The inward side of the pipe switch is alternatingly<br>
pivoted back and forth between the output side of the two<br>
conveyor cylinders, and communicates from it"s output side with<br>
a conveyor line, which extends along a distribution mast. The<br>
distribution mast is preferably an articulated mast, which is<br>
mounted to be rotatable about 360Â° on a mast rotation mount<br>
block or pedestal provided in the front area of the building<br>
frame and which mast, in the folded together transport<br>
position, lies on a rear mast bearing block.<br>
In known mobile concrete pumps the core pump is provided on the<br>
building frame in such a manner that it can be disassembled<br>
only with difficulty. It is conventionally welded on the<br>
building frame in the area of the water box. In order to be<br>
able to have access to the hydraulic aggregate of the drive<br>
subassembly, for example for repair purposes, the core pump and<br>
the drive aggregates must be disassembled. In order to be able<br>
to remove the drive aggregate, until now it had been necessary<br>
to completely disassemble the core pump. This is very labor<br>
intensive and time consuming. Besides this, due to the<br>
hydraulic fluid, it is possible for substantial complications<br>
to occur.<br>
For various types and sizes of the functional units various<br>
drive subassemblies are necessary. The variations in<br>
construction resulting therefrom produce a large number of<br>
varying installation situations. Therein it must be taken into<br>
consideration that the core pump, in an early building stage,<br>
must be seated in the building frame and be welded therewith in<br><br><br>
the area of the water box. For this reason a prefabrication of<br>
the building frame is not possible without precise advance<br>
notice of the exact version or model of construction.<br>
Beginning therewith it is the task of the person invention to<br>
improve the mobile concrete pumps with a building frame of the<br>
above described type in such a matter that the assembly of the<br>
functional units and the drive subassemblies is simplified and<br>
a prefabrication of the building frame is facilitated,<br>
For solving this task, the combination of characterizing<br>
features as set forth in Patent Claims 1, 14, 28 and 39 is<br>
proposed. The advantageous embodiments and further<br>
developments of the invention can be seen from the dependent<br>
claims.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment, the building frame<br>
includes a floating bearing bridging over the free space and a<br>
fixed bearing provided at its rearward end for releasable<br>
receiving of modular type pre-assembled core pump and the<br>
rigidly therewith connected material supply container. Thereby<br>
it is accomplished that the preassembled core pump can be<br>
introduced into the free space from the rearward end and be<br>
connected in simple manner with the bearing locations. A<br>
further improvement in this respect is achieved thereby, that<br>
the building frame includes slide rails leading to the mounting<br>
points for facilitating the assembly and disassembly of the<br>
core pump.<br>
The floating bearing is preferably a cross beam bridging over<br>
the free space, upon which the core pump is seated or against<br>
which the core pump bears. In order to dampen vibrations<br><br>
occurring during the pumping process, the cross beam is<br>
provided with a bearing surface comprised of an elastomeric<br>
plastic. A further improvement in this regard is achieved<br>
when the core pump is supported, in the area of the floating<br>
bearing, sideways against the longitudinal side members by<br>
elastomeric plastic buffers in a cushioned manner. Further,<br>
the core pump can be secured against lifting off from the<br>
floating bearing. For this purpose the core pump can include,<br>
for prevention of lifting off, for example at least one capture.<br>
mechanism connectible with the floating bearing, for example, a<br>
capture hook, bent lever, wedge plug or lynch pin catch<br>
mechanism. The core pump, which is preferably a hydraulically<br>
driven two cylinder piston pump, includes a water box through<br>
which the piston rods pass and with which it is seated upon the<br>
floating bearing.<br>
In order to be able to receive, various sizes of core pumps, the<br>
floating bearing can be positioned at various locations<br>
provided spaced apart longitudinally on the longitudinal side<br>
member. For this, the cross beam which forms the floating<br>
bearing is rigidly connected to the longitudinal side members,<br>
preferably is welded or is secured by threaded fasteners.<br>
In accordance with a further preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention it is envisioned that the hydraulic and electric<br>
control and circuit elements for the drive subassemblies and<br>
for the functional units connected thereto are collectively<br>
assembled on a control module provided at the rearward area of<br>
the building frame. For this the control module preferably<br>
includes the hydraulic valves and/or a hydraulic reservoir<br>
necessary for control, preferably assembled together in a<br>
hydraulic control block. The hydraulic lines leading to the<br><br>
drive subassembly for the control module are preferably run<br>
along the inner surface of the longitudinal side member of the<br>
building frame.<br>
A preferred or alternative embodiment of the invention<br>
envisions that the building frame includes mounting means for<br>
the releasable receiving of carrier frames of various sizes,<br>
bridging over the free space, and equippable modularly with<br>
various drive subassemblies. This can be accomplished for<br>
example in that the building frames are provided, on the inner<br>
surfaces of the longitudinal side members facing the free<br>
space, with mounting rails extending . in the longitudinal<br>
direction, that on the longitudinal side members respectively<br>
at least two journal bearings are provided spaced apart from<br>
each other, projecting transverse to the free space, for<br>
receiving the carrier frame for the drive subassembly, and that<br>
the journal bearings respectively include a base plate, with<br>
which they are releasably securable to the mounting rail.<br>
By this means it is possible to prefabricate the building frame<br>
even without knowing the drive subassemblies to be employed<br>
later. This is accomplished above all in that the mounting<br>
rails include multiple screw bore holes open transverse to the<br>
free space, with detents separated longitudinally from each<br>
other with defined spacing, and that the base plates exhibit at<br>
least two through holes for securing screws spaced apart from<br>
each other in the detent separation of the screw bore holes.<br>
The detent separation between the screw bore holes can be so<br>
selected, that a group of detent positions is provided which<br>
satisfies all carrier frames existing as a practical matter, to<br>
which the mounting pins can be subsequently secured.<br><br>
A further preferred embodiment of the invention envisions that<br>
the mounting rails exhibit a square profile, and that the base<br>
plates exhibit on their broad side opposite to the journal<br>
bearing a cross section opening which is edge open<br>
complimentary to the square profile of the mounting rails, with<br>
which they are form fittingly or engagingly seatable upon the<br>
mounting rails and fixable with the securing screws.<br>
In order to be able to position the journal bearings in various<br>
heights relative to the mounting rails, it is proposed in<br>
accordance with a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention, that the journal bearing is eccentric with regard to<br>
the profile recess and provided on the base plate preferably<br>
centrally in the longitudinal direction. On the other hand the<br>
through hole is positioned with respect to the profile recess<br>
preferably centrally and in the longitudinal direction is<br>
spaced apart from the journal bearing eccentrically on the base<br>
plate.<br>
The journal bearings can be welded to the base plate. A<br>
particularly stable and, in addition, space saving connection<br>
is accomplished when the journal bearing exhibits a flange with<br>
a rearward facing plug pin and is inserted with the plug pin<br>
until abutment of the flange in the bore of the base plate and<br>
is then welded therewith. A beaming eye can be seated upon<br>
each journal bearing, which is preferably releasably secured to<br>
the carrier frame, preferably by threaded fastener means. In<br>
order to dampen the vibrations occurring during pump operation,<br>
the bearing eye is padded with a preferably elastically<br>
deformable plastic towards the journal bearing.<br><br>

The mobile concrete pump shown in Fig. 1 and 2 includes a truck<br>
chassis 10 with a motor driven chassis structure 12 and a<br>
driver cabin 14, of which the motor drive can be coupled to the<br>
rear axles 18 via a drive shaft 16. The chassis 10 carries a<br>
concrete pump 20, which is connected via a building frame 22<br>
with the structure 12. The concrete pump assembly essentially<br>
includes a core pump 24 with two hydraulic drive cylinders 26,<br>
two conveyor cylinders 30 connected pair wise with the drive<br>
cylinders 26 via a water box 28, and a material supply<br>
container 32 provided rigidly on the other end of the conveyor<br>
cylinder 30. The assembly further includes a pressure<br>
conveyance line 34, which runs along a distribution mast 36<br>
which is an articulated mast and includes an end hose on the<br>
end of the last mast arm for emission of conveyed concrete to<br>
the location being concretized. The distribution mast 36 is<br>
mounted rotatably about a vertical axis on a mast rotation<br>
bearing block 44 rigidly connected with the building frame in<br>
the vicinity of one end. On the rearward end of the building<br>
frame 22 a mast receiving bearing 46 is provided, upon which<br>
the distribution mast 36 rests in the folded together transport<br>
condition. Further, a stabilizing device 38 with extendable<br><br>
support legs 40 is provided. During concretizing operation the<br>
support legs are deployed and supported on the ground, lifting<br>
the structure 12. The hydraulic drive of the core pump 24, the<br>
distribution mast 36 and the support legs 40 occurs via a drive<br>
subassembly 42, comprised of hydraulic pumps 44, which are<br>
drivable via a drive shaft 16 coming from the vehicle motor.<br>
The drive subassembly 42 is mounted upon a carrier frame 48,<br>
which in practice is referred to a "drive stool". Depending<br>
upon the type of pump, pump power, manner and size of support<br>
device various drive subassembly 42 and therewith various<br>
carrier frames 48 are needed.<br>
The building frame 22 includes two longitudinal side members<br>
50, which are fixed upon the structure 12, spaced apart<br>
sideways from each other to thereby form a free space 52. The<br>
free space 52 is so dimensioned that the core pump 24 extends<br>
diagonally therethrough. The core pump lies, in che area of<br>
the water box 28, on a cross beam 54 bridging over the free<br>
space 52, with its ends welded or screwed to the longitudinal<br>
side members 50, which cross beam has on its upper surface a<br>
flat plastic coating 55. The cross beam 54 functions as a<br>
floating bearing for the core pump, which is besides this<br>
fixed, on the rearward end of the building frame 22, to "a<br>
frame-fixed bearing 56.<br>
In the area of the floating bearing the core pump is secured<br>
with the aid of a capture mechanism 57, 57", 57", 57"" against<br>
lifting from the cross beam 54. In Fig. 9a - d various<br>
embodiments of this type of capture mechanism are illustrated:<br>
capture hook 57, bent lever 57", cotter pin with spring lock<br>
57" and through bolt with wedge securing 57"".<br><br>
The fixed bearing 56 is located on two extension arms 59 of the<br>
material supply container 32 rigidly provided spaced apart from<br>
each other. Releasable couplings are provided on the fixed<br>
bearings, with various embodiments of 56a - h shown in Figs.<br>
10a - h:<br>
56a a horizontal centering wedge, which is secured by a<br>
locking lever;<br>
56b a vertical centering wedge, which is secured by a spring<br>
clip or a not shown pin;<br>
56c a horizontal bolt, which is cushioned by a rubber-metal<br>
element shock absorber;<br>
56d a vertical bolt, which is cushioned by a rubber-metal-<br>
element;<br>
56e a switch coupling;<br>
56f a wedge coupling without cushioning element;<br>
56g a wedge coupling with cushioning element;<br>
56h a hook coupling.<br>
The capturing mechanisms in the area of the floating bearing<br>
shown in Fig. 9 a - d as well as the coupling mechanisms in the<br>
area of the fixed bearing 56 shown in Figs. 10 a - h have the<br>
advantage, that they can be easily fixed or released.<br><br>
The carrier frame 48 is located below the forward end of the<br>
hydraulic drive cylinder 26 of the core pump 24. It is huna<br>
there within the free space 52 on at least four mounting<br>
bearings 58, which are secured to the inner surface 60 of the<br>
longitudinal side members 50 facing the free space 52 and<br>
facing in the direction of the free space 52. In order to be<br>
able to seat various sizes of. carrier frame 48 on the one-and-<br>
the-same building frame 22, the longitudinal side members 50<br>
carry on their inner surface 60 respectively one mounting rant<br>
52, which has a square cross sectional profile and which<br>
exhibits screw holes 64 open toward the free space 52 in<br>
defined lock or detent spacing separation sequenti ally in the<br>
longitudinal direction. The journal bearings 58 carry for<br>
their part respectively one base plate 66, which exhibits two<br>
through holes 68 for the securing screws 70 provided spaced<br>
apart from each other in the spacing separation of the screw<br>
bore holes 64, with which they are securable in defined<br>
locations on the mounting rails 62. On their broadside<br>
opposite to the journal bearings 58 the base plate 66 exhibit<br>
an edge open profile recessed 72 complimentary tc the square<br>
shape of the mounting rails 62, via which they are form<br>
fittingly seatable upon the mounting rails 62 and securable<br>
with the securing screws 70 and the screw bore holes 64. As<br>
can be seen particularly in Fig. 6a and b, the journal bearing<br>
58 is provided eccentrically relative to the profile recess 72<br>
and in the longitudinal direction centrally upon the base plate<br>
66. On the other hand, the through holes 68 are central with<br>
respect to the profile recesse and, in the longitudinal<br>
direction, are eccentric, spaced apart from the journal<br>
bearings provided on the base plate 66. With this means it is<br>
accomplished that the base plates 66 are securable to the<br><br>
mounting rail with journal bearings provided offset either<br>
upwards (Fig. 3b, 4b, 5a) or downwards (Fig. 3a, 4a, 5b).<br>
As can be seen from Figs. 5a, b, 6b, the journal bearings 58<br>
are welded on their base plate 66. The journal bearings<br>
exhibit for this purpose the flange 74 and a rearward plug pin<br>
76. They are inserted with their plug pin 76 until abutment<br>
with the flange 74 in the bore 78 of the base plate and there<br>
are welded with the base plate via various welding seams 80,<br>
82.<br>
On each journal bearing 58 a bearing eye 84 is insertable or<br>
seatable, which for its part is provided with a fastener or<br>
mount 86, with which is securable in a screw position 88<br>
provided for this purpose (Fig. 8c) on one of the carrier or<br>
bearing flanges 90 of the carrier frame 48. Depending upon the<br>
breadth of the carrier frame 48, journal bearings 58 with<br>
various thicknesses of flange 74 can be employed (compare Fig.<br>
5a and b). For absorbing or cushioning the vibration occurring<br>
during the puming process, the bearing eyes 84 are padded with<br>
an elastomeric material 92 towards the journal bearing 58. As<br>
can be seen from Fig. 3a, b as well as 4a, b, various carrier<br>
frames can be mounted with simple means on the mounting rails<br>
62 of the building frame 22, which makes possible the varying<br>
of the positions and orientations of the journal bearings 58.<br>
The hydraulic and electrical control and circuit elements for<br>
the drive subassembly 42 and for the functional units connected<br>
thereto, such as core pump 24, outrigger or support device 38<br>
and distribution mast 36 are assembled into a control module 94<br>
provided in the rear area of the building frame 22. The<br>
control module 94 includes, among other things, the hydraulic<br><br>
valves and/or hydraulic reservoir 94 necessary for the control,<br>
preferably assembled into a hydraulic control block 96. The<br>
hydraulic and electric lines leading from the control module 94<br>
to the drive subassembly 42 are laid along the inner side of<br>
the longitudinal side members 54 of the building frame 22 and<br>
can be coupled or decoupled via p.lug connections lor assembly<br>
and disassembly in simple manner. Further, in the rear<br>
portion of the building frame 22 ahead of the control module 94<br>
there is a large water tank 98 with integrated water pump. The<br>
water is needed for the final cleaning of the concrete pump<br>
following the pumping operation.<br>
In conclusion, the following can be summarized: The invention<br>
concerns a mobile concrete pump comprising a building frame 22<br>
which can be arranged on the structure 12 of a truck chassis 10<br>
and serves to maintain a supporting device 38, a core pump 24<br>
and functional units which form a distribution mast 36. The<br>
building frame 22 comprises two longitudinal side members 50<br>
mutually spaced apart by a free space 52 and resting on said<br>
chassis structure 12. Said mobile concrete pump further<br>
comprises a driving assembly 42 for actuating the functional<br>
units, which are arranged with the core pump 24 in the free<br>
space zone 52 located between the two longitudinal side members<br>
50. The invention aims at providing a mobile concrete pump<br>
whereof the building frame 22 can be easily mounted and<br>
dismounted. Therefore, said building frame 22 comprises a<br>
floating bearing 54 which links said side members across the<br>
free space, as well as a fixed bearing 56 arranged at the reat<br>
end of the building frame and serving to support releasably the<br>
core pump which is pre-assembled in modular manner. The<br>
building frame further comprises mounting means 62 designed to<br>
support releasably supporting carrier frames 48 of different<br><br>
sizes which link said side members across the free space 52 and<br>
which may be equipped in modular manner with various driving<br>
subassemblies 42.<br>
The originally filed patent claims are basically only one<br>
attempt at describing the invention. The invention is not<br>
limited to these claims, but rather can be varied in many ways<br>
in the framework of the disclosure. All new individual and<br>
combined characteristics in the description and/or figures are<br>
considered inventive.<br><br>
