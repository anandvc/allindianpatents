CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
Reference is made to the following issued patents; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,310,687; 5,591.581; 5.597,910; 5.705,402; 5,846,485; 6,066,448; 6,214,552; and 6,207,369. The disclosure of each of these references is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to labels, preferably metal-containing labels for use in assays. In particular, the invention relates to metal labels having ligands substituted with hydrophilic and/or charged groups that prevent the non-specific binding ("NSB") of labeled substances to other materials. The invention also relates to methods for conducting assays, preferably luminescence assays, that use these labels and to kits and compositions containing these labels.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Documents cited in this application relate to the state-of-the-art to which this invention pertains. The disclosures of each of these references are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Electrcchemiluminescence (ECL) detection has become an important analytical technique and has been applied in genera] analysis and diagnostic procedures. Etectrochemiluminescence involves electrogenerated species and the emission of light. For example, electrcchemiluminescence may involve luminescence generated by a process in which one or more reactants are generated electrochemical ly and undergo one or more chemical reactions to produce species that emits light, preferably repeatedly.<br>
In practice, most ECL-based assays involve the use of electrochemiluminescent compounds as labels. The presence of a labeled substance or the participation of a labeled substance in a binding reaction is determined via detection of etectrochemiluminescence from the ECL label. Assays for analytes based on the use of labeled binding reagents speciflc for an analyte of interest may be homogenous in nature<br><br>
(see US Patent No. 5,591,581 and Published PCT Application WO87/06706) or may involve binding reactions occurring on a solid phase such as a magnetic particle (see US Patent No. 5,705.402) or an electrode surface (see US Patent Nos. 6,066,448 and 6,207,369 and Published PCT Application W098/12539).<br>
An important class of ECL labels is organometallic complexes of ruthenium, osmium or rhenium having one or more polydentate heterocyclic nitrogen containing Ijgands (e.g., bipyridine, pbenanthrohne, bipyrazine, bipyrimidJne, etc., orsubstimted derivatives thereof) such as those described in US Patent Nos. 5,310,687; 5,597,910; and 5,591,581 and Published PCT Application WO87/06706. These types of labels (in particular, labels based on tm-bipyridyl ruthenium complexes) have found considerable use because of their stability and the efCciency at which they produce ECL.<br>
In commercial ECL instrumentation, ECL from these labels is typically produced by oxidizing the labels in the presence of an ECL coreactant, such as tripropytamine. The ECL coreactant is also oxidized at the electrode to produce a strong reductant (see, e.g., US Patent No. 5.846,485). The highly energetic reaction of the reductant and the oxidized label leads to reduction and excitation of the label to a luminescent excited state. Emission of a photon regenerates the label in its original state and allows for detection of the label.<br>
ElectFochemiluminescence is an extremely sensitive detection technique. The sensitivity of the detection technique Is often, however, not the determining &amp;ctor for the sensitivi^ of a particular assay. In assays that involve the specific binding interaction between a labeled binding reagent and a binding parmer (e.g., an analyte), the sensitivity is often limited by the background signal resulting from the non-specific binding (NSB) of the labeled binding reagent with substances other than the binding partner, e.g., other components of crude samples, other assay reagents, or in tiie case of solid phase binding assays, the solid phase itself. In some cases, NSB may also lead to a lowering of signals through loss of reagent on the surfaces of containers, pipettes, etc. While ECL labels generally have bett«: NSB properties than odier classes of labels, under certain conditions NSB may be a limiting fector in assay sensitivity. This occurs, for example, in i) ECL assays using labeled binding reagents, where the binding reagent itself exhibits high levels of NSB; ii) ECL assays using binding reagents labeled with large numbers of<br><br>
labels and iii) ECL assays carried out using low concentrations of blockers of NSB (such as blocking proteins or detergents) or carried out in the absence of such blockers.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to improved labels for use in assays for measuring an analytc of interest. The word "measurement" and verb forms of "to measure" as used herein refer to both quantitative and qualitative determinations. "Measurement" is understood to include the comparison of a quantity relative to one or more threshfaold values or standards, as well as determinations carried out to detect the presence of something and/or the occurrence of an event (e.g., the presence of an analyte or label in a solution or the emission of luminescence). One preferred embodiment of the invention relates to luminescent organometallic complexes usefiil as labels in ECL<br><br>
assays. The complexes comprise one or more substituted pnenantnroiine or bipyridlne metal ligands, at least one of the metal iigands having substituents that prevent non¬specific binding of the ligand (such ligands are referred to hereafter as low NSB ligands). Preferred low NSB substituents comprise negatively charged groups. Negatively charged groups are understood to include neutral or positively charged groups that may be deprotonated in water to a negatively charged state (i.e., having pK^s between 0 and 14). Suitable negatively charged groups include carboxylates, phosphates, phosphonates, sulfates and sulfonates (as well as their protonated forms). Preferably, the ne^tively charged group will not react under the conditions used to couple amines and carboxylic acids through amide bonds. Preferred negatively charged groups include sulfates and, most preferably, sulfonate groups due to their high stability, low pK,, and relative insensitivity to the conditions and reagents used to couple amines and carboxylic acids to form amide bonds (e.g., a sulfonate on one ligand of a metal complex will not interfere with the use of a carbodiimide to couple a carboxylic acid on another ligand with an aminc-containjng reagent. Phosphates and phosphonates are also useful, although they will react with some carboxylic acid activating reagents such as carbodiimidcs; when these reactions occur under aqueous conditions the products of these reactions are often unstable and do not affect the final result of a conjugation reaction. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the bipyridine or phenanthroline ligands are substituted with substituents that compnse neutral hydrophiUc groups, preferably hydroxy] groups or carboxamides, or positively charged groups, preferably, guanidinium groups (such ligands are also most preferably chosen so as to be insensitive to standard conditions used to make amide bonds).<br>
The ligands are designed so that organometallic complexes comprising the ligands will give, relative to analogous organometallic complexes comprising unsubstituted bipyridines or phenanthroiines, lower non-specific binding while, preferably, also giving comparable (within a &amp;ctor of 2) or better ECL signals on a per label basis. The negatively charged groups are, preferably, not directly linked to the phenanthroline or bipyridine rings but are attached through linkers such as alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and/or phenyl linkers so as to not have detrimental effect on the ECL properties of organometallic complexes comprising the ligand (e.g., by affecting the redox properties,<br><br>
quantum yields of luminescence, energy of the excited states, or iaoei stability). Such linkers may include heteroatoms in the linking chain or as substituents, although these heteroatoms are, preferably, not directly bonded to the bipyridine or phenanthroline rings (e.g., carbons in an alkyl linking chain may be replaced with oxygens to form one or more aikyi ether linkages or oligo-ethylene glycol linkers). Preferred linkers are phenyl and alkyl groups. Short (one to five carbon) alkyl groups are especially preferred due their relatively minor influence on ECL and their relative inability to unfold or denature proteins when incorporated in organometalUc labels attached to the protein. Single carbon linkers are most preferred since they screen the bipyridine or phenanthroline moieties from the low NSB functional group while not providing additional hydrophobic surface area or substantially increasing the effective volume of the label.<br>
The Iigands are preferably disubstituted at the 5 and 5' positions or, most preferably, the 4 and 4' positions for bipyridy! Iigands or the 3 and 8 or, most preferably, the 4 and 7 positions for phenanihrolyi Iigands; in metal complexes, these positions have high solvent accessibility and exhibit limited steric crowding. Exemplary low NSB Iigands are shown below for bipyridines substituted at the 4 and 4' positions and phenanthrolines substituted at the 4 and 7 positions. Other substitution patterns are not shown but can be defined by analogy.<br><br><br>

The present invention relates to organometaliic complexes comprising one of the aforementioned low NSB ligands chelated to a meta! atom, e.g., Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Re, Os, Ir, Pt. Fe, Tc. Cr, Mo and W. An important class of such complexes is luminescent ECL-active complexes of Ru and Os, preferably in the Ru(II) or Os(Il) oxidation states. The invention includes complexes with the formula ML'3, where L^ is a &gt; low NSB ligand of the invention and M is Ru or Os, preferably in the Ru(II) or Os(II) oxidation states. It is understood that notations like ML^j or ML'L^2. as used herein, do not exclude the complexes from having an overall net charge (as determined by the charge state of the ligands and the oxidation state of the metal) and that the complexes may be associated with counterions so as to form a composition with an overall neutral charge. The ML^ class of complexes is especially useful in applications that use free unconjugated ECL-aciive compounds (see, e.g., US Patent No. 5,641,623) and should reduce adsorption of complex to most electrode surfaces.<br>
In applications that use ECL-active complexes as labels, a particularly useful class of complexes have the formula ML'L^I, where M is Ru or Os (preferably in the Ru(il) or Os(n) oxidation states), L^ is a low NSB ligand as described above, and L' is a substituted bipyridine or phenanthroline that is covalently linked to a biological molecule, binding reagent, enzyme substrate or other assay reagent (i.e., to form a labeled reagent, where "label" refers to the metal complex component of the labeled reagent) or, alternatively, has a substituent that is capable of being covalently conjugated to a biological molecule, binding reagent, enzyme substrate or other assay reagent so as to form a labeled reagent. Such ligands may be referred to herein as linking ligands.<br><br>
Biological materials refers herein to materials of biological origin or synthetic analogs rtiereof, e.g., amino acids, nucleosides, nucleotides, proteins, peptides (and peptidomimetics), nucleic acids (as well as analogs having modified bases or unnatural linkages, e.g., PNAs), hormones, vitamins, sugars, second messengers, polysaccharides, steroids, lipids, phospholipids, cells, organdies, subcellular fragments, viruses, prions, etc. Binding reagents are reagents capable of participating in a specific binding interaction with another material. Examples of binding reagents include: enzymes, antibodies (and fragments thereof), receptors, ligands of biological receptors, metal Ugands, nucleic acids, nucleic acid intercalators, nucleic acid major and minor groove binders, haptens, avidin, streptavidin, biotin, purification tags (such as FLAG, myc, glutathione S-transferase, His-tag, etc.), binding partners of purification tags (such as specific antibodies, glutathione, nitrilotriacetic acid, iminodiacetic acid, etc.), etc. Enzyme substrates include molecules that are transformed in enzyme-catalyzed reactions and include cofactors, nucleic acids that are joined or cleaved by enzymes, and peptides that are joined or cleaved by enzymes.<br>
Examples of functional groups that when present on the ligand are suitable for conjugating the ligand to a biological material, binding reagent, enzyme substrate or other assay reagent include functional groups known in the art of conju^tion chemistiy such as: amines, thiols, hydrazides, carboxylic acids, activated carboxylic acids (e.g., acyl chlorides and active esters such as N-hydroxysuccinimide esters), hydroxyls, alkyl halides, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, sulfonyl chlorides, activated phosphates, phosphonates or phosphoramidites, alkenes, alkynes, active carbamates and carbonates, aldehydes, ketones, maletmides, disulfides, a,|5 unsaturated carbonyls, carbon linked to leaving groups such as halides, mesyl, tosyt, tresyl, etc. For further information on useful fimctionai groups for conjugating labels to reagents and useful conjugation techniques, the reader is directed to G. Hermanson, A. Mallia and P. Smith, Immobilized Affinity Ligand Techniques (Academic Press, San Diego, 1992) and G. Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques (Academic Press. San Diego, 1996), these references hereby incorporated by reference. Preferred functional groups include amines, carboxylic acids, active esters and, most preferably, N-hydroxy succinimide esters. Preferably, such functional groups are linked to a bipyridine or phenanthroline ring via a linker chain comprising alkyl,<br><br>
alkenyl, alkynyl and/or phenyl groups so as to limit the effect of the functional group on ECL. Such linkers may include faeteroatoms in the linking chain or as substitucnts, although these heteroaloms are, preferably, not directly bonded to the bipyridine or phenanthroline rings (e.g., carbons in an alkyl linking chain may be replaced with oxygens to form alkyl ethers or oligo(ethylene glycol linkers). The ligands are preferably substituted at the 5 and/or 5' positions or most preferably at the 4 and/or 4' positions for bipyridyl ligands or preferably substituted at the 3 and/or 8 or most preferably at the 4 and/or 7 positions for phenanlhrolyl ligands; in metal complexes, these positions exhibit limited sleric crowding. Examples of suitable linking ligands are shown below. The ligands are shown as being substituted at Uie 4 and 4' positions for bipyridine or the 4 and 7 positions for phenanthroline, however, the strucmres of ligands with other substitution patterns are clear by analogy.<br><br>

In some embodiments of the invention, the labels of the invention are covaiently linked to another substance (e.g., a biological material, binding reagent, enzyme substrate or other assay reagent) and are used as labels to allow the measurement of the substance.

The labels and labeled materials of the invention are useful in a wide variety of known assay formats employing metaj complexes, preferably, luminescent metal complexes, e.g., assays based on the measurement of photoluminescence intensity, time resolved photoluminescence, luminescence energy transfer, luminescence quenching, luminescence lifetime, luminescence polarization, chemiluminescence or, preferably, electrochemiluminescence. For examples of methods for conducting ECL assays, the reader is directed towards U.S. Patents Nos. 5,591,581; 5,641,623; 5,643,713; 5,705,402; 6,066,448; 6,165,708; 6.207,369; and 6,214,552 and Published PCT Applications WO87/06706 and W098/12539, these references hereby incorporated by reference. Preferably, the use of the luminescent metal complexes of the invention leads to improved assay performance through low non-specific binding of the complex relative to analogous complexes not presenting low NSB functional groups. The use of the luminescent metal complexes, preferably, leads to an improvement in a given assay in the ratio of specific to non-specific signal of greater than or equal to a factor of two, or more preferably, greater than or equal to a factor of 5.<br>
In some applications, the luminescent metal complexes of the invention are used as labels to allow the monitoring of assay reagents such as enzyme substrates or binding reagents. We have found thai reagents labeled with the luminescent metal complexes of the invention (especially complexes presenting negatively charged groups) show significant decreases in non-specific binding relative to reagents labeled with analogous complexes that do not present low NSB functional groups. The use of the luminescent metal complexes of the invention significantly reduces the requirement for blocking reagents to reduce non-specific binding, reduces the loss of reagents on the surfaces of containers and fluidic lines, and reduces non-specific signals due to non-specific interactions of labeled binding reagents. These effects are most pronounced when reagents, e.g., antibodies and other proteins, are liiUted to multiple labels. We have prepared reagents linked to 4-7, 7-10, 10-15,15-20 and greater than 20 labels and observed only minor amounts of non-specific binding. By going to higher numbers of labels per reagent, assay signals may be increased (relative to assays using luminescent<br><br>
metal complexes not presenting low NSB functional groups) 2-5 fold» 5-10 fold, or greater, while maintaining equivalent or significantly improved ratios of specific to non¬specific signals. Alternatively, under conditions that give equivalent specific signals, the ratio of specific to non-specific signal is greatly improved.<br>
Many assay formats employ solid-phase supports so as to couple the measurement of an analyte or activity to the separation of labeled reagents into solution-phase and solid phase supported portions. Examples include solid-phase binding assays that measure the formation of a complex of a material and its specific binding partner (one of the pair being immobilized, or capable of being immobilized, on the solid phase support), the formation of sandwich complexes (including a capture reagent that is immobilized, or capable of being immobilized, on the solid phase support), the competition of two competitors for a binding partner (the binding partner or one of the competitors being immobilized, or capable of being immobilized, on the solid phase support), the enzymatic or chemical cleavage of a label (or labeled material) from a reagent that is immobilized, or capable of being immobilized on a solid phase support and the enzymatic or chemical attachment of a label (or labeled material) to a reagent that is immobilized or capable of being immobilized on a solid-phase support, the amount of analyte or activity is determined by measuring the amount of label on the solid phase support and/or in solution, measurements typically being conducted via a surface selective technique, a solution selective technique, or after separation of the two phases. The term "capable of being immobilized" is used herein to refer to reagents that may participate in reactions in solution and subsequently be captured on a solid phase during or prior to the detection step. For example, the reagent may be captured using a specific binding partner of the reagent that is immobilized on the solid phase. Aitemativeiy, the reagent is linked to a capture moiety and a specific binding partner of the capture moiety is immobilized on the solid phase. Examples of useful capture moiety-binding partner pairs include biotin-streptavidin (or avidin), antibody-hapten, receptor-ligand, nucleic acid - complementary nucleic acid, etc.<br>
It is particularly important in solid phase binding assays that labeled reagents do not bind non-specificatly to the solid phase because that binding can result in non¬specific signal and significantly reduce the sensitivity of assays. We have tested reagents<br><br>
labeled with labels of the invention in ECL assays using magnetic panicles as sojia pnase supports and ECL assays using electrodes as solid phase supports. In both cases, comparisons to assays using labels that do not present low NSB functional groups showed that assays using the labels of the invention could be optimized to work with moreheavily labeled reagents (e.g., 4-7, 7-10,10-15,15-20 and greater than 20 labels per reagent), to give higher signals (e.g., 2-5 fold, 5-10 fold, or greater improvements) and to produce higher ratios of specific to non-specific signals (e.g., 1-2 fold, 2-S fold or greater than 5-foId improvements). The labels of the invention have proved to be particularly beneficial in preventing the non-specific binding of labels and labeled reagents to carbon-containing electrodes used as supports for solid phase assays and/or as electrodes for inducing ECL. Such eiectrodes include eJectrodes comprising carbon fibrils or other carbon particles such as plastic composite electrodes comprising carbon fibrils or carbon part:icles dispersed in a polymeric matrix. Beneficial effects have also been observed in assays carried out on electrodes comprising a thin layer of carbon ink supported on a<br>
support (as described in copending application	entitled "Assay Plates,<br>

In some experiments, excess EDC was removed immediately after the preparation of the NHS ester by one of the following methods: 1) purification of the product by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-15 using water as the eluent; ii) passage of the product through a short column of SP-Scphadex C25 in the sodium form and elution with water or iii) loading of the product on a reverse phase chromatography medium and elution with water/acetonitrile. NHS ester made under one of these aqueous conditions was used immediately after preparation/purification (as described in Example 17).<br>

Example 17. Labelingof Antibodies with NHS Esters<br>
Antibodies were dissolved in PBS-1 buffer (ISO mM potassium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.8) at concentrations greater than or equal to 2 mg/mL. ECL labels functionalized with NHS esters (prepared as described in Example 16) were added in water, DMF or DMSO (the final concentration of organic solvent should remain 
Example 18. A comparison of sandwich immunoassays on carbon electrodes using antibodies labeled with complexes 20,8. and 10.<br>
Plastic composite electrodes comprising carbon nanotubes (fibrils) dispersed in ethy!ene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA) were treated with an ammonia/nitrogen plasma so as to expose fibrils on the surface and introduce amine groups. An immobilized layer of strepuvidin was introduced by treating the surface with SMCC (Pierce Chemical) and then reacting the surface with streptavidin (labeled with Traut's reagent to introduce thiol groups).<br>
Sandwich immunoassays for a-fetoprotein (AFP) were carried out using 3/16" disks of the streptavidin-coated electrodes as solid phase supports and using antibodies, antibody diluents and calibrator diluents fixim the Elecsys AFP Assay (Roche Diagnostics). The Roche kit uses a biotin-labeled capture antibody and a detection antibody labeled with complex 20. To compare the labels of the invention, the labeled detection antibody of the kit was replaced with the same antibody but labeled with varying amounts of labels 20,8, and 10 as described in Example 17. The streptavidin-<br><br>
coated electrode was contacted with the capture antibody, one of the labeled detection antibodies and a sample containing calibrator diluent (an artificial serum substinite containing bovine serum albumin and bovine IgG) spiked with 1864 ng/mL AFP. A negative control was also run using unspiked calibrator diluent. The assay mixtures were incubated over the electrodes to allow the sandwich complex to form after which the disks were washed with phosphate buffer and transferred to an ECL cell. ECL was measured by contacting the composite electrode with a solution containing tripropylamine (ORIGEN Assay Buffer, IGEN) and scanning the potential at the composite electrode to ~2.3 V.<br>
Figure 1 shows the non-specific signal (i.e., the signal in the absence of analyte) and the specific signal (the dilTerence between the signal in the presence of analyte and the signal in the absence of analyte). The figure shows that labels 8 (presenting negatively charged phosphonate ester groups) and 10 (presenting neutral hydrophilic cartioxamide groups) gave roughly the same specific signal as tiie conventional ECL label 20 and that the specific signal increased roughly linearly with the number of labels per protein. The labels showed significant and unexpected differences, however, in the amount of non-specific binding. The non-specific signal of label 20 increased exponentially with the number of labels per protein.   By contrast, label 10 presenting neutral hydrophilic carboxamide groups showed less NSB and label 8 presenting negatively charged showed negligible NSB even at high numbers of labels per protein. Assay signal (S) as welt as assay signal to background (S/B) can be improved by using label 8 because the number of labels per antibody can be increased (relative to conventional labels) without increasing NSB signals. The peak S/B measured with label 8 was greater than twice that measure with label 20. Using the optimal ratios of label to protein (as determined by S/B), the signal measured with label 8 was eight times greater than that measured with label 20.<br>
Example 19. A comparison of sandwich immunoassays on carbon electrodes using antibodies labeled with complexes 20.2.15.12.17 and 15.<br>
AFP assays were carried out as described in Example 18 except that the capture antibody was directly adsorbed on oxygen plasma treated fibril-EVA composite<br><br>
electrodes prior to conducting the assay and the calibrators (0 and 2200 ng/mL) were prepared in human serum. Figure 2 shows that the specific signals from antibodies labeled with complexes 20,2, and 15 were roughly similar except for antibodies highly labeled with the bathophenanthroline containing complex 15; we hypothesize that at high labeling ratios the large planar aromatic structure was able to either sterically block binding or denature the antibody and affect its activity. As also observed in Example 18, Figure 2 shows that the non-specific signals from antibodies labeled with complexes having negatively charged ligands were low even at high numbers of labels per antibody, while the non-specific signal from the conventional label 20 went up exponentially with number of labels per antibody. The optimized S/B obtained using label 2 was greater than 5 times the optimized S/B obtained with label 20. Using the optimal ratios of label to protein (as determined by S/B), the signal measured with label 2 was more than three times greater than that measured with label 20. In similar assays (data not shown), antibodies labeled with a complex presenting sulfate groups (complex 12) behaved similarly to those labeled with complex 2. Antibodies labeled with the Os analog of complex 15, in general, showed similar low non-specific binding although the specific signals tended to be roughly 30-50% of the Ru complex. Antibodies labeled with the non-sulfonated version of complex 15 (i.e., complex 14), in general, gave higher backgrounds and lower signals even at low ratios of label to protein. We hypothesize that the highly hydrophobic complex interfered with antibody function. In similar assays, the highly positively charged complex 17 gave extremely high non-specific signals (at - 5-6 labels per antibody, the non-specific signal was more than 100 times the non-specific signal from antibodies labeled with complex 2). This result shows that the excellent behavior of the negatively charged complexes is not simply due to having hydrophilic charged groups but that the sign of the charge is important. We hypothesize thai complex 17 may find use in some selected applications where assays are carried out near highly positively charged surfaces (the positive charge would be beneficial in those conditions for preventing NSB). Complex 17 and other complexes having ligand 16 may also find use in applications requiring the adsorption of a luminescent label to an electrode (e.g., in luminescence-based sensors, ECL-based HPLC detectors or ECL displays using ECL<br><br>
labels adsorbed on electrodes or in films, such as Nafion films, deposited on an electrode).<br>
Example 20. A comparison of sandwich immunoassays on magnetic particles using antibodies labeled with complexes 20 and 2.<br>
AFP assays were carried out using the Elecsys AFP Assay (Roche Diagnostics) reagents except that the standard detection antibody was replaced with the same antibody but labeled with varying amounts of complexes 20 or 2. A sample (0.007 mL) containing a known concentration of AFP (0 or 1000 ng/mL) in a buffered solution containing blocking proteins was combined with 0.035 mL of the biotin-labeled capture antibody (0.0045 mg/mL) and 0.035 mL of the detection antibody (0.012 mg/mL). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes after which 0.035 mL of streptavidin-coated magnetic particles (0.72 mg/mL) and 0.139 mL of a buffered solution of tripropylamine (ORjGEN Assay Buffer, IGEN International) was added. The reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 15 minutes, after which the suspension was analyzed using an ORIGEN M-8 Instrument (IGEN International) and ECL detection. Figure 3 shows that label 2 gave sli^iiy less speci^c signal thzn label 20, but drastically less non-specific signal, especially for heavily labeled antibodies. The optimized S/B obtained using label 2 was more than two times the optimized S/B obtained with label 20.<br><br><br><br>
