A PROCESS -F0R-PREPARING 17? -SUBSTITUTED 4-AZA-ANDR0ST-1-EN-3-0NE COMPOUN<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  a  process  for  <br>
introducing a 1,2-double bond in 3-oxo-4-azasteroids by  <br>
dehydrogenating 3-oxo-4-azasteroids  saturated in the <br>
1,2-position,   in   particular   by   dehydrogenating<br>
17p-substituted  3-oxo-4-azasteroids  to  prepare  the <br>
corresponding 17p-substituted 3-oxo-4-azasteroids which<br>
have a double bond in the 1,2-position.	<br>
EP  0  155  096  discloses  the  preparation  of  17?-substituted   4-aza-5-alpha-androstanes    having    a 1,2-double  bond  by  oxidizing  the  corresponding 1,2-dihydro  compound  by  means  of  benzeneselenic anhydride.   Further  processes  for  introducing  a 1,2-double  bond  in  17p-substituted  4-aza-5~alpha-androstanes are,  for example,  also described in EP 0 298 652,  EP  0  428  366  and EP  0  473  225.  170-substituted  4-aza-5-alpha-androstanes  having  a  1,2-double bond are widely used pharmaceutically active compounds.  Of  significance  is,  for  example,  the compound 17p-(N-tert-butylcarbamoyl)-4-azaandrost-l-en-3-one (finasteride) which is used, for example, as a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor for the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia or of alopecia androgenitica. Also of significance is,  for example,  17?-{N-[2,5-bis(tri-fluoromethyl)phenyl]}-4-azaandrost-l-en-3-one (dutasteride). The known processes for preparing these compounds have specific'disadvantages, so that there is a need for improved alternative processes.<br>
The present invention relates to such an alternative preparation process.<br>
The present invention is defined in the claims. The present invention relates to a process for preparing 17p-substituted 4-azaandrost-l-en-3-one compounds of the general formula (I) :<br><br>

To introduce the trialkylsilyl protecting group, i.e. to silylate the NH group and/or the oxygen atom or the OH group [in step (A)], preference is given to using an (alkyl) 3Si (halogen) , e.g. (CH3) 3SiCl, or bistrimethyl-silyltrihaloacetamide, bistrimethylsilylacetamide, hexamethyldisilazane and/or bistrimethylurea, preferably bistrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide, or a trialkylsilyl trifluormethanesulfonate, preferably trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate. The reaction conditions for the silylation are known from EP 0 473 226.<br>
For the introduction of a protecting group where R3, together with R4, is the -C(O)-C(O)- or -C(0)-Y-C(0)-radical, the compound of the general formula (II) or the lactam moiety [in step (A)] is reacted with oxalyl chloride or malonyl chloride, of which oxalyl chloride is preferred. The reaction conditions for the reaction with oxalyl chloride are known from EP 0 428 366 and should be employed in an analogous manner  for the' reaction with malonyl chloride or analogously reacting compounds.<br>
For the introduction of a protecting group where R4 is alkyloxycarbonyl, e.g. tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), the procedure is known per se, and is to react the compound<br><br>
— 6 -<br>
of the general formula (II) , for example, with Boc anhydride (Boc-O-Boc) { [ (CH3) 3C-O-C (0) ] 2-0} or with Boc carbamate [ (CH3) 3C-0-C (0) -N (C1-4-alkyl) 2] . Here, Boc represents the other compounds reacting in the same way, i.e. compounds in which the tert-butyl radical has been replaced by another radical of the same reactivity, for example the tert-amyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl radicals mentioned. Such analogous reactions are described numerously in the technical literature. When R3 is trialkylsilyl and R4 is Boc, the Boc protecting group is first introduced and silylation is effected afterward.<br>
In step (B) , the compound obtained in step (A) is reacted in the presence (i) of a dehydrogenation catalyst and in the presence of (ii) optionally substituted benzoquinone, allyl methyl carbonate, allyl ethyl carbonate and/or allyl propyl carbonate, and the A1 double bond is introduced in the l-/2-position. The dehydrogenation catalyst is preferably selected from compounds (salts and complexes) of the group of the transition metals of the Periodic Table of the Elements, in particular selected from compounds of the metals of group VIII of the Periodic Table, in particular of iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru) and osmium (Os); cobalt (Co), rhodium <rh and iridium nickel palladium platinum group ib i.e. of copper silver gold preference is given to compounds the metals viii periodic table. in particular or dehydrogenation catalysts based on rhodium compounds. examples such are: pd as tris complex pdcl2 bis></rh><br>
-7-<br>
Pd (dppe) (OAc) 2, 7r-allyl-Pd complexes, preferably ?-allyl-Pd chloride dimer. Preference is given to Pd(0) compounds, in particular tris(dibenzylideneacetone)di-palladium-chloroform complex. These compounds, or salts and complexes, are known per se and have been described in the literature.<br>
For the thermal stabilization of the palladium complex, an additional complexing agent such as 2,2'-dipyridyf or 1,10-phenanthroline may be used, preferably 2,2'-di-pyridyl.<br>
By way of explanation, it can be stated on the mechanism of catalysis that a Pd species adds at the carbon atom in the 2-position with elimination of the oxygen protecting group [for example of the -Si(CH3)3 group]. A subsequent beta-hydrogen elimination at the carbon atom in the 1-position leads to the desired A1 double bond in the l-/2-position, and releases a further palladium species which is returned into the catalytic cycle. Indications for this reaction mechanism can be found in Tetrahedron Letters, page 4783 (1984). However, the present invention is not bound to this explanation.<br>
The quinone used may also be a substituted quinone, for example a C1-4-alkyl-, halogen-, cyano or nitro-substituted quinone. Such quinones are known per se.<br>
In step (C) , the resulting compound is then converted to the compound of the formula (I) by removing the protecting groups introduced. This is effected preferably by treating with a suitable acid, for example with formic acid, acetic acid and/or trifluoro-acetic acid, preferably with formic acid. Subsequently, the resulting compound may optionally be converted in a manner known per se to a pharmaceutically usable salt (where R = hydroxyl).<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
Preference is given to recrystaliizing the resulting compound. This recrystallization may be carried out in apolar solvents such as benzine, heptane, hexane and toluene, preferably toluene. The compound of the formula (I) is in particular the compound mentioned at the outset, 17?- (N-tert-butylcarbamoyl) -4-azaandrost-l-en-3-one (finasteride), which occurs in two polymorphic forms, specifically polymorphic form 1 and polymorphic form II, preference being given to form I. Form I is formed, for example, in the recrystallization of crude finasteride obtained in accordance with the invention from a saturated solution of toluene (about one part of crude finasteride in about six parts of toluene) on cooling to about 25°C. The polymorphic form II is formed, for example, in the recrystallization of crude finasteride obtained in accordance with the invention from a solution of toluene (about one part of crude finasteride in about six parts of toluene) on cooling to about 0°C.<br>
The properties of 17?-{N-[2,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]}-4-azaandrost-l-en-3-one (dutasteride) are known from the literature.<br>
For the process described with the steps (A) - (C) , the solvents used may be numerous organic anhydrous compounds, for example toluene, benzine, hexane, heptane, tert-butyl alcohol, diethyl ether, acetone, benzene, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, dimethylformamide or pyridine. The examples which follow illustrate the invention.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
Example 1 (Substitution of dihydrofinasteride with Boc on the nitrogen atom of the 3-keto-4-aza moiety)<br>
10 g (26.7 mmol) of dihydrofinasteride are initially charged in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and cooled to -78°C. 15 ml (30 mmol) of lithium diisopropylamide solution (LDA solution) are metered into the resulting suspension and the clear solution is stirred for approx. 30 minutes. A solution of 6.7 g (30 mmol) of Boc anhydride in THF is then metered in. The solution is now allowed to warm to room temperature (RT) . After the customary workup, a damp yellow powder is obtained which is stored in a drying cabinet overnight and used directly in example 2.<br>
Example  2  (Silylation  of  the  compound prepared  in example 1)<br>
1 g (2.1 mmol) of 4-Boc-dihydrofinasteride is dissolved in THF. 2 - 3 ml (4.6 mmol) of LDA solution are added under methanol-ice cooling to the clear yellow solution. The suspension is stirred for about 45 minutes, after which 0.46 g (4.2 mmol) of trimethyl-chlorosilane (TMSC1) is added dropwise at 18-20°C. The clear solution is concentrated and the residue taken up in heptane. After the filtration, the filtrate is concentrated as far as possible, and the resulting honey-brown oil is used in the following stage (example 3 and example 5) .<br>
Example 3 (Introduction of the A1 double bond to 4-benzyloxycarbonyIfinasteride)<br>
0.145 g (0.65 mmol) of palladium acetate is dissolved and initially charged with 0.07 g (0.65 mmol) of benzo-quinone in acetonitrile. 0.8 g (1.5 mmol) of the silyl compound prepared in example 3 'is taken up in acetonitrile and added dropwise at an internal temperature<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
(IT) of 20-25°C. The' reaction mixture is stirred for 8 hours and purified using silica gel. The weakly-colored clear solution is concentrated at ET 55-60°C. The resulting solid substance is used in example 4.<br>
Example 4 (Removal of the protecting groups and crystallization)<br>
a)	0.5 g of the solid substance from example 3 is<br>
admixed with 20 g (0.175 mol) of trifluoroacetic acid<br>
and heated at reflux for about 15 hours. The trifluoro<br>
acetic acid is used as a reagent and as a solvent.<br>
After being cooled, the reaction mixture is poured onto<br>
a mixture of 300 g of saturated sodium bicarbonate<br>
solution and 50 g of ice and extracted with 20 g of<br>
ethyl acetate.<br>
b)	The brown crude product obtained in the preceding<br>
section a)  is dissolved in toluene at 90°C (toluene:<br>
crude material ratio = 6:1), and cooled to 20-25°C. The<br>
precipitated, gray-white substance is filtered off at<br>
20-25°C and dried. Finasteride polymorph I is obtained.<br>
Example 5 (Introduction of the A1 double bond to 4-benzyloxycarbonyl finasteride)<br>
2.0 g (3.7 mmol) of the compound from example 2 are admixed with 1.29 g (11.1 mmol) of allyl methyl carbonate in acetonitrile. The mixture is added dropwise to a solution, at 60-70°C, of 166 mg (0.74 mmol) of palladium(II) acetate in acetonitrile. After 1-2 hours at reflux, the mixture is worked up as described in example 3. 3 g of solid substance are obtained.<br>
Example 6 (Introduction of the A1 double bond)<br>
A)   20 g  (0.047 mol)  of  the  oxalyl  enol  ether  of<br><br>
-11-<br>
dihydrofinasteride [compound IIIa where R = -NH-tert-butyl, R3 and R4 = -C (0) -C (0) -] are heated to reflux temperature together with 16.3 g (0.140 mol) of allyl methyl carbonate and 76 g of anhydrous acetonitrile. 5 portions of a mixture of in each case 18 g of xylene and in each case 0.049 g of tris(dibenzylidineacetone)-dipalladium-chloroform complex (total molar amount of catalyst: 0.284 mmol) are added in succession. Each time, considerable gas evolution is visible when the addition is made. After refluxing for 12 h, the reaction is completed by adding two portions of a hot mixture of in each case 3 g of xylene and in each case 0.024 g of dehydrogenation catalyst (mixture heated slowly) (if necessary, further portions are added thereto). After the filtration, the reaction mixture is concentrated as far as possible, then 24.5 g of a yellow, honeylike material remain.<br>
B) The honeylike material is taken up in 105 g of methanol and cooled to 0-5°C. 11.3 g (0.0403 mol) of 25% potassium methoxide solution are metered in slowly and the mixture is stirred at 0-5°C internal temperature for approx. 1 hour. 20 g of water are then metered in and the cooling bath is removed; the internal temperature rises to 15-20°C. The mixture is concentrated to dryness, and 50 g of water, 90 g of toluene and 12 g of methanol are added to the solid residue which is heated to reflux temperature for 1 hour. After the stirrer has been switched off, the organic phase and water phase separate without any problem; the organic phase is removed while hot. The cooling to 25°C within 2-4 hours brings the finasteride to crystallization in the polymorphic form I. After the drying, 8.1 g of white powder are obtained.<br>
Example 7<br>
The procedure is analogous to the processes described<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
in examples 1 to 6 when the A1 double bond is introduced into dihydrodutasteride, i.e. into a corresponding dihydro compound of the formula (I) where R is an -NHR1 radical, and R1 is 2,5-bis{trifluoro-methyDphenyl, to obtain dutasteride by the introduction of the ?1 double bond.<br>
Example 8 (Preparation of methyl 3-oxo-4-aza-5?-androst-l-ene-17?-carboxylate)<br>
Stage 1 {Preparation of the compound IIIb, i.e. a compound of the formula (III) where R = -OMe, R3 and R4 = -C(O)-C(O)-) :<br>
2 g (0.005 mol, content &gt; 95%) of methyl 3-oxo-4-aza-5a-androst-l-ene-17p-carboxylate are admixed with 30 g of toluene and 2.6 g (0.019 mol) of oxalyl chloride are added slowly with cooling. Gradually, constant gas evolution sets in. The cloudy mixture is stirred overnight. From the clear reaction solution, excess oxalyl chloride and toluene are removed distillatively at room temperature under reduced pressure down to half of the original volume. As this is done, a white solid precipitates out which is filtered and washed intensively three times with 15 g each time of heptane. After the suction to dryness, 1.6 g of crude methyl ester remain. This is taken up in approx. 20 g of dichloromethane, the cloudy solution is washed intensively with 33 g of 5% potassium bicarbonate solution, the mixture is filtered and the organic phase is washed three times with 10 g each time of water. The clear, colorless organic phase is concentrated as far as possible and 0.9 g of the compound IIIb is obtained. 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3, 5): 4.95 (1H, t); 3.68 (3H, s) ; 3.62-3.5 (1H, m) ; 3.22-3.06 (1H, m) ; 2.41-0.80 (17H, m) ; 0-97 (3H, s); 0.68 (3H, s)<br>
