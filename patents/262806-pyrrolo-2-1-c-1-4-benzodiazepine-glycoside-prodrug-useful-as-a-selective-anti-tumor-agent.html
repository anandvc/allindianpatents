Particularly, the present invention relates to (11S)-10-(4-p -D-galactopyranosyloxy-3-nitrophenyl) methoxy carbonyl-11 -hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,2,3,-10,11,11 a-hexahydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,1 -c][1,4]-benzodiazepin-5-one] and 1,1'- [[(propane-1,3-diyl)dioxy]-bis(11S,11aS)-10-(4-p-D-galactopyranosyloxy-3-nitrophenyl)methoxycarbonyl-11-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,2,3,-10,11,11 a-hexahydro-5/-/-pyrrolo[2,1 -c][1,4]-benzodiazepin-5-one].The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4] benzodiazepine (PBD-glycoside) prodrug useful as a selective an anti tumor agent for cancer therapy. The present invention also relates to a process of activation of the PBD-glycoside prodrugs to drugs by the enzyme p-galactosidase. The structural formula of novel PBD-gylcoside prodrugs is as follows,<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prodrugs are modified form of drugs, which on activation form drugs. Recently some prodrugs of PBDs have been reported which do not get activated by the enzyme p-galactosidase (Marina J. Sagnou, Philip W. Howard, Stephen J. Gregson, Ebun Eno-Amooquaye, Philip J. Burke, David E. Thurston, Bioorg Med Chem. Lett. 2000, 10, 2083-2086; Jane M. Berry, Philip W. Howard, Lloyd R. Kelland, David E.<br>
Thurston, Bioorg Med Chem. Lett. 2002, 12, 1413-1416; Luke A. Masterson, Victoria J. Spanswick, John A. Hartley, Richard H. Begent, Philip W. Howard, David E Thurston, Bioorg.Med. Chem. Lett. 2006, 16, 252-256).<br>
Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine antitumour antibiotics are commonly known as anthramycin class of compounds. In the last few years, a growing interest has been shown in the development of new pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs). These PBDs are a family of sequence selective DNA-binding antitumour antibiotics that bind exclusively to the exocyclic N2-guanine in the minor groove of DMA via an acid-labile aminal bond to the electrophilic imine at the N10-C11 position. (Kunimoto, S.; Masuda, T.; Kanbayashi, N.; Hamada, M.; Naganawa, H.; Miyamoto, M.; Takeuchi, T ; Unezawa, H. J. Antibiot, 1980, 33, 665.; Kohn, K. W.; Speous, C. L. J. Mol. Biol., 1970, 51, 551.; Hurley, L. H. Gairpla, C.; Zmijewski, M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 1977, 475, 521.; Kaplan, D. J.; Hurley, L. H. Biochemistry, 1981, 20, 7572.; Ahmed Kamal, G. Ramesh, N. Laxman, P. Ramulu, 0. Srinivas, K. Neelima, Anand K. Kondapi, V. B. Sreenu, H. A. Nagarajaram. J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 4679-4688)<br>
All biologically active PBDs possess the (S) configuration at the chiral C11a position, which provides the molecule with a right-handed twist, which allows them to follow the curvature of the minor groove of B-form double-stranded DMA spanning three base pairs The PBDs are of considerable current interest due to their ability to recognize and subsequently form covalent bonds to specific base sequences of double-stranded DMA. Naturally occurring pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines belong to a group of antitumour antibiotics derived from Streptomyces species with family members including anthramycin, tomaymycin, sibiromycin, chicamycin, neothramycins A and B, and DC-81.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
However, the clinical efficacy for these antibiotics is hindered by several limitations, such as poor water solubility and cardiotoxicity and development of drug resistance, lack of tumour selectivity, metabolic inactivation. Therefore it is of considerable interest to design and prepare glycoside prodrugs of PBDs that could be activated by the enzyme ß-galactosidase. This enzyme is found in some tissues like liver specifically or it can be delivered as an enzyme-antibody conjugate to the malignant cells. It is expected that these prodrugs get activated by the enzyme to the active moiety, and then interact with DNA.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine prodrug with increased water solubility useful as selective antitumour agent.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine prodrug, which could be activated to drugs in the presence of the enzyme p-galactosidase.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-glycoside prodrug useful as antitumour agent for selective therapy of cancer.<br>

Mechanism of activation of the prodrug 1b to 6b<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
The prodrug 1a 1 µmole was treated with 2 units of E. coli Dgalactosidase enzyme and the progress of the hydrolysis was monitored by reverse phase HPLC. The results are presented in the form of a graph.<br>

HPLC conditions: C18 Reverse phase column. Mobile phase 40:60 CH3CN/ H2O, flow rate of 1 ml/min UV detection: wave length 254 nm.<br>
BIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF THE PRODRUGS<br>
The cytotoxic effects of the newly synthesized compounds 1a and 1b and their respective PBD imines were examined by cell cycle progression experiments on human tumor cells, by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, in the absence and in the presence of ß-galactosidase enzyme. In the primary flow cytometric study, the DMA content of the cells was used as a major determinant for cell count. The subG1 population, a conspicuous indicator for cell death, presumably apoptosis, and G2/M population was also determined in HepG2 and A375 cell lines.<br>
The cytometric assay of A375 cells treated with both the prodrugs 1a and 1b along with E. coli ß-galactosidase, not only resulted in apoptosis identical to that of the parent drugs 6a and 6b respectively, but also the amount of cell death was<br>
insignificant in the absence of the enzyme, indicating the prodrugs to be nontoxic even at such a high concentration (1a 42µM and 1b 23.4µM).<br>
Next we evaluated the prodrugs for their activation efficiency by intracellular (3-galactosidase, in human liver cancer, HepG2 cells. The cytometric assay of HepG2 cells with the prodrug 1a in the presence and in the absence of E. coli (3-galactosidase enzyme was found to show an apoptotic response comparable to that of the parent drug 6a. Prodrug 1b in HepG2 cell line in the presence of E. coli (3-galactosidase showed a profile comparable to that of the parent drug 6b.The prodrug with out the enzyme produced a block in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, a characteristic of cross-linking drugs.<br>
Picture representing the histogram overlay of HepG2 cells treated with compounds 1a, 6a and 1a+ E.coli l -galactosidase enzyme. It can be observed that the effect of the prodrug without any added enzyme is similar to that of the active molecule, benzylated ether of DC-81. The profile of the prodrug with E.coli enzyme added is also compare is also comparable to that of the DC-81.<br>

The PBD glycoside prodrugs 1a and 1b are found to be useful for selective therapy of cancer especially solid tumours, with minimal toxic effect on the normal tissues.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
