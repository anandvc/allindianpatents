				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a composition useful as fumigant against stored grain insect-pests.<br>
The formulation of the present invention has narcotic (fumigant) action against stored grain insects, Callosobruchus maculatus and Tribolium castaneum. The property is attributed to the synergistic combination of pure natural compound 1,8-cineol and other compounds isolated from essential oil bearing plants.<br>
Food commodities are considered to be first basic human need which are significantly damaged by insects during preharvest, post harvest and storage conditions, thereby making both qualitative and quantitative losses. Various stored commodities like rice, maize, wheat, legume, soyabean etc. contribute more than two third of the carbohydrate, half of protein, half of fiber and a quarter of the oil and fat requirements of everyday life (Evan, 1975, Crop Physiology, Cambridge). But these stored commodities when infested by insects, make a significant loss and degradation of food quality. Such infested grains with insects become totally unfit for human consumption.<br>
Hitherto known insecticides for control of stored grain insects are malathion, aluminium phosphide, methyl bromide and ethyl dibromide etc. They are totally synthetic   and    hazardous   in one way or other. The use of these present day<br><br>
synthetic insecticide under storage conditions are highly unsafe due to increasing resistance, bioconcentration and residual problems.<br>
Introduction of synthetic pyrethroids clearly demonstrates the potential of this approach in terms of scientific and economic rewards (M. Elliot, ACS Series, 42, 1977). Apart from this, production of new chemicals has been declining in recent years and currently fewer than two insecticides are being introduction each year (Ware, Pesticides Theory and Application, San Fransico, 1983).<br>
Under the circumstances, replacement of "Conventional" insecticides with indigenous and environmentally friendly chemicals has the potential to provide adequate financial return and decreasing the environmental impact of synthetic chemicals apart from making substantial contribution towards increased global food production.<br>
During the course of our research,  in an attempt  for preparing  insecticides from natural products,we have  found that  a natural essential oil constituent 1,8-cineol  can  be employed for controlling or killing the stored grain  insect pulse beetle and other beetles.<br>
The technical ingredient used in the present invention, 1,8-cineole  occurrs in more than 260 essential oils  (Ganapathi, Current  Science, 1937, 6:19). It is a colourless  optically<br><br>
active liquid possessing a camphoraceous odour with a spicy cooling taste. It is used to combat flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs and chiggers etc. (Jacobson and Haller,1947,â€¢ Maugh.1982). It has antiseptic and expectorant activity and is used in many oily nose and throat sprays. 1,8-cineole can be prepared synthetically by the dehydration of terpene hydrate.<br>
It is also used widely in pharmaceutical preparations, applied internally or locally. Furthermore, it is used in room sprays, lotions and in all kinds of cosmetic preparations etc.<br>
The main objective of  the present  invention  is  to provide a formulation useful as fumigant against stored grain  insect-pests which obviates  the drawbacks as detai1ed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a composition of the essential oil constituents as a formulation which is useful as protectant for the control of stored grain insects; which is safe, cheap, biodegradable, environmentally friendly, without any residual effect and commercially viable.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a composition  of   the volatile  oil  constituents  as  a formulation which  is useful as stored grain protectant;<br><br>
which also take care of microbes, hot-spots produced in grains as a result of insect infestation during storage conditions due to its known fungal properties.<br>
The basis by which the invention has been developed is due to our finding that when 1,8-cineole isolated from essential oil bearing plants is mixed with one or more other natural essential oil constituents; the resultant composition develops insecticidal property which is especially active against stored grain insects. Accordingly, the composition is useful as fumigant for control of stored grain insects.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a synergistic coi\mposition useful as fumigant against stored grain insect-pests which comprises mixing by conventional manner such as herein described 0.02 to 1.5% (wt) of 1, 8 cineole obtained from the plant Eucalyptus globulus and 0.02 to 2.0% (wt) of one or more constituents of essential oil obtained from plant species such as Ocimum basilicum, Mentha spp., Cymbopogon spp., Anethum graveolens, Zingiber officinale, Pelargonium graveolens, Cinnamomum spp., Eugenia spp., and Hyptis sp., wherein preferred ratio of said constituents ranges from 1:1:1 to 4:5:3.<br>
The volatile oil constituents used may be 1,8-cineole, linalool, menthol,<br>
carvone, methyl chavicol, anethole, citronellol, limonoids, curcumene and<br>
citral from plant genera Eucalyptus globulus, Ocimum basilicum, Mentha<br>
spp.,	Cymbopogon spp.,     Anethum     graveolens,    Coriandrum sativum,<br>
Foeniculum   vulgare,    Zingibe-   officinale    and     Pelargonium      graveolens.<br><br>
In the present invention a formulation useful as an fumigant against, stored grain insect-pests comprises blending  the essential  oil constituent  1.8-cineol extracted from the plant of the genus Eucalypts globulus with one or more essential natural  oil constituent(s).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, has several components which include sustained release of aroma from the prepared composition of aromatic constituents to be effective as respiratory poision in killing certain stored grain insects like pulse beetle and red flour beetle attacking chickpea and wheat respectively; shooting down effect and rate of absorption in grains is very slow; shooting down effect ' in terms of exposure period under space trial test; safety in handling and minimised risk to human health. The present invention thereby provides for the preparation of a herbal fumigant which when used in stored grains kept in airtight storage conditions provide complete protection from insect-pest damage. The response is the result of aromatic properties of the product enabling respiratory arrest in target insects.<br>
The preferred composition of the present invention consists of  pure volatile oil constituent 1,8-cineole , linalool  and methyl  chavicol isolated from plants. The amount of these components may range from 1:1:1 to 4:5:3.<br><br>
The invention is illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed to limit the sope of the present invention.<br>

EXAMPLE - 11<br>
This examples relates to the effect of a known insecticide so as  to compare the results with that of the  composition  of<br><br>
the present invention. Aluminium phosphide is a synthetic fumigant commercially available in the form of tablet or powder in the market under the trade name Fumino bags or Celphos tablets. One tablet was kept at the bottom of an empty pearl pet jar (1.0 lit.) and considered as one replication.<br>
Fifty insects of pulse beetle were released and mouth of the jar was covered by its lid airtightly. The time required to kill 99.0 per cent pulse beetles in the jar was recorded and considered as exposure period to kill 99.00 per cent insects at a fixed dosage and volume. Five replications were used for the observation of shooting down effect for a total of 250 insects. Same procedure was followed for red flour beetle using wheat seeds.<br>
It was observed that one tablet required 65 minutes to kill 99.0  per cent of both the insects  at  a fixed dosage  and volume as stated above.<br>
The summary of results of above examples (1-11) are given  in Table - 1.<br><br>
Table 1: Effect of pure essential oil constituents or their mixtures as fumigant against two stored grain insects, pulse beetle and red flour beetle.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
It  is observed from the above table that the compound  1,8-cineol  when mixed with other compounds linalool and methyl chavicol   into  stored grain  protectant  formulation  at varying degree of ratio, resulted into varying degree of shooting down effect.<br>
Accordingly  it can be observed that the composition of  the present  invention  is  not  a mere  admixture having  the aggregate  properties of  all  the  ingredients  but   is a synergistic mixture resulting in  enhanced property with sustained effect.<br>
EXAMPLE - 12<br>

Chickpea seeds (50 gm) were taken in a beaker and 1 ml. of the composition having ingredients 1,8-cineole (6.0 ml.), linalool  (4.0 ml) and methyl chavicol (2.0 ml.)<br><br>
(ratio of 3,2-1) was mixed and stirred for 10 minutes and kept under room conditions to get dried. Thus treated seeds were sown in earthen pots. Five replications were used with 50 gm seeds per replication. Germination of the seeds was recorded for 7 days. Same procedure was followed for wheat seeds.<br>

EXAMPLE - 17<br>
This example relates to the phytotoxic effect of a known insecticide so as to compare the results with that of the composition of the present invention. Aluminium phosphide is a synthetic fumigant commercially available in the form of tablets. One tablet of Celphos was kept in a one litre capacity pearl pet jar. Fifty gram of chickpea seed was placed in it and mouth of the jar was covered with its lid. After one hour, seeds were taken out and kept at room temperature for 24 hours. After that treated gram seeds were sown in earthen pots. Five replication were used with 50 gm. seed per replication. Same procedure was followed in case of wheat seeds.<br>
Germination  of the seed was recorded after 7  days. Experimental data revealed 100.00 percent germination of the treated seeds. Summary of the above example (12-17) is given in table - 2.<br><br>
Tattle 8   Effect of pure essential oil constituent in<br>
combination product on the germination of chickpea and wheat seeds.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table-2 clearly indicates that preparation of this invention has no phytotoxic effect in terms of germination of chickpea and wheat seeds.<br>
The advantage of present invention is that being plant based formulation, it is eco-friendly, non-toxic, non-corrosive and non-phytotoxic apart from sustained and shooting down effect and safe in use.<br><br><br><br><br>
