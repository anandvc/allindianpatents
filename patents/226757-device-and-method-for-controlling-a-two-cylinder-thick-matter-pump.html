				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns a device and a process for controlling a<br>
two cylinder thick matter pump with two conveyor cylinders<br>
communicating via end openings in a material supply container<br>
operable in counter stroke fay means of a hydraulic reversible<br>
pump and via hydraulic drive cylinders controlled by the pump,<br>
with a hydraulic actuated pipe switch provided within the<br>
material supply container, of which the inlet side is<br>
alternatingly connectible to one of the openings of the conveyor<br>
cylinders leaving open the respective other opening and on the<br>
outlet side is connected with a conveyor line, wherein at each<br>
conveyor stroke the passing-by of the piston is detected at at<br>
least two sensor positions spaced a predetermined distance from<br>
each other and from the rod and/or bottom side end of the drive<br>
cylinder) and upon ending of the conveyor stroke initiates a<br>
switching process of the reversible pump and the pipe switch,<br>
wherein respectively upon conclusion of the one advance stroke a<br>
reversal process of the pipe switch is initiated, wherein further<br>
the drive cylinders, forming a closed hydraulic circuit, are<br>
hydraulically connected with respectively one connection at one<br>
of their ends to the reversible pump and to each other via an<br><br>
oscillating hydraulic line at their other end. and wherein<br>
hydraulic pressure branched or tapped out of the hydraulic lines<br>
leading from the reversible pump to the drive cylinders is used<br>
for reversing the pipe switch.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A device for control of a two cylinder thick matter pump of this<br>
type is known (DE 195 42 258), in which the end position of the<br>
piston of the drive cylinder can be determined by means of<br>
cylinder switch sensors for producing emd position signals. The<br>
flow-through reversal of the reversible pumps is there initiated<br>
by the end position signal of the drive cylinder. As a rule the<br>
end position signal is conventionally triggered via the two<br>
cylinder switch sensors located at the rod end of the cylinder.<br>
It often happens that the cylinder switch sensors fail. In such a<br>
case it is necessary to switch to manual operation or to turn off<br>
the machine.<br>
Beginning therwith it is the task of the present invention to<br>
develop a device and a process, with which, even in the case of<br>
failure of the hitherto conventional cylinder switch sensors a<br>
reliable pump operation can be ensured with continuous flow of<br>
concrete.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventive solution is based primarily upon the recognition,<br>
that in consulting a computer control, supplemental operating<br>
data can be derived from the hydraulic circuit for control of the<br>
reversible pump and the pipe switch.<br>
A first variation of the solution envisions that the reversing<br>
device includes a computer assisted device for determining the<br>
predicted stroke duration and for the registration thereof in a<br>
memory device as well as for monitoring the time during each<br>
piston stroke and for initiating a pipe switch control and a<br>
reversal of the flow in the reversible pump according to the<br>
measure of the defined stroke time, with comparison to an<br>
anticipated elapsed stroke duration. Preferably the reversal<br>
device therein exhibits a time monitoring routine, which<br><br>
includes an algorithm for determining a comparison value from<br>
actual stroke time and predicted stroke duration and to their<br>
conversion, upon exceeding a predetermined value, into a<br>
reversal signal for the pipe switch and/or the reversible pump.<br>
One advantageous embodiment of the invention envisions therein<br>
that the reversing device includes an input routine for<br>
recording in memory the stroke duration measured during a<br>
calibration of the concrete pump with at least one specific<br>
defined conveyance amount. Since the conveyed amount can be<br>
varied in computer-controlled concrete pumps, for example via a<br>
remote control device, it is of particular advantage when the<br>
reversing device includes a computer routine for variably<br>
converting the registered stroke duration based upon the<br>
conveyance amount input from the remote control device.<br>
According to a preferred or alternative embodiment of the<br>
invention a sensor is provided for monitoring the hydraulic<br>
pressure on the hydraulic pressure side of the reversible pump,<br>
which output signal can be evaluated by a pressure monitoring<br>
routine of the reversing device for initiating a pipe switch<br>
reversal and flow-through reversal of the reversible pump. For<br>
this purpose an average pump pressure can be determined and<br>
stored in memory during each pressure stroke.	The pressure<br>
monitoring routine then provides an algorithm for determining<br>
the pressure increase occurring at the end of each pressure<br>
stroke in the concerned drive cylinder relative to the average<br>
pressure value and for the translation thereof into a reversal<br>
signal for the pipe switch and/or reversible pump.<br>
If one cylinder switch sensor responsive to the pistons as they<br>
pass by is provided respectively spaced apart from the rod end<br>
and bottom end of the drive cylinders, then the reversing device<br><br>
can, besides this, include a path monitoring routine responsive<br>
to the output signal of the selected cylinder switch sensor for<br>
initiating the pipe switch reversal and/or flow-through reversal<br>
of the reversible pump. The reversal device can in this case<br>
supplementally include a measurement routine for determining the<br>
stroke duration from the initiation signals of the cylinder<br>
switch sensors and to their recordation. The stroke durations<br>
recorded in a memory in this manner can, in emergency cases, be<br>
employed for controlling the time of the flow-through reversal.<br>
One preferred embodiment of the invention envisions that on the<br>
path monitoring routine corresponding to the selected cylinder<br>
switch sensors, the pressure monitoring routine responsive to<br>
the pressure measurement values, and the time monitoring routine<br>
responsive to the stroke time, can form a, preferably<br>
hierarchical structured, redundant program sequence for<br>
controlling the pipe switch and/or reversible pump.<br>
The inventive control, in normal operation, switches the<br>
reversible pump upon reaching the base side cylinder switch and<br>
insures therewith a continuous flow of concrete. At the same<br>
time, during operation the respective stroke duration is<br>
calculated and the average high pressure at the pressure outlet<br>
of the reversible pump is determined and stored in the data<br>
storage.<br>
In the case that at least one of the rod side cylinder switch<br>
sensors fails, the control for the further operation of the pump<br>
can automatically be switched to one of the base side cylinder<br>
switch sensors. The rod side cylinder switch sensors are on the<br>
one hand given priority. During operation however the rod and<br>
the base side cylinder sensors are monitored, and can be<br><br>
activated independently of each other for the above mentioned<br>
measuring processes.<br>
In the case that three or all four cylinder switch sensors fail,<br>
it is possible with the inventive supplemental measures to<br>
monitor the stroke time from the last reversal process and to<br>
compare this with the registered stroke duration. The expected<br>
stroke duration can be calculated from the conveyed amount, the<br>
RPM and the viscosity of the conveyed material. If the stroke<br>
time has approximately elapsed, then the high pressure at the<br>
pump output is compared with the average stored high pressure of<br>
the actual stroke. In the case of an increase of the pressure<br>
beyond the predetermined threshold, in this case an override<br>
reversal can be initiated.<br>
In so far as the measured stroke time exceeds the registered<br>
stroke time and during this time no increase in pressure was<br>
determined, a forced or override reversal can occur on the basis<br>
of the time measurement alone. Therewith it is ensured that<br>
also in the case of a loss of a pressure sensor an automatic<br>
further operation of the concrete pump can continue.<br>
For simplification of the pump control the present described<br>
measures can also be employed individually for switching over<br>
the pipe switch and the reversible pump.<br>
In the following the invention will be described in greater<br>
detail on the basis of the illustrative embodiment shown in<br>
schematic manner in the accompanying figures. There is shown<br>
Fig. 1	A section of a two cylinder thick matter pump in<br>
partial sectional perspective representation;<br><br>
Fig. 2	A circuit diagram of a computer assisted drive<br>
hydraulic for a two cylinder thick matter pump;<br>
Fig. 3	A flow diagram of a redundant program sequence for the<br>
pump control.<br>
The control arrangement shown in Fig. 2 is intended for a thick<br>
matter pump according to Fig. 1, which includes two conveyor<br>
cylinders 50, 50' of which the end openings 52 communicate in a<br>
material supply container 54 and alternatingly during the<br>
pressure stroke can be connected with a conveyor line 58 via a<br>
pipe switch 56. The conveyor cylinders 50, 50' are operated in<br>
counter-stroke via hydraulic drive cylinders 5, 5' and a<br>
reversing hydraulic pump 6.	For this purpose the conveyor<br>
pistons 60, 60' of the conveyor cylinder 50, 50' are connected<br>
with a piston 8, 8' of the drive cylinder 5, 5' via a common<br>
piston rod 9, 9'.<br>
In the shown illustrative embodiment the drive cylinders 5, 5'<br>
are acted upon with hydraulic pressure on their base side via<br>
hydraulic lines 11, 11' of the hydraulic circulation with the<br>
aid of the reversible pump 6 and are on their rod side end<br>
connected hydraulically with each other via an oscillating oil<br>
line 12. The direction of movement of the drive pistons 8, 8'<br>
and therewith the common piston rods 9, 9' are reversed when the<br>
flow-through direction of the reversible pump 6 is reversed via<br>
a reversing device 18 comprising a computer 14 and a switch<br>
mechanism 16. The reversible pump 6 has, for this purpose, a<br>
slant disk 62, which for reversing is pivoted through its zero<br>
position, so that the oil pressure in the hydraulic lines 11,<br>
11' is reversed. The amount conveyed via the reversible pump 6<br><br>
can be varied, while keeping constant a predetermined rotational<br>
speed of a not shown drive motor, by changing the pivot angle of<br>
the slant disk 62. The pivot angle of the slant disk 62 can<br>
therein be adjusted via a remote control device 64 with support<br>
of a computer 14.<br>
The reversing of the reversible pump and the pipe switch 56<br>
occurs as soon as the piston 8, 8' of the drive cylinders 5, 5'<br>
reach their end position.	The reversing control device 18<br>
exhibits for this purpose multiple redundant control routines,<br>
which are integrated with each other to form a hierarchical<br>
structured program sequence (See Fig. 3).<br>
The reversing device evaluates output signals of the respective<br>
cylinder sensors 20, 22 and 20' , 22', located respectively a<br>
distance from the rod side and base side ends of the two drive<br>
cylinders 5' , 5' , which on the output side are connected with<br>
the computer 14 of the control device 18. The cylinder switch<br>
sensors react to the drive pistons 8, 8' passing by during<br>
operation of the pump, and signal this occurrence to the<br>
computer input 66, 68. Upon occurrence of the output signals a<br>
reverse signal 76 is initiated in the reversing device, which<br>
reverses the reversible pump 6 via the actuating mechanism 16.<br>
In the course of the reverse process there is initiated, besides<br>
this, a switching of the pipe switch 56 via the directional<br>
valve and the plunger cylinder 72, 72' . In normal operation it<br>
is primarily the signals of the rod side cylinder switch sensors<br>
20, 20' which are employed for producing a reverse signal. For<br>
this, the computer 14 includes a path monitoring routine 40, in<br>
which the output signal of the rod side cylinder switch sensors<br>
20, 20' are evaluated with formation of a switching or reversing<br>
signal 76 for the reversible pump 6 and/or the pipe switch 56.<br><br>
In the case that at least one of the rod side cylinders switch<br>
sensors 20, 20' fails, at least one of the base side cylinder<br>
switch sensors 22, 22' is activated in the place of the failed<br>
sensor for forming the reverse signal 76 via the monitoring<br>
routine 40.<br>
The switching or reversing device 18 further includes a pressure<br>
sensor 24, which is connected on the high pressure side 78 of<br>
the reversible pump 6 and of which the output signal is<br>
evaluated in the computer 14 with the aid of a pressure<br>
monitoring routine 80.	The pressure monitoring routine 80<br>
determines in the course of a stroke displacement an average<br>
high pressure and includes an algorithm for determining a<br>
pressure increase occurring at the end of each conveyance stroke<br>
and for the conversion thereof into a reverse signal 76' for the<br>
reversible pump 6 and/or the pipe switch 56. This reversing<br>
signal is preferably used for reversing in the case of a failure<br>
of the cylinder switch sensors 20, 20'; 22, 22'.<br>
Further, in the case of the calibration of the concrete pump, a<br>
stroke duration can be determined depending upon the conveyed<br>
amount and drive RPM of the reversible pump 6, and this<br>
information be recorded in the memory or data storage of the<br>
computer 14.	Also, during the pump operation the stroke<br>
duration can be measured and recorded via the rod side and base<br>
side cylinder switch sensors 20, 20'; 22, 22' depending upon the<br>
input amount to be conveyed and the motor RPM. If, in addition<br>
thereto, after each reversal process the stroke time is<br>
monitored and compared with the recorded stroke duration, a<br>
reverse signal 76" for the reversible pump 6 and/or the pipe<br>
switch 56 can be derived therefrom, via a stroke monitoring<br>
routine 82 of the computer 14.	The comparison routine 82<br><br>
preferably includes an algorithm, which also makes possible a<br>
conversion of the stored stroke duration in the case of a change<br>
in the conveyed amount and/or the motor RPM. With the therefrom<br>
derived reversal signal 76" it is ensured, that also in the case<br>
of a failure of the cylinder switch sensors 20, 20'; 22, 22' and<br>
pressure sensor 24 or, in the case of the absence of these<br>
sensors, an automatic reversing of the reversible pump 6 and the<br>
pipe switch 56 can be initiated.<br>
In the described reversing device there can be interconnected<br>
with each other to form a redundant, priority structured program<br>
sequence (Fig. 3) the monitoring routine 40 responding to<br>
cylinder switch sensors 20, 20'; 22, 22', the pressure<br>
monitoring routine 80 responsive to the pressure sensor 24, and<br>
the time monitoring routine 82 monitoring the stroke time, in<br>
this sequence. The triggering of the reversal process occurs<br>
via one of the three routines of the program sequence. Besides<br>
this, in the program block 84, after each reversal process the<br>
stroke time is monitored and in certain cases a new stroke<br>
duration is recorded.<br>
In summary the following can be concluded: The invention relates<br>
to a device and a method for controlling a two-cylinder thick<br>
matter pump comprising conveyance pistons that are actuated in a<br>
push-pull manner by means of a hydraulic reversible pump 6 and<br>
hydraulic drive cylinders controlled by said pump. For each<br>
pressure stroke, the conveyance cylinders 50, 50' are connected<br>
to a conveyance conduit 58 by means of a pipe switch 56. At the<br>
end of each conveyance stroke in the conveyance cylinders 50,<br>
50', a reversal process of the pipe switch 56 and the reversible<br>
pump 6 is triggered. The aim of the invention is to ensure a<br>
reliable operation of the pump, even in the event of a breakdown<br><br>
of switch and pressure sensors 20, 22, 24. To this end, during<br>
the calibration of the concrete pump and/or during the operation<br>
of the pump, the actual length of the stroke of the pistons 8,<br>
8' in the drive cylinders 5, 5' is measured and recorded as<br>
expected value, the stroke time of each conveyance stroke is<br>
monitored and compared with the expected stroke duration, and<br>
the reversible pump 6 is respectively pivoted, reversing the<br>
flow, and/or the pipe switch 56 is reversed, when the stroke<br>
time exceeds the expected stroke duration by a pre-determined<br>
value. The output signals of a pressure sensor 24 connected to<br>
the reversible pump 6 or cylinder switching sensors 20, 20'<br>
arranged on the working cylinders can also be evaluated in order<br>
to trigger a reversal process.<br><br>

11. Process as claimed in claim 10, wherein the recorded<br>
stroke duration is converted proportional to output or yield,<br>
depending upon a predetermined conveyance amount for the<br>
comparison with the actual stroke time.<br><br>
12.	Process as claimed in claim 10 or 11, wherein during<br>
the pump process the hydraulic pressure is monitored on the<br>
pressure side (78) of the reversible pump (6), and wherein a<br>
pressure increase measured at the end of one of each piston<br>
strokes is evaluated for formation of a reverse signal for the<br>
reversible pump (6) and/or the pipe switch (56).<br>
13.	Process as claimed in one of claims 10 through 12,<br>
wherein during the pumping process the passing by of the piston<br>
(8, 8') at the cylinder switch sensors (20, 20'; 22, 22) of the<br>
work or conveyor cylinder (5, 5'; 50, 50') is recorded and<br>
evaluated for determining a reverse signal for the reversible<br>
pump (6) and/or the pipe switch (56).<br>
14.	Process as claimed in claim 13, wherein the	output<br>
signals of two cylinder switch sensors (20, 20') provided	spaced<br>
apart from each other are evaluated for determining a	stroke<br>
duration and evaluated for recording subsequent to each	piston<br>
stroke.<br><br>
15.	Process as claimed in claim 13 or 14, wherein the<br>
output signals ( 76, 76'; 76") of the cylinder switch sensors<br>
(20, 20'; 22, 22'), the pressure monitoring sensor (24) and the<br>
stroke time/stroke duration comparison (82) are used for<br>
redundant initiation of a reversing process of the reversible<br>
pump (6) and/or pipe switch (36).<br>
Dated this 14th	day of	December 2005<br><br>
This invention relates to a device and process for controlling<br>
a thick matter pump with two conveyor cylinders (50, 50')<br>
communicating via two end openings (52) in a material supply<br>
container (54), operated in counter stroke by a hydraulic<br>
reversible pump (6) via hydraulic drive cylinders (5, 5') control<br>
by said pump, with a hydraulically actuated pipe switch (56)<br>
provided within the material supply container (54), on its inlet<br>
side alternatingly connectable to one of the opening (52) of the<br>
conveyor cylinders (50, 50'), freeing the respective other<br>
opening, and on the outlet side connected with a conveyor conduit<br>
(58), wherein the drive cylinders (5, 5') are hydraulically<br>
connected with a connector of the reversible pump	(6)	via<br>
respectively one hydraulic<br>
line (11, 11'), and on their other end are connected to each<br>
other via an oscillating oil line (12), and further comprising a<br>
device (18) for reversing the reversible pump (6) after the<br>
conclusion of each piston stroke, characterized in that the<br>
reversing device comprises a computer assisted routine (84, 82)<br>
for determining an expected stroke duration and for the recording<br><br>
thereof in a data storage as well as for monitoring the time<br>
during each piston stroke, and for initiating a reversal of the<br>
pipe switch (56) and/or the flow-through reversal of the<br>
reversible pump (6) based on a comparison of the value of an<br>
elapsed stroke time with the expected stroke duration.</td>
