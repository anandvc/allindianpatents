				<td>SUPPLYING AND EXHAUSTING SYSTEM IN PLASMA<br>
POLYMERIZING APPRATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a supplying and exhausting system<br>
for a plasma polymerizing apparatus and particularly, to a supplying and<br>
exhausting system for a plasma polymerizing apparatus in which gas is<br>
supplied and exhausted in the same direction of the flow of a substrate coated<br>
by plasma polymerizing.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
If a surface of a substrate such as a steel plate is coated with a thin<br>
film using plasma, a stratum tectorium having good consistency and abrasion<br>
resistance is formed. Products having the stratum tectorium are used as a<br>
magnetic disk, optical disk, carbide tool and the like. Also, if the paint-coated<br>
film generated on the surface of a steel plate is undergone plasma<br>
processing, an unplasticized paint coated steel plate having good durability<br>
and corrosion resistance. Particularly, through the processing, quality of the<br>
surfaces can be improved increasing hydrophile and hydrophobe by polymer<br>
polymerizing the surface of the substrate, and the improved substances are<br>
widely in use.<br>
As an example, Figure 1 is a sectional view showing an apparatus<br>
which can perform plasma polymerizing processing. Particularly, the<br>
apparatus is advantageous to coat thin film on a substrate with a great area.<br><br>
Also, an opposite electrode is positioned on the both sides of the substrate<br>
electrode and simultaneous polymerizing is possible thus to improve<br>
productivity. In the apparatus, the substrate 2 wound as a form of a roll is<br>
continuously fed from the unwinding chamber to the polymerizing chamber<br>
1 and after polymerizing processing of the surface of the substrate in the<br>
polymerizing chamber, the substrate 3 is fed to the winding chamber 10 then<br>
wound in the form of a roll. The reactive gas is supplied through the reactive<br>
gas inlet 7 to the chamber maintained a certain vacuum status and plasma<br>
is generated by allowing power in the opposite electrode 4 on the upper and<br>
lower surface of the substrate. In case plasma discharge is generated in the<br>
chamber, the reactive gases in which molecular binding is broken and then<br>
the broken chains and activated cations and anions are combined to form<br>
polymerized material. On one side of the chamber, outlet 8 of the reacted gas<br>
is installed.<br>
For this continuous processing apparatus, in case the gas inlet and<br>
gas outlet are installed in the polymerizing chamber, conventionally, the array<br>
relation is not specially considered and they are positioned so that the gas<br>
flow is formed in the vertical direction with the flow of the substrate in the<br>
polymerizing. Namely, in Figure 1, the gas inlet 7 and outlet 8 are positioned<br>
at the left and right ends of the lower portion of the polymerizing chamber.<br>
However, in positioning of the conventional gas inlet and outlet, there<br>
are disadvantages as follows. Firstly, gas flow in the polymerizing chamber<br>
is formed in the vertical direction with the flow of the substrate and<br>
accordingly, the reactive gas and the substrate can not react to each other<br><br>
sufficiently since the reactive gases stay for a short time. Secondly, gas flow<br>
in the polymerizing chamber is not formed uniformly as a whole thereof<br>
sufficient polymerizing can not be performed since the gas and substrate<br>
react in some area only. Due. to the problems, the surface characteristic of the<br>
 polymerized substrate is not uniform and defective products having desirable<br>
characteristics increase.<br>
Also, in case of a continuous polymerizing apparatus, post-processing<br>
chamber can be additionally installed for post-processing after the<br>
polymerizing processing. In this case, the exhaust port of the gas inlet should<br>
be installed in the respective chambers. In case the gas inlet and exhaust port<br>
are installed, to control each gas in inconvenient and the facility becomes<br>
more complicated thus to cause main problems. Therefore, a plasma<br>
polymerizing apparatus is necessary to control gas supply and exhaust simply<br>
and easily.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a plasma<br>
polymerizing apparatus which increases the time reactive gas stays on the<br>
surface of the substrate and enables efficient use of the reactive gas in the<br>
polymerizing chamber.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a plasma<br>
polymerizing apparatus with a simpler component to control gas supply and<br>
exhaust smoothly.<br><br>
To achieve the objects, the present invention provide a supplying and<br>
exhausting system for a plasma polymerizing apparatus having a<br>
polymerizing chamber capable of moving a substrate continuously in which<br>
gas inlet for supplying gas to a polymerizing chamber and a gas outlet for<br>
exhausting reactive gas supplied through the gas inlet and wherein the gas<br>
inlet and outlet are installed so that the reactive gas flows in substantially<br>
parallel with the moving direction of the substrate.<br>
The polymerizing chamber includes a vertical chamber in which a '<br>
substrate moves horizontally and vertically.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A supplying and exhausting system in accordance with the present<br>
invention is characterized that the plasma polymerizing apparatus which can<br>
move the substrate continuously has a polymerizing chamber in which the gas<br>
inlet and outlet are installed so that the reactive gas flows in substantially<br>
parallel with the moving direction of the substrate.<br>
The present invention can be applied to a case that the substrate<br>
moves in parallel as well as to a case of a vertical chamber (a polymerizing<br>
chamber in which the substrate moves vertically), which will be described.<br>
As an embodiment of the present invention, the gas inlet is positioned<br>
near the substrate inlet of the polymerizing chamber and the gas outlet is<br>
positioned near the substrate outlet of the polymerizing chamber. In addition,<br>
as another embodiment of the present invention, the gas inlet is positioned<br>
near the substrate outlet of the polymerizing chamber and the gas outlet is<br>
positioned near the substrate inlet of the polymerizing chamber.<br>
Also, the present invention provides a supplying and exhausting<br>
system for a plasma polymerizing apparatus having a post-processing<br><br>
chamber and post-processing chamber which respectively have a gas inlet<br>
and gas outlet and in the system, the gas outlet is positioned between the two<br>
chambers.<br>
In the system, the gas inlet is positioned in the same direction of the<br>
flow of the substrate at the entrance portion of the polymerizing chamber and<br>
the post-processing is positioned in the opposite direction of the flow of the<br>
substrate at the exit portion of the chamber. The gas flown from the gas outlet<br>
of the two chambers flows via an exhaust duct and a throttle valve and is<br>
sucked to a pump to be controlled as a whole.<br>
Figure 2a is a plan view showing an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. On the left, an unwinding chamber 9 for unwinding the substrate<br>
which is in the status of a roll to a form of sheet is positioned and a<br>
polymerizing chamber 1a is fed from the unwinding chamber to perform<br>
plasma polymerizing processing. Beside the polymerizing chamber, a post-<br>
processing chamber 1b is installed and the substrate is continuously post-<br>
processed. Here, secondary plasma polymerizing processing of the substrate<br>
or a processing for improving the quality of the substrate can be done. The<br>
substrate passed through the post-processing chamber is rewound to be a<br>
roll status in the winding chamber 10 on the right. The polymerizing chamber<br>
1a and post-processing chamber 1b respectively have the gas inlets 11,12<br>
and gas outlets which are references numeral and formed on the wall of the<br>
chamber. In case of the polymerizing chamber, the gas inlet is positioned at<br>
the entrance portion so that gas is supplied and exhausted in the same<br>
direction of the flow of the substrate of the polymerizing chamber and the gas<br>
rz<br><br>
outlet is positioned at the exit portion of the polymerizing chamber. On the<br>
other hand, in case of the post-processing chamber, the gas inlet 12 is<br>
positioned at the exit portion of the chamber so that the gas is supplied in the<br>
opposite direction of the flow of the substrate and the gas outlet is positioned<br>
at the entrance portion of the post-processing chamber. With the<br>
arrangement, the gas is supplied in the polymerizing chamber and post-<br>
processing chamber and the arrangement can control the supply of the two<br>
chambers as a whole. The gas from the outlet is flown to the pump 15 through<br>
the throttle valve 14.<br>
Figure 2b is a front sectional views showing a supplying and<br>
exhausting system of Figure 2a. The gas supplied from the gas inlets of the<br>
polymerizing chamber 1a and post-processing chamber 1b reacts with the<br>
substrate 2 which moves between electrodes 4 in the parallel direction and<br>
is sucked to the exhaust duct 13 through the exhaust port which is not shown<br>
in the drawings.<br>
The exhaust system controls the gas not to be agitated between each<br>
chamber in case of continuous plasma polymerizing and gas in each chamber<br>
can be controlled simultaneously with a pump. Accordingly, the equipment<br>
is simplified and the management is facilitated.<br>
The apparatus described above is composed as a single body.<br>
However, for more efficient continuous plasma polymerizing, it is desirable<br>
that the apparatus has a number of polymerizing chambers. Particularly, in<br>
case the plasma polymerizing apparatus includes a polymerizing chamber<br>
having an area in which the motion of the substrate flows vertically, supply<br><br>
and flowing direction and exhaust of the raw gas are very important to enable<br>
surface coating processing of good quality.<br>
As another embodiment of the present invention, a supplying and<br>
exhausting system which includes at least one polymerizing chamber in which<br>
the substrate is fed continuously and coated is provided. Also, in the plasma<br>
polymerizing apparatus, at least a polymerizing chamber is installed in the<br>
vertical direction of the flow of the substrate and the system includes the gas<br>
inlet and outlet which are positioned so that the gas flows in parallel with the<br>
flowing direction of the substrate positioned in the polymerizing chamber.<br>
In case the polymerizing chamber has an area which flows in the<br>
vertical direction of the flow of the substrate, to make the flowing direction of<br>
the raw gas and the substrate in parallel, a specific composition is necessary<br>
to compose the supplying and exhausting system for a plasma polymerizing<br>
apparatus. Particularly, the gas inlet and outlet are needed to be positioned<br>
properly considering the influence to gravity.<br>
Figure 3a shows the polymerizing chamber, which has an area in<br>
which the substrate flows vertically. The substrate 2 flows from the lower<br>
portion to the upper potion of the polymerizing chamber and the gas inlet 21a<br>
for supplying raw gas, that is, reactive gas and unreactive gas is installed on<br>
one end surface of the upper portion of the polymerizing chamber 1c. The gas<br>
outlet portion 22a for discharging the raw gas is installed on an end surface<br>
of the lower portion of the polymerizing chamber. Namely, the raw gas<br>
discharged from the gas inlet moves in the opposite direction of the flow of<br>
the substrate in parallel and is discharged through the gas outlet. Figure 3b<br><br>
shows a case that the substrate and the gas flow in the same direction by<br>
installing the gas inlet 21b and gas outlet of Figure 3a in the opposite<br>
direction. In this case, the characteristic of the raw gas flow on the surface of<br>
the substrate 2 is changed to be different from the characteristic in Figure 3a<br>
and accordingly, plasma polymerizing process according to the characteristic<br>
can be performed.<br>
Figures 4a and 4b are sectional view showing an embodiment in which<br>
the gas inlet and the gas outlet are installed on the both surfaces of the<br>
vertical-polymerizing chamber. In Figure 4a, the gas inlet 22c is installed on<br>
the both end surfaces of upper portion of the vertical chamber and the gas<br>
outlet 21c is installed on the both end surfaces of the lower portion of the<br>
vertical chamber so that the substrate 2 and gas flow in the opposite direction.<br>
In Figure 4b, the gas inlet 21 d is installed in the lower portion of the vertical<br>
chamber and the gas outlet 22d is installed in the upper portion of the vertical<br>
chamber so that the substrate 2 and gas flow in the same direction.<br>
Therefore, the amount of the raw gas flow increases to become more than<br>
the amount of the raw gas supply and exhaust and more uniform by installing<br>
respectively a gas inlet and a gas outlet thus to perform surface processing<br>
swiftly with a good quality.<br>
Also, in the present invention as shown in Figure 5a, the gas outlet<br>
channel 23 connected to the gas outlet can be included additionally and as<br>
shown in Figure 5b, a junction area 24 for unify at least one gas outlet<br>
channel 23. By installing the gas outlet channel in the gas outlet, the shape<br>
of the channel can be adjusted and the processing of the discharged gas can<br><br>
be facilitated. Particularly, in case the system includes a number of<br>
polymerizing chambers, the discharged gas can be processed with the<br>
junction area as a whole. Figures 5a and 5b describe about the vertical<br>
chamber. However, the description can be applied to the polymerizing<br>
chamber identically.<br>
The supplying and exhausting system in accordance with the present<br>
invention can achieve a uniform surface processing of good quality and<br>
control the amount of the gas supply and exhaust easily by adjusting the gas<br>
flow in parallel with the flow of the substrate even in case the plasma<br>
polymerizing apparatus having a number of polymerizing chambers has an<br>
area in which the substrate flows vertically in the polymerizing chamber.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As so far described, according to the present invention, the gas inlet<br>
and outlet is positioned so that the gas flows in substantially parallel with the<br>
moving direction of the substrate in the polymerizing chamber in which the<br>
motion of the substrate is performed in the parallel or vertical direction and<br>
accordingly, sufficient reaction is capable due to the long time duration of<br>
contact of the substrate and the reactive gas thus to achieve the substrate<br>
having a great effect of polymerizing process. In addition, the present<br>
invention can control the gas in the polymerizing chamber to be formed near<br>
the substrate and accordingly the reactive gas can be used efficiently thus to<br>
reduce cost to make the gas flow uniformly. Also, in the plasma polymerizing<br>
apparatus respectively having a polymerizing chamber and a post-processing<br><br>
chamber, the present invention provides a simpler supplying and exhausting<br>
system and accordingly, gas supply and exhaust can be controlled smoothly<br>
so that the gas is agitated in between the respective chambers. In addition,<br>
space for installation can be reduced since the gas in each chamber can be<br>
simultaneously controlled.<br><br>
