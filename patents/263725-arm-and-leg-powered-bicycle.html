				<td>ARM AND LEG POWERED BICYCLE<br>
[TECHNICAL FIELD]<br>
The present invention relates.to an arm and leg powered bicycle and<br>
more particularly to an arm and leg powered bicycle which can have a much<br>
higher speed due to the power of the arms in addition to that of the legs and<br>
which can also be used for the arm exercise.<br>
[BACKGROUND OF ART]<br>
Generally, the bicycles have been used conveniently and widely from<br>
old times as a transporting means which can run by causing the rear wheel to<br>
rotate through pedaling with the help of only legs without consumption of any<br>
fuel. Particularly recently the bicycle riding is favored by almost everyone as it<br>
is recognized as one of sports beneficial to the health in step with the rising<br>
interest in the health, because bicycles are not only free from the environment<br>
pollution owing to the exhaust gases but also the pedal movement for pressing<br>
the bicycle pedals corresponds to the aerobic exercise needed for the human<br>
body.<br>
The ordinary bicycle, however, are somewhat too deficient in the<br>
propulsive force to be the long distance transporting means or mountaineer<br>
bicycles. Therefore, the speed change gears have been mounted on bicycles to<br>
increase the propulsive force and there has been proposed a plan to drive both<br>
the front gear and the rear gear simultaneously. However, such bicycles mostly<br>
failed to be put to practical use because of the unreliable operation and<br>
1<br><br>
considerable resistance in the power transmitting processes.<br>
[DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION]<br>
The present inventor was engaged intensively in developing a bicycle<br>
capable of being powered by the arms in conjunction with the legs upon the<br>
judgment that the ability to increase the speed of a bicycle and to help the arm<br>
exercise at the same time by modifying the fixed handle levers in the ordinary<br>
bicycles driven so far only by the feet power so as to be driven by the hands<br>
would be a great help to the improvement in the health.<br>
As the result, the present inventor has come to develope a new bicycle<br>
with a safe and simple structure, in which bicycle the vertical movement of the<br>
handle levers can be applied to the driving force of the rear wheel by embodying<br>
the handle levers to be movable, still maintaining the overall balance of the<br>
bicycle, and subsequently by causing the resulting movement to be transferred<br>
to the pedal shaft so as to cooperate synchronously with the movement of the<br>
pedals.<br>
The object of the invention, corresponding to the provision of the<br>
bicycle described last, is achieved according to an aspect of the invention by an<br>
arm and leg powered bicycle, comprising handle levers, front wheel, rear wheel,<br>
handle shaft, supporting frames connecting various parts, pedal shaft for<br>
transferring the movement of the pedals to the rear wheel, front and rear<br>
sprockets and a chain belt revolving around the sprockets, wherein an operating<br>
means for vertically rotating the handle levers and a means for transferring the<br>
rotating force of the handle levers to a pedal shaft are further provided and the<br>
2<br><br>
handle levers and the pedals are moved oppositely to each other to cause the<br>
vertical rotation of the handle levers to cooperate synchronously with the<br>
movement of the pedals, with the overall balance of the bicycle body maintained.<br>
Preferably, the operating means for vertically rotating the handle levers<br>
is composed of a handle rotation shaft provided vertically movably at the central<br>
position of the straight line of handle levers, one or two operating rods<br>
connected to the left side, right side or both sides of the handle levers, and a<br>
handle rotation shaft support, and further the handle levers are provided so as to<br>
be rotatable around the handle lever rotating shaft as the rotation center by the<br>
operation of an actuating pin, said actuating pin being provided on the top of the<br>
handle shaft, and the above-described means for transferring the rotating force<br>
of the handle levers to a pedal shaft comprises a crank shaft connected to the<br>
operating rod or rods and rotatable by the vertical movement of the operating<br>
rod or rods, a rotating shaft inserted in the inner cavity of a lower supporting<br>
frame connected to a handle shaft supporting member, said rotating shaft acting<br>
to transfer the driving force of the handle levers to the pedal shaft, a flexible<br>
joint provided at one end of the rotating shaft, a driving gear provided at the<br>
other end of the rotating shaft, and a driven gear mounted on the circumference<br>
of the pedal shaft and engaged with the driving gear to transfer the rotation<br>
force to the pedal shaft.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, one end of the crank shaft<br>
is connected to the flexible joint provided in the rotation shaft through a cut-out<br>
groove provided in the handle shaft supporting member and the other end of the<br>
crank shaft is connected to the handle rotation shaft support so as to allow for<br>
3<br><br>
the crank shaft to rotate in conjunction with the operating rod or rods in<br>
accordance with the movement of the handle levers. Preferably, the crank shaft<br>
is shaped with bends in the form of U or s depending on the number of the<br>
rods for the smooth operation and also the crank shaft may be formed optionally<br>
in a straight line, wherein a crank shaft gear and a rotating shaft gear are<br>
mounted integrally therewith to transfer the torque produced at the handle<br>
levers ultimately to the pedal shaft.<br>

[BEST MODE FO CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION]<br>
The present invention is described in detail below by referring to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Figs. 1 to 13 show the overall structure of the representative first<br>
embodiment of arm and leg powered bicycle according to the invention and Figs.<br>
14 to 18, as a variant of the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 13, show the<br>
operative relation for the case where the operation rods as the operation means<br>
for vertical turning of the handle levers ot the invention are mounted in number<br>
of tv/o. Further, Figs. 19 to 23 show the third embodiment of the invention<br>
illustrating a still other example of the crank shaft as the transmitting means for<br>
the torque of the handle levers in the invention.<br>
As described in detail in Figs. 1 and 2, the arm and leg powered bicycle<br>
according to the invention comprises handle levers 6a and 6b, front and rear<br>
wheel 1 and 2, and pedals 12a and 12b, as in the ordinary bicycles, and further<br>
comprises a handle shaft 7 connected to the handle levers 6a and 6b and<br>
connected also to the front wheel 1 via handle shaft supporting member 10a, and<br>
a pedal shaft 19 for transferring the motion of the pedals 12a and 12b to the<br>
rear wheel 2 together with front and rear sprockets 14a and 14b and a chain belt<br>
13 circulating around the sprockets. Additionally, there are included a saddle<br>
(not numbered) and several supporting frames 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4f and 4g to<br>
connect and support the above described members.<br>
In addition, the arm and leg powered bicycle according to the invention<br>
includes further the operative means A for the purpose of moving the handle<br>
members 6a and 6b up and down, which means consists of a handle rotation<br>
7<br><br>
shaft 3, an operating rod 11 and a handle rotation shaft support 9, and the means<br>
B for transmitting the rotating force of the handle levers 6a and 6b to the pedal<br>
shaft 19, which means consists of a crank shaft 5, a rotation shaft 16, a flexible<br>
joint 15, a driving gear 17 and a driven gear 18 combined to the pedal shaft 19.<br>
The handle rotation shaft 3, which is located at the center of the handle<br>
levers 6a and 6b to act as a fulcrum of the levers, is disposed so that the<br>
opposite ends of the shaft 3 may be freely movable in the vertical direction on<br>
the tops of the handle shaft 7 and the handle rotation shaft support 9 (Refer to<br>
Fig. 5). Further, the top of the handle shaft 7 is provided with an actuating pin 8,<br>
so that it can come into or out of the engagement with a hole 8b positioned in<br>
the rear of the handle rotation shaft 3 through a through-hole 8a positioned at<br>
that top, as shown in Figs. 2, 5 and 6, wherein the actuating pin is used to allow<br>
the rotation or immobility of the handle rotation shaft 3. The handle rotation<br>
shaft 3 which is pivotally mounted through bearings acts to allow the vertical<br>
movement of the handle levers 6a and 6b in accordance with the movement of<br>
the driver's hands.<br>
The operating rod 11, which is positioned inwardly of the handle shaft 7,<br>
the handle rotation shaft 3 and the handle rotation shaft support 9 contiguous<br>
thereto, is fixed to the left or right side of the handle levers 6a and 6b, as shown<br>
in Figs. 1 to 6, while the top part 11a maintains the free tilting of the handle<br>
levers 6a and 6b through a pin hole 11b. Further, the lower part 11c of the<br>
operating rod 11 is appropriately connected to the crank shaft 5 as a means to<br>
transmitting the rotating force of the handle levers 6a and 6b to the pedal shaft<br>
19.<br>
8<br><br>
The crank shaft 5 is connected to the operating rod 11 so as to be<br>
movable up and down. As can be seen from Fig. 2, one end of the crank shaft 5<br>
is connected to the flexible joint 15 provided in the rotation shaft 16 functioning<br>
to transmit the rotating force of the handle levers 6a and 6b to the pedal shaft<br>
19 through a cut-out groove 10b provided in the lower part of the handle shaft 7,<br>
wherein the flexible joint 15 is positioned in the hollow cavity of a lower<br>
supporting frame 4b which in turn is connected to the handle shaft supporting<br>
member 10a of a bicycle. Further, the other end of the crank shaft 5 is<br>
connected to the handle rotation shaft support 9 so as to allow for the crank<br>
shaft 5 to turn freely. The crank shaft 5 is shaped approximately in the form of<br>
U, wherein the projected part of the U form is connected to the bottom 11c of<br>
the operating rod 11.<br>
The above-described rotation shaft 16 is mounted in the inner cavity of<br>
the lower supporting frame 4b, which is provided as a skeleton structure<br>
between the handle shaft supporting member 10a of the handle shaft 7 and the<br>
pedal shaft 19, as in ordinary bicycles, wherein one end of the rotation shaft 16<br>
is connected to the flexible joint 15 moving smoothly corresponding to the<br>
movement of the crank shaft 5 and the opposite end thereof is provided with the<br>
driving gear 17.<br>
Particularly as shown in the enlarged view of Fig. 12, the driving gear<br>
17 is formed, on its inner circumference, with two toothed parts 17a at<br>
diagonally opposite positions, that is, 180° spaced from each other.<br>
Correspondingly, the bottom end of the rotating shaft 16 is mounted with two<br>
rocking members 21 each having a toothed part 22, wherein the rocking<br>
9<br><br>
members 21 can elastically be expanded to or shrunk from the driving gear 17<br>
on the base of the supporting point 21a by the springs 20 so as to engage with<br>
or disengage from the gear 17.<br>
A chain belt 13 is mounted around the two sprockets 14a and 14b as in<br>
usual cases. In the arm and leg powered bicycle according to the invention, a<br>
driven gear 18 is combined to the pedal shaft 19 for rotating the sprockets 14a<br>
and 14b, wherein the driven gear 18 is so arranged as to be rotated by the<br>
driving gear 17, as depicted in Fig. 2 and Figs. 9 to 11.<br>
In order to speed up an arm and leg powered bicycle according to the<br>
invention, as constructed as described in the above, the actuating pin 8 provided<br>
on the top of the handle shaft 7 for the handle levers 6a and 6b is pulled upward,<br>
as seen in Fig. 2, to permit the handle levers 6a and 6b, which have been<br>
immovable together with the handle rotation shaft 3 due to the actuating pin 8,<br>
to turn alternately about the handle rotation shaft 3, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8.<br>
The operating rod 11 connected to the handle levers 6a and 6b are<br>
caused to move up and down according to the movement as described above, so<br>
that the crank shaft 5 for transmitting the rotating force of the handle levers 6a<br>
and 6b to the pedal shaft 19 may be rotated around its horizontal ends by and<br>
together with the rotating rod 11, as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
Thus, the rotation of the crank shaft 5 is transferred to the rotation<br>
shaft 16 through the flexible joint 15 connected to the crank shaft 5, so that the<br>
rotation of the rotation shaft 16 causes, as concretely shown in Fig. 13b, the<br>
rocking members 21 located at the bottom of the shaft 16 to advance elastically<br>
toward the driving gear 17 on the base of the supporting point 21a under the<br>
10<br><br>
urging force of the springs 20, to thereby engage the toothed parts 22 with the<br>
toothed parts 17a of the driving gear 17, resulting in the rotation of the latter,<br>
whereby the driven gear 18 which is in engagement with the driving gear 17 and<br>
is fastened around the pedal shaft 19 is caused to rotate in order finally to hand<br>
over the torque of the handle levers 6a and 6b to the pedal shaft 19.<br>
On the other hand, when the handle rotation shaft 3 is restrained by the<br>
actuating pin 8, the operating means A for the vertical turning of the handle<br>
levers 6a and 6b remains inactivated, as shown in Fig. 13a. In this case, when<br>
the pedals 12 are rotated only by the feet, the driven gear 18 and the driving<br>
gear 17 connected to the driven gear can be rotated, while the toothed parts 17a<br>
of the driving gear 17 are little affected by the toothed parts 22 of the rocking<br>
members 21 during this rotation due to the elastic property of the rocking<br>
members 21 fixed to the immobile rotation shaft 16.<br>
Thus, the inventive arm and leg powered bicycle having the above-<br>
descried construction may be operated in such a manner that the left pedal 12a<br>
is lowered for the half cycle of one turn of raising the left handle lever 6a and<br>
the right pedal 12b is lowered for the subsequent half cycle of raising the right<br>
handle lever 6b, wherein the leg power may simultaneously be added while the<br>
corresponding pedal is forwardly lowered.<br>
Accordingly, the arm and leg powered bicycle according to the invention<br>
can be used so that the laborious raising or lowering of the handle levers 6a and<br>
6b may cooperate synchronously with the pressing-down movement of the leg<br>
pedals 12a and 12b, while maintaining the balance of the bicycle body. As is<br>
evident, the inventive bicycle is characterized in that the power of the arms can<br>
11<br><br>
take part equally in driving the bicycle as compared to the conventional bicycle<br>
depending exclusively on the power of the legs.<br>
Now referring to Pigs. 14 to 18, the arm and leg powered bicycle shown<br>
therein have the same construction as that shown in Figs. 1 to 13, except that<br>
the operating rods 11, in the operating means A for turning the handle levers 6a<br>
and 6b, are disposed at the two positions, that is, on the left and right sides of<br>
the handle levers 6a and 6b, wherein the crank shaft 5' rotating synchronously<br>
with the operating rods 11 is shaped in the form of doubled U or = to suit the<br>
movement of the rods 11.<br>
Particularly, as seen in the exploded perspective view of Fig. 15 and the<br>
cross sectional view of Fig. 16, the two rods 11 are respectively connected to<br>
the protrudent portions of the s shaped crank shaft 5'. When the handle levers<br>
6a and 6b are caused to move up and down after removing the actuating pin 8 in<br>
the inactive state as shown in Fig. 17, the operations take place in the same<br>
way as in the foregoing first embodiment, as can be seen in Fig. 18.<br>
Furthermore, in the arm and leg powered bicycle as shown in Figs. 19<br>
to 23 representing the variant embodiment of the invention, the crank shaft 5",<br>
on which a crank shaft gear 23 and a rotation shaft gear 24 as a bevel gears are<br>
mounted, are installed.<br>
As one operating rod 11 and the other operating rod 11 are<br>
successively lowered and raised alternately, the crank gear 23 is rotated in one<br>
direction to cause the gear 24 in engagement with this crank gear to rotate in<br>
one constant direction, resulting in the rotation of the rotation shaft 16 through<br>
the flexible joint 15 connected to the gear 24. Hereupon, the top parts 11a of the<br>
12<br><br>
operating rods 11 are constructed so as to move up and down more smoothly<br>
with the help of ring members 25 disposed on the handle levers 6a and 6b, as<br>
can be appreciated from Figs. 19 and 21, whereas the bottom parts 11c are<br>
connected to the opposite ends of the crank shaft 5" having the gear 23. The<br>
succeeding steps of operation are the same as in the foregoing embodiments.<br>
The arm and leg powered bicycle according to the invention,<br>
constructed as described above, are advantageous in that the handle levers are<br>
moved up and down by the motion of the arms to transfer the rotating power to<br>
the pedal shafts to thereby increase the stepping power by the feet for attaining<br>
the doubled running speed of the bicycle and the exercise for the both arms can<br>
be conducted simultaneously to benefit the health.<br>
In addition, the arm and leg powered bicycle according to the invention<br>
has the advantage that the rotating power of the handle levers can assuredly be<br>
transferred to the pedal shaft in a simple way, while maintaining the balance of<br>
the bicycle body, differently from the conventional front and rear wheel method,<br>
and that rotating power produced by the hands cooperates synchronously with<br>
the stepping power of the pedals in rotating the pedal shaft for the safe travel of<br>
the bicycle.<br>
