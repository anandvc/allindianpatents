				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fungicide composition for agriculture and horticulture, in particular to a fungicide composition for agriculture and horticulture showing excellent control effect on fungi on rice plants, which can be useful as alternative agent to prevent the damage caused by the reduction of control efficacy, notably after the occurrence of resistant species of fungi to metalaxyl.<br>
Hitherto, as a purpose of control of rice seedling blight caused by Pythium species, prevention of molded seedlings or keeping seedlings in good growth<br>
•<br>
conditions, during the time period of rice seedling preparation, mainly a straight<br>
formulation   of  hymexazol  or  a   mixed  formulation   comprising   as  active<br>
ingredients hymexazol and metalaxyl are mainly used widely and generally as<br>
practice by irrigating into the soil or mixing with the soil. These two compounds<br>
are known as fungicide active ingredients.<br>
Oft the other hand, fenamidone is an already known fungicide compound per<br>
se.<br>
More information and process for their respective preparation are available in<br>
the Pesticide Manual.<br>
Metalaxyl, a type of phenylamido compound, have been accepted by specialists in plant disease and by farmers of rice production, from the early stage of commercialisation, by the reasons of good cure effect due to the high penetrating transportation, and long after effect due to the high effect on the<br><br>
newly shooting leaves. Therefore, metalaxyl is widely used as a specific fungicide agent for controlling downy mildew, seedling blight, Pythium diseases notably and plant diseases by other Oomycetes species. Especially, a combination of metalaxyl with hymexazol can enhance the control effect on seedling blight of rice, and preventive effect on occurrence of molded seedlings, consequently, has been used widely by farmers of rice production. However, the occurrence of resistant species has been reported in European countries where the commercialisation has been,advanced. Following to this report, there has been introduced a recommendation in Japan to place limitation on the combination with so called protective fungicide, the timing of use, the numbers of use, the duration of spraying notably. Nevertheless, there have been observed the occurrence of late blight of potato and downy mildew of cucumber in Japan notably.<br>
In addition, there has been reported on the occurrence of resistant species of Pythium disease of turf, which is the same type of soil disease as seedling<br>
*<br>
blight of ripe, in the test use of metalaxyl.<br>
In the near future, this kind of occurrence of resistant species can be expected<br>
on seedling blight of rice, which is the same type of soil disease as Pythium<br>
disease   of  turf.   Therefore,   it   is   now   strongly   desired   to   consider  a<br>
countermeasure in advance to overcome the reduction of control efficacy of<br>
metalaxyl.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a fungicide composition for agriculture and horticulture which show excellent characteristics to be notably effective on the species resistant to metalaxyl agents and also show good efficacy on the seedling growth in good conditions during the preparation time period of rice seedlings.<br><br>

The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and do not limit it in any manner.<br>
•<br>
Formulation Example 1 (dust formulation)<br>
(Table Remove)The above mixture was pulverised uniformly using an Equ Sample KII-1 Model manufactured by Fuji Powder Company Ltd to obtain dust formulation. Keiwa Clay Huhi is a commercial product of Keiwa Rozai Company Ltd<br>
Formulation Example 2 (flowable formulation) (1) Process of fenamidone slurry<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The above mixture was pulverised uniformly under wet conditions by a 0.1S Atoliter (manufactured by Mitsui Mining Company Ltd) to obtain fenamidone slurry (diameter of particle : D50 : 2.67um).<br>
(2) Process for the solution<br>
PittuCoal K-30 (manufactured by Daiichi Kogyo Company Ltd)<br>
12.5 weight %<br><br>
Propylene   glycol   (manufactured   by   Go   Do   Solvent Company Ltd)Water<br>
25.0 weight %<br>
The above mixture was mixed to obtain the solution.<br>
(3) Process for the solution of viscosity enhancement<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The above mixture was mixed to obtain a solution of the viscosity enhancement<br>
(4) Process for formulation of the aqueous suspension<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Sixty weight % of an already prepared ammonium solution of hymexazol (50 % by weight) was added to the above mixture, and the total volume was adjusted to 100 weight % by adding water.<br>
Thus, an aqueous suspension comprising 4.0 weight % of fenamidone and 30.0 weight % of hyrnexazole was obtained.<br>
Formulation example 3 (Wettable powder) (Table Remove)<br>
 The above mixture was mixed and filtrated by Radiollite # 200 to obtain a liquid formulation according to the invention.<br>
• Test example 1: test of dust formula of the formulation example 1 on seedling<br>
blight of rice<br>
Culture of Pythium graminicola being cultured in advance in the medium of rice<br>
bran was mixed with artificial soil and supplied as fungal contaminated soil. A<br>
plastic box of the size 1/15 of a nursery box for rice seedlings was used as<br>
container and one box was used as one plot.<br>
Each sample of test compound being predetermined was mixed with the fungal<br>
contaminated soil (soil mixture prior to sowing) and seeds were sown and<br>
covered with the fungal contaminated soil.<br>
These containers were placed in a humidified room at 30°C for 3 days,<br>
continuously in a room at 10°C for 3 days and assessed the effect after keeping<br>
in a room of normal room temperature for 2 weeks.<br>
The assessment was achieved by measuring the number of seedlings showing<br>
rice blight symptoms and brawn roots, and the control effect was expressed as<br>
numbers of infected seedling per 100 seedlings in one plot.<br>
In addition, synergistic effect was determined based on the Colby formula for<br>
calculation  of synergistic and  antagonistic  response  of active ingredient<br>
combinations, published in Weed 15 (1967) 20-22.<br>
The Colby formula can be expressed as the following in case of combination of<br>
two types of herbicides.<br>
E = X + Y-(XY/100)<br>
Wherein X means the control effect (%) of Compound A of effective dose p, Y<br>
means the control effect (%) of Compound B of effective dose q, and E means<br>
expected control effect (%) of Compound A + B of effective dose p + q<br>
(theoretical value).<br>
In case that the actually measured value is higher than the theoretical value<br>
calculated with the Colby formula, it can be elucidated that the effect of such<br>
combination is over the additive effect, namely such combination shows<br>
synergistic effect.<br>
The results of the above test example are shown in the following table 1.<br>
(Table Remove)<br><br>
Table 1: Test results of dust formula of the formulation example 1 on rice<br>
seedling blight<br>
As clearly seen in the test results of table 1, the actujally measured value is over than the theoretical value (E) in the test results using the dust formula of the formulation example 1. Therefore, it can be said that the composition of the present invention is over the additive effect, namely, shows synergistic effect.<br>
Test example 2: Test of flowable (SO formula of the formulation example 2 on seedling blight of rice<br>
This test was achieved by using the same fungal contaminated soil and<br>
containers as for the test example 1.<br>
As application of chemicals, each liquid sample (500 ml / nursery box) being<br>
prepared in advance was applied by irrigating into the soil after seed sowing<br>
and afterward covered by the fungal contaminated soil.<br>
The test process and assessment were achieved afterwards by according to<br>
those being explained in the test example 1. These results are shown in table 2.<br>
(Table Remove)<br><br><br>
Table 2: Test results of flowable formula (SC) of the formulation example 2 on<br>
rice seedling blight<br>
As clearly seen in the test results of table 2, the actually measured value is over than the theoretical value (E) in the test results using the flowable formulation (SC) of the formulation example 2. Therefore, it can be said that the<br>
composition of the present invention is over the additive effect, namely, shows synergistic effect.<br>
The compositions of the present invention, being clearly demonstrated in the above test examples, show excellent control effect on seedling blight of rice. This excellent effect has been obtained by combination of two different fungicides being different in functional mechanism, therefore, it can be said that such excellent effect is due to synergistic effect over the additive effect.<br><br><br><br>
