Stvrvl sulfide dyes<br>
The present invention relates to novel styryl sulfide dyes, compositions thereof, to processes for their preparation and to their use for the dyeing of organic materials, such as keratin fibers, wool, leather, silk, cellulose or polyamides, especially keratin-containing fibers, cotton or nylon, and preferably hair, more preferably human hair.<br>
It is known, for example, from WO 95/01772 that cationic dyes can be used for the dyeing of organic material, for example keratin, silk, cellulose or cellulose derivatives, and also synthetic fibers, for example polyamides. Cationic dyes exhibit very brilliant shades. A disadvantage is their unsatisfactory fastness to washing.<br>
R. S. Asquith, P. Carthew and T. T. Francis describe in JSDC from May 1973, pages 168-172 that ortho-azo disulfide dyes do not lead to covalent bonding with keartin fiber of wool, and that para-azo disulfide dyes underwent only at high concentration some covalent bindings with wool.<br>
The technical problem is to provide dyes that are distinguished by deep dying having good fastness properties with respect to washing, light, shampooing and rubbing.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of dyeing keratin-containing fibers, comprising treating the fiber with at least one styryl disulfide dye of formula<br><br>

Customary, the temperature is in the range of 273 to 393 K, preferably 300 to 370 K during the mixing of the starting compounds.<br>
The reaction time is generally dependent on the reactivity of the starting compounds, on the selected reaction temperature and on the desired conversion. The selected reaction time is usually in the range from one hour to three days.<br>
The selected reaction pressure is generally in the range from 0.1 to 10 bar especially from 0,2 to 3,0 bar and is more especially atmospheric pressure.<br>
It may by desirable to conduct the reaction of compounds in the presence of a catalyst.<br><br>
Suitable catalysts are for example an alkali metal C1-C6alkyloxide, such as sodium-, potassium or lithium C1-C6alkyloxide, preferably sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide or lithium methoxide, or sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide or lithium ethoxide; or secondary ortertiary amines, for example, such as chinuclidine, piperidine, N-methylpiperidine, pyridine, trimethylamine, dimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, trioctylamine, 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octan, chinuclidine.

Preferred are potassium acetate, sodium methoxide, pyridine and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]-octan, piperidine.<br>
The molar ratio of compound of formula (1a) to the catalyst is generally selected in the range from 10:1 to 1:5, especially in the range from 10:1 to 1:1.<br>
The product prepared according to the process of the present invention may be advantageously worked up and isolated, and if desired be purified.<br>
Customary, the work up starts by decreasing the temperature of the reaction mixture in the range from 280 to 350 K, especially in the range from 290 to 320 K.<br>
It may be advantageous to decrease the temperature slowly, over a period of several hours.<br>
In general, the reaction product is usually filtered off and then washed with water, a solvent or a salt solution and subsequently dried.<br>
Filtration is normally carried out in standard filtering equipment, for example Buchner funnels, filter presses, pressurised suction filters, preferably in vacuo.<br>
The temperature for the drying is dependent on the applied pressure. Drying is usually carried out in vacuo at 50-200 mbar.<br>
The drying is usually carried out at a temperature in the range from 313 to 363 K, especially from 323 to 353 K, and more especially in the range from 328 to 348 K.<br>
Advantageously the product is purified by recrystallisation after isolation.<br><br>
Organic solvents and solvent mixtures are suitable for the recrystallisation, preferably alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol or butanol, especially 2-propanol.<br>
The dyes of formula (1) according to the invention are suitable for dyeing organic materials, such as keratin-containing fibers, wool, leather, silk, cellulose or polyamides, cotton or nylon, and preferably human hair. The dyeings obtained are distinguished by their depth of shade and their good fastness properties to washing, such as, for example, fastness to light, shampooing and rubbing. The stability, in particular the storage stability of the dyes according to the invention are excellent.<br>
Gernerally, hair dyeing agents on a synthetic base may be classiefied itnto three groups: temporary dyeing agents semipermanent dyeing agents, and permanent dyeing agents.<br>
The multiplicity of shades of the dyes can be increased by combination with other dyes.<br>
Therefore the dyes of formula (1) of the present invention may be combined with dyes of the same or other classes of dyes, especially with direct dyes, oxidation dyes; dye precursor combinations of a coupler compound as well as a diazotized compound, or a capped diazotized compound and/or cationic reactive dyes.<br>
Direct dyes are of natural origin or may be prepared synthetically. They are uncharged, cationic or anionic, such as acid dyes.<br>
The dyes of formula (1) may be used in combination with at least one single direct dye different from the dyes of formula (1).<br>
Direct dyes do not require any addition of an oxidizing agent to develop their dyeing effect. Accordingly the dyeing results are less permanent than those obtained with permanent dyeing compositions. Direct dyes are therefore preferably used for semipermanent hair dyeings.<br><br>
Examples of direct dyes are described in "Dermatology", edited by Ch. Culnan, H. Maibach, Verlag Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, Basle, 1986, Vol. 7, Ch. Zviak, The Science of Hair Care, chapter 7, p. 248-250, and in "Europaisches Inventar der Kosmetikrohstoffe", 1996, published by The European Commission, obtainable in diskette form from the Bundesver-band der deutschen Industrie- und Handelsunternehmen fiir Arzneimittel, Reformwaren und Korperpflegemittel e.V., Mannheim.<br>

In addition, the present invention relates to a method of<br><br>
a.	treating the keratin-containing fibers with a compound of formula (1),<br>
b.	wearing the coloured hair for the desired period of time,<br>
c.	removing the colour applied in step a. from hair by contacting the hair with an aqueous<br>
based colour removal composition containg a reduction agent capable of disrupting the<br>
-S-S-bonds between the dye molecule and the hair fiber surface to cause the dye<br>
molcule to become disassociated from the hair fiber.<br>
Further, the present invention concerns a process, comprising treating the hair with<br>
a.	a reduction agent, and<br>
b.	at least one single styryl sulfide dye of formula (1) as defined above, and optionally<br>
c.	with an oxidizing agent.<br>
The sequence of the reaction steps is generally not important, the reduction agent can be applied first or in a final step.<br>

a^) with at least one single dye of formula (1), and<br>
bi) then with a reduction agent; or<br>
a process, which comprises treating the hair<br>
82) with a reduction agent and<br>
b2) then with at least one single sulfide dye of formula (1) as defined above.<br>
In the present invention preferred is further a process, which comprises treating the hair<br>
a)	with a reduction agent,<br>
b)	then with at least one dye of formula (1), and<br>
c)	then with an oxidizing agent.<br>
A further process of the present invention comprises contacting hair<br>
a)	with at least one single dye of formula (1),<br>

Further preferred is a process for dyeing keratin-containing fibers which comprises treating the keratin-containing fiber with at least one dye of formula (1), a base and an oxidizing agent.<br>
The oxidation dyeing process usually involves lightening, that is to say that it involves applying to the keratin-containing fibers, at basic pH, a mixture of bases and aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution, leaving the applied mixture to stand on the hair and then rinsing the hair. It allows, particularly in the case of hair dyeing, the melanin to be lightened and the hair to be dyed.<br>
Lightening the melanin has the advantageous effect of creating a unified dyeing in the case of grey hair, and, in the case of naturally pigmented hair, of bringing out the color, that is to say of making it more visible.<br>
