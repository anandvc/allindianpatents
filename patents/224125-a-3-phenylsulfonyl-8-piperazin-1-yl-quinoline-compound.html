The A/-protecting group used may be any conventional group e.g. t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) or benzyloxycarbonyl. Further A/-protecting groups which may be used include methyl.<br>
Process (a) wherein a compound of formula (II) is reacted with a compound of formula A-SO2H typically comprises use of basic conditions and may be most conveniently carried out by using a suitable salt of the compound A-SO2H (e.g. the sodium salt) in an appropriate solvent such as A/./V-dimethylformamide, in the presence of a transition metal salt such as copper (I) iodide.<br>
Process (a) wherein a compound of formula (II) is reacted with a compound of formula A-SH typically comprises use of basic conditions e.g. by using a suitable salt of the compound A-SH (e.g. the sodium salt) in an appropriate solvent such as N.N-dimethylformamide, in the presence of a suitable metal salt such as copper (I) iodide, followed by use of a suitable oxidant such as 3-chloroperbenzoic acid, peracetic acid or potassium monopersulfate.<br>
In processes (a) and (b), examples of protecting groups and the means for their removal can be found in T. W. Greene 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' (J. Wiley and Sons, 1991).

Other suitable amine protecting groups include trifluoroacetyl (-COCF3) which may be removed by base catalysed hydrolysis or a solid phase resin bound benzyl group, such as a Merrifield resin bound 2,6-dimethoxybenzyl group (Ellman linker), which may be removed by acid catalysed hydrolysis, for example with trifluoroacetic acid. A further amine protecting group includes methyl which may be removed using standard methods for N-dealkylation (e.g. 1-chloroethyl chloroformate under basic conditions followed by treatment with methanol).<br>
Process (c) may be performed using conventional interconversion procedures such as epimerisation, oxidation, reduction, reductive alkylation, alkylation, nucleophilic or electrophilic aromatic substitution, ester hydrolysis or amide bond formation. For example. Aklealkylation of a compound of formula (!) wherein R1 represents an alkyl group to give a compound of formula (I) wherein R1 represents hydrogen. It will be appreciated that such interconversion may be interconversion of protected derivatives of formula (I) which may subsequently be deprotected following interconversion.<br>
In addition, process (c) may comprise, for example, reacting a compound of formula (I), wherein R1 represents hydrogen, with an aldehyde or ketone in the presence of a reducing agent in order to generate a compound of formula (I) where R1 represents d. ealkyl.

Orally administrate compositions are generally preferred.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose form, and may contain conventional excipients, such as binding agents, fillers, tabletting lubricants, disintegrants and acceptable wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspension, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be in the form of a dry product for reconstitutlon with water or other suitable vehicle before use.

Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents are dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved, and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspension in a sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
•<br>
The composition may contain from 0.1% to 99% by weight, preferably from 10 to 60% by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration.<br>
The dose of the compound used in the treatment of the aforementioned disorders will vary in the usual way with the seriousness of the disorders, the weight of the sufferer, and other similar factors. However, as a general guide suitable unit doses may be 0.05 to 1000 mg, more suitably 0.05 to 200 mg, for example 20 to 40 mg; and such unit doses will preferably be administered once a day, although administration more than once a day may be required; and such therapy may extend for a number of weeks or months.<br>

A slurry of 8-nitro-3-phenylsulfonylquinoline (D4) (46.7 g, 172 mmol), in tetrahydrofuran (750 ml) was added to a stirred solution of 30% titanium (III) chloride in aqueous HCI (470 ml) [Supplied by BDH] cooled in an ice bath, at such a rate that the temperature was maintained below 35°C. Once the addition was completed, the solution was stirred for a further 10 minutes then water (1.5 L) was introduced and the mixture poured into a 5 L beaker. The rapidly stirred solution was treated by portionwise addition of solid potassium carbonate in order to attain pH -8.5. EDTA (250 g, 0.86 mol) was added and followed by further potassium carbonate to maintain pH -8.5. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 1 L) and the combined organic phase passed through a silica plug (500 g) eluting with further dichloromethane (1 L) and 10% ethyl acetate in dichloromethane (1 L). The combined organic phases were evaporated and the residue subjected to purification using Biotage Flash-75 chromatography apparatus (2 kg silica gel), eluting with dichloromethane and increasing proportions of ether to give the title compound (D5) (34.5 g, 72%) as a pale brown solid;<br>
