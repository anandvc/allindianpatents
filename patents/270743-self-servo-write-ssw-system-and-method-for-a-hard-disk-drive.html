"METHOD FOR IMPROVED INSITU SPIRAL WRITING"<br><br>
MARVELL WORLD TRADE LTD., a Corporation organized under the laws of Barbados, having a place of business at L'Horizon Gunsite Road, Brittons Hill, St. Michael, Barbados, BB 14027.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/097945<br><br>
PCT/US200 7/003742<br><br>
METHOD FOR IMPROVED INSITU SPIRAL WRITING<br>
FIELD [0001]     The present disclosure relates to hard disk drives (HDDs), and more particularly to writing servo on HDDs.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description which may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor Impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.<br>
[0003] Electronic devices such as computers, laptops, personal video recorders (PVRs), MP3 players, game consoles, set-top boxes, digital cameras, etc., often need to store a large amount of data. Storage devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs) may be used to meet these storage requirements.<br>
[0004] Referring now to FIG. 1, a hard disk drive (HDD) 10 Includes a hard disk assembly (HDA) 50 and a HDA printed circuit board (PCB) 14. The HDA PCB 14 comprises a buffer-module 18 that stores data associated with the control of the HDD 10. The buffer module 18 may employ SDRAM or other types of low latency memory. A processor 22 is arranged on the HDA PCB 14 and performs processing that is related to the operation of the HDD 10.<br>
[0005] A hard disk controller (HDC) module 26 communicates with the buffer module 18, the processor 22, a spindle/VCM (voice coil motor) driver module 30, and an input/output interface module 24. The input/output interface module 24 can be a serial Interface module, a parallel interface module, a serial Advance Technology Attachment (ATA) interface module, a parallel ATA interface module, etc.<br>
[0006] Additionally, the HDC module 26 communicates with a read/write channel module 34. During write operations, the read/write channel module 34 encodes data that is to be written by a read/write device 59. The read/write channel module 34 processes data for reliability using error correction coding (ECC), run length limited coding (RLL), etc.   During read operations, the read/write channel<br><br><br>
WO 2007/097945<br><br>
PCT/US2007/003742<br><br>
module 34 converts an analog output of the read/write device 59 into a digital signal. The digital signal is then detected and decoded using Known techniques to recover the data written on the HDD 10.<br>
[0007] The HDA 50 includes one or more circular recording surfaces called platters 52 that are used to store data The platters 52 Include a magnetic coating for storing data In terms of magnetic fields. The platters 52 are stacked on top of one another in the form of a splndie. The spindle comprising the platters 52 is rotated by a spindle motor 54. Generally, the spindle motor 54 rotates the platters 52 at a fixed speed during read/write operations. The spIndie/VCM driver module 30 controls the speed of the spindle motor 54.<br>
[0008] One or more actuator arms 58 move relative to the platters 52 during read/write operations. The spindle/VCM driver module 30 also controls the positioning of the actuator arm 58 by using mechanisms such as a voice coil actuator, a stepper motor, etc. For example, a voice coil motor (VCM) 57, which Is controlled by the spindle/VCM driver module 30, may be used to control the positioning of the actuator arm 58.<br>
[0009] The read/write device 59 is located near a distal end of the actuator arm 58. The read/write device 59 includes a write element such as an inductor (not shown) that generates a magnetic field. The read/write device 59 also includes a read element (such as a magneto-resistive {MR) element, also not shown) that senses magnetic field on the platters 52. The HDA 50 includes a preamp module 60, which amplifies analog read/write signals.<br>
[0010] When reading data, the preamp module 60 amplifies low-level signals from the read element and outputs the amplified signal to the read/write channel module 34. While writing data, a write current is generated that flows through the write element of the read/wrfte device 59. The write current is switched to produce a magnetic field having a positive or negative polarity. The positive or negative polarity Is stored on the hard drive platters 52 and Is used to represent data.<br>
[0011] Referring now to FIG. 2, data Is typically written on the platters 52 in concentric circles called tracks 70. The tracks 70 are. divided clrcumferentially into multiple sectors 72. A circumferential length 74 of sectors 72 decreases as the diameter of the tracks 70 decreases towards the center of the platters 52.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2007/097945<br><br>
PCT7US2007/003742<br><br>
[0012] Before performing a read/write operation on a sector 72 of a track 70, the read/write device 59 locks onto the track 70 by referring to positioning Information called servo. Servo Is generally .prewritten on the platters 52 and provides the positioning information to allow the read/write device 59 to read and write data at correct locations on the platters 52.<br>
[0013] Data can be correctly read and/or written if servo is written accurately. Traditionally, servo Is prewritten using a special servo writing apparatus when a disk drive is manufactured. The servo writing apparatus typically includes a precision actuator used to position an actuator arm. The servo writing apparatus also typically uses an external clock-head to position servo wedges at a predetermined offset. Accordingly, the servo writing apparatus can be expensive and may increase the cost of manufacturing HDDs.<br>
[0014] Additionally, traditional servo writing methods become less practical as the track density of disk drives Increases. Track density is generally expressed in terms of number of tracks per inch of the platters 52. The track density may Increase due to two reasons: decreasing diameter of platters 52 and increasing storage capacity of disk drives, in recent years, the physical size of disk drives is decreasing, and the storage capacity of disk drives is Increasing. This is because of growing demand for smaller devices such as palmtops, etc., that use disk drives that are compact in size and high in storage capacity.<br>
[0015] Accordingly, HDDs increasingly use self-servo-wrlte (SSW) methods to write their own servo Instead of using external servo writing apparatus. Disk drives that use SSW methods to write servo utilize the same read/write heads that are used to read/write regular data. When writing servo using SSW methods, the heads typically lock onto reference servo sectors (RSS) that are prewritten on the platters 52 either concentrically or in the form o1 spirals.<br>
[0016] Referring now to FIGs. 3A-3B, a SSW module 28 may communicate with the processor 22 and the HDC module 26 as shown in FIG. 3A. The SSW module 28 may generate control signals to write servo on platters 52. For example, the SSW module 28 may generate control commands that control movement of the actuator arm 58 during servo writing. The HDC module 26 and the spindla/VCM driver module 30 may Implement the control commands during SSW. The SSW module 28 may generate a servo pattern that is written on the platters 52 using the reacd/write device 59.   Additionally, the SSW module 28 may utilize the<br><br><br>
WO 2007/097945<br><br>
PCT/US2007/003742<br><br>
processor 22 to verify the servo pattern by performing read-after-write operations, etc.<br>
[0017] During SSW, the platters 52 may rotate In direction A, and the actuator arm 58 may move in direction B as shown In FIG. 3B. A disk drive typically uses motion delimiters called crashstops that prevent the actuator arm 58 from moving beyond safe limits. For example, the VCM 57 causes the actuator arm 58 to move between crashstop 55 and crashstop 53 while the read/write device 59 writes a servo spiral 80 between tracks 70.<br>
[0018] When spirals B0 are written, the actuator arm 58 Is accelerated from a stationary position to a predetermined velocity by applying current to the VCM 57. Spirals 80 are written accurately when the actuator arm 58 moves at the predetermined velocity. Thus, spirals 80 that are written white the actuator arm 58 accelerates may be imperfect, that is, the spirals 80 may have wrong slopes. The portion of platters 52 where spirals 80 are imperfectly written may. be unusable, which may reduce storage capacity of HDDs.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0076] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, Its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term module, circuit and/or device refers to an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. tt should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0077] Imperfections In writing servo spirals during self-servo-write (SSW) may be reduced by quickly accelerating an actuator arm to a predetermined velocity. Referring now to FIGs. 4 and 5, a system 1Q0 for writing servo spirals comprises a SSW module 28, a control module 31, and a voice coll motor (VCM) 57. The SSW module 28 generates servo signals. The SSW module 28 generates a control signal that activates the control module 31 before SSW begins. The control module 31 controls the movement of an actuator arm 58 by controlling the VCM 57 during SSW. A read/write device 59 mounted at a distal end of the actuator arm 58 writes servo spirals based on the servo signals during SSW operations.<br>
[0078] Additionally, the system 100 utilizes a crashstop spring 55-1 to. accelerate the actuator arm 58 to a target velocity. The target velocity is a predetermined velocity of the actuator arm 58 at which the read/write device 59 writes servo spirals on platters.(not shown).<br>
[0079] When activated, the control module 31 initially applies a first current to the VCM 57 so that the actuator arm 58 moves in direction A and presses against the crashstop 55. This compresses the crashstop spring 55-1. Before the read/write device 59 begins to write a servo spiral, the control module 31 discontinues or removes the first current. Simultaneously, the control module 31 applies a second current called a bias current to the VCM 57. The second current biases or moves the actuator arm 58 in direction B, which is opposite of direction A.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/097945<br><br>
PCT/US2007/003742<br><br>
[0080] Discontinuing the first current causes the crashstop spring 55-1 to suddenly decompress or release. The sudden decompression or release of the crashstop spring 55-1 exerts a force on the actuator arm 58. The force quickly accelerates the actuator arm 56 to the target velocity.<br>
[0081] The acceleration generated by the decompression of the crashstop spring 55-1 is generally greater than the acceleration that can be generated by a small bias current. Additionally, the acceleration generated by the decompression of the crashstop spring 55-1 Is generally more controlled than the acceleration that may be produced by a large bias current. That is, a bias current that may generate acceleration similar to the acceleration generated by the decompression of the crashstop spring 55-1 may create mechanical and thermal transients, which may degrade repeatability of motion of the actuator arm 58 over time.<br>
[0082] After the actuator arm 58 has accelerated to the target velocity, the bias current continues to move the actuator arm 58 at the target velocity. The bias current is predetermined to provide approximately zero net acceleration at a given radius. The read/write device 59 writes servo spirals while the actuator arm 58 quickly accelerates and subsequently continues to move at the target velocity.<br>
[0083] Since the actuator arm 58 quickly accelerates to the target velocity, the read/write device 59 can begin writing perfect spirals close to the crashstop 55. That Is, the read/write device 59 can begin writing perfect spirals close to the crashstop 55 when crashstop spring 55-1 is used to accelerate the actuator arm 58. Consequently, the area on the platters 52 (not shown) that may be usable due to perfectly written spirals is increased.<br>
[0084] Accelerating the actuator arm 58 to the target velocity using the crashstop sprfng 55-1 cap be mathematically explained as follows. The crashstop spring 55-1 acts as a linear spring. When the control module 31 applies the first current, the actuator arm 58 compresses the crashstop spring 55-1. The crashstop spring 55-1 stores energy Es.<br>
[0085] When the control module 31 discontinues the first current, the crashstop spring 55-1 decompresses. The energy stored In the crashstop spring 55-1 Is converted into kinetic energy Ek. Additionally, the control module 31 simultaneously applies the bias current to the VCM 57, which moves the actuator<br><br><br>
WO 2007/097945<br><br>
PCT/US2007/003742<br><br>
arm 5B in the opposite direction. The kinetic energy Ek, when applied to the actuator arm 58, accelerates the actuator arm 58 to trie target velocity.<br>
[0086] Let (compression denote the first current in Amperes that Is used to compress the crashstop spring 55-1. Additionally, tet Kspring denote a spring constant of the crashstop spring 55-1 in Newton-Meters, and let K, denote a force constant of the VCM 57 In Newton-Meters/Amperes. A compression distance x by which the crashstop spring 55-1 is compressed when the first current Icompre^ion is applied to the VCM 57 Is calculated using the following equation.<br>
Spring Force = X * Kspring = ^ * Icompression<br>
Solving the equation for x, we get<br>
X = (K| / Kspring)    IcompreasJon<br>
[0087] According to the law of conservation of energy, energy EB stored in the crashstop spring 55-1 is equal to kinetic energy Ek generated by the decompression of the crashstop spring 55-1 when the control module 31 discontinues the first current Icompression- Energy EB stored in the crashstop spring 55-1 Is given by Ea = (x2 * Kspnng)/2. The kinetic energy Ek generated by the decompression of the crashstop spring 55-1 is given by Ek = (w2 * J)/2, where w is an angular velocity of the actuator arm 58 in radians/second, and J is moment of inertia of the actuator arm 58.<br>
[0088] E8 = Ek gives (x2 * Kepung/2 = (w2 * J)/2. Solving the equation for w, we get<br><br>
From the angular velocity w, the linear velocity of the actuator arm 58 is given by the following equation.<br>
Linear velocity = w * (Radius of read/write head) Thus, the actuator arm 58 can be accelerated to a target velocity w by applying a first current equal to loompresston-<br>
[0089] Crashstop springs 55-1 are typically designed for a specified amount of compressibility. Thus, spring force of crashstop springs 55-1 is knowable. Therefore, we can apply a known spring force to crashstop springs 55-1 based on a predetermined (intended) target velocity of the actuator arm 58. That is,<br><br>
13<br><br>
WO 2007/097945<br><br>
PCT/US2007/003742<br><br>
the control module 31 can apply a proper value of first current Icompression to the VCM 57 when compressing the crashstop spring 55-1 to achieve the predetermined target velocity of the actuator arm 58. In other words, the control module 31 can control the target velocity of the actuator arm 58 by controlling the value of the first current<br>
■compression*<br>
[0090] The spring constant Kspring of the crashstop spring 55-1 partly determines the accuracy with which the first current compression will generate a predetermined target velocity of the actuator arm 58. Therefore, calibrating the spring constant Kspring may improve the accuracy of the system 100.<br>
[0091] The spring constant KSPRING may be estimated by measuring an offset d between a write element 59-1 and a read element 59-2 In terms of current that compresses the crashstop spring 55-1 by a known value of d, In case where read and write elements are In line. Suppose the write element 59-1 and the read element 59-2 are oriented or positioned on the read/write device 59 in the order shown in FIG. 5. In that case, the control module 31 initially applies a test current to the VCM 57 so that the actuator arm 5B moves slightly in direction A and lightly compresses the crashstop spring 55-1. The write element 59-1 writes a sample pattern 70 on a platter 52 {not shown). Thereafter, the control module 31 increases the test current until the read element 59-2 moves to a position on the platter 52 where the read element 59-2 can read the sample pattern 70.<br>
[0092] The offset d between the write element 59-1 and the read element 59-2 is generally a known design parameter specified by a manufacturer of the read/write device 59. Thus, the increase In the test current that produces a compression equal to d in the crashstop spring 55-1 provides a reasonable approximation of the spring constant Kspring of the crashstop spring 55-1.<br>
[0093] Based on the approximation, the control module 31 accurately calculates the value of the first current Icompression with which to compress the crashstop spring 55-1. When the first current Icompression thus calculated is applied and discontinued, the force exerted by the decompressing crashstop spring 55-1 on the actuator arm 58 may be sufficient to accelerate the actuator arm 58 to a predetermined target velocity.<br>
[0094] Referring now to FIG. 6, a graph of compression of the crashstop spring 55-1 is shown as a function of compression current lcompression.  Specifically,<br><br><br>
WO 2007/097945<br><br>
PCT/US2007/003742<br><br>
the graph shows three plots. Each plot shows a different measurement taken for the system 100. The graph indicates sufficient linearity of the crashstop spring 55-1.<br>
[0095] Referring now to FIG. 7, a graph of actuator velocity is shown as a function of time. For example, a target velocity of 20 tracks per sample is achieved tn approximately 250 time units as shown at 110 in plot 1 when only bias current is used to accelerate the actuator arm 58. On the other hand, the target velocity of 20 tracks per sample is achieved In approximately 50 time units as shown at 112 in plot 2 when spring force of crashstop spring 55-1 is used in addition to the bias current to accelerate the actuator arm 58. As can be appreciated, the actuator arm 58 accelerates to the target velocity much faster when spring force Is used than when spring force is not used.<br>
[0096] Since spirals may be written from Inner to outer diameters of platters 52 and/or vice versa, the system 100 may be implemented using springs of inner and/or outer crashstops. Additionally, the system 100 may be implemented by a hard disk controller (HDC) module that is arranged on a hard disk drive assembly (HDA) printed circuit board (PCB). Alternatively, the system 100 may be implemented by one or more modules arranged on a HPA.<br>
[0097] Referring now to FIG. 8, a method 200 for writing servo spirals begins at step 202. A control module 31 determines in step 203 whether a SSW module 26 generated a control signal to indicate beginning of SSW. If false, the control module 31 waits, if true, the control module 31 compresses a crashstop spring 55-1 in step 204 by applying a predetermined first current to a voice ceil motor (VCM) 57 so that an actuator arm 58 compresses a crashstop spring 55-1.<br>
[0098] The control module 102 discontinues the first current in step 208, and simultaneously applies a second (bias) current to the VCM 57 so that the actuator arm 58 moves in the opposite direction, and the crashstop spring 55-1 decompresses. The force of the decompressing crashstop spring 55-1 accelerates the actuator arm 58 to a target velocity. The read/write head 59 mounted on the actuator arm 58 writes a spiral in step 210 while the actuator arm 58 accelerates and subsequently moves at the target velocity.<br>
[0100] The control module 102 determines in step 212 if alI spirals are written. If false, steps 204 through 212 are repeated. Otherwise, the method 200 ends In step 212<br><br><br>
WO 2007/097945<br><br>
PCT/US2007/003742<br><br>
[0101] Referring now to FIG. 9, a method 250 for calibrating a spring constant of a crashstop spring 55-1 begins at step 252. A control module 31 lightly compresses the crashstop spring 55-1 in step 254 by applying a small test current to a voice coll motor (VCM) 57 that drives an actuator arm 58. While the actuator arm 58 lightly compresses the crashstop spring 55-1, a write element 59-1 writes a sample pattern on a platter 52 in step 258.<br>
[0102] The control module 31 begins increasing the test current in step 260. The control module 31 increases the test current until the read element 59-2 can read the sample pattern in step 260. The control module 31 estimates the spring constant in step 262 based on the increase in test current that compresses the crashstop spring 55-1 by a known offset between the write element 59-1 and the read element 59-2. The control module 31 determines a first current In step 264 that can generate a compression sufficient to accelerate the actuator arm 58 to a predetermined target velocity upon decompression.<br>
