COLORANTS FOR USE IN TINTED CONTACT LENSES<br>
AND METHODS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to colorants useful in the production of tinted contact<br>
lenses. In particular, the invention provides a one step process for tinting contact<br>
lenses and colorants for use in the process.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of tinted contact lenses to alter the natural color of the iris is well<br>
known. Generally, the tinted portion of the lens is located in the center of the lens,<br>
the portion of the lens that will overlay either or both the pupil and iris of the lens<br>
wearer. It is also well known in the tinting of contact lenses that the entire lens may<br>
be lightly tinted as a visibility or locator tint.<br>
Colorants used to produce tinted lenses generally are composed of a binding<br>
polymer and pigments. The known colorants require the use of crosslinking agents<br>
to form covalent bonds between the lens materials and the binding polymer in order<br>
to form stable, tinted lenses. By "stable, tinted lenses" is meant that the tints do not<br>
bleed or leach out from the lens or from one portion of the lens to another.<br>
Additionally, in some of the known methods for forming tinted lenses, it is required<br>
that the lens body be formed prior to the introduction of the colorant onto the lens.<br>
Other processes and colorants require multiple steps for use alone or in conjunction<br>
with specialized rings to protect the outer portions of the lens from the colorant.<br>
Thus, the known colorants and processes for producing tinted lenses<br>
introduce one or both of additional time and additional materials into the normal lens<br>
manufacturing process. Therefore, a need exists for a colorant, and method for<br>
producing contact lenses using the colorant, that eliminate some or all of these<br>
disadvantages.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention and Preferred Embodiments<br>
The invention provides colorants for use in the manufacture of tinted contact<br>
lenses, and a method for the tinting of contact lenses using the colorants of the<br>
invention. When the colorants of the invention are applied to uncured lens material<br>
that is subsequently cured, the binding polymer forms an interpenetrating polymer<br>
network with the lens material. Thus the colorant becomes embedded within the lens<br>
material resulting in a stable, tinted lens. This is advantageous in that the colorants<br>
do not require the use of covalent bonds to aid in the entrapment of the colorant's<br>
pigment within the lens. Further, the colorants of the invention transfer from a mold<br>
surface to the lens material in a way that results in a finished lens with a high<br>
resolution image of the pattern printed using the colorant.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a colorant for use in tinting<br>
contact lenses, the colorant comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of:<br>
one or more pigments, one or more solvents, and a binding polymer, wherein the<br>
binding polymer is capable of forming an inte(penetrating polymer network with a<br>
lens material. In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for<br>
manufacturing a tinted contact lens comprising, consisting essentially of, and<br>
consisting of the steps of: a.) applying to a molding surface of a mold a tinting-<br>
effective amount of a colorant, the colorant comprising, consisting essentially of, and<br>
consisting of: one or more pigments, one or more solvents and a binding polymer; b.)<br>
dispensing a lens-forming amount of a lens material into the mold; c.) swelling the<br>
colorant in the lens material and diffusion of the lens material into the colorant; and<br>
d.) curing the lens material in the mold under conditions suitable to form the tinted<br>
contact lens, wherein the binding polymer and the lens material form an<br>
interpenetrating polymer network. In yet another embodiment, the invention<br>
provides a mold for use in manufacturing a tinted contact lens comprising, consisting<br>
essentially of, and consisting of a first and second mold half, wherein at least one<br><br>
molding surface of the first and second mold halves comprises, consists<br>
essentially of, and consists of: one or more pigments, one or more solvents, and a<br>
binding polymer, wherein the binding polymer is capable of forming an<br>
interpenetrating polymer network with a lens material.<br>
For purposes of the invention, 'interpenetrating polymer network" or " IPN"<br>
is defined as the combination of two or more independent polymers in which one<br>
polymer is synthesized and/or cross-linked in the presence of the other. Thus, some<br>
degree of interpenetration occurs within the network structures. Typically, the<br>
independent polymers used to form the IPN are in network form. One type of IPN,<br>
specifically a semi-IPN, is composed of one or more polymers that are cross-linked<br>
and one or more polymers that are not substantially cross-linked as disclosed by<br>
"Interpenetrating Polymer Networks: An Overview" by Sperling,L.H. in<br>
Interpenetrating Polymer Networks, Edited by Klempner, Sperling, and Utracki, pp<br>
3-6(1994). For purposes of the invention, the type of interpenetrating polymer<br>
network used is a semi-IPN. In one embodiment, the semi-IPN is formed using a<br>
lens material, which is crosslinked and a binding polymer which is not substantially<br>
crosslinked. For the puiposes of this invention not substantially crosslinked means<br>
that the non-crosslinked material is not subjected to conventional crosslinking<br>
conditions prior to contact with the lens material. Semi-IPNs may be formed in one<br>
step, or in a series of steps, which are known as sequential semi-IPNs. One of<br>
ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that, the presence of cross-linking agents,<br>
either through addition or as impurities, can create a reaction environment that favors<br>
the formation of a sequential interpenetrating polymer network.<br>
For puiposes of the invention, by "molding surface" is meant a mold surface<br>
used to form a surface of a lens.<br>
It is a discovery of the invention that by using a binding polymer that is<br>
capable of forming an interpenetrating polymer network with a lens material, the<br>
need for formation of covalent bonds between the colorant and lens material to form<br><br>
a stable, tinted lens is eliminated.	Stability of the tinted lens is provided by<br>
entrapment of the pigments within entanglements of the binding polymer and the<br>
lens base polymer. The binding polymers of the invention are made from a<br>
homopolymer or copolymer, or combinations thereof, having similar solubility<br>
parameters to each other and the binding polymer has similar solubility parameters to<br>
the lens material. These binding polymers may contain functional groups that render<br>
the polymers and copolymers of the binding polymer capable of interactions with<br>
each other. The functional groups must be such that the groups of one polymer or<br>
copolymer interact with that of another in a manner that increases the density of the<br>
interactions helping to inhibit the mobility of and/or entrap the pigment particles.<br>
The interactions between the functional groups may be polar, dispersive, or of a<br>
charge transfer complex nature. The functional groups may be located on the<br>
polymer or copolymer backbones or be pendant from the backbones.<br>
For example, a monomer, or mixture of monomers, that form a polymer with<br>
a positive charge may be used in conjunction with a monomer or monomers that<br>
form a polymer with a negative charge to form the binding polymer. As a more<br>
specific example, methacrylic acid ("MAA") and 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate<br>
("HEMA") may be used to provide a MAA/HEMA copolymer that is then mixed<br>
with a HEMA/3-(N, N-dimethyl) propyl acrylamide copolymer to form the binding<br>
polymer.<br>
As another example, the binding polymer may be composed of<br>
hydrophobically-modified monomers including, without limitation, amides and esters<br>
of the formula:<br>
CH3(CH2 )x-L-COCHR=CH2<br>
wherein L may be -NH or oxygen, x may be a whole number from 2 to 24, R may be<br>
a C1 to C6 alkyl or hydrogen and preferably is methyl or hydrogen. Examples of<br>
such amides and esters include, without limitation, lauryl methacrylamide, and hexyl<br><br>
methacrylate. As yet another example, polymers of aliphatic chain extended<br>
carbamates and ureas may be used to form the binding polymer.<br>
Preferred binding polymers of the invention are a random block copolymer of<br>
HEMA, MAA and lauryl methacrylate ("LMA"), a random block copolymer of<br>
HEMA and MAA or HEMA and LMA, or a homopolymer of HEMA. The weight<br>
percentages, based on the total weight of the binding polymer, of each component in<br>
these embodiments is about 93 to about 100 weight percent HEMA, about 0 to about<br>
2 weight percent MAA, and about 0 to about 5 weight percent LMA.<br>
The molecular weight of the binding polymer must be such that it is<br>
somewhat soluble in the lens material and swells in it. The lens material diffuses<br>
into the binding polymer and is polymerized and/or cross-linked. However, at the<br>
same time, the molecular weight of the binding polymer cannot be so high as to<br>
impact the quality of the printed image. Preferably, the molecular weight of the<br>
binding polymer is about 7,000 to about 100,000, more preferably about 7,000 to<br>
about 40,000, most preferably about 17,000 to about 35,000 Mpcak which corresponds<br>
to the molecular weight of the highest peak in the SEC analyses ( = (Mn x Mw)½)<br>
For purposes of the invention, the molecular weight is determined using a gel<br>
permeation chromatograph with a 90° light scattering and refractive index detectors.<br>
Two columns of PW4000 and PW2500, a methanol-water eluent of 75/25 wt/wt<br>
adjusted to 50mM sodium chloride and a mixture of polyethylene glycol and<br>
polyethylene oxide molecules with well defined molecular weights ranging from<br>
325,000 to 194 are used.<br>
One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that, by using chain transfer<br>
agents in the production of the binding polymer, by using large amounts of initiator,<br>
by using living polymerization, by selection of appropriate monomer and initiator<br>
concentrations, by selection of amounts and types of solvent, or combinations<br>
thereof, the desired binding polymer molecular weight may be obtained. Preferably,<br><br>
a chain transfer agent is used in	conjunction with an initiator, or more<br>
preferably with an initiator and one or more solvents to achieve the desired molecular<br>
weight. Alternatively, small amounts of very high molecular weight binding<br>
polymer may be used in conjunction with large amounts of solvent to maintain a<br>
desired viscosity for the binding polymer. Preferably, the viscosity of the binding<br>
polymer will be about 4,000 to about 15,000 centipoise at 23° C.<br>
Chain transfer agents useful in forming the binding polymers used in the<br>
invention have chain transfer constants values of greater than about 0.01, preferably<br>
greater than about 7, and more preferably greater than about 25,000.<br>
Suitable such chain transfer agents are known and include, without limitation,<br>
aliphatic thiols of the formula R-SH wherein R is a C1 to C12 aliphatic, a benzyl, a<br>
cyclicalipahtic or CH3(CH2)X-SH wherein x is 1 to 24, benzene, n-butyl chloride, t-<br>
butyl chloride, n-butyl bromide, 2-mercapto ethanol, 1-dodecyl mercaptan, 2-<br>
chlorobutane, acetone, acetic acid, chloroform, butyl amine, triethylamine, di-n-butyl<br>
sulfide and disulfide, carbon tetrachloride and bromide, and the like, and<br>
combinations thereof. Generally, about 0 to about 7 weight percent based on the<br>
total weight of polymer formulation will be used. Preferably dodecanethiol,<br>
decanethiol, octanethiol, or combinations thereof is used as the chain transfer agent.<br>
Any desirable initiators may be used including, without limitation, ultra-<br>
violet, visible light, thermal initiators and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Preferably, a thermal initiator is used, more preferably 2,2-azobis isobutyronitrile and<br>
2,2-azobis 2-methylbutyronitrile. The amount of initiator used will be about 0.1 to<br>
about 5 weight percent based on the total weight of the formulation. Preferably, 2,2-<br>
azobis 2-methylbutyronitrile is used with dodecanethiol.<br>
The binding polymers of the invention may be made by any convenient<br>
polymerization process including, without limitation, radical chain polymerization,<br>
step polymerization, emulsion polymerization, ionic chain polymerization, ring<br>
opening, group transfer polymerization, atom transfer polymerization, and the like.<br><br>
Preferably, a thermal-initiated, free-	radical polymerization is used.<br>
Conditions for carrying out the polymerization are within the knowledge of one<br>
ordinarily skilled in the art.<br>
Solvents useful in the production of the binding polymer are medium boiling<br>
solvents having boiling points between about 120 and 230 ° C. Selection of the<br>
solvent to be used will be based on the type of binding polymer to be produced and<br>
its molecular weight. Suitable solvents include, without limitation, diacetone<br>
alcohol, cyclohexanone, isopropyl lactate, 3-methoxy 1-butanol, l-ethoxy-2-<br>
propanol, and the like.<br>
The binding polymer of the invention is tailored, in terms of expansion factor<br>
in water, to the lens material with which it will be used. Matching or substantially<br>
matching the expansion factor of the binding polymer with that of the cured lens<br>
material in packing solution avoids the development of stresses within the lens that<br>
result in bad optics and lens parameter shifts. Additionally, the binding polymer<br>
must be swellable in the lens material, permitting swelling of the image printed using<br>
the colorant of the invention. Due to this swelling, the image becomes entrapped<br>
within the lens material without any impact on lens comfort.<br>
Pigments useful with the binding polymer in the colorants of the invention<br>
are those organic or inorganic pigments suitable for use in contact lenses, or<br>
combinations of such pigments. The opacity may be controlled by varying the<br>
concentration of the pigment and opacifying agent used, with higher amounts<br>
yielding greater opacity. Illustrative organic pigments include, without limitation,<br>
pthalocyanine blue, pthalocyanine green, carbazole violet, vat orange # 1, and the<br>
like and combinations thereof. Examples of useful inorganic pigments include,<br>
without limitation, iron oxide black, iron oxide brown, iron oxide yellow, iron oxide<br>
red, titanium dioxide, and the like, and combinations thereof. In addition to these<br>
pigments, soluble and non-soluble dyes may be used including, without limitation,<br><br>
dichlorotriazine and vinyl sulfone-based dyes. Useful dyes and pigments are<br>
commercially available.<br>
Coating, or wetting, of the pigment particles with binding polymer provides<br>
better dispersion of the pigment particles in the bulk binding polymer. The coating<br>
may be achieved by use of electrostatic, dispersive, or hydrogen bonding forces to<br>
cover the pigment's surface. Preferably, a high shear force is used to disperse the<br>
pigment into the binding polymer. The pigment may be added to the binding<br>
polymer by dispensing the polymer and pigment into a suitable mixer, such as a<br>
rotary shaft mixer and mixing until a homogeneous mixture results, typically for a<br>
period of up to about 30 minutes. The mixture may be then fed into a high shear<br>
mill, such as an Eiger mill to disperse the pigment into the binding polymer.<br>
Repeated milling is carried out as necessary to achieve complete dispersion.<br>
Generally, milling is carried out until the pigments are about 0.2 to about 3 microns<br>
in size. Milling may be carried out using any suitable, commercially available device<br>
including, without limitation, a high shear or ball milling device.<br>
In addition to the pigment and binding polymer, the colorant of the invention<br>
contains one or more solvents that aid in coating of the colorant onto a surface. It is<br>
another discovery of the invention that, to ensure a colorant that does not bleed or<br>
run on the surface to which it is applied, it is desirable, and preferred, that the<br>
colorant have a surface tension below about 27 mN/m. This surface tension may be<br>
achieved by treatment of the surface, for example a mold surface, to which the<br>
colorant will be applied. Surface treatments may be effected by methods known in<br>
the art, such as, but not limited to plasma and corona treatments. Alternatively, and<br>
preferably, the desired surface tension may be achieved by the choice of solvents<br>
used in the colorant.<br>
Thus, the solvents useful in the colorant of the invention are those solvents<br>
that are capable of increasing or decreasing the viscosity of the colorant and aiding in<br>
controlling the surface tension. Suitable solvents include, without limitation,<br><br><br>
cyclopentanones, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, l-methoxy-2-propanol, l-ethoxy-2-<br>
propanol, isopropyl lactate and the like and combinations thereof. Preferably, 1 -<br>
ethoxy-2-propanol and isopropyl lactate are used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, at least three different solvents are used in the<br>
colorant of the invention. The first two of these solvents, both medium boiling point<br>
solvents, are used in the production of the binding polymer. Although these solvents<br>
may be stripped from the binding polymer after its formation, it is preferred that they<br>
are retained. Preferably, the two solvents are 1 -ethoxy-2-propanol and isopropyl<br>
lactate. An additional low boiling solvent, meaning a solvent the boiling point of<br>
which is between about 75 and about 120° C, is used to decrease the viscosity of the<br>
colorant as desired. Suitable low boiling solvents include, without limitation, 2-<br>
propanol, l-methoxy-2-propanol, 1-propanol, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Preferably, 1-propanol is used.<br>
The specific amount of solvents used will depend on a number of factors. For<br>
example, the amount of solvents used in forming the binding polymer will depend<br>
upon the molecular weight of the binding polymer desired and the constituents, such<br>
as the monomers and copolymers, used in the binding polymer. The amount of low<br>
boiling solvent used will depend upon the viscosity and surface tension desired for<br>
the colorant. Further, if the colorant is to be applied to a mold and cured with a lens<br>
material, the amount of solvent used will depend upon the lens and mold materials<br>
used and whether the mold material has undergone any surface treatment to increase<br>
its wettability. Determination of the precise amount of solvent to be used is within<br>
the skill of one ordinarily skilled in the art. Generally, the total weight of the<br>
solvents used will be about 40 to about 75 weight percent of solvent will be used.<br>
One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that each pigment used will<br>
have a critical pigment volume for the solvents selected. The critical pigment<br>
volume may be determined by any known means and, generally, is a volume based<br>
on the efficiency of a solvent and the binding polymer to suspend the pigment<br><br>
particles for example, as disclosed in	Patton, Temple C, Paint Flow and<br>
Pigment Dispersion, 2d ed., pp 126-300 (1993).<br>
In addition to the solvents, a plasticizer may be and, preferably is, added to<br>
the colorant to reduce cracking during the drying of the colorant and optical mold<br>
parts, to enhance the final quality of the image produced using the colorant, and to<br>
enhance the diffusion and swelling of the colorant by the lens material. The type and<br>
amount of plasticizer used will depend on the molecular weight of the binding<br>
polymer used and, for colorants placed onto molds that are stored prior to use, the<br>
shelf-life stability desired. Useful plasticizers include, without limitation, glycerol,<br>
propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 200,<br>
400, or 600, and the like and combinations thereof. Preferably, glycerol is used.<br>
Amounts of plasticizer used generally will be 0 to about 10 weight percent based on<br>
the weight of the colorant.<br>
The opacity of the colorant may be controlled by varying the pigment<br>
concentration and the pigment particle size used. Alternatively, an opacifying agent<br>
may be used. Suitable opacifying agents, such as for example titanium dioxide or<br>
zinc oxide, are commercially available.<br>
In a preferred colorant mixture of the invention, about 0.2 to about 25 weight<br>
percent of pigment, about 30 to about 45 weight percent of binding polymer, about<br>
40 to about 70 weight percent of solvents, about 0 to about 25 weight percent of<br>
titanium dioxide, and about 0.2 to about 7 weight percent of plasticizer is used. The<br>
weight percentages are based on the total weight of the colorant mixture.<br>
The binding polymer may be loaded with about 0.2 to about 25 weight<br>
percent based on the weight of the colorant for organic pigments and about 0.2 to<br>
about 50 weight percent for inorganic pigments. However, high pigment<br>
concentrations may impart a very dark hue. Therefore, preferably about 0.2 to about<br>
7 weight percent of organic pigments and about 0 to about 20 weight percent of<br><br>
inorganic pigments are used.	Combinations of pigments may be used<br>
in ratios dependent upon the color, shade, and hue desired.<br>
One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that additives other than those<br>
discussed also may be included in the colorant composition of the invention.<br>
Suitable additives include, without limitation, additives that aid flow and leveling,<br>
additives for foam prevention, additives for rheology modification, and the like, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
The colorant of the invention becomes embedded in the lens material upon<br>
curing of the material. Thus, the colorant may embed closer to the front or back<br>
surface of the lens formed depending on the surface of the mold to which the lens the<br>
colorant is applied. Additionally, one or more layers of colorant may be applied in<br>
any order. In yet another embodiment, a clear binding polymer layer may be used in<br>
conjunction with the colorant. For example, in the method of the invention a clear<br>
binding polymer layer may be applied to the molding surface of a mold half prior to<br>
application of the colorant. The clear binding polymer may be the same or different<br>
from the binding polymer used for the colorant layers. If the clear binding polymer<br>
is different from the binding polymer, it must be compatible with the binding<br>
polymer and lens material in terms of expansion factor and swellability and it must<br>
be capable of swelling into the lens material.<br>
The invention may be used to provide tinted hard or soft contact lenses made<br>
of any known lens material, or material suitable for manufacturing such lenses.<br>
Preferably, the lenses of the invention are soft contact lenses having water contents<br>
of about 0 to about 90 percent. More preferably, the lenses are made of monomers<br>
containing hydroxy groups, carboxyl groups, or both or be made from silicone-<br>
containing polymers, such as siloxanes, hydrogels, silicone hydrogels, and<br>
combinations thereof. Material useful for forming the lenses of the invention may be<br>
made by reacting blends of macromers, monomers, and combinations thereof along<br>
with additives such as polymerization initiators. Suitable materials include, without<br><br><br>
limitation, silicone hydrogels made from silicone macromers and hydrophilic<br>
monomers. Examples of such silicone macromers include, without limitation,<br>
polydimethylsiloxane methacrylated with pendant hydrophilic groups as described in<br>

The materials for making the	contact lenses are well known and<br>
commercially available. Preferably, the material used is a HEMA based hydrogel,<br>
more preferably etafilcon A, and the binding polymer is formed from linear random<br>
block copolymers of MAA, HEMA and lauryl methacrylate ("LMA"); linear random<br>
block copolymers of MAA and HEMA; linear random block copolymers of HEMA<br>
and LMA; or a HEMA homopolymer. Etafilcon A, disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,680,336 and 4,495,313 incorporated herein in their entireties by reference,<br>
generally is a formulation of 100 parts by weight ("pbw") HEMA, about 1.5 to about<br>
2.5 pbw MAA, approximately 0.3 to about 1.3 pbw ethylene glycol dimethacrylate.<br>
about 0.05 to about 1.5 pbw 1,1,1 ,-trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, and about<br>
0.017 to about 0.024 pbw of a visibility tint. Preferably etafilcon A is used with a<br>
linear random block copolymer of MAA, HEMA and LMA in a ratio of 0.47 MAA<br>
to 100 HEMA to 4.14 LMA, or with a linear random block copolymer of HEMA<br>
and MAA in a ratio of 99.9 HEMA and 0.1 MAA to 99.5 HEMA and 0.5 MAA.<br>
A tinting-effective amount of the colorant is used which is an amount<br>
sufficient to impart the desired level of tint to the lens to be produced. Generally,<br>
about 0.5 mg to about 4.0 mg of colorant is used per lens.<br>
The colorant used in the lenses of the invention are applied to the lens surface<br>
by any convenient method. In a preferred method of the invention, a thermoplastic<br>
optical mold, made from any suitable material including, without limitation,<br>
polypropylene or polystyrene resin is used. A tinting-effective amount of the<br>
colorant is applied to the desired portion of the molding surface of the mold.<br>
Application may be carried out by any convenient means. Preferably, application is<br>
carried out by pad printing.<br>
A lens-forming amount of a lens material is dispensed into the mold. By<br>
"lens-forming amount" is meant an amount sufficient to produce a lens of the size<br>
and thickness desired. Typically, about 10 to about 40 mg of lens material is used.<br><br><br>
The colorant is swelled in the lens	material. Preferably, the swelling<br>
is carred out under conditions suitable to swell the colorant to about 1 to about 4<br>
times its dried thickness. Typically, such swelling may be achieved in from about 1<br>
to about 30 minutes at about 40 to about 68 °C.<br>
The mold containing the lens material and colorant then is exposed to<br>
conditions suitable to form the tinted lens. The precise conditions will depend upon<br>
the components of the colorant and lens material selected and are within the skill of<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art to determine. Once curing is completed, the lens is<br>
released from the mold and may be equilibrated in a buffered saline solution.<br>
A preferred method of manufacturing a tinted lens is carried out using pad<br>
printing as follows. A metal plate, preferably made from steel and more preferably<br>
from stainless steel, is covered with a photo resist material that is capable of<br>
becoming water insoluble once cured. The pattern for the colorant is selected or<br>
designed and then reduced to the desired size using any of a number of techniques<br>
such as photographic techniques, placed over the metal plate, and the photo resist<br>
material is cured. Conditions for carrying out the pattern etching are within the<br>
knowledge of one ordinarily skilled in the art.<br>
Following the pattern, the plate is subsequently washed with an aqueous<br>
solution and the resulting image is etched into the plate to a suitable depth, for<br>
example about 20 microns. The colorant is then deposited onto the pattern to fill the<br>
depressions with colorant. A silicon pad of a suitable geometry and varying<br>
hardness, generally about 1 to about 10 Shore A durometer units, is pressed against<br>
the image on the plate to remove the colorant and the colorant is then dried slightly<br>
by evaporation of the solvent. The pad is then pressed against the molding surface of<br>
an optical mold and the colorant s allowed to dry. The mold is degassed for up to 12<br>
hours to remove excess solvents and oxygen after which the mold is filled with lens<br>
forming amount of a lens material. A complementary mold half is then used to<br><br>
complete the mold assembly and, after the printed image is allowed to swell, the<br>
mold assembly is exposed to conditions suitable to cure the lens material used.<br>
The invention will be clarified further by consideration of the following, non-<br>
limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1-Synthesis of Binding Polymer<br>
To a 5 L glass container was added 2.65 wt percent of dodecanethiol, 1.56 wt<br>
percent lauryl methacrylate, 0.18 wt percent MAA, 37.69 wt percent 2-HEMA, and<br>
42.35 wt percent isopropyl lactate and 10.59 wt percent l-ethoxy-2-propanol as<br>
solvents. The mixture was premixed for 10 min. using a magnetic stirrer and then<br>
transferred to a 5 L stainless steel reactor with a built-in heating mantel and equipped<br>
with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet, reflux condenser, and a temperature sensor.<br>
The mixture was heated to a temperature of approximately 63° C for approximately<br>
25 min, at which point 3.0 wt percent of 2,2-azobis-2-methyl butyronitrile were<br>
added with residual isopropyl lactate. Nitrogen was introduced into the reactor to<br>
create a nitrogen blanket to be used during the remainder of the polymerization.<br>
After approximately 17 to 19 hrs, 1.96 wt percent of glycerol were added to<br>
the reaction mixture and the mixture was stirred for approximately 30 min.<br>
Subsequently, the stirring and nitrogen supply were discontinued and the reaction<br>
mixture cooled to room temperature.<br><br>
Example 2-Synthesis of Binding Polymer<br>
To a 5 L glass container was added 0.69 wt percent of decanethiol, 0.16 wt<br>
percent MAA, 33.55 wt percent 2-HEMA, and 51.1 wt percent isopropyl lactate and<br>
12.8 wt percent 1 -ethoxy-2-propanol as solvents. The mixture was premixed for 10<br>
min. using a magnetic stirrer and then transferred to a 5 L stainless steel reactor with<br>
a built-in heating mantel and equipped with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet,<br>
reflux condenser, and a temperature sensor. The mixture was heated to a temperature<br>
of approximately 68° C for approximately 25 min, at which point 0.20 wt percent of<br>
2,2-azobis-2-methyl butyronitrile were added with residual isopropyl lactate.<br>
Nitrogen was introduced into the reactor to create a nitrogen blanket to be used<br>
during the remainder of the polymerization.<br>
After approximately 17 to 19 hrs, 1.56 wt percent of glycerol were added to<br>
the reaction mixture and the mixture was stirred for approximately 30 min. The<br>
reaction mixture was heated at 80°C for an additional 23 hours in order to decompose<br>
the residual thermal initiator. Subsequently, the stirring and nitrogen supply were<br>
discontinued and the reaction mixture cooled to room temperature.<br>
Example 3<br>
Binding polymers similar to or the same as those of Example 1 were used to<br>
make the colorant formulations listed on the table below.<br><br><br><br>
Example 4<br>
To the binding polymer of Example 1 was added 0.5 wt % of phthalo-cyanine<br>
blue pigment and milled to form a blue colorant. An aliquot of the colorant was then<br>
pad printed onto a contact lens front curve mold and the printed mold was degassed<br>
under vacuum, about 8 hours, in order to remove the volatile solvents from the<br>
colorant. The printed mold was dosed with a reactive monomer mixture containing<br>
100 parts by weight ("pbw") HEMA, about 2 pbw MAA, approximately 0.8 pbw<br>
ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, about 0.1 pbw 1,1,1,-trimethylolpropane<br>
trimethacrylate, about 1 pbw Norbloc® 7966 and about 1.3 pbw Irgacure<br>
(photoinitiator, commercially available from Ciba). A contact lens base curve mold<br>
was deposited onto the filled front curve mold and the two mold halves were pressed<br>
together. A dwell time of approximately two minutes allowed the reactive monomer<br>
mix to diffuse into and around the colorant layer, resulting in the swelling of the<br>
colorant layer. After completion of the dwell time, the mold assembly was exposed<br>
to visible light (approximately 420 nm) for approximately five minutes, whereupon<br>
the reactive monomer mixture was polymerized and cross-linked in and around the<br>
binding polymer of the colorant layer, forming the semi-interpenetrating polymer<br>
network. The mold halves were separated and the tinted lens removed for further<br>
processing steps. Thus, the present example shows that a tinted contact lens may be<br>
formed from a binding polymer, which is not substantially cross-linked and a base<br>
lens material which is cross-linked after diffusing into and around the binding<br>
polymer. Beneficially, the pigments which were mixed into the binding polymer are<br>
fixed in the resultant contact lens without the need for<br>
functionalization or additional bonding steps.<br><br><br>
