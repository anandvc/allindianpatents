METHOD FOR SELECTIVELY PRODUCING PRIMARY AMINE COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for selectively producing a primary amine compound.<br>
Background Art<br>
Hitherto, many selective synthesis methods for primary amine compounds have been reported, and examples thereof include a Gabriel reaction using phthalimide (for example, Non-Patent document 1) and a related reaction thereof (for example, Non-Patent document 2), a Delepine reaction using hexamethylene tetramine (for example, Non-Patent document 3), and the like.' However, these methods are not exactly satisfactory from the industrial viewpoint because they require an expensive aminating agent or a complicated decomposition process.  Although a synthesis method comprising use of ammonia, which is inexpensive, as an aminating agent is industrially useful, the method has difficulty in suppressing production of a secondary amend and requires 20 mol times or more of ammonia for selectively obtaining a primary amine (Patent document 1). Under the circumstances, a .method of suppressing production of a secondary amine using coexistence of aromiatic aldehyde has been proposed (Patent document 2).  However, the method<br><br>
requires separation and recovery of aromatic aldehyde and<br>
therefore, is not satisfactory.<br>

Next, a step of subjecting the hexahydrotriazine compound [2)   thus obtained ro a decomposirion treatment to produce the primiary amine compound represented by the formula (3) (hereinafter referred to as the primary am^ine<br><br>
compound (3)) is explained.<br>
Examples of a method for the decomposition treatment include two methods, namely, a hydrolysis treatment and a hydroxylamine treatment. First, a step of the hydrolysis treatment is described.<br>
In this step, the hexahydrotriazine compound (2) obtained in the preceding step is converted into the primary amine compound (3) by hydrolysis.  This step is usually performed by contacting and mixing the hexahydrotriazine compound (2) with an aqueous solution of an acid.  Examples of the aqueous solution of an acid include an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid or the like.  Preferred is an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid.<br>
The acid concentration of the aqueous solution of an acid is not particularly limited.  The used amount of an acid is usually 1 to 10 moles, preferably 1 to 5 moles per mole of the hexahydrotriazine compound (2).<br>
The hydrolysis trearmen~ may be performed after, as described above, the hexahydrotriazine compound (2) produced in the preceding step is isolated from the reaction liquid.  Alternatively, the reaction liquid or the organic layer containing "he hexahydrotriazine compound (2; may be subjected to the hydrolysis treatment without<br><br>
isolating the hexahydrotriazine compound (2).<br>
The temperature for the hydrolysis treatment is usually 10 to 100Â°C, preferably 25 to 70Â°C.<br>
As the hydrolysis of the hexahydrotriazine compound (2) progresses, formaldehyde is produced as a by-product. For the purpose of facilitating removal of the by-produt formaldehyde, it is preferable that the hydrolysis treatment of the hexahydrotriazine compound (2) is performed in the presence of a lower alcohol compound to perform hydrolysis of the hexahydrotriazine compound (2) and acetalization of the by-product formaldehyde at the same time.  Examples of the lower alcohol compound include lower alcohol compounds having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol or the like.  The amount of the lower alcohol compound is usually 1.5 moles or more, preferably 2 moles or more, more preferably 2.5 moles or more per mole of the hexahydrotriazine compound (2), and there is no upper lim.it of the amount.  In the case where a reaction liquid containing the hexahydrotriazine compound (2) is used as it is and the reaction liquid also contains a lower alcohol compound, the amount of the lower alcohol com.pound that may be used is determined in consideration of the amount of the lower alcohol compound contained in the reaction liquid.  In addition, formialdehyde miay remiain in the reaction liquid in some cases.  In such case, the lower<br><br>
alcohol compound may be used in an amount sufficient to accomplish acetalization of not only the by-product formaldehyde but also the formaldehyde remaining in the reaction liquid.  Of course, the acetalization of formaldehyde may .be performed after the hydrolysis treatment of the hexahydrotriazine compound (2).<br>
After termination of the hydrolysis treatment, the primary amine compound (3) or an acid addition salt thereof can be isolated, for example, by concentration of a reaction liquid.  The primary amine compound (3) can be also isolated by concentrating a reaction liquid, extracting the concentrated reaction liquid with alkaline water and a hydrophobic organic solvent, and then concentrating the obtained organic layer.  Examples of the alkaline water include an aqueous solution of alkali metal hydroxide such as an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, or the like.  The amount of the alkaline water is adjusted so that an aqueous layer can have usually pH 8 to 14, preferably pH 10 to 14 during the extraction treatment.<br>
Then, the step of the hydroxylam.ine trearment is described.<br>
In this step, the hexahydrotriazine compound (2) is treated "with hydroxylarrdne under an acidic condition to produce the primary amine compound (3).  This step is usually performed by contacting and mixing the<br><br>
hexahydrotriazine-compound (2) and hydroxylamine under an acidic condition.<br>
Examples of the hydroxylamine that may be used include hydroxylamine in a free form, and an acid addition salt of hydroxylamine, such as hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NHsOH-HCl), hydroxylamine sulfate ((NH2OH) 2 â€¢ H2SO4) and the like.  Such hydroxylamine is commercially available.  Such hydroxylamine may be used as it is or may be used as a solution such as an aqueous solution.<br>
The amount of the hydroxylamine is usually 1 to 30 moles, preferably 1 to 15 moles, more preferably 1 to 10 moles per mole of the hexahydrotriazine compound (2).<br>
The hexahydrotriazine compound (2) and hydroxylamine are contacted and mixed usually in an aqueous solvent or a mixture of solvents containing water and an organic solvent, under an acidic condition.  The amount of water or a mixrure of solvents containing water and an organic solvent is usually 0.5 to 20 parts by weight per part by weight of the hexahydrotriazine compound (2).  In the case of using a mixture of solvents containing water and an organic solvent, the ratio of water and the organic solvent 1:0 be rriixed is not particularly limited.  Examples of the organic solvent include an aromatic hydrocarbon soivenz such as toluene, xylene or the like; a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene or the like;<br><br>
an ether solvent such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or the like; and an alcohol solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or the like.<br>
Examples of the acid used for the hydroxylamine treatment under an acidic condition include a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or the like; and an organic carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid or the like.  Preferred is mineral acid, and hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid is more preferred.  The amount of the acid that may be used is not particularly limited as long as hydroxylamine and the hexahydrotriazine compound (2) can be contacted and mixed under an acidic condition.<br>
Hydroxylamine may be added to the hexahydrotriazine compound (2), or the hexahydrotriazine compound (2) may be added to hydroxylamine.  The temperature of the hydroxylamine treatment is usually 0 to 10QÂ°C, preferably OC to 50Â°C.<br>
The hexahydrotriazine compound (2) is treated wiuh hydroxylamine under an acidic condition and then, if necessary, kept for a predetermiined period to obtain a solution containing an acid addition salt of the primary amine compound (3) .  The acid addition salt of the primiary am.ine compound (3) can be isolated, for example, by<br><br>
concentration of the solution.<br>
When the hexahydrotriazine compound (2) is treated with hydroxylamine under an acidic condition, formaldoxime or a trimer thereof which is produced by the reaction between the above hydroxylamine and formaldehyde is produced together with an acid addition salt of the primary amine compound (3).  Therefore, it is preferable that the obtained solution containing the acid addition salt of the primary amine compound (3) is subjected to an extraction treatment under a basic condition with, for example, a base and, if necessary, a hydrophobic organic solvent, to separate the solution into an organic layer containing the primary amine compound (3) and an aqueous layer containing formaldoxime or a trimer thereof. ' The organic layer thus obtained can be concentrated to isolate the primary amine compound (3) in higher purity.  The isolated primary amine compound (3) may be converted into an acid addition salt thereof such as a hydrochloride salt by a reaction with an acid such as hydrochloric acid or the like.  Examples of the base include alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide or the like.  The amount of the base is adjusted so rhat an aqueous layer can have usually pH 8 to 14, preferably pH 10 to 14 during the extraction treatmtent. Examples of the hydrophobic organic solvent include an aromiatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene, xylene or the<br><br>
like; a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene or the like; an ester solvent such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate or the like; and a ketone solvent such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or the like, which may be a single solvent or a mixture of solvents.  The amount of the hydrophobic organic solvent is not particularly limited.<br>
Further, the organic layer containing the primary amine compound (3) obtained in the above described extraction treatment is mixed with an aqueous solution of an acid*, and then subjected to a phase separation treatment to obtain an aqueous solution containing an acid addition salt of the primary amine compound (3).  All or a part of the aqueous solution containing an acid addition salt of the primary amine compound (3) can be concentrated to isolate the acid addition salt of the primary amine compound (3).  Alternatively, an insufficient solvent that hardly dissolves the acid addition salt of the priiriary amine compound (3) can be added to the aqueous solution containing an acid addition salt of the primary amine compound (3) to precipitate crystals of the acid addition salt of the primary amine compound (3).  Examples of the aqueous solution of the acid include an aqueous solution of an acid such as hydrochloric- acid, sulfuric acid,-acetic acid, methanesulfonic acid or the like.  The  amount of the<br><br>
aqueous solution of the acid is adjusted so that the aqueous layer can have usually pH 2.5 to 5.5, preferably pH 3 to 5 during the extraction treatment.  In the case where the obtained aqueous solution containing an acid addition salt of the primary amine compound (3) is colored, the aqueous solution may be decolorized by an addition of a decoloring agent such as activated carbon.<br>
Examples of the primary amine compound (3) thus obtained include benzylamine, 2-chlorobenzylamine, 3-chlorobenzylamine, 4-chlorobenzylamine, 2-fluorobenzylamine, 3-fluorobenzylamine, 4-fluorobenzylamine, 2,4-dichlorobenzylamine, 3,4-dichlorobenzylamine, 2,6-dichlorobenzylamine, 2,4-difluorobenzylamine, 3,4-difluorobenzylamine, 2,6-difluorobenzylamine, 4-methylbenzylamine, 4-ethylbenzylamine, 2,4-dimethylbenzylamine, 4-t-butylbenzylamine, 3-methoxybenzylamine, 4-methoxybenzylamiine, 4-cyanobenzylamiine, 3-nitrobenzylamine, 4-N, N-dimethyiamino-3-fluorobenzylamine, 1-aminomethylnaphthalene, 1-aiT.inomethyl-2-miethylnaphthalene, 2-aminomethylnaphthalene, 2-aminomethylpyridine, 3-amLinomiethylpyridine, 4-aminomethylpyridine, 2-chloro-3-aminomethylpyridine, 2-chlcro-4-am:inomethylpyridine, 2-chloro-5-amdnomethylpyridine, 2-chloro-â‚¬-aminomiethylpyridine, 5-chloro-2-amLinomethylpyridine, 3-chloro-4-<br><br>
