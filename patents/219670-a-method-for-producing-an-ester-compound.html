Further, described is a production method of the 3,5-dichloro-4-(3-hydroxypropoxy)-l-substituted-benzenes by making a 3,5-dichloro'4-(3-bromopropoxy)-l-substituted-benzene compound react with benzoic acid and potassium carbonate in the presence of N,N-dimethylformamide to give a 3,5" dichloro-4-(3-benzoyloxypropoxy)"l-substituted"benzene compound and then allowing the product to be hydrolyzed in said publications.<br>
However, the first step that is the reaction of the 3,5-dichloro-4-(3-bromopropoxy)-l-substituted"benzene compound with benzoic acid and potassium carbonate needs N,N-dime thy Iformamide, which is desired to avoid the use of a large amount in an industrial production, as a solvent, (cf. USP-5,922,880, col. 107)    On the other hand, when said reaction is carried out in an aromatic hydrocarbon which is available in an industrial production, it needs a large amount of the solvent because the solubility of the obtained 3,5"dichloro-4"(3-benzoyloxyi)ropoxy)-l"Substituted-benzene compound in the aromatic hydrocarbon is low.    Therefore, it is not beneficial in an industrial production.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide industrially advantageous methods for producing 3,5-dichloro-4-(3-hydroxypropoxy)"l-<br><br>
substituted-benzenes which are useful as intermediates for producing a insecticidal/acaricidal compounds and for producing 3,5-dichloro-4"(3-acetyloxypropoxy)-l-substituted"benzenes which are their precursors.<br>
Summary of the Invention The advantageous method for producing 3,5-dichloro-4-(3-hydroxypropoxy)-l-substituted"benzenes in an industrial production was studied and found that 3,5-dichloro-4"(3-acetyloxypropoxy)-l-substituted-benzenes can be produced by making 3,5"dichloro-4-(3-halopropoxy)"l-substituted-benzenes react with an alkali metal salt of acetic acid in the presence of an aromatic hydrocarbon and that the 3,5-dichloro-4"(3-acetyloxypropoxy)-l-substituted-benzenes can be lead to 3,5-dichloro-4-(3" hydroxypropoxy)-l"Substituted-benzenes.   The method does not need N,N-dimethylformamide as a solvent or a large amount of solvent.<br>
