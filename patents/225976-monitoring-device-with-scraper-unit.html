				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a monitoring device with scraper unit.<br>
In a well-known monitoring device of this type, compressed air is used to<br>
clean the inner end of deposits. If this does not succeed, then either<br>
manual cleaning must take place, which requires switching off the<br>
furnace, or the regulation of the incineration process must get along with<br>
less or - if faults remain undetected - wrong information, in both cases<br>
this leads to additional costs.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of improving a monitoring<br>
device of the initially specified type.<br>
Owing to the fact that the monitoring device is provided with a scraper<br>
unit which keeps the monitoring element on the inner end free from<br>
deposits formed on the wall, the vision of the monitoring element on the<br>
inside of the furnace can be automatically kept free. This increases the<br>
efficiency of the furnace and reduces operating costs. The terms<br>
monitoring device and monitoring element are not limited to the optical<br>
range. Rather, they should also be understood as devices and elements for<br>
other measuring procedures, including automatic flame detectors and<br>
resistance elements.<br>
The scraper unit preferably includes a scraper head that is arranged<br>
between the internal end and the external end when in the initial position,<br>
so that its functionality is protected by the housing. When the scraper unit<br>
is activated, the scraper head is moved by means of a drive along the<br>
housing, in order to clean the monitoring element. For this, the scraper<br><br>
head is preferably at least partially extendable beyond the internal end, in<br>
order to remove the deposits mechanically.<br>
The housing provided for a compact type of construction with<br>
simultaneous integration of the scraper unit preferably consists of a first<br>
housing inside which a second housing is arranged at a distance, the<br>
monitoring element preferably being firmly attached in the second<br>
housing and the scraper head being movably installed between the first<br>
housing and the second housing, in particular being supported on the<br>
second housing. It can be alternatively or additionally supported on the<br>
first housing. Simple geometrical conditions and a simple mounting<br>
option in the wall by drilling result from rotational symmetry, the<br>
monitoring element, the first housing, the second housing and the scraper<br>
head being arranged preferably coaxially to a common axle. The drive,<br>
which is limited to no special drive system, can be act directly on the<br>
scraper head, preferably however to extension rods that can be attached to<br>
the scraper head for extending it in order to save material.<br>
The housing preferably leads compressed air to the internal end, on the<br>
one hand in order to rinse and to cool the monitoring device, on the other<br>
hand to cool down the deposits, so that these are not flexible, but can be<br>
broken off.<br>
Preferably, activation of the scraper unit takes place on a regular basis,<br>
and, in cases when the image processing downstream from the<br>
monitoring element detects a darkening and/or clouding at the internal<br>
end, an extraordinary activation of the scraper unit takes place<br>
additionally, i.e. in either case automatically. This does not exclude<br><br>
manual cleaning. In addition, the information about the activation can<br>
be included into an automatic control loop.<br>
The monitoring device according to the invention with a scraper unit is<br>
preferably used in a furnace of an incineration plant, in which particularly<br>
strong deposits of cinder occur on the wall; however its purpose is not<br>
limited to this.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention is explained in greater detail below by means of an<br>
exemplary embodiment illustrated in the drawing, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a partial section view of the exemplary embodiment with<br>
retracted scraper head, its mobility being indicated by a double<br>
arrow, and<br>
Fig. 2: is a representation according to Fig. 1 with extended scraper head,<br>
in which the wall of the furnace is not indicated.<br>
A furnace 1 of a hazardous waste incineration plant has several openings<br>
on its wall 3, each of which receiving a monitoring device 11. The<br>
portion with the end the monitoring device 11 facing toward the inside of<br>
the furnace 1 is referred to as the internal end I, whereas the portion<br>
facing away from the inside of the furnace is referred to as the external<br>
end E. The monitoring device 11 includes a hollow, circle-cylindrical first<br>
housing 13, which defines an axis A by its geometry, and which is firmly<br>
(and tightly) connected to the wall 3. The axis A runs at least<br><br>
approximally perpendicularly to the wall 3, and horizontally. A radially<br>
projecting first flange 15 is formed onto the first housing 13 at the outer<br>
end E.<br>
The monitoring device 11 further includes a cylindrical second housing<br>
17 of smaller diameter that is coaxial with the first housing and arranged<br>
therein at a radial distance from the wall of the first housing 13. The<br>
second housing 17 is has a hollow wall. At the inner end I, the second<br>
housing 17 is flush with the first housing 13, whereas at the external end<br>
E, there is first a radially extending second flange 19 and followed, in the<br>
axial direction, by a clutch 21. The second flange 19 is fitted closely to<br>
the first flange 15 and is fastened to it for example by a tie-clip<br>
connection of the clutch 21.<br>
Inside the second housing 17, the monitoring device 11 includes a<br>
substantially rotationally symmetrical monitoring element 25 of smaller<br>
diameter that is coaxial to the second housing, in the present case a<br>
boroscope. The monitoring element 25 is arranged at a radial distance<br>
from the wall of the second housing 17 and is firmly attached at both ends<br>
of the second housing 17 by mounting rings or suchlike. The monitoring<br>
element 25 can be connected to a camera arrangement which is arranged<br>
at a distance from the wall 3 of the furnace 1 either directly or by means<br>
of a light conductor. Depending upon the application, various infrared<br>
and/or light-sensitive cameras with high space-, time- or frequency<br>
resolution or simple diodes are provided in the camera arrangement, for<br>
which the monitoring element 25 forms the optical access to the inside of<br>
the furnace 1 and which serve to capture the images of the incineration<br>
process taking place in the furnace I. In the present connection, the term<br><br>
"optical" also relates to radiation beyond both sides the visible range.<br>
For flushing, i.e. for preventing the monitoring element 25, the second<br>
housing 17 and the inside of the first housing 13 from getting dirty, and<br>
also for cooling these parts of the monitoring device 11, compressed air L<br>
is constantly introduced into the monitoring device 11 through a radial<br>
drilling in the first flange 15, said compressed air L being led to the inner<br>
end I through the gap between second housing 17 and first housing 13<br>
and through the hollow wall of the second housing 17. The difference in<br>
pressure to inside the furnace 1 prevents dirt from entering.<br>
The monitoring device 11 has an additional scraper unit 31 which<br>
prevents the inner end I of the monitoring device 11 from getting clogged<br>
by settling cinder due to caking or from losing the view of the inside of<br>
the furnace I for any other mechanical reason. For this, the scraper unit<br>
31 comprises a sleeve-like scraper head 33, which is (axially) moveably<br>
arranged (sliding) in the gap between the second housing 17 and the first<br>
housing 13 and on the second housing 17 parallel to the axle A. The<br>
scraper unit 31 furthermore comprises four extension rods 35 which are<br>
attached, in particular screwed, in axial extension of the scraper head 33<br>
to that front side of the scraper head 33 that is facing toward the outer end<br>
E, and which are guided in supports 37 connected to the second housing<br>
17. In the exemplary embodiment, the extension rods 35 are coupled to<br>
piston rods 39 whose ends, shaped as a piston and facing away from the<br>
extension rods 35, move in cylinders 41 and can be pneumatically<br>
activated. Different drives may also be considered, such as an electric<br>
motor or a hydraulic drive. If necessary, the drives can be provided with<br>
reset springs.<br><br>
7<br>
Cinder is produced in the furnace 1 during the incineration process,<br>
settling on the wall 3 of the furnace 1 and, being soft, running down due<br>
to the force of gravity. It can thus happen that such a cinder deposit<br>
running down reaches the inner end I of the monitoring device 11. Then,<br>
the compressed air L begins to cool the cinder. When the scraper unit 31<br>
is in the initial position, the scraper head 33 is arranged inside the first<br>
housing 13, i.e. at a distance from the inner end of the monitoring device<br>
11. The scraper unit 31 is normally clock operated, i.e. regularly<br>
activated, for instance, every 10 seconds or each minute, with the<br>
activated extension rods 35 extending the scraper head 33 until the latter<br>
reaches beyond the inner end I, and then retracting it again until it reaches<br>
the initial position. Any cinder deposit that reaches the the extending<br>
range of the scraper head 33 is mechanically broken off by this regular<br>
activation of the scraper unit 31.<br>
The image of the inside of the furnace 1 taken by the camera arrangement<br>
of the monitoring device 11 is subjected to an image processing by an<br>
electronic analysis and control device, which takes actions for controlling<br>
the incineration process in the furnace 1 depending on the control targets,<br>
if necessary, i.e. controlling the feeding of the furnace I. If a darkening<br>
from the (upper) edge is detected from the image, the scraper unit 31 is<br>
driven in a specific manner, i.e. the growing cinder deposit is cleared by<br>
an extraordinary activation of the scraper unit 31. If necessary, the<br>
intervals for regular activation of the scraper unit 31 can then be<br>
shortened. If there is no improvement, an alarm is triggered in order to<br>
request manual cleaning, particularly if repeated extraordinary activation<br>
of the scraper unit 31 remains fruitless. The information about the<br><br>
frequency of the activation of the scraper unit 31 is also preferably<br>
used for controlling the incineration process.<br><br>
