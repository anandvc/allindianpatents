"Poloxamer Emulsion Preparations"<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to microemulsions and compositions useful in a variety of pharmaceutical and personal care products and applications. In particular, it provides microemulsions and compositions useful for topical and/or mucosal application of water insoluble or sparingly soluble active agents to oesophageal, otic, vaginal, rectal or ophthalmic surfaces or for application to the epidermis of an animal (such as skin in human) and/or to treat disorders and imperfections of the skin. It also provides a method for making the microemulsions and compositions comprising water insoluble or sparingly soluble active agents.<br>
Background Art<br>
Many of the active agents in pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations comprise oils or are immiscible or insoluble in water. It can be difficult to deliver an effective amount of these active agents in order to provide the desired therapeutic effect, due to their lack of water solubility. It is therefore often desirable to provide such agents in water-based compositions (eg. for oral administration, topical application, intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection etc). One of the methods for preparing such compositions is to form an emulsion.<br>
An emulsion is a heterogeneous system consisting of at least two immiscible liquids (such as a water phase and an oil phase), one of which is dispersed in the other in the form of droplets, with continuous and discontinuous phases. The discontinuous phase is referred to variously as Jhe dispersed or internal phase, whereas the phase in which the dispersion occurs is referred to as the continuous or external phase. When water zs the continuous phase, the emulsion is referred to as oil-in-water (O/W), and when oil is the continuous phase, the emulsion is referred to as water-in-oil (W/O). O/W emulsions are the most frequently used emulsions. However, W/O emulsions are desirable for many applications and would be more extensively used if problems with instability could be overcome.<br><br>
Macroemulsions are defined as being formed by high shear mixing and normally having particles of 1 micron to 10 microns in size. Such emulsions are difficult to achieve and possess minimal stability, as the oil and water components separate into distinct phases over time. In addition, the droplet size of the macroemulsion increases with time. Various methods have been developed to stabilize such emulsions, such as the addition of additives such as emulsifiers and finely divided solids.<br>
In contrast, microemulsion systems consisting of oil, water, and appropriate emulsifiers can form spontaneously (i.e. form with minimal agitation) and are therefore thermodynamically stable. This level of thermodynamic stability is highly desirable, but seldom achieved. Microemulsion systems theoretically have an infinite shelf life under normal conditions without separating, in contrast to the limited life of macroemulsions. In addition, the size of the droplets in such microemulsions remains constant and is typically less than 150 nm (in general between 10-50 nm) and the microemulsion has very low oil/water interfacial tension.<br>
Emulsions such as microemulsions are important for the development of new and effective active agent delivery systems that allow water insoluble or sparingly soluble active agents to be provided in aqueous solutions appropriate for human use. The preparation of such microemulsions represents a major technological hurdle for pharmaceutical delivery systems as one must choose materials that are biocompatible, non-toxic, clinically acceptable and form stable microemulsions.<br>
Furthermore, many of the known emulsion formulations suffer from an inability to ensure a controlled and prolonged release of the active agent at the desired site as they have a very short retention time at the tissue to which they are applied, due to being readily washed away or degraded. This inability is particularly undesirable, since most biologically active agents must remain at the desired site for a prolonged period in order to be effective.<br>
In view of the above, there is a need to provide emulsion formulations for delivery of active agents that are multi-purpose and can be applied to, for example, topical or mucosal tissues.  Such emulsions should preferentially have high bioadhesion<br><br>
capability to ensure contact for a prolonged time. Further they should preferentially be able to carry a high amount of active agent to the site of application for a controlled and prolonged release to the desired tissue.<br>
Although stable emulsion preparations have been described, these compositions typically require the use of high temperatures to melt all ingredients of the oil phase to uniformly disperse the particles of one phase through the particles of the other one. Microemulsions are usually formed at temperatures in excess of 75°C, typically about 90°C, and the composition is then cooled slowly over a period of hours or days to room temperature in order to create the emulsion. For large batches this is a costly and time consuming procedure. There is also the risk that the emulsions will be overheated resulting, for example, in the degradation of<br>
some of the ingredients.<br>
•<br>
Another method by which stable emulsions may be prepared is via the use of surfactants or emulsifiers. Typically, surfactants and emulsifiers for the preparation of emulsions are selected from the group consisting of hydrophilic surfactants and mixtures thereof. To function as a surfactant, a compound must necessarily include polar or charged hydrophilic moieties as well as non-polar lipophilic (hydrophobic) moieties; that is, a surfactant compound must be amphiphilic. An empirical parameter commonly used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance ("HLB" value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. It should be appreciated that the HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial, pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions.<br>
A group of compounds that have been successfully used as surfactants in the production of macro- and microemulsions are the block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, the poloxamers. A number of these compounds have<br><br>
the unusual property that they become liquid when chilled, but harden when warmed, a characteristic known as thermo-reversibility. Such thermo-reversibility is useful in pharmaceutical compounding wherever it is desirable to handle a material in a fluid state, but performance is preferably in a gelled or more viscous state. Such compounds can be drawn into a syringe for accurate dose measurement or easily applied from a bottle or squirted from a dispenser when cold. When the poloxamer warms to body temperature (eg. when applied to skin or mucosal surfaces) it thickens to a suitable consistency to facilitate proper inunction and adhesion.<br>
The desired gelling temperature can be regulated by adjusting the concentration of the block copolymer, with the lower copolymer concentrations giving higher gelling temperatures. Concentrations of the copolymer of at least 18% to 20% by weight are needed to produce a composition which exhibits such a transition at commercially or physiologically useful temperatures. However, it has been found that incorporating high concentrations of copolymer causes the composition to become extremely viscous or "gelatinised" and solutions containing 18%* to 20% by weight of poloxamer typically have high viscosity even in the "liquid" phase, so that these solutions can not function under conditions where low viscosity, free-flowing is required prior to transition. For this reason, typical copolymer emulsions usually contain less than 10% copolymer.<br>
Active Agents<br>
Active agents are chemical materials or compounds which, when administered to an organism (human or animal, generally human) induce a desired pharmacologic effect Many of the active agents in pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations comprise oils or are immiscible or insoluble in water. An example of such an active agent is Tea Tree Oil (TTO).<br>
TTO is isolated by distilling the oil from the stems and leaves of the paperbark tree Melaleuca alternafolia. TTO has medicinal properties including antimicrobial, antiviral anti-inflammatory and antifungal characteristics. Additionally, TTO provides a soothing sensation when in contact with a person's skin. However, the properties of TTO can only be exploited by formulating delivery systems suitable<br><br>
to the various conditions required When TTO products, in the form of aqueous creams, are exposed to air, the TTO component oxidates and some of the chemical components can change their characteristics, affecting the medicament's effectiveness and safety. The presence of many of the emulsifying agents used to solubilize TTO in water also inhibit or inactivate the activity of TTO. As a gel suspension, TTO tends to separate from the gel base formula, particularly when the suspension contains concentrations of TTO higher than 2%, a process accentuated by changes in temperature (eg. temperatures over 30°C) and/or applying physical shear forces, such as kneading the gel suspension.<br>
To deliver an effective amount of TTO, it is desirable to apply the oil in a form that will both remain in contact with the skin for an extended period of time and deliver the highest concentration of TTO possible. Microemulsion formulations are therefore highly desirable as they are thermodynamically stable.<br>
This invention has as its objective the formation of safe and effective pharmaceutical microemulsion delivery systems that can be manufactured without the need for the high temperature preparation. Other aims and aspects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description of the present invention.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
The present invention provides a microemulsion composition comprising at least 10% by weight of a copolymer that preferentially has thermo-reversible properties. Copolymer levels of this magnitude exceed, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, those found in other oil-copolymer based microemulsion. When the copolymer used in the microemulsion is thermo-reversible, oil-copolymer combinations may be prepared at a cold temperature. The applicant has found, however, that the combination of an emulsifier with the oil before addition of the copolymer surprisingly allows the microemulsion to be prepared at a low temperature.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a composition or more specifically a microemulsion for delivery of water-insoluble active agents, comprising: an aqueous component and a non-ionic block copolymer, and at least an oil that is the active agent or has a water-insoluble active agent dissolved therein.<br><br>
Microemulsions as described herein will comprise an amount by weight of block copolymer of about 10% to about 50% by weight, more preferably the amount by weight block copolymer will be between about 10.1% and 40% by weight of the emulsion while an amount by weight of the block copolymer between any of the following ranges will be highly desirable: 10.5% to 35%, 11% to 30%, 12% to 25%, 13% to 20% or 14% to 18% by weight of the emulsion. Thus, as an illustration of the invention, the block copolymer may comprise 15% by weight of the emulsion.<br>
In addition to the block copolymer being present in the aforementioned weight ranges in the microemulsion, it will also desirably be a thermo-reversible copolymer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the microemulsion or composition will possess bioadhesive or mucoadhesive properties. Such properties will be consistent with the microemulsion or composition being prepared in either a liquid or more preferably a gel form. When prepared in this manner the microemulsion or composition will be useful for topical and/or mucosal application of water insoluble or sparingly soluble active agents to oesophageal, otic, vaginal, rectal or ophthalmic surfaces, or for application to the epidermis of an animal (such as skin in human) and/or to treat disorders and imperfections of the skin. Desirably, the microemulsion or composition will either exist as a gel or will be prepared in such a manner that it is capable of gelatinising upon contact with dermal or mucosal tissue.<br>
When.preparing a microemulsion in accordance with the first embodiment of the invention, ideally, the oil and the thermo-reversible copolymer will be mixed at a cold temperature. When this is done at a cold temperature at the weight ranges specified herein the composition forms a stable microemulsion capable of application to dermal or mucosal tissue.<br>
In a second embodiment, the invention provides a composition or more specifically a microemulsion for delivery of water-insoluble active agents, comprising:   an   aqueous  component  and   a   non-ionic  block  copolymer,   a<br><br>
hydrophilic non-ionic short chain fatty acid emulsifier and at least an oil that is the active agent or has a water-insoluble active agent dissolved therein.<br>
When preparing a microemulsion in accordance wfth the second embodiment of the invention, ideally, the oil and the emulsifier will be mixed and then applied to the thermo-reversible copolymer. When this is done at a low temperature at the weight ranges specified herein the composition rapidly forms a stable microemulsion capable of application to dermal or mucosal tissue.<br>
The copolymer for use in the present invention is preferably a block copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (poloxamer) preferably those represented by the formula:<br>
HO(C2H40)a(C3H60)b(C2H40)aH<br>
Where 'b' is between 15 and 67 and 'a' is between 2 and 130, and the total proportion of 'a1 units amounts to from 20% to 90% by weight of the poloxamer. The molecular weight of the poloxamer ranges from preferably about 1,000 to 20,000 and it will preferentially have thermo-reversible properties. By way of example only the block copolymer may be poloxamer 407, such as that sold as Pluronic® F127 (BASF Corporation) or Synperonic PE/F127 (Uniqema).<br>
According to the invention the preferred emulsifier is a fatty acid component with a polyethoxylated side chain. For example, suitable emulsifiers might be Laureth-4, Laureth-9, Laureth-23, PPG-26-Buteth-26/PEG-40 Hydrogenated castor oil or PEG-40 Hydrogenated castor oil. When such emulsifiers are used in the invention the amount by weight of the emulsifier will vary generally from about 0.5% to about 50% by weight of the microemulsion.<br>
The physico-chemical characteristics of the present invention make the microemulsion suitable as a delivery vehicle for water insoluble or sparingly soluble active agents. It is particularly well-suited for transdermal or transmucosal delivery. In this respect the oil phase may comprise oils commonly used in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries for example, oils of natural or synthetic origin, long chain alcohols, glyceryl esters of fatty acids or fatty esters of monohydric alcohols. The esters and alcohols can be straight or branch chained,<br><br>
saturated or unsaturated and liquids at room temperature. The oil phase may also contain active agents that are soluble in or miscihle with the oil phase.<br>
The oil of the present invention may have inherent pharmaceutical properties and constitute the active agent of the microemulsion and/or may contain dissolved active agents that are soluble or miscible in the oil. The active agents may include, but are not limited to, antimicrobials (such as antibiotics, antifungals and antivirals), antiinflammatories, antihistaminics, antidepressants, anaesthetics antineoplastics, enzymes, cardiovascular agents, polynucleotides, genetic material, viral vectors, immunoactive agents, imaging agents, immunosuppressive agents, peptides, proteins etc and combinations thereof. Pharmaceutically effective amounts of the selected active agents may be determined using techniques well known in the art.<br>
Preferentially the amount by weight of the oil used in the microemulsion will comprise from about 0.1% to about 80% by weight of the emulsion, more preferably 1% to 30% by weight of the emulsion, with a range of 3% to 15% by weight of the emulsion being highly desirable. In an illustration of the invention the oil will constitute about 6% of the total weight of the emulsion.<br>
In a highly preferred form of the invention the oil is tea tree oil (TTO). Where the active agent is TTO the microemulsion will have microbicide activity. Such a composition can be used to treat for example; diseases such as sexually transmitted disease (eg. HIV) by vaginal delivery; impetigo and cold sores by topical preparation, elimination of MRSAs by intranasal application and diseases such as otitis media, otitis externa, acne, periodontitis, gingivitis, paronychia, onychomycosis and secondary infections in connection with operations, dermatitis, burns, etc.<br>
According to a third embodiment, the invention provides a method for preparing the microemulsion composition, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) Mixing a copolymer with an aqueous solution at a suitable temperature to substantially dissolve the copolymer in the aqueous solution; and<br><br>
(b) Mixing, at cold temperature, an oil that is the active agent or has a water-insoluble active agent dissolved therein, with the aqueous copolymer solution prepared in'step (a) to form a microemulsion.<br>
According to step (a) in the method the co-polymer is mixed with an aqueous solution at a suitable temperature to substantially dissolve the copolymer in the aqueous solution. Dissolution of the co-polymer with an aqueous solution will occur almost instantaneously at temperatures of around 6°C. Alternatively, the co-polymer may be mixed with the aqueous solution at room temperature if left over night with semi-continuous or continuous stirring.<br>
As used herein "cold temperature" refers to temperatures less than about 15°C, preferably from about 4°C to about 12°C and most preferably less than about 10°C.<br>
According to a fourth embodiment, the invention provides a method for preparing the microemulsion composition, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	Mixing a copolymer with an aqueous solution at a suitable temperature to substantially dissolve the copolymer in the aqueous solution;<br>
(b)	Mixing a hydrophilic, non-ionic short chain fatty acid emulsifier with an oil that is the active agent or has a water-insoluble active agent dissolved therein, at a low temperature to form an oil mixture; and<br>
(c)	Mixing the solution prepared in step (a) with the solution prepared in step (b) at a low temperature to form a microemulsion.<br>
As used herein "Low temperature" refers to temperatures less than about 60°C, preferably from about 15°C to about 40°C, more preferably from about 20°C to about 30°C and most preferably at about room temperature. The ability to manufacture microemulsions of the present invention at these temperatures is highly significant as it provides a distinguishing feature from most other methods of manufacture of microemulsions which demand the microemulsions be made at about 90°C.<br>
It has been found that a microemulsion composition prepared according to the present invention has the surprising feature that the addition of the oil/emulsifier<br><br>
mixture to the aqueous poloxarner solution at room temperature changes the thermo-reversible nature of the poloxarner by altering the temperature at which solidification occurs. This effect is most evident at high ratios of poloxarner to oil.<br>
Microemuision compositions of the present invention provide clear, colourless gels that are particularly well suited to pharmaceutic and personal care applications. For example, very little residue is formed upon dehydration, which may be important in some applications, such as in optically applied pharmaceutics. An additional advantage of the microemuision composition of the invention is that they remain clear and translucent before and after the triggering environmental change. These characteristics of the reversibly gelling microemuision composition make it well suited for use in pharmaceutic compositions.<br>
The practical advantage of this behaviour of the microemuision composition is that the formulation can be administered as a flowing liquid at ambient temperatures. Upon contact with body tissues it viscosifies, thus changing its flow properties, and more importantly, its clearance from the site of application is dramatically reduced.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that microemuision composition of the present invention may be utilized for a wide variety of pharmaceutic and personal care applications. To prepare a pharmaceutic composition, an effective amount of pharmaceutically active agent(s) which imparts the desirable pharmaceutic effect is incorporated into the reversibly gelling composition of the present invention.<br>
When prepared according to the method of the invention the microemuision composition can further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives, excipients carriers and diluents. Such additives, excipients carriers and diluents include, without limitation, water, saline, ethanol, dextrose, glycerol, lactose, dextrose, sucrose sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphates, alginate, tragacanth, gelatine, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose,, water syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl and propylhydroxybenzoates, talc, magnesium stearate and mineral oil or combinations thereof.    The formulations can additionally include  lubricating<br><br>
agents, pH buffering agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents or flavouring agents, antifoaming agents, polymers, antioxidants, chelating agents, viscomoduiators, tonicifiers, flavorants, colorants, odorants, opacifiers, suspending agents, binders, fillers, plasticizers, lubricants, and mixtures thereof. The particular selection of constituent that can be included in the compositions described herein will generally depend on the type of preparation.<br>
In addition, an acid or a base may be incorporated into the microemulsion<br>
composition to facilitate processing, to enhance stability, or for other reasons.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable bases include amino acids, amino acid<br>
esters, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium<br>
hydrogen carbonate, aluminium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium<br>
hydroxide, magnesium aluminium silicate, synthetic aluminium silicate, synthetic<br>
hydrocalcite, magnesium aluminium hydroxide, diisopropylethylamine,<br>

When the hydrophilic active agent is subject to enzymatic degradation, the present compositions can also include an enzyme inhibiting agent. Enzyme inhibiting agents are shown for example, in Bemskop-Schnurch (1998),"The use of inhibitory agents to overcome enzymatic barrier to perorally administered therapeutic peptides and proteins," Controlled Release 52:1-16.<br>
Generally, inhibitory agents can be divided into the following classes: inhibitors that are not based on amino acids (such as P-aminobenzamidine, FK-448, camostat mesylate and sodium glycocholate); amino acids and modified amino acids (such as aminoboronic acid derivatives and n-acetylcysteine); peptides and modified peptides (such as bacitracin, phosphinic acid dipeptide derivatives, pepstatin, antipain, leupeptin, chymostatin, eiastatin, bestatin, hosphoramindon, puromycin, cytochalasin potatocarboxy peptidase inhibitor, and amastatin); polypeptide protease inhibitors (such as aprotinin, Bowman-Birk inhibitor, soybean trypsin inhibitor, chicken egg white trypsin inhibitor, chicken ovoinhibitor, and human pancreatic trypsin inhibitor); complexing agents (such as EDTA, EGTA, 1,10-phenanthroline and hydroxychinoline); and mucoadhesive polymers and polymer-inhibitor conjugates (such as polyacrylate derivatives, chitosan, cellulosics, chitosan-EDTA, chitosan-EDTA-antipain, polyacryJic acid-bacitracin, carboxymethyl cellulose-pepstatin and polyacrylic acid-Bowman-Birk inhibitor). The choice and levels of the enzyme inhibitor are based on toxicity, specificity of the proteases and the potency of inhibition.<br>
A discussion of particular applications and formulations follows.<br>
Esophageal, oral cavity and buccal applications: One indication for the use of this microemulsion composition would be to provide a suitable vehicle for delivering a<br><br>
pharmaceutic effect within the oesophageal lining. In this respect the mucoadhesive properties of the microernulsion composition of the invention make that composition desirable for controlling and facilitating a pharmaceutic effect to the oesophageal lining. The shear sensitivity of the microemulsion composition could also be taken advantage of in applications in which a liquid treatments is sprayed under high shear conditions onto the oral cavity, where the solution adheres and viscosities to provide a reservoir for antibacterial agents, such as chlorohexadine, or a breath freshener.<br>
Ophthalmic applications: Most ophthalmic drugs are applied to the eye, typically to the precorneal area. The most common dosage form is a liquid drop. Drug bioavailability is generally low because liquid formulations are quickly cleared from the eye by tearing and blinking, resulting in the need for frequent dosing and uneven drug delivery.<br>
The microemulsion composition described herein provides a new vehicle for achieving greater bioavailability of topically administered insoluble or partially soluble ophthalmic active agents. Formulations containing such active agents can be applied as drops that viscosity or gel upon contact with eye. Since gelling can be accomplished with low concentrations of the polymer, blurring can be minimized upon drop instillation.<br>
When used in this manner the microemulsion composition would preferentially be used for delivering bioactive materials, such as anaesthetics, mydriatics and cycloplegics, antimicrobial agents (antibacterial, antifungal, antivira)), antiinflammatory agents, agents for the treatment of glaucoma, ocular decongestants, diagnostic agents, and wound healing agents.<br>
Nasal applications: Microemulsion compositions of the invention may also be used for delivery of drugs to the nasal cavity. Nasal drug delivery has been considered as an alternative to parenteral routes of administration of drugs that demonstrate low oral bioavailability. In order to increase the bioavailability of nasally administered drugs, efforts have been made to increase the residence time of formulations in the nasal cavity. Nasal delivery of drugs can offer advantages over other methods of delivery, including rapid systemic absorption,<br><br>
lower dosing, more rapid onset of desired therapeutic effects, and improved pharmacokinetics. In addition, it provides an alternative route for administering peptide drugs, which generally have tow bioavailablity via the oral route and are normally administered parenterally.<br>
Microemulsion composition would potentially be useful for delivering agents such as decongestants, antihistamines, anti-osteoporosis agents, hormones, antineoplastic agents, Parkinsonism drugs, etc. The composition may also be used for the application of vaccines, such as those against the influenza virus.<br>
Vaginal/rectal applications: Microemulsion compositions of the invention are also indicated for the delivery of bioactive agents (such as TTO) to the vaginal or the rectal cavity. These delivery routes have been considered as an alternative to parenteral routes of administration of bioactive agents that demonstrate low oral bioavailability. In order to increase the bioavailability of vaginally or rectally administered bioactive agents, efforts have been made to increase the residence time of formulations in these cavities. These routes offer advantages over other methods of delivery, including rapid systemic absorption, lower dosing, more rapid onset of desired therapeutic effects, and improved pharmacokinetics.<br>
Veterinary applications: Microemulsion compositions of the invention may also be useful in the treatment of not only human conditions but in providing treatments for animal care. For veterinary products, the microemulsion compositions is indicated for the preparation of topical dermal products, such as antibacterials, antifungals, antipruritics, and antiseborrheia, antiodor, and antiseptic/wound healing preparations. Otic products would include ear cleaners with or without actives, such as, antifungals. Ophthalmic products would include eye moisturizers or antimicrobial preparations.<br>
Personal Care Applications: Microemulsion compositions of the invention may also be particularly well suited for cosmetic applications. For example, very little residue is formed upon dehydration, which may be important in some applications, such as in topically applied cosmetics. An additional advantage of the composition of the invention is that it remains clear and translucent above and<br><br>
below the critical temperature or pH These characteristics of the microemulsion compositions make it well suited for use in cosmetic compositions.<br>
To prepare a cosmetic composition, an effective "amount of cosmetically active agent(s) that imparts the desirable cosmetic effect is incorporated into the microemulsion composition of the present invention. Preferably the selected agent lends itself to a homogeneous dispersion through out the microemulsion composition. It is contemplated as within the scope of the invention that the reversibly gelling composition compositions of the present invention may be prepared under sterile conditions.<br>
Exemplary cosmetic and personal care applications, in which the microemulsion composition may be used include, but are not limited to, baby products, bath preparations, eye makeup preparations, fragrance preparations, noncolouring hair preparations, colour cosmetics, hair colouring preparations, makeup preparations, manicuring preparations, oral hygiene products, shaving preparations, skin care preparations, and suntan preparations such as suntan creams, gels and lotions, indoor tanning preparations.<br>
The cosmetic composition may be in any form. Suitable forms include but are not limited to lotions, creams, sticks, roll-ons formulations, mousses, aerosol sprays, pad-applied formulations, and film-forming formulations.<br>
Preparation of the above-named cosmetic compositions and others may be accomplished with reference to any of the cosmetic formulation guidebooks and industry journals which are available in the cosmetic industry.
