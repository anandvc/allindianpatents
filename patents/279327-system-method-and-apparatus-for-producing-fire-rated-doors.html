				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates in general to the field of door manufacturing and, more particularly, to a system, method and apparatus for producing fire rated doors.<br>
Background Art<br>
Many methods and techniques for manufacturing doors have been developed over time. For example, FIGURE 1 shows a typical residential door 100 that is constructed from a set of interlocking perimeter boards 102, 104 and 106, internal boards 108, and panels 110 and 112. In another example, FIGURE 2 shows a fire rated door 200 that is constructed from a mineral core 202 sandwiched between two medium density fiberboards 204 and 206. A perimeter channel 208 extends around the sides of the door assembly. An intumescent banding 210 is sandwiched between a first hardwood insert 212 and a second hardwood insert 214, all of which are disposed in the perimeter channel 208. Many other designs exist<br>
These prior art designs do not lend themselves well to fully automated manufacturing processes. Moreover, the prior art fire rated doors are expensive and require the internal mineral core. The internal core can be exposed in routed details and may reduce the strength of the door as a result of the reduced thickness of the door panels. In addition, alignment of the panels during assembly can be troublesome and require additional finishing to square the door after assembly. As a result, there is a need for a fire rated door that does not suffer from these deficiencies.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a system, method and apparatus for producing fire rated doors having added strength, better finishing and low cost manufacturing flexibility. The fire rated doors are made from two panels "sandwiched" together, which minimizes low density core exposure in routed details, improves routing detail appearance, provides a smoother appearance when painted, and increases the overall strength of the door assembly, through improved modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture. An optional interior layer (e.g., fire resistant material, lead sheeting, steel or Kevlar) can be added between the door panels for various purposes. Splines, stiles or sticks are inserted in<br>
longitudinal channels in the door panels to provide assistance in aligning the door panels and greater hardware holding strength. An intumescent banding material concealed by a banding material around the perimeter of the door seals the door within its frame during a fire. The door design and the automated manufacturing process provide greater design choice, reduced cost and faster fabrication.<br>
The present invention provides a fire rated door that includes a first routable door panel attached to a second routable door panel. Each door panel has two opposing longitudinal interior channels with each interior channel containing a spline. The attached door panels have a perimeter channel containing an intumescent banding material and an exterior banding to conceal the intumescent banding material.<br>
Hie present invention also provides a fire rated door having one or more protective layers disposed between a first routable door panel and a second routable door panel. Each door panel has two opposing longitudinal interior channels. The attached door panels have a perimeter channel. A spline is disposed within each interior channel. An intumescent banding material and an exterior banding to conceal the intumescent banding material are disposed within the perimeter channel. A data device containing production data is embedded within the door.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a fire rated door that includes a first routable door panel attached to a second routable door panel using a fire resistant adhesive and wherein each door panel has two opposing longitudinal interior channels with each interior channel containing a spline. Alternatively, the each door panel may also have a fire resistant coating.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing a fire rated door by cutting two longitudinal interior channels into a back side of a door panel, assembling a door slab by inserting a spline in each longitudinal interior channel of a first door panel, attaching a second door panel to the splines and first door panel using an adhesive and applying pressure to door slab to bond the splines and door panels together ,cutting a perimeter channel in the sides of the door slab, inserting an intumescent banding material and an exterior banding to conceal the intumescent banding material within the perimeter channel, routing a specified design into each panel of the door slab, applying one or more primer coats to the door slab, and machining the door slab to receive a set of hinges and lockset hardware. Note that this method can be implemented using a computer<br>
program embodied on a computer readable medium having one or more code segments to instruct a set of machines to perform the steps.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a manufacturing line to produce fire rated doors having a first set of machines to cut two longitudinal interior channels into a back side of a door panel, a second set of machines to assemble a door slab by inserting a spline in each longitudinal interior channel of a first door panel, attaching a second door panel to the splines and first door panel using an adhesive and applying pressure to door slab to bond the splines and door panels together, a third set of machines to cut a perimeter channel in the sides of the door slab, and insert an intumescent banding material and an exterior banding to conceal the intumescent banding material within the perimeter channel, a fourth set of machines to route a specified design into each panel of the door slab, a fifth set of machines to apply one or more primer coats to the door slab, a sixth set of machines to machine the door slab to receive a set of hinges and lockset hardware, and one or more conveyors interconnecting the machines to move the door slabs.<br>

Description of the Invention<br>
While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention and do not delimit the scope of the invention.<br>
To facilitate the understanding of this invention, a number of terms are defined below. Terms defined herein have meanings as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the areas relevant to the present invention. Terms such as "a", "an" and "the" are not intended to refer to only a singular entity, but include the general class of which a specific example may be used for illustration. The terminology herein is used to describe specific embodiments of the invention, but their usage does not delimit the invention, except as outlined in the claims.<br>
The present invention provides a system, method and apparatus for producing fire rated doors having added strength, better finishing and low cost manufacturing flexibility. The fire rated doors are made from two panels "sandwiched" together, which minimizes low density core exposure in routed details, improves routing detail appearance, provides a smoother appearance when painted, and increases the overall strength of the door assembly, through improved modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture. An optional<br>
interior layer (e.g., fire resistant material, lead sheeting, steel or Kevlar) can be added between the door panels for various purposes. Splines, stiles or sticks are inserted in longitudinal channels in the door panels to provide assistance in aligning the door panels and greater hardware holding strength. An intumescent banding material concealed by a banding material around the perimeter of the door seals the door within its frame during a fire. The door design and the automated manufacturing process provide greater design choice, reduced cost and fester fabrication.<br>
Now referring to FIGURE 3, a partial perspective exploded view of a door 300 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The door 300 includes a first routable door panel 302 attached to a second routable door panel 304. The door panels 302 and 304 can be made of a lignocellulosic substrate, a wood, a wood composite, , a medium density fiberboard or a combination thereof.. Each door panel 302 and 304 has two opposing longitudinal interior channels, slots, grooves or recesses 306. Each interior channel, slot or groove 306 contains a spline, stick or rail 308. The spline, stick or rail 308 can be made of a hardwood or other hard composite material. The splines 308 are used to locate and align the door panels so that the door can be assembled using automated machines. As a result, the use of the splines 308 reduces errors and waste, improves the quality of the door and speeds up the production process. Alternatively, the splines can be inserted and glued on edge of the door panels in stick or tape format into a machined recess. The door panels 302 and 304 and splines 308 are attached together using an adhesive. The type of adhesive used will depend on the material properties of the door panel 102 and where the door 300 is to be installed. The adhesive may be an epoxy or glue, and may be applied by various means such as brushing or spraying, for example. A double sided tape may also be employed for some applications. The adhesive 106 may be . applied to a portion or portions of one or both of the door panels 302 and 304. The adhesive is, however, preferably spread over Ihe extent of one of the door panels 302 or 304 and is a water soluble latex based glue, isocyanate resin/glue, catalyzed glue (e.g., epoxies and contact cements) or urethane-based resin. The amount of adhesive applied to adhere the door panels 302 and 304 together is an amount at least sufficient to hold these two members together such that the door 300 can be handled and installed into its final application. The use of two panels "sandwiched" together minimizes low density core exposure in routed details, improves routing detail appearance, provides a smoother appearance when painted, and increases the overall strength of the door assembly, through<br>
improved modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture. The outward facing portions of the door panels 302 and 304 can be finished to suit the environment in which the door 300 is being installed. Note that the previously described door can be a fire rated door by using an adhesive having fire retardant properties. Likewise, the door panels can be coated with a fire resistant or retardant material.<br>

The door 400 includes a first routable door panel 402 attached to a second routable door panel 404. The door panels 402 and 404 can be made of a lignocellulosic substrate, a wood, a wood composite, a medium density fiberboard or a combination thereof. Each door panel 402 and 404 has two opposing longitudinal interior channels, slots, grooves or recesses 406 and a large interior channel, slot or recess 408 between the two opposing longitudinal interior channels 406. Bach interior channel 306 contains a spline, stick or rail 410. The spline, stick or rail 410 can be made of a hardwood or other hard composite material, and provides the benefits previously described. The large interior channel contains one or more protective layers 412. The protective layers 412 can be a fire resistant material, a blast resistant material, a ballistic resistant material, a shielding material, a chemical resistant material, a biohazard resistant material, a radiation resistant material, a dampening material, a grounding material or a combination thereof. For example, the protective layers can be one or more gypsum boards, one or more metallic sheets, one or more lead sheets, one or more Kevlar sheets, one or more ceramic sheets, a layer of urethane foam, a layer of graphite, a wire mesh or a combination thereof. The door panels 402 and 404, splines 410 and protective layers 412 are attached together using an adhesive as previously described. The outward facing portions of the door panels 402 and 404 can be finished to suit the environment in which the door 400 is being installed. Note that the previously described door can be a fire rated door by using an adhesive having fire retardant properties. Likewise, the door panels can be coated with a fire resistant or retardant material. •<br>

Note also that an adhesive having fire retardant properties can be used. A specified design is routed into each door panel of the door slab in block 1110. The door slab is machined to receive a set of hinges and lockset hardware in block 1114. Note that this method can be implemented using a computer program embodied on a computer readable medium having one or more code segments to instruct a set of machines to perform the steps.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 12, a flow chart illustrating a method 1200 to manufacture a fire rated door in accordance with yet another embodiment the present invention is shown. Two longitudinal interior channels are cut into a back side of a door panel in block 1202. One or more protective layers are coated with an intumescent material in block 1204 and the stiles are coated with the intumescent material in block 1206. The protective layers can be a fire resistant material, a blast resistant material, a ballistic resistant material, a shielding, material, a chemical resistant material, a biohazard resistant material, a radiation resistant material, a dampening material, a grounding material or a combination thereof. Then in block 1208, the door is assembled by (a) inserting a spline in each longitudinal interior channel of a first door panel, (b) inserting one or more protective layers between the stiles, (c) inserting a data device into the door slab, (d) attaching a second door panel to the splines, the protective layers and the first door panel using an adhesive, and (e) applying pressure to the door slab to bond the splines and the<br>
 <br>
door panels together. The data device contains production data, such as a date that the door was manufactured, a time that the door was manufactured, an order number, a purchase number, a product identifier, a purchaser identifier, a shift identifier, a personnel identifier, a machine line identifier, one or more specifications for the door, a list of hardware for the door, a size of the door, a style of the door, a routing design identifier, a parts list, an options identifier, a special features identifier, an assembly program (CNC) or a combination thereof. A perimeter channel is cut in the sides of the door slab in block 1210. Note that the perimeter channel can extend to the spline. An intumescent banding material and an exterior banding to conceal the intumescent banding material are inserted into the perimeter channel in block 1212. A specified design is routed into each door panel of the door slab in block 1214. One or more primer coats are applied to the door slab in block 1216. The primer coats can be applied using an electrostatic powder coating process. Alternatively, the protective layers, stiles, door panels and/or primer coats can contain intumescent or fire resistant/retardant materials. Note also that an adhesive having fire retardant properties can be used. The door slab is machined to receive a set of hinges and lockset hardware in block 1215. Note that this method can be implemented using a computer program embodied on a computer readable medium having one or more code segments to instruct a set of machines to perform the steps.<br>
Now referring to FIGURE 13,- a block diagram of a manufacturing line 1300 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. A first set of machines 1302 cuts two longitudinal interior channels into a back side ofadoorpanel, A second set of machines 1304 assembles a door slab by inserting a spline in each longitudinal interior channel of a first door panel, attaching a second door panel to the splines and first door panel using an adhesive and applying pressure to door slab to bond the splines and door panels together. A third set of machines 1306 cut a perimeter channel in the sides of the door slab, and insert an intumescent banding material and an exterior banding to conceal the intumescent banding material within the perimeter channel. A fourth set of machines 1308 route a specified design into each panel of the door slab. A fifth set of machines 1310 apply one or more primer coats to the door. slab.. A sixth set of machines 1312 machine the door slab to receive a set of hinges and lockset hardware. One or more conveyors 1314 interconnect the machines to move the door slabs.<br>
The manufacturing line may also include a seventh set of machines 1316 to cut large sheets of a lignocellulosic substrate, a wood, a wood composite, a medium density<br>
fiberboard or a combination thereof into a door panel. An eighth set of machines 1318 can be used to apply an intumescent coating to the splines and a ninth set of machines 1320 can be used to apply an intumescent coating to the one or more protective layers. The one or more protective layers are inserted between the first door panel and the second panel by the second set of machines 1304. A tenth set of machines 1322 cut the protective layers, such as gypsum board, to the proper size. An eleventh set of machines 1324 prehang and package the doors. The second set of machines 1304 can also a data device into the door slab. The data device provides one or more instructions to control one or more of the machines. As a result, the specified design for the router can be different for successive door slabs moving through the line. Moreover, the data device allows each door slab to be customized to satisfy a purchase order. AH of the machines can be fully automated or semi-automated.<br>
A more specific example of a production process in accordance with the present invention will not be described. The door panels are sawn to rough size from large sheets. The door panels are sized on long edges and grooved for splines or sticks, if necessary. The panels from the previous saw operation are automatically fed into a production line of several machines. The first operation in that line trims the long edges of the panels to a consistent and predetermined size for the product required. This same machine also machines two grooves to accept the aligning splines or sticks.<br>
After the panels leave the machine in the step above, they are coated with a PUR hot melt adhesive, and then assembled into a door slab. This may consist of two door panels with encapsulated locating splines or sticks, an assembly without the splines, or a fire door or other type of assembly with or without splines. The third layer in a fire door assembly consists of a layer of 5/8" or 1/2" thick type C or type X gypsum board. This board may be coated with an intumescent or fire resistant paint or it may have the intumescent ingredients mixed within the gypsum. The splines, if present, may also be coated with the same intumescent or fire resistant paint. It is at this point that the RFID device is inserted internally. This RFID device will store information about the door, identifying it to all subsequent operations, so that the proper machine programs and parameters will be utilized during the processes of manufacturing. After the slab is assembled, it will run through pressure devices to assure a quality bond between the components, and will be automatically stacked down onto roller conveyor.<br>
The next step in the process is to automatically feed the doors from stacks on the roller conveyor into an automated line that will first machine the short sides of the door so that they are parallel and to a specific dimension. The doors are then rotated 90 degrees and fed into a second machine that machines the long sides, giving them a 3 degree relief angle, makes those sides parallel and to proper dimension. These operations will also sand the machined edges to conceal the joint between the panels, and chamfer or radius the edges. When fire rated doors are being produced, the machines will also machine clearance for and install intumescent banding along all four edges, and will also have the ability to install another layer of paintable banding over the intumescent banding, to provide the required appearance of a solid substrate. After the machining, banding and sanding operations, the doors will again be automatically stacked on roller conveyor.<br>
Doors are fed through automated router lines, where the first router machines one side of the door, a second station inverts the door, and another router machines the opposite side before they are automatically stacked.<br>
After the doors have been sized and/or banded, they will be automatically fed from stacks into machine lines that will perform the routing per customer order to give them the desired final appearance of being of raised panel construction and/or carved. The first machine will work on one panel of the door, and when that operation is complete, the doors will be conveyed to a device that inverts itso that it can be introduced to a second machine which will work on the opposite panel. When this operation is complete, the doors will again be automatically stacked on roller conveyor.<br>
The doors are fed through an automated prime coating line, where the top side is finished first, the doors are inverted, and the opposite side is finished. The doors then are fed into a second identical line which applies a second coat to all panels of the doors before they are automatically stacked. The doors are fed one at a time through a process that first-sands the top panel to remove imperfections, denibs (remove whiskers) and cleans, preheats, sprays primer, cures the primer and denibs again. The doors are then inverted and the same steps are performed on the opposite panel, with one additional step: at the end of the process line, the long edges are denibbed. At this point, the doors are automatically sent into a second line which is identical to the first, applying a second coat to all panels. The doors are then automatically stacked on roller conveyor.<br>
Alternatively, the doors are fed through an automated powder coat finish line. The doors are loaded either by hand or by a robot onto racks mounted to an overhead conveyor<br>
system. This conveyor system can be of a line conveyor type or a "power and free" type system. The doors are electrically charged either through contact through the racks/hooks and the conveyor system itself, or a conductive primer coating has been applied. After the doors are loaded onto the racks, they are sent through the preheat process. The preheat mechanism can be via one of three types; IR electric, IR gas catalytic or thermally via  . heated air circulation. Care needs to be taken in this process not to heat the doors too quickly, which can cause moisture to be driven to the panel resulting in cracks in the panel of the doors. Another issue could be scorching of the door panel. After preheating, the doors go to the powder application booth. The powder can be applied manually, semi-automatically (where an operator must be present to touch up areas to ensure complete coverage) or automatically. The powder itself can be of three types; theimo cure, low heat thermo cure or UV cure. After the powder is applied, the doors then proceed to the curing process. The curing process is accomplished through the application of heat via IR devices. These IR devices can be of different wavelength for different applications, or they can be of a combination of short, medium and long wavelength to improve the curing properties. At the end of the curing cyple, a UV light source can be utilized for the UV cured powder type. Next in the process is the cool, down tunnel where cool air is circulated to bring the doors down to a temperature where they can' be handled. They are then removed from the conveyor system and stacked, either manually or with a robot. The panels that can be obtained with the above process can range in texture from smooth to rough* and the gloss level can range from low to high gloss.<br>
The doors are fed through an automated machine line where they are prepared for hinges and lock sets as required. After this operation, the doors pass through an automatic inspection station, where they are checked via machine vision and laser inspection/measuring equipment for conformation to standards, and to verify that the doors match the intended specifications recorded on the enclosed RFID chip. They are then automatically stacked and packaged for shipment<br>
This machine line will machine the edges of the doors for the proper hinges and lockset hardware. The doors are automatically fed into and stacked from this process as well. It is after this operation where we may inject the pilot holes for the hinge screws with the chemical to improve the screw holding properties.<br>
Each of these machine lines will receive the instructions for what work is to be performed on each door via the encoded information stored on the embedded RFID device.<br>
