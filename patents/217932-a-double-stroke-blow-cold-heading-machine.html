the motive means of large power is required to start the machine as the wheels are big and heavy.<br>
Another disadvantage is that a lot of time is required to bring the machine into the running conditions. Similarly to stop the machine it takes a long time due to the momentum produced by the big and heavy wheels.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that more skilled labour is required to operate the machine.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that wear and tear of the forging ram is more as the waste material from the die falls on the wearing surface. j<br>
A further disadvantage is that the raw material is wasted as the cut piece cannot be placed in the die manually and easily due to long start/stop time of the machine.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that when ever one safety pin out of another safety pin provide at different load taking points get sheared, the machine remains in motion which results raw mate wastage and tooling breakage/dam ages.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the Forging Slide is fitted in such a way that the bearing/wearing surfaces are exposed to dust, chips of raw material and drawing powder stuck to raw material, which play a role of an abrasive mass to ruin/deface the bearing/wearing surfaces resulting in poor quality of bolts and screws forged on the machine.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the length of bearing/wearing surfaces of Forging Slide is so short that it is unable to keep itself as well as punch (mounted on the front side of Forging Slide) aligned with Die so as to get accurate forged bolts/screws.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to provide a double stroke cold heading machine which obviates the disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a double stroke/blow cold heading machine having the bearing/wearing surfaces at the front as well as the rear end more importantly at the top surface of forging slide and higher than the level where the raw material is fed into the machine.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a double stroke/blow heading machine having punch pressure wedge at the front end of forging slide means and behind the punch portion/area which is nearer and easily accessible to operator avoiding extra labour to adjust the pressure on the punch easily and quickly.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a double stroke cold heading machine wherein the use of big and heavy momentum wheels has been avoided.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a double stroke cold heading machine having the pinion and gear arrangement provided at the other end of the crank shaft which results in less power consumption.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a cold heading machine having a pneumatic clutch system provided with a driving wheel/fly wheel of the machine so as to connect and disconnect the operation of the machine from the driving wheel as and when required which facilitates the operator to bring the machine in motion and break/stop the motion within fraction of second.

Fig. 4 shows a pneumatic clutch which comprises:<br>
1.	Wheel (71)<br>
2.	Ring (72)<br>
3.	Fabricated rotor (78)<br>
4.	Internal Clutch Plate (75)<br>
5.	External Clutch Plate (76)<br>
6.	Pressure Plate Assy (73)<br>
7.	Bearing (79)<br>
8.	Bearing Cover (80)<br>
9.	Bearing Cover (81)<br>
10.	Hex Bolt (82)<br>
11.	Hex bolt (77)<br>
12.	Dowel Pin (83)<br>
13.	Allen Bolt (74)<br>
The Pneumatic clutch has been designed for immediate action of braking and releasing system. Pneumatic clutch mounted on the wheel shaft. Wheel (71) rotates with the help of motor (mounted on motor mounting stand). Air pressure goes in the clutch. Air pressure tightens the pressure plates (75 &amp; 76) so that inner and outer clutch plates are engaged with clutch ring (72). The clutch ring is mounted on the clutch wheel by bolts and dowels. So that wheel shaft rotates and the machine works. When air pressure is released from clutch, clutch plates get disengaged to stop machine, immediately.<br>
Internal clutch plate is having teeth inside its bore and external clutch plate is having teeth around its circumference. Pressure plate assembly (73) is major part of clutch (5).<br>
Through the pressure plate assembly Pressure goes to pressure plates (75 and 76). At that time clutch gets engaged to bring the machine into motion. When pressure is released through (73), the clutch is disengaged and the pressure plate assembly works as a brake to machine. The ring (72) gives movement to the outer plates (76) which after being given pressure brings the inner plates (75) in to motion. Clutch rotor (78) is provided around the shaft (6). When inner plates get engaged, it gives motion to the rotor to make the machine work.<br>
The machine is equipped with the pneumatic clutch brake, and special safety system which stops the machine instantaneously in case of air pressure failure, low level of lubricants or any other irregularity.<br>
Fig. 5 shows:<br>
Wheel shaft (6) also called a back shaft. The clutch wheel and pinion are mounted on this shaft. Bearings are provided on the shaft (6)<br>
to smoothen movement of the shaft.<br>
Fig. 6 shows<br>
Crankshaft (7) which gives to and fro motion to the forging slide. Connecting rod is also mounted on this crankshaft.<br>
Thus it is seen that the big/heavy momentum/fly wheels are not used in the machine of the present invention and therefore the motive/driving means of the large power is not required. Further, as the clutch arrangement is provided the machine can he stopped with in no time and similarly the machine can be brought to the running condition in a very little time. Hence, accident can be prevented immediately.<br>
Further, as the punch pressure adjusting means are provided just behind the punch area of the forging ram the punch pressure is adjusted very easily and quickly avoiding additional worker. The machine has got more accuracy due to long forging slide. Also the machine can be stopped easily and the rod like iron/steel piece can be put into the die manually and thus the wastage of the raw material is minimized.<br>
The whole machine is perfectly covered for safety, longer machine-life and lesser maintenance costs. The machine is constructed for high stability. For longer life of bearing surfaces and bushes automatic centralized lubrication system provides adequate quantity of lubricant. The invention results in increased productivity at lower operational cost and man power.<br>
