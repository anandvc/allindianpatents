CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This is a continuation-in-part of<br>
provisional application Serial No. 60/335,991 filed on November 15, 2001.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The synthesis of extractant hosts such as the macrocyclic crown ethers (including their nitrogen and sulfur substituted analogs), porphyrins, cryptands, calixarenes, and the like, frequently afford mixtures of the desired (predetermined) macrocyclic extractant molecule and acyclic starting materials and/or partial reaction products.  In addition to the presence of these synthesis reaction byproducts, different stereochemical conformations of the predetermined macrocyclic extractant can also be present (e.g., the cone, partial cone, 1,2-alternate, and 1,3-alternate conformations of calix[4]arene), and purification is frequently required to isolate the most desirable stereoisomer(s) for a given application.<br>
The crown ether 4,4'(S')-di-t-<br>
butylcyclohexano-18-crown-6 (DtBuCH18C6, Fig. 1) is illustrative of a highly selective extractant for the removal of Sr2+ and Pb2+ from acidic solutions that has been used over the past ten years in solvent extraction-based separations for the removal of the highly radioactive 90Sr fission product from acidic nuclear wastes [Horwitz et al., Solvent Extr. Ion<br>

(1992), 10:313-336] analyses of terrestrial, aquatic, and bioassay samples.<br>
The DtBuCH18C6 molecule can theoretically have 128 different isomeric designations; however, 20 diastereomers for each of the two t-butyl-substituted regioisomers (i.e., 4,4' and 4,5') result in only 40 symmetrically nondegenerate isomers.  Due to differences in the conformation of the t-butylcyclohexano substituents (i.e., cis-syn-cis, cis-anti-cis, etc.), each of the different stereoisomers of DtBuCH18C6 can exhibit different cation complexation strengths.   [Izatt et al., Chem. Rev.  (1991) 91:1721-2085; Hay et al., RL3-6-C3-31;<br>
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Richland, WA, (1996) and Hay, In Metal-Ion Separation and Preconcentration: Progress and Opportunities; Bond, et al. Eds.; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC,  (1999) Vol. 716:102-113.]  Specifically, the cis/trans and cross-ring syn/anti conformational differences can effect diminished cation extraction arising from steric constraints imposed by the t-butylcyclohexano substituents, severely distorted oxygen donor arrays, and/or poor preorganization for cation complexation that requires a conformational rearrangement at a thermodynamic expense.<br>
As a result of the application of<br>
DtBuCH18C6 in the removal of 90Sr from acidic nuclear wastes, as noted before, molecular modeling calculations have been performed to determine which of the 40 different isomers is the most efficient for the extraction of Sr2+ from HN03.  [Hay et al. , RL3-6-C3-31; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Richland, WA, (1996) and Hay, In Metal-Ion Separation and Preconcentration: Progress and Opportunities; Bond,  et al. Eds.; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC,  (1999) Vol. 716:102-113.]  Of the two isomers depicted in Fig. 1, molecular mechanics calculations have predicted that 4(z),4'(z)-cis-syn-cis-DtBuCH18C6 forms the most thermodynamically stable complexes with Sr2+, whereas 4(z),5' (e)-cis-anti-cis-DtBuCH18C6 is predicted to form the least stable complexes.<br>
The effects of conformational<br>
preorganization, which derive primarily from stereoisomerism rather than regioisomerism in this class of compounds, on the predicted distribution ratios for Sr2+ (DSr) are remarkable: DSr Â« 10 for<br>
4(z),4'(z)-cis-syn-cis-DtBuCH18C6 and DSr ~ 0.022 for 4(z),5'(e)-cis-anti-cis-DtBuCH18C6 (0.1 M solutions in 1-octanol and 1 M HNO3).  [Hay et al. , RL3-6-C3- 31; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Richland, WA, (1996) and Hay, In Metal-Ion Separation and Preconcentration: Progress and Opportunities; Bond, et al. Eds.; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC,  (1999) Vol. 716:102-113.]  These calculations clearly illustrate the significant impact that stereoisomeric effects can have on the efficiency of a given separation using dicyclohexano-18-crown-6 (DCH18C6)-based extractants and also point to the need for purification methods permitting the isolation or enrichment of those isomers having the most efficient Sr2+ extraction properties.<br>
The catalytic hydrogenation of the di-t-butylbenzo-18-crown-6 (DtBuB18C6, Fig. 2) precursor of DtBuCH18C6 results in the formation of synthesis byproducts, the most frequently encountered of which are shown in Fig. 2.  The catalytic hydrogenation of DtBuB18C6 can be presumed to occur in a step-wise manner to yield first 4 -t-butylbenzo-4' (5') -t-butylcyclohexano-18-crown-6 [(tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6] and finally DtBuCH18C6, which are depicted in the left column of Fig. 2.  Depending on the hydrogenation conditions [Gula et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,478,953 (1995)] and the activity of the heterogeneous rhodium (Rh) catalyst, ring cleavage reactions can produce a variety of acyclic molecules, and several possibilities are depicted in the right column of Fig. 2.<br>
Continuing work on the purification of extractant molecules such as DtBuCH18C6 and the isolation of those stereoisomers predicted to be the<br>
most efficient Sr2+ extract ants (i.e., 4(z),4'(z)-cis-syn-cis-DtBuCH18C6) has provided several strategies for the purification of predetermined extractants such as the stereoisomers of DtBuCH18C6 from the various aryl-containing under-hydrogenation products, ring cleavage products, and other inactive stereoisomers.  The disclosure that follows describes two precipitation-based methods and a versatile method that utilizes solvent extraction third phase formation that can be used to purify impure samples and also to enrich the sample in the desired isomers; the latter method meeting several success criteria important to commercial application.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention contemplates purification of a predetermined water-insoluble extractant that can be present along with one or more other extractants, starting materials, or reaction products.  Thus, one aspect of the invention contemplates a method for purifying a predetermined water-insoluble extractant from a composition containing one or more additional extractants, synthesis reaction starting materials and reaction byproducts; i.e., the composition can contain one or more of each of additional extractants, synthesis reaction starting materials and reaction byproducts. In accordance with that method, a liquid phase composition is provided that contains the predetermined extractant and one or more additional extractants, synthesis reaction starting materials and reaction byproducts that are dissolved as solutes in an organic diluent.  An ion-containing compound such as a metal salt is admixed with the composition<br>
to form a predetermined extractant/ion complex in the organic diluent phase that has an affinity for a new phase that is greater than the affinity for the first-named phase.  The predetermined extractant/ion complex is separated from the diluent by using the new phase affinity, and the predetermined extractant/ion complex is preferably although not necessarily recovered.  The predetermined extractant/ion complex is separated into extractant and ion.  The predetermined extractant is recovered.<br>
Exemplary predetermined extractants include a macrocyclic or acyclic polyether, polyamine, polythioether, a calixarene, a cryptand and a porphyrin.  Illustrative organic diluents include a C1-C5 alcohol, a C3-C9 ketone, a C2-C6 ether, a poly(C2-C6) ether, a C5-C14 straight, chain alkane, a C5-C14 branched chain alkane, a C6-C12 aromatic solvent, and a mixture of one or more such diluents.  Exemplary ion-containing compounds include a cation such as an ammonium ion, a potassium (I) ion, a rubidium (I) ion, a cesium (I) ion, a silver (I) ion, a thallium<br>
(I) ion, a calcium (II) ion, a strontium (II) ion, a barium (II) ion, a cadmium (II) ion, a lead (II) ion, a mercury (II) ion, a scandium (III) ion, an yttrium<br>
(III) ion, a lanthanum (III) ion, a lanthanide (III) ion (i.e., Ce-Lu) and a bismuth (III) ion.  Exemplary anions of an ion-containing compound include an anion selected from the group consisting of nitrate, nitrite, perchlorate, perbromate, periodate, chloride, bromide, iodide (halide).<br>
In some aspects, the extractant/ion complex has a greater affinity for a new phase that is a solid phase, whereas in other aspects the extractant/ion complex has a greater affinity for<br>
another liquid phase than for the diluent-containing phase.  Preferably, the extractant/ion complex exhibits a greater affinity for a solvent extractant third phase that is formed by admixture of an aqueous solution of the compound with a water-immiscible organic diluent phase.<br>
The present invention has several benefits and advantages.<br>
One benefit of the invention is that third phase formation is a robust purification strategy for purification of DtBuCH18C6 that is effective for different batches of DtBuCH18C6 that contain different impurities at varying concentrations.<br>
An advantage of extractant purification by third phase formation is the balance between purity and yield obtained through its use, while affording a product with DSr greater than 3.5 in less than four hours of effort in the laboratory.<br>
Another advantage of the invention is that a contemplated method uses inexpensive common laboratory chemicals, does not require special laboratory apparatus, and can be performed by a well-trained technician.<br>
Another benefit of the invention is that several variables related to purification via third phase formation (i.e., organic diluent, aqueous phase acidity, and extracted solute) can be readily adjusted to provide extractants of a desired purity in good yield.<br>
Still further benefits and advantages will be apparent to the skilled worker from the disclosure that follows.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention contemplates purification of a predetermined water-insoluble extractant that can be present along with one or more other extractants, starting materials  and reaction products.  Typical predetermined extractants contemplated here are used to extract a predetermined ion from an aqueous composition as in the extraction of a radioactive isotope from an acidic solution.<br>
One aspect of the invention contemplates a method for purifying a predetermined water-insoluble extractant from a composition containing one or more additional extractants, synthesis reaction starting materials and reaction byproducts.  In accordance with this method, a liquid phase composition is provided that contains the predetermined extractant and one or more additional extractants, synthesis reaction starting materials and reaction byproducts<br>
dissolved as solutes in an organic diluent.  An ion-containing compound is admixed with the composition to form an extractant/ion complex in the organic diluent phase that has an affinity for a new phase that is greater than the affinity for the first-named phase.  If the ion also forms a further complex with the one or more additional extractants, synthesis reaction starting materials and reaction byproducts that may be present in the composition, any such further complex formed exhibits less of an affinity for the second phase than does the predetermined extractant/ion complex.  The predetermined extractant/ion complex is separated from the diluent by using the new phase affinity.  The predetermined extractant/ion complex is separated into extractant and ion-containing compound, with or without a separate step of recovering the predetermined extractant/ion complex.  The predetermined extractant is recovered.<br>
Exemplary predetermined extractants include a macrocyclic (Figs. 1 and 2) or acyclic polyether (Fig.2), a cyclic polyamine (shown hereinafter), a cyclic polythioether (shown hereinafter), a calixarene (shown hereinafter), a cryptand (shown hereinafter) and a porphyrin.<br>
Exemplary macrocyclic polyethers include the crown ethers such as those known as 15-crown-5, 18-crown-6, 21-crown-7 and the like.  Bis-ring-substituted macrocyclic polyethers such as dibenzo--18-crown-6 and dicyclohexano-18-crown-6, are preferred.  Di-C1-C6-alkyl-substituted-bis-ring-substituted macrocyclic ethers are still more preferred.  4,4'(5')-di-t-butylcyclohexano-18-crown-6 (DtBuCH18C6), which can exist in several<br>
stereoisomeric forms of which two are shown in Fig. 1, is a particularly preferred extractant and is used herein as illustrative.  The compounds on the left-hand side of Fig. 2 illustrate other ring-substituted macrocyclic ether extractants, particularly those that can be present as impurities in a composition containing DtBuCH18C6 as the predetermined extractant to be purified.  Oligo- and poly(ethylene oxides) and poly(propylene oxides) exemplify unsubstituted and C1-C6-hydrocarbyl-substituted acyclic polyether extractants, whereas the several compounds shown on the right-hand side of Fig. 2 exemplify ring-substituted acyclic polyethers.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
The R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 substituent groups for all but the calixarene can be the same or different and are selected from the group consisting<br>
of a hydrido (H) , a C1-C10 normal or branched hydrocarbyl group, a C5-C8 cyclohydrocarbyl group, a C1-C6 normal or branched hydrocarbyl-substituted cyclohydrocarbyl group (e.g., t-butylcyclohexano), an aromatic group, and C1-C6 normal or branched hydrocarbyl-substituted aromatic group such as t-butylbenzo.<br>
For the calixarene, R1, R2, R3 and R4<br>
substituent groups can be the same or different and can be selected from the group consisting of a hydrido (H), C1-C10 normal or branched hydrocarbyl, ether, polyether, polyamine, polythioether, hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfonyl, or phosphonyl group.  R3 and R4 substituent groups are most commonly and preferably hydrido or methyl.  The sum of subscripts n and m (m + n) can be 4 through 8.  Most commonly n + m = 4, 6, or 8.  Of the possible combinations, n + m + n + m (i.e., alternating) are the most important, although n+n+m+m (i.e., blocks such as n = 2 and m = 2) can be prepared.  Odd numbered rings with n + m = 5 or 7 are less frequently encountered.  The odd numbered rings typically are "synthesis reaction byproducts" from which a calix[4]arene (i.e., n + m + n + m = 4) or calix[6]arene is purified by third phase formation.<br>
The word "hydrocarbyl" is used herein as a convenient term to include straight and branched chain aliphatic as well as alicyclic groups or radicals that contain only carbon and hydrogen. Thus, alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups are contemplated, whereas aromatic hydrocarbons such as phenyl and naphthyl groups, which strictly speaking are also hydrocarbyl groups, are referred to herein as aryl groups or radicals, as discussed hereinafter.<br>
Where a specific aliphatic hydrocarbyl substituent group is intended, that group is recited; that is, C|-C4 alkyl, methyl, or dodecenyl.  Exemplary hydrocarbyl groups contain a chain of 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, and preferably one to about 10 carbon atoms.<br>
A particularly preferred hydrocarbyl group is an alkyl group.  As a consequence, a generalized, but more preferred substituent can be recited by replacing the descriptor "hydrocarbyl" with "alkyl" in any of the substituent groups enumerated herein.<br>
Examples of alkyl radicals include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, iso-amyl, hexyl, n-heptyl, octyl and the like.  Examples of suitable alkenyl radicals include ethenyl (vinyl), 2-propenyl, 3-propenyl, 1,4-pentadienyl, 1,4-butadienyl, 1-butenyl, 2-butenyl, 3-butenyl, decenyl and the like.  Examples of alkynyl radicals include ethynyl, 2-propynyl, 3-propynyl, decynyl, 1-butynyl, 2-butynyl, 3-butynyl, and the like.  Corresponding ether or alkoxy groups contain an above alkyl group bonded to an oxygen atom that is also bonded to the cation ring.<br>
Illustrative organic diluents include a c1C5 alcohol, a C3-C9 ketone, a C2-C6 ether, a poly(C2-C6) ether, a C5-C14 straight chain, branched chain or cyclic alkane, and a C6-C12 aromatic solvent.  These solvents are well-known to workers of ordinary skill and can be selected from well-known handbooks, catalogues and the like.  Exemplary particularly preferred organic diluents include iso-propyl alcohol, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (glyme), n-heptane, and toluene.  Particularly preferred diluents are C5-C12 straight chain, branched<br>
chain and cyclic alkanes and C6-C9 aromatic solvents such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, dodecane, iso-octane, 2-methy1hexane, 3-methylhexane, 2,3-dimethylpentane, 2,4-dimethylpentane, 2,2,3-trimethylpentane, 2,2,4 -trimethylpentanne, 2,2,5-trimethylhexane , cyclohexane ,, cycloheptane , methylcyclohexane, ethylcyciohexane, and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, iso-propylbenzene, mesitylene, and a xylene, respectively.  In many instances where water is used in a purification, it is preferred that the organic diluent be non-miscible with water, and more preferably, dissolve less than about 2 percent by volume of water.<br>
An ion-containing compound contains a cation and an anion.  Anionic and uncharged extractants usually form complexes with cations, whereas cationic extractants usually form complexes with anions, although some amine-containing extractants can also extract cations at appropriate pH values.<br>
Contemplated exemplary cations present in an ion-containing compound include monovalent, divalent and trivalent cations.  Illustrative cations include an ammonium ion, a potassium (I) ion, a rubidium (I) ion, a cesium (I) ion, a silver (I) ion, a thallium (I) ion, a calcium (II) ion, a strontium<br>
(II)	ion, a barium (II) ion, a cadmium (II) ion, a<br>
lead (II) ion, a mercury (II) ion, a scandium (III)<br>
ion, an yttrium (III) ion, a lanthanum (III) ion, a<br>
lanthanide (III)  (i.e., Ce-Lu) ion and a bismuth<br>
(III)	ion.  A hydronium ion can also be useful in a<br>
purification by third phase formation.  A mixture of<br>
two or more of the above cations can also be used.<br>
Contemplated anions are preferably<br>
monovalent and are a counterion of a strong acid. Exemplary anions of an ion-containing compound include an anion selected from the group consisting of nitrate, nitrite, perchlorate, perbromate, periodate, chloride, bromide, iodide (halide), with chloride being particularly preferred.<br>
Hard Lewis acid cations are preferably used to form complexes with extractants containing oxygen donors such as the illustrative DtBuCH18C6, whereas soft Lewis acids are typically utilized to form complexes with polythioether or polyamine extractants.  Soft Lewis acid cations are also typically utilized to form complexes with polyamine, cryptand and porphyrin extractants, as are hydrogen bond donators (when in basic media) and hydrogen bond acceptors (when in acid media).  Calixarene extractants can have oxygen , nitrogen, and/or sulfur donor atoms and the cation, used for complex formation is chosen accordingly.  Strontium chloride is a particularly preferred compound for use in purifying the ring-substituted macrocyclic ethers used as illustrative herein.<br>
The ion-containing compound can be admixed with the organic diluent-containing extractant in solid form (in the absence of a solvent such as water) as by admixture of solid compound particles with the organic diluent phase, or the ion-containing compound can be dissolved in a solvent such as water when the admixture occurs to form the extractant/ion complex.  Illustrative admixture can occur by shaking, stirring or grinding the two ingredients together, as may be appropriate to the form of the<br>
phase in which the ion-containing compound is initially present.<br>
The extractant/ion complex that is formed has an affinity for a new phase that is greater than the affinity for the first-named phase.  In some aspects, that new phase is a solid phase, whereas in other aspects the extractant/ion complex has a greater affinity for another liquid phase than for the diluent-containing phase.  Preferably, the extractant/ion complex exhibits a greater affinity for a solvent extractant third phase as is discussed hereinafter.<br>
In some aspects, the extractant/ion complex precipitates directly and therefore has a greater affinity for a new solid phase than for the first-named, organic diluent-containing phase.  In other-aspects, the new solid phase comprises an exchange resin to which the formed complex preferentially binds.  In still other aspects, the complex is indirectly precipitated from the diluent phase by the addition of a further diluent that is miscible with the first-named organic diluent to form a new mixed organic diluent from which the extractant/ion complex precipitates as a new solid phase.<br>
In still more preferred practice, the ion-containing compound is dissolved in water, the organic diluent phase containing one or more of the predetermined extractant, synthesis reaction byproducts, and starting materials is not miscible with water, and the admixture of the immiscible aqueous and light organic phases that contains the extractant/ion complex causes a new third phase to form.  That new third phase contains the extractant/ion complex; that is, the extractant/ion<br>
complex exhibits a greater affinity for that new third phase than for either of the other two phases. Preferably, that third phase is more dense than water and forms beneath the water layer, providing an easy means for separation of the predetermined extractant/ion complex from the light organic (which contains the impurities) and water phases.  The phrase "third phase" is used interchangeably herein with the phrase "heavy organic phase".  The third phase can have a density that is less than that of water or that of the organic diluent, but it is preferred that the third phase have a density that is greater than either that of the extracted, "light organic phase" or the aqueous phase.<br>
The predetermined extractant/ion complex is thereafter separated into the predetermined extractant, which has been purified by the preceding steps, and an ion-containing compound.  Where a predetermined extractant/ion complex precipitates or is precipitated, that solid complex can be recovered prior to separating the predetermined extractant from the complexed ion.  Such recovery is not necessary as where a third phase is formed that contains the desired complex as well as liquid components such as the organic diluent.  It is contemplated, however, that the phase containing the predetermined extractant/ion complex be segregated from the other phases so that the purified predetermined extractant can ultimately be obtained.<br>
The new third phase or collected<br>
precipitate can be suspended in a suitable water-immiscible organic diluent and extracted one or more times with water or dilute acid as desired to remove the complexed ion along with its counterion.  If<br>
desired, and depending upon the ions utilized, a water-soluble compound, one of whose ions forms a precipitate with the complexed ion, can be admixed with the organic diluent composition to remove the ion from the complex, to provide the purified predetermined extractant that can be recovered by removal of the organic diluent.<br>
It should be understood that a contemplated purification can utilize a plurality of the above-described purification techniques, or the same technique more than once to obtain a desired level of purity.  Thus, for example, a predetermined extractant/ion complex can be precipitated twice or more from the same or different organic diluent, or a single precipitation can be followed by purification by third phase formation, or vice versa.<br>
When third phase formation is utilized for carrying out the desired purification, it is preferred that the extractant be present in the organic diluent at a concentration of about 0.25 molar (M) up to the limit of solubility or viscosity that can be conveniently manipulated.  Typically, the upper limit of concentration is about 1 to about 2 M, with toluene and n-heptane being particularly preferred organic diluents.<br>
The compound concentration used can depend upon the solubility of the compound and the constitution of the aqueous composition.  The compound concentration in the aqueous phase used for third phase formation is typically about 0.05 to about 4 M, and preferably about 0.5 to about 1.5 M. In addition, if a strongly acidic aqueous solution is used, the compound concentration can tend toward the lower side of the above range.  More preferably, a<br>
compound concentration of about 0.5 to about 1.5 M in aqueous acid solution is used.<br>
More preferably still, the ion-containing compound concentration used is a substoichiometric amount based on an assay of the extractant to be purified.  Thus, a composition containing a predetermined extractant with contaminating amounts of a starting material, a reaction product, or another extractant is assayed to determine the amount of predetermined extractant present.  Based upon that assay, a substoichiometric: amount of ion-containing compound is admixed with the composition to form the desired complex.  It has been found that admixture of the compound in an amount of about 90 mole percent of the amount of predetermined extractant provides a good balance between yield and purity of the resultant predetermined extractant.<br>
Exemplary strong acids for this use include the previously mentioned strong acids such as nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and perchloric acid present at about 0.5 M to concentrated acid.  The acid is preferably present at about 3 to about 5 M for ring-substituted macrocyclic ether extractants such as DtBuCH18C6, and up to about 6 M for acyclic polyether, polythioether, calixarene, cryptand and similar extractants.<br>
Any of the purifications discussed herein can be carried out at a temperature of about 10Â° to about 70Â°C.  More preferably, a contemplated purification is carried out at an ambient temperature of about 20Â° to about 30Â° C.<br>
As mentioned previously, a variety of<br>
reaction byproducts (Fig. 2) can be formed during the hydrogenation of DtBuB18C6 depending upon the<br>
synthesis conditions and catalyst activity.  In order to accurately identify and quantify these reaction byproducts in untreated and purified samples of DtBuCH18C6, an analytical method using RPLC-MS was developed and qualified.  Fig. 3A shows the RPLC-MS chromatogram of a partially hydrogenated DtBuCH18C6 Batch 492 as well as chromatograms (Figs. 3B-D) for each of three bands separated by preparative-scale thin layer chromatography (PTLC).  The PTLC study was performed to confirm the band assignments in the TLC screening method and also as a probe of the potential effectiveness of normal phase preparative-scale high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the purification of DtBuCH18C6.<br>
Fig. 3D shows that DtBuB18C6 and<br>
(tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 can be effectively separated from DtBuCH18C6 using 10 percent CH3OH in CH2C12 on silica gel PTLC plates (Rf = 0.42: (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 = 10.8 percent and DtBuCH18C6 = 85.4 percent).  Fig. 3 also provides valuable information relating to the retention times of reasonably pure samples of DtBuB18C6,  (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6, and DtBuCH18C6 in the RPLC-MS method.  A close examination of the chromatograms shows that the band for DtBuB18C6 is narrow because only two t-butyl-substituted regioisomers exist, but the bands become progressively wider when regioisomers and stereoisomers coexist [e.g., (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 and DtBuCH18C6].<br>
Fig. 4 is a chromatogram that shows the progress of a typical hydrogenation reaction of DtBuB18C6.  After one hour of hydrogenation (Fig. 4A), the mixture contains 30.2 percent (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6; at two hours (Fig. 4B)<br>
 (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 reaches 38.1 percent and 12.2 percent DtBuCH18C6 appears.  It is only after 18 hours of reaction (Fig. 4C) that substantial hydrogenation is observed with (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 and DtBuCH18C6 reaching 44.5 and 25.5 percent, respectively.  After 42 hours of reaction, no DtBuB18C6 or (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 are detectable by RPLC-MS.<br>
Although the results of Fig. 4 show the products present in a typical hydrogenation run, Fig. 5 shows examples of several hydrogenation reactions in which the catalyst activity and reaction conditions varied to produce complex mixtures of the molecules shown in Fig. 2.  Such combinations of ring-substituted acyclic diols, ring-substituted acyclic ethers, aryl-containing macrocycles, and isomers of DtBuCH18C6 place severe demands on the contemplated purification processes, especially if a single method is to be universally successful in the separation of DtBuCH18C6 from such complicated mixtures.<br>
COMMERCIAL ASPECTS<br>
Several success criteria were established to guide the development of an effective, convenient, and economically viable purification method for DtBuCH18C6 in a commercial context:<br>
(1)	Purified product should have a<br>
strontium distribution ratio (DSr value) greater than 3.5 from 1.0 M HNO3 ;<br>
(2)	Yield of greater than 65 percent of<br>
greater than 80 percent pure DtBuCH18C6;<br>
(3)	Ease of use at greater than 100 g scale<br>
(i.e., no special chemicals or equipment);<br>
 (4) Processing time less than 8 hours, Use of the above criteria eliminated a variety of potential purification methods including preparative-scale HPLC based on the successful PTLC separations shown in Fig. 3.  Furthermore, multiple attempts using low pressure chromatography [Dietz et al. , Sep. Sci. Technol. (1999) 34:2943-2956] and preparative-scale HPLC [results not shown] afforded in impractically low yields of DtBuCH18C6, even at low column loadings (i.e., less than 20 g).  Given the complicated multicomponent mixture and the constraints imposed by these success criteria, three potential schemes for the purification of DtBuCH18C6 emerged:<br>
(1)	Direct precipitation of predetermined<br>
extractant/ion complex;<br>
(2)	Induced precipitation of predetermined<br>
extractant/ion complex; and<br>
(3)	Solvent extraction third phase<br>
formation.<br>
Each of these purification methods involves cation coordination by the extractant, here, illustratively a crown ether, prior to precipitation or exclusion of the less soluble ion pair complex from an organic medium (i.e., having a greater affinity for another phase).<br>
Altering macrocycle phase affinity by complex formation has long been used and is the principle behind the separation of the cis-syn-cis and cis-anti-cis stereoisomers of DCH18C6.  [Izatt et al., Inorg. Chem. (1975) 14:3132-3133.]  This method uses perchloric acid (HC1O4) to precipitate t(H3O) (cis-syn-cis-DCH18C6) ] [C1O4]  [Simonov et al. , Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR (1983) 272:1129] from a mixture<br>
of the cis-syn-cis- and cis-anti-cis-DCH18C6 isomers, followed by the addition of excess PbCO3 to consume acid and precipitate [Pb(OH2) 2 ( cis-anti-cis-DCH18C6) ] [C1O4] 2.   [Rogers et al . , J. Chem. Crystallogr. (1997) 27:263-267.]  Such solubility differences have led to modified HClO4-based precipitation strategies for the purification of DtBuCH18C6 [Dietz et al., Sep. Sci. Technol. (1999) 34:2943-2956], but these approaches are not amenable for scale-up to multigram quantities due to the hazards associated with perchlorate compounds, low yields, and lengthy processing times.<br>
In order to limit as much as possible the complexation of the solubility-altering cation to the predetermined DtBuCH18C6 extractant, substoichiometric quantities of Sr" + were employed because this cation is known to form highly stable complexes with 18-membered macrocycles [Izatt et al., Chem. Rev. (1991) 91:1721-2085] and it is readily extracted from HN03-and HCl-containing aqueous media by DCH18C6 and DtBuCH18C6 [as noted before and in Horwitz et al., Solvent Extr. Ion Exch. (1990) 8:199-208; Dietz et al., Radiochim. Acta (1999) 85:119-129; Bond et al., Anal. Chem.  (1999) 71:2757-2765; Dietz et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. (1999) 1177-1178; Chiarizia et al., Solvent Extr. Ion Exch. (2000), 18:451-478; and Bond et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. (2000) 39:3432-3464].  Maximizing the extent of interaction between Sr2+ and DtBuCH18C6 also serves to minimize the presence of synthesis reaction byproducts in the purified material because such molecules are weaker ligands than DtBuCH18C6 and they remain soluble in the organic medium, whereas the [Sr (DtBuCH18C6) ] 2+ complex has a greater affinity for<br>
another solid or liquid phase.  Thus, a substoichiometric quantity of Sr2+, relative to the possible DtBuCH18C6 content of the as-hydrogenated material, was used as a means of introducing selectivity for DtBuCH18C6 into the purification process.<br>
Initial studies were focused on the precipitation of Sr2+ complexes of DtBuCH18C6 involving relatively nontoxic and nonhazardous anions, and the precipitation of [Sr (Dt.BuCH18C6) ] 2 + complexes with the common inorganic anions N03~ or Cl seemed a logical starting place.  Preliminary studies targeting precipitation of the NO3~ salts of<br>
[Sr(DtBuCH18C6) ] 2+ from isopropyl alcohol were unsuccessful, probably due to a combination of factors including the limited solubility of Sr(NO3)2 in isopropyl alcohol and the high polarity, dielectric constant, and hydrogen bonding properties of this solvent that serve to keep the NO3 complex of<br>
[Sr (DtBuCH18C6) ] 2+ in solution (even after the addition of copious quantities of n-heptane).<br>
As a result of these solubility issues, investigations migrated toward the use of less polar etheric and aromatic solvents.  Studies using glyme or toluene showed that the N03 salt of<br>
[Sr (DtBuCH18C6) ] 2+ did riot precipitate from these solvents as well defined solids amenable to recrystallization procedures.  Furthermore, dissolution of these N03 complexes proved to be difficult, which hampers Sr2+ stripping and the ultimate recovery of purified DtBuCH18C6.<br>
Conversely, SrCl2 is readily dissolved by solutions of DtBuCH18C6, and the resulting complexes could be conveniently suspended in MIBK to facilitate<br>
Sr2+ removal prior to recovery of purified DtBuCH18C6. Dissolution of DtBuCH18C6 Batch 512 in glyme and contact with a 90 percent stoichiometric quantity (relative to DtBuCH18C6) of solid SrCl2Â»6H2O followed by cooling to 8(Â±1) Â°C, isolation and washing of the precipitate, and removal of SrCl2 by stripping in an MIBK/aqueous Na2SO4 liquid/liquid distribution system provided 96.5 percent pure DtBuCH18C6.<br>
As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 6, DtBuCH18C6 can be effectively separated from the byproducts of incomplete hydrogenation; however, Batch 512 contains only two of the potential impurities that are shown in Fig. 2.  A precipitation study was carried out using Batch 527 that contains the ring-substituted acyclic butyl ether to assess the versatility of this method.  The chromatogram of Fig. 7 shows an enrichment of DtBuCH18C6 from 47.6 percent to 91.8 percent with a commensurate decrease in the ring-substituted acyclic butyl ether content from 34.6 percent to less than 5 percent.<br>
Unfortunately, the low yield (less than 30 percent) of the glyme precipitation px'ocess and the dependence of yield on the type and concentration of impurities forced a continued search for other solvents from which the Sr'+ complex of DtBuCH18C6 could be more efficiently precipitated.  Toluene was examined in an attempt at improving the recovery yield of DtBuCH18C6, and Fig. 8 shows a chromatogram of the results of a contact of DtBuCH18C6 Batch 574 with SrCl2Â»6H2O in toluene.<br>
The top panel of Fig. 8 shows that a significant amount of the ring-substituted acyclic ethyl ether is present in the untreated material, along with several peaks in the 7.96-9.02 minute<br>
elution range that correspond to DtBuCH18C6 (based on the mass spectral results}.  As a result of these impurities, the untreated sample exhibited a substandard DSr = 2.5.<br>
The middle panel of Fig. 8 shows that the ring-substituted acyclic ethyl ether content remains approximately constant in the toluene supernatant and that three peaks corresponding to DtBuCH18C6 appear in the 8.53-10.58 minute elution range in the chromatogram.  The reversed phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS) assay of the solid that was precipitated, filtered, washed, and stripped of SrCl2 is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 8, where it is seen that the amount of the ring-substituted acyclic ethyl ether impurity has been reduced from 21.4 percent in the untreated sample to 5.4 percent in the purified material.  The lower panel also shows that the DtBuCH18C6 content is 92.3 percent after purification (although the very broad band is noted), and that DSr = 4.3, which readily exceeds the distribution ratio success criterion.<br>
As with the precipitation from glyme, the yields of purified DtBuCH18C6 from toluene never approached the minimum commercial success criterion of 65 percent recovery of 80 percent pure DtBuCH18C6, which prompted testing of an induced precipitation strategy.  This technique involves the addition of a less polar solvent (e.g., MTBE) to a solvent (e.g., isopropyl alcohol) in which SrCl2, DtBuCH18C6, and the respective metal complex are readily soluble.  Such an approach serves to reduce the polarity, dielectric constant, and solvating properties of the isopropyl alcohol medium to effect precipitation of the Cl" salt of the [Sr (DtBuCH18C6) ] 2+ complex.  Fig. 9 shows the<br>
chromatogram of a study using this method, and it can be seen that DtBuCH18C6 is enriched from 62.2 percent to 93.1 percent with a substantial decrease to less than 5 percent of the ring-substituted acyclic diol and (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 impurities.<br>
Although the precipitation-based purification strategies were shown to provide DtBuCH18C6 of greater than 90 percent purity and having DSr greater than 3 .5 in accord with the commercial success criteria, the yields using these techniques are unpredictable and inadequate for the desired commercial application and the operational procedures are cumbersome and time consuming.  More importantly, the extent of complex precipitation and, consequently, the yield of DtBuCH18C6 were found to be highly sensitive to the type and concentration of the various impurities shown in Fig. 2.  The results of other precipitation or precipitation-induced purification studies did not produce isolable solids, and only in rare instances did the yields exceed about 30 percent.  It thus became apparent that a more convenient and robust (i.e., less sensitive to byproduct content) purification technique was needed.<br>
Third phase formation in solvent<br>
extraction, primarily relating to organophosphorus extractant systems, has been previously described in detail, [Kertes, In Solvent Extraction Chemistry of Metals, McKay et al. Eds.; Macmillan: London, (1965); page 377; Vandegrift, In Science and Technology of Tributyl Phosphate.  Volume I: Synthesis, Properties, Reactions, and Analysis, Schulz et al. Eds.; CRC Press: Boca Raton, FL, (1984); Vol. I page 69; Kolarik et al., Solvent Extr. Ion Exch. (1988) 6:61-91; and Rao et al., Solvent Extr. Ion Exch. (1996)<br>
14:955-993] and only a brief overview of the phenomenon and variables pertinent to the purification of DtBuCH18C6 are presented hereinbelow.<br>
As conventionally practiced, solvent extraction involves the partitioning of a solute between two heterogeneous phases, one of which is aqueous and most frequently another that is organic. [Kertes, In Solvent Extraction Chemistry of Metals, McKay et al. Eds.; Macmillan: London,  (1965); Sekine et al., Solvent Extraction Chemistry; Marcel Dekker: New York, 1977; and Rydberg et al. Eds., Principles and Practices of Solvent Extraction; Marcel Dekker: New York, 1992.]  When an extractant is used in a nonpolar organic diluent and high solute loading is achieved, the extractant/solute species can become insoluble in the organic diluent and can thus separate into a heavy organic phase that is rich in the extractant/solute species and a light organic phase that is depleted of the extractant and solute. When water (or acid), diluent, extractant, and solute are present in sufficient quantities, three phases can form: one that is primarily aqueous, and two that are primarily organic.  In a chemical sense, third phase formation is generally attributed to changes in the solubility (or affinity for another phase) of the extractant/solute species.<br>
The third phase formation phenomenon is sensitive to the following variables:<br>
(1)	Type and concentration of extractant<br>
(e.g., acidic, basic, and neutral extractants have<br>
different extraction mechanisms and therefore have different heavy organic phase characteristics) ,-<br>
(2)	Diluent polarity and branching (e.g.,<br>
n-alkane diluents generally form third phases at<br>
lower organic phase loadings than do branched alkanes);<br>
(3)	Type and concentration of extracted<br>
solute (e.g., tri-n-butyl phosphate in n-alkane<br>
diluents forms a third phase with tetravalent cations<br>
and also with metal-free concentrated acids);<br>
(4)	Type and concentration of acid;<br>
(5)	Ionic strength of aqueous phase,-<br>
(6)	Temperature (i.e., the propensity for<br>
third phase formation decreases at elevated<br>
temperature); and<br>
(7)	Type and concentration of phase<br>
modifier (e.g., alcohols and other polar compounds<br>
are used to enhance solubility of the<br>
extractant/solute species in the loaded organic<br>
phase).<br>
Third phase formation is generally<br>
perceived as problematic in solvent extraction as most contacting equipment is not designed to operate with more than two phases; the separation efficiency is degraded; losses of extractant, diluent, and target solute are costly; and solvent extraction plant operations are interrupted.  For these reasons, many variables cited above are adjusted to prevent third phase formation, and only infrequently has the formation of a heavy organic phase been induced to accomplish a specific task such as extractant purification.  The work described here employs third phase formation with the express intent of purifying an organic extractant such DtBuCH18C6 from its various reaction (here, hydrogenation) byproducts.<br>
A typical third phase formation study involves dilution of as-hydrogenated DtBuCH18C6 to about 1.4 M in a nonpolar organic diluent and contact<br>
with a 90 percent stoichiometric quantity of SrCl2 in 3-6 M HCl.  After contact and centrifugation, the upper light organic and aqueous phases are separated from the lower, viscous heavy organic phase.  The heavy organic phase is then suspended in MIBK (a polar diluent less susceptible to third phase formation than nonpolar diluents), and the SrCl2 is stripped from the organic phase by two contacts with H2O, a single contact with Na2SO4, and two more contacts with H20.  Details of these manipulations are presented elsewhere herein, and an optimized method for large-scale purification (i.e., greater than 100 g quantities) of DtBuCH18C6 is described below.<br>
Preliminary studies using DtBuCH18C6 Batch 512 in toluene exhibited a heavy organic phase when contacted with a 90 percent stoichiometric quantity of SrCl2 in 3.0 M HCl.  The results of this study are shown in the chromatograms of Fig. 10, where the upper panel shows the untreated starting material, the center panel shows the composition of the toluene light organic phase, and the lower panel shows 95.8 percent pure DtBuCH18C6.<br>
The virtually complete rejection of DtBuB18C6 and (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 from the heavy organic phase product was a particularly remarkable result that clearly warranted reproducibility testing with other batches of as-hydrogenated DtBuCH18C6. (Recall that the precipitation-based purification methods were highly sensitive to batch variations in the type and concentration of impurities.)<br>
The chromatograms of Fig. 11 depict data similar to those of Fig. 10, and show a rather impressive enrichment of Dt.BuCH18C6 from a 47.6 percent mixture with the ring-substituted acyclic<br>
butyl ether to 95.4 percent after purification. There is a shift in elution times of about 1 minute for the various peaks attributable to DtBuCH18C6, which is most likely attributable to the chromatographic variables discussed in the Analysis section.  Also derived from the studies in Fig. 11 are the values of DSr = 2.5 for the untreated material and of DSr = 4.6 after purification by third phase formation.  Of equal importance is that Figs. 10 and 11 suggest that third phase formation appears to be less susceptible to the batch variations in type and concentration of impurities than the precipitation-based techniques.<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 illustrate chromatograms from the purification of two different batches of DtBuCH18C6 by third phase formation using toluene (Figs. 12B and 13B) or n-heptane (Figs. 12C and 13C) as diluent, with both yielding equal to or greater than 90 percent pure DtBuCH18C6.  The most notable difference between use of these diluents is found in the yields of the DtBuCH18C6 product: average recoveries from n-heptane of 39.0 percent are about 7.5 percent higher than those of 31.6 percent from toluene.<br>
Fig. 14 shows a chromatogram from a more detailed diluent study performed on DtBuCH18C6 Batch 585 that contains both under-hydrogenation and ring cleavage products.  From the three lower panels it is evident that the ring-substituted acyclic diol reports to the heavy organic phase and therefore constitutes a substantial impurity in the product obtained by third phase formation.  Fortunately, improvements in the hydrogenation conditions minimize the formation of acyclic byproducts, as shown in the<br>
chromatogram from the hydrogenation example depicted in Fig. 4.<br>
The studies in Fig. 14 also show that the yield of DtBuCH18C6 increases on going from toluene<br>
(32.6(2) percent) to n-heptane (52(7) percent) to n-dodecane (70.5 percent) {in agreement with expectations [Kolarik et al . , Solvent Extr. Ion Exch.<br>
(1988) 6:61-91 and Rao et al., Solvent Extr. Ion Exch. (1996) 14:955-993 ]}, but with a concomitant decrease in the purity of the DtBuCH18C6 product<br>
(Fig. 14).  Thus, a balance between yield and purity should be maintained during the purification of DtBuCH18C6 by third phase formation, which is in agreement with previous observations using a HC1O4-based purification technique.  [Dietz et al., Sep. Sci. Technol. (1999) 34:2943-2956.]<br>
Table 1 further illustrates the observed inverse relationship between purity and yield, and also shows that the yields for normal vs. branched octanes are comparable.  Based on the results shown Figs. 12-14 and Table 1, it was concluded that the use of .n-heptane as diluent represents an acceptable balance between purity, yield, ease of use (i.e., n-heptane in the heavy organic phase can be readily distilled from the DtBuCH18C6 product), and economics.<br>

Influence of Diluent on Yield and Purity of<br>
DtBuCH18C6 from Batch 585a by Third Phase Purification<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
aUntreated sample is 62.2 percent DtBuCH18C6. bYield with respect to Sr2 + as the limiting reactant used in the purification.<br>
The acidity of the aqueous phase is another variable important in purification by third phase formation that can be conveniently adjusted to maximize the recovery of DtBuCH18C6.  The chromatograms of Fig. 15 present data for the purification of DtBuCH18C6 Batch 585 using third phase formation in toluene when contacted with 3.0 (Fig. 15B), 4.5 (Fig. 15C) and 6.0 (Fig. 15D) M HCl. The percentage of DtBuCH18C6 in the heavy organic<br>
phase increased from 62.2 percent in the untreated material to 70.9, 72.7, and 71.8 percent on increasing the HC1 concentration from 3.0, to 4.5, and then to 6.0 M (Figs. 15B-D), respectively.  As observed earlier, the ring-substituted acyclic dioi partitions to the heavy organic phase; however, the more frequently encountered (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 content is less than 5 percent in 3.0 and 4.5 M HCl, but again significant at 5.7 percent in the sample obtained using a 6.0 M HCl aqueous phase (Fig. 15D).<br>
The most prominent effect of increasing the aqueous phase acidity is in the overall yield of product, with an approximate two-fold increase in yield on going from 3.0 [32.6 (Â±2) percent] to 4.5 [69 (Â±1) percent] M HCl.  The yield of DtBuCH18C6 product (with respect to Sr2 + ) exceeds 100 percent in 6.0 M HCl due to the combined influence of high solute (i.e., Sr2 + ) loading and high acid concentration, which force the ring-substituted acyclic diol and (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 into the heavy organic phase.  In general agreement with the decrease of DtBuCH18C6 purity (and increase in byproduct content), DSr values decrease from 3.8, 3.6, to 3.3 on increasing the HCl concentration used in the purification process from 3.0, 4.5, to 6.0 M, Figs. 15B-D, respectively.  In keeping with the diluent effects studies, aqueous phase acidity should also be adjusted to appropriately balance the inverse relationship between purity and yield of the DtBuCH18C6 product.<br>
The chromatogram panels of Fig. 16 show a similar variation in acid concentration, except that n-heptane was used as the diluent.  Again, the purity of DtBuCH18C6 decreases as the HCl concentration<br>
increases from 3.0, 4.5, to 6.0 M (Figs. 16B-D, respectively) due to the increased partitioning of impurities to the heavy organic phase [i.e., ring-substituted acyclic diol + (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6].  Most striking is the difference in the yields obtained here for n-heptane when compared to yields obtained using toluene.  From toluene media, 3.0 M HCl yields 32.6 (Â±2) percent and 4.5 M HCl yields 69 (Â±1) percent, whereas for n-heptane 3.0 M HCl yields 52 (Â±7) percent and 4.5 M HCl yields 96.2 percent.<br>
The data of Figs. 15 and 16 provide additional evidence that n-heptane is a preferred diluent when yield and purity are of prime concern, and also indicate that about 4.5 M HCl is optimal for these criteria.  These conclusions are, however, partially obscured by the presence of the ring-substituted acyclic diol in Batch 585 and its partitioning to the heavy organic phase.<br>
Consequently, DtBuCH18C6 Batch 590-2 was subjected to the same acid dependence studies as Batch 585 (Fig. 16), except that the chromatogram of Fig. 17A shows that Batch 590-2 does not contain ring-substituted acyclic polyethers.  The hydrogenation reaction was incomplete for this sample, affording a mixture of 6.8, 41.0, and 47.6 percent DtBuB18C6,  (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6, and DtBuCH18C6, respectively.<br>
Upon increasing the aqueous phase HCl concentration from 3.0 (Fig. 17B) to 4.5 (Fig. 17C) M, the percentage of DtBuCH18C6 in the product derived from the heavy organic phase decreased slightly from 86.3 percent to 79.9 percent, while the (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 content remained essentially constant at about 13 percent.  Such a decrease in<br>
 (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 content from the original 41.0 percent to about 13 percent in the heavy organic phase is notable, as the under-hydrogenation products are presently the most frequently encountered byproducts in as-hydrogenated DtBuCH18C6.  As observed for Batch 585, 6.0 M HCl (Fig. 17D) caused most of the impurities to partition to the heavy organic phase; consequently, this HCl concentration is not a candidate for commercial use.<br>
The yields of DtBuCH18C6 from Batch 590-2 are substantially lower than observed for Batch 585<br>
(Fig. 16); however, the additional 7-10 percent purity of the products derived from Batch 590-2 compensates somewhat for the lower yield.  The chromatograms of Figs. 16 and 17 further underscore the impact of batch variations of impurity type and concentration on recoveries and purity of the purified products.<br>
The procedures discussed above have utilized those variables affecting third phase formation that are most conveniently adjusted (i.e., diluent and acid concentration) to provide DtBuCH18C6 according to certain success criteria.  Several of the remaining variables pertinent to third phase formation have been examined, but certain variables have not been tested.  For example, a more dilute solution of as-hydrogenated DtBuCH18C6 could be used prior to third phase formation, but the concentration of the hydrogenation reaction product was not examined as the objective of this work is to develop a versatile, commercially viable process affording high yields of pure DtBuCH18C6.  The work reported here uses about 1.4 M untreated DtBuCH18C6 for third phase formation, which is just dilute enough to<br>
reduce the viscosity of the untreated material so that adequate phase dispersion is achieved for the solvent extraction reaction yet is concentrated enough to produce a heavy organic phase in good yield.<br>
The majority of the studies discussed here have used SrCl2 extraction to introduce some measure of selectivity into the purification process because it is known that certain stereoisomers of DtBuCH18C6 exhibit superior extraction of Sr2+, whereas the various reaction byproducts and the remaining stereoisomers are far less efficient Sr'+ extractants. [Hay et al. , RL3- 6-C3- 31; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Richland, WA, 1996 and Hay, In Metal-Ion Separation and Preconcentration: Progress and Opportunities; Bond et al. Eds., American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 1999; Vol. 716:102-113.]  As a test of this hypothesis, studies in which third phase purification was attempted in the absence of SrCl2 were performed.<br>
Use of 3.0 M HC1 does not form a heavy organic phase from toluene or n-heptane solutions of DtBuCH18C6, but 4.5 M and 6.0 M HCl both yield heavy organic phases that are less dense than the aqueous phase.  There are no statistically significant differences between the RPLC-MS chromatograms of the heavy organic phases from 4.5 M HCl (Fig. 18B) and 6.0 M HCl, and neither shows enrichment of DtBuCH18C6.  Similarly, the heavy organic phases formed by contact of n-heptane solutions of Batch 585 with 4.5 M solutions of HNO3 or HCl04 free of added metal ions were less dense than the aqueous phase and had ring-substituted acyclic diol, (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6,<br>
and DtBuCH18C6 compositions statistically identical to those obtained from 4.5 M HCl.<br>
Also shown in Fig. 18 are the results of third phase formation studies using KC1, SrCl2, and LaCl3 from n-heptane diluent and 0.9 M metal chloride in 4.5 M HCl (0.9:1 Mn+:DtBuCH18C6) .  Use of KC1 as the extracted solute forms a third phase less dense than the aqueous phase, and little enrichment in DtBuCH18C6 content is observed.  Similarly, LaCl3 provided minimal enrichment; of DtBuCHlSCG in the heavy organic phase; however, the heavy organic phase formed using this compound was more dense than the aqueous phase, which is suggestive of La3+/DtBuCH18C6 interactions.<br>
Fig. 18D shows for comparison the product derived from the heavy organic phase formed in the presence of SrCl2, and it is evident that this cation (and probably Pb2 + ) are well suited to the purification of DtBuCH18C6 by third phase formation. Fortuitously, the Cl~ complex of [Sr(DtBuCHlSCG)]2t forms a heavy organic phase that is more dense than the light organic and aqueous phases.  This density difference is useful because the purified DtBuCH18C6 product in the bottom heavy organic phase does not contact the light organic phase containing the impurities (i.e., they are separated by the aqueous phase), which minimizes contamination and simplifies isolation of the heavy organic phase product.<br>
A limited examination of anion effects on third phase formation was conducted using Sr(NO3)2 and Sr(ClO4)2 in 4.5 M solutions of their respective acids.  The NO3~ compounds present solubility issues as mentioned in the discussion of precipitation methods, nevertheless third phases were formed with<br>
DtBuCH18C6 Batch 585 (solids, rather than third phases, can form with different batches of DtBuCH18C6).  Rather surprisingly, little enrichment of DtBuCH18C6 was exhibited by either the N03~ or Cl04 systems with DtBuCH18C6 contents of 62.4 percent and 59.3 percent, respectively, which more closely resemble the raw starting material (Fig. ISA) than the material purified by third phase formation using SrCl2 (Fig. 18D).  Aside from the solubility properties and convenience of third phase formation using Cl "-based systems, it appears that<br>
[Sr(DtBuCH18C6)]2+ complexes of this anion also provide a higher purity Dt.BuCH18C6 product.<br>
Studies have also been carried out in which the stoichiometric ratio of Sr2+:DtBuCH18C6 was varied.  These studies showed an increase in DtBuCH18C6 content of Batch 585 from about 65 percent at a stoichiometry of 0.75:1 to about 74 percent at 0.9:1, after which the percentage of DtBuCH18C6 (and the ring-substituted acyclic diol) plateau through a superstoichiometric ratio of 1.25:1.<br>
The chromatograms of Fig. 19 show the<br>
results of the sequential third phase purification of DtBuCH18C6 Batch 585.  Fig. 19A shows the untreated material, and the remaining three panels show the analyses of the products obtained from the heavy organic phase after each of three third phase formation processes, respectively.  The ring-substituted acyclic diol content increased regularly through the three purification cycles, whereas the<br>
(tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 content decreased to less than 5 percent.  After one regimen of third phase formation<br>
(Fig. 19B), the DtBuCH18C6 content was increased to about 70 percent, after which the DtBuCH18C6 content<br>
was substantially constant through the remaining two purification procedures Figs. 19C-D).<br>
The most notable effects of repeated purification is the disappearance of the peaks at 8.95 minutes observed in the untreated material (top panel), which correspond to DtBuCH18C6 based on the mass spectral data.  The disappearance of these peaks after three cycles of third phase purification (Fig. 19D) and the improved symmetry of the peak at 9.39 minutes suggest that some degree of isomer enrichment is occurring, and the extent of this enrichment is presently under investigation.<br>
Based on the results shown in Figs. 12-18 and Table I, n-heptane as diluent and SrCl2 in 4.5 M HCl as the aqueous phase were determined to represent the best balance between purity, yield, ease of use, and economics for the purification of DtBuCH18C6 by third phase formation.  Several scale-up studies using these parameters were performed incrementally: 2 g, 6 g, 80 g, and 200 g, with each study showing that both the purity and yield of the DtBuCH18C6 product increased as the effects of losses and contamination due to manipulations, transfers, etc., became less significant as the preparation scale increased.<br>
A general flow-sheet for laboratory-scale purification of DtBuCH18C6 is depicted in Fig. 20. By example, a 200 g sample of as-hydrogenated DtBuCH18C6 (+ byproducts) is distributed evenly amongst twelve different 50 mL centrifuge tubes, n-heptane is added to provide a solution of about 1.4 M, and the tubes were gently heated in a bath at 60Â° C to facilitate dissolution.  A sufficient volume of 1.25 M SrCl2 in 4.5 M HCl was added to each tube so<br>
that the stoichiometric ratio of Sr2+:DtBuCH18C6 was about 0.9:1 (DtBuCH18C6 content of the untreated material previously determined by RPLOMS) .  Each tube was vigorously shaken to ensure good phase contact and followed by centrifugation to give three phases from top to bottom: light organic, aqueous, and heavy organic.  The bottoms of the 12 centrifuge tubes were then placed in a shallow ice bath to ensure that the heavy organic phases become viscous enough to permit simple decantation of the upper light organic and aqueous phases.  After decantation of the upper phases, each heavy organic phase was suspended in several mL of MIBK, combined into a separatory funnel, and sufficient MIBK added to provide a solution of less than 0.3 M.  (Higher concentrations of DtBuCH18C6 increased the likelihood of emulsions.)  The organic phase was subsequently washed with three volumes of 0.10 M HCl at an organic/aqueous phase ratio (O/A) of about 2, which stripped SrCl2 from the organic extract.  A final wash with H2O at 60Â° C was performed to remove coextracted acid (elevated temperature suppressed the formation of emulsions), the aqueous phase was drained, and the MIBK was removed by rotary evaporation.  Entrained H2O can result in an opaque product that can be removed using the toluene/H2O azeotrope.<br>
Results using the procedure shown in Fig. 20 appropriately scaled to an 80 g batch of as-hydrogenated DtBuCH18C6 (Batch 592) are shown in Fig. 21.  The top panel shows a rather complicated chromatogram indicating substantial quantities of a ring-substituted acyclic ether, (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6, and a complicated distribution of DtBuCH18C6 convoluted with the ring-substituted acyclic butyl<br>
ether (see Fig. 21C).  Fig. 21C shows the results of a small-scale purification using n-heptane as diluent and 1.25 M SrCl2 in 4.5 M HCl as the aqueous phase.  A 78.0 percent pure sample of DtBuCHl8C6 was obtained in 59.3 percent yield, with less than 10 percent of each of the aforementioned cyclic and acyclic impurities.  Fig. 21C shows the RPLC-MS chromatogram for the n-heptane light organic phase obtained from the 80 g purification, and it can be readily seen that this phase is enriched in the various impurities and substantially depleted of DtBuCH18C6.  Fig. 21D shows the purity of the product obtained from the heavy organic phase, which has a DtBuCH18C6 content of 83.4 percent and is substantially enriched from the 60.2 percent untreated material.<br>
Also observed from these studies is the increase from DSr = 2.6 for the untreated sample (Fig. 21A) to DSr = 4.6 for the sample purified by third phase formation (Fig. 21D).  As mentioned earlier, the yield of 59.3 percent obtained on the 2 g scale increased to 91.9 percent at the 80 g scale, and is further complemented by an increase in the DtBuCH18C6 purity of about 5 percent.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
All chemicals were of ACS reagent grade or better.  All H2O was treated using a commercial deionization system.<br>
Synthesis<br>
The heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of DtBuB18C6 (Chemodynamics, L.P.) has been reported, [Gula et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,478,953 (1995)] and this procedure was utilized here with only minor<br>
modifications.  Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric analysis (RPLC-MS) indicated significant differences in both the type and concentration of impurities in each batch of DtBuCH18C6, and such differences have largely been attributed to variations in the activity of the catalyst.  As a result of such batch variations, samples of as-hydrogenated DtBuCH18C6 are referred to by their batch number.<br>
Given that the DtBuCH18C6 content varies by batch and that the specific purification strategies discussed here generally involve the addition of substoichiometric quantities of Sr2+, all yields are reported with respect to Sr2+ as the limiting reactant used in the purification process, except where noted differently.  This approach accounts for variations in the DtBuCH18C6 content by synthesis batch and also permits a comparison of yields between different purification methods.<br>
Analysis<br>
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used for qualitative determination of sample purity and also was used to screen samples prior to submission for RPLC-MS analysis. Silica gel TLC plates with an inorganic binder and 250 Âµm layer thickness<br>
(Analtech, Inc., Newark, DE) were used with variable solvent compositions ranging from 2.5-7.5 percent<br>
(v/v) CH3OH in CH2C12.  Band development was accomplished by chemical oxidation using an aqueous H2SO4/(NH4) 2MoO4/Ce (SO4) 2 dip solution.<br>
Preparative-scale TLC (PTLC) was used to separate the DtBuB18C6,  (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6, and DtBuCH18C6 in Batch 492 using 10 percent CH3OH in<br>
CH2C12 on silica gel PTLC plates having a 1000 Âµm layer thickness (Analtech, Inc., Newark, DE).  A preliminary PTLC separation was performed and three bands were chemically developed to serve as a template.  A second PTLC separation was immediately performed and the three bands located using the distances from the template (Rf = 0.65, 0.54, and 0.42).  Each band was subsequently scraped from the glass support into a separate vial.<br>
The crown ethers were extracted from the silica gel substrate by shaking for 10 minutes with 10 mL of 50 percent CH3OH in CH2C12-  After permitting the solid substrate to settle, each supernatant was collected, another 5 mL of 50 percent CH3OH in CH2C12 was added, and the mixture was maintained for about 14 hours before the supernatant was again separated from the solid silica.  After a final contact of the solid with 2 mL of 50 percent CH3OH in CH2C12, the three wash solutions for each sample (i.e., band) were combined, filtered, and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation to yield (by RPLC-MS) DtBuB18C6 as a white solid, (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 as a colorless oil, and DtBuCH18C6 as a colorless oil.<br>
TLC as described before using 5 percent<br>
CH3OH in CH2C12 for the Batch 492 mixture formed three intense spots with Rf = 0.20, 0.12, and 0.04.  Each of the three bands scraped from the PTLC experiment exhibited only a single spot by TLC that was confirmed by RPLC-MS to be DtBuB18C6 with Rf = 0.14, (tBuB)(tBuCH)18C6 with Rf = 0.10, and DtBuCH18C6 with Rf = 0.04 .<br>
The RPLC-MS analyses were performed by MediChem Research, Inc., using chromatographic conditions modified slightly from a previously<br>
published method.  [Lasorkin et al., Zh. Anal. Khim.<br>
(1984) 39:1115 and Dietz et al., Sep. Sci. Technol.<br>
(1999) 34:2943-2956.]  The protocol involved about 15 minutes of elution on a C18-bonded reverse-phase silica gel column (LUNA-C18-2 column, 100 x 4.6 mm;<br>
(Phenomenex, Inc., Torrance, CA) using 20 percent H2O/80 percent CH3CN as eluent.<br>
Mass spectrometry utilized atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and an ion-trap mass detector was used for peak detection.  The chromatograms were prepared using the total ion count from the mass spectrometer and a full mass spectrum for each time increment was recorded.  No fragmentation of the polyethers was observed, and only the H+ or H3O+ adducts of each polyether were observed in the mass spectra.<br>
Retention times (RT) of the components vary with chromatographic conditions and the age of the column; however, the relative RT of the different components and the elution sequence remain fairly constant.  The reproducibility of chromatographic peak integration (used to obtain the composition of mixtures) typically varied in the 2-4 percent range between identical samples, and peaks integrated at less than 5 percent are considered to be at the lower limit of statistical significance in these studies.<br>
All distribution ratios were determined by first preequilibrating 2.5 mL of 0.10 M DtBuCH18C6<br>
(as-received product or purified) in 1-octanol with 2.5 mL of 1.0 M HNO3 and vortex mixing for about 2 minutes.  After about 2 minutes of centrifugation, the aqueous phase was withdrawn and the<br>
preequilibration step was repeated.  A 2.4 mL aliquot of fresh 1.0 M HNO3 was then added along with 0.10 mL<br>
of 1000 ppm Sr standard solution in 1.0 M HNO3.  The phases were vortex mixed for about 2 minutes and followed by about 2 minutes of centrifugation to disengage the phases.  The aqueous phase was withdrawn and diluted for analysis, whereas the concentration of Sr in the organic phase was calculated by difference.  (As a check on this difference calculation, several studies were performed in which the organic extract was stripped three times with 2.0 mL of 0.05 M HNO3 by vortex mixing and centrifuging as described above.  All three of the strip raffinates were combined and diluted for analysis and yielded the same values for DSr as obtained by the difference technique.)  The distribution ratio is calculated as:<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
All distribution ratios were collected at 23 (Â±2)Â° C and are accurate to Â±10 percent.  Strontium analysis was accomplished using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy on a Liberty Series II instrument (Varian, Inc., Mulgrave, Victoria Australia).<br>
Example 1:  Purification by Precipitation<br>
of Metal Complex		<br>
A 1.96 g sample of as-hydrogenated<br>
DtBuCH18C6 Batch 512 (69.5 percent DtBuCH18C6) was diluted to 5 mL with ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (glyme) and dissolved by stirring at 65 (Â±2)Â° C.  A 0.66 g quantity of SrCl2*6H2O was added and the<br>
mixture was stirred at 65 (Â±2)Â° C for about 10 minutes to effect dissolution.  The solution was stored at 8(Â±1)Â° C for about 45 minutes to induce precipitation of a white solid that was filtered, washed with a small quantity of cold glyme, collected, and dissolved in 10 mL CH3OH.  This solution was subsequently contacted with 1 mL of 1.0 M Na2SO4 in water and, after vigorous manual shaking, the solid SrS04 was settled by centrifugation.  The SrS04 pellet was filtered and washed with more CH3OH.  Another 1 mL of 1 .0 M Na2SO4 was added to the DtBuCH18C6-containing filtrate, the mixture was shaken, and then was centrifuged to settle the SrSO4 .<br>
Residual solids were filtered away and 15 mL of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and 11 mL of H20 were added to the filtrate to afford a two phase system that was vigorously shaken for about 2 minutes, centrifuged for about 2 minutes, and followed by removal of the aqueous phase.  The organic phase was washed twice more with 10 mL aliquots of H2O using the procedure described above. The MIBK was subsequently removed by rotary evaporation and the purified extractant was assayed by RPLC-MS (Fig. 6B).<br>
Example 2:  Purification by Induced<br>
Precipitation of Metal Complex	<br>
A 25 g sample of DtBuCH18C6 Batch 585 (62.2 percent DtBuCH18C6) was dissolved in 100 mL isopropyl alcohol, after which 4.99 grams SrCl2Â»6H2O were added. The mixture was stirred for about 16 hours and only a small amount of suspended white solid was observed. The solid was compacted by centrifuging for 10<br>
minutes and the supernatant was decanted and concentrated by rotary evaporation.  Methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE, 100 mL) was added to the supernatant residue and thoroughly mixed to yield a white suspension that was divided into three aliquots that were each centrifuged for 15 minutes.<br>
The supernatants were decanted away from the pellets and each pellet was resuspended in 20 mL MTBE, centrifuged, and the supernatants again decanted.  This process was repeated twice more before each of the pellets was contacted with 20 mL MIBK and 2 mL H2O.  The aqueous phases were drained and combined.  The MIBK phases were combined and extracted with 15 mL H2O.  This H2O phase was added to the combined aqueous phases from the previous extractions to give a cloudy mixture that was subsequently extracted with 10 mL MIBK.<br>
The resulting phases were clear, and this MIBK phase was added to the three combined MIBK phases from the previous extractions.  This solution was contacted 8 times with 40 mL aliquots of H20 to strip SrCl2 .  The MIBK solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to yield 7.88 g of a highly viscous, colorless product that crystallized over several days at 23 (+2)Â° C.  The resulting material was coated on an inert support to make an extraction chromatographic resin [Horwitz et al., Anal. Chew. (1991) 63:522-525] that exhibited a value of more than 100 free column volumes to peak maximum for elution of Sr2+ in 3.1 M HN03, thereby confirming that this purification strategy produces a useful extraction chromatographic resin.  The product obtained from a 2 g purification of Batch 585 using this procedure was assayed by RPLC-MS (Fig. 9B).<br>
Example 3:  Purification by Solvent<br>
Extraction Third Phase Formation	<br>
A 2.01 g sample of untreated Batch 585 (62.2 percent DtBuCH18C6) was dissolved in 1.0 mL of toluene by gentle stirring at 65 (+2)Â° C to provide a solution of about 1.4 M.  A 2.4 mL aliquot of 0.9 M SrCl2 in 3.0 M HC1 (0.8:1 Sr2+: DtBuCH18C6) was combined with the toluene solution and the phases were contacted by vigorous manual shaking for about 2 minutes.  The mixture was centrifuged for about 2 minutes to disengage the three phases that formed.<br>
The upper light organic and aqueous phases were withdrawn.  The lower, viscous heavy organic phase was washed twice with about 1 mL of toluene prior to addition of 5 mL MIBK and 5 mL H20.  The phases were contacted by shaking vigorously for about 2 minutes and disengaged by centrifugation for about 2 minutes.<br>
The aqueous phase was withdrawn and another contact with 5 mL H2O was similarly carried out. After the second aqueous strip solution was removed, a 5 mL aliquot of saturated Na2SO4 in H2O was added (to ensure complete stripping of Sr2+ from the organic phase) and contacted as described above.  Another two contacts with 5 mL H2O were carried out to remove any traces of Na2SO4 from the MIBK extract .  After separating the aqueous phase, the MIBK was removed by rotary evaporation to yield 0.34 g, a portion of which was assayed by RPLC-MS (second panel of Fig. 14B) .<br>
All studies in which third phase formation was used to purify DtBuCH18C6 were performed using this same general procedure, except that the diluent,<br>
solute, or aqueous acidity was varied where noted. Any light organic phases that were assayed by RPLC-MS were subjected to the Sr2 + stripping routine described above.<br>
Example 4:  Purification of Calix[4]Arene by<br>
Solvent Extraction Third Phase Formation<br>
A 2 g sample of raw calix[4]arene is<br>
dissolved in several mL of a suitable diluent (e.g., chloroform, methylene chloride, toluene, etc.) to provide a reasonably concentrated solution (about 0.25-1.5 M).  A 90 percent stoichiometric quantity of an ion-containing compound such as a metal salt (e.g., Ca(NO3)2, SrCl2, UO2C12, and the like) in 3-6 M acid (e.g., HCl, HNO3, etc.) is combined with the organic solution and the phases are contacted by vigorous shaking.  The mixture is centrifuged to disengage the three phases and the light organic and aqueous phases are withdrawn.<br>
The heavy organic phase is washed twice with a small volume of organic solvent prior to the addition of several mL of a diluent in which the purified calix[4]arene is soluble and that also is immiscible with H2O and easily distilled (e.g., toluene, nitrobenzene, and the like).<br>
A comparable volume of H2O is added and the phases are vigorously contacted and disengaged by centrifugation.  The aqueous phase is withdrawn and another aliquot of H2O is used for another extraction. After the second aqueous strip solution is removed, an aliquot of an H2O-soluble stripping agent (e.g., SO42~, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, etc.) is added to ensure complete stripping of the cation from the organic phase and contacted as described above.<br>
Another two contacts with aliquots of H2O are performed to remove any traces of stripping agent from the organic phase extract.  After separating the aqueous phase, the diluent is removed by rotary evaporation to provide the purified calix[4]arene.<br>
