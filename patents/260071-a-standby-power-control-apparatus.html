Description<br>
APPARATUS   FOR   CONTROLLING   STANDBY   POWER<br>
Technical   Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to an apparatus for controlling standby power, and<br>
more particularly to a standby power controller for monitoring individual states of<br>
peripheral devices connected to a computer and a current state of the computer, and<br>
completely blocking a power-supply voltage from being applied to the peripheral<br>
devices and the computer according to the monitoring result, such that it blocks the<br>
occurrence of standby power.<br>
Background   Art<br>
[2]	Recently, a variety of power-saving electric appliances have been increasingly<br>
developed to accomplish energy-saving and environment-protection purposes, such<br>
that they have been widely used throughout the world. As a variety of power-saving<br>
electronic fluorescent lamps using a power semicondxtor have rapidly come into<br>
widespread use in the Republic of Korea since the beginning of the 1990's, a high<br>
power-saving effect has been established in an illumination field. A plurality of<br>
countries have divided an energy efficiency grade of electric appliances into first to<br>
fifth energy efficiency grades to allow such energy-saving appliances to come into<br>
widespread use.<br>
[3]	The most important matter to determine the above-mentioned energy efficiency<br>
grade is standby power.<br>
[4]	For example, a TV using a remote-controller is called a preheater, and is designed<br>
to immediately display a screen image in response to a switching-ON signal or to<br>
consume remote-control power, such that it unavoidably consumes power on the<br>
condition that a user does not take a TV plug cut of a wall although the user turns off<br>
the TV.<br>
[5]	The amount of standby power occupies about 11 % of total household power<br>
consumption according to academic research. In the case of reducing the amount of<br>
standby power, annual energy costs can be redxed by about 33,000 Won for each<br>
household, and annual energy costs can be reduced by about 500 billion Won in the<br>
country as a whole. In the case of OECD member countries, the amount of power of<br>
about 10%~15% of average household power consumption has been consumed as<br>
annual standby power, such that unnecessary consumption of standby power has been<br>
considered to be the most serious problem of power consumption in the world.<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	2	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
[6]	The above-mentioned standby power has been unfavorably named "Pwer<br>
Vampire" by public opinion organizations in the United States since the occurrence of<br>
the California power crisis in 2001. The US government has announced the<br>
Presidential Order dictating that products which no not satisfy the requisite 1-Watt<br>
standby power shall be excluded from governmental procurement.<br>
[7]	European Union (EU) has established a standby power reference by announcing the<br>
Power Efficiency Principles in Brussels. The Japanese Government has also es-<br>
tablished a variety of rules associated with standby power, such that it has increasingly<br>
concentrated upon development of improved standby power technologies in<br>
conjunction with associated enterprises.<br>
[8]	In the meantime, with the increasing development of computers and the widespread<br>
of multimedia, a plurality of peripheral devices are connected to the computers for use<br>
in individual households and offices. For example, a plurality of peripheral devices, for<br>
example, a monitor, speakers, a printer, a scanner, and a PC camera, etc., are generally<br>
connected to a single computer. In order to supply a power-supply voltage to the<br>
computer and the peripheral devices, a multi-concent for use in the computer is<br>
generally used.<br>
[9]	However, the peripheral devices are used by only a user command generated when<br>
a computer main body is currently operated, such that the user must directly power off<br>
individual devices when the computer is not in use, resulting in greater inconvenience<br>
of use. For example, if a plug of the computer is connected to the socket althagh the<br>
computer is powered off, i.e., in the case of a standby time, or if the computer or a<br>
specific peripheral device is not in use for a long period of time on the condition that<br>
the computer is powered on, i.e., in the case of an idle time, the user must directly<br>
power off individual devices. The amount of power consumed for the idle time is<br>
greater than that consumed for the standby time, such that it is considered to be a very<br>
serious problem.<br>
[10]	In order to reduce the amount of power consumption during the standby time, a first<br>
method for mounting a manually-operable switch to the multi-concent to control<br>
power on/off operations, and a second method for detecting a current of a power-<br>
supply voltage transmitted from a computer socket to a computer main body, and<br>
blocking peripheral devices from receiving a power-supply voltage when the computer<br>
is powered off are well known in the art. A representative example is described in<br>
Korean Utility Model Registration No. 20-218843, issued on 19 January 2001, entitled<br>
"Power-Saving Multi-Concent5'which is hereby incorporated by reference. Korean<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	3	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
Utility Model Registration No. 20-218843 describes a method for detecting on/off<br>
states of a computer according to a current detection scheme, and blocks a power-<br>
supply voltage from being applied to peripheral devices when the computer is powered<br>
off.<br>
[1l]	However, in the case of the idle time, i.e., in the case where a computer or specific<br>
peripheral device is not in use for a long period of time on the condition that a user<br>
powers on the computer, there is no solution to accomplish the power-saving effect<br>
Disclosure   of  Invention<br>
Technical   Problem<br>
[12]	Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and<br>
it is an object of the present invention to provide a standby power control device for<br>
monitoring state information of peripheral devices connected to a computer and a<br>
current state of the computer, and controlling power-supply voltages of the peripheral<br>
devices and the computer according to the monitoring result, such that it reduces the<br>
amount of power consumed for an idle time during which a user does not actually use<br>
the computer and at least one peripheral device die to his or her mealtime, conference,<br>
settlement, and outing, etc. after the computer and the peripheral devices are powered<br>
on, and reduces power consumption of the remaining unused peripheral devices even<br>
when one or more peripheral devices are used, resulting in the implementation of<br>
complete power-saving effect.<br>
[13]	It is another object of the present invention to provide a standby power control<br>
device for efficiently reducing the amount of standby power (i.e., power consumption<br>
generated when a plug is connected to a socket although the computer is powered off)<br>
of a computer and its peripheral devices on the condition that a user powers off the<br>
computer to leave his or her office or to fall asleep.<br>
Technical   Solution<br>
[14]	In accordance with the present invention, the above and other objects can be ac-<br>
complished by the provision of a standby power control apparatus for use in a power<br>
control device for controlling a power-supply voltage of a computer system including a<br>
computer and a monitor, and controlling power-supply voltages of peripheral devices,<br>

source to a DC power-supply voltage requisite for the system, and providing individual<br>

from the switching unit, and detecting load information of the peripheral device on the<br>

and being installed in the computer in the form of an application program, such that it<br>
provides the user with a variety of administrator setup menus to allow the user to<br>
control overall operations of the system using the administrator setup menus.<br>

devices on the condition that the user powers off the computer to leave his or her office<br>
or to fall asleep.<br>

Mode   for   the   Invention<br>
[20]	Now, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail<br>
with reference to the annexed drawings. In the drawings, the same or similar elements<br>
are denoted by the same reference numerals even though they are depicted in different<br>
drawings. In the following description, a detailed description of known fractions and<br>
configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may make the subject<br>
matter of the present invention rather unclear.<br>
[21]	Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a standby power control device according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
[22]	Referring to Fig. 1, the standby power control device 100 according to the present<br>
invention includes a power-supply unit 110, an interface unit 120, an Input/<br>
Output(I/O) terminal unit 130, a switching unit 140, a detector 150 for detecting<br>
individual load(hereinafter referred to as an individual load detector), a sensor 160, a<br>
microprocessor 170, an output unit 180 for generating individual drive<br>
signals(hereinafter referred to as an individual drive signal generator), and a<br>
monitoring/management unit 190.<br>
[23]	The power-supply unit 110 converts a 110V or 220V commercial power source to a<br>
DC power-supply voltage requisite for a system, and provides individual components<br>
with necessary power-supply voltages. The power-supply unit 110 includes a rectifier<br>
circuit(not shown) for rectifying an AC voltage to a DC voltage, and a constant-<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	6	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
voltage ciraat(not shown) for converting the DC voltage generated from the rectifier<br>
circuit into a constant DC voltage. Also, the power-supply unit 110 may receive a DC<br>
voltage from either the interface unit 120 or the computer 10.<br>
[24]	The interface unit 120 is connected to the computer via a communication line, and<br>
interfaces a signal transmitted from the computer 10. In this case, the interface unit 120<br>
supports a variety of communication schemes, for example, an USB (Universal Serial<br>
Bus), a PS2, and an RS232, etc.<br>
[25]	The I/O terminal unit 130 is connected to a mouse 11 and a keyboard 12 of the<br>
computer 10, and transmits input signals received from the mouse 11 and the keyboard<br>
12 to the microprocessor 170. In more detail, the I/O terminal unit 130 includes PS2<br>
and USB ports to interconnect the mouse 11 and the keyboard 12, a PS2 port<br>
connected to a PS2 port of the computer 10, and an USB port connected to an USB<br>
port of the computer 10.<br>
[26]	The switching unit 140 connects a plurality of switches 141 such as relays to a<br>
plurality of sockets 101, respectively. The switches 14 are switched by a drive signal<br>
of the output unit for generating individual drive signals, and recovers or blocks a<br>
commercial power source applied to individual sockets 101. In this case, the socket<br>
101 includes designated addresses for every peripheral device such that the micro-<br>
processor 170 independently controls the computer 10, a computer monitor 20, and a<br>
peripheral device 30. A commercial power source is applied to the switches 141 via<br>
individual sockets 101.<br>
[27]	The individual load detector 150 receives power-supply state information from the<br>
switching unit 140, and detects load information of the peripheral device 30 on the<br>
basis of the received power-supply state information. In this case, a user may monitor<br>
whether the system is normally operated on the basis of the amount of load detected by<br>
the individual load detector 150.<br>
[28]	The sensor 160 is mounted to one side of the computer 10 or the monitor 20 to<br>
determine the presence or absence of a user. In this case, a variety of sensors may be<br>
used as the sensor 160, for example, a thermal sensor, an optical sensor, a contact<br>
sensor, and an acoustic sensor, etc.<br>
[29]	The microprocessor 170 receives a first input signal from the computer 10 via the<br>
interface unit 120, a second input signal from the mouse 11 and the keyboard 12 via<br>
the I/O terminal unit 130, and a third input signal from the individual load detector 150<br>
and the sensor 160, and switches the switching unit 140 according to the received first<br>
to third input signals, such that it controls a power-supply voltage generated from the<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	7	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
sockets 101. In this case, if the microprocessor 170 receives a first power-supply<br>
control command, a second power-supply control command, or a third power-supply<br>
control command, it selectively recovers a power-supply voltage of the computer<br>
monitor 20 or the peripheral device 30 or simultaneously recovers the power-supply<br>
voltages of the computer monitor 20 and the peripheral device 30 according to the<br>
received power-supply control command information. In this case, the first power-<br>
supply control command is adapted to selectively recover a power-supply voltage of<br>
the computer monitor 20 or the peripheral device 30 or simultaneously recover power-<br>
supply voltages of the computer monitor 20 and the peripheral device 30 on the<br>
condition that the microprocessor 170 receives power-supply recovery commands of<br>
the computer monitor 20 and the peripheral device 30 from the monitoring/<br>
management unit 190 via the interface unit 120 after the computer monitor 20 and the<br>
peripheral device 30 are powered off. The second power-supply control command is<br>
adapted to recover a power-supply voltage of a specific peripheral device on the<br>
condition that the microprocessor 170 determines whether the specific peripheral<br>
device is used after recognizing used state information of the computer monitor 20 and<br>
the peripheral device 30 in real time. The third power-supply control command is<br>
adapted to recover power-supply voltages of the computer monitor 20 and the<br>
peripheral device 30 by allowing the microprocessor 170 to determine whether an<br>
input signal is generated from the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12.<br>
[30]	In the case of the following first to fourth cases, the microprocessor 170 blocks a<br>
power-supply voltage from being applied to the computer 10, the monitor 20, and the<br>
peripheral device 30. In the first case, a system of the computer 10 is terminated such<br>
that the monitoring/management unit 190 does not generate a response signal at least<br>
predetermined number of times. In the second case, there is no input signal from the<br>
mouse 11 and the keyboard 12 during at least a predetermined time. In the third case,<br>
when the individual load detector 150 detects the amount of load of the computer 10,<br>
the computer monitor 20, or the peripheral device 30, it is determined that the detected<br>
load is less than a predetermined amount of load. In the fourth case, a user is not<br>
detected by the sensor 160 during at least a predetermined time.<br>
[31]	If the user generates an input signal using the keyboard 12 or the mouse 11 on the<br>
condition that the computer 10, the computer monitor 20, and the peripheral device 30<br>
are powered off, or if the presence of the user is detected by the sensor 160, the micro-<br>
processor 170 recovers power-supply voltages of the computer 10, the monitor 20, and<br>
the peripheral device 30.<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	8	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
[32]	The microprocessor 170 provides the computer 10 with only standby power when<br>
the presence of the user is detected by the sensor 160 on the condition that the<br>
computer 10 is powered off.<br>
[33]	The individual drive signal generator 180 receives a control command signal from<br>
the microprocessor 170, and outputs a drive signal to switch on or off the switches 141<br>
of the switching unit 140.<br>
[34]	The monitoring/management unit 190 determines whether the computer 10 is<br>
actually used or the peripheral device 30 is actually used, outputs a signal to the micro-<br>
processor 170 via the interface unit 120 according to the determined result. The<br>
monitoring/management unit 190 is installed in the computer 10 in the form of an ap-<br>
plication program, such that it provides a user with a variety of administrator setup<br>
menus to allow the user to control overall operations of the system using the ad-<br>
ministrator setup menus. In this case, the monitoring/management unit 190 includes<br>
address information when a power-supply control command is transmitted to the mi-<br>
croprocessor 170.<br>
[35]	If the monitoring/management unit 190 transmits a first power-supply control<br>
command, a second power-supply control command, a third power-supply control<br>
command, or a fourth power-supply control command. In this case, the first power-<br>
supply control command is adapted to selectively or simultaneously block power-<br>
supply voltages of the peripheral device 30 when a user enters a power-supply<br>
blocking command of the peripheral device 30. The second power-supply control<br>
command is adapted to block a power-supply voltage from being applied to a specific<br>
peripheral device on the condition that used state information of the peripheral device<br>
30 is recognized in real time and the specific peripheral device is in an idle state during<br>
a predetermined period. The third power-supply control command is adapted to block<br>
a power-supply voltage from being applied to a corresponding peripheral device when<br>
a user manually powers off the corresponding peripheral device. The fourth power-<br>
supply control command is adapted to block a power-supply voltage from being<br>
applied to the peripheral device 30 if the monitoring/management unit 190 receives no<br>
input signal from the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12 during at least a predetermined<br>
time.<br>
[361	Contrary to the above-mentioned cases, the monitoring/management unit 190<br>
generates a first power-supply control command to selectively or simultaneously<br>
recover power-supply voltages of the peripheral device 30 when a user enters a power<br>
recovery command of the peripheral device 30 using menu information. Also, the<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	9	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
monitoring/management unit 190 generates a second power-supply control command<br>
such that it recognizes used state information of the peripheral device 30 in real time,<br>
determines whether a specific peripheral device is used, and recovers a power-supply<br>
voltage applied to the specific peripheral device. The monitoring/management unit 190<br>
generates a third power-supply control command such that it determines whether an<br>
input signal is generated from the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12, recovers a power-<br>
supply voltage of the peripheral device 30 or selectively recovers only power-supply<br>
voltages of an unused peripheral device other than the used peripheral device 30. In the<br>
case of recovering a power-supply voltage of the peripheral device 30, the monitoring/<br>
management unit 190 displays a message indicative of a power-supply recovery on the<br>
computer monitor 20 until the peripheral device 30 recovers its power-supply voltage<br>
in a warm-up state.<br>
[37]	Also, if the monitoring/management unit 190 transmits a first power-supply control<br>
command, a second power-supply control command, a third power-supply control<br>
command, a fourth power-supply control command, or a fifth power-supply control<br>
command. In this case, the first power-supply control command is adapted to block a<br>
power-supply voltage of the computer monitor 20 upon receiving a power-supply<br>
blocking command of the computer monitor 20 from a user. The second power-supply<br>
control command is adapted to block a power-supply voltage from being applied to the<br>
computer monitor 20 on the condition that used state information of the computer<br>
monitor 20 is recognized in real time and the computer monitor 20 is in an idle state<br>
during a predetermined period. The third power-supply control command is adapted to<br>
block a power-supply voltage from being applied to the computer monitor 20 when a<br>
user powers off the computer monitor 20. The fourth power-supply control command<br>
is adapted to block a power-supply voltage from being applied to the computer<br>
monitor 20 when there is no input signal from the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12 during<br>
at least a predetermined time. The fifth power-supply control command is adapted to<br>
block a power-supply voltage from being applied to the computer monitor 20 if a<br>
screen saver or a monitor-off operation is activated according to power-supply setup<br>
information of the monitor 20 from among power-supply option information of the<br>
computer system.<br>
[381	Contrary to the above-mentioned cases, the monitoring/management unit 190<br>
determines whether an input signal is generated from the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12,<br>
recovers a power-supply voltage of the computer monitor 20 according to the<br>
determined result Otherwise, the monitoring/management unit 190 recognizes used<br><br>

state information(e.g., image data transmission from the computer 10, etc.) of the<br>
computer monitor 20 in real time, and recovers a power-supply voltage of the<br>
computer monitor 20 according to the recognized state information.<br>
[39]	Also, the monitoring/management unit 190 monitors state information of the<br>
computer 10 on the condition that the peripheral device 30 is powered off, generates a<br>
command for storing all current tasks if the computer 10 is in an unused state(e.g., no<br>
download, no file transmission, inactive program state, no data transmission to<br>
peripheral devices, etc.), stores the current tasks, and terminates the system. In this<br>
case, the monitoring/management unit 190 turns off an HDD or activates a system<br>
standby mode according to power-supply option information of a computer system<br>
before the system is terminated. Also, the monitoring/management unit 190 monitors<br>
state information of the computer 10 during a predetermined time, and terminates the<br>
system if the computer 10 is continuously in the unused state.<br>
[40]	Operations of the standby power control device according to the present invention<br>
will hereinafter be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 3.<br>
[41]	Fig. 2 is a flow chart illustrating a power control method for use in the monitoring/<br>
management unit contained in the standby power control device of Fig. 1 according to<br>
the present invention, and Fig. 3 is a flow chart illustrating a power control method for<br>
use in the microprocessor contained in the standby power control device of Fig. 1<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[42]	Prior to describing the present invention, the term "System Termination'br<br>
Power-Off state'is indicative of a specific state during which system operations are<br>
completely halted by a user who presses a power button of the system. In the case of<br>
the system termination or the power-off state, standby power is left in the system,<br>
resulting in the occurrence of power consumption. And, the other term "R&gt;wer-Supply<br>
Blocking State'is indicative of a specific state during which an input power source of<br>
the system is completely blocked, such that there is no power consumption during the<br>
power-supply blocking state. In other words, the power-supply blocking state<br>
corresponds to an unplugged state.<br>
[43]<br>
[44]	<device address setup><br>
[45]	Individual sockets 101 contained in the standby power control device 100 include<br>
unique designated addresses, respectively. Individual sockets 101 include pre-<br>
determined labels such that they are connected to individual plugs of unique peripheral<br>
devices 30, for example, a computer monitor 20, a speaker, and a printer, etc. If a plug<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	11	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
of one of the peripheral devices 30 is connected to a corresponding socket, an address<br>
of the peripheral device 30 is determined. This address determination of the peripheral<br>
device 30 is called a "defailt setup". In the meantime, provided that a user desires to<br>
freely establish an address of a specific peripheral device, the user may re-establish the<br>
address of the peripheral device 30 using the monitoring/management unit 190.<br>
[46]<br>
[47]	<method for controlling power-supply voltage of></method>
PERIPHERAL DEVICE USING MONITORING/MANAGEMENT UNIT&gt;<br>
[48]	The computer 10, the computer monitor 20, and the peripheral device 30 are<br>
connected to their designated sockets 101, respectively. The switching unit 140 is<br>
switched on to power on the computer 10, the computer monitor 20, and the peripheral<br>
device 30, and the computer 10 is booted, such that the system starts its operation.<br>
[49]	Under the above-mentioned situation, if a user selects a corresponding option menu<br>
to block a power-supply voltage from being applied to a specific peripheral device or<br>
all peripheral devices using the monitoring/management unit 190 at step S10, as shown<br>
in Fig. 2, the monitoring/management unit 190 determines which one of peripheral<br>
devices receives a power-supply blocking command at step SI 1, determines a flag of a<br>
corresponding peripheral device to be "1"at step SI2, and transmits an address of a<br>
corresponding peripheral device and a signal including a power-supply control<br>
command for blocking a power-supply voltage to the microprocessor 170 at step SI3.<br>
[50]	The monitoring/management unit 190 recognizes used state information of the<br>
peripheral device 30 in real time during a first period "periodF'at steps S20 and S21,<br>
and determines whether a specific peripheral device is in an idle state during a pre-<br>
determined time at step S22. If it is determined that the specific peripheral device is in<br>
the idle state at step S22, the monitoring/management unit 190 determines a flag of a<br>
corresponding peripheral device to be "F'at step S24, and enters a standby state daring<br>
a maximum standby state allowable time before blocking a power-supply voltage of<br>
the system at step S25. In this case, provided that the corresponding peripheral device<br>
is not in the idle state during the predetermined time and is actually used, the<br>
monitoring/management unit 190 determines a flag of the corresponding peripheral<br>
device to be "0"at step S23.<br>
[51]	Thereafter, the monitoring/management unit 190 determines whether the cor-<br>
responding peripheral device is not in use during a standby allowable time such as a<br>
second period denoted by "period2", namely, the monitoring/management unit 190<br>
determines whether the flag of the corresponding peripheral device maintains the value<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	12	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
of "1 "at steps S30 and S31. If it is determined that the flag of the corresponding<br>
peripheral device maintains the value of "1", the monitoring/management unit 190<br>
transmits an address of the corresponding peripheral device and a signal including a<br>
power-supply control command for blocking a power-supply voltage to the micro-<br>
processor at step S33. Otherwise, if it is determined that the flag of the corresponding<br>
peripheral device does not maintain the value of "1", the monitoring/management unit<br>
190 determines a flag of the corresponding peripheral device to be "0"at step S32.<br>
[52]	The monitoring/management unit 190 determines whether a user manually turns off<br>
the power-supply voltage of the peripheral device at step S40. If it is determined that<br>
the user manually turns off the power-supply voltage of the peripheral device at step<br>
S41, the monitoring/management unit 190 determines the flag of the corresponding<br>
peripheral device to be "l"at step S42, and transmits an address of the peripheral<br>
device and a signal including a power-supply control command for blocking a power-<br>
supply voltage to the microprocessor 170 at step S43.<br>
[53]	The monitoring/management unit 190 determines whether no input signal is<br>
received from the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12 at step S50, and determines whether<br>
the no input signal state is maintained during at least a predetermined time at step S51.<br>
If it is determined that the no input signal state is maintained during at least the pre-<br>
determined time at step S51, the monitoring/management unit 190 determines flags of<br>
all peripheral devices to be the value of T'at step S52, and transmits addresses of all<br>
peripheral devices and a signal including a power-supply control command for<br>
blocking a power-supply voltage to the microprocessor 170 at step S53.<br>
[541	Contrary to the above-mentioned operations, if the user enters a power-supply<br>
recovery command of the peripheral device 30 using menu information, the<br>
monitoring/management unit 190 transmits one of the following first to third power-<br>
supply control commands. The first power-supply control command selectively or si-<br>
multaneously recovers power-supply voltages of the peripheral device 30. The second<br>
power-supply control command recognizes used state information of the peripheral<br>
device 30 in real time, determines whether a specific peripheral device is used, and<br>
recovers a power-supply voltage of the corresponding peripheral device. The third<br>
power-supply control command determines whether an input signal is generated from<br>
the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12, recovers all power-supply voltages of all peripheral<br>
devices 30, or selectively recovers only power-supply voltages of unused peripheral<br>
devices 30 other than the used peripheral device 30.<br>
[551	However, in the case of a specific peripheral device, for example, a printer or a<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	13	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
scanner, an error message occurs when a power-supply voltage is not supplied to a<br>
peripheral device at the moment at which the computer transmits a service request to<br>
the peripheral device. In this case, if the peripheral device is in a warm-up state, the<br>
monitoring/management unit 190 displays a message indicative of a power-supply<br>
recovery, instead of the error message, on the computer monitor 20 until the power-<br>
supply recovery is finished (e.g., during a device power-supply recovery completion<br>
time), such that it allows a user to re-transmit a service request to the above peripheral<br>
device.<br>

[57]	<method for controlling power-supply voltage of></method>
PERIPHERAL DEVICE USING MICROPROCESSOR<br>
[58]	A method for controlling a power-supply voltage of the peripheral device using the<br>
microprocessor will hereinafter be described with reference to Fig. 3. Referring to Fig.<br>
3, if the monitoring/management unit 190 transmits a power-supply control command<br>
at step S100, the microprocessor 170 determines the number of responses to the<br>
power-supply control command to be "0"at step SI 10, analyzes a corresponding<br>
power-supply control command, and determines whether the analyzed power-supply<br>
control command is indicative of a power-supply blocking command at step S120. If<br>
the corresponding power-supply control command is determined to be the power-<br>
supply blocking command at step S120, the monitoring/management unit 190 analyzes<br>
a signal received from the interface unit 120 to recognize a peripheral device, a power-<br>
supply voltage of which is to be controlled, and controls the individual drive signal<br>
generator 180 to switch off the switch 141 of the switching unit 140 connected to the<br>
socket 101 to which a corresponding peripheral device is connected, such that it blocks<br>
a power-supply voltage from being applied to the peripheral device connected to the<br>
socket 101 at step S130. If the microprocessor 170 analyzes a corresponding power-<br>
supply control command, and determines the analyzed power-supply control command<br>
to be a power supply command at step S140, it controls the individual drive signal<br>
generator 180 to turn on the switch 141 of the switching unit 140 connected to the<br>
socket 101 to which a corresponding peripheral device is connected, and supplies a<br>
power-supply voltage to the peripheral device connected to the socket 101 at step 150.<br>
In more detail, the microprocessor 170 receives a power-supply recovery command of<br>
the user's peripheral device 30 from the monitoring/management unit 190 via the<br>
interface unit 120 on the condition that the peripheral device 30 is powered off, and<br>
receives a first power-supply command to selectively or simultaneously recover<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	14	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
power-supply voltages of the peripheral device 30, such that it selectively or simul-<br>
taneously recovers the power-supply voltages of the peripheral device 30. Also, the<br>
microprocessor 170 recognizes used state information of the peripheral device 30 in<br>
real time, determines whether a specific peripheral device is used, and receives a<br>
second power-supply control command to recover a power-supply voltage of the<br>
specific peripheral device, such that it selectively or simultaneously recovers the<br>
power-supply voltages of the peripheral device 30. Otherwise, the microprocessor 170<br>
determines whether an input signal is generated from the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12,<br>
and receives a third power-supply control command to recover a power-supply voltage<br>
of the peripheral device 30, such that it selectively or simultaneously recovers the<br>
power-supply voltages of the peripheral device 30.<br>
[59]	The microprocessor 170 detects the amount of load of the peripheral device 30<br>
using the individual load detector 150 as shown in the first period denoted by<br>
"period 1"of Fig. 3 at steps S200 and S210, compares the detected load with reference<br>
load, determines whether the detected load is less than the reference load at step S220,<br>
and blocks a power-supply voltage from being applied to the peripheral device 30.<br>
[601	The microprocessor 170 determines whether a response signal is received from the<br>
monitoring/management unit 190 as shown in the second period denoted<br>
by"period2'bf Fig. 3 at steps S300 and S310, and determines the presence or absence<br>
of at least three response signals at step S320. If the absence of at least three response<br>
signal is determined at step S320, the microprocessor 170 returns to step S230, such<br>
that it controls the individual drive signal generator 180 to turn off the switch 141 of<br>
the switching unit 140 connected to the socket 101 to which the peripheral device 30 is<br>
connected at step S230, thereby blocking a power-supply voltage from being applied<br>
to the peripheral device 30 connected to the socket 101.<br>

MONITOR&gt;<br>
[63]	A power-supply control method for use in a computer monitor using the<br>
monitoring/management unit and the microprocessor will hereinafter be described. The<br>
monitoring/management unit 190 transmits a power-supply control command to block<br>
a power-supply voltage from being applied to the computer monitor 20 when a user<br>
enters a power-supply blocking command of the computer monitor 20.<br>
[64]	The monitoring/management unit 190 recognizes used state information of the<br>
computer monitor 20 in real time, and transmits a first power-supply control command<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	15	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
to block a power-supply voltage from being applied to the computer monitor 20 when<br>
the computer monitor 20 is in an idle state during a predetermined time. If the user<br>
manually powers off the computer monitor 20, the monitoring/management unit 190<br>
transmits a second power-supply control command to block a power-supply voltage<br>
from being applied to the computer monitor 20. If an input signal is not received from<br>
the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12 during at least a predetermined time, the monitoring/<br>
management unit 190 transmits a third power-supply control command to block a<br>
power-supply voltage from being applied to the computer monitor 20.<br>
[65]	If a screen saver or a monitor-off operation is activated according to monitor<br>
power-supply setup information from among power-supply option information of the<br>
computer system, the monitoring/management unit 190 transmits a fourth power-<br>
supply control command to block a power-supply voltage from being applied to the<br>
computer monitor 20. In other words, if the user activates a system power-saving mode<br>
or a system protection mode (e.g., a monitor-off fimction or a screen saver function,<br>
etc., contained in a power-supply management program mounted to a computer<br>
equipped with the EnergyStar logo) using menu information, and selects an input<br>
power-supply blocking function of the computer monitor 20, the monitoring/<br>
management unit 190 completely blocks an input power-supply voltage from being<br>
applied to the computer monitor 20 in the system power-saving mode or the system<br>
protection mode.<br>
[66]	In the meantime, if the microprocessor 170 determines that a user does not use the<br>
computer monitor 20 during a long period of time on the basis of information received<br>
from the sensor 160 and the individual load detector 150, determines that the amount<br>
of load is less than reference load because the computer monitor 20 is powered off, or<br>
determines that an input signal is not received from the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12<br>
during at least a predetermined time, it blocks a power-supply voltage from being<br>
applied to the computer monitor 20.<br>
[67]	Contrary to the above-mentioned operations, the monitoring/management unit 190<br>
determines whether an input signal is received from the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12,<br>
recovers a power-supply voltage of the computer monitor 20 if it is determined that the<br>
input signal is received from the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12, recognizes used state<br>
information of the computer monitor 20 in real time, and recovers the power-supply<br>
voltage of the computer monitor 20 according to the recognized state information.<br>
[68]	If the user enters a desired input signal using the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12 such<br>
that the microprocessor 170 receives the user entry signal from the I/O terminal unit<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	16	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
130, or if the sensor 160 detects the presence of the user, the microprocessor 170<br>
recovers a power-supply voltage of the computer monitor 20. In other words, the mi-<br>
croprocessor 170 receives a power-supply recovery command of the user's computer<br>
monitor 20 from the monitoring/management unit 190 via the interface unit 120 on the<br>
condition that the computer monitor 20 is powered off, and receives a first power-<br>
supply command to selectively or simultaneously recover power-supply voltages of the<br>
peripheral device 30, such that it recovers the power-supply voltage of the computer<br>
monitor 20. Also, the microprocessor 170 recognizes used state information of the<br>
computer monitor 20 in real time, determines whether the computer monitor 20 is<br>
used, and receives a second power-supply control command to recover a power-supply<br>
voltage of the computer monitor 20, such that it recovers the power-supply voltage of<br>
the computer monitor 20. Otherwise, the microprocessor 170 determines whether an<br>
input signal is generated from the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12, and receives a third<br>
power-supply control command to recover a power-supply voltage of the computer<br>
monitor 20, such that it recovers the power-supply voltage of the computer monitor 20.<br>
[69]<br>
[701	<power-supply control method for use in computer><br>
[71]	A power-supply control method for use in the computer using the monitoring/<br>
management unit and the microprocessor will hereinafter be described. If all peripheral<br>
devices 30 are powered off, the microprocessor 170 transmits a first signal indicative<br>
of a peripheral device power-off message to the monitoring/management unit 190. The<br>
monitoring/management unit 190 directly recognizes used state information of the<br>
peripheral device 30 in real time, and may transmit a second signal indicative of a<br>
peripheral device power-off message when all the peripheral devices 30 are powered<br>
off.<br>
[72]	Upon receiving the above-mentioned first signal from the microprocessor 170, the<br>
monitoring/management unit 190 monitors state information of the computer 10 on the<br>
condition that all peripheral devices 30 are powered off, generates a command for<br>
storing all current tasks if the computer 10 is in an unused state, stores the current<br>
tasks, and terminates the system. In this case, the monitoring/management unit 190<br>
turns off an HDD or activates a system standby mode according to power-supply<br>
option information of a computer system before the system is terminated. Also, the<br>
monitoring/management unit 190 monitors state information of the computer 10 during<br>
a predetermined time, and terminates the system if the computer 10 is continuously in<br>
the unused state.<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	17	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
[73]	Until a predetermined second setup time elapses after all power-supply voltages of<br>
the peripheral devices 30 are completely powered off, if one or more peripheral<br>
devices are not in use and the computer 10 is in the unused state, the monitoring/<br>
management unit 190 may generate a command for storing current tasks, may store the<br>
current tasks, and may terminate the system. Also, the monitoring/management unit<br>
190 periodically monitors operation state information of the computer 10, and<br>
determines whether I/O signals are not generated during at least a predetermined time.<br>
If it is determined that the I/O signals are not generated daring at least the pre-<br>
determined time, the monitoring/management unit 190 may switch a current mode of<br>
the system to an HDD-off mode or a system standby mode.<br>
[74]	If the system is terminated, the microprocessor 170 recognizes a current state of the<br>
computer 10 using a power-supply blocking method equal to that of the peripheral<br>
device 30 and the computer monitor 20, such that it blocks a power-supply voltage<br>
from being applied to the computer 10. In more detail, the microprocessor 170<br>
recognizes the current state of the computer 10 using a method for recognizing the<br>
number of response signals, a method for comparing load quantities, signals received<br>
from the mouse and the keyboard, and signals received from the sensor, etc., such that<br>
it blocks a power-supply voltage from being applied to the computer 10. In the<br>
meantime, the microprocessor 170 may independently use the above-mentioned<br>
power-supply blocking method, such that it may perform a system termination<br>
function.<br>
[75]	Contrary to the above-mentioned operations, if a user enters a desired input signal<br>
using the mouse 11 or the keyboard 12 on the condition that the computer 10 is<br>
completely powered off such that the user entry signal is transmitted to the micro-<br>
processor 170 via the I/O terminal unit 130, or if the presence of the user is detected by<br>
the sensor 160, the computer 10 receives only the standby power. However, if the<br>
computer 10 is completely powered off, even the standby power is not present in the<br>
computer 10, such that the system is not powered on althogh the user presses the<br>
power switch (not shown) of the computer 10. In this case, there is a need to recover<br>
the standby power of the computer 10, such that only the standby power is temporarily<br>
supplied to the computer 10 if the sensor 160 determines that the user is seated in the<br>
front of a computer desk, or the standby power supplied to the computer 10 is blocked<br>
if the sensor 160 determines that the user leaves the above seat.<br>
[76]	In the meantime, in the case of using the above-mentioned standby power control<br>
device 100, a network-based power-supply control method is made available.<br><br>
WO 2006/052047	18	PCT/KR2004/003542<br>
[77]	In more detail, if a plurality of systems are contained in a single room and a specific<br>
management system is also contained in the same room, the management system may<br>
completely block a power-supply voltage from being applied to a plurality of<br>
computers and their peripheral devices. Also, the management system transmits a<br>
message to the standby power control device 100, which is independently used or is<br>
used for every group, such that it may block an input power-supply voltage from being<br>
applied to the computer or its peripheral devices connected to the standby power<br>
control device 100. The above-mentioned operations may be used to allow schools,<br>
companies, or private educational institutes to simultaneously control the power-<br>
supply voltages of their computers or peripheral devices.<br>
[78]	Also, the standby power control device 100 according to the present invention may<br>
be used as a system for automatically controlling a power-supply voltage of the entire<br>
building. In more detail, the monitoring/management unit is installed in a central<br>
server for a network system, the standby power control device 100 is designed to have<br>
a box-shaped high capacity, individual computers, peripheral devices, or computer/<br>
peripheral device groups are connected to the standby power control device 100, such<br>
that a power-supply management operation and other control operations for the entire<br>
building may be made available.<br>
Industrial   Applicability<br>
[79]	As apparent from the above description, the present invention provides a standby<br>
power control device for monitoring state information of peripheral devices connected<br>
to a computer and a current state of the computer, and controlling power-supply<br>
voltages of the peripheral devices and the computer according to the monitoring result,<br>
such that it reduces the amount of power consumed for either an idle time during<br>
which a user does not actually use the computer and at least one peripheral device due<br>
to his or her mealtime, conference, settlement, and outing, etc. after the computer and<br>
the peripheral devices are powered on, or a standby time after the system is terminated,<br>
and reduces power consumption of the remaining unused peripheral devices even<br>
when one or more peripheral devices are used, resulting in the implementation of<br>
complete power-saving effect.<br>
[80]	Also, the present invention provides a standby power control device for efficiently<br>
reducing the amount of standby power of the computer and its peripheral devices on<br>
the condition that the user powers off the computer to leave his or her office or to fall<br>
asleep.<br>
