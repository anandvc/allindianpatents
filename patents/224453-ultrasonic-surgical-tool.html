				<td>ULTRASONIC SURGICAL TOOL<br>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic surgical tool. More particularly, but not<br>
exclusively :t relates to a tool for use in a laparoscopic cutting/coagulating system, which is<br>
adapted to w.t soft material such as flesh or blood vessels<br>
Such tool are known from our co-pending international application number<br>
PCT/GB99/C0162 This application describes an apparatus adapted to utilise ultrasonic<br>
vibrations in a torsional mode, and this is preferred for the present invention However, the<br>
present invention is not limited to torsional mode vibrations.<br>
The above application describes an apparatus in which the ultrasonic vibrations are<br>
transmitted nlong an elongate waveguide to a distal end provided with cutting and/or<br>
coagulating reans A shroud surrounds the waveguide and is isolated from the vibration<br>
thereof The cutting and/or coagulating means comprises a torsionally vibratable clement<br>
connected to the waveguide in combination with a static non-vibratable element connected to<br>
the shroud This static element roay be brought into and out of engagement with the<br>
vibratable element by means of an actuating rod extending concentrically within or as part of<br>
the shroud The actuating rod is connected at its proximal end to a scissors grip or other type<br>
of operating mechanism.<br>
One disadvantage of such systems lies in the fact that, at the distal end of the apparatus, it<br>
comprises a waveguide, surrounded coaxially by an actuating rod which in turn is surrounded<br>
coaxially by the shroud. When operating on a patient, bodily fluids at positive pressures may<br>
find their way into these concentric spaces, as may some body solids It is then very difficuli:<br>
to clean the apparatus. It would be advantageous if it were to be possible to detach and<br>
discard the shroud and actuating rod to be replaced by a fresh combination<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an ultrasonic surgical tool which is provided<br>
with a disposable shroud system which can be easily and quickly detached from the apparatus<br>
and replace 1 quickly and easily by a replacement shroud<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a surgical tool<br>
comprising means to generate ultrasonic vibrations, a waveguide operatively connected at a<br>
proximal etui to said generating means and extending to a distal end provided with cutting<br>
and/or coagulating means, shroud means adapted to surround and isolate said waveguide, and<br>
actuating md means coextensive with said shroud means, said shroud means and said<br>
actuating rod means being detachably connected at their proximal ends to said generating<br>
means.<br>
Preferably, said generating means comprises a conversion horn and at least one axial mode<br>
driver mounted substantially tangentially thereto, whereby torsional mode vibrations are<br>
produced<br>
The cutting and/or coagulating means may comprise a torsionally vibratabJe element<br>
connected n said waveguide in combination with a static non-vibratabie element which is so<br>
mounted to said shroud means that it is isolated from said ultrasonic vibrations<br>
The actuating rod means may be so connected at its distal end to said static element as to<br>
cause pivoed movement thereof into and out of engagement with said vibratabJe element<br>
The actuaing rod means may be detachably connected at its proximal end to manually<br>
operable means, optionally a pair of scissors type grips connected by rack and pinion mears<br>
to said actuating rod means<br>
The actuiiing rod means preferably comprises a tubular member surrounding said<br>
waveguide<br>
The sbroud means may also comprise a tubular member and in this case one of the tubular<br>
members r. ay be polygonal in cross-section and be adapted to contact an inner surface of the<br>
other tubunr member, which is substantially cylindrical only at apices of said polygon<br>
The shrouc means and actuating rod means may be detachably connected together to said<br>
generating means by a connector means.<br>
This conieotor means may be a nut and may also comprise a projecting detent resiliency<br>
deformable cut of engagement to allow separation<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a shroud means<br>
including acuating rod means for detachable connection to a surgical tool including a<br>
waveguide opcratively connected at a proximal end to means to generate ultrasonic<br>
vibrations<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will now be more particularly described by way of<br>
example and with reference to the accompany drawing, in which: -<br>
Figure 1 shows a tool embodying the present invention in separated condition<br>
Referring now to the drawing, the ultrasonic surgical tool comprises a handle section,<br>
including a chassis 1, right 2 and left 3 connecting rods, which are attached respectively tc<br>
right 6 and left 7 handlebows The configuration of these bows is not critical and othei<br>
variations are possible, such as are described in our co-pending UK patent application<br>
number 9906701.9. The bows 6 and 7 are connected to the chassis 1 by means of respective<br>
pivot pins 8 and 9 and connecting rod drive pins 10 and 11<br>
An ultrasor to piezo electric ceramic transducer 14 is mounted tangentially to a conversion<br>
horn 12 to form a generator of ultrasonic vibrations in torsional mode. Such vibrations are<br>
transmitted to waveguide 13 which has at its distal end a vibratable pan of the cutting and/or<br>
coagulating means 22 The generator 12. 14 is mounted to the chassis 1.<br>
An outer throud 16 acting as an actuating rod is adapted to surround an inner shroud 15, the<br>
pair being isolated from the waveguide 13 by PTFE bushes 18 and 19 at proximal and distal<br>
ends of the combined shroud. Both shrouds are preferably thin walled tubes of stainless<br>
steel, although other materials may be used. The shrouds 15, 16 are connected to the chassis<br>
via the inter tabular member 15 of the shroud which may be connected to a quick release<br>
mechanisni - which is itself attached to chassis 1. A flexible protruding tongue 21 of the<br>
inner shroud 15 is biased to spring outwardly so that, once the tube has been inserted into the<br>
quick release member 4, it will maintain the inner shroud 15 locked in position When butron<br>
20 on the rember 4 is depressed, the tongue 21 becomes disengaged which enables the inner<br>
shroud 15 o be detached from the release member 4. In order to prevent accidental<br>
disengagen ?nt. a nut 5 engages around the outer shroud 16 to hold both that and the inner<br>
shroud 15 to engagement with the quick release member 4<br>
A hinged aw 17 is attached to be supported by the inner shroud 15 and actuated by<br>
movement of the outer shroud 16, or alternatively to be supported by the outer shroud )6 md<br>
actuated by movement of the inner shroud 15.<br>
In use, once the concentric spaces between the waveguide 13 and inner 15 and outer l6<br>
shroud menbers have become clogged with body fluids or solids, the assembly of inner 15<br>
and outer 16 shroud members and jaw 17 may be removed from the handle and generator by<br>
unscrewing the nut 5 and depressing the button 20 They may then be discarded.<br>
