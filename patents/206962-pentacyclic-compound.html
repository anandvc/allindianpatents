PENTACYCLIC COMPOUND<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel taxol derivative having an antitumor activity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Taxol is a natural compouNd having the following chemical structure, which can be obtained in a small amount from a trunk or the like of Taxus brevifolia.<br><br>
It is known that taxol has an antitumor acti^vi^^ its action mechanism is based on the depolymerization inhibition action of microtubule during cell division, so that its clinical application is expected as an antitumor agent which is different from the general antitumor agents.<br>
Though taxol can be obtained only in an extremely small amount from a natural source, reports have been published recently on the synthesis of taxol derivatives using a starting material 10-O-deacethylbaccatin III<br><br>
represented by the following structural formula:<br><br>
which is a taxol precursor that can be obtained in a relatively large amount from leaves and the like of taxaceous trees (cf. JP-A-3-505725; the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application"). Of such derivatives, a compound (Taxotere™) represented by the following structural formula:<br><br><br>
has been drawing attention as a compound which has an antitumor activity similar to or higher than that of taxol and is now under development as an antitumor agent.<br>
Though taxol and Taxotere™ are promising compounds as antitumor agents, their clinical tests have revealed that they have low efficacy on digestive organ cancers, especially large bowel cancers, so that great concern has been directed toward the development of a derivative having more strong antitumor effects.<br>
The 9-position of taxol derivatives is generally a keto group, but some derivatives in which this position is reduced are also known-  A compound having an α-configuration hydroxyl group at the 9-position has been obtained from a natural source, and various 9-position α-hydroxyl group type derivatives obtained by chemical modification of the compound have been reported (for example, see J- Med.   Chem. ,   37_,   2655 (1994)).  Also, it is known that a compound having a β-configuration hydroxyl group at the 9-position can be synthesized chemically by reducing 10-O-deacethylbaccatin III using a reducing agent, and various 9-position i3-hydroxyl group type derivatives obtained by chemical modification of the compound have been reported (for example, see WO 94/20088).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
As a result of extensive investigation, the inventors of the present invention have found that the antitumor<br><br>
activity of the aforementioned 9-position β-hydroxyl group type taxol derivative sharply increases when its 9-position hydroxyl group and 10-position hydroxyl group are converted into cyclic acetal type.  The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding.<br>

The following describes production process of the compound of the present invention.  In the practice of the reaction, the substituent groups may be protected with protecting groups if desired, and conversion sequence of each substituent group is not particularly limited.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
derived from 10-O-deacetylbaccatin III (a compound (1)) to react with an aldehyde or ketone represented by R14C(=o)R15 or an acetal represented by R14R15C(oR45)2 (R45 is methyl or the like alkyl group) in the presence of an acid catalyst such as 10-camphorsulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid or the like. Next, a compound (4) is obtained by condensing the 13-position hydroxyl group of the compound (3) with a compound (A), (B) or (C) in accordance with respective ordinary method already reported.<br>
As the condensation reaction with the compound (A) or (B), a method is known in which a carboxylic acid activating agent such as di(2-pyridyl) carbonate or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide is used in the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine or the like base catalyst.  In this connection, when the compound (A) is used, Z12 and Z21 become a combination of hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group.<br>
As the condensation reaction with the compound (C), a method is known in which sodium hexamethyldisilazide or the like base is used.<br>
At this stage of reaction, the compound (A), (B) or (C) will react with the 7-position hydroxyl group of compound (3) in some cases.  In that case, the product of interest can be separated and purified by a silica gel column chromatography or the like means.  Alternatively, since a compound (5) in which a protecting group is introduced selectively into the 7-position of compound (3) can be<br><br>
obtained by selecting proper protecting group and reaction conditions (a high selectivity is obtained especially in the case of a carbamate type protecting group, for example, the 7-position can be selectively protected with 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl group by carrying out the reaction with 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl chloride in pyridine at 0°C), the compound (4) may be synthesized by condensing the 13-position hydroxyl group of this compound (5) with the compound (A), (B) or (C) in the same manner as described above.  The compound (5) can also be obtained by another method in which the 13-position hydroxyl group of compound (3) is converted into ketone using manganese dioxide or the like oxidizing agent, a protecting group is introduced into the 7-position hydroxyl group of the resulting compound to obtain a compound (6), followed by reducing the 13-position ketone again into hydroxyl group using a sodium borohydride or the like reducing agent.<br>
After conversion or deprotection of each substituent group of the thus obtained compound (4) as occasion demands, the compound (I) of interest can be obtained by converting<br><br>
respectively.  Such conversion and deprotection can be carried out by using general techniques of organic chemistry, such as the following examples.<br><br>
Conversion of the 2-position benzoyl group into CORA can be effected, for example, in accordance with a method described in a literature (Tetrahedron  Letter,   35,   8931 (1994)) in which the 2-position ester bond is selectively hydrolyzed and then acylated, by which a compound whose R^ is other than a phenyl group is obtained.<br>
Conversion of the 4-position acetyl group into COR2 can be effected, for example, in accordance with a method in which a reaction with a compound represented by R21-X (R21 represents an alkyl group, an alkenyl group or an aryl group and X represents a halogen atom such as iodine atom, bromine atom or the like or a leaving group such as methanesulfonyl group, p-toluenesulfonyl group or the like) is carried out in the presence of sodium hexamethyldisilazide or the like base at a temperature of from -100°C to room temperature, thereby obtaining a compound whose R2 is other than a methyl group.<br>
The compound whose R2 is other than a methyl group can also be obtained by allowing the compound (6) to react with the compound represented by R21-X in the presence of sodium hexamethyldisilazide or the like base to obtain a compound in which the 4-position acetyl group is converted into COR2, subsequently reducing the 13-position hydroxyl group and finally carrying out condensation reaction with the compound (A), (B) or (C).<br>
Conversion of the 7-position hydroxyl group into R3<br>
can be effected by various methods depending on the type of<br><br>
R3-  A compound in which R3 is hydrogen can be obtained by removing the 7-position hydroxyl group by a known method (for example, see J.   Org.   Chem,,   58, 5028 (1993)),  A compound in which R3 is -OC(=O)R31 can be obtained by acylating the 7-position hydroxyl group using a carboxylic acid or an acid chloride based on general techniques of organic chemistry.  A compound in which R3 is -OC(=O)NQ1Q2 (Q2 and Q2 are independently a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group) can be obtained by a method in which the 7-position hydroxyl group is allowed to react with a compound represented by C1C(=O)0R32 (R32 is p-nitropheyl or the like aryl group) and then with an amine, to react with phosgene in the presence of an amine, to react with a compound represented by C1C(=O)NQ1Q2 (Q1 and Q2 are independently a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group) or to react with an isocyanate represented by R31N=C=O.  Conversion into R3 of interest can also be made by converting the 7-position hydroxyl group and then carrying out several steps of organochemical conversion.<br>
In another process, a compound (9) is obtained by protecting the 13-position hydroxyl group of compound (5) with a protecting group R11 which can be distinguished from the protecting group R10, removing R10 to obtain a compound (8), converting the 7-position hydroxyl group of compound (8) into R13 in the same manner as described in the foregoing and then removing the protecting group R11.  Thereafter, the 13-position hydroxyl group of compound (9) is condensed with the<br><br>
compound (A), (B) or (C), and then conversion and deprotection of various substituent groups are carried out to obtain the compound (I) of interest.  In this connection, the compound (8) can be synthesized directly from the compound (3) by selecting proper protecting group R11  and reaction conditions, and the compound (9) can also be synthesized directly from the compound (3) by conversion of the 7-position hydroxyl group.<br>
A compound of interest whose R^ is a halogen atom, for example, a compound whose R^ is fluorine atom, can be obtained by treating a compound having a hydroxyl group at the 7-position with diethylaminosulfur trifluoride in tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, ethyl ether, toluene, 1,1-dimethoxyethane or a mixture solvent thereof.<br>
The compound (8) can also be synthesized from a compound (D) which is obtained from the compound (1).  That is, the 13-position hydroxyl group of compound (D) is protected with the protecting group R11 which can be distinguished from 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl group, 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl groups at the 7- and 10-positions are removed, and then the thus obtained compound is treated with a reducing agent such as tetrabutylammonium borohydride or the like to convert the 9-position ketone into hydroxyl group and allowed to react with an aldehyde, a ketone or an acetal in the same manner as described in the foregoing, thereby obtaining the compound (8).<br><br>

Compound (D): Tetrahedron,   4_2, 4451 (1986) and others. Compound (A): Tetrahedron Letter,  ^, 5185 (1992) and others. Compound (B): J, Am.   Chem.   Soc.,   110, 5917 (1988) and others. Compound (C): Tetrahedron Letter,   3±,   4149 (1993) and others.<br>
In the above synthesis methods, compounds in which the 7-position has |3-configuration are obtained in general. Since it is known that configuration of the 7-position hydroxyl group is isomerized from β to a when a taxol derivative in which the 9-position is keto group and the 7-position is not protected is treated with a base, a compound having a-configuration at the 7-position can be synthesized by reducing the 9-position keto group into a hydroxyl group after isomerization,<br>
