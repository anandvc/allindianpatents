Figs. 7 and 8 show the conventional sunshade operating rope (13) having a plurality of beads (15) attached on the primary rope (14) and arranged with equidistant intervals. The bead has desirably formed a spherical or cylindrical shape, or other suitable shapes. Figs. 7(a) and 8(a) show the sunshade operating rope (13) with a plurality of spherically shaped beads being attached on the primary rope. Figs. 7(b) and 8(b) show the sunshade operating rope (13) with a plurality of cylindrically shaped beads being attached on the primary rope. Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The sunshade operating rope (3) of the present invention is designed to have a function of indicating the operational direction on the plurality of beads (5). The primary rope (4) is pierced through the center of the beads (5). The cross section of the bead (5) has different<br>
3<br><br>
width at top and bottom with respect to the center. A plurality of beads (5) attached on the operating rope is aligned in series for indicating an operating direction.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a sunshade operating rope according to the first embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 2 also illustrates a front view of a detailed bead integrally formed with a directional indicator and attached on an operating rope.<br>
A sunshade operating rope (3) of the present invention comprises a primary rope (4) and a plurality of beads (5). The plurality of beads (5) is arranged with equidistant interval and fixed on the primary rope (4). A directional indicator is disposed either top or bottom of the bead (5) and aligned in series with equidistant intervals to point an operating direction. The size of directional indicator (5a) is relatively smaller than that of beads (5) with respect to the cross sectional area.<br>
In order to easily grasp the bead with soft touching, the bead is desirably formed a spherical or cylindrical shape, or possibly formed other suitable shapes. Figs. 1(a) and 2(a) illustrate the sunshade operating rope (3) with a plurality of spherically shaped beads being attached on the primary rope. Figs. 1(b) and 2(b) illustrate the sunshade operating rope (3) with a plurality of cylindrically shaped beads being attached on the primary rope.<br>
In the first embodiment, the plurality of beads (5) is integrally formed with the directional indicators (5a) as a solid piece. The directional indicator (5a) disposed either top end or bottom end of the beads (5) has a conical shape for pointing an operating direction.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the sunshade operating rope (3) of the present invention is wound on a sprocket (2) of clutch. Herein, the directional indicators (5a) being integrally formed with the beads (5) are aligned on the sunshade operating rope (3) to indicate an operating direction in a manner of pointing downward for opening direction or pointing upward for closing direction.<br>
4<br><br>
Therefore, the pointing of the directional indicator (5a) indicates a specific operating direction. When a user wants to open the sunshade, the user is able to easily and correctly distinguish the opening direction of the operating rope (3) with pointing downward (A) of the directional indicator (5a). When a user wants to close the sunshade, the user is able to easily and correctly distinguish the closing direction of the operating rope (3) with pointing upward (B) of the directional indicator (5a).<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a bead and directional indicator being attached on an operating rope of the second embodiment of the present invention. In the second embodiment, a bead (5) and directional indicator (5a) are separately and closely disposed on the operating rope (3). Fig. 4(a) illustrates the sunshade operating rope (3) with a plurality of spherically shaped beads (5) and directional indicators (5a) being separately attached on the primary rope. Fig. 4(b) illustrates the sunshade operating rope (3) with a plurality of cylindrically shaped beads (5) and directional indicators (5a) being separately attached on the primary rope (3).<br>
As shown in the first embodiment, the directional indicator (5a) integrally disposed either top or bottom of the bead (5) has a conical shape for pointing a specific operating direction. However, in the second embodiment, the directional indicator (5a) and bead (5) are separately and closely disposed each other on the operating rope (3). The directional indicator (5a) has identical shape with the bead (5). But, the size of the directional indicator (5a) is much smaller than that of the bead (5). As shown in Fig. 4(a), the bead (5) and directional indicator (5a) having spherical shape with different size are disposing separately and closely each other on the operating rope (3) for indicating a specific operating direction. Fig. 4(b) illustrates the bead (5) and directional indicator (5a) having cylindrical shape with different size are disposing separately and closely on the operating rope (3) for indicating a specific operating direction.<br><br><br>
As mentioned before, it is possible to use any shape of directional indicator (5a) for indicating a specific operating direction. For example, the directional indicator (5a) could be formed with a conical, spherical, cylindrical, semi-spherical or oval shape for indicating a specific operating direction.<br>
Figs. 5. and 6 illustrate a sunshade operating rope with a particular shape of directional indicator (5 a) according to the third embodiment of the present invention. Contrast the first embodiment having a directional indicator (5a) integrally disposed either top or bottom of the bead (5) and second embodiment having a bead (5) and directional indicator (5a) separately disposed either top or bottom of the bead (5), the third embodiment is adopted a particular shape having a combined function of directional indicator (5a) and bead (5) as a solid piece. In the third embodiment, a top surface of the particular bead (5) could be an equilateral triangle. The lateral surface of the particular bead (5) could be an equilateral triangle or trapezoidal shape having relatively shorter width at the opposite side of the top surface. Then, the sunshade operating rope (3) passes through a center of the particular bead (5) for indicating a specific operating direction.<br>
As shown in Fig.5, the bead (5) has a regular tetrahedron with equilateral triangles. However, a conical shape is possibly used for a particular bead (5). Herein, a cross section of the particular bead (5) has either an equilateral triangle or trapezoidal shape. Therefore, it is possible to indicate a specific operational direction with the particular bead (5) as a solid piece.<br>
Consequently, the present invention has an effect to easily distinguish the proper operating direction by glancing the pointing of directional indicators being attached on an operating rope. Therefore, when a user wants to operate the sunshade, the user is able to easily and correctly distinguish the proper side of the sunshade operating rope for pulling the<br>
6<br><br>
desired direction due to the pointing of the directional indicator (5a).<br>
While the present invention has been described in detail with its preferred embodiments, it will be understood that further modifications are possible. The present application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses or adaptations of the invention following the general principles thereof, and includes such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains within the limits of the appended claims.<br>
