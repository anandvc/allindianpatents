				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SHARING USER INFORMATION IN A GROUP COMMUNICATION NETWORK<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001]	The   present   invention   relates   to   point-to-point   or   point-to-multipoint<br>
communications systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to methods and apparatus for detecting, sharing, and/or announcing user presence and/or location information in a group wireless communication network.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	A class of wireless services intended for quick, efficient, one-to-one or one-to-<br>
many (group) communication has existed in various forms for many years. In general, these services have been half-duplex, where a user presses a "push-to-talk" (PIT) button on a phone/radio to initiate a group communication. If granted the floor, the talker then generally speaks for a few seconds. After the talker releases the PTT button, other users who are available may request the floor. These services have traditionally been used in applications where one person needs to communicate with a group of people, such as field service personnel or taxi drivers, generally known as group communication services.<br>
[0003]	There is a need, therefore, for mechanisms that allow a user or a group of users<br>
to efficiently detect or announce information, such as user presence and/or location information, to other user or group of users.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004]	The disclosed embodiments provide novel and improved methods and apparatus<br>
for detecting and or announcing user presence and/or location information in a wireless communication network. In one aspect, the method for sharing user information in a wireless communication network includes sending an alert from an originator to a target, the alert including information about the originator and requesting information about the target, receiving information by the originator from the target in response to the alert, and updating information in the originator about the target, based on the received information.<br>
[0005]	In another aspect, the method includes sending at least one alert from an<br>
originator requesting information about at least one target user, receiving information by<br><br>
the originator in response to the alert, and updating information by the originator about the target user, based on information received.<br>
[0006]	In one  aspect,  an  apparatus  for sharing  user information  in a wireless<br>
communication network includes a memory unit, a receiver, a transmitter, and a processor communicatively coupled with the memory unit, the receiver, and the transmitter. The processor is capable of carrying out the above-mentioned methods.<br>

group of users.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0013]	Before several embodiments are explained in detail, it is to be understood that<br>
the scope of the invention should not be limited to the details of the construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
[0014]	FIG. 1 illustrates a functional block diagram of a group communication system<br>
100, for implementing one embodiment. Group communication system 100 is also known as a push-to-talk (PTT) system, a net broadcast service (NBS), a dispatch system, or a point-to-multi-point communication system. In one embodiment, group communication system 100 includes a group communication server (GCS) 102, which may be deployed in either a centralized deployment or a regionalized deployment. Group communication server 102 may be implemented as known in the art, including<br><br>
one or more processor, one or more memory units, and input/out hardware and software modules for various media communications, e.g., IP media communication.<br>
[0015]	Group communication devices (CDs) 104 and 106, which may be deployed such<br>
as CDMA (e.g., cdma2000) handsets, for example, may request packet data sessions using a data service option. Each CD may use the session to register its Internet protocol (IP) address with the group communication server to perform group communication initiations. In one embodiment, group communication server 102 is connected to the service provider's packet data service nodes (PDSNs) through service provider's network 116. CDs 104 and 106, upon requesting packet data sessions from the wireless infrastructure, may have IP connectivity to group communication server 102 through the PDSNs 114. Each PDSN may interface to a base station controller (BSC) through a packet control function (PCF) 108 and a network 112. The PCF may be co-located with the BSC within a base station (BS) 110.<br>
[0016]	A packet data service node may fall in one of several states, e.g.. active or<br>
connected state, dormant state, and null or inactive state. In the active or connected state, a active traffic channel exists between the participating CD and the BS or BSC, and either side may send data, hi the dormant state, no active traffic channel exists between the participating CD and the BSC, but a point-to-point protocol (PPP) link is maintained between the participating CD and the PDSN. In the null or inactive state, there is no active traffic channel between the participating CD and the BSC, and no PPP link is maintained between the participating CD and the PDSN.<br>
[0017]	Each one of CDs 104 and 106 may request packet data sessions.   As part of<br>
establishing a packet data session, each CD may be assigned an IP address. Each CD may perform a registration process to notify group communication server 102 of the CD's IP address. Registration may be performed using an IP protocol, such as session initiation protocol (SIP) over user datagram protocol (UDP). The IP address of a CD may be used to contact the CD when the corresponding user is invited into or informed of a group communication.<br>
[0018]	Once a group communication is established, CDs 104 and 106 and group<br>
communication server 102 may exchange media and signaling messages. In one embodiment, media may be exchanged between the participating CDs and the group communication server by using real-time protocol (RTF) over UDP. The signaling messages may also be exchanged by using a signaling protocol over UDP.<br><br>
[0019]	Group communication system 100 performs several different functions in order<br>
to operate group communication services. The functions that relate to the user side include user registration, group communication initiation, group communication termination, sending messages to group participants, late join to a group communication, talker arbitration, adding members to a group, removing members from a group, un-registering a member, and user authentication. The functions that relate to system preparation and operation include administration and provisioning, scalability, and reliability.<br>
[0020]	FIG. 2 illustrates a group communication arrangement 200 for showing how<br>
CDs 202, 204, and 206 interact with a group communication server 208. Multiple group communication servers may be deployed as desired for large-scale groups. A user may input her desire to a CD 202, 204, 206 to initiate a communication session for exchanging communication media, e.g., data, voice, image, and/or video, with one or more CDs. In one embodiment, the user may first invite the target users(s) before starting to communicate media, by pushing an "invite" or a PTT button on a CD.<br>
[0021]	In FIG. 2, when CD 202 has permission to transmit media to other members of<br>
the group, CD 202 is known as the originator and may transmit media over an established channel. When CD 202 is designated as the originator, the remaining participants, CD 204 and CD 206, may not be permitted to transmit media to the group. Accordingly, CD 204 and CD 206 are designated as targets. As described above, CDs 202, 204, and 206 are connected to group communication server 208, using at least one channel. In one embodiment, channels 210, 212, and 214 may include a session initiation protocol (SIP) channel, a media-signaling channel, and a media traffic channel.<br>
[0022]	FIG. 3 is a simplified block diagram of one embodiment of an infrastructure<br>
including a base station/base station controller (BS/BSC) 304 and a communication device 306, which are capable of implementing various disclosed embodiments. For a particular media communication, voice, data, packet data, and/or alert messages may be exchanged between BS/BSC 304 and communication device 306, via an air interface 308. Various types of messages may be transmitted, such as messages used to establish a communication session between the base station and the communication device, registration and paging messages, and messages used to control a data transmission (e.g., power control, data rate information, acknowledgment, and so on). Some of these message types are described in further detail below.<br><br>
 [0023]	For the reverse link, at communication device 306, voice and/or packet data<br>
(e.g., from a data source 310) and messages (e.g., from a controller 330) are provided to a transmit (TX) data processor 312, which formats and encodes the data and messages with one or more coding schemes to generate coded data. Each coding scheme may include any combination of cyclic redundancy check (CRC), conventional, turbo, block, and other coding, or no coding at all. The voice, packet data, and messages may be coded using different schemes, and different types of messages may be coded differently.<br>
[0024]	The coded data is then provided to a modulator (MOD) 314 and further<br>
processed (e.g., covered, spread with short PN sequences, and scrambled with a long PN sequence assigned to the communication device). The modulated data is then provided to a transmitter unit (TMTR) 316 and conditioned (e.g., converted to one or more analog signals, amplified, filtered, and quadrature modulated) to generate a reverse link signal. The reverse link signal is routed through a duplexer (D) 318 and transmitted via an antenna 320 to BS/BSC 304.<br>
[0025]	At BS/BSC 304, the reverse link signal is received by an antenna 350, routed<br>
through a duplexer 352, and provided to a receiver unit (RCVR) 354. Alternatively, the antenna may be part of the wireless operator network, and the connection between the antenna and the BS/BSC may be routed through the Internet. BS/BSC 304 may receive media information and alert messages from communication device 306. Receiver unit 354 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, down converts, and digitizes) the received signal and provides samples. A demodulator (DEMOD) 356 receives and processes (e.g., despreads, decovers, and pilot demodulates) the samples to provide recovered symbols. Demodulator 356 may implement a rake receiver that processes multiple instances of the received signal and generates combined symbols. A receive (RX) data processor 358 then decodes the symbols to recover the data and messages transmitted on the reverse link. The recovered voice/packet data is provided to a data sink 360 and the recovered messages may be provided to a controller 370. Controller 370 may include instructions for receiving and sending alerts, and receiving and sending responses to alerts. The processing by demodulator 356 and RX data processor 358 are complementary to that performed at remote access device 306. Demodulator 356 and RX data processor 358 may further be operated to process multiple transmissions received via multiple channels, e.g.. a reverse fundamental channel (R-FCH) and a reverse supplemental channel (R-SCH). Also, transmissions may be simultaneously<br><br>
from multiple communication devices, each of which may be transmitting on a reverse fundamental channel, a reverse supplemental channel, or both.<br>
[0026]	On the forward link, at BS/BSC 304, voice and/or packet data (e.g., from a data<br>
source 362) and messages (e.g., from controller 370) are processed (e,g., formatted and encoded) by a transmit (TX) data processor 364, further processed (e.g., covered and spread) by a modulator (MOD) 366, and conditioned (e.g., converted to analog signals, amplified, filtered, and quadrature modulated) by a transmitter unit (TMTR) 368 to generate a forward link signal. The forward link signal is routed through duplexer 352 and transmitted via antenna 350 to remote access device 306. Forward link signals include paging signals.<br>
[0027]	At communication device 306, the forward link signal is received by antenna<br>
320, routed through duplexer 318, and provided to a receiver unit 322. Receiver unit 322 conditions (e.g., down converts, filters, amplifies, quadrature modulates, and digitizes) the received signal and provides samples. The samples are processed (e.g., despreaded, decovered, and pilot demodulated) by a demodulator 324 to provide symbols, and the symbols are further processed (e.g., decoded and checked) by a receive data processor 326 to recover the data and messages transmitted on the forward link. The recovered data is provided to a data sink 328, and the recovered messages may be provided to controller 330. Controller 330 may include instructions for receiving and sending alerts, receiving and sending responses to alerts, keeping status information about other users in a designated group of users, and updating status information.<br>
[0028]	A user or a group of users may detect or announce user information, such as<br>
user-presence, user availability, and/or user-location information, to other user or group of users, without placing a call, establishing a communication session, or burdening the server. In one embodiment, each user may alert members of a designated group when the user becomes available, e.g., the user goes online. This would eliminate the configuration problems associated with server-based solutions. Users may configure their group lists, as users may belong to multiple groups, and switch between groups, without requiring configuration changes at the server, according to one embodiment.<br>
[0029]	In one embodiment, user presence and/or location detection is announced<br>
through point-to-point alerts or group alerts (point-to-multipoint) on power up (Hello) and shutdown (Bye). Additional alerts may be sent periodically to detect if a user has has become unavailable without sending a uBye" (e.g., to detect power or coverage loss).<br><br>
 [0030]	For example, using user-initiated point-to-point alerts, user A sends a "Hello"<br>
alert, on power up, to the rest of members in a designated group (e.g., A, B, and C). If a point-to-point guaranteed delivery alert is used, user A receives an "Ack" alert if the alert is successfully delivered, or a "Nak" alert if it isn't. If an Ack alert is received from user B and a Nak alert is received from user C, user A figures out that user B is already online and user C is not. When user B, who is already online, receives a Hello alert from user A, user B determines that user A has come online. Later, when user A goes offline, user A sends a "Bye" message to users B and C. When user B receives the "Bye" message from user A, user B determines that user A is no longer online.<br>
[0031]	FIGS. 4(A) and 4(B) illustrate flow diagrams for announcing and/or sharing<br>
presence and/or location information, according to one embodiment. User A may select a member list from a directory of stored individual and/or group member lists, and presses a burton (e.g., the PIT burton) on his or her CD, to announce his or her presence and/or location information to the selected group. User A may also create an ad-hoc group list, or designate a default group list for this purpose. For example, the designated group may include users B, C, and D, as shown by user A's "buddy list."<br>
[0032]	Upon activation by user A, user A's CD sends group alerts to target users B, C,<br>
and D, e.g., through the group communication server, as shown in step 402. The group message may include informatio'h such as user A's presence (e.g., "on," "off," "away," etc.), user A's location (e.g., "at work," "in meeting," "at lunch," etc.), and/or user A's availability (e.g., "busy," "on phone," etc.). In one embodiment, the group communication server sends an alert to each target user in the designated group (e.g., B, C, and D), as shown in step 404.<br>
[0033]	Each target user in the designated group that receives an alert may respond with<br>
a message, e.g., an alert, indicating the target user's status, as shown in step 406. For example, target user B may respond with an "ACK" response, indicating that user B is ON or available, user C may respond with a "NAK" response, indicating that user C is OFF or unavailable, user D may respond with a "in meeting" or "at airport" response.<br>
[0034]	In one embodiment, the group communication server receives the responses<br>
from the target group members (e.g., user B, C, and D), and forwards a group response to user A, as shown in step 408. Upon receiving the group response, user A may update the status of his or her buddy list to include information that user B is "ON," user C is "OFF," and user D is "in meeting" or "at airport."<br><br>
[0035]	In one embodiment, some or all of the target users (e.g., B, C, and D) may also<br>
update status information of their buddy list members. When such target users receive an alert from user A, in step 404, indicating that user A is ON, such target users may update their buddy lists to include information that user A is ON, if user A appears in buddy lists of such target users. As recognized in FIG. 4(A), user may have different personalized buddy lists to preserve their privacy. For better privacy, a user may block any number of other users from contacting the blocking user. So that no information about the blocking user may be shared with other blocked users.<br>
[0036]	In one embodiment, when any one of target users sends a status response to the<br>
GCS to be forwarded to user A, in step 406, the GCS may also send such responses to other ones of such target users to update their buddy list accordingly. For example when user B sends an "ACK" response, in step 406, indicating that user B is ON, the GCS may send the ACK response received from user B to target users C and D to update the status of user B to ON in their buddy lists, if user B appears in their buddy lists. FIG. 4(B) shows the final state of the user presence and/or location information exchange after user A sends the group alerts in step 402.<br>
[0037]	In one embodiment, a user may request the GCS to determine the status of a<br>
designated user or a group of users, determine the group members that are currently registered, and/or determine the group members who are participating in a group communication session. The user may choose an existing group name or create an ad-hoc group, and send the request for information about the group to the GCS, as shown in step 502. The GCS may provide status information about the designated group, e.g., whether the designated group is active or inactive, as shown in step 504, provide information about the members of the designated group who are registered, as shown in step 506, provide information about the members of the designated group who are participating in a current communication session, as shown in step 508, and/or provide information, e.g., location information, about the group members, as shown in step 510.<br>
[0038]	For example, when user A requests information about a group of users that<br>
includes seven members (e.g., A, B, C, D, E, F, and G), the server's response, in step 508, may include information that the designated group is active with five participants (e.g., A, B, C, F, and G), and the nonparticipating members of the designated group are either registered (e.g., user D) or not (e.g., user E).<br><br>
[0039]	In one embodiment, the presence and/or location information may be shared<br>
among the members of a designated group without establishing a communication session, e.g., without talking; thus, providing better privacy for the group members.<br>
[0040]	In one embodiment, the presence and/or location information may be shared<br>
among the members of a designated group without burdening the group communication server with group configuration; thus, providing the service providers easy ways of billing each user based on their activity.<br>
