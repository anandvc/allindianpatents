				<td>NOVEL INDOLIZINE DERIVATIVES, METHOD FOR PREPARING SAME,<br>
AND THERAPEUTIC COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING SAME<br>
The present invention relates to novel indoiizine derivatives, to a method for<br>
their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
French patent FR-A-2 341 578 and European patent EP-A-0 471 609<br>
describe indoiizine derivatives which have remarkable pharmacological<br>
properties, especially antiarrhythmic properties, since those derivatives have<br>
been shown to be capable of suppressing or staving off ventricular and<br>
auricular rhythm problems. The majority of the compounds described have<br>
electrophysiological properties in classes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Vaughan-<br>
Williams classification which in addition to their antiarrhythmic properties,<br>
indicate their bradycardiac, anti-hypertensive and a and β non-competitive<br>
anti-adrenergic properties. Such properties render the compounds in<br>
question very useful in the treatment of certain pathological syndromes of the<br>
cardiovascular system, in particular in the treatment of angina pectoris,<br>
hypertension or ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmia. Similarly, such<br>
compounds are used to treat cardiac insufficiency, myocardial infarction<br>
complicated or otherwise by cardiac insufficiency, or to prevent post-infarction<br>
mortality.<br>
However, such compounds have the disadvantage of being insoluble or only<br>
slightly soluble in water, in particular at pH =4 and especially at a<br>
physiological pH.<br>
Amiodarone, which is an auricular and ventricular antiarrhythmic which is<br>
administered orally and intravenously, is a molecule which is insoluble in<br>
water; the injectable solution thus contains solvents such as polysorbate 80<br>
and benzyl alcohol. Such solvents induce hypotensive and negative inotropic<br>
effects in patients. The injectable solution also causes local venous<br><br>
intolerances which are prevented by recommending a central injection in a<br>
specialized hospital environment.<br>
Dronedarone, a derivative of benzofuran, contains no iodine in its chemical<br>
structure, in contrast to amiodarone, and is also an auricular and ventricular<br>
antiarrhythmic which is administered orally and intravenously. Its low<br>
solubility (solubility in water S = 0.247 mg/ml at a pH of 3) limits the possibility<br>
of preparing and storing it in the form of an injectable substance.<br>
That low solubility substantially limits the possibility of preparing and storing<br>
them in the form of an injectable substance.<br>
In the context of the invention, novel indolizine derivatives have now been<br>
discovered which have good solubility in water while retaining or even<br>
improving their pharmacological properties, especially their antiarrhythmic<br>
properties. Their good solubility in water, in particular at pH = 4, allows<br>
injectable pharmaceutical forms to be produced.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are molecules which are soluble in<br>
water which can be administered intravenously in a physiological solution<br>
(0.9% sodium chloride) or glucosated, and which have the<br>
electrophysiological, haemodynamic and antiarrhythmic properties of<br>
amiodarone.<br>
Furthermore, these novel compounds also exhibit good metabolic stability.<br>
Thus, the invention proposes indolizine derivatives comprising an<br>
aminoalkylbenzoyl chain represented by formula (I) below.<br>
Thus, the present invention concerns novel indolizine derivatives with general<br>
formula (I):<br><br><br>
in which:<br>
X represents a -(CH2)n- radical where n is a whole number from 1 to 6, or a<br>
group with formula CH2-Z-(CH2)2-, in which Z represents an O(CH2)m- group<br>
in which m is a whole number from 0 to 3; Ri represents a linear, branched<br>
or cyclic C1-C8 alkyl radical; Am represents an NR3R4 group in which R3 and<br>
R4 are identical or different and independently of each other represent:<br>
-	a hydrogen atom;<br>
-	a linear, branched or cyclic C1-C6 alkyl radical or a C1-C3 radical substituted<br>
with a C3-C6 cycloalkyl radical;<br>
-	or a (CH2)1-O-B radical in which B represents a hydrogen atom or a (CH2)k<br>
alkyl radical, where I and k are whole numbers, I ≥ 2 and l+k = 6;<br>
or R3 and R4 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form<br>
a heterocycle containing 4 to 6 links which may optionally contain one or<br>
more heteroatoms selected from N and O and optionally carrying one or more<br>
substituents selected from a linear, branched or cyclic C1-C6 alkyl radical;<br>
R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a linear, branched or cyclic C1-C6 alkyl<br>
radical;<br>
and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
In a first variation, the invention concerns indolizine derivatives as defined<br>
above in which X represents a -(CH2)n- radical where n is a whole number<br>
from 1 to 6.<br><br>
In a second variation, the invention concerns indolizine derivatives as defined<br>
above in which X represents a group with formula CH2-Z-(CH2)2-, in which Z<br>
represents an O(CH2)m- group in which m is a whole number from 0 to 3.<br>
More particularly, the invention concerns indolizine derivatives as defined<br>
above, characterized in that X represents a (CH2)n- radical where n is a whole<br>
number from 3 to 4.<br>
More particularly, the indolizine derivatives of the invention are characterized<br>
in that R1 represents a C1-C4 alkyl radical.<br>
More particularly, the indolizine derivatives of the invention are characterized<br>
in that R3 and R4 independently of each other represent a linear C1-C4 alkyl<br>
radical.<br>
In particular, the indolizine derivatives of the invention are characterized in<br>
that R3 and R4 together form a piperidinyl or piperazinyl group optionally<br>
carrying one or more methyl radicals.<br>
In particular, the indolizine derivatives of the invention are characterized in<br>
that R2 represents a hydrogen atom.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can exist in the form of bases or in the form<br>
salified with acids or bases, in particular phamnaceutically acceptable acids or<br>
bases. Such addition salts form part of the invention.<br>
These salts are advantageously prepared with pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
acids, but the salts of other acids that are of use, for example, for the<br>
purification or isolation of the compounds of formula (I), also form part of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also exist in the form of hydrates or of<br>
solvates, i.e. in the form of associations or of combinations with one or more<br>
molecules of water or with a solvent. Such hydrates and solvates also form<br>
part of the invention.<br>
The invention also pertains to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of<br>
compounds with formula (I) formed from an organic or inorganic acid.<br>
Examples of organic salts of this type which may be cited are the malonate,<br>
dodecanoate, oxalate, maleate, fumarate, methanesulphonate, benzoate,<br>
ascorbate, pamoate, succinate, hexamate, bis-methylenesalicylate,<br>
ethanedisulphonate, acetate, propionate, tartrate, salicylate, citrate,<br>
gluconate, lactate, malate, cinnamate, mandelate, citraconate, aspartate,<br>
palmitate, stearate, itaconate, glycolate, p-aminobenzoate, glutamate,<br>
benzenesulphonate, p-toluenesulphonate and theophylline acetate, as well as<br>
the salts formed from an amino acid, such as the lysine or histidine salt.<br>
Inorganic salts of this type which may be cited are hydrochlorides,<br>
hydrobromides, sulphates, sulphamates, phosphates and nitrates.<br>
More particularly, the invention concerns indolizine derivatives as defined<br>
above, characterized in that the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is selected<br>
from the oxalate and the hydrochloride.<br>
The invention also pertains to the preparation of compounds with formula (I).<br>
Thus, the present invention concerns a method for preparing derivatives with<br>
formula (I) as defined above, comprising the reaction of an amine H-Am with<br>
a compound represented by formula (II):<br><br><br>
in which Y represents a halogen atom and the other substituents are as<br>
defined above.<br><br>
with a compound represented by formula (IV):<br>
The invention also concerns a method comprising a method for preparing a<br>
compound with formula (II) as defined above and comprising the reaction of a<br>
compound represented by formula (III):<br><br>
Thus, in accordance with the invention, compounds with formula (I) in which X<br>
represents a -(CH2)n- radical as defined above are prepared in accordance<br>
with the following reaction scheme:<br><br><br>
in which Y represents a halogen, for example Cl or Br, and n and the R1, R2,<br>
Am groups have the same meanings as given above.<br>
Reference may be made to United States patent US-A-6 949 583 for the<br>
preparation of the compounds with formula (III).<br>
To prepare compounds with formula (IV), reference may be made to the<br>
publication EUR J. MED. CHEM-CHEMICAL THERAPEUTICA, NOV.-DEC.<br>
1975-10, N°6, pp 579 to 584 and to LABAZ's patent US-A-4 103 012.<br>
Similarly, to prepare indolizine derivatives with formula (I) by condensing a<br>
secondary amine with formula H-Am with the chlorinated derivative with<br>
formula (II) and to prepare compounds with formula (II) by reacting<br>
compounds with formula (III) with derivatives with formula (IV), reference<br>
should be made to the document US-A-4 103 012.<br><br>
In accordance with the invention, to prepare compounds with formula (I) when<br>
X represents a group with formula CH2-Z-(CH2)2-, in which Z represents an<br>
O(CH2)m- group as defined above, reference should be made to<br>
US-A-6 949 583 and to Monatsh Chem: 129;3; 1998; 309-318 and to the<br>
following reaction scheme:<br><br>
in which the groups R1, R2, Am have the same meanings as given above.<br>
The invention also pertains to a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition,<br>
characterized in that it contains, as the active principle, at least one indolizine<br>
derivative with formula (I) as defined above or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or an<br>
appropriate excipient.<br>
As an example, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention<br>
may be formulated for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intravenous, transdermal or rectal administration. Preferably, the<br>
compositions are present in an injectable form, exploiting the good solubility<br>
characteristics of the derivatives of the invention.<br><br>
Regarding the administration unit, this may take the shape, for example, of a<br>
tablet, a dragee, a capsule, a gellule, a powder, a suspension, a syrup or<br>
granules for oral administration, a suppository for rectal administration or a<br>
solution or suspension for parenteral administration.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may, for example,<br>
comprise, per administration unit, 50 to 500 mg by weight of active ingredient<br>
for oral administration, 50 to 200 mg of active ingredient for rectal<br>
administration and 50 to 150 mg of active ingredient for parenteral<br>
administration.<br>
Depending on the administration route selected, the pharmaceutical or<br>
veterinary compositions of the invention are prepared by associating at least<br>
one of the compounds with formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
of that compound with a suitable excipient, the latter possibly being<br>
constituted, for example, by at least one ingredient selected from the following<br>
substances: lactose, starches, talc, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, alginic acid, colloidal silica, distilled water, benzyl alcohol or<br>
sweetening agents.<br>
When they are in tablet form, they may be treated so that they have an<br>
extended or delayed action and so that they continuously release a<br>
predetermined quantity of active principle.<br>
The invention also concerns indolizine derivatives with general formula (I) as<br>
defined above for their use as a drug. The present invention thus concerns<br>
drugs comprising indolizine derivatives with general formula (I) as defined<br>
above.<br>
The indolizine derivatives with general formula (I) of the present invention as<br>
defined above may be used to prepare a drug for the treatment of<br><br>
pathological syndromes of the cardiovascular system. More particularly, the<br>
indolizine derivatives with general formula (I) of the present invention as<br>
defined above may be used to prepare a drug for the treatment of angina<br>
pectoris, hypertension, ventricular arrhythmia, supraventricular arrhythmia, in<br>
particular auricular fibrillation, cardiac insufficiency, myocardial infarction<br>
which may or may not be complicated by cardiac insufficiency or for the<br>
prevention of post-infarction mortality.<br>
The results of pharmacological tests carried out to determine the properties of<br>
the compounds of the invention as regards the cardiovascular system are<br>
recorded below.<br>
1. Ventricular arrhythmias<br>
This test aims to determine the capacity of the compounds of the invention to<br>
protect against arrhythmias caused by re-perfusion of a previously<br>
ischaemiated coronary artery. To this end, we used the method set out by<br>
MANNING A. S. et al. in Circ. Res. 1984, 55: 545-548 modified as follows:<br>
Firstly, rats sorted into batches were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital<br>
(60 mg/kg intraperitoneally) then they were intubated to assist respiration.<br>
A cannula was then placed in a jugular vein for intravenous administration, a<br>
catheter was placed in a carotid artery to measure the arterial pressure, and<br>
cutaneous electrodes were placed to measure the ECG. After equilibrating<br>
the parameters, an intravenous dose of the compound to be studied was<br>
administered and 5 minutes later, after carrying out a thoracotomy, a loop of<br>
ligature was placed around the left anterior descending coronary artery in the<br>
immediate proximity of its origin. Thus, that artery was occluded for 5<br>
minutes by tension on the ends of the ligature. Re-perfusion was obtained by<br>
releasing the tension.<br><br>
The arrhythmias induced by that re-perfusion were then evaluated.<br>
An analogous test was carried out after oral administration of the compound.<br>
In this case, the study compound was administered 60 to 120 minutes before<br>
ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery.<br>
The results of these tests showed that the compounds of the invention,<br>
administered in doses in the range 0.3 to 10 mg/kg intravenously and 30 to<br>
100 mg/kg orally, significantly or completely protected the treated animals<br>
from ventricular arrhythmia.<br>
II. Antiadrenergic properties<br>
This test aims to determine the capacity of the compounds of the invention to<br>
reduce the increase in blood pressure induced by phenylephrin (anti-a effect)<br>
and the acceleration in cardiac frequency induced by isoprenaline (anti-p<br>
effect) in a dog which had been anaesthetized beforehand with pentobarbital<br>
and chloralose.<br>
Initially, for each dog the dose of phenylephrin (5 µg/kg was determined which<br>
provoked an increase in the arterial pressure in the range 25 to 40 mmHg and<br>
the dose of isoprenaline (0.5 or 1 µglkg) which should cause an increase in<br>
cardiac frequency in the range 40 to 110 beats/minute.<br>
Every 10 minutes, the doses of phenylephrin and isoprenaline determined in<br>
this way were injected alternately and after obtaining two successive<br>
reference responses, a dose of the compound to be studied was administered<br>
intravenously.<br>
• Anti-a effect<br><br>
The percentage reduction by the compound of the invention in the<br>
hypertension caused compared with the reference hypertension obtained<br>
before injecting that compound was recorded.<br>
• Anti-3 effect<br>
The percentage reduction in the study compound of the acceleration caused<br>
in the cardiac frequency was recorded.<br>
The results of these tests showed that in doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg, the<br>
compounds of the invention exhibited anti-a and/or anti-p effects, resulting in<br>
reductions in the provoked hypertension and/or the provoked increase in<br>
cardiac frequency, of up to 50%.<br>
III.	Auricular arrhythmias<br>
This test aims to evaluate the efficacy of the compounds of the invention as<br>
regards auricular arrhythmia (left auricular vulnerability) induced by extra<br>
stimuli in the anaesthetized pig using the method described in Naunyn-<br>
Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol 2001, 363: 166-174.<br>
The study compounds were administered in a dose of 3 mg/kg in slow 5-<br>
minute intravenous perfusions. The haemodynamic and electrocardiographic<br>
parameters and the right and left auricular refractory periods were determined<br>
before and after administering the study compound.<br>
In a dose of 3 mg/kg, the compounds of the invention generally abolished<br>
100% of non-sustained fibrillation or auricular flutter episodes induced by<br>
early extra stimuli. In this dose, significant increases in the effective auricular<br>
refractory periods were observed for different basal values of the cardiac<br>
period.<br>
IV.	Effects of cardiac ion channels<br><br>
This test aims to determine the effects of the compounds of the invention on<br>
cardiac ion channels.<br>
The compounds of the invention (1 to 5//M) inhibited the permeability of<br>
human hERG (IKr) and hKv1.5 (IKur) gene channels expressed in the CHO<br>
(Chinese hamster ovary) cell line. They also inhibited native sodium (Ina),<br>
calcium (ICaL) and potassium channel currents, acetylcholine (IK(Ach))-<br>
activated and ATP-dependent (IKATP), in guinea pig cardiomyocytes, and<br>
potassium channels (Ito and Isus) in rat cardiomyocytes.<br>
Thus, the compounds of the invention are inhibitors of multiple cardiac ion<br>
channels.<br>
V.	Toxicity<br>
The toxicity of the compounds of the invention proved to be compatible with<br>
their therapeutic use.<br>
VI.	Solubility<br>
The solubility tests for the compounds of the invention were carried out at pH<br>
= 4 (starting from a phosphate buffer, pH = 6, 0.1M) by HPLC (high<br>
performance liquid chromatography) using an H2O/CH3CN/CH3SO3H gradient<br>
and compared with a reference sample (a dilute solution of test product which<br>
acts as an internal reference).<br>
The results for solubility, S, and pH are shown in the table below and are<br>
expressed in mg/ml.<br>
In general, compounds with formula (I) of the present invention have a<br>
solubility of 1 mg/ml or more at pH= 4; some of them had a solubility of more<br>
than 8 mg/ml or even more than 10 mg/ml.<br><br>
TABLE OF EXAMPLES<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following non-limiting examples illustrate the preparation of the<br>
compounds and compositions of the invention:<br>
The proton magnetic resonance spectra (1H NMR) described below were<br>
recorded at 200 MHz in DMSO-d6 using the DMSO-d6 peak as the reference.<br>
The chemical displacements 5 are expressed in parts per million (ppm). The<br>
signals observed are expressed as follows: s: singlet; bs: broad singlet; d:<br>
doublet; dd: double doublet; t: triplet; dt: double triplet; q: quadruplet; qui:<br>
quintuplet; m: mass; mt: multiplet; sxt: sextuple!<br>
Example 1 (2-butyl-6-ethylindolizin-3-yl){4-[3-<br>
(dipropylamino)propyl]phenyl}methanone hydrochloride (compound<br>
44)<br>
a)	1 -bromohexane-2-one<br>
60 g (0.599 mole) of 2-hexanone was slowly added to a solution of 58.6 g<br>
(0.976 mole) of urea in 210 ml of acetic acid at ambient temperature. The<br>
medium was cooled to 0°C in an ice bath then 33 ml of bromine (0.640 mole)<br>
was added and it was stirred for 18 hours at ambient temperature. It was<br>
poured onto water (1500 ml) and extracted with methylene chloride, the<br>
organic phase was washed with a sodium bicarbonate solution, then dried<br>
over sodium sulphate and the solution was concentrated.<br>
The residue was distilled under reduced pressure. 76 g of the expected<br>
compound was recovered (boiling point: 80-90°C/18 mmHg), contaminated<br>
with a little of its isomer, 3-bromohexanone (6%).<br>
b)	N-(hexanone-2-yl)-2-methyl-5-ethylpyridinium bromide<br>
21.6 g (0.178 mole) of 5-ethyl-2-methylpyridine was added slowly to 40 g of 1-<br>
bromo-2-hexanone (0.223 mole) and stirred for 3 hours at ambient<br><br>
temperature. A viscous medium was obtained which was used as is for the<br>
next step.<br>
c)	2-butyl-6-ethvyl-indolizine<br>
A solution of 65 g of triethylamine in 370 ml of ethanol was added dropwise to<br>
a solution of the product described above in 300 ml of ethanol then it was<br>
heated under reflux for 18 hours. It was vacuum concentrated, taken up in<br>
ethyl acetate, washed with water then the organic phase was dried over<br>
sodium sulphate and concentrated to dryness. Next, it was purified by flash<br>
chromatography over silica (eluent: heptane/methylene chloride, 50/50). In<br>
this manner, 15 g of the desired compound was obtained in the form of a<br>
yellow oil.<br>
Yield: 34%.<br>

a)(2-propylindolizin-3-vl)r4-(4-chlorobutyl)phenyl] methanone<br>
A mixture of 11 g (69 mmoles) of 2-propyl indolizine and 15.9 g (69 mmoles)<br>
of 4-(4-chlorobutyl) benzoyl chloride was heated to 50°C for 18 hours. It was<br>
taken up in water, extracted with dichloromethane, washed with a sodium<br>
carbonate solution, the organic phase was dried over sodium sulphate and<br>
concentrated to dryness. It was purified by flash chromatography over<br>
alumina (eluent: heptane/methylene chloride, 50/50).<br>
In this manner, 23 g of the desired compound was obtained in the form of an<br>
oil.<br>
Yield : 94.2 %<br>
b)	(2-propylindolizin-3-yl){4-[4-(dipropylamino)butyl]phenyl}methanone<br>
4 g (11.3 mmoles) of the compound obtained in the preceding step was<br>
dissolved in a reactor in 50 ml of methyl isobutylketone and 2.9 g (29.3<br>
mmoles) of dipropylamine and 0.33 g (2 26 mmoles) of sodium iodide were<br>
added to this reaction medium and heated to 110°C for 72 hours.<br>
It was poured into water, extracted with dichloromethane, washed with a<br>
sodium bicarbonate solution and concentrated to dryness. It was then<br>
purified by flash chromatography on silica (eluent: methylene<br>
chloride/methanol, 95/5).<br>
In this manner, 3.9 g of the desired compound was obtained.<br>

7 ml of a solution of hydrochloric ether (2M in ether) was added to a solution<br>
of the product described above, 3.9 g in ether (50 ml), stirred for 30 minutes<br>
and the salt which crystallized out was filtered.<br>
In this manner, 3.1 g of the desired compound was obtained.<br>

system : 4H); 7.62 (d : 1H); 9.45 (d : 1H) - 10.23 (bs : 1H)<br>
The solubility tests were carried out at pH = 4 as follows :<br>
A phosphate buffer, pH6, 0.1 M, was prepared by adding 6.15 ml of 0.1 M<br>
Na2HPO4 to 43.85 ml of 0.1 M NaH2PO4. The solution was made up to<br>
100 ml with filtered water using a Millipore system (trade mark).<br>
Reference (test product in a concentration in which the latter is soluble and<br>
which acts as an internal reference)<br>
About 0.2 mg (in a boat) was weighed out exactly and diluted in 1 ml of<br>
H2O/CH3CN: (50:50), i.e. 0.2 mg/ml, then the sample was subjected to<br>
ultrasound for 5 minutes.<br>
Test product sample:<br>
About 4 mg (in a boat) was weighed out exactly and diluted in 400 µl (i.e. 10<br>
mg/ml) of pH6 phosphate buffer (0.1 M), then the sample was subjected to<br>
ultrasound for 5 minutes.<br>
The pH was noted and if the pH was below 4, 1 µl of NaOH 1N was added<br>
(from 1 µl in 1 µI) until the pH was more than 4, then the pH was noted again.<br>
The solution (0.45 µm) was filtered then if necessary diluted with the<br>
phosphate buffer pH6. (If the product re-precipitated after diluting, the diluted<br><br>
sample was ignored, the mother solution was used and the solubility was<br>
determined at a wavelength other than λmax, to avoid saturating the signal.<br>
The solubility of the compound was then determined by HPLC under the<br>
following conditions:<br>
