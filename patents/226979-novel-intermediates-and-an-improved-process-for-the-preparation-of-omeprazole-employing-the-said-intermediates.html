FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention, relates to an improved process for the preparation of Omeprazole. This invention particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of Omeprazole<br><br>
Omeprazole is one of the world's widely used drugs for the treatment of ulcer diseases. This compound act by irreversible inhibition of the H' K" ATPase enzyme, which is part of the proton pump located in the parietal cell of the stomach wall.<br>
The Spanish patent no 9002764/European Patent - 0484265 A1 discloses a process for the preparation of Omeprazole starting with 4-nitro-2, 3,5-trimethyl pyridine-N-Oxide of the formula IV, <br><br>
*<br>
and through intermediates 2-chloromethyl-3, 5-drmethyl-4-nitropyridine	hydrochloride<br>
of the formula VI,<br><br>
According to the above mentioned patents (ES-9002764/EP-0484265 A1 the process for the preparation of the Omeprazole (schemes A &amp; B) and the novel intermediates 2-hydroxymethyl-3, 5-dimethyl-4-nitropyridine hydrochloride (scheme C) shown below.<br><br><br>
is reacted with phosphorous trichloride to get 4-nitro-2,3,5-trimethylpyridine of formula -V,<br><br>
The compound of formula VIII Is reacted with sodium methoxide and benzyl triethyl ammonium chloride in methanol to get desoxyomeprazole of formula IX.<br><br><br>
The compound of formula VI is converted to Omeprazole of formula I as mentioned in scheme -A.<br>
Scheme - C<br>
4-Nitro-2,3,5-trimethyl pyridine-N-Oxide of formula IV Is reacted with acetic anhydride in presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine to get 2-acetyloxymethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-nitro-pyridine of formula XI,<br><br><br>
which on acid hydrolysis gives 2-hydroxymethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-nitropyridine hydrochloride of formula-XII. <br>
On our repeating the process disclosed in ES 9002764/EP0484265 A1 for obtaining omeprazole, we found that the Omeprazole obtained is contaminated with chlorine containing impurities at about 2% level. The cause for this impurity was traced to the instability of HCI salts of compounds of the formulae -VI and XII resulting in formation of 4-chloro derivatives by displacement of 4-nitro group by chloride ion.<br><br><br>
originates from 2-hydroxymethyl-3, 5-dimethyl-4-nitropyridine hydrochloride of formula -XII (as HCf salt).<br>
In our sustained efforts to produce omeprazole minimizing the formation of impurities of the formula -XIII and formula-XIV and in the later stage the impurity 5-methoxy-2-{({4-chloro-3,5-<br>
dimethylpyridinyl)methyl)thio)-1H--benzimidazoleofformula-XV,<br><br>
Formula-XV with limit less than 0.1%, we could develop a process based on our findings that the compound of formula-XI is hydrolyzed by base hydrolysis avoiding acid hydrolysis, and in the subsequent stage the compound 2-chloromethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-nitropyridine of the formula III is isolated in base form by neutralising immediately after completion of the reaction with a base. Such a procedure avoids the formation of impurities 2-hydroxymethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-chloropyridine of formula-XIV and 2 chloromethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-chloropyridine of formula XIII and the       impurity of formula -XV in later stage.<br>
2,3,5-trimethyl-4-nitropyridine-N-Oxide, of formula-IV, can then be rearranged to 2-acetyloxymethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-nitropyridine of the formula-XI which on base hydrolysis gives 2-hydroxymethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-nitropyridine, of the formula -II. This intermediate of formula-II is purified by recrystalisation from different solvents.<br>
The compound of the formula -II is reacted at a temperature in the range 0-15° C with a chlorinating agent, such as thionyl chloride to get 2-chloromethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-nitro-pyridine hydrochloride of the formula -VI which is neutralized immediately to obtain compound of formula -III in base form with the impurity 2-chloromethyl-4-chloro-3,5- -dimethylpyridine of formula- XIII less than 0.2%.<br>
The 2-chloromethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-nitropyridine of formula -III is dissolved in a protic solvent<br>
and reacted with 2-mercapto-5-methoxy benzimidazole, of the formula-VII with a base to get<br>
5-metlioxy-2-(({3,5-dimethyl-4-nitro-2-pyridinyl)methyl)thio)-1H-benzimidazole, of formula-VIII.<br>
After recrystallization from suitable solvents, pure compound-VIU is obtained with<br>
an    impurity,	5-methoxy-2-(((3,5-dimethyl-4-chloro-2-pyridinyl)    methyl)thio    -1    H-<br>
benzimidazole of formula -XV less than 0.1%.<br><br>
t<br>
The compound of the formula -VIII is refluxed with methanolic sodium methoxide solution to obtain 5-methoxy-2-(((3,5-dimethyl-4-methoxy-2-pyridinyl)methyl)thio)-1H- -benzimidazole, of the formula -IX.<br>
The desoxyomeprazole of the formula -IX is reacted with hydrogen peroxide - urea complex and acid anhydride in the presence of a protic solvent at low temperature i.e. -5 to 0°C to get technical omeprazole, which is purified to get Pharmacopeal grade Omeprazole. The Omeprazole   thus    prepared   contain    impurities   5-methoxy-2-(((3,5-dimethyl-4-chloro-2-<br><br>
The present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of omeprazole using novel intermediates 2-hydroxymethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-nitro pyridine of the formula II and 2-chloro methyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-nitro pyridine of the formula III. These two intermediates are very stable when compared to its hydrochloride salts.<br>
The 2-hydroxymethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-nitro pyridine of the formula II and 2-chloro methyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-nitro pyridine of the formula III both in their base form prepared according to the process disclosed above have not been reported in the literature. These compounds are very stable when compared to their hitherto known hydrochloride salts, which are produced according to the process disclosed in the above said Spanish patent. The employment of these new intermediates results in the reduction of impurities in the preparation of omeprazole.<br><br>
The main objective of the present invention is, therefore to provide an improved process for the preparation of Omeprazole having impurities less than 0.1%.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Omeprazole starting from 2,3,5-trimethyl-4-nitro pyridine-N-oxide of formula IV and through novel intermediates 2-hydroxymethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-nitro pyridine of the formula II and novel 2-chloromethyl-3,5-dimethy[-4-nitro pyridine of the formula III.
