DETATLED DESCRIPTTON OF THE PREFERRED EMRODTMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the invention will be explained with reference to the accompanied drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view showing the configuration of an antenna device according to the invention. In FIG. 1, the antenna device comprises an antenna 1 provided with a joining member for joining with a holder 2 through a hole, a case 4 comprising feeding spring escape/rotation prevention ribs 5 provided parallel to the antenna insertion direction in the vicinity of the hole, the holder 2 to be joined with the joining member inserted through the hole, and a feeding spring 3 engaged astride around the holder 2.<br>
FIG. 2 is a plan view of the vicinity of the hole of the case viewed from above. It is observed that the feeding spring escape/rotation prevention ribs 5 are provided parallel to the antenna insertion direction from the case 4 . Moreover, it is observed that a curvature (R) is formed at the tip portion of the feeding spring escape/rotation prevention ribs 5 along the antenna insertion direction. The curvature (R) is formed for facilitating attachment of the parts.<br><br>
FIG- 3 is a plan view showing the state with the holder 2 and the feeding spring 3 mounted further to the state of FIG. 2 . The positional relationship among the holder 2, the feeding spring 3 and the feeding spring escape/rotation prevention ribs 5 can be observed.<br>
FIG. 4 is an enlarged elevation view showing the configuration of the antenna device immediately before completion of the assembly, viewed from the inside of the case. FIG. 4 shows the state wherein the antenna is joined with the holder 2 already, and the feeding spring 3 is being attached onto the holder 2 by applying pressure. That is, it is understood that since the pressure is applied onto the feeding spring 3 for mounting on the holder 2, the feeding spring 3 can be mounted with the tip portion thereof placed around the holder 2 as well as the surface having the contact point astride on the surface of the holder 2 without contacting with the feeding spring escape/rotation prevention ribs 5. It is observed that an inclination is formed at the tip portion of the feeding spring escape/rotation prevention ribs 5 in the direction for mounting the feeding spring 3.<br>
FIG. 5 is an enlarged elevation view showing the configuration of the antenna device in the state after completion of the assembly, viewed from the inside of the case. Since assembly of the antenna device has been completed already in FIG. 5, for example, in the case a force of pulling out the<br><br>
feeding spring 3 is applied in the arrow direction, the feeding spring 3 is contacted with the feeding spring escape/rotation prevention ribs 5 owing to the spring force of the feeding spring 3 so that the feeding spring 3 cannot be pulled out owing to inhibition by the feeding spring escape/rotation prevention ribs 5.<br>
Moreover, in the case a rotational force is applied on the feeding spring 3, the feeding spring 3 is contacted with the feeding spring escape/rotation prevention ribs 5 owing to the spring force of the feeding spring 3 so that the feeding spring 3 cannot be rotated owing to inhibition by the feeding spring escape/rotation prevention ribs 5.<br>
As is apparent from the explanation above, since the invention comprises an antenna provided with a joining member for joining with a holder through a hole, a case comprising feeding spring escape/rotation prevention ribs provided parallel to the antenna insertion direction in the vicinity of the hole, the holder to be joined with the joining member inserted through the hole, and a feeding spring engaged astride around the holder, the effect of preventing escape or rotation<br><br><br>
