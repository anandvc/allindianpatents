				<td>Combination therapy of substituted oxazoiidinones<br>
The present invention relates to combinations of A) oxazoiidinones of the formula (I) with B) acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and C) an ADP receptor antagonist, in particular P2Y12 purinoreceptor blocker, to a process for producing these combinations and to the use thereof as medicaments, in particular for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of thromboembolic disorders.<br>
Oxazoiidinones of the formula (I) act in particular as selective inhibitors of coagulation factor Xa (FXa) and as anticoagulants (cf. WO 01/47919). Combinations of FXa inhibitors with platelet aggregation inhibitors, anticoagulants, fibrinolytics, lipid-lowering agents, coronary therapeutic agents and/or vasodilators are described in WO 03/000256.<br>
It has been possible to demonstrate an antithrombotic effect of factor Xa inhibitors in numerous animal models (cf. U. Sinha, P. Ku, J. Malinowski, B. Yan Zhu, RM. Scarborough, C K. Marlowe, PW. Wong, P. Hua Lin, SJ. Hollenbach, Antithrombotic and hemostatic capacity of factor Xa versus thrombin inhibitors in models of venous and arteriovenous thrombosis, European Journal of Pharmacology 2000, 395, 51-59; A. Betz, Recent advances in Factor Xa inhibitors, Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 2001,11, 1007; K. Tsong Tan, A. Makin, G. YH Lip, Factor X inhibitors, Exp. Opin. Investig. Drugs 2003, 12, 799; J. Ruef, HA. Katus, New antithrombotic drugs on the horizon, Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 2003, 12, 781; MM. Samama, Synthetic direct and indirect factor Xa inhibitors, Thrombosis Research 2002, 106, V267; ML. Quan, JM. Smallheer, The race to an orally active Factor Xa inhibitor, Recent advances, J. Current Opinion in Drug Discovery&amp; Development 2004, 7, 460-469) and in clinical studies on patients (The Ephesus Study, blood 2000, Vol 96, 490a; The Penthifra Study, blood 2000, Vol 96, 490a; The Pentamaks Study, blood 2000, Vol 96, 490a-491a; The Pentathlon 2000 Study, blood 2000, Vol 96, 491a). Factor Xa inhibitors can therefore preferably be employed in medicaments for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of thromboembolic disorders.<br>
Selective FXa inhibitors show a wide therapeutic window. It was possible to show in numerous animal experimental investigations that FXa inhibitors show an antithrombotic effect in thrombosis models without, or with only a slight, prolonging effect on bleeding times (cf. R. J. Leadly, Coagulationfactor Xa inhibition: biological background and rationale, Curr Top Med Chem2001;7, 151-159).<br>
Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is a novel type of direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor which is undergoing clinical development and is to be employed for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic disorders. The antithrombotic effect of rivaroxaban was shown in animal experimental investigations (Perzborn, E, Srassburger J, Wilmen A, Pohlmann J, Roehrig S,<br>
Schlemmer KH, Straub A, In vitro and in vivo studies of the novel antithrombotic agent BAY 59-7939- an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor. JTH 2005; 3: 514-521) and in clinical studies (Kubitza D, Haas S, Novel factor Xa inhibitors for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. Expert Opin Investig Drugs 2006; 15: 843-855).<br>
It was possible to prove in clinical studies that therapy with inhibitors of platelet aggregation such as aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) (Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration; Collaborative metaanalysis of randomized trials of antiplatelet therapy for prevention of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in high risk patients. BMJ 2002; 324: 71-86), clopidogrel (CAPRIE Steering Committee; A randomised, blinded, trial of clopidogrel versus aspirin in patients at risk of ischemic events (CAPRIE). Lancet 1996; 348: 1329-39) and in particular combination thereof (Peters RJ, Mehta SR, Fox KA et al. Effects of aspirin dose when used alone or in combination with clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes: observations from the Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent Events (Cure) study. Circulation 2003; 108: 1682-7; Chen ZM, Jiang LX, Chen YP et al. Addition of clopidogrel to aspirin in 45,852 patients with acute myocardial infarction: randomised placebo-controlled trial. Lancet 2005; 366: 1607-21) leads to a reduction in ischemic events (such as myocardial infarction, stroke). However, despite the evident improvement, therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors has a limited effect.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that combinations of oxazolidinones of the formula (I) with acetylsalicylic acid and ADP receptor antagonists, especially P2Y12 purinoreceptor blockers, have interesting properties and are more suitable for prophylaxis and/or treatment of thromboembolic disorders than are the individual active ingredients alone, combination of oxazolidinones of the formula (I) with acetylsalicylic acid, combination of oxazolidinones of the formula (I) with an ADP receptor antagonist or combination of acetylsalicylic acid and ADP receptor antagonists.<br>
The invention therefore relates to combinations of<br>
A)	oxazolidinones of the formula (I) with<br>
B)	acetylsalicylic acid and<br>
C)	an ADP receptor antagonist.<br>
"Combinations" mean for the purposes of the invention not only dosage forms which comprise all the components (so-called fixed combinations), and combination packs which comprise the components separate from one another, but also components administered simultaneously or sequentially as long as they are employed for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of the same disease.<br>
Suitable oxazolidinones of the combination of the invention include, for example, compounds of the formula (I)<br>

A particularly preferred compound C) of an ADP receptor antagonist, in particular of a P2Y12 receptor blocker, is clopidogrel (Plavix).<br>

A low-dose FXa inhibitor such as rivaroxaban (Example 44) combined with acetylsalicylic acid and an ADP receptor antagonist such as clopidogrel leads to a potent synergistic antithrombotic effect and is superior to the effect of the combination of oxazolidinones of the formula (I) with acetylsalicylic acid or the combination of oxazolidinones of the formula (I) with an ADP receptor antagonist, and the combination of acetylsalicylic acid and an ADP receptor antagonist alone. Rivaroxaban, given in dosages which show no antithrombotic effect when used alone, leads in combination with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel, a P2Y12 receptor blocker (ADP receptor antagonist), to a considerable increase in the potency of the antithrombotic effect of the platelet aggregation inhibitors in a thrombosis model.<br>
The combinations of the invention are particularly suitable for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of thromboembolic disorders.<br>
"Thromboembolic disorders" include in the context of the present invention in particular disorders such as myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation (STEMI) and without ST segment elevation (non-STEMI), stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris, reocclusions and restenoses following coronary interventions such as angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass, peripheral arterial occlusive diseases, pulmonary embolisms, deep vein thromboses and renal vein<br>

It has generally proved advantageous to administer the combinations of the invention in total amounts of from about 0.001 to 100 mg/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg, in particular about 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, of body weight every 24 hours, where appropriate in the form of a plurality of single doses, to achieve the desired results.<br>
It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to depart from the aforementioned amounts, in particular depending on the body weight, on the nature of the administration route, the type and severity of the disorder, on the individual behavior toward the medicament, on the nature of the formulation and on the time or interval over which administration takes place. Thus, it may be sufficient in some cases to make do with less than the aforementioned minimum amount, whereas in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. It may be advisable, for example when relatively large amounts are administered, to distribute these over the day, in particular either in a plurality of single doses or as continuous infusion.<br>

Examples<br>
A	Assessment of the physiological activity<br>
1.	Physiological activity of compounds of the formula (D<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) act in particular as selective inhibitors of coagulation factor Xa and do not inhibit, or also inhibit only at distinctly higher concentrations, other serine proteases such as thrombin, plasmin or trypsin.<br>
Inhibitors of coagulation factor Xa are referred to as "selective" when their IC50 values for factor Xa inhibition are 100-fold, preferably 500-fold, in particular 1000-fold, smaller than the IC50 values for the inhibition of other serine proteases, in particular thrombin, plasmin and trypsin, reference being made concerning the test methods for the selectivity to the test methods of Examples A-l) a.l) and a.2) described below.<br>
The particularly advantageous biological properties of the compounds of the formula (I) can be ascertained by the following methods.<br>
a) Test description (in vitro)<br>
a.l) Measurement of factor Xa inhibition<br>
The enzymatic activity of human factor Xa (FXa) was measured via the conversion of an FXa-specific chromogenic substrate. In this case, factor Xa eliminates p-nitroaniline from the chromogenic substrate. The determinations were carried out in microtiter plates as follows.<br>
The test substances were dissolved in various concentrations in DMSO and incubated with human FXa (0.5 nmol/1 dissolved in 50 mmol/1 tris buffer [C1C1C-tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane], 150 mmol/1 NaCl, 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumine), pH = 8.3) at 25°C for 10 minutes. Pure DMSO serves as control. The chromogenic substrate (150 µmol/1 Pefachrome® FXa from Pentapharm) was then added. After incubation at 25°C for 20 minutes, the extinction at 405 nm was determined. The extinctions of the test mixtures with test substance were compared with the control mixtures without test substance, and the IC50 values were calculated therefrom.<br>
a.2) Selectivity determination<br>
Selective FXa inhibition was demonstrated by investigating the inhibition by the test substances of other human serine proteases such as thrombin, trypsin, plasmin. The enzymatic activity of thrombin (75 mU/ml), trypsin (500 mU/ml) and plasmin (3.2 nmol/1) was determined by dissolving<br>
these enzymes in tris buffer (l00mmol/1, 20 mmol/1 CaCl2, pH = 8.0) and incubating with test substance or solvent for 10 minutes. The enzymatic reaction was then started by adding the appropriate specific chromogenic substrates (Chromozym Thrombin® from Boehringer Mannheim, Chromozym Trypsin® from Boehringer Mannheim, Chromozym Plasmin® from Boehringer Mannheim), and the extinction was determined at 405 nm after 20 minutes. All determinations were carried out at 37°C. The extinctions of the test mixtures with test substance were compared with the control samples without test substance, and the IC50 values were calculated therefrom.<br>
a.3) Determination of the anticoagulant effect<br>
The anticoagulant effect of the test substances was determined in vitro in human plasma. For this purpose, human blood was collected in a 0.11 molar sodium citrate solution in the sodium citrate/blood mixing ratio of 1/9. The blood was thoroughly mixed after collection and centrifuged at about 2000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed by pipette. The prothrombin time (PT, synonym: Quick's test) was determined in the presence of varying concentrations of test substance or the appropriate solvent using a commercially available test kit (Neoplastin® from Boehringer Mannheim). The test compounds were incubated with the plasma at 37°C for 10 minutes. Coagulation was then induced by adding thromboplastin, and the time of onset of coagulation was determined. The concentration of test substance which brings about a doubling of the prothrombin time was found.<br>
2.	Physiological activity of the combinations of compounds of the formula (I)<br>
a) Determination of the antithrombotic effect in an arteriovenous shunt model in rats<br>
Fasting male rats (strain: HSD CPB.WU) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of a Rompun/Ketavet solution (12 mg/kg/50 mg/kg). Thrombi were generated in an arteriovenous shunt in which a thrombogenic thread was secured, based on the method described by PC Wong et al. (Wong PC1 Crain EJ, Nguan O, Watson CA, Racanelli A. Antithrombotic actions of selective inhibitors of blood coagulation factor Xa in rat models of thrombosis Thrombosis Research 1996; 83: 117-126). For this purpose, the left jugular vein and the right carotid artery were exposed. An 8 cm-long polyethylene catheter (PE60, Becton-Dickinson), followed by a 6 cm-long Tygon tube (R-3606, ID 3.2mm, Kronlab), which contained a roughened, thrombogenic nylon thread (60 x 0.26 mm, Berkley Trilene) made into a double loop, was secured in the artery. A 2 cm-long polyethylene catheter (PE60, Becton-Dickinson) was secured in the jugular vein and connected via a 6 cm-long polyethylene catheter (PE160, Becton-Dickinson) to the Tygon tube. The tubes were filled with physiological  saline  solution before the shunt was opened. The extracorporeal<br>
circulation was maintained for 15 minutes. The shunt was then removed, and the nylon thread with the thrombus was immediately weighed. The empty weight of nylon thread has been determined before the start of the test. The FXa inhibitor (such as rivaroxaban) was administered to the animals intravenously, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and/or ADP receptor antagonist (such as clopidogrel) was administered orally by gavage before setting up the extracorporeal circulation.<br>
Table 1: Synergistic antithrombotic effect of the combination of an oxazolidinone of the formula (I) with acetylsalicylic acid and an ADP receptor antagonist<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Clopi = clopidogrel, ASA = acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)<br>
As shown in Table 1, a synergistic effect is achieved with the combination of rivaroxaban (Example 44) with acetylsalicylic acid an ADP receptor blocker such as clopidogrel, i.e. the three components have a mutually potentiating effect. Rivaroxaban (Example 44) in the individual dose is ineffective, and the combination of the two aggregation inhibitors is also ineffective or has only a very weak effect. By contrast, combination of the three compounds leads to a highly significant reduction in the thrombus weight. It is therefore possible by combining an oxazolidinone of the formula (I) with acetylsalicylic acid and an ADP receptor blocker to considerably improve the antithrombotic therapy.<br>

If product is also to be found in the mother liquor, this is worked up with ether and water as described. The crude products can be purified by chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane/cyclohexane and dichloromethane/ethanol mixtures).<br>
For the subsequent reduction, the nitro compound is dissolved in methanol, ethanol or ethanol/dichloromethane mixtures (0.01 M to 0.5 M solution), mixed with palladium on carbon (10%) and stirred under hydrogen of atmospheric pressure overnight. This is followed by filtration and concentration. The crude product can be purified by chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane/ethanol mixtures) or preparative reversed phase HPLC (acetonitrile/water mixtures).<br>
Alternatively, iron powder can also be used as reducing agent. For this purpose, the nitro compound is dissolved in acetic acid (0.1 M to 0.5 M solution) and, at 90°C1 six equivalents of iron powder and water (0.3 to 0.5 times the volume of acetic acid) are added in portions over the course of 10-15 min. After a further 30 min at 90°C1 the mixture is filtered and the filtrate is concentrated. The residue is worked up by extraction with ethyl acetate and 2N sodium hydroxide solution. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The crude<br>
product can be purified by chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane/ethanol mixtures) or preparative reversed phase HPLC (acetonitrile/water mixtures).<br>

The individual stages in the synthesis of Example 17 described above, with the respective precursors, are as follows:<br>
4.27 g (25.03 mmol) of benzyl chloroformate are slowly added to 4 g (22.7 mmol) of l-(4-aminophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one and 3.6 ml (28.4 mmol) of N,N-dimethylaniline in 107 ml of tetrahydrofuran at -20°C. The mixture is stirred at -20°C for 30 minutes and then allowed to reach room temperature. 0.5 1 of ethyl acetate is added, and the organic phase is washed with 0.5 1 of saturated NaCl solution. The removed organic phase is dried with MgSO4, and the solvent is evaporated in vacuo. The residue is triturated with diethyl ether and filtered off with suction. 5.2 g (73.8% of theory) of benzyl 4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)phenylcarbamate are obtained as pale beige<br>
crystals with a melting point of 174°C.<br>
7.27 ml of a 2.5 M solution of n-butyllithium (BuLi) in hexane are added dropwise to 1.47 g (16.66 mmol) of isoamyl alcohol in 200 ml of tetrahydrofuran under argon at -10°C1 a further 8 ml of the BuLi solution being necessary until the color of the added N-benzylidenebenzylamine indicator changed. The mixure is stirred at -10°C for 10 minutes and cooled to -78°C1 and a solution of 4.7 g (15.14 mmol) of benzyl 4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)phenylcarbamate is slowly added. Then a further 4 ml of n-BuLi solution are added until the color of the indicator changes to pink. The mixture is stirred at -78°C for 10 minutes and 2.62 g (18.17 mmol) of R-glycidyl butyrate are added, and the mixture is stirred at -78°C for 30 minutes.<br>
The mixture is allowed to reach room temperature overnight, 200 ml of water are added to the mixture, and the THF content is evaporated in vacuo. The aqueous residue is extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic phase is dried with MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue is triturated with 500 ml of diethyl ether, and the crystals which have separated out are filtered off with suction in vacuo.<br>
3.76 g (90% of theory) of (5R)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-3-[4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one are obtained with a melting point of 148°C and an Rf (SiO2, toluene/ethyl acetate 1:1) = 0.04 (precursor = 0.3).<br>
3.6 g (13.03 mmol) of (5R)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-3-[4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one and 2.9 g (28.67 mmol) of triethylamine are introduced into 160 ml of dichloromethane at 0°C with stirring. 1.79 g (15.64 mmol) of methanesulfonyl chloride are added with stirring, and the mixture is stirred at 0°C for 1.5 hours and at room temperature for 3 h.<br>
The reaction mixture is washed with water and the aqueous phase is extracted once more with methylene chloride. The combined organic extracts are dried with MgSO4 and evaporated. The residue (1.67 g) is then dissolved in 70 ml of acetonitrile, 2.62 g (14.16 mmol) of potassium phthalimide are added, and the mixture is stirred in a closed vessel at 180°C in a microwave oven for 45 minutes.<br>
The mixture is filtered off from the insoluble residue, the filtrate is concentrated in vacuo, the residue (1.9 g) is dissolved in methanol, and 0.47 g (9.37 mmol) of hydrazine hydrate is added. The mixture is boiled for 2 hours and cooled, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution is added, and the mixture is extracted six times with a total of 2 1 of methylene chloride. The combined organic<br>
xtracts of the crude (5S)-5-(aminomethyl)-3-[4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one are dried with MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo.<br>
The final stage, 5-chloro-N-({(5S)-2-oxo-3-[4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidin-5-yl}methyl)-2-thiophenecarboxamide, is prepared by dissolving 0.32 g (1.16 mmol) of the (5S)-5-(aminomethyl)-3-[4-(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one prepared above, 5-chlorothiophene-2-carboxylic acid (0.19 g; 1.16 mmol) and 1-hydroxy-lH-benzotriazole hydrate (HOBT) (0.23 g, 1.51 mmol) in 7.6 ml of DMF. 0.29 g (1.51 mmol) of N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide (EDCI) is added and, at room temperature, 0.3 g (0.4 ml; 2.32 mmol, 2 equivalents) of diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) is added dropwise. The mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight.<br>
The mixture is evaporated to dryness in vacuo, and the residue is dissolved in 3 ml of DMSO and chromatographed on an RP-MPLC with acetonitrile/water/0.5% TFA gradients. The acetonitrile content is evaporated off from the appropriate fractions, and the precipitated compound is filtered off with suction. 0.19 g (39% of theory) of the target compound is obtained.<br>

General method for preparing oxazolidinones of the general formula B by solid phase-assisted synthesis<br>
Reactions with various resin-bound products took place in a set of separate reaction vessels.<br>
5-(Bromomethyl)-3-(4-fluoro-3-nitrophenyl)-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one        A	(prepared        from<br>
epibromohydrin and 4-fluoro-3-nitrophenyl isocyanate with LiBr/Bu3PO in xylene in analogy to US 4128654, Ex.2) (1.20 g, 3.75 mmol) and ethyldiisoproylamine (DIEA, 1.91ml, 4.13 mmol) were dissolved in DMSO (70 ml), mixed with a secondary amine (1.1 eq, amine component 1) and reacted at 55°C for 5 h. TentaGel SAM resin (5.00 g, 0.25 mmol/g) was added to this solution and reacted at 75°C for 48 h. The resin was filtered and repeatedly washed with methanol (MeOH), dimethylformamide (DMF), MeOH, dichloromethane (DCM) and diethyl ether and dried. The resin (5.00 g) was suspended in dichloromethane (80 ml), mixed with DIEA (10 eq) and 5-chlorothiophene-2-carbonyl chloride [prepared by reacting 5-chlorothiophene-2-carboxylic acid (5 eq) and l-chloro-l-dimethylamino-2-methylpropene (5 eq) in DCM (20 ml) at room temperature for 15 minutes] and reacted at room temperature for 5 h. The resulting resin was filtered and washed repeatedly with MeOH, DCM and diethyl ether and dried. The resin was then suspended in DMF/water (v/v 9:2, 80 ml), mixed with SnCl2*2H2O (5 eq) and reacted at room temperature for 18 h. The resin was again washed repeatedly with MeOH, DMF, water, MeOH, DCM and diethyl ether and dried. This resin was suspended in DCM, mixed with DDEA (10 eq) and, at 0°C1 with an acid chloride (5 eq of acid derivative 1) and reacted at room temperature overnight. Before the reaction, carboxylic acids were converted into the corresponding acid chlorides by reacting with 1-dirnethylarnino-l-chloro-2-methylpropene (1 eq, based on the carboxylic acid) in DCM at room temperature for 15 min. The resin was washed repeatedly with DMF, water, DMF, MeOH, DCM and diethyl ether and dried. Where Fmoc-protected amino acids were used as acid derivative 1, the Fmoc-protective group was eliminated in the last reaction step by reacting with piperidine/DMF (v/v, 1/4) at room temperature for 15 minutes, and the resin was washed with DMF, MeOH, DCM and diethyl ether and dried. The products were then cleaved off the solid phase with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/DCM (v/v, 1/1), the resin was filtered off, and the reaction solutions were evaporated. The crude products were filtered through silica gel (DCM/MeOH, 9:1) and evaporated in order to obtain a set of products B.<br>
