				<td>This invention relates to a process for the manufacture of Zeolite-A  useful as a detergent builder.<br>
This invention particularly relates to the field of chemical technology, wherein Zeolite-A powder, useful as detergent builder, is manufactured without amorphous or crystalline impurities, using soap grade sodium silicate, commercial grade sodium hydroxide or caustic lye, and sodium aluminate liquor (Bauxite leaohate)-an intermediate stream of alumina refinery.<br>
Synthesis of Zeol ites depend on the starting materials such as reactive a 1 urninosi1icate gels prepared by mixing sodium silicate &amp; sodium aluminate solutions; or amorphous solids such as metakaolin, si 1 iceous earth, coal ash etc. , pH, alkal i concentration, hydrothermal conditions for crystallization with autogenous pressures and degree of super sa. tura t i on of the aluminosi 1 icate gel leading to the nucleation of zeolite crystals. Using Na2O-A12O3-SiO2-H2O system, formation of gel and subsequently zeolite can be represented as under :<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In the present context, the get is defined as hydrous alkali metal a1urninosi1icate prepared (a.) by reacting aqueous solutions of alkali metal silicates with alkali metal aluminates or using (b) reactive solids or (c) colloidal sols or (d) reactive aluminosi1icate such as derived from dehydroxy1 ation of kaolin.<br>
Hitherto known processes for the preparation of Zeolite-A (detergent builder) are described in brief as follows.<br>
German patent Ger, of fen 2,517,218 describes a process to prepare Zeo1ite-A suitable as phosphate substitute in detergent formulations, by treating NaOH solution simultaneously with waterglass solution and sodium aluminate solution, gelled during 0.5 h, added to sodium aluminate solution at 80*C, and then crystallized during 3.5 h at 93*C. The zeolite obtained was having 93 wt % particles 
In a French patent, French demande 2,384,716 aqueous sodium aluminate solution is cooled to below ambient temperature and aqueous sodium silicate is mixed therewith to keep the resultant solution below ambient temperature. Then the mass was heated to 60-100OC to form gel and maintained at this temperature for 12 min. to 3h. As claimed, the process allowed close control of particle size distribution of the product.<br>
ccording to a German Patent, Ger.Offen 2,951,192 Zeolite-A having average grain size 0.9 urn, calcium binding capacity 300 mg CaCO3/g and 134 mg MgCO3/g was prepared by holding a solution containing H2O 94.14, Na2O 3.77, SiO2 1.77, and Al2O3 0.52 mole at 60OC for 8h.<br>
As defined in a Japanese patent JP, 89,05,905, zeolite having fine grain size is prepared from a mixture containing sodium aluminal.c and si I ieale, by hyd ro I ..hernia 1 reaction a I. the following condi t i ons.<br>
26-60 wt % zeolite concentration in reacting	solution,<br>
14-30 wt % alkal i (as Na20) concentration in	mother  liquor,<br>
40*C   at   reactant  solution  mixing  and	30-ll0OC   for<br>
crystal 1 ization.<br>
Tn a Japanese patent JP 04,342,4 16 a method is described to manufacture Zeolite-A, avoiding formation of Hydroxysodalite. As per the patent, an aqueous solution containing 0.1-0.3 mole per litre aluminate ions and 0.05-3 mole/1 sodium ions is mixed with an aqueous solution containing 0.02-0.1 mole/1 silicate ions and 0.05-4 mole/1. Sodium ions at 
A-type zeolite useful as detergent builder is effectively manufactured, without generation of other types of zeolites (US), as described in Japanese patent JP 63,08,211. As per the patent, aqueous sodium silicate solution and aqueous sodium aluminate solution are mixed at  12 %, when the zeolite crystallization rate becomes &gt; 60 % as determined by electron diffraction method (I) and 
Another .Japanese patent JP 63,26.5,808 describes a process for the manufacture of A-type zeolite as follows. The process comprises (a) adding an aqueous solution of alkaline Al(0H)3 [20-25 wt % Al(0H)3] at 70-90*C and an aqueous solution of alkali silicate (20-29 wt % SiO2) at 
Brit.  UK  Patent  Appl. 2,005,653  describes  a  method  to<br>
2 + manufacture  zeolite  useful for Ca   exchange without.  amorphous  or<br>
crystalline  impurities  by  the hydrothermal  crystallization  of  a<br>
completely  dispersed a 1 urninosi1icate gel by combining  solutions  of<br>
silica, alumina and alkali.  Following is one of the example given by<br>
the  patentees.  Sodium aluminate solution containing 59.3  %  solids<br>
(Na20-Al203 molar ratio 1.2 : 1) prepared by dissolving AI2O3 hydrate<br>
in  hot  NaOH, and sodium-silicate solution containing  47  %  solids<br>
(Si02:Na20: :2 . 4 : 1 )  were  heated  to 72*C, diluted and  mixed  for  7<br>
minutes  in a homogenizer to produce a. dispersed gel with no  visible<br>
particles and viscosity 110 ops at 60°C.  Zeolite-A seed material was<br>
added  and the gel was heated 80 minutes at 100*C.   The  crystalline<br>
Zeolite-A  was  separated, washed, dried for 5h at 105*C to  give  an<br>
uncontaminated material with Ca-exchange capacity 289 mg CaCO3/g.<br>
Tn our earlier patents no. 576/DEL/92 and 577/DEL/92, an improved process for the preparation of a1urninosi1icate gel and detergent grade zeolite from this gel has been described, wherein commercial sodium aluminate powder is used to prepare sodium aluminate solution having pre-optimised concentration of Na2O and Al2O3- This sodium aluminate solution having ambient temperature is reacted with sodium silicate solution at ambient: temperature to form aluminosilicate  gel useful for the manufacturer of  detergent  grade<br>
zeolite  having calcium binding capacity within the range of  150  to 160 mg CaO/gm.<br>
The drawbacks associated with the above mentioned known processes are :<br>
i)   Complex  unit  operations such as simultaneous  addition of  reacting  solutions,  maintaining the  temperature  of  reactants and/or  reaction  mixture  above or below  ambient  temperature,  are involved in the preparation method.<br>
ii) Gel formation at 60-110OC or below ambient temperature makes the preparation method energy consuming which adds to the production cost.<br>
iii) Aging of gel, dispersing gel using homogenizer, prolonged crystallization time, hydrothermal conditions for crystallization etc. also contribute to make the process uneconom i ca1 .<br>
iv) Precise pH control is required to obtain zeolite of uniform and small grain size.<br>
v) Dilute solutions are used which is not favourable for large scale production of Zeolite-A.<br>
vi) Lowering the alkali concentration during the process and monitoring by sophisticated instruments (e.g. electron diffraction &amp; XRD) is a tideous job. Even it requires much more time to obtain the product.<br>
vii) Preparation of sodium-alurninate solution by dissolving Al2O3 hydrate in hot NaOH solution add to the production cost.<br>
viii)High energy inputs are involved for the preparation a alumino silicate gel, since the raw material sodium aluminate powder has util ized more energy as compared to sodium aluminate liquor from which it was prepared. The gel of ambient temperature also requires more energy to achieve the crystallization temperature of more than 90*C.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide of process for the manufacture of Zeolite-A useful as a detergent builder. Another object of the present invention is to provide an eeo-friend 1y, competitive process for the manufacture of Zeolite-A (detergent builder), using sodium aluminate liquor (Bauxite leachate) which is an intermediate stream of alumina refinery and also eliminate the drawbacks of the known processes.<br>
Tn the present invention, sodium aluminate liquor (Bauxite leachate)  is  used as received from the Bauxite leaching  plant,  to<br>
react with sodium silicate solution to form a 1 urninosi1 ieate gel which is subjected to crystallization to obtain Zeolite-A (detergent builder) powder with the composition t.O +. 0.2 Na20 : Al2O3 : 1.8 + 0.2 Si02 : Y H2O (Y = up to 5) with 100 wt % particles below 20 urn, 90 wt % particles in the range 1-5 urn. Average particle s i 7,e ^50 (sedigraph) maximum 4 urn and calcium binding capacity of minimum 160 mg CaO/g absolute dry zeolite.<br>
Specifications of Sodium Aluminate liquor (Bauxite leachate) - an intermediate stream of alumina refinery used in the present invention is given in Table? 1 below :<br>
Tab1e 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The process of the present invention for the manufacture of Zeolite-A (detergent builder) involves utilization of sodium aluminate liquor (Bauxite leachate) obtained as stream of alumina refinery, reduction in reaction time, eliminating aging of gel as well as heat energy during gel preparation and crystallization of Zeolite-A powder from superalkaline crystallization bath consisting of aluminosilicate gel. This method avoids the use of closed hydrothermal system and homogenizer for dispersion of gel. The mother liquor/filtrate of the product contains mainly alkali, which can be recycled for Bauxite leaching or for the preparation in reactant solutions.
