Process for preparing an epoxide<br>
The present patent application claims the benefit of patent application FR 05.05120 and of patent application EP 05104321.4, both filed on 20 May 2005, and of provisional US patent applications 60/734659, 60/734627, 60/734657, 60/734658, 60/734635, 60/734634, 60/734637 and 60/734636, all filed on 8 November 2005, the content of which is incorporated here by reference.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing an epoxide. Epoxides are important raw materials for the production of other compounds.<br>
Ethylene oxide is used, for example, for the production of ethylene glycol, of di- and polyethylene glycols, of mono-, di- and triethanolamines, etc. (see K. Weissermel and H.-J. Arpe in Industrial Organic Chemistry, Third, Completely Revised Edition, VCH, 1997, page 149). Propylene oxide is an important intermediate in the preparation of propylene 1,2-glycol, of dipropylene glycol, of ethers of propylene glycol, of isopropylamines, etc. (see K. Weissermel and H.-J. Arpe in Industrial Organic Chemistry, Third, Completely Revised Edition, VCH, 1997, page 275). Epichlorohydrin is an important raw material for the production of glycerol, of epoxy resins, of synthetic elastomers, of glycidyl ethers, of polyamide resins, etc. (see Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Fifth Edition, Vol. A9, p.539).<br>
In the industrial production of propylene oxide the most commonly used technology comprises the following steps : hypochloration of propylene to monochloropropanol and dehydrochloration of the monochloropropanol to propylene oxide by means of an aqueous alkaline solution.<br>
In the industrial production of epichlorohydrin the most commonly used technology comprises the following steps : high-temperature free-radical substituted chlorination of propylene or allyl chloride, hypochlorination of the allyl chloride thus synthesized to dichloropropanol, and dehydrochlorination of the dichloropropanol to epichlorohydrin by means of an aqueous alkaline solution. Another technology, used on a smaller scale, comprises the following steps : catalytic acetoxylation of propylene to allyl acetate, hydrolysis of the allyl acetate to allyl alcohol, catalytic chlorination of the allyl alcohol to dichloropropanol, and alkaline dehydrochlorination of the dichloropropanol to<br><br>
epichlorohydrin. Other technologies, which have not yet gained industrial application, may be considered, including the direct catalytic oxidation of allyl chloride to epichlorohydrin using hydrogen peroxide, or the chlorination of glycerol to dichloropropanol, followed by alkaline dehydrochlorination of the dichloropropanol thus formed to epichlorohydrin.<br>
In accordance with the invention it has been found that a problem, particularly when chlorohydrins are employed that are obtained by chlorinating polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbons in a dehydrochlorination reaction, is the presence of halogenated ketones formed as by-products. These halogenated ketones may have boiling temperatures close to those of the epoxides and may be difficult to separate by a distilling operation. In accordance with the invention it has also been found that the halogenated ketones, even at low concentration, are responsible for the development of an undesirable coloration of the epoxide or of products produced from it. This is more particularly the case for chloroacetone, which is formed in the process of dehydrochlorinating dichloropropanol to form epichlorohydrin.<br>
It has also been found that, surprisingly, these ketones can be removed during the preparation of the epoxide.<br>
The invention therefore provides a process for preparing an epoxide, wherein halogenated ketones are formed as by-products and which comprises at least one treatment to remove at least part of the halogenated ketones formed.<br>
The invention provides more specifically a process for preparing an epoxide, wherein halogenated ketones are formed as by-products and which comprises at least one treatment intended to remove at least part of the halogenated ketones formed, and wherein the epoxide is prepared by dehydrochlorinating a chlorohydrin.<br>
The chlorohydrin may be obtained by a process of hypochlorinating an olefm or by a process of chlorinating a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, an ester of a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or a mixture thereof.<br>
The term "epoxide" is used here to describe a compound containing at least one oxygen bridged on a carbon-carbon bond. In general the carbon atoms of the carbon-carbon bond are adjacent and the compound may contain atoms other than carbon and oxygen atoms, such as hydrogen atoms and halogens. The preferred epoxides are ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, glycidol and epichlorohydrin.<br><br>
The term "olefin" is used here to describe a compound containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond. In general the compound may contain atoms other than carbon atoms, such as hydrogen atoms and halogens. The preferred olefins are ethylene, propylene, allyl chloride and mixtures of at least two thereof<br>
The term "polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon" refers to a hydrocarbon which contains at least two hydroxyl groups attached to two different saturated carbon atoms. The polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon may contain, but is not limited to, from 2 to 60 carbon atoms.<br>
Each of the carbons of a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon carrying the hydroxyl (OH) functional group may not possess more than one OH group and must be of sp3 hybridization. The carbon atom carrying the OH group may be primary, secondary or tertiary. The polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon used in the present invention must contain at least two sp3-hybridized carbon atoms carrying an OH group. The polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon includes any hydrocarbon containing a vicinal diol (1,2-diol) or a vicinal triol (1,2,3-triol), including higher orders of these repeating units, which are vicinal or contiguous. The definition of the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon also includes, for example, one or more 1,3-, 1,4-, 1,5- and 1,6-dio! functional groups. The polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon may also be a polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol. Geminal diols, for example, are excluded from this class of polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbons.<br>
The polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbons may contam aromatic moieties or heteroatoms including, for example, heteroatoms of halogen, sulphur, phosphorus, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon and boron type, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbons which can be used in the present invention include, for example, 1,2-ethanediol (ethylene glycol), 1,2-propanediol (propylene glycol), 1,3-propanediol, l-chloro-2,3-propanediol (chloropropanediol), 2"Chloro-l,3-propanediol (chloropropanediol), 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, cyclohexanediols, 1,2-butanediol, 1,2-cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,2,3-propanetriol (also known as glycerol or glycerin), and mixtures thereof. With preference the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon used in the present invention includes, for example, 1,2-ethanediol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, chloropropanediol and 1,2,3-propanetriol, and mixtures of at least two thereof. More preferably the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon used in the present invention includes, for example, L2-ethanediol,<br><br>
1,2-propanediol, chloropropanediol and 1,2,3-propanetriol and mixtures of at least two thereof 1,2,3-Propanetriol, or glycerol, is the most preferred.<br>
The esters of polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon may be present in the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon and/or may be produced in the process of preparing the chlorohydrin and/or may be prepared prior to the process of preparing the chlorohydrin. Examples of esters of polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon include ethylene glycol monoacetate, propanediol monoacetates, glycerol monoacetates, glycerol monostearates, glycerol diacetates and mixtures thereof.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the esters of the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon may originate from the reaction of the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon with an organic acid, before, during or within the steps which follow the reaction with the chlorinating agent.<br>
The term "chlorohydrin" is used here to describe a compound containing at least one hydroxyl group and at least one chlorine atom which are attached to different saturated carbon atoms. A chlorohydrin which contains at least two hydroxyl groups is also a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon. Hence the starting material and the product of the reaction may each be chlorohydrins. In that case the "product" chlorohydrin is more chlorinated than the starting chlorohydrin; in other words, it has more chlorine atoms and fewer hydroxyl groups than the starting chlorohydrin. Preferred chlorohydrins are chloroethanol, chloropropanol, chloropropanediol, dichloropropanol and mixtures of at least two thereof. Dichloropropanol is particularly preferred. Chlorohydrins which are more particularly preferred are 2-chloroethanol, l-chloropropan-2-ol, 2-chloropropan-l -ol, 1 -chloropropane-2,3-diol, 2-chloropropane-l ,3-diol, l,3-dichloropropan-2-ol, 2,3-dichloropropan-l-ol and mixtures of at least two thereof.<br>
The chlorohydrin in the process according to the invention may be obtained starting from fossil raw materials or starting from renewable raw materials, preferably starting from renewable raw materials.<br>
By fossil raw materials are meant materials obtained from the treatment of petrochemical natural resources, for example petroleum, natural gas and coal. Among these materials the organic compounds containing 2 and 3 carbon atoms are preferred. When the chlorohydrin is dichloropropanol or chloropropanediol, allyl chloride, allyl alcohol and "synthetic" glycerol are particularly preferred. By "synthetic" glycerol is meant a glycerol obtained generally starting from<br><br>
petrochemical resources. When the chlorohydrin is chloroethanol, ethylene and "synthetic" ethylene glycol are particularly preferred. By "synthetic" ethylene glycol is meant an ethylene glycol obtained generally starting from petrochemical resources. When the chlorohydrin is monochloropropanol, propylene and "synthetic" propylene glycol are particularly preferred. By "synthetic" propylene glycol is meant a propylene glycol obtained generally starting from petrochemical resources.<br>
By renewable raw materials are meant materials obtained from the treatment of renewable natural resources. Among these materials "natural" ethylene glycol, "natural" propylene glycol and "natural" glycerol are preferred. "Natural" ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and glycerol are obtained, for example, by conversion of sugars via thermochemical processes, it being possible for these sugars to be obtained starting from biomass, as described in "Industrial Bioproducts : Today and Tomorrow", Energetics, Incorporated for the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of the Biomass Program, July 2003, pages 49, 52 to 56. One of these processes is, for example, the catalytic hydrogenolysis of sorbitol obtained by thermochemical conversion of glucose. Another process is, for example, the catalytic hydrogenolysis of xylitol obtained by hydrogenating xylose. The xylose may be obtained, for example, by hydrolysing the hemicellulose present in maize fibres. By "natural glycerol" or by "glycerol obtained starting from renewable raw materials" is meant, in particular, glycerol obtained during the production of biodiesel or else glycerol obtained in the course of conversions of animal or vegetable oils or fats in general, such as saponification, transesterification or hydrolysis reactions.<br>
Among the oils which can be used for preparing the natural glycerol mention may be made of all customary oils, such as palm oil, palm kernel oil, copra oil, babassu oil, former or new (low erucic acid) colza, sunflower oil, maize oil, castor oil and cotton oil, peanut oil, soyabean oil, linseed oil and crambe oil, and all oils obtained, for example, from sunflower or colza plants obtained by genetic modification or hybridization-It is also possible to utilize used fiying oils, various animal oils, such as fish oils, tallow, lard and even squaring greases.<br>
Among the oils used it is also possible to indicate oils partially modified, for example, by polymerization or oligomerization, such as, for example, the stand oils of linseed oil and sunflower oil, and blown vegetable oils.<br><br>
One particularly suitable glycerol may be obtained during the conversion of animal fats. Another particularly suitable glycerol may be obtained during the production of biodiesel. A third, very suitable glycerol may be obtained during the conversion of animal or vegetable oils or fats by transesterification in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst, as described in documents FR 2752242, FR 2869612 and FR 2869613. More specifically, the heterogeneous catalyst is selected from mixed oxides of aluminium and zinc, mixed oxides of zinc and titanium, mixed oxides of zinc, titanium and aluminium, and mixed oxides of bismuth and aluminium, and the heterogeneous catalyst is employed in the form of a fixed bed. This latter process may be a biodiesel production process.<br>
The chloroethanol may be obtained starting from these raw materials by any process. The processes of hypochlorinating ethylene and of chlorinating "synthetic" and/or "natural" ethylene glycol are preferred. The process of chlorinating "synthetic" and/or "natural" ethylene glycol is particularly preferred.<br>
The chloropropanol may be obtained starting from these raw materials by any process. The processes of hypochlorinating propylene and chlorinating "synthetic" and/or "natural" propylene glycol are preferred. The process of chlorinating "synthetic" and/or "natural" propylene glycol is particularly preferred.<br>
The chloropropanediol may be obtained starting from these raw materials by any process. The process of chlorinating "synthetic" and/or "natural" glycerol is preferred.<br>
The dichloropropanol may be obtained starting from these raw materials by any process. The processes of hypochlorinating allyl chloride, chlorinating allyl alcohol and chlorinating "synthetic" and/or "natural" glycerol are preferred. The process of chlorinating "synthetic" and/or "natural" glycerol is particularly preferred.<br>
In the process for preparing the epoxide according to the invention, it is preferable for at least a fraction of the chlorohydrin to be prepared by chlorinating a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon. The polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon may be "synthetic" or "natural" in the senses defined above.<br>
In the preparation process according to the invention, when the epoxide is epichlorohydrin, preference is given to "natural" glycerol, in other words glycerol obtained in the course of biodiesel production or in the course of<br><br>
conversions of animal or vegetable oils or fats, the conversions being selected from saponification, transesterification and hydrolysis reactions. Glycerol obtained by transesterification of fats or oils of vegetable or animal origin, the transesterification being carried out in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst, is particularly preferred. In the process for preparing the epoxide according to the invention, the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon may be as described in the patent application "Process for preparing chlorohydrin by converting polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbons", filed in the name of SOLVAY SA on the same day as the present application, and the content of which is incorporated here by reference.<br>
Particular mention is made of a process for preparing a chlorohydrin wherein a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, an ester of a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or a mixture thereof whose total metal content, the metals being expressed in the form of elements, is greater than or equal to 0.1  <br>
µg/kg and less than or equal to 1000 mg/kg, is reacted with a chlorinating agent.<br>
A first advantage associated with this latter type of glycerol is that it contains little or no metals. These metals may be detrimental to certain steps in the preparation of dichloropropanol, such as, for example, residue treatment steps. A second advantage associated with this latter type of glycerol is that it contains little or no heavy organic compounds, which can accumulate in the preparation of dichloropropanol. The purge operations intended to remove these heavy organic products may consequently be reduced.<br>
In the process for preparing the epoxide according to the invention, the chlorohydrin obtained starting from the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon by reaction with a chlorinating agent may be employed, for example, in accordance with the process described in application WO 2005/054167 of SOLVAY SA, the content of which is incorporated here by reference.<br>

In the process according to the invention, when the chorohydrin is chloropropanol, said chloropropanol is generally obtained in the form of a mixture of compounds comprising the isomers of l-chloropropan-2-ol and of 2-chloropropan-l-ol. This mixture generally contains more than 1 % by weight of the two isomers, preferably more than 5 % by weight and in particular more than 50 %. The mixture usually contains less than 99.9 % by weight of the two isomers, preferably less than 95 % by weight and very particularly less than 90 % by weight. The other constituents of the mixture may be compounds originating from the processes for preparing the chloropropanol, such as residual reactants, reaction by-products, solvents and, in particular, water.<br>
The mass ratio between the isomers l-chloropropan-2-ol and 2-chloropropan-l-ol is usually greater than or equal to 0.01, preferably greater than or equal to 0.4. This ratio is usually less than or equal to 99 and preferably less than or equal to 25.<br>
In the process according to the invention, when the chorohydrin is chloroethanol, said chloroethanol is generally obtained in the form of a mixture of compounds comprising the isomer 2-chloroethanol. This mixture generally contains more than 1 % by weight of the isomer, preferably more than 5 % by weight and in particular more than 50 %. The mixture usually contains less than 99.9 % by weight of the isomer, preferably less than 95 % by weight and very particularly less than 90 % by weight. The other constituents of the mixture may<br><br>
be compounds originating from the processes for preparing the chloroethanol, such as residual reactants, reaction by-products, solvents and, in particular, water.<br>
In the process according to the invention, when the chlorohydrin is dichloropropanol, said dichloropropanol is generally obtained in the form of a mixture of compounds comprising the isomers of l,3-dichloropropan-2-ol and of 2,3-dichloropropan-l-ol. This mixture generally contains more than 1 % by weight of the two isomers, preferably more than 5 % by weight and in particular more than 50 %. The mixture usually contains less than 99.9 % by weight of the two isomers, preferably less than 95 % by weight and very particularly less than 90 % by weight. The other constituents of the mixture may be compounds originating from the processes for preparing the dichloropropanol, such as residual reactants, reaction by-products, solvents and, in particular, water.<br>
The mass ratio between the isomers l,3-dichloropropan-2-ol and 2,3-dichloropropan-l-ol is usually greater than or equal to 0.01, preferably greater than or equal to 0.4. This ratio is usually less than or equal to 99 and preferably less than or equal to 25.<br>
In the process according to the mvention, when the chlorohydrin is dichloropropanol and is obtained in a process starting from allyl chloride, the isomer mixture exhibits a l,3-dichloropropan-2-ol:2,3-dichloropropan-l-ol mass ratio which is often from 0.3 to 0.6, typically approximately 0.5.

When the dichloropropanol is obtained starting from allyl alcohol, the l,3-dichloropropan-2-ol:2,3-dichloropropan-l-ol mass ratio is often of the order of 0.l.<br>
By halogenated ketones are meant ketones containing 3 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably 3 to 12 carbon atoms and, with particular preference, 3 to 6 carbon atoms, and in which one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced by a halogen atom. They are often chlorinated ketones, and more particularly chloroacetone.<br>
These halogenated ketones may be produced under certain conditions during and/or prior to the dehydrochlorination of the chlorohydrin in the processes for preparing the chlorohydrin. In the first case, when the<br><br>
chlorohydrin is dichloropropanol, and without wishing to be tied by any one theory, it is thought that the chloroacetone is essentially generated starting from the isomer l,3-dichloropropan-2-ol. In the second case, it has been found, surprisingly, that the halogenated ketones may be present in a large amount in the chlorohydrin obtained by a process of hydrochlorinating a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon. In this case the halogenated ketone content of the chlorohydrin obtained is commonly greater than or equal to 0.005 % by weight, relative to the mixture of the isomers of the chlorohydrin, and often greater than or equal to 0.01 % by weight. Said content is commonly less than or equal to 0.4 % by weight, relative to the mixture of isomers of the chlorohydrin, and preferably less than or equal to 0.3 % by weight.<br>
According to a first variant of the process according to the invention, the treatment intended to remove at least part of the halogenated ketones is carried out duringthe dehydrochlorination of the chlorohydrin.<br>
By dehydrochlorination is meant the removal of hydrochloric acid, irrespective of the mechanism of this removal and the ultimate form in which the hydrochloric acid removed is obtained.<br>
The dehydrochlorination may be carried out by any known means, for example by heating the chlorohydrin in the absence of any reactant other than the chlorohydrin, by treating the chlorohydrin with a basic compound, in the presence or absence of a catalyst. It is preferred to carry out the dehydrochlorination by treating the chlorohydrin with a basic compound.<br>
By basic compound is meant basic organic compounds or basic inorganic compoxmds. Basic inorganic compounds are preferred. These basic inorganic compounds may be oxides, hydroxides and salts of metals, such as carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, phosphates or mixtures thereof, for example. Among the metals, preference is given to alkali metals and alkaline earth metals. Sodium, potassium and calcium and mixtures thereof are particularly preferred. The basic inorganic compounds may be present in the form of solids, liquids or aqueous or organic solutions or suspensions. Aqueous solutions or suspensions are preferred. The solutions and suspensions of NaOH, of Ca(0H)2, purified alkaline brine and mixtures thereof are particularly preferred. By purified alkaline brine is meant the caustic soda, containing NaCl, of the kind produced in a diaphragm electrolysis process. The amount of basic compound in the solution or suspension is generally greater than or equal to 1 % by weight, preferably greater than or equal to 4 % by weight and with very particular preference<br><br>
greater than or equal to 6 % by weight. This amount is commonly less than or equal to 60 % by weight. An amount of approximately 50 % by weight is particularly appropriate.<br>
The basic compound may be used in superstoichiometric, substoichiometric or stoichiometric amounts with respect to the chlorohydrin. When the basic compoimd is used in substoichiometric amounts it is usual to use not more than 2 moles of chlorohydrin per mole of base. It is common to use not more than 1.5 moles of chlorohydrin per mole of base and preferably not more than 1.05 moles of chlorohydrin per mole of base. When the basic agent is used in superstoichiometric amounts use is made of not more than 2 moles of base per mole of chlorohydrin. In this case it is customary to use at least 1.05 moles of base per mole of chlorohydrin.<br>
The water content of the mixture comprising the chlorohydrin and the basic compound is generally greater than or equal to 8 % by weight.<br>
When the dehydrochlorination is carried out by treating the chlorohydrin with a basic compound, the reaction mixture may also contain a solvent such as those described in patent US 3,061,615 in the name of SOLVAY SA.<br>
The dehydrochlorination may be carried out as described in the application entitled "Process for preparing an epoxide starting from a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon and a chlorinating agent", filed in the name of SOLVAY SA on the same day as the present application, and the content of which is incorporated here by reference.<br>
Particular mention is made of a process for preparing an epoxide wherein a reaction mixture resulting from the reaction of a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, an ester of a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or a mixture thereof with a chlorinating agent, the reaction mixture containing at least 10 g of chlorohydrin per kg of reaction mixture, is subjected to a subsequent chemical reaction without treatment in between.<br>
Mention is also made of the preparation of an epoxide comprising the following steps : (a) a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, an ester of a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or a mixture thereof is reacted with a chlorinating agent and an organic acid so as to form the chlorohydrin and chlorohydrin esters in a reaction mixture containing the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, the ester of polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, water, the chlorinating agent and the organic acid, the reaction mixture containing at least 10 g of chlorohydrin per kg of reaction mixture, (b) at least a<br><br>
fraction of the reaction mixture obtained in step (a), said fraction having the same composition as the reaction mixture obtained in step (a), is subjected to one or more treatments in steps subsequent to step (a), and (c) a basic compound is added to at least one of the steps subsequent to step (a) so as to react at least partly with the chlorohydrin, the chlorohydrin esters, the chlorinating agent and the organic acid so as to form the epoxide and salts.<br>
The liquid reaction mixture may be single-phase or biphase.<br>
The basic dehydrochlorination treatment may be executed in continuous or discontinuous mode.<br>
The duration of the basic treatment or, where appropriate, the residence time of the reactants during the basic treatment is generally greater than or equal to 0.1 s, preferably greater than or equal to 0.3 s and with particular preference greater  than or equal to 0.4 s. This duration or this residence time is commonly less than or equal to 2 h, more especially less than or equal to 1 h. The residence time of the reactants is defined as the ratio between the volume of the reactor occupied by the liquid phase or phases and the cumulative flow rate ofthe reactants.<br>
The basic dehydrochlorination treatment according to the invention is generally carried out at a temperature of at least 0°C. Often this temperature is at least 20°C. Preferably it is at least 30°C- hi the process for preparing the epoxide according to the invention, the reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of not more than 140°C- Preferably it is not more than 120°C. In a first particular variant the temperature is from 25 to 50°C. In a second particular variant the temperature is from 50 to 90°C.<br>
In the process for preparing the epoxide according to the invention, the dehydrochlorination is generally carried out at a pressure of at least 0.08 bar absolute. Often this pressure is at least 0.1 bar absolute. Preferably it is at least 0.2 bar absolute. In the process for preparing the epoxide according to the invention, the dehydrochlorination is generally carried out at a pressure of not more than 25 bar absolute. Preferably it is not more than 6 bar absolute. In a first particular variant the pressure is from 0.4 to 0.8 bar absolute. In a second particular variant the pressure is from 1 to 3 bar.<br>
The epoxide which is formed in the process for dehydrochlorinating the chlorohydrin may be removed at the rate at which it is formed, by means of distillation or stripping. Stripping may be carried out using any gas which is inert towards the epoxide. Preference is given to carrying out this stripping with<br><br>
steam.<br>
Following basic treatment, the halogenated ketone content of the epoxide is commonly less than or equal to 0.01 % by weight, preferably less than or equal to 0.005 % by weight and with very particular preference less than or equal to 0.003 % by weight Often the epoxide contains at least 0.0001 % by weight of halogenated ketones.<br>
The invention therefore likewise provides an epoxide whose halogenated ketone content is less than or equal to 0.01 % by weight. When the epoxide is epichlorohydrin its purity is preferably greater than or equal to 999 g/kg.<br>
Without wishing to be tied by any one theory, it is thought that the reactivities of the chlorohydrin, the halogenated ketones and the epoxide are such that it is possible to remove the halogenated ketones without adversely affecting the yield of epoxide by judiciously selecting the conditions for dehydrochlorinating the chlorohydrin.<br>
According to a second variant of the process according to the invention, the treatment intended to remove at least part of the halogenated ketones comprises a distillation, evaporation and/or stripping in the presence of water, this treatment being carried out prior to the dehydrochlorination and enabling the removal of a fraction composed essentially of water and halogenated ketones and the recovery of the chlorohydrin having a reduced halogenated ketone content.<br>
Following this treatment, the halogenated ketone content of the chlorohydrin is commonly less than or equal to 0.1 % by weight relative to the mixture of isomers of the chlorohydrin, preferably less than or equal to 0.04 % by weight and with very particular preference less than or equal to 0.005 % by weight. Often the chlorohydrin contains at least 0.0001 % by weight of halogenated ketones relative to the mixture of isomers of the chlorohydrin.<br>
This treatment is preferably an azeotropic distillation in the presence of water. The reason for this is that it has been found that, when the halogenated ketone is chloroacetone, for example, the water and the chloroacetone form a low-point binary azeotropic mixture, whose composition can be characterized by its boiling temperature, which is 92°C at 1013 mbar. This composition is constituted, at this temperature and pressure, by 28 % by weight of water and 72 % by weight of chloroacetone. Two liquid phases separate after condensation at 25°C; the denser, organic phase contains 95 % by weight of chloroacetone and 5 % by weight of water, while the aqueous phase contains 5 % by weight of chloroacetone and 95 % by weight of water. It has been found that the<br><br>
exploitation of the properties of liquid/vapour equilibria of the binary water/chloroacetone composition make it possible to remove the chloroacetone from dichloropropanol. The water required for the azeotropic distillation may originate, for example, from a process for synthesizing the dichloropropanol, in particular by chlorination of glycerol, or may be conveyed into the process subsequently.<br>
The invention hence also provides an azeotropic composition comprising water and chloroacetone.<br>
Figure 1 shows a first particular scheme of plant which can be used to conduct the process for preparing an epoxide according to the invention.<br>
A distillation column (3) is supplied via line (1) with the chlorohydrin. Water is added to the chlorohydrin via line (2). A stream which contains water and the majority of the halogenated ketones is withdrawn continuously from column (3) via line (4).

84 g of concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at 50 % by weight (1.05 mol) are added to a solution of 129 g of l,3-dichloropropan-2-ol in 950 ml of water. The dichloropropanol contains 3 g/kg of chloroacetone. After 1 minute of reaction at ambient temperature the conversion of the l,3-dichloropropan-2-ol is complete, the selectivity for epichlorohydrin is 99.9 % and the relative chloroacetone content relative to the epichlorohydrin produced is reduced to 11 mg/kg. The selectivity for products of hydrolysis of epichlorohydrin is 0.1 %. Example 2<br>
A mixture of 434.6 g of l,3-dichloropropan-2-ol containing 3.7 g/kg of chloroacetone was distilled following addition of 66.5 g of water.<br>
The distillation was carried out under atmospheric pressure by means of an adiabatic plate column surmounted by a device allowing a part of the vapour phase to flow back at the top ofthe column. The reflux ratio at the top of the column was set at 57 %.<br>
The results table below describes the composition of the various fractions collected :<br><br><br>
40.43 g of distillate were harvested in 6 fractions, and each distillate fraction was biphase. The concentrations given in the table relate to the sum of the two phases. This distillation made it possible to remove 60 % of the chloroacetone initially present, with a total loss limited to 1.8 % of l,3-dichloropropan-2-ol in the distillates.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
