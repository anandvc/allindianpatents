				<td>Impact-Resistant Polyurethanes<br>
By: Richard Gerkin and Edmond Derderian<br>
Scope of Invention: The present invention relates to hard, optically clear, impact-<br>
resistant polyurethanes that are characterized by excellent thermo mechanical<br>
properties and chemical resistance, and which may contain a biomass-derived<br>
component.<br>
Background of the Invention: Polyurethanes are a known class of materials that have<br>
found extensive commercial application because of their excellent physical properties.<br>
These polymers are suitable for molding, spraying, and coating products where tensile<br>
strength, toughness, and impact resistance are required. In many of the established<br>
manufacturing processes it is preferred to employ a one-shot system whereby the<br>
polyisocyanate and active hydrogen compounds are converted to the final product in a<br>
single reaction step. In other known processes an intermediate product, usually called a<br>
prepolymer, is formed first by reacting a stoichiometric excess of a polyisocyanate with<br>
an active hydrogen compound, and the prepolymer is subsequently converted to the<br>
final polymer in a second reaction involving a further active hydrogen compound,<br>
commonly called a chain extender or curing agent.<br>
An example of polyurethane chemistry is disclosed in US Patent No. 4,933,416 to Gillis,<br>
which teaches the use of prepolymers to make polyurethane polymers using<br>
isocyanate, a polyol having an average nominal hydroxyl functionality greater than 2<br>
and an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of from about 500 to about 5,000 and<br>
polymeric polyamine having an average nominal primary and/or secondary amino<br>
functionality of from about 2 to about 3 and an average amine equivalent weight of from<br>
about 500 to about 5000. However, this prior art exemplifies the use of only aromatic<br>
isocyanates, and restricts the hydroxyl [-OH] equivalent weight of the polyol to be used<br>
to be higher than about 500. Moreover, Gillis teaches that if the prepolymer is made by<br>
utilizing just one active hydrogen compound, that compound is a trifunctional one.<br>
US Patent No. 4,443,563 to Dirlikoff et al. discloses the use of dianhydrohexitol as an<br>
active hydrogen compound in the preparation of polyurethane; however, this reference<br>
teaches making the polymer in a one step process via solution polymerization and<br>
subsequent precipitation into an non-organic solvent(for the polyurethane). Such a<br>
process is undesirable since the polyurethane must be separated from the solvent to be<br>
used.<br>
US Patent No. 4,564,645 to Salzburg et al. teaches the use of dianhydrohexitol in the<br>
preparation of a polyurethane; however it specifies a specific ratio of three isomers of<br>
dianhydrohexitol needed to yield a liquid product. The polyurethanes are prepared by<br>
reacting an organic polyisocyanate with a compound containing at least two active<br>
hydrogen atoms and having a molecular weight of from 400 to 10,000, a chain-<br>
extending agent, optionally other short-chain compounds containing at least two active<br>
hydrogen atoms and having a molecular weight of from 32 to 399. The chain-extending -<br>
agent used is a liquid isomer mixture of 1,4-3,6-dianhydrohexitols, preferably 1,4-3,6-<br>
dianhydro-D-sorbitol and/or 1,4-3,6-dianhydro-D-mannitol in addition to isomer mixtures<br>
containing 1,4-3,6-dianhydroiditol. Additionally, it states that if a prepolymer process is<br>
used, the percentage NCO-content of the prepolymer must be between 1 and 18 wt%<br>
and preferably 3 to 16 wt%. These mixtures may be used in admixture with low<br>
molecular weight compounds preferably polyols having a molecular weight in the range<br>
from 62 to 250.<br>
Summary of the Invention: The present invention teaches a new process to produce<br>
hard, optically clear, impact-resistant polyurethane polymers which are characterized by<br>
excellent thermo mechanical properties and chemical resistance. While the process<br>
involves utilization of known urethane intermediates, the novelty is contained in the<br>
specifics of how these intermediates are allowed to react to form the polymer and<br>
therefore the resulting polymer and its properties are surprisingly novel. Furthermore,<br>
only certain species within the class of known polyurethane intermediates can be used<br>
to form the prepolymer, which is utilized to make the clear, hard polymers of interest.<br>
Detailed Description Of The Invention:<br>
The novel polyurethane of the present invention is made using a process in which a<br>
prepolymer is made from a primary amine-terminated polyether and an aliphatic<br>
polyisocyanate. This prepolymer is then subsequently reacted with a polyol and a chain<br>
extender. Surprisingly, the resulting polymers are both optically clear and very hard, are<br>
impact resistant and are characterized by excellent thermo mechanical properties and<br>
chemical resistance, especially in contrast to the generally soft and hazy polymers of<br>
the prior art.<br>
More specifically, the polyurethane is the reaction product of:<br>
1) A prepolymer made by the reaction of a stoichiometric excess of aliphatic<br>
polyisocyanate with a primary amine-terminated polyether with an amine functionality of<br>
about 2 and a molecular weight of &gt;1000, and in which the free -NCO content of the<br>
resulting prepolymer is &gt;18% by weight; and<br>
2) a polyol having an average nominal hydroxy I functionality greater than or equal to<br>
2 and an average hydroxy I equivalent weight of from about 300 to about 1,000, and<br>
3) A curing agent that has isocyanate reactive groups, a functionality of 2 to 3 and a<br>
molecular weight of 
More preferably the polyurethane is the reaction product of:<br>
1) A prepolymer made by reacting a cycloaliphatic polyisocyanate with a primary<br>
amine-terminated polyether diamine of 2000 to about 2500 molecular weight to give a<br>
prepolymer free-NCO content of &gt;18%, more preferably from about 18% to 23%, and<br>
2) A polyol selected from the group consisting of (a) a polyester polyol triol with a<br>
molecular weight of between about 540 and 900, or (b) a polyether glycol with a<br>
molecular weight of between about 650 and 2000, or (c) a polyester polyol diol with a<br>
molecular weight of up to 2,000, and<br>
3) A curing agent selected from the group consisting of (a) dianhydrohexitol or (b)<br>
aromatic diamine, or (c) cyclohexanedimethanol or (d) aromatic ring-containing diols.<br>
Among the prepolymer, polyol and curing agent, they should be present in the relative<br>
stoichiometric equivalents amounts of 1.0 to 1.1, 0.055 to 0.2 and 0.8 to 0.945,<br>
respectively.<br>
Preferably the amine-terminated polyether used to form the prepolymer is essentially<br>
free of any other polyether, and more preferably free of, and is the sole reactant with the<br>
polyisocyanate. Moreover, the polyol used to react with the prepolymer should be<br>
essentially free, and more preferably free of polyols that have isocyanate reactive<br>
functionalities other than a hydroxyl functionality.<br>
The order of addition of the reactants is important. Adding the polyol to the<br>
polyisocyanate to form the prepolymer will not yield a polymer that is clear and<br>
transparent and may not have the same good physical properties. Moreover, addition<br>
of the curing agent during formation of the prepolymer may have the same negative<br>
effect on the formation of the final polymer. Minor amounts of the curing agent or polyol<br>
may not yield negative results, but the formation of the prepolymer should be done in a<br>
process essentially free of curing agents and polyol and more preferably, free of the<br>
polyol and/or curing agent.<br>
The resulting polymer is clear with the following properties: Vicat softening point<br>
(ASTM D 1525,Version A, load=10N) of &gt; 98°C, a hardness of &gt;75 (ASTM D 2240-00,<br>
D durometer), and passes a "falling dart" impact test [Falling Dart Impact (Gardner)<br>
ASTM D3029, with no fracture of the polymer (weight is 900g, impact tip is 0.31 cm<br>
radius, falling a distance of 107 cm., polymer resting on a support plate of inner<br>
diameter of 5.08 cm]. The polymers should have an optical transmittance of &gt;83%.<br>
The term "amine functionality" as used above in defining the primary amine-terminated<br>
' polyether used in making the compositions of the invention means the amino<br>
functionality that a polyether would be expected to have in regard to the materials used<br>
in its manufacture. For example, a primary amine-terminated polyether prepared by the<br>
reductive amination of a polyether diol will have a nominal amino functionality of 2<br>
although, in practice, the average hydroxyl functionality of the diol may be somewhat<br>
less than 2 and the conversion of hydroxyl to amino groups may not be entirely<br>
complete.<br>
The average amino equivalent weight of the amine-terminated polyether is about 1,000,<br>
and is preferably in the range from about 1000 to about 1250. Mixtures of two or more<br>
amine-terminated polyethers varying in functionality, equivalent weight or chemical<br>
constitution may be used provided such mixtures conform to the average functionality<br>
and average equivalent weight criteria displayed above. Polyoxypropylene diamines<br>
and poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene) diamines and mixtures of any of these are<br>
preferred. However, the amines should be essentially, and more preferably, free of,<br>
other isocyanate reactive groups.<br>
The excess of organic polyisocyanate used in preparing the polyisocyanate<br>
compositions of the invention is suitably such that the compositions have free -NCO<br>
contents in the range from 18% to 25%, and especially from 18% to 23%, by weight.<br>
The organic polyisocyanates that can be employed include aliphatic and cycloaliphatic<br>
diisocyanates and combinations thereof. Cycloaliphatic diisocyanates are preferred in<br>
the present invention. Representative of these types of diisocyanates are 4,4'<br>
dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, bis(1,4-isocyanatomethyl) cyclohexane, isophorone<br>
diisocyanate, and other similar diisocyanates.<br>
The term "hydroxyl functionality" as used above means the hydroxyl functionality that a<br>
polyol would be expected to have in regard to its monomeric components. For example,<br>
a polyol prepared by the addition of propylene oxide to a glycol will have a hydroxyl<br>
functionality of 2 although, in practice, its average functionality will be somewhat less<br>
than 2. Thus, for a polyether, the average hydroxyl functionality is the average<br>
functionality (number of active hydrogen atoms) of the initiator or initiators used in its<br>
preparation.<br>
The average hydroxyl functionality of the polyol used in compositions of the invention is<br>
typically from 2 to 6. The average hydroxyl equivalent weight of the polyol is preferably<br>
in the range from 300 to 1,000. Mixtures of two or more polyols varying in equivalent<br>
weight or chemical constitution may be used provided such mixture conform to the<br>
average functionality and average equivalent weight criteria displayed above.<br>
As examples of suitable polyols there may be mentioned polyesters, polycarbonates,<br>
hydroxyl-terminated polyolefins and, especially, polyethers. Suitable polyether polyols<br>
or mixtures of polyols may be selected from the reaction products of propylene oxide or<br>
propylene and ethylene oxides with polyfunctions! initiators such as water, ethylene<br>
glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol<br>
or sorbitol. Especially useful polyethers include polytetramethylene ether glycols and<br>
polyoxypropylene triols and poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene) triols obtained by the<br>
simultaneous or sequential addition of ethylene and propylene oxides to trifunctional<br>
initiators. In some cases, ethylene oxide tipped triols are preferred because of their<br>
enhanced reactivity. Polyesters obtained by the ring-opening polymerization of<br>
lactones, for example caprolactone, in the presence of a polyol and a catalyst, are a<br>
preferred polyol.<br>
Preferably, the polyol should be essentially free of, and more preferably free of,<br>
isocyanate reactive groups other than the hydroxyl functionality.<br>
A curing agent of the present invention is a molecule that has isocyanate reactive<br>
groups, a functionality of 2 to 3 and a molecular weight 
number of isocyanate reactive groups on average on each molecule. Chain-extending<br>
agents that may be employed include those compounds having at least two functional<br>
groups bearing active hydrogen atoms such as hydrazine, primary and secondary<br>
diamines, amino alcohols, glycols or mixtures thereof. 1,4-butanediol can be used as a<br>
chain extender to make clear polymers; however, polyurethanes made with 1,4-<br>
butanediol tend to have low (
suitable. Therefore, preferred groups of curing agents includes cyclohexanedimethanol,<br>
aromatic ring-containing diols, dianhydrohexitols or aromatic diamines. Preferred<br>
aromatic diamines include methylenebis orthochloroaniline (MOCA) and<br>
diethyltoiuenediamine.<br>
The dianhydrohexitols that may be used herein are the 1:4-3:6 dianhydro analogs of<br>
mannitol, sorbitol and iditol. The use of dianhydrohexitol, which can be a biomass-<br>
derived component, results in the formation of non-yellowing polyurethanes, a further<br>
benefit. The three dianhydrohexitols are commonly known as isomannide, isosorbide<br>
and isoidide after their respective parent hexitols. Of the aforementioned hexitols,<br>
isosorbide is most preferred. It is a ring-containing diol containing two nonequivalent<br>
hydroxy I groups (i.e., endo-5 and exo-2). Sorbitol is a particularly preferred starting<br>
material because it is produced from sugar waste and cellulose. Each particular<br>
dianhydrohexitol is prepared by the acid-catalyzed dehydration and cyclization of the<br>
parent hexitol or the intermediate 1:4 or 3:6 monoanhydrohexitol.<br>
The cyclohexanedimethanols that may be used herein are 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol<br>
and 1,3-cyclohexanedimethanol (and mixtures thereof). The aromatic ring-containing<br>
diols that may be used herein are bis(hydroxyethyl) hydroquinone, and bisphenol A.<br>
Preferably, the curing agent should be essentially free of, and more preferably free of,<br>
isocyanate reactive groups other than the aforementioned amine or hydroxyl groups,<br>
respectively.<br>
A catalyst may be optionally employed in the preparation of the polyurethane. The most<br>
preferred catalysts are those metallo-organic catalysts which include, for example,<br>
stannous acetate, stannous butyrate, stannous laurate, stannous octoate, stannous<br>
oleate, cobalt naphthenate, zinc naphthenate, cadmium naphthenate, dibutyltin<br>
dilaurate, dibutyltin-di-2-ethylhexoate, dimethyltin dineodecanoate and the like.<br>
Other suitable urethane catalysts which may be used include tertiary amines such as,<br>
for example, triethylenediamine, N-methyl morpholine, N-ethyl morpholine, diethyl<br>
ethanolamine, 1-methyl-4-dimethylaminoethyl piperazine, 3-methoxy-N-dimethylpropyl<br>
amine, N,N-dimethyl-N',N'-methyl isopropyl propylenediamine, N,N-dimethyl-3-<br>
diethylaminopropyl amine, dimethyl benzyl amine, triethylene diamine, and the like.<br>
The quantity of catalyst that is optionally employed is generally dependent upon its<br>
activity and/or the temperature of the reaction mass. In general, quantities between<br>
about 0.005 and about 2.0 weight percent of catalyst, based on the combined weight of<br>
the reactants can be used, with 0.02 to 0.15 wt% being preferred.<br>
The following sequence is preferred for preparing the polyurethanes of this invention.<br>
The prepolymer to be used is prepared first and its free -NCO content determined (this<br>
is referred to as the "A" side of the polyurethane system). The prepolymer is then<br>
combined with the polyol, curing agent, catalyst and optionally other additives (such as<br>
stabilizers, dyes, fillers, etc.), (referred to as the "B" side) according to the required<br>
stoichiometry based on -NCO content of the prepolymer as against hydroxyl<br>
functionality of the polyol and the reactive functionalities of the curing agent. Both the A<br>
and B sides are degassed to remove residual gases. The A and B sides are mixed<br>
(such as in a commercially available SpeedMixer™ from FlackTek, Inc.) and the mixture<br>
is poured into a mold to be held at a suitable temperature. Generally, reactions are<br>
complete within one hour.<br>
Preferred reaction conditions for the manufacture of the polyurethanes of the present<br>
invention are: Prepolymer formation temperature of between about 40 and 85°C, and<br>
polyurethane formation [(B side, i.e., polyol and curing agent) and prepolymer (A side)]<br>
temperature of between about 40 and 100°C, preferably between 40 and 85°C, and<br>
catalyst concentration between 0.02 and 0.15 wt% of the total, and mold temperature<br>
&gt;90°C.<br>
The polyurethanes may be made by reaction injection molding (RIM) whereby the<br>
reactive liquid streams (A side and B side) are impingement-mixed and rapidly injected<br>
into a mold cavity.<br>
The polyurethanes of the present invention may be used according to those known uses<br>
of polyurethanes. However, given the clarity and hardness of the polyurethanes of the<br>
present invention, preferable uses for them is in the general areas of viewports, lenses,<br>
goggles, face shields, and other glazing-type applications. Such products may be<br>
formed by casting the reaction mixture into the desired shapes at a thickness of from<br>
about 0.0625 to 1 inch thick. The moldings also may be made by injection molding if no<br>
functionality of the polyol is greater than about 2.<br>

Example 1 - Prepolymer 12-86-1<br>
160.Og (1.219 eq.) of Isocyanate 1 was added to a reaction flask equipped with a<br>
nitrogen inlet, stirrer, dropping funnel, heating mantle and thermocouple. The sample<br>
was placed under nitrogen and heated to 80°C, with stirring. 96.24g (0.0982 eq.) of<br>
Amine-terminated polyether 1, was placed in the dropping funnel and added to the<br>
isocyanate over a period of 20 minutes. The temperature rose to 86.5°C and the<br>
reaction was held at that temperature for 30 min. after the polyether was added. The<br>
prepolymer was transferred to a storage container under nitrogen and placed in an oven<br>
at 70 to 80°C for about 16 hrs. Theoretical free-NCO of this prepolymer was 18.38%,<br>
actual was 18.32%, and equivalent weight was 229.26.<br>
Example 2 - Polymer, 60% Hard Segment 12-87-1<br>
52.55g of the prepolymer from Example 1 (the A-side), was added to a small<br>

Polyether 2 (T-650) with 16.39g of Chain Extender 2 (DETDA) and 0.028g of Catalyst 1.<br>
These ingredients were then heated to about 100°C and placed in a vacuum desiccator<br>
under full vacuum for 20 min to degas the system. The reactants were allowed to cool<br>
to 40°C. The A and B sides were then poured together at a stoichiometric equivalency<br>
ratio and mixed by hand using a wooded spatula for 0.75 min. The mixture was poured<br>
into a mold comprised of top and bottom polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sheets and a<br>
0.125 inch aluminum spacer. The mold was held at 150°C and the polymer was molded<br>
at a pressure of about 1800 psi in a heated platen press for 1.0 hr. Upon demolding<br>
and cooling, the polymer had a durometer hardness of 76 D, did not break on<br>
demolding and was clear.<br>
Example 3 - Prepolymer 28-8-1<br>
