This invention relates to novel 8-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivatives useful as monoamine neurotransmitter re-uptake Inhibitors.<br>
In other aspects the Invention relates to the use of these compounds in a method for therapy and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
WO 97/30997 (NeuroSearch A/S) describes tropane derivatives active as neurotransmitter re-uptake inhibitors.<br>
However, there is a continued strong need to find compounds with an optimised pharmacological profile as regards the activity on reuptake of the monoamine neurotransmitters senstonin, dopamine and noradrenaline, such as the ratio of the serotonin reuptake versus the noradrenaline and dopamine activity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides the use of a compound of the invention, or any of Its isomers or any mixture of its isomers, or a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment, prevention or alleviation of a disease or a disorder or a condition of a mammal, Including a human, which disease, disorder or condition is responsive to inhibition of monoamine neurotransmitter re-uptaite in the central nervous system.<br>
In a still further aspect, the invention relates to a method for treatment, prevention or alleviation of a disease or a disorder or a condition of a living animal body, Including a human, which disorder, disease or condition Is responsive to responsive to Inhibition of monoamine neurotransmitter re-uptai(e In the central nervous system, which method comprises the step of administering to such a living animal body in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the Invention, or any of Its isomers or any mixture of Its Isomers, or a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Other objects of the invention will be apparent to the person skilled in the art fr-om the following detailed description and examples.<br>

Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addi¬tion of suitable thicl<ening and gelling agents. lotions may be fomnulated with an aque or oily base will in general also contain one more emuisilying agents stabilis dispersing suspending tiiiclcening colouring></ening>
Compositions suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active agent In a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acada or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerine or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Solutions or suspensions are applied directiy to tiie nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The compositions may be provided in single or multi-dose fonn.<br>
Administration to tiie respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol formulation In which Une active Ingredient is provided in a pressurised pacl
 <br>
Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided In the form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composi¬tion may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g., gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an in¬haler.<br>
In compositions intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intra¬nasal compositions, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 5 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization.<br>
When desired, compositions adapted to give sustained release of the active ingre¬dient may be employed.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation Is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the ac¬tive component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package con¬taining discrete quantities of preparation, such as packaged tablets, capsules, and pow¬ders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or It can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
Tablets or capsules for oral administration and liquids for intravenous administra-tkMi and continuous infusion are preferred compositions.<br>
Further details on techniques for formulation and administration may be found in the latest edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (l\/laack Publishing Co., Easton, PA).<br>
A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of active ingredient, which ameliorates the symptoms or condition. Therapeutic efficacy and toxiclly, e.g. EDeo and LDso, may be detenmlned by standard pharmacological procedures in cell cultures or ex¬perimental animals. The dose ratio between therapeutic and toxic effects is the tiierapeutic index and may be expressed by the ratio LD50/ED50. Phamiaceutlcal compositions exhibit¬ing large therapeutic indexes are preferred.<br>
The dose administered must of course be carefully adjusted to tiie age, weight and condition of the Individual being treated, as well as the route of administration, dosage form and regimen, and tiie result desired, and tiie exact dosage should of course be de¬termined by the practitioner.<br>
The actual dosage depend on the nature and severity of the disease being treated, and Is within the discretion of the physician, and may be varied by titration of the dosage to the particular circumstances of this invention to produce tiie desired therapeutic effect. However, it is presently contemplated that pharmaceutical Mmpositi'ons containing of from about 0.1 to about 500 mg of active ingredient per<br><br>
individual dose, preferably of from about 1 to about 100 mg, most preferred of from about 1 to about 10 mg, are suitable for therapeutic treatments.<br>
The active Ingredient may be administered in one or several doses per day. A satisfactory result can, in certain instances, be obtained at a dosage as low as 0.1 jxg/kg i.v. and 1 |ig/kg p.o. The upper limit of the dosage range is presently considered to be about 10 mg/kg i.v. and 100 mg/kg p.o. Preferred ranges are from about 0.1 p,g/kg to about 10 mg/kg/day I.v., and from about 1 |.ig/kg to about 100 mg/kg/day p.o.<br>
Methods of Therapy<br>
in another aspect the invention provides a method for the treatment, prevention or alleviation of a disease or a disorder or a condition of a living animal body, including a human, which disease, disorder or condition Is responsive to Inhibition of monoamine neurotransmitter re-uptake in the central nervous system, and which method comprises administering to such a living animal body, including a human, In need thereof an effective amount of a chemical compound of the invention.<br>
11 is at present contemplated that suitable dosage ranges are 0.1 to 1000 milligrams daily, 10-500 milligrams daily, and especially 30-100 milligrams daily, dependent as usual upon the exact mode of administration, form in which administered, the Indication toward which the administration is directed, the subject Involved and the body weight of the subject Involved, and further the preference and axperience of the physician or veterinarian in charge.<br>
