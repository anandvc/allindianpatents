Description Of The Related Art:<br>
While a sub-block channel interleaver designed in accordance with the IS-2000 Release C(lx EV-DV) F/L specification performs P-BRO operation for row permutation similarly to an existing channel interleaver designed in accordance with the IS-2000 Release A/B spec. , the sub-block channel interleaver differes from the channel interleaver in that the former generates read addresses in a different manner and requires full consideration of the influence of a selected interleaver parameter on Quasi-Complementary Turbo code (QCTC) symbol selection.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Several preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, the same or similar elements are denoted by the same reference numerals, even though they are depicted in different drawings. In the following description, a detailed description of known functions or configurations incorporated herein have been omitted for conciseness.<br>
Hereinbelow, a description will be made of P-BRO interleaving to which various embodiments of the present invention are applied, as well as the principle of determining parameters for optimal P-BRO interleaving in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 5 is a block diagram of a P-BRO interleaver to which an embodiment of the present invention is applied. Referring to Fig. 5, an address generator 511 receives an interleaver size N, a first parameter m (i.e., Bit_Shift), a second parameter J (i.e., Up_Limit) and a clock signal Clock, and generates read addresses to read bit symbols from an interleaver memory 512. The parameters m and J are determined in an higher-layer controller (not shown) and provided to the address generator 511, or determined according to the interleaver size N in the address generator 511. The interleaver memory 512 sequentially stores input bit symbols at write addresses corresponding to count values of a counter 513 in a write mode, and outputs bit symbols from read addresses received from the address generator 511 in a read mode. The counter 513 receives the clock signal Clock, generates a count value, and provides it as a write address Write ADDR to the interleaver memory 512.<br>
As described above, the P-BRO interleaver writes input data sequentially in the interleaver memory 512 in the write mode and reads data from the interleaver memory 512 according to read addresses generated from the address generator 511. For<br>
details of the P-BRO interleaver, reference is made to Korea Patent Application No. 1998-54131, filed on December 10, 1998, the entire contents of which are expressly incorporated herein.<br>
In operation, the address generator 511 generates a read address A1 for symbol permutation by<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where i=0, 1,..., N-l and N=2mxJ.<br>
In Eq. (1), N denotes the size of an interleaver input sequence and m and J are interleaver parameters called Up_Limit and Bit_Shift, respectively.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates P-BRO interleaving when N=384, m=7 and J=3. Referring to Fig. 1, an interleaving matrix has 2m rows starting from index 0 and J columns starting from index 0. After step 101, the row index and column index of a symbol in the resulting matrix are expressed as [i/j] and (i mod J), respectively.    Therefore, after 2m(i mod J)+ [i/j], an ith symbol in an input sequence has a number corresponding to an [i/]th row and an (I mod J) column as its read address. J symbols are in each row and the distance between symbols is 2m in the row.<br>
The row index [i/l] is BRO-operated in step 102. If the distance between symbols in adjacent rows of the same column is row distance drow, the BRO operation of the row indexes results in a row permutation such that two minimum row distances d^ are 2m-2 and 2m-1, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Thus, after 2m(i mod J)+ BROm[i/J], the ith symbol in the input sequence has a number corresponding to a BROm[i/J]th row and an (i mod J)th column as its read address in the third matrix from the left. In summary, a read address sequence is generated by row permutations of a 2mxJ matrix in the P-BRO interleaver. The row-permuted matrix is read first by rows from the top to the bottom, then subsequently reading each row from the left to the right.<br>
For clarity of description, the distance between adjacent addresses in the same row is defined as "intra-row distance dintra". If J=l, dintra=2m.    If J=l, there is no intra-row distance.<br>
The distance between adjacent addresses in different rows, that is, the distance between the last address in a row and the first address in the next row is defined as "inter-row distance dinter". dinter is one of a plurality of values calculated from a function of the parameters m and J. When m and J are determined, the resulting minimum inter-row distance dint(.r is defined as d™"er .<br>
Since two minimum rows distances drow are 2m-2 and 2m-1,<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The reason for computing dinter by Eq. (2) when J=l is apparent in Fig. 2. If J=l , which implies that the interleaving matrix has only one column, dinter is drow , that<br>
is, 2m-2<br>
As described above, the interleaver parameters m and J are used as the numbers of rows and columns in a read address sequence matrix and parameters for a function that determines distances between read addresses. Consequently, the characteristics of the P-BRO channel interleaver depend on the interleaver parameters m and J.<br>
Before presenting a description of a method of determining sub-block channel interleaver parameters that ensure the best interleaving performance according to an embodiment of the present invention, the purposes of channel interleavers in the IS-2000 specifications, Releases A/B and C will first be described. Following that, the interleaver parameter determination will then be described separately in two cases: N=2mxJ; and N=2mxJ+R.<br>
The purpose of channel interleaving in the IS-2000 specification, Release A/B, is to improve decoding performance, which is degraded when fading adversely influences successive code symbols, through error scattering resulting from symbol permutation. To    improve decoding performance, interleaving must be performed such that the distance between adjacent addresses (inter-address distance) is maximized.<br>
Meanwhile, the purpose of sub-block channel interleaving as described in the IS-2000 specification, Release C, is to allow a QCTC symbol selector at the rear end of an interleaver to select appropriate code symbols according to a coding rate and thus ensure the best performance at the coding rate, as well as to scatter errors through symbol permutation. To achieve this purpose, interleaving must be performed such that inter-address distances are maximized and are uniform.<br>
Accordingly, to satisfy the requirements of the channel interleaver of the IS-2000 specification, Release A/B,   and the sub-block channel interleaver of the IS-2000 specification, Release C, an interleaver must be designed so that a read address sequence is uniformly permuted by interleaving. This is possible by determining the interleaver parameters m and j that maximize a minimum inter-address distance and minimize the difference between inter-address distances.<br>
As stated before, the inter-address distances are categorized into the intra-row distance dinter and the inter-row distance dinter. The intra-row distance is a function of m<br>
and the inter-row distance is a function of m and J. Since there are a plurality of inter-row distances, a minimum inter-row distance dinter is calculated. A minimum inter-<br>
address distance is always 2m-2 when J is 1, and the smaller of the minimum inter-row distance dinter and the minimum intra-row distance dinter when J is not 1 . The<br>
difference between inter-address distances is 2m-2 when J is 1, since the intra-row distance dinter is 0, and is equal to the difference between the intra-row distance dinter and the minimum inter-row distance dinter when J is not 1 .<br>
This can be expressed as follows:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Since N=2mxJ, 2m is replaced by N/J in Eq. (3), it follows that<br>
	(Equation Removed)<br>
When J=3 in Eq. (4), the difference between inter-address distances is minimized. Thus<br><br>
Table 1 below illustrates changes in inter-read address distances as m increases when N=384. When J=3, a maximum difference between inter-address distances is minimized, 64 and a minimum inter-address distance dmin is maximized, 128.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The method of determining optimal interleaver parameters when N=2n'xJ has been described above. Now, a method of determining optimal interleaver parameters when N=2mxJ+R will be described. Here, R is the remainder of dividing N by 2m. Thus R is a positive integer less than 2m.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates P-BRO interleaving when N=408, m=7, J=3 and R=0. Referring to Fig. 3, similarly to the case where R=0, numbers in a row-permuted matrix after step 302 are read as read addresses by rows from the top to the bottom, reading each row from the left to the right, as described in step 303. Since R=0, the number of columns is J+l, and numbers are filled in only R rows of a (J+l)th column with no numbers in the other (2m-R) rows.<br>
In summary, when R=0, a read address sequence is generated by a row permutation of a 2mxJ matrix, each row including J or J+l elements in the P-BRO interleaver. The row-permuted matrix is read by rows from the top to the bottom, reading each row from the left to the right.<br>
Furthermore,   when R=0, the interleaver parameters m and J are determined such that a minimum inter-read address distance is maximized and the difference between inter-read address distances is minimized.<br>
An inter-row distance dinter is a function of m, 2m irrespective of whether R=0 or R=O. However, while the minimum inter-row distance  dinterr is a function of m and J when<br>
R=0, it is a function of m, J and R when R=0.<br>
The minimum inter-row distance is determined according to J by Eq. (5) and<br>
Eq. (6).<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
When J = 1,<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates how Eq. (6) is derived when m=7 and J=3. Referring to Fig. 4, when O<r the inter-row distance between two adjacent rows having a row drow of last column upper being empty is minimum when></r>
between two adjacent rows having a row distance drow of 2m-2, the last column of the upper row being empty, is a minimum inter-row distance (dinter = (4J-3) -2m-2).<br>
When 3-2m-2<r the inter-row distance between two adjacent rows having a row drow of and elements in last columns is minimum dinter="(27" for example if r="0,"></r>
192, as indicated by reference numeral 401. If R=64 (2m-1), the minimum inter-row distance is 288, as indicated by reference numeral 402. If R=96 (3-2m-2), the minimum inter-row distance is 320, as indicated by reference numeral 403. In the same manner, Eq. (5) can be derived when J=l.<br>
Table 2 below illustrates changes in the interleaver parameters J and R, the intra-row distance dinter, the minimum inter-row distance dinter , and the minimum inter-read<br>
address distance dmin as m increases, with respect to six encoder packet (EP) sizes as described in the IS-2000 specification, Release C.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
As described above, similarly to the case where R=0, optimal interleaver parameters are selected which maximize a minimum inter-address distance and minimize the difference between inter-address distances.<br>
In Table 2, the minimum inter-read address distance dmin in the eighth column is the smaller of the intra-row distance dintraand the minimum inter-row distance  dmin<br>
Hence, parameters that maximize the minimum inter-read address distance dm'n can be obtained by selecting a row having the maximum value in the eighth column. For EP sizes of 2328 and 3864, three rows and Uvo rows satisfy this condition. In this case, rows that satisfy another condition of minimizing the difference between inter-read address dintra    - dmin   must be selected. They are shown in bold and underlined in Table 2. The<br>
tnlrn	inter	J<br>
validity of this condition is apparent by comparing the rows having the maximum dmin in terms of n(dmin) in the last column. Here, n(dmin) indicates the number of address pairs having a minimum inter-address distance dmin.<br>
Rows marked in bold and underlined in Table 2 satisfy the above two conditions for selecting optimal interleaver parameters. As noted, once the second condition is satisfied, the first condition is naturally satisfied. For reference, it is made clear that the intra-row distances dintra and the minimum inter-row distances dmin listed<br>
in Table 2 are equal to those computed on P-BRO-interleaved read addresses. Table 2 covers both cases of dividing N by 2m or J with no remainder and of dividing N by 2m or J with a remainder R (i.e., N=2mxJ+R (0<r here interleaver parameters shown in bold and underlined are optimal for each ep size.></r>
When N=2mx(J-l)+R (0<r that is n divided by j either with no remainder or a r optimal interleaver parameters for each size are listed in table the description made context of also applied when replaced></r>
Table 3<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The above description has provided a method of selecting interleaver parameters expected to offer the best performance when, for example, a channel interleaver built in accordance with the   IS-2000 Release A/B specification, and a sub-block channel interleaver built hi accordance with the    IS-2000 Release C specification are used.<br>
As described above, the optimal interleaver parameters are those that maximize an inter-address distance and at the same time, minimize the difference between inter-address distances when generating read addresses in a channel interleaver. Consequently, interleaver parameters for sub-block channel interleaving in circumstances wherein a sub-block channel interleaver is built in accordance with the IS-2000 Release C specification are values in the rows in bold and underlined in Table 2. While interleaver parameters selection has been described for the sub-block channel interleaver built in accordance with the   IS-2000 Release C specification, it is obvious that the same thing can also be applied to systems of other standards.<br>
Fig. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an optimal interleaver parameters determining operation according to an embodiment of the present invention. Particularly, this operation is concerned with the computation of   dintra -dmin,  - An optimal (m, J)<br>
that minimizes   dintra - dmin   is selected by computing    dintra - dmin , changing (m, J).<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, when an interleaver size N, and parameters m and J are given in step 601, a parameter R is calculated by subtracting 2mxJ from N in step 603. In step 605, it is determined whether J is 1.   This is a determination, therefore, of whether an interleaving matrix has a single column or not. If J is 1, the procedure goes to step 607 ("Yes" path from decision step 605) and if J is not 1, the procedure goes to step 621 ("No" path from decision step 605). In step 607, it is determined whether R is 0(i.e., whether N is an integer multiple of 2m). On the contrary, if R is 0 (("Yes" path from decision step 607), an intra-row distance dintra is set to 0 in step 609. If R is not 0 ("No" path from decision step 607), dintra is set to 2m in step 617.<br>
After dintra is determined, it is determined whether R is less than 3x2m-2 in step 611. If R is less than 3x2m-2 ("Yes" path from decision step 61 1) a minimum inter-row distance dmin is set to 2m-2 in step 613. If R is equal to or greater than 3x2m-2 ("No" path from decision step 611)    dinter is set to 2m-1 in step 619. After dinter is determined, dinlra - dmin   is calculated in step 615.<br>
Meanwhile, if J is not 1 in step 605, dintra is set to 2m in step 621 and it is determined whether R is less than 2m-1 in step 623. If R is less than 2m-1 ("Yes" path from decision step 623)    dinter is set to (2J-3)x2m-1 in step 625 and then the procedure<br>
goes to step 615. If R is equal to or greater than 2m-1 ("No" path from decision step 623), it is determined whether R is less than 3x2m-2 in step 627. If R is less than 3x2m-2 ("Yes" path from decision step 627) , dinter is set to (4J-3)x2m-2 in step 629. If R is equal to or<br>
greater than 3x2m-2 ("No" path from decision step 627) ,  dinter is set to (2J-l)x2m-1 in<br>
step 631 and then the procedure goes to step 615.<br>
Optimal interleaver parameters m and J are achieved for a given N by computing dinlra -dmin changing (m, J). If J is one of 1, 2 and 3, a logical formula that facilitates<br>
selection of J without the repealed computation can be derived.<br>
With a description of a logical equation deriving procedure omitted, the logical equation is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
From an optimal J from Eq. (7), an optimal m is calculated by<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The selection of optimal interleaver parameters by the simple logical equations is summarized below and illustrated in Fig. 7.<br>
1.	An optimal J is obtained by Eq. (7) for a given N; and<br>
2.	mis calculated by computing Eq. (8) using N and J.<br>
Fig. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an optimal interleaver parameters determining operation according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, when N is given, a variable a is calculated by log2N -[log, N] and a variable P is calculated by 2[kigmN] in step 701. Decision step<br>
703, determines whether a is less than a first threshold, 0.5849625. If a is less than the first threshold ("Yes" path from decision step 703), another decision is made, whether N is less than P in decision step 705. If N is equal to or greater than P ("No" path from decision step 705), the procedure goes to step 707. On the contrary, if N is less than p ("Yes" path from decision step 705), J is determined to be 3 in step 713.<br>
Meanwhile, decision step 707 determines whether N is less than (3/2)xß.    If N is less than (3/2)xp ("Yes" path from decision step 707), J is determined to be 2 in step 711. Otherwise, J is determined to be 1 in step 709 ("No" path from decision step 707).<br>
If a is equal to or greater than the first threshold in step 703 ("No" path from decision step 703), a decision is made whether N is less than (3/2)xp in decision step 717. If N is less than (3/2)xß ("Yes" path from decision step 717), J is determined to be 2 in step 721. Otherwise, decision step 719 determines    whether N is less than (7/ 4)xp. If N is less than (7/4)xß ("Yes" path from decision step 719), J is determined to be 3 in step 723. Otherwise, J is determined to be 1 in step 725 ("No" path from decision step 719).<br>
As described above, optimal m and J can be calculated simply by the logical equations using N. The optimal m and J are equal to m and J resulting from repeated computation using different (m, J) values as illustrated in Table 2. This obviates the need for storing optimal m and J values according to N values.<br>
When N=2328, for example, optimal m and J values are calculated in the procedure illustrated in Fig. 7 or by Eq. (8) to Eq. (10), as follows.<br>
 (Equation Removed)<br>
For reference, Eq. (7) is derived as follows.<br>
In each case depicted in Fig. 6, Eq. (5) and Eq. (6),  dintra - d min   is determined by<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Since N=2m-J+R and 0<r j-2m when this is divided by j and then subject to a log base operation></r>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
Thus, m = Iog2(N/J)  . Using m = log 2(N/J)  , J can be expressed as a function of N for<br><br>
all the cases of A and B.<br>
A1. When J=l, since m = [log:N], R = N-2m = N-2[log,N]. Then the<br>
cases A-l, A-2 and A-3 can be expressed as functions of N. It therefore follows that:<br>

If J is 4 or more, this case is neglected because    dinlra - dmin that  intra - d min  in any of the cases where J=l,2, and 3. cannot be less<br>
Eq. (7) is obtained by selecting a case having a minimum    dintra - d min among the cases of A'-l, A'-2, A'-3, B"-l, B"-2, B"-3, B'"-l', B'"-2', and B"'-3'.<br>
Similarly, Eq. (8) is obtained by selecting a case having a minimum    dintra -d min among the cases of AM, A'-2, A'-3, B"-l, B"-2, B"-3, B'"-l", B'"-2", and B'"-3".<br>
In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention as described above, interleaver parameters m and J are simply optimized according to an interleaver size N, for P-BRO interleaving.<br>
