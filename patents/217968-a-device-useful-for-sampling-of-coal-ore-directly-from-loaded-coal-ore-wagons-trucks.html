				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a device useful for sampling of coal/ore directly from loaded coal/ore Wagons / Trucks.<br>
Sampling is a very important operation in Coal/mineral ore business. It must be very accurate and authentic for the benefit of both the supplier and the purchaser. It is very difficult particularly from the wagons/trucks after being fully loaded at the loading station. The sample of coal/ore should be taken from different position of a wagon/truck. Again the depth of sampling and amount of sample should be considerable. This is a very cumbersome job which can not be done easily by manual effort. At present in the absence of such a device sampling is being done manually by taking coal/ore sample only from the top of the wagon. The collection of required amount of sample and sizing of material is still a problem. Therefore, there is a great demand of a sampling machine which would be suitable for taking sample from a loaded wagon/truck upto a required depth of material and the required amount of material. There is also demand for a machine of sampling which would be movable and capable of taking sample material at different position of the wagons/trucks and at the same time the operation of material collection for the samples must be easy and smooth.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a device for sampling of coal/ore directly from loaded coal/ore wagons/trucks.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a device useful for collecting samples at varied depths/positions and quantity from the wagons / trucks.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a differential diameter augur drill partially enclosed in a cylinder in such a manner so as to withdraw/ collect coal/ore sample.<br><br>
The schematic diagram of an embodiment of the device of the present invention is shown in Figure 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification.<br>
The main components as depicted in Fig. 1 of the drawings are a Motorized Auger Drill (1), having differential diameter such as a larger central diameter (1C) and tapered holding (1A) and cutting (1B) ends, a Cylindrical steel tube (2) enclosing part fo the drill, a Motor (3) to drive the augur drill, cantilever beam (4), hydraulic ram (6), Swiveling arrangement (5), a Mobile Platform/Van (7) and Rail/ Tyres (8).<br>
Accordingly the a device for sampling of coal/ore directly from loaded coal/ore wagons/trucks which comprises a differential diameter augur drill (1) characterized in that the said augur drill (1) having a larger diameter (1C) middle portion and tapering towards both ends, the holding end (1A) and the cutting end (1B), the holding end (1A) of the said augur drill (1) being partially incorporated inside a cylindrical steel tube (2) having diameter lower than the maximum diameter (1C) of the said augur drill (1), the said holding end (1A) of the said augur drill (1) being coupled to a prime mover (3), the said steel tube (2) and augur drill (1) being mounted by known conventional means on a movable cantilever beam (4) which is being hydraulically operated by a ram (6), the said beam and hydraulic ram being swiveling fixed by a platform (5), the said a platform (5) is rotatebly fixed on to a mobile platform (7).<br>
The device of the present invention, essentially a sampler consisting of a tube (2) and a motorized auger (1) having differential diameter of larger central diameter (1C) and tapered holding end (1A) and tapered cutting end (1B), the motorized augur and tube assembly being mounted on the cantilever beam (4) which can be moved up and down by a hydraulic Ram (6). Again the whole system of sampler arrangement can be swiveled to any position all around with the<br>
arrangement (6). The whole system is mounted on a van over rail/tyres, having its own motor and pumping arrangement for hydraulic power.<br>
To take out a sample from a wagon the sampler van will be taken near to the required wagon/truck, then the beam will be pulled down by the ram and at the same time, the auger will be rotated by the motor (3). The coal/ore in the loaded wagon/truck will be drilled and the drilled/cut coal will be automatically conveyed to the upward side and will be accumulated within the tube. After the required depth is reached or the required volume is filled, the motor will be stopped. As the cutting edge of auger drill near to the outer end of the tube is of higher diameter, the cylindrical steel tube will be easily getting in to the material load. After drilling is over, the beam with tube will be taken upward and then the beam will be swiveled to the required position to unload the accumulated coal. At the required position the auger is driven in opposite direction and the broken coal sample is thus collected very easily.<br>
The novelty of the device of the present invention is that it is capable of directly withdrawing/collecting coal/ore sampler from the loaded wagons of coal/ore. The inventive step of the device of the present invention resides in the partially encased Augur drill having differential diameter such as larger central diameter and tapered holding and cutting ends. More specifically the differential diameter augur drill being partially encased in a tube results in a novel device which is capable of withdrawing / collecting sample directly from the lose stack of loaded wagons.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention:<br>
1)	This device is useful for collecting samples of coal/ore from the<br>
wagons without any manual effort/operation.<br>
2)	It can collect sample for a required quantity.<br><br>
3)	It crushes the ore/coal to facilitate the subsequent experimental<br>
process.<br>
4)	It reaches the required depth and collects the sample in a single<br>
operation and discharges the sample very easily by opposite rotation.<br>
5)	it can collect sample from any required position of the loaded wagons.<br>
6)	Its operation is easy and can be remotely controlled from a distance.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A device for sampling of coal/ore directly from loaded coal/ore wagons/trucks<br>
which comprises a differential diameter augur drill (1) characterized in that the<br>
said augur drill (1) having a larger diameter (1C) middle portion and tapering<br>
towards both ends, the holding end (1A) and the cutting end (1B), the holding<br>
end (1A) of the said augur drill (1) being partially incorporated inside a cylindrical<br>
steel tube (2) having diameter lower than the maximum diameter (1C) of the said<br>
augur drill (1), the said holding end (1A) of the said augur drill (1) being coupled<br>
to a prime mover (3), the said steel tube (2) and augur drill (1) being mounted by<br>
known conventional means on a movable cantilever beam (4) which is being<br>
hydraulically operated by a ram (6), the said beam and hydraulic ram being<br>
swiveling fixed by a platform (5), the said a platform (5) is rotatebly fixed on to a<br>
mobile platform (7).<br>
2.	A device for sampling of coal/ore directly from loaded coal/ore wagons/trucks<br>
substantially as herein described with reference to Figure 1 of the drawings<br>
accompanying this specification.<br></td>
