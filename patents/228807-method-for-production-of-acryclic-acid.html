				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a method for producing acrylic<br>
acid by distilling an acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
without using an azeotropic solvent, obtaining crude acrylic<br>
acid as a column bottom stream and/or a column side stream<br>
of a distillation column, and then crystallizing the crude<br>
acrylic acid.<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
Commercial production of acrylic acid generally resorts<br>
to the method of propylene oxidation which consists in<br>
subjecting propylene and/or acrolein to catalytic gas phase<br>
oxidation. When acrylic acid is produced by this method of<br>
propylene oxidation, the step of propylene oxidation gives<br>
rise to such impurities as water, acids like propionic acid,<br>
acetic acid, and maleic acid, and aldehydes like acetone,<br>
acrolein, furfural, and formaldehyde in the form of<br>
by-products. The gas containing these by-products is<br>
absorbed as an acrylic acid-containing solution generally<br>
via contact with an absorbent and obtainedthe solution is<br>
subsequently separated the absorbent by distillation etc.<br>
One known method, for example, produces acrylic acid<br>
of high purity by absorbing an acrylic acid-containing gas<br>
resulting from catalytic gas phase oxidation with a high<br>
boiling solvent, distilling the acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution thereby separating it into the solvent and crude<br>
acrylic acid, and subsequently subjecting the crude acrylic<br>
acid to a process of crystallization (JP-A-1997-227445) .<br>
• This method comprises carrying out a step of absorption of<br>
an acrylic acid-containing gas after the gas has been cooled<br>
with a venturi, carrying out a step of removing a low boiling<br>
compound subsequent to the step of absorption, thereafter<br>
separating the acrylic acid-containing solution in a<br>
distillation column into a high boiling substance and a low<br>
boiling substance, withdrawing crude acrylic acid as a liquid<br>
via the intermediary stage of the column, and purifying the<br>
crude acrylic acid by a step of crystallization.<br>
When an aqueous solution can be used as an absorbent<br>
for acrylic acid in the place of an expensive high boiling<br>
solvent, the use of this aqueous solution proves economical.<br>
Particularly, when this aqueous solution is capable of<br>
absorbing the acrylic acid-containing solution in high<br>
concentration, the use of the aqueous solution is efficient<br>
in respect that it results in decreasing the amount of treatment<br>
at the subsequent steps of purification. A method has been<br>
disclosed which comprises introducing an acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas into an absorption column, absorbing with<br>
aqueous solution containing acetic acid thereby effecting<br>
absorption of acrylic acid therein, and producing as the bottom<br>
liquid of the absorption column an acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution composed of 50 - 80 wt% of acrylic acid, 2-5 wt%<br>
of acetic acid, and the balance of water (JP-A-1993-246941) .<br>
This method obtains purified acrylic acid by subjecting<br>
the acrylic acid-containing solution to azeotropic<br>
dehydration using a mixed solution of two or more azeotropic<br>
solvents and subsequently passing the product of dehydration<br>
through such steps as the removal of high boiling substance.<br>
Still another method has been disclosed which, in the<br>
absorption with water of an acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
resulting from a reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation,<br>
• comprises supplying the recovery water emanating from the<br>
step of azeotropic dehydration to the absorption column,<br>
supplying the resultant acrylic acid-containing solution to<br>
a stripping column, and obtaining an acrylic acid solution<br>
composed of 70.9 wt. % of acrylic acid, 25.6 wt. % of water,<br>
and 2.0 wt. % of acetic acid via the bottom of the stripping<br>
column (JP-A-2001-199931) . This method obtains purified<br>
acrylic acid by performing azeotropic dehydration of the<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution and subsequently subjecting<br>
the product of dehydration to the step of crystallization.<br>
For the purpose of obtaining crude acrylic acid<br>
substantially destitute of water by treating an aqueous<br>
acrylic acid solution by distillation, it is common to perform<br>
azeotropic distillation using an azeotropic solvent. The<br>
azeotropic distillation necessitates a step of solvent<br>
separation in order to reuse the azeotropic solvent. In<br>
JP-A-1993-246941 and JP-A-2001-199931 which disclose<br>
inventions involving use of an aqueous type absorbing solvent<br>
mentioned above, azeotropic dehydration using an azeotropic<br>
solvent is described. Thus, the development of a method which<br>
produces acrylic acid without a step of azeotropic<br>
distillation has been yearned for enthusiastically.<br>
An attempt to obtain crude acrylic acid substantially<br>
destitute of water without performing azeotropic distillation<br>
results in causing acrylic acid to distill in a considerable<br>
amount from the top of the distillation column in consequence<br>
of azeotropy between acrylic acid and water, increasing the<br>
amount of acrylic acid expelled out of the system, and causing<br>
degradation of yield. Under these existing circumstances,<br>
the development of a method for producing acrylic acid in<br>
a high yield has been yearned for.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventor has found that the step of production<br>
of acrylic acid is enabled to obviate the necessity for<br>
azeotropic distillation by using an acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution of high concentration, that when the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution is withdrawn as a column side stream<br>
and a column bottom stream of the distillation column, obtained<br>
solution can be separated from a high boiling substance and<br>
a low boiling substance thereby obtaining crude acrylic acid,<br>
and that the crude acrylic acid can be purified by<br>
crystallization. Particularly by withdrawing the crude<br>
acrylic acid in a gaseous form in the distillation step prior<br>
to the crystallization, it is made possible to expel such<br>
high boiling substances as polymerization inhibitor and a<br>
substance causing coloration and obtain acrylic acid of high<br>
purity through several repetitions of crystallization. This<br>
invention has been perfected based on this knowledge.<br>
By obtaining the crude acrylic acid from the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution emanating from the distillation<br>
column of a column bottom stream and/or the column side stream<br>
and crystallizing the crude acrylic acid according to this<br>
invention, it is made possible to produce acrylic acid without<br>
performing the step of azeotropic dehydration.<br>
This invention is particularly suitable for the<br>
purification of an acrylic acid-containing solution having<br>
a high acrylic acid concentration. The acrylic acid of such<br>
high concentration is attained with an effectively utilizing<br>
use of the recycle gas at the step of absorption and decrease<br>
the acrylic acid loss. Further, since the amount of acrylic<br>
acid contained in the recycle gas is decreased, the catalyst<br>
enjoys an increased service life. Moreover, the process is<br>
simplified and the productivity is exalted because the<br>
• purification is carried out without the azeotropic<br>
dehydration. The invention will be described in detail below.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Figure is a process diagram illustrating one example<br>
of the preferred mode of embodying this invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The first aspect of this invention is directed toward<br>
providing a method for producing acrylic acid by a procedure<br>
comprising steps of<br>
a) introducing an acrylic acid-containing gas obtained<br>
by the react ion of catalytic gas phase oxidation of raw material<br>
of acrylic acid into an absorption column and brought into<br>
contact with an absorbing aqueous solution thereby obtaining<br>
an acrylic acid-containing solution,<br>
b) distilling the acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
without using an azeotropic solvent thereto thereby obtaining<br>
crude acrylic acid as a column bottom stream and/or a column<br>
side stream, and<br>
c) supplying the crude acrylic acid to a step of<br>
crystallization and melt crystallizing it thereby obtaining<br>
purified acrylic acid. The bottom liquid of the step of b)<br>
mentioned above may be supplied to a device for decomposing<br>
acrylic acid dimer so as to recover acrylic acid. Thus, the<br>
acrylic acid can be produced in a high yield. One example<br>
of the preferred mode of embodying this invention will be<br>
described below with reference to The Figure.<br>
First, such a molecular oxygen-containing gas as air<br>
3, such raw material 1 for acrylic acid as propylene and/or<br>
acrolein, and a diluting gas 5 are mixed. At this step, after<br>
the completion of the step of absorbing acrylic acid, a recycle<br>
• gas 34 which is discharged via the top of the absorption column<br>
may be also mixed with air, propylene and/or acrolein, and<br>
diluting gas. The resultant mixed gas (hereinafter referred<br>
to occasionally as "raw material gas") is supplied to a reactor<br>
20 packed with a catalyst 10 for catalytic gas phase oxidation<br>
and subjected to the reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation<br>
so as to obtain an acrylic acid-containing gas 25. This gas<br>
25 is supplied to the bottom of an absorption column 30 and<br>
an absorbing aqueous solution 33 is supplied via the top of<br>
the absorption column 30 and the acrylic acid-containing gas<br>
25 and the absorbing aqueous solution 33 are brought into<br>
mutual contact. In this specification, the part of a<br>
discharged gas 32 via the top of the absorption column 30<br>
which is circulated to the reactor will be referred to as<br>
"recycle gas" and the part thereof which is discarded to the<br>
out side of system will be referred to as "waste gas." In<br>
this invention, only the recycle gas 34 is introduced into<br>
a cooling column 36, cooled by gas-liquid contact with an<br>
absorbing water 33' newly supplied into the system and enabled<br>
induce condensation of a condensable substance contained in<br>
the recycle gas, and thereafter circulated to the reactor<br>
20. The condensate so formed may be mixed with the absorbing<br>
water 33' mentioned above and supplied as the absorbing aqueous<br>
solution 33 to the absorption column 30. By adjusting the<br>
temperature of the top of the absorption column with a heat<br>
exchanger 37 disposed in the absorption column and cooling<br>
the recycle gas, it is made possible to obtain an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 35 containing acrylic acid of high<br>
concentration via the bottom of the absorption column.<br>
The acrylic acid-containing solution 35 is supplied to<br>
an acrolein separation column 31, which separates the<br>
contained acrolein from the solution and delivers an acrylic<br>
• acid-containing solution 35' having the acrolein content<br>
decreased via the bottom of the column. Incidentally, when<br>
the distillate from the top of the separation column 31 is<br>
circulated to the bottom of the absorption column 30, the<br>
acrylic acid distilled in conjunction with acrolein can be<br>
effectively recovered.<br>
Then, the acrylic acid-containing solution 35' is<br>
supplied to the intermediate stage of a first distillation<br>
column 40 so as to remove the contained low boiling substance<br>
via the top of the column and then produce crude acrylic acid<br>
41 substantially destitute of water as a column side stream.<br>
When the crude acrylic acid 41 is supplied to a crystallizing<br>
device 50, acrylic acid 60 is obtained as a finished product.<br>
The high boiling substance contained in bottom liquid 43 of<br>
the first distillation column 40 contains acrylic acid dimer.<br>
Thus, the bottom liquid 43 is supplied to a second distillation<br>
column 70 provided on the bottom thereof with a thin layer<br>
evaporator 73 so as to concentrate the acrylic acid dimer<br>
and then the dimer is retained in a dimer decomposing tank<br>
75 so as to effect thermal decomposition of the dimer into<br>
acrylic acid. This acrylic acid is circulated via the second<br>
distillation column 70 to the first distillation column 40<br>
so as to recover as a finished product.<br>
This invention is characterized by effecting<br>
distillation of the acrylic acid-containing solution without<br>
addition of an azeotropic solvent thereto as described above.<br>
Advisably, therefore, the acrylic acid content of this<br>
solution exceeds 80wt. %, preferably 85 wt. %, and particularly<br>
87 wt. %. When the distillation is carried out in the absence<br>
of an azeotropic solvent while the acrylic acid content falls<br>
short of 80 wt. %, huge utilities are required for obtaining<br>
crude acrylic acid from the bottom and the side of the<br>
distillation column and the distillation column itself is<br>
inevitably required to be enlarged. This invention is aimed<br>
at providing a method for producing acrylic acid in a high<br>
yield with lowered acrylic acid loss without steps of<br>
azeotropic dehydration and solvent recovery.<br>
In the present specification, the term "low boiling<br>
substance" refers to a substance having a lower boiling point<br>
than acrylic acid in the normal state and the term "high boiling<br>
substance" refers to a substance having a higher boiling point<br>
than acrylic acid in the normal state. The term "azeotropic<br>
solvent" refers to a solvent which forms an azeotropic mixture<br>
with water. The azeotropic solvents enumerated in<br>
JP-A-2001-19931 may be cited as concrete examples. The term<br>
"condensable substance" refers to a substance which is a liquid<br>
under the atmospheric pressure, the term "distillation"<br>
refers to a method which comprises heating a solution to the<br>
boiling point thereof and separating a volatile component<br>
contained therein, the term "stripping (in distillation)"<br>
refers to a method which comprises supplying a stripping gas<br>
and causing a target substance in a solution to pass into<br>
the gas phase, and the term "crystallization" refers to an<br>
operation of producing crystals from the liquid phase and<br>
the gas phase. Then, the term "step of dynamic<br>
crystallization" refers to a method of crystallization which<br>
induces movement of the liquid phase by forced convection<br>
caused with a pump etc. during crystallization and the term<br>
"step of static crystallization" refers to a method of<br>
crystallization which induces movement of the liquid phase<br>
exclusively by spontaneous convection requiring no pump. Now,<br>
this invention will be described in detail below.<br>
(1) Step of acrylic acid absorption<br>
For the purpose of obtaining an acrylic acid-containing<br>
• solution of high concentration, it is necessary either to<br>
decrease the amount of a water component introduced into the<br>
system or increase the amount of a water component discarded<br>
to the out side of system. For the purpose of minimizing<br>
the acrylic acid loss discarded to the out side of system,<br>
it is advisable to recycle the exhaust gas emanating via the<br>
top of the absorption column to the reactor. In this invention,<br>
by cooling the recycle gas thereby decreasing the amount of<br>
a water component forwarding the recycle gas to the reactor,<br>
it is made possible to decrease the amount of the water<br>
component introduced into the absorption column and obtain<br>
an acrylic acid-containing solution of high concentration<br>
while the acrylic acid loss is decreased. When the whole<br>
amount of the discharged gas from the absorption column is<br>
cooled and even the amount of the water component discarded<br>
to the out side of system is consequently decreased, the<br>
absorption ratio of acrylic acid is not enhanced but degraded<br>
far more than when the cooling is omitted. Thus, the part<br>
of the discharged gas of the acrylic acid absorption column<br>
which is recycled to the reactor, namely the so-called recycle<br>
gas, alone is cooled so as to induce condensation of the water<br>
component and enhance the absorption ratio of acrylic acid.<br>
The cooling of the recycle gas results in inducing condensation<br>
of not merely the water component but also the acid component,<br>
effecting a decrease in the amount of the aid component supplied<br>
to the reactor, and eventually preventing the catalyst from<br>
being deteriorated by the acid. The condensate produced by<br>
this cooling may be returned to the absorption column or<br>
discharged to the out side of system instead of being so<br>
returned. Though the ratio of acrylic acid loss is not varied<br>
very much between these two choices, the return of the<br>
condensate to the absorption column is at an advantage in<br>
obviating the necessity for the disposal of the waste liquid.<br>
The decrease of the amount of the water component<br>
introduced into the system may be accomplished by a method<br>
which comprises removing the water component contained in<br>
the molecular oxygen-containing gas to be supplied to the<br>
reactor and thereafter advancing the gas to the reactor.<br>
In this invention, propylene and/or acrolein can be used<br>
as the raw material gas of acrylic acid. While the reactor<br>
20 does not need to be particularly restricted but is only<br>
required to be capable of performing a reaction of catalytic<br>
gas phase oxidation. The shell-and-tube type reactor can be<br>
used advantageously in respect that it excels in the efficiency<br>
of reaction. By packing the reactor 20 with the well-known<br>
catalyst 10 for catalytic gas phase oxidation and then bringing<br>
the raw material gas into contact with such a molecular<br>
oxygen-containing gas as oxygen or air, it is made possible<br>
to effect the oxidation of the raw material gas. When<br>
propylene is used as the raw material gas, the propylene<br>
concentration is in the range of 7 - 15 vol% and the molecular<br>
oxygen concentration is such that the ratio of propylene :<br>
molecular oxygen (by volume) falls in the range of 1 : 1.0<br>
- 2.0. Air may be used as the source of supply of molecular<br>
oxygen. When the air contains a water component, it is<br>
preferred to be dehumidified prior to the supply thereof to<br>
the reactor. The dehumidification is preferred because it<br>
is capable of decreasing the amount of water introduced into<br>
the reactor and consequently decreasing the amount of water<br>
introduced to the absorption column. It is permissible to<br>
use an oxygen-enriched air or purified oxygen in the place<br>
of air. As concrete examples of the diluting gas 5, nitrogen,<br>
carbon dioxide, and other inert gases may be cited.<br>
In this invention, the recycle gas may be introduced<br>
• into the reactor after it has been cooled to induce condensation<br>
of a condensable substance. When the recycle gas is used in<br>
this manner, the recycle gas is deprived of the water component<br>
in advance so that the water concentration in the raw material<br>
gas supplied to the reactor falls in the range of 0 - 10 vol%,<br>
preferably in the range of 0 - 7 vol%, and particularly in<br>
the range of 0 - 6 vol%. If the concentration exceeds 10 vol%,<br>
the excess will possibly result in causing the water component<br>
supplied via the reactor to the absorption column to increase<br>
the ratio of acrylic acid loss. The total acid concentration<br>
is so adjusted at to fall in the range of 0 - 0.2 vol% and<br>
more preferably in the range of 0 - 0.1 vol%. If the total<br>
acid concentration exceeds 0.2 vol%, the excess will possibly<br>
result in accelerating the deterioration of the catalyst by<br>
oxidation. The recycle gas contains unaltered propylene and<br>
acrolien, oxygen, diluting gas, etc. in addition to the water<br>
component and the acid component. The propylene, oxygen,<br>
water component concentration, and total acid concentration<br>
mentioned above can be easily adjusted by computing the amount<br>
of the water component contained in the recycle gas and the<br>
amount thereof to be incorporated in the raw material gas<br>
so as to enable the water component concentration and the<br>
total acid concentration in the raw material gas to fall in<br>
the optimum ranges mentioned above and computing the propylene<br>
concentration and the oxygen concentration in the recycle<br>
gas thereby deciding the amount of propylene and the amount<br>
of air to be newly supplied to the reactor. The term "total<br>
acid" as used herein refers to compounds having a carboxyl<br>
group. The recycle gas contains acrylic acid, formic acid,<br>
and acetic acid as compounds answering the description.<br>
The reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation performed<br>
by using propylene as the raw material is generally carried<br>
out in two stages by the use of two kinds of catalyst 10 for<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation. The catalyst for the first<br>
stage of this reaction is capable of forming acrolein mainly<br>
by the gas phase oxidation of the raw material gas containing<br>
propylene in a gas phase and the catalyst for the second stage<br>
of the reaction is capable of forming acrylic acid mainly<br>
by the gas phase oxidation of the raw material containing<br>
acrolein. As the catalyst for the first stage of the reaction,<br>
a complex oxide containing iron, molybdenum, and bismuth may<br>
be cited. As the catalyst for the second stage of the reaction,<br>
a catalyst having vanadium as an essential component may be<br>
cited.<br>
The Figure depicts the mode of performing the two-stage<br>
reaction mentioned above with a single reactor. Optionally,<br>
these reactions may be performed in a tandem system having<br>
two different reactors connected to each other. The acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas 25 which is obtained by the reaction of<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation contains 5-14 vol% of acrylic<br>
acid, 0.1 - 2.5 vol% of acetic acid, 0.5-3 vol% of molecular<br>
oxygen, and 5-36 vol% of water and other components which<br>
are by-products of reaction such as the unaltered component<br>
of the raw material gas, propionic acid, maleic acid, acetone,<br>
acrolein, furfural, formaldehyde and COx.<br>
In the acrylic acid absorption column 30, any of the<br>
known methods of contact may be used for establishing contact<br>
between the acrylic acid-containing gas and the absorbing<br>
aqueous solution. As concrete examples of such methods of<br>
contact, crossflow contact devices using a bubble-cap tray,<br>
a uniflat tray, a perforated tray, a jet tray, a valve tray,<br>
and a venturi tray; and counter current contact devices using<br>
a turbo-grid tray, a dual flow tray, a ripple tray, Kittel<br>
tray, gauze type, sheet type, and grid type structuredpackings<br>
and random packings may be cited.<br>
As the absorbing aqueous solution 33 to be used in this<br>
invention, a wide variety of aqueous solutions which are<br>
capable of absorbing acrylic acid are available. The<br>
condensate resulting from cooling the recycle gas may be used<br>
as the absorbing aqueous solution. Since the condensate often<br>
contains acrylic acid, it is preferred to be reused as the<br>
absorbing aqueous solution. The temperature of the absorbing<br>
aqueous solution at the time of introduction falls in the<br>
range of 0 - 50°C and preferably in the range of 10 - 40°C.<br>
The flow rate ratio of mass of the absorbing water (which<br>
excludes the condensate from the recycle gas and corresponds<br>
to the absorbing water 33' shown in The Figure) to the acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas may be properly selected to suit the target<br>
acrylic acid concentration. The absorption of acrylic acid<br>
is effected by counter current contact using a mass flow rate<br>
of the absorbing water of 0.1 - 1.5 times, preferably 0.1<br>
- 1.0 times, and particularly 0.15 - 0.8 times to the mass<br>
flow rate of acrylic acid contained in the acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas. If the mass flow rate ratio falls short<br>
of the level of 0.1 times, the shortage will possibly induce<br>
an extreme decrease of the efficiency of the acrylic acid<br>
absorption column. Conversely, if it exceeds the level of<br>
1.5 times, the excess will render the acquisition of an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution of high concentration difficult.<br>
Incidentally, the absorbing water may contain therein for<br>
the purpose of preventing such polymerizing substances as<br>
acrylic acid from succumbing to polymerization one or more<br>
compounds selected from the group consisting of N-oxyl<br>
compounds, phenol compounds, manganese salts such as<br>
manganese acetate, copper salts of dialkyl-dithiocarbamic<br>
acid such as copper dibutylthiocarbamate, nitroso compounds,<br>
• amine compounds, and phenothiazine which are cited as in<br>
JP-A-2001-348360, 2001-348358, and 2001-348359.<br>
The acrylic acid absorption column is generally operated<br>
above normal pressure. In this invention, the column top<br>
pressure (gauge pressure) is set in the range of 0 - 0.4 MPa,<br>
preferably in the range of 0 - 0.1 MPa, and particularly in<br>
the range of 0 - 0.03 MPa. If this pressure falls short of<br>
0 MPa (gauge pressure), the shortage will necessitate a<br>
pressure decreasing device and consequently add to the cost<br>
of equipment and the cost of utilities. Conversely, if the<br>
pressure exceeds 0.4 MPa (gauge pressure), the excess will<br>
possibly require the temperature of the absorption column<br>
to be elevated considerably for the purpose of discharging<br>
a low boiling substance from the column top and consequently<br>
degrade absorption efficiency. The column top temperature<br>
falls generally in the range of 30 - 85°C and particularly<br>
in the range of 40 - 80°C. In this invention, the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 35 comprising 80 - 98 wt. % of acrylic<br>
acid, 1 - 19 wt. % of water, and 1 - 10 wt. % of impurities<br>
(such as acids like acetic acid, maleic acid, and propionic<br>
acid, and aldehydes like furfural formaldehyde) is obtained<br>
under the conditions of absorption mentioned above.<br>
The method for cooling the recycle gas does not need<br>
to be particularly restricted. It is only required to resort<br>
to a device which is capable of condensing the condensable<br>
substances contained in the recycle gas. As concrete examples<br>
of the device answering the description, the shell-and-tube<br>
type heat exchanger, fin tube type heat exchanger, air cooled<br>
heat exchanger, double pipe heat exchanger, coil type heat<br>
exchanger, direct contact type heat exchanger, and plate type<br>
heat exchanger may be cited. Since the condensate more often<br>
than not contains such polymerizable substances as acrylic<br>
• acid, however, the method of cooling which resorts to the<br>
combination of the cooling column 36 and such a cooling device<br>
39 as illustrated in the Figure is commendable in respect<br>
that it permits easy supply of a polymerization inhibitor.<br>
The cooling temperature of the recycle gas does not need<br>
to be particularly restricted. When the recycle gas is cooled<br>
condensation, the concentration of the water component<br>
therein falls in the range of 0 - 10 vol%, preferably in the<br>
range of 0 - 7 vol%, and particularly in the range of 0 -<br>
6 vol% and further the concentration of the total acid falls<br>
in the range of 0 - 0.2 vol%, preferably in the range of 0<br>
- 0.1 vol% based on the total amount of the raw material gas<br>
supplied to the reactor. When air is used as the molecular<br>
oxygen-containing gas, the air contains a water component.<br>
The amount of the water component which exists after the recycle<br>
gas is cooled is computed from the amount of the air supplied,<br>
the aforementioned preferred concentration of the water<br>
component in the raw material gas and the amount of the raw<br>
material gas supplied. The cooling of Recycle gas is carried<br>
out till the concentration the water component reach the value<br>
found by the computation. In this invention, the recycle gas<br>
is cooled to a temperature which is 1 - 50°C, preferably 2<br>
- 40°C, and particularly preferably 3- 30°C lower than the<br>
temperature of the waste gas.<br>
Consequently, the bottom liquid of the absorption column<br>
having an extremely high acrylic acid concentration is not<br>
less than 80 wt. % can be obtained.<br>
(2) Separation of acrolein<br>
The acrylic acid-containing solution 35 possibly<br>
contains acrolein which is the raw material of acrylic acid.<br>
For the purpose of removing the contained acrolein, the<br>
solution may be supplied to the acrolein separation column<br>
31 and subjected to a treatment for the separation of acrolein.<br>
The separation column does not need to be particularly<br>
discriminated but is only required to be capable of separating<br>
acrolein. A packed column, a plate column (tray column), etc.<br>
are available for the separation. The separation column may<br>
be properly selected between the methods of distillation and<br>
stripping, depending on the concentration of acrylic acid<br>
and the concentration of acrolein in the solution. In the<br>
case of distillation, it is advisable to set the column top<br>
pressure (absolute value) in a range of 20 - 800 hPa, preferably<br>
in the range of 40 - 600 hPa, and particularly in the range<br>
of 60-400hPa. If thispressure falls short of 20hPa (absolute<br>
pressure), the shortage will be at a disadvantage in requiring<br>
the column, condenser, and vacuum device to be enlarged and<br>
consequently necessitating an expense of equipment.<br>
Conversely, if the pressure exceeds 800 hPa (absolute<br>
pressure), the excess will be at a disadvantage in heightening<br>
the temperature inside the separation column and consequently<br>
adding to the possibility of polymerization. The column top<br>
temperature falls generally in the range of 30 - 100°C and<br>
particularly in the range of 40 - 80°C. The column bottom<br>
temperature falls generally in the range of 40 - 110°C and<br>
particularly in the range of 50 - 90°C. Even in the case of<br>
stripping, the separation of acrolein can be attained by any<br>
of the hitherto well-known methods. By using these conditions<br>
of separation, it is made possible to decrease the amount<br>
of acrolein and consequently obtain an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution 35' having an acrylic acid<br>
concentration even not less than 80 wt. %.<br>
(3) Distillation of acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
The acrylic acid-containing solution 35 or 35' is<br>
supplied to the first distillation column 40, which discharges<br>
• a high boiling substance via the bottom thereof and a low<br>
boiling substance via the top thereof and separates crude<br>
acrylic acid substantially destitute of water as a column<br>
bottom stream and/or a column side stream. The first<br>
distillation column 40 does not need to be particularly<br>
restricted but is only required to be capable of recovering<br>
crude acrylic acid. A packed column, a plate column (tray<br>
column), etc. for example, are available for the recovery.<br>
In this invention, crude acrylic acid is obtained as<br>
a column bottom stream and/or column side stream. Such<br>
distillation condition is operated so that low boiling<br>
substance such as water and acetic acid can be separated,<br>
it may be selected depending on the concentration of acrylic<br>
acid in the acrylic acid-containing solution 35 to be<br>
introduced and the purity of the crude acrylic acid aimed<br>
at. Commendably, the column top pressure (absolute pressure)<br>
is set in the range of 20 - 400 hPa, preferably in the range<br>
of 30 hPa - 300 hPa, and particularly in the range of 30 -<br>
200 hPa. If this pressure falls short of 20 hPa (absolute<br>
pressure), the shortage will be at a disadvantage in requiring<br>
the column, condenser, and vacuum device to be enlarged and<br>
the cost of equipment to be unduly increased. Conversely,<br>
if the pressure exceeds 400 hPa (absolute pressure) , the excess<br>
will be at a disadvantage in heightening the temperature inside<br>
the distillation column 40 and adding to the possibility of<br>
polymerization. The column top temperature falls generally<br>
in the range of 30 - 70°C and particularly in the range of<br>
40-60°C. Then, the columnbottomtemperature falls generally<br>
in the range of 70 - 120°C and particularly in the range of<br>
80 - 110°C. The distillation performed under these conditions<br>
produces crude acrylic acid containing substantially no water<br>
and having an acetic acid content in the range of 0 - 1.0<br>
• wt. % as a column bottom stream and/or a column side stream<br>
of the distillation column.<br>
During the distillation, a polymerization inhibitor may<br>
be added to the reflux liquid for the purpose of preventing<br>
such polymerizable substances as acrylic acid from succumbing<br>
to polymerization. As the polymerization inhibitor, the<br>
aforementioned various polymerization inhibitors which can<br>
be added to the absorbing water may be adopted.<br>
When the column side stream is withdrawn in a vaporous<br>
form, part of such high boiling substances as polymerization<br>
inhibitor and substance causing coloration which are<br>
generated within the column can be removed. Thus, high<br>
purified acrylic acid can be obtained by performing the step<br>
of crystallization up to several repetitions. Specifically,<br>
since the reflux liquid flows from the top toward the bottom<br>
of the column, a liquid collecting device disposed inside<br>
the distillation column is capable of withdrawing the column<br>
side stream in a liquid form. The polymerization inhibitor<br>
which has been added to the distillation column, however,<br>
has a high boiling point and cannot exist in a vaporous form<br>
in the distillation column and persists as dissolved in the<br>
liquid phase inside the column. When the column side stream<br>
is withdrawn in a liquid state, therefore, the withdrawn liquid<br>
inevitably entrains such involatile component such as<br>
polymerization inhibitor. When the column side stream is<br>
withdrawn in the vaporous form, however, acrylic acid can<br>
be obtained in a state deprived of such nonvolatile substances<br>
as polymerization inhibitor.<br>
For the sake of enabling the distillation column to<br>
withdraw the column side stream in the vaporous form while<br>
accomplishing the inherent object of distillation, the<br>
pressures in the column side part and the column top part<br>
are required to be so controlled as to satisfy this relation,<br>
pressure in the column bottom part &gt; pressure in the column<br>
side part &gt; pressure in the column top part. If the pressure<br>
in the column top part and the pressure in the column side<br>
part are equal, the essential distillation which resides in<br>
separating a target component by virtue of the difference<br>
of boiling points will not be fulfilled because the whole<br>
amount of the vapor is withdrawn from the column side part.<br>
To be specific, control the pressure of the column top part<br>
to the value suited for distillation by use of a vacuum device<br>
(not shown) and then the pressure of the column side part<br>
is made to surpass the pressure of the column top part with<br>
the same vacuum device. By setting these differences of<br>
pressure, it is made possible to withdraw the column side<br>
stream in the vaporous form from the column side part.<br>
Incidentally, the pressure of the column side part relative<br>
to the pressure of the column top part may be properly selected,<br>
depending on the amount of the column side stream, the position<br>
of withdrawing in the column side part, and the amount of<br>
impurities to be contained. The proper difference between<br>
the pressure in the column top part and the pressure in the<br>
column side part may be set by performing the distillation<br>
under the pressure of the column side part which is made in<br>
advance to surpass the pressure of the column top part and<br>
then controlling the relevant pressures based on the<br>
composition of the produced column side stream and the amount<br>
of distillation.<br>
In this invention, the term "column side stream" means<br>
the flow drawn from the column side part of the distillation<br>
column and the term "column side part" means the position<br>
excluding the column top part and the column bottom part.<br>
The position for withdrawing the column side stream, therefore,<br>
may be properly selected anywhere in the column side part,<br>
depending on the target substance for distillation and the<br>
conditions of distillation. For the purpose of efficiently<br>
removing the involatile component in the plate column, for<br>
example, it is appropriate to have a withdrawing port disposed<br>
above the pertinent plate in the column so as to allow only<br>
the vaporous substance to be withdrawn but not allow the liquid<br>
on the plate to be withdrawn.<br>
This invention is characterized by obviating the<br>
necessity of using an azeotropic solvent. Since the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution of high concentration can be<br>
prepared at the step of absorption, such low boiling substances<br>
as water and acetic acid which are contained in the solution<br>
can be efficiently separated as the column top distillate<br>
of the first distillation column 40 without requiring use<br>
of an azeotropic solvent. Further, the use of an azeotropic<br>
solvent possibly results in inducing oil-water separation<br>
in the distillation column during the azeotropic dehydration<br>
and hindering the effect of preventing polymerization because<br>
of the local presence of the polymerization inhibitor in the<br>
water phase or the oil phase. The stability of polymerization<br>
in the distillation column, therefore, is effectively derived<br>
from no use of an azeotropic solvent. The absence of the use<br>
of an azeotropic solvent is also at an advantage in permitting<br>
the distillate to be used as an acetic acid-containing aqueous<br>
solution without entailing oil-water separation. It has been<br>
found that the azeotropic distillation becomes substantially<br>
inf easible when the acrylic acid concentration in the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution exceeds 80 wt. %. If an azeotropic<br>
solvent is used during the distillation of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution of such high concentration, the<br>
separation between the oil phase (azeotropic solvent phase)<br>
 and the water phase will become difficult owing to the high<br>
acrylic acid concentration in the distillate. Even if this<br>
separation is attained, the water phase will have the<br>
azeotropic solvent dissolved therein in a large amount. When<br>
the water phase containing acrylic acid is directly circulated<br>
to the absorption column, therefore, the azeotropic solvent<br>
is circulated also to the reactor and consequently suffered<br>
to deteriorate the catalyst and curtail the service life of<br>
the catalyst. On the other hand, if the acrylic acid<br>
concentration on the distillate is lowered, the crude acrylic<br>
acid is consequently compelled to contain the azeotropic<br>
solvent in a large amount, it becomes difficult to obtain<br>
the crude acrylic acid having purity enough for a finished<br>
product even by performing the crystallization up to several<br>
repetitions.<br>
When the distillation is performed with no use to<br>
azeotropic distillation as contemplated by this invention,<br>
azeotropy occurs between the acrylic acid and water, induces<br>
distillation of a considerable amount of acrylic acid from<br>
the column top part of the distillation column, and entails<br>
acrylic acid loss. In this invention, therefore, it is<br>
appropriate to circulate the distillate of the distillation<br>
column to the absorption column to recover the acrylic acid<br>
contained in distillate in the absorption column.<br>
The position at which the column top liquid of the first<br>
distillation column circulated toward the absorption column<br>
enters the absorption column does not need to be particularly<br>
restricted but is only required to be different from the top<br>
of the absorption column. The term "different from the column<br>
top" refers to a number of theoretical plate in the range<br>
of 2 - 100 as counted on the assumption that the number of<br>
theoretical plate 1 represents the top of the distillation<br>
• column and the number of theoretical plate 100 represents<br>
the bottom thereof. The top liquid of the first distillation<br>
column contains such low boiling substances as water and acetic<br>
acid. In the absorption column, acrylic acid is absorbed by<br>
the absorbing aqueous solution 33 which falls from the top<br>
of the column. In this case, the absorption ratio of acrylic<br>
acid is enhanced by introducing acetic acid via any of the<br>
positions excluding the top of the absorption column. Though<br>
the mechanism responsible for this enhancement of the<br>
absorption ratio remains yet to be clarified, it may be<br>
logically explained by a supposition that when the acetic<br>
acid is introduced via any of the positions of the absorption<br>
column 30, a layer of acetic acid gas is formed in the<br>
neighborhood of the position for supply of the acetic acid<br>
and the gas distribution in the absorption column is so changed<br>
as to form a low boiling substance gas layer above the acetic<br>
acid layer and a high boiling substance as layer under the<br>
acetic acid layer and, as a result, acrylic acid migrates<br>
toward the column bottom. This invention, by circulating the<br>
column top liquid of the first distillation column to the<br>
absorption column, is enabled to attain recovery of acrylic<br>
acid and as well enhance the absorption ratio of acrylic acid<br>
by dint of the acetic acid contained in the solution. The<br>
position forming the destination of the circulation of the<br>
liquid to the absorption column is properly selected so that<br>
the acetic acid-containing solution is introduced below the<br>
intermediate stage of the absorption column, specifically<br>
in the range of number of theoretical plates 2 - 100, preferably<br>
25 - 100, and particularly 50 - 100. At the column top, the<br>
formation of the acetic acid gas layer no longer produces<br>
an effect of enhancing the absorption efficiency of acrylic<br>
acid but rather results in lowering the concentration of<br>
acrylic acid on the column bottom side owing to a decrease<br>
of the absorption ratio of acrylic acid and renders the<br>
acquisition of an acrylic acid-containing solution of high<br>
concentration impossible. Particularly, the amount of<br>
acetic acid to be introduced is set at a mass flow rate 0.005<br>
-0.20 times, preferably 0. 008 - 0.15 times, and particularly<br>
0.01 - 0.10 times the mass flow rate of acrylic acid contained<br>
in the acrylic acid-containing gas. If the mass flow rate<br>
falls short of 0.005 times, the shortage will result in dulling<br>
the effect of enhancing the absorption efficiency of acrylic<br>
acid. Conversely, the mass flow rate exceeds 0.20 times, the<br>
excess will result in rendering the acquisition of an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution of high concentration difficult.<br>
This invention, by circulating the distillate to the<br>
absorption column, is enabled to repress the acrylic acid<br>
loss to the same level as is attained when an azeotropic solvent<br>
is used.<br>
(4) Step of crystallization of crude acrylic acid<br>
This invention supplies the crude acrylic acid 41 to<br>
the crystallizing device 50 to obtain acrylic acid 60 as a<br>
finished product. The method of crystallization to be used<br>
does not need to be particularly restricted but is required<br>
to effect the crystallization either continuously or<br>
batchwise. It is allowed to execute the crystallization in<br>
one stage or in two or more stages. As a concrete example<br>
of the continuous crystallizing device, backmixing column<br>
crystallizer (BMC) (made by Nippon Steel Chemical Co., Ltd.)<br>
as a column type crystallizer having a crystallizing part,<br>
a solid-liquid separating part, and a crystal purifying part<br>
integrated may be cited. A cooling disk crystallizer (CDC)<br>
(made by Gouda Company of Netherlands), for example, is used<br>
as the crystallizing part, a belt filter or a centrifugal<br>
separator, for example, is used as the solid-liquid separating<br>
part, and Kureha Crystal Purifier (KCP) (made by Kureha<br>
TechnoEngineering Co. Ltd.), for example, is used as the<br>
crystal purifying part respectively in the continuous<br>
crystallizing device.<br>
As concrete examples of the batchwise crystallizing<br>
device, a layer crystallizing device (dynamic crystallizing<br>
device) made by Sulzer Chemtech Company of Switzerland and<br>
a static crystallizing device made by BEFS PROKEM Company<br>
of France may be cited.<br>
The method of multistage fractional crystallization<br>
forms one of the advantageous modes of embodying this invention.<br>
This method properly performs the crystallization by a step<br>
of dynamic crystallization using a dynamic crystallizing<br>
device provided with a tubular crystallizing device provided<br>
with a temperature controlling mechanism for performing<br>
crystallization, sweating, and melting, a tank for recovering<br>
the mother liquid occurring after the sweating, and a<br>
circulating pump for supplying acrylic acid to the<br>
crystallizing device and adapted to transfer acrylic acid<br>
by means of a circulating pump from a storage vessel disposed<br>
in the lower part of the crystallizing device to the upper<br>
part of the tube of the crystallizing device or by the<br>
combination of a step of dynamic crystallization and a step<br>
of static crystallization using a tubular crystallizing<br>
device provided with a temperature controlling mechanism for<br>
performing crystallization, sweating, and melting and<br>
furnished in the lower part thereof with an drawing-out valve<br>
and using a tank for recovering the mother liquid occurring<br>
after the sweating with a step of static crystallization.<br>
The crude acrylic acid in the liquid phase is introducef d<br>
into the crystallizing device. Then, the solid phase<br>
differing in composition from the introduced liquid phase<br>
is solidified in the cooling surface. After 40 - 90 wt. %,<br>
preferably 50 - 80 wt. % of the used acrylic acid is solidified,<br>
the remainder of the liquid phase is immediately separated<br>
and removed. This separation and removal is effected by<br>
scooping out the residual phase with a pump (step of dynamic<br>
crystallization) or causing it to flow out (step of static<br>
crystallization) . It may be further followed by a step of<br>
washing the crystal layer or a step of sweating, namely partial<br>
melting-off of an impure crystal region.<br>
When the dynamic crystallization and the static<br>
crystallization are carried out by a multistage process, they<br>
can be advantageously executed by the principle of counter<br>
current, the substances crystallized in the component<br>
processes are separated from the respective residual mother<br>
liquids after crystallization, these crystallized substances<br>
are supplied to respective pertinent steps involving still<br>
higher levels of purity, and the residues of crystallization<br>
are supplied to respective pertinent steps involving still<br>
lower levels of purity.<br>
Generally, all the steps in which acids of higher levels<br>
of purity than the supplied crude acid solutions are known<br>
as purifying steps and all the other steps are known as<br>
stripping steps. The stripping steps are executed for the<br>
purpose of recovering acrylic acid in the mother liquid from<br>
the relevant purifying steps. The dynamic crystallization<br>
attains crystallization with difficulty which increases in<br>
accordance as the purity of acrylic acid decreases. In<br>
contrast, the static crystallization attains crystallization<br>
easily even when the purity of acrylic acid decreases as<br>
compared with the dynamic crystallization. For the purpose<br>
of exalting the ratio of recovery of acrylic acid, therefore,<br>
• the final mother liquid of the dynamic crystallization is<br>
further crystallized by the static crystallization.<br>
The number of steps of crystallization to be required<br>
depends on the degree of purity to be demanded. For the purpose<br>
of producing acrylic acid of high purity, it is proper to<br>
perform 1-5, preferably 2-3 purifying steps (dynamic<br>
crystallizing steps) ,1-5, preferably 1-4 stripping steps<br>
(dynamic crystallizing steps), and 1-5, preferably 1-3<br>
stripping steps (static crystallizing steps) .<br>
(5) Decomposition of acrylic acid dimer<br>
In this invention, it is proper to use as a device for<br>
decomposing acrylic acid dimer the combination of the<br>
distillation column 70 provided on the bottom side thereof<br>
with the thin layer evaporator 73 and the dimer decomposing<br>
tank 75 for heating the bottom liquid of the vaporizing device<br>
73 illustrated in The Figure. It is advisable to have the<br>
thin layer evaporator 73 disposed on the column bottom side<br>
because the bottom liquid of the second distillation column<br>
70 have high viscosity. The second distillation column 70<br>
is preferred to effect the distillation in a number of<br>
theoretical plate in the range of 1 - 5, under a reduced pressure<br>
in the range of 10 - 150 hPa (absolute pressure), at a column<br>
bottom temperature of not higher than 120°C. Incidentally,<br>
the high boiling substances contained in the bottom liquid<br>
of the first distillation column 40 include acrylic acid dimer,<br>
maleic acid, and polymerization inhibitor, for example.<br>
Then, the bottom liquid of the thin layer evaporator<br>
73 mentioned above is supplied to the dimer decomposing tank<br>
75. This dimer decomposing tank 75 decomposes acrylic acid<br>
dimer at a temperature in the range of 120 - 220°C. The hold<br>
up time (capacity of dimer decomposing tank/amount of waste<br>
oil) varies with the temperature of thermal decomposition.<br>
• It generally falls in the range of 0.1 - 60 hours. Preferably,<br>
it is in the range of 5 - 50 hours and particularly in the<br>
range of 20 - 30 hours. The dimer decomposing tank, during<br>
decomposing the acrylic acid dimer, allows addition thereto<br>
such catalysts for decomposition as an alkali metal salt,<br>
an alkaline earth metal salt, and an N-oxyl compound described<br>
in JP-A-2003-89672. Particularly, the use of the N-oxyl<br>
compound mentioned above as a polymerization inhibitor at<br>
the step of absorption or the step of distillation is<br>
advantageous in respect that it can additionally play as a<br>
catalyst for decomposition of the acrylic acid dimer.<br>
After the acrylic acid dimer has been decomposed into<br>
acrylic acid, this acrylic acid can be effectively recovered<br>
by supplying the product of decomposition to the thin layer<br>
evaporator 73 and the distillate from the top of the second<br>
distillation column to the first distillation column 40. This<br>
invention contemplates preparing an acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution of high concentration in the acrylic acid absorption<br>
column 30 and preventing the acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
of high concentration from polymerization by the addition<br>
of a polymerization inhibitor. At the step of absorption and<br>
the step of purification, the polymerization inhibitor is<br>
used in amounts proportional to the concentrations of acrylic<br>
acid. Since the polymerization inhibitor is expelled to the<br>
out side of system as the waste liquid of the dimer decomposing<br>
tank 75, the acrylic acid 60 produced as a finished product<br>
enjoys high purity.<br>
Incidentally, in this invention, acrylic acid may be<br>
distilled out of the top of the second distillation column<br>
70, circulated to the absorption column 30 and the first<br>
distillation column 40, and consequently recovered as crude<br>
acrylic acid.<br>
The residual mother liquid recovered from the<br>
crystallizing device 50 may be supplied in its whole amount<br>
to any of the absorption column 30, the first distillation<br>
column 40, the second distillation column 70, the thin layer<br>
evaporator 73, and the dimer decomposing tank 75. It may be<br>
partly expelled to the out side of system as waste oil. When<br>
the whole amount of the residual mother liquid is supplied<br>
to the step of decomposing the acrylic acid dimer, part of<br>
the acrylic acid which is recovered from the step of decomposing<br>
the acrylic acid dimer may be discharged out of the system<br>
for the purpose of avoiding concentration of an impurity.<br>
Otherwise, the residual mother liquid may be subjected to<br>
a chemical pretreatment for transforming aldehydes and maleic<br>
acid into high boiling substances before it is subjected to<br>
the step of decomposing the acrylic acid dimer. As a result,<br>
the acrylic acid recovered by the step of decomposing the<br>
acrylic acid dimer is enabled to lower the impurity<br>
concentration thereof. This operation may be carried out by<br>
following the procedure taught in JP-A-2001-199931.<br>
Examples<br>
Now, this invention will be described more specifically<br>
below with reference to working examples cited herein below.<br>
(Example of production of catalyst)<br>
A molybdenum-bismuth type catalyst was prepared by<br>
following the procedure of Example 1 cited in JP-A-2000-325795.<br>
It is labeled as "catalyst (I) ." A molybdenum-vanadium type<br>
catalyst was prepared by following the procedure of Example<br>
1 cited in JP-A-1996-206504. It was labeled as "catalyst<br>
(II)."<br>
Acrylic acid was produced by using an apparatus<br>
illustrated in The Figure.<br>
A reactor furnished on the outer periphery thereof with<br>
a jacket for circulating a heat medium, containing therein<br>
reaction tubes 25 mm in inside diameter and 7, 000 mm in length,<br>
and provided at a position of 3,500 mm from the lower part<br>
of the jacket with a perforated tube sheet dividing the heat<br>
medium jacket into two halves, an upper one and a lower one,<br>
was used. The lower part (the first reaction zone) and the<br>
upper part (the second reaction zone) of the reactor had their<br>
temperatures controlled by circulation of their respective<br>
heat media. The reactor was packed with (1) ceramic balls<br>
having an average diameter of 5 mm, (2) a mixture of catalyst<br>
(I) and ceramic balls of an average diameter of 5 mm at a<br>
volume ratio of 70 : 30, (3) catalyst (I), (4) raschig rings<br>
made of stainless steel and measuring 5 mm in outside diameter,<br>
4.5 mm in inside diameter, and 6 mm in length, (5) a mixture<br>
of catalyst (II) and ceramic balls of an average diameter<br>
of 5 mm at a volume ratio of 75 : 25, and (6) catalyst (II)<br>
placed sequentially from the lower part toward the upper part<br>
of the reactor in respective bed lengths of 250 mm, 700 mm,<br>
2,300 mm, 500 mm, 600 mm, and 1,900 mm.<br>
To the first reaction zone of the reactor, propylene,<br>
air (the concentration of water component 2 wt. %), and part<br>
of the discharged gas (recycle gas) from the absorption column<br>
were circulated to supply 8.0 vol% of propylene, 14.4 vol%<br>
of 02, and 2.0 vol% of H20 (the remainder comprising N2, propane,<br>
COx, acrylic acid, and acetic acid) with the respective flow<br>
rates and the cooling temperature of the recycle gas so adjusted<br>
as to set the space velocity in the first reaction zone at<br>
1,250 hr"1 (STP) .<br>
The heat medium temperatures of the first reaction zone<br>
and the second reaction zone were so adjusted as to set the<br>
degree of conversion of propylene at 97 ± 0.5 mol% and the<br>
yield of acrolein at 1 ± 0.5 mol% under the outlet pressure,<br>
0.15 MPa (absolute pressure), of the second reaction zone<br>
to obtain an acrylic acid-containing gas having an acrylic<br>
acid concentration of 16.62 wt. % at a rate of 26.74 kg/hour.<br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas thus obtained was cooled<br>
to 170°C with a precooler and then led to an acrylic acid<br>
absorption column so as to be absorbed therein in the form<br>
of an acrylic acid-containing solution.<br>
The absorption column was a packed column filled with<br>
structured packings and furnished with a number of theoretical<br>
plate 21 found by computation. It was provided in the column<br>
bottom part with a supply port for an acrylic acid-containing<br>
gas and withdrawing port for the absorbed liquid, in the column<br>
top part with an inlet port for the absorbing aqueous solution<br>
and a discharge port for the gas, and in the column side part<br>
(the 19th theoretical plate) with a supply tube for the column<br>
top liquid from the distilling tower and further provided<br>
with a cooling device for cooling part of the gas emanating<br>
from the column top.<br>
As the absorbing water, water containing hydroquinone<br>
in an amount corresponding to 200 wt. ppm relative to the<br>
amount of the acrylic acid in the acrylic acid-containing<br>
gas introduced into the absorption column was supplied at<br>
a rate of 1.16 kg/hour.<br>
The acrylic acid absorption column was operated, with<br>
the column top temperature set at 65.1°C, the column top<br>
pressure at 0.11 MPa (absolute pressure), the cooling<br>
temperature of the recycle gas at 40.6°C, and the ratio of<br>
recycling at 29.0%.<br>
Via the column side part, the column top liquid of the<br>
distillation column having a composition of 58.3 wt. % of<br>
acrylic acid, 21.7 wt. % of H20, and 20.0 wt. % of acetic acid<br>
was supplied at a rate of 1.00 kg/hour.<br>
Further, this acrylic acid-containing solution was<br>
supplied to the upper part of the packed column measuring<br>
100 mm in inside diameter and 5 m in packed height. The packed<br>
column was operated under a column top pressure of 265 hPa<br>
(absolute pressure) at a column bottom temperature of 70°C<br>
kept by heating so as to effect distillation and separation<br>
of acrolein and the like. As a result, an acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution containing 90.0 wt. % of acrylic<br>
acid, 4.0 wt. % of water, 3.9 wt. % of acetic acid, and 2.1<br>
wt. % of other components (such as acids like maleic acid<br>
and propionic acid and aldehydes like furfural, formaldehyde,<br>
benzaldehyde, and glyoxal) was obtained via the column bottom<br>
part at a rate of 5. 50 kg/hour. Incidentally, the gas obtained<br>
via the column top part was supplied to the lower parat of<br>
the acrylic acid absorption column.<br>
Then, the acrylic acid-containing solution was distilled<br>
in the distillation column. This distillation column was<br>
equipped with dual flow trays having 60 plats and a distance<br>
of 147 mm between the plates, provided in the column top part<br>
with a distilling tube, in the central part with a raw material<br>
supply tube, and in the column bottom part with a bottom liquid<br>
withdrawing tube, below the raw material supply tube with<br>
a gaseous acrylic acid withdrawing tube for which acrylic<br>
acid is withdrawn in the gas state, and further provided at<br>
the 57th plate from the column top with a condenser for cooling<br>
the acrylic acid gas.<br>
The operation of distillation was carried out, with the<br>
column top pressure decompressed by a vacuum device (not shown)<br>
 so as to set the working pressure thereof at 100 hPa (absolute<br>
pressure), the pressure difference between the column side<br>
part and the column top part controlled at 99 hPa so as to<br>
set the flow rate ratio of the gaseous acrylic acid and the<br>
distillate from the column top part at 4 : 1, and the reflux<br>
ration was 3.4. 4H-TEMP0 (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl<br>
piperidinoxyl) added as a stabilizer from the reflux line<br>
in an amount corresponding to 200 ppm relative to the acrylic<br>
acid supplied.<br>
Via the gaseous acrylic acid withdrawing tube, crude<br>
acrylic acid containing 99.4 wt. % of acrylic acid, 0.3 wt. %<br>
of acetic acid, 0.002 wt. % of acrylic acid dimer and 0.3<br>
wt. % of other components was obtained at a rate of 4 .33 kg/hour.<br>
The acrylic acid-containing solution obtained from the<br>
column top part and having a composition of 58.3 wt. %, 21.7<br>
wt. % of H2O, and 20.0 wt. % of acetic acid was circulated<br>
to the column side part of an acrylic acid absorption column.<br>
The bottom liquid obtained from the column bottom part<br>
and containing 48.7 wt. % of acrylic acid and 30.2 wt. % of<br>
acrylic acid dimer was supplied to the intermediate part of<br>
the distillation column of the acrylic acid dimer decomposing<br>
device.<br>
At this time, an aqueous 20 wt. % sodium oxide solution<br>
which was a catalyst for the decomposition of acrylic acid<br>
dimer was added in an amount of 0.04 wt. % (as reduced to<br>
NaOH) to the acrylic acid-containing solution tobe supplied.<br>
The device for the decomposition of acrylic acid dimer<br>
was composed of a distillation column furnished with 15 dual<br>
flow trays, a thin layer evaporator, and a dimer decomposing<br>
tank and was capable of effecting thermal decomposition under<br>
the conditions of 140°C of internal temperature of the dimer<br>
decomposing tank and 30 hours of hold up time. It was operated<br>
under the conditions of 33 hPa of column top pressure and<br>
0.9 of reflux ratio while the thin layer evaporator was<br>
controlled so as to set the column bottom temperature at 85°C.<br>
An acrylic acid having an acrylic acid content of 99.4 wt. %<br>
was recovered via the column top part and circulated to the<br>
column bottom part of the distillation column. At this time,<br>
the yield of purification of crude acrylic acid was 97. 0 wt. %.<br>
Then, the crude acrylic acid was supplied to a<br>
crystallizing unit and purified therein by performing a step<br>
of dynamic crystallization twice. Further, the residue of<br>
crystallization at the purifying step was treated by<br>
performing a step of dynamic crystallization three times and<br>
a step of static crystallization twice.<br>
The dynamic crystallization was performed by following<br>
the procedure adopted for the operation of a crystallizing<br>
device disclosed in JP-B-1978-41637. To be specific, this<br>
device was a metal tube provided in the lower part with a<br>
storage vessel and measuring 6 m in length and 70 mm in inside<br>
diameter and was adapted to transfer the liquid in the storage<br>
vessel with a circulating pump to the upper part of the tube<br>
and allow the liquid to fall down the inner wall surface of<br>
the tube in the form of a film (falling film) . The surface<br>
of this tube was formed of a double-wall jacket. The jacket<br>
functioned as a thermostat and controlled so as to be set<br>
at a stated temperature. One dynamic crystallization was<br>
performed by the following procedure.<br>
1. Crystallization: Acrylic acid was supplied to the<br>
storage vessel, caused by the circulating pump to fall down<br>
the wall surface of the tube in the form of a film, and cooled<br>
by lowering the temperature of the jackets below the<br>
solidification point so as to crystallize about 60 - 80 wt. %<br>
 thereof on the wall surface of the tube.<br>
2. Sweating: The circulation pump was stopped, the<br>
jacket temperature was increased to the vicinity of the<br>
freezing point, and the acrylic acid is caused to sweat about<br>
2 - 5 wt % thereof. After sweating, the residual melt is pumped<br>
out.<br>
3. Melting: The crystals were melted by elevating the<br>
temperature of the jacket beyond the solidification point<br>
and the melt was scooped out with the pump.<br>
In the foregoing operation, the temperatures and the<br>
solidification points were made to depend on the relevant<br>
steps performed.<br>
The device for the static crystallization was a tube<br>
provided in the lower part with an drawing-out valve and<br>
measuring 90 mm in inside diameter and 1 m in length. The<br>
surface of this tube was formed of a double-wall jacket, which<br>
was adapted to serve as a thermostat and was controlled so<br>
as to be set at a certain fixed temperature. One static<br>
crystallization was performed by the following procedure.<br>
1. Crystallization: Acrylic acid was supplied into<br>
the tube and crystallized therein by lowering the temperature<br>
of the jacket to below the solidification point so as to have<br>
about 60 - 80 wt. % thereof crystallized.<br>
2. Sweating: The residual mother liquid occurring after<br>
the crystallization was withdrawn from the lower part of the<br>
tube and deprived of about 15 - 25 wt. % thereof by sweating,<br>
with the temperature of the j acket elevated to the neighborhood<br>
of the solidification point. After the sweating, the liquid<br>
formed by the sweating was withdrawn.<br>
3. Melting: The crystals were melted by elevating the<br>
temperature of the jacket beyond the solidification point<br>
and the resultant melt was withdrawn.<br>
As a result, acrylic acid having such a high purity as<br>
99.94 wt. % was obtained at a rate of 4.25 kg/hour.<br>
The acrylic acid contained 467 wt. ppm of acetic acid,<br>
88 wt. ppm of propionic acid, 0.5 wt. ppm of furfural, and<br>
0.6 wt. ppm of benzaldehyde.<br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
The acrylic acid-containing solution obtained in Example<br>
1 and containing 90.0 wt. % of acrylic acid, 4.0 wt. % of<br>
water. 3.9 wt. % of acetic acid, and 2 .1wt. % of other components<br>
(such as acids likemaleicacidandpropionicacidandaldehydes<br>
like furfural, formaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and glyoxal) was<br>
subjected to azeotropic distillation with toluene used as<br>
an azeotropic solvent.<br>
The azeotropic distillation was carried out by using<br>
the same device as in Example 1, with the column top pressure<br>
set at 75 hPa and the reflux ratio at 9.5.<br>
Crude acrylic acid containing 99. 4 wt. % of acrylic acid,<br>
0. 3 0 wt. % of acetic acid, 0.002 wt. % of acrylic acid dimer,<br>
and 0.3 wt. % of other component was obtained through the<br>
gaseous acrylic acid extracting tube at a rate of 4 . 30 kg/hour.<br>
From the column top part, a water phase containing 40.8<br>
wt. % of acrylic acid, 24.9 wt. % of acetic acid, 27.0 wt. %<br>
of water, and 7.3 wt. % of toluene was obtained at a rate<br>
of 0.82 kg/hour. Since this water phase contained toluene<br>
in a large amount, it could not be circulated to the absorption<br>
column. If the solution was circulated to the absorption<br>
column, it would induce supply of toluene to the catalyst<br>
system and occur inevitably poison for the catalyst.<br>
