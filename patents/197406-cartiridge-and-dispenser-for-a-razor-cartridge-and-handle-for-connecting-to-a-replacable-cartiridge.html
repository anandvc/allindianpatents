Referring to Pigs. 1-4, there is shown cartridge dispenser 10 {Fig. 1) for storing razor blade cartridges 12 (Fig. 2), which each have blade unit 14 that is pivotally connected to cartridge connecting structure 16.  Dispenser 10 includes housing structure 18 that defines sections 20 for receiving cartridges 12 and latches 22 associated with sections 20 to retain each cartridge 12 in a respective<br>
section 20. Sections 20 are defined by cartridge dividers 24 and side walls 26 of housing structure 18.  Each cartridge divider 24 includes a perpendicular blade unit divider portion 36, at the bottom, and angled divider-portion 42 above it.<br>
Dispenser 10 is made of two molded parts 23,*30, that are joined together by ultrasonic welding at seam 32 (Fig. 4).  Bottom part 28 include© base 34. perpendicular blade unit divider portions 36, and contoured cartridge supports 3S spaced slightly in from side walls 26 (Figs. 3, 4) * ^ Cartridge supports 38 are contoured to support and are aligned with clips 40 on cartridges 12 (Fig. 2) at the ends of blade unit 14 in order to avoid contact of the blades that are retained under clips 40 with the dispenser. Referring to Pig. 5, it ia seen that base 34 has drainage openings 53 that are each associated with a section 20 for receiving a respective cartridge 12.<br>
Referring to Figs, 3-4, upper part 30 includes angled dividers 42, which each include a lower portion 44 that extends between side walls 26 and two upper portions 46 that are not connected to side walls 26 in order to permit flexure of upper portions 46.  Alternatively, upper portions 4tC   con be connected to side wallet 26,- having a  space between upper portions 46 and side walls 26 is optional.  Upper portions 46 have tops 47.  Between the two upper portions 46 of each angled divider portion 42 is a latch 22 that extends upward from lower portion 44.  Front wall 48 similarly has lower portion 50 between side walls 26^ two free standing upper portions 52, and latch 22 therebetween. Upper portions 46, 52 have spaces nearby the ends of latches 22 to receive the connecting structures of the cartridge and handle during connection and disconnection.<br>
Referring to ?ig. S,   axio 56b extending through the lower portion 44 of angled divider portion 42 and the portion of latch 22 extending therefrom make a 35** angle a with connection seam 32 and base 34 thereunder.  The angle Q should be no less than 30°; a value of about 35° provides a good balance between providing a sufficient number 
Referring to Fig. 2,   handle 63 includes elongated, straight hand gripping portion 65 and handle connecting structure 64 at the upper end of hand gripping portion 65. Generally flat extension 66 of structure 64 is designed to fit within mating r<ece8s in cart:ridg connacting structure both of which have a trapezoidal shape. handle connecting is offset from hand gripping portion and connected to it by trazxsition includes spring></ece8s>
biaaed plimger 61, for biasing pivotal blade unit 14 at a Cam surface on cross bar 41, and button 68, used to extend a presser from a forward end of extension 66 (not shown in Fig* 2) to eject cartridge 12 from handle 63. The details of the structure and operation of cartridge 12 and handle connecting structure 64, the interaction of plunger* 61 and the cam surface on cross bar 4X, and the connection and disGcnnection of the cartridge 12 and handle 63 are described in Serial Number 08/630,437, filed April 10, 1996, and a patent application entitled "Shaving Razor and Method" filed concurrently herewith, which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.<br>
Referring primarily to Figs. 7 and 8, handle connecting structure 64 of handle 63 includes handle camming structure 69 having cam surface 70 for acting against cam follower structure 54 (surface 56 and junctions 58, 60) of 14tch 22 (Fig. 6) as extension 66 is inserted into recess 67 {Fig. 9) of a cartridge 12 contained within dispenser 10 (Pig. 11) .  As shown in Fig. 8, surface 70 makes an acute angle (about 22°) with connection axis 72. Handle-connecting structure 64 includes platform portion 74 with generally semicircular portions 76 on both sides of cam surface 70, and cartridge connecting structure 16 has cutaway portion 80 (Pigs. 2, 9&gt; with a matching shape for receiving platform 74 of handle connecting structure 64. Cutaway portion 80 functions as a keyway for mating platform portion 74 on handle 63 to guarantee proper alignment of cam- Surface 70 and the cam follower structure of latch 22 as well as proper orientation of handle 63 during connection to cartridge 12,<br>
As shown in Fig. 8A, extension 66 has an asymmetrical shape in a planar section perpendicular to connection axis 72 (Figs. 7-8) through its outwardly<br>
directed surfaces; recesa 67 (Pig. 9)   in cartridge connecting structure 16 of cartridge 12 has the same shape in a planar section perpendicular to connection axis 72 through its mating inwardly directed surfaces.  The asymmetrical shapes, liKe the mating platform and cutaway portions just mentioned, also Enhance proper alignment of cam surface 70 and cam follower structure 54 of latch 22 as well as proper orientation of handle 63 and cartridge 12 during connection. Button 68 has recessed region 73 in line with cam surface 70 to provide a space to receive latch 22 during and after connection of handle connecting structure 64 with the connecting structure 16 of cartridge 12, when handle 63 is in a tilted forward orientation (Fig. 14). Referring to Pig. 9, it is seen that cartridge connecting structure 16 has recessed region 7S for receiving cam surface 70 of handle S3 as handle 63 is moved along connection axis 72 (Pigs, 12, 13).  Cartridge connecting structure 15 also has latching portion 82, located at the juncti-on of the top of recessed region 78 and the center of cutaway portion 80.  Latching portion 82 is contacted by retaining surface 62 of latch 22 when retained in dispenser 10 (P;.gs- 6,   10) ,  Cartridge connecting structure 16 also has two detents 83 for mating with two depressions 85 (Fig. 8) on handle 63. Extending from the end of cartridge conriecting structure 16 are two arms 77 with pivots 79 (only one ax*m and one pivot are shown in Pig. 9) that make a pivotal connection with blade unit 14 (Fig. 2),  as is described in detail in the above-referenced patent application U.S. Serial Number 08/630,437.<br>
In loading a cartridge 12 into a respective section 20/ the bottom of each blade unit 14 is guided by upper surface 90 of divider 42 (or of back angled wall 95) (Figs. 4, 10) and passes through angled region 92 into blade unit<br>
T&amp;g±on  94.  (Surfaces 90 thus include the upper surfaces of bot|h lower portion 44 and upper portion 4€ of dividers 42.) The bottom of blade unit 14 is also guided along the upper ,countoured surfaces of cartridge supports 36 and rest^ on euppor-^s 3 8 with the front of the blade unit resting against jblade unit divider; portion 36. As shown in Fig. 4, ' cartridge supports have an initial generally horizontal portion, followed by a first angled portion, followed by a second anglftd portion at a smaller angle. As shown in Fig. 10, pivotal cartridge connecting structure 16 is held in a position in which retaining surface 62 of latch 22 engages latching portion 82 of cartridge connecting structure 16, As not-sd above, cartridge connecting structure 16 is pivotally mounted with respect to blade unit 14.  In Fig, 10, blade unit 14 is shown at the limit of pivoting at the most open orientation with respect to cartridge connecting structure 16, and thus latching portion 82 cannot move downward from the position shown in Pig. 10 and cannot move rearward (to the right) out of region 92 owing to interference by retaining surface 62.  In the cartridge storage position shown in Fig. 10, there is no deflection of latch 22 from its undeflected position, and there thus is zero- or minimal force of latch 22 on cartridge connecting structure 16.  if there were a slight deflection of latch 22 outward, or if tolerances permitted a slightly more open orientation of cartridge connecting structure 16 and blade unit 14 or a slight space between latching portion 82 and retaining surface 62, latching portion S2 of cartridge coniiecting structure 16 could move slightly rearward (to the right) and contact a different position of retaining surface 62; latching portion 82, however, is prevented from clearing blocking surface 56a of latch 22 in the absence of a very<br>
lAtge  deflection of latch 22 outward {i.e., upward in Fig. 10) .<br>
In use, when a shaver desires to replace a cartridge 12 on handle 63, the presently mounted cartridge 12 is ejected using button 68 and discarded {or inserted into a vacant section 20 in a dispeneer 10, ae is discussed below) . Then an used cartridge 12 in dispenser 10 is connected to handle 63 by moving extension €fi into mating recess 67 along connection axis 72»  Pig. 10 shows the position o£ cartridge connecting structure 16 in dispenser 10 during storage and prior to connection to handle 63, Fig. 11 shows the position of handle connecting structure 64 as cam surface 70 on handle 63 first contacts latch camming structure 54 of latch 22 on dispenser 10,  Fig. 12 shows the initial deflection of latch 22 as handle connecting structure 64 is inserted fvirther, and Pig. 13 shows handle connecting structure 64 connected to cartridge connecting structure 16.<br>
The user is prevented from connecting handle 63 to cartridge 12 in the wrong orientation owing to asymmetrical features of handle 63 with respect to connection axis 72. Two of hhRs*a features are the rtpymrnrthr-i ofll shi^p*? o^<br>
extension $6  and the mating key/keyway feature of eemicircular platform 74.  These two features prevent insertion of extension 66 all of the way into recess 67 with engagement of detents 83 with depressions 85 unless handle 63 is in the proper orientation <i.e not upside down with respect to cartridge connecting structure regardless of whether the is in dispenser or not. two other features button and transition portion prevent a user from even bringing handle into proximity owing angled arreuigement storage sections when proper orientation shown fig.></i.e>
ti^anfiition portion 71 are on the side of connection axis 72 closer to the front angled divider 42 (see Figs. 1/ 5, and IX), are ciear of ^the rear angled divider 42, and are not blocked by any structure on dispenser 10.  If a user ' atten^'ts to attach a cartridge 12 with handle 63 upside down, button 68 and transition portion 71 will be on the side of axis 72 closest to the rear divider 42 and will be blocked by it.  Thus, owing to the use of angled dividers on dispenser 10, button 68 and transition portion 71 ace as blocking structures making it more likely that the user place handle 63 iii the proper orientation before attempting to connect it no a cartridge 12 in dispenser 10.<br>
Assuming that handle 63 is in the proper orientation shown in Fig. 11, as handle connecting structure 64 is moved along connection axis 72,   cam surface 70 contacts cam follower structure 54 of latch 22 (Pig. 11) and, with continued insertion along axis 72, cam surface 70 biases the end of cantilevere^d latch 22 outward (Fig. 12). As latch 22 moves outward, its cantilevered arm bends primarily near the base (see Pigs. 4,. 6),  and blocking surface 56a {Fig, 6) moves substantially along the plane of its surface (perpendicular to longitudinal ajcis 5fib through lower portion 44). As handle connecting structure 64 is inserted further along axis 72, latch 22 rides up onto platform 74 to an unlatched position clearing the cartridge structure prior to, or simultaneously with, detent 83 snapping into place in depression 85 in the connected position shown in Fig. 13. Receseed region 78 provides a region in cartridge connecting structure 16 for receiving cam surface 70 in the connected position.  If the user tilts handle 63 upward at this time, or if the user so tilts handle 63 during attachment or<br>
removal, latch 22<br>
can deflect further and ride up above<br>
platform 74 into reeeased region 73 in button sa (Pig. 14) without risk of breaking latch 22.<br>
The user then retracts handle $3 and connected cartridge 12 from dispenser 10, typically along the sAme axis along which the handle travelled during connection, namely connection axis 72.  Cartridge moves from the initially connected position of Fig. 13 to the initial retraction position of Fig. 15 and the further retracted position of Pig. 16.  Because latch 22, which is a resilient cantilevered structure, is still in a deflected position during initial retraction when latch 22 rides over the outside of cartridge connecting structure 16 (Figs. 15 and 16) , latch 22 exerts a biasing force on cartridge connecting structure 16.  in the position of Fig. 16, where latch 22 contacts the curved front surface 100 of connecting st?mcture 16, the biasing force exerted by latch 22 has a component along axis 72, and this assists in ejecting the connected cartridge from the dispenser 10.<br>
As the handle and connected cartridge move further outward from the position shown in Fig. 16,  blade unit 14 passes latch 22.  If latch 22 contacts the back of blade unit 14 at this time, latch 22 will ride over cross bar 41 on th-s back of blade unit 14 (Fig. 2) , which is perpendicular to the blades and is aligned with latching portion 82.  Latch 22 thus will not get caught on other structure (e.g., perpendicular portions of the housing of blade unit 14) on the back of blade unit 14, cross bar 41 also provides strength to blade unit 14 and has a camming surface that is acted upon by spring biased plunger 61.<br>
When a user wishes to replace a cartridge 12 after it ha3 been used for shaving, the cartridge can be returned to diapenser 10 by insertion along connection axis 72 and ejection of the cartridge using button 68.  Prior to<br>
ejection, latch 2:2 rides on platform 74.  If the handle ie tilted upward (e.g., as shown in Fig. 14) prior to ejection, latch 22 will move into recessed region 73.  The cartridge will automatically be engaged by latch 22, as the handle 63 is retracted, and latch 22 will ride down platform 74 and cam surface 70 during retraction.  X*iguid on a used'blade unit 14 stored in dispenser 10 can drain through drainage holes. 53 (Pig. 5) .<br>
