				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
M. tuberculosis is exceptionally easily transmitted, as it is carried in airborne particles termed "droplet nuclei," produced when a patient with active tuberculosis coughs. These particles are from 1-5.mu. in size, and are readily suspended in air currents. Infection occurs when droplet nuclei are inhaled and reach the terminal airways of the new host's lungs. Usually, the host immune response limits the multiplication and spread of the organism, although some organisms may remain dormant, but viable, for many years post-infection. Individuals infected with M. tuberculosis but without disease, usually have a positive skin test (i.e., with purified protein derivative [PPD]), but are asymptomatic and generally not infectious. However, latently infected individuals have a 10% risk for developing active tuberculosis at some point during their life; the risk is greatest within the first two years post-infection. For HIV-positive individuals, the risk is much greater, with the risk at 10-15% per year for progression to active disease (F. S. Nolte and B. Metchock, "Mycobacterium," in Manual of Clinical Microbiology, Sixth<br>
The field of diagnostic and clinical microbiology has continued to evolve, and yet, there remains a general need for systems that provide rapid and reliable detection of disease and infection due to microorganisms such as M. tuberculosis. Nontheless, the role of the clinical mycobacteriology laboratories cannot be underestimated in view of their potential contributions in controlling the spread of tuberculosis and non-tuberculosis disease through the timely detection, isolation, identification, and determination of drug susceptibility of these organisms. There is a "new sense of urgency" regarding the reporting of acid-fast smear, cultures, and drug susceptibility results to physicians, prompted in large part to the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis (Nolte and Metchock, supra, at p. 400). Traditionally, tuberculosis surveillance has involved the use of preliminary skin tests (e.g., tuberculin tests), with positives being further evaluated for active disease by radiographic analysis (i.e., chest X-rays),<br><br>
and sputum cultures. Other samples are sometimes submitted to the laboratory for culture, including blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, bronchial washings, gastric lavage fluids, urine, body fluids (e.g., cerebrospinal [CSF], pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, etc.), tissues (e.g., lymph nodes, skin, or other biopsy materials), abscess contents, aspirated fluids,<br>
The analysis of clinical specimens is important in science and medicine. A wide variety of assays to determine qualitative and/or quantitative characteristics of a specimen are known in the art.<br>
Vscan test kit is available in the market by which Rapid flow through diagnostic test can be carried out for antibody detection. However the limitation of this kit is that only serum or whole blood is used as sample.<br>
Nucleic acid PCR based genetic test: DMA detection test where a single DMA molecule is amplified in the presence of Tagpol enzyme in thermocycle. It is a sensitive technique which requires skill, knowledge and sophisticated instruments to run PCR.<br>
PRIOR ART :<br>
US Patent no. 6291178 describes a method for the preservation of bodily fluid samples. The invention describes a method for the preservation and storage of human saliva samples for use in subsequent component testing thereof.<br>
US Patent no 6383763 describes a methods and compositions for the detection of infection and disease due to members of the genus Mycobacterium. In particular, the present invention is well-suited to the detection and identification of patients with disease or infection due to M. tuberculosis or MAC.<br>
US Patent no 6583266 features nucleic acid and proteins derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and leprae. The proteins and nucleic acid of the present invention have applications in diagnostics and therapeutics.<br><br>
For more than a Century detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis generally relieves on a combination of staining of acid fast bacilli (AFB) and culture. AFB staining is unable to identify the species of different mycobacterium while culture needs 6 weeks time for result interpretation. So, inadequacies of the sputum smear test and the rise of TB epidemic have renewed efforts to develop new and innovative approaches to TB diagnosis.<br>
Diagnos TB Ag device and kit has been developed as a rapid direct antigen diagnostic tests which demonstrate a superior performance against the widely used sputum smear test and the current gold standard culture method. As Diagnos TB Ag kit is an antigen based test, it has several advantages over antibody based test. Firstly, they don't rely on the host immune system to detect disease - often problematic when the host is immune comprised. Secondly, they can measure concentrations of pathogen in real time in the host, which can then be directly related to disease progression.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a test kit with a rapid and easy antigen-antibody based detection system.<br>
The other object of the present invention to provide a test kit with a direct bacilli observation method.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a test kit and rapid and easy test method for detection of the presence of mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli by reacting with a very specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibody directed against them. This complex is made to react with TB antigen conjugate to obtain a visual pink colour on the device membrane.<br>
Before the test is carried out the sputum sample is taken in a container and decontamination solution of the double the volume of the sample is added to it (e.g. to 2.5 ml sample 5ml of decontamination solution is added). The said decontamination solution comprises of 1-4 % w/v sodium hydroxide, 1.8-3% w/v Sodium citrate and 0.9-1.5 w/v NALC (Sodium Acetyl L Cysteine). The sample is then centrifuged in a tarson tube at the speed of 3000 rpm for about 30 minutes. This cold centrifugation results into formation of pellets. The pellets obtained are neutailized with phosphate buffer having a pH between 4-7. The solution is further neutralized with a neutralizing solution comprising 1m and hydrochloric acid and 4.5-5.5m Sodium hydroxide. 200 ul of neutrilized sample with 200 ul of PB is boiled at 100°C for 10-15 minute. Now this is the processed sample.<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows the test device comprising a test device (1) having a cellulosic membrane (2) enclosed in an airtight rectangular container (3) having a circular hole (4) opening in the center of the upper lid. A filtering device removably fitted over the said test device (1) provided with a filter in its circular depression central cavity (5) adapted to be fitted to the upper lid (6) of the test device encircling the central cavity (5) having the cellulosic membrane (2).<br>
In the procedure the membrane device is placed in the circular cavity of the upper lid (6) of the test device (1). The treated sample (3) is poured on the membrane and is allowed to be absorbed completely in the membrane. Few drops of buffer solution are added and the filter is removed.<br>
Step-1 : Processed sample as explained above is poured on the membrane device. Wait till the sample is completely soaked on the membrane device, as illustrated in Fig. (2).<br>
Step-2 : 3 drops of buffer solution having pH 4-7 is added and wail till the solution has completely soaked on the device.<br>
Step-3 : 2 drops of TB antibody solution (7) are poured on the membrane device. Allow it to soak in the membrane.<br>
Step-4 : Add 3 drops of buffer solution on the membrane device. Wait till the sample is completely soaked on the membrane device<br>
Step-5 : 2 drops of TB antigen conjugate (8) are poured on the membrane device. Allow it to soak in the membrane.<br><br>
Step-6 : Add 3 drops of buffer solution on the membrane device and read results. Pink surface on membrane device shows the sample is positive while negative leaves no trace on the device.<br>
This is a very quick and easy method to validate the positivity and negativity of the sample.<br>
The molarity of buffer can range from 20 mM to 50 mM and pH 6.5 to 9.0. The antibody concentration preferably is 1 M9/ml to 10 ug/ml of Gold colloid solution<br>
The concentration of serum could be 1 ug to 10 ug / ml of gold colloid solution. This solution is mixed for 2 hr to overnight. After this the solution is centrifuged and the supernatant is discarded. The pallet is redissolved in a buffer containing stabilizers like BSA, gelatin.<br>
All pulmonary and extrapulmonary including CSF pleural fluid, pus, lymph mode aspirates, biopsies can be used as samples to confirm the mycobaterial TB identity of the isolated TB bacilli.<br>
The subject invention is a mere statement of invention, where various alterations and modifications are possible without deviating from the scope of the invention hence the same should not be construed to restrict the scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
