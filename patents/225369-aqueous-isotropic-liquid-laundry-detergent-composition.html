AQUEOUS DETERGENT COMPOSITION CONTAINING ETHOXYLATED FATTY ACID DI-ESTER<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2005/121293<br><br>
PCT7EP2005/005753<br><br>
1<br>
AQUEOUS DETERGENT COMPOSITION CONTAINING ETHOXYLATED FATTY ACID DI-ESTER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
5<br>
The present invention relates to aqueous isotropic laundry detergent compositions comprising<br>
an ethoxylated fatty acid diester as a detergency booster and/or a defoamer.<br>
10   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Liquid laundry detergents are popular with the consumers. Despite numerous liquid detergent products on the market, however, a continuous consumer need exists for lower cost without compromising the performance of the detergent, or even providing improved performance at <br>
15  the same cost.<br>
Ethoxylated fatty acid di-esters (hereinafter "EFADs") may be co-produced with ethoxylated fatty acid mono-ester, as shown in "Group Selectivity of Ethoxylation of Hydroxy Acids" by A.J.O'lenick, Jr., www.zenitech.com/documents/castor-oul.pdf. M. Stjerndahl et. al. disclosed <br>
20   a method of preparing high purity of ethoxylated fatty acid via esterification with excess of Polyethylene glycol in "Synthesis and Chemical Hydrolysis of Surface-Active Esters", J. of Surfactants and Detergents, Vol6, No.4 (October, 2003)pages 311-318. The same method may be used for making high purity of di-ester with excess of fatty acid chloride. US Patents, 3,884,946 6,300,508 Bldisclose the products of ethoxylated fatty acid including 2.3% or less<br>
2	5   of di-ester as a by-product. There are patents, such as US 2002/0042352 Al, US 3,232,506,<br>
US 6,107,268, US 3,231,505, US 5,279,313, US 5,854,201, WO 96/29389, WO 96/23049, WO 00/31221, and GB 2,141,965A, disclosed of using ethoxylated fatty acid mono-ester for various applications.<br>
3	0  EFADs are not generally regarded as detergent surfactants, due to their relatively low HLB<br>
values. Furthermore, EFADs have low to none water-solubility. See for instance EP1092761, which discloses the use of EFADS to generate pearly luster—which means that the EFAD is not solubilised. Thus, the laundry detergent art does not provide any motivation and/or<br><br>
WO 2005/121293<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005753<br><br>
expectation of success for inclusion of EFADs into aqueous, isotropic laundry detergent compositions.<br>
The present invention is based at least in part on the discovery that the inclusion of relatively <br>
5 	 small quantities of EFADs into aqueous laundry detergent compositions boosts the detergent surfactant performance. By virtue of the surprising boosting effect of EFADs the surfactant amount in the formulation can be decreased (resulting in lower cost of manufacture), while maintaining soil removal performance of the detergent, or even improving it on some types of soil. Furthermore, EFADs provide economical de-foaming benefits without adverse effects,<br>
10  such as haziness, caused by a silicone defoamer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes an aqueous isotropic liquid laundry detergent composition 15  comprising:<br>
(a)	from about 0.1% to about 10 %, by weight of the composition of an ethoxylated fatty acid diester;<br>
(b)	from about 5% to about 85%, by weight of the composition, of a detergent surfactant comprising at least about 2%, by weight of the<br>
2	0	composition, of water-soluble surfactant;<br>
(c)	from about 15% to about 95% of water.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
2	5  Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all<br>
numbers in this description indicating amounts of material or conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word "about." All amounts are by weight of the aqueous liquid detergent omposition, unless otherwise specified.<br>
3	0  It should be noted that in specifying any range of concentration, any particular upper<br>
concentration can be associated with any particular lower concentration.<br><br>
WO 2005/121293<br><br>
PCT7EP2005/005753<br><br>
3<br>
For the avoidance of doubt the word "comprising" is intended to mean "including" but not necessarily "consisting of or "composed of." In other words, the listed steps or options need not be exhaustive.<br>
5  "Liquid" as used herein means that a continuous phase or predominant part of the<br>
composition is liquid and that a composition is flowable at 15°C and above (i.e., suspended solids maybe included). Gels are included in the definition of liquid compositions as used herein.<br>
10  "Isotropic" as used herein means a single phase when viewed macroscopically (without the aid of instruments, other than eyeglasses) at 20°C. The surfactants and the diester in an isotropic solution are aggregated into micelle structure, which is also known as Lj phase. By contrast, if the ethoxylated fatty aciddiester is not solubilized (as in the prior art) then at least part of it is present as a particulate form, and not as part of the micelle.<br>
15<br>
ETHOXYLATED FATTY ACID DI-ESTERS ("EFADS")<br>
EFADs used in this inventive detergent composition are selected from one or more EFADs<br>
o	o<br>
II	II<br>
R.-C-O-iR.-OX-C-R,<br>
which have a chemical structure as follows: <br>
20<br>
Where Ri and R3 are selected from linear or branched Ceto C20 cyclic or non-cyclic alkyl or alkylene groups, and cyclic or non-cyclic aliphatic group,<br>
R2 are selected from C2H4 or CaH6 groups;<br>
and n has a value between 1 to 20, preferably from 3 to 15.<br><br>
WO 2005/121293<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005753<br><br>
4 <br>
The amount of EFADs employed in the inventive compositions is in the range of from 0.1% to 10%, preferably from 0.5% to 7%, most preferably from 1.0% to 5%.<br>
SURFACTANT<br>
5	The compositions of the invention contain surface active agents selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, cationic, ampholytic and zwitterionic surfactants or mixtures thereof. The preferred surfactant detergents for use in the present invention are mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants although it is to be understood that any surfactant maybe used alone or in combination with any other surfactant or surfactants. <br>
10<br>
By virtue of employing the EFAD booster according to the present invention, the total surfactant level may be reduced while maintaining or, in case of some types of soils, even improving performance.<br>
15 Thus, the total level of surfactant in the present compositions is from 5% to 85%, preferably from 10% to 50%, and most preferably in order to maintain performance at lower cost, from 12% to 25%.<br>
According to the present invention, the surfactant comprises at least 2%, by weight of the<br>
2	0    composition, of a water-soluble surfactant, which also serves as the solubiliser for EFADs.<br>
The preferred water-soluble surfactant is nonoionic surfactant, because it is liquid at room emperature. The nonionic surfactant is especially preferred for low-foaming compositions of the invention. The nonionic surfactant is present preferably in an amount of at least 4% and most preferably from 6 to 80% by weight of the composition. <br>
25<br>
The minimum ratio of the water-soluble surfactant to EFAD, by weight percentage, is generally in the range from 1:4 to 100:1, preferably in the range from 1:2 to 50:1, and most preferably in the range from 1:1 to 10:1.<br>
3	0  According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, the nonionic surfactant comprises at<br>
least 0.1%, preferably from 0.5 to 10% by weight of the composition, of an ethoxylated fatty acid monoester, since the EFAD may be co-produced with the ethoxylated fatty acid<br><br>
WO 2005/121293<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005753<br><br>
5<br>
monoester by manipulation of the processing condition. Furthermore, EFAD may be solubilized in ethoxylated fatty acid monoester as a liquid ingredient for ease of handling.<br>
Nonionic Surfactant<br>
 5<br>
Nonionic surfactants which can be used with the invention, alone or in combination with other surfactants are described below. As is well known, the nonionic surfactants are characterized by the presence of a hydrophobic group and an organic hydrophilic group and are typically produced by the condensation of an organic aliphatic or alkyl aromatic hydrophobic <br>
10  	ompound with ethylene oxide (hydrophiUc in nature). Typical suitable nonionic surfactants are those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,316,812 and 3,630,929, incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Usually, the nonionic surfactants are polyalkoxylated lipophiles wherein the desired <br>
15	ydrophile-lipophile balance is obtained from addition of a hydrophilic poly-alkoxy group to a lipophilic moiety. A preferred class of nonionic detergent is the alkoxylated alkanols wherein the alkanol is of 9 to 20 carbon atoms and wherein the number of moles of alkylene oxide (of 2 or 3 carbon atoms) is from 3 to <br>
20. Of such materials it is preferred to employ those wherein the alkanol is a fatty alcohol of 9 to 11 or 12 to 15 carbon atoms and which contain from 5 to 9<br>
20     r 5 to 12 alkoxy groups per mole. Also preferred is paraffin - based alcohol (e.g. nonionics    from Huntsman or Sassol).<br>
Exemplary of such compounds are those wherein the alkanol is of 10 to 15 carbon atoms and which contain about 5 to 12 ethylene oxide groups per mole, e.g. Neodol® 25-9 and Neodol®<br>
25  23-6.5, which products are made by Shell Chemical Company, Inc. The former is a<br>
condensation product of a mixture of higher fatty alcohols averaging about 12 to 15 carbon atoms, with about 9 moles of ethylene oxide and the latter is a corresponding mixture wherein the carbon atoms content of the higher fatty alcohol is 12 to 13 and the number of ethylene oxide groups present averages about 6.5. The higher alcohols are primary alkanols.<br>
30<br>
Another subclass of alkoxylated surfactants which can be used contain a precise alkyl chain length rather than an alkyl chain distribution of the alkoxylated surfactants described above.<br><br>
WO 2005/121293<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005753<br><br>
6<br>
Typically, these are referred to as narrow range alkoxylates. Examples of these include the Neodol-1 ® series of surfactants manufactured by Shell Chemical Company.<br>
Other useful nonionics are represented by the commercially well known class of nonionics<br>
5	sold under the trademark Plurafac® by BASF. The Plurafacs® are the reaction products of a higher linear alcohol and a mixture of ethylene and propylene oxides, containing a mixed chain of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, terminated by a hydroxyl group. Examples include C13-C15 fatty alcohol condensed with 6 moles ethylene oxide and 3 moles propylene oxide, C13-C15 fatty alcohol condensed with 7 moles propylene oxide and 4 moles ethylene<br>
10    oxide, C13-C15 fatty alcohol condensed with 5 moles propylene oxide and <br>
       moles ethylene oxide or mixtures of any of the above.<br>
   Another group of liquid nonionics are commercially available from Shell ChemicalCompany,              Inc. under the Dobanol® or Neodol® trademark: Dobanol® 91-is an ethoxylated C9-C11 fatty      	alcohol with an average of 5 moles ethylene oxide and Dobanol® 25-7 is an ethoxylated   C12-C15 fatty alcohol with an average of 7 moles ethylene oxide per mole of fatty alcohol.<br>
In the compositions of mis invention, preferred nonionic surfactants include the C12-C15 primary fatty alcohols with relatively narrow contents of ethylene oxide in the range of from <br>
20  	about 6 to 9 moles, and the C9 to Cn fatty alcohols ethoxylated with about 5-6 moles e	thylene oxide.<br>
Another preferred class of nonionic detergent is the alkoxylated fatty acid monoester wherein the fatty acid is of 8 to 20 carbon atoms and wherein the number of moles of  <br>
25	alkylene oxide 	(of 2 or 3 carbon atoms) is from 3 to 20.<br>
Another suitable monoester is an alkoxylated alkyl fatty acid alkyl monoester, wherein the fatty acid is of 8 to 20 carbon atoms, alkyl monoester is of 2 to 3 carbon atoms and wherein the number of moles of alkylene oxide (of 2 or 3 carbon atoms) is from 3 to 20.<br><br>
WO 2005/121293<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005753<br><br><br>
Another class of nonionic surfactants which can be used in accordance with this invention are glycoside surfactants. Glycoside surfactants suitable for use in accordance with the present invention include those of the formula:<br>
5	RO-R2Oy- (Z)x<br>
wherein R is a monovalent organic radical containing from about 6 to about 30 (preferably from about 8 to about 18) carbon atoms; R2 is a divalent hydrocarbon radical containing from about 2 to 4 carbons atoms; O is an oxygen atom; y is a number which can have an average value of from 0 to about 12 but which is most preferably zero; Z is a moiety <br>
10  	derived from a reducing saccharide cdntaining 5 or 6 carbon atoms; and x is a number having an average value of from 1 to about 10 (preferably from about 1 1/2 to about 10).<br>
     A particularly preferred group of glycoside surfactants for use in the practice of this invention includes those of the formula above in which R is a monovalent organic radical (linear or <br>
15     branched) containing from about 6 to about 18 (especially from about 8 to about 18) carbon    atoms; y is zero; z is glucose or a moiety derived therefrom; x is a number having an average value of from 1 to about 4 (preferably from about 1 1/2 to 4).<br>
Nonionic surfactants which may be used include polyhydroxy amides as discussed in U.S.<br>
20   Patent No. 5,312,954 to Letton et al. and aldobionamides such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,389,279 to Au et al., both of which are hereby incorporated by reference into the subject application.<br>
Generally, nonionics would comprise 0-75% by wt, preferably 3 to 50%, more preferably 5 to<br>
2	5  25% by wt. of the composition. Mixtures of two or more of the nonionic surfactants can be<br>
used.<br>
Anionic Surfactant Detergents<br>
Anionic surface active agents which may be used in the present invention are those surface<br>
3	0  active compounds which contain a long chain hydrocarbon hydrophobic group in their<br>
molecular structure and a hydrophile group, i.e. water solubilizing group such as carboxylate, sulfonate or sulfate group or their corresponding acid form. The anionic surface active agents<br><br>
WO 2005/121293<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005753<br><br>
8<br>
include the alkali metal (e.g. sodium and potassium) and nitrogen based bases (e.g. monoamines and polyamines) salts of water soluble higher alkyl aryl sulfonates, alkyl sulfonates, alkyl sulfates and the alkyl poly ether sulfates. They may also include fatty acid or fatty acid soaps. One of the preferred groups of mono-anionic surface active agents are the alkali metal, <br>
5 	 ammonium or alkanolamine salts of higher alkyl aryl sulfonates and alkali metal, ammomum or alkanolamine salts of higher alkyl sulfates or the mono-anionic polyamine salts. Preferred higher alkyl sulfates are those in which the alkyl groups contain 8 to 26 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 22 carbon atoms and more preferably 14 to 18 carbon atoms. The alkyl group in the alkyl aryl sulfonate preferably contains 8 to 16 carbon atoms and more preferably 10 to<br>
10   15 carbon atoms. A particularly preferred alkyl aryl sulfonate is the sodium, potassium or ethanolamine Cio to Ci6 benzene sulfonate, e.g. sodium linear dodecyl benzene sulfonate. The primary and secondary alkyl sulfates can be made by reacting long chain olefins with sulfites or bisulfites, e.g. sodium bisulfite. The alkyl sulfonates can also be made by reacting long chain normal paraffin hydrocarbons with sulfur dioxide and oxygen as describe in U.S. Patent<br>
15  Nos. 2,503,280,2,507,088, 3,372,188 and 3,260,741 to obtain normal or secondary higher alkyl sulfates suitable for use as surfactant detergents.<br>
The alkyl substituent is preferably linear, i.e. normal alkyl, however, branched chain alkyl sulfonates can be employed, although they are not as good with respect to biodegradability.<br>
20  The alkane, i.e. alkyl, substituent may be terminally sulfonated or may be joined, for example, to the 2-carbon atom of the chain, i.e. may be a secondary sulfonate. It is understood in the art that the substituent may be joined to any carbon on the alkyl chain. The higher alkyl sulfonates can be used as the alkali metal salts, such as sodium and potassium. The preferred salts are the sodium salts. The preferred alkyl sulfonates are the Cio to Cis primary normal alkyl sodium<br>
25   and potassium sulfonates, with the Cio to Ci5 primary normal alkyl sulfonate salt being more preferred.<br>
Mixtures of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and higher alkyl sulfates can be used as well as mixtures of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and higher alkyl polyether sulfates. <br>
30<br>
The alkali metal or ethanolamine sulfate can be used in admixture with the alkylbenzene sulfonate in an amount of 0 to 70%, preferably 5 to 50% by weight.<br><br>
WO 2005/121293<br><br>
PCT7EP2005/005753<br><br>
9<br>
The higher alkyl polyethoxy sulfates used in accordance with the present invention can be normal or branched chain alkyl and contain lower alkoxy groups which can contain two or three carbon atoms. The normal higher alkyl polyether sulfates are preferred in that they <br>
5	have a higher degree of biodegradability than the branched chain alkyl and the lower poly alkoxy groups are preferably ethoxy groups.<br>
The preferred higher alkyl polyethoxy sulfates used in accordance with the present invention are represented by the formula: <br>
10<br>
R1-O(CH2CH2O)p-So3M,<br>
where R1 is Cg to C20 alkyl, preferably C10 to Cig and more preferably C12 to C15", p is 1 to 8, preferably 2 to 6, and more preferably 2 to 4; and M is an alkali metal, such as sodium <br>
15   	and potassium, an ammonium cation or polyamine. The sodium and potassium salts, and polyaimines are preferred.<br>
A preferred higher alkyl poly ethoxylated sulfate is the sodium salt of a triethoxy C12 to C15 alcohol sulfate having the formula: <br>
20<br>
C12-15-0-(CH2CH20)3-S03Na<br>
Examples of suitable alkyl ethoxy sulfates that can be used in accordance with the present invention are C12-15 normal or primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; n-decyl diethoxy 2 5  sulfate, sodium salt; C12 primary alkyl diethoxy sulfate, ammonium salt; C12 primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; C15 primary alkyl tetraethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; mixed C14-15 normal primary alkyl mixed tri- and tetraethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; stearyl pentaethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; and mixed C10-18 normal primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, potassium salt.<br>
30  The normal alkyl ethoxy sulfates are readily biodegradable and are preferred. The alkyl<br>
poly-lower alkoxy sulfates can be used in mixtures with each other and/or in mixtures with the above discussed higher alkyl benzene, sulfonates, or alkyl sulfates.<br><br>
WO 2005/121293<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005753<br><br>
10<br>
The alkali metal higher alkyl poly ethoxy sulfate can be used with the alkylbenzene sulfonate and/or with an alkyl sulfate, in an amount of 0 to 70%, preferably 5 to 50% and more preferably 5 to 20% by weight of entire composition<br>
 5<br>
Cationic Surfactants<br>
Many cationic surfactants are known in the art, and almost any cationic surfactant having   at least one long chain alkyl group of about 10 to 24 carbon atoms is suitable in the present <br>
10  invention. Such compounds are described in "Cationic Surfactants", Jungermann, 1970, incorporated by reference.<br>
Specific cationic surfactants which can be used as surfactants in the subject invention are described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,497,718, hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
 15<br>
As with the nonionic and anionic surfactants, the compositions of the invention may use cationic surfactants alone or in combination with any of the other surfactants known in the art. Of course, the compositions may contain no cationic surfactants at all.<br>
20  Amphoteric Surfactants<br>
Ampholytic synthetic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic or aliphatic derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines in which the aliphatic radical maybe straight chain or branched and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents<br>
2	5   contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and at least one contains an anionic water-soluble<br>
group, e.g. carboxylate, sulfonate, sulfate. Examples of compounds falling within this definition are sodium 3-(dodecylamino)propionate, sodium 3- (dodecylamino) propane-1-sulfonate, sodium 2-(dodecylamino)ethyl sulfate, sodium 2- (dimethylamino) octadecanoate, disodium 3-(N-carboxymethyldodecylamino)propane 1-sulfonate, disodium<br>
3	0  octadecyl-imminodiacetate, sodium l-carboxymethyl-2- undecylimidazole, and sodium N,N-<br>
bis (2-hydroxyethyl)-2-sulfato-3- dodecoxypropylamine. Sodium 3- (dodecylamino) propane-1-sulfonate is preferred.<br><br>

with the composition of the invention. The enzymes may be used together with co-factors required to promote enzyme activity, i.e., they may be used in enzyme systems, if required. It should also be understood that enzymes having mutations at various positions (e.g., enzymes engineered for performance and/or stability enhancement) are also contemplated by the <br>
5  invention.<br>
The enzyme stabilization system may comprise calcium ion; boric acid, propylene glycol and/or short chain carboxylic acids. The composition preferably contains from about 0.01 to about 50, preferably from about 0.1 to about 30, more preferably from about 1 to about 20 <br>

PCT/EP2005/005753<br><br>
17<br>
Boric acid is preferred, although other compounds such as boric oxide, borax and other alkali metal borates (e.g., sodium ortho-, meta- and pyroborate and sodium pentaborate) are suitable.

Another preferred stabilization system is the pH jump system such as is taught in U.S. Patent <br>
10	No. 5,089,163 to Aronson et al., hereby incorporated by reference into the subject application. A pH jump heavy duty liquid is a composition containing a system of components designed to adjust the pH of the wash liquor. To achieve the required pH regimes, a pH jump system can be employed in this invention to keep the pH of the product low for enzyme stability in multiple enzyme systems (e.g., protease and lipase systems) yet allow it to become moderately <br>
15	high in the wash for detergency efficacy. One such system is borax IOH2O/ polyol. Borate ion and certain cis 1,2 polyols complex when concentrated to cause a reduction in pH. Upon dilution, the complex dissociates, liberating free borate to raise the pH. Examples of polyols which exhibit this complexing mechanism with borax include catechol, galacitol, fructose, sorbitol and pinacol. For economic reasons, sorbitol is the preferred polyol.<br>
 20<br>
Sorbitol or equivalent component (i.e., 1,2 polyols noted above) is used in the pH jump formulation in an amount from about 1 to 25% by wt, preferably 3 to 15% by wt. of the composition.<br>
25 Borate or boron compound is used in the pH jump composition in an amount from about 0.5 to 10.0% by weight of the composition, preferably 1 to 5% by weight.<br>

The bentonite in its more purified form (i.e. free from any grit, sand, etc.) suitable for detergents contains at least 50% <br>
5	montmorillonite and thus its cation exchange capacity is at least about 50 to 75 meq per lOOg of bentonite. Particularly preferred bentonites are the Wyoming or Western U.S. bentonites which have been sold as Thixo-jels 1,2,3 and 4 by Georgia Kaolin Co. These bentonites are known to soften textiles as described in British Patent No. 401,413 to Marriott and British Patent No. 461,221 to Marriott and Guam. <br>

The preferred process is as follows:<br>
Premix 1 was prepared by mixing nonionic surfactant and EFAD at 50°C to form a clear<br>
5	liquid. Alternatively, fatty acid and LAS acid may be formed Premix 2 by mixing about 1 part of fatty acid with about 5 parts of LAS acid and heated to 60°C to form a clear liquid, followed by the addition of the rest of LAS acid without heat. Water, Na-Xylenesulfonate and/or other hydrotropes, 50% NaOH solution and borax were added to the main mix to form a clear solution. Followed by the addition of conjugated acids of anionic surfactants or Premix<br>
10  	After the neutralization, Premix 1 was added and mixed into the main mix. The rest of the ingredients, such as sodium LES, whitening agent, functional polymers, perfume, enzyme, colorant, preservatives were added at the last stage and mixed until the batch became an isotropic liquid.<br>
15 Preferably, the detergent composition is a colored composition packaged in the transparent/translucent ("see-through") container.<br>

Particulate Soil Removal Evaluation:<br>
Evaluation for removal of particulate soil was conducted from a single wash in warm water at<br>
10   32°C. A benchmark detergent was also tested for the purpose of comparison. The fabrics used in the test were cotton and 50/50cotton/polyester.. A Hunter reflection meter was used to measure L, a, and b which are taken to calculate SRI Index values using the following equation: SRI=100 - [(Lf - Li)2+ (af - ai)2+ (bf -biff2 . The delta value is the difference between the prototype sample and the benchmark in SRI Index. Statistical significance of the<br>
15  data was calculated at 95% confidence level using SAS/JMP Analysis of variance. The higher the SRI value, the better the cleaning.<br>
Foam Height Test<br>
The foam height test was measured by the method of " The Standard Test Method for <br>
20  Foaming Properties of Surface Active Agents" as described in ASTM Dl 173-53 method.    Formulations at a concentration of 0.19% were used. Initial foam height and the foam heights up to 5 minutes were recorded every minute.<br>

EXAMPLES 4-5 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE C<br>
5	 Examples 4 and 5 were prepared by making Premix 1 by mixing and heating EFAD with either Neodol 25-9 or mono-ester of ethoxylated fatty acid to form an isotropic liquid. The order of addition in the Main-mix for all three examples was water, Na-Citrate, Triethanolamine, Di-ethanolamine, and borax. After the full dissolution of borax, Na-Xylenesulfonate, LAS acid and fatty acid were added into the batch, followed by the rest of the ingredients, including Premix 1, to the batch and mixed until the batch reached the isotropic stage. The pH values of the examples were about 7.8. The results that were obtained are summarised in Table 3. TABLE 3<br><br>
