The stabilizers of component (b) and optional further stabilizers may be added to the material to be stabilized of component (a), e.g. the polyolefin, individually or mixed with one another. If desired, the individual components of a stabilizer mixture can be mixed with one another in the melt (melt blending) before incorporation into the material to be stabilized.<br>
The additives of the invention (present component (b)) and optional further components may be added to the polymer material individually or mixed with one another. If desired, the individual components can be mixed with one another before incorporation into the polymer for example by dry blending, compaction or in the melt.<br>
The incorporation of the additives of the invention and optional further components into the polymer is carried out by known methods such as dry blending in the form of a powder, or wet mixing in the form of solutions, dispersions or suspensions for example in an inert solvent, water or oil. The additives of the invention and optional further additives may be incorporated, for example, before or after molding or also by applying the dissolved or dispersed addrtve or additive mixture to the polymer material, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent or the suspension/dispersion agent. They may be added directly into the processing apparatus (e.g. extruders, internal mixers, etc), e.g. as a dry mixture or powder or as solution or dispersion or suspension or melt.<br>
The incorporation can be carried out in any heatable container equipped with a stirrer, e.g. in a closed apparatus such as a kneader, mixer or stirred vessel. The incorporation is preferably carried out in an extruder or in a kneader. It is immaterial whether processing takes place in an inert atmosphere or in the presence of oxygen.<br>
The addition of the additive or additive blend to the polymer can be carried out in all customary mixing machines in which the polymer is melted and mixed with the additives.<br><br>
Suitable machines are known to those skilled in the art. They are predominantly mixers, kneaders and extruders.<br>
The process is preferably carried out in an extruder by introducing the additive during processing.<br>
Particularly preferred processing machines are single-screw extruders, contrarotating and corotating twin-screw extruders, planetary-gear extruders, ring extruders or cokneaders. It is also possible to use processing machines provided with at least one gas removal compartment to which a vacuum can be applied.<br>
Suitable extruders and kneaders are described, for example, in Handbuch der Kunststoffex-trusion, Vol. 1 Grundlagen, Editors F. Hensen, W: Knappe, H. Potente, 1989, pp. 3-7\ ISBN:3-446-14339-4 (Vol 2 Extrushnsaniagen 1986, ISBN 3-446-14329-7).<br>
For example, the screw length is 1 - 60 screw diameters, preferably 35-43 screw diameters. The rotational speed of the screw is preferably 10 - 600 rotations per minute (rpm), very particularly preferably 25 - 300 rpm.<br>
The maximum throughput is dependent on the screw diameter, the rotational speed and the driving force. The process of the present invention can also be carried out at a level lower than maximum throughput by varying the parameters mentioned or employing weighing machines delivering dosage amounts.<br>
If a plurality of components are added, these can be premixed or added individually.<br>
The additives of the invention and optional further additives can also be sprayed onto the polymer material. They are able to dilute other additives (for example the conventional additives indicated above) or their melts so that they can be sprayed also together with these additives onto the material. Addition by spraying during the deactivation of the polymerization catalysts is particularly advantageous; in this case, the steam evolved may be used for deactivation of the catalyst. In the case of spherically polymerized polyolefins it may, for example, be advantageous to apply the additives of the invention, optionally together with other additives, by spraying.<br>
The additives of the invention and optional further additives can also be added to the polymer in the form of a masterbatch ("concentrate") which contains the components in a concentration of, for example, about 1 % to about 40% and preferably 2 % to about 20 % by weight incorporated in a polymer. The polymer must not be necessarily of identical structure<br><br>
than the polymer where the additives are added finally. In such operations, the polymer can be used in the form of powder, granules, solutions, suspensions or in the form of iatices.<br>
incorporation can take place prior to or during the shaping operation, or by applying the dissolved or dispersed compound to the polymer, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent In the case of elastomers, these can also be stabilized as Iatices. A further possibility for incorporating the additives of the invention into polymers is to add them before, during or directly after the polymerization of the corresponding monomers or prior to crosslinking. In this context the additive of the invention can be added as it is or else in encapsulated form (for example in waxes, oils or polymers).<br>
The materials containing the additives of the invention described herein can be used for the production of moldings, rotomolded articles, injection molded articles, blow molded articles, films, tapes, mono-filaments, fibers, nonwovens, profiles, adhesives or putties, surface coatings and the like.<br>

The materials containing the stabilizer mixtures described herein can be used for the production of moldings, rotomolded articles, injection molded articles, blow molded articles, films, tapes, mono-filaments, fibers, surface coatings and the like.<br>
Likewise of particular interest is the use of the present compounds as stabilizers for coatings, for example for paints. The invention therefore also relates to those compositions whose component (a) is a film-forming binder for coatings and component (b) is the stabilizer of present invention.<br>
The use of the novel stabilizer in coatings is accompanied by the additional advantage that it prevents delamination, i.e. the fiaking-off of the coating from the substrate. This advantage is particularly important in the case of metallic substrates, including multilayer systems on metallic substrates. Substrates to be coated include wood, ceramic materials, metals, plastics, or articles coated or stained with organic materials.<br>
The binder (component (a)) can in principle be any binder which is customary in industry, for example those described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 368-426, VCH, Weinheim 1991. In general, it is a film-forming binder based on a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin, predominantly on a thermosetting resin. Examples thereof are alkyd, acrylic, polyester, phenolic, melamine, epoxy and polyurethane resins and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Component (a) can be a cold-curable or hot-curable binder; the addition of a curing catalyst may be advantageous. Suitable catalysts which accelerate curing of the binder are described, for example, in Ulimann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A18, p.469, VCH Veriagsgesellscnaft, Weinheim 1991.<br>
Preference is given to coating compositions in which component (a) is a binder comprising a functional acrylate resin and a crosslrnking agent.<br>
Examples of coating compositions containing specific binders are:<br>
1.	paints based on cold- or hot-crossiinkable alkyd, acrylate, polyester, epoxy or melamine resins or mixtures of such resins, if desired with addition of a curing catalyst;<br>
2.	two-component polyurethane paints based on hydroxyl-containing acrylate, polyester or polyether resins and aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br><br>
3.	two-component polyurethane paints based on thioi-containing acrylate, polyester or polyether resins and aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>

5.	one-component polyurethane paints based on aliphatic or aromatic urethanes or polyurethanes and hydroxyl-containing acrylate, polyester or polyether resins;<br>
6.	one-component polyurethane paints based on aliphatic or aromatic urethaneacrylates or polyurethaneacrylates having free amino groups within the urethane structure and melamine resins or polyether resins, if necessary with curing catalyst;<br>
7.	two-component paints based on (poly)ketimines and aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>

9.	two-component paints based on carboxyl- or amino-containing polyacrylates and poiyepoxides;<br><br>
10.	two-component paints based on acrylate resins containing anhydride groups and on a polyhydroxy or polyamino component;<br>

17.	UV-curable systems based on oligomeric urethane acryiates and/or acrylatacrylaten, rf desired in combination with other oligomers or monomers;<br>
18.	dual cure systems, which are cured first by heat and subsequently by UV or electron irradiation, or \f\ce versa, and whose components contain ethylenic double bonds capable to react on irradiation with UV light in presence of a photoinrtiator or with an electron beam.<br>
Coating systems based on siloxanes are also possible, e.g. systems described in WO 98/56852, WO 98/56853, DE-A-2914427, or DE-A-4338361.<br>
In addition to components (a) and (b), the coating composition according to the invention preferably comprises as component (C) a light stabilizer of the sterically hindered amine type, for example as mentioned in the above list. Further examples for light stabilizers of the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyi)-1,3,5-triazine type advantageously to be added can be found e.g. in the publications US-A-4619956, EP-A-434608, US-A-5198498, US-A-5322868, US-A-5369140, US-A-5298067, WO-94/18278, EP-A-704437, GB-A-2297091, WO-96/28431.<br>
To achieve maximum light stability, it is of particular interest to add sterically hindered amines as set out in the abovementioned list. The invention therefore also relates to a coating composition which in addition to components (a) and (b) comprises as component (C) a light stabilizer of the sterically hindered amine type.<br>
This stabilizer is preferably a 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidine derivative or a 3,3,5,5-tetraalkyl-morpholin-2-one derivative containing at least one group of the formula<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Apart from components (a), (b) and, if used, (C), the coating composition can also comprise further components, examples being solvents, pigments, dyes, piastictzers, stabilizers, rheologic or thixotropic agents, drying catalysts and/or levelling agents. Examples of possible components are described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 429-471, VCH, Weinheim 1991.<br>
Possible drying catalysts or curing catalysts are, for example, free (organic) acids or bases, or (organic) blocked acids or bases which may be deblocked by thermal treatment or irradiation, organometaitic compounds, amines, amino-containing resins and/or phosphines. Examples of organometallic compounds are metal carboxylates, especially those of the metals Pb, Mn, Co, Zn, Is or Cut or metal chelates, especially those of the metals Al, Ti, Zr or Hf, or organometallic compounds such as organotin compounds.<br>
Examples of metal carboxylates are the stearates of Pb, Mn or Zn, the octoates of Co, Zn or Cu, the naphthenates of Mn and Co or the corresponding linoieates, resinates or tallates.<br>
Examples of metal chelates are the aluminium, titanium or zirconium chelates of acetylacetone, ethyl acetyiacetate, salicyialdehyde, salicyfaldoxime, o-hydroxyacetophenone or ethyl trifluoroacetylacetate, and the alkoxides of these metals.<br>
Examples of organotin compounds are dibutyltin oxide, dibutyltin dilaurate ordibutyltin dioctoate.<br>
Examples of amines are, in particular, tertiary amines, for example tributylamine, triethanolamine, Nl-methyldiethanoiamine, N-dimethylethanolamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclooctane (triethylenediamine), diazabicycloundecene, DBN<br><br>
(= 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene), and salts thereof. Further examples are quaternary ammonium salts, for example trimethylbenzylammonlum chloride.<br>
Amino-containing resins are simultaneously binder and curing catalyst. Examples thereof are amino-containing acrytate copolymers.<br>
The curing catalyst used can also be a phosphine, for example triphenylphosphine.<br>
The novel coating compositions can also be radiation-curable coating compositions. In this case, the binder essentially comprises monomelic or oHgomeric compounds containing ethylenically unsaturated bonds (prepolymers), which after application are cured by actinic radiation, i.e. converted into a crosslinked, high molecular weight form. Where the system is UV-curing, it generally contains at least one photoinitiator as well. Corresponding systems are described in the abovementioned publication UHmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. At8, pages 451-453. In radiation-curable coating compositions, the novel stabilizers can also be employed without the addition of sterically hindered amines.<br>
The coating compositions according to the invention can be applied to any desired substrates, for example to metal, wood, plastic or ceramic materials. They are preferably used as topcoat in the finishing of automobiles. If the topcoat comprises two layers, of which the lower layer is pigmented and the upper layer is not pigmented, the novel coating composition can be used for either the upper or the lower layer or for both layers, but preferably for the upper layer.<br>
The novel coating compositions can be applied to the substrates by the customary methods, for example by brushing, spraying, pouring, dipping or electrophoresis; see also Ulimann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. At 8, pp. 491-500.<br>
Depending on the binder system, the coatings can be cured at room temperature or by heating. The coatings are preferably cured at 50 - 150°C, and in the case of powder coatings or coil coatings even at higher temperatures.<br>
The coatings obtained in accordance with the invention have excellent resistance to the damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat; particular mention should be made of the good light stability and weathering resistance of the coatings thus obtained, for example paints.<br><br>
The coating compositions can comprise an organic solvent or solvent mixture in which the binder is soluble. The coating composition can otherwise be an aqueous solution or dispersion. The vehicle can also be a mixture of organic solvent and water. The coating composition may be a high-solids paint or can be solvent-free (e.g. a powder coating material). Powder coatings are, for example, those described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Ed., A18, pages 438-444. The powder coating material may also have the form of a powder-slurry (dispersion of the powder preferably in water).<br>
The pigments can be inorganic, organic or metallic pigments. The novel coating compositions preferably contain no pigments and are used as a clearcoat.<br>
Likewise preferred is the use of the coating composition as a topcoat for applications in the automobile industry, especially as a pigmented or unpigmented topcoat of the paint finish. Its use for underlying coats, however, is also possible.<br>
Addition of the present stabilizer to a pigmented coating may also protect the pigment from damaging effects of UV radiation, especially in the case of liquid crystal pigments.<br>
For the preparation of thin UV absorbing layers, the present stabilizers may also be applied on the substrate using plasma deposition. Methods of obtaining a plasma under vacuum conditions has been widely described in the literature, with inductive or capacitive coupling of electrical energy. Direct (DC) or alternating current (AC) may be used with frequencies ranging from the low kHz to the MHz and even microwave (GHz) range.<br>
Preferres substrates are selected from metals, semiconductors, glass, quartz or thermoplastic, crosslinked or structurally crosslinked plastics.<br>
Preferred semiconductor is silicon, e.g. in the form of wavers.<br>
Metals are preferably aluminum, chromium, steel, vanadium, as used for manufacturing of high precision reflectors such as telescope mirrors or beam reflectors. Especially preferred is aluminum.<br><br>
Primary plasma gas can be, for example, He, Ar, Xe, N2, 02 or air, preferred are inert gases such as He, argon or xenon. When vaporized, the stabilizers mix with the plasma gas and are likewise ionized.<br>
In general, the deposition process is not sensitive in respect of gas added or type of energy coupling.<br>
Relatively low pressure is important. Preferably, the pressure ranges from 10-6 mbar to 10'2 mbar, especially from 10"3 to If/4 mbar.<br>
The material may be deposited on a plasma electrode and evaporated right away. Preferably, the materia! to be evaporated is located on a plate or in a crucible which may be heated separately, outside the range of the plasma discharge. Cncible or plate may be on positive or negative electric potential related to the plasma.<br>
Some embodiments of plasma generation and deposition have been described, for example, by A. T. Bell, "Fundamentals of Plasma Chemistry" in Technology and Application of Plasma Chemistry", ed. by J. R. Holahan and A. T. Be!!, Wiley, New York (1974); or by H. Suhr, Plasma Chem. Plasma Process 3(1),1, (1983).<br>
The temperature for evaporating the stabilizers is preferably 20°C to 350°C, especially 100°Cto250°C.<br>
This process is especially suitable for the deposition of thin layers. Preferably, the layer thickness obtained by plasma deposition is from 10 nm to 1000 nm, more preferably from 50 nm to 500 nm, and especially preferred from 100 nm to 300 nm.<br>
The present UV absorber combination may also be used in reprographic materials or recording materials, such as films, papers, paper coatings or printing inks. Application in reprographic paper or printing substrates is, for example, as described in EP-A-1308308, especially sections [0010], [0017] and examples therein, or US-5073448, see especially column 6, line 53, until column 10, line 54, or the examples, using the present UV absorber combination instead of the UVA of formula I.<br><br>
Applications in photographic material and other recording materials, as well as further components to be used therein together with the present UV absorber combination, are, for example, as described in GB-A-2343007 from page 22, last paragraph, until page 134, last paragraph. The novel UV absorber combination may also be used with advantage in optical recording layers and materials, wherein a laser beam effects a change of optical properties, e.g. by short wavelength irradiation by means of a blue laser diode (wavelength e.g. 405 nm), allowing storage of digital information which may be retrieved again from the storage layer or storage medium. Exampies for such uses and materials can be found, inter alia, in JP-A-2001 -277720; JP-A-2002-160452.<br>
The novel UV absorber combination may be used for protecting its substrate (e.g. thermoplastic polymer or coating) as well as other light sensitive components such as pigments or dyes.<br>
The UV absorber combination according to the invention can also be used advantageously in protective coatings, films and foils in liquid crystal displays for protection against UV radiation and to protect polymer material and other components in the liquid crystal displays against damage by UV light. Examples of such fields of application and materials are to be found inter alia in:<br>
JP-A-10-152568 (9.6.1998); JP-A-2000-227509 (8.2.1999); JP-A-2000-227508 (2.8.1999); JP-A-11-258425 (30.11.1998); JP-A-11-258421 (13.3.1998); JP-A-11-242119 (30.11.1998); JP-A-11-119003 (13.10.1997); JP-A-09-288213 (19.4.1996); JP-A-09-288212 (19.4.1996); JP-A- 08-216316 (14.2.1995); JP-A-08-216324 (14.2.1995); and Chem. Abstr. 131:45869. A preferred type of polymer film in this type of application is based on cycloolefins, for instance of cyciopentene or norbomene, as listed further above under point 1, line 3, in the list of polymers which can be stabilized.<br>
The UV absorber combination of present invention is further effective in cosmetic formulations for the protection of human (or animal) skin or hair against UV radiation.<br>

The stabilizers of the instant component (b) and optional further stabilizers are preferably present in the material to be stabilized in an amount of 0.01 to 10% by weight,<br><br>
relative to the material to be stabilized. An amount of 0.01 to 5% by weight or 0.05 to 2% by weight, in particular 0.05 to 0.5% by weight is especially preferred.<br>
The stabilizer(s) of component (b) and optional further additives can also be added to the material to be stabilized in the form of a masterbatch which contains these components in a concentration of, for example, about 2.5 % to about 25 % by weight; in such operations, the polymer can be used in the form of powder, granules, solutions, suspensions or in the form of latices.<br>

Generally, the present UV absorber combination may advantageously be used in multilayer systems, where the concentration of the novel stabilizer (component (b)) in the outer layer can be relatively high, for example from 1 to 15 parts by weight of (b), in particular 3-10 parts by weight of (b), per 100 parts by weight of the polymeric substrate (a).<br>
In a similar manner, UV filter layers may be obtained using the present UV absorber combination in the top layer or one of the top layers of a coextruded article, e.g. a coextruded polycarbonate sheet, a polyester packaging film, a potyoiefin covering film, or the top layer of a coating. Depending on the specific application, the amount of UV absorber combination of the invention incorporated in these layers may vary from relatively high loadings (e.g. 3-15 parts per 100 parts of polycarbonate, thickness of layer ca. 10-100 \im), to relatively low loadings (e.g. 0.1 - 0.8 parts per 100 parts of polyolefin, especially polyethylene, in an agricultural film).<br>

Example 2: Paintabie TPO<br>
Molded test specimens are prepared by injection molding thermoplastic olefin (TPO) pellets containing the instant compounds, pigments and other coadditives as described in Example 1.<br>
The light stable formulations are painted with one-pack paint systems and tested for TPO/paint interactions. Before painting, the test specimens are first washed m accordance with GM998-4801 and dried for 15 minutes at 200°F (94°C). Adhesion promoter is applied to the dry film thickness of 0.2-0.4 mils. The samples are dried for five minutes before a 1K basecoat is applied to a film thickness of 1.2-1.4 mils. The painted panels are dried for three minutes, a clearcoat is then applied to a dry film thickness of 1.2-1.5 mils followed by ten minutes flash drying and a 30 minute oven bake at 250°F (121°C).<br>
Paint adhesion is measured by Aggressive Adhesion Testing (proprietary test procedure conducted at Technical Finishing, inc.) and Taber Scuff.

3B) Stabilization of a 2 component polvurethane coating<br>
The novel stabilizer mixtures are tested in a clearcoat having the following composition:<br>
I. Polvol component<br>
•	MacrynalSM510n(65%)a)       75.0g<br>
•	Butylglycol acetate	15.0g<br><br><br>

1.5% of the mixture to be tested is added in a solution in about 5-10 g of Solvesso® 100 to the clearcoat, based on the solids content of the paint. The coating formulations are additionally admixed with 1.0% by weight, based on the solids content of the paint, of a costabilizer (compound C) with main component of<br><br>
The comparison used is a clearcoat containing no light stabilizer and a clearcoat stabilized using 1.5 % of compound A or B instead of the present UVA combination; the corresponding results are marked in the tables below with an asterisk (**).<br><br>
The clearcoat is diluted to spray viscosity with Sofvesso®100 and applied to a prepared aluminium panel (coil coat, filler, silver metallic base-coat) and the painted panel is baked at 130°C for 30 minutes. This gives a clearcoat dry-film thickness of 40-50 pm.<br>
Subsequently, the yellowing is detected compared to the same coating containing no UV absorber mixture of the invention (color measurements on an Applied Color Systems spectrophotometer by reflectance mode according to ASTM D 2244-79; data collected include delta E, L*. a* and b* values).<br>
The samples are then subjected to weathering in an UVCON® weathering device from Atlas Corp. (UVB-313 lamps) with a cycle of 8 h of UV irradiation at 70°C and 4 h of condensation at 50°C. Further samples are subjected to natural weathering (Florida, 5° south, SAE J-1976).<br>

6)	1% in Solvesso 1504); manufacturer: Bayer AG<br>
1.5% of the mixture to be tested is added in a solution in about 5-10 g of Solvesso® 100 to the clearcoat, based on the solids content of the paint. The coating formulations are additionally admixed with 0.7% by weight, based on the solids content of the paint, of a costabilizer (compound C = HALS 24) of the formula<br><br><br>
The comparison used is a clearcoat containing no light stabilizer and a clearcoat stabilized using the individual components; the corresponding results are marked in the tables below with an asterisk {*).<br>
The clearcoat is diluted to spray viscosity with Solvesso®100 and applied to a prepared aluminium panel (coil coat, filler, silver metallic or blue metallic base-coat) and the painted panel is baked at 130°C for 30 minutes. This gives a clearcoat dry-film thickness of 40-50 \xm.<br>
The samples are then subjected to weathering in an UVCON® weathering device from-Atlas Corp. (UVB-313 lamps) with a cycle of 8 h of UV irradiation at 70°C and 4 h of condensation at 50°C. Further samples are subjected to natural weathering (Florida, 5° south, SAE J-1976).<br>
The surface gloss (20° gloss in accordance with DIN 67530) and the colour change (AE in accordance with DIN 6174) of the samples are measured at regular<br>
intervals.<br>
The results are compiled in Tables C1 and C2 below. All amounts are based on the solids content of the clearcoat.<br>
The smaller the colour change value, the better the stabilization.<br>
The samples stabilized in accordance with the invention exhibit better weathering stability<br>
(gloss and colour retention) than comparison samples.<br><br>
Example 4: Coatings over Plastic Substrates<br>
A major application for hindered amines is in the protection of automotive topcoats applied over plastic substrates. However, many low molecular weight, non-reactable light stabilizers migrate into the plastic substrate during drying and cure. As a consequence, a significant portion of the light stabilizer may be lost from the topcoat into the substrate and hence be ineffective in protecting said topcoat.<br>
The extent of migration of hindered amine stabilizers during application and cure of the coating is determined by comparing the concentration of hindered amine in the cured clearcoat applied over a plastic substrate versus the same ciearcoat applied over a non-permeable substrate such as glass or steel.<br>
UVA combinations under test are incorporated into a flexible thermoset acryfic/melamine clear coating appropriate for use on automotive plastic substrates. The UVA combination is incorporated at a level of 1.5% by weight based on total resins solids. In all combinations, the component (A) used is compound A1 at a level of 0.5% by weight based on total resins solids. Where 2 compounds are used as component (B), each compound is added in an amount of 0.5% by weight based on total resins solids.<br>
Some formulations additionally contain a sterically hindered amine at a level of 1.5% by weight based on total resins solids. The stabilizers added can be seen in the following table:<br><br><br><br>
Each coating formulation is applied by an automatic spray apparatus onto automotive grade RIM (Reacting Injection Molded) substrate and TPO (thermoplastic polyoiefin). Both substrates are in the form of 4" x 12" plaques. Each coating is applied to achieve a dry film thickness of approximately 2.0 mils {50 microns)- The coatings are cured by baking at 250°F (121°C) for 20 minutes.<br>
Triplicate samples of each cured coating formulation are removed from each substrate and cryo-ground to a fine powder, A known amount of each sample is extracted in refluxing toluene overnight. The UVA present is analyzed quantitatively by dilution to a known volume and spectrophotometry.<br>
With the present UVA combination, a high percent recovery of the UV absorbers from the cfearcoat over a plastic substrate is found indicating that much less of the present UVA migrate into the plastic substrate; thereby allowing for better stabilization of the clear topcoat over such plastic substrates.<br>
Example 5: Stabilization of Polypropylene Molded Articles<br>
Molded test specimens are prepared by injection molding polypropylene pellets containing pigments, a phosphite, a phenolic antioxidant or hydroxylamine, a metal stearate, ultraviolet light absorbers or a mixture of UV absorbers and hindered amine stabilizers.<br>
Pigmented polypropylene pellets are prepared from pure pigment or pigment concentrates, stabilizers, co-additives and commercially available polypropylene by mixing the components in a Superior/MPM 1" single screw extruder with a general all-purpose screw (24:1 L7D) at 475°F (250°C)&gt; cooled in a water bath and pelletized. The resulting<br><br>
pellets are molded into 60 mil (0.05 inch thick) 2"x2" plaques at about 475°F (250°C) on a BOY 30M Injection Molding Machine.<br>

In case that polycarbonate is processed at elevated temperature, a process stabilizer selected from phosphites, phosphonotes and phenolic antioxidants is used concomitantly. Good results are achieved using 0.05 or 0.1 %, based on the polycarbonate weight, of tris(2,4-di-tertbutylphenyl) phosphite; single layer sheets or multilayer sheets containing this phosphite and the above UVA mixture show reduced blooming, good transparency and excellent weathering results.<br><br>
Coextruded polycarbonate sheets are prepared as described in examples 1 and 6 of EP-A-825226, sample A, using present UVA combination instead of pure Tinuvin 1577, and with a total of 5 % of present UVA combination present in the cap layer of thickness 40 micrometer and 0.1 % of present UVA combination present in the bulk layer of thickness 7 mm. UVA combination used is compounds (A2) and (v) in a ratio 1 : 3 or (A2) and (xix) in a ratio 1:2. The produced sheets show essentially no fuming.<br><br>
Preparation of the formulation<br>
40g of the UV absorber suspension, 20g of the fatty alcohol polyglucoside and 40g water are mixed together und milled with a ball mill (Drais), so that the diameter of the milled particles becomes smaller than 1jim. Starting form this paste the other components of the above dispensing are admixed accordingly.<br>
The measured sun protection factors (SPF; Diffey und Robson) and photo stabilities detected show that the effective substances have a high photo stability and that a high sun protection factor can be obtained with a low concentration of present UVA combination.<br>
Example 16: Wood varnish<br>

(hindered amine light stabilizer, see above No. 24, Ciba Specialty Chemicals), the amounts being based in each case on the solids content of the binder. A comparative specimen is prepared without the addition of these stabilizers.<br>
The topcoat is applied by brush (3 applications) to the impregnated spruce boards, which are dried at room temperature for 24 hours after each application.<br><br>
The specimens are subsequently subjected to accelerated weathering: UV-A lamps with maximum light intensity at 340 nm; weathering cycle: 5 h of tight at 58°C, 1 h of spraying at 22°C.<br>
After the stated period of weathering the colour change AE is determined in accordance wrth DIN 6174; the comparison used is an unweathered specimen with unstabiiized impregnant and unstabiiized topcoat The resutts are collated in Table 16, ratios are indicated in parts by weight (pbw).<br><br>
The curing agent is the potassium salt of 2-hydroxy-4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazine. The wetting agent is sodium 4,8-diisobutylnaphthalene-2-sulfonate. As component (A), 75 mg of compound (A1), and as component (B), 75 mg of each of compounds (xiv) and (xv), or 150<br><br>
mg of compound (viii) is used.<br>
The gelatin layers are dried for 7 days at 20°C.<br>
Whrth the novel UVA combination, clear transparent layers are obtained which are suitable for a photographic recording material, for example as a UV fitter layer.<br>
Example 18: Pofyolefin Articles in Contact with Pool Chemicals (Chlorine)<br>
Rim grade polyethylene is dry blended with 10% loading of a test addrttve of formula (A) or (B)t as described in Example 8, and then melt compounded at 200°C into fully formulated master batch pellets. The master batch pellets are dry blended with the polyethylene resin to get the final stabilizer concentration. The fully formulated resin is then blown at 200°C into a 150 micron thick film using a DOLCl film line.<br>
The resulting films are exposed for 4 hours to 20 liters of a aqueous solution containing 22.5ppm Chlorine. The chlorine is made available via Leslies Fast Dissolving Super Shock - Super Chlorinator (Shock and Algae control) from OLIN Pool Products, Norwalk CT. This Super Shock is 78% Calcium Hypochlorite was used accordingly to make the 22.5ppm CI available. After the 4 hours of the chlorine exposure the samples were rinsed in Distilled water 3 times, and air dried to prepare them for accelerated weathering. A duplicate sample was exposed to distilled water without the Chlorine. All the dipped samples are exposed for 250 hour intervals in a Weather-O-meter 65 WR (ASTM D 2565-85 -dry) with a black panel temperature of 63°C. After each 250 hour interval of accelerated weathering, the samples were again exposed to the aqueous exposure as above.  Failure is defined as the time to a 50% loss of original elongation. This test is designed to simulate exposure to pool chemicals as would be experienced by pool covers.<br>
The films containing a present compound of formula (A2, 0.5%) and 0.5% of (i) or (viii) or (xiv) show good resistance to pool chemicals containing chlorine.<br>
Other polyolefin articles, such as pool hoses, exposed to pool chemicals containing a present compounds (A) and (B) show good resistance to pool chemicals containing chlorine.<br><br>
Example 19: Stabilization of Poiyolefins in Grease Filled Cable Construction<br>
100 parts high density polyethyfene are dry blended with 0.4 parts of Irganox® MD 1024 (1,2 -bis(3,5-di-tert-butyi-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamoy!)hydrazine) and the stabilizers listed in Table 15 below. The mixtures are rneit compounded into pellets at 230° C in a Superior/MPM extruder using a 24:1 L/D screw with Maddock mixing head at 60 rpm.<br>
The pelletized polyethylene containing the stabilizer mixtures are compression molded at 400° F into 10 mil (0.01 inch) thick films with Mylar backing. "Initial oxidation induction time" (OiT) is measured on these test films.<br>
The sample films are then submersed in Witcogei®, available from Witco, a typical hydrocarbon cable filler grease used in telecom cables   The Witco filling compound contains 0.6 % Irganox® 1035, thiodiethylene bis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]. The sample films submersed in the filling compound are exposed in an air oven at 70° C for 14 days. The samples are then wiped clean of the cable filler grease. "Aged oxidation induction time" is measured on these samples.<br>
OIT testing is accomplished using a differential scanning calorimeter as per ASTM standard test method D3895. The test conditions are: Uncrimped aluminum pan; no screen; heat up to 200° C under nitrogen, followed by a switch to a 100 milliliter/minute flow of oxygen. Oxidation induction time (OIT) is the time interval between the start of oxygen flow and the exothermic decomposition of the test specimen. OIT is reported in minutes; under the conditions of this test the longer the OIT the more effective the stabilizer mixture is at delaying the onset of oxidative degradation.  Relative performance of stabilizer mixtures in grease filled cable applications can be predicted by comparing the initial OIT values, the aged OIT values and the differences between the initial OIT and aged OIT values.<br><br><br>
