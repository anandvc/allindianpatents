FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention pertains generally to vehicle powertrain systems, and more specifically to<br>
a control system for a hybrid transmission system for a vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various hybrid powertrain architectures are known for managing the input and output<br>
torques of various prime-movers in hybrid vehicles, most commonly internal combustion<br>
engines and electric machines. Series hybrid architectures are generally characterized by<br>
an internal combustion engine driving an electric generator which in turn provides<br>
electrical power to an electric drivetrain and to a battery pack. The internal combustion<br>
engine in a series hybrid is not directly mechanically coupled to the drivetrain. The<br>
electric generator may also operate in a motoring mode to provide a starting function to<br>
the internal combustion engine, and the electric drivetrain may recapture vehicle braking<br>
energy by also operating in a generator mode to recharge the battery pack. Parallel hybrid<br>
architectures are generally characterized by an internal combustion engine and an electric<br>
motor which both have a direct mechanical coupling to the drivetrain. The drivetrain<br>
conventionally includes a shifting transmission to provide the preferable gear ratios for<br>
wide range operation.<br><br>
One hybrid powertrain architecture comprises a. two-mode, compound-split, electro-<br>
mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving power from a<br>
prime mover power source and an output member for delivering power from the<br>
transmission, typically to a vehicle driveline. First and second motor/generators are<br>
pperatively connected to an energy storage device for interchanging electrical power<br>
between the storage device and the first and second motor/generators. A control unit is<br>
provided for regulating the electrical power interchange between the energy storage<br>
device and the first and second motor/generators. The control unit also regulates,<br>
electrical power interchange . between the first and second motor/generators.<br>
Engineers implementing hybrid powertrain systems attempt to meet fuel economy and<br>
emissions targets by determining engine power from a required road-load power plus an<br>
additional quantity of engine power based on the energy storage system's (e.g. battery's)<br>
state-of-charge. Following determination of engine power, the engine's optima) fuel<br>
economy or optimal emissions map, or a combination thereof, may be used to select the<br>
engine's torque/speed operating point. The battery power used by the system is that which<br>
is required, in combination with the engine power, to meet the road-load power<br>
requirements and to compensate for power losses within the system.<br><br>
Some known systems do not simultaneously optimize power flow from all the propulsion<br>
system components. Typically, only engine operation is optimized. Additional factors<br>
such as system mechanical and electrical losses and battery usage factors are often not<br>
used in selecting the overall system's preferred operating point. Systems which attempt to<br>
account for system meshanical and electrical losses and. battery usage, factors in<br>
optimizing power flow of all propulsion system components have faced a daunting task<br>
of simultaneously calculating the various power flows, consuming substantial amounts of<br>
on-board computer processing resources, both in terms of processing time and<br>
throughput, and algorithm complexity.<br>
Therefore, there is a need to develop a hybrid powertrain control system which can<br>
optimize power flow from all the propulsion system components, accounting for losses,<br>
in a manner which effectively uses on-board computing resources.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a hybrid powertrain control system<br>
which optimizes power flow from all the propulsion system components, accounting for<br>
losses, in a manner which effectively uses on-board computing resources. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus, in accordance with the invention, an article of manufacture is provided, comprising<br>
a storage medium having a computer program encoded therein for effecting a method to<br>
determine a preferred operating range for a plurality of torquergenerative devices. Each<br>
of the torque-generative devices is operable to provide motive torque to a torque<br>
transmission device. The<br><br>
program comprises code for defining a first and a second operating range in a first<br>
operating space. The first operating range and the second operating range are<br>
mathematically transformed to a second operating space. The preferred operating range is<br>
defined in the second operating space based upon the transformed first operating range<br>
and the transformed second operating range.<br>
An aspect of the invention includes defining the first operating range based upon torque<br>
output for each of the torque-generative devices.<br>
Another aspect of the invention includes defining the second operating range based upon<br>
output of an electrical energy storage device operable to provide electrical energy to each<br>
of the torque-generative devices;<br>
Another aspect of the invention comprises defining the operating range based upon<br>
output of the electrical energy storage device and electrical energy system constraints,<br>
which further comprises limiting electrical energy transmission to the electrical energy<br>
storage system to limit charging of the electrical energy storage device, and to limit<br>
discharging of the electrical energy storage device.<br>
Another aspect of the invention comprises transforming the first operating range and the<br>
second operating range to the second operating space, which includes linearly<br>
transforming the first operating range and the second operating range from a radial<br>
dimension to an XY dimension.<br>
Another aspect of the invention comprises retransforming the defined preferred operating<br>
range to the first operating space.<br>
Another aspect of the invention comprises determine the preferred operating range for the<br>
torque-generative devices during a cycle time less than about twelve milliseconds.<br><br>

of eieptrical motor/generators, and the torque transmission device comprises a two-mode<br>
compound split hybrid electron-mechanical transmission which is operable to transmit<br>
motive torque to a drivejine of a vehicle,<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
upon reading and understanding the following detailed description of the embodiments.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating<br>
the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting,the same, FIGS. 1 and 2 show a<br>
system comprising an engine 14, transmission 10, control system, and driveline which<br>
has been constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in detail in commonly<br>
assigned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. U.S. 2005/0137042 A I, published Jun.<br>
23, 2005, entitled Two^Mode, Compound-Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical<br>
Transmission having Four Fixed Ratios, which is incorporated herein by reference. The<br>
exemplary two^mode, compound-split, electrormechanical hybrid transmission<br>
embodying the concepts of the present invention is depicted in FIG. I, and is designated<br>
generally by the numeral 10. The hybrid transmission 10 has an input member 12 that<br>
may be in the nature of a shaft which may be directly driven by an engine 1.4. A transient<br>
torque damper 20 is incorporated between the output shaft 18 of the engine 14 and the<br>
input member 12 of the hybrid transmission 10. The transient torque damper 20<br>
preferably comprises a torque transfer device 77 having characteristics of a damping<br>
mechanism and a spring, shown respectively as 78 and 79. The transient torque damper<br>
20 permits selective engagement of the engine 14 with the hybrid transmission 1Q, but it<br>
must be understood that the torque transfer device 77 is not utilized to change, or control,<br>
the mode in which the hybrid transmission 10 operates, The torque transfer device 77<br>
preferably comprises a hydraulically operated friction clutch, referred to as clutch C5.<br><br>
The engine 14 may be any of numerous forms of internal combustion engines, such as a<br>
spark-ignition engine or a compression-ignition engine, readily adaptable to provide a<br>
power output to the transmission 10 at a range of operating speeds, from idle, at or near<br>
600 revolutions per minute (RPM), to over 6,000 RPM. Irrespective of the means by<br>
which the engine 14 is connected to the input member 12 of the transmission 10, the<br>
input member 12 is connected to a planetary gear set 24 in the transmission 10.<br>
Referring specifically now to FIG. 1, the hybrid transmission 10 utilizes three planetary*<br>
gear sets 24, 26 and 28, The first planetary gear set 24 has an outer gear member 30 that<br>
may generally be designated as a ring gear, which circumsqribes an inner gear member<br>
32, generally designated as a sun gear. A plurality of planetary gear members 34 are<br>
rotatably mounted on a carrier 36 such that each planetary gear member 34 meshingly<br>
engages both the outer gear member 30 and the inner gear member 32.<br>
The second planetary gear set 26 also has an outer gear member 38, generally designated<br>
as a ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear member 40, generally designated as a<br>
sun gear. A plurality of planetary gear members 42 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 44<br>
such that each planetary gear 42 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 38 and<br>
the inner gear member 40.<br>
The third planetary gear set 28 also has an outer gear member 46, generally designated as<br>
a ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear member 48, generally designated as a sun<br>
gear. A plurality of planetary gear members 50 are rotatably. mounted on a carrier 52 such<br>
that each planetary gear 50<br><br>
rneshingiy engages bath the outer gear member 46 and the inner- gear member 48.<br>
Ratios of teeth on ring gears/sun gears are typically based upon design considerations<br>
known to skilled practitioners and outside the scope of the present invention. By way of<br>
example, in one embodiment, the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set<br>
24 is 65/33; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 26 is 65/33; and<br>
the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 28 is 94/34-<br>
The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple planetary gear sets.<br>
Furthermore, the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are compounded in that<br>
the inner gear member 32 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined, as through a hub<br>
plate gear 54, to the outer gear member 38 of the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
conjoined inner gear member 32 of the first planetary gear set 24 and the outer gear<br>
member 38 of the second planetary gear set 26 are continuously connected to a first<br>
motor/generator 56, also referred to as 'Motor AThe planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that the carrier 36 of the<br>
first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined, as through a shaft 60, to the carrier 44 of the<br>
second planetary gear set 26. As such, earners 36 and 44 of the first and second planetary<br>
gear sets 24 and 2,6, respectively, are conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively<br>
connected to the carrier 52 of the third planetary gear set 28, as through a torque transfer<br>
device 62 which, as will be hereinafter more fully explained, is employed to assist in the .<br>
selection of the operational modes of the hybrid transmission 10. The carrier 52 of the<br><br>
third planetary gear set 28 is connected, directly to the transmission output member 64.<br>
In the embodiment described herein, wherein the hybrid transmission 10 is used in a land<br>
vehicle, the output member 64 i§ operably connected to a driveline comprising a gear box<br>
90 or other torque transfer device which provides a torque output to one or more<br>
vehicular axles 92 or half-shafts (not shown). The axles 92, in turn, terminate in drive<br>
members 96. The drive members 96 may be either front or rear wheels of the vehicle on<br>
which they are employed, or they may be a drive gear of a track vehicle. The drive<br>
members 96 may have some form of wheel brake 94 associated therewith. The drive<br>
members each have a speed parameter, N.sub.WHL, comprising rotational speed of each<br>
wheel 96 which is typically measurable with a wheel speed sensor.<br>
The inner gear member 40 of the second planetary gear set 26 is connected to the inner<br>
gear member 48 of the third planetary gea.r set 28, as through a sleeve shaft 66 that<br>
circumscribes shaft 60. The outer gear member 46 of the third planetary gear set 28 is<br>
selectively connected to ground, represented by the transmission housing 68, through a<br>
torque transfer device 70. Torque transfer device 70, as is also hereinafter explained, is<br>
also employed to assist in the selection of the operational modes of the hybrid<br>
transmission 10. The sleeve shaft 66 is also continuously connected to a second<br>
motor/generator 72, also referred to as 'Motor B <br>
All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as the two motor/generators 56 and 72<br>
are coaxiajly oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft 60. Motor/generators 56 and 72<br>
are both of an annular configuration which permits them-to circumscribe the three<br>
planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such that the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are<br>
disposed radially inwardly of the motor/generators 56 and 72. This configuration assures<br>
that the. overall envelope,.i.e., the circumferential dimension, of the transmission 10 is<br>
minimized.<br>
A torque transfer device 73 selectively connects the sun gear 40 with ground, i.e., with<br>
transmission housing 68. A torque transfer device 75 is operative as a lock-up clutch,<br>
locking planetary gear sets 24, 26, motors 56, 72 and the input to rotate as a group, by<br>
selectively connecting the sun gear 40 with the carrier 44. The torque transfer devices 62,<br>
70, 73, 75 are all friction clutches, respectively referred to as follows: clutch CI 70,<br>
clutch C2 62, clutch C3 73, and clutch C4 75. Each clutch is preferably hydraulically<br>
actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump. Hydraulic actuation is<br>
accomplished using a known hydraulic fluid circuit, which is not described in detail<br>
herein,<br>
The hybrid transmission 10 receives input motive torque from a plurality of torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14 and the motors/generator? 56 and 72, as a<br>
result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical, energy<br>
storage device (ESD) 74, The ESD 74 typically comprises one or more batteries. Other<br>
electrical energy and electrochemical energy storage devices that have the ability to store<br>
electric power and dispense electric power may be used in place of the batteries<br><br>
without altering the concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74 is preferably sized<br>
based upon factors including regenerative requirements, application issues related to<br>
typical road grade and temperature, and propulsion requirements such as emissions,<br>
power assist and electric range. The ESP 74 is high voltage TJ&gt;C-coupled to transmission<br>
power inverter module (TPIM) 19 via DC lines or.transfer conductors 27, The TPIM 19<br>
is an element of the control, system described hereinafter with regard to FIG. 2. The<br>
. TPIM 19 communicates with the first motor/generator 56 by transfer conductors 29, and<br>
the TPIM 19.similarly communicates with the second motor/generator 72 by transfer<br>
conductors 31. Electrical current is transferable to or from the ESD 74 in accordance with<br>
whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power<br>
inverters and respective motor controllers configured to receive motor control commands<br>
and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration<br>
functionality.<br>
In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from the DC lines and<br>
provides AC current to the respective motor over transfer conductors 29 and 31. In<br>
regeneration control, the respective inverter receives AC current from the motor over<br>
transfer conductors 29 and 31 and provides current to the DC lines 27. The net DC<br>
current provided to or from the inverters determines the charge or discharge operating<br>
mode of the electrical energy, storage device 74. Preferably, Motor A 56 and Motor B 72<br>
are three-phase AC machines and the inverters comprise complementary three-phase<br>
power electronics.<br><br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, a drive gear 80 may be presented from the input member 12.<br>
As depicted, the drive gear 80 fixedly connects the input member 12 to the outer gear<br>
member 30 of the first planetary gear set 24, and the drive gear 80, therefore, receives<br>
power from, the engine 14 and/or the motor/generators 56 and/or 72 through planetary<br>
gear sets 24 and/or 26, The drive gear 80 meshingly engages an idler gear 82 which, in<br>
turn, meshingly engages a transfer gear 84 that is secured to one end of a shaft 86. The<br>
other end of the shaft 86 may be secured to a hydraulic/transmission fluid pump and/or<br>
power take-off ('PTO') unit, designated either individually or collectively at 88, and<br>
comprise an accessory load.<br>
Referring now tp FIG. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control system, comprising a<br>
distributed controller architecture, is shown. The elements described hereinafter comprise<br>
a subset of an overall vehicle control architecture, and are operable to provide<br>
coordinated system control of the powertrain system described herein. The control system<br>
is operable to synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to<br>
control various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware, including<br>
batteries of ESD 74 and motors 56, 72- The distributed controller architecture includes<br>
engine control module ('EClVf) 23, transmission control module (TCM') 17, battery<br>
pack control module OBPCiVr) 21, and Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPUVT)<br>
19. A hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and coordination of<br>
the aforementioned controllers. There is a User Interface ('UF) 13 operably connected to<br>
a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator typically<br><br>
controls or directs operation of the powertrain, including the transmission 10. Exemplary<br>
vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal,<br>
transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control. Each of the aforementioned<br>
controllers communicates with other controllers, sensors, and actuators via a local area<br>
network (XAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of control<br>
parameters and commands between the various controllers. The specific communication<br>
protocol utilized is application-specific, By way of example, one communications<br>
protocol is the Society of Automotive Engineers standard J1939. The LAN bus and<br>
appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and multHControlIer interfacing<br>
between the aforementioned controllers, and other controllers providing functionality<br>
such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br>
The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain system, serving to<br>
coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TP1M 19, and BPCM 21. Based upon<br>
various input signals from the UI 13 and the powertrain, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an engine torque command, T.sub.E.sub.--.sub.CMD; clutch<br>
torque commands, T.sub.CL.sub.—.sub.N for the various clutches CI, C2, C3, C4 of the<br>
hybrid transmission 10; and motor torque commands, T.sub.A.sub.--.sub.CMD and<br>
T.sub.B.sub.--.sub.CMD, for the electrical Motors A and B, respectively.<br>
The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to acquire data from a<br>
variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators, respectively, of the engine 14 over a<br>
plurality of discrete lines collectively shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives<br>
the engine torque<br><br>
command, T.sub.E.sub.^sub.CMD, from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque,<br>
T,sgb.AXLE.sub.-&gt;-rsu{3.QES, and an indication of actual engine torque, T.sub.E, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally having bir<br>
directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various other parameters that<br>
may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant temperature, engine input speed<br>
(N.sub,E) to a shaft leading to the transmission, manifold pressure, ambient air<br>
temperature, and ambient pressure. Various actuators that may be controlled by the, ECM<br>
23 include fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and functions to acquire data<br>
from a variety of sensors and provide command signals to the transmission. Inputs from<br>
the TCM 17 to the HCP § include estimated clutch torques, T.sub.CL.gub.-.sub.N.sub.-r<br>
, sub, EST, for each of the clutches CI, C2, C3, and, C4 and rotatipnal speed., N.sub.O, of<br>
the output shaft 64r Other actuators and sensors may be used to provide additional<br>
information from.the TCM to the HCP for control purposes.<br>
The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to monitor electrical<br>
current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide information about the state of the<br>
batteries to the HCP 5. Such information includes battery state-of-charge, Bat_S0C, and<br>
. other states of the batteries., including voltage, V.sub.BAT, and available power,<br>
P.sub.BAT.sub.-.,§ub.M!N and P,sub.BAT,sub.--.sub.MAX!<br>
The Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPJM) 19 include? a pair of power inverters<br>
and motor controllers configured to receive motor control comrnands and control inverter<br>
states therefrom to provide motor drive or regeneration functionality. The TPJM 19 is<br>
operable to generate torque<br><br>
commands for Motors A and B, T.subA.sub.--.sub.CMD and T.sub.J3.sub.--.sub.CMD,<br>
based upon input from the HCP 5, which is driven by operator input through Ul 13 and<br>
system operating parameters. The predetermined torque commands for Motors A and B,<br>
T.sub.A.sub.--.sub.CMD and T.sub-B.sub.~-.sub.CMD, are adjusted with motor damping<br>
torques, T,sub,A.sub.--.sub.DAMP and T.sub.B.sub.-.sub.DAMP, to determine motor<br>
torques, T.sub,A and T.siib.B, which are implemented by the control system, including<br>
the TPIM 19, to.control the Motors A and B. Individual motor speed signals, N.sub.A and<br>
Ksub.B for Motor A and Motor B respectively, are derived by the TPIM 19 from the<br>
motor phase information or conventional rotation sensors. The TPIM 19 determines and<br>
communicates motor speeds, N.sub.A and N.sub.B, to the HCP 5. The electrical energy<br>
storage device 74 is high-voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC lines 27. Electrical<br>
current is transferable to or from the TPIM 19 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is<br>
being charged or discharged,,<br>
Each of the aforementioned controllers is preferably a general-purpose digital computer<br>
generally comprising a microprocessor or central processing unit, read only memory<br>
(ROM), random acpess memory (RAM), electrically programwable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog (D/A) circuitry,<br>
and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate signal conditioning and<br>
buffer circuitry. Each controller has a set of control algorithms, comprising resident<br>
program instructions and calibrations stored in ROM and executed to provide the<br>
respective functions of each computer. Information transfer between the various<br>
computers is preferably accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br><br>
Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the controllers are typically<br>
executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at least once each<br>
loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of<br>
the central processing units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices<br>
and execute control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular intervals, for<br>
example each 3, 6.25, 15, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing engine and vehicle<br>
operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to occurrence of an<br>
event.<br>
In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the supervisory HCP<br>
controller 5 and one or more of the other controllers determine required transmission<br>
output torque, T.sub.O. Selectively operated components of the hybrid transmission 10<br>
are appropriately controlled and manipulated to respond to the operator demand. For<br>
example, in the exemplary embodiment shown in FIGS, 1 and 2, when the operator has<br>
selected a forward drive range and manipulates either the accelerator pedal or the brake<br>
pedal, the HCP 5 determines an output torque for the transmission, which affects how and<br>
when the vehicle accelerates, or decelerates. Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other<br>
factors, including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The HCP 5 monitors the<br>
parametric states of the torque-generatjve devices, and determines the output of the<br>
transmission required to arrive at the desired torque Output. Under the direction of the<br>
HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates over a range of output speeds from slow to fast in<br>
order to meet the operator demand.<br><br>
The tworniode, compounds-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission, includes output<br>
member 64 which receives output power through two distinct gear trains within the<br>
transmission 10, and operates in several transmission operating modes, described with<br>
reference	now	to	FIG.	1,	and	Table	1,	below.<br>
TABLE^US-00001 TABLE 1 .<br>
Transmission Operating Mode	Actuated Clutches<br>
Mode I	CI 70<br>
Fixed Ratio 1	CI 70 C4 75<br>
Fixed Ratio 2	CI 70 C2 62<br>
Mode II	C2 62<br>
Fixed Ratio 3	C2 62 C4 75<br>
Fixed Ratio 4	C2 62 C3 73<br>
The various transmission operating modes described in the table indicate which of the<br>
specific clutches CI, C2, C3, C4 are engaged or actuated for each of the operating modes.<br>
Additionally, in various transmission operating modes, Motor A 56 or Motor B 72 may<br>
each operate as electrical motors, designated as MA, MB respectively, and whether<br>
Motor A 56 is operating as a generator, designated as GA. A first mode, or gear train, is<br>
selected when the torque transfer device 70 is actuated in order to "ground" the outer gear<br>
member 46 of the third planetary gear set 28. A second.mode, or gear train, is selected<br>
when the torque transfer device 70 is released and the torque transfer device 62 is<br>
simultaneously actuated to connect the shaft 60 to<br><br>
the carrier 52 of the third planetary gear set 28. Other factors outside the scope of the<br>
invention affect when the electrical machines 56, 72 operate as motors and generators,<br>
and are not discussed herein.<br>
The control system, shown primarily in FIG. 2,. is operable to provide a range of<br>
•3	S<br>
. transmission output speeds, TM.sub.O, of shaft 64 from relatively slow to relatively fast<br>
within each mode of operation. The combination of two modes with a slow-to-fast output<br>
speed range in each mode allows the transmission 10 to propel a vehicle from a stationary<br>
condition to highway speeds, and meet various other requirements as previously<br>
described. Additionally, the control system coordinates operation of the transmission 10<br>
so as to allow synchronized shifts between the modes.<br>
The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in which the transmission<br>
functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e. either clutch CI 62 or C2 70, and by the<br>
controlled speed and torque of the motor/generators 56 and 72. Certain ranges of<br>
operation are described below in which fixed ratios are achieved by applying an<br>
additional clutch. This additional clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the<br>
table, above.<br>
When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio of inputrto-output speed of the<br>
transmission, i.e. "N.sub.I/N.sub.O, is achieved. The rotations of the motor/generators 56,<br>
72 are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching and<br>
proportional to the input speed, N.sub.l, determined or measured at shaft 12. The<br>
motor/generators function as motors or generators. They are completely independent of<br>
engine to output power flow, thereby enabling both to be motors, both to function as<br>
generators, or any combination thereof. This allows, for instance, during operation in<br>
Fixed Ratio<br><br>
1 that motive power output from the transmission at shaft 64 is provided.by power from<br>
the engine and power from Motors A and B, through planetary gear set 28 by accepting '<br>
power from the energy storage device 74.<br>
The transmission operating mode can be switched between Fixed Ratio operation and<br>
Mode operation by activating or deactivating one the additional clutches during Mode I<br>
or Mode II operation. Determination of operation in fixed ratio or mode control is by<br>
algorithms executed by the control system, and is outside the scope of this invention.<br>
The modes of.operation may overlap the ratio of operation, and selection depends again<br>
on the driver's input and response of the vehicle to that input. RANGE 1 falls primarily<br>
within mode I operation when clutches CI 70 and C4 75 are engaged. RANGE 2 falls<br>
within mode ! and mode II when clutches C2 62 and CI 70 are engaged. A third fixed<br>
ratio range is available primarily during mode 11 when.clutches C2 62 and C4 75 are<br>
engaged, and a fourth fixed ratio range is available during mode II when clutches C2 62<br>
and C3 73 are engaged. It is. notable that ranges of operation for Mode I and Mode II<br>
typically overlap significantly.<br>
Output of the exemplary powertrain system described hereinabove is constrained due to<br>
mechanical and system limitations. The output speed, N.sub.O, of the transmission<br>
measured at shaft 64 is limited due to limitations of engine output speed, N.sub.E,<br>
measured at shaft 18, and transmission input speed, N.sub.I, measured at shaft 12, and<br>
speed limitations of the electric Motors A and B, designated as +/- N.sub.A, +/- N.sub.B.<br>
Output torque, T.sub.O, of the transmission 64 is similarly limited due to limitations of<br>
the engine input torque, T.sub.E, and input torque, T.sub.I, measured at shaft 12 after the<br>
transient torque damper 20, and .<br><br>
torque limitations (T.sub.A.sub.-.sub.MAX, T.sub.A-sub.-.sub.MIN, T.sub.B.sub.^-<br>
.sub.MAX, T.sub.B.sub.-.sub.MI'N) of the Motors A and B S6, 72.<br>
The various equations and. operations described herein are preferably executed as<br>
. algorithms in one or more of the controllers described hereinabove with reference to FIG.<br>
2. In the present embodiment of the invention, it is an objective to determine a range of<br>
allowable operating points for Motor A 56 and Motor B 72. The allowable operating<br>
points are preferably described in terms of motor torques, T-sub.A and T.sub.B, of<br>
electrical transmission 10 operative to provide motive torque in the hybrid powertrain<br>
system.<br>
The invention comprises a method, stored and executed as one or more algorithms in one<br>
or more of the controllers of the control system, to determine a preferred operating range<br>
for the torque^generatjve devices, i,e. Motors A and B 56, 72, as executed in the<br>
exemplary system. The operation comprises defining a first operating range in a first<br>
operating space, and defining a second operating range in the first operating space. The<br>
first operating range and the second operating range are transformed to a second<br>
operating space, The preferred operating range is defined in the second operating space<br>
based upon the transformed first operating range and the transformed second operating<br>
range. The first operating range is preferably defined as a torque output of Motors A and<br>
B, and the second operating range is preferably defined as the electrical power output<br>
from the ESD in this embodiment. The first operating range and the second operating<br>
range are transformed to the second operating space, which is preferably in what is<br>
referred to as TX/TY space. The preferred operating range in the second operating space<br>
is based upon the transformed first operating range and the<br><br>
transformed second operating range. This is shown hereinafter, with reference now to<br>
FIG. 5 and the equations which follow.<br>
The first operating range is defined as a torque output range for the Motor A 56<br>
(T^ub.A.sub.-.sub.MAX, T.sub.A.sub,--.sub.MTN) and, a torque output range for the<br>
Motor B 72 (T.sub.B.sub.-.sub.MAX, T.sub.B.sub.-.sub.MlN). The first operating range<br>
thus comprises the torque operating range bounded by motor torque constraints<br>
T.sub.A.sub.*-,sub.MAX,	T.sub.A.sub.-.sub.MrN,	T.sub.B.sub.-.sub.MAX,<br>
T.sub.B.sub.-.sub.MIN. With reference to FIG. 3, the first operating space 110 is shown,<br>
wherein values T.sub.A.sub.—.sub.MAX 114, T.sub.A.sub.—.sub-MIN 112, T.sub.B.sub.-'<br>
-,sub.MAX 118, T.sub.B.sub.-.sub.MlW 116 are plotted.<br>
Minimum and maximum motor torques (T.sub.A.sub.^-.sub.MAX, T.sub.A.sub.-^<br>
.sub.MIN, T.sub.B.sub.-.sub.MAX, T.sub.B.sub.-r.sub.MIN) within the present<br>
capabilities of the motors are preferably obtained from data sets stored in table form<br>
within data structures in the control system. Such data sets are provided for reference by<br>
the routine in pre-stored table format having been empirically derived from conventional<br>
dynamometer testing of the combined motor and power electronics (e.g. power inverter)<br>
at various temperature and voltage conditions. An exemplary representation of such<br>
characteristic motor torque vs, speed data is illustrated in FIG. 4 wherein minimum and<br>
maximum data for a given speed are represented by the line of constant speed 132<br>
intersecting exemplary lines of constant temperature/voltage 131, 133. The tabulated data<br>
is referenced by the motor speeds (N.sub.A, "N.sub.B), voltage and temperature.<br>
While the motors are used in both motoring and generating modes—suggesting four-<br>
quadrants (identified as 1, 11, III, IV with reference to FIG. 4) of torque/speed data—two<br>
quadrant data collection is generally sufficient wherein the data collected in adjacent<br>
quadrants is merely reflected in the other quadrants not directly measured. In the present<br>
example, quadrants I and<br><br>
IV are shown with determined data 13! whereas quadrants III and IV are shown<br>
populated with data 133 reflected across the torque axis.<br>
Exemplary data for motor torques is shown. Motor A torque, T.sub.A, is plotted across<br>

Motor B torques (T.sub.B.sub.--.sub.MAX, T.sub.B,sub.--.sub.MIN). The enclosed space<br>

gained from the present description and figure, but are provided for appropriate context<br>
and to redupe the teaphing's abstraction,<br>
A second operating range, comprising a torque output range, shown as 120 with reference<br>
to FIG. 3, is determinable based upon constraints of the electrical energy storage system<br>
74. Calculation of battery power, P.sub.BAT is as follows, in Eq. 3:<br>
P.sub!BAT=P.sub.A,ELEC+P.sub.B,ELEC+P.sub.DC.sub.-.subXOAD[3]<br>

comprises electrical power from Motor B; and, P.sub.DC.sub.-*.sub,LOAD comprises<br>
known DC load, including accessory loads.<br><br>
Substituting equations for P.sub.A,ELEC and P.sub.B.ELEC, yields Eq. 4:<br>

Eq. 12 yields the transformation of motor torque, T.sub. A to TX and a transformation of motor<br>
torque T.sub, B to TY. The vector defined by TX/TY comprises battery power, P.sub.BAT.<br>
Therefore, maximum ap.d minimum battery power, P.sub.B AT.sub.-^sub.MAX, and<br>

various conditions, e.g. state of charge, temperature, voltage and usage (amp-hour/hour).<br>
The parameter C. above, is defined as the absolute minimum possible battery power at<br>
given speeds, N.sub.A, N.sub.B, ignoring motor torque limits.<br>
Torque values Ta and Tb are transformable to TX and TY, as in Eq. 13:<br>
##EQU000Q1##<br>
wherein TX is the transformation of T,sub.A; TY is the transformation of T.sub.B; and,<br>
A1, A2, Bl, B2 comprise scalar values.	'<br>
. The transformed vector [TX/TY] determined in Eq. 9 is solved simultaneously with the<br>
torque space identified by R.sub.MIN 122 and R,sub.MAX 124, to identify motor torques<br>
that are common to the first operating space and the second operating space, in TX/TY<br>
space. The outcome of the solution is shown with reference again to FIG. 3, wherein<br>
points A, B, C, D, and E represent the bounds for the common motor torques, in TX/TY<br>
space. The various point? are defined as;<br>

Because the equations are executed as algorithms'in TX/TY space, the execution time is<br>
v ■:<br>
effectively a single controller loop cycle, which can be in the range of 12 milliseconds or<br>
less.<br>
The resultant equations for common motor torques [TX/TY], defined by points A, B, C,<br>

follows in Eq, 14:<br>
##EQU00002##<br>
The control system is operable to control operation of the transmission system within the<br>
constraints of the range of operating points defined thusly. The algorithms constructed to<br>
implement the equations described hereinabove are preferably regularly executed during<br>
one of the aforementioned loop cycles to determine operating constraints of the electrical<br>
motors A and B.<br>
