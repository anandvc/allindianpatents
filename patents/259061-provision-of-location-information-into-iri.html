"PROVISION OF LOCATION INFORMATION INTO IRI"<br>
TELEFONAKTIEBOLAGET LM ERICSSON (publ), a   Swedish Company, of  SE-164 83 Stockholm, Sweden.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2006/011166<br><br>
PCMT2004/000418<br><br>
PROVISION OF LOCATION INFORMATION INTO IRI Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to methods and arrangements in a<br>
telecommunication  system to provide  geographical  location  information  into interception related information related to a mobile subscriber/equipment who/which is target for lawful interception. Background Art<br>
Three major trends currently occurs in telecommunication, i.e. 1) increasing amount of data traffic, 2) real-time communication goes from circuit switching to packet switching, and 3) new focus of real-time in packet switching, for example video and multimedia. The ever increasing amount of data traffic as well as real-time communication in packet switched networks has lead to a demand for monitoring of this data traffic with the same level of security and confidentiality as known from circuit switched networks monitoring.<br>
One kind of monitoring is lawful interception, i.e. the act of intercepting a communication on behalf of a law enforcement agency. Interception of Intercept Related Information IRI is known. Intercept Related Information is defined as signaling information related to target subscribers, for example call establishment. Interception of Content of Communication CC i.e. speech and data is also known. As an example, in Circuit Switching domain, the sending of IRI to a monitoring function is triggered by the following call-related and non-call related events:<br>
-	Call Establishment<br>
-	Answer<br>
-	Supplementary Service<br>
-	Handover<br>
-	Release<br>
-	SMS<br>
-	Location Update<br>
-	Subscriber/equipment Controlled Input<br>
Appropriate session related and session unrelated events trigger the sending of<br><br>
WO 2006/011166	PCT/TT2004/000418<br>
IRI to a monitoring function in case of Packet Switching communication.<br>
Beyond the demand for monitoring of IRI and CC, having location estimate in<br>
geographical form (latitude/longitude) in IRI is desired. The existing standardized<br>
location-based services architecture can be found in the 3GPP specifications TS <br>
5	23.271. According to the related Standard, a Gateway Mobile Positioning Center GMLC is the first node that an external location services LCS client requiring information, accesses in a mobile network. The GMLC requests routing information, handles positioning requests and forwards location estimates to the location services client. Mobile positioning enables an operator to provide location-based services to <br>
10   	   his customer. Position procedures that can be used to obtain the locatioestimare:<br>
-	Mobile Terminating Location Request, which is requested by a specific request<br>
sent from a Location Services client external to the network via a Gateway<br>
Mobile Location Center<br>
-	Mobile Originating Location Request, which is requested by the User Equipment<br>
15      -   Network Induced Location Request, which is triggered in case the User<br>
Equipment is performing an emergency call. Network Induced Location Request NI-LR is defined in the standards 3GPP TS 23.271 V6.7, see chapter 9.1.5.<br>
Location-based services are forecasted to soon be one of the most important sources of operator revenue. The position can be used to provide mobile subscribers <br>
2 0 	     with information and services that take advantage of the given geographical location. The location estimates can also be used for charging and billing.<br>
According to current Lawful Interception and Location Services LCS standards, it is not possible to get location estimate to be sent in the Intercept Related Information by using existing positioning procedures. The mentioned Network<br>
25	 Induced Location Request as defined in the standards is stated to be for emergency call only. The only way that the standard foresees for Law Enforcement Agency to get location information for a monitored subscriber/equipment is to use a Location Services client, which can trigger a location request. There will however be no timing correlation between the received location estimate and the sending of Interception<br>
30     Related Information for other events, i.e. it is not possible to fill Interception Related<br><br>
WO 2006/011166	PCT/IT2004/000418<br>
-4-<br>
Information for other events with location estimate required by the external LCS client. Moreover, in case the location request from the location services client is handled at a time in which there is no already established connection with the mobile subscriber/equipment, a paging procedure has to be initiated for lawful interception <br>
5	 purpose, which is against the service requirements for lawful interception. Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to problems how to fill lawful Interception Related Information with location estimate i.e. to correlate Interception Related Information with location estimate.<br>
10	The problems are solved by the invention by introducing an interaction<br>
between Lawful Interception and existing Network Induced Location Request and thereby upon registering an event that requires sending of Interception Related Information, initiating start of the Network Induced Location Request procedure that normally is used for emergency call .only.<br>
15	More in detail, the problems are solved by methods and arrangements in a<br>
mobile telecommunication system to generate interception related information that includes geographical location of a monitored mobile subscriber/equipment. The system is configured to provide to an Intercept configuration unit, information collected from an Intercept Access Point. The system is also configured to proceed<br>
20 with a Network Induced Location Request procedure. The method comprises the following steps:<br>
-	Receiving to the Intercept Access Point from the Intercept configuration unit, a<br>
request to monitor the mobile subscriber/equipment<br>
-	Detecting in the Intercept Access Point of a specified Interception Related<br>
2 5	Information IRI activity involving the monitored subscriber/equipment<br>
-	The Intercept Access Point initiates start of the Network Induced Location<br>
Request procedure.<br>
Advantages with the invention are:<br>
The invention provides operators and Lawful Interception Agencies a mechanism<br>
30	to provide/get accurate location information in the IRIs for each monitored<br><br>
WO 2006/011166	PCT/TT2004/000418<br>
5<br>
-subscriber/equipment. Interception Agencies would take advantage in having accurate location estimate of the monitored subscriber/equipment at the exact<br>
occurrence of events, such as call set-up without any delay or intrusive operations due to the use of an external Location Services client <br>
5      	-    Possibility to provide Lawful Interception Agencies with accurate location information using resources already allocated in the network and without traffic disturbance of additional signaling<br>
-   Positioning information will be obtained without any intrusive mechanism or disturbance over the transaction established by the target<br>
10      -   Positioning information will be obtained without any ad-hoc generated Location Services traffic.<br>
The invention will now be described more in detail with the aid of preferred<br>
embodiments in connection with the enclosed drawings.<br>

Ways of Carrying out the Invention<br>
Figure 1 discloses a Public Land Mobile Network PLMN1. The Network in this example is a GSM network and comprises a Gateway Mobile Location Center GMLC connected to a Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR. The MSC/VLR <br>
25 	includes a Visitor Location Register in which mobile subscribers that are visiting the MSC control area are registered. The Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR is connected to a Base Station Controller BSC that is connected to a Radio Base Station RBS. The RBS covers a radio cell CELL in which a mobile subscriber/equipment<br>
MSA is located. The Base Station Controller BSC controls a group of Radio Base<br>
30     Stations (only RBS is shown in the figure), and the Mobile Subscriber Center<br><br>
WO 2006/011166<br><br>
PCT7IT2004/000418<br><br>
-6' <br>
MSC/VLR controls a number of Base Station Controllers (only BSC is shown in the figure). The GMLC contains functionality required to support location services. The GMLC is the first node an external Location Services client accesses in the PLMN. In figure 1 a Location Services Client LCS is schematically shown as directly <br>
5 	connected to the GMLC. A Home Location Register HLR is connected to both the MSC/VLR and to the GMLC. The GMLC may request routing information to the mobile subscriber/equipment from the Home Location Register HLR, i.e. information about in which MSC/VLR the mobile is registered. An Intercept Configuration Unit ICU is connected to the MSC/VLR in this example. The ICU is<br>
10	 connected to the MSC/VLR which also is called an Intercept Access Point IAP, via three interfaces XI, X2 and X3. The ICU and the interfaces will be further explained in figure 2. In a Network Induced Location Request NI-LR procedure as defined in the standards and when applied to figure 1, the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA requests radio connection setup indicating a request (CM Service Request) for<br>
15 	emergency Service call to the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR via die Radio Access Network in which the mobile is located. The emergency call procedure is applied whereby the MSC/VLR initiates procedures to obtain the mobile/subscriber's location, and location information is sent to an Emergency Center.<br>
The Intercept Configuration Unit ICU is disclosed in figure 2. The ICU <br>
20	 comprises at least one Law Enforcement Agency LEA (three blocks representing different LEAs are shown in figure 2). Each LEA is connected to three Mediation Functions respectively for ADMF, DF2, DF3 i.e. an Administration Function ADMF and two Delivery Functions, a so-called second Delivery Function DF2 and third Delivery Function DF3. The Administration Function and the Delivery<br>
25	 Functions are each one connected to the Intercept Access Point IAP i.e. the MSC/VLR in the telecommunication network via the interfaces X1-X3. The ADMF is connected via the interface XI, DF2 is connected via X2 and DF3 is connected via X3. The Administration Function ADMF is together with the delivery functions used to hide from the network that there might be multiple<br>
30     activations by the different Law Enforcement Agencies. The messages sent from<br><br>
WO 2006/011166	PCT/IT2004/000418<br>
the ADMF to the network via the XI interface comprise identities of the subscriber/equipment that is to be monitored, i.e. target identities. The second Delivery Function DF2 receives Intercept Related Information IRI from the network and DF2 is used to distribute the IRI to relevant Law Enforcement <br>
5	Agencies. The third Delivery Function DF3 receives Content of Communication CC, i.e. speech and data, and is used to distribute the CC to relevant LEAs. DF3 is responsible for call control signaling and bearer transport for an intercepted product. Intercept Related Information IRI, received by DF2, which IRI also are called Events, are either call related or non-call related. Intercept Related <br>
10     Information IRI is defined as signaling information related to target subscribers.<br>
Call establishment is an example of a call related event and Location Update is an example of a non-call related event.<br>
Methods according to the invention will now be explained. The methods are<br>
used to add complementary location information in geographical terms (latitude,<br>
15      longitude) of the mobile subscriber/equipment, into Intercept Related Information<br>
IRI that has been generated after a request to monitor the mobile MSA from the<br>
Law Enforcement Agency.<br>
A method according to a first embodiment of the invention will now be explained more in detail. The explanation is to be read together with figure 1 and <br>
20      2. The method comprises the following steps:<br>
-	The Law Enforcement Agency LEA sends a request to the Administration<br>
Function ADMF to activate interception of the mobile subscriber/equipment<br>
MSA, i.e. to monitor MSA<br>
-	The ADMF forwards a target identity of the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA,<br>
25          to the Intercept Access Point IAP, i.e. to the Mobile Subscriber Center<br>
MSC/VLR<br>
-	A call establishment attempt is made from the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA<br>
via the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR. The call establishment attempt<br>
corresponds in the MSC/VLR to a specified Interception Related Information<br>
30	activity<br><br>
WO 2006/011166	PCT/IT2004/000418<br>
-	A Network Induced Location Request NI-LR is initiated by the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR, just as if CM Service Request for emergency Services had been received<br>
-	The MSC sends a Location Request to the Radio Access Network<br>
5      -   The MSC receives a Location Response from the Radio Access Network including location estimate of the monitored mobile subscriber/equipment MSA<br>
-	Upon receiving the location estimate, the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR<br>
includes the estimate into the Interception Related Information from the received<br>
IRI activity, i.e. the call establishment attempt, and forwards IRI + location<br>
10	estimate via the interface X2 to the second Delivery Function DF2. The IRI +<br>
location estimate is forwarded from DF2 to the to the Law Enforcement Agency LEA.<br>
	In the first embodiment there's no possibility to explicitly require getting<br>
              location information in the IRI, and/or specifying whether the location estimatis<br>
15      needed in the IRI or not. In the first embodiment all the IRI are considered to be<br>
          specified to include location estimate. In addition to the functionality described in the<br>
          first embodiment, i.e. the triggering of NI-LR by any Lawful Interception activity,<br>
          this level of activity foresees the possibility for the LEA/ADMF to explicitly require<br>
          the LAP to add the location estimate, if available, in specified IRI. This is obtained by<br>
20       enhancing the XI interface in a second embodiment. When the interception is<br>
        activated, the activation message will carry also an indication whether the accurate<br>
        location estimate (i.e. latitude, longitude and not only Cell Global Identity/Service<br>
              Area Identity) has to be included in IRI or hot. A method according to thsecond<br>
          embodiment of the invention comprises the following steps:<br>
25      -    The Law Enforcement Agency LEA sends a request to the Administration<br>
            Function ADMF to activate interception of the mobile subscriber/equipment<br>
          MSA, i.e. to monitor MSA<br>
-           The LEA requests location estimate to be included in the IRI. A specification of<br>
               at least one Interception Related Information activity that will initiate start of the<br>
30	Network Induced Location Request (NI-LR) procedure is hereby sent from the<br><br>
WO 2006/011166	PCT/IT2004/000418<br>
Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) to the ADMF. In this example, the two activities "call establishment" and "handover" have been selected<br>
-	The ADMF forwards a target identity of the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA,<br>
to the Intercept Access Point IAP,  i.e. to the Mobile Subscriber Center<br>
5	MSC/VLR. Request to provide location estimate, i.e. trigger NI-LR, for the two<br>
specified activities is also forwarded from the ADMF to MSC/VLR<br>
-	A call establishment attempt is made from the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA<br>
to the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR. The call establishment attempt<br>
corresponds to one of the specified Interception Related Information activities<br>
10      -   The Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR initiates a Network Induced Location Request NI-LR<br>
-	The MSC sends a Location Request to the Radio Access Network in which MSA<br>
is located<br>
-	The MSC receives a Location Response from the Radio Access Network<br>
15	including location estimate of the monitored mobile subscriber/equipment MSA<br>
-	Upon receiving the location estimate, the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR<br>
includes the estimate into the Interception Related Information from the received<br>
IRI activity and forwards IRI + location estimate via the interface X2 to the<br>
second Delivery Function DF2. The IRI + location estimate is forwarded from<br>
2 0	DF2 to the to the Law Enforcement Agency LEA.<br>
In case positioning procedures requires some time, depending on the positioning method used by the Radio Access Network, and if the sending of IRI cannot be delayed, the location estimate could be sent to the Law Enforcement Agency at a later stage, without delaying the sending of IRI. A solution to this is<br>
2 5 obtained by sending the IRI separated from the location estimate - thus avoiding any delay - and, as soon as the location estimate is available, send it in a Mobile Application Part MAP Subscriber Location report message to the Gateway Mobile Location Center GMLC indicated by the ADMF, as already done in case of NI-LR due to Emergency call. The following two steps will hereby replace the last method<br>
30     step in the above-described two embodiments:<br><br>
WO 2006/011166	PCT/TT2004/000418<br>
10<br>
-	Upon receiving the location estimate, the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR<br>
forwards IRI via the interface X2 to the second Delivery Function DF2. The IRI<br>
is forwarded from DF2 to the to the Law Enforcement Agency LEA<br>
-	The MSC/VLR sends the received location estimate in a Mobile Application Part<br>
5            MAP Subscriber Location report message to the Gateway Mobile Location<br>
Center GMLC indicated by the ADMF.<br>
Figure 3 discloses a flowchart in which some more important steps are shown. The flowchart is to be read together with the earlier shown figures. The flowchart comprises the following steps:<br>
10 - The Law Enforcement Agency LEA sends a request to activate interception of the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA, to the Intercept Access Point LAP. A block 101 discloses this step in figure 3<br>
-	A call establishment attempt is made from the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA<br>
via the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR. The attempt is considered in the<br>
15	MSC/VLR as an Interception Related Information activity. A block 102 discloses<br>
this step in figure 3<br>
-	A Network Induced Location Request NI-LR is initiated by the Mobile<br>
Subscriber Center MSC/VLR, just as if CM Service Request for emergency<br>
Services had been received. A block 103 discloses this step in figure 3<br>
20      -    Upon receiving location estimate from the Radio Access network, the Mobile<br>
Subscriber Center MSC/VLR includes the estimate into the Interception Related<br>
Information from the received IRI activity. The IRI + location estimate is<br>
forwarded to the to the Law Enforcement Agency LEA. A block 104 discloses<br>
this step in figure 3.<br>
25	Different variations are possible within the scope of the invention. As an<br>
alternative to the relative order of the above method steps different variations can be<br>
conceived.<br>
The invention is applicable in both circuit switched (connection oriented) and<br>
packet switched (connection less) networks. The disclosed GSM network/access in<br>
30     the described embodiments is just an example of a network/access that can be used.<br><br>
WO 2006/011166	PCT/IT2004/000418<br>
11.<br>
Other examples would be a 3G WCDMA network, IP Multimedia Subsystem and<br>
Wireless LAN access.<br>
