				<td>[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[ Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to the main switch of a vehicle.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
For the main switch of a vehicle, for example, Japanese published unexamined utility model application Sho54-5479, "Vehicle steering locking device" is known.<br>
Fig. 1 of the above utility model application is shown as Fig. 14 in this specification. However, reference numbers are different.<br>
Fig. 14 is a sectional view showing a conventional type vehicle steering locking device, a steering locking device 200 is provided with a switch box 201 in the lower part and provided with a switch member 203 turned together with a key 202 inside<br><br>
the switch box 201.<br>
The switch member 203 is provided with a moving contact plate 204 and fixed contact plates 206 and 207 respectively attached to an insulating plate 105 . These fixed contact plates 206 and 207 are fixed by riveting terminals 208 and 209. A reference number 211 denotes a coupler.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention] As force in the direction shown by an arrow operates upon the terminals 208 and 209 and this force is applied to each riveted portion of the fixed contact plates 206 and 207 when another coupler C provided with a female terminal is repeatedly inserted and extracted into/from the coupler 211 in the direction shown by the arrow, this portion is readily rattled.<br>
In such a case, to maintain electric connection respectively between terminals 208 and 209 and the fixed contact plates 206 and 207, for example there is a method in which a set of the terminal 208 and the fixed contact plate 206 and a set of the terminal 209 and the fixed contact plate 207 are respectively soldered, however, there is a problem that quality control for preventing the resin insulating plate 205 from being deformed or softened by heat generated in soldering is difficult.<br>
Further, there is a problem that the performance of assembly is deteriorated by a method of fixing by the above riveting and soldering because the terminals 208 and 209 and the fixed contact plates 206 and 207 are separate parts.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide the main switch of a vehicle in which a terminal and a fixed contact are integrated, which is readily fixed, the cost of which is reduced and which is hardly rattled.<br>
[ Means to Solve the Problems]<br>
To achieve the above object, according to Claim 1 of the present invention, a terminal pierces an insulating plate, a contact section is provided inside the insulating plate and a terminal section is provided outside the insulating plate.<br>
As the contact section and the terminal section can be integrated, the terminal can be readily assembled and the number of parts can be reduced.<br>
According to Claim 2, the terminal described in Claim 1 is fixed to the insulating plate by press fitting.<br>
The terminal can be readily and securely fixed to the insulating plate and is hardly rattled.<br>
According to Claim 3 , a band plate is used for the terminal section described in Claim 1 or 2 , this band plate is surrounded by a cover, the entry for a wiring coupler is provided to this cover and this entry is opposite to one side end face of the band plate.<br>
When a wiring coupler is inserted into the entry, force operates from the direction opposite to the side end face of the terminal section, however, as this force is supported in the direction of the width of the terminal section, the terminal section is hardly bent and can be prevented from being rattled.<br>
According to Claim 4 , a main switch comprises a lock external cylinder attached to the body, a crankshaft housed in this lock external cylinder, a lock pin deposited and withdrawn by this crankshaft, a moving member fitted to the lower part of the crankshaft so that the member can be attached or detached, a terminal which comes in contact with a moving contact attached to this moving member, sliding, an insulating plate for supporting this terminal, a cover for covering the lower part of the terminal which pierces this insulating plate, an entry for a wiring coupler provided to this cover and plural machine screws for fitting the cover and the insulating plate in the lock external cylinder, and the moving member is fitted to the crankshaft so that the moving member, the insulating plate and<br>
the cover can be turned by a predetermined angle in the direction of the rotation of the crankshaft together in a state in which these machine screws are unfastened and the moving member is detached from the crankshaft. <br>
The direction in which a wiring coupler is inserted can be varied depending upon a model by a set of a moving member, an insulating plate and a cover, the moving member, the insulating plate and the cover of the type corresponding to the direction of insertion are not required to be prepared and the costs for manufacturing and management can be reduced. <br>
According to Claim 5, a terminal pierces an insulating plate, a contact section is provided inside the insulating plate and a terminal section is provided outside the insulating plate. As the contact section and the terminal section can be integrated, the terminal can be readily attached, the number of parts can be reduced and the cost can be further reduced in addition to the reduction of the costs described in Claim 4 for manufacturing and management of various types of moving members , insulating plates and covers.<br>
According to Claim 6, a cover is constituted by an end section, an external wall section rising from the periphery of<br>
this end section, an internal wall section for covering the lower part of the terminal and an entry, and when the entry is turned downward, a drain hole for space between the internal and external wall sections is formed in the lower location.<br>
As a contact section and a terminal section can be integrated, a terminal can be readily attached, the number of parts can be reduced, water in space between the internal and external wall sections is discharged from the drain hole and the terminal is not damaged by water.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a main switch for a vehicle of the type that a wiring coupler is inserted onto a terminal of the main switch, wherein:<br>
said terminal pierces an insulating plate;<br>
a contact section is provided on a first side of said insulating   plate and<br>

The operation in the first embodiment of the main switch described above will be described below.<br>
Figs. 6 (a) and (b) are bottom views (the first embodiment) for explaining the connection of a wiring coupler to the main switch according to the present invention, Fig. 6 (a) shows a state before a wiring coupler is inserted and Fig. 6 (b) shows a state after a wiring coupler is inserted.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6 (a) , the wiring coupler 53 is provided with terminals 95 respectively connected to lead wires L lead from the body and each terminal 95 is provided with a grip 95a for respectively connecting to the first to third terminals 44<br>
to 46 of the main switch 18. A reference number 95b denotes a fitting portion for preventing the coupler 53 from falling by fitting to the fitted portion 48c provided to the cover 48 and reference characters Bl and B2 denote machine screws for attaching the insulating plate 43 and the cover 48 to the lock external cylinder 26. <br>
The cover 48 is provided with a drain hole 97 for discharging water in the cover 48.<br>
When the main switch 18 is attached to the body so that the entry 47 for the wiring coupler 53 is turned downward, the drain hole 97 is formed in the lower location in space between the internal wall section 48a and the external wall section 76 of the cover 48.<br>
Rainwater flowing between the internal wall section 48a and the external wall section 76 is discharged from this drain hole 97 by providing the drain hole 97 as described above and each terminal 44, 45 and 46 is prevented from being damaged by such rainwater. <br>
As shown in Fig. 6 (b), when the wiring coupler 53 is inserted into the entry 47 formed by the insulating plate 43 and the cover 48, the grip 95a of each terminal 95 is pressed outside respectively by the terminal sections 78, 84 and 87 of<br>
the first to third terminals 44 to 46 and elastically deformed, and each grip 95a is respectively connected to the terminal sections 78, 84 and 87 by return force by elastic deformation at this time.<br>
While the coupler is inserted, reaction force F by friction generated by return force by the above elastic deformation between each of the terminal sections 78, 84 and 87 and the grip 95a is generated as shown by arrows.<br>
In Fig. 3, reaction force F operates the terminal sections 78, 84 and 87 in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the drawing, however, as the first to third terminals 44 to 46 are respectively integrated and fixed by pressfitting, further the end of the terminal sections 78, 84 and 87 is respectively inserted into the grooves 71, 72 and 73 of the cover 48 and each terminal is respectively inserted opposite to the side end faces 78a, 84a and 87a of the terminal sections 78, 84 and 87 as shown in Fig. 6 (b), the terminals are securely fixed and hardly rattled.<br>
Fig. 7 is a sectional view viewed along a line 7-7 in Fig. 3 and the moving part 41 is provided with a boss section 41a formed in the center and a minus sign-shaped groove 41b on the upper surface of this boss section 4la.<br>
The moving part 41 is turned together with the crankshaft 32 by engaging the minus sign-shaped groove 41b with a minus sign-shaped end 32f formed at the lower end of the crankshaft 32. [0039]<br>
Fig. 8 is a sectional view viewed along a line 8-8 shown in Fig. 6 (a) and to attach the insulating plate 43 and the cover 49 to the lock external cylinder 26, first, the cylinder section 43a of the insulating plate 43 is fitted to the inside of the lock external cylinder 26.<br>
Next, the cover 48 is arranged outside the insulating plate 43 and the machine screws Bl and B2 are respectively inserted into the mounting holes 74 and 75 of the cover, the mounting holes 67 and 68 of the insulating plate 43 and the female screws 26b and 26c of the lock external cylinder 26 and fastened to fix the insulating plate 43 and the cover 48 to the lock external cylinder 26. Other fastening members such as screws and bolts can be used instead of machine screws Bl and B2. It is obvious that rivets can also be used as the fastening members because, once the main switch is suitably riveted to a specific vehicle, there is no need to remove the switch or to change the direction of the socket of the wiring coupler. Rivets can therefore be used instead of the machine screws if they are set to an angle suitable for a specific vehicle and mass-produced<br><br>
for the vehicles.<br>
Fig. 9 is a bottom view (the first embodiment) showing an example in which the direction of the entry for a wiring coupler according to the present invention is changed and the entry 47 of the wiring coupler 53 is turned by 180° based upon the entry shown in Fig. 6 (a).<br>
