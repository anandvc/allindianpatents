COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br><br>
       A                 POLYMERIZATION"<br><br>
PROCESS<br><br><br>
UNIVATION TECHNOLOGIES, LLC, a Delaware company, located at 5555 San Felipe, Suite 1950, Houston, Texas 77056, United States of America and MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, a Massachusetts corporation, located at 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
9-05-2005<br><br>
The present invention relates to method of polymerization.<br>
This invention relates to olefin polymerization catalysts containing a metal atom bound to at least two group 15 atoms and their use in gas or slurry phase to produce polyolefins.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
. The intense commercialization of metallocene polyolefin catalysts (metallocene being cyclopentadienyl based transition metal catalyst compounds) has led to widespread interest in the design of non-metallocene, homogeneous catalysts,. particularly for use in the economical gas and slurry phase processes. This field is more than an academic curiosity as new, non-metallocene catalysts in gas or slurry phase may provide an easier, more economical pathway to currently available products and may also provide product and process opportunities which are beyond the capability of metallocene catalysts in the gas or slurry phase.<br>
Anionic, multidentate heteroatom ligands have received the most attention in non-metallocene polyolefins catalysis. Notable classes of bidentate anionic ligands which form active polymerization catalysts include N-N" and N-O" ligand sets. Examples of these types of non-metallocene catalysts include amidopyridines (Kempe, R., "Arninopyridinato Ligands - New Directions and Limitations", 80 Canadian Society for Chemistry Meeting, Windsor, Ontario, Canada, June 1-4,1997.<br>
Kempe, R. et al, Inorg. Chem. 1996 vol 35 6742.) Likewise, recent reports by Jordan<br>
et al  of polyolefin catalysts based on  hydroxyquinolines  (Bei,X;Swenson,D .C;<br>
Jordan, R. F.; OrganometalUcs 1997,16, 3282) have been interesting even though the<br>
catalytic activities of Jordan"s hydroxyquinoline catalysts are low.<br>
Schrock et al in US 5, 889,128 discloses a process for the living<br>
polymerization of olefins in solution using initiators having a metal atom and a ligand<br>
having two group 15 atoms and a group 16 atom or three group 15 atoms. In<br>
particular, the solution phase polymerization of ethylene using<br>

{[NON]ZrMe}[MeB(C6F5)3] or {[NON]ZrMe(PhNMe2)]}[B(C6F5)4] is disclosed in examples 9 and 10.<br>
EP 893 454 Al discloses unsupported transition metal amide compounds used in combination with activators to polymerize olefins in the solution phase.<br>
Ethylenebis(salicylideneiminato)zirconium dichloride combined with methyl alumoxane deposited on a support and unsupported versions were used to polymerize ethylene by Repo et al in Macromolecules 1997, 30, 171-175.<br>
Thus there is a need in the art for gas or slurry phase processes to produce polyolefms using new and different supported catalyst systems.<br>

Polymerization Process of the Invention:<br>
The catalysts and catalyst systems described above are suitable for use in the polymerization process of the invention. The polymerization process of the invention includes a solution, gas or slurry process or a combination thereof, most preferably a gas or slurry phase process.<br><br>
In an embodiment, this invention is directed toward the slurry or gas phase polymerization or copolymerization reactions involving the polymerization of one or more monomers having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 2-12 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms. The invention is particularly well suited to the<br>
         copolymerization reactions involving the polymerization of one or more olefin<br>

Other monomers can include vinyl monomers, diolefins such as dienes, polyenes, norbornene, norbornadiene monomers. Preferably<br>
    |     a copolymer of ethylene is produced, where the comonomer is at least one alpha-<br>
olefin having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms and most preferably from 4 to 7 carbon atoms. In an alternate embodiment, the geminally disubstituted olefins disclosed in WO 98/37109 may be polymerized or copolymerized using the invention herein described.<br><br>
In another embodiment ethylene or propylene is polymerized with at least two different comonomers to form a terpolymer. The preferred comonomers are a combination of alpha-olefin monomers having 4 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably 4 to 8 carbon atoms, optionally with at least one diene monomer. The preferred<br>
      .   terpolymers include the combinations such as ethylene/butene-l/hexene-1,<br>
ethylene/propylene/butene-1, propylene/ethylene/hexene-1, ethylene/propylene/ norbornene and the like.<br><br><br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the process of the invention relates to the polymerization of ethylene and at least one comonomer having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably 4 to 7 carbon atoms. Particularly, the comonomers are butene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, hexene-1 and octene-1, the most preferred being hexene-1 and/or butene-1.<br>
Typically in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is employed where in one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by 10|     the heat of polymerization. This heat is removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fluidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containmg one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the 15|     fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. (See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 4,543,399, 4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,317,036, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, 5,436,304, 5,453,471, 5,462,999, 5,616,661 and 5,668,228 all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.) 20<br>
The reactor pressure in a gas phase process may vary from about 10 psig (69 kPa) to about 500 psig (3448 kPa), preferably in the range of from about 100 psig (690 kPa) to about 400 psig (2759 kPa), preferably in the range of from about 200 psig (1379 kPa) to about 400 psig (2759 kPa), more preferably in the range of from 24,     about 250 psig (1724 kPa) to about 350 psig (2414 kPa).<br>
The reactor temperature in the gas phase process may vary from about 30°C to about 120°C, preferably from about 60°C to about 115°C, more preferably in the range of from about 70°C to 110°C, and most preferably in the range of from about 70 3d     °C to about 95°C.<br><br><br><br>
The productivity of the catalyst or catalyst system is influenced by the main monomer partial pressure. The preferred mole percent of the main monomer, ethylene or propylene, preferably ethylene, is from about 25 to 90 mole percent and the monomer partial pressure is in the range of from about 75 psia (517 kPa) to about 300 psia (2069 kPa), which are typical conditions in a gas phase polymerization process.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the reactor utilized in the present invention and the process of the invention produce greater than 500 lbs of polymer per hour (227 Kg/hr) 10      to about 200,000 lbs/hr (90,900 Kg/hr) or higher of polymer, preferably greater than 1000 lbs/hr (455 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 10,000 lbs/hr (4540 Kg/hr), even more preferably greater than 25,000 lbs/hr (11,300 Kg/hr), still more preferably greater than 35,000 lbs/hr (15,900 Kg/hr), still even more preferably greater than 50,000 lbs/hr (22,700 Kg/hr) and most preferably greater than 65,000 lbs/hr (29,000 Kg/hr) to greater than 100,000 lbs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
Other gas phase processes contemplated by the process of the invention include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,627,242, 5,665,818 and 5,677,375, and European publications EP-A- 0 794 200, EP-A- 0 802 202 and EP-B- 634 421 all of 20      which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of from about 1 to about 50 atmospheres and even greater and temperatures in the range of 0° C to about 120°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate<br>
25     polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium<br>
30      is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above<br>
13<br><br><br>
the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.<br>
In one embodiment, a preferred polymerization technique of the invention is referred to as a particle form polymerization, or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes into solution. Such technique is well known in the art, and described in for instance U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179 which is fully incorporated herein by reference. The preferred temperature in the particle form process is within the range of about 185°F (85°C) to about 230°F<br>
10|     (110°C). Two preferred polymerization methods for the slurry process are those employing a loop reactor and those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes. Also, other examples of slurry processes are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,613,484, which is herein fully incorporated by<br>
15     reference.<br>
In another embodiment, the slurry process is carried out continuously in a loop reactor. The catalyst as a slurry in isobutane or as a dry free flowing powder is injected regularly to the reactor loop, which is itself filled with circulating slurry of<br>
20      growing polymer particles in a diluent of isobutane containing monomer and<br>
comonomer. Hydrogen, optionally, may be added as a molecular weight control. The reactor is maintained at pressure of about 525 psig to 625 psig (3620 kPa to 4309 kPa) and at a temperature in the range of about 140 °F to about 220 °F (about 60 °C to about 104 °C) depending on the desired polymer density. Reaction heat is removed<br>
25      through the loop wall since much of the reactor is in the form of a double-jacketed pipe. The slurry is allowed to exit the reactor at regular intervals or continuously to a heated low pressure flash~vessel,~rotary dryer and a nitrogen purge column in sequence for removal of the isobutane diluent and all unreacted monomer and comonomers. The resulting hydrocarbon free powder is then compounded for use in<br>
30     various applications.<br>

The catalyst and/or the activator may be placed on, deposited on, contacted with, incorporated within, adsorbded, or absorbed in a support. Typically the support can be of any of the solid, porous supports, including microporous supports. Typical support materials include talc; inorganic oxides such as silica, magnesium chloride, alumina, silica-alumina; polymeric supports such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, cross-linked polystyrene; and the like. Preferably the support is used in finely divided form.   Prior to use the support is preferably partially or completely dehydrated. The dehydration may be done physically by calcining or by chemically converting all or part of the active hydroxyls.   For more information on how to support catalysts please see US 4,808,561 which discloses how to support a metallocene catalyst system. The techniques used therein are generally applicable for this invention.<br><br>
