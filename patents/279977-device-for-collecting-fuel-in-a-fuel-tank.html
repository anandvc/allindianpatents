				<td>Description<br>
Device for collecting fuel in a fuel tank<br>
The invention relates to a device for collecting fuel in a fuel<br>
tank of a motor vehicle, having a surge pot, having a suction<br>
connection for a fuel pump and having a pre-filter which covers<br>
the suction connection.<br>
Devices of said type are often used in modern fuel tanks and<br>
are known from practice. The pre-filter is often designed as a<br>
component which is flat in its basic state and which nestles<br>
against the contours of the device in the mounted position. A<br>
fuel pump which is arranged in the surge pot sucks fuel through<br>
the pre-filter.<br>
A disadvantage of the known device is that the pre-filter is a<br>
component which must be mounted in a complex manner.<br>
Furthermore, the useful filter surface of the pre-filter is<br>
restricted by the nestling against the components of the<br>
device.<br>
The invention is based on the problem of refining a device of<br>
the type specified in the introduction in such a way that said<br>
device is particularly simple to assemble and that the pre-<br>
filter has a large filter surface.<br>
Said problem is achieved according to the invention in that the<br>
pre-filter is arranged within the surge pot and has a section<br>
which projects from a horizontal plane.<br>
By means of said design, the pre-filter is arranged in the<br>
surge pot and can therefore be pre-assembled with the latter.<br>
Said design also serves to prevent the pre-filter from nestling<br>
against other components of the device according to<br>
 <br>
the invention, and filter surface thereby being lost. The pre-<br>
filter therefore has a particularly large filter surface. One<br>
advantage of the arrangement of the pre-filter with a section<br>
which deviates from the horizontal plane is that dirt is rinsed<br>
from the pre-filter by slosning movements of the fuel. The<br>
influence of dirt on the useful filter surface of the pre-filter<br>
 is thereby kept low.<br>
The assembly of the device according to the invention is<br>
particularly cost-effective if the pre-filter is held with its<br>
edges on the wall of the surge pot. As a result of the edges of<br>
the pre-filter being held or the wall of the surge pot, the<br>
pre-filter is situated in its intended position throughout the<br>
further assembly of the surge pot with further components of a<br>
feed unit. The pre-filter is hereby prevented from nestling<br>
against adjacent components of the device according to the<br>
invention.<br>
According to another advantageous refinement of the invention,<br>
the production of the surge pot with the pre-filter is<br>
particularly cost-effective if the pre-filter is at least<br>
partially cohesively connected to the surge pot. In the<br>
simplest case, the pre-filter is an insert part which is<br>
inserted into an injection mold of the surge pot and which is<br>
cohesively connected to the surge pot during the injection-<br>
molding process.<br>
To reduce the number of components of the device according to<br>
the invention, it is expedient if the pre-filter and the surge<br>
pot are produced in one piece. By means of said design, the<br>
pre-filter is produced during the production of the surge pot.<br>
Opposing molds of the surge pot may have a multiplicity of<br>
individual contact points which, after the production of the<br>
surge pot, form the individual openings of the pre-filter.<br>
 <br>
The device according to the invention is of particularly<br>
compact design if the surge pot has a casing and if the pre-<br>
filter is connected to the casing.<br>
The device according to the invention is of particularly simple<br>
structural design if a collecting chamber is arranged between<br>
the pre-filter and a base plate which is sealingly connected to<br>
the casing, and if a suet on connection of the fuel pump<br>
protrudes into the collecting chamber.<br>
At least in the new state of the device according to the<br>
invention, the pre-filter las a particularly large filter<br>
surface if the pre-filter has a horizontal section.<br>
To further reduce the number of components to be assembled in<br>
the device according to the invention, it is expedient if the<br>
horizontal section and that section of the pre-filter which<br>
projects from the horizontal plane are produced in one piece.<br>
The section which projects from the horizontal plane could for<br>
example taper obliquely in the direction of the casing.<br>
However, according to another advantageous refinement of the<br>
invention, particularly reliable cleaning of the pre-filter by<br>
sloshing movements in the surge pot can be generated in a<br>
simple manner if the section which projects from the horizontal<br>
plane is arranged vertically in the surge pot.<br>
The invention permits numerous embodiments. To further<br>
illustrate the basic principle of the invention, two of said<br>
embodiments are illustrated in the drawing and described below.<br>
In the drawing:<br>
figure 1 shows a partial section through a device according to<br>
the invention for collecting fuel,<br>
 <br>
figure 2 shows a second partial section, which is offset in<br>
relation to the partial section from figure 1, of the<br>
device according to the invention,<br>
figure 3 shows a perspective illustration of a surge pot of<br>
the device according to the invention, with a pre-<br>
filter, in partial section, and<br>
figure 4 shows a further embodiment of the surge pot in a<br>
perspective illustration.<br>
Figure 1 shows a device for collecting fuel in a fuel tank of a<br>
motor vehicle and for feeding the collected fuel to an internal<br>
combustion engine (not illustrated) of the motor vehicle. The<br>
device has a fuel pump 2 which is driven by an electric motor<br>
and which is arranged in a surge pot 1, and a fine-mesh filter<br>
3. The fine-mesh filter 3 is likewise arranged in the surge pot<br>
1 and is connected by means of a fuel line 4 to the fuel pump<br>
2. Furthermore, the fine-mesh filter 3 has a connecting pipe 5<br>
for a feed line (not illustrated) which leads to the internal<br>
combustion engine of the motor vehicle. A line 7 (illustrated<br>
in figure 2) for a suction jet pump 8 is connected to a<br>
connection 6 of the fuel pump 2. The suction jet pump 8 sucks<br>
in fuel from the surroundings of the surge pot 1 and feeds said<br>
fuel into the surge pot 1. The surge pot 1 serves to collect<br>
the fuel and has a base plate 9 and a casing 10 which is<br>
sealingly connected to the base plate 9. A suction pipe 11 of<br>
the fuel pump 2 extends through a pre-filter 12 into a<br>
collecting chamber 13. The collecting chamber 13 is delimited<br>
by the base plate 9 and the pre-filter 12. Fuel flowing into<br>
the surge pot 1 passes via the pre-filter 12 into the<br>
collecting chamber 13 and therefore to the suction pipe 11 of<br>
the fuel pump 2. The fuel pump 2 can therefore suck in fuel<br>
from the surge pot 1 and feed said fuel via the fine-mesh<br>
filter 3 to the connecting pipe 5 for the feed line. The casing<br>
 <br>
10 of the surge pot 1 has an edge 15 which engages over a<br>
supporting edge 14 of the base plate 9. The edge 15 and the<br>
supporting edge 14 are sealingly connected to one another.<br>
Figure 3 shows the surge pot 1 from figure 1 in a partial<br>
section. It can be seen here that the pre-filter 12 has a<br>
horizontal section 16 and a section 17 which projects from the<br>
horizontal plane, and is cohesively connected to the casing 10<br>
of the surge pot 1. The pre-filter 12 is produced in one piece<br>
and is encapsulated, by injection molding, with plastic of the<br>
surge pot 1. That section 17 of the pre-filter 12 which<br>
projects from the horizontal plane is inclined with respect to<br>
the vertical.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further embodiment of the surge pot 1 which<br>
differs from that in figure 3 merely in that the pre-filter 12<br>
has a vertical section 18 which adjoins a horizontal section<br>
19.<br>
 <br>
