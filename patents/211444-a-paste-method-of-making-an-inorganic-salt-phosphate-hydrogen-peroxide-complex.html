Sterilization using hydrogen peroxide vapor has been shown to have some advantages over other chemical sterilization processes (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,169,123 and 4,169,124), and the combination of hydrogen peroxide with a plasma provides additional advantages, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. 4,643,876. In these disclosures the hydrogen peroxide vapor is generated from an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide, which ensures that there is moisture present in the system. These disclosures, together with those summarized in Table 1, teach that moisture is required for hydrogen peroxide in the vapor phase to be effective or to exhibit its maximum sporicidal activity. However, the use of aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide to generate hydrogen peroxide vapor for sterilization may cause problems. At higher pressures, such as atmospheric pressure, excess water in the system can cause condensation.<br>
Thus, one must reduce the relative humidity in a sterilization enclosure before introducing the aqueous hydrogen peroxide vapor.<br>
The sterilization of articles containing diffusion-restricted areas, such as long narrow lumens, presents a special challenge for hydrogen peroxide vapor that has been generated from an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide, because:<br>
1. Water has a higher vapor pressure than hydrogen peroxide and will vaporize faster than hydrogen peroxide from an aqueous solution.<br>
2. Water has a lower molecular weight than hydrogen peroxide and will diffuse faster than hydrogen peroxide in the vapor state.<br>
Because of this, when an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide is vaporized, the water reaches the items to be sterilized first and in higher concentration. The water vapor therefore restricts penetration of hydrogen peroxide vapor into diffusion restricted areas, such as small crevices and long narrow lumens. Removing water from the aqueous solution and using more concentrated hydrogen peroxide can be hazardous, due to the oxidizing nature of the solution.<br>
U.S. Patents 4,642,165 and 4,744,951 attempt to solve this problem. The former discloses metering small increments of a hydrogen peroxide solution onto a heated surface to ensure that each increment is vaporized before the next increment is added. Although this helps to eliminate the difference in the vapor.pressure and volatility between hydrogen peroxide and water, it does not address the fact that water diffuses faster than hydrogen peroxide in the vapor state.<br>
The latter patent describes a process for concentrating hydrogen peroxide from a relatively dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide and water and supplying the concentrated hydrogen peroxide in vapor form to a sterilization chamber. The process involves vaporizing a major portion of the water from the solution and removing the water vapor produced before injecting the concentrated hydrogen peroxide vapor into the sterilization chamber. The<br>
preferred range for the concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution is 50% to 80% by weight. This process has the disadvantage of working with solutions that are in the hazardous range; i.e., greater than 65% hydrogen peroxide, and also does not remove all of the water from the vapor state. Since water is still present in the solution, it will vaporize first, diffuse faster, and reach the items to be sterilized first. This effect will be especially pronounced in long narrow lumens.<br>
U.S. Pat. 4,943,414 discloses a process in which a vessel containing a small amount of a vaporizable liquid sterilant solution is attached to a lumen, and the sterilant vaporizes and flows directly into the lumen of the article as the pressure is reduced during the sterilization cycle. This system has the advantage that the water and hydrogen peroxide vapor are pulled through the lumen by the pressure differential that exists, increasing the sterilization rate for lumens, but it has the disadvantage that the vessel needs to be attached to each lumen to be sterilized. In addition, water is vaporized faster and precedes the hydrogen peroxide vapor into the lumen.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,106 discloses that a substantially anhydrous complex of PVP and H2O2 is useful for reducing the microbial content of surfaces. The complex, in the form of a fine white powder, is used to form antimicrobial solutions, gels, ointments, etc. It can also be applied to gauze, cotton swabs, sponges and the like. The H2O2 is released upon contact with water present on the surfaces containing the microbes. Thus, this method too requires the presence of moisture to effect sterilization.<br>
Certain inorganic hydrogen peroxide complexes have been reported including examples within the following classes: alkali metal and ammonium carbonates, alkali metal oxalates, alkali metal phosphates, alkali metal pyrophosphates, fluorides and hydroxides. U.S.S.R. patent document No. SU 1681860 (Nikolskaya et al.) discloses that surfaces can be decontaminated, although not necessarily sterilized, using ammonium fluoride peroxohydrate (NH4F*H2O2). However, this inorganic peroxide complex provides decontamination only within the very narrow temperature range of 70-86°C.<br>
Even within this range, decontamination times were quite long, requiring at least two hours. Additionally, it is known that ammonium fluoride decomposes to ammonia and hydrofluoric acid at temperatures above 40°C. Due to its toxicity and reactivity, hydrofluoric acid is undesirable in most sterilization systems. Moreover, Nikolskaya et al. disclose that despite the release of 90% of its hydrogen peroxide at 60°C, NH4F•H2O2 is ineffective at decontamination of surfaces at this temperature. Thus, it appears that a factor other than hydrogen peroxide is responsible for the decontamination noted.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide is capable of forming complexes with both organic and inorganic compounds. The binding in these complexes is attributed to \ hydrogen bonding between electron rich functional groups in the complexing compound and the peroxide hydrogen. The complexes have been used in commercial and industrial applications such as bleaching agents, disinfectants, sterilizing agents, oxidizing reagents in organic synthesis, and catalysts for free-radical-induced polymerization reactions.<br>
Generally, these types of compounds have been prepared by the crystallization of the complex from an aqueous solution. For example, urea hydrogen peroxide complex was prepared by Lu et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 63(1): 1507-1513 (1941)) in the liquid phase by adding a solution of urea to a solution of hydrogen peroxide and allowing the complex to crystallize under the proper conditions. U.S. Pat. No. 2,986,448 describes the preparation of sodium carbonate hydrogen peroxide complex by treating a saturated aqueous solution of Na2CO3 with a solution of 50 to 90% H2O2 in a closed cyclic system at 0 to 5°C for 4 to 12 hours. More recently, U.S. Pat No. 3,870,783 discloses the preparation of sodium carbonate hydrogen peroxide complex by reacting aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide and sodium carbonate in a batch or continuous crystallizer. The crystals are separated by filtration or centrifugation and the liquors used to produce more sodium carbonate solution. Titova et al. (Zhumal Neorg. Khim., 30:2222-2227, 1985) describe the synthesis of potassium carbonate peroxyhydrate (K2CO3-3H2O2) by reaction of solid potassium carbonate with an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide at low<br>
temperature followed by crystallization of the complex from ethanol. These methods work well for peroxide complexes that form stable, crystalline free-flowing products from aqueous solution.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,376,110 and 3,480,557 disclose the preparation of a complex of hydrogen peroxide with a polymeric N-vinylheterocyclic compound (PVP) from aqueous solution. The resultant complexes contained variable amounts of hydrogen peroxide and substantial amounts of water. U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,093 teaches that free-flowing, stable, substantially anhydrous complexes of PVP and H2O2 could be obtained by reacting a suspension of PVP and a solution of H2O2 in an anhydrous organic solvent like ethyl acetate. More recently, U.S. Pat. No. 5,077,047 describes a commercial process for producing the PVP-hydrogen peroxide product by adding finely divided droplets of a 30% to 80% by weight aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide to a fluidized bed of PVP maintained at a temperature of ambient to 60°C. The resultant product was found to be a stable, substantially anhydrous, free flowing powder with a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 15 to 24%.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,030,380 describes the preparation of a solid polymeric electrolytic complex with hydrogen peroxide by first forming a complex in aqueous solution and then drying the reaction product under vacuum or by spray drying at a low enough temperature to avoid thermal degradation of the product.<br>
Titova et al. (Russ. J. Inorg. Chem., 40:384-387, 1995) formed a Na4P2O7-3H2O2 complex by mixing Na4P2O7•10 H2O with a 30-90% H2O2 solution followed by vacuum drying. The complex was observed to partially decompose under isothermic exposure for two hours at 120°C and 140°C.<br>
All of these previous methods of preparing hydrogen peroxide complexes use solutions of hydrogen peroxide. Either the complex is formed in a solution containing hydrogen peroxide or droplets of a hydrogen peroxide solution are sprayed onto a fluidized bed of the reactant material.<br>
Vapor phase and gas phase reactions are well known synthesis methods. For example, U.S. Pat No. 2,812,244 discloses a solid-gas process<br>
for dehydrogenation, thermal cracking, and demethanation. Fujimoto et al. (J. Catalysis, 133:370-382 (1992)) described a vapor-phase carboxylation of methanol. Zellers et al. (Anal. Chem., 62:1222-1227 (1990)) discussed the reaction of styrene vapor with a square-plannar organoplatinum complex. These prior art vapor- and gas-phase reactions, however, were not used to form hydrogen peroxide complexes.<br>

This application contains certain disclosure from Applicants" co-pending Application No. 08/549,425, filed October 27, 1995, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide sterilizers that have been used in the past invariably used an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide as their source of sterilant. These sterilizers have disadvantages caused by the presence of water in the system. At higher pressure, such as atmospheric pressure, the excess water in the system can cause condensation. This requires that an extra step be performed to reduce the relative humidity of the atmosphere in an enclosure to be sterilized to an acceptable level before the aqueous hydrogen peroxide vapor is introduced. These sterilizers also have drawbacks caused by the facts that water, having a higher vapor pressure, vaporizes more quickly than hydrogen peroxide from an aqueous solution; and water, having a lower molecular weight, diffuses faster than hydrogen peroxide. When a medical device or the like is enclosed in a sterilizer, the initial sterilant that reaches the device from the hydrogen peroxide source is diluted in comparison to the concentration of the source. The dilute sterilant can be a barrier to sterilant that arrives later, particularly if the device being sterilized is an article, such as an endoscope, that has narrow lumens. Using a concentrated solution of hydrogen peroxide as the source in an attempt to overcome these drawbacks is unsatisfactory, because such solutions are hazardous.<br>
In the present invention, the shortcomings of hydrogen peroxide sterilizers of the prior art are overcome by using a substantially non-aqueous (i.e., substantially anhydrous) source of hydrogen peroxide which releases a substantially non-aqueous hydrogen peroxide vapor. In a preferred embodiment, the substantially non-aqueous hydrogen peroxide vapor is produced directly from a substantially nonaqueous hydrogen peroxide complex. However, the substantially non-aqueous hydrogen peroxide vapor can also be generated from an aqueous complex which is processed during vaporization to remove water, such as under vacuum. Thus, where an aqueous hydrogen peroxide complex is used, the aqueous complex can be converted to a substantially non-aqueous hydrogen peroxide complex while carrying out the process of the present invention. Preferably, the substantially non-aqueous hydrogen peroxide complexes contain less than about 20% water, more<br>
preferably no more than about 10% water, stilt more preferably no more than about 5% water, and most preferably no more than about 2% water.<br>
As is apparent from the preferred percentages of water in the substantially non-aqueous hydrogen peroxide complexes used in the present invention, as provided above, the most preferred hydrogen peroxide complex and the peroxide vapor generated therefrom are substantially water-free. Nevertheless, as is also apparent from these figures, some water can be present in the system. Some of this water may derive from the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to form water and oxygen as byproducts and some hydrogen binding of this water to the complex can occur.<br>
The effect of water was measured in a series of tests, with a sterilization chamber maintained at various relative humidities. Test conditions were those . described in Example 1, below, with spores supported on stainless steel (SS) blades in 3mm x 50cm stainless steel lumens. As shown in Table 2, under the test conditions, 5% relative humidity has no effect on efficacy but 10% relative humidity decreases the sterilization rate. This example shows that small amounts of moisture can be allowed in the system with the hydrogen peroxide generated from the non-aqueous peroxide complex and the presence of water in the system can be overcome by increasing the exposure time.<br>
Table 2<br>
A primary criterion for the composition of the hydrogen peroxide source is the relationship between its stability and hydrogen peroxide evaporation rate as a function of temperature and pressure. Depending on the parameters of the sterilization process—e.g. pressure, temperature, etc.—a higher or lower peroxide evaporation rate may be preferred, and heating the peroxide source may or may not be required. The need for heating of the peroxide complex depends on the vapor pressure of the complex. Some peroxide complexes have a sufficiently high vapor pressure that a significant amount of hydrogen peroxide vapor can be released without heating the complex. In general, heating the complex increases the vapor pressure of hydrogen peroxide and accelerates the release of peroxide from the complex.<br>
To provide a desirably high evaporation rate, the source should preferably have a large surface area. Thus the source may be a fine powder or a coating on a material that has a large surface area. Of course, safety, availability, and cost of the material are also important criteria. The release of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen peroxide complexes with urea, polyvinylpyrrolidone, nylon-6, glycine anhydride, and 1,3 dimethyl urea were evaluated. The complexes of hydrogen peroxide with urea, polyvinylpyrrolidone, nylon-6, and glycine anhydride are solids. The 1,3 dimethyl urea peroxide complex is a liquid. The glycine anhydride hydrogen peroxide complex is a less stable complex under reduced pressure than the other complexes evaluated, and under vacuum conditions, most of the hydrogen peroxide can be released from the complex without the need for additional heating.<br>
Urea hydrogen peroxide complex is available in tablet form from Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, NY and in powder form from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wl. This complex is also known as urea peroxide, hydrogen peroxide urea complex, peroxide urea, peroxide urea adduct, urea peroxide adduct, percarbaride, carbamide perydrate, and carbamide peroxide. As used herein, the term "urea peroxide" encompasses all of the foregoing terms.<br>
The polyvinylpyrrolidone-hydrogen peroxide complex (PVP-H2O2) can be prepared by the method disclosed in International Application Pub. No. WO 92/17158. Alternatively, the complexes with PVP. with nylon-6, with 1,3 dimethylurea and with glycine anhydride, as well as with other organic and inorganic compounds can be prepared by the method disclosed in detail below.<br>
Achieving suitable evaporation rates of anhydrous peroxide vapor from the source may be facilitated by elevated temperatures and/or reduced pressure. Thus, a heater for the peroxide source and/or a vacuum pump to evacuate the sterilization chamber are preferably a part of the sterilizer. Preferably, the source is covered with a layer of gas permeable material, such as TYVEK™ nonwoven polyethylene fabric, nonwoven polypropylene such as SPUNGUARD1", or similar material, which permits the peroxide vapor to pass but not the peroxide complexing material. Perforated aluminum or other suitable perforated material could also be used as a cover.<br>
FIGURE 3A shows a device 80 that can be used to measure release of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen peroxide complexes under various temperature conditions, in this device, an aluminum pan 90 is covered with a gas permeable layer 92, such as a layer of medical grade TYVEK". The pan 90 is placed on top of a heating pad 94 which is placed in a pyrex pan 96. A thermocouple thermometer 98 is placed on the outside of the pan 90 approximately 1 cm from the bottom thereof. In a preferred embodiment, aluminum pan 90 is open to the atmosphere to allow greater release of the postassium oxalate hydrogen peroxide complex at atmospheric pressure.<br>
A preferred container 99 for holding the peroxide source is illustrated in FIGURE 3B. The container 99 comprises a metal plate 100, e.g. an aluminum plate, with an optional attached heater used to heat the solid peroxide complex. A temperature monitor 101, such as a thermometer, can be placed on the plate 100 to monitor the temperature. The peroxide complex is placed directly on the plate 100. Alternatively, in order to provide even heating of all the peroxide complex, the peroxide complex can be placed between one or more aluminum screens 102,104 placed on top of the plate 100. The aluminum screens 102,<br>
104 provide greater surface area and even heating of the complex when larger amounts of peroxide complex are being used. The peroxide complex, or the screen or screens 102,104, are then covered with a gas permeable layer 106, such as a layer of medical grade TYVEK" or SPUNGUARD*", so that the hydrogen peroxide released from the complex passes through the covering 106 before diffusing into the rest of the chamber. A perforated aluminum plate 108 is optionally placed on top of the TYYEKTM or SPUNGUARD™ layer 106 to provide pressure to keep the complex in contact with the heated plate 100 and to ensure even heating of the peroxide complex.<br>
The device just described provides even heating of the complex, which results in an increased amount of hydrogen peroxide vapor being released from the peroxide complex.<br>
FIGURE 1 depicts a schematic of a hydrogen peroxide vapor sterilization apparatus of the present invention. Chamber 10 holds an article 12 which is to be sterilized and which, for convenience, is placed on shelf 14. Door 16 provides access to the interior of chamber 10. A non-aqueous source of hydrogen peroxide 18 is depicted on optional heater 20, which is controlled by temperature controller 22. The peroxide concentration can be monitored by optional monitor 24. If desired, chamber 10 can be evacuated using pump 26; however, sterilization can also be accomplished at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The container that holds the articles to be sterilized can be a conventional sterilization chamber, which is evacuated, or it can be a container (or a room) at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The time required to sterilize the articles depends on the nature, number and packaging of the articles and their placement in the chamber. Alternatively, it may be the chamber itself (or an entire room) that is being sterilized. In any case, optimum sterilization times can be determined empirically.<br>
The use of pressure pulsing to enhance the penetration and antimicrobial activity of sterilant gases, which is well known in the sterilization art, can also be applied to the non-aqueous hydrogen peroxide process. One exemplary<br>
process of pressure pulsing, which can be adapted for use in connection with the methods and apparatuses described herein, is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,527,508, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. As described in additional detail hereinbelow, plasma can also be used to further enhance activity and/or to remove residuals.<br>
At the conclusion of the sterilization process excess hydrogen peroxide can be removed from devices that have an affinity for peroxide by exchanging the air in contact with the devices. This can be accomplished by flowing warm air over the devices for an extended time or by evacuating the chamber.<br>
Articles that have previously been sterilized by exposure to hydrogen peroxide vapor may also be exposed to the plasma to remove residual hydrogen peroxide that may remain on the articles. Since the hydrogen peroxide is decomposed into non-toxic products during the plasma treatment, the sterilized articles may be used without the need for any additional steps.<br>
It may be desirable to isolate the peroxide source from the sterilizer after the peroxide vapor is released to avoid reabsorption of the vapor or,, when a plasma is used, to avoid exposing the source to the plasma. Isolation is also advantageous when the complex used is not stable under vacuum. Isolation can be accomplished using valves or other isolating devices well known in the art.<br>
FIGURE 2 depicts a schematic of a hydrogen peroxide plasma sterilization system of the present invention. Sterilization can be achieved with or without the use of plasma. The plasma can be used to enhance the sporicidal activity of the peroxide vapor, and/or to remove any residual hydrogen peroxide remaining on the sterilized articles.<br>
Sterilization is carried out in chamber 30, which includes a door or opening 32 through which articles to be sterilized can be introduced. The chamber 30 includes an outlet 34 to a vacuum pump 36, through which the chamber can be evacuated. The outlet 34 contains a valve 38 to isolate the chamber from the vacuum pump 36. The chamber 30 also includes an inlet 40 attached to an enclosure 42 that contains the hydrogen peroxide complex. Inlet<br>
40 contains a valve 44 that allows enclosure 42 to be isolated from the chamber. The sterilization system also contains an inlet 41 which connects the enclosure 42 and the vacuum pump 36, which contains a valve 43. This system allows the simultaneous evacuation of both enclosure 42 and chamber 30, or the independent evacuation of either enclosure 42 or chamber 30. Evacuation is controlled by the opening and closing of the valves 38, 44, and 43. As will be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art, two pumps, one for each chamber, could also be employed in this system.<br>
The enclosure 42 contains an optional heater 49 attached to a temperature controller 46 to control the temperature of the hydrogen peroxide complex. The hydrogen peroxide complex concentration in the vapor state can be monitored by an optional peroxide monitor 48. The interior of the chamber contains a radio frequency (RF) electrode 50, to which is attached a matching network 52 and an RF power supply 54. A convenient form for the electrode is a perforated cylinder, surrounding the samples and open at both end. The general operation of the present process is as follows:<br>
1. The articles 56 to be sterilized are placed in the chamber 30.<br>
2. The chamber 30 may be at atmospheric pressure or, alternatively, may be evacuated to facilitate penetration of the hydrogen peroxide. Evacuation is accomplished by opening valve 38 and turning on vacuum pump 36. Alternatively, both the chamber 30 and the enclosure 42 may be evacuated by opening valves 38 and 44, and/or 43.<br>
3. The valves 38 and 43 are closed to isolate the vacuum pump 36 from the chamber 30 and enclosure 42, and the valve 44 is opened. Hydrogen peroxide vapor is delivered into chamber 30 from the hydrogen peroxide source, which may be heated to facilitate the release of the hydrogen peroxide vapor. Optionally, air or an inert gas may also be added.<br>
4. The articles 56 to be sterilized are either treated with peroxide vapor until sterilized or pretreated with peroxide vapor in the chamber 30 before plasma with sufficient power to sterilize is generated. If necessary, chamber 30 may be evacuated at this time to facilitate generation of the plasma. The<br>
duration of the pre-plasma holding period depends on the type of package used, the nature and number of items to be sterilized, and the placement of the items in the chamber. Optimum times can be determined empirically.<br>
5. The articles 56 are subjected to a plasma by applying power from the RF power supply 54 to the RF electrode 50. The RF energy used to generate the plasma may be pulsed or continuous. The articles 56 remain in the plasma for a period to effect complete sterilization and/or to remove residual hydrogen peroxide. In certain embodiments, 5 to 30 minutes of plasma is used. However, optimum times can be determined empirically.<br>
When used in the present specification and claims, the term "plasma" is intended to include any portion of the gas or vapor that contains electrons, ions, free radicals, dissociated and/or excited atoms or molecules produced as a result of an applied electric field, including any accompanying radiation that might be produced. The applied field may cover a broad frequency range; however, a radio frequency or microwaves are commonly used.<br>
The non-aqueous hydrogen peroxide delivery system disclosed in the present invention can also be used with plasmas generated by the method disclosed in the previously mentioned U.S. Pat. 4,643,876. Alternatively, it may be used with plasmas described in U.S. Patent 5,115,166 or 5,087,418, in which the article to be sterilized is located in a chamber that is separated from the plasma source.<br>
The device just described is particularly advantageous when using peroxide complexes that are not stable under vacuum. There are at least two possible methods that can be used to minimize the loss of hydrogen peroxide during the vacuum stage. First, the small chamber can be evacuated independently. Second, if a small enough chamber is used, there is no need to evacuate the small chamber at all.<br>
One such unstable non-aqueous peroxide complex is glycine anhydride-peroxide. This compound releases hydrogen peroxide vapor when placed under vacuum. FIGURE 4 is a graph illustrating the release of hydrogen peroxide vapor from glycine anhydride-peroxide complex under vacuum. The<br>
procedure used to release the hydrogen peroxide from the glycine anhydride complex is as follows: (1) The main chamber 30 was evacuated with valves 43 and 44 closed. (2) The chamber containing the hydrogen peroxide complex<br>
42 was evacuated with valves 38 and 44 closed and valve 43 open. (3) Valve<br>
43 was closed and valve 44 was opened and hydrogen peroxide vapor was allowed to diffuse into chamber 30.<br>
As shown by the graph, hydrogen peroxide vapor is released from the complex as the pressure is reduced, even without additional heating. As illustrated in FIGURE 4, release of peroxide vapor is significantly increased by heating the complex to a higher temperature. Thus, even unstable peroxide complexes are useful in the sterilization method of the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides at least four advantages over earlier hydrogen peroxide sterilization systems:<br>
1. The use of concentrated, potentially hazardous hydrogen peroxide solutions is circumvented.<br>
2. The need to reduce beforehand the relative humidity of areas to be sterilized in order to prevent condensation is eliminated.<br>
3. Water is substantially eliminated from the system, so that there is little competition between water and hydrogen peroxide for diffusion into long narrow lumens.<br>
4. The need to attach a special vessel to deliver sterilant gases into long narrow lumens can often be eliminated.<br>
That sterilization can be effected using hydrogen peroxide vapor in the substantial absence of moisture is one of the surprising discoveries of the present invention. The prior art teaches that the presence of water is required to achieve sterilization in chemical gas or vapor state sterilization processes. Advantageously, the present invention substantially eliminates water from the system, which results in faster, more efficient and effective sterilization.<br>
The sterilization efficacy of various non-aqueous hydrogen peroxide complexes was determined as described below in Examples 1-4.<br>
Example 1<br>
Efficacy data was obtained with hydrogen peroxide vapor released from substantially anhydrous urea peroxide complex using Bacillus subtilis var. (niger) spores in metal and TEFLON1" plastic lumens as the biological challenge. A. Test Procedures<br>
1. Equipment<br>
Four grams of crushed hydrogen peroxide urea adduct tablet (Fluka Chemical Corp, Ronkonkoma, NY) were placed in an aluminum pan 90, as described in FIGURE 3A. The top of the pan 90 was covered with medical grade TYYEK1" 92 (a breathable spunbond polyethylene fabric) so that any hydrogen peroxide released from the complex would need to pass through the TYVEK™ covering before diffusing into the rest of the chamber. The aluminum pan 90 was placed on a heating pad 94 in a pyrex dish 96 located in the bottom of an aluminum sterilization chamber (see FIGURE 1). The sterilization chamber, which had an approximate volume of 173 liters, also contained:<br>
A hydrogen peroxide monitor for measuring hydrogen peroxide<br>
concentration in the vapor phase.<br>
A temperature controller for controlling the temperature of the heating<br>
pad.<br>
• An injection port through which liquid hydrogen peroxide could be injected into the chamber.<br>
• A metal shelf on which a plastic tray containing lumen devices were placed for testing.<br>
Electrical resistance heaters on the exterior of the chamber walls, which maintained the chamber temperature at 45°C during the efficacy testings.<br>
2. Biological Challenge and Test<br>
To evaluate the efficacy of the non-aqueous peroxide delivery system, a biological challenge consisting of 1.04 x 10* B. subtilis var. (niger) spores on a stainless steel scalpel blade was placed equally distant from each end of the<br>
stainless steel lumens of dimensions 3mm 10 x 40cm length, 3mm ID x 50cm length, and 1mm ID x 50cm length. These ID"s and lengths are typical for metal lumens used in medical devices. The compartment in the middle of each lumen that contained the biological test piece had the dimensions 13mm ID x 7.6cm length. In the biological testing with metal lumens, a total of 9 lumens were evaluated per test. These included 3 lumens from each of the 3 different sets of ID"s and lengths available.<br>
Similar tests were conducted with a biological challenge consisting of 4.1 x 105 B. subtilis var. (niger) spores on a paper strip (6mm x 4mm Whatman #1 chromatography paper) located equally distant from the ends of TEFLON1" lumens of dimensions 1mm ID x 1 meter length, 1mm ID x 2 meter length, 1mm ID x 3 meter length, and 1mm ID x 4 meter length. The center compartment of these lumens that contained the biological test piece had the dimensions 15mm ID x 7.6cm length. In the biological testing with TEFLON1" lumens, a total of 12 lumens were evaluated per test 3 lumens from each of the 4 different lengths available.<br>
The lumens containing the biological test samples were placed in a plastic tray that was then placed on the shelf in the sterilization chamber. The chamber door was then closed and the chamber evacuated to 0.2 Ton-pressure with a vacuum pump. The aluminum pan containing the hydrogen peroxide urea adduct was then heated to 80 to 81 °C for a period of 5 minutes, as measured by a thermocouple thermometer placed on the side wall of the aluminum pan approximately 1 cm from the bottom of the pan. During this time the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the chamber increased to 6mg/L as measured by the peroxide monitor.<br>
The biological test samples were exposed to the hydrogen peroxide vapor for periods of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 minutes. After exposure to the hydrogen peroxide vapor, the biological test samples were aseptically transferred into 15mL of trypticase soy broth containing 277 units of catalase to neutralize any hydrogen peroxide residuals that may remain on the test<br>
samples. All samples were incubated for 7 days at 32°C and observed for growth.<br>
Comparative studies were also conducted in which a 50% aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide was injected into the sterilization chamber and vaporized from a heated injector (a heated metal surface). The volume of hydrogen peroxide solution injected produced a vapor phase concentration of hydrogen peroxide of 6mg/L. The test lumens and biological test samples used in these tests were identical to those used in the non-aqueous hydrogen peroxide tests. The handling of the biological test samples after exposure to the hydrogen peroxide was also identical. B. Test Results<br>
The results of these tests with stainless steel and TEFLON1" lumens, which are presented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively, illustrate the advantages of the non-aqueous peroxide delivery system with both metal and non-metal lumens. Total kill of the bacterial spores was achieved within 5 minutes with the non-aqueous peroxide delivery system for the smallest ID and the longest lumens evaluated. At the same time, total kill was not achieved even after 25 minutes of diffusion time with the 50% hydrogen peroxide solution.<br>
The fact that rapid sterilization can be accomplished in the absence of substantial amounts of water is surprising, in light of the fact that moisture has generally been present during chemical gas/vapor phase sterilization by various sterilants other than hydrogen peroxide. Since vapor phase hydrogen peroxide sterilization systems have used aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide, there has been moisture present in those systems as well.<br>
To test the sterilization efficacy of various other peroxide complexes, the following experiments were performed.<br>
Examples 2. 3 and 4<br>
The apparatus of Example 1 was used to test the efficacy of polyvinylpyrrolidone-hydrogen peroxide complex (Example 2), nylon 6-hydrogen peroxide complex (Example 3), and 1,3 dimethylurea hydrogen peroxide complex (Example 4). These compounds were synthesized according to the<br>
The results appearing in Table 5 show that each of the tested hydrogen peroxide complexes generate peroxide vapor which provides efficient sterilization after only five minutes exposure.<br>
The temperature required to release the hydrogen peroxide vapor from the solid complex which is shown above is the temperature measured by a thermocouple thermometer located on the outside of the aluminum pan approximately 1 cm from the bottom of the pan. Further testing using a thermometer, such as a fluoroptic thermometer, placed on the inside bottom of the pan indicated that the temperature at the bottom of the pan was approximately 30-35°C higher, as described in Example 5 below. Thus, in the previous example, the temperature at the bottom of the pan was approximately 110 -115°C when the thermocouple thermometer read 80°C, and the temperature at the bottom of the pan was approximately 140 -145°C when the thermocouple thermometer read 110°C.<br>
Example 5<br>
To determine the temperature at the bottom of the aluminum pan used to contain the solid peroxide complex, a fluoroptic thermometer was taped to the inside bottom of the aluminum pan. An Omega" thermocouple thermometer was placed.on the outside of the aluminum pan approximately 1 cm from the bottom of the pan. Three different readings of the thermometers were taken. Each time the pan was heated to the desired temperature indicated by the thermometer placed on the side of the pan, allowed to cool, and then re-heated to the desired temperature. The recorded temperatures are listed below:<br>
Temp, at Temp, at bottom of pan (•c) side of pan 1st 2nd 3rd avo<br>
80°C 110.9 110.6 110.6 110.7<br>
100°C 131.5 132.6 132.0 132.0<br>
The results show that the temperature at the bottom of the aluminum pan was approximately 30-35°C higher than the temperature indicated by the thermocouple thermometer located at the side of the pan.<br>
Further testing was performed to compare the efficacy data obtained using an aqueous and non-aqueous source of peroxide in an open (non-lumen) system. The experiments are described in detail below.<br>
Example 6<br>
The apparatus of Example 1 was used with a biological challenge that consisted of 6.8 x 10s B. subtilis var (niger) spores on a 6mm x 4mm strip of Whatman #1 chromatography paper packaged in a TYVEK"/MYLAR* envelope. (TYVEK* is a gas permeable fabric made of polyethylene. MYLARTM is a non-gas permeable polyester material). Packaged biological challenge strips were placed in the front, middle and back of a polyphenylene oxide tray that contained a flexible fiberoptic sigmoktoscope. The tray was placed in a polyphenylene oxide container that had one port in the top and two ports in the bottom to allow for diffusion. The four-inch diameter ports were covered with a breathable polypropylene packaging material (SPUNGUARD" Heavy Duty Sterilization Wrap, Kimberly-Clark, Dallas, TX) to maintain the sterility of the contents of the container after sterilization. The container was placed in the apparatus of Example 1 and the pressure in the chamber was reduced to 0.2 Torr. The aluminum pan containing 2 grams of hydrogen peroxide urea adduct (Fluka Chemical Corp.) was then heated to 80 to 81 °C, as measured by a thermocouple thermometer placed on the outside of the aluminum pan approximately 1 cm from the bottom of the aluminum pan, for 5 minutes to provide 3mg/L of hydrogen peroxide vapor in the chamber. The biological test samples were exposed to the hydrogen peroxide vapor for periods of 5 and 10 minutes. After exposure the test samples were handled in the same way as were those in Example 1.<br>
Comparative studies were also conducted in which a 50% aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide was injected into the sterilization chamber and vaporized from a heated injector. The volume of hydrogen peroxide solution<br>
injected produced a vapor phase concentration of 3mg/L The test configuration, the composition of the biological test samples, and the handling of the biological test samples after exposure were all identical to those used in the non-aqueous hydrogen peroxide tests. The results of these tests are presented in Table 6.<br>
The results of these tests demonstrate the greater efficacy of the non-aqueous when compared with the aqueous hydrogen peroxide process in an "open" system in which the biological sample was not placed in a lumen. Again, it was surprisingly discovered that a non-aqueous system provided superior sterilization even when diffusion of hydrogen peroxide into a long and narrow lumen is not required.. This suggests that the mode of action of hydrogen peroxide is not the same for systems with and without water.<br>
Further testing was performed to determine the efficacy a non-aqueous peroxide vapor at normal, not reduced, pressure. This testing is detailed<br>
below.<br>
Example 7<br>
Efficacy tests were conducted with the hydrogen peroxide vapor released from the urea peroxide complex in an open system at atmospheric pressure. In this test the biological challenge of 1.04 x 10* B. subblis var. (niger) spores on the stainless steel surgical blades were packaged in a TYVEK*/MYLAR"<br>
envelope. Packaged biological challenge blades were placed on the front, middle, and back of a polyphenylene oxide tray. The tray was placed in the apparatus of Example 1 and the chamber door was closed. The aluminum pan containing 4.0 gm of urea peroxide (Fluka Chemical Corp.) was heated to 80° to 81 °C, as measured by a thermocouple thermometer placed on the side of the aluminum pan approximately 1 cm from the bottom of the pan, for the duration of the test. The biological test samples were exposed to the hydrogen peroxide vapor for periods of 5,10,20 and 30 minutes. After exposure the test samples were handled the same way as those in Example 1. The results of these tests are presented in Table 7 and demonstrate the efficacy of the non-aqueous peroxide process in an open system at atmospheric pressure.<br>
Further tests were conducted to determine the approximate amount of peroxide released from the hydrogen peroxide urea complex at various temperatures. This testing is described in Example 8.<br>
Example 8<br>
Urea peroxide powder, obtained from crushing the commercially available tablets (Fluka Chemical Corp.), was placed between two aluminum screens in an apparatus according to FIGURE 3B having dimensions 12.7 cm<br>
x 12.7 cm. The aluminum plate was then heated and the temperature was monitored using a thermometer located near a corner of the aluminum plate. Table 8 lists the approximate percent of peroxide released at various temperatures after heating for five minutes. The data show that approximately 100% of the peroxide is released from the complex at a temperature of 140°C. Lesser percentages of peroxide are released at lower temperatures.<br>
Table 8<br>
Peroxide complexes having the ability to release hydrogen peroxide vapor at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, such as the urea peroxide complex, allows them to be effective for use in various sterilization applications. Not only can they be used in the sterilization apparatus of the present Invention described above, the compounds of the present invention can also be used as part of self-sterilizing packaging materials, or applied onto supports such as gauze, sponge, cotton, and the like. The compounds allow for sterilization of sealed packages at room temperature or at elevated temperatures, and are particularly useful for the sterilization of packaged medical or surgical products.<br>
Particular uses of the compounds of the present invention are described in the examples which follow. The peroxide complex used in the following<br>
examples was urea peroxide in the form of a tablet (Fluka Chemical Corp.) or in the form of a powder obtained by crushing the tablets.<br>
Example 9<br>
A self-sterilizing pouch was assembled as follows: A surgical scalpel having 3.8 x 105 B. subtilis var. niger spores on its surface was placed in a sterile petri dish. The dish was placed in a larger petri dish, together with 1 gm urea peroxide complex in either tablet or powder form. The larger petri dish was then inserted into a pouch formed of TYVEKTM/MYLARTM (gas permeable, Table 9), MYLARTM /MYLAR1" (non-gas permeable, Table 10) or Paper/MYLARTM (gas permeable, Table 10). The pouch was then sealed.<br>
Each pouch was exposed to various temperatures for various time periods, as shown in Tables 9 and 10 below. The biological test samples were evaluated for sterilization as described in Example 1. The results are included in Tables 9 and 10, with a "+" sign indicating bacterial growth.<br>
Table 10 lists the efficacy data for self-sterilizing pouches with (Paper/MYLARTM) and without (MYLARTM/MYLARTM) a breathable barrier. The pouches were assembled as described above, however the peroxide vapor source was urea peroxide in powder form only.<br>
Results from this testing show that the urea peroxide complex of the present invention included in a pouch with and without a breathable barrier provides effective sterilization to an article inside the pouch in the absence of moisture at room temperature and atmospheric pressure after only 2 to 3 hours. At higher temperatures, sterilization is effected after only one hour.<br>
To determine the efficacy of the sterilization system of the present invention in a closed container, the following experiment was performed.<br>
Example 10<br>
A self-sterilizing container was assembled as follows: A stainless steel support having either 3.8 * 10s B. subtilis var. niger spores on its surface (Table 11) or having 9.2 x 105 B. subtilis var. niger spores on its surface (Table 12), was placed inside a small polyethylene (PE) vial having 20 holes (3/16" in size) in its surface. The vial was placed in a larger PE vial, which was covered with either an air tight cap, or a gas permeable layer of SPUNGUARD® (CSR Wrap). Also included in the larger vial was a second PE vial, also having 20 holes (3/16" in size) in its surface. This vial contained 1 gm urea peroxide in either powder or tablet form, and was sealed in either a SPUNGUARD" (CSR wrap) or TYVEK1" pouch.<br>
Each container was exposed to various temperatures for various time periods, as shown in Tables 11 and 12 below. The biological test samples<br>
were evaluated for sterilization as described in Example 1. The results are included in Tables 11 and 12, with a "+" sign indicating bacterial growth.<br>
" • pouch termed from TYYEKTM** • pouch found from CSR wrap<br>
Results from this testing show that the non-aqueous urea peroxide complex included in a container with and without a breathable barrier provides effective sterilization at room temperature after only 3-4 hours. At higher temperatures, sterilization is effected after as little as one half hour.<br>
The non-aqueous peroxide complexes which release peroxide vapor have been found to be useful in the sterilization of articles at room temperature,<br>
and more effectively, at higher temperatures. These complexes can be placed in a pouch, container, chamber, room or any area capable of being sealed, where they release peroxide vapor which effectively sterilizes the articles. The complexes can be heated to facilitate the release of vapor, and to provide sterilization in less time than that required for room temperature sterilization. The compounds of the present invention are therefore useful in a variety of applications where sterilization is desired. Simply by placing the complex in a sealed area containing an article or articles to be sterilized, sterilization can be achieved. By contrast with prior art methods, there is no need for contact with moisture to provide activation of the hydrogen peroxide.<br>
To confirm that sterilization can be effected using non-aqueous peroxide complexes in less time at lower pressures, the following experiment was performed.<br>
Example 11<br>
A self-sterilizing container was assembled as follows: A stainless steel support having 9.2 x 10s B. subtilis var. niger spores on its surface was placed inside a small PE vial having 20 holes (3/16" in size) in its surface. The vial was placed in a larger PE vial, which was covered with a gas permeable layer of CSR wrap (SPUNGUARD*). Also included in the larger vial was a second PE vial, also having 20 holes (3/16" in size) in its surface. This vial contained 1 gm urea peroxide in either powder or tablet form. The vial was then sealed in a CSR wrap or TYVEKTM pouch.<br>
The large vials were placed in either a 4.5 L sterilization chamber or a 173 L sterilization chamber. Each container was exposed to 100 torr pressure and 23°C temperature for 2 hours, as shown in Table 13. The biological test samples were evaluated for sterilization as described in Example 1. The results are included in Table 13.<br>
These results show that non-aqueous urea peroxide complex included in a container with a breathable barrier provides effective sterilization at 100 torr and room temperature after only 2 hours. These results, when compared with the results in Table 12, demonstrate that the peroxide complexes of the present invention provide sterilization at reduced pressures in less time than that required to effect sterilization at atmospheric pressure.<br>
Thus, the hydrogen peroxide complexes of the present invention can provide effective sterilization in significantly shorter periods of time. In addition, as discussed above, plasma can also be used to enhance the sterilization activity of the hydrogen peroxide vapor. The articles to be sterilized are subjected to a plasma after exposure to the peroxide vapor, and remain in the plasma for a period of time sufficient to effect complete sterilization.<br>
Articles that have been sterilized by exposure to hydrogen peroxide vapor can be exposed to a plasma to remove any residual hydrogen peroxide remaining on the articles. Because the residual hydrogen peroxide is decomposed into non-toxic products during the plasma treatment, the sterilized articles are ready for use following treatment without the need for any additional steps.<br>
Non-aqueous peroxide complexes are useful in a variety of applications, including as a component of self-sterilizing packaging. In addition, the complexes are suitable for use in various methods for vapor sterilization of articles, such as the method disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,943,414. This patent discloses a process in which a vessel containing a small amount of a<br>
vaporizable liquid sterilant solution is attached to a lumen, and the sterilant vaporizes and flows directly into the lumen of the article as the pressure is reduced during the sterilization cycle. The method disclosed in the patent can be modified to allow for use of a non-aqueous peroxide compound. The compound is placed in a vessel and connected to the lumen of the article to be sterilized. The article is then placed within a container and the container evacuated. The lumen of the article and the exterior of the article are contacted by the hydrogen peroxide vapor released from the non-aqueous compound. A plasma can optionally be generated and used to enhance sterilization and/or to remove any residual hydrogen peroxide form the article.<br>
Use of non-aqueous peroxide complexes in the system just described overcomes the disadvantage that the water in the aqueous solution is vaporized faster and precedes the hydrogen peroxide vapor into the lumen. Thus, more effective sterilization is achieved and less time is required to effect sterilization. Hydrogen peroxide complexes such as glycine anhydride are especially advantageous since they release a significant amount of hydrogen peroxide at reduced pressure without the need for additional heating of the complex. Synthesis of Non-Aqueous Hvdrooen Peroxide Complexes<br>
The present invention further provides a process for preparing non-aqueous hydrogen peroxide complexes that are useful as the source in a hydrogen peroxide vapor sterilizer, or as a component of self-sterilizing packaging, as was described above. Of course, the hydrogen peroxide complexes can be used for other applications, such as for bleaching agents, contact lens solutions, catalysts, and other applications which will be well known by those having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The general procedure for preparing the hydrogen peroxide complexes of this invention is as follows: (1) Place the reactant material in the chamber.<br>
The material to be reacted with the hydrogen peroxide can be a solid in various forms, (e.g., powder, crystal, film etc., preferably having high surface<br>
area to increase the reaction rate). The reactant material can also be present as a solution in water or another solvent, rf sufficient time is allowed to evaporate the solvent after the pressure is reduced in the chamber. The material may also be a liquid whose boiling point is higher than that of hydrogen peroxide (150°C). Since reaction rates are faster at elevated temperature, the chamber is preferably heated whether before or after the reactant composition is introduced. However, the temperature should not be so high that the reactant boils or vaporizes.<br>
The reactant composition may be contained in any container that provides access to the peroxide vapor. If it is in the form of a powder or other form that may be blown about when the chamber is evacuated, then the reactant may be retained in a permeable container, which allows hydrogen peroxide to diffuse into the container.<br>
(2) Evacuate the chamber.<br>
In certain embodiments, the chamber is evacuated to a pressure below atmospheric pressure, such as a pressure that is below the vapor pressure of the hydrogen peroxide (which depends on its concentration and temperature), in order to assure that all of the peroxide is in the vapor phase. The vapor pressure increases with increasing temperature and decreases with increasing peroxide concentration. For most of the experiments, the chamber was evacuated to about 0.2 Torr and the temperature was ambient or above.<br>
(3) Generate hydrogen peroxide vapor.<br>
The hydrogen peroxide vapor can be generated from a hydrogen peroxide solution or from a substantially anhydrous hydrogen peroxide complex. The latter yields dry hydrogen peroxide in the vapor state, which is an advantage if either the material to be reacted with the vapor or the complex to be formed is hygroscopic. Another advantage of generating the hydrogen peroxide vapor from a substantially water-free complex is that the percent of hydrogen peroxide in the complex being formed is higher than if the vapor is generated from an aqueous solution of H2O2 This is probably due to the<br>
competition between water molecules and H2O2 molecules for bonding sites on the complex when an aqueous solution is used to generate the H2O2 vapor. The peroxide vapor can be generated within the same chamber that houses the reactant material or in another chamber separated from it by a vacuum valve.<br>
(4) React the reactant material with hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The time required for the reaction depends, of course, on the reaction rate of the reactant with hydrogen peroxide. It can be empirically determined by monitoring the pressure, which decreases during the binding of peroxide to the reactant material. Typically, the reaction time is about 5-30 minutes. The concentration of vaporized hydrogen peroxide and the weight of the starting material determine the weight percentage of peroxide in the final reaction product. As the weight ratio of reactant to hydrogen peroxide increases, the weight percentage of hydrogen peroxide in the complex decreases. The reaction can be repeated multiple times to increase the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the complex.<br>
(5) Evacuate the chamber again.<br>
At the end of the reaction period, the chamber is further evacuated to about 2 Ton* to remove any unreacted hydrogen peroxide.<br>
(6) Vent the chamber and retrieve the hydrogen peroxide complex.<br>
The mechanism by which the hydrogen peroxide forms a complex with the reactant material is not completely understood. The formation of the complex is believed to involve hydrogen bond formation between the hydrogen peroxide and electron-rich functional groups containing oxygen and/or nitrogen on the reactant material. It is not known if this is the only mode of binding; however, materials with a wide range of functional groups have been found to form complexes with hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The advantages of the vapor phase reaction over earlier methods of hydrogen peroxide complex formation include:<br>
1. The ratio of hydrogen peroxide to reactant material can be accurately controlled by varying the amount of hydrogen peroxide present in the vapor state or the amount of reactant material exposed to the vapor.<br>
2. The need to remove solvent from the reaction product is eliminated.<br>
3. Peroxide complexes can be formed that are liquid or solids, such as powders, crystals, films, etc.<br>
4. Peroxide complexes of hygroscopic materials can be prepared. The synthesis of the non-aqueous peroxide complexes according to the<br>
present invention is further described in the following examples. Many of these compounds have utility as catalysts, in addition to having the utilities described in greater detail herein, as will be readily appreciated by those having ordinary skill in the art. The examples represent embodiments of the compositions and processes of the invention, but they are not in any way intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 12<br>
A hydrogen peroxide complex of glycine anhydride was prepared as follows: A 1.0 gram sample of glycine anhydride (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wl) was placed in an aluminum tray in a 173 liter chamber maintained at a temperature of 45°C. The top of the aluminum tray was covered with TYVEKTM nonwoven fabric, which prevented the glycine anhydride from coming out of the tray when the pressure in the chamber was reduced but was breathable and did not absorb hydrogen peroxide. The chamber door was closed and the pressure in the chamber was reduced to 0.2 Torr by evacuating the chamber with a vacuum pump. A hydrogen peroxide concentration of 10 mg/liter was created by evaporation of an appropriate volume of a 70% aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide (FMC Corp., Philadelphia, PA) into the chamber. The hydrogen peroxide vapor was maintained in contact with the glycine anhydride for 20 minutes. At the end of the reaction period, the chamber pressure was reduced to 2 Torr and then returned to atmospheric pressure. The reaction product was removed from the chamber and analyzed<br>
for weight percent hydrogen peroxide by the following iodometric titration reactions.<br>
H2O2 + 2KI + H2SO4-----&gt; l2 + K2SO4 + 2H2O<br>
l2 + 2Na2S2O3-------&gt; Na2S4O6 + 2Nal<br>
A starch indicator was used in the iodine-sodium thiosutfate titration reaction to enhance the color change at the end point. The percentage by weight of hydrogen peroxide was calculated by the following equation:<br>
wt% H2O2 = [(ml of Na2S2Os)*(normality of Na2S2O3) *1.7]/(sample weight in grams)<br>
The weight percentage of hydrogen peroxide in the gfycine anhydride complex was found to be 24.3%.<br>
Example 13<br>
The hydrogen peroxide complexes of a wide variety of organic and inorganic complexes were prepared using the procedure of Example 12. In each case, the reaction conditions were the same as those in Example 12, except 1.0 gram of each one of the compounds presented in Table 14 was used in place of glycine anhydride.<br>
The organic complexes formed cover the following range of functional groups that are capable of forming hydrogen bonds with hydrogen peroxide: alcohols, ethers, ketones, acids, amino acids, esters, organic salts, amines, amides, polyamtdes, potyurettianes, ureas, and biuret. The inorganic<br>
complexes include carbonates with sodium, potassium, and rubidium cations, as well as sodium bicarbonate. In addition, the hydrogen peroxide complexes of calcium hydroxide and tetrasodium pyrophosphate were also prepared. The starting materials were finely divided powers or slightly larger crystalline materials, except for nylon 6,6, which was processed as a film with a thickness of 0.12 mm, and polyvinyl methyl ether, which was a 50% by weight aqueous solution.<br>
The hydrogen peroxide complexes obtained with these materials under the test conditions were solids, except for polyvinylpyrrolidone, histamine, pofy(vinyl methyl ether), poly(vinyl methyl ketone),propionamide, and 1,3-dimethylurea. The 1,3-dimethylurea and propionamide hydrogen peroxide complexes were free flowing liquids that were easily handled in the vapor phase synthesis process, since no solvent needed to be removed to obtain the final product. The histamine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, poly(vinyl methyl ether), and poty(viny1 methyl ketone) complexes were gummy materials that were not as easy to handle.<br>
Examples 14 and 15 describe additional studies with polyvinylpyrrolidone under different process conditions to obtain the peroxide complex as a free flowing solid product.<br>
Example 14<br>
Hydrogen peroxide complexes with polyvinytpyrrolidone were prepared in which the percent hydrogen peroxide in the polyvinylpyrrolidone complex was varied by changing the ratio of the weight of polyvinylpyrrolidone to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the vapor state. The conditions in these tests were identical to those in Example 12, except the weight of polyvinylpyrrolidone was increased from 1.0 gram to 3.0 grams to 5.0 grams. In all tests, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was held constant at 10.0 mg/liter of chamber volume. The results of these tests are presented in Table 15.<br>
Example 15<br>
A hydrogen peroxide complex of PVP was prepared in which the hydrogen peroxide was delivered from a complex of hydrogen peroxide with urea. When hydrogen peroxide is delivered in this manner, it is substantially water free. In this test, 5 grams of PVP was placed in the reaction chamber and 10 mg H2O2/liter of chamber volume was delivered into the reaction chamber by heating about 7 grams of a 35% complex of H2O2 with urea to a temperature of about 110°C for approximately 5 minutes. The rest of the conditions in this test were the same as those in Example 12. The percentage hydrogen peroxide in the PVP complex and the physical state of the complex are presented in Table 15.<br>
The results of these tests demonstrate that a free flowing solid can be obtained with the PVP hydrogen peroxide complex by controlling the ratio of PVP to hydrogen peroxide in the vapor state and, alternatively, by using a substantially water-free hydrogen peroxide vapor source. INORGANIC HYDROGEN PEROXIDE COMPLEXES<br>
Inorganic hydrogen peroxide complexes are also suitable for use as sterilants as described in detail hereinabove for organic hydrogen peroxide complexes. Peroxide vapor can be released from these inorganic complexes at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. However, as described in greater detail below, substantial amounts of hydrogen peroxide vapor can be<br>
released from inorganic peroxide complexes upon rapid heating to a particular release temperature under both atmospheric and reduced pressure. In order to effectively release hydrogen peroxide from inorganic peroxide, the heating rate of the inorganic peroxide complexes is preferably at least 5°C/min; more preferably it is at least 10°C per minute; still more preferably at least 50°C/min.; and most preferably, it is at least 1000°C per minute.<br>
A representative listing of these inorganic peroxide complexes, and the weight percent hydrogen peroxide, is presented in Table 16. Preferred inorganic complexes are those which do not decompose to form a hydrohalic acid. Thus, especially preferred complexes contain no halogens. It is also possible to provide a mixture of peroxide complexes as a source of peroxide vapor. Such a mixture can be a "physical mixture" in which two different pre-prepared peroxide complexes are physically mixed, or a "chemical mixture" in which the compounds in the complex are mixed prior to preparation of peroxide complexes therefrom.<br>
The titration procedure used to determine the weight percent of H2O2 in the complexes was as described in Example 12. Sodium carbonate H2O2 complex was purchased from Fluka Chemical Corp. The vapor-phase synthesis procedure used for synthesizing the inorganic peroxide complexes was the same as that disclosed in Example 12, with the exceptions that 10g of the solid inorganic sample instead of 1-5g, and two reaction cycles versus one, were employed.<br>
Example 16<br>
The reaction procedure for liquid-phase synthesis of inorganic hydrogen peroxide complexes was essentially as described by Jones et al. (J. Chem. Soc., Dalton, 12:2526-2532, 1980). Briefly, inorganic solids were first dissolved in a 30% aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide to make a saturated solution, followed by dropwise addition of ethanol. For the potassium oxalate and rubidium carbonate complexes, the white peroxide precipitates were formed as the amount of ethanol added was gradually increased. For potassium carbonate, potassium pyrophosphate and sodium pyrophosphate, the saturated<br>
solutions were incubated at -10°C for several hours to facilitate crystalline peroxide complex formation. The complexes were separated from the liquid by vacuum filtration, washed with ethanol at least three times and dried by vacuum.<br>
1. The titration procedure employed to determine the weight percent of H202 in the complexes is the same as the one stated hereinabove.<br>
2. Sodium carbonate hydrogen peroxide complex was purchased from Fluka Chemical Corp.<br>
3. The vapor and liquid phase procedures were used for synthesizing the inorganic peroxide.<br>
A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (Model PDSC 2920, TA and Mettler-Toledo Model DSC 27HP instruments) was used to determine H2O2 release or decomposition properties of the inorganic peroxide complexes. The DSC was run at a heating ramp of 10°C/min and at a temperature range of between 30°C and 220°C. under both atmospheric and varying vacuum pressure conditions. Referring now to FIGURE 5, the DSC comprises a<br>
sample chamber 110, heating plate 112 and pressure control system. The pressure control system comprises a pressure transducer 114 connected to a pressure gauge 116. The pressure gauge 116 is connected to a controller 118 which is, in turn, connected to a pressure control valve 120. The pressure transducer 114 is in fluid communication with pressure control valve 120 and with pump 122.<br>
Potassium oxalate hydrogen peroxide complex synthesized as described hereinabove was placed in a DSC and subjected to a particular vacuum pressure over a temperature range of 50°C to 170°C. As can be seen in FIGURE 6, under these DSC conditions with one hole on the lid of the sample pan, greater release of H2O2, an endothermic process, occurred at lower pressures, while the exothermic decomposition of H2O2 was favored at higher pressures. However, as shown in FIGURE 10, partial release of peroxide may also occur at atmospheric pressure when the same experiment was repeated without any cover on the pan (i.e. open pan). Thus, for certain hydrogen peroxide complexes, a more open system and/or reduced pressure can facilitate release of H2O2 from the complex.<br>
In the use of the inorganic peroxide complexes for sterilization, it is critical to complex stability that heating occur rapidly which may be effected by preheating the aluminum plate prior to contacting with the inorganic peroxide composition. In the use of the inorganic peroxide compounds, it is also preferred that the temperature be higher than 86°C.<br>
As discussed above, it is preferred that the inorganic hydrogen peroxide complex be heated rapidly, i.e. as rapidly as 1000°C/minute or more. This can be accomplished by contacting the peroxide with a pre-heated heating plate. A preferred embodiment for accomplishing such rapid heating is shown in FIGURES 7A and 7B. Referring to FIGURE 7A, there is shown an apparatus 125 for injecting peroxide vapor into a sterilization chamber 131 in a closed position. The inorganic hydrogen peroxide complex is incorporated into a peroxide disk 132. The disk 132 comprises five layers: three layers of CSR wrap, peroxide complex powder and aluminum foil coated with polypropylene.<br>
The disk 132 is heat sealed around its edge to retain the peroxide complex powder. The peroxide disk 132 is placed underneath a perforated aluminum plate 130 which is attached to housing 150 by aluminum attachment pieces 142. The disk 132 is loosely held in place between O-rings 151. Prior to introduction of peroxide vapor into the chamber, a heated aluminum platen 134 is apart from the peroxide disk 132 and is attached to an aluminum plate 136. A spring (not shown) within the bellow 138 holds the plate 136 down in the closed position. When the chamber 131 is evacuated, the bellow 138 is also evacuated. The plate 136 is seated against O-rings 148, thus separating a peroxide release chamber 152 from passageways 158. The apparatus is held in place and attached to a sterilization chamber 131 by bolts 144, 146, 154 and 156.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 7B, in order to bring the platen 134 up to contact the peroxide disk 132, the bellow 138 is vented. Once the pressure is increased, the bellow 138 moves upward, thereby propeling the heated aluminum platen 134 against the peroxide disk 132. In a preferred embodiment, the aluminum platen 134 is pre-heated to 175°C; however other temperatures can be used. Peroxide vapor is then released from the powder through the CSR layers, passes through the perforations 160 in the perforated aluminum plate 130, and enters the peroxide release chamber 152. The upward movement of the heated aluminum platen 134 also opens the peroxide release chamber 152, allowing peroxide vapor to enter passageways 158 which are in fluid communication with the sterilization chamber.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 8, there is illustrated a sterilization chamber 170 containing a plurality of glass rods 172 orthogonally arranged therein. Stainless steel scalpel blades 174 and 176 placed at the top and bottom, respectively, of chamber 170 contain Bacillus stearothermophilus inoculated thereon. Contained within the sterilization chamber 170 and shown to the right thereof is an apparatus 178 used for heating the hydrogen peroxide complexes, which for exemplary purposes were sodium pyrophosphate (Na4P207-3H2O2) and potassium oxalate (K2C2O4.H7O2) hydrogen peroxide complexes. An<br>
apparatus 178 comprises a pyrex bowl 180 at the bottom of chamber 170. A pyrex dish 182 is disposed on top of the pyrex bowl 180. An aluminum plate 184 with a heating pad 186 is placed on top of the pyrex dish 182. The peroxide complex is placed on the aluminum plate 184. A power cord 188 is attached to the heating pad 186 and a thermocouple 190 is attached to the aluminum plate 184. Scalpel blades 174 are placed two inches above the aluminum plate 184.<br>
In certain embodiments, the hydrogen peroxide complexes are provided within a separate enclosure in fluid communication with the container in which the article to be sterilized is located. The pressures within the enclosure and the container can be the same or different A positive pressure difference in the enclosure will facilitate movement of the peroxide vapor released from the peroxide complex within the enclosure into the container. Such positive pressure would be particularly useful where the container is large, such as when it is an entire room.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the peroxide complex in powder form is applied to an adhesive surface. Preferred adhesive surfaces include high temperature rated adhesive tapes such as A10 and A25 adhesive tapes (3M Corp., Minneapolis, MN). These peroxide complex powder-coated adhesive tapes are then heated to effect peroxide release therefrom using the apparatus shown in, for example, FIGURES 3A, 7A and 8.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 9, high temperature rated adhesive tape 200 having peroxide complex powder 202 is disposed on aluminum foil layer 204. One or more CSR layers 206 is layered on top of adhesive tape layer 200. This arrangement can take the form of individual sheets of material, or a rod can be formed from the material.<br>
The inorganic peroxide complexes used in Examples 17 and 18 to determine the amount of peroxide release and sterilization efficacy were potassium pyrophosphate (K4p207•3H2O2: PP), potassium oxalate (K2C2O41H2O2 PO) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO,•1.5 H2O2: SC).<br>
Example 17<br>
Release of Peroxide from SC, PO and PP<br>
The ideal temperature at which H2O2 was released from SC, PO and PP was determined by DSC. The actual amount of H2O2 released from 2 g of each of these complexes was determined at various temperatures using a 75 liter chamber and the apparatus shown in FIGURES 7A and 7B. The amount of H2O2 released from PP at 175°C was greater than for SC and PO. Although SC released the least amount of H2O2 at 175°C, significantly more release was seen when the amount of sample was increased.<br>
Example 18 Efficacy tests using SC, PO and PP<br>
2 x 106 B. subtilis var. niger spores were inoculated on a SS blade. Three inoculated blades were first placed in the front, middle and back positions of a Spunguard wrapped 10"x 21 "x 3.5" polyphenylene oxide tray. The wrapped tray was then placed in a 75 liter vacuum chamber having an initial vacuum pressure of 0.2 torr. A 5.5" peroxide disk was made by heat-sealing the SC, SO or PP inorganic peroxide powders between three layers of Spunguard and one layer of aluminum foil coated with polypropylene film. The peroxide was released by contacting the disk for 2 minutes with an aluminum plate which had been preheated to 175°C, followed by an additional diffusion time of 8 minutes for a total exposure time of 10 minutes. After treatment, the. three blades were separately placed in Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB) at 32°C for 7 days and scored for bacterial grdwth. The results are summarized in Table 18.<br>
As can be seen in Table 18, no growth of spores was observed with the exception of 2 g SC (1/3). However, when the amount of SC subjected to vaporization was increased to 3 grams, no bacterial growth was observed. These results underscore the efficacy of sterilization using inorganic hydrogen peroxide complexes.<br>
Inorganic hydrogen peroxide complexes can be readily incorporated into the sterilization procedures described hereinabove in connection with organic peroxide complexes. For example, inorganic complexes can be used in connection with a plasma sterilization method, or in connection with a self-sterilizing enclosure where peroxide is slowly released from the complex. Similarly, inorganic complexes can also be used in the sterilization of articles having narrow lumens, whereby a vessel containing the inorganic peroxide complex is connected to the lumen. In addition, pressure pulsing of the vapor released from inorganic peroxide complexes can be employed. Other examples of the use of inorganic complexes for sterilization will be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art upon reference to the present specification. Synthesis of Phosphate and Condensed Phosphate Peroxide Complexes<br>
Some phosphate and condensed phosphate peroxide complexes, along with procedures for their synthesis reported in the literature, are summarized in Table 19. In general, these complexes can be synthesized by mixing the phosphate salts with aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (.either adding solid to peroxide solution or adding the peroxide solution to the solid). Since the heat generated by the reaction may result in decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, attempts have been made to control the reaction temperature by slowly mixing solid with the peroxide solution or using cooled peroxide solution (e.g., 0°C). Peroxide complexes have also been formed by dissolving the hydrate of phosphate or condensed phosphate salts in peroxide solution.<br>

Sprav method<br>
Procedures similar to those previously described in the literature were performed to determine the ease and limitations of the procedures for preparing phosphate and condensed phosphate complexes. In general, complexes were prepared by spraying peroxide solution onto evenly spread solid salts, followed<br>
by vacuum or oven drying. Table 20 summarizes the complexes synthesized by the spray method. Na4P2O7•3H2O2 could not be synthesized using a 30% H2O2 solution which is consistent with the prior art. The K3PO4 peroxide complex could not be prepared by directly adding H2O2 solution to anhydrous K3PO2 at room temperature. Detailed synthesis conditions are provided in Examples 21 to 36 below.<br>
Liquid-Sprav Synthesis of Na4P2O7;<br>
In general, an anhydrous complex of sodium pyrophosphate and hydrogen peroxide (Na4P2O7•nH2O2) was synthesized using a liquid-solid phase reaction followed by vacuum and/or oven drying. A number of parameters were varied in connection with the liquid-spray synthesis of a complex of sodium pyrophosphate and hydrogen peroxide, as described below in Examples 21-27. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution (30-90% H2O2) was sprayed onto sodium pyrophosphate (98%, AJdrich) dropwise. The mixture was incubated at 10°C, 25°C or 45°C for 1-16 hours, followed by vacuum drying at 25°C-60°C and/or oven drying at 60°C. H2O2 concentration, starting H2O2 to Na4P2O7 molar ratio, solid to liquid ratio, incubation time and temperature, drying mode, drying temperature and quantity of starting materials were varied as described in the following examples to determine their effect on product composition.<br>
Examples 21 to 23 show the effect of drying processes (vacuum drying at 30°C, vacuum drying at 60°C, and oven drying at 60°C, respectively) on final wt % of H2O2 in the resulting complex with a 2 hour reaction time at 25°C.<br>
Example 24 shows the reaction time effect with vacuum drying at 25°C. The results indicate that a one hour reaction period is sufficient for forming a 1:3 ratio of sodium pyrophosphate to H2O2 in the complex.<br>
Example 25 shows the reaction temperature effect on peroxide complex formation. The results indicate that the complex with about a 1:3 ratio could still be formed at a temperature below 45*C when a small quantity of starting materials was employed.<br>
Example 26 shows the effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration on the composition of the resulting peroxide complex using liquid-spray synthesis. As indicated in Table 26, when 30% H2O2 was sprayed onto sodium pyrophosphate solid, even at a starting H2O2 to SP molar ratio of 4:1, the resulting complex, Na4P2O7-1.64H2O2, had a H2O2 to SP ratio of less than 2:1 (bis-peroxyhydrate). The tris-peroxyhydrate (Na4P2O7-3H2O2) could be formed when the concentration of H2O2 was greater than 45%, preferably greater than<br>
50%. The composition of Na4P2O7-4H2O2, with a H2O2 to SP ratio of 4:1, was only stable at a temperature below 60°C.<br>
Example 27 shows that the sodium pyrophosphate tris-peroxyhydrate complex could not be successfully prepared by the liquid-spray method when a larger quantity of Na4P2O7 was used.<br>
Example 21 Vacuum drying at 30*C<br>
H2O2 (59%) was mixed with sodium pyrophosphate (SP) at a solid to liquid ratio of 1:0.8, 1:0.9 and 1:1.1 by weight, incubated at 25°C for 2 hours and dried under vacuum at 30°C for 4 hours or at 30°C for 4 hours followed by 60°C for 15 hours. The product yield ranged from 84% to 99%. The results are summarized in Table 21.<br>
Example 22<br>
Vacuum drying at 60*C<br>
H2O2 (59%) was mixed with sodium pyrophosphate at a solid to liquid ratio of 1:0.8, 1:0.9 and 1:1.1 by weight, incubated at 25°C for 2 hours and dried under vacuum at 60°C for 4 hours. The results are summarized in Table 22.<br>
Example 23 Oven drying at 60*C<br>
H2O2 (59%) was mixed with sodium pyrophosphate at a solid to liquid ratio of 1:0.8, 1:0.9 and 1:1.1 by weight, incubated at 25°C for 2 hours and oven dried at 60°C for either 6 hours or 21 hours. The results are summarized in Table 23.<br>
Example 24 Reaction time effect<br>
H2O2 (59%) was mixed with sodium pyrophosphate at a solid to liquid ratio of 1:0.8 by weight, incubated at 25°C for 1, 2 and 16 hours and dried under vacuum at 25*C for 4 hours. The results are summarized in Table 24.<br>
This sample was used for the thermal stability study in Example 39.<br>
Example 25 Reaction temperature effect<br>
H2O2 (59%) was mixed with sodium pyrophosphate at a solid to liquid ratio of 1:0.8, 1:1.1 or 1:1.3 by weight, incubated at 10°C, 25°C or 45°C, and dried under vacuum. The results are summarized in Table 25.<br>
Example 26 Effect of H2O2 concentration<br>
H2O2 solution having different concentrations was added to sodium pyrophosphate (Aldrich, 98%) dropwise. The mixture was incubated at 25°C for 2 hours, then vacuum dried at 25°C for 4 hours, followed by oven drying at 60°C for 15 hours with the exception of the sample in the last row of Table 26, which was vacuum dried at 25°C for 4 hours, then oven dried at 40°C for 9 hours. The results are summarized in Table 26 and indicate that higher concentrations of peroxide are required to make a peroxide complex having a H2O2 to SP molar ratio of about 1:3.<br>
Example 27<br>
Effect of quantity of starting compound<br>
59% H2O2 solution at room temperature was slowly sprayed onto sodium<br>
pyrophosphate solid; however, the temperature of the mixture increased. When 59% H2O2 was added to 300 grams SP, the temperature of the mixture climbed<br>
to over 60°C. thus, larger quantities of SP do not appear to work as well as smaller quantities. The results are summarized in Table 27.<br>
Several additional liquid-spray syntheses of additional peroxide complexes are described in Examples 28-34 below.<br>
Example 28<br>
Liquid-spray synthesis of Na3PO4-5H2O2<br>
Aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions having hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 30%, 59% and 70% were sprayed onto solid sodium orthophosphate, tribasic (SPT; 96%, Aldrich) to form a paste. The mixture was incubated for 2 hours at 25°C. then vacuum dried at 25°C. The results are summarized in Table 28.<br>
Example 29 Liquid synthesis of Na2HPO4-H2O2 and Na2HPO4-2H2O2<br>
Sodium phosphate, dibasic solid (99.95%, Aldrich) was dissolved in aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution and incubated at 25°C for 1 hour, then dried under vacuum at 25°C. The resulting product was a gel having a Na2HPO4/H2O2 ratio of about 1:2. Further drying of the gel resulted in a powder having a Na2HPO4/H2O2 ratio of about 1:1. The results are summarized in Table 29. /<br>
Example 30<br>
Liquid-spray synthesis of Na,P3O10-1-2H2O2 Concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution was sprayed onto sodium tripolyphosphate (85%, AJdrich) (STP) dropwise. The mixture was incubated at 25°C for 1 hour, vacuum dried at 25°C, and then oven dried at 60°C. Results are shown in Table 30.<br>
Example 31<br>
Liquid-spray synthesis of K,PO4nH2O2<br>
59% H2O2 at room temperature was added dropwise to potassium phosphate, tribasic (97%, Aldrich). The temperature of the reaction mixture during the spraying climbed to about 80°C. The paste mixture was dried under vacuum for 4 hours. The results are summarized in Table 31 and indicate that the majority of peroxide in the complex decomposed due to the high reaction temperature.<br>
Example 32<br>
Liquid-spray synthesis of K4P2O7-nH2O2<br>
Aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution having a concentration of 59% or 70% was sprayed onto potassium pyrophosphate (PP) (97%, Aldrich) to form a paste, the temperature of which was about 30*C to 35°C during spraying. The mixture was incubated at 25°C for 2 hours, then dried under vacuum at 25°C. The results are summarized in Table 32.<br>
Example 33 Liquid-spray synthesis of K2HPO4-3H2O2<br>

Example 35 Uquid-Spray Synthesis of Ca2P,07O.42H202<br>
59% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution was sprayed onto solid calcium pyrophosphate (Aldrich). The mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 25°C, then vacuum dried at 25°C. The results are summarized in Table 35.<br>
Example 36<br>
Uquid-Spray Synthesis of Mg2P2O7•4.60H2O2 59% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution was sprayed onto solid magnesium pyrophosphate (Aldrich). The mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 25°C, then vacuum dried at 25°C. The results are summarized in Table 36.<br>
Although several phosphate peroxide complexes have been described, no general method of synthesis for producing stable complexes is known. The reaction between hydrogen peroxide solution and a phosphate or condensed phosphate is an exothermic reaction. The heat produced by this exothermic reaction can result in decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide. As a result, the complex may be unstable, or may have a lower ratio of peroxide to phosphate or condensed phosphate than desired. This problem is particularly pronounced when a large quantity of complex is prepared.<br>
Paste Method<br>
In an effort to control the heat produced by reaction of hydrogen peroxide solution with the phosphate or condensed phosphate, we have developed a variety of synthesis methods. One such method we call the "paste" method because a paste is initially formed from the phosphate or condensed phosphate with water. This paste-liquid synthetic method for inorganic hydrogen peroxide complexes comprises mixing the desired inorganic compound with water to form a soft paste. The paste is allowed to cool, and aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution is added to the inorganic paste. The resulting mixture is dried to remove water, yielding the inorganic hydrogen peroxide complex.<br>
The main advantege of this synthetic scheme is that while the reaction of inorganic compound with water is exothermic, very little heat is generated during formation of the inorganic peroxide complex, thus avoiding the degradation of hydrogen peroxide during the synthesis. This is a significant<br>
improvement over previous methods in which significant amounts of heat are generated which degrade the hydrogen peroxide. The resulting crystals of the inorganic peroxide complex are finer and more stable than those produced **^ according to other procedures and lower concentrations of H2O2 can also be used.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory or mechanism of action, we believe that a hydrate is initially formed upon formation of the paste, and that the water from these hydrates is then replaced with peroxide to form the inorganic peroxide complexes. Examples 37 and 38 provide exemplary methods for the production of two different phosphate peroxide complexes.<br>
Example 37<br>
Paste-liquid synthesis of Na4P2O7-2-3 HjO2 using different H2O2 cones. Sodium pyrophosphate solid (98%, Aldrich) was mixed with deionized water and slowly stirred, resulting in formation of a soft paste. Because this reaction is exothermic, the paste was allowed to cool to room temperature. Aqueous H2O2 solution having different H2O2 concentrations was mixed with the paste. No temperature increase occurred. The mixture was incubated at 25°C for 1 hour, then vacuum dried at 25°C. The vacuum dried samples were further oven dried at 60°C to remove any remaining water. The results are summarized in Table 37.<br>
This sample was used for the thermal stability study in Example 39.<br>
Table 37 shows several advantages of the paste method for the preparation of hydrogen peroxide complexes:<br>
1. The starting concentration of H2O2 was not restricted to greater than 50% in order to prepare sodium pyrophosphate tris-peroxyhydrate (Na4P2O7-3H2O2). The complex could be prepared when as low as 12% H2O2 solution was employed.<br>
2. Na4P2O7-3H2O2 could be successfully prepared using larger quantities of starting materials (e.g. 200 g SP), because no temperature increase occurred during mixing of H2O2 solution with SP-water paste.<br>
3. Peroxide complexes having different compositions can easily be prepared by controlling the H2O2 to SP molar ratio in the starting mixture.<br>
Example 38 Paste-liquid synthesis of K,PO4-nH2O2<br>
Potassium phosphate, tribasic (97%, Aldrich) (PPT) was mixed with deionized water and slowly stirred, resulting in formation of a soft paste which was allowed to cool to room temperature. Aqueous H2O2 solution (59%) was mixed with the paste. No temperature increase was observed. The mixture was incubated at 25°C for 2 hours and dried under vacuum at 25°C. The results are summarized in Table 38. Potassium phosphate peroxide could not be formed by the liquid-spray procedure (as shown in Example 31) which is used for most phosphate-peroxide complex syntheses. When a hydrogen peroxide solution was sprayed onto solid potassium phosphate, the temperature of the reaction mixture climbed to about 80°C. This high temperature most likely results in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide so that minimal incorporation of hydrogen peroxide into potassium phosphate occurred. The paste method is clearly superior to the liquid-spray method for the preparation of the K3pO4-3H2O2 complex.<br>
Example 39<br>
Thermal stability of Na4P,O7-3*4,0, prepared using spray method and paste method<br>
Approximately 0.3 g complex sample was stored in a 5 ml plastic bottle which was either left unscrewed (open, condition 1) or tightiy capped (sealed,<br>
condition 2). The open and sealed bottles were placed in a 23°C, 50% relative humidity (RH) incubator or a 60°C oven. The H2O2 content of the complex was then determined. The results are summarized in Table 39.<br>
Comparing the results reported in Table 39, the stability of the complex produced via the spray method was less stable at 60°C than the complex prepared via the paste method. However, the stability at 23°C and 50% relative humidity was roughly comparable. Thus, the paste method offers unexpected stability under adverse storage conditions, such as commonly occur during shipping.<br>
Hvdrate Method<br>
As discussed above, we believe that the paste method initially produces a hydrate of the phosphate or condensed phosphate. For many phosphate or condensed phosphate compounds, hydrates can either be readily produced using techniques well known to those having ordinary skill in the art, or are commercially available. Thus, we tried a hydrate method of synthesis for<br>
peroxide complexes which omits the initial paste-formation of the past method, substituting instead a prepared hydrate. As is believed to occur in the past method, the water molecules of the hydrate are replaced by peroxide. Example 40 below provides an exemplary hydrate synthesis method.<br>
Example 40<br>
Hydrate synthesis of Na4P2O7-3H2O2<br>
Sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate solid (99%, Aldrich) was mixed with 12%, 30% or 59% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution, incubated for one hour at 25°C, then vacuum dried at 25°C. The results are summarized in Table 40. Thus, this complex can be prepared with less than 30% hydrogen peroxide solution.<br>
Synthesis of Surfate Peroxide Complexes<br>
We have also synthesized hydrogen peroxide complexes of suffate salts for use in connection with the sterilization methods described herein. Examples 41 and 42 provide synthetic details for two exemplary suffate salt complexes.<br>
Example 41<br>
Liquid-Spray Synthesis of Na2SO4•l.28H2O2 59% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution was sprayed onto solid sodium surfate (99%+, Aldrich). The mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 25°C, then vacuum dried at 25°C. The results are summarized in Table 41.<br>
Synthesis of Silicate Peroxide Complexes<br>
We have also synthesized hydrogen peroxide complexes of silicate salts for use in connection with the sterilization methods described herein. Examples 43 and 44 provide synthetic details for two exemplary silicate salt complexes.<br>
Example 43 Paste-Liquid Synthesis of Na2SK),•nH2O2<br>
Solid sodium metasilicate (Na2SiO,, Aldrich) was mixed with water, resulting in formation of a soft paste, which was allowed to cool to room temperature. Aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (12%) was mixed with the paste. The temperature during the mixing was 30-35°C. The mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 25°C, then vacuum dried at 25°C. The results are summarized in Table 43.<br>
Example 42<br>
Liquid-Spray Synthesis of KjSO4•0.62H2O2 59% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution was sprayed onto solid potassium sulfate (99%+, AJdrich). The mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 25°C, then vacuum dried at 25°C. The results are summarized in Table 42.<br>
Example 44 Hydrate Synthesis of Na2Si,O7•0.68H2O2<br>
59% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution was sprayed onto solid sodium trisilicate hydrate (Na2Si3O•xH2O, AJdrich). The mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 25°C, then vacuum dried at 25°C. The results are summarized in Table 44.<br>
Thus, we have shown that hydrogen peroxide complexes of a wide variety of inorganic salts can be produced. We believe that successful release of H2O2 in connection with the sterilization methods disclosed herein can be achieved using a large number of salts of anions capable of hydrogen bonding, such as those that include at least one oxygen and/or nitrogen atom. See, Table 14, supra, for examples of organic complexes and additional inorganic<br>
complexes which can be used in connection with the methods of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Release of Peroxide from Complexes<br>
The DSC curves shown in previous examples, e.g. FIGURE 6, were conducted with one hole on a covered pan at both atmospheric and reduced pressure. With only one small hole on the lid, an exothermic peak was observed in DSC at one atomphere for potassium oxalate peroxide complex. The same test was repeated under atmospheric pressure to determine whether more peroxide can be released using a more open system, as shown below in Example 45.<br>
Example 45 H2O2 Release from K2C2O4 peroxide complex at atmospheric pressure<br>
Potassium oxalate hydrogen peroxide complex (K2C2O4-H2O2) was heated at atmospheric pressure using the apparatus shown in FIGURE 5, having either two holes in the sealed lid of a sample pan on the heating plate 112 or with an aluminum pan open to the atmosphere. The DSC profile is shown in FIGURE 10. A large endothermic peak followed by a small exothermic peak indicated partial release of H2O2 if the pan was open. A small endothermic peak followed by a large exothermic peak indicated that some release, but mostly degradation, had occurred when the pan had a lid with two holes.<br>
In view of the results of Example 45 that a significant amount of H2O2 release could occur with an open pan but not using a lid with two holes, we conducted the remainder of our testing of release of peroxide from complexes at atmospheric pressure using an open pan and under reduced pressure using a pan covered with a lid with one hole in DSC. The DSC profiles of a number of inorganic complexes are shown in FIGURES 11-25 and a summary of the thermal behavior of peroxide complexes in DSC studies is shown in Table 45.<br>
FIGURE 11A is a DSC profile of Na4P2O7-2H2O2 and Na4P2O7-3H2O2 at 760 ton*. As can be seen, one endothermic peak was observed, indicating that near complete release had occurred.<br>
FIGURE 11B is a DSC profile of Na4P2O74H2O2 at 760 torr. As can be seen, two endothermic peaks were observed, indicating near complete release occurred.<br>
FIGURE 12 is a DSC profile of Na3PO4HA at 760 torr, 7 torr and 0.35 torr. The complex was synthesized using the liquid-spray procedure. As can be seen, endothermic peaks followed by a small exothermic peak indicated that partial release had occurred at one atmosphere. But, under vacuum, a broad endothermic effect indicated near complete release had occurred.<br>
FIGURE 13 shows DSC profiles of Na2HPO4-1H2O2 and Na2HPO4 -2H2O2 at 760 ton*. Both complexes showed an endothermic effect in DSC, indicating near total release occurred at atmospheric pressure.<br>
FIGURE 14 shows a DSC profile of NajP3O10-H2O2 at 760 torr. Several endothermic peaks indicated near total release had occurred under atmospheric pressure.<br>
FIGURE 15 shows a DSC profile of K,POy3.34H2O2 at 760 torr, 7 torr and 1 torr. One exothermic peak in DSC at atmospheric pressure indicated that most H2O2 had decomposed at atmospheric pressure, but partial release occurred under vacuum since an endothermic peak was observed before the exothermic peak under vacuum.<br>
FIGURE 16 is a DSC profile of K4P2C7•7H2O2 at 760 torr and 7 torr. Based on independently obtained weight loss data, an endothermic peak is likely canceled out by an exothermic peak in the range 140°C-180°C at atmospheric pressure, thus, the DSC shows that partial release occurred at atmospheric pressure. Several endothermic peaks under vacuum indicated near total release under those conditions.<br>
FIGURE 17 shows a DSC profile of K2PO43.15H2O2 at 760 torr and at 1 torr. Several endothermic peaks followed by exothermic peaks indicated that partial release occurred at atmospheric pressure, but no exothermic peaks were observed under vacuum, indicating near total release under those conditions.<br>
FIGURE 18 shows a DSC profile of KH2PO4-H2O2 at 760 torr. Two endothermic peaks were observed, indicating near total release occurred under atmospheric pressure.<br>
FIGURE 19 shows a DSC profile of Na2CO3-1.5H2O2 at both 760 torr and at 7 torr. The endothermic peak at 90-100°C is believed to be release of H2O under both atmospheric and vacuum conditions. The exothermic peak at approximately 150*C under atmospheric pressure indicated mostly H2O2 decomposition. However, the exothermic peak became endothermic followed by a small exothermic peak under vacuum conditions, indicating that most H2O2 was released.<br>
FIGURE 20 shows a DSC profile of Ca2P2O7*3.42H2O2 at 760 torr. An endothermic peak indicated near complete release of H2O2 had occurred.<br>
FIGURE 21 is a DSC profile of Mg2P2O7*4.60H2O2 at 760 torr and 7 torr. An endothermic peak followed by an exothermic peak indicated partial release of H2O2 occurred at atmospheric pressure, but a large endothermic peak observed under vacuum indicated near total release under vacuum.<br>
FIGURE 22 is a DSC profile of Na,SO4•1.28H2O2 at 760 torr. An endothermic peak indicated that near complete release had occurred under atmospheric conditions.<br>
FIGURE 23 is a DSC profile of K2SO4•0.62H2O2 at 760 torr. An endothermic peak indicated that near complete release occurred under atmospheric conditions.<br>
FIGURE 24 is a DSC profile of NajSKO3•2.15H2O2 at 760 torr, 1 torr and 0.5 torr. Exothermic peaks under atmospheric and reduced pressure indicated that most of the H2O2 had decomposed under these conditions.<br>
FIGURE 25 is a DSC profile of Na2Si3O7•0.68H2O2 at 760 torr. An exothermic peak indicated that most of the Hp, had decomposed under atmospheric pressure.<br>
Table 45 below summarizes the thermal behavior of peroxide complexes in DSC studies.<br>
Efficacy Test Results<br>
Previous examples, e.g. Examples 17 and 18, demonstrated that inorganic peroxide complexes were capable of providing sterilization in connection with the techniques described herein and elesewhere under vacuum conditions. In order to demonstrate that those inorganic complexes were capable of providing sterilization under atmospheric conditions, we tested the j<br>
sterilization efficacy of a number of compounds. Example 46A provides results in which the sterilization occurred at one atmosphere and low temperature (=60°C) for a complex with an endothermic peak only in DSC at one atmosphere. Example 46B provides the results in which the sterilization occurred at one atmosphere and low temperature (=60°C) for a complex with<br>
both endothermic and exothermic peaks in DSC at one atmosphere. Example 46C provides the results in which the sterilization occurred at one atmosphere and low temperature (=60°C) for a complex with an exothermal peak only in DSC at one atmosphere. Example 47 provides the results in which the sterilization occurred at one atmosphere and the complex was heated using a complex with an only endothermic peak in DSC at one atmosphere. Example 48 provides the results in which the sterilization occurred at one atmosphere and the complex was heated using a complex with both endothermic and exothermic peaks at one atmosphere. As seen below, under these conditions, efficacious sterilization could be achieved at one atmosphere pressure using these complexes, even for a complex having only an exothermic peak in DSC. As discussed above, it is believed that in certain instances an endothermic peak is masked in DSC by an exothermic peak occurring within the same temperature range, accounting for the efficacious sterilization seen using complexes exhibiting only an exothermic peak on DSC.<br>
Example 46A Sterilization using KH2PO4-H2O2 peroxide complex<br>
(1 atm. and low temperature)<br>
A self-sterilizing pouch was assembled as follows: A stainless steel blade having 7.7 x 10s B. stearothermophilus spores in its surface was placed in a sterile petri dish (60 x 15 mm). 2 grams of KH2PO4-H2O2 complex powder (containing 20.31% wt of H2O2 was placed in another petri dish. Both dishes were inserted together into a 100 x 250 mm pouch formed of TYYEK™/MYLAR™. The pouch was sealed and exposed to room temperature (approx. 23°Cj, 40°C (in an incubator) and 60°C (in an oven) for different time<br>
periods. The sterility test results are summarized in Table 46A. i<br><br>
Example 46B Sterilization using KaC2O4+H2O2 peroxide complex<br>
(1 atm and low temperature)<br>
A self-sterilizing pouch was assembled as follows: A stainless steel blade having 1.34 x 106 B. subtilis var. niger spores on its surface was placed in a sterile petri dish (60 x 15 mm). 2 grams of K2C2O4-H7O2 complex powder (containing 14.21% wt of H2O2) was placed in another petri dish. Both dishes were inserted together into a 100 x 250 mm pouch formed of MYLARS/MYLAR™. The pouch was sealed and exposed to 40°C (in an incubator) and 60°C (in an oven) for different time periods. The sterility test results are summarized in Table 46B.<br>
Example 46C Sterilization using Na2CO3-1.5H2O2 peroxide complex<br>
(1 atm and low temperature)<br>
A self-sterilizing pouch was assembled as follows: A stainless steel blade having 1.34 x 10a B. subtilis var. niger spores on its surface was placed in a sterile petri dish (60 x 15 mm). 2 grams of Na-CO3-1.5H2O2 complex powder (containing 27.78% wt of H2O2, Fluka) was placed in another petri dish. Both dishes were inserted together into a 100 x 250 mm pouch formed of MYLAR™/MYLAR™. The pouch was sealed and exposed to 60°C (in an oven) for different time periods. The sterility test results are summarized in Table 46C.<br>
Example 47<br>
Sterilization using Na4P2O7-3H2O2 peroxide complex (1 atm and elevated complex heating temperature)<br>
Na4P2O7-3H2O2 (wt % = 27%) was used in the sterilization apparatus shown in FIGURE 8. The sterilization parameters were as follows: size of chamber ~ 6.25" x 6.25" x 7" (4.5 liters); temperature of chamber = 400C; pressure of chamber = 760 torn heating temperature = 175-180°C. 8. stearothermophilus (1.5 x 105/scalpel blade) was used as the inoculant. The results are summarized in Tables 47A and 47B. As evidenced by Table 47A, complete sterilization of the scalpel blades located two inches above the heating apparatus was achieved with just 0.01 g of the complex. In contrast<br>
Example 48<br>
Sterilization using K2C2O4-H2O2 peroxide complex (1 atm and elevated complex heating emperature) K2C204-H20, (wt % = 16.3%) was used in the sterilization apparatus shown in FIGURE 8. The sterilization parameters were as outlined in Example 47, with the exception that the heating temperature was 155-160°C. In this experiment, inoculated scalpel blades were placed only above the heating plate. The results are summarized in Table 48.<br>
*: Cycle Time - Heating time (min.l/total exposure time (mm.)<br>
With the potassium oxalate complex, complete sterilization occurred using 0.01 g with 30 minutes exposure. Complete sterilization was seen with 0.03 g of the complex in all three cycles.<br>
In summary, H2O2 can be released from the complex at a pressure of one atmosphere and at room temperature. This release can be facilitated with elevated temperature and reduced pressure. System for Release of Vapor from Hvdrooen Peroxide Complexes<br>
The apparatus discussed above in connection with FIGURES 7A and 7B can be used in a system for the release of hydrogen peroxide vapor from hydrogen peroxide complexes. Such an apparatus can be used in connection with peroxide complexes formed into disks. Nevertheless, we have found that vapor can be more thoroughly and efficiently released when used in powdered form. Powder can be placed into the apparatus using the same mechanism described above in connection with FIGURES 7A and 7B. However, another method of introduction of powder is accomplished by initially applying the powder to a high temperature adhesive tape. For example, the 3M Corporation manufactures high temperature tape 9469 which makes use of their adhesive A10. The powder can be dusted onto the adhesive and the tape introduced into the chamber for release of hydrogen peroxide vapor. Another exemplary<br>
adhesive tape for this purpose can be formed of 3M tape 9485 with 3M<br>
adhesive A25.<br>
