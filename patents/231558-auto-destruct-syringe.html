Hence, the presently disclosed syringe can be used only once for adjustment of dose of the vaccine and only once for the vaccination.<br>
In accordance to the one of the preferred embodiments of the presently disclosed invention the time to be taken for auto-destruction of the presently disclosed syringe can be pre-decided while manufacturing<br><br>
the presently disclosed syringe, which can further vary depending upon the nature and composition of the vaccine being used.<br>
Now referring to the accompanying figures, the present invention makes a complete disclosure of an auto-destruct syringe 1 comprising of a connecting rod 2, an external body 10 and pellet 11 and optionally a rod 1 la, wherein the said connecting rod 2 is provided with a central and vertical hole 3, one or more of horizontal holes 4, a rubber washer 5 having a hole 6 and preferably another washer 8 and the said connecting rod 2 sits in the said external body 10 of the said syringe 1.<br>
In accordance to the present invention said rubber washer 5 provided with the said hole 6 is made to sit onto the end 7 provided with said central and vertical hole 3 of the said connecting rod 2 and said another washer 8 is made to sit towards another end 9 of the said connecting rod 2 of the presently disclosed syringe 1.<br>
In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the said central and vertical hole 3 extend from said end 7 of the said connecting rod 2 upto certain length 13 of the said rod 2 towards the said end 9 of the said connecting rod 2 and preferably coincides with the said hole 6 provided in the said washer 5. In accordance to the present invention the said pellet 11 is made to sit in the cavity 12 created between said washer 5 and said end 7 of the said connecting rod 2 in such a way that the said pellet 11 is exposed to said hole 6 provided in the said washer 5 on one end and on another end is exposed to said central and vertical hole 3 provided in the said connecting rod 2 of the presently disclosed syringe 1. In accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the said pellet 11 sits properly in the said cavity 12 in such a way that there is no contact of the said hole 6 of the said washer 5 with the said central and vertical hole 3 of the said connecting rod 2 of the syringe 1.<br>
In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention one or more horizontal holes 4 are provided towards the said end 7 of the said connecting rod 2. Further, in accordance to another<br><br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention one or more horizontal holes 4 are provided towards said end 9 of the said connecting rod 2. The horizontal holes 4 provided towards end 7 are hereinafter referred to as hole 4a and are labeled as 4a in the accompanying Figure-1 and horizontal holes 4 provided towards end 9 are hereinafter referred to as 4 and labeled as 4 in order to demarcate between the two. In accordance to the present invention one end of all such holes 4 and 4a opens in the said central and vertical hole 3 provided in the said connecting rod 2 and another end opens in cavity 15a between the said washer 5 and said connecting rod 2 or in cavity 15 created between the said connecting rod 2 and said external body 10 of the said syringe 1.
