				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a lubricating aqueous polyurethane resin composition for surface-lubricated steel strip, which composition is used during press working for home appliances, building materials and the like, and also relates to a surface-treating method using the composition and a product obtained by the method. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, zinc- or zinc alloy-plated steel strips are widely used for home appliances, building materials and the like. These steel strips per se are insufficient in corrosion resistance or coatability and therefore, surface-treated steel strips obtained by applying an undercoat treatment such as chromate chemical conversion treatment and phosphate chemical conversion treatment, and then coating a resin on the surface thereof, are usually used.  These surface-treated steel strips include lubricating steel strips which can be worked without using press oil during press working, and such steel strips are widely used for home appliances and the like.<br>
Conventional techniques regarding lubricating steel strips are disclosed in, for example, Japanese unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2001-214182 (Patent Reference 1), No. 08-267002 (Patent Reference 2) and No. 06-145559 (Patent Reference 3).<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-214182 (Patent Reference 1) discloses a method of forming a coating layer comprising a mixed resin (A) comprising an acryl-styrene-based resin (a) having an acid value of<br><br><br>
less than 10 in an amount of 30 to 95 mass* in terms of the solid content and a polyurethane-based resin (b) in an amount of 5 to 70 mass% in terms of the solid content, and a mixture (B) comprising a chromium compound (c) and wax particles or thermoplastic resin particles (d) having an average particle size of 1 to 5 µm and a melting point higher than the glass transition point of those two resins constituting the mixed resin (A), in an amount of 1 to 7 massl based on the total mass of the mixed resin (A), and having a thickness of 0.5 to 4 µm on at least one surface of a zinciferous metal plated steel strip, the coat layer. Also, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 08-267002 (Patent Reference 2) discloses a method in which a chromate coating is formed in an amount of 10 to 200 mg/m2 in terms of metal chromium per one surface, on both surfaces of a zinc- or zinciferous metal-plated steel strip and, thereon, a resin composition layer comprising a mixed resin which will be explained hereinafter, 5 to 40 parts by mass of a curing agent, 1 to 40 parts by mass of a lubricant having a melting point of 80 to 130°C and 5 to 80 parts by mass of an organic silicon compound is formed in a coating amount of 0.1 to 1.0 g/m2.  The mixed resin contains two or more resins having a plurality of hydroxyl groups and a glass transition temperature of -30 to 90°C, namely, a component comprising at least one resin having a glass transition temperature of -30°C or more but less than 30°C and a component comprising at least one resin having a glass transition temperature of 30 to 90°C, each in a content of 10% by mass or more based on the total mass of the resins.<br>
These techniques all are characterized by using a blend of several types of resins, but when a coating is formed from the blend, these resins can be uniformly distributed in the resultant coating only on rare occasions and the properties of the resultant coating are<br><br><br>
scattered and thus it is difficult to say that the properties of individual resins are sufficiently utilized.  Therefore, the coating prepared by the above-described conventional method cannot fully satisfy the required performances such as lubricity, solvent resistance and corrosion resistance, as pursued by the present inventors.<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 06-145559 (Patent Reference 3) discloses a technique concerning a lubricating, aqueous coating material composition comprising (a) a water-dispersible ether-ester-type polyurethane resin having a bisphenol-type skeleton, an ester skeleton and a carboxyl group and having an average molecular weight of 3,000 or more, (b) a water-soluble or water-dispersible epoxy resin, (c) a polyolefin wax having a melting point of 70 to 160°C and an average particle size of 0.1 to 7.0 µm, and (d) a silica having an average particle size of 3 to 30 µm, wherein a solid content ratio of the total amount of (a) and (b) to the total solid content (e=a+b+c+d) is from 0.50:1 to 0.85:1, the solid content ratio of (c) to (e) is from 0.03:1 to 0.30:1, and the solid content ratio of (d) to (e) is from 0.10:1 to 0.40:1.<br>
According to Patent Reference 3, a crosslinking agent is added to a specific polyurethane resin, to obtain thereby the objective performances of the resin. However, Patent Reference 3 is absolutely silent as to the technique for obtaining performances equal to or greater than those obtained when using a crosslinking agent using a polyurethane resin composition not containing a crosslinking agent.<br>

Publication No. 06-145559, claim 1 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to solve the problem of the prior art, that is, a reduction in the performance due to unevenness of the coating, and to provide an aqueous polyurethane resin composition having excellent lubricity, solvent resistance and corrosion resistance, a method of applying a lubricating treatment to a surface of a zinciferous metal-plated steel strip by using the composition, and a surface-treated steel strip obtained by the method.<br>
As a result of intensive investigations on aqueous chemicals satisfying all of the required lubricity, solvent resistance and corrosion resistance and surface-treated steel strips produced by using the chemicals, the present inventors have found that the above-described problem can be overcome mainly by using a specified urethane resin.  The present invention has been completed based on this finding.<br>
The lubricating aqueous polyurethane resin composition of the present invention is characterized by comprising the following components (a), (b) and (c):<br>
(a)	a polyurethane resin comprising a polyester skeleton moiety and a polyether skeleton moiety and having a tensile strength at break of 3.92 kN/cm2 (400 kgf/cm2) or more and a tensile elongation at break of 50% or less, determined in accordance with to JIS K 7113, and a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 80 to 150°C, determined in accordance with to JIS K 7121,<br>
(b)	fine particles of a polyolefin resin having a melting point of 70 to 160°C and a particle size of 0.5 to 5 urn, and<br>
(c)	a colloidal silica having a particle size of 5 to 50 nm,<br>
wherein, based on the total solid content mass (a+b+c) of said components (a), (b) and (c),<br><br><br>
the solid content ((a)/(a+b+c)) of the component (a) is from 50 to 93% by mass,<br>
the solid content ((b)/(a+b+c)) of the component (b) is from 2 to 20% by mass, and<br>
the solid content ((c)/(a+b+c)) of the component (c) is from 5 to 40% by mass.<br>
In the lubricating aqueous polyurethane resin composition of the present invention, the ratio in mass of the polyester skeleton moiety to the polyether skeleton moiety in the polyurethane resin (a) is preferably in the range of from 1/9 to 5/5.<br>
The method of the present invention for lubricating a zinciferous metal-plated steel strip comprises coating a treating liquid containing the lubricating aqueous polyurethane resin composition as claimed in claim 1 or 2 on a surface of a zinciferous metal-plated metal strip, and drying the coated liquid to form a lubricant layer having a dry solid mass of 0.1 to 5 g/m2.<br>
The surface-lubricated zinciferous metal-plated steel strip of the present invention is one produced by the method for lubricating a zinciferous metal-plated steel strip as mentioned above.<br>
By coating the lubricating aqueous polyurethane resin composition of the present invention on a surface of a zinciferous metal-plated steel sheet, a coating having excellent corrosion resistance, alkali resistance, paint adhesion and lubricity can be formed.<br>
The term "aqueous polyurethane resin composition" used in the present invention refers to —a polyurethane resin composition soluble, dispersible or emulsible in a medium containing water—. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The polyurethane resin (a) contained in the resin composition of the present invention has a tensile strength at break of 3.92 kN/cm2 (400 kgf/cm2) or more, preferably from 4.9 to 9.8 N/cm2, a tensile elongation at break of 50% or less, preferably from 1 to 40%, and a<br><br><br>
glass transition temperature (Tg) of 80 to 150°C (determined in accordance with JIS K 7121) .  In the shaping work typically press working, the resin coating is generally exposed to a strong shear force.  In the case where this shear force surpasses the tensile strength at break of the coating, the coating itself is damaged.  In other words, when the tensile strength at break of the coating is high, this coating is less damaged.  The inventors of the present invention have made intensive studies and found that when the resin coating itself has a tensile strength at break of 3.92 kN/cm2 (400 Kgf/cm2) or more, a tensile elongation at break of 50% or less and Tg of 80 to 150°C, the resultant coating can exhibit the target lubricity.  Incidentally, the tensile strength at break and elongation at break of the polyurethane resin were measured by the procedure such that the resin was coated on a polyester sheet and dried at room temperature for 24 hours to form a coating having a dry thickness of 50 µm, and baked at 150°C for 30 minutes to produce a film, and then this film was gently peeled off from the polyester sheet and subjected to a tensile test.  The tensile test was performed according to JIS K 6732.  The glass transition temperature of the polyurethane resin was measured by using a commercially available dynamic viscoelastometer (Rheograph Solid S-l, manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisaku-Sho, Ltd.).  At this time, a specimen having a film thickness of 100 µm, a width of 8 mm and a length of 30 mm was used after drying at 100°C for 30 minutes, the frequency for measurement was 100 Hz, and the glass transition temperature was determined from the inflection point of loss factor in elastic modulus.<br>
The solid content of the component (a) is from 50 to 93%, preferably from 55 to 90%, more preferably from 50 to 85%, based on the total solid content by mass (a+b+c) of the components (a), (b) and (c).  If the solid content<br><br><br>
of the component (a) is less than 50% based on the total solid content by mass (a+b+c) of the components (a), (b) and (c), the resultant polyurethane resin composition exhibits a low film continuity and thus the resultant polyurethane resin has unsatisfactory workability and adhesion.  Also, if the solid content of the component (a) exceeds 93% based on the total solid content by mass (a+b+c) of the components (a), (b) and (c), the effect obtainable by the addition of the components (b) and (c) is poor and therefore, the resultant coating formed from the polyurethane resin composition exhibits insufficient corrosion resistance and workability.<br>
The polyurethane resin for the component (a) usable for the present invention has a polyester skeleton and a polyether skeleton.  The polyester skeleton is formed from a polyester polyol compound and the polyether skeleton is formed from a polyether polyol.<br>
The polyester polyol compound for the formation of the polyester skeleton is a compound produced for example, by the reaction of low molecular weight polyols for example, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,2-butylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, 1,4-butylene glycol, 3-methylpentanediol, hexamethylene glycol, hydrogenated bisphenol A, trimethylolpropane and glycerin, with polybasic acids, for example, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, trimellitic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic acid and hexahydrophthalic acid, and having an ester structure and terminal hydroxyl groups.<br>
The polyether polyol usable for the formation of the polyether skeleton is preferably a compound produced by an addition reaction of bisphenol skeleton-containing glycols, for example, methylene bisphenol, ethylidene bisphenol, butylidene bisphenol and isopropylidene<br><br><br>
bisphenol with alkylene oxides having 2 to 4 carbon atoms (for example, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and butylene oxide).  The molar number of the addition reacted alkylene oxides is preferably from 1 to 10.<br>
The ratio in mass of the polyester skeleton to the polyether skeleton in the polyurethane resin for the component (a) is preferably in the range of from 1/9 to 5/5 (polyester skeleton/polyether skeleton).  If the mass ratio of the polyester skeleton to the polyether skeleton is less than 1/9 (polyester skeleton/polyether skeleton), the content of the relatively rigid polyether skeleton becomes high and, thus, the elongatability of the coating decreases and, as a result, the resultant coating may be fragile and may exhibit an insufficient tensile strength at break.  Also, if the mass ratio of the polyester skeleton to the polyether skeleton is more than 5/5 (polyester skeleton/polyether skeleton), the content of the relatively soft polyester skeleton becomes high and thus the resultant coating may have a high elongatability and an insufficient tensile strength at break.<br>
The fine particles (b) of the polyolefin resin contained in the polyurethane resin composition of the present invention has a melting point of 70 to 160°C and a particle size of 0.5 to 5 µm.  Generally, the temperature of the shaped article sometimes reaches 80°C during the press shaping procedure.  Therefore, if the melting point of the polyolefin resin fine particles is less than 70°C, the polyolefin resin fine particles contained in the coating formed from the polyurethane resin composition all are all melted during the shaping procedure and a coating having lubricity sufficiently high for the shaping work cannot be obtained. Also, if the melting point of the polyolefin resin fine particles is higher than 160°C, the polyolefin resin fine particles are hardly melted by the sliding frictional heat and thus the resultant coating exhibits an insufficient lubricity at<br><br><br>
the sliding.  Also, if the particle size of the polyolefin resin fine particles is less than 0.5 µm, the resultant resin coating has insufficient lubricity, whereas if the particle size is more than 5.0 µm, the polyolefin resin fine particles readily comes off from the resultant resin coating.  The polyolefin resin fine particles preferably have a true spherical shape so as to obtain a polyurethane resin composition having high-level workability.<br>
The solid content of the component (b) is from 2 to 20%, preferably from 3 to 20%, more preferably from 3 to 18%, based on the total solid content in mass (a+b+c) of the components (a), (b) and (c).  If the solid content of the component (b) is less than 2% based on the total solid content in mass (a+b+c) of the components (a), (b) and (c), the resultant polyurethane resin composition has an insufficient lubricity, and if the solid content of the component (b) is more than 20% based on the total solid content in mass (a+b+c) of the components (a), (b) and (c), a coating formed from the resultant polyurethane resin composition exhibits an insufficient adhesion to an overcoat material applied thereon.<br>
The particle size of the colloidal silica particles for the component (c) is from 5 to 50 run, preferably from 5 to 40 nm, more preferably from 5 to 30 nm.  If the particle size of the colloidal silica particles for the component (c) is more than 50 nm, the coating formed from the resultant polyurethane resin composition has an insufficient uniformity and thus the coating exhibits unsatisfactory corrosion resistance, adhesive properties, etc.  Also, if the particle size of the colloidal silica particles for the component (c) is less than 5 nm, the particles per se are difficult to industrially produce, and thus an economical disadvantage occurs.  The solid content of the component (c) is from 5 to 40%, preferably from 5 to 35%, more preferably from 5 to 30%, based on the total solid content in mass (a+b+c) of the components<br><br><br>
(a), (b) and (c).  If the solid content of the component (c) is less than 5% based on the total solid content in mass (a+b+c) of the components (a), (b) and (c), the effect of the resultant polyurethane resin on enhancing the corrosion resistance is insufficient.  Also, if the solid content of the component (c) is more than 40% based on the total solid content in mass (a+b+c) of the components (a), (b) and (c), the coating formed from the resultant polyurethane resin composition is fragile and exhibits insufficient corrosion resistance, adhesive property and workability.<br>
The aqueous polyurethane resin composition for metal surface treatment of the present invention may contain one or more members selected from a surfactant which is referred to as a wettability-enhancing agent for forming a uniform coating on the surface of a metal material, a thickening agent for adjusting the viscosity, an electrically conducting substance for enhancing the weldability, a colored pigment for enhancing the design property, a rust-preventive additive having inhibitor effect, a metal compound, etc.<br>
There is no limitation to the type of the metal materials for the surface-treating with the lubricating aqueous polyurethane resin composition of the present invention.  Usually, the composition of the present invention it is most advantageously applied to a zinciferous metal-plated steel strips.  The amount of the coating for covering the surface of a zinciferous metal-plated steel strip is from 0.1 to 5.0 g/m2, preferably from 0.2 to 4.0 g/m2, more preferably from 0.3 to 4 g/m2, in terms of the dry mass.  If the dry mass of the coating formed on the surface of a zinciferous metal-plated steel strip is less than 0.1 g/m2, the effect on enhancement of the lubricity of the polyurethane resin composition is insufficient.  Also, if the dry mass of the coating formed on the surface of the zinciferous metal-plated steel strip is more than 5.0 g/m2, the effect on the<br><br><br>
enhancement of the lubricity is saturated and an economical disadvantage occurs.  The method for coating with the treating solution containing the polyurethane resin composition of the present invention includes a roll coater method, a dipping method and an electrostatic coating method but, in the present invention, there is no limitation to the coating method.  Also, there is no limitation to the treatment temperature for the treating solution layer coated or the dry coating thereof. Preferably the peak temperature of the steel strip is controlled in the range of from 100 to 200°C.<br>
Also, with respect to the surface-treated steel strip of the present invention, there is no limitation to the kind and conditions of the pretreatment applied to the zinciferous metal-plated steel strip prior to the lubricating treatment procedure in accordance with the method of the present invention when, for example, a degreasing treatment for keeping the plating layer surface clean, a chromate or phosphate treatment for enhancing the corrosion resistance, or a non-chromate treatment using a treating solution having an excellent rust preventive effect and not containing a chromium-containing compound is applied, the resultant coating film formed from the lubricating polyurethane resin composition can exhibit excellent lubricity and adhesive property. EXAMPLES<br>

230 Parts of a polyester polyol prepared from an<br><br><br>
adipic acid having terminal hydroxyl groups and 1,6-hexanediol, and having an average molecular weight of 1,000, and 15 parts of 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-propionic acid were mixed in 100 parts of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and the resultant mixture was dissolved under heat at 80°C.  To the resultant solution, 100 parts of dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate were mixed and the resultant mixture was subjected to a reaction under heat at 110°C for 2 hours.  The resultant reaction product was neutralized with 11 parts of triethylamine.  The resultant solution was added dropwise with vigorous stirring to an aqueous solution prepared by mixing 5 parts of ethylenediamine with 570 parts of deionized water, to produce an aqueous urethane resin.  This resin had a tensile strength at break of 3.92 kN/cm2 (400 Kgf/cm2), a tensile elongation at break of 400% and a Tg of 30°C.  Also, the ratio in of polyester skeleton to polyether skeleton (polyester skeleton/polyether skeleton) in this polyurethane resin was 10:0. Production Example 5<br>
