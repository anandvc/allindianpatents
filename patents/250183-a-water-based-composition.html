WATER-BASED RESIN COMPOSITION, WEATHER RESISTANCE<br>
IMPROVER FOR WATER-BASED PAINT USING THE SAME, WEATHER<br>
RESISTANCE IMPROVER FOR THERMOPLASTIC RESIN, AND WEATHER<br>
RESISTANCE IMPROVER FOR SOLVENT-BASED PAINT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a water-based resin composition.<br>
Specifically, the present invention relates to a water-based paint, which is<br>
excellent in weather resistance, using the water-based resin composition.<br>
Further, the present invention relates to a weather resistance improver for a<br>
water-based paint using the water-based resin composition, which can sharply<br>
improve weather resistance when added to the water-based paint.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a weather resistance improver for<br>
a thermoplastic resin and a weather resistance improver for a solvent-based<br>
paint, both of which use a resin composition recovered from the water-based<br>
resin composition, and these improvers can sharply improve weather<br>
resistance when added to the thermoplastic resin and the solvent-based paint,<br>
respectively.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
In recent years, there is a strong demand in improving durability of<br>
polymer materials which are used under severe circumstances such as<br>
outdoors from the viewpoints of reducing maintenance cost and reducing<br>
environmental load by saving resources.<br>
Among them, in the field of a paint, it is intended to change from a<br>
solvent-based paint which uses an organic solvent as a medium to a<br>
water-based paint which uses water as a dispersing medium, and the use of<br>
the water-based paint is rapidly expanding. Consequently, demands for the<br>
performance of the water-based paint have become high degree, and<br>
water-based paints having high-degree weather resistance have been<br>
proposed.<br>
For example, there is a description, in Patent Document 1, that a paint,<br>
which is made by copolymerizing an ultraviolet light absorber (hereinafter,<br>
expressed as a "reactive UVA") having an unsaturated double bond, in a<br>
molecule, capable of radical polymerization, with a polymerizable monomer<br>
having a highly hydrophobic cyclohexyl group, having excellent weather<br>
resistance for a long time without showing the bleed out of the UVA component<br>
from the coating film can be obtained.<br>
In Patent Document 2, there is a description that a paint, which is<br>
made by copolymerizing a hindered amine type light stabilizer (hereinafter,<br>
expressed as a "reactive HALS") having an unsaturated double bond in a<br>
molecule and a polymerizable monomer having a highly hydrophobic<br>
cyclohexyl group, having excellent weather resistance for a long time without<br>
showing the bleed out of the HALS component from the coating film can be<br>
obtained. .<br>
Further, in Patent Document 3, there is a description that a paint<br>
composed of an emulsion obtained by copolymerizing a reactive HALS at the<br>
last stage of a multistage emulsion polymerization in the presence of a silane<br>
coupling agent having a cyclohexyl group is excellent in compatibility and film<br>
formability, and excellent weather resistance for a long time can be obtained.<br>
[0003]<br>
Further, in the field of a water-based paint, investigations concerning a<br>
weather resistance improver have been carried out to improve only weather<br>
resistance of a water-based paint with relatively low weather resistance, which<br>
has been conventionally used, without changing physical properties of the<br>
water-based paint. However, as to the water-based paint, there has been a<br>
problem, in stability of quality of the water-based paint, in which, for example,<br>
the weather resistance improver comes to bleed with time on the upper layer<br>
when the weather resistance improver is added because the main medium of<br>
the water-based paint is water. Further, there has been a problem that the<br>
water-based paint does not realize sufficient performance even in the case of<br>
forming a film using the water-based paint right after it is stirred because it is<br>
difficult to homogeneously disperse the weather resistance improver.<br>
As countermeasures to these problems, in Patent Document 4, a<br>
technology has been proposed, in which a nonreactive UVA or a nonreactive<br>
HALS which does not have an unsaturated double bond in a molecule is<br>
previously dispersed in water using an emulsifier and then the resultant<br>
dispersion is added to the water-based paint to improve weather resistance of<br>
the water-based paint.<br>
Further, in the field of a thermoplastic resin to be used for automobiles<br>
and building materials, a weather resistance improver such as HALS, UVA, or<br>
an antioxidant in accordance with characteristics of each thermoplastic resin<br>
has been proposed. However, in the case of the weather resistance improver<br>
having relatively low molecular mass, it is difficult to maintain capability for<br>
improving weather resistance for a long time owing to bleed out of the weather<br>
resistance improver with time, which results in concentration lowering of the<br>
weather resistance improver in a base material. To solve such a problem, a<br>
polymer type weather resistance improver has been proposed. In Patent<br>
Document 5, a technology of improving weather resistance of a thermoplastic<br>
resin has been proposed, in which a reactive UVAand a reactive HALS are<br>
copolymerized in high concentration in an organic solvent and the resultant<br>
mixture is reprecipitated in a poor solvent to recover the polymer type weather<br>
resistance improver which is then compounded into the thermoplastic resin.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]<br>
However, when these proposals were evaluated from the viewpoint of<br>
a water-based paint having high-degree weather resistance, a water-based<br>
paint with insufficient weather resistance, the value of which was about 4,000<br>
hours in terms of the value obtained by an accelerated test of a sunshine<br>
weatherometer, was merely obtained according to the method of Patent<br>
Document 1. Further, according to the method of Patent Document 2, the<br>
emulsifier to be used was restricted because the polymerization stability is<br>
degraded owing to the occurrence of emulsion polymerization of an<br>
unsaturated monomer containing an acidic functional group (hereinafter,<br>
expressed as an "acid component") and the reactive HALS at the same<br>
polymerization stage. Further, in this case, radical scavenging capability of a<br>
HALS component was lowered by the acid component, because the acid<br>
component was copolymerized, and hence weather resistance of the<br>
water-based paint thus obtained was insufficient. According to the method of<br>
Patent Document 3, the acid component was first copolymerized in the inside,<br>
then neutralized, and then the reactive HALS was copolymerized at the final<br>
stage so that polymerization stability was excellent, however, weather<br>
resistance of the water-based paint thus obtained was insufficient for the same<br>
reason as in the case of Patent Document 2 owing to the copolymerized acid<br>
component.<br>
Further, when these proposals were evaluated from the viewpoint of a<br>
weather resistance improver for water-based paints, according to the method<br>
of Patent Document 4, it was difficult to maintain weather resistance of a<br>
coating film for a long time because bleed out of a weather resistance improver<br>
with time from the coating film occurred owing to low molecular mass of the<br>
weather resistance improver. Further, when an emulsion obtained by the<br>
method of Patent Document 3 was used as a weather resistance improver,<br>
capability for improving weather resistance of the weather resistance improver<br>
was insufficient because diffusibility of the HALS component at the time of film<br>
forming was low and radical scavenging capability of the HALS component<br>
was lowered, owing to mutual interaction of the acid component and the HALS<br>
component in an emulsion particle.<br>
Further, when these proposals were evaluated from the viewpoint of a<br>
weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins, according to the method<br>
of Patent Document 4, the weather resistance improver was produced by<br>
extremely complicated method, in which the weather resistance improver was<br>
recovered by reprecipitation after solution polymerization, which caused<br>
problems in industrial production. Further, there remained a very small<br>
amount of an organic solvent in the recovered material, which caused a<br>
problem in the use where control of high-degree odor level was required.<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned<br>
circumstances and a purpose of the present invention is to provide a<br>
water-based resin which can be used not only as a water-based paint having<br>
high-degree weather resistance but also, when added to another water-based<br>
paint, as a weather resistance improver which can drastically improve the<br>
weather resistance of the other water-based paint to which the weather<br>
resistance improver has been added.<br>
Further, another purpose of the present invention is to provide a<br>
weather resistance improver which, when added to various thermoplastic<br>
resins and solvent-based paints, can improve their weather resistance.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
[0006]<br>
One aspect of the present invention resides in a water-based resin<br>
composition containing a copolymer (A) which is obtained by carrying out<br>
emulsion polymerization of an unsaturated monomer composed of 0.5 to 50<br>
parts by mass of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a), represented by the<br>
following general formula (I), having a piperidyl group in a molecule and 50 to<br>
99.5 parts by mass of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer (b), which does<br>
not substantially contain an ethylenically unsaturated monomer having a<br>
functional group represented by the following formula (II), (III), or (IV) in a<br>
molecule, with the total of the unethylenically unsaturated monomers (a) and<br>
(b) being 100 parts by mass, under the coexistence of 0.1 to 10 parts by mass<br>
of an emulsifier,<br>
[Formula I]<br><br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 2 carbon<br>
atoms, X represents an oxygen atom or an imino group, Y represents a<br>
hydrogen atom or an alkyl or alkoxyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and Z<br>
represents a hydrogen atom or a cyano group.<br>
-COOH .....(II)<br>
-SO3H .....(Ill)<br>
-PO3H .....(IV)<br>
[0007]<br>
Another aspect of the present invention resides in a weather resistance<br>
improver for water-based paints and a water-based paint both of which contain<br>
the foregoing water-based resin composition.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention resides in a resin composition<br>
obtained by recovering solid matter in the foregoing water-based resin<br>
composition.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention resides in a weather resistance<br>
improver for thermoplastic resins and a weather resistance improver for<br>
solvent-based paints both of which include the foregoing resin composition.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]<br>
The water-based resin composition of the present invention needs to<br>
be the one in which the content of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a)<br>
represented by the general formula (I) is 0.5 to 50 parts by mass, provided that<br>
the total amount of the unsaturated monomers at the time of polymerization is<br>
100 parts by mass. When the content of the ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer (a) is 0.5 parts by mass or more, weather resistance of a coating film<br>
obtained by using the water-based resin composition alone as a water-based<br>
paint is largely improved. Further, the content of the ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer (a) needs to be 50 parts by mass or less from the viewpoints of<br>
polymerization stability and storage stability. Further, the content of the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a) is preferably 6 to 50 parts by mass in<br>
the use in which high-degree pigment dispersibility or designability such as<br>
matt is required as a coating film. When the content of the ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer (a) is within this range, pigment dispersibility and<br>
resin-beads dispersibility can be improved and hence excellent finish can be<br>
obtained in the uses of clear paints and paints with various pigments.<br>
Further, when the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention is used as a weather resistance improver which is added to another<br>
water-based paint to improve its weather resistance, the content of the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a) is preferably 6 to 50 parts by mass,<br>
provided that the total amount of the unsaturated monomers at the time of<br>
polymerization is 100 parts by mass, from the viewpoints of compatibility with a<br>
polymer which constitutes the other water-based paint to which the weather<br>
resistance improver for water-based paints is added and realization of weather<br>
resistance of a coating film. When the content of the ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer (a) is within this range, the weather resistance of the<br>
water-based paint can be largely improved without any large changes in<br>
physical properties of paint and physical properties of coating film of the<br>
water-based paint obtained by adding a small amount of the weather<br>
resistance improver for water-based paints. The content of the ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer (a) is more preferably 20 to 50 parts by mass.<br>
Further, when solid matter is recovered from the water-based resin<br>
composition of the present invention and used also as a weather resistance<br>
improver for thermoplastic resins, the content of the ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer (a) is preferably 6 to 50 parts by mass, provided that the total amount<br>
of the unsaturated monomers is 100 parts by mass. When the content of the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a) is within this range, the weather<br>
resistance of a thermoplastic resin can be largely improved without any large<br>
changes in physical properties and moldability of the thermoplastic resin by<br>
adding a small amount of the weather resistance improver for thermoplastic<br>
resins to the thermoplastic resin. The amount of use of the ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer (a) is more preferably 20 to 50 parts by mass.<br>
Further, when solid matter is recovered from the water-based resin<br>
composition of the present invention and also used also as a weather<br>
resistance improver for solvent-based paints, the content of the ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer (a) is preferably 6 to 50 parts by mass, provided that the<br>
total amount of the unsaturated monomers is 100 parts by mass. When the<br>
content of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a) is within this range, the<br>
weather resistance of a solvent-based paint can be largely improved without<br>
any large changes in physical properties of the solvent-based paint and<br>
physical properties of the coating film by adding a small amount of the weather<br>
resistance improver for solvent-based paints to the solvent-based paint. The<br>
amount of use of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a) is more preferably<br>
20 to 50 parts by mass.<br>
[0009]<br>
As the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a), the one having a<br>
stabilizing function for ultraviolet light can be used, and for example,<br>
4-(meth)acryloyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine,<br>
4-(meth)acryloylamino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine,<br>
4-(meth)acryloyloxy-1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidine,<br>
4-(meth)acryloylamino-1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidine, or<br>
4-cyano-4-(meth)acryloyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine can be listed.<br>
These monomers can be used alone or in combination of two or more<br>
kinds when it is needed. When a methacrylate monomer in which R1 in the<br>
general formula (I) is a methyl group is used alone or in combination of two or<br>
more kinds as the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a), a drastic improving<br>
effect on weather resistance can be obtained in the case that the water-based<br>
resin composition of the present invention is used as the weather resistance<br>
improver for water-based paints, and, therefore, the methacrylate is preferable.<br>
[0010]<br>
An ethylenically unsaturated monomer (b) is the one which does not<br>
substantially contain an ethylenically unsaturated monomer having an acidic<br>
functional group represented by the formula (II), (III), or (IV) in a molecule<br>
(hereinafter, expressed as an "acid monomer"). The expression "does not<br>
substantially contain an ethylenically unsaturated monomer" means that the<br>
content of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer is less than 0.1 %. When<br>
the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (b) does not substantially contain the<br>
acid monomer, stability of emulsion polymerization is largely improved.<br>
Further, lowering of diffusibility and radical scavenging capability of a HALS<br>
component caused by mutual interaction of the acidic functional group and the<br>
HALS component in a coating film can be suppressed.<br>
[0011]<br>
As the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (b), for example, an alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate having an alkyl group with 1 to 12 carbon atoms such as methyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, n-propyl (meth)acrylate, i-propyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, i-butyl (meth)acrylate, sec-butyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, t-butyl acrylate, n-amyl (meth)acrylate, i-amyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
n-hexyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, n-octyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
nonyl (meth)acrylate, decyl (meth)acrylate, dodecyl (meth)acrylate, lauryl<br>
(meth)acrylate, or stearyl (meth)acrylate; a cycloalkyl (meth)acrylate such as<br>
cycloalkyl (meth)acrylate or p-t-butylcyclohexyl (meth)acrylate; a radical<br>
polymerizable monomer containing hydroxyl group such as 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, 2-(3-)hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, 4-hydroxybutyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, or glycerol mono(meth)acrylate; a polymerizable monomer<br>
containing a nitrogen atom such as (meth)acrylamide, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, vinylpyridine, or vinylimidazol; a halogen containing monomer<br>
such as vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, vinyl fluoride, vinylidene fluoride, or<br>
tetrafluoroethylene; an aromatic monomer such as styrene, a-methylstyrene,<br>
or vinyltoluene; a vinyl ester such as vinylacetate; a vinyl ether; or a<br>
polymerizable cyano compound such as (meth)acrylonitrile can be used. The<br>
foregoing ethylenically unsaturated monomer (b) can be used alone or in<br>
combination of two or more kinds.<br>
When the water-based resin composition of the present invention is<br>
used as a water-based paint, a (meth)acrylate type unsaturated monomer is<br>
preferably used from the viewpoint of weather resistance of the water-based<br>
resin.<br>
Further, when the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention is used as a weather resistance improver for water-based paints, it is<br>
most preferable to use main monomers, which give the water-based paints,<br>
alone or in combination of two or more kinds, in accordance with the<br>
water-based paints to which the weather resistance improver is added from the<br>
viewpoint of maintaining various characteristics of the water-based paints.<br>
Among them, it is preferable to use a (meth)acrylate type unsaturated<br>
monomer from the viewpoint of improving weather resistance of the<br>
water-based paints containing the weather resistance improver for<br>
water-based paints of the present invention.<br>
Further, when a resin composition obtained by recovering solid matter<br>
from the water-based resin composition of the present invention is used as a<br>
weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins or a weather resistance<br>
improver for solvent-based paints, it is preferable to use main monomers,<br>
which constitute the thermoplastic resins or the solvent-based paints, alone or<br>
in combination of two or more kinds, in accordance with the kinds of the<br>
thermoplastic resins or the solvent-based paints to which the weather<br>
resistance improver is added from the viewpoint of improving various<br>
characteristics of the thermoplastic resins or the solvent-based paints.<br>
[0012]<br>
When the water-based resin composition of the present invention is<br>
used as a water-based paint, a weather resistance improver for water-based<br>
paints, a weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins or a weather<br>
resistance improver for solvent-based paints, deterioration of a resin and a<br>
HALS component can be suppressed and weather resistance or capability for<br>
improving weather resistance can be improved in any of the above uses, in the<br>
case that an unsaturated monomer having an ultraviolet light absorbing group<br>
represented by the following general formula (V), (VI), or (VII) in a molecule<br>
(hereinafter, expressed as a " reactive UVA") is used as one component of the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer (b).<br>
However, when a large amount of the reactive UVA is copolymerized,<br>
there is a case that polymerization stability in an emulsion polymerization is<br>
lowered or that transparency of a coating film is lowered. Consequently, when<br>
the reactive UVA is used as one component of the ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer (b), it is preferable that the reactive UVA be copolymerized in an<br>
optimum range in accordance with the use of the water-based resin<br>
composition of the present invention.<br>
For example, when the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention is used as the water-based paint, the amount of the reactive UVA is<br>
preferably 2 parts by mass or less to 100 parts by mass of the total amount of<br>
the unsaturated monomers at the time of polymerization. When the amount<br>
of the reactive UVA is 2 parts by mass or less, yellowness of a coating film is<br>
low and a coating film realizing high-degree weather resistance can be<br>
obtained. Further, when the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention is used as a weather resistance improver for water-based paints or a<br>
weather resistance improver for solvent-based paints, the amount of the<br>
reactive UVA is preferably within the range of from 5 to 20 parts by mass,<br>
provided that the total amount of the unsaturated monomers at the time of<br>
polymerization is 100 parts by mass. When the amount of the reactive UVA is<br>
5 parts by mass or more, sufficient effects on absorbing ultraviolet light and on<br>
improving weather resistance of the paint to which the water-based resin<br>
composition has been added can be obtained with a small amount of addition<br>
of the water-based resin composition, without changing various properties of<br>
the paint. Further, when the amount of the reactive UVA is 20 parts by mass<br>
or less, polymerization stability can be secured, and moreover, coloring of the<br>
coating film of the paint to which the water-based resin composition has been<br>
added can be evaded.<br>
[0013]<br>
In the case that the reactive UVA is copolymerized within the above<br>
range and the resultant water-based resin composition of the present invention<br>
is used as the weather resistance improver for water-based paints, mass<br>
average molecular mass (Mw) of the copolymer (A) is particularly preferably<br>
within the range of from 5,000 to 300,000. When the mass average molecular<br>
mass (Mw) is 300,000 or less, diffusibility of the UVA component is improved<br>
and coloring property of the coating film is further improved in the course of<br>
forming films of the water-based paints to which the weather resistance<br>
improver for water-based paints of the present invention is added. When the<br>
mass average molecular mass (Mw) is 5,000 or more, bleed out of the UVA<br>
component from the coating film can be suppressed and capability for<br>
improving weather resistance for a long time can be given. The most<br>
preferable mass average molecular mass of the copolymer (A) is from 5,000 to<br>
200,000.<br>
Further, in the case that a resin composition obtained by recovering<br>
powder of the water-based resin composition of the present invention is used<br>
as the weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins, the amount of the<br>
reactive UVA is preferably 20 parts by mass or less, provided that the total<br>
amount of the unsaturated monomers at the time of polymerization is 100 parts<br>
by mass. When the amount of the reactive UVA is 20 parts by mass or less,<br>
sufficient polymerization stability can be obtained.<br>

[0015]<br>
The water-based resin composition of the present invention has to be<br>
subjected to emulsion polymerization in the presence of 0.1 to 10 parts by<br>
mass of an emulsifier to 100 parts by mass of the total amount of the<br>
unsaturated monomers at the time of polymerization. When the amount of<br>
the emulsifier is 0.1 parts by mass or more, polymerization stability and<br>
mechanical stability are improved. Further, when the amount of the emulsifier<br>
is 10 parts by mass or less, water resistance of a coating film is not lowered in<br>
the case that the water-based resin composition of the present invention is<br>
used as a water-based paint or a weather resistance improver for water-based<br>
paints. When 6 parts by mass or more of the reactive HALS is polymerized,<br>
the amount of the emulsifier is preferably 1 part by mass or more in point of<br>
polymerization stability. Further, in order to give further high-degree water<br>
resistance to the coating film, the amount of the emulsifier to be used is<br>
preferably 8 parts by mass or less.<br>
[0016]<br>
As the emulsifiers to be used, conventionally known various anion or<br>
nonion emulsifiers, or polymer emulsifiers, or the like can be listed. Further,<br>
when a reactive emulsifier having a radical polymerizable unsaturated double<br>
bond in a molecule is used, higher-degree water resistance and weather<br>
resistance can be given to the coating film in the case that the water-based<br>
resin composition of the present invention is used as a water-based paint or a<br>
weather resistance improver for water-based paints.<br>
In the case that furthermore higher-degree water resistance and<br>
weather resistance is desired to be given, it is preferable to use a reactive<br>
anion emulsifier as the emulsifier. Further, in the case of the use in which, in<br>
particular, high mechanical stability is needed, it is more preferable to jointly<br>
use a reactive anion emulsifier and a reactive nonion emulsifier. Further, in<br>
the case of the jointly using, the ratio of the reactive anion emulsifier to the<br>
reactive nonion emulsifier is particularly preferably 8/2 to 2/8 (mass ratio).<br>
The unsaturated monomer of the present invention does not contain the<br>
reactive emulsifier.<br>
[0017]<br>
As the nonreactive emulsifier, an anion emulsifier such as "Newcol<br>
560SF", "Newcol 562SF", "Newcol 707SF", "Newcol 707SN", "Newcol 714SF",<br>
"Newcol 723SF", "Newcol 740SF", "Newcol 2308SF", "Newcol 2320SN",<br>

Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd.), or an anion emulsifier such as "Nonipol 200" or<br>
"Newpol PE-68" (each one is a trade name and manufactured by Sanyo<br>
Chemical Industries, Ltd.) can be listed.<br>
As the polymer emulsifier, for example, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyhydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, polyhydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, or<br>
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) can be listed.<br>
[0018]<br>
As the reactive emulsifier, for example, a reactive anion emulsifier<br>
such as "Antox MS-60" or "Antox MS-2N" (each one is a trade name and<br>
manufactured by Nippon Nyukazai Co., Ltd.), "Eleminol JS-2" (a trade name<br>
and manufactured by Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd.), "Latemul S-120",<br>

name and manufactured by Kao Corporation), "Adeka Reasoap SR-10" or<br>
"Adeka Reasoap SE-10" (each one is a trade name and manufactured by<br>
Asahi Denka Kogyo K.K.), "Aquaron KH-05", "Aquaron KH-10", or"Aquaron<br>
HS-10" (each one is a trade name and manufactured by Dai-ichi Kogyo<br>
Seiyaku Co., Ltd.), or a reactive nonion emulsifier such as "Adeka Reasoap<br>
NE-10", "Adeka Reasoap ER-10", "Adeka Reasoap NE-20", "Adeka Reasoap<br>
ER-20", "Adeka Reasoap NE-30", "Adeka Reasoap ER-30", "Adeka Reasoap<br>
NE-40", or "Adeka Reasoap ER-40" (each one is a trade name and<br>

RN-20", "Aquaron RN-30", or "Aquaron RN-50" (each one is a trade name and<br>
manufactured by Dai-ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd.) can be listed. They can be<br>
used alone or in combination of two or more kinds when it is needed.<br>
[0019]<br>
When a monomer having a functional group with capability of radical<br>
trapping in its side chain such as the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a) is<br>
subjected to emulsion polymerization, the resulting copolymer (A) forms a<br>
crosslinked structure, in the case that the concentration of the ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer (a) exceeds a certain amount. The water-based resin<br>
composition of the present invention may have a crosslinked structure or a<br>
noncrosslinked structure, however, it has preferably a noncrosslinked structure<br>
or a low-crosslinked structure, and particularly preferably a noncrosslinked<br>
structure. This is because, when the water-based resin composition of the<br>
present invention alone is used as a water-based paint, for example, film<br>
formability is improved and, as a result, water resistance and weather<br>
resistance of the coating film are improved, though it depends on coating<br>
conditions in the case that the copolymer (A) has the noncrosslinked structure<br>
or the low-crosslinked structure.<br>
In the case that the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention is used as a weather resistance improver for water-based paints or in<br>
the case that a resin composition recovered from the water-based resin<br>
composition is used as a weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins,<br>
improving effect on weather resistance can be realized in a wider range of<br>
water-based paints or thermoplastic resins because diffusibility of a HALS<br>
component to the resin to which the HALS component is added is improved by<br>
making the water-based resin composition or the resin composition have a<br>
noncrosslinked structure or a low-crosslinked structure. Further, it is<br>
preferable for a weather resistance improver for solvent-based paints to have a<br>
noncrosslinked structure.<br>
[0020]<br>
As a measure for making the copolymer (A) to a polymer having a<br>
low-crosslinked structure or a noncrosslinked structure, polymerization under<br>
the coexistence of a chain transfer agent is also effective as well as a method<br>
of increasing the amount of an initiator. Among them, in the case of the<br>
water-based resin composition of the present invention, it is preferable to carry<br>
out emulsion polymerization of the unsaturated monomers in the presence of<br>
0.1 to 10 parts by mass of the chain transfer agent to 100 parts by mass of the<br>
total amount of the unsaturated monomers at the time of polymerization.<br>
When the amount of the chain transfer agent is 0.1 parts by mass or more,<br>
crosslinking density can be lowered. When the amount of the chain transfer<br>
agent exceeds 10 parts by mass, it is not preferable because a large amount of<br>
the unreacted chain transfer agent remains in the polymer thus obtained and<br>
Mw is drastically lowered. The more preferable range of the amount of the<br>
chain transfer agent is 0.1 to 5 parts by mass in point of resistance to bleed out<br>
and weather resistance.<br>
As the chain transfer agent, a publicly known chain transfer agent like<br>
a mercaptan-based chain transfer agent such as n-dodecyl mercaptan,<br>
t-dodecyl mercaptan, n-octyl mercaptan, n-tetradecyl mercaptan, n-hexyl<br>
mercaptan, or n-butyl mercaptan; a halogen compound such as<br>
tetrachlorocarbon, or bromoethylene; a disulfide compound such as diphenyl<br>
disulfide; or a-methylstyrene dimer can be used. These agents can be used<br>
alone or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
[0021]<br>
Further, mass average molecular mass (hereinafter, expressed as<br>
"Mw") of the copolymer (A) constituting the water-based resin composition of<br>
the present invention is not particularly limited, however, it is preferably within<br>
the range of from 5,000 to 300,000 in accordance with the use of the<br>
water-based resin composition of the present invention. For example, when<br>
the present water-based resin composition is used as a weather resistance<br>
improver for water-based paints, capability for improving weather resistance<br>
can be realized in more kinds of water-based paints, provided that Mw of the<br>
copolymer (A) is within this range. When the Mw of the copolymer (A) is<br>
5,000 or more, bleed out of the copolymer (A) from the coating film obtained by<br>
forming a water-based paint containing the weather resistance improver for<br>
water-based paints of the present invention into a film can be suppressed and<br>
a weather resistance over a long period of time can be held. When the Mw of<br>
the copolymer (A) is 300,000 or less, diffusibility of the HALS component in a<br>
film forming process is improved in the case that the weather resistance<br>
improver for water-based paints of the present invention is added to<br>
water-based paints in a wide range, and as a result, capability for improving<br>
weather resistance of the weather resistance improver for water-based paints<br>
and weather resistance of the coating film composed of the water-based paint<br>
to which the weather resistance improver is added are improved.<br>
[0022]<br>
Further, when solid matter is recovered from the water-based resin<br>
composition of the present invention and used as a weather resistance<br>
improver for thermoplastic resins or a weather resistance improver for<br>
solvent-based paints, the Mw of the copolymer (A) is preferably within the<br>
range of from 5,000 to 300,000 because of the same reason as [that] in the<br>
case of the weather resistance improver for water-based paints.<br>
Further, when the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention alone is used alone as a water-based paint, the Mw of the copolymer<br>
(A) is preferably 20,000 or more, and more preferably within the range of from<br>
20,000 to 300,000. When the Mw of the copolymer (A) is 20,000 or more,<br>
weather resistance of the coating film can maintain sufficient weather<br>
resistance. When the Mw of the copolymer (A) is 300,000 or less, film<br>
formability is further improved and high water resistance and weather<br>
resistance can be obtained. When the water-based resin composition of the<br>
present invention is used as the water-based paint, the more preferable Mw of<br>
the copolymer (A) is within the range of from 50,000 to 300,000.<br>
[0023]<br>
Further, when the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention is used as the water-based paint and the weather resistance<br>
improver for water-based paints, the minimum film forming temperature<br>
(hereinafter, expressed as "MFT") measured by the method according to "JIS K<br>
6828 5.11" is preferably 70°C or below. When the MFT is exceeding 70°C,<br>
there is a case that film formability is inferior when the water-based resin<br>
composition is used as the water-based paint, and sufficient water resistance<br>
and weather resistance cannot be obtained with regard to the resultant coating<br>
film. Further, when the water-based resin composition is used as the weather<br>
resistance improver for water-based paints, it is apprehended that sufficient<br>
diffusibility of the HALS component cannot be obtained in the course of a film<br>
forming process of the water-based paint containing the weather resistance<br>
improver for water-based paints of the present invention, and weather<br>
resistance cannot be sufficiently improved with regard to the resultant coating<br>
film. The most preferable MFT is 50°C or below.<br>
[0024]<br>
Further, the glass transition temperature (hereinafter, expressed as<br>
"Tg") of the copolymer (A) which constitutes the water-based resin composition<br>
of the present invention is not particularly limited, however, it is preferable to<br>
change the Tg in accordance with the use of the water-based resin<br>
composition. For example, in the case that the water-based resin<br>
composition of the present invention is used as a water-based paint and a<br>
weather resistance improver for water-based paints or a weather resistance<br>
improver for solvent-based paints, the Tg of the copolymer (A) is preferably<br>
100°C or below. When the Tg of the copolymer (A) is 100°C or below, the<br>
water-based paint containing the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention has good film formability and does not lower water resistance or<br>
weather resistance of the resultant coating film. The Tg of the copolymer (A)<br>
is preferably 70°C or below, and more preferably 50°C or below. Further, in<br>
the case that the water-based resin composition of the present invention is<br>
used as a weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins, the Tg of the<br>
copolymer (A) is preferably 50°C or above. When the Tg of the copolymer (A)<br>
is 50°C or above, it becomes easy to maintain the primary particle structure of<br>
solid matter at the time of recovering the solid matter, and good dispersibility of<br>
the weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins into the thermoplastic<br>
resins can be secured. The Tg of the copolymer (A) is more preferably 70°C<br>
or above. In the case that the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention is used as a weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins, it<br>
is particularly preferable that a multistage polymerization be adopted at the<br>
time of emulsion polymerization and a copolymer having a high Tg be formed<br>
at the outermost layer in point of powder characteristics. As the foregoing Tg,<br>
a calculated glass transition temperature obtained by the Fox equation is used.<br>
The Fox equation is a relation equation of a glass transition temperature (°C) of<br>
a copolymer and glass transition temperatures (°C) of homopolymers obtained<br>
by independently homopolymerizing respective comonomers of the copolymer<br>
as shown below.<br>
1/(273 + Tg) = Z (Wi/(273 + Tgi))<br>
(In the above equation, Wi represents a mass ratio of a monomer i and Tgi<br>
represents a Tg (°C) of a homopolymer of the monomer i.)<br>
As the Tg of each homopolymer, concretely, the values described in<br>
"Polymer Handbook 3rd Edition" (Wiley-lnterscience Publication, 1989) can be<br>
used.<br>
[0025]<br>
The water-based resin composition of the present invention can be<br>
produced, for example, by emulsion polymerization with a radical<br>
polymerization initiator using the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a), the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer (b), and an emulsifier in a water medium.<br>
The particle structure of the copolymer (A) constituting the water-based resin<br>
composition of the present invention may be a monolayered structure or a<br>
multilayered structure, however, in the case of the multilayered structure, a<br>
three-layered structure or less is preferable from the viewpoints of production<br>
efficiency and particle diameter control. Further, in the case of the<br>
multilayered structure, it may be carried out, for example, to polymerize the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer (b) in the first step and then polymerize the<br>
mixture of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a) and the ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer (b) in the second step or later or to polymerize the<br>
mixture of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers (a) and (b) in the first step<br>
and then polymerize the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (b) in the second<br>
step or later. It may be carried out to polymerize a mixture containing these<br>
two monomers in the first step and then polymerize a mixture containing these<br>
two monomers in a different ratio in the second step or later. In these cases,<br>
the concentration of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a) in each step is<br>
preferably 50 parts by mass or less, provided that the total amount of the<br>
monomers in respective steps is 100 parts by mass. When the concentration<br>
of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a) exceeds 50 parts by mass in<br>
each step, polymerization stability of the step is lowered, and it is not<br>
preferable.<br>
[0026]<br>
As the polymerization initiator for polymerizing the water-based resin<br>
composition of the present invention, the one to be generally used in a radical<br>
polymerization can be used, a concrete example of which includes a persulfate<br>
such as potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate, or ammonium persulfate; an<br>
oil-soluble azo compound such as azobisisobutyronitrile,<br>
2,2'-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile), 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile),<br>
2,2'-azobis(4-methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), or<br>
2-phenylazo-4-methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile; a water-soluble azo<br>
compound such as<br>
2,2'-azobis{2-methyl-N-[1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]propionamide},<br>
2,2'-azobis{2-methyl-N-[2-(1-hydroxyethyl)]propionamide},<br>
2,2'-azobis{2-methyl-N-[2-(1 -hydroxybutyl)]propionamide},<br>
2,2'-azobis[2-(5-methyl-2-imidazolin-2-il)propane] or its salt,<br>
2,2'-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-il)propane] or its salt,<br>
2,2'-azobis[2-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-2-il)propane] or its salt,<br>
2,2'-azobis{2-[1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-imidazolin-2-il]propane} or its salt,<br>
2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) or its salt,<br>
2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropinamidine) or its salt, or<br>
2,2'-azobis[N-(2-carboxyethyl)-2-methylpropionamidine] or its salt; or an<br>
organic peroxide such as benzoyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl<br>
hydroperoxide, t-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, or t-butyl peroxyisobutylate<br>
can be listed. These initiators can be used alone or in combination of two or<br>
more kinds. Further, when promotion of polymerization speed or<br>
polymerization at low temperature, namely 70°C or below, is desired, it is<br>
advantageous to jointly use a reducing agent, for example, sodium bisulfite,<br>
ferrous sulfate, or an ascorbate and a radical polymerization catalyst. The<br>
amount of addition of the radical polymerization initiator is usually within the<br>
range of from 0.01 to 10 parts by mass to the total amount of ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomers, and is particularly preferably 0.05 to 5 parts by mass in<br>
consideration of progress of the polymerization or control of the reaction.<br>
[0027]<br>
Further, the particle diameter of the polymer particle constituting the<br>
water-based resin composition of the present invention is not particularly<br>
limited, however, it is preferable to select the optimum particle diameter in<br>
accordance with the use of the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention. As an average particle diameter, the one of cumulant analysis<br>
obtained by the measurement at 25°C of the sample which was adjusted to 1%<br>
concentration, using "Fiber-Optics Particle Analyzer with Autosampler<br>
FPAR-1000" manufactured by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd. was adopted.<br>
For example, in the case that the water-based resin composition of the<br>
present invention alone is used as a water-based paint, the average particle<br>
diameter is preferably in the range of from 30 to 200 nm. When the average<br>
particle diameter is 30 nm or more, polymerization stability is improved and<br>
hence the amount of an emulsifier to be used, which may be an important<br>
factor of lowering of water resistance of the coating film, can be reduced.<br>
When the average particle diameter is 200 nm or less, film formability of the<br>
water-based paint is improved and hence various physical properties such as<br>
water resistance and weather resistance of the coating film are improved.<br>
Further, in the case that the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention is used as a weather resistance improver for water-based paints, the<br>
average particle diameter is preferably in the range of from 30 to 300 nm.<br>
When the average particle diameter is 300 nm or less, diffusibility of the<br>
weather resistance improver for water-based paints of the present invention<br>
into the coating film is improved and hence high-degree improving<br>
performance of weather resistance can be obtained owing to the HALS<br>
component diffused in the coating film. As the average particle diameter, it is<br>
more preferably 170 nm or less, and particularly preferably 140 nm or less.<br>
Further, the average particle diameter is preferably 30 nm or more in order to<br>
prevent lowering of water resistance of the coating film caused by an increase<br>
in the emulsifier. Further, in the case that a resin composition obtained by<br>
recovering solid matter in the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention is used as a weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins or<br>
a weather resistance improver for solvent-based paints, the average particle<br>
diameter is preferably 30 nm or more. When the average particle diameter is<br>
30 nm or more, polymerization stability is improved.<br>
[0028]<br>
The solid matter concentration (hereinafter, expressed as "NV") of the<br>
water-based resin composition of the present invention is not particularly<br>
limited, however, it is preferably within the range of from 30 to 70 parts by mass.<br>
In the case that the water-based resin composition of the present invention is<br>
used as a water-based paint, sufficient film formability can be obtained and<br>
hence appearance of the coating film is excellent, provided that the NV is 30<br>
parts by mass or more. Further, in the case that the water-based resin<br>
composition of the present invention is used as a weather resistance improver<br>
for water-based paints, physical properties of paint of the water-based paint to<br>
which the weather resistance improver for water-based paints has been added<br>
can be maintained. Further, recovery efficiency of the solid matter in the<br>
recovery step of the solid matter in the case of using the water-based resin<br>
composition of the present invention as a weather resistance improver for<br>
thermoplastic resins or a weather resistance improver for solvent-based paints<br>
becomes sufficient. Further, when the NV is 70 parts by mass or less,<br>
excellent polymerization stability can be obtained.<br>
[0029]<br>
As for the emulsion obtained by emulsion polymerization, stability of<br>
the emulsion can be raised by adjusting the pH of the emulsion to become<br>
weak aikalinic, namely within the range of from about 7.5 to 10.0, by adding a<br>
basic compound after the polymerization. As the basic compound, for<br>
example, ammonia, triethylamine, propylamine, dibutylamine, amylamine,<br>
1-aminooctane, 2-(dimethylamino)ethanol, ethylaminoethanol,<br>
2-(diethylamino)ethanol, 1-amino-2-propanol, 2-amino-1-propanol,<br>
2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, 3-amino-1-propanol,<br>
1-dimethylamino-2-propanol, 3-dimethylamino-1-propanol,<br>
2-(propylamino)ethanol, ethoxypropylamine, aminobenzyl alcohol, morphorin,<br>
sodium hydroxide, or potassium hydroxide can be listed. It is preferable to<br>
use an inorganic basic compound in the case of the use such as an interior<br>
which is desired not to contain VOC. Further, in the case where even a faint<br>
odor is not desired, it is preferable to use a nonvolatile inorganic basic<br>
compound such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.<br>
[0030]<br>
In the case that the water-based resin composition of the present<br>
invention is used as a water-based paint, one kind of the water-based paint<br>
having the same composition alone or a mixture of two or more kinds of the<br>
water-based paints having different compositions may be used. In order to<br>
realize high-degree performances of the water-based paint of the present<br>
invention, various pigments, a film-forming aid, a defoaming agent, a pigment<br>
dispersing agent, a leveling agent, an anti-sagging agent, a matting agent, a<br>
nonreactive HALS, a nonreactive ultraviolet light absorber, an antioxidant, a<br>
heat resistance improver, a slip agent, a viscosity control agent, an antiseptic<br>
agent, and the like may be added. Further, the water-based paint of the<br>
present invention may be used after mixed with a melamine-based hardening+<br>
agent, an epoxy-based hardening agent, or an isocyanate-based hardening<br>
agent of emulsion type, water-soluble resin type, low molecular mass type, or<br>
the like. In order to form coating films on surfaces of various materials using<br>
the water-based paint containing the weather resistance improver for<br>
water-based paints of the present invention, for example, a publicly known<br>
coating method such as a spray coating method, a roller coating method, a bar<br>
coating method, an air-knife coating method, a brush coating method, or a<br>

The amount of addition of the weather resistance improver for<br>
water-based paints in the case that the water-based resin composition of the<br>
present invention is used as the weather resistance improver for water-based<br>
paints is not particularly limited, however, it is preferably 1 to 50% by mass as<br>
solid matter, provided that the sum of solid matter-of the weather resistance<br>
improver for water-based paints and solid matter of the water-based paint to<br>
which the weather resistance improver for water-based paints has been added<br>
is 100% by mass. When the concentration of the weather resistance<br>
improver for water-based paints of the present invention is less than 1% by<br>
mass, there is a case that sufficient capability for improving weather resistance<br>
of the coating film cannot be realized because the concentration of the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a) in the coating film becomes low even if<br>
the concentration of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a) in the<br>
copolymer (A) which constitutes the weather resistance improver for<br>
water-based paints is sufficiently raised. Further, when the concentration of<br>
the weather resistance improver for water-based paints of the present<br>
invention is exceeding 50% by mass, the characteristics of the water-based<br>
paint containing the weather resistance improver for water-based paints of the<br>
present invention tends to be lowered. Further, as the weather resistance<br>
improver for water-based paints of the present invention, one kind of a resin<br>
having a same composition alone or a combination of two or more kinds of<br>
resins having different compositions may be used.<br>
The weather resistance improver for water-based paints of the present<br>
invention can be used for various water-based paints such as an acrylic paint,<br>
an acryl-silicone paint, a polyester paint, an urethane paint, a fluorine paint, a<br>
vinyl chloride paint and an alkyd paint. Further, in order to realize high-degree<br>
performances of the weather resistance improver for water-based paints of the<br>
present invention and the water-based paint containing it, various pigments, a<br>
film-forming aid, a defoaming agent, a pigment dispersing agent, a leveling<br>
agent, an anti-sagging agent, a matting agent, a nonreactive HALS, a<br>
nonreactive ultraviolet light absorber, an antioxidant, a heat resistance<br>
improver, a slip agent, an antiseptic agent, and the like may be added. These<br>
additives may be added to a mixture obtained after the weather resistance<br>
improver for water-based paints of the present invention is added to the<br>
water-based paint or to the water-based paint existing before the weather<br>
resistance improver for water-based paints is added to the water-based paint.<br>
Further, after these additives are added to the weather resistance improver for<br>
water-based paints of the present invention, the resultant weather resistance<br>
improver for water-based paints containing these additives may be added to<br>
the water-based paint.<br>
In order to form coating films on surfaces of various materials using the<br>
water-based paint containing the weather resistance improver for water-based<br>
paints of the present invention, a publicly known coating method such as a<br>
spray coating method, a roller coating method, a bar coating method, an<br>
air-knife coating method, a brush coating method, or a dipping method may be<br>
properly selected and carried out.<br>
[0031]<br>
In the case that a resin composition obtained by recovering solid<br>
matter in the water-based resin composition of the present invention is used as<br>
a weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins, one kind of a resin<br>
having a same composition alone or a combination of two or more kinds of<br>
resins having different compositions may be used. When the combination of<br>
two or more kinds of resins is used, the solid matter may be recovered after the<br>
two or more kinds of resins have been mixed or the respective resin<br>
compositions obtained by separately recovering the solid matter may be mixed<br>
to use.<br>
As a method for recovering the solid matter, a publicly known method<br>
such as a spray-drying method, a coagulation method or a centrifugation<br>
method may be used, and it is preferable that the solid matter be recovered by<br>
the spray-drying method or the coagulation method. As the method for<br>
recovering the solid matter using the spray-drying method, a method in which a<br>
water-based resin composition obtained by emulsion polymerization is<br>
spray-dried and recovered as powder with a spray dryer under the conditions<br>
of an inlet temperature of 120 to 220°C and an outlet temperature of 40 to 90°C<br>
can be adopted. The outlet temperature is preferably 40 to 80°C in point of<br>
disintegrability of a recovered secondary particle to a primary particle, and<br>
particularly preferably 40 to 70°C.<br>
Further, as the method for recovering the solid matter using the<br>
coagulation method, a method in which a water-based resin composition is<br>
contacted with a coagulating agent at 30 to 60°C, coagulated while stirred to<br>
make a slurry, and the slurry is dehydrated and dried to recover powder can be<br>
adopted. As the coagulating agent, for example, an inorganic acid such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid or phosphoric acid, an organic acid<br>
such as formic acid or acetic acid, or an organic salt such as aluminum sulfate,<br>
magnesium sulfate, calcium acetate or calcium sulfate can be listed.<br>

polystyrene resin, an ABS resin, a polyamide resin, a polyester resin and a<br>
polycarbonate resin, and the amount of addition can be changed in accordance<br>
with a target weather resistance. The weather resistance improver for<br>
thermoplastic resins of the present invention can be molded together with the<br>
thermoplastic resin to which it is added by a publicly known molding method<br>
such as an injection molding method, an extrusion molding method, a blow<br>
molding method, a press molding method, a calendering method, or an<br>
inflation molding method.<br>
The amount of addition of the weather resistance improver for<br>
thermoplastic resins of the present invention is not particularly limited, however,<br>
it is preferably 0.1 to 50% by mass to 100% by mass of the sum of the weather<br>
resistance improver for thermoplastic resins and the thermoplastic resin.<br>
When the amount of addition is less than 0.1% by mass, sufficient capability for<br>
improving weather resistance tends to be lowered. Further, when the amount<br>
of addition is exceeding 50% by mass, the characteristics of the thermoplastic<br>
resin to which the weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins is<br>
added tends to be lowered. In order to realize high-degree performances of<br>
the weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins of the present<br>
invention and the thermoplastic resin containing it, a mold release agent,<br>
various kinds of pigments, a dye, a flame retardant, an ultraviolet light absorber,<br>
an antioxidant, an antiseptic agent, an anti-fungus agent, and the like may be<br>
added.<br>
[0032]<br>
In the case that a resin composition obtained by recovering solid<br>
matter in the water-based resin composition of the present invention is used as<br>
a weather resistance improver for solvent-based paints, the amount of addition<br>
of the weather resistance improver for solvent-based paints is not particularly<br>
limited, however, it is preferably within the range of from 1 to 50% by mass,<br>
provided that 100% by mass of the sum of the solid matter of the weather<br>
resistance improver for solvent-based paints and the solvent-based paint is<br>
100% by mass. When the concentration of the weather resistance improver<br>
for solvent-based paints of the present invention is 1% by mass or more,<br>
weather resistance of the solvent-based paint to which the weather resistance<br>
improver for solvent-based paints has been added is largely improved, and<br>
when the concentration of the weather resistance improver for solvent-based<br>
paints of the present invention is 50% by mass or less, its effect on the physical<br>
properties of the solvent-based paint to which the weather resistance improver<br>
for solvent-based paints has been added becomes limitative. Further, as the<br>
weather resistance improver for solvent-based paints of the present invention,<br>
one kind of a resin having a same composition alone or a combination of two or<br>
more kinds of resins having different compositions may be used. The weather<br>
resistance improver for solvent-based paints of the present invention can be<br>
used for various solvent-based paints such as an acrylic paint, an acryl-silicone<br>
paint, a polyester paint, a urethane paint, a fluorine paint, a vinyl chloride paint<br>
and an alkyd paint.<br>

mixture obtained after the weather resistance improver for solvent-based<br>
paints of the present invention is added to the solvent-based paint or to the<br>
solvent-based paint existing before the weather resistance improver for<br>
solvent-based paints is added. Further, after these additives are added to the<br>
weather resistance improver for solvent-based paints of the present invention,<br>
the resultant weather resistance improver for solvent-based paints containing<br>
these additives may be added to the solvent-based paint.<br>
In order to form coating films on surfaces of various materials using the<br>
solvent-based paint containing the weather resistance improver for<br>
solvent-based paints of the present invention, a publicly known coating method<br>
such as a spray coating method, a roller coating method, a bar coating method,<br>
an air-knife coating method, a brush painting coating method, or a dipping<br>
method may be properly selected and carried out to obtain a dried coating film<br>

Example 1<br>
To a reactor flask equipped with a stirrer, a condenser, a temperature<br>
control system, a dropping pump and a nitrogen-introducing tube, 45 parts of<br>
deionized water, 5% by mass of emulsion A compounded with the rate shown<br>
in Table 1 and 0.2 part of 28% by mass aqueous ammonia were introduced,<br>
and the resultant mixture was heated to 75°C while inside of the reactor was<br>
replaced by nitrogen, and an initiator solution obtained by dissolving 0.1 part of<br>
ammonium persulfate (polymerization initiator) into 5 parts of water was added<br>
to form a seed particle. The temperature of the resultant solution was<br>
measured by a thermometer, and after an exothermic peak was observed, the<br>
remainder of the emulsion A was dropped by taking 4 hours at the inside<br>
temperature of 75°C, and the resultant system was aged for 2 hours at the<br>
same inside temperature of 75°C to polymerize a monomer of the emulsion A<br>
and to form a copolymer (A).<br>
Subsequently, the system was cooled, and 0.2 part of 28% by mass<br>
aqueous ammonia was added at a temperature of 60°C or below to prepare a<br>
water-based resin composition. The results of evaluation of the water-based<br>
resin composition thus obtained are shown in Table 1.<br>
Examples 2 to 10, Comparative Examples 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7<br>
The same procedure as in Example 1 was carried out to prepare<br>
water-based coating materials using the emulsion A compounded with the rate<br>
shown in Tables 1 and 2. The results of evaluation are shown in Tables 1 and<br>
2.<br>
Comparative Examples 2 and 5<br>
The same procedure as in Example 1 was carried out to start emulsion<br>
polymerization using the emulsion A compounded with the rate shown in Table<br>
2, however, coagulated materials were generated at the stage when a seed<br>
particle was formed by adding the initiator solution obtained by dissolving 0.1<br>
part of ammonium persulfate (polymerization initiator) into 5 parts of water, and<br>
stirring became difficult owing to coagulated materials generated in course of<br>
dropping of the remainder of the emulsion A, and hence the polymerization<br>
was stopped.<br><br>

storage stability and polymerization stability.<br>
Contrary to this, the water-based paints of the comparative examples<br>
are inferior in polymerization stability or storage stability, and at least one<br>
characteristics of weather resistance, silica dispersibility, hot water resistance,<br>
and pigment dispersibility are insufficient, even if they are polymerizable.<br>
Consequently, it is obvious that the water-based paint having excellent<br>
polymerization stability, mechanical stability, and storage stability, and<br>
satisfying all the characteristics of weather resistance, silica dispersibility, hot<br>
water resistance and pigment dispersibility can be provided according to the<br>
present invention.<br>

Use as a weather resistance improver for water-based paints<br>
Various evaluations of the weather resistance improver for<br>
water-based paints were carried out according to the following methods.<br>
Preparation of a clear paint&gt;<br>
A water-based resin composition is compounded to a water-based<br>
paint of Reference Example 1 to be mentioned later with a fixed rate (shown in<br>
a table). To 100 g of the prepared water-based paint, "CS-12" (trade name,<br>
manufactured by Chisso Corporation, film forming aid) was added, as a film<br>
forming aid, to the extent that the minimum film forming temperature of the<br>
water-based paint became 5°C, and 0.5 g of "RHEOLATE350" (trade name,<br>
manufactured by Rheox Inc., thickener) and 0.5 g of "Surfynol DF-58" (trade<br>
name, manufactured by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., defoaming agent)<br>
were further added, and the mixture was sufficiently stirred and filtrated using<br>
100 mesh nylon screen to obtain a clear paint for evaluation. The resultant<br>
clear paint was coated on a steel plate treated with zinc phosphate treatment<br>
(steel plate treated with "Bondelite #100", thickness: 0.8 mm, 70 mm x 150<br>
mm) by spray coating to the extent that the thickness of the dried coating film<br>
became 50 urn, and kept at a room temperature for 1 hour and subjected to<br>
forced drying at 80°C for 1 hour to obtain a coated plate for the tests of weather<br>
resistance and capability for improving weather resistance.<br><br>
"TIPAQUE CR-97" (trade name, manufactured by Ishihara Sangyo<br>
Kaisha, Ltd., titanium oxide made by chloride process): 707 g, "ADEKA COL<br>
W-193" (trade name, manufactured byAsahi Denka Kogyo K.K., pigment<br>
dispersing agent): 12 g, "Surfynol DF-58" (trade name, manufactured by Air<br>
Products and Chemicals, Inc., defoaming agent): 25 g, and deionized water<br>
256 g were sufficiently mixed, and glass beads were added to the resultant<br>
mixture and dispersion of the pigment was carried out for 30 minutes using a<br>
high-speed disperser, and then the glass beads and the like were filtrated with<br>
300 mesh nylon screen to obtain a mill base for evaluation (solid content: 71%<br>
by mass).<br>
Subsequently, to 100 g of a water-based paint (solid content: 50% by<br>
mass) obtained by compounding a water-based resin composition to a<br>
water-based paint of Reference Example 1 to be mentioned later with a fixed<br>
rate (shown in a table), "CS-12" (trade name, manufactured by Chisso<br>
Corporation, film forming aid) was added, as a film forming aid, to the extent<br>
that the minimum film forming temperature of the water-based paint became<br>
5°C, and 47 g of the foregoing mill base for evaluation and 0.5 g of<br>
"RHEOLATE350" (trade name, manufactured by Rheox Inc., thickener) were<br>
added in this order, and the resultant mixture was sufficiently stirred, and<br>
adjusted to have the viscosity of about 30 seconds in terms of "Ford Cup #4" by<br>
adding deionized water. Subsequently, the resultant mixture was filtrated<br>
again with a 300 mesh nylon screen to obtain a white enamel paint for<br>
evaluation having 40% of PWC. The resultant white enamel paint was coated<br>
on a steel plate treated with zinc phosphate treatment (steel plate treated with<br>
"Bondelite #100", thickness: 0.8 mm, 70 mm x 150 mm) by spray coating to the<br>
extent that the thickness of the dried coating film became 50 urn, and kept at a<br>
room temperature for 1 hour and subjected to forced drying at 80°C for 1 hour<br>
to obtain a coated plate for the tests of weather resistance, chalking, capability<br>
for improving weather resistance and pigment dispersibility.<br>

Example 11<br>
To a reactor flask equipped with a stirrer, a condenser, a temperature<br>
control system, a dropping pump and a nitrogen-introducing tube, 45 parts of<br>
deionized water, 5% by mass of emulsion A compounded with the rate shown<br>
in Table 3 and 0.2 part of 28% by mass aqueous ammonia were introduced,<br>
and the resultant mixture was heated to 75°C while inside of the reactor was<br>
replaced by nitrogen, and an initiator solution obtained by dissolving 0.1 part of<br>
ammonium persulfate (polymerization initiator) into 5 parts of water was added<br>
to form a seed particle. The temperature of the resultant solution was<br>
measured by a thermometer, and after an exothermic peak was observed, the<br>
remainder of the emulsion A was dropped by taking 4 hours at the inside<br>
temperature of 75°C, and the resultant system was aged for 2 hours at the<br>
same inside temperature of 75°C to polymerize a monomer of the emulsion A<br>
and to form a copolymer (A).<br>
Subsequently, the system was cooled, and 28% by mass aqueous<br>
ammonia was added at a temperature of 60°C or below till the pH of the<br>
system became 9 to prepare a water-based resin composition. The<br>
water-based resin composition thus obtained was used as a weather<br>
resistance improver for water-based paints. The results of evaluation are<br>
shown in Table 3.<br>

aqueous ammonia and 5% by mass, with respect to the sum of the emulsion of<br>
the whole stages, measured and taken out from the emulsion A for the first<br>

the emulsion B was dropped by taking 2 hours at the inside temperature of<br>
75°C. The resultant system was aged for 2 hours at the same inside<br>
temperature of 75°C to reduce a remaining monomer and to form a copolymer<br>
(A). Subsequently, the system was cooled and 28% by mass aqueous<br>
ammonia was added at a temperature of 60°C or below till the pH of the<br>
system became 9 to prepare a water-based resin composition. The results of<br>

It is obvious from Tables 3 to 7 that the weather resistance improvers<br>
for water-based paints of the present examples can realize conspicuous<br>
improvement in weather resistance when they are added to other water-based<br>
paints, as well as they are excellent in mechanical stability, storage stability and<br>
polymerization stability.<br>
Contrary to this, the weather resistance improvers for water-based<br>
paints of the comparative examples are not excellent in polymerization stability<br>
or storage stability, and are insufficient in at least one characteristics of<br>
capability for improving weather resistance, water resistance, coloring property<br>
and pigment dispersibility, even if they are polymerizable, when they are added<br>
to other water-based paints as the weather resistance improvers for<br>
water-based paints.<br>
Consequently, it is obvious that the weather resistance improver for<br>
water-based paints of the present invention is also useful as a weather<br>
resistance improver for water-based paints, which is excellent in mechanical<br>

Example 31<br>
To a reactor flask equipped with a stirrer, a condenser, a temperature<br>
control system, a dropping pump and a nitrogen-introducing tube, 45 parts of<br>
deionized water, and then, 0.2 part of 28% by mass aqueous ammonia and 5%<br>
by mass of emulsion A compounded with the rate shown in Table 6 were<br>
introduced, and the resultant mixture was heated to 75°C while inside of the<br>
reactor was replaced by nitrogen, and a initiator solution obtained by dissolving<br>
0.1 part of ammonium persulfate (polymerization initiator) into 5 parts of water<br>
was added to form a seed particle. The temperature of the resultant solution<br>
was measured by a thermometer, and after an exothermic peak was observed,<br>
the remainder of the emulsion A was dropped by taking 4 hours at the inside<br>
temperature of 75°C, and the resultant system was aged for 2 hours at the<br>
same inside temperature of 75°C to polymerize a monomer of the emulsion A<br>
and to form a copolymer emulsion.<br>
Subsequently, the system was cooled and 25% by mass aqueous<br>
ammonia was added at a temperature of 60°C or below till the pH of the<br>
system became 9 to obtain dispersed emulsion of a weather resistance<br>
improver for thermoplastic resins.<br>
The concentration of the resultant dispersed emulsion was adjusted to<br>
1% and average particle diameter was measured at 25°C using "Fiber-Optics<br>
Particle Analyzer with Autosampler FPAR-1000" manufactured by Otsuka<br>
Electronics Co., Ltd. The average particle diameter of cumulant analysis<br>
obtained by the measurement was adopted as a primary particle diameter.<br>

with a spray dryer ("L-8 type", manufactured by Ohkawara Kakohki Co., Ltd.)<br>
under the conditions of the inlet temperature of 170°C, the outlet temperature<br>
of 60°C, and the number of revolution of atomizer of 25,000 rpm to recover<br>
solid matter as the polymeric weather resistance improver. The polymeric<br>
weather resistance improver thus obtained was observed by a scanning<br>
electron microscope, and an average of measured particle diameters of 20<br>
particles was adopted as a secondary particle diameter.<br>

and nitrogen was introduced from the nitrogen introducing tube, and the<br>
resultant mixture was heated to 50°C and stirred while inside of the reactor was<br>
replaced by nitrogen. Subsequently, 0.3 part of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN)<br>
dissolved in 20 parts of ethyl acetate was added to the mixture and stirred for 1<br>
hour. After the stirring was finished, the resultant system was heated to 70°C,<br>
and the reaction was carried out for 8 hours. After the polymerization was<br>
finished, the resultant polymer was put into 1,000 parts of methanol and the<br>
mixture was stirred by a homomixer for 30 minutes. After the stirring, the<br>
mixture was subjected to a suction filtration using No. 2 filter paper, and the<br>
filter residue was dried at 60°C with a circulating hot air dryer to recover solid<br>
[matter] as the weather resistance improver for thermoplastic resins of<br>
Comparative Example 17. In the case of Comparative Example 17, the solid<br>
matter did not have a shape of particle because the solid matter was recovered<br>
by reprecipitation after a solution polymerization so that evaluation of a particle<br>
diameter of primary particle or secondary particle was impossible. The results<br>
of evaluation are shown in Table 8.<br>

while inside of the reactor was replaced by nitrogen. Subsequently, 0.3 part<br>
of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) dissolved in 20 parts of ethyl acetate was<br>
added to the mixture and stirred for 1 hour. After the stirring was finished, the<br>
resultant system was heated to 70°C, and the reaction was carried out for 8<br>
hours. After the polymerization was finished, the resultant polymer was put<br>
into 1,000 parts of methanol and the mixture was stirred by a homomixer for 30<br>

In the case of Comparative Example 18 as well as in the case of Comparative<br>
Example 17, the solid matter did not have a shape of particle because the solid<br>
