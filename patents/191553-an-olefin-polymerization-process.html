The present invention relates to  a process for polymerizing alpha olefins in the presence of a metal complex catalyst and a cocatalyst.<br>
The  preparation  and  characterization  of  certain biscyclop6ntadienyl   (Cp2)   zirconium and hafnium diene  complexes   is described  in the following references:  Yasuda,   et al., Organometallics.   1982,   1’,   388  (Yasuda I);  Yasuda,   et  al.  Ace.   Chem. Res..   1985,   1_8  120  (Yasuda  II);  Erker,  et  al..  Adv.  Organomet. Chem..   1985,   2A,   1   (Erker  I);   Erker et al.   Chem.   Ber..   1994,   127. 805  (Erker  II);   and  US-A-5,198,401.    The last  reference  describes the use of  Cp2Zr(diene)  where the Zr is  in  the  +4  formal  oxidation state  as  an  olefin polymerization catalyst   in combination with ammonium borate  cocatalysts.<br>
Biscyclopentadienyl  Group 4 transition metal   complexes  in which  the metal   is   in  the  +4  formal  oxidation  state,   and  olefin polymerization catalysts  formed  from such complexes  by  combination with an activating agent,   for example,  alumoxane or ammonium borate,   are  known  in  the  art.     Thus,  U.S.   Patent No.   3,242,099 describes  the  formation  of  olefin polymerization  catalysts  by  the combination of  biscyclopentadienyl metal dihalides  with alumoxane. U.S.  Patent No.   5,198,401  discloses  tetravalent  biscyclopentadienyl Group 4  transition metal   complexes  and olefin polymerization catalysts  obtained by  converting  such complexes  into  cationic  form in combination with a  non-coordinating anion.     Particularly preferred  catalysts  are  obtained by the combination  of  ammonium<br><br>
borate salts with the biscyclopentadienyl titanium, zirconium or hafnium complexes.  Among the many suitable complexes disclosed are bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium complexes containing a diene ligand attached to the transition metal through o-bonds where the transition metal is in its highest (+4) formal oxidation state.fluorophenyl)borane capable of converting the complexes to active forms.<br>
The present invention provides novel olefin polymerization catalysts which can be employed over a wide range of physical conditions and with a wide range of olefin monomers and combinations of such monomers, thus providing an outstanding opportunity of tailor making polyolefins having specifically desired properties <br>
The present invention relates to metal complexes containing two cyclopentadienyl groups or substituted cyclopentadienyl groups, said complex corresponding to the formula:<br>
CpCp'MD wherein:<br>
M is titanium, zirconium or hafnium in the +2 or +4 formal oxidation state;<br>
Cp and Cp are each substituted or unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl groups bound in an T[‘  bonding mode to the metal, said substituted cyclopentadienyl group being substituted with from one to five substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbyl, silyl, germyl, halo, cyano, hydrocarbyloxy, and mixtures thereof, said substituent having up to 20 nonhydrogen atoms, or optionally, two such substituents (except cyano or halo) together cause Cp or Cp' to have a fused ring structure, or wherein one substituent on Cp and Cp' forms a linking moiety joining Cp and Cp';<br><br>
D is a stable, conjugated diene, optionally substituted with one or more hydrocarbyl groups, silyl groups, hydrocarbylsilyl groups, silylhydrocarbyl groups, or mixtures thereof, said D having from A up to AO nonhydrogen atoms and forming a n-complex with M when M is in the +2 formal oxidation state, and forming a o-complex with M when M is in the +A formal oxidation state.  In the diene complexes in which M is in the +2 formal oxidation state, the diene is associated with M as a n-complex in which the diene normally assumes an s-trans configuration or an s-cis configuration in which the bond lengths between M and the four carbon atoms of the conjugated diene are nearly equal (Ad as defined hereafter ■ -O.I5A) whereas in the complexes in which M is in the +A formal oxidation state, the diene is associated with the transition metal as a o-complex in which the diene normally assumes a s-cis configuration in which the bond lengths between M and the four carbon atoms of the conjugated diene are significantly different (Ad 
The present invention also relates to novel methods of preparing the CpCp'MD complexes involving the reaction of the biscyclopentadienyl dihydrocarbyl, dihydrocarbyloxy, dihalide or diamide Group A metal complexes wherein the metal is in the +4 or +3 formal oxidation state, with a diene, D, and a reducing agent. The use of a reducing agent is optional when starting with biscyclopentadienyl dihydrocarbyl complexes.<br>
Stated more particularly, the diene metal complexes of the present invention may be formed by reacting in any order the following components:<br><br>
Da complex of the formula:<br>
CpCp'M*X or CpCp'M**X2 wherein;<br>
Cp and Cp'   are as  previously defined;<br>
M*  is  titanium,  zirconium or hafnium in the  +3  formal oxidation  state;<br>
M** is  titanium,  zirconium or hafnium in the  +4  formal oxidation  state;   and<br>
X is  a Ci-5 hydrocarbyl,   halide,   C’-’ hydrocarbyloxy  or diCi-6 hydrocarbylamide  group;<br>
2)	a diene corresponding  to  the  formula,   D;  and<br>
3)	optionally when X is  Ci-6 hydrocarbyl,   otherwise,  not optionally, a reducing agent.<br>
Uniquely,  the process  when used with diastereomeric mixtures  of rac and roeso  isomers  of metallocenes,   can result   in formation of only the rac  diene metal  complex.<br>
Further according to  the present  invention there are provided catalysts  for polymerization of  addition polymerizable monomers comprising a combination of one or more of the above metal complexes  and one or more activating cocatalysts.    The metal complexes  wherein the metal  is  in the +2  formal  oxidation  state are preferred  in the formation of the novel  catalysts  of this invention.<br>
Finally according to  the present  invention there  is provided a  polymerization process  comprising contacting  one or more addition polymerizable monomers  and particularly one or more  a-<br><br>
olefins with a catalyst comprising one or more of the above metal complexes and one or more activating cocatalysts.<br>
Generally speaking, the present diene containing complexes are more soluble in hydrocarbon solvents compared to the corresponding dihalide complexes and they are more stable to reductive elimination and other side reactions than are the corresponding dihydrocarbyl complexes.  Catalyst systems comprising such diene containing complexes are accordingly better adapted to commercial use than are such alternative systems.<br>
All reference to the Periodic Table of the Elements herein shall refer to the Periodic Table of the Elements, published and copyrighted by CRC Press, Inc., 1989. Also, any reference to a Group or Groups shall be to the Group or Groups as reflected in this Periodic Table of the Elements using the lUPAC system for numbering groups.<br>
Useful dienes, D, are dienes that do not decompose under reaction conditions used to prepare the complexes of the invention. Under subsequent polymerization conditions, or in the formation of catalytic derivatives of the present complexes, the diene group, D, may undergo chemical reaction or be replaced by another ligand.<br>
The complexes of the present invention wherein M is in the +2 formal oxidation state contain a neutral diene ligand which is coordinated via n-complexation through the diene double bonds, and not through a metallacycle resonance form containing o-bonds. The nature of the diene bond to the metal is readily determined by X-ray crystallography or by NMR spectral characterization according to the techniques of Yasuda I, Yasuda II, and Erker I, supra, as well as the references cited therein.  By the term "n-complex" is meant both the donation and back acceptance of electron density by the ligand are accomplished using ligand n-orbitals, that is, the diene is n-bound (n-bound diene).<br><br>
Encompassed within the scope of the present invention also are complexes containing a diene ligand which is coordinated formally as a metallocycle containing o-bonds (o-bound diene) where the metal is in the +4 formal oxidation state.  Such Group A metal o-bound diene complexes have a structure which is formally a metallocyclopentene wherein the bonding between the metal and the diene (depicted as structure i) can be described as a divalent 2-butene-1,A-diyl o-bonded to a tetravalent metal, optionally containing a single n-bond involving the n electrons between internal carbons of the conjugated diene.  Such structures are depicted as structure ii and structure iii as follows:<br><br><br>
C2<br>
//<br>
Cl<br><br>
C3 C4<br><br>
C3<br><br>
Cl   ii<br>
M<br>
C4<br><br>
111<br><br>
The nomenclature for such o-bound diene complexes can be either as a metallocyclopentene (referring to the compounds as 2-butene-l,A-diyl compounds) or generically as the parent diene, for example, butadiene. Those of skill in the art will recognize the interchangability of these names.  For example, the prior art biscyclopentadienyl zirconium complex containing a o-bound 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene group would be named either bis¬cyclopentadienyl 2-butene-2,3-dimethyl-l,A-diyl zirconium or bis¬cyclopentadienyl 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene zirconium.<br>
A suitable method of determining the existence of a n- or o-complex in conjugated diene containing metal complexes is the measurement of metal-carbon atomic spacings for the four carbons of the conjugated diene using common X-ray crystal analysis techniques. Measurements of atomic spacings between the metal and Cl, 02, C3, and CA (M-Cl, M-C2, M-C3, M-CA, respectively) (where Cl and CA are the terminal carbons of the A carbon conjugated diene<br><br>
group and C2 and C3 are the internal carbons of the 4 carbon conjugated diene group) may be made.  If the difference between these bond distances, Ad, using the following formula:<br><br><br>
M-C1) + (M-C4 I  JiM-C2) + (M-C3)l<br>
Ad =<br><br>
is greater than or equal to -O.ISA, the diene is considered to form a n-complex with M and M is formally in the +2 oxidation state.  If Ad is less than -0.15A, the diene is considered to form a o-complex with M and M is formally in the +4 oxidation state.<br>
Examples wherein the above method for determination of n-complexes has been applied to prior art compounds are found in Erker, et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng.. 1984, 23, 455-456 (Erker III) and Yamamoto, et al, Organometallics, 1989, 8, 105-119.  In the former reference (q’-allyl )(ii4-butadiene)(ri5—cyclopenta-dienyl )zirconium was crystallographically characterized.  The M-Cl and M-C4 distances were both 2.360 (±.005) A.  The M-C2 and M-C3 distances were both 2.463 (±.005) A, giving a Ad of -0.103A.  In the latter reference (q5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)(n’-l,4--diphenyl-l,3-butadiene)titanium chloride was shown to have M-Cl and M-C4 distances of 2.233 (±.006) A. The M-C2 and M-C3 distances were both 2.293 (±.005) A, giving a Ad of -O.O6OA. Accordingly, these two complexes contain n-bound diene ligands and the metal of each is in the +2 formal oxidation state.  Erker I also disclosed bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium (2,3—dimethyl-1,3-butadiene).  In this complex the M-Cl and M-C4 distances were 2.300 A.  The M-C2 and M-C3 distances were both 2.597 A, giving a Ad of -O.297A.  Accordingly, this complex contains a o-bound diene and the zirconium is in the +4 formal oxidation state.  In the use of such X-ray crystal analysis techniques at least "good" and preferably "excellent" determination quality as defined by G. Stout<br><br>
et al., X-ray Structure Determination, A Practical Guide. MacMillan Co., pp. A30-431 (1968) is used.<br>
Alternatively, complexes of the present invention wherein X is a conjugated diene in the form of a n-complex and M is in the +2 formal oxidation state are identified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques. The teachings of Erker, I to III, supra. C. Kriiger, et al. Organometallics. 4, 215—223, (1985), and Yasuda I, supra, disclose these well known techniques for distinguishing between n-bound complexes and metallocyclic coordination or o-bound diene complexes.  The teachings of the foregoing references related to n-bound and o-bound diene complexes is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
It is to be understood that the present complexes may be formed and utilized as a mixture of the n-complexed and a-complexed diene compounds where the metal centers are in the +2 or +4 formal oxidation state.  Preferably the complex in the +2 formal oxidation state is present in a molar amount from 0.1 to 100.0 percent, more preferably in a molar amount from 10 to 100.0 percent, most preferably in a molar amount from 60 to 100.0 percent.  Techniques for separation and purification of the complex in the +2 formal oxidation state from the foregoing mixtures are known in the art and disclosed for example in the previously mentioned Yasuda, I, supra, and Erker, I to III, supra, references and may be employed if desired to prepare and isolate the complexes in greater purity.<br>
The metal complexes used to form the diene complexes of the present invention are the bis(cyclopentadienyl) dihalides, dihydrocarbyls, diamides and dialkoxides which have heretofore been employed in the formation of metallocene complexes, or which are readily prepared using well known synthetic techniques.  An extensive list of biscyclopentadienyl complexes is disclosed in US-A-5,198,401.<br><br>
Preferred complexes of the present invention correspond to the formula:<br><br><br>
R' —<br>
(A)<br><br>
wherein:<br>
M is titanium, zirconium or hafnium, preferably zirconium or hafnium, in the +2 or +4 formal oxidation state;<br>
R' and R" in each occurrence are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, silyl, germyl, cyano, halo and combinations thereof, said R' and R" having up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms each, or adjacent R' groups and/or adjacent R" groups (when R' and R" are not hydrogen, halo or cyano) together form a divalent derivative (that is, a hydrocarbadiyl, siladiyl or germadiyl group) or one R' and one R" together (when R' and R" groups are not hydrogen halo or cyano) combine to form a divalent radical (that is, a hydrocarbadiyl, germadiyl or siladiyl group) linking the two substituted cyclopentadienyl groups; and<br>
D is a conjugated diene having from 4 to 30 non-hydrogen atoms, which forms a n-complex with M when M is in the +2 formal oxidation state and a o-complex with M when M is in the +4 formal oxidation state.<br>
Preferably, R' and R" independently in each occurrence are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, and all isomers of propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl, as well as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, norbornyl, benzyl, and  trimethyl silyl, or adjacent R' groups and/or adjacent R" groups on each cyclopenta-<br><br>
dienyl ring (except hydrogen) are linked together thereby forming a fused ring system such as an indenyl, 2-methyl-A-phenylindenyl, 2-methyl-4i-naphthylindenyl, tetrahydroindenyl, fluorenyl, tetrahydro-fluorenyl, or octahydrofluorenyl group, or one R' and one R" are linked together forming a 1,2-ethanediyl, 2,2-propanediyl or dimethylsilanediyl linking group.<br>
Examples of suitable D moieties include:  rj’-1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene; n’~l&gt;3-pentadiene; q’-l-phenyl-l ,3-pentadiene; ri’-l,4-dibenzyl-l,3-butadiene; ri’-2,4-hexadiene; T\’-3-methyl-1,3-pentadiene; n’"‘&gt;‘~ditolyl-l,3-butadiene; ri’-1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-l,3-butadiene, 2,3 dimethyl butadiene, isoprene.  Of the foregoing 1,4-diphenyl-l,3-butadiene, 1-phenyl-1,3-pentadiene, and 2,4 hexadiene, i.e, the terminally di-Ci-io hydrocarbyl substituted 1,3-dienes generally form n-complexes, whereas the solely internally Ci-io hydrocarbyl substituted 1,3-dienes, such as isoprene or 2,3-dimethyl butadiene generally form o-complexes.  Preferred dienes are terminally Ci-io hydrocarbyl substituted 1,3-butadienes.  2,4-hexadiene, l-phenyl-1,3-pentadiene, 1,4-diphenylbutadiene or 1,4-ditolylbutadiene<br>

Additional bis-cyclopentadienyl compounds of formula A include those containing a bridging group linking the cyclopentadienyl groups. Preferred bridging groups are those corresponding to the formula (ER''2)x wherein E is carbon, silicon or germanium, R'' independently each occurrence is hydrogen or a group selected from silyl, hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyloxy and combinations thereof, or two R' ' groups together form a ring system, said R'*' having up to 30 carbon or silicon atoms, and x is an integer from 1 to 8.  Preferably R'' independently each occurrence is methyl, benzyl, tert-butyl or phenyl.<br>
Examples of the foregoing bridged cyclopentadienyl containing complexes are compounds corresponding to the formula:<br><br><br>
(R'"2E<br>
M-D<br>
(B)<br><br>
wherein:<br><br>
M, D, E, R'' and x are as previously defined, and R' and R" in each occurrence are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, silyl, germyl, cyano, halo and combinations thereof, said R' and R" having up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms each, or adjacent R' groups and/or adjacent R" groups {when R' and R" are not hydrogen, halo or cyano) together form a divalent derivative (that is, a hydrocarbadiyl, siladiyl or germadiyl group) or one R' and one R" together (when R' and R" groups are not hydrogen halo or cyano) combine to form a divalent radical (that is, a hydrocarbadiyl, germadiyl or siladiyl group) linking the two cyclopentadienyl groups.<br>
Such bridged structures are especially suited for the preparation of polymers having stereoregular molecular structure. In such capacity it is preferred that the complex be nonsymmetrical or possess a chiral, stereorigid structure.  Examples of the first type are compounds possessing different delocalized n-bonded systems, such as one cyclopentadienyl group and one fluorenyl group.  Similar systems based on Ti(lV) or Zr(lV) were disclosed for preparation of syndiotactic olefin polymers in Ewen, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110, 6255-6256 (1980).

In general, the complexes of the present invention can be prepared by combining a diene compound, corresponding to the group D in the resulting complex, with a metal complex containing only hydrocarbyl leaving groups.  Heating the solution, for example use of boiling toluene, may expedite the reaction.  In the event the metal complex contains hydrocarbyloxy, amide or halogen ligands (and otherwise containing the desired structure of the resulting complexes) and optionally when the metal complex contains only hydrocarbyl leaving groups, the metal complex, the diene, or the above mixture of metal complex and diene, is also contacted with a reducing agent. The process preferably is conducted in a suitable noninterfering solvent at a temperature from -lOO'C to 300°C, preferably from -78 to 130'C, most preferably from -10 to 120°C. Metal complexes in either the +A or +3 formal oxidation state may be utilized.<br>
By the term "reducing agent" as used herein is meant a metal or compound which, under reducing conditions can cause the transition metal to be reduced from the +4 or +3 formal oxidation state to the +2 formal oxidation state.  The same procedure is employed for the preparation of the diene complexes where M is in the +2 formal oxidation state or in the +4 formal oxidation state, the nature of formal oxidation state of M in the complex being formed being primarily determined by the diene employed. Examples of suitable metal reducing agents are alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, aluminum, zinc and alloys of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as sodium/mercury amalgam and sodium/potassium alloy.  Specific examples of suitable reducing agent compounds are<br><br>
sodium naphthalenide, potassium graphite, lithium alkyls, aluminum trialkyls and Grignard reagents.  Most preferred reducing agents are the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, Ci-6 alkyl lithium, tri Ci-6 alkyl aluminum and Grignard reagents, especially lithium, n-butyl lithium and triethyl aluminum.  The use of a Ci-g alkyl lithium or triethylaluminum reducing agent is especially preferred.<br>
Highly preferred diene compounds are 1,3—pentadiene; 1,4-diphenyl-l,3-butadiene; 1-phenyl-l,3-pentadiene; 1,4-dibenzyl-1,3-butadiene; 2,4-hexadiene; 3-methyl-l,3—pentadiene; 1,4-ditolyl-1,3-butadiene; and l,4-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-l,3-butadiene. All geometric isomers of the foregoing diene compounds may be utilized.<br>
Suitable reaction media for the formation of the complexes are aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and halohydrocarbons, ethers, and cyclic ethers.  Examples include straight and branched-chain hydrocarbons such as isobutane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, and mixtures thereof; cyclic and alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, raethylcycloheptane, and mixtures thereof; aromatic and hydrocarbyl-substituted aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, xylene, C1-4 dialkyl ethers, C1-4 dialkyl ether derivatives of (poly)alkylene glycols, and tetrahydrofuran. Mixtures of the foregoing list of suitable solvents are also suitable.<br>
The recovery procedure involves separation of the resulting byproducts and devolatilization of the reaction medium. Extraction into a secondary solvent may be employed if desired. Alternatively, if the desired product is an insoluble precipitate, filtration or other separation technique may be employed.<br>
The present inventors have further discovered that ansa-rac biscyclopentadienyl Group 4 metal complexes (where "rac" refers<br><br>
to a racemic mixture of enantiomers) uniquely form stable complexes with the conjugated diene, particularly with a trans, trans-terminally disubstituted 1,3-butadiene.  The corresponding meso-biscyclopentadienyl Group 4 metal diene complexes are less stable and not recoverable, unless extreme care is utilized. Accordingly, this discovery allows the artisan to separate mixtures of diastereomers of biscyclopentadienyl Group 4 metal complexes containing hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyloxy, halide or amide leaving groups merely by contacting the mixture with a C4-40 conjugated diene and the reducing agent, where called for, and recovering the resulting ansa-rac biscyclopentadienyl Group 4 metal diene complex.<br>
In a further embodiment, the corresponding halide containing complex can be regenerated in the highly pure ansa-rac biscyclopentadienyl form by contacting the ansa-rac biscyclopentadienyl diene complex with an halogenating agent, such as hydrochloric acid or BCI3.  Such a process is highly desirable in order to form catalyst components that preferentially form isotactic polymers of prochiral olefins, such as propylene.<br>
Stated in more detail, the foregoing process comprises combining in a solvent in any order:<br>
1) a mixture of rac- and meso-diastereomers of a compound having the formula:<br><br><br>

2) a C4-40 conjugated diene, D, and<br><br>

wherein,<br>
M, X, E, X, and R'' are as previously defined, and<br>
R in each occurrence is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, silyl, germyl and combinations thereof, said R having up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms each, or adjacent R groups on each separate indenyl system together form a divalent derivative (that is, a hydrocarbadiyl, siladiyl or germadiyl group) thereby forming a further fused ring.  Examples of suitable precursor compounds are found in W. Spaleck, et al., Organomet.. 13, 954-963 (1994).<br>
The complexes are rendered catalytically active by combination with one or more activating cocatalysts, by use of an activating technique, or a combination thereof.  Suitable activating cocatalysts for use herein include polymeric or oligomeric alumoxanes, especially methylalumoxane, triisobutyl aluminum modified methylalumoxane, or diisobutylalumoxane; strong Lewis acids (the term "strong Lewis acid" as used herein is defined as trihydrocarbyl substituted Group 13 compounds, especially tri(hydrocarbyl)aluminum- or tri(hydrocarbyl)boron compounds and halogenated derivatives thereof, having from 1 to 10 carbons in each hydrocarbyl or halogenated hydrocarbyl group, more especially perfluorinated tri(aryl)boron compounds, and most especially tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane); amine, phosphine, aliphatic alcohol and mercaptan adducts of halogenated tri(Ci-io hydrocarbyl)boron compounds, especially such adducts of perfluorinated tri(aryl)boron compounds; nonpolymeric, ionic, compatible, noncoordinating, activating compounds (including the use of such compounds under oxidizing conditions); bulk electrolysis (explained in more detail hereinafter); and combinations of the foregoing activating cocatalysts and techniques. The foregoing activating cocatalysts and activating techniques have been previously taught with respect to different metal complexes in the following references:  EP-A-<br><br>
277,003, US-A-5,153,157, US-A-5,064,802, EP-A-468,651, EP-A-520,732, and WO 93/03250.<br>
Combinations of strong Lewis acids, especially the combination of a trialkyl aluminum compound having from 1 to 4 carbons in each alkyl group and a halogenated tri(hydrocarbyl)boron compound having from 1 to 10 carbons in each hydrocarbyl group, especially tris(pentafluorophenyDborane; further combinations of such strong Lewis acid mixtures with a polymeric or oligomeric alumoxane; and combinations of a single strong Lewis acid, especially tris(pentafluorophenyDborane with a polymeric or oligomeric alumoxane are especially desirable activating cocatalysts.<br>
When utilizing such strong Lewis acid cocatalysts to polymerize higher a-olefins, especially propylene, to form homopolymers thereof, it has been found especially desirable to also contact the catalyst/cocatalyst mixture with a small quantity of ethylene or hydrogen (preferably at least one mole of ethylene or hydrogen per mole of metal complex, suitably from 1 to 100,000 moles of ethylene or hydrogen per mole of metal complex). This contacting may occur before, after or simultaneously to contacting with the higher a-olefin.  If the foregoing Lewis acid activated catalyst compositions are not treated in the foregoing manner, either extremely long induction periods are encountered or no polymerization at all results. The ethylene or hydrogen may be used in a suitably small quantity such that no significant affect on polymer properties is observed.  For example, polypropylene having physical properties equal to or superior to polypropylene prepared by use of other metallocene catalyst systems is prepared according to the present invention.<br>
Thus the invention further comprises an activated polymerization catalyst system comprising in combination:<br><br>
a)	a metal complex corresponding to the formula:<br>
CpCp'MD wherein:<br>
M, Cp, Cp , and D are as previously defined,<br>
b)	a Lewis acid, and<br>
c)	ethylene or hydrogen,<br>
the quantity of ethylene or hydrogen being at least equal to the quantity necessary to activate the catalyst system for polymerization of a C3 or higher a-olefin, preferably at least 1 mole per mole of metal complex, more preferably from 1 to 100,000 moles per mole of metal complex.<br>
The technique of bulk electrolysis involves the electrochemical oxidation of the metal complex under electrolysis conditions in the presence of a supporting electrolyte comprising a noncoordinating, inert anion. In the technique, solvents, supporting electrolytes and electrolytic potentials for the electrolysis, are used such that electrolysis byproducts that would render the metal complex catalytically inactive are not sub¬stantially formed during the reaction. More particularly, suitable solvents are materials that are liquids under the conditions of the electrolysis (generally temperatures from 0 to 100°C), capable of dissolving the supporting electrolyte, and inert. "Inert solvents" are those that are not reduced or oxidized under the reaction conditions employed for the electrolysis. It is generally possible in view of the desired electrolysis reaction to choose a solvent and a supporting electrolyte that are unaffected by the electrical potential used for the desired electrolysis. Preferred solvents include difluorobenzene (ortho, meta, or para isomers), dimethoxyethane, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
The electrolysis may be conducted in a standard electrolytic cell containing an anode and cathode (also referred to as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively). Suitable materials of construction for the cell are glass, plastic, ceramic and glass coated metal.  The electrodes are prepared from inert conductive materials, by which are meant conductive materials that are unaffected by the reaction mixture or reaction conditions. Platinum or palladium are preferred inert conductive materials. Normally an ion permeable membrane such as a fine glass frit separates the cell into separate compartments, the working electrode compartment and counter electrode compartment. The working electrode is immersed in a reaction medium comprising the metal complex to be activated, solvent, supporting electrolyte, and any other materials desired for moderating the electrolysis or stabilizing the resulting complex. The counter electrode is immersed in a mixture of the solvent and supporting electrolyte. The desired voltage may be determined by theoretical calculations or experimentally by sweeping the cell using a reference electrode such as a silver electrode immersed in the cell electrolyte. The background cell current, the current draw in the absence of the desired electrolysis, is also determined. The electrolysis is completed when the current drops from the desired level to the background level.  In this manner, complete conversion of the initial metal complex can be easily detected.<br>
Suitable supporting electrolytes are salts comprising a cation and an inert, compatible, noncoordinating anion, A~. Preferred supporting electrolytes are salts corresponding to the formula:<br>
G+A-<br>
wherein:<br><br>
G+ is a cation which is nonreactive towards the starting and resulting complex; and<br>
A" is a noncoordinating, compatible anion.<br>
Examples of cations, G+, include tetrahydrocarbyl substituted ammonium or phosphonium cations having up to 40 nonhydrogen atoms. A preferred cation is the tetra-n-butylammonium cation.<br>
During activation of the complexes of the present invention by bulk electrolysis the cation of the supporting electrolyte passes to the counter electrode and A" migrates to the working electrode to become the anion of the resulting oxidized product. Either the solvent or the cation of the supporting electrolyte is reduced at the counter electrode in equal molar quantity with the amount of oxidized metal complex formed at the working electrode.  Preferred supporting electrolytes are tetrahydrocarbylammonium salts of tetrakis(perfluoro-aryl) borates having from 1 to 10 carbons in each hydrocarbyl group, especially tetra-n-butylammonivun tetrakisCpentafluorophenyl) borate.<br>
Suitable compounds useful as a cocatalyst in one embodiment of the present invention comprise a cation which is a Bronsted acid capable of donating a proton, and an inert, compatible, noncoordinating, anion, A~. Preferred anions are those containing a single coordination complex comprising a charge-bearing metal or metalloid core which anion is capable of balancing the charge of the active catalyst species (the metal cation) which is formed when the two components are combined. Also, said anion should be sufficiently labile to be displaced by olefinic, diolefinic and acetylenically unsaturated compounds or other neutral Lewis bases such as ethers or nitriles.  Suitable metals include, but are not limited to, aluminum, gold and platinum. Suitable metalloids include, but are not limited to, boron,<br><br>
phosphorus, and silicon.  Compounds containing anions which comprise coordination complexes containing a single metal or metalloid atom are, of course, well known and many, particularly such compounds containing a single boron atom in the anion portion, are available commercially.  Therefore, said single boron atom compounds are preferred.<br>

When the present bridged cyclopentadienyl polymerization catalysts are used to polymerize prochiral olefins, syndiotactic or isotactic polymers are attainable. As used herein, the term "syndiotactic" refers to polymers having a stereoregular structure of greater than 50 percent, preferably greater than 75 percent syndiotactic of a racemic triad as determined by ‘‘C  nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  Conversely, the term "isotactic" refers to polymers having a stereoregular structure of greater than 50 percent, preferably greater than 75 percent isotactic of a meso triad as determined by 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Such polymers may be usefully employed in the preparation of articles and objects having an extremely high resistance to deformation due to the effects of temperature via compression molding, injection molding or other suitable technique.<br>
The ethylene/1-olefin copolymers of the present invention are characteristic of the type of ethylene polymers that can be<br><br>
obtained with metallocene catalysts.  The polyolefins that can be produced with the catalysts of the present invention range from elastomeric to plastomeric, that is, substantially non—elastomeric products, depending on the monomers, monomer amounts and polymerization conditions employed.  As used herein the term "elastomeric" is meant to signify polymers having tensile modulus values as measured by ASTM D-638 of less than 15,000 N/cm2, preferably less than 5000 N/cm2, and most preferably less than 500 N/cm2, These products find application in all the uses heretofore developed for such polyolefins and can be fabricated into such end-use products by the methods heretofore developed for polyolefins including, for example, molding, casting, extrusion and spinning. The polyolefins obtained with the catalysts of the present invention are useful in such end-use applications as films for packaging, including shrink wrap applications, foams, coating, insulating devices, including for wire and cable, and household items. The polyolefins made with the catalysts of the present invention can be shown to have superior properties in these applications over heretofore used materials in these applications using the tests that have been established to measure performance in the intended end-use or by tests not heretofore applied to measure performance in such end-use applications.<br>

Suspension, solution, slurry, gas phase or high pressure, whether employed in batch or continuous form or under other process conditions, including the recycling of condensed monomers or solvent, may be employed if desired.

Suitable solvents for solution, suspension, slurry or high pressure polymerization processes are noncoordinating, inert liquids.  Examples include straight and branched-chain hydrocarbons such as isobutane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, and mixtures thereof; cyclic and alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane, and mixtures thereof; perfluorinated hydrocarbons such as perfluorinated C4-10 alkanes, and aromatic and alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, and xylene.  Suitable solvents also include liquid olefins which may act as monomers or comonomers including ethylene, propylene, butadiene, cyclopentene, 1-hexene, 3-methyl—1-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1-octene, 1-decene, styrene, divinylbenzene, allylbenzene, and vinyltoluene (including all isomers alone or in admixture).

Each hdlf of the cell is filled with 1,2-difluorobenzene solvent (5 ml in the working compartment, 4 ml in the counter compartment) and tetra-n-butylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate supporting electrolyte (8 mmol). The complex, bis(cyclopentadienyl)Zr s-trans(ii’-l,4—trans, trans-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene) (0.017 g) is placed in the working compartment. A sweep of the working electrode potential is used to determine the voltage to be applied during electrolysis.

Batch Solution Polymerization Procedure Examples 36-49<br>
All solvents and liquid monomers are sparged with nitrogen and, together with any gases used, are passed through activated alumina prior to use. A two liter reactor is charged with mixed alkanes solvent and optionally 1-octene or styrene comonomer. Propylene monomer, if used, is measured using a MicroMotion™ brand gas flow rate meter which gives total monomer supplied. Hydrogen, if desired, is added by differential pressure expansion from a 75 ml addition tank from 300 psig (2070 Kpa) to a lower pressure, usually 275 psig (1890 Kpa). Batch quantities of ethylene are then added using the flow meter.  If ethylene monomer is used on demand, the reactor contents are first heated to within S'C of the polymerization temperature and saturated with ethylene<br><br>
typically at 500 psig (3A50 Kpa).  The catalyst and cocatalyst are combined in toluene and transferred to a catalyst addition tank. When the reactor contents are at the desired run temperature, the polymerization is initiated by injecting the catalyst solution into the contents of the reactor. The polymerization temperature is maintained by external resistive heating and internal cooling for the desired run time.  The pressure is maintained at 500 psig (3450 Kpa) if ethylene is provided on demand.  Occasionally, additional catalyst and cocatalyst solution is added to the contents of the reactor in the foregoing manner. After the desired run time has elapsed, the contents of the reactor are removed and combined with hindered phenol antioxidant solution. Polymer is isolated by removing the volatile components from the reaction mixture in a vacuum oven set at from 120 to ISO'C for about 20 hours.<br>

Gas Phase Reactor Description<br>
Gas phase reactions were carried out in a 6-liter gas phase fluid bed reactor having a four inch diameter, thirty inch long, cylindrical fluidization zone and an eight inch diameter ten inch long velocity reduction zone which are connected by a transition section having tapered walls.  Monomers, hydrogen and nitrogen enter the bottom of the reactor where they pass through a gas distributor plate. The flow of gas is typically 2 to 8 times the minimum fluidization velocity of the solid particles. Most of the suspended solids disengage in the velocity reduction zone. The reactant gases exit the top of the fluidization zone and pass through a dust filter to remove any particulates. The gases then pass through a gas booster pump. No condensation of volatiles is<br><br>
employed.  The polymer is allowed to accumulate in the reactor over the course of the reaction. Polymer is removed from the reactor to a recovery vessel by opening a valve located at the bottom of the fluidization zone.  The polymer recovery vessel is kept at a lower pressure than the reactor.<br>
