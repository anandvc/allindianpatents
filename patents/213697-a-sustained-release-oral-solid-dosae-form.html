A SUSTAINED RELEASE ORAL SOLID DOSAGE FORM<br>
PENWEST PHARMACEUTICAL CO.,    a US company, of 2981 Route 22, Patterson, NY 12563-9970, United States of America.<br><br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The advantages of controlled release products are well known in the pharmaceutical field and include the ability to maintain a desired blood level of a medicament over a comparatively longer period of time while increasing patient compliance by reducing the number of administrations necessary to achieve the same. These advantages have been attained by a wide variety of methods. For example, different hydrogels have been described for use in controlled release medicines, some of which are synthetic, but most of which are semi-synthetic or of natural origin. A few contain both synthetic and non-synthetic material. However, some of the systems require special process and production equipment, and in addition some ofthese systems are susceptible to variable drug release.<br>
Oral controlled release delivery systems should ideally be adaptable so that release rates and profiles can be matched to physiological and chronotherapeutic requirements.<br>
For the most part, the release rate of oral delivery systems have been classified according to the mechanism of release, such as zero order, first order, second order, pseudo-first order, and the like, although many pharmaceutical compounds release medicament via other, complicated mechanisms.<br>
First order mechanisms refer to situations where the reaction rate is dependent on the concentration of the reacting substance (and therefore is dependent on the first power of the reactant). In such mechanisms, the substance decomposes directly into one or more products.<br>
Second order mechanisms occur when the experimentally determined rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of each of two reactants, or to the second power.of the concentration of one reactant.<br>
Pseudo first order reactions are generally defined as second order reactions which behave as though they are governed by a first order mechanism, and occur, for example, when the amount of one reacting material is manipulated by being present in great excess or being maintained at a constant concentration as compared to the other substance. In such circumstances, the reaction rate is determined by the manipulated substance.<br>
Zero order mechanisms refer to situations where the reaction rate is independent of the concentration of the reacting substance (and therefore is dependent on the zero power of the reactant), the limiting factor being something other than the concentration of the reacting<br>
- 2<br><br>
substance (e.g., the medicament). The limiting factor hi a zero order mechanism may be, for example, the solubility of the reacting substance or the light intensity in photochemical reactions. As previously mentioned, however, many chemical reactions are not simple reactions of zero-, first-, or second-order, and the like, and instead comprise a combination of two or more reactions.<br>
Moreover, other factors may influence the reaction rate, including temperature, pH, food effect variability, ions and ionic strength dependency, viscosity dependency, corrosion/erosion variability, content uniformity problems, flow and weight uniformityproblems, carrying capacity and mechanical strength problems, hydrolysis, photochemical decomposition, interaction between components (such as interactions between the drug and other ingredients in the formulation, such as buffers, preservatives, and the like), the concentration of solvents of low dielectric constant (when the reaction involves oppositely charged ions), etc.<br>
While many controlled and sustained release formulations are already known, certain soluble to highly soluble drugs present formulation difficulties when included in such formulations. Sustained release formulations with soluble drugs are susceptible to "dose dumping". This occurrence is where the release of the active ingredient is delayed, but when release is initiated, the rate is extremely high. This elevated release rate is associated with blood plasma fluctuations which can possibly result in decreased therapeutic effect or increased toxicity. These are the same problems which sustained release formulations are supposed to solve.<br>
Further, it is often not possible to readily predict whether a particular sustained release formulation will provide the desired sustained release for a soluble to highly soluble drug. It has generally been found that it is necessary to carry out considerable experimentation to obtain sustained release formulations providing the desired bioavailability of such drugs when ingested. In order to compensate for the unpredictability associated with having a controlled release formulation provide the desired sustained release for a soluble to highly soluble drug, it is sometimes considered desirable to provide a formulation with bi-modal or multi-phasic kinetics. Bimodal or multi-phasic release may be characterized by an initial high rate followed by a slower rate as the dosage form passes the upper portion of the small intestine where absorption is maximum and finally another higher rate as the dosage form passes into the further end of the<br>
3<br><br>
intestine where absorption is less than before.<br>
Bimodal release is considered to be advantageous for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the fact that bimodal release allows the formulator to compensate for changing absorption rates of the medicament in the gastrointestinal tract by providing a rapid onset of action (when the formulation is located in the stomach) and compensate for relatively slow absorption by providing a relatively rapid release rate (e.g., when the formulation is located in the large intestine).<br>
Bimodal release formulations have been provided in a number of different manners to date.<br>
For example, International Publication Number WO/87/00044 describes therapeutic formulations which are said to have bimodal release characteristics. WO 87/00044 describes a carrier base material for therapeutically active medicaments in a solid dosage formulation that are said to produce a bimodal controlled release profile characterized by a rapid initial release . of medicament followed by a substantially constant rate of release for a period of time, after which the release rate is greater than the constant rate previously observed. The carrier based material comprises bimodal hydroxypropylmethylcellulose ethers with a methoxy content of 19-30%, a hydroxy propoxy content of 4-12%, a viscosity of 40-19,000 cps, an average molecular weight of 20,000-140,000, and which demonstrates a bimodal release profile in accordance with an assaymethod described therein. Thebimodal hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses comprise 5-99% by weight of the total formulation, depending upon the active ingredient and length of drug released desire.<br>
A. C. Shah et al., "Gel-Matrix Systems Exhibiting Bimodal Controlled Release For Oral Drag Delivery", Journal of ControlledRelease,9(1989),pp. 169-175, further reported that certain "types" of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose ethers are found to display a bimodal drug release profile. However, in that study, series of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose ether polymers were found to provide bimodal and non-bimodal release profiles from polymer-drug matrix tablets, which results appeared to depend upon the supplier of the polymer (and therefore upon, e.g., the method of manufacture, ionic composition, variations in the distribution of substituent groups, or distribution of molecular weight fractions).<br>
P. Giunchedi et al., "Ketoprofen Pulsatile Absorption From "Multiple Unif Hydrophilic<br>
4<br><br>
Matrices" International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 77(1991), pp. 177-181 described an extended release oral formulation of Ketoprofen comprising a multiple unit formulation constituted by four hydrophilic matrices of identical composition, each containing 50 mg of drug and prepared with hydroxvpropylmethylcellulose(Methocel.RTM.) and placed in agelatin capsule. Pulsatile plasma levels (2 peaks at 2nd and 8th hours after dosing) were said to be obtained, whereas in vitro tests resulted in a fairly constant drug release.<br>
U. Conte et al., "A New Ibuprofen Pulsed Release Oral Dosage Form", Drug Development And Industrial Pharmacy, 15(14-16), pp 2583-2596 (1989) reported that apulsed released pattern was obtained from a 3-layer tablet wherein two layers contained a dose of drug, . and an intermediate layer acted as a control element separating the drug layers. The control element was a mixture of water-swellable polymers (hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses). An outer film of an impermeable polymer coated the tablet. A superdisintegrant (sodium starch glycolate and cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone) was included in the drug layers.<br>
K. A. Kahn et al, "Pharmaceutical Aspects And In-Vivo Performance Of Brufen Retard-An Ibuprofen SR Matrix Tablet", Proced. Intern. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact. Mater., 18(1991), Controlled Release Society, Inc., describes a formulation containing 800 mg of ibuprofen which is said to provide abimodal release pattern. The release retarding agent utilized therein was xanthan gum. The ingredients were blended to the appropriate xanthan gum content, and thereafter compressed into tablets and film coated. The amount of xanthan gum included inversely affected the rate of drug release. An increase in drug particle size or quantity of film-coat per tablet did not significantly effect the rate of drug release. Although an increase in particle size of the xanthan gum caused a more pronounced burst effect, the application of the film-coat overcame this burst effect. The rapid initial release of the medicament was hypothesized to be related to changes in the formation of the gel layer, wherein larger particles gel more slowly and are sloughed off before a coherent matrix can form.<br>
In our U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,994,276, 5,128,143, and 5,135,757, hereby incorporated by reference, we reported that a controlled release excipient which is comprised of synergistic heterodisperse polysaccharides (e.g., aheteropolysaccharide such as xanthan gum in combination with a polysaccharide gum capable of cross-linking with the heteropolysaccharide, such as locust bean gum) is capable of processing into oral solid dosage forms using either direct compression,<br><br><br><br>
5<br><br>
following addition of drug and lubricant powder, conventional wet granulation, or a combination of the two. The release of the medicament from the formulations therein proceeded according to zero-order or first-order mechanisms.<br>
Our own U.S. PatentNo. 5,472,711 and 5,478,574, hereby incorporated by reference, we report a formulation capable of providing multi-phasic or bi-phasic controlled release of a therapeutically active medicament in vitro by incorporating an effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant with the above refeienced excipient.<br>
An example of a highly soluble drug used in the present invention is diltiazem, which is a benzothiazine derivative possessing calcium antagonist activity. Diltiazem is widely used in the treatment of hypertension and angina. Accordingly, a great deal of attention has been given to the preparation of sustained release diltiazem which provides an acceptable release profile. For example U.S. Patent Nos. 4,894,240 and 5,364,620 (Geoghegan, et al.) describe a diltiazem pellet formulation suitable for once daily administration. This formulation comprises a diltiazem core in association with an organic acid, surrounded by an insoluble multi-layer membrane. The membrane allows the release of diltiazem from the pellet at a rate allowing controlled absorption over a 24 hour period following administration.<br>
Other techniques have been described in the prior art for preparing sustained release diltiazem formulations. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,419,917 (Chen et al.) describes a composition which controls the rate of release of diltiazem from a hydrogel using a pharmaceutically effective ionizable compound.<br>
Another example of a highly soluble drug used in the present invention is oxybutynin. Oxybutynin is widely used in the treatment of urological disorders, e.g., hyperactive bladder. Our own U.S. Patent No. 5,399,359 discloses an oxybutynin sustained release formulation comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of oxybutynin dispersed within a sustained release matrix comprising a gelling agent, an effective amount of apharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble cationic cross-linking agent which cross-links with the gelling agent when the formulation is exposed to an environmental fluid, e.g., gastrointestinal fluid, and an inert diluent.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The sustained release matrix of the present invention can be a heterodisperse excipient (as previously reported in our U.S. PatentNos. 4,994,276,5,128,143, and 5,135,757) which can comprise a gelling agent of both hetero- and homo- polysaccharides which exhibit synergism, e.g., the combination of two or more polysaccharide gums produce a higher viscosity and faster hydration than that which would be expected by either of the gums alone, the resultant gel being faster-forming and more rigid.<br>
The term "heteropolysaccharide" as used in the present invention is defined as a water-soluble polysaccharide containing two or more kinds of sugar units, the heteropolysaccharide having a branched or helical configuration, and having excellent water-wicking properties and immense thickening properties.<br>
An especially preferred heteropolysaccharide is xanthan gum, which is a high molecular weight (&gt;106) heteropolysaccharide. Other preferred heteropolysaccharides include derivatives<br>
11<br><br>
of xanthan gum, such as deacylated xanthan gum, the carboxymethyl ether, and the propylene glycol ester.<br>
The homopolysaccharide gums used in the present invention which are capable of cross-linking with the heteropolysaccharide include the galactomannans, i.e., polysaccharides which are composed solely of mannose and galactose. Galactomannans which have higher proportions of uns.ubstituted mannose regions have been found to achieve more interaction with the heteropolysaccharide. Locust bean gum, which has a higher ratio of mannose to the galactose, is especially preferred as compared to other galactomannans such as guar and hydroxypropyl guar.<br>
The controlled release properties of the controlled release formulations of the present invention may be optimized when the ratio of heteropolysaccharide gum to homopolysaccharide material is about 1:1.5, although heteropolysaccharide gum in an amount of from about 10 to about 90 percent or more by weight of the heterodisperse polysaccharide material provides an acceptable slow release product. The combination of any homopolysaccharide gums known to produce a synergistic effect when exposed to aqueous solutions maybe used in accordance with the present invention. It is also possible that the type of synergism which is present with regard to the gum combination of the present invention could also occur between two homogeneous or two heteropolysaccbarides. Other acceptable gelling agents which may be used in the present invention include those gelling agents well-known in the art. Examples include vegetable gums such as alginates, carrageenan, pectin, guar gum, modified starch, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, and other cellulosic materials such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose. This list is not meant to be exclusive.<br>
The inert diluent of the sustained release excipient preferably comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable saccharide, including a monosaccharide, a disaccharide, or a polyhydric alcohol, and/or mixtures of any of the foregoing. Examples of suitable inert pharmaceutical fillers include sucrose, dextrose, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, fructose, xylitol, sorbitol, starches, mixtures thereof and the like. However, it is preferred that a soluble pharmaceutical filler such as -lactose, dextrose, sucrose, or mixtures thereof be used. The inert diluent or filler may alternatively comprise a pre-manufactured direct compression diluent as set forth below.<br>
12<br><br>
For example, it is possible to dry mix the ingredients of the sustained release excipient without utilizing a wet granulation step. This procedure may be utilized, for example, where a wet granulation is to be accomplished when the active ingredient is directly added to the ingredients of the sustained release excipient.  On the other hand, this procedure may also be used where no wet granulation step whatsoever is contemplated.   If the mixture is to be manufactured without a wet granulation step, and the final mixture is to be tableted, it is preferred that all or part of the inert diluent comprise a pre-manufactured direct compression diluent.

In certain embodiments, the ingredients of the sustained release excipient can be pre-manufactured. However, in other embodiments the active drug can be added to the excipient ingredients and that mixture melt granulated to form a granulation. Finally, where a surfactant is used, the surfactant comprising the solubilized or dispersed diltiazem or oxybutynin can be added directly to the mixture of ingredients.<br>
In further embodiments of the present invention, the directly compressible inert diluent which is used in conjunction with the sustained release pharmaceutical excipient of the present invention is an augmented microcrystalline cellulose as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/370,576, filed January 9,1995, and entitled "PHARMACEUTICAL EXCIPIENT HAVING IMPROVED COMPRESSIBILITY", by J. Staniforth, B. Sherwood and E. Hunter, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The augmented microcrystalline cellulose described therein is commercially available under the tradename "Prosolv" from Penwest Pharmaceuticals Co.<br>
An effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant can also be added to the above-mentioned ingredients of the excipient, or added at the time the medicament is added, in order to increase the bioavailability of the medicament. An example of a suitable surfactant is docusate sodium in an amount up to about 15% by weight of the solid dosage form. An especially preferred surfactant is sodium lauryl sulfate in an amount up to about 15% by weight of the solid dosage form.<br>
In one embodiment, the surfactant is dissolved in a suitable solvent such as water, and is thereafter added to the blended mixture of the sustained release excipient and the medicament. This allows the surfactant to wet the particles of the excipient such that when the solvent evaporates the particles of the medicament which precipitate are tiny and do not aggregate. A granulate of the medicament and the surfactant is obtained which is preferably finely and homogeneously dispersed in the excipient.<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, e.g. wherein the medicament is diltiazem or oxybutynin, the surfactant is included in an amount e.g., from about. 1 % to about 5%, or from about 1% to about 15% of the final product, by weight. However, the upper limit of surfactant included can be higher than 15%. One limiting factor is that the final product should provide a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation. For example, in the case of tablets, the upper limit of<br><br><br>
14<br><br>
the amount of surfactant included is determined by the production of a pharmaceutically acceptable tablet, e.g., a tablet which has a friability of less than about 1% and a hardness of 6-8<br>
kg-<br>
The surfactants which may be used in the present invention generally include pharmaceutically acceptable anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, amphoteric (amphipathic/ amphophilic) surfactants, and non-ionic surfactants. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable anionic surfactants include, for example, monovalent alkyl carboxylates, acyl lacrylates, alkyl ether carboxylates, N-acyl sarcosinates, polyvalent alkyl carbonates, N-acyl glutamates, fatty acid-polypeptide condensates, sulfuric acid esters, alkyl sulfates (including sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)), ethoxylated alkyl sulfates, ester linked sulfonates (including docusate sodium or dioctyl sodium succinate (DSS)), alpha olefin sulfonates, and phosphated ethoxylated alcohols.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable cationic surfactants include, for example, monoalkyl quaternary ammonium salts, dialkyl quaternary ammonium compounds, amidoamines, and aminimides.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable amphoteric (amphipatbic/amphophilic) surfactants, include, for example, N-substituted alkyl amides, N-alkyl betaines, sulfobetaines, and N-alkyl 6-aminoproprionates.<br>
Other suitable surfactants for use in conjunction with the present invention include polyethyleneglycols as esters or ethers. Examples include polyethoxylated castor oil, polyethoxylated hydrogenated castor oil, polyethoxylated fatty acid from castor oil or polyethoxylated fatty acid from castor oil or polyethoxylated fatty acid from hydrogenated castor •oil. Commercially available surfactants which can be used are known under trade names Cremophor, Myrj, Polyoxyl 40 stearate, Emerest 2675, Lipal 395 and PEG 3350.<br>
The pH modifying agent facilitates the release of the drug from the matrix and is present from about 1% to about 50%; from about 1% to about 25% from about 1% to about 15%; or from about 1 % to about 10% by weight of the final dosage form. In preferred embodiments, the pH modifying agent is an organic acid such as citric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, maleic acid, glutaric acid or lactic acid.<br>
The ionizable gel strength enhancing agent which is optionally used in conjunction with the present invention may be monovalent or multivalent metal cations. The preferred salts are<br><br>
15<br><br>
the inorganic salts, including various alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal sulfates, chlorides,<br>
borates, bromides, citrates, acetates, lactates, etc. Specific examples of suitable ionizable gel<br>
strength enhancing agent include calcium sulfate, sodium chloride, potassium sulfate, sodium<br>
carbonate, lithium chloride, tripotassiura phosphate, sodium borate, potassium bromide,<br>
potassium fluoride, sodium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium citrate,<br>
sodium acetate, calcium lactate, magnesium sulfate and sodium fluoride. Multivalent metal<br>
cations may also be utilized. However, the preferred ionizable gel strength enhancing agent are<br>
bivalent. Particularly preferred salts are calcium sulfate and sodium chloride. The ionizable gel<br>
strength enhancing agent of the present invention are added in an amount effective to obtain a<br><br>
desirable increased gel strength due to the cross-linking of the gelling agent (e.g., theheteropoly-<br>
saccharide and horaopolysaccharide gums). In alternate embodiments, the ionizable gel strength<br>
enhancing agent is included in the sustained release excipient of the present invention in an<br>
amount from about 1 to about 20% by weight of the sustained release excipient, and in an amount<br>
0.5% to about 16% by weight of the final dosage form.<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, the sustained release matrix of the<br>
present invention comprises a sustained release excipient which comprises from about 10 to<br>
about 99 percent by weight of a gelling agent comprising a heteropolysaccharide gum and a<br>
homopolysaccharide gum, from about 0 to about 20 percent by weight of an ionizable gel<br>
strength enhancing agent, and from about 1 to about 89 percent by weight of an inert<br>
pharmaceutical diluent. In other embodiments, the sustained release excipient comprises from<br>
about 10 to about 75 percent gelling agent, from about 2 to about 15 percent ionizable gel<br>
strength enhancing agent, and from about 30 to about 75 percent inert diluent.  In yet other<br>
embodiments, the sustained release excipient comprises from about 30 to about 75 percent<br>
gelling agent, from about 5 to about. 10 percent ionizable gel strength. enhancing_agent, and from....<br>
about 15 to about 65 percent inert diluent.<br>
The sustained release excipient of the present invention (with or without the optional<br>
ionizable gel strength enhancing agent) may be further modified by incorporation of a<br>
hydrophobic materia} which slows the hydration of the gums without disrupting the hydrophilic<br>
matrix. This is accomplished in alternate embodiments of the present invention by granulating<br>
the sustained release excipient with the solution or dispersion of a hydrophobic material prior to<br><br><br>
16<br><br>
the incorporation of the medicament. The hydrophobic polymer may be selected from an alkylcellulose such as ethylcellulose, other hydrophobic cellulosic materials, polymers or copolymers derived from acrylic or methacrylic acid esters, copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic acid esters, zein, waxes, shellac, hydrogenated vegetable oils, and any other pharmaceutically acceptable hydrophobic material known to those skilled in the art. The amount of hydrophobic material incorporated into the sustained release excipient is that which is effective to slow the hydration of the gums without disrupting the hydrophilic matrix formed upon exposure to an environmental fluid. In certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, the hydrophobic material is included in the sustained release excipient in an amount from about 1 to about 20 percent by weight. The solvent for the hydrophobic material may be an aqueous or organic solvent, or mixtures thereof.<br>
In embodiments where the sustained release excipient of the present invention has been pre-manufactured, it is then possible to blend the same with the medicament, e.g., in a high shear mixer. In certain especially preferred embodiments, the medicament is a therapeutically effective benzothiazine which are useful for the treatment of circulatory disorders and high blood pressure. An especiallypreferreddihydropyridineis diltiazem. Useful formulations of diltiazem generally contain daily doses from about 30 to about 500 mg, preferably from about 120 mg to about 480 mg. In certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, the dosage form includes a dosage of diltiazem in an amount of 120 mg, 180 mg, 240 mg, or 300 mg for 24 hour formulations; and a dosage of diltiazem in an amount of 60 mg, 90 mg and 120 mg for 12 hour formulations.<br>
In certain other especially preferred embodiments, the medicament is oxybutynin which is useful for the treatment of urological disorders. Useful formulations of oxybutynin generally contain daily doses from about 2.5 mg to about 50 mg, e.g., from about 2.5 mg to about 25 mg for 12 hour formulations and from about 5 mg to about 50 mg for 24 hour formulations. In certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, the dosage form includes a dosage of oxybutynin in an amount of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg for 24 hour formulations.<br>
An effective amount of any generally accepted pharmaceutical lubricant, including calcium or magnesium soaps is preferably added to the mixture of ingredients (including medicament) prior to compression of the mixture into oral solid dosage forms, such as tablets.<br>
17<br><br>
An example of a suitable lubricant is magnesium stearate in an amount of about 0.5 to about 3% by weight of the solid dosage form. An especiallypreferred lubricant is sodium stearyl fumarate, NF, commercially available under the trade name Pruv® from Penwest Pharmaceuticals Co.<br>
The sustained release excipients of the present invention have uniform packing characteristics over a range of different particle size distributions and are capable of processing into the final dosage form (e.g., tablets) using either direct compression, following addition of drug and lubricant powder, or conventional wet granulation.<br>
The properties and characteristics of a specific excipient system prepared according to the present invention is dependent in part on the individual characteristics of the homo and heteropolysaccharide constituents, in terms of polymer solubility, glass transition temperatures etc., as well as on the synergism both between different homo- and heteropolysaccharides and between the homo and heteropolysaccharides and the inert saccharide constituent(s) in modifying dissolution fluid-excipient interactions.<br>
The combination of the gelling agent (i.e., a mixture of xanthan gum and locust bean gum) with the inert diluent, with or without the ionizable gel strength enhancing agent and hydrophobic polymer, provides a ready-to-use sustained release excipient product in which a formulator need only blend the desired active medicament, the pH modifying agent, the surfactant and an optional lubricant with the excipient before compressing the mixture to form slow release tablets. The excipient may comprise a physical admix of the gums along with a soluble excipient such as compressible sucrose, lactose or dextrose, although it is preferred to granulate or agglomerate the gums with plain (i.e., crystalline) sucrose, lactose, dextrose, etc., to form an excipient. The granulate form has certain advantages including the fact that it can be optimized for flow and compressibility; it can be tableted, formulated in a capsule, extruded and _spjierpiuzed_.wlth.an active medicament to form pellets, etc.<br>
The pharmaceutical excipients prepared in accordance with the present invention may be prepared according to any agglomeration technique to yield an acceptable excipient product. In wet granulation techniques, the desired amounts of the heteropolysaccharide gum, the hom.opolysaccharide gum, and the inert diluent are mixed together and thereafter a-moistening agent such as water, propylene glycol, glycerol, alcohol or the like is added to prepare a moist¬ened mass. Next, the moistened mass is dried. The dried mass is then milled with conventional<br>
18<br><br>
equipment into granules. Therefore, the excipient product is ready to use.<br>
The pre-manufactured sustained release excipient is preferably free-flowing and directly compressible. Accordingly, the excipient may be mixed in the desired proportion with a therapeutically active medicament and optional lubricant (dry granulation). Alternatively, all or part of the excipient may be subjected to a wet granulation with the active ingredient and thereafter tableted. When the final product to be manufactured is tablets, the complete mixture, in an amount sufficient to make a uniform batch of tablets, is then subjected to tableting in a conventional production scale tableting machine at normal compression pressure, i.e. about 2000-1600 Ibs/sq in. However, the mixture should not be compressed to such a degree that there is subsequent difficulty in its hydration when exposed to gastric fluid.<br>
One of the limitations of direct compression as a method of tablet manufacture is the size of the tablet. If the amount of active is high a pharmaceutical formulator may choose to wet granulate the active with other excipients to attain a decent size tablet with the right compact strength. Usually the amount of filler/binder or excipients needed in wet granulation is less than that in direct compression since the process of wet granulation contributes to some extent toward the desired physical properties of a tablet.<br>
When the medicament is diltiazem, the average tablet size for round tablets is preferably about 300 mg to 750 mg and for capsule-shaped tablets about 700 mg to 1000 mg.<br>
The average particle size of the granulated excipient of the present invention preferably ranges from about 50 microns to about 400 microns and preferably from about 185 microns to about 265 microns. The particle size of the granulation is not narrowly critical, the important-parameter being that the average particle size of the granules, must permit the formation of a directly compressible excipient which forms pharmaceutically acceptable tablets. The desired tap and bulk densities of the granulation of the present invention are.normally between from about 0.3 to about 0.8 g/ml, with an average density of from about 0.5 to about 0.7 g/ml. For best results, the tablets formed from the granulations of the present invention are from about 5 to about 20 kg hardness. The average flow of the granulations prepared in accordance with the present invention"are preferably from about 25 to about 40 g/sec. Tablets compacted using an instrumented rotary tablet machine have been found to possess strength profiles which are largely independent of the inert saccharide component. Scanning electron photomicrographs of largely<br>
19<br><br><br>
tablet surfaces have provided qualitative evidence of extensive plastic deformation on compaction, both at the tablet surface and across the fracture surface, and also show evidence of surface pores through which initial solvent ingress and solution egress may occur.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the tablet is coated with a sufficient amount of a hydrophobic polymer to render the formulation capable of further modifying the release of the medicament. The hydrophobic polymer which is included in the tablet coating may be the same or differrent material as compared to the hydrophobic polymeric which is optionally granulated with the sustained release excipient<br>
In other embodiments of the present invention, the tablet coating may comprise an enteric coating material in addition to or instead of the hydrophobic polymer coating. Examples of suitable enteric polymers include cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, methacrylic acid copolymer, shellac, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, and mixtures of any of the foregoing. An example of a suitable commercially available enteric material is available under the trade name Eudragit™ L30D55.<br>
In further embodiments, the dosage form may be coated with a hydrophilic coating in addition to or instead of the abovcrnentioned coatings. An example of a suitable material which may be used for such a hydrophilic coating is hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose (e.g., Opadry®" commercially available from Colorcon, West Point, Pennsylvania).<br>
The coatings may be applied in any pharmaceutically acceptable manner known to those skilled in the art. For example, in one embodiment, the coating is applied via a fluidizedbed or n a coating pan. For example, the coated tablets maybe dried, e.g.,.at about 60-70° C for about 5-4 hours in a coating pan. The solvent for the hydrophobic polymer or enteric coating may be organic, aqueous, or amixture of an organic and an aqueous solvent. The organic solvents may be, e.g., isopropyl alcohol, ethanoJ, and the like, with or without water.<br>
In additional embodiments of the present invention, a support platform is applied to the ablets manufactured in accordance with the present invention. Suitable support platforms are /ell known to those skilled in the art. An example of suitable support platform is set forth, e.g., 3 U.S. Patent No. 4,839,177, hereby incorporated by reference. In that patent, the support latform partially coats the tablet, and consists of a polymeric material insoluble in aqueous<br>
. 20<br><br><br>
liquids. The- support platform may, for example, be designed to maintain its impermeability characteristics during the transfer of the therapeutically active medicament. The support platform maybe applied to the tablets, e.g., via compression coating onto part of the tablet surface, by spray coating the polymeric materials comprising the support platform onto all or part of the tablet surface, or by immersing the tablets in a solution of the polymeric materials.<br>
The support platform may have a thickness of, e.g., about 2 mm if applied by compression, and about 10 u if applied via spray-coating or immersion-coating. Generally, in embodiments of the invention wherein a hydrophobic polymer or enteric coating is applied to the tablets, the tablets are coated to a weight gain from about 1 to about 20%, and in certain embodiments preferably from about 5% to about 10%.<br>
Materials useful in the hydrophobic coatings and support platforms of the present invention include derivatives of acrylic acid (such as esters of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and copolymers thereof) celluloses and derivatives thereof (such as ethylcellulose), polyvinylalcohols, and the like.<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, the tablet core includes an additional dose of the medicament included in either the hydrophobic or enteric coating, or in an additional overcoating coated on the outer surface of the tablet core (without the hydrophobic or enteric coating) or as a second coating layer coated on the surface of the base coating comprising the hydrophobic or enteric coating material. This may be desired when, for example, a loading dose of a therapeutically active agent is needed to provide therapeutically effective blood levels of the active agent when the formulation is first exposed to gastric fluid. The loading dose of medicament included in the coating layer may be, e.g., from about 10% to about 40% of the total amount of medicament included in the formulation.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention^the-final formulation provides bi-modal or multi-phasic plasma levels when the medicament is diltiazem.<br>
In preferred embodiments, when the medicament is diltiazem, the formulations of the invention provide a first time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax #1) of the diltiazem in about 4 to about 10 hours after oral administration of the dosage form to the patient. In certain preferred embodiments, the first time to peak plasma concentration occurs from about 6 to about 8 hours after oral administration. In preferred embodiments, the maximum plasma concentration<br>
21<br><br>
of diltiazem at the first Tmax (Cmax #1) is from about 50 to about 100mg/ml, per administration of a 240 mg dosage of diltiazem in an oral sustained release dosage form in accordance with the invention.<br>
In further preferred embodiments of the invention, the sustained release diltiazem formulations provide a second peak plasma concentration (Cmax #2) which occurs in about 10 to about 16 hours after oral administration of the dosage form to the patient (Tmax #2). In certain preferred embodiments, the second peak plasma concentration (Cmax #2) occurs in about 12 to about 14 hours after oral administration of the dosage form to the patient (Tmax #2). In preferred embodiments, the maximum plasma concentration of diltiazem at Cmax #2 is from about 60 to about 90 ng/ml, per 240mg diltiazem administered over the 24 hour period.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the sustained release diltiazem formulations provide a the W50 of Cmax #1 (defined for purposes of the present invention as the width of the plasma concentration curve at 50% of the height of the first Cmax (Cmax #1), based on a trough taken at the Cmin between Cmax #1 and Cmax #2) is from about 0.5 to about 4 hours, preferably from about 1 to about 3 hours.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the sustained release diltiazem formulations provide a W50 of Cmax #2 (defined for purposes of the present invention as the width of the plasma concentration curve at 50% of the height of the second Cmax (Cmax #2), based on a the trough taken at the Cmin between Cmax #1 and Cmax #2) is from about 0.5 to about 8 hours, preferably from about 2 to about 6 hours.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the sustained release diltiazem formulations of the<br>
invention provide a ratio of Cmax #1 to Cmax #2 from about 0.5:1 to about 1.5:1; preferably<br>
from about 0.7:1 to about 1.2:1.	.<br>
Based on the dosage of diltiazem in the sustained release- oral formulations of the invention, one can easily determine the Cmax # 1, Cmax #2, Tmax #1 and Tmax #2 for different dosages of diltiazem over a 12 or 24 hour period.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments of the invention when the medicament is oxybutynin, the formulation provides a time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) of oxybutynin in about 5 to about 15 hours, preferably in about 8 to about 12 hours.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following examples illustrate various aspects of the present invention. They are not to be construed to limit the claims in any manner whatsoever.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-2<br>
EFFECT OF DRUG:GUM RATIO IN FORMULATION In Example 1 -2, sustained release excipients in accordance with the present invention are first prepared, the medicament (in this case diltiazem) and the pH modifying agent.(in this case being fumaric acid) being added subsequently, and the final mixture then being tableted.<br>
The sustained release excipient is prepared by dry blending the requisite amounts of xanthan gum, locust bean gum, and dextrose in a high speed mixer/granulator for 3 minutes. -While running choppers/impellers, water is added to the dry blended mixture, and granulated for another 3 minutes. The granulation is then dried in a fluid bed dryer to a LOD (loss on drying) of less than about 10% by weight (e.g., 4-7% LOD). The granulation is then milled using 20 mesh screens and dispensed into a granulator. The ingredients of the granulations of Examples<br><br><br>
 24<br><br>
1-2 are set forth in Table 1 below:<br>

2.	Locust Bean Gum	30	18<br><br>
3	Dextrose	50	70<br>
4	Water	30	25<br>

Next, the desired amount of diltiazem , fumaric acid and a suitable amount of water are mixed for 5 minutes with an impeller type mixer to form a slurry: The slurry is then added to the sustained release excipient over a 1 minute interval in the granulator, with the impeller running on low speed. Next, the mixture is granulated for 2 minutes with the chopper and impeller on high speed (additional water and granulation time may be used to form proper granules). The resultant granules are then dried in a fluid bed dryer until LOD is less than 5% and milled with hammer forward at 2000-3000 rpm. The milled granulation is then placed in a V-Blender with sodium lauryl sulfate and blended for 10 minutes. A suitable tableting lubricant (Pruv®, sodium steary] fumarate, NF, commercially available from Penwest Phannaceuticals Co. is added, and the mixture is blended for another 3 minutes. The resultant granulation is then compressed into tablets using a capsule shaped punch. This final mixture is tableted to approximately 768 mg. The ingredients of the tablets of Examples 1-2 are set forth in Table 2 below:<br><br><br>

Thereafter, diltiazem tablets are prepared as follows:<br>
The desired amount of diltiazem , fumaric acid and the sustained release excipient are placed in a granulator and mixed for 3 minutes at low speed. Water is added over a 2 minute interval while"the impeller is running at low speed (additional water and granulation time may be used to form proper granules). The resultant granules are then dried in a fluid bed dryer until LOD is less than 5% and milled with hammer forward at 2000-3000 rpm using screen #0050. The milled granulation is then placed in a V-Blender with sodium lauryl sulfate and blended for 10 minutes. A suitable tableting lubricant (Pruv®, sodium stearyl fumarate, NF,<br>
commercially available, from Penwest Pharmaceuticals Co.) is added, and the mixture is	<br>
blended for another 5 minutes. The resultant granulation is then compressed into tablets using a capsule shaped punch. This final mixture is tableted to approximately 750 mg. The ingredients of the tablets of Examples 3-4 are set forth in Table 5 below:<br><br><br>
