				<td>Introduction to the Field of Invention:<br>
Improvements in or relating to the method of processing blend coal suited for coke oven use.<br>
This invention relates to improvements in or relating to the method of processing blend coal<br>
suited for coke oven use and a system therefore.<br>
Prior Art and Drawbacks:<br>
It is well known to process coal, taken from the bunker, before feeding to the coke oven to<br>
crush to 0-3 mm size without producing more fines (-0.25 mm).<br>
In general, fine coals with &gt; 8% moisture content become sticky mass and do not allow free<br>
flow in transfer chutes. It affects size separation systems. High moisture content also reduces<br>
bulk density of fine coals. As a result, productivity of coal preparation plant and quality of coal<br>
prepared are affected.<br>
The problem has been solved to a certain extent by the addition of oil to the extent of 0.1 to<br>
0.5 wt.% to the coal. This has to a limited extent solved or improved the How problem and to<br>
improved bulk density of moist fine coals.<br>
But there is a drawback due to high combustibility of oil used with combustible coal and extra<br>
fire safety measure is needed till oiled coal is consumed.<br>
Besides, oil is a costly material. For this reason only oil addition system on fine coal is rarely<br>
used in the industry.<br>
Moreover, the amount of oil used adds up to the cost and affects the economy of the process.<br>
Objects of the Invention;<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose an improved method for the processing of<br>
coal economically before feeding to the coke oven.<br>
It is another object to propose a method, which will enable fluidization of fine coal preferably<br>
from the coarse fraction in the pneumatic classifier even with moisture more than 8 wt.%.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose such a method, which will ensure processed coal having<br>
substantially lower fine fractions (-0.25 mm) coal suited for coke oven.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose such a processing of coal, which will consume minimum oil<br>
compared to the amount of oil consumed in the known art.<br>
Yet another object is to propose such a process, which will be free of blockage of processing units and<br>
ensure free flow of coal at different units during processing.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose such a process, which can use any waste oil (hydro<br>
carbon) having low viscosity and will thus improve the economy of the process.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose such a process, which will increase the bulk density of<br>
processed coal enabling increased oven throughput.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a novel system for processing coal before making it<br>
suitable for coke oven operation.<br>
These and other objects of the invention will be clear from the following paragraphs.<br>

Additional Details of the Invention with Reference to the Accompanying Drawing:<br>
The novel processing step is explained with reference to the accompanying drawing, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates, schematically, the various units of the system and the various steps of the<br>
process.<br>
Thus, from the accompanying drawings, it will be seen that the system for processing coal<br>
comprises:<br>
1-Oil storage tank;<br>
2-Water tank;<br>
3-Pump;<br>
4-Pump with flame proof motor;<br>
5-Emuision tank;<br>
6-Primary crusher;<br>
7-Secondary crusher;<br>
8-Chutes;<br>
9-Conveyor belt from blending bunker;<br>
10-Pneumatic classifier;<br>
11-Final coal charge.<br>
These units are interconnected as shown in the drawings.<br>
In operation, the processing steps are as follows:<br>
Oil and water are drawn respectively from the underground oil tank (1) and the water reservoir (2)<br>
through pumps (3 &amp; 4) to emulsion tank (5). A pump with flame proof motor (4) keeps oil and<br>
water in emulsion form. Emulsion is, sprayed on coal fed from the conveyor (0) inside the transfer<br>
chutes (8), which feed the primary crusher (6). The discharge from the primary crusher is fed into<br>
a pneumatic classifier (10).<br>
The coarse grains from this unit (10) is then fed through another transfer chute (8) into the<br>
secondary crusher (7). The discharge from this crusher (7) is also fed into the classifier (10).<br>
As a result, water-oil emulsion is well mixed with fine coals and become free flowing. It helps<br>
efficient separation of fines from coarse coal particles in air fluidized pneumatic classifier (10).<br>
The product is taken out as stream (11).<br>
The addition of oil can be added on coal blend on conveyor belt effectively with due care to avoid<br>
direct exposure to empty conveyor belt surface,<br>
We have found surprisingly that the bulk density of moist fine coal increases by 1 to 3% with<br>
addition of water-oil emulsion, based on usage level of the emulsion, oil-water ratio, original<br>
moisture content and fineness of the coal.<br>
In an actual study, the bulk density of coal charge (3 mm content 82%, and moisture 8.4%)<br>
increased from 799 kg/m3 to 819 kg/m3 with addition of 0.03% oil and 0.18% water in form of<br>
emulsion.<br>
We have studied the use of different oils, which can suit our requirements. We have found after<br>
several exploratory studies that oil may be any waste oil having low viscosity, like waste machine<br>
oil, waste transformer oil or fresh light naphtha, diesel oil, kerosene oil etc. Lighter oils are more<br>
effective than the heavier or viscous oils.<br>
This new process/technique of addition of oil in the form of water-oil emulsion solved flow<br>
problem and increases bulk density of coal fines with high moisture. In this process, 0.01-0.05%<br>
of oil with 2-7 times water is sufficient to solve these problems with very little additional fire<br>
hazard.<br>
Further Exploratory Details of Performance Characteristic:<br>
Table 1 shows the performance of pneumatic classifier used in a study without and with emulsion<br>
addition during monsoon period of 1999 and 2000. Finer fractions (
significantly from the coarse fraction with use of water-oil emulsion.<br>
Table 2 shows comparative performance of coke oven during two consecutive monsoon period<br>
when coal Wend become highly moist (&gt;8%). During 2Q00 monsoon, 0.02-0.05% of diesel oil with<br>
3 to 7 times water was used in the coal charge. During 1999, no emulsion was added. There was<br>
no chute jamming, no stopping of crusher and bypassing of pneumatic separator. Production of<br>
prepared coal charge was normal and there was no prepared coal shortage to affect oven<br>
charging.<br>

Use of water-oil emulsion in coal charge at laboratory study indicated improvement in bulk density<br>
shown in Table-Ill. Addition of more than 0.05% oil with 8 times water does not improve bulk<br>
density significantly.<br>

The new process has following advantages compared to use of oil only.<br>
• It reduces fire hazard significantly. When water-oil emulsion is used, only extra safety<br>
measure is needed up to preparation of emulsion, compared to total coal stream after<br>
addition of oil only.<br>
• Consumption of oil reduced by 1/10th as only 0.01-0.05% is used in this system against<br>
0.1 to 0.5% when only oil is used.<br>
• It prevents chute jamming and improves performance of separation system such as<br>
pneumatic classifier even up to 10% moisture content.<br>
• The process improves bulk density of coal charge and hence, coke oven throughput by<br>
1-3.5%.<br>
