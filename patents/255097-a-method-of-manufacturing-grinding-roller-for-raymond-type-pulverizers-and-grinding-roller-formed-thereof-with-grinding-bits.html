FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing grinding<br>
rollers for Raymond type pulverizers and grinding roller formed<br>
thereof with grinding bits. More particularly the present invention<br>
relates to the methods of manufacture and replacement of grinding<br>
roller of frustum-conical shape used to grind coal in vertical spindle<br>
mills of Raymond design,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIN WITH PRIOR ART<br>
DIFFICULTES:<br>
In bowl mill raw coal is fed through center feed pipe. Coal falls at the<br>
center of the rotating bowl. Bowl is lined with replaceable hard liners<br>
called bull ring segments. Due to centrifugal force, the coal starts<br>
moving towards the bowl periphery in a spiraling fashion. In the<br>
existing process the bowl mill is adopted in such a manner that coal<br>
comes between the grinding roll and bull ring segments and gets<br>
crushed. The crushed coal is then carried by the hot air under<br>
pressure to the classifier section for further transportation to the<br>
boiler for firing.<br>
For imparting the grinding pressure required, spring assembly is<br>
provided which presses down the grinding roll on to the bull ring<br>
segments. There are three rolls kept 120 degrees apart. Similarly<br>
there are 3 spring assemblies to press them down. There is provision<br><br>
-3-<br>
in these mills to adjust the gap between grinding roller and bull ring<br>
segments by moving the grinding roller down and forward. Due to<br>
abrasive nature of the coal, both grinding rollers and bull ring<br>
segments get worn out and gap between them widens. Approximate<br>
life ranges of the bowl mill is from 2000-4000 hours depending on<br>
the material of the wearing elements and abrasiveness of the coal.<br>
Grinding rollers and bull ring segments are replaced periodically.<br>
Grinding rollers for Vertical Pulverizing mills are generally made from<br>
White cast iron outer layer and a soft core of grey/nodular iron. In<br>
this process, which is centrifugal casting, first the white cast iron is<br>
poured at temperature of around 1280 Deg C and immediately after<br>
that grey/nodular iron is poured to form a metallurgical bond. White<br>
cast iron is very hard, which gives wear resistant properties. Ductile<br>
cast iron/nodular iron gives toughness to withstand the impact and it<br>
is easy to machine to match the outside diameter of the housing.<br>
However, rollers made from this method result in a distinct collar<br>
(hump) formation at bigger or smaller or on both ends during the<br>
operation of these rollers. This means that only the center part wears<br>
leaving the edges without much wear. This prevents proper<br>
adjustment of gap between the grinding roller and bullring segments,<br>
resulting in improper grinding.<br>
In vertical spindle mills of Raymond type there is provision to adjust<br>
the gap between the grinding roll and bullring segments by lowering<br><br>
-4-<br>
or raising the grinding roller. But the pattern of the wear is such that<br>
uniform gap cannot be maintained,<br>
In the conventional roller replacement process, 3 Journal Opening<br>
Cover (door) which give access to the rollers are opened and entire<br>
Journal assembly is taken out and the grinding roller is replaced,<br>
which process is much time consuming.<br>
Another disadvantage of the prior art is that with the passage of time<br>
due to wear action of the coal, the outer surface of the roller<br>
becomes smooth. This leads to slippage of the roller and leads to the<br>
fall in the grinding efficiency.<br>
Another disadvantage of the rollers made from the conventional<br>
casting process (either centrifugally cast or static cast), is that the<br>
entire set of 3 rollers is replaced with a new set. The worn out, which<br>
is thrown, roller weighs approximately between 500 Kilograms to<br>
1200 Kilograms, depending upon the size, of cast/nodular iron with<br>
some amount of nickel or high chrome material stili in it. This leads<br>
to great wastage of natural resources.<br>
The present invention has proposed to remove the difficulties of the<br>
aforesaid prior art disadvantages.<br><br>
-5-<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
One object of the Invention is to propose a method of manufacture of<br>
grinding roiis through mechanically fastened grinding bite, replacing<br>
worn out bits and making the roller new and efficient again.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide grinding bits<br>
arrangement such that there is soft metal portion between the two<br>
bits, which soft metal portion gets worn out faster than the very hard<br>
grinding bits, to enable the grinding bits project out with gap<br>
between them so that these projecting bits act like gear teeth and<br>
bite Into and plough in the coal thus vastly improving the grinding<br>
process.<br>
An yet another object of the invention is to provide removable<br>
mechanical fastening means for fixing of bits of high wear resistant<br>
material on the top surface of the base roller with clamping plates,<br>
screws or by welding.<br>
With the rollers made form the grinding bits, the entire roller can be<br>
used as It is, after replacing the worn out bits with new bits.<br>
Replacement of the conventional rollers takes about 2 to 3 shifts with<br>
3 to 4 men working. This entails removal of the Journal Opening<br>
Covers, removal of roller assemblies or tilt out roller assemblies.<br><br>
-6-<br>
This method of replacement entails handling of heavy paits with<br>
cranes, hoists etc.<br>
Replacement of grinding bits according to the invention would take a<br>
fraction of that time of conventional grinding roll for replacement,<br>
thus vastly improving the availability of mills for power generation.<br>
The present invention has developed grinding rollers and method of<br>
producing the grinding rollers for Raymond type pulverizers in a new<br>
approach by forming grinding bits of high wear resistant: material of<br>
sintered earbide or high chrome or equivalent material, with formed<br>
holes In the bits to fix fastening means, forming the base of the roller<br>
through casting or fabrication of plate, tapped holes at both sides of<br>
the rollers, providing clearance/tapped holes in the bits and<br>
maintaining inside surface of the bits having contour in matching<br>
relationship with the conical face of the base, connecting 2 or 3 rows<br>
of bits through stud rods and fastening to the base roller through<br>
clamp plates and screw arrangement through the formed holes in the<br>
grinding bits.<br>
The grinding bits produced according to the invention have soft metal<br>
portions on the outside face of their periphery and have hard metal<br>
portions at the center.<br>
The proposed invention will be better understood from the following<br>
description with reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br><br>
-16-<br>
means comprising of clamping plates (11), screws (08) and nut<br>
(10) to constitute the completed roll and thus securing easy and<br>
faster replacement of worn out grinding bit/s only on releasing the<br>
fastening means.<br>
9. The grinding bits of high wear resistant material as formed<br>
according to method of claim 1 to constitute a grinding roller<br>
for coal pulverizing.<br>

In conventional grinding roller the wear pattern of roller made from<br>
centrifugally cast white cast iron material is shown in Figure 17. The<br>
figure 17 shows the center part of the roller wears leaving the edges<br>
without much wear. This uneven wear of the roller leads to fall in<br>
throughput and fall in the quality (finesses required) of output. This<br><br>
-9-<br>
defect leads to coal reject through reject spout, thus wasting the<br>
precious coal.<br>
The present Invention has developed a roller wherein the grinding<br>
bits of a roller are made of high wear resistant material like sintered<br>
carbide or high chrome or other high wear resisting material. The<br>
said grinding bits are shown in figurers 5 to 8 wherein the grinding<br>

said base roll (01) has tapped hole (02) at both sides through which<br>
the grinding bits (05) are fastened with base roll by clamping plate<br>
(11) and screws (08), grinding bits (5) have clearance/tapped holes<br>
(06) in them, as shown in figures 5# 6, 7 &amp; 8. Inside surface of the<br>

through stud rods (09) and with the help of clamping plate (11), nut<br>
(09) and screws (08) are fastened to the base roller (01). This<br>
fastening means is shown in figure 18. The complete assembled rolls<br>
