				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
POROUS MULTILAYERED HOLLOW-FIBER MEMBRANE AND<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a porous hollow fiber membrane formed of a<br>
thermoplastic resin which has minute pores and high water permeability suitable for<br>
filtration and exhibits excellent strength, and a stable production thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
As a method of purifying river water for use as service water and the like, a<br>
filtration method utilizing a porous hollow fiber membrane which improves safety of<br>
treated water and reduces the installation space is being widely used. A porous hollow<br>
fiber membrane is required to exhibit high blocking performance which can reliably<br>
remove bacteria (e.g., cryptosporidium) and components making water turbid, high water<br>
permeability for treating a large quantity of water, and high strength which enables<br>
long-term use under a wide range of operating conditions (e.g., chemical washing and<br>
operation under high operating pressure).<br>
[0003]<br>
A concept of obtaining a porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane which exhibits<br>
high blocking performance and high water permeability by bonding a blocking layer<br>
having a small pore diameter and a strength support layer having a large pore diameter is<br>
disclosed in Patent Document 1, for example. Specifically, Patent Document 1 discloses<br>
a method in which a crystalline thermoplastic resin such as polyethylene is melt-extruded<br>
1<br>
without adding a solvent, and a porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane is produced<br>
from the resulting hollow fiber extruded product using a stretch pore-forming method.<br>
The term "stretch pore-forming method" refers to a method in which a hollow fiber<br>
extruded product is stretched in the longitudinal direction at a high stretch ratio to cleave<br>
the lamellar crystal stack to obtain a porous membrane (see Non-patent Document 1). In<br>
Patent Document 1, crystalline thermoplastic resins which differ in melt index (MI) are<br>
melt-extruded from two circular nozzles disposed concentrically. This is because the<br>
method disclosed in Patent Document 1 utilizes the property that resins which differ in<br>
MI (i.e., differ in molecular weight) have different pore diameters upon stretch<br>
pore-forming. As a result, a porous two-layer hollow fiber membrane in which the outer<br>
layer and the inner layer differ in pore diameter is obtained. However, a porous<br>
multilayer hollow fiber membrane exhibiting high strength cannot be obtained by the<br>
method due to the following problems.<br>
(1)        The strength of the porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane in the stretch axis<br>
direction is increased by stretching at a high stretch ratio. However, bursting strength<br>
and compressive strength (i.e., strength in the direction perpendicular to the stretch axis)<br>
important for filtration tend to decrease.<br>
(2)        In principle, the outer layer and the inner layer must differ in molecular weight or<br>
polymer type. However, required properties such as chemical resistance and mechanical<br>
strength differ depending on the molecular weight or polymer type. Therefore, when<br>
using a resin having low strength, the strength of the entire membrane decreases.<br>
Therefore, a membrane exhibiting high strength cannot be obtained. Moreover,<br>
since a membrane obtained by this method has a structure in which the pore diameter in<br>
the longitudinal direction of the hollow fiber is larger than the pore diameter in the<br>
thickness direction, the membrane shows low bursting strength and low compressive<br>
strength.<br>
[0004]<br>
2<br>
Therefore, a porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane which exhibits high<br>
blocking performance, high water permeation rate, and high strength and a process for<br>
stably producing such a porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane have not yet been<br>
obtained.<br>
[0005]<br>
A thermally induced phase separation method has been known as a method for<br>
producing a porous membrane. This method utilizes a thermoplastic resin and an<br>
organic liquid. The organic liquid serves as a latent solvent which does not dissolve the<br>
thermoplastic resin at room temperature, but dissolves the thermoplastic resin at a high<br>
temperature. In the thermally induced phase separation method, the thermoplastic resin<br>
and the organic liquid are mixed at a high temperature so that the thermoplastic resin is<br>
dissolved in the organic liquid. The mixture is then cooled to room temperature to<br>
induce phase separation. The organic liquid is then removed from the mixture to obtain<br>
a porous body. This method has the following advantages.<br>
(a)        A membrane can be easily produced using a polymer such as polyethylene for<br>
which an appropriate solvent which can dissolve the polymer at room temperature does<br>
not exist.<br>
(b)        Since the thermoplastic resin is dissolved at a high temperature and cooled to<br>
solidify and form a membrane. Therefore, particularly when the thermoplastic resin is a<br>
crystalline resin crystallization is promoted so that a high-strength membrane is easily<br>
obtained.<br>
Therefore, the thermally induced phase separation method is widely used as a<br>
porous membrane production method (see Non-patent Documents 1 to 4, for example).<br>

[0008]<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the inventors of the present invention<br>
conducted extensive studies aimed at a porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane which<br>
advantageously has both minute pores and high water permeability by the thermally<br>
induced phase separation method (Non-patent Documents 1 to 4) which is considered to<br>
be advantageous for obtaining a high-strength membrane and at stably production of the<br>
porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane. As a result, the inventors found that it is very<br>
important to discharge molten mixtures which differ in composition from adjacent<br>
4<br>
discharge ports and to incorporate an inorganic fine powder in the molten mixture<br>
discharged from at least one discharge port in order to stably spin (produce) a porous<br>
multilayer hollow fiber membrane and further improve the strength of the resulting<br>
porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane. The inventors also found that blocking<br>
performance, water permeability, and strength are effectively well-balanced using a<br>
porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane having at least two layers comprising an inner<br>
layer and an outer layer, the porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane being formed of a<br>
thermoplastic resin, at least one layer (A) of the above two layers having an isotropic<br>

layershaving a surface pore diameter less than half of the cross-sectional center pore<br>

[0013]<br>
The present invention is described in detail below.<br>
[0014]<br>
A thermoplastic resin exhibits elasticity, but not plasticity at room temperature.<br>
However, it exhibits plasticity when heated to an appropriate temperature to allow<br>
12<br>
molding. The thermoplastic resin again exhibits elasticity when cooled, and does not<br>
undergo a chemical change in molecular structure and the like during this process<br>
(Kagaku Daijiten (Comprehensive Chemical Dictionary), sixth edition (reduced size), pp.<br>
860 and 867 (Kyoritsu Shuppan Co., Ltd., 1963).<br>
[0015]<br>
Examples of the thermoplastic resin include thermoplastic resins described in<br>
"12695 Chemical Products", pp. 829 to 882 (The Chemical Daily Co., Ltd., 1995), resins<br>
described in Kagaku Binran, Ouyou Kagaku, pp. 809 and 810 (edited by The Chemical<br>
Society of Japan, Maruzen, 1980), and the like. Specific examples of the thermoplastic<br>
resin include polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride, an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, polyamide, polyetherimide, polystyrene,<br>
polysulfone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyphenylene ether, polyphenylene sulfide, cellulose<br>
acetate, polyacrylonitrile, and the like. In particular, a crystalline thermoplastic resin<br>
such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, an ethylene-vinyl alcohol<br>
copolymer, or polyvinyl alcohol may be suitably used from the viewpoint of strength. It<br>
is preferable to use a polyolefin, polyvinylidene fluoride, or the like which exhibits<br>
excellent water resistance due to hydrophobicity and is expected to exhibit durability<br>
when filtering a normal aqueous liquid. It is particularly preferable to use<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride due to excellent chemical durability (e.g., chemical resistance).<br>
Examples of polyvinylidene fluoride include a vinylidene fluoride homopolymer and a<br>
vinylidene fluoride copolymer having a vinylidene fluoride content of 50 mol% or more.<br>
Examples of the vinylidene fluoride copolymer include a copolymer of vinylidene<br>
fluoride and one or more monomers selected from tetrafluoroethylene,<br>
hexafluoropropylene, trifluoroethylene chloride, and ethylene. A vinylidene fluoride<br>
homopolymer is most preferable as polyvinylidene fluoride.<br>
[0016]<br>
As the organic liquid, a latent solvent for the thermoplastic resin used in the<br>
13<br>
present application is used. The term "latent solvent" used in the present application<br>
refers to a solvent which rarely dissolves the thermoplastic resin at room temperature<br>
(25°C), but dissolves the thermoplastic resin at a temperature higher than room<br>
temperature. It suffices that the organic liquid be liquid at the melt-mixing temperature<br>
of the thermoplastic resin. The organic liquid need not necessarily be liquid at room<br>
temperature.<br>
[0017]<br>
When the thermoplastic resin is polyethylene, examples of the organic liquid<br>
include phthalates such as dibutyl phthalate, diheptyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate,<br>
bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, diisodecyl phthalate, and ditridecyl phthalate; sebacates<br>
such as dibutyl sebacate; adipates such as dioctyl adipate; trimellitates such as trioctyl<br>
trimellitate; phosphates such as tributyl phosphate and trioctyl phosphate; glycerol esters<br>
such as propylene glycol dicaprate and propylene glycol dioleate; paraffins such as liquid<br>
paraffins; a mixture of these; and the like.<br>
[0018]<br>
When the thermoplastic resin is polyvinylidene fluoride, examples of the organic<br>
liquid include phthalates such as dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate,<br>
dicyclohexyl phthalate, diheptyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, and bis(2-ethylhexyl)<br>
phthalate; benzoates such as methyl benzoate and ethyl benzoate; phosphates such as<br>
triphenyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate, and tricresyl phosphate; ketones such as<br>
y-butyrolactone, ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, cyclohexanone, acetophenone,<br>
and isophorone; a mixture of these; and the like.<br>
[0019]<br>
Examples of the inorganic fine powder include silica, alumina, titanium oxide,<br>
zirconia, calcium carbonate, and the like. It is preferable to use a silica fine powder<br>
having an average primary particle diameter of 3 nm or more and 500 nm or less. The<br>
average primary particle diameter is more preferably 5 nm or more and 100 nm or less.<br>
14<br>
It is more preferable to use a hydrophobic silica fine powder which is hard to aggregate<br>
and exhibits excellent dispersibility. Hydrophobic silica having a methanol wettability<br>
(MW) value of 30 vol% or more is still more preferable. The term "MW value" used<br>
herein refers to the content (vol%) of methanol with which the powder is completely<br>
wetted. The MW value is determined as follows. Specifically, silica is placed in pure<br>
water, and methanol is then added to the mixture below the liquid surface with stirring.<br>
The content (vol%) of methanol in the aqueous solution when 50 mass% of silica has<br>
precipitated is determined to be the MW value.<br>
[0020]<br>
The inorganic fine powder is preferably added so that the content of the inorganic<br>
fine powder in the molten mixture is 5 mass% or more and 40 mass% or less. If the<br>
content of the inorganic fine powder is 5 mass% or more, an effect of mixing the<br>
inorganic fine powder can be sufficiently achieved. If the content of the inorganic fine<br>
powder is 40 mass% or less, a stable spinning operation can be ensured.<br>
[0021]<br>
The mixing ratio during melt-mixing is preferably determined so that the content<br>
of the thermoplastic resin is 15 to 50 vol% and the total content of the organic liquid and<br>
the inorganic fine powder is 50 to 85 vol% from the viewpoint of the balance between the<br>
water permeability and the strength of the resulting hollow fibers and stability of the<br>
spinning operation (i.e., melt-extrusion operation) (the mixing ratio is indicated by a<br>
value obtained by dividing mass by specific gravity). The content of the thermoplastic<br>
resin is preferably 15 vol% or more from the viewpoint of the strength of the resulting<br>
porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane and spinning stability. The content of the<br>
thermoplastic resin is preferably 50 vol% or less from the viewpoint of the water<br>
permeability of the resulting porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane and spinning<br>
stability.<br>
[0022]<br>
15<br>
The thermoplastic resin, the organic liquid, and the inorganic fine powder may be<br>
melt-mixed using a normal melt-mixing means such as a twin-screw extruder. A hollow<br>
fiber molding nozzle having two or more circular discharge ports disposed concentrically<br>
is attached to the end of the extruder. Molten mixtures are respectively supplied to and<br>
extruded from to the circular discharge ports from different extruders. Molten mixtures<br>
supplied from the different extruders are merged through the discharge ports to obtain a<br>
hollow fiber extruded product having a multilayer structure. In this case, a multilayer<br>
membrane in which the adjacent layers differ in pore size can be obtained by extruding<br>
molten mixtures which differ in composition from the adjacent circular discharge ports.<br>
The expression "differ in composition" refers to the case where the molten mixtures differ<br>
in constituent substance or the case where the molten mixtures contain the same<br>
constituent substances but differ in the ratio thereof. When the molten mixtures contain<br>
the same type of thermoplastic resins which differ in molecular weight or molecular<br>
weight distribution, the molten mixtures are considered to differ in constituent substance.<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 are schematic views showing a multilayer hollow fiber extruded product<br>
production process by multilayer melt-extrusion when the number of layers is two. The<br>
merging point of the molten mixtures which differ in composition may be the lower end<br>
face of the hollow fiber molding nozzle (FIG. 1) or a position differing from the lower end<br>
face of the hollow fiber molding nozzle (FIG. 2). It is preferable to use the nozzle shown<br>
in FIG. 2 which causes the molten mixtures to merge before passing through the lower<br>
end face of the nozzle (i.e., before being cooled and undergoing phase separation) from<br>
the viewpoint of inter-layer adhesion.<br>
[0023]<br>
When using the hollow fiber molding nozzle having two or more circular<br>
discharge ports disposed concentrically, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a molten mixture in<br>
which the thermoplastic resin, the organic liquid, and the inorganic fine powder are mixed<br>
can be extruded from at least one circular discharge port. As a result, a porous multilayer<br>
16<br>
hollow fiber membrane which exhibits blocking performance, water permeability, and<br>
strength in a well-balanced manner can be easily obtained.<br>
[0024]<br>
A porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane exhibiting excellent performance can<br>
be stably obtained by adding the inorganic fine powder due to the following three specific<br>
effects.<br>
(1)        The extrusion stability (spinning stability) of the hollow fiber extruded product<br>
having a multilayer structure is significantly improved. This is because the viscosity of<br>
the molten mixture increases to a large extent by adding the inorganic fine powder.<br>
Multilayer extrusion tends to become unstable as compared with single-layer extrusion.<br>
In the present invention, since at least one layer to be bonded has a high viscosity to form<br>
a hard layer, stability is achieved. Specifically, a multilayer hollow fiber extruded<br>
product in which non-uniformity at the layer interface is suppressed can be easily<br>
obtained while maintaining roundness. It is important for multilayer extrusion to<br>
suppress non-uniformity (e.g., waving) at the layer interface.<br>
(2)        Since the pore size distribution becomes sharp, a membrane which exhibits<br>
blocking performance, water permeability, and strength in a well-balanced manner can be<br>
obtained. Specifically, since the molten mixture has a high viscosity or the aggregate of<br>
the inorganic fine powder absorbs the organic liquid, a situation in which the organic<br>
liquid enters the adjacent layer is suppressed. When the organic liquid enters from the<br>
adjacent layer, the inorganic fine powder absorbs the organic liquid (i.e., functions as a<br>
buffer). The movement of the organic liquid is suppressed due to high viscosity, or a<br>
change in the membrane structure due to mixing of the organic liquids between the layers<br>
is reduced.<br>
(3)        When the inorganic fine powder is added to at least one layer, the mechanical<br>
strength and the chemical strength (chemical resistance) of the membrane tend to increase<br>
before or after extraction/removal of the organic liquid and the inorganic fine powder<br>
17<br>
(although the reason is not known).<br>
[0025]<br>
The above three effects are improved when the molten mixture which is<br>
discharged in the largest amount contains the inorganic fine powder. It is preferable that<br>
all of the molten mixtures to be discharged contain the inorganic fine powder. [0026]<br>
When the molten mixture containing the inorganic fine powder has such a<br>
composition that a value obtained by dividing a mass ratio.D of the organic liquid by a<br>
mass ratio S of the inorganic fine powder and further dividing the resulting value by a<br>
maximum mass M of the organic liquid absorbed by the inorganic fine powder per unit<br>
mass is 0.2 or more and 2 or less, the effect of suppressing the movement of the organic<br>
liquid between the molten mixtures can be further improved. The term "organic liquid"<br>
used herein refers to an organic liquid having the same composition as that of the organic<br>
liquid contained in the molten mixture, i.e., an organic liquid aomprising sole component<br>
or plural components at the same mixing ratio as that of the organic liquid contained in<br>
the molten mixture. If the above value is 0.2 or more, the movement of the organic<br>
liquid from the adjacent layer in the vicinity of the layer interface is suppressed so that a<br>
dense layer is not formed, whereby a high pure water permeation rate is maintained. If<br>
the above value is 2 or less, the amount of the organic liquid which is not absorbed by the<br>
inorganic fine powder is sufficiently small. Therefore, the movement of the organic<br>
liquid in the vicinity of the interface occurs to only a small extent. This reduces a change<br>
in the membrane structure, whereby blocking performance is maintained. The above<br>
value is more preferably 0.3 or more and 1.5 or less, and still more preferably 0.4 or more<br>
and 1.0 or less. This effect is also preferably improved when the molten mixture which<br>
is discharged in the largest amount contains the inorganic fine powder. It is more<br>
preferable that all of the molten mixtures to be discharged contain the inorganic fine<br>
powder. The term "maximum mass M of the organic liquid absorbed by the inorganic<br>
fine powder per unit mass" may be determined by adding the organic liquid dropwise to<br>
18<br>
the inorganic fine powder while mixing the inorganic fine powder, and dividing the mass<br>
of the organic liquid when the mixing torque has reached 70% of the maximum torque by<br>
the mass of the inorganic fine powder.<br>
[0027]<br>
It is preferable that at least one common organic liquid be mixed into the two<br>
adjacent molten mixtures, since an effect of a change in structure when the movement of<br>
the organic liquid occurs between the molten mixtures is reduced. It is more preferable<br>
that the same type of organic liquid be mixed into the adjacent molten mixtures in<br>
different ratios. When the same type of organic liquid is mixed into the adjacent molten<br>
mixtures, the extracted organic liquid can be easily recovered.<br>
[0028]<br>
The difference in resin temperature when causing the adjacent molten mixtures to<br>
merge is preferably 20°C or less. If the difference in resin temperature is 20°C or less,<br>
densification or void formation rarely occurs at the interface between the molten mixtures.<br>
As a result, a membrane exhibiting excellent water permeability and strength can be<br>
obtained. The difference in resin temperature when causing the adjacent molten<br>
mixtures to merge is more preferably 10°C or less, and still more preferably 0°C.<br>
[0029]<br>
When extruding the molten mixture from the circular discharge port, it is<br>
preferable to discharge the molten mixture so that a spinning nozzle discharge parameter<br>
R (I/second) is 10 or more and 1000 or less, since a membrane having high strength can<br>
be obtained while achieving high productivity and high spinning stability. The term<br>
"spinning nozzle discharge parameter R" refers to a value obtained by dividing a<br>
discharge linear velocity V (m/sec) by a slit width d (m) of the discharge port. The term<br>
"discharge linear velocity V (m/sec)" refers to a value obtained by dividing the amount<br>
(m3/second) of the molten mixture discharged per unit time by the cross-sectional area<br>
(m2) of the discharge port. If the spinning nozzle discharge parameter R is 10 or more, a<br>
19<br>
problem such as a change (pulsation) in the diameter of the hollow extruded product does<br>
not occur so that the spinning operation can be stably performed with high productivity.<br>
If the spinning nozzle discharge parameter R is 1000 or less, the elongation at break<br>
(important strength) of the resulting porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane can be<br>
maintained at a sufficiently high level. The term "elongation at break" refers to the<br>
elongation with respect to the original length when pulling the membrane in the<br>
longitudinal direction. When the molten mixtures merge before being discharged (see<br>
spinning nozzle shown in FIG. 2), a value obtained by dividing the discharge linear<br>
velocity V of the merged molten mixtures at a lower end face 9 shown in FIG. 2 by the slit<br>
width d of the discharge port is employed as the spinning nozzle discharge parameter R.<br>
When the molten mixtures merge when or after being discharged (see spinning nozzle<br>
shown in FIG. 1), the spinning nozzle discharge parameters R1 and R2 are respectively<br>
calculated for the slit widths d1 and d2 of the circular discharge ports 11 and 12 at the<br>
lower end face 9 shown in FIG. 1. In this case, it is preferable that at least one spinning<br>
nozzle discharge parameter R be 10 or more and 1000 or less. It is more preferable that<br>
the spinning nozzle discharge parameter R of which the amount of discharge is largest be<br>
10 or more and 1000 or less. It is still more preferable that the spinning nozzle discharge<br>
parameters R of all of the circular discharge ports be 10 or more and 1000 or less. The<br>
spinning nozzle discharge parameter R is more preferably 50 or more and 800 or less, and<br>
still more preferably 100 or more and 500 or less.<br>
.[0030]<br>
The number of layers and the ratio of the pore size or the thickness of the layers<br>
may be appropriately set depending on the objective. For example, when forming a<br>
two-layer filter membrane, (i) a combination of a thin outer layer having a small pore<br>
diameter and a thick inner layer having a large pore diameter, or (ii) a combination of a<br>
thick outer layer having a large pore diameter and a thin inner layer having a small pore<br>
diameter is effective for providing minute pores and high water permeability. When<br>
20<br>
forming a three-layer filter membrane, (iii) a combination of a thin outer layer having a<br>
small pore diameter, a thin inner layer having a small pore diameterD, and a thick<br>
intermediate layer having a large pore diameter, or (iv) a combination of a thick outer<br>
layer having a large pore diameter, a thick inner layer having a large pore diameter, and a<br>
thin intermediate layer having a small pore diameter is effective for providing minute<br>
pores and high water permeability.<br>
[0031]<br>
The hollow fiber molten mixtures extruded from the discharge ports to have a<br>
multilayer structure are cooled and solidified through the air or a refrigerant such as water,<br>
and are wound around a reel, as required. Thermally induced phase separation occurs<br>
during cooling. Polymer rich-phases and organic liquid rich-phases are minutely<br>
distributed in the hollow fiber after cooling and solidification. When the inorganic fine<br>
powder is a silica fine powder, the silica fine powder is unevenly distributed in the<br>
organic liquid rich phase. The organic liquid rich-phases form pores by removing the<br>
organic liquid and the inorganic fine powder by extraction from the hollow fiber which<br>
has been cooled and solidified. A porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane can be thus<br>
obtained.<br>
[0032]<br>
The organic liquid and the inorganic fine powder may be removed by extraction at<br>
the same time when the organic liquid and the inorganic fine powder can be extracted<br>
with the same solvent. The organic liquid and the inorganic fine powder are normally<br>
removed separately.<br>
[0033]<br>
The organic liquid is removed by extraction using a liquid appropriate for<br>
extraction which does not dissolve or modify the thermoplastic resin used, but which is<br>
mixed with the organic liquid. Specifically, the organic liquid may be extracted by<br>
contact such as immersion. It is preferable that the liquid used for extraction be volatile<br>
21<br>
so that the liquid can be easily removed from the hollow fiber membrane after extraction.<br>
Examples of such a liquid include an alcohol, methylene chloride, and the like. When<br>
the organic liquid is water-soluble, water may be used as the extraction liquid.<br>
[0034]<br>
The inorganic fine powder is normally removed by extraction using an aqueous<br>
liquid. For example, when the inorganic fine powder is silica, silica may be converted<br>
into a silicate through contact with an alkaline solution, and the silicate is then removed<br>
by extraction through contact with water.<br>
[0035]<br>
The organic liquid and the inorganic fine powder may be removed by extraction in<br>
an arbitrary order. When the organic liquid is immiscible with water, it is preferable to<br>
remove the organic liquid by extraction, and then remove the inorganic fine powder by<br>
extraction. Since the organic liquid and the inorganic fine powder are normally present<br>
in the organic liquid rich-phase in a mixed state, the inorganic fine powder can be<br>
smoothly removed by extraction.<br>
[0036]<br>
A porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane can be obtained by removing the<br>
organic liquid and the inorganic fine powder by extraction from the multilayer hollow<br>
fiber which has been cooled and solidified.<br>
[0037]<br>
The multilayer hollow fiber which has been cooled and solidified may be<br>
stretched in the longitudinal direction at a stretch ratio of 3 or less (i) before removing the<br>
organic liquid and the inorganic fine powder by extraction, (ii) after removing the organic<br>
liquid by extraction, but before removing the inorganic fine powder by extraction, (iii)<br>
after removing the inorganic fine powder by extraction, but before removing the organic<br>
liquid by extraction, or (i) after removing the organic liquid and the inorganic fine powder<br>
by extraction. The water permeability of the multilayer hollow fiber membrane is<br>
22<br>
generally improved by stretching the multilayer hollow fiber membrane in the<br>
longitudinal direction. On the other hand, since the pressure withstand performance<br>
(bursting strength and compressive strength) decreases, the stretched membrane may not<br>
have a practical strength. However, the porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane<br>
obtained by the production process according to the present invention has a high<br>
mechanical strength. Therefore, the multilayer hollow fiber may be stretched at a stretch<br>
ratio of 1.1 or more and 3 or less. The water permeability of the porous multilayer<br>
hollow fiber membrane is improved by stretching the porous multilayer hollow fiber<br>
membrane. The term "stretch ratio" used herein refers to a value obtained by dividing<br>
the length of the hollow fiber after stretching by the length of the hollow fiber before<br>
stretching. For example, when stretching a multilayer hollow fiber having a length of 10<br>
cm to a length of 20 cm, the stretch ratio is two according to the following expression.<br>
20 cm/10 cm = 2<br>
The compressive strength of the membrane may be optionally increased by<br>
subjecting the stretched membrane to a heat treatment. The heat treatment temperature<br>
is normally equal to or less than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin.<br>
[0038]<br>
The porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane according to the present invention<br>
which exhibits blocking performance, water permeability, and strength in a well-balanced<br>
manner is a multilayer membrane which includes at least two layers and is formed of the<br>
thermoplastic resin.<br>
[0039]<br>
The porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane according to the present invention<br>
is described below with reference to a schematic view showing a porous two-layer hollow<br>
fiber membrane (see FIG. 5).<br>
23<br>
[0040]<br>
A layer having a larger pore diameter is referred to as a layer (A), and a layer<br>
having a smaller pore diameter is referred to as a layer (B). The layer (A) is referred to<br>
as an inner layer, and the layer (B) is referred to as an outer layer. Note that the present<br>
invention is not limited thereto. For example, another layer may be provided between<br>
the layer (A) and the layer (B), or another layer may be stacked on the layer (A) or the<br>
layer (B).<br>
[0041]<br>
FIG. 5(1) is a view showing a change in pore diameter in the thickness direction<br>
when the layer (A) and the layer (B) have an isotropic three-dimensional mesh structure.<br>
FIG. 5(2) is a view showing a change in pore diameter when the layer (B) has an<br>
anisotropic three-dimensional mesh structure. FIG. 5(3) is a view showing a change in<br>
pore diameter when a layer (skin layer) having a small pore diameter is formed on the<br>
outer surface in FIG. 5(1). FIGS. 5(1) to 5(3) give graphs showing the relationship<br>
between the thickness and the pore diameter along the cross section of each hollow fiber<br>
membrane. In each graph, the vertical axis indicates the ratio of the pore diameter at<br>
each cross-section to the cross-sectional center pore diameter, and the horizontal axis<br>
indicates the distance from the outer surface to a position in the thickness direction<br>
provided that the total thickness is one. It is preferable that the layer (A) and the layer<br>
(B) have an isotropic three-dimensional mesh structures since the blocking performance<br>
changes to only a small extent even if surface wear occurs.<br>
[0042]<br>
The layer (A) is a support layer. The support layer ensures a high mechanical<br>
strength such as pressure withstand performance, and maintains water permeability as<br>
high as possible.<br>
[0043]<br>
The layer (A) has an isotropic three-dimensional mesh structure. The term<br>
24<br>
"isotropic" used herein means that a change in pore diameter is small (i.e., almost<br>
homogeneous structure) in the thickness direction, the circumferential direction, and the<br>
longitudinal direction of the membrane. The isotropic structure is a structure in which a<br>
portion having a low strength such as a macro-void rarely occurs. Therefore, the<br>
mechanical strength (e.g., pressure withstand performance) of the porous multilayer<br>
hollow fiber membrane can be increased while maintaining the water permeability of the<br>
porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane.<br>
[0044]<br>
The term "three-dimensional mesh structure" used herein refers to a structure<br>
schematically shown in FIG. 3. As shown in FIG. 3, thermoplastic resins a are connected<br>
to form a mesh so that openings b are formed. FIG. 9 shows an example of a microscope<br>
image of the isotropic three-dimensional mesh structure of a porous two-layer hollow<br>
fiber membrane obtained in Example 1. The thickness of the thermoplastic resin which<br>
forms the mesh is almost constant. In this three-dimensional mesh structure, a resin<br>
block having a spherulite structure schematically shown in FIG. 4 is rarely observed.<br>
The opening of the three-dimensional mesh structure is enclosed by the thermoplastic<br>
resin, and each section of the opening communicates. Since most of the thermoplastic<br>
resin used forms a three-dimensional mesh structure which can contribute to the strength<br>
of the hollow fiber membrane, a support layer having a high strength can be formed.<br>
Moreover, chemical resistance increases. The reason that chemical resistance increases<br>
is not clear, but is considered to be as follows. Specifically, since a large amount of<br>
thermoplastic resin forms a mesh which can contribute to strength, the strength of the<br>
entire layer is not affected even if part of the mesh is affected by chemicals. In the<br>
spherulite structure schematically shown in FIG. 4, since the resin gathers in blocks, the<br>
amount of thermoplastic resin which contributes to strength is relatively small.<br>
Therefore, it is considered that the strength of the entire layer is easily affected when part<br>
of the mesh is affected by chemicals. FIG. 4 is a schematic view showing a spherulite<br>
25<br>
structure as a reference. In FIG. 4, spherulites c are partially positioned densely. An<br>
opening d is formed between the spherulites c. FIG. 23 shows an example of a microscope<br>
image of a spherulite structure obtained in Reference Example 1 described later.<br>
[0045]<br>
The surface pore diameter of the layer (A) is 0.6 times to 1.4 times the<br>
cross-sectional center pore diameter. The fact that the surface pore diameter of the layer<br>
(A) is 0.6 times to 1.4 times the cross-sectional center pore diameter is consistent with the<br>
fact that the layer (A) has an isotropic three-dimensional mesh structure. If the surface<br>
pore diameter of the layer (A) is 0.6 times the cross-sectional center pore diameter or<br>
more, filtration resistance at the surface of the support layer does not increase to a large<br>
extent, so that the entire membrane exhibits a high water permeability sufficient for<br>
practical use. If the surface pore diameter of the layer (A) is 1.4 times the cross-sectional<br>
center pore diameter or less, high mechanical strength can be achieved.<br>
[0046]<br>
A hollow fiber membrane must exhibit strength that endures a filtration pressure<br>
differing from a flat membrane which is generally placed on a support such as a<br>
mesh-shaped metal or a plastic. Therefore, a membrane structural design which can<br>
provide strength in the filtration direction (i.e., bursting strength and compressive<br>
strength) is important. It is possible to achieve low filtration resistance and high<br>
compressive strength in combination by suppressing an increase in pore diameter from<br>
the vicinity of the center of the cross section to the inner surface of the hollow fiber.<br>
Blocking performance, water permeability, and mechanical strength can be achieved in a<br>
well-balanced manner by thus controlling the pore diameter of the membrane in the<br>
cross-sectional direction. The surface pore diameter of the layer (A) is preferably 0.7<br>
times to 1.3 times, and more preferably 0.8 times to 1.2 times the cross-sectional center<br>
pore diameter.<br>
[0047]<br>
26<br>
The term "surface pore diameter of the layer (A)" used herein refers to the average<br>
pore diameter of the pores observed in the exposed surface of the layer (A) from the<br>
outside. The average pore diameter is measured as follows. The exposed surface of the<br>
layer (A) of the porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane is photographed using a<br>
scanning electron microscope at a magnification at which the shape of a large number of<br>
pores can be clearly checked as much as possible. Five lines are drawn on the<br>
photograph perpendicularly to each of the horizontal direction and the vertical direction<br>
at almost equal intervals, and the length of the line which crosses the pore on the<br>
photograph is measured. The arithmetic mean value of the measured values is calculated<br>
and taken as the average pore diameter. In order to increase the pore diameter<br>
measurement accuracy, it is preferable that the number of pores over which the ten lines<br>
drawn in horizontal and vertical directions in total pass be 20 or more. When the pore<br>
diameter is about 0.1 to 1 µm, an electron microscope image at a magnification of about<br>
5000 is suitably used.<br>
[0048]<br>
The term "cross-sectional center pore diameter" used herein refers to a value<br>
obtained by photographing the cross section of the porous multilayer hollow fiber<br>
membrane when cut perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction within the range of 10%<br>
of the total thickness from the center position of the thickness using a scanning electron<br>
microscope at an arbitrary magnification, and calculating the arithmetic mean value of the<br>
pore diameter using the resulting photograph in the same manner as the average pore<br>
diameter. The cross-sectional center pore diameter is preferably 0.1 µm or more and 10<br>
µm or less. Water permeability and mechanical strength can be well-balanced when the<br>
cross-sectional center pore diameter is within this range. The cross-sectional center pore<br>
diameter is more preferably 0.3 µm or more and 8 µm or less, still more preferably 0.6 µm<br>
or more and 6 µm or less, and still more preferably 0.8 µm or more and 4 µm or less.<br>
[0049]<br>
27<br>
The porosity of the surface of the layer (B) may be appropriately determined<br>
depending on the objective without specific limitations. The porosity of the surface of<br>
the layer (B) is preferably 20% or more, more preferably 23% or more, and still more<br>
preferably 25% or more from viewpoint of filtration stability of a treatment target liquid<br>
containing a suspended substance or the like. The porosity is preferably 80% or less<br>
from the viewpoint of increasing the mechanical strength of the surface portion. The<br>
porosity is more preferably 60% or less, and still more preferably 50% or less. The<br>
porosity may be determined by placing a transparent sheet on a copy of an electron<br>
microscope image, painting out the pores using a black pen or the like, copying the<br>
transparent sheet onto white paper to clearly distinguish the pores (black) from the<br>
non-pore area (white), and calculating the porosity using commercially available image<br>
analysis software, as disclosed in WO 01/53213 A1, for example.<br>
[0050]<br>
The layer (B) is a blocking layer. The blocking layer prevents a foreign matter<br>
contained in a treatment target liquid from passing through the membrane due to the small<br>
surface pore diameter. The term "surface pore diameter of the layer (B)" used herein<br>
refers to the average pore diameter of the pores observed in the exposed surface of the<br>
layer (B) from the outside. The surface pore diameter of the layer (B) may be measured<br>
using a scanning electron microscope image in the same manner as in the case of<br>
measuring the surface pore diameter of the layer (A). The surface pore diameter of the<br>
layer (B) is preferably 0.01 urn or more and less than 5 µm. If the surface pore diameter<br>
of the layer (B) is 0.01 µm or more, the filtration resistance of the dense surface is low,<br>
whereby water permeability sufficient for practical use is easily obtained. If the surface<br>
pore diameter of the layer (B) is 5 µm or less, cleaning performance important for the<br>
filter membrane can be achieved. The surface pore diameter of the layer (B) is more<br>
preferably 0.05 µm or more and 2 µm or more, still more preferably 0.05 µm or more and<br>
0.5 µm or less, and most preferably 0.1 µm or more and 0.5 µm or less.<br>
28<br>
[0051]<br>
The surface pore diameter of the layer (B) is less than half of the cross-sectional<br>
center pore diameter. This allows the layer (B) to function as a desired blocking layer.<br>
The lower limit of the surface pore diameter may be appropriately selected depending on<br>
the size of the target to be blocked. It is preferable that the surface pore diameter of the<br>
layer (B) be 1/1000 or more of the cross-sectional center pore diameter from the<br>
viewpoint of ensuring water permeability. The surface pore diameter of the layer (B) is<br>
more preferably 1/3 or less and 1/500 or more, and still more preferably 1/4 or less and<br>
1/100 or more of the cross-sectional center pore diameter.<br>
[0052]<br>
It is preferable that the thickness of the layer (B) be 1/100 or more and less than<br>
40/100 of the thickness of the membrane. Even if insoluble matters such as sand and<br>
aggregates are contained in a treatment target liquid, the membrane can.be used by<br>
relatively increasing the thickness of the layer (B) in this manner as described above.<br>
Specifically, the surface pore diameter does not change even if the layer (B) is worn to<br>
some extent. Desirable blocking performance and high water permeability can be<br>
well-balanced when the thickness of the layer (B) is within this range. The thickness of<br>
the layer (B) is more preferably 3/100 or more and 20/100 or less, and still more<br>
preferably 5/100 or more and 15/100 or less of the thickness of the membrane.<br>
[0053]<br>
The layer (B) may have an anisotropic structure in which the diameter of each<br>
pore gradually increases from the surface toward the inside of the membrane, differing<br>
from the layer (A). Alternatively, the layer (B) may have an isotropic structure in which<br>
the diameter of each pore is constant irrespective of the distance from the surface in the<br>
same manner as in the layer (A). The layer (B) preferably has an isotropic<br>
three-dimensional mesh structure similar to that of the layer (A). This enables the<br>
mechanical strength of the entire hollow fiber membrane to be improved while<br>
29<br>
maintaining a desirable blocking performance.<br>
[0054]<br>
The thicknesses of the layer (A) and the layer (B) are determined as follows.<br>
Specifically, the cross-sectional pore diameter of each portion in the thickness direction is<br>
determined by a method described in (7) in the examples. A point at which the pore<br>
diameter is the closest to a value 0.7 times the cross-sectional center pore diameter from<br>
the center of the cross section toward the surface of the layer (B) is determined to lie on a<br>
boundary line between the layers. The distance between the boundary line and the<br>
surface of the layer (A) is taken as the thickness of the layer (A), and the distance between<br>
the boundary line and the surface of the layer (B) is taken as the thickness of the layer (B).<br>
When the pore diameter becomes the closest to a value 0.7 times the cross-sectional<br>
center pore diameter at a plurality of points, the distance between the surface of the layer<br>
(A) and the point closest to the center of the cross section is considered to be the layer (A).<br>
[0055]<br>
The degree of isotropy of the layer (A) is preferably 80% or more. This means<br>
that the layer (A) has an extremely isotropic structure. If the degree of isotropy is 80%<br>
or more, high strength can be achieved while maintaining high water permeability. The<br>
degree of isotropy of the layer (A) is more preferably 90% or more, and still more<br>
preferably 95% or more.<br>
[0056]<br>
The term "degree of isotropy of the layer (A)" refers to a value (ratio) obtained by<br>
dividing the number of portions having a cross-sectional pore diameter 0.8 times to 1.2<br>
times the cross-sectional center pore diameter by the total number of portions included in<br>
the layer (A) measured as described above.<br>
[0057]<br>
The degree of isotropy of the layer (B) is preferably 80% or more. This means<br>
that the layer (B) has an extremely isotropic structure. If the degree of isotropy of the<br>
30<br>
layer (B) is 80% or more, the layer (B) exhibits high blocking performance. Moreover, a<br>
decrease in blocking performance can be suppressed even when the surface of the layer<br>
(B) is worn out due to insoluble matters (e.g., sand or aggregates) contained in a treatment<br>
target liquid. The term "degree of isotropy of the layer (B)" refers to a value (ratio)<br>
obtained by, provided that the cross-sectional pore diameter at a position half the<br>
thickness of the layer (B) is referred to as a cross-sectional center pore diameter (B),<br>
dividing the number of portions having a cross-sectional pore diameter 0.8 times to 1.2<br>
times the cross-sectional center pore diameter (B) by the total number of portions<br>
included in the layer (B) measured as described above. The degree of isotropy of the<br>
layer (B) is more preferably 90% or more, and still more preferably 95% or more. When<br>
the thickness of the layer (B) is very small as compared with the total thickness of the<br>
membrane, the above measurement is conducted while increasing the number of<br>
measurement points of the cross-sectional pore diameter of the layer (B). It is<br>
appropriate to measure the cross-sectional pore diameter at 20 points or more.<br>
[0058]<br>
It is most preferable that the degrees of isotropy of the layer (A) and the layer (B)<br>
be 80% or more. If the degrees of isotropy of the both layers are 80% or more, since<br>
the membrane structure is efficiently formed by the blocking layer and the strength<br>
support layer, a membrane exhibiting blocking performance, water permeability, and<br>
strength in a well-balanced manner can be obtained. The degrees of isotropy of the both<br>
layers are more preferably 90% or more, and still more preferably 95% or more.<br>
[0059]<br>
The term "isotropy" used herein may be expressed by a parameter Q described<br>
below.<br>
[0060]<br>
The term "parameter Q" refers to a value which indicates the pore diameter<br>
change rate at each position from the outer surface to the inner surface in the thickness<br>
31<br>
direction. The parameter Q is calculated as follows.<br>
[0061]<br>
The cross-sectional pore diameters at each position in the thickness direction are<br>
arranged in order from the outer surface to the inner surface.<br>
The outer surface pore diameter is referred to as Do, the cross-sectional pore<br>
diameters are referred to as D1, D2, and Dn in order from the outer surface, and the inner<br>
surface pore diameter is referred to as Dj.<br>
[0062]<br>
The parameter Q is given by the following general expression.<br>
Q=(Dn-Dn-1)/Dn<br>
The parameter Q for the outer surface pore diameter is calculated as follows.<br>
Q=(D1-D0)/D1<br>
The parameter Q for the inner surface pore diameter is calculated as follows.<br>
Q=(D1-Dn)/Di<br>
[0063]<br>
In the porous multilayer hollow fiber membrane according to the present<br>
invention, it is preferable that the number of parameters Q which satisfy -0.2=Q=0.2 be<br>
80% or more of the total number of parameters Q measured. The number of parameters<br>
Q which satisfy -0.2=Q=0.2 is more preferably 85% or more, and still more preferably<br>
90% or more of the total number of parameters Q measured. Since most of the<br>
membrane has a uniform pore diameter when the number of parameters Q which satisfy<br>
32<br>
-0.2=Q=0.2 is within the above range, a membrane exhibiting blocking performance,<br>
water permeability, and strength in a well-balanced manner can be obtained.<br>
[0064]<br>
It is preferable that the number of parameters Q which satisfy -0. 1=Q=0.1 be 50%<br>
or more of the total number of parameters Q measured. The number of parameters Q<br>
which satisfy -0. 1=Q=0.1 is more preferably 60% or more, and still more preferably 70%<br>
or more of the total number of parameters Q measured.<br>
[0065]<br>
A portion for which the parameters Q is smaller than -0.2 or larger than 0.2 shows<br>
a large change in pore diameter depending on the position in the thickness direction.<br>
[0066]<br>
The outer surface pore diameter and the inner surface pore diameter are measured<br>
by the above-described method. The cross-sectional pore diameter is measured by the<br>
measuring method described in (7) in the examples.<br>
[0067]<br>
The layer (A) or the layer (B) may be positioned on the outer side of the hollow<br>
fiber membrane depending on the objective. When using the hollow fiber membrane for<br>
service water filtration, it is preferable to dispose the blocking layer on the outer side of<br>
the hollow fiber membrane from the viewpoint of long-term stable operation.<br>
[0068]<br>
The inner diameter of the hollow fiber membrane is preferably 0.4 mm or more<br>
and 5 mm or less. If the inner diameter of the hollow fiber membrane is 0.4 mm or more,<br>
the pressure loss of a liquid which flows through the hollow fiber membrane does not<br>
increase to a large extent. If the inner diameter of the hollow fiber membrane is 5 mm or<br>
less, sufficient compressive strength and bursting strength are easily achieved by a hollow<br>
fiber membrane having a relatively small thickness. The inner diameter of the hollow<br>
fiber membrane is more preferably 0.5 mm or more and 3 mm or less, and still more<br>
33<br>
preferably 0.6 mm or more and 1 mm or less.<br>
The thickness of the hollow fiber membrane is preferably 0.1 mm or more and 1<br>
mm or less. If the thickness of the hollow fiber membrane is 0.1 mm or more, sufficient<br>
compressive strength and bursting strength are easily achieved. If the thickness of the<br>
hollow fiber membrane is 1 mm or less, sufficient water permeability is easily achieved.<br>
The thickness of the hollow fiber membrane is more preferably 0.15 mm or more and 0.8<br>
mm or less, and still more preferably 0.2 mm or more and 0.6 mm or less.<br>
[0069]<br>
A hollow fiber membrane having such a preferable structure exhibits blocking<br>
performance, water permeability, and mechanical strength in a well-balanced manner,<br>
and exhibits a high performance under a wide range of operating conditions. Moreover,<br>
the hollow fiber membrane does not change relating to the blocking performance (i.e., it<br>
exhibits high abrasion resistance) even if insoluble matters such as sand or aggregates are<br>
contained in a treatment target liquid.<br>
[0070]<br>
A membrane having a uniform latex sphere (0.2 (xm) blocking rate of 95% or<br>
more, a pure water permeability of 5000 1/m2/hr/0.1 MPa or more, and a compressive<br>
strength of 0.3 MPa or more is particularly preferable for the objective of the present<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0071]<br>
The present invention is described in detail below by way of examples. Property<br>
measurement methods are as follows. The measurement was conducted at 25°C unless<br>
otherwise indicated.<br>
(1) Fiber diameter (mm) and aspect ratio<br>
The hollow fiber membrane was cut to a small thickness using a razor or the like<br>
34<br>
perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the membrane. The cross section of the<br>
membrane was observed using a microscope. The major axis diameter and the minor<br>
axis diameter of the inner diameter and the major axis diameter and the minor axis<br>
diameter of the outer diameter of the hollow fiber were measured, and the inner diameter<br>
and the outer diameter were determined according to the following expressions.<br>
[0072]<br>
Inner diameter (mm) = (inner major axis diameter (mm) + inner minor axis diameter<br>
(mm)) / 2<br>
[0073]<br>
Outer diameter (mm) = (outer major axis diameter (mm) + outer minor axis diameter<br>
(mm)) / 2<br>
[0074]<br>
The aspect ratio was determined by dividing the major axis of the inner diameter<br>
by the minor axis of the inner diameter.<br>
(2) Pure water permeation rate (L/m2/hr/0.1 MPa)<br>
The hollow fiber membrane was immersed in a 50 mass% ethanol aqueous<br>
solution for 30 minutes, and then immersed in water for 30 minutes to wet the hollow<br>
fiber membrane. One end of the wet hollow fiber membrane having a length of 10 cm<br>
was sealed, and a syringe needle was inserted into the other end. Pure water was injected<br>
into the hollow portion through the syringe needle at a pressure of 0.1 MPa. The amount<br>
of pure water which passed through the membrane was measured. The pure water<br>
permeation rate was determined by the following expression.<br>
[0075]<br>
Pure water permeation rate (1/m2/hr) = (60 (min/hr) x amount of water permeated (1)) / (p<br>
x inner diameter (m) x effective length (m) x measurement time (min))<br>
[0076]<br>
The effective membrane length used herein refers to the net membrane length<br>
35<br>
excluding a portion in which the syringe needle is inserted.<br>
[0077]<br>
(3)        Breaking strength (MPa) and elongation at break (%)<br>
Load and displacement upon tension and breakage were measured under the<br>
following conditions.<br>
Sample: wet hollow fiber membrane produced by the method (2) .<br>
Measuring instrument: Instron tensile tester (AGS-5D manufactured by Shimadzu<br>
Corporation), chuck distance: 5 cm<br>
Tensile rate: 20 cm/minute<br>
The breaking strength and the elongation at break were determined by the<br>
following expressions.<br>
[0078]<br>
Breaking strength (kgf/cm2) = load at break (kgf) / cross-sectional area (cm2)<br>
[0079]<br>
Elongation at break (%) = (displacement at break (cm) / 5 (cm)) x 100<br>
[0080]<br>
The cross-sectional area of the membrane is determined by the following<br>
expression.<br>
[0081]<br>
Cross-sectional area (cm2) = p x ((outer diameter (cm) / 2)2 - ((inner diameter (cm) / 2)2)<br>
[0082]<br>
(4)        Latex blocking rate (%)<br>
A monodisperse latex having a particle diameter of 0.208 µm (STADEX<br>
manufactured by JSR Corporation, solid content: 1 mass%) was diluted with a 0.5 mass%<br>
sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) aqueous solution to prepare a suspension with a latex<br>
concentration of 0.01 mass%. 100 ml of the latex suspension was placed in a beaker, and<br>
supplied to a wet hollow fiber membrane having an effective length of about 12 cm from<br>
36<br>
the outer surface using a tube pump at a pressure of 0.03 MPa at a linear velocity of 0.1<br>
m/sec so that the liquid which permeated the membrane was let off from the ends (open to<br>
the atmosphere) of the hollow fiber membrane to filter the latex suspension. The filtered<br>
liquid was returned to the beaker, and filtered with a liquid in a closed system. After 10<br>
minutes of filtration, the liquid which permeated the membrane from the ends of the<br>
hollow fiber membrane and the liquid supplied from the beaker were sampled, and<br>
measured for an absorbance at 600 nm using an absorbance detector. The latex blocking<br>
rate was determined by the following expression.<br>
[0083]<br>
Latex blocking rate (%) = (1 - (absorbance of liquid permeated / absorbance of liquid<br>
supplied)) x 100<br>
[0084]<br>
(5) Compressive strength (MPa)<br>
One end of a wet hollow fiber membrane having a length of about 5 cm was sealed<br>
with the other end open to the atmosphere. Pure water at 40°C was caused to permeate<br>
the hollow fiber membrane from the outer surface under pressure, and water which<br>
permeated the membrane was removed from the open end. In this case, the total amount<br>
of water supplied to the membrane was filtered, without circulation (i.e., total amount<br>
filtration method). The pressure was increased from 0.1 MPa stepwise by 0.01 MPa.<br>
The pressure was maintained for 15 seconds, and water removed from the open end<br>
within 15 seconds was sampled. When the hollow portion of the hollow fiber membrane<br>
is not crushed, the absolute value of the amount (mass) of water which permeates the<br>
membrane increases as the pressure increases. When the pressure exceeds the<br>
compressive strength of the hollow fiber membrane, the hollow portion of the hollow<br>
fiber membrane is crushed so that clogging occurs. As a result, the absolute value of the<br>
amount of water which permeates the membrane decreases even if the pressure increases.<br>
Therefore, the pressure at which the absolute value of the amount of water which<br>
37<br>
permeated the membrane becomes a maximum was taken as the compressive strength of<br>
the hollow fiber membrane.<br>
(6)        Inner surface pore diameter, outer surface pore diameter, and pore diameter at the<br>
center of cross section (µm)<br>
The inner surface pore diameter, the outer surface pore diameter, and the<br>
cross-sectional center pore diameter of the porous hollow fiber membrane were measured<br>
using a scanning electron micrograph in which the shape of 20 or more pores could be<br>
verified. Five lines were drawn on the photograph (A4) perpendicularly to each of the<br>
horizontal direction and the vertical direction at almost equal intervals so that the<br>
photograph was divided into six sections in the horizontal direction and the vertical<br>
direction. The length of the line crossing the pore on the photograph was measured.<br>
The arithmetic mean length was calculated to determine the inner surface pore diameter,<br>
the outer surface pore diameter, and the cross-sectional center pore diameter of the porous<br>
hollow fiber membrane. When the pore diameter is about 0.1 to 1 µm, an electron<br>
microscope image at a magnification of about 5000 is suitably used. The cross-sectional<br>
center pore diameter was measured in the range of 10% of the total thickness around the<br>
center in the thickness direction.<br>
(7)        Cross-sectional pore diameter in each portion in the thickness direction and<br>
thicknesses of layer (A) and layer (B)<br>
The cross section of the hollow fiber membrane was photographed using a<br>
scanning electron microscope. A photograph in which the shape of 20 or more pores<br>
could be verified was used. One hundred lines of which the distance from the outer<br>
surface was equal (i.e., lines connecting points at an equal thickness) were drawn on an<br>
A4 photograph so that the total thickness was divided into 101 sections. The length of<br>
the line crossing the pore on the photograph was measured. The arithmetic mean length<br>
was calculated to determine the cross-sectional pore diameter in each portion in the<br>
thickness direction. When the scanning electron micrograph is taken at a sufficiently<br>
38<br>
high magnification, a line whereof the points lie at an equal distance from the outer<br>
surface may be approximated by a straight line. A point at which the pore diameter was<br>
closest to a value 0.7 times the cross-sectional center pore diameter from the center of the<br>
cross section toward the surface of the layer (B) was determined to lie on a boundary line<br>
between the layers. The distance between the boundary line and the surface of the layer<br>
(A) was taken as the thickness of the layer (A), and the distance between the boundary<br>
line and the surface of the layer (B) was taken as the thickness of the layer (B). When the<br>
pore diameter is about 0.1 to 1 µm, an electron microscope image at a magnification of<br>
about 5000 is suitably used. In the present invention, the total thickness was divided into<br>
14 sections. Specifically, the above measurement was conducted using fourteen electron<br>
micrographs (magnification: 5000) of the cross section of the hollow fiber membrane.<br>
When the electron micrograph was taken at a sufficiently high magnification, a line<br>
whereof the points lie at an equal distance from the outer surface was approximated by a<br>
straight line.<br>
(8)        Degree of isotropy (%) of layer (A)<br>
A value (ratio) obtained by dividing the number of portions having a<br>
cross-sectional pore diameter 0.8 times to 1.2 times the cross-sectional center pore<br>
diameter in the layer (A) by the total number of portions included in the layer (A)<br>
measured in (7) was taken as the degree of isotropy of the layer (A).<br>
(9)        Degree of isotropy (%) of layer (B)<br>
Lines were drawn concentrically with circles indicated by the cross section of the<br>
hollow fiber at intervals at which the thickness of the layer (B) measured in (7) was<br>
equally divided into 20 sections. The length of the line crossing the pore on the<br>
photograph was measured. The arithmetic mean length was calculated to determine the<br>
cross-sectional pore diameter in each portion of the layer (B) in the thickness direction.<br>
[0085]<br>
The cross-sectional pore diameter at a position half the thickness of the layer (B)<br>
39<br>
is referred to as the cross-sectional center pore diameter (B). A value (ratio) obtained by<br>
dividing the number of portions having a cross-sectional pore diameter 0.8 times to 1.2<br>
times the cross-sectional center pore diameter (B) by the total number (20) of portions<br>
included in the layer (B) was taken as the degree of isotropy of the layer (B).<br>
[0086]<br>
(10)      Maximum mass M absorbed by inorganic fine powder<br>
The oil absorption was measured using an oil absorption measuring device (S410<br>
manufactured by FRONTEX) in accordance with JIS K6217-4. 5 g of the silica fine<br>
powder was placed in a sample chamber. The organic liquid was added dropwise to the<br>
silica fine powder at 4 ml/min while rotating a rotor blade at 125 rpm. The torque<br>
increases as the silica fine powder absorbs the organic liquid. After the torque reaches<br>
the maximum value, the torque then decreases. The maximum oil absorption mass M<br>
per unit mass of the inorganic fine powder was calculated by the following expression<br>
from the total mass of the organic liquid when the torque initially reached 70% of the<br>
maximum value.<br>
[0087]<br>
Maximum mass absorbed by inorganic fine powder per unit mass = total mass of organic<br>
liquid when torque reaches 70% of maximum value(g) / 5 (g)<br>
[0088]<br>
(11)      Maximum pore diameter (µm) (bubble point method)<br>
The maximum pore diameter of the membrane was measured in accordance with<br>
ASTMF316-03.<br>
(12)      Average pore diameter (µm) (half-dry method)<br>
The average pore diameter of the minimum pore diameter layer of the membrane<br>
was measured in accordance with ASTM F316-03.<br>
(13)      Spinning stability<br>
A hollow fiber membrane was continuously spun for eight hours. A process in<br>
40<br>
which the molten mixture was extruded and cooled to form a multilayer hollow fiber was<br>
observed with the naked eye. A case where the diameter of the hollow fiber did not<br>
change and the hollow fiber did not show interface non-uniformity and had roundness<br>
was evaluated as "Excellent". A case (a) where interface non-uniformity did not occur,<br>
but the hollow fiber had a poor roundness to some extent, or a case (b) where interface<br>
non-uniformity did not occur, but the fiber diameter changed to some extent with not<br>
impairing production was evaluated as "Good". A case where the hollow fiber showed<br>
interface non-uniformity and had a poor roundness was evaluated as "Bad".<br>

A vinylidene fluoride homopolymer was used as the thermoplastic resin, a<br>
mixture of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and dibutyl phthalate was used as the organic liquid,<br>
and a silica fine powder was used as the inorganic fine powder. A two-layer hollow fiber<br>
membrane was melt-extruded using two extruders utilizing a hollow fiber molding nozzle<br>
shown in FIG. 2. An outer-layer molten mixture (a) had a composition in which<br>
vinylidene fluoride homopolymer: bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate: dibutyl phthalate: silica<br>

temperature of 240°C and a discharge linear velocity of 14.2 m/min (i.e., spinning nozzle<br>
discharge parameter R was 440/sec) so that the thickness ratio (outer layeninner layer)<br>
was 10:90. The outer diameter of the nozzle refers to the outermost diameter of the<br>
discharge port in FIG. 2. The inner diameter of the nozzle refers to the maximum<br>
diameter of the lower end of the partition wall between the inner-layer molten mixture<br>

[0090]<br>
The extruded hollow fiber extruded product traveled over 60 cm in the air, and<br>
was introduced into a water bath at 40°C to solidify the product. The product was wound<br>
around a reel at 40 m/min. The resulting two-layer hollow fiber was immersed in<br>
methylene chloride to remove bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and dibutyl phthalate by<br>
extraction, and was then dried. The dried product was immersed in a 50 mass% ethanol<br>
aqueous solution for 30 minutes, immersed in water for 30 minutes, immersed in a 20<br>

The resulting porous two-layer hollow fiber membrane did not show interface<br>
non-uniformity and had a high roundness. As a result of cross-sectional observation<br>
using an electron microscope, it was confirmed that the blocking layer and the support<br>
layer had an isotropic three-dimensional mesh structure without macro-voids. Table 2<br>
shows the outer diameter, the inner diameter, the aspect ratio, the pure water permeation<br>
rate, the uniform latex sphere blocking rate, the breaking strength, the elongation at break,<br>
the compressive strength, the outer surface pore diameter (corresponding to the surface<br>
pore diameter of the layer (B)), the inner surface pore diameter (corresponding to the<br>
surface pore diameter of the layer (A)), the cross-sectional center pore diameter, the ratio<br>
of the outer surface pore diameter and the cross-sectional center pore diameter, the ratio<br>
of the inner surface pore diameter and the cross-sectional center pore diameter, and the<br>
degrees of isotropy of the layer (A) and the layer (B) of the resulting membrane. The<br>
porous two-layer hollow fiber membrane had a high pure water permeation rate, latex<br>
blocking rate, and mechanical strength.<br>
[0092]<br>
The porous two-layer hollow fiber membrane was wetted by the method (2), and<br>
immersed in a 4 mass% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution containing sodium<br>
hypochlorite (free chlorine concentration: 0.5 mass%) at room temperature for 10 days.<br>
The elongation at break of the porous two-layer hollow fiber membrane was measured<br>
before and after immersion. The elongation at break after immersion was 90% of the<br>
elongation at break before immersion. It was confirmed that the porous two-layer<br>
hollow fiber membrane had excellent chemical resistance.<br>

images shown in FIGS. 6 to 11, the outer layer having a small pore diameter and the inner<br>
layer having a large pore diameter were formed in the porous two-layer hollow fiber<br>
membrane. The surface porosity of the layer (B) was 25%.<br>
[0094]<br>
A small amount of graphite was mixed into the molten mixture (a) (outer layer) to<br>
obtain a two-layer hollow fiber (organic liquid was not removed). The entire outer<br>
surface of the two-layer hollow fiber was black. This indicates that the entire outer<br>
surface was covered with the molten mixture (a). A white area which indicates that the<br>
molten mixture (b) was exposed on the outer surface was not observed on the two-layer<br>
hollow fiber over 100 meters or more. FIG. 12 shows a microscope image of the circular<br>
cross section of the two-layer hollow fiber. As shown in FIG. 12, the black layer (layer<br>
of the molten mixture (a)) covered the outer surface in the cross-sectional direction to a<br>
uniform thickness without defects.<br>

image of the cross section at a magnification of 60. FIG. 20 shows an electron<br>
microscope image of the cross section at a magnification of 300. As is clear from the<br>
electron microscope images shown in FIGS. 13 to 20, the outer layer having a small pore<br>
diameter and the inner layer having a large pore diameter were formed in the porous<br>
two-layer hollow fiber membrane. The surface porosity of the layer (B) was 30%.<br>

two-layer hollow fiber membrane had a high pure water permeation rate, latex blocking<br>
rate, and mechanical strength. FIG. 21 shows the measurement results for the<br>
cross-sectional pore diameter when equally dividing the cross section of the porous<br>
two-layer hollow fiber membrane into 100 sections. The porous two-layer hollow fiber<br>
membrane had a structure very similar to that shown in FIG. 5(3). FIG. 33 shows the<br>

Comparative Example 1<br>
A porous two-layer hollow fiber membrane was obtained in the same manner as in<br>
Example 3 except for using an inner-layer molten mixture (b) having a composition in<br>
which vinylidene fluoride homopolymer:bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate:dibutyl phthalate =<br>
40.0:42.0:18.0 (mass ratio). The resulting porous two-layer hollow fiber membrane did<br>
not become stably round (i.e., the membrane became oval or surface waving occurred),<br>
differing from the porous two-layer hollow fiber membranes obtained in the examples.<br>
The property evaluation results of the resulting membrane are shown in Table 2.<br>
[0099]<br>
The porous two-layer hollow fiber membrane was wetted by the method (2), and<br>
immersed in a 4 mass% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution containing sodium<br>
hypochlorite (free chlorine concentration: 0.5 mass%) at room temperature for 10 days.<br>
The elongation at break of the porous two-layer hollow fiber membrane was measured<br>
before and after immersion. The elongation at break after immersion decreased to 20%<br>
of the elongation at break before immersion.<br>
[0100]<br>
A small amount of graphite was mixed into the molten mixture (a) (outer layer) to<br>
obtain a two-layer hollow fiber (organic liquid was not removed) in the same manner as in<br>
Example 1. The outer surface of the two-layer hollow fiber was not entirely black (i.e., a<br>
number of white streaks and spots were observed). This indicates that the outer surface<br>
was not entirely covered with the molten mixture (a) so that the molten mixture (b) (inner<br>
layer) was exposed on the outer surface at a number of points. As a result of<br>
cross-sectional observation of the hollow fiber, the black layer (layer of the molten<br>
mixture (a)) did not thinly covered the outer surface to a uniform thickness without<br>
defects (see FIG. 12). The interface between the layer of the molten mixture (a) (black<br>
layer; outer layer) and the layer of the molten mixture (b) (white layer; inner layer) was<br>
wavy. This indicates that the outer layer partially broke so that the inner layer was<br>
50<br>
exposed on the outer surface.<br>

extruded from the inner-layer slit. As a result of cross-sectional observation using an<br>
electron microscope, it was confirmed that the resulting porous hollow fiber membrane<br>
had an isotropic three-dimensional mesh structure without macro-voids. The property<br>

A porous hollow fiber membrane which has high blocking performance and high<br>
water permeability suitable for filtration and the like and exhibits excellent strength, and a<br>
process for stably producing the porous hollow fiber membrane are disclosed. The<br>
process utilizes a hollow fiber molding nozzle having two or more circular discharge<br>
ports which are disposed concentrically. Multilayer melt-extrusion is performed by<br>
discharging molten mixtures which include a thermoplastic resin and an organic liquid<br>
and differ in composition from the adjacent discharge ports. The resulting product is<br>
cooled to solidify to obtain a hollow fiber. The organic liquid is then removed from the<br>
hollow fiber by extraction to produce a porous hollow fiber membrane. The molten<br>
mixture discharged from at least one circular discharge port includes an inorganic fine<br>
powder in addition to the thermoplastic resin and the organic liquid. The inorganic fine<br>
powder is removed by extraction after cooling in addition to the organic liquid.</raw></td>
