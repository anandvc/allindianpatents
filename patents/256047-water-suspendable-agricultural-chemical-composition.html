				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a stable, water-suspendable agricultural chemical composition comprising at least one liquid agricultural chemical ingredient and at least one solid agricultural chemical ingredient.<br>
Agricultural chemicals are classified on the basis of the drug form of the composition, and in the case of agricultural chemicals used for paddy riqe in particular, since the purpose of their application is the eradication of harmful insects and undesired vegetation like, for example, grasses and weeds in rice paddies, solid granules are primarily in consideration for reliably applying the required amount of agricultural chemical while also saving on labor. However, in the case of granular compositions, the problem is that it is difficult to uniformly spray the entire field. In addition, attempts.have recently been made to improvework efficiency using technology that increases the size of the granules themselves, that increases the amount of the active ingredient (herbicidal active ingredient), and reduces the sprayed amount.<br>
On the other hand, in addition to solid granules, there are also emulsions used for pre-transplantation treatment and water-suspendable agricultural chemical compositions used for post-transplantation treatment. Liquid agricultural chemical compositions, and particularly water-suspendable agricultural chemical compositions, have attracted attention in recent years for reasons such as their ability to reduce the burden on the environment, their ease of handling, and their ease of uniform spraying, dilution and adjustment of concentration. However, water-suspendable agricultural chemical compositions have problems such as instability of the active ingredient in the presence of moisture, difficulty in homogeneously suspending and dispersing all active ingredients in the case of blending two or more types of active ingredients, and particularly in the case of combining a liquid ingredient with a solid ingredient, and susceptibility of the active ingredients to separation, precipitation or aggregation.<br>
In the case of formulating a liquid composition in which is blended two or more types of active ingredients having different physical properties, it is necessary to design the composition so as to inhibit hydrolysis, precipitation and aggregation of all active ingredients while ensuring adequate dispersion, suspension, emulsification or combinations thereof of<br>
the active ingredients' Although auxiliary agents such as emulsifiers. emulsion stabilizers and surfactants are frequently used, there are cases in which hydrolysis and aggregation of the active ingredients are promoted corresponding to the compatibility between the active ingredients and auxiliary agents used. For example, in the case of formulating an aqueous liquid composition comprising pretilachlor, a type of chloroacetoamide-based herbicide that is a liquid at normal temperatures, and bensulfuron-methyl, a type of sulfonylurea-based herbicide that is a solid at normal temperatures, although it is essential to use an auxiliary agent such as an emulsion stabilizer or surfactant in order to suspend and disperse both active ingredients, there are problems such as the occurrence of significant hydrolysis of -the bensulfuron-methyl, precipitation and aggregation depending on the type of auxiliary agent used.<br>
For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H10-287503 describes that an aqueous suspended composition composed of a sulfonylurea-based herbicide as the agricultural chemical active ingredient and/or polyvinyl alcohol having an average degree of polymerization of 2000 or less and a degree of saponification of 69 to 90 moI% as a herbicidal active ingredient having barnyard grass herbicidal activity, and water has satisfactory composition stability, improved diffusivity and is able to prevent chemical damage by preventing adhesion of the chemical to the rice plant bodies. In addition, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H9-183704 describes that the addition of lignin sulfonate allows the obtaining of an aqueous suspension composition containing a sulfonylurea-based herbicide compound having superior long-term storage stability.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a water-suspendable agricultural chemical composition comprising a' liquid agricultural chemical ingredient and a solid agricultural chemical ingredient wherein, dispersion, suspension, emulsification or combinations thereof of the contained ingredients are ensured, hydrolysis is inhibited even when stored for a long period of time, and precipitation and aggregation are also inhibited.<br>

Various types of surfactants and other assistants are mixed in water. An oily phase in which an oil has been dissolved is added to the liquid agricultural chemical ingredient while forcibly stirring with a homogenizer and so forth to emulsify the oily phase in the aqueous phase! This mixture is then suitably forcibly emulsified to a desired particle diameter.<br>
(c)	Production of the composition<br>
The solid agricultural chemical ingredient slurry is added to the liquid agricultural chemical ingredient emulsion (in the ratio emulsion to slurry of, for example, 9:1) followed by suitably mixing with a mixer and so forth to obtain a composition.<br>
An herbicide according to a water-suspendable agricultural chemical composition as claimed in the present invention Is preferable for controlling rice paddy weeds when under water. This Is preferably carried out by applying the required amount of the water-suspendable agricultural chemical composition as claimed in the present invention directly to the rice paddy either directly or after diluting to a suitable concentration with water, or by adding to water that flows into the rice paddy (so-called spout treatment). Moreover, a composition as claimed in the present invention can also be applied simultaneous to planting by a planting machine.<br>

An oily phase in which oil is dissolved is added to the liquid agricultural chemical ingredient while forcibly stirring with a homogenizer to emulsify the oily phase in the aqueous phase. Pretilachlor (common name), S-metoIachlor (common name), esprocarb (common name) or prosulfocarb (common name) is used for the liquid agricultural chemical ingredient. In addition, soybean oil (Honen Corporation) or liquid paraffin (Matsuken, Ivjoresco White P-70) is.used for the oil. Refer to Tables 1 and 2 for the amounts of each ingredient added. The emulsion is forcibly emulsified for about 2 minutes to obtain the desired particle diameter.<br>
(c)	Production of water-suspendable agricultural chemical composition<br>
The solid agricultural chemical ingredient slurry is added to the liquid agricultural chemical ingredient emulsion (ratio of emulsion to slurry = 9:1) followed by mixing for 5 minutes with a laboratory mixer having a propeller-type stirring blade attached to the shaft to obtain a composition.<br>
Stability Test<br>
A storage stability test is conducted at 40°C on each water-suspendable agricultural chemical composition prepared in the manner described above to follow the decomposition of the agricultural chemical ingredients in the composition, the presence or absence of the formation of an oil fraction or cream fraction in the composition, the presence or absence of the occurrence of aggregation or precipitation, and the presence of absence of the formation of a supernatant over time. Those results are shown in Tables 3 to 6.<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
About 100 ml of the agricultural chemical compositions prepared according to the composition method described above are sealed in glass containers and allowed to stand undisturbed in a constant temperature bath at 40°C. The agricultural chemical compositions are removed from the bath after a predetermined time followed by measurement of the content of agricultural chemical ingredients by high-performance liquid chromatography.<br>
About 100 ml of the agricultural chemical compositions prepared according to the composition method described above are sealed in glass containers and allowed to stand undisturbed in a constant temperature bath at 40°C. The agricultural chemical compositions are removed from the bath after the a predetermined time followed by visually confirming the presence or absence of the formation of a supernatant, the presence or absence of separation of the oil fraction or cream fraction, and presence or absence of the formation of an aggregate or precipitate, and measurement of the degrees of each.<br>
On the basis of the results shown in the tables, the blending of an oil is determined to Inhibit separation of agricultural chemical ingredients in the composition as well as to inhibit separation, aggregation and precipitation of ingredients in the composition.<br>
