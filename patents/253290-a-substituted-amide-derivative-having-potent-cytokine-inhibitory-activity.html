				<td>AMIDE DERIVATIVES<br>
This invention relates to amide derivatives, or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof which are useful as inhibitors of cytokine mediated disease. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said amide derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing said amide derivatives and to their use in therapeutic methods, for example by virtue of inhibition of cytokine mediated disease.<br>
The amide derivatives disclosed in the present invention are inhibitors of the production of cytoldnes such as Tumour Necrosis Factor (hereinafter TNF), for example TNFa, and various members of the interieukin (hereinafter IL) family, for example IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8. Accordingly the amide derivatives of the invention will be useful in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions in which excessive production of cytokines occurs, for example excessive production of TNFa or IL-1. It is known that cytokines are produced by a wide variety of cells such as monocytes and macrophages and that they give rise to a variety of physiological effects which are believed to be important in disease or medical conditions such as inflammation and immunoregulation. For example, TNFa and IL-1 have been implicated in the cell signalling cascade which is believed to contribute to the pathology of disease states such as inflammatory and allergic diseases and cytokine-induced toxicity. It is also known that, in certain cellular systems, TNFa production precedes and mediates the production of other cytokines such as IL-1.<br>
Abnormal levels of cytokines have also been implicated in, for example, the production of physiologically-active eicosanoids such as the prostaglandins and leukotrienes, the stimulation of the release of proteolytic enzymes such as collagenase, the activation of the immune system, for example by stimulation of T-helper cells, the activation of osteoclast activity leading to the resorption of calcium, the stimulation of the release of proteoglycans from, for example, cartilage, the stimulation of cell proliferation and to angiogenesis.<br>
Cytokines are also believed to be implicated in the production and development of disease states such as inflammatory and allergic diseases, for example inflammation of the joim   (especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout), inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (especially inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and gastritis), skin disease (especially psoriasis, eczema and dermatitis) and respirator)' disease (especially asthma, bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, chronic obstructive<br><br>
pulmonary disease and adult respiratory distress syndrome), and in the production and development of various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders such as congestive heart failure, acute heart failure, myocardial infarction, the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, hypertension, platelet aggregation, angina, stroke, reperfusion injury, vascular injury including restenosis and peripheral vascular disease, and, for example, various disorders of bone metabolism such as osteoporosis (including senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis), Paget's disease, bone metastases, hypercalcaemia, hyperparathyroidism, osteosclerosis, osteoporosis and periodontitis, and the abnormal changes in bone metabolism which may accompany rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Excessive cytokine production has also been implicated in mediating certain complications of bacterial, fungal and/or viral infections such as endotoxic shock, septic shock and toxic shock syndrome and in mediating certain complications of CNS surgery or injury such as neurotrauma and ischaemic stroke. Excessive cytokine production has also been implicated in mediating or exacerbating the development of diseases involving cartilage or muscle resorption, pulmonary fibrosis, cirrhosis, renal fibrosis, the cachexia found in certain chronic diseases such as malignant disease and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tumour invasiveness and tumour metastasis and multiple sclerosis. Excessive cytokine production has also been implicated in pain.<br>
Evidence of the central role played by TNFcc in the cell signalling cascade which gives rise to rheumatoid arthritis is provided by the efficacy in clinical studies of antibodies of TNFa fThe Lancet 1994, 344.1125 and British Journal of Rheumatology. 1995,34, 334).<br>
Thus cytokines such as TNFa and IL-1 are believed to be important mediators of a considerable range of diseases and medical conditions. Accordingly it is expected that inhibition of the production of and/or effects of these cytokines will be of benefit in the prophylaxis, control or treatment of such diseases and medical conditions.<br>
Without wishing to imply that the amide derivatives disclosed in the present invention possesses pharmacological activity only by virtue of an effect on a single biological process, it is believed that the amide derivatives inhibit the effects of cytokines by virtue of inhibition of the enzyme p38 kinase. p38 kinase, otiierwise known as cytokine suppressive binding protein (hereinafter CSBP) and reactivating kinase (hereinafter RK), is a member of the mitogen-activated protein (hereinafter MAP) kinase family of enzymes which is known to be activated by physiological stress such as that induced by ionising radiation, cytotoxic agents, and toxins,<br><br>
for example endotoxins such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and by a variety of agents such as the cytokines, for example TNFa and IL-1. It is known that p38 kinase phosphorylates certain intracellular proteins which are involved in the cascade of enzymatic steps which leads to the biosynthesis and excretion of cytokines such as TNFa and EL-1. Known inhibitors of p38 kinase have been reviewed by G. J. Hanson in gxpert Opinions on Therapeutic patents. 1997,7,729-733. p38 kinase is known to exist in isoforms identified as p38cc and p38|3.<br>
The amide derivatives disclosed in the present invention are inhibitors of the production of cytokines such as TNF, in particular of TNFa, and various interleukins, in particular IL-1.<br>
It is known from the International Patent Application WO 00/55153, that certain bcnzamide derivatives are inhibitors of the production of cytokines such as TNF, and various interleukins. One of the disclosed compounds is 3-[5-(2-chloropyrid-4-ylcarbonylamino)-2-methylphenyl]^-(4-methylpiperazin-l-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one(Comparator Compound A). Another of the disclosed compounds is 3-[5-(3,5-difluorobenzamido&gt;-2-n^thylphenyl]-6-(4-mcthylpiperazin-l-yl)-3)4-dihydroquinazolin-4-o&gt;ne (Comparator Compound B).<br>
There is no disclosure in this document of an amide derivative which bears a (3-6C)cycloalkylaminocarbonyl substituent at the 3-position of the central 6-methylphenyl core. We have now found that such compounds possess potent cytokine inhibitory activity and have desirable pharmacological activity profiles.<br>

or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Compounds of die Formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically-related compounds. Suitable processes are illustrated by, for example, those in WO 00/55153. Such processes, when used to prepare a novel compound of the Formula I are provided as a further feature of the invention and are illustrated by the following representative process variants in which, unless otherwise stated, R1, R2, R3 and R4 have any of the meanings defined hereinbefore. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry. The preparation of such starting materials is described in conjunction with the following representative process variants and within the accompanying Examples. Alternatively necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist, (a)      A compound of the Formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, may be prepared by reacting an N-phenyl-2-aminobenzamide of the Formula n<br>
II<br>
with a carboxylic acid of the Formula IU, or a reactive derivative thereof,<br><br><br>
wherein variable groups are as defined hereinbefore and wherein any functional group is protected if necessary, and:<br>
(i)   removing any protecting groups; and<br>
(ii) optionally forming a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt.<br>
A suitable reactive derivative of a carboxylic acid of the Formula lH is, for example, an acyl halide, for example an acyl chloride formed by the reaction of the acid and an inorganic acid chloride, for example thionyl chloride; a mixed anhydride, for example an anhydride formed by the reaction of the acid and a chloroformate such as isobutyl chloroformate; an active ester, for example an ester formed by the reaction of the acid with a phenol such as pentafluorophenol, with an ester such as pentafluorophenyl trifluoroacetate or with an alcohol such as N-hydroxybenzotriazole; an acyl azide, for example an azide formed by the reaction of the acid and an azide such as diphenylphosphoryl azide; an acyl cyanide, for example a cyanide formed by the reaction of an acid and a cyanide such as diethylphosphoryl cyanide; or the product of the reaction of the acid and a carbodiimidc such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. A preferred reactive derivative of a carboxyiic acid of the Formula IE is, for example, an ester of the corresponding ortho acid of the carboxylic acid of the Formula EQ, for example a trialkyl ester such as a trimethyl or triethyl ester. For a carboxylic acid of the Formula in wherein R3 is hydrogen, a suitable ortho acid ester is triethyl orthoformate and for a carboxylic acid of the Formula HI wherein R3 is methyl, a suitable ortho acid ester is triethyl orthoacetate.<br>
The reaction may conveniently be carried out in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate, alkoxide, hydroxide or hydride, for example sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium ethoxide, potassium butoxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydride or potassium hydride, or an organometallic base such as an alkyl-lithium, for example n-butyl-lithium, or a dialkylamino-lithium, for example lithium di-isopropylamide, or, for example, an organic auiine base such as, for example, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, Iriethylamine, morpholine or diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene.<br>
The reaction may also conveniently be carried out in the presence of a suitable acid<br><br>
Typical reaction conditions include the use of ammonium formate or hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst, for example a metallic catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon. Alternatively a dissolving metal reduction may be carried out, for example using iron in the presence of an acid, for example an inorganic or organic acid such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric or acetic acid. The reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of an organic solvent (preferably a polar protic solvent) and preferably with heating, for example to about 60°C. Any functional groups are protected and deprotected as necessary.<br>
The nitrobenzene of the Formula IV may be prepared by the reaction of the acid of the Formula V, or a reactive derivative thereof as defined hereinbefore<br><br>
under standard amide bond forming conditions, wherein variable groups are as defined hereinbefore and wherein any functional group is protected if necessary.<br>
Typical conditions include activating the carboxy group of the compound of Formula V, for example by treatment with a halo reagent (for example oxalyl chloride) to form an acyl halide in an organic solvent at ambient temperature and then reacting the activated compound with the amine of Formula VI. Any functional groups are protected and deprotected as necessary. Conveniently a carbodiimide coupling reagent is used in the presence of an organic solvent (preferably an anhydrous polar aprotic organic solvent) at a non-extreme temperature, for example in the region -10 to 40°C, typically at ambient temperature of about 20°C.<br>

The following assays can be used to measure the p38 kinase-inhibitory, the TNF-inhibitory and anti-arthritic effects of compounds of the Formula I: In vitro enzyme assay<br>
The ability test compounds to inhibit the enzyme p38 kinase was assessed. Activity of the test compound against each of the p38a and p38(5 isoforms of the enzyme was determined.<br>
Human recombinant MKK6 (GenBank Accesion Number Gl 209672) was isolated from Image clone 45578 (Genomics. 1996,23,151) and utilised to produce protein in the form of a GST fusion protein in a pGEX vector using analogous procedures to those disclosed by J. Han gt al., Journal of Biological Chemistry. 1996, 271. 2886-2891. p38cc (GenBank Accession Number G529039) and p38|5 (GenBank Accession Number Gl 469305) were isolated by PCR amplification of human lymphoblastoid cDNA (GenBank Accession Number GM1416) and human foetal brain cDNA [synthesised from mRNA (Clontech, catalogue no. 6525-1) using a Gibco superscript cDNA synthesis kit] respectively using oligonucleotides designed for the 5' and 3' ends of the human p38oc and p38(3 genes using analogous procedures to those described by J.Han el al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta. 1995,1265. j^-t 227 and Y. Jiang et §1, Journal of Biological Chemistry. 1996,271.17920-17926.<br>
Both p38 protein isoforms were expressed in E.coli in PET vectors. Human recombinant p38a and p38£i isoforms were produced as 5' c-myc, 6His tagged proteins. Both MKK6 and the p38 proteins were purified using standard protocols: the GST MKK6 was<br><br>
purified using a glutathione sepharose column and the p38 proteins were purified using nickel chelate columns.<br>
The p38 enzymes were activated prior to use by incubation with MKK6 for 3 hours at 30°C. The unactivated E.coli-expressed MKK6 retained sufficient activity to fully activate both isoforms of p38. For p38a, the activation incubate comprised p38a (50ul of lOmg/ml), MKK6 (5ul of 12mg/ml), 'Kinase buffer' [550ul; pH 7.4 buffer comprising Tris HC1 (50mM), EGTA (O.lmM), sodium orthovanadate (O.lmM) and p-mercaptoethanol (0.1%)], Mg [75ul of lOOmM Mg(OCOCH3)2 ] and ATP (75uJ of ImM). The activation incubate for p38(3 was similar to the above except containing p38|3 enzyme (82|il at 3.05mg/ml) and 518jil "Kinase buffer". p38a and p38(3 activation incubates were cither used fresh or aliquoted and stored at -80°C.<br>
The test compound was solubilised in DMSO (lOmM) and 1:3 serial dilutions in DMSO carried out in polypropylene plates (Costar 3365). Compound dilutions were then diluted 1:10 in "Kinase buffer" and lOul transferred to a microtiter assay plate (Costar 3596). Control wells contained lOul (1:10 dilution in kinase buffer) DMSO. 'Kinase Assay Mix' [30)Jl; comprising Myelin Bask Protein (Sigma M-1891; 0.5ml of a 6.66mg/ml solution in "Kinase buffer"), activated p38a enzyme (3.8nl) and 'Kinase Buffer' (2.55ml)] was then added. Control wells on each plate either contained the above "Kinase Assay Mix" (n=6 replicates) or contained "Kinase Assay Mix" in which the activated p38 enzyme was replaced by Kinase buffer (n=6 replicates). 'Labelled ATP' was then added to all wells [lOul; comprising 50fiM ATP, 5\iCi 33P ATP (Amersham International cat. no. AH9968) and 50mM Mg(OCOCH3)2]. For p38p, 23ul activated p38p enzyme and "Kinase buffer" (2.53 ml) were included in the "Kinase Assay Mix". The final concentration of test compound was 2,4uM-Q.001uM (n=2 replicates). Microtiter plates were incubated at ambient temperature (with gentle agitation) for 60 minutes and the reaction stopped by addition of 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (50ul), The precipitate protein was captured onto filter plates (PerkinElmer 6005174) using a Packard Filtermate harvester (2% TCA wash) which was then dried overnight and 25ul MICROSCINT O (Packard O6013611) added to each well. Plates were counted on a Top Count scintillation counter. Dose response curves were generated using an in house automated data analysis package and an Origin curve fitting package.<br><br>
In vitro cell-based assays mPBMC<br>
The ability of a test compound to inhibit TNFa production was assessed by using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells which synthesise and secrete TNFa when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinised (10 units/ml heparin) human blood by density centrifugation (Lymphoprep™ ; Nycomed). Mononuclear cells were resuspended in "Culture Medium" [RPMI1640 medium (Sigma R0883) containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50ug/ml streptomycin and 2mM glutamine] supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Sigma H-1513)]. Compounds were solubilised in DMSO at a concentration of 20mM, diluted 1:100 in "culture medium" and serial dilutions carried out in "Culture Medium" containing 1% DMSO. PBMCs (2.2X105 cells in 160^1 culture medium) were incubated with 20u,l of varying concentrations of test compound (duplicate cultures) or 20ul culture medium containing 1% DMSO (control wells) for 30 minutes at 37°C in a humidified (5%CO;&gt;/95% air) incubator (Corning 3595 ; 96 well flat-bottom tissue culture plates). 20uJ lipopolysaccharide [LPS E.Coli 0111 :B4 (Sigma L-4130), final concentration 0. lug/ml] solubilised in "Culture Medium" was added to appropriate wells. 20uJ Culture Medium was added to "medium alone" control wells. Six "UPS alone" and six "medium alone" controls were included on each 96 well plate.<br>
The test compound was tested for TNFa inhibitory activity over a final concentration dose range of 20uM-O.OOOlMM. Each test included a known TNFa inhibitor i.e. the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (Lee, J.C., et al (1994) Nature 372 p739-746). Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C (humidified incubator) after which 100^1 of the supernatant was removed from each well and stored at -80°C (96 well round-bottom plates; Corning 3799). TNFa levels were determined in each sample using a human TNFa ELISA (using R&amp;D Systems paired antibodies, MAB610andBAF210. % inhibition = (LPS alone - medium alone) - (test concentration - medium alone) x 100<br>

Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C (humidified incubator), prior to addition of 20ul LPS (final concentration lOug/ml). Culture medium was added to control wells. Six "LPS alone" and six "medium alone" controls were included on each plate. A known TNFa synthesis/secretion inhibitor was included in each test. Plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37°C (humidified incubator). Plates were centrifuged (2000 rpm for 10 minutes) and 80^1 plasma removed and stored at -80°C (Coming 3799 plates). TNFa levels were measured by ELISA using paired antibodies from R&amp;D Systems (catalogue nos. MAB610 and BAF210). In vivo assessment<br>
The ability of a test compound to inhibit TNFa synthesis in vivo was assessed in a rat lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -challenge model. Briefly, compound was dosed orally (100-0.3mg/kg in 20% DMSO (Sigma D-2650) / 60% PEG 400 (Fisher Scientific P/3676/08) / 20% sterile de-ionised water; 5 animals per group) to female Wistar Alderley Park (AP) rats (80-100g) at appropriate timepoints prior to challenge with LPS. Control animals (10 per group) were dosed vehicle alone. LPS (LPS RColi 0111:B4 ; Sigma L-4130) was administered intravenously (30ug in 0.2 ml sterile physiological saline (Phoenix Pharma Ltd). A control group were challenged with 0.2 ml sterile physiological saline. Blood was obtained 60 minutes later from anaesthetised animals and serum isolated after 2 hours incubation at ambient temperature (Sarstedt serum separator 1ml microtubes, ref 41.1500.005) and centrifugation. Serum samples were stored at -80 °C prior to determination of TNFa content by ELISA (R&amp;D Systems rat TNFa Quantikine kit, catalogue no. SRTAOO). % inhibition<br><br>

In In Vivo Models of Inflammation, eds Morgan, D.W. and Marshall, L.A., Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland].<br>
Briefly, female Lewis rats (160-180g) were sensitised by intra-aiticular injection of 5ug streptococcal cell wall (Lee Labs, PG-PS 100P) in 20ul sterile physiological saline into the left ankle. Responsiveness was assessed 3 days later and animals randomised. Arthritis was induced 21 days after sensitisation (designated day 0) by intravenous injection of lOOjig sew (in SOOuJ sterile physiological saline). Compound was dosed orally(50-l mg/kg once daily) (4 ml/kg) either before (day-1) or after disease onset (day+1) (10 animals per test group ; vehicle 0.5% (w/v) HPMC and 0.1%(w/v) polysorbate 80). Control animals (n=10) received vehicle alone. "Non-induced" control animals which were dosed with vehicle were also included (5 animals per group). Animals were weighed on a daily basis from day-1 and ankle diameters measured with Vernier callipers on a daily basis from day-1. At termination on day 6, left hind limbs were removed and fixed in 10% formalin for histological assessment.<br>
