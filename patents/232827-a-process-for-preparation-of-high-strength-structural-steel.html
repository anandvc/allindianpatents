				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for preparation of high strength structural steel. More specifically but without implying any limitation thereto the invention relates to an advanced controlled rolling process leading to high strength structural steel of improved toughness and weldability.<br>
Conventional high strength structural steels particularly refer to HY (High Yield) class of steels having yield strength of about 550 Mpa and sufficiently high impact toughness depending on its application. For example HY-80 steel exhibits toughness of more than 80 J at-18 degree Celsius. A good combination of strength and toughness makes the steel resistant to high pressures, impact loading or sub-ambient catastrophic brittle failures. Such high strength steel find applications in pressure vessels, ship-building, line pipe, earth moving equipment, cranes, bridges, road and rail tankers, wagons and other engineering and structural applications where loading is high and weight saving is critical.<br>
The mechanical properties of HY class of steel is achieved by heat treatment (e.g. quenching and tempering) of the steel and for this purpose the steel is designed to respond to heat treatment by keeping the carbon content and other allying elements sufficiently high. This imposes a limitation in the steel as due to its high carbon equivalent (carbon + other alloying elements) the steel becomes difficult to weld unless preheating is carried out.<br>
Development of newer grades of stronger and tougher High Strength Low Alloying (HSLA) steels involves not only the achievement of improved steel chemistry and manufacturing process but also various advancements in Thermo-Mechanical processing (TMP). The use of advanced processing techniques like controlled rolling (CR) and controlled cooling (CC) have been observed to be<br><br>
particularly suited to HSLA steels containing microallaying elements like Neabium (Mb), Titanium (Ti ) , Venadium (V) and Do ran ( B ) .<br>
The sole purpose of controlling the hot-deformation  in<br>
•a  controlled  rolling  process  is  to  refine  the   final<br>
austenite grains., which, in turn, transform into fine grained<br>
ferritic and/or bainitic microstructure. This fine grained microstructure not only cause enhancement in strength but also improve toughness. Grain refining is the only strengthening mechanism which can cause improvement in both strength and toughness unlike strengthening mechanisms like solid solution strengthening, precipitation hardening,' dislocation hardening and the likes.<br>
In the known controlled rolling process of any microalloyed steel, the Slab Reheat Temperature (SRT) is chosen to be sufficiently high enough (1150 -1200 degree celsius) to bring the microalloyed carbides and carbonitrides in solid solution. Deformation of austenite in the recrysta 11isat ion region is carried out to obtain uniform distribution of fine equiaxed austenite grains by repeatedly breaking with minimum interpass time to minimise grain growth after static recrystal1isation. Deformation in any pass is carefully controlled to avoid either partial recrysta 11isat ion which causes mixed grain structure, or to avoid dynamic recrystalisation where there is no further<br>
grain  .refining with increased deformation.  The   resulting<br>
» structure  is required to have uniform distribution of  fine<br>
nrained micros t r.yc:,turc? . Defarmatin of austenite? in the non-'"uc ryst al 1 i sat ion region is carried out to cause further breaking of austenite grains so as to result in further refinement of transformed ferritic microstructure due to additional nucleation sites from deformation bands. In this<br>
kind  of deformation, aus'tenite gets elongated and  pancaked<br>
*	' i<br>
containing  3  numbnr of deformation  bands.   Qccurence  of<br>
nucleation at rlongated gamma-grain boundaries as well as at interiors (i.e. deformation bands) further causes a Cosiderable refinement in the transformed microstructure.<br><br>
The conventional processes known in the art have the drawback that there are chances of coarse grain/mixed grain structure with less control over uniform distribution of fine-equiaxed grain structure. This result in loss of ductility and also less impact toughness. This is particularly so in microalloyed steels where fine precipitates control the recrystallisation and grain growth behaviour.<br>
Another drawback, of the steel obtained by the process of the present invention is that it is very difficult to weld HY grade of steel obtained by these processes as it requires preheating for successful welding without any occurance of Hydrogen induced cracking (HIC).<br>
The primary and the main object of the present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of high strength structural steel.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of high strength structural steel with improved mechanical properties like improved impact toughness and enhanced strength.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of high strength structural steel with enhanced low—temperaturi?. toughness at sub—zero temperatures of the order of minus (-) 40 degree celsius.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of high strength structural steel wherein both strength and ductility can be simultaneously enhanced unlike the conventional processes where one is achieved at the cost of other.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a ^process for the preparation of high strength structural steel wherein the proposed process<br><br>
altogether   dispenses   off   the   elaborate   heat-treatment   processes like  quenching/   sol ut ionising /   tempering   or   ageing   which are   required   in   conventional   processes,      thereby   making   the<br>
process   more   cost-effective     and      energy-efI icieni  .<br>
i A   still    further   object   of   the   present   invention   is<br>
to  propose   a process   for   the  preparation   of   high   strength structural      steel   which   obviates   the   need      for   special    facilities like   "roll   quenching   to   obtain   desired   package     of   strength, ductility   and   toughness   and  provides   steel   with     most     of these     properties   in      "as     rolled"     condition.<br>
An-  even      further   object   of   the   present   invention   is to  propose   a   process      for   the   preparation   of   high        strength structural      steel   which   provides   steel   with   low   carbon   content and   low   carbon   equivalent   (carbon   and   alloying   elements) thereby   making   the     steel      easily   weldable.<br>
A     still      further   object   of   the   present   invention   is to propose  a process     for  preparation  of  high     strength  structural steel      which     1 ea'ds   to   extremely   fine     ferrite   grain   size of   about   3-4   microns   as   compared   to  grain   size   of   about   18-20 microns  produced  by   conventional   processes.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to   propose    a process for preparation of^ high strength structural steels which involves addition of microalloying elements like boron and niobium and keeping the carbon "content much leaner which besides significantly improving weldability leads to cost-reduction.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of high strength structural steel which eliminates intermediate holding adopted in conventional processes to extend finish rolling pass in non-recrystallisation region of austenite. This intermediate holding is difficult to be controlled under shop floor conditions and may<br>
also result in static recrystallisation followed by grain growth thereby adversely affecting the microstructure refinement.<br><br>
The process of the present invention provides a new generation of high strength steel with enhanced mechanical propertion, . The advanced controlled rolling process proposed. under the present invention involves optimisation of various processing parameters which include slab t'cheat ing temperature, deformation in the gamma-recrysta 11isotion and non-recrystal1isation temperature regions, finish rolling temperature and subsequent post deformation  cooling. The process involves addition of micros 11oving elements like boron and niobium and keeping the carbon content much lower. This, in addition to cost, reduction, improves weldability of steel to a significant f"'tent. Since number of welding operations are required to be performed during manufacture, improvement in welding is UK! significant feature of the steel obtained by the<br>
I •<br>
process.<br>
The combined addition of the allaying elements  results<br>
in a fine microstrueture having lath morphology and availability of a large population of mobile dislocations in the as rolled condition itself. Thus, this steel exhibVta superior mechanical properties in the as rolled state as compared to the conventional steels which otherwise1 rnqui-re elaborate heat treatment. In this process both strength and ductility can be simultaneously enhanced lUniike the conventional processes, where one is achieved at the cost of other.<br><br>
A louier slab reheating temperature (SRT),in the range oi 10OO-1050 degree Celsius, improves the sub-zero impact tauqhnr'-sT. to a considerable extent as compared to higher slab reheating temperature (SRT) in the range of 1100-1150 degree cellus in the conventional process. This also enables to start the hot deformation process from the fine grained gamma region. This not only results in finer final microstrueture but also leads to improved low temperature toughness. The deformation in each pass is kept -sufficient enough to avoid partial recrystal1isation. This low slab-reheating temperature alongwith repeated deformation (16-17V. per pass) uiith minimum inter pass time (5-6 seconds) makes it passible to extend the finish rolling down into the nan-recryst al 1. isat ion region but above Austenite to Ferrite transformation (Ar 3) temperature without any intermediate holding. Rolling in two-phase region is carefully avoided, as this deteriorates the low temperature toughness of this grade of steel, through the occurence of splitting. This requires a heavy deformaiton (20-30%) preferably 22-25% in the finishing pass when the finish rolling temperature (FRT) is above Ar3.<br>
Conventional high strength steels used for critical ship building application envolve elaborate heat tratment processes such as quenching, solutionising tempering or ageing. Special facility such as "roll quenching" is required to obtain a desired package of strength, ductility<br><br>
and toughness. Whereas, most of these properties are obtained in the "as rolled" condition in the current steel prepared by process of the present invention through control of the rolling paramters. The conventional steel making is more time consuming and is less energy-efficient as it involve the use of higher Slab Reheating Temperature (SRT) ('1150-1200 dgree ceslius) and complicated post deformation heat treatment schedules. Since the steel is reheated at 1150-1200 degree Celsius, the benefit of rolling in the nan rcrystal1ised region of austenite cannot be fully exploited. This is because, by the time last rolling pass is carrid out, the finish rolling temperature may not necessarily come down to the non-recrystal1isat ion region. Attempts often made to extend the finish rolling pass in non-recrystallisation region of austenite, by suitable<br>
intermediate  holding,  may  not result  in  improvement  in<br>
i mechanical  properties.   This  is because  the  process  of<br>
intermediate holding is difficult to be controlled under shop floor conditions. Moreover, the intermediate holding may also result in static recrystal1isat ion followed by grain growth and thereby hindering microstructural refinement. On the other hand SRT for the current rolling schedule being lower at 1000-1050 degree celsius, maximum benefit of rolling in the austenite non-recrystal1isation range is ensured. This results in obtaining desired combirlation of properties in the "as rolled" condition itsel f .<br><br>

The ingot is then subjected to the step of aircooling.<br>
