Combinations comprising epothiiones and pharmaceutical uses thereof<br>
The invention relates to a pharmaceutical combination which comprises (a) a HER-1 or a HER-2 antibody or (b) at least one antineoplastic agent selected from the group consisting of aromatase inhibitors, antiestrogens, topoisomerase I inhibitors, topoisomerase li inhibitors, nnicrotubule active agents, protein l^inase C inhibitors, anti-angiogenic compounds, gonadorelin agonists, anti-androgens, histone deacetyiase inhibitors and S-adenosyl-methionine decarboxylase inhibitors; and (c) an epothilone derivative and optionally at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for simultaneous, separate or sequential use, in particular, for the treatment of a proliferative disease, especially a solid tumor disease; a pharmaceutical composition comprising such a combination; the use of such a combination for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a proliferative disease; a commercial package or product comprising such a combination as a combir^ed preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use; and to a method of treatment of a warm¬blooded animal, especially a human.<br>
Despite the widespread use of Taxol* and Taxotere* in the treatment of many different tumor types, the impact of taxanes on patient survival has been modest, and the ovenwhelmtng majority of metastatic solid tumors remain incurable. Taxane treatment is associated with a number of significant side-effects, and the effectiveness of taxanes can be severely limited by the rapid development of drug resistance mechanisms. In view of these limitations as well as the side-effects commonly observed with standard combination therapies, there is a clear need for the identification of novel cytotoxic anti-cancer agents exhibiting an improved overall profile including spectmm of anti-tumor activity, efficacy against multi-drng resistant tumors, safety and tolerability.<br>
The microtubule-stabilizing effect of the epothiiones was first described by Bollag et al.. Cancer Research 5§, 1995, 2325-33. A suitable treatment schedule for the treatnront of different t^MS of tumors, especially tumors which are refractory to the treatment by other chemotherapeutics, in particular TAXOL™, using an epothilone, in particular epothilone A or B, is described in WO 99/43320.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the anti-proliferative effect of a combination as defined herein is greater than the effect that can be achieved with either type of combination<br><br>
partner alone, i.e. greater than the effect of a monotherapy using only one of the combination partners (aj and (c) as defined hereiri.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the antineoplastic effect, in particular in the treatment of a proliferative disease, especially a solid tumor disease, that is refractory to other chemo-therapeutics known as antineoplastic agents, of a combination as defined herein is greater than the effects that can be achieved with either type of combination partner alone, i.e., greater than the effect of a monotherapy using only one of the combination partners (b) and (c) as defined herein.<br>

The nature of proliferative diseases like solid tumor diseases is multifactorial. Under certain circumstances, drugs with different mechanisms of action may be combined. However, just considering any combination of drugs having different mode of action does not necessarily lead to combinations with advantageous effects.<br>
The subject-matter of the final products, the phamnaceutlcal preparations and the claims of the patent rights cited herein-above is hereby incorporated into the present application by reference. Comprised are likewise the corresponding stereoisomers as well as the corresponding crystal modifications, e.g. solvates and polymorphs, which are disclosed therein. The compounds used as active ingredients in the combinations disclosed herein can be prepared and administered as described in the cited documents, respectively, if not otherwise mentioned herein.<br>
All the more surprising is the experimental finding that in vivo the administration of a ggfggjS^JrloN OF THE INVENfr&amp;fc^, results not only in a beneficial effect, especially a synergistic therapeutic effect, e.g. with regard to slowing down, arresting or reversing the neoplasm formation or a longer duration of tumor response, but also in further surprising beneficial effects, e.g. less side-effects, an improved quality of Itfa and a decreased mortality and mort»dtty, compared to a equiefficacious monotherapy apptyir^ onty one of the pharmaceutically active ingredients used in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION, in particular In the treatment of a tumor that is refractory to other chemotherapeutics known as anti-cancer agents.<br>
A further benefit is that lovrer doses of the active Ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be used, for example, that the dosages of at least one combination partner need not onty often be smaller, but are also applied less frequency, in order to diminish the incidence of side-effects. This is in accordance with the desires and requirements of the patients to be treated.<br><br>
It can be shown by established test models and in particular those test models described herein that a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION results in a more effective delay of progression or treatment of a proliferative disease compared to the effects observed with the single combination partners. The person skilled in the pertinent art is fully enabled to select a relevant test model to prove the hereinbefore and hereinafter mentioned therapeutic indications and beneficial effects. The pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may, for example, be demonstrated in a clinical study or in a test procedure as essentially described hereinafter.<br>
Suitable clinical studies are in particular open label non-randomized, dose escalation studies or placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in patients with advanced solid tumors. Such studies prove in particular the synergism of the active ingredients of the COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION. The beneficial effects on proliferative diseases can be determined directly through the results of these studies or by changes in the study design which are known as such to a person skilled in the art. Such studies are, in particular, suitable to compare the effects of a monotherapy using the active ingredients and a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
Preferably, the combination partner (a) is administered with a fixed dose and the dose of the combination partner (b) is escalated until the Maximum Tolerated Dosage (MTD) is reached. The efficacy of the treatment can be determined in such studies, e.g., after 18 or 24 weeks by radiologic evaluation of the tumors every 6 weeks.<br>
Alternatively, a placebo-controlled, double blind study can be used in order to prove the benefits of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION mentioned herein.<br>
In a dose escalation study, preferably, the HER-1 or HER-2 antibody, e.g. trastuzumab, ts administered in a fixed dose, preferably. 2mg/kg frastuzumab administered as a 30 minute infusion, e.g. on a once weekly basis, and the dose of the epothilone derivative of formula I, e.g. epothilone B, is escalated. In a preferred embodiment of the study, the epothilone derivative of formula I is administered once weekly i.v. for three weeks, followed by one week off starting, e.g.. with 0.5 mg/m' epothilone B and escalating the dose to 1.0 mg/m^, 1.5 mg/m^, 2.0 mg/m* and 2.5 mg/m^ until the Maximum Tolerated Dosage is reached. Each four week interval will be considered one cycle. The efficacy of the treatment can be determined in<br><br>
these studies, e.g., after 18 or 24 v^feeks by radiological evaluation of the tumors every 6 weeks. In one embodiment of such a dose escalating clinical study, a HER-1 or a HER-2 antibody is given as a pretreatment. Pretreatment means that before the treatment with the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is started, the HER-1 or HER-2 antibody is administered to the patient, preferably as a 90-minute infusion with a weekly dose of about 4mg/kg. for a period of about one or two weeks.<br>
The response criteria relating to the evaluation of target lesions to be applied in a clinical<br>
study, e.g. a breast cancer study, as described above are defined as follows:<br>
Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions.<br>
Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of<br>
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.<br>
Stable Disease <s0 neither sufficient stirinkage to qualify for pr nor sjfficient increase></s0>
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.<br>
Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% Increase In the sum of the LD of target lesions,<br>
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the<br>
appearance of one or more new lesions.<br>
It is one objective of the present Invention to provide a method of treatment of a proliferative disease applying a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION having a higher rate in CR, PR or SD compared to monotherapy applying oniy one combination partner.<br>
The COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can also be applied in combination with surgical intervention, mild prolonged whole body hyperthermia and/or irradiation therapy.<br>
One embodiment of the invention relates to the use of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION for the treatment of or for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a solid tumor disease.<br>
It is a ftjTther objective of this invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a quantity, which is jointly therapeutically effective against a proliferative disease comprising the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION. In this composition, the combination partners (a) or (b), and (c) can be administered together, one after the other or separately in one<br><br>
combined unit dosage form or In two separate unit dosage forms. The unit dosage form may also be a fixed combination.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared in a manner Itnown per se and are those suitable for enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral administration to mammals (warm-blooded animals), including man, comprising a thera¬peutically effective amount of at least one phamiacologically active combination partner alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carries, especially suitable for enteral or parenteral application.<br>
The novel pharmaceutical composition contains, for example, from about 10 % to about 100 %, preferably from about 20 % to about 60 %, of the active ingredients. Pharmaceutical preparations for the combination therapy for enteral or parenteral administration are, for example, those in unit dosage forms, such as sugar-coated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories, and furthermore ampoules. If not indicated otherwise, these are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. It will be appreciated that the unit content of a combination partner contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective amount since the necessary effective amount can be reached by administration of a plurality of dosage units.<br>
In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcristalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lutiricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.<br>
In particular, a therapeutically effective amount of each of the combination partner of the COIWBINATION OF THE INVENTION may be administered simultaneously or sequentially and in any order, and the components may be administered separately or as a fixed combination. For example, the method of treatment of a proliferative disease according to the invention may comprise (1) administration of the first combination partner in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form and (ii) adminstration of the second combination<br><br>
partner In free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, in jointly therapeutically effective amounts, preferably in synergistically effective amounts, e.g. in daily or ^Neekly dosages corresponding to the amounts described herein. The individual combination partners of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms. Furthermore, the term administering also encompasses the use of a pro-drug of a combination partner that convert in vivo to the combination partner as such. The instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
The effective dosage of each of the combination partners employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may vary depending on the particular compound or pharmaceutical composition employed, the mode of admir^istration, the condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated. Thus, the dosage regimen for the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including the route of administration and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. A physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the single active Ingredients required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentration of the active ingredients within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the active ingredients' availability to target sites. This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of the active ingredients.<br>
When the combination partners employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION are applied in the form as marketed as single drugs, their dosage and mode of administration can take place In accordance with the information provided on the packet leaflet of the respectwe marketed dmg in order to result in the beneficial effect described herein, if not mentioned herein othenwise.<br>

QC Criteria<br>
Primary plate OC status<br>
cHTS plate formats contain groups of positive and negative intra-plate control wells that are used for automated quality control. All assay plates are assigned an automated QC value by the LIM system following data collection. Automatic quality control calls are made based on the Z-factor calculated using intra-plate controls using a standard factor Z = 1-3{_y+_lJ)/(V-U), where V,Uaxe the mean vehicle (treated) and media (untreated) control levels, and _V,_U are the corresponding standard deviation estimates. Z-factor thresholds are empirically set to group plates into three classes: automatically accepted (Z &gt;0.6), automatically rejected (Z 
Transfer controls<br>
A positive control compoimd (Gentian Violet) is included on all master plates. This provides a visual check for screening scientists to verify compound transfer from both column and row masters into the assay plate.<br>
Secondary OC<br>
Secondary QC includes additional manual checks of data quality including: visual inspection of plate quality and transfer controls, marking of data spikes, and checking for cell-line appropriate behavior of single agents. Plates with an accepted status from primary QC that show an unacceptable plate gradient are adjusted to rejected status and queued for repeat. Plates are also visually inspected for occasional bad wells, or "spikes" with data values that are very different from their immediate neighbors (within the same treatment class). These data spikes are flagged in the database, and excluded from subsequent analyses. Finally, dose-response matrices containing single-agent activity inconsistent with past experience will be marked with rejected status and queued for repeat. Data blocks that did not achieve the cut-off threshold were flagged in the database, excluded from subsequent analysis and queued for repeat as necessary.<br>
Measuring Antiproliferative Activity<br><br>
The measure of effect was the inhibition of cell viability using an alamar blue viability assay relative to the untreated level (vehicle alone). For untreated and treated levels U and T, a fractional mhibition I = 1~T/U was calculated. The inhibition ranges from 0% at the untreated level to 100% when T = 0.<br>
Each treated level T was compared to the median untreated level U ± oU, determined for each plate by finding the median alamar blue level (and its associated uncertainty, described above) among the untreated control wells arranged across the plate. Applying standard error propagation rules to the expression for I, the estimated standard error CTI ~ (aU/U)sqrt(l-I).<br>
The error estimates were fLirther increased to account for variations between replicate combination blocks as well as a minimum assumed fractional uncertainty of _min ~ 3%. Thus for inhibition, the standard error estimate becomes cl - sqrt{ (oU/U)2 (l-I) + orep<br>
2 + Omin .<br>
Medians and Error Estimates<br>
Medians were used rather than averages to reduce the effect of occasional outliers on the consensus. While medians are more robust to outliers, they are more sensitive to statistical noise,yielding ^30% larger deviations. Standard deviations are estimated from the median absolute deviation (MAD), where for a normal distribution, the sample deviation adat - 1.5 MAD. The standard error for the median itself is then omed ~ odat/sqrt(N-l), given N data values.<br>
Single Agent Dose Curves<br>
The single agent activity is characterized by fitting a sigmoidal function of the form I = Imax/[l+(C/EC50) °], with least squares minimization using a downhill simplex algorithm.Here, C is the concentration, EC50 is the effective concentration at 50% inhibition, and o is the sigmoidicity. The uncertainty of each fitted parameter was estimated from the range over which the change in reduced chi-squared x2 is less than one, or less than minimum reduced X 2 if that minimum exceeds one, to allow for underestimated al errors. To ensure optunal concentration the EC50 was determmed and maximum effect level in each of the proposed proliferation assays. 384-weII plates were used , to obtain duplicate dose response curves in 12-step dilutions with a dosing ratio f= 2,3, or 4, to cover 3-7 orders of magnitude.<br>
Selecting Optimal Concentrations<br>
We use the single agent curve data to define a dilution series for each compound to be used for combination screening. Using a dilution factor f of 2, 3, or 4, depending on the sigmoidicity of the single agent curve, we will choose 5 dose levels with the central concentration close to the fitted EC50. For compounds with no detectable single agent activity, we will use f = 4 starting from the highest achievable concentration.<br>
Combination Dose Matrices and Reference Models<br>
The cHTS screenmg produces dose matrices which contain all pakwise combinations of two single agents at a series of concentrations, including zero. Each dose matrix contains internal copies of the single agent curves which are used as the reference for combination effects. Replicate dose matrices can be merged together by medianing the corresponding data points, and when the concentration series differ, corresponding values are found using bilinear interpolation. Standard errors were computed for each inhibition value using the formulas described above. Combination effects were most readily characterized by comparing each data point's mhibition to that of a combination reference model that was derived fi-om the single agent curves. Three models are generally used: (1) The highest single agent model<br><br>
IHSA(CX,CY) = max(IX,rY) is a simple reference model, where CX,Y are the concentrations of the X and Y compound, and IX,Y are the inhibitions of the single agents at CX,Y; (2) Bliss independence IBliss(CX,CY) = IX + lY - IXIY represents the statistical expectation for independent competing inhibitors; and (3) Loewe additivity, where ILoewe(CX,CY) is the inhibition that satisfies (CX/ECX) + (CY/ECY) = 1, and ECX,Y are the effective concentrations at ILoewe for the single agent curves. Loewe additivity is the generally accepted reference for synergy[4], as it represents the combination response generated if X and Y are the same compound. Both IHSA and IBhss are easily calculated from JX, Y, but determining ILoewe requires interpolation and numerical root finding.<br>
Selecting Combinations for 9x9 Re-test<br>
To select desirable oncology combinations for repeat assays using high resolution 9x9 dose<br>
matrices, three important considerations were evaluated: (1) significant synergy over the additive model; (2) substantial activity where the synergy occurs; and (3) sufficient potency shifting. A "Synergy Score"was used whereby S =^ log fX log fY _ Idata (Idata-ILoewe), summed over all non-single-agent concentration pairs, and where log fX,Y are the natural logarithm of the dilution factors used for each single agent. This effectively calculates a volume between the measured and Loewe additive response surfaces, weighted towards high inhibition and corrected for varymg dilution factors. This volume score emphasizes the overall synergistic or antagonistic effect of the combination, thus minimizing the effects of outlying data spikes and identifying combinations with a robust synergy across a wide range of concentrations and at high effect levels. S is positive for mostly synergistic combinations and negative for antagonism. In cases where both syn rgy and antagonism are present at different concentrations, the weighting favors effects at high inhibition levels. An uncertainty CTS is calculated for each synergy score, based on the measured errors for the Idata values and standard error propagation. The synergy score was used and its error to define an appropriate selection cutoff. For example, combinations with S &gt; 2_S are significant at ~95% confidence, assummg a normal distribution. Also, to ensure a sufficient potency shift, the combination index, CI = (CX/ECX) + (CY/ECY) at a chosen effect level is small enough to represent a useful synergy. Observed in vitro CI measurements for currently used clinical combinations (CI ~ 0.5-0.7) can be used as a guide in setting the cutoff<br><br><br>
