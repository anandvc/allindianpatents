BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Millimeter wave oscillators in millimeter-wave integrated circuits, herein after referred to as MIC, offer advantages in terms of small size and ease of integration with other planar circuits. But the limitation of such devices is that they have not been completely successful. Since an oscillator forms an essential part of a millimeter wave receiver front end, its development leading to simplicity of fabrication with minimum dimensions and size thereof, and lower circuit losses while retaining the advantages of the MIC form of fabrication is of considerable importance.<br>
The mechanically tunable milimeter wave oscillators known in the prior art generally comprise of microstrip configuration. The oscillators in microstrip configuration, as known in the prior art are expensive and have higher circuit losses.<br>
Oscillators for applications not requiring electronic tuning, an arrangement of microstrip oscillator employing evanescent mode resonator offers cost effective solution.<br>
The drawback of such an arrangement as known in the prior art, is that, the diode is mounted in the evanescent mode guide and biasing the diode requires bonding of a wire to the anode, which complicates the fabrication. It is well known in the art, that in the millimeter wave band, the microstrip tends to be excessively lossy.<br>
The oscillators employing rectangular waveguide are generally difficult to fabricate and uneconomical for commercialisation.<br>
Further disadvantage of such arrangements is that, the waveguide adds to the size and weight of the device.<br>
NEED OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Therefore, there is a need to have an oscillator, particularly a Gunn diode oscillator which can overcome the limitations and disadvantages of the oscillators known in the prior art for the said purpose.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION :<br>
This is the main object of the present invention to propose for an oscillator, particularly a Gunn diode oscillator, which can overcome the limitations and drawbacks, as described herein above, of such oscillators as known in the prior art.<br>
This is further an object of the present invention to propose for a Gunn diode oscillator, which comprises of simple configuration, particularly single pattern only on one side of the substrate.<br>
This is still an object of the present invention to propose for a Gunn diode oscillator, which does not comprise of any additional components in-addition to the minimum existing components.<br>
Still further an object of the present invention to propose for a Gunn diode oscillator, which can be conveniently fabricated at the most economical price for commercial purpose.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to make a complete disclosure of a Gunn diode oscillator, which can provide dual advantages of low loss property and of inductive property providing for mechanical tuning.<br>
Further an object of the present invention is to provide a Gunn diode oscillator, which does not comprise of any electronically tunable component but comprises of the mechanically tunable component.<br>

The Gunn diode circuit (1) has three ends (4,5,6) and three arms (8,9,10). The arm 9 joins the arms 8 and 10 forming the junction 7 and the Gunn diode oscillator circuit (1) thus obtained is of L shape.<br>
In accordance to the preferred embodiment of this invention, the arm 9 employs the low pass filter 11 printed as part of the suspended stripline circuit, and arm 8 employs the suspended stripline 12. The end 4 is provided with the short inductive line 13 in the suspended stripline 12. The short inductive line 13 is provided with a Gunn diode 14: which is shunt mounted through the upper block of the housing (explained below) [figure-2a]. The end 4 terminates into the evanescent mode waveguide 15. A tuning screw 16<br>
referred to as additional screw, is provided through a hole 26 (figure-2b) in the lower block (17b) of the housing (explained below) [figure-2b]. The additional screw 16 is provided in the evanescent guide section to facilitate the tuning, hence referred to as tunning screw. The evanescent guide section comprises of parts 15, 29a, 29b and 26.<br>
In accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the end 5 is easily provided with a dc bias through the low pass filter 11 printed as part of the suspended stripline circuit. The suspended stripline circuit comprises of parts 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 4 and 5. The end 6, referred to as third end serves as output end. In accordance to the preferred embodiment of this invention, the output can be obtained from the said third end 6 either through a coaxial connector or through a rectangular waveguide (not shown in the figure). The extended part 6a of the end 6 acts as a output probe, when the output has to be drawn through a rectangular waveguide. Such an end 6a is absent when the output has to be drawn through a coaxial connector.<br>
In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of this invention the arm 8 is longer than arm 9, which inturn is longer than the arm 10. However, the present invention is not restricted by relative length of the arms 8, 9 and 10.<br>
The housing comprises of two blocks, one upper 17a (figure-2a) and one lower 17b (figure-2b) each having a surface 18. (The marks 'a1 and b' are used to indicate the same components of both the blocks. The mark "a1 is for upper block 17a and mark 'b1 is for lower block 17b. The parts of the housing are referred to as upper and lower blocks merely for the convenience of understanding and such markings are not intended to restrict the scope of the invention.) Each block (17a/17b) is provided with a channel (19a/19b) having three ends 20a/20b, 21 a/21 b and 22a/22b, and three arms 20a720b', 21a721b' and 22a722b' in the similar configuration as that of the Gunn diode oscillator circuit (1).

In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of this invention, the channel 23a/23b extends upto the edges of the blocks 17a/17b. Through one end of the channel 23a/23b a moving shorting plunger is connected and through another end the oscillator power output is taken, when the output is drawn through a waveguide, as described herein above. The 'one end' and the 'another end', as referred herein above can be any end of the channel 23a/23b. When the output is drawn through a coaxial connector, then the central pin of the coaxial connector (not shown in figure) is directly connected to the end 6 of the arm 10. Under such conditions the extended end 6a is absent, as described herein above and the channel 23a/23b does not exist.<br>
The end 21 a/21 b extends upto the edge of the blocks17a/17b. The end 20a/20b ends before the edge of the blocks 17a/17b. The arms 20a720b' and 21a'/21b'of the channel 19a/19b form a junction 24a/24b. The channel 19a of the upper block (17a) is provided with a hole 25a to insert the Gunn diode 14, which in-turn sits onto the short inductive line 13 of the suspended stripline 12. In accordance to this invention the hole 25a is provided towards the end 20a and it aligns with the part 13 of the Gunn diode oscillator circuit (1). The Gunn dioide 14 is inserted, through a hole 25a provided in the said upper block 17a of the housing with the help of a screw, referred to as diode mounting screw 14a (shown in the figure-2c). A dielectric screw 14b (shown in the figure-2c) is inserted from opposite side to the Gunn diode 14, through a hole 25b provided in the said lower block 17b of the housing, to enable firm contact of the short inductive line 13 with the Gunn diode 14. The side of the Gunn diode 14, which makes contact with the inductive line 13 acts as anode and the opposite side of the Gunn diode 14 acts as cathode.<br>
The channel 19b of the lower block (17b) is provided with a hole 26 to accommodate the tuning screw 16 in the evanescent guide 15. The channel 19b of the lower block (17b) is provided with an under cut 28 to accommodate the substrate carrying the oscillator pattern, referred to as Gunn diode oscillator circuit (1). In accordance to the preferred embodiment of this invention the part 29a/29b of the channel 19a/19b forms the evanescent mode waveguide 15.<br>
