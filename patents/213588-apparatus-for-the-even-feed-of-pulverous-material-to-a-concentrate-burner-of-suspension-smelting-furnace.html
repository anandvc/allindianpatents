EQUIPMENT FOR THE EVEN FEEP OF PULVEROUS MATERIAL TO A CONCENTRATE BURNER OF SUSPENSION SMELTING FURNACE<br>
OUTOKUMPU OYJ<br>
of Rllhltontuntle 7, FIN 42200 Espoo, Finland<br>
a Finnish Public Limited Company<br><br>
TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br>
THE  FOLLOWING  SPECIFICATION  PARTICULARLY  DESCRIBES AND ASCERTAINS  THE  NATURE OF THIS  INVENTION AND  THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS<br><br>
APPARATUS  FOR THE EVEN FEED OF PULVEROUS MATERIAL TO A CONCENTRATE BURNER OF SUSPENSION SMELTING FURNACE<br>
This invention relates to equipment for the feed of pulverous material to a i concentrate burner of a suspension smelting furnace, which enables the feed of solid finely divided material into the furnace to be distributed evenly in the concentrate burner. According to the invention, a vibrating feeder is located between the raw material conveyor and the actual burner, and the concentrate burner feed pipes are equipped with blades for dividing the material.<br>
In a suspension-smelting furnace, the feed of pulverous  material such as concentrate, flux and flue dust takes place via the concentrate burner situated on top of the reaction shaft of the furnace. For the sake of simplicity, the term concentrate will be used hereafter in the text to mean all the pulverous material fed into the furnace via the concentrate burner. It is extremely important for the successful operation of the concentrate burner that the concentrate and the process air are mixed evenly as they are discharged from the burner into the reaction space i.e. the upper section of the reaction shaft of the suspension smelting furnace. If this is not the case, the result is on the one hand an area of under-reacted  concentrate  where  the   concentrate   is   above  the  targeted process-air/concentrate ratio and, on the other hand, an area of over-reacted concentrate   where   the   concentrate   is   below   the   targeted    process-air/ concentrate ratio, whereby a large amount of magnetite is produced as from the reactions. Magnetite is slow to dissolve and impairs the quality of the slag produced so that it raises the viscosity of said slag, and the high viscosity in turn slows down the separation of matte and slag in the lower furnace.<br>
Poor concentrate distribution also has a clear effect on the temperature profile of the reaction shaft: hot areas are generated in the furnace, where the autogenic lining formed by the concentrate and protecting the reaction shaft, undergoes great thermal stress and the result, in the worst case scenario, may<br>
2<br><br>
lead to the destruction of the reaction shaft wall. There have also been indications that dust formation is more marked when the burner does not function well due to poor concentrate distribution.<br>
5 In currently used solutions, the concentrate is brought to the concentrate burner from the concentrate feed silo mainly by redler or scraper conveyor, from where the raw material flow for discharge is taken first to the concentrate burner hopper and from there along the concentrate feed pipes to the actual concentrate burner itself. The equipment is constructed in accordance with the<br>
10 spaces being used, so the conveyor and concentrate pipes may be at a 90Â° angle to each other, whereby in changing the direction of flow in the concentrate burner hopper, the concentrate, which is in a slightly fluidized state, behaves like a liquid, and the flow and especially the distribution of the concentrate in the cross-sectional area of the concentrate pipe is uneven,<br>
15   further weakening the distribution of the concentrate in the burner.<br>
In most cases the concentrate is taken to the concentrate burner using two separate concentrate conveyors. In these cases the concentrate distribution to the burner is dependent on the sychronization of the conveyors. Long-term 20 operation with only one conveyor causes similar problems as above as the concentrate is distributed unevenly in the concentrate feed pipes.<br>
An equipment for the evening out of pulverous material feed to a concentrate burner of a suspension smelting furnace has now been developed to solve the<br>
25 problems described above. The raw material flow discharging from the concentrate conveyor is fed to a short vibrating feeder just before the actual burner, where the frequency of said feeder is adjusted so that the concentrate is slightly packed down in the feeder, and is therefore distributed evenly along the horizontal surface of the feeder. It is preferable to equip the concentrate<br>
30   feed pipes, which feed the raw material from the vibrating feeder to the<br>
3<br><br>
concentrate burner, with partitions. The essential features of the invention will be made apparent in the attached patent claims.<br>
The vibrating feeder belonging to the concentrate burner feed equipment is<br>
5   located in relation to the actual concentrate burner so that the flow of<br>
concentrate coming from the feeder is perpendicular to the vertical axis of the<br>
burner, whereby the concentrate flow can be distributed evenly after the feeder<br>
.in the desired amount. Although changing the direction of the concentrate flow<br>
was considered a drawback above, in this case it is not, as the concentrate<br>
10   pipes positioned after the vibrating feeder are equipped with partitions, which<br>
divide the concentrate evenly over the whole cross-sectional area of the pipes.<br>
The divide is further ensured by making small spreaders in the feeder, which<br>
improve the exact dispersion in certain points. The concentrate distribution<br>
achieved by the vibrating feeder is preserved by dividing the feed pipes from<br>
15   the vibrating feeder to the concentrate burner with partitions, or blades.<br>
The feed equipment according to the present invention as described above works excellently in the case of a single feeder, evening out the flow of concentrate over both time and place. If, however, the arrangement includes 20 two concentrate conveyors and it is wished to operate them asynchronously, the result is once again an uneven distribution of raw material. This situation can be resolved in two ways, depending on whether asynchronous feeding is a regular or rare occurrence.<br>
25 If an asynchronous feed is desired or obliged to be used on a fairly regular basis, it is preferable to divide both sides of the concentrate intake area of the concentrate burner itself into four segments so that material enters the four segments of the annular discharge channel evenly distributed.<br>
30 The realization of the equipment modification detailed above in older bumer types, however, requires substantial changes. Therefore, in old concentrate<br>
4<br><br>
burners and in cases where operation with one feeder occurs rarely, it is easier to stop the process and to furnish the concentrate burner feed pipes and the discharge channel with extra blades on the inside, to divide the feed coming from one side only into four sections. The blades are designed so that they 5 can be used in reverse, regardless of which of the two concentrate feeders is in operation.<br>
The equipment arrangement according to the present invention is described further with the attached drawings, where<br>
10   Figure 1 shows a basic diagram of a suspension smelting furnace and its feed equipment.<br>
Figure 2 is a vertical section of the feed equipment of a concentrate burner according to the present invention, . Figures 3A and 3B are a side view and cross-section of a certain arrangement<br>
15   of concentrate feed pipes and discharge channel,<br>
Figures 4A and 4B are a side view and cross-section of another alternative, and in Figures 5A, 5B and 5C Figure A is a vertical section, B is a side view of different points of concentrate feed pipes and a discharge channel and C is the corresponding  cross-section  of one alternative  according to the present<br>
20   invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a flash-smelting furnace 1, into which pulverous solid material is fed via a concentrate burner 2. The concentrate is transferred from a tank 3 on a conveyor 4 to the upper section of a discharge channel 5, so that the 25 material falls as a continuous flow through said channel 5 to the upper section 7 of reaction shaft 6 of the furnace 1. Reaction gas is routed via gas feed elements 8 around the concentrate channel parallel to the reaction shaft into its upper part.<br>
30   Figure 2 shows in more detail an equipment for the even distribution of concentrate to the burner according to the present invention where the feed of<br>
5<br><br>
both concentrate and reaction gas occurs from two directions. The concentrate is taken by conveyor to the concentrate tanks 3, which are connected at its -lower section to vibrating feeders 9. The vibrating feeders are further equipped with spreaders to ensure the even distribution of the concentrate, but the<br>
5 spreaders are not shown in the drawing. The vibrating feeders in turn are connected to concentrate feed pipes 10, from where the concentrate flows down into the discharge channel 5. A concentrate distributor 11 is located in the centre of the discharge channel. The lower section of a sliding surface 12 is perforated  with  holes through which  air fed  horizontally spreads the<br>
10 concentrate flow upwards. Since the concentrate distributor is known in the prior art, the equipment related to it is not shown in more detail.<br>
The gas feed arrangement 13 for the concentrate burner is also bipartite in its upper section and combines at the base into an annular feed device 14 around<br>
15 the concentrate discharge channel 5. The gas discharges from said arrangement into the upper section 7 of the reaction shaft. The burner is made up in its entirety of the reaction gas feed elements, the concentrate feed elements and centrally located concentrate distributor, and if required, extra fuel and/or extra gas feed elements can be placed inside the concentrate<br>
20   distributor.<br>
Figures 3A and 3B present one way in which the concentrate feed may be<br>
evened out, by furnishing the concentrate feed pipes with partitions, when the<br>
concentrate feed comes from two feed pipes 10 in opposing directions, into<br>
25   discharge channel 5. The feed pipes are furnished with a partition 15, which<br>
divides the pipes essentially into two equally large channels 16. The partitions<br>
inside the discharge channel extend as far as concentrate distributor 11.<br>
Partitions,   or  blades   17,  are  also  made  in  the  discharge channel  5,<br>
perpendicularly to the feed pipe partitions. Thus the flow of concentrate is<br>
30   divided into the furnace through four segments 18, symmetrical to each other.<br><br><br>
Where required, the segments, or sectors, may be of different sizes in relation to each other.<br>
Figures 4A and 4B present a feed arrangement where the concentrate feed 5 comes from only one feed pipe. In this case the feed pipe 10 is also divided with a partition 15 extending to the concentrate distributor. 11. The discharge channel 5 is additionally divided by blades 19 also into four segments up to the concentrate burner which blades are in more or less the same direction with the feed pipe partition 15. Of these four segments, the innermost segments 20 10 (seen from the concentrate flow) are smaller in cross-section than the outermost segments 21. In addition, the unused feed pipe partition functions as a continuous partition between the segments. Should there be no second feed pipe, the rear of the discharge channel (seen from the concentrate flow) is divided into two by a plate in the same direction as the feed pipe partition 15. 15 Differently sized segments may cause a certain degree of unevenness in the feed distribution, but this solution is generally intended to be a temporary one, and in any case, it offers a better result than the previously used, undivided discharge channel.<br>
20 Figures 5A, 5B and 5C show another alternative according to the present invention, where the concentrate pipes 10 are divided with several partitions. The central partitions 15 are positioned radially in the discharge channel to divide the concentrate pipes and the discharge channel into two sectors as in the earlier solutions. In this case, the outer partitions 22 of the concentrate<br>
25 pipes are basically parallel to the central partition 15. The blades 23 inside the discharge channel are also mainly parallel to the outer partitions of the concentrate pipes but do not extend to the concentrate distributor 11. They are positioned between the wall of the discharge channel and the concentrate distributor. It is evident that the shape of the blades can be modified somewhat<br>
30   without altering the idea of the invention.<br><br><br>
