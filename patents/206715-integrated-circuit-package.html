				<td>Integrated.Circuit Package<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to integrated circuits and in particular the present invention relates to integrated circuit packaging.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Integrated circuits (IC's) are made up of electronic components linked together by conductive connections to form one or more functional circuits. IC's are typically formed in a piece of silicon called a chip or die. Silicon dice can be formed in a wafer that is a sheet of silicon with a surface that is subject to a series of fabrication steps to form a pattern of identical IC's, The IC's are separated from each other by a repeating pattern of scribe lines, also called saw lines, in the surface of the wafer that serve as boundaries between the dice. One IC is formed in each die. At a stage in a fabrication process the dice are diced (cut apart) from the wafer along the scribe lines and each die is bonded to a substrate to form an IC package.<br>
A substrate is a relatively flat and rigid structure that provides mechanical support for the die in the IC package, transmits signals to and from the IC, and can also transfer heat that is generated during the operation of the IC. The substrate may also be called a carrier. The substrate includes conductive leads connected to respective bonding pads on the die so that the IC may exchange signals with other circuits in the IC package and circuits connected to the IC package. Additional elements such as resistors and capacitors that are not readilyincluded in the IC may be attached to the top or bottom of the IC package. The IC package may be applied to a circuit board assembly that comprises systems of interconnected IC packages to form an electronic device such as a computer or a cellular phone.<br>
One method of bonding a die to a substrate in an IC package is called a flip-chip bonding method. One version of  the flip-chip bonding method is formally known as the controlled collapse chip connection or C4 method. In the flip-chip bonding method, solder bumps are placed on bonding pads on the dice<br><br>
while they are connected together in the wafer. The wafer is then diced to separate the dice. Each die is then turned over, or flipped, and aligned with a corresponding pattern of bonding pads or solder bumps on a substrate. A second reflow procedure is carried out to join the bumps to form a series of solder columns between the die and the substrate. The solder columns serve as conductive connections or leads between an IC in the die and the substrate through which I/O signals are transmitted, and power is delivered<br>
As microelectronic products move toward greater levels of integration, increasing functionality, and enhanced performance, the complexity of packaging technology grows in direct proportion. For example, the evolution of silicon processes into finer and finer feature sizes has resulted in microprocessor designs that are capable of achieving higher system clock speed and faster rise times.<br>
As a result, the level of integration and the density of interconnects between integrated circuits, such as processor chips, and substrates has been increased tremendously. Thus, coupling the integrated circuits to a substrate for electrical and physical connectivity to external devices provides increased challenges as the interconnect density increases.<br>
For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a need in the art for new substrate technologies with enhanced interconnect density.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific preferred embodiments in which the inventions may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it<br>
- 3B -<br><br>
is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the claims.<br>
A simplified perspective view of an integrated circuit package 100 is provided in Figure 1. The package includes at least one integrated circuit die 102 and a substrate 104. The substrate includes numerous conductive pins 106 that downwardly extend from the substrate and are provided for electrical connection to an external device. The illustrated package includes beneficial features that are explained in greater detail below. Specifically, interconnect pins as described herein provide for increased conductor routing space when compared to packages that have interconnect pins inserted into a substrate. A partial cross section of an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Figure 2. The substrate 104 includes a plurality of layers that together form a common structure. In one embodiment, the substrate includes an organic base dielectric layer 110.   On top of the base dielectric layer is a layer of conductor material 112, such as copper. Conductor layer 112 is covered with a first internal layer of dielectric material 114. A second conductive layer 116 is provided on top of the first internal layer of dielectric material 114. A second internal layer of dielectric material 118, fabricated on top of second conductive layer 116, is covered by a third conductive layer 120. The third conductive layer can be an external layer that is covered with a solder mask 122 to control the placement of solder. The same conductor-dielectric-conductor-dielectric. conductor is provided on the bottom of base dielectric layer 110.<br>
The conductive layers are patterned to form conductive traces, or paths. Interconnecting the multiple layers of conductors through the base dielectric layer is accomplished through plated through holes (PTH) 124. The plated thr ugh holes in one embodiment are formed using either a drill or a laser to cut a holes through the base layer and the first conductor and dielectric layers. The holes are   'ated with a conductor when second conductive layer 116 is formed. Additional plated vias 126 can be provided between the first, second and third<br>
4<br><br>
conductive layers. Both the PTH's and the vias are used to ease package conductor routing.<br>
Traditionally, photo-lithography could be utilized to make vias in the substrates. The use of photo-lithography process brings two disadvantages that can eventually prevent the formation of high density interconnects in the substrate. First, is the limitation in the via size. Commercially available photosensitive materials have limited resolution when it comes to smaller via sizes. Second, is the limitations with photosensitive materials with respect to a combination of mechanical properties, moisture absorption, and dielectric constant. In the present invention, laser cut vias are used to overcome limitations of prior techniques.<br>
Laser technology can create via sizes down to diameters of 10 µm, or smaller. In contrast, photo-lithography materials can be limited to 50-60 µm vias. Furthermore, laser technology can make skip vias formation possible. Skip vias are used to connect two conductive layers that are separated by a third layer, as illustrated in Figure 4. Skip via 174 connects conductive layers 112 and 120 while skiping intermediate conductive layer 116. Layer 116 has a clearance region formed in the location of the skip via to prevent electrical contact between the layer and the via. As such, skip vias can be used to relieve routing density, save real estate, and alleviate loop inductance. In addition, non-photo sensitive dielectric materials can be added to'the selection of dielectric material candidates, several dielectric materials can be used that are commercially available at lower cost than dielectric materials used in packages using photolithography processes.<br>
During fabrication, first conductive layers 112 are formed on base dielectric layer 110. This fabrication process can be conducted by a supplier. As such, the base dielectric layer can be provided with the conductive layers pre-attached. The first conductive layers are patterned to form desired interconnects, or traces. First internal dielectric layers 114 are then formed on the pattered first conductors. Vias are then formed for plated through holes 124. These vias can be formed by either mechanical drilling or laser cutting. Second conductive layers 116 are then formed on each side of the substrate. These layers coat the interior surface of the vias to form conductive paths through the substrate. The<br>
5<br><br>
plated vias have an interior core that is then filled with epoxy, or other similar material. The fill material can be either insulating or conducting in nature. A second coating of conductor-material is build up on the second conductive layer. That is, a second deposition process is provided to increase the thickness of the second conductor layer and cover the ends of the plated through holes. Covering the ends of the plated through holes allows for secondary vias 126, as explained below. The second conductive layers are then patterned to form selected traces. Second insulating layers 118 are then formed on the second conductive layer, and third conductive layers 120 are formed. Small vias 126 are cut through the second insulating layer and third conductive layer using a laser to expose the second conductive layer. Likewise, the vias can be cut to expose the underlying first conductive layer. See Figure 3, illustrating via 170 formed in a stacked manner with via 126, and a via 172 located between the first and second conductive layers. A secondary plating operation is used to coat the vias and form conductive paths. The third conductive layer is then patterned.<br>
Covering the ends of the plated through holes allows for the secondary vias to be placed substantially in line with the plated through holes. By stacking the vias in this manner, routing congestion can be reduced.<br>
The above described 'dielectric-conductor sandwich' is one embodiment of a substrate, other layered substrates are contemplated. For example, a substrate can be provided that is not symmetrical about the base dielectric layer.<br>
In one embodiment, base dielectric layer 110 is comprised of a glass reinforced material. The first and second intermediate dielectric layers can comprise two epoxy resin build-up layers.<br>
Conductive interconnect pins 130 are affixed to a bottom 132 of substrate 104. As illustrated, the pins are T-shaped and have a flat head 134. The pins are affixed, in one embodiment, to the third conductive layer 120 using a solder material. In one embodiment, the solder is comprised of a PbSn alloy. The solder, however, can be a different alloy, such as but not limited to a PbSn, AgSn or SbSn alloy. This configuration is different from more traditional pin attachment techniques. For example, ceramic substrates have been provided that have pins brazed to the substrate. Further, typical organic multilayered substrates use holes drilled into the substrates that receive pins. That is, the pins<br>
6<br><br>
are inserted into the holes and attached to a conductive layer(s). The present substrate differs in that an organic substrate is provided that has multiple layers of conductors and has pins soldered to an exterior conductive layer. As noted above, the interconnect pins described herein provide for increased conductor routing space when compared to packages that have interconnect pins inserted into a substrate.<br>
In another embodiment, SnAg eutectic solder can be used for the pin joint. In yet another embodiment, it was determined through research that a SnSb solder can be selected.<br>
In addition to the above described features, decoupling capacitors 150 can be added to pads provided on exterior conductive layer 120 (electrical connections of the capacitor is not shown in Figure 2). The capacitors are located between the connector pins to provide transient charge protection to the integrated circuit. Traditional packages do not place capacitors on the pin side of the substrate. However, by providing pads for the mounting of the pins, solder pads can also be provided for capacitors or other components on the pin side of the package.<br>
As described above, an integrated circuit die 102 is attached to the top of substrate 104 using a flip-chip process. This die can be any type of circuit, but in one embodiment is a microprocessor circuit. As known to those skilled in the art, the die is turned over, or flipped, and aligned with a pattern of bonding pads or solder bumps on a substrate. A reflow procedure is carried out to join solder bumps provided on the die to form a series of solder columns between the die and the substrate. The solder columns serve as conductive connections or leads between an IC in the die and the substrate through which I/O signals are transmitted.<br>
Conclusion<br>
An integrated circuit package is provided that includes a multi-layer organic substrate. The substrate has conductive vias provided between isolated conductive layers. The vias are formed using a laser to cut through a dielectric layer separating the conductive layers and a mechanical drill to connect the inner core layers. External interconnects in the form of T-shaped pins are soldered to<br>
7<br><br>
the substrate of the integrated circuit package. An integrated circuit can be attached to the substrate using a flip-chip technique.<br>
Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement which is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiment shown. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the present invention. Therefore, it is manifestly intended that this invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof.<br>
