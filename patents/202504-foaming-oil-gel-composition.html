				<td>FOAMING OIL GEL COMPOSITIONS	<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to gelled oil skin cleansing compositions, and to uses thereof. These compositions are not only effective, foaming cleansers, but they also leave a light, moisturizing feel to the skin after rinsing.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Cleansing the skin results, irrespective of the surfactants added, in swelling of the horny layers, with water-soluble constituents of dirt being washed off and substances endogenous to the skin being washed out. During this process, naturally occurring skin fats are also dissolved and removed, making it necessary to replenish the skin with these or subsidiary protective factors.<br>
For this purpose, oil preparations are used as bath or shower preparations in the art. Typically, these preparations are provided as single-phase systems which, on contact with water, form an emulsion or a full solutilizate as opposed to dividing out into two phases. As a result of the formation of an emulsion, the skin is, during the cleansing operation, better cared for with the preferred oils than in two-phase systems.<br>
Surfactant -containing oil preparations for use as cosmetic or dermatological shower oils are well-known in the art. For example, DE 4424210 C2 uses a composition containing at most 55 percent of surfactants comprised of various anionic and nonionic surfactants as well as at least 45percent of a selection of oil components, with triglycerides being particularly preferred.<br>
DE 19835239.5 also provides for a single-phase foaming oil composition that is non-irritative to the skin, mucosa, and eyes comprised of an anionic surfactant, a zwitterionic surfactant, or mixture thereof; a nonionic surfactant; an alkyl phosphate; and an oil component wherein the proportion of surfactant is from 15 percent to 50 percent and that of the oil component is from 50 percent to 85 percent.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,707,293, which uses a composition consisting essentially of a) an animal, vegetable, mineral or synthetic oil; and b) from 2 percent to 20 percent of a mixture of a saccharose ester and at least one other emulsifying agent, claims to provide an effective cleanser that also leaves a protecting lipid layer on the skin.<br>
-1A-<br><br>
Disadvantageously, many of the known surfactant-containing preparations often produce little to no foam, fail to leave a perceived amount of moisturizing residue on the skin, and/or are not significantly stable in a gelled form, a preferred mode of use for users of these products.<br>
When formulating an oil preparation, particular care should be taken when it is used by people who suffer from diseases such as atopic eczema as well as those people whose skin requires special care, thus, for example, as a result of damage caused by the environment, irritation, light damage, and aging skin.<br>
It would be desirable to have an effective, non-irritating cleansing composition that not only was stable in the preferred get form, but also, after rinsing, left a non-greasy, moisturizing residue on the skin.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
fn accordance with this invention, there is provided a gelled detergent composition comprising:<br>
a)	a surfactant portion comprising at least one ionic surfactant;<br>
b)	an oil;<br>
c)	a gelling agent; and<br>
d)	a nonionic emulsifier.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method for producing a gelled detergent composition comprising:<br>
a)	combining a gelling agent with a nonionic emulsifier to form a first mixture;<br>
b)	adding a surfactant to the first mixture to form a second mixture;<br>
c)	adding the second mixture to a third mixture comprised of an oil.<br>
When the gelled composition of the present invention is applied to the skin in the presence of water, the composition produces a cleansing foam. When the product is rinsed off of the skin, a light oil residue remains on the skin, which provides the user with a moisturized "after-feel"<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The above and other aspects and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, as<br>

The gelled composition of this invention are multi-phased, regardless of whether or not not water is incorporated, and preferably has a viscosity of from about 50,000 cps to about 150,000 cps, and preferably from about 60,000 cps to about 100,000 cps..<br>
The composition of this invention may be applied to the desired area in the form of, for example, a lotion, cream, gel, soap, bath, mousse, tonic, or the like which is designed to be rinsed off within a given amount of time after application. Preferably, the gelled composition may be used to prepare a foaming oil preparation suitable for use in, for<br>
19<br><br><br>
example, an oil bath, a shower preparation, a face-cleansing fluid, a make-up remover, or a body wash.<br>
The composition of the present invention may be directly applied to the skin for cleansing, or preferably may be applied to the skin via a cleansing implement. Examples of suitable cleansing implements nonexclusively include brushes, sponges, foams, cloths, and poufe, with poufs being most preferred. Examples of suitable pouts are disclosed in, for example United States Patent No.: 5,804,539, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As the composition is applied to the skin, either with or without the aid of a cleansing implement, the oil component becomes emulsified and forms small droplets on the skin, while the surfactant simultaneously generates a significant amount of foam for cleansing. After the composition is rinsed-off, the user is left with a moisturized feeling on the skin that is less greasy than other known moisturizing cleansing products.<br>
We have surprisingly found that the composition of the present invention advantageously offers the benefit of an oil treatment bath during the time that it takes the user to shower. In addition, the composition also advantageously deposits moisturizers to the skin during showering, which obviates the need for the user to apply a post-bathing moisturizer to the skin. Additionally, the composition is also effective in treating the symptoms of dry skin often associated with atopic dermatitis, xerosis, psoriatsis, winter itch, and other skin dermatoses.<br>
The invention iliustratively disclosed herein suitably may be practiced in trie, absence of any component, ingredient, or step which is not specifically disclosed herein Several examples are set form below to further illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of carrying it out. However, the invention should not be considered as being limited to the details thereof<br>

The formulations of Examples 1 through 5 were made as follows: Isopropyt palmitate was charged to a vessel. To this was added laureth-3 with mixing at room temperature. Empigen BS-98 was then added slowly with continuous mixing until a homogeneous slurry was formed. The resultant slurry was added slowly with continued agitation to the Geahlene contained in a second vessel until the slurry was uniformly dispersed in the Geahlene.<br>
Example 6: Evaluation of Foam Generation and "After Feel"<br>
The formulations of Examples 1 through 5 were prepared in accordance with the procedure set forth in Examples 1 ~ 5, and then were evaluated for foam generation and skin feel after washing ("after-feel") as follows:<br>
After about 5 ml of each respective formulation was dispensed into wet hands, the hands were then rubbed together for about 10 seconds and the volume of foam generated was qualitatively observed and recorded. The formulation was then rinsed from the hands, then the hands were patted dry with a paper towel. The hands were then qualitatively<br>
21<br><br>
assessed for perceived residue left on the skin and the perceived "after feel" of the resultant moisturization residue. Results of these evaluations are summarized in Table B below:<br>

This Example showed that as the surfactant level in the formulation product increased, the user's perception of greasiness/residue decreased, the amount and quality of the foam increased, and the viscosity of the product increased. This Example showed that an effective foaming cleanser with acceptable "after-feel" may be prepared by using a surfactant in an amount of, based upon the total weight of the composition, from about 10 percent to about 20 percent, and more preferably, from about 15 percent to about 20 percent.<br>

These Examples further showed that as the amount of surfactant in the formulation was increased, the perceived level of residue on the skin was decreased while the amount of foam generated was increased.<br>
These Examples further showed that the formulations containing sulfosuccinates, preferably in amounts less than about 15 weight percent, produced an acceptable amount of foam that is comparable to the amount of foam produced by the commercial body wash. However, unlike the commercial bodywash, only the formulations of the present invention were able to produce an acceptable amount of foam as well as leave an aesthetically acceptable perceived residue on the skin.<br>
Examples 45 -48: Fourier Transmittance Infrared Spectroscopy<br>
After the forearms of 10 adults between the ages of about 25 to about 60 years were washed with a commercial soap then dried, a baseline spectrum of these forearms was obtained on a Nieolet model AVATAR 380 FTIR spectometer with the Spectra-Tech Skin Analyzers ATR accessory.<br>
After moistening a forearm of each participant with warm water having a temperature of approximately 38 oC approximately 10.00 ml (10 g) of a formulation was applied to a pouf. The following formulations were used independently; Example 7, Example 14, Example 17, and the formulation of "Eucerin Shower Therapy" wash commercially available from Biersdorf Inc., under the tradename, "EUCERIN.". For each participant, this formulation was then applied to one forearm via the pouf. This procedure was repeated on the other forearm of each respective participant, but using a different formulation applied on another pouf.<br>
The respective areas were washed with the pouf/formulation combination for about one minute, then rinsed for about 30 seconds under gently running water. After the arms were rinsed and dried at room temperature for about 5 minutes, subsequent FTIR readings were obtained throughout the day starting at 5 minutes after drying, then at 1 hour intervals until 8 hours after rinsing.<br>
The waveiength of 1460 cm-1 at which mineral oil characteristically absorbs radiation, was monitored for all formulations. Where other oils are contained in the formulation, different waveiength bands, which correspond to the oil of interest, could alternatively be used. The amount of radiation absorbed at that wavelength was recorded for each formulation at each test interval. The results of the FTIR readings, which are shown in FIG. 1, disclosed that the formulations of Example 7 (Example 45), Example 14 (Example 47), and Example 17 (Example 46) left a measurable amount of mineral oil on the skin up to 8 hours after rinsing, which is comparable to the commercial Eucerin product<br>
27<br><br>
(Example 48) that claims to restore moisture to the skin as it cleanses. Because the presence of residue left on the skin is an indication of moisturization, this Example further shows that the formulations of the present invention are not only effective cleansers but are also effective in depositing moisturizers, such as mineral oil, to the skin.<br>
