A method of separating an olefin from a gas stream<br>
Held of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of separating an olefin from a gas stream, said gas stream comprising the olefin and at least one other component, said method comprising<br>
(i)      compressing and cooling the gas stream;<br>
(ii)     separating the olefin from the gas stream by absorbing the olefin in an absor-bent;<br>
(iii)     separating the olefin from the absorbent by desorption;<br>
wherein compressing or cooling or compressing and cooling in (i) is carried out at least twice, preferably three times. According to a preferred embodiment of the present in-vention, the olefin is propene. According to another preferred embodiment, the gas stream is an offgas stream from an epoxidation process in which an olefin, preferably propene is reacted with at least one hydroperoxide, preferably hydrogen peroxide to give the olefin oxide, preferably the propene oxide. Therefore, according to a still fur-ther preferred embodiment, the separation process described above is part of a proc-ess, preferably a highly integrated process of producing an olefin oxide.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
It is known that in the oxidation of olefins by means of hydroperoxides to give olefin oxides (oxiranes), the selectivity of olefin oxide formation decreases significantly and the level of undesirable secondary reactions increases as the olefin conversion rises. To be able to achieve a high selectivity of over 95% despite this, these reactions are, especially on an industrial scale, therefore preferably carried out only to an olefin con-version of about 60 - 95%.<br>
Isolating the unreacted olefin from the reaction process and then recirculating it to the oxidation process is also known. Thus, a process in which a gas mixture comprising the olefin and oxygen originating from the decomposition reaction of the hydrogen per-oxide used as hydroperoxide in the oxidation is separated off and the olefin is absorbed from the gas mixture in a liquid absorption medium has been proposed. In this process, a sufficient amount of an inert gas is added to the oxygen to prevent formation of flam-mable gas compositions (EP-B-0 719 768). In a preferred embodiment, this process of EP-B-0 719 768 is used for recovering propene from the reaction of propene with hy-drogen peroxide to give propene oxide. The inert gas used is preferably methane and the liquid absorption medium used is a mixture comprising isopropanol and water.<br>

The present invention relates to a method of separating an olefin from a gas stream, said gas stream comprising the olefin and at least one other component, said method comprising<br>

wherein compressing or cooling or compressing and cooling in (i) is carried out at least twice, preferably three times. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the olefin is propene. According to another preferred embodiment, the gas stream is an offgas stream from an epoxidation process in which an olefin, preferably propene is reacted with at least one hydroperoxide, preferably hydrogen peroxide to give the olefin oxide, preferably the propene oxide. Therefore, according to a still further preferred embodiment, the separation process described above is part of a process, preferably a highly integrated process of producing an olefin oxide.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
It is known that in the oxidation of olefins by means of hydroperoxides to give olefin oxides (oxiranes), the selectivity of olefin oxide formation decreases significantly and the level of undesirable secondary reactions increases as the olefin conversion rises. To be able to achieve a high selectivity of over 95% despite this, these reactions are, especially on an industrial scale, therefore preferably carried out only to an olefin conversion of about 60 - 95%.<br>
Isolating the unreacted olefin from the reaction process and then recirculating it to the oxidation process is also known. Thus, a process in which a gas mixture comprising the olefin and oxygen originating from the decomposition reaction of the hydrogen peroxide used as hydroperoxide in the oxidation is separated off and the olefin is absorbed from the gas mixture in a liquid absorption medium has been proposed. In this process, a sufficient amount of an inert gas is added to the oxygen to prevent formation of flammable gas compositions (EP-B-0 719 768). In a preferred embodiment, this process of EP-B-0 719 768 is used for recovering propene from the reaction of propene with hydrogen peroxide to give propene oxide. The inert gas used is preferably methane and the liquid absorption medium used is a mixture comprising isopropanol and water.<br><br>
Lower hydrocarbons such as heptane and octane and also methanol and acetone can also be used, but less advantageously, in this process. However, a disadvantage of the abovementioned process is that a further gas, in particular methane, in addition to the offgas stream has to be fed into the column used for the absorption. This measure is intended to prevent the formation of explosive mixtures in the gas mixture as a result of the oxygen content. The low solubility of the olefin in water-containing isopropanol is also a disadvantage in this process. For example, based on the description, it is neces-sary to use solvent mixtures which have a water content of from 30.6 mol% to 57.2 mol%. This high water content reduces the solubility of the olefin in the isopropanol. For this reason, relatively large amounts of solvent have to be used in order to be able to recover the olefin from the offgas stream by absorption.<br>
EP-A-0 583 828 discloses a direct-oxidation ethylene oxide process wherein ethylene oxide resulting from the direct oxidation is absorbed and thus separated from the ep-oxidation product stream. As absorption agents, especially suitable are mixtures of C10 to C13 paraffins. Explicitly, dodecane and tridecan are described. Higher paraffins are described as possible but less effective. Although a process is described where a stream comprising an olefin may be compressed, EP-A-0 583 828 is silent on a proc-ess which comprises two subsequent steps, the first step being a compressing step and the second step being a cooling step. Moreover, EP-A-0 583 828 is directed to a process in which, prior to the absorption of etyhlene, carbon dioxide has to be removed from the gas stream, and the compressing step is described as being essential for re-moval of carbon dioxide only.<br>
DE-AS-1 212 507 describes a method for producing alkylene oxides from alkenes such as propene using oxygen containing gases wherein the alkene is separated from a gas mixture by absorption in a hydrocarbon having a high boiling point, e.g. tetradecane. In the context of this document, it is described that a gas stream comprised of oxygen or a gas stream comprising oxygen is used for removing the alkene from the absorbing agent, the resulting gas stream being recirculated to the oxidation process. In the con-text of DE-AS-1 212 507, a process step is described in which a gas stream which, after a washing step, contains propene, nitrogen, carbon oxide and carbonic acid, is divided and one part is compressed and subsequently, without cooling, introduced into an absorber where the gas stream is brought in contact with diesel oil.<br>
US 5,599,955 discloses a method for producing propene oxide wherein, in an epoxida-tion zone, a propene stream is epoxidized using an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solu-tion. An offgas stream resulting from this epoxidation containing unreacted propene i-dried in a drier filled with absorbent, the resulting stream being recirculated to a olefin production zone.<br>
WO 02/102496 A1 describes a method for the recovery of combustible components of a gas stream comprising the combustible components and oxygen by selective absorp-tion of the combustible components in a solvent. As combustible components, propene<br><br>
oxide and propene are mentioned. As suitable solvents, usual organic solvents such as alcohols, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons or ketones are generically disclosed. As preferred solvent, compounds are described the gas stream is derived from prior to the absorption. According to WO 02/102496 A1, the gas stream comprising combustible components is directly introduced into the absorption unit, and neither a step of compressing nor a step of cooling is mentioned.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method for separating an olefin from a gas stream, said gas stream comprising the olefin and at least one other component, by means of which it is possible to achieve a more effective recovery of the olefin from said gas stream than in the process of the prior art.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved process for separating an olefin from a gas stream, said gas stream additionally comprising oxygen, by an absorption process wherein no additional inert gas has to be added to the absorption unit used.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a method of separating an olefin from a gas stream, said gas stream comprising the olefin and at least one other component, said method comprising<br>
(i)      compressing and cooling the gas stream;<br>
(ii)     separating the olefin from the gas stream by absorbing the olefin in an absor-bent;<br>
(iii)     separating the olefin from the absorbent by desorption;<br>
wherein compressing or cooling or compressing and cooling in (i) is carried out at least twice.<br>
Therefore, the gas stream may be compressed twice and cooled once. Therefore, it is possible to compress the gas stream, to cool the compressed gas stream and to com-press the cooled gas stream. It is also possible to compress the gas stream twice and subsequently cool the gas stream. It is also possible to cool the gas stream, compress the cooled gas stream and cool the resulting compressed gas stream. According to a preferred embodiment, compressing and cooling is carried out at least twice. There-fore, according to one embodiment of the present invention, a gas stream comprising the olefin and at least one other component is compressed, the compressed gas stream is cooled, the cooled gas stream is compressed again and the compressed gas stream is cooled again. According to an especially preferred embodiment, compressing and cooling is carried out three times wherein, according to an especially preferred embodiment, after a compressing step, a cooling step is performed.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the gas stream com-prises the olefin and at least one further compound which may be separated from th-olefin by cooling the compressed gas stream. Thus, the gas stream comprising the olefin and said at least one further compound is preferably compressed to a suitable pressure in at least one compressing apparatus and subsequently cooled to a suitable temperature in at least one suitable cooling apparatus wherein, in the at least one suit-able cooling apparatus, at least one of the further compounds is at least partially, pref-erably essentially completely condensed whereas the olefin is only partially condensed. The process according to the present invention is preferably carried out so that at least<br><br>
one of the further compounds is essentially removed from the gas stream by the compressing and cooling steps.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the gas stream introduced in (i) comprises the olefin, at least one alcohol, preferably methanol, and water, the olefin especially preferably being propene. In this case, it is preferred to compress the gas stream, preferably by compressing and cooling twice, even more preferably by compressing and cooling three times, to a preferred final pressure, after the final cool-ing step, in the range of from 2 to 30 bar, more preferably of from 5 to 25 bar, more preferably of from 10 to 20 bar, more preferably of more than 10 bar to 20 bar, more preferably in the range of from 11 to 19 bar, and still more preferably in the range of from 13 to 18 bar.<br>

Cooling can be carried out using customary apparatuses, such as heat exchangers which can have essentially any configuration. Examples of configurations of the heat exchanger are shell-and-tube heat exchangers, coil heat exchangers or plate heat ex-changers. For the purposes of the present invention, preference is given to using a heat exchanger which is configured as a shell-and-tube heat exchanger. As coolant, any conceivable medium can be employed. Preferred coolants are, among others, common river water or secondary coolants such as secondary cooling water.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention where compression is preferably carried out not in one stage but in at least two, more preferably three stages with cooling between the individual compression stages, and still more preferably with additional cooling after the last compression stage, the present process has the advan-tage of the final compression temperature being able to be readily kept within the per-missible range.<br><br>
According to the present invention, it is preferred that of from 30 to 90 wt-%, more preferably from 35 to 85 wt-%, more preferably from 40 to 85 wt.-% and especially preferably from 50 to 80 wt-% of the olefin, preferably propene, comprised in the gas stream are condensed in (i), preferably after at least two compressing and two cooling steps and especially after three compressing steps and three cooling steps.<br>

It is preferred that of from 60 to 100 wt-%, more preferably from 70 to 100 wt-% and especially preferably from 80 to 100 wt-% of the olefin oxide comprised in the gas stream are condensed in (i), preferably after at least two compressing and two cooling steps and especially after three compressing steps and three cooling steps.<br>
The gas stream introduced in (i) may further comprise an alkane corresponding to the olefin. In case the olefin is propene, the corresponding alkane is propane. It is preferred that of from 30 to 90 %, more preferably from 40 to 90 % and especially preferably from 45 to 90 % of the alkane comprised in the gas stream are condensed in (i), preferably after at least two compressing and two cooling steps and especially after three com-pressing steps and three cooling steps.<br>

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least one hydroperoxide is reacted with the olefin. For the purposes of the present patent application, the term "hydroperoxide" refers to a compound of the formula ROOH. Details regarding the preparation of hydroperoxides and regarding hydroperoxides which can be used, inter alia, in the process of the present invention may be found in DE-A-198 35 907.

Most preferably, the aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution comprises hydrogen peroxide in a concentration in the range of from 1 to 90, more preferably of from 10 to 70 and especially preferably of from 30 to 50 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the solution.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process as described above in which the hydroperoxide with which the olefin, more preferably an olefin having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, still more preferaby of from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, most preferably propene is reacted, is hydrogen peroxide.<br>
As to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the alcohol comprised in the gas stream introduced in (i) is methanol. It is also possible that this gas stream addi-<br><br>
tionally comprises at least one further alcohol or, instead of methanol, at least one other alcohol. Therefore, according to the above-mentioned preferred embodiment ac-cording to which the gas stream is an offgas stream resulting from an epoxidation reac-tion, this may be the case if the epxodiation reaction is carried out in a solvent mixture comprising methanol and at least one other alcohol or in a solvent mixture comprising at least one alcohol which is not methanol.<br>

According to an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, the epoxida-tion reaction is carried out in the presence of at least one catalyst, preferably at least one heterogeneous catalyst, still more preferably at least one zeolite catalyst. As far as the at least one zeolite catalyst is concerned, generally no limitations exist. Particularly preferably, a zeolite containing titanium is employed, wherein zeolites known to the person skilled in the art as "titanium silicates" or "titanium silicaiites" (TS) are particu-larly preferred. Such zeolites containing titanium, in particular those having a crystalline structure of the MFI-type as well as ways for producing them are described, for exam-ple, in WO 98/55228, EP-A-0 311 983, or EP-A-0 405 978. The respective content of these documents is hereby incorporated by reference. In addition to Si and Ti, said zeolite materials may contain additional elements, such as aluminum, zirconium, tin, iron, cobalt, nickel, gallium, bor, or small amounts of fluorine. It is possible that the tita-nium of the zeolite is partly or completely replaced by vanadium, zirconium, or niobium, or any mixture of two or more of these components. Zeolites containing titanium and<br><br>
displaying a MFI-structure are known to yield a characteristic pattern in x-ray diffrac-tion. Furthermore, these materials display a vibration band in the infrared (IR) at ap-proximately 960 cm'1. Therefore, it is possible to distinguish the zeolites containing tita-nium from crystalline or amorphous TiO2-phases or from alkaline metal titanates. In a further preferred embodiment, the at least one zeolite catalyst comprises at least one of the elements titanium, germanium, tellurium, vanadium, chromium, niobium, zirconium. Particularly preferred are zeolite catalysts having a pentasil zeolite structure, in particu-lar the structural types that can be, via X-ray diffraction, assigned to the structure types of ABW-, ACO-, AEI-, AEL-, AEN-, AET-, AFG-, AFI-, AFN-, AFO-, AFR-, AFS-, AFT-, AFX-, AFY-, AHT-, ANA-, APC-, APD-, AST-, ATN-, ATO-, ATS-, ATT-, ATV-, AWO-, AWW-, BEA-, BIK-, BOG-, BPH-, BRE-, CAN-, CAS-, CFI-, CGF-, CGS-, CHA-, CHI-, CLO-, CON-, CZP-, DAC-, DDR-, DFO-, DFT-, DOH-, DON-, EAB-, EDI-, EMT-, EPI-, ERI-, ESV-, EUO-, FAU-, FER-, GIS-, GME-, GOO-, HEU-, IFR-, ISV-, ITE-, JBW-, KFI-, LAU-, LEV-, LIO-, LOS-, LOV-, LTA-, LTL-, LTN-, MAZ-, MEI-, MEL-, MEP-, MER-, MFI-, MFS-, MON-, MOR-, MSO-, MTF-, MTN-, MTT-, MTW-, MWW-, NAT-, NES-, NON-, OFF-, OSI-, PAR-, PAU-, PHI-, RHO-, RON-, RSN-, RTE-, RTH-, RUT-, SAO-, SAT-, SBE-, SBS-, SBT-, SFF-, SGT-, SOD-, STF-, STI-, STT-, TER-, THO-, TON-, TSC-, VET-, VFI-, VNI-, VSV-, W1E-, WEN-, YUG-, ZON, as well as mixed struc-tures of at least two or more of the aforementioned structures. Furthermore, it is con-ceivable to use zeolite catalysts containing titanium with the structure of ITQ-4, ITQ-9, SSZ-24, TTM-1, UTD-1, CIT-1 or CIT-5. Furthemore, zeolites containing titanium are such of the structure types ZSM-48 or ZSM-12. Zeolites containing titanium of the structure MFI, MEL or MFI/MEL mixed structures, as well as MWW, BEA or mixed structures thereof are preferred in the context of the present invention. Further pre-ferred in the context of the present invention are these zeolite catalysts containing tita-nium that are referred to, in general, as "TS-1", "TS-2" or "TS-3", as well as zeolites containing titanium displaying a structure that is isomorphous to zeolite beta.<br>
Therefore, the present invention also provides a process wherein the gas stream intro-duced in (i) is an offgas stream resulting from an epoxidation reaction where an olefin, preferably propene, is reacted with a hydroperoxide, preferably hydrogen peroxide, to give the respective olefin oxide, preferably propene oxide, wherein the epoxidation re-action is preferably carried out in at least one solvent, preferably at least one alcohol, more preferably methanol, still more preferably in a solvent comprising at least one alcohol and water, more preferably methanol and water, and wherein the epoxidation reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of at least one catalyst, more prefera-bly at least one heterogeneous catalyst, more preferably at least one zeolite catalyst, and still more preferably a titanium silicalite catalyst.<br>
The term "an offgas stream resulting from a chemical process" or "an offgas stream resulting from a chemical reaction" as used in the context of the present invention re-lates to a gas stream which directly results from said process or reaction or which re-sults from the work-up of a gas stream directly resulting from said process or reaction. This work-up may comprise, e.g., partial or complete separation of at least one com-<br><br>
pound comprised in the gas stream directly resulting from said process or reaction, addition of at least one compound to the gas stream directly resulting from said proc-ess or reaction, or a temperature and/or pressure treatment of the gas stream directly resulting from said process or reaction.<br>
The reaction of the olefin, preferably propene, with the hydroperoxide, preferably hy-drogen peroxide, in the presence of the solvent or solvents, preferably methanol, and the catalyst or catalysts, preferably the above-described titanium silicalite catalyst, can be carried out in one, two or more stages.<br>
A two-stage reaction takes place, for example, as follows:<br>
(a)	the hydroperoxide, preferably the hydrogen peroxide, is reacted with the olefin,<br>
preferably propene, to give a mixture comprising olefin oxide, preferably propyl-<br>
ene oxide, and unreacted hydroperoxide, preferably hydrogen peroxide;<br>
(b)	at least one compound, for example the olefin oxide, preferably propylene ox-<br>
ide, is separated off from the mixture resulting from stage (a);<br>
(c)	reacting the hydroperoxide, preferably the hydrogen peroxide, comprised in the<br>
mixture from which the at least one compound, preferably the olefin oxide, more<br>
preferably the propylene oxide, was separated off in (b), with olefin.<br>
Accordingly, the reaction of the olefin with hydroperoxide takes place, as indicated above, in two stages (a) and (c) between which there is a separation stage (b). The isolation of the at least one compound separated off in (b), preferably propylene oxide, can, for the purposes of the present invention, be carried out using all customary sepa-ration methods of the prior art. The at least one compound is preferably separated off by distillation. Depending on the requirements of the process, it can be separated off in one or more distillation columns. Preference is given to using one distillation column in a separation stage.<br>
The reaction of the olefin, preferably propene, with hydroperoxide, preferably hydrogen peroxide in the process of the present invention takes place in a reactor suitable for this purpose. The starting materials can be introduced individually into the reactor or pref-erably be combined to form a single stream before being fed into the reactor. In the process of the present invention, preference is given to introducing one stream which consists of a combination of the starting materials into the reactor. Here, preference is given to a stream in which the concentrations of the individual starting materials form-ing the stream are selected so that the stream is liquid and consists of a single phase. Starting materials are preferably olefin, solvent and hydroperoxide. In a further, pre-ferred embodiment, it is possible to carry out the reaction in stages (a) and (c) in two separate reactors. As reactors, it is of course possible to use all conceivable reactors which are best-suited to the respective reaction. Here, the term "a reactor" is not re-stricted to a single vessel. Rather, it is also possible to use a cascade of stirred vessels as reactor. Preference is given to using fixed-bed reactors as reactors. The fixed-bed reactors used are more preferably fixed-bed tube reactors. In the case of reactions in<br><br>
two separate reactors in stages (a) and (c), particular preference is given to using one isothermal fixed-bed tube reactor and one adiabatic fixed-bed reactor. Preference is given to using the isothermal fixed-bed tube reactor in stage (a) and the adiabatic fixed-bed reactor in stage (c).<br>
After the reaction of the olefin, preferably propene, with hydroperoxide, preferably hy-drogen peroxide, a mixture is obtained comprising olefin oxide, preferably propene ox-ide, unreacted alkene, preferably propene, and solvent, preferably methanol and water, and optionally alkane, preferably propane. According to a preferred embodiment, unre-acted olefin, preferably propene, is separated off from this mixture. The unreacted ole-fin is preferably separated off from said mixture by distillation. It is in principle possible to use any number of columns for this purpose. Preference is given to using one col-umn. This column generally has 5 or more, preferably 10 or more and more preferably 15 or more theoretical plates. The distillation in this column is preferably carried out at pressures in the range from 0.5 to 25 bar, preferably from 0.7 to 5 bar and particularly preferably in the range from 0.9 to 1.5 bar. In order to obtain better regulation of the distillation, at least one inert gas, preferably nitrogen, is introduced in a preferred amount of up to 5 wt.-%, preferably from 0.01 to 5 wt.-%, more preferably of from 0.05 to 2 wt.-% and especially preferably of from 0.1 to 1 wt.-%, relative to the olefin, pref-erably propene.<br>
According to this preferred embodiment of the present invention, a gas stream is ob-tained comprising olefin, preferably propene, preferably in the range of from 20 to 95 wt.-%, more preferably of from 30 to 94 wt.-% and still more preferably of from 40 to 93 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the gas stream.<br>
Moreover, the gas stream generally comprises 10 wt.~% or less, preferably 7 wt.-% or less and more preferably 5 wt.-% or less of oxygen which originates from the decom-position reaction of the hydroperoxide used, based on the total weight of the gas stream.<br>
Moreover, the gas stream may comprise up to 5 wt.-%, more preferably of from 0.01 to 5 wt.-%, more preferably of from 0.05 to 3 wt.-% and still more preferably of from 0.1 to 2 wt.-% of inert gas, preferably nitrogen, based on the total weight of the gas stream.<br>
Moreover, the amount of propene oxide comprised in the gas steam is so small that it is not detectable.<br>
As further components, the gas stream generally comprises solvent, preferably metha-nol, preferably in the range of up to 15 wt.-%, more preferably of from 0.1 to 15 wt.-%, more preferably of from 0.5 to 10 wt.-% and still more preferably of from 1 to 5 wt.-%, and water preferably in the range of up to 5 wt.-%, more preferably of from 0.01 to 5 wt.-%, more preferably of from 0.05 to 2 wt.-% and still more preferably of from 0.1 to 1 wt.-%, each based on the total weight of the gas stream.<br><br>
Moreover, the gas stream may comprise up to 20 wt.-%, more preferably of from 0.1 to 20 wt-%, more preferably of from 1 to 15 wt.-% and still more preferably of from 2 to 10 wt.-% of alkane, preferably propane, based on the total weight of the gas stream.<br>
This preferably obtained gas stream is introduced in step (i) of the process of the pre-sent invention.<br>
After step (i), most perferably after partial step (c2), a cooled gas stream is obtained comprising olefin, preferably propene, preferably in the range of from 20 to 95 wt.-%, more preferably of from 40 to 94 wt.-% and still more preferably of from 70 to 93 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the gas stream.<br>
Moreover, the cooled gas stream after (i) generally comprises 10 wt.-% or less, pref-erably 9 wt.-% or less and more preferably 8 wt.-% or less of oxygen which originates from the decomposition reaction of the hydroperoxide used, based on the total weight of the gas stream.<br>
Moreover, the cooled gas stream after (i) may comprise up to 5 wt.-%, more preferably of from 0.01 to 5 wt.-%, more preferably of from 0.05 to 3 wt.-% and still more prefera-bly of from 0.1 to 2.5 wt.-% of inert gas, preferably nitrogen, based on the total weight of the gas stream.<br>
As further components, the cooled gas stream after (i) generally comprises solvent, preferably methanol of up to 10 wt.-%, preferably in the range of from 0.01 to 10 wt.-%, more preferably of from 0.1 to 5 wt.-% and still more preferably of from 0.5 to 2.5 wt.-%, and water of up to 5 wt.-%, preferably in the range of from 0.01 to 5 wt.-%, more pref-erably of from 0.05 to 2 wt.-% and still more preferably of from 0.1 to 1 wt.-%, each based on the total weight of the gas stream.<br>
Moreover, the cooled gas stream after (i) may comprise up to 10 wt.-%, preferably of from 0.1 to 10 wt.-%, more preferably of from 1 to 9 wt-% and still more preferably of from 2 to 8 wt.-% of alkane, preferably propane, based on the total weight of the gas stream.<br>
At least one of the condensates resulting from each cooling step, especially preferably all condensates resulting from cooling steps (a2), (b2) and (c2), are preferably col-lected and re-used for one or more purposes, e.g. introduced in at least one chemical process. More preferably, the condensates are recirculated into an epoxidation proc-ess, still more preferably into the epoxidation process the gas stream introduced in (i) results from.<br>
The plurality of compressing and cooling steps according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention displays at least three major improvements compared to the<br><br>
processes of the prior art: First, advantage is taken of the increased solubility of the olefin at higher pressures which simplifies a first separation and recirculation of the olefin which is based on the partial condensation of the olefin in (i). Thus, a first inte-grated process feature is provided. Second the solvents comprised in the gas stream introduced in (i), preferably methanol and water resulting from an epoxidation process, can be essentially completely condensed and preferably recirculated into the epoxida-tion reaction as starting materials, thus providing a second integrated process feature. These features of direct recirculation of one or more compounds therefore lead to a decrease of the total economic cost of the overall process. Recirculation into the epoxi0-dation is inter alia possible since compressing and cooling according to (i) leads to condensates which comprises only a very small amount of oxygen. Third, the gas stream according to (i) is compressed so that the solubility of the absorbent used in the subsequent step (ii) is enhanced. However, in spite of compressing and concentrating the gas stream in (i), the gas stream resulting from (i) has an oxygen content of less than 9 percent by volume which means that the preferred gas streams obtained from (i) are not within the explosive area. The term "explosive area" as used in the context of the present invention refers to the range of the molar ratio of propene : oxygen in which the mixture comprising propene and oxygen is an explosive mixture.<br>
The gas stream obtained after step (i), preferably after (c2), having a preferred pres-sure of more than 7,5 bar to 25 bar, preferably of from 11 to 20 bar and especially pref-erably of from 13 to 18 bar, and a preferred temperature of from 20 to 55 °C, preferably of from 25 to 50 °C and especially preferably of from 30 to 45 °C, is then introduced in step (ii) of the process according to the invention where the olefin is separated from the gas stream introduced in (ii) by absorbing the olefin in an absorbent.<br>
As absorption apparatus, it is possible to use at least one packed column and/or at least one tray column and/or at least one bubble column, and/or in special cases, at least one Venturi scrubber. Especially preferably, the at least one apparatus, preferably an absorption column, is operated in countercurrent. The term "countercurrent11 as used with respect to the absorption apparatus in the context of the present invention relates to an apparatus in which the gas stream resulting from (i) is introduced in an absorption unit, preferably an absorption column, preferably at a lower section of the unit, and preferably a liquid phase comprising at least one absorbent is introduced upwards with respect to the location where the gas stream is introduced in the unit. Most preferably, the liquid phase exits the absorption unit at a location below the location the gas stream is introduced in the absorption unit.<br>
One further major advantage of a preferred process according to the present invention is the fact that no inert gas such as methane has to be additionally added to the ab-sorption unit.<br>
The pressure the absorption of the olefin, preferably propene, is carried out at, is pref-erably in the range of from more than 10 to 20 bar, more preferably of from 11 to 19 bar<br><br>
and especially preferably of from 13 to 18 bar such as at a pressure of about 13 or about 14 or about 15 or about 16 or about 17 or about 18 bar.<br>
As at least one absorbent used for the absorption of the olefin, an absorbent or a mix-ture of two or more adsorbents is employed having a preferred boiling point at standard pressure of from 200 to 300 °C, more preferably of from 210 to 285 °C and especially preferably of from 220 to 270 °C.<br>
Although there are no particular restrictions as to which absorbent or mixture of absor-bents is employed, preference is given to hydrocarbons. The term hydrocarbons en-compasses aliphatic, cyclic, alicyclic, saturated, unsaturated and aromatic hydrocar-bons which may also be substituted by aliphatic radicals. The hydrocarbons can also be used in the form of mixtures in the process of the present invention. Especially pre-ferred are hydrocarbons having 9 or more, more preferably 10 or more carbon atoms.<br>
More preferably, the absorbent is a mixture of hydrocarbons CnH2n+2 wherein n is from 10 to 20. More preferably, n is from 11 to 18, more preferably from 12 to 16 and still more preferably from 13 to 15.<br>
This absorbent being a mixture of hydrocarbons CnH2n+2 preferably comprises the hy-drocarbon C14H30 in an amount of 10 percent by weight or more of the mixture, more preferably of 20 percent by weight or more, more preferably of 30 percent by weight or more, more preferably of 40 percent by weight or more, more preferably of 50 percent by weight or more, based on the total weight of the mixture of hydrocarbons. Accord-ingly, it is not necessary for the hydrocarbon C14H3o used in the process of the present invention to have a particularly high purity. The mixture described can, for example, be obtained in the refining of crude oil, with the mixture corresponding to the desired frac-tion being taken off. Further components which can as a result be present in addition to the tetradecane are further saturated hydrocarbons which may also be branched or unbranched, long-chain, cyclic or alicyclic. Unsaturated hydrocarbons or aromatic hy-drocarbons may also be present in such a mixture.<br>
Preferably, a column is used for absorbing the olefin, preferably propene. Particular preference is given to a column configured as a packed column, more preferably a packed column containing ordered packing. While the ordered packing mentioned can essentially be of any type, preference is given to packing which has a specific surface area in the range from 100 to 750 m2/m3. It is possible to use sheet metal packing, for example from Montz (type B1 100 to B1 500) or from Sulzer ChemTech (Mellapak 125 to Mellapak 750), or mesh packing from Montz (type A3 500 to A3 750) or from Sulzer ChemTech (type BX or CY). The unit m2/m3 refers to the geometric surface area of the material forming the packing per cubic meter of packing.<br>
The preferred pressure of from more than 10 bar to 20 bar, more preferably of from 11 to 19 bar and especially preferably of from 13 to 18 bar such as at a pressure of about<br><br>
13 or about 14 or about 15 or about 16 or about 17 or about 18 bar, prevailing in the absorption apparatus increases the solubility of the soluble constituents of the gas stream introduced in (ii), in particular the olefin, in the absorption medium, preferably the hydrocarbon or mixture of hydrocarbons. The pure, insoluble gas constituent then leaves the absorption apparatus preferably at the top of the column. This constituent preferably comprises inert gases such as nitrogen, and oxygen and small amounts of olefin, preferably propene. This insoluble gas constituent can, for example, be passed to incineration.<br>
The pure, insoluble gas constituent preferably obtained at the top of the column com-prises of from 10 to 95 wt.-%, preferably of from 30 to 90 wt.-% and still more prefera-bly or from 50 to 85 wt.-% of oxygen.<br>
The pure, insoluble gas constituent preferably obtained at the top of the column com-prises of from 1 to 30 wt.-%, preferably of from 2 to 20 wt.-% and still more preferably or from 5 to 15 wt.-% of inert gases such as nitrogen<br>
The pure, insoluble gas constituent preferably obtained at the top of the column com-prises up to 50 wt.-%, preferably of from 0.01 to 50 wt.-%, more preferably of from 0.1 to 40 wt.-% and still more preferably or from 0.5 to 35 wt.-% olefin, preferably propene.<br>
The olefin-laden absorbent stream, preferably the olefin-laden hydrocarbon stream, obtained at the bottom of the absorption column, preferably comprises 80 % or more, more preferably 90 % or more, and most preferably 99 % or more of the olefin com-prised in the gas stream introduced in (ii).<br>
The hydrocarbons used as absorption medium in the present invention have an excel-lent solvent capacity for olefins, so that the process can be carried out using compara-tively small amounts of absorption medium compared to processes where, e.g. mix-tures of isopropanol and water, acetone, heptane or octane are used as absorbents. The novel process is therefore extremely advantageous for industrial use. In case the olefin is propene, the ratio of absorbent being a mixture of hydrocarbons CnH2n+2 with n from 13 to 15 comprising Ci4H30 in an amount of 30 percent by weight of the mixture or more, to propene comprised in the gas stream introduced in (ii), is preferably smaller than or equal to 3, more preferably smaller than or equal to 2 and still more preferably smaller than or equal to 1, calculated as mass ratio.<br>
The olefin-laden absorbent stream obtained at the bottom of the column is then passed to step (iii) of the process of the present invention where the olefin is separated from the absorbent by desorption.<br>
According to an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, one part of the bottoms stream obtained from the absorption column, preferably comprising from 20 to 50 wt.-% of absorbent or absorbent mixture, is not passed to step (iii) but subse-<br><br>
quently recirculated into the absorption column. In the context of the present invention, this recirculation is referred to as internal absorbent recirculation. Preferably, from 50 to 98 % of the bottoms stream, more preferably from 70 to 95 % of the bottoms stream are recirculated. More preferably, this part of the bottoms stream is suitably cooled, prior to recirculation into the absorbtion column to a temperature in a preferred range of from 20 to 45 °C, more preferably from 25 to 35 °C. According to an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, the part of the bottoms stream recircutated into the absorption column is introduced in the column above the lower section of the column where the gas stream obtained in (i) is introduced and, still more preferably, below the upper part of the absorption column where the absorbent is preferably introduced via the external absorbent recirculation and/or where the absorbent is introduced as fresh absorbent which had not yet come in contact with olefin. In the context of the present invention, the external absorbent recirculation refers to recirculation of absorbent which has been separated from olefin in (iii) as described hereinunder. It was found that the internal absorbent recirculation is a further major advantage of the method of the present invention since the bottoms stream obtained from the absorption column is typically not completely saturated with olefin. Using this remaining capacity by recirculating a part of the bottoms stream further enhances the integration aspect of the inventive method.<br>
In general, there are no restrictions as to the explicit method according to which and the at least one apparatus in which this separation according to (iii) is carried out. Separation by desorption may be preferably carried out, for example, by distillation and/or by vaporization.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to separate the olefin from the absorbent and then further purify the olefin. If, e.g., the stream introduced in (iii) comprises absorbent, olefin, and alkane, such as, preferably, a hydrocarbon or a mixture of hydrocarbons, propene and propane, the present invention pro-vides a process in which in step (iii) the absorbent is separated from olefin and alkane, the olefin being subsequently separated from the alkane. According to a preferred em-bodiment, the absorbent is at least partially recirculated into (ii) as externally recircu-lated absorbent as it is described hereinabove. According to a further preferred em-bodiment, the olefin is at least partially recirculated into an epoxidation reaction, pref-erably an epoxidation reaction the gas stream introduced in (i) results from.<br>
Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the separa-tion of the olefin, preferably propene, is carried out in a forced circulation vaporizer. Therefore, the liquid stream resulting from (ii) is passed to a forced circulation vapor-izer, the vaporizer being operated at a preferred pressure of from 0.5 to barprefera bly of from 1 to 3 bar, and a preferred temperature of from 60 to 100 °C, more prefera-bly from 70 to 95 °C and still more preferably of from 80 to 90 °C. The liquid phase ob-tained from the forced circulation vaporizer has a purity of preferably 90 % or more, more preferably 95 % or more and still more preferably of 97 % or more, with regard to<br><br>
absorbent, preferably the hydrocarbon or hydrocarbons as described above. The gaseous phase obtained in the forced circulation vaporizer comprises the olefin, pref-erably propene, preferably the alkane, more preferably propane, and 1 wt.-% or less, more preferably 0.5 wt.-% or less of the absorbent.<br>
In general, this gaseous stream may be used for any conceivable purpose. Among others, it may be re-used as starting material for one or more chemical processes such as an epoxidaion reaction or used as energy source for steam generation where the steam may be used in one or more chemical processes such as an integrated epoxida-tion process.<br>
Preferably, the gaseous stream obtained from the vaporizer is cooled in a downstream heat exchanger, to a preferred temperature of from 20 to 40 °C, preferably from 25 to 35 °C. In this heat exchanger, the absorbent comprised in the gaseous stream is at least partially condensed and preferably recirculated as liquid phase as absorbent into (ii). The gaseous phase obtained from this heat exchanger preferably comprises 0.7 wt.-% or less, more preferably 0.4 wt.-% or less of absorbent, the olefin, preferably propene and optionally the alkane, preferably propane. This gaseous stream is pref-erably compressed in a downstream compressor, preferably a two-stage compressor, to a pressure of preferably from 10 to 12 bar and subsequently cooled in a heat ex-changer to a preferred temperature of from 30 to 40 °C. The thus obtained liquid phase, preferably comprising olefin and alkane, most preferably propene and propane, is fed either directly to a reaction stage such as the preferred epoxidation process or to at least one further purification stage or partly to a reaction stage and partly to at least one further purification stage.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the gas stream intro-duced in (i) is an offgas stream of an epoxidation process in which an olefin, most pref-erably propene is used as olefin in the epoxidation reaction. This propene used for the epoxidation preferably contains propane as saturated hydrocarbon. Preference is given to using fractions which comprise propene and propane in a volume ratio of from about 99.5 : 0.5 to 94 : 6. Such mixtures are also referred to as "chemical grade" propene. Preference is given to using propene of this purity in the preparation of propene oxide according to the present invention. Therefore, in a particularly preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention, the offgas stream from the conversion of propene into propene oxide comprises propene as olefin and propane as alkane. In the process of the present invention, this offgas which has been freed of propene and propane is separated off at the top of the absorption apparatus and the absorbent, preferably the hydrocarbon or hydrocarbons as described above, laden with propene and propane, is separated off at the bottom of the absorption column. In the subsequent desorption step (iii) according to the preferred embodiment described above where a forced circu-lation vaporizer is used, the liquid phase obtained preferably after the two-stage com-pression and the heat exchanging, the liquid phase preferably comprising olefin and<br><br>
alkane, most preferably propene and propane, is preferably fed to at least one further purification stage.<br>
This purification step where this liquid phase is fractioned into the components propene and propane, is preferably carried out in a C3 splitter as described, for example, in Ull-mann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Volume A22, page 214. The separation can be carried out in a column at a pressure of from about 15 to 25 bar. The separation can also be carried out using thermally coupled columns, and these are, for example, operated at a pressure of about 15 or 25 bar. The propene is taken off at the top of the C3 splitter configured as a column, and the propa'ne is taken off at the bottom.<br>
The propene which has been separated off at the top of the C3 splitter can then be re-circulated to the epoxidation process as starting material for reaction with the hydrop-eroxide. The propane can be used for any conceivable purpose, e.g. as energy source for steam generation.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the olefin is separated from the absorbent using a separation column. According to a still further embodiment, the absorbent obtained is subsequently purified. If, e.g., the stream intro-duced in (iii) comprises absorbent, olefin, and alkane, such as , preferably, a hydrocar-bon or a mixture of hydrocarbons, propene and propane, the present invention pro-vides a process in which in step (iii) the olefin is separated from absorbent and alkane, the absorbent being subsequently separated from the alkane. According to a preferred embodiment, the absorbent is at least partially recirculated into (ii). According to a fur-ther preferred embodiment, the olefin is at least partially recirculated into an epoxida-tion reaction, preferably an epoxidation reaction the gas stream introduced in (i) results from.<br>
Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the absorbent stream laden with olefin and alkane is passed to a distillation column where the olefin is separated from absorbent, and where the olefin is obtained overhead and the alkane and absorbent are obtained at the bottom.<br>
The distillation column, having preferably of from 80 to 200, more preferably of from 100 to 160 and still more preferably of from 120 to 140 theoretical plates, is operated at a preferred pressure of from 10 to 30 bar, more preferably of from 12 to 28 bar and especially preferably of from 16 to 25 bar.<br>
At the top of this column, an olefin stream, preferably a propene stream is obtained having a purity of 90 % or more, more preferably of 95 % or more, and especially pref-erably of 97 % or more.<br><br>
The olefin, preferably the propene which has been separated off at the top of the column may be at least partially recirculated to the epoxidation process as starting material for reaction with the hydroperoxide.<br>

This gaseous phase is passed to a heat exchanger where it is cooled to a preferred temperature of from 20 to 60 °C, more preferably from 30 to 50 °C and still more preferably from 35 to 45 °C. The liquid phase obtained from the heat exchanger is preferably recirculated into the flash drum. The gaseous phase obtained from the heat exchanger contains 50 ppm or less, more preferably 40 ppm or less, more preferably 30 ppm or less, more preferably 20 ppm or less and still more preferably 10 ppm or less of absorbent. This gaseous phase can be used for any conceivable purpose, e.g. as energy source for steam generation.<br>
It might be possible that the bottoms stream obtained from the distillation column where the olefin is separated from the absorbent additionally comprises an alcohol, most preferably methanol, e.g. in concentrations in the range of up to 15 wt.-%, preferably from 1 to 15 wt.-%, more preferably from 5 to 10 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the bottoms stream. This is the case if, for example, the gas stream introduced in (i) results from a reaction, preferably an epoxidation reaction where this alcohol, preferably methanol, is used as solvent. In this case, the absorbent is separated from the alcohol and for example propene and propane in said flash drum or said forced circulation vaporizer so that the absorbent obtained and preferably externally recirculated to (ii) has an alcohol content, preferably a methanol content, of 5 wt.-% or less, preferably 3.5 wt.-% or less, based on the total weight of the absorbent obtained.<br><br>
According to a still further preferred embodiment, the liquid stream obtained from this step is passed to a heat exchanger prior to external recirculation as absorbent in (ii). In said heat exchanger, the liquid phase, if necessary, may be cooled to a temperature of from 20 to 55 °C, preferably of from 25 to 50 °C and especially preferably of from 30 to 45 °C.<br>
This heat exchanger used for cooling the liquid stream may have essentially any con-figuration. Examples of configurations of the heat exchanger are shell-and-tube heat exchangers, coil heat exchangers or plate heat exchangers. For the purposes of the present invention, preference is given to using a heat exchanger which is configured as a shell-and-tube heat exchanger. As coolant, any conceivable medium can be em-ployed. Preferred coolants are, among others, common river water or secondary cool-ants such as secondary cooling water.<br>
In the overall process of the present invention, the absorption and desorption units are connected to form a continuously operating unit. Moreover, it is preferred that absorp-tion and desorption and olefin, preferably propene separation units are connected to form a continuously operating unit. Moreover, it is preferred that absorption and de-sorption and olefin, preferably propene separation units are connected with the epoxi-dation apparatuses to form a continuously operating unit.

The following examples are used to illustrate the present invention and are not meant to be limiting.<br>
Examples<br>
In Fig. 1, a method according to the present invention is depicted where three compressing steps are combined with three cooling steps, and where tetradecane is used as absorbent.<br>
An offgas stream 1 having a temperature of 9 °C is introduced at a pressure of 1.1 bar within a mass flow of 1,000 kg/h in first compressing unit a1. The offgas stream has the following composition: N2 (0.22 wt.-%), O2 (1.06 wt.-%), propene (90.49 wt.-%), propane (4.54 wt-%), methanol (3.51 wt.-%), water (0.18 wt.-%).<br>
From the first compressing unit, the compressed stream is passed to a first cooling unit a2, the cooled stream is passed to a second compressing unit b1, and the compressed stream leaving b1 is passed to a second cooling unit b2.<br>
From b2, a condensed stream 2 is withdrawn having a temperature of 38 °C at a pressure of 6.6 bar and a mass flow of 2.66 kg/h. The stream 2 has the following composition: N2 (0.00 wt.-%), O2 (0.04 wt.-%), propene (6.96 wt.-%), propane (0.25 wt.-%), methanol (80.70 wt.-%), water (11.63 wt.-%).<br>
The stream passed to a third compressing unit d and subsequently passed to a cooling unit c2 is separated in a stream 3 and a stream 4. The condensed stream 3 is withdrawn from c2 having a temperature of 40 °C at a pressure of 16.2 bar and a mass flow of 693.13 kg/h. The stream 3 has the following composition: N2 (0.02 wt.-%), O2 (0.17 wt.-%), propene (90.53 wt.-%), propane (4.53 wt.-%), methanol (4.52 wt.-%), water (0.19 wt.-%).<br>

Stream 4 is subsequently introduced into an absorption unit d1 into which part of the bottoms stream as internal absorbent recirculation stream and a stream 6 as external<br><br>
absorbent recirculation stream are additionally introduced. The internal recirculation stream is introduced in d1 upwards the section of d1 the stream 4 is introduced, and the external recirculation stream 6 is introduced in d1 upwards the section of d1 the internal recirculation stream is introduced. The pressure in d1 is about 16 bar.<br>
From d1, a top stream 5 is withdrawn having a temperature of 16 °C at a pressure of 16 bar and a mass flow of 10.36 kg/h. Stream 5 has the following composition: N2 (18.25 wt.-%), O2 (78.44 wt.-%), propene (1.91 wt-%), propane (1.33 wt.-%), methanol (0.01 wt.-%), water (0.01 wt.-%), and tetradecane (0.00 wt.-%). The bottoms stream withdrawn from d1 is partially recirculated, as described above, and partially passed into a first desorption unit e1 from which a first stream is withdrawn, passed to a second absorption unit d2 and recirculated as stream 6, as described above, into d1. The stream 6 introduced into d1 has a temperature of 16 °C, a pressure of 18 bar and a mass flow of 412.98 kg/h.

The second stream removed from e1 is passed to a second desorption unit e2 from which a stream 7 results having a temperature of 40 °C, a pressure of 18 bar and a mass flow of 293.66 kg/h. Stream 7 has the following composition: N2 (0.05 wt-%), O2 (0.42), propene (94.2 wt-%), propane (4.71 wt-%), methanol (0.53 wt.-%), water (0.05 wt-%), and tetradecane (0.00 wt-%).<br>
The absorbent: offgas ratio (mass flow of stream 6: mass flow of stream 1) is 0.42 :1.<br>
In Fig, 2, a method according to the prior art is depicted where only one compressing and only one cooling step is employed, and wherein methanol is used as absorbent.<br>
An offgas stream 1 having a temperature of 10 °C is introduced at a pressure of 1.1 bar within a mass flow of 1,000 kg/h in compressing unit a1. The offgas stream has the following composition: N2 (0.22 wt-%), O2 (1.06 wt-%), propene (90.49 wt.-%), propane (4.54 wt-%), methanol (3.51 wt-%), water (0.18 wt-%).<br>
From the compressing unit a1, the compressed stream is passed to a cooling unit a2 from which a stream 2 is withdrawn having a temperature of 25 °C, a pressure of 2.5 bar and a mass flow of 1,000 kg/h. The stream 2 has the following composition: N2 (0.22 wt-%), O2 (1.06 wt-%), propene (90.49 wt-%), propane (4.54 wt-%), methanol (3.51 wt-%), water (0.1 B wt-%).<br>
Stream 2 is subsequently introduced into an absorption unit d1 into which a stream 4 as absorbent recirculation stream is additionally introduced. The recirculation stream is introduced in d1 upwards the section of d1 the stream 2 is introduced. The pressure in d1 is about 2.4 bar.<br><br>
From d1, a top stream 3 is withdrawn having a temperature of 27 °C at a pressure of 2.4 bar and a mass flow of 21 kg/h. Stream 3 has the following composition: N2 (10.33 wt-%), O2 (49.30 wt.-%)f propene (32.59 wt.-%), propane (0.55 wt-%), methanol (7.22 wt.-%), water (0.01 wt.-%). The bottoms stream withdrawn from di is passed into a first desorption unit e1 from which a first stream is withdrawn, passed to a second absorption unit d2 and recirculated as stream 4, as described above, into d1. The stream 4 introduced into d1 has a temperature of 25 °C, a pressure of 2.4 bar and a mass flow of 23,105 kg/h (i.e., about 56 times the value of the respective mass flow according to the invention !). Stream 4 has the following composition: N2 (0.00 wt-%), O2 (0.00 wt-%), propene (0.01 wt-%), propane (0.00 wt-%), methanol (99,98 wt-%), water (0.01 wt.-%).<br>
The second stream removed from e1 is passed to a second desorption unit e2 from which a stream 5 results having a temperature of 18 °C, a pressure of 18 bar and a mass flow of 963 kg/h. Stream 5 has the following composition: N2 (0.01 wt-%), O2 (0.03), propene (93.26 wt-%), propane (4.68 wt-%), methanol (2.00 wt-%), water (0.01 wt-%).<br>
     The absorbent: offgas ratio (mass flow of stream 4 : mass flow of stream 1) is 23 : 1 (i.e.).<br>
Thus, contrary to the method according to the invention, a method according to which a similar amount of oxygen is removed from d1 per hour can be carried out only at an absorbent recirculation stream (stream 4) at a much higher mass flow than the respective recirculation stream according to the invention (stream 6). However, the higher the mass flow, the larger the dimensions which are necessary for treating this stream, for example the desorption unit e1 and the absorption unit d2. From this aspect alone the method of the present invention shows its superiority compared to the described method of the prior art. Moreover, stream 5 withdrawn from e2 according to the method of the prior art contains a significant amount of absorbent (methanol; 2.00 wt-%) whereas in the respective stream 7 of the present invention, the absorbent content is 0.00 wt- %.<br><br><br><br>

14.	The method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 13, wherein the gas stream is an<br>
offgas stream resulting from an epoxidation process, said process comprising<br>
reacting the olefin with a hydroperoxide to give a product stream comprising ole<br>
fin and olefin oxide and at least one other component, and separating the olefin<br>
oxide from said product stream to give the offgas stream.<br>
15.	The method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the epoxidation reaction is carried<br>
out in the presence of a solvent comprising methanol.<br>
16.	The method as claimed in claim 14 or 15, wherein the epoxidation reaction is<br>
carried out in the presence of a titanium zeolite catalyst.<br>
17.	The method as claimed in any of claims 14 to 16, wherein the offgas stream<br>
comprises the olefin, methanol, water, at least one inert gas, 10 wt.-% of oxygen<br>
or less, and 100 ppm olefin oxide or less.<br>
18.	The method as claimed in claim 17, wherein, in (i), from 30 to 90 percent by<br>
weight of the olefin, from 40 to 99 percent by weight of the methanol and from 35<br>
to 99 percent by weight of the water, comprised in the offgas stream, are con<br>
densed.<br>
19.	The method as claimed in any of claims 14 to 18, wherein the olefin is propene<br>
and the olefin oxide is propene oxide.<br>
20.	The method as claimed in any of claims 14 to 19, wherein the olefin obtained in<br>
