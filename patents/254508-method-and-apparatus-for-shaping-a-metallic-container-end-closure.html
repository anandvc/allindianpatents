METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SHAPING A METALLIC CONTAINER END CLOSURE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a manufacturing process for forming metallic containers and container end closures, and more specifically a method and apparatus for forming high strength geometries while maintaining necessary chuck wall and seaming panel characteristics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Metallic beverage can end closures have historically been designed and manufactured to provide a stiffening bead referred to as countersink. This feature may include vertical walls attached by a foil radius bottom forming a channel, and in some embodiments may incorporate arcuate shapes or other geometric profiles. Absolute vertical walls may not exist, but generally the more vertical they become the greater the resistance to deformations resulting from internal pressure.<br>
Beverage can bodies and end closures must be durable to withstand high internal pressures, yet manufactured with extremely thin and durable materials such as aluminum to decrease the overall cost of the manufacturing process and the weight of the finished product Accordingly, there exists a significant need for a durable beverage can end closure which can withstand the high internal pressures created by carbonated beverages, and the external forces applied during shipping, yet which are made from durable, lightweight and extremely thin metallic materials with geometric configurations which reduce material requirements. To obtain these characteristics, can end closures require aggressive material working to achieve the various forms and geometries, which is generally accomplished utilizing a male/female tool combination. Unfortunately, this process may lead to inconsistencies within a given<br><br>
contour or geometry.  Formation inconsistencies also apply to strength performance. The aggressive forming within the countersink may alter other characteristics within the body of the entire structure. Thus, there is a significant need to provide an apparatus and material forming technique which provides improved end closure on container geometries which have improved strength and buckle resistance. These features are obtained in one embodiment by placing the end closure material in compression during forming to avoid thinning and unwanted material deformation, while simultaneously supporting certain portions of the end closure chuck wall and seaming crown geometry during forming while not supporting other portions to create a predetermined shape.<br>
One patent related to a method and apparatus for producing a container end closure countersink is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,685,189, (die " '189 patent") which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In the (189 patent, a portion of the countersink is formed when the countersink is unsupported by tooling while the countersink is placed in compression. Unfortunately, with lighter gage stock materials this process has been found to allow unwanted deformation in the chuck wall and seaming crown, and thus inconsistencies in the end closure geometry.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for forming a preferred geometric shape in containers and end closures utilizing thin walled materials (.0084 or less gauge) which have improved strength characteristics and material properties. Thus, in one aspect of the present invention a "free forming" process is used in the manufacturing of a metallic container end closure, wherein at least a portion of the material is placed in compression during forming, and is thus<br><br>
less likely to become "coined" or thinned, and ultimately weakened. It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for forming a predetermined shape from a metallic material wherein a portion of the metallic material is unsupported by a tool during formation. Thus, a portion of the metallic material is allowed to "free form" into a desired shape without being substantially supported on both the entire upper or lower surface of the material.<br>
It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide a forming press to form a preferred geometry in a metallic end closure with existing high speed forming processes currently known in the industry and having improved reliability. Thus, in one aspect of the present invention an inner pressure sleeve is utilized in combination with critical forming parameters to assure that the end closure achieves a predetermined geometry, and is extracted efficiently from the forming process at speeds of 1800 - 11,000 end closures/minute.<br>
It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide an inner pressure sleeve which is driven with pins extending between itself and either a pneumatic piston, spring plate or individual springs to apply a sufficient force to support a portion of an end closure chuck wall to form a preferred geometry during manufacturing.<br>
It is another aspect of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for forming a preferred geometric shape in container end closures where other portions of the end closure are supported on both an interior and exterior surface to prevent movement and unwanted deformation, while another portion is allowed to "free form". Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention a "pressure sleeve" is used to support an end closure chuck wall and/or the seaming panel radius against a<br><br>
die core ring during forming, while at least a portion of the countersink is placed in compression to form a preferred geometry. Thus, in one aspect of the present invention an apparatus for forming a preferred shape in a metallic blank to create a beverage container end closure with a preferred geometry. It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for forming improved end closure geometries by generally utilizing tooling equipment which is well known in a container end closure manufacturing plant, and thus requires only minor modifications to implement. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, an apparatus is provided to form a metallic end closure which generally comprises:<br>
a first tool in opposing relationship to a second tool which is adapted to provide a clamping force on a portion of a seaming panel of the metallic material;<br>
a third tool in opposing relationship to a fourth tool which is adapted to providing a clamping force on a central panel portion of the metallic material;<br>
a fifth tool positioned between said first tool and said third tool, which is adapted to support at least a portion of a chuck wall portion of said metallic material; and<br>
providing a reciprocating motion between at least said fifth tool and said first and second tools while a portion of a countersink in the container end closure remains unsupported, wherein a preferred geometry is created in the countersink producing a material thickening, thus avoiding a reduction of material thickness of the countersink.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a method for forming a predetermined shape in a metallic container end closure is provided herein, the end closure generally comprising a seaming panel interconnected to a downwardly<br><br>
extending chuckwall, a central panel having a substantially vertical center axis; and a countersink integrally interconnected to a lower portion of the chuck wall and the central panel, comprising:<br>
positioning an end closure blank in a forming press;<br>
providing a clamping force on at least a portion of the seaming panel between a first tool and a second tool;<br>
providing a clamping force on at least a portion of the central panel between a third tool and a fourth tool to substantially prevent movement of the central panel;<br>
supporting at least a portion of the chuckwall on both an interior surface and an exterior surface to substantially prevent movement of at least a portion of the chuckwall;<br>
supporting a first portion of the countersink with at least one of said third tool and said fourth tool while allowing another portion of the countersink to remain unsupported; and<br>
providing a compressive force on the countersink while retaining the chuck wall in a preferred position, wherein the end closure is formed into a predetermined shape.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring now to Figs. 1-3, cross-sectional front elevation views are provided of alternative embodiments of uncurled beverage can end closures capable of being formed with the process defined herein. Other end closure geometries not shown herein may also be formed using the invention described herein as appreciated by one skilled in the art. More specifically, a metallic beverage can end closure 1 is generally comprised of a circular seaming panel 2, a chuck wall 6, a countersink 7, a central panel 12, and an inner panel radius 11 which interconnects the central panel 12 to the countersink 7. Further, the uncurled seam height 13 may extend beyond the seaming panel 2. The circular seaming panel 2 is additionally comprised of an outer seaming panel radius 3, seaming panel radius 4. and inner seaming pane! radiiis- ;<br><br>
The seaming panel 2 is designed for interconnection to a neck of a container by double seaming or other methods well known in the art. The countersink 7 is generally comprised of an outer countersink panel wall 8, a countersink radius 9, and an inner countersink panel wall 10. In some embodiments, the chuck wall 6 may additionally be comprised of multiple straight angles, radii and arcs depending on any specific application, and as appreciated by one skilled in the art the process described herein is not limited to any specific end closure shape or geometry.<br>
Referring now to Fig 3, another embodiment of an end closure capable of being formed with the present process is provided herein. In this figure the terms "A" represent a specific angle, "D" a specific diameter, "G" and "H" a specific height, <cr a specific radius and width. as appreciated by one skilled in the art any of these variables may be modified to provide an end closure specifically suited for given container pressure projected use etc.></cr>
Referring now to Figs. 4 and 5, a cross-sectional front elevation view of one embodiment of a prior art single action press for forming a container end closure as shown herein. More specifically, Fig. 5 identifies the cross-sectional front elevational view showing in greater detail the end closure countersink geometry with respect to the forming tool shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Figs. 4-5, the seaming panel 2 of the uncurled beverage shell 1 is held in position between the die core ring top surface 34 and the knock out or pressure sleeve face 43, while the end closure chuck wall is positioned against the die core ring inner walls 36' The end closure central panel 12 is clamped between the countersink punch 21 and the panel punch 20. Fig. 5 depicts in greater detail the geometry of the end closure 1 which depicts the positioning of the die core ring 19, the panel punch 20 and the die core 21.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 6 and 7, a front cross-sectional elevation ;'1ev-r i? ' prior art method of forming an end closure is provided herein, and iu describee ^ _<br><br>
S. Patent No. 5,685,189 to Nguyen and Farley. More specifically, the positioning of the end closure 1 is identified and more specifically shows where a clamping force is placed on the end closure seaming panel and central panel as depicted by the arrows. More specifically, the numbering related to these drawings in Fig 5D and 5E are found in the ' 189 patent, which is incorporated herein in reference in its entirety.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 8, a cross-sectional front elevation of one embodiment of the present invention is provided herein, and which further identifies the use of an inner pressure sleeve 24 which is operably positioned opposite the die core ring to hold the end closure chuck wall 6 and seaming panel radius 5 in a preferred position. More specifically, the inner pressure sleeve 24 provides support for the chuck wall 6 and seaming panel radius 5 while the die core ring and outer pressure sleeve 22 move upwardly and the countersink is placed in compression. As further shown in the drawing, the central panel 12 is additionally clamped along with the seaming panel of the uncurled beverage shell 1.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 9, a depiction of the inner pressure sleeve timing is provided herein, and which shows the operative steps as the pressure sleeve moves from top dead center to bottom dead center returning to top dead center. More specifically, the forming cycle begins when the die center clamps material against the panel punch. The inner pressure sleeve then clamps the material against the die core ring, while the final form is achieved through compression as identified and represented by the number 3.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 10, a cross-sectional front elevation view of one embodiment of the present invention is provided herein, and which shows additional detail regarding the positioning of the various components with respect to the uncurled beverage shell 1, and at the conclusion of the forming process. .-_s rrther shown in this drawing, the inner pressure sleeve 24 is shown providing support Cxi IL:<br><br>
exterior surface of the end closure chuck wall and seaming panel radius 5, and retaining the end closure chuck wall securely to the die core ring 19 to prevent any relative movement therein. As compression is provided to the uncurled beverage shell countersink 7, a preferred geometric shape is obtained while retaining the geometry of the chuck wall 6 and seaming panel radius 5 in a preferred orientation.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 11, a cross-sectional front elevation view of an inner pressure sleeve is provided herein, and which depicts the location of compression on the chuck wall of the uncurled beverage shell 1 to control the chuck wall geometry during the forming process. Furthermore, and as appreciated by one skilled in the art, the geometry of the inner pressure sleeve face will also determine the overall geometry of the chuck wall 6 and seaming panel radius 5 during the forming process.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 12-23, cross-sectional front elevation views are provided herein which compare the prior art forming process in the right hand portion of the drawing to shape an uncurled beverage shell, as compared to the new free forming method of the present invention shown on the left hand side. As shown in these drawings, the use of an inner pressure sleeve 24 has not previously been used in the art to provide support on the chuck wall and seaming panel radius 5 on the outer surface during the forming process, while simultaneously placing the end closure countersink in compression to allow free forming.<br>
Referring again to Figs. 10-23, each drawing provides a cross sectional front elevation view intended to identify a tooling assembly with the various components necessary to produce an unseamed beverage container end closure. A complete die may include a single pocket or tooling assembly as illustrated, or multiple pockets, the quantity being limited more so by material width rather than press or tonnage capabilities. The lower tooling components generally include a"cut edge I" -r: dn."r ring 18 or die core ring 19, and a panel punch 20. The upper icoiing con:pcr-e^:d rr^<br><br>
include a counter sink punch 21, blanking punch 16, and may include an inner pressure sleeve 24. The die generally operates but is not limited to within a press including a single slide or ram. Beginning in an open position the upper tools are affixed to a die shoe which is attached to a press slide driven by a crankshaft and connection rods tied to a slide. The metallic forming material 14, most commonly aluminum, feeds over the lower tooling, although other well known metals used in the container industry could be utilized.<br>
Referring now to the following figures in greater detail, a brief description of the forming operation is provided herein:<br>
Figure 12: The upper tooling is shown traveling downward with the blanking punch 16 contacting the material 14, thus initializing a blanking action. Figure 13: The blank metallic material 14 is clamped between blanking punch face 31 and draw ring face 33 at, during or after blanking, with continued downward travel. The clamping force may be a result of a spring, pneumatic application or other similar methods utilized to apply a force. The material is drawn tightly over the top surface of the die core ring 34. With continued downward travel, the metallic material 14 is drawn between the inner most diameter of the blanking punch 32 and the outer most diameter of the die core ring 35. Simultaneously, the metallic material 14 is being clamped between the upper surface of the die core ring 34 and the draw ring 22. The draw ring 22 applies pressure to the metallic material 14 during the forming sequence to control material flow and prevent unwanted distortion. Again, the clamping force may be obtained within a spring, pneumatic application or other similar methods utilized to apply a force.<br>
Figure 14-15: With continued downward travel, the die core 21 comes in contact with the material and begins the drawing process of the metallic material 14 to begin forming the interior geometry of the beverage can end.  During ihe aowry;vara iravei,<br><br>
the metallic material 14 becomes clamped between the die core 21 and the panel punch 20, and the die core ring 19 and inner pressure sleeve 24. Figure 16: With continued downward travel, the forming sequence reaches the final downward movement, known as bottom dead center. At this stage of the sequence, the seaming panel 2 and chuckwall 6 have substantially been formed. In addition, the metallic material 14 available to form the final countersink geometry 7 and the center panel geometry 12 has been drawn to the interior diameter of the die core ring 19 between surfaces 36 and 39.<br>
Figure 17 - 18: The forming sequence is shown continuing with upward travel of the blanking punch 16, die core 21, and the panel punch 20. The sequence continues upward until the panel punch 20 returns to its original position, or also referred to as stop position free forming and compressing the final countersink geometry 7 with the inner pressure sleeve 24 continuing to clamp on the die core ring 19 up to or beyond the stop position.<br>
At this stage of the sequence, the uncurled beverage end formation is complete, however removal of the completed container beverage end must be accomplished. Figure 19-23: The forming sequence continues upward until the full open position is achieved. The outer pressure sleeve 22 serves to strip the now finished yet uncurled container end from the innermost diameter 32 of the blanking punch 16 and the shell is ejected by air or other similar method.<br>
Referring again to Figs. 12-23, a comparison of the prior art method of<br>
forming an end closure is shown on the right hand side, while the new forming<br>
technique is shown on the left.	As depicted in this sequence of drawings, the<br>
new forming process provides distinct advantages, including:<br>
a) capable of producing end closures with aggressive geometries -"hik-maintaining total control of the chuck wall and seaming panel;<br><br>
b)	allows the forming of difficult chuck wall and countersink geometries<br>
without metal thickness reductions;<br>
c)	allows  the formation of end  closure  countersinks  with material<br>
thickening, wherein the prior art may create thinning or coming in the metal in<br>
various locations;<br>
d)	the added control of the present invention allows tooling designs which<br>
more accurately define closure contours than previous apparatus with aggressive<br>
forms;<br>
e)	capable of producing closure with higher strength materials without<br>
the metal fatigue normally associated with tight forms and radii;<br>
f)	the greater control and latitude provided by the present invention allow<br>
higher strength end closures with lower material gauge; and<br>
g)	improved operating efficiency dining manufacturing and removal of<br>
the container end closures from the forming press.<br>
While an effort has been made to describe various alternatives to the preferred embodiment, other alternatives will readily come to mind to those skilled in the art. Therefore, it should be understood that the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or central characteristics thereof. Present examples and embodiments, therefore, are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not intended to be limited to the details given herein.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
