ENGLISH TRANSLATION VARIFICATION<br>
CERTIFICATE u/r. 20(3)(b) 1114/MUMNP/2005<br>
I, Mr. HIRAL CHANDRAKANT JOSHI, an authorized agent for the applicant, ZF FRIEDRICHSHAFEN AG do hereby verify that the content of English translated complete specification filed in pursuance of PCT International application No. PCT/DE06/002056 thereof is correct and complete.<br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to a connection for the torque-transmitting connection of a hollow shaft to a connecting component, according to the precharacterising clause of Claim 1.<br>
Connections of the above-mentioned type are used for the connection between all types of torque-transmitting components and the associated shafts. By way of example, but in no way exclusively, connections of the generic type are used in the connection of torque levers or links to shafts or stabiliser devices. One of the fields of application here is in the area of shock- and vibration-damping suspension of motor vehicle driver's cabs, in particular in lorries and similar heavy-load-carrying vehicles, in order to decouple the driver's cab from the vehicle chassis with regard to vibrations and movements.<br>
Since the spring rates of the chassis springs are unavoidably high in heavy-load-carrying vehicles owing to the high vehicle loads, to a considerable extent road irregularities or vibrations from the axles and drive train are still transmitted to the chassis via the axle springing. In order to minimise, for reasons of ergonomics and occupational safety of the driver, the transmission of such continual shocks and vibrations to the driver's cab and thus to the driver's workplace, driver's cab suspensions have been developed in which the driver's cab is supported on the vehicle chassis using its own suspension system. By virtue of the much lower mass of the driver's cab compared with the vehicle mass, such suspension systems for the driver's cab are designed with lower spring rates and softer shock dampers than the axle suspension, which is why road irregularities or vibrations coming from the drive train or axles of the vehicle can be isolated or kept away from the driver's workplace much better by virtue of such cab suspension systems.<br>
Such suspension devices for driver's cabs are structurally complex, in particular when there are increased requirements in terms of transverse-force support or kinematics - such as, for example, pitch or roll suppression. Thus, besides the actual spring or damper elements, it is necessary to provide roll stabilisers, like with axle<br><br><br>
suspensions of motor vehicles, with which stabilisers the undesired lateral rolling of the driver's cab relative to the vehicle chassis can be reduced.<br>
For roll stabilisation - for example when driving on a slope or cornering - but also, for example, in the case of road irregularities on one side - roll stabilisers in the form of torsion bars or stabiliser shafts are employed in suspension devices for driver's cabs according to the prior art, the compression travels of the driver's cab suspension elements on the left and right in relation to the direction of movement being coupled to one another to a certain extent by these stabilisers.<br>
To introduce the forces, torques and movements of the vehicle cab into the roll stabiliser, in this case torque levers are generally attached to the two axle ends of the roll stabiliser, of which torque levers the end remote from the shaft is connected to the vehicle cab in each case by means of a bearing, while the end close to the shaft has in each case a connection to the roll stabiliser. In this case, either the roll stabiliser itself constitutes the bearing of the torque levers which is fixed to the chassis, or in each case one further bearing point is arranged at the end of the torque levers which is close to the shaft, which bearing point serves for connecting the torque levers to the chassis and for introducing the reaction forces which occur during rolling movements into the chassis.<br>
Connections of the generic type, in particular between roll stabilisers and the associated torque levers, are subject, however, to high stresses over the service life. This applies in particular when - for example for reasons of weight saving while at the same time increasing the torsional stiffness - torsion bars or stabiliser shafts for roll stabilisers are designed in the form of relatively thin-walled torsion tubes or hollow shafts.<br>
For the torque-transmitting connection of such torsion tubes to corresponding connecting components, such as, for example, torque levers, it is known from the prior art in particular to connect the torque levers to the torsion tubes by welding or<br><br><br>
pressing. In both cases, however, a connection between the torque lever and the torsion tube produced in this way represents a highly loaded potential weak point.<br>
In a welding connection between the torque lever and the torsion tube, this is due especially to the heat introduced during welding and to the associated structural changes and notch stresses. Pure pressing connections between the torsion tube and the torque lever can, admittedly, be produced by relatively gentle cold working, but they often do not achieve the required service life in view of the high forces and torques which occur. This also applies when for the hollow shaft - for the purpose of increasing the transmittable torque - a cross-sectional shape which differs from the circular shape is chosen in the region of the connection to the connecting component.<br>
This is due - particularly in the case of the relatively thin-walled torsion tubes or hollow shafts employed for weight reasons - to the fact that the tube wall in the region where the force is introduced into the torsion tube is only able to transmit limited compressive or shearing forces. For this reason, press fits between the hollow shaft and the connecting component, for example, cannot be designed with the firm press fit required for the transmission of high torques. If the relatively low transmittable specific forces are exceeded, therefore, either peeling of the tube wall in the region of the press fit of the torque lever occurs, or the tube wall may be pushed in, which results in subsequent failure of the tube cross-section.<br>
The field of application of the connection also extends, however, as the applicant has discovered, for example to roll stabilisation and axle guidance in particular in the case of commercial vehicle axles. For roll stabilisation of commercial vehicle axles, mainly transverse stabilisers consisting of solid material and bent from one piece are employed in the prior art, these stabilisers having a correspondingly high mass particularly in the case of heavy commercial vehicles, and their degree of material utilisation with regard to the torsion or torsional stiffness provided being extremely unfavourable. In this case, the replacement of the massive transverse stabilisers by larger-volume, relatively thin-walled and thus lighter hollow shafts has often failed<br><br><br>
hitherto because of the problematic connecting technique between such hollow shafts and the torque-transmitting connecting components, such as, for example, torque levers.<br>
With this background, the object of the present invention is to create a connection for the torque-transmitting connection between hollow shafts and their connecting components, by which the disadvantages mentioned can be overcome. The connection in this case is to enable the transmission of high torques between, in particular, thin-walled hollow shafts and the respective components without damage, while at the same time achieving high reliability against failure. Furthermore, the connection between the hollow shaft and the connecting component is to be obtainable in a cost-effective and process-reliable manner in production and assembly.<br>
This object is achieved by a connection having the features of Claim 1.<br>
Preferred embodiments are the subject-matter of the subclaims.<br>
The connection according to the invention serves, in a manner known initially per se, for the torque-transmitting arrangement of a connecting component, for example a torque lever or a hub, on a hollow shaft. The connecting component comprises in this case a through-opening which has a shape corresponding to the outer cross-sectional shape of the hollow shaft and which serves to receive the hollow shaft.<br>
According to the invention, the connecting component is distinguished, however, in that the hollow shaft contains a press stopper in the region of the connection to the connecting component. The press stopper forms, on at least parts of its circumferential surface, a press fit with the wall of the hollow shaft.<br>
By virtue of the press stopper according to the invention, relatively thin-walled hollow shafts may also be connected to corresponding connecting components, such<br><br><br>
as, for example, hubs or torque levers, without the risk of failure of the press fit and/or tube wall in the region of the connection on high loading of the connection. This is due to the fact that the press stopper supports the tube wall of the hollow shaft in the region of the connection and presses it against the inner surface of the opening of the connecting component, so that a surface pressure or press fit results not only between the press stopper and the tube wall, but also between the outer surface of the hollow shaft and the inner surface of the opening of the connecting component.<br>
In this way, it is possible to obtain, between the tube wall and the connecting component, pressing forces which are higher by orders of magnitude than those possible with pressing connections according to the prior art.<br>
By virtue of the invention, not only higher forces and torques can thus be transmitted between otherwise practically unchanged connecting components and hollow shafts, but it is thus also possible to further increase the diameter of the hollow shafts used, while at the same time reducing their wall thickness, and this can be utilised for a weight reduction to achieve the desirable lightweight construction on the vehicle.<br>
For the realisation of the invention, the cross-sectional shape of the outer circumference of the hollow shaft and the opening of the connecting component in the connecting region to the connecting component is initially not essential. Rather, the press stopper according to the invention can also be beneficially employed even with hollow shafts having a circular outer cross-section in the connecting region.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, however, the hollow shaft has, at least in the connecting region to the connecting component, a cross-sectional shape differing from the circular shape. In this way, the torque transmittable between the hollow shaft and the connecting component can be significantly further increased, since hereby, in addition to the force fit produced by the press fit and by<br><br><br>
the press stopper, there is also the form fit caused by the connection cross-section which differs from the circular shape.<br>
The increase of the transmittable torque occurs in this case first of all irrespective of the specific cross-sectional shape, differing from the circular shape, of the hollow shaft and of the opening of the connecting component. For example, it is conceivable to design the hollow shaft in the connecting region, as well as the connecting opening, with an oval or elliptical cross-sectional shape, with which in particular only a small additional notch effect is associated. Depending on the application and design, as the applicant has discovered, even a much more favourable diffusion of operational stress can thus occur than is the case with a circular cross-sectional shape of the connecting region.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, however, the hollow shaft and the opening of the connecting component each has a substantially polygonal cross-section. As a result, a particularly intimate form fit between the hollow shaft and the connecting component is achieved, and particularly high torques can be transmitted.<br>
Preferably, in this case, the polygonal outer cross-sectional shape of the hollow shaft and the inner cross-sectional shape, which has a shape corresponding thereto, of the opening of the connecting component has a continuously finite curvature. In other words, this means that the outer cross-sectional shape of the hollow shaft and the inner cross-sectional shape of the connecting component has no sharp edges, but that the edges of the polygonal cross-sectional shape are rather of rounded design. In this way, the notch effect occurring in the material in the region of the polygon edges is reduced and the torque transmittable in the long term without damage is increased.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the cross-sectional shape of the hollow shaft and the connecting component in the connecting region is formed as an orbiform curve. The so-called orbiform curve represents a closed line<br><br><br>
which, in any position within a suitable square, - as also a circle inscribed in the square - always touches all four sides of the square. The orbiform curve as a cross-sectional shape of the hollow shaft and the connecting component in the connecting region represents a particularly effective compromise between the polygon which has an optimum form fit but high notch effect, on the one hand, and the circular cross-section without a form fit and without a notch effect, on the other hand.<br>
The invention can be realised in this case first of all irrespective of the specific shape and cross-sectional shape of the press stopper, provided in particular that a collapse of the thin-walled hollow shaft owing to the introduced torques is prevented by means of the outward pressing of the wall of the hollow shaft by the press stopper. Thus, for example, the use of a press stopper having a substantially circular cross-section is conceivable also in the case of a substantially polygonal cross-sectional shape of the hollow shaft and the opening of the connecting component in the connecting region, since the circular cross-section can also support the wall at least regionally and press it against the inner surface of the opening of the connecting component.<br>
Preferably, however, the outer cross-section of the press stopper is formed with a shape corresponding to the inner cross-sectional shape of the hollow shaft in the connecting region to the connecting component. In this way, the pressure between the press stopper and the hollow shaft takes place over the entire circumference of the hollow shaft, and this results in an effective and reliable transmission of high torques.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the press stopper and the opening of the connecting component are formed in a slightly tapering manner, in the axial direction of the shaft, in the connecting region of the hollow shaft and the connecting component. This results in even higher surface pressures between the press stopper, the hollow shaft and the opening of the connecting component as the press stopper is pressed in. Higher torques can thus be reliably transmitted, and<br><br><br>
moreover a higher resistance of the connecting component to tearing off in the axial direction results, since the press stopper as it is pressed in expands the previously prismatic end of the hollow shaft and in the process presses it against the tapering inner contour of the connecting component.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, it is provided that the press stopper is hollow, or has an opening in the axial direction. This leads, on the one hand, to a weight saving for the press stopper and allows, on the other hand, an improvement of the course of the force lines in the region, in particular, of the inner axial end of the press stopper in the mounted state, owing to the then smaller abrupt changes in wall thickness at the point of entry of the hollow shaft into the pressing connection.<br>
The invention can be realised first of all irrespective of the specific choice of material with regard to the press stopper. According to preferred embodiments, however, the press stopper is produced from a ferrous material (for example steel) or from a nonferrous material (for example aluminium). A press stopper made of steel can be produced cost-effectively, offers at the same time a high strength and allows the generation of high surface pressures. A press stopper made of aluminium is particularly advantageous with regard to its low weight and with regard to the high ductility of aluminium. The latter contributes likewise to the reduction of the damaging edge pressure and the associated undesired notch effect, which may otherwise occur particularly in the region of the entry of the hollow shaft into the pressing connection.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, the press stopper has a taper or a circumferential bevel at at least one of its axial ends. A press stopper shaped in this way can be inserted and mounted more easily, and furthermore the tilting and possible chip formation in the region of the inner surface of the hollow shaft as the press stopper is pressed into the opening of the hollow shaft is prevented.<br><br><br>
A further embodiment of the invention provides that the cross-sectional shape, differing from the circular shape, of the hollow shaft is present substantially only in the connecting region of the hollow shaft to the connecting component. In other words, this means that the hollow shaft has, outside the connecting regions to the connecting components, a cross-sectional shape different to the connecting regions -in particular a circular cross-section. As a result, costs during the production of the hollow shaft can be saved, since the hollow shaft according to this embodiment is given the cross-sectional shape differing from the circular shape merely at its two ends.<br>
The invention is realised irrespective of the specific application of the connection, since the connection according to the invention can be employed in the most varied kinds of shaft/hub connections. According to particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, however, the hollow shaft is a torsion-bar spring or a transverse stabiliser, in particular a roll stabiliser for a driver's cab of a lorry, or a roll stabiliser of a commercial vehicle axle connection. In this case, the connecting component preferably constitutes a link for guiding the driver's cab in the event of vertical relative movements between the driver's cab and the chassis, or a link for guiding a vehicle axle. The latter embodiment leads to the additional advantage that a roll stabiliser of a commercial vehicle axle connection can in this way additionally also undertake demanding link or wheel-guidance tasks, particularly also with heavy commercial vehicles, with the result that otherwise required assemblies, corresponding structural space, and mass, as well as costs, can be saved.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with reference to drawings illustrating merely exemplary embodiments and in which:<br>
Fig. 1   shows an isometric illustration of a roll stabiliser for a driver's cab having one embodiment of a connection according to the invention;<br><br><br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic illustration of a connection of the roll stabiliser according to Figure 1 in a longitudinal section through the hollow shaft and the elastomer bearing;<br>
Fig. 3 shows the press stopper of the connection of the roll stabiliser according to Figure 1 and 2 in half-section;<br>
Fig. 4   shows the press stopper according to Figure 3 in plan view;<br>
Fig. 5   shows the press stopper according to Figure 3 and 4 in an isometric view;<br>
Fig. 6 shows an isometric view of a roll stabiliser for an axle connection having a further embodiment of a connection according to the invention; and<br>
Fig. 7 shows, in an enlarged illustration corresponding to Figure 6 and the connecting region of the torque lever of the roll stabiliser according to Figure 6 with the connection.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a roll stabiliser for the driver's cab (not illustrated) of a lorry. The hollow shaft 1, which acts as a torsion element and on the two ends of which there is arranged in each case one torque lever 2, can be seen. Each of the two torque levers 2 carries two bearing points 3 and 4 provided with elastomer bearings, the bearing point 3 close to the shaft serving in each case to connect the roll stabiliser to the driver's cab and the bearing point 4 remote from the shaft serving in each case for connection to the vehicle chassis. The function of the bearing-point pairs 3, 4 may, however, also be reversed while retaining the functionality of the roll stabiliser, which means that the bearing points 3 close to the shaft are articulated on the driver's cab, whereas the bearing points remote from the shaft are articulated on the chassis.<br><br><br>
In Figure 1, it can also be seen that the hollow shaft 1, which has a circular cross-section in its middle region 5, is widened in the regions 6 of its ends into a cross-sectional shape corresponding substantially to an orbiform curve 7, the cross-sectional shape of the orbiform curve 7 being derived from the triangle in this embodiment. The torque levers 2 have in each case one opening, which corresponds to the outer cross-section 7 of the hollow shaft 1 in the region 6 of its ends and thus corresponds likewise to the cross-section of an orbiform curve 7.<br>
To assemble the roll stabiliser, first of all the two torque levers 2 are slipped or pressed onto the previously widened ends 6 of the hollow shaft 1. Subsequently, the two end-side openings of the hollow shaft 1 are each closed by a press stopper 8, the outer circumference of which likewise corresponds to an orbiform curve 7 corresponding to the cross-sectional shape of the hollow shaft 1 and the opening of the torque lever 2. The dimensions of the outer circumference of the press stopper 8 are chosen here such that a press fit results between the opening of the torque lever 2, the wall of the hollow shaft 1 arranged therein, and the press stopper 8 arranged in the hollow shaft 1.<br>
Fig. 2 shows one of the two connecting regions between the hollow shaft 1 and the torque lever 2 in a longitudinal section through the hollow shaft 1 and the elastomer bearing 3 close to the shaft. The end of the hollow shaft 1 with the press stopper 8 arranged therein can be seen. The press stopper 8 presses the wall of the hollow shaft 1 against the inner surface of the opening in the torque lever 2. In this way, torques can be reliably transmitted between the torque lever 2 and the hollow shaft 1, which torques exceed the torques transmittable without the press stopper 8 by orders of magnitude.<br>
An additional advantage of the use, according to the invention, of the press stopper 8 lies in the fact that the interior of the hollow shaft 1 is completely closed off from the environment in this way. As a result, corrosion in the interior of the hollow shaft 1 is reliably prevented, and there is thus no need to apply corrosion protection to the<br><br><br>
inner surface of the hollow shaft 1 either, thereby in turn saving costs. Moreover, owing to the local strengthening of the hollow shaft 1 by the pressed-in stopper 8, the maximum bending stresses which occur due to the bending moments likewise acting on the hollow shaft 1 are displaced to the less heavily loaded middle regions 5 of the hollow shaft 1. This, too, enables further improvement of the reliability against failure of the connection according to the invention.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show the press stopper 8 of the connection according to Figure 1 and 2 once again, in half-section and plan view, respectively. It can be seen that the press stopper 8 has a central opening 9. By means of this hollow design of the press stopper 8, on the one hand the course of the force lines in the region of the connection is improved, the abrupt changes in stiffness which occur there are reduced, and furthermore weight is also saved.<br>
Figure 5 shows the press stopper of the connection according to Figure 1 and 2 once again, in an isometric illustration. Besides the opening 9, it is also possible to see the taper or bevel 10, which the press stopper 8 bears on its end side facing the middle of the hollow shaft 1. By virtue of this bevel 10, the press stopper 8 can be inserted more easily, and moreover damage or peeling of material at the inner surface of the hollow shaft 1 is avoided.<br>
Figure 6 and Figure 7 show a further roll stabiliser for an axle connection. In this roll stabiliser, too, the torque levers 2 are again connected by means of ends, shaped as an orbiform curve, of the otherwise cylindrical hollow shaft 1 to corresponding openings with a corresponding shape in the torque levers 2, designed here, for example, as a welded construction. For the manner of construction of the torque levers, other embodiments, such as, for example, deep-drawn or cast torque levers, are also conceivable. In the roll stabiliser according to Figure 6 and 7, moreover, the bearing 3 which is close the shaft, and for example fixed to the axle, is arranged directly on the hollow shaft 1, while the bearing 4 which is remote from the shaft,<br><br><br>
and for example can be connected to the chassis connection, is arranged at the end of the torque levers 2 as before.<br>
In particular the enlarged illustration of Figure 7 again shows clearly in this case that the thin wall, which is delicate per se, of the hollow shaft (illustrated here with dots to make it clear) is enclosed in a completely form-fitting manner between the material of the opening of the torque lever 2 and the material of the press stopper 8. This results in a reliable torque transmission despite the cross-sectional shape, designed with relatively large radii of curvature as an orbiform curve 7, of the opening, the hollow-shaft end and the press stopper 8, this cross-sectional shape thus also contributing to a particularly uniform flow of force.<br>
In conclusion, it thus becomes clear that, by virtue of the invention, a connection for the torque-transmitting connection between hollow shafts and connecting components is created, which ensures a transmission of relatively high torques over the entire service life of the arrangement. The connection according to the invention allows, in particular, the use of thin-walled and thus weight-saving hollow shafts. Finally, with the connection according to the invention, cost reductions in production and assembly, as well as a reduction of the maintenance requirement in operation, can be expected.<br>
The invention thus contributes to improving the technology of shaft/ hub connections, particularly in the area of the intended application in roll stabilisers, for axle connections and in the mounting of driver's cabs of commercial vehicles.<br><br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The invention relates to a connection for the torque-transmitting connection of a connecting component (2) to a hollow shaft (1). The connection component (2) comprises a through-opening which has a shape corresponding to the outer cross-section of the hollow shaft (1) and which serves to receive the hollow shaft (1).<br>
According to the invention, the connection is distinguished in that the hollow shaft (1) contains a press stopper (8) in the connecting region of the hollow shaft (1) and the connecting component (2). The press stopper (8) forms, at least regionally, a press fit with the wall of the hollow shaft (1).<br>
The connection according to the invention enables the transmission of relatively high torques during the entire service life. Moreover, thin-walled, weight-saving hollow shafts may also be employed. With the connection according to the invention, cost reductions in production, assembly and maintenance can thus be expected.<br>
