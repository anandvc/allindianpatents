				<td>Description<br>
The present invention concerns a connecting means for connect¬ing several individual components. Such a connecting means consists of a connecting clip connecting two individual compo¬nents, and of a connecting clip receptacle on each of the in¬dividual components to be connected, whereby a connecting clip/connecting clip receptacle-system is formed which repre¬sents the connecting means.<br>
Preferably, the present invention is to serve for connecting electrotechnical components such as circuit breakers, auto¬matic cutouts, residual current operated devices, etc. Yet it shall already be noted here that the use is not only re¬stricted to electrotechnical articles. Rather this field will be gone into here in an exemplary manner, because the cur¬rently preferred embodiments belong to this field.<br>
When installing a plurality of electrotechnical components, these often have to be arranged side by side or connected with each other in switch boxes. Up to now, this has always been achieved by a continuous rivet joint or by so-called spectacle springs which hold tight, like clamps, two components placed side by side, when the rolled-up spring ends engage in corre¬sponding recesses of the components and the temple of the spectacle spring bridges the two components, thereby connect¬ing them.<br>
However, this connection has various disadvantages. Firstly, the assembly is relatively difficult, because considerable skillfulness is required for placing the spectacle spring parts in the recesses of the components to be connected with¬out losing the spectacle spring at the same time. The assembly was thereby rendered more difficult, time-consuming and there¬fore more expensive. Secondly, the two individual components to be connected were aligned only by laying the two lateral<br><br>
surfaces side by side. An additional alignment was necessary, e. y. in the form of centering.<br>
Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a connecting means which can connect plural individual compo¬nents in an easy manner; at the same time, the following ad¬vantages are to be achieved: The assembly shall be simple, time-saving and therefore moderate in price; the connection of two components shall be stable and provide for a simultaneous centering; further the connecting means shall be no longer easily detachable.<br>
Moreover a connecting means shall be as multifunctional as possible, so that it can be coupled to several different con¬necting members.<br>
This object is achieved by a connecting clip according to claim 1, a connecting clip receptacle according to claim 8, as well as an electric appliance with a connecting means accord¬ing to claim 11. Further advantageous embodiments of the in¬vention are subject matter of the subclaims.<br>
t-<br>
In the following, basic advantages of the subject matter of the invention as well as their advantageous further develop¬ments will be explained briefly.<br>
By the catch connection of the connecting clip to the connect¬ing clip receptacle, an assembly of two individual components becomes extremely simple. Further, due to the catch noses catching in undercuts of the groove, the connection of two components to be connected becomes nondetachable, in particu¬lar since the undercuts in which the catch noses of the con¬necting clips catch are located, when assembled, in the inte¬rior of the two components and are therefore no longer acces¬sible from the outside.<br><br>
Due to the groove of the connecting clip receptacle of an in¬dividual component having a depth which approximately corre¬sponds to half the thickness of the rod of the connecting clip, the rod of the connecting clip simultaneously engages in the two grooves of the connecting clip receptacles of two in¬dividual components laid side by side when the connecting clip is inserted. Moreover, the catch noses of the connecting clip catch in both undercuts of the grooves of the two individual components to the connected. The design of the connecting clip is thereby facilitated and its production costs can be kept low.<br>
Further, due to the pin-like insertion sections of the anchor stock of the connecting clip being inserted in corresponding insertion receptacles of the individual components to be con¬nected, a simple fixing of the two individual components in a direction lateral to the direction of insertion is achieved. At the same time, the connecting clip with its two insertion sections makes sure that the two individual components are correctly positioned to each other.<br>
By outside grooves which are provided in the bent corner area of the anchor stock in the transition area to the insertion sections, it is possible to form the pin-like insertion sec¬tions a little flexible, so that it is possible to widen these insertion sections relatively to the pin. The same is obtained by a material recess in the inner corner area at the bending between the anchor stock and the insertion section.<br>
The grooves and the insertion receptacles in the connecting clip receptacle section can easily be taken into account when producing the individual components, to the effect that their production costs are kept low.<br><br>
this manner, different connecting clips can be used selec¬tively for connecting two components with each other.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail by means of the fol¬lowing descriptions of detailed embodiments while referring to the figures.<br>

Fig. 7 shows the same view than Fig. 6, yet with the connect¬ing clip being caught in.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a further perspective representation of Fig. 7.<br>
In the following, a first embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 4.<br><br>
First the connecting clip 1 will be described on the basis of Fig. 2.<br>
The connecting clip has a basically anchor-shaped form. It consists of a rod 2 and an anchor stock 3 which, at one end of the rod, is integrally formed in a manner transversely thereto. The rod 2 and the anchor stock 3 have a basically rectangular cross-section and are arranged such that the rod 2 is oriented upright relative to the anchor stock 3.<br>
At its other end, the rod 2 shows a catch member 5. The catch member 5 consists of a V-shaped recess 7 which is open at the lower end of the rod 2 and converges inwardly. Thereby foot section halves are formed. At these foot section halves, catch noses 11 are provided which project on the side of the rod 2 averted from the V-shaped recess 7. These catch noses 11 have an auxiliary bevel for assembly 13 for facilitating the inser¬tion of the connecting clip into a corresponding groove in the individual component to be connected during the later assem¬bly. Due to the V-shaped recess 7, the rod 2 is flexible in the lower section and can be pressed together a little when being inserted into a groove which is somewhat smaller than the foot section. Thereby an insertion into a recess is ren¬dered possible whose width is a little smaller than the width which the foot section together with the catch noses would have, because the catch noses are simply flexed inwardly in order to adapt to the width of the recess.<br>
At both of its end sections, the anchor stock 3 has a'pin-shaped, perpendicularly bent insertion section 4 which is bent by approximately 90 degrees such that it extends in a manner approximately parallel to the rod 2. In the angular section, a recess 10 is provided on the inner side in order to provide the pin-shaped catch sections 4 with a certain flexibility.<br><br>
In the following, a connecting clip receptacle which is pro-vided in a component to be connected A, B and which serves for receiving the connecting clip shall be described in more de¬tail with particular reference to Fig. 1.<br>
The connecting clip receptacle is provided twice and is lo¬cated on two opposite sides of a component to be connected A, B. In this manner, a component to be connected can selectively be connected on the left or the right side or on both sides simultaneously with one or two components to be connected. Such a side becomes joined to a corresponding side of a fur¬ther individual component B, and both components are fixed to each other by the connecting clip 1 (see Fig. 4).<br>
The connecting clip receptacle consists of a groove 20 which is formed on a lateral surface of the individual component A to be connected such that it is open at one end. This groove<br>
20	extends in a basically elongated manner, starting from an<br>
insertion side, namely from the open groove side, with an aux¬<br>
iliary bevel for assembly 23 which serves for inserting the<br>
connecting clip more easily being provided in the open portion<br>
where the groove begins. It is followed by a lead-in section<br>
21	which has a groove width which approximately corresponds to<br>
the width of the rod of the connecting clip to be inserted.<br>
Since, however, the connecting clip shows a catch nose 11<br>
whose width exceeds the normal width of the rod 3, the catch<br>
noses 11 are slightly pressed together when passing the lead-<br>
in section 21. This pressing together is rendered possible by<br>
the V-recess 7. This lead-in section 21 is followed by a catch<br>
section 22.<br>
The catch section 22 shows an undercut 24 whose width is larger than the width of the lead-in section 21. Due to this, the catch member can extend again after having been pressed together in the lead-in section 21, and consequently catches in the undercut 24.<br><br>
According to Fig. 1, the groove 20 has a groove depth d/2 which approximately corresponds to half the thickness d of the rod 2, to the effect that when inserting the connecting clip 1, only half of the rod engages, in the thickness extension, in the groove 20 of the connecting clip receptacle. The other half projects outwardly.<br>
In the following the assembly of two individual components will be described. Two individual components to be connected A, B are joined to each other (see Fig. 4) on the sides which respectively show a connecting clip receptacle. A blind-hole-like orifice is thereby formed by the two grooves 20 which is broadened at its end by the undercut 24 to form the catch sec¬tion 22. When the connecting clip is inserted into the groove 20, the catch noses 11 of the catch member 5 are pressed to¬gether flexibly. The connecting clip is inserted until the catch noses 11 catch in the undercut 24 of the groove 20 in the connecting clip receptacle, this means that the catch noses 11 form back from their pressed position to their normal position.<br>
Simultaneously, the pin-like catch sections 4 of the anchor stock 3 are inserted into corresponding insertion receptacles 25 which are additionally formed in the connecting clip recep¬tacle. In doing so, possibly existing dimensional inaccuracies not only of the connecting clip but also of the connecting clip receptacle are evened out by the flexibility of the pin-like insertion section 4. As already explained, the flexibil¬ity is also caused by the material recess 10.<br>
Due to the catch noses 11 of the connecting clip 1 catching in the catch section 22 of the groove 20 of the connecting clip receptacle, the connection becomes nondetachable, because the catch noses are no longer accessible in the undercut. By si¬multaneously inserting the pin-like catch sections 4 into the corresponding insertion receptacles 25, it is obtained that all parts are aligned with each other.<br><br>
A second embodiment of the present invention will now be de¬scribed.<br>
In the following, a peculiarity of this embodiment shall also be described, namely the multiple ways of use of the connect¬ing clip receptacle, because the connecting clip according to the present invention does not always have to be used neces¬sarily. It is basically possible to use another connecting clip as well. So as to render this possible, the existing and above described connecting clip receptacle is formed in a skilled manner such that not only a connecting clip of the above described kind but also a connecting clip of a different kind can be inserted. Such a different connecting clip is shown in Fig. 5. Figs. 6 to 8 show in which manner the con¬necting clip according to Fig. 5 is inserted in the connecting clip receptacle.<br>
In the following, the connecting clip 1-1 shall be explained in detail with reference to Fig. 5.<br>
The connecting clip 1-1 has a basically anchor-shaped form showing a rod 3-1 as well as an anchor stock 4-1 extending transversely over one end of the rod. Not only the rod 3-1 but also the anchor stock 4-1 are flatly formed and have a rectan¬gular cross-section. At the other end of the rod, opposite the anchor stock 4-1, a pivoting foot 2-1 is located which is formed as a round shaft section and projects laterally from the rod 3-1 on the left and the right side. The pivoting axis of the pivoting foot is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the anchor stock 4-1. In addition, the pivoting axis of the pivoting foot 2-1 is transverse to the longitudinal extent of the anchor stock 4-1. Approximately in the center of the rod 3-1, a pin 5-1 is provided which extends parallel to the piv¬oting axis of the pivoting foot 2-1 and therefore projects a little from the rod 3-1, too. The anchor stock 4-1 has a slightly curved, bellied catch section 4a-l which is curved in<br><br>
the direction of the rod 3-1. This catch section 4a-l serves<br>
as a catch member during assembly. By a suitable design of the <br>
anchor stock, for instance by a notch in the center of the an¬chor stock, the tip of a screw driver can be used for disas¬sembling the device.<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 6, two components to be connected are indicated by reference numbers 13-1 and 14-1, with component 13-1 being, for example, a main device and component 14-1 be¬ing an auxiliary device which has to be mounted to the main device.<br>
In each of the two components to be connected 13-1 and 14-1, there is provided respectively one connecting clip receptacle as well as two recesses 11-1 respectively provided on the left and the right side in the connecting clip receptacle.<br>
In the following, the connecting clip receptacle will be de¬scribed.<br>
As can be gathered from Fig. 6, a groove 7-1 is provided on one side of the component 13-1 and 14-1 which extends over the entire lateral length. The groove 7-1 is open on both lateral ends. An undercut 9-1 is provided in the groove, so that the groove 7-1 and the undercut 9-1 form a kind of guide groove in which the pivoting foot 2-1 of the connecting clip 1-1 is re¬ceived and supported in a manner slidably shiftable to the left and the right, with the pivoting foot 2-1 being located in the undercut 9-1, whereas the rod 3-1 is guided in the groove 7-1. The anchor stock 4-1 is located outside tfie groove 7-1. Due to the pivoting foot 2-1 being guided in the undercut 9-1, it is impossible for the connecting clip to fall out of the groove, so that it can no longer get lost. The pin 5-1 prevents the anchor stock 4-1 from getting inadvertently into the interior of the component 13-1 through the groove 7-1, be¬cause then it would no longer be accessible from the outside.<br><br>
In the following, the engagement recess in the components 13-1<br>
and 14-1 will be described.<br><br>
It serves for receiving and securing the catch section 4a-l of the connecting clip 1-1, to the effect that detachment is no longer easily possible. For this purpose, a recess 11-1 is formed in the interior respectively on the left and on the right side of the groove 7-1 of the components 13-1, 14-1. This recess 11-1 corresponds basically to the shape of the catch section 4a-l of the anchor stock. This means that it consists of a joining surface which extends into the interior of the component 13-1, 14-1 in a manner approximately verti¬cally relative to the extent of the groove 7-1. This joining surface has, at its end, an undercut which corresponds ap¬proximately to the shape of the bellied catch section 4a-l of the connecting clip 1-1. When assembling the two components to be connected, the catch section 4a-l can catch in the recess 11-1 and engage in the undercut. Depending on how the recess is designed and the material flexibility of the connecting clip is set, the engagement function can be set from working very hard and difficult to detach to working very free and easily detachable.<br>
In the following, the connection of the two components 13-1, 14-1 by means of the connecting clip 1-1 will be described.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a view in which the connecting clip 1-1 is ar¬ranged in a component to be connected 13-1 and is in the open position. Component 14-1 to be connected with component 13-1 is in a joining position in which the two components are to be connected to each other. More precisely, the pivoting foot 2-1 of the connecting clip 1-1 is arranged in a rectangular pivot¬ing support 12-1 of the one component to be connected 13-1. So as to make this more comprehensible, the upper cover of the component to be connected 13-1 in which the connecting clip 1-1 is located is partly broken out, so that the connecting clip can be seen completely. In reality, of course, the stock 3-1<br><br>
of the connecting clip 1-1 is located, together with its piv- oting foot 2-1, in the interior of the component to be con¬nected 13-1, and only a part of the rod 3-1 and the anchor stock 4-1 project from the component to be connected 13-1 through a slot-like opening of the groove 7-1. The connecting clip 1-1 can be pivoted around its pivoting foot 2-1. When the connecting clip 1-1 is pivoted around the pivoting foot 2-1 in the direction of arrow A in Fig. 6, the connecting clip en¬gages with the second component to be connected 14-1, as shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, the connecting clip 1-1 is in a closed position.<br>
As can be gathered from Figs. 6 and 7, the two components 13-1 and 14-1 are equally designed as regards their design for re¬ceiving a connecting clip. This means that selectively and in a completely flexible manner, the connecting clip 1-1 of the component 13-1 for being connected with the component 14-1 can become engaged with the receptacle provided there and corre¬sponding thereto, and, vice versa, a connecting clip provided in component 14-1 could become engaged with the receptacle provided in component 13-1. Reference number 12-1 indicates a pivoting foot support which serves for supporting the pivoting foot 2-1 in two directions, with the connecting clip 1-1 re¬maining pivotable around the axis of the pivoting foot 2-1. The pivoting foot support 12-1 is formed of a wall section 12a-l and a further wall section 12b-l. The wall section 12a-l is not formed as high as the wall section 12b-l. The wall sec¬tion 12a-l is formed by the undercut 9-1 of the groove 7-1 ending before the end of the groove 7-1. The wall section 12a-1 is necessary for the pivoting foot 2-1 to become joined to it, with the rod 3-1, however, being able to slide across this wall section 12a-l, so that the connecting clip 1-1 can be pivoted such that it can engage with the component to be con¬nected 14-1 (see Figs. 6 and 7). The wall section 12b-l is formed so high that also the rod 3-1 becomes joined to this wall section, so that the pivoting of the connecting clip is restricted by this wall section. In this manner, it is guaran-<br><br>
teed that the connecting clip cannot pivot further into the interior, where it might no longer be accessible for the as¬semblers.<br>
Subsequent to the wall section 12b-l, the recess 11-1 with the undercut is located at right angles to the wall section 12b-l, with the undercut being formed correspondingly to a catch side of the catch section 4a of the anchor stock 4-1 of the con¬necting clip 1-1. When the connecting clip 1-1 is pivoted around the pivoting axis of its pivoting foot 2-1, as shown in Figs. 6 and 3-1, the connecting clip can be pivoted until a joining surface of its rod 3-1 becomes joined to the wall sec¬tion 12b-l, and the curved catch section 4a-l catches in the undercut of the recess 11-1. This state is shown in Fig. 7. In the present embodiment, the auxiliary and the main devices 13-1, 14-1 are tightly connected to each other in this state. The dimensions of the connecting clip in combination with suitably selected dimensions of the recess 11-1 in the component to be connected are chosen such that when the connecting clip is in¬serted, it braces the two components to be connected with each other.<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 7, the catch section 4a-l of the anchor stock of the connecting clip which is opposite the caught-in catch section 4a-l extends into the groove 7-1 of the auxil¬iary device 14-1 by which the connecting clip 1-1 could be pivoted inwardly. Thereby the connecting clip remains accessi¬ble from outside even in its closed position, at least for an auxiliary tool, such as a small screw driver, for example. Thereby the connection of the two components can be detached again. Consequently, the auxiliary device can easily be at¬tached to the main device, and can be detached therefrom in an equally easy way.<br>
As can be gathered from Figs. 4 and 5, for example, a V-shaped notch 6-1 is provided in the middle of the anchor stock 4-1 of the connecting clip, opposite the rod 3-1. Due to this notch<br><br>
6-1 it becomes even more easier to detach the connecting clip<br>
by means of an auxiliary tool, in order to move the catch sec¬tions 4a-l caught in the undercuts 11-1 from the closed posi¬tion to the open position. By means of a small screw driver, for example, it is easy to engage in the notch and press out the connecting clip.<br>
As can further be seen in Fig. 8, for example, where the aux¬iliary device is completely shown (i.e. without partial out¬breaks) , the connecting clip can be freely reciprocated within the groove 7-1 from the left to the right and vice versa, so that it can selectively be shifted from one pivoting foot sup¬port 12-1 on one side to another one on the other side. Conse¬quently, a main device 14-1 can be mounted to the auxiliary device 13-1 on the left and/or the right side selectively, whereby a maximum assembly flexibility is guaranteed.<br>
As can further be gathered from Fig. 6, the pin 5-1 at the connecting clip 1-1 serves for preventing the connecting clip from completely disappearing inadvertently in the groove 7-1 of the component to be connected 13-1 when the connecting clip is located somewhere in the middle of the groove 7-1, by the pin 5-1 stopping at the walls forming the groove 7-1. Conse¬quently the anchor stock 4-1 of the connecting clip cannot be pivoted completely into the interior of the component; this means that its pivoting range is more restricted in the cen¬tral section, i.e. in the non-lateral section, than in the lateral sections where the groove 7-1 is open and allows a pivoting of the connecting clip 1-1 until the rod 3-1 joins to the joining surface 12b-l.<br>
In addition, a sectionized reset 8-1 is provided on each of the adjoining side surfaces of the components to be connected 13-1, 14-1. When two components to be connected are laid side by side, a groove 10-1 is formed by the two adjoining section¬ized resets 8-1. When the connecting clip is brought to a closed position, i.e. when the connecting clip is pivoted to<br><br>
its closed position (in the direction of arrow A in Fig. 6),  the already described pin 5-1 pivots into this groove 10-1. In this manner, the pin 5-1 does, firstly, not impede the assem¬bly of the components to be connected; secondly, it can addi¬tionally serve for guiding. So as to enable the pin 5-1 to be¬come pivoted into the groove 10-1, auxiliary bevels for assem¬bly 15-1 are provided on each of the edges. Of course, these do not have to be pure auxiliary bevels. Rather, also a round¬ing or any other suitable form can be provided, so that the pin 5-1 can come to a pivoted position in an unimpeded manner.<br>
As can be seen from a comparison of the first embodiment of Figs. 1 to 4 with the second embodiment of Figs. 5 to 8, the connecting clip receptacles of both embodiments are designed equally. They are formed such that both connecting clips can be inserted selectively. This means that several function sur¬faces of the connecting clip receptacles have a double func¬tion; firstly, of receiving the connecting clip according to the first embodiment and, secondly, of receiving the connect¬ing clip according to the second embodiment. In this connec¬tion, e. g. partial sections of the groove 10-1 according to the second embodiment correspond to partial sections of the groove 22 according to the first embodiment. Further it can be gathered from Fig. 4, for example, that the insertion recepta¬cle 25 for receiving the insertion section 4 of the connecting clip according to the first embodiment is provided with an un¬dercut 27 which corresponds to the undercut 11-1 of the con¬necting clip receptacle according to the second embodiment. Further it can be seen in Fig. 1 that the connecting clip re¬ceptacle according to the first embodiment shows a groove with an undercut the like of which is necessary for receiving the connecting clip 1-1 according to the second embodiment.<br>
To sum up, one can say that the connecting clip receptacles of both embodiments described above show all features which are necessary for selectively receiving the connecting clip of the<br><br>
first or the second embodiment. Consequently, the design of<br>
the connecting clip receptacle is multifunctional. <br>
The connecting clip can be produced of synthetic resin. In this connection, an injection molding technique can be used by which an integral forming of the connecting clip is rendered possible, thus providing for an inexpensive production. The same applies to the production of the connecting clip recepta¬cle whose production can already be taken into account when producing the component to be connected.<br>
Further the connecting clip can be provided with a desired flexibility by choosing a suitable synthetic resin. By provid¬ing the connecting clip receptacles on each of two opposite sides of a component to be connected A, B, the individual com¬ponents can be fitted together in series in any number.<br>
The above described invention is particularly provided for electrical switch devices such as automatic cutouts, residual current operated devices, auxiliary circuit breakers or the like. Preferably all devices of a series are then provided with connecting clip receptacles of the above mentioned kind, so that they can be connected to any functional units.<br>
If, for example, a functional unit is to be formed of three or four automatic cutouts, these devices are connected by non-detachable connecting clips according to the first embodiment. For achieving a desired stability, all automatic cutouts show e. g. three clip receptacles. In this connection, respectively one could be located in the area of the terminals, as'shown in the figures, and one in the bottom of the device.<br>
If, however, an auxiliary circuit breaker is to be combined with a automatic cutout, the producer already provides the auxiliary circuit breaker with e. g. two detachable connecting clips according to the second embodiment which then catch in the connecting clip receptacles of the automatic cutout.<br><br>
Of course, all clip receptacles of the devices of a series have to be provided at the same level, because the connected devices are then arranged on the same hat bar.<br><br><br>
