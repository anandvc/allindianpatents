				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a spinning frame, a ring spinning frame in particular according to the preamble of claim 1,<br>
It is already known (DE 44 21 620 Al) to provide such a continuous conveyor on a ring spinning frame, whereby the loading and unloading of empty or full tubes takes place at a loading station for full tubes, an unloading station for empty tubes respectively, being provided at the front end of the spinning frame.<br>
In order to provide two tube pegs for mounting an empty and a full tube at the same time during a tube exchange at a specific spinning unit, it is already known (EP 0 404 875 Bl) to arrange a conventional tube peg and a supplemental tube peg behind each other (figures 18 - 20) on a peg tray or to arrange the main tube peg on a peg tray and the supplemental tube peg on engaging means being provided for the peg tray (figures 21, 22).<br>
A disadvantage in said known spinning frames is, that on the peg tray, being pushed forward by the continuous conveyor through the engaging means, considerable friction losses occur. Further there is a considerable tendency of contamination for the peg tray. Furthermore, peg trays being pushed forward only on one guide means can fall out of said guide means.<br>
It is the task of the present invention to provide a spinning frame of the before mentioned type, which still allows a quick exchange of full and empty tubes at each spinning unit, but nevertheless eliminates the disadvantages in connection with the manufacture and the working process of the peg tray being separate from the conveyor.<br>
The task for a spinning frame of the before mentioned type is solved according to the features of the operative part of claim 1.<br><br>
It is also the feature of the invention that the peg trays are not any more only elements which are separate from the continuous conveyor, and which are only temporarily in a driving engagement with that conveyor, but that the peg trays are continuously in mechanical engagement with the continuous conveyor. This feature allows for a suitable distribution of the supporting forces onto the conveyor an the peg trays and the friction losses and tendency of contamination can be minimised. Falling off of the peg trays from the machine frame is impossible since they are fixedly connected with the continuous conveyor.<br>
According to claim 2 the peg trays can be designed in such a manner that on one side they are supported by the conveyor and on the other side they are supported by the sliding support means. The load is thus distributed onto two structural parts.<br>
It is, however, also possible that the peg trays are entirely being carried by the sliding support means, and that the conveyor only serves as a driving means for the peg trays and that the conveyor preferably is also supported by the sliding support means via the peg trays (claim 3). Compared with already known peg trays the advantage is, that the peg trays remain constantly connected with the conveyor, for instance without the risk of falling off the sliding support means.<br>
According to a further embodiment (claim 4), the peg trays are entirely being supported by the continuous conveyor. In this case, however, a lateral guide (claim 5) should be provided, particularly at the redirecting points.<br>
An embodiment according to claim 6 features the advantage of an especially safe guiding and holding means for the peg trays on the machine frame.<br>
A further preferred embodiment is featured by claim 7. Accordingly, during the transport the inclination of the peg<br><br>
trays towards the horizontal plane can be changed by means of a suitable change of height of the supplemental sliding support means.<br>
Based on the inventive feature of an embodiment according to claim 8 the tube pegs and the supplemental pegs can be arranged behind each other or according to claim 9 side by side.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a A spinning frame, a ring spinning frame in particular, with spinning units arranged at equal spaces next to each other alongside a machine frame, with a tube extending device (doffer) to replace frill tubes wound with yam against empty tubes at each spiiming unit and with a synchronous continuous conveyor which runs along the spirming units with or without redirecting points and which conveys tube pegs arranged on a peg tray towards, away from the spiiming units respectively, whereby at least at one end of a group of spinning units a station for unloading frill tubes and loading empty tubes is being provided, characterized in that on the continuous conveyor behind each other peg trays are being mounted in continuous mechanical engagement, for carrying tube peg and a supplemental peg each, whose weight is completely or partially supported, directly or through the contmuous conveyor on sliding support means which are fixedly arranged in the longitudinal direction along the machine frame .<br>

figure 12  a schematical top view of the object according to figure 11, and<br>
figure 13  a schematical partial top view of a ring spinning frame being provided with peg trays according to figures 11 and 12.<br>
According to figure 1 spinnig units 11 are provided at even spaces on the two sides, alongside of a machine frame 25 of a ring spinning frame, indicated schematically. Alongside of said spinning units extend, in longitudinal direction of the machine frame 25, a tube exchanger (doffer) 14 and two strands 17", 17"" of a continuous conveyor 17, whereby at the front ends of the machine frame 25, these strands are redirected over rollers 26 mounted on vertical axis, and whereby said conveyor is being drivable for a movement in direction of the arrow.<br>
On the strands 17", 17"" of the continuous conveyor 17, peg trays 18 are fastened at the spaces of the spinning units 11, said peg trays carrying tube pegs 13 and supplemental pegs 2 3 behind each other, onto which, by means of the doffer 14, full tubes 15 (figure 8) are being replaced from the spinning units 11, and from which empty tubes 16 (figure 8) are taken and being replaced onto the spinning units.<br><br>
The operating process of such a spinning frame is as follows:<br>
With the continuous conveyor 17 at a stillstand and with the peg trays 18 being aligned to the spinning units 11 the full tubes 15 are taken from the spinning units by the doffer 14 and are being replaced onto the tube pegs 13, whereafter, also by means of the doffer 14, the empty tubes 16 are taken from the supplemental pegs 23 and are being replaced onto the corresponding spinning units 11.<br>
Afterwards the continuous conveyor 17 is moved, so that the full tubes 15 are brought to the station 12 at the front end of the machine frame 25 for unloading full tubes and loading empty tubes as is indicated in figure 1 schematically. At said station 12 the full tubes 15 are taken from the tube pegs 13 and from there they are transferred to further processing stations. Afterwards at the same station 12 empty tubes 16 are mounted onto the supplemental pegs 23 and after resuming the operation of the conveyor 17 the empty tubes 16 are being transferred to the spinning units 11, where, after winding of the empty tube 16 at the spinning unit 11, the process is repeated as described above.<br>
According to figure 2, the conveyor 17 has peg trays 18 laterally mounted, each comprising two tube pegs arranged behind each other, that is one tube peg 13 and one supplemental peg 23, which basically rest on a sliding support means 19 that is fixedly arranged underneath the pegs 13, 23, on the machine frame, which is shown in figure 1 as a rail 19 running alongside the conveyor 17 around the machine frame 25. Due to said design the peg trays 18 are partly supported by the continuous conveyor 17 and partly by the rail 19. Since the peg trays 18 are permanently connected with the continuous conveyor 17 they cannot fall off the frame and they cannot be taken off unwantedly.<br><br>
In all the following figures the same reference numbers are used to refer to the corresponding elements as referred to in the embodiment described above.<br>
According to figures 3 and 4, in which also a motor 27 driving a redirecting roller 26 is indicated, the peg trays 18 consist of a guide support part 18" and a peg support part 18"".Onto each of said peg trays a tube peg 13 and a supplemental peg 23 are fastened behind each other in the conveying direction. The guide support part 18" and the peg support part 18"" are connected with each other via a hinge-type joint, preferably, however, by an elastically flexible connection whose axis 24 is being arranged parallel to the conveying direction.<br>
The guide support part 18" is supported via a guide recess 22 on a rail 19 fixedly connected to the machine frame 25 and alongside of said machine frame in such a way that it provides a form-closed sliding connection with the support rail 19.<br>
At a space beside the support rail 19, below the peg trays 18, a supplemental support rail 19" is arranged, which is also fixedly arranged alongside of the machine frame and which runs parallel to the support rail 19. Said supplemental rail serves to support that end part of the peg support part 18"" which is extending to the left of the axis 24 (figure 4). The supplemental rail 19" is arranged for changing its position of height along the conveying path in such a way, that the peg support parts 18"" can vary their angle a  with respect to the guide support part 18", for instance between 60 and 85°. This way the peg support parts 18"" can assume an inclined position while they are located alongside the spinning units 11, shown by solid lines in figure 4, however, in the area of the station 12 for unloading full tubes and loading empty tubes (figure 1) they can be lifted into an almost horizontal position, as is indicated by dotted lines in figure 4.<br><br>
The continuous conveyor 17 being designed as a vertically arranged conveying belt engages on the guide support parts 18" in the way shown in figures 3 and 4 and fullfils solely a conveying function. Preferably the continuous conveyor 17 itself is also supported in vertical direction on the support rail 19 via the guide support part 18" .<br>
According to figures 5 and 6 a steel wire rope 17 is used as a continuous conveyor which can run below the tube pegs and the supplemental pegs 13, 23 arranged behind each other. Said rope is fixedly held in a locking projection 18""" provided underneath each peg tray 18.<br>
According to a first embodiment the correspondingly tightly stretched steel wire rope 17 can carry the peg trays 18. For that, however, the trays should be guided by lateral guides 20 according to figure 5. It is also possible that the locking projection 18""" for the steel wire rope extends down to the bottom of the U-shaped structural part, which carries the lateral guides 20, as is indicated in a dotted line in figure 6, where it could slide and whereby the peg tray is also supported in vertical direction.<br>
According to a further embodiment shown in figure 6 a U-shaped support rail 19 can be provided below the peg tray 18, wherein runs the steel wire rope 17 and whose upper edges serve as sliding support for the trays 18. By means of lateral projections at the steel wire rope locking projection 18""", indicacted in dotted lines, additionally a lateral guidance can also be realised.<br>
According to figure 7 the peg tray 18 comprises a horizontal plate-shaped base part 18"""" carrying the pegs 13, 23 beside each other. One of said base parts consists of a guide support part 18" with a guide recess 22, which encloses a support rail 19 that is fixedly arranged on the machine frame, similarly to the way shown in figure 4.<br><br>
On its lower side opposite of the base part 18"""", the guide part 18" is connected with the continuous conveyor which consists of a vertically positioned steel band 17.<br>
Figure 8 describes a similar embodiment, whereby however, the continuous conveyor 17, being made as a vertical steel band, is located within a space 28 of the support rail 19 which is fixedly arranged on the machine frame. By means of an engaging projection 29 said conveyor is in engagement with the guide support part 18" of the peg tray 18.<br>
Figure 9 shows a variation of the object according to figure 8, in that the vertical continuous conveyor band 17 is being arranged below the base part 18"""", where it is engaged with a projection of the lower area of the guide support part 18".<br>
According to figure 10 the peg tray 18 is furnished at its lower side with a guide recess whereby said recess is being arranged symmetrically to the pegs 13, 23. Via the recess the peg tray is being carried on a vertically arranged support rail 19 extending in conveying direction and whereon the peg tray is in sliding engagement with said rail. Furthermore the continuous conveyor 17 is furnished with an engaging projection 29 for engagement with the peg tray 18.<br>
According to figure 11 a steel wire rope 17, forming the continuous conveyor, extends parallel to a support rail 19, which is fixedly arranged on the frame. The rail has a T-shaped cross section and is in sliding engagement with a guide recess 22 on the lower side of the peg tray 18. The steel wire rope of the conveyor is fixedly connected to the peg trays 18 through connecting links 20. The top view of said embodiment is illustrated in figures 12 and 13.<br>
To facilitate the movement of the peg trays 18 around the corner area of the redirecting rollers 26, the T-shaped support rails 19 are replaced by a bent piece of guide wire 19", which only<br><br>
engages as a guide with the radially inner periphery of the recess 22 of the peg trays 18. At the straight sections of the conveying path, that means also in the area of the station 12 for unloading full tubes and loading empty tubes, however, the T-shaped support rails 19 are provided.<br><br>
