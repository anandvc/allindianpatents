BACKGROUND<br>
[0007] Recently there has been an increase in the demand for cheeses that have widely<br>
differing performance characteristics. This particular demand is driven in part by the<br>
increasing variety of prepared foods in which such cheeses are included. In fact, there often<br>
is a need for different performance qualities even for foods of the same general type because<br>
of the different ways cheeses are utilized or because the cheese is exposed to differing<br>
cooking environments or conditions. Pizzas illustrate this point well because there are so<br>
many different types of pizzas. Pizzas, for example, have widely differing crusts, including<br>
thick, thin, or somewhere in between. The cheese can also be exposed or wrapped in the<br>
edge of the crust. Furthermore, the crust may be completely uncooked or it may he parbaked<br>
before being put in the oven with the cheese. Each of these variables potentially impacts the<br>
composition of the cheese required to provide satisfactory performance.<br>
[0008] Demand for cheese with varying performance characteristics is also driven in part<br>
by the significant increase in the different types of baking equipment and conditions that are<br>
being used to prepare food products containing cheese. Some baking operations, for instance,<br>
require relatively high oven temperatures (e.g., in the range of about 350 to 950 °F (177- 510°<br>
C)) with short baking times (e.g., in the range of about 30 seconds to 15 minutes). Such<br>
conditions may be used, for instance, in an impingement oven when baking a pizza having a<br>
thin crust. Other ovens, such as deck ovens, in contrast, sometimes use a relatively long bake<br>
time (e.g.. about 6 to 60 minutes) and a correspondingly lower oven temperature (e.g., about<br>
300 to 750°F (149 to 399 ° C)). Instead of baking, some foods topped with or including<br>
cheese are prepared by microwaving (e.g., about 1-6 minutes).<br>
[0009] Consumer demand for cheeses with improved nutritional content (e.g., nutritionally<br>
balanced, lower fat) has also increased the demand for new varieties of cheese.<br>
[0010] There are a variety of challenges to providing cheeses that have a composition<br>
which satisfies the desired performance characteristics and nutritional qualities. For instance,<br>
it can be difficult to obtain the desired concentration level of some ingredients in a cheese.<br>
Another problem is developing a process that activates the latent functional properties of<br>
certain ingredients. Another problem is that many methods for preparing cheese involve the<br>
loss of significant quantities of some cheese components during processing. This can occur,<br>
for instance, when such cheeses undergo the heating and stretching process of the pasta filata<br>
process. Often the heating is conducted in heated water, which can remove significant<br>
amounts of cheese ingredients.<br>
[0011] In view of the high demand for cheese and the foregoing shortcomings associated<br>
with some existing methods for preparing such cheeses with the desired performance<br>
characteristics, there thus remains a need for additional methods for preparing cheeses of<br>
these types.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0012] Methods for preparing a variety of cheese products are disclosed. Systems for<br>
preparing such cheeses and slurries, and cheeses produced by the disclosed methods are also<br>
provided.<br>
[0013] Some of the cheese processing methods involve initially providing a slurry that<br>
comprises one or more ingredients that one seeks to incorporate into the final cheese product.<br>
The slurry is then combined with a cheese precursor to form an admixture. The resulting<br>
admixture is then processed to form the final cheese product. The slurry can be combined<br>
with a variety of cheese precursors including a cheese curd ingredient, a mixture of cheese<br>
curd ingredients, a coagulum, a cheese curd, a heated mass of cheese (e.g., a heated mass of<br>
cheese curd), a dry mixed cheese, or a same day diced cheese. In some methods, the slurry<br>
lacks a cheese curd. The slurry in other methods lacks one or more analog cheese ingredients<br>
(e.g., an oil, a fat, a protein, a starch, a sequestrant and/or a salt).<br>
[0014] A variety of ingredients can be incorporated into the slurry including, but not<br>
limited to, a nonfat dry milk, a milk protein, an acidity regulator, an acid, an anticaking agent,<br>
an antifoaming agent, a coloring agent, an emulsifier, an enzyme preparation, a flavoring<br>
agent, a firming agent, a food protein, a gelling agent, a preservative, sequestrants, a<br>
stabilizer, a starch, a thickener, an oil, a fat, a cheese powder, a salt, a nutritional supplement,<br>
an acid, an enzyme, a neutraceutical, a carbohydrate, a vitamin, and a mineral. Examples<br>
may further include procream, whey cream, a dairy solid, and foodstuffs of vegetable, fruit<br>
and/or animal source. The foodstuffs may include fruit, vegetables, nuts, meat, and spices,<br>
among other foodstuffs.<br>
[0015] In some methods, the slurry is processed before it is combined with the cheese<br>
precursor. Typical processing steps include one or more of the following processes: heating<br>
the slurry, subjecting the slurry to high shear conditions, homogenizing the slurry and<br>
adjusting the water content of the slurry.<br>
[0016] Other methods for preparing a cheese involve combining a slurry with a heated<br>
mass of cheese curd to form an admixture and then shaping and cooling the admixture to<br>
form the final cheese product. In some of these methods, the slurry contains sufficient starch,<br>
nonfat dry milk, gum or cellulose such that the cheese has one or more of the following<br>
characteristics (i) a starch concentration of about 0.5 to 20 wt %, or (ii) a nonfat dry milk<br>
concentration of about 0.5 to 25 wt %, or (iii) a gum or cellulose concentration of about 0.5 to<br>
20 wt %.<br>
[0017| Methods for preparing heated slurries that can be used in the preparation of cheeses<br>
are also described herein. Some of these methods involve blending together a liquid and one<br>
or more GRAS ingredients to form a slurry and then processing the slurry. Processing<br>
typically involves heating the slurry to a temperature of about 90 °F to about 300 °F and<br>
performing one or more additional processing steps selected from the group consisting of<br>
subjecting the slurry to high shear conditions, homogenizing the slurry and adjusting the<br>
moisture content of the slurry.<br>
(0018] Various systems for manufacturing a cheese product are provided. Some of these<br>
systems include a slurry preparation system that includes (i) a blender adapted to blend a<br>
liquid and one or more generally recognized as safe (GRAS) ingredients together to form a<br>
slurry, and (ii) a cooker that is operatively disposed to receive the slurry from the blender and<br>
adapted to heat the slurry to a temperature of about 90 °F to about 300 °F. These systems also<br>
include a first mixer operatively disposed to receive the slurry from the slurry preparation<br>
system and adapted to mix the slurry with a heated mass of cheese curd to form an admixture.<br>
A final processing system is also included which is operatively disposed to receive the<br>
admixture and adapted to form a final cheese product.<br>
[0019] Such systems can optionally also include a slurry mixing and moisture control<br>
subsystem. These subsystems include one or more of the following units: (i) a shear pump<br>
adapted to subject the slurry to high shear conditions; (ii) a homomgenizer adapted to<br>
homogenize the water and the one or more ingredients in the slurry; and (iii) an evaporator<br>
adapted to adjust the water content of the slurry to about 5-95 % by weight. The subsystem<br>
in these systems is in communication with the cooker and the first mixer and the units within<br>
the subsystem are in fluid communication.<br>
[0020] The arrangement of some subsystems is such that the shear pump is operatively<br>
disposed to receive the slurry from the heater and is in communication with the homogenizer.<br>
The homogenizer in turn is operatively disposed between the shear pump and the evaporator<br>
and adapted to receive the slurry from the shear pump. The evaporator is operatively<br>
disposed to receive the slurry from the homogenizer and in communication with the first<br>
mixer.<br>
[0021 j Some systems also include a second dry or wet mixer that (i) is adapted to heat and<br>
knead a mass of cheese curd that is introduced therein, and (ii) is in communication with the<br>
first mixer such that the heated mass of cheese that is produced in the first mixer can be<br>
transported to the second mixer.<br>
[0022] Slurry preparation systems are also provided. Certain of these systems include a (a)<br>
blender adapted for preparing a slurry, the slurry comprising water and one or more generally<br>
recognized as safe (GRAS) ingredients, (b) a cooker adapted to heat the slurry to a<br>
temperature of about 90 °F to about 300 °F; and (c) a slurry mixing and moisture control<br>
subsystem. The subsystem itself includes one or more of the following units (i)a shear pump<br>
adapted to subject the slurry to high shear conditions; (ii) a homogenizer adapted to mix the<br>
water and the one or more ingredients in the slurry; and (iii)an evaporator unit adapted to<br>
adjust the water content of the slurry to about 5-95 % by weight. In such subsystems, the<br>
units making up the subsystem are in fluid communication and the blender, heater and slurry<br>
mixing and control subsystem are in fluid communication.<br>
[0023] A variety of cheeses (e.g., a soft or firm/semi-hard ripened or unripened cheese<br>
product) are provided. Some of these have one or more of the following characteristics (i) a<br>
nonfat dry milk concentration of greater than 11% by weight, or (ii) a starch concentration of<br>
greater than 11 % by weight, or (iii) a gum or cellulose concentration of greater than 11 % by<br>
weight. Some of these have one or more of the following characteristics (i) a nonfat dry milk<br>
concentration of greater than 10% by weight, or (ii) a starch concentration of greater than<br>
10% by weight, (iii) a gum or cellulose concentration of greater than 10% by weight.<br>
[0024] Slurries of different compositions are also provided that can be used in the<br>
preparation of cheese. Some slurries, for instance, have a temperature of about 90 °F to about<br>
300 °F and have one or more of the following characteristics (i) a starch concentration of at<br>
least 12 wt %, or (ii) a dairy solid concentration of at least 12 wt %.<br>
[0025] A variety of cheeses (e.g., a soft or firm/semi-hard ripened or unripened cheese<br>
product) are provided. Some of these have one or more ingredients added in the form of (i) a<br>
slurry of varying composition, and/or (ii) a dry powder used in the preparation of cheese.<br>
Some cheeses, for instance have ingredients added via the slurry such that 0.5-25% of an<br>
ingredient is added in the final cheese. Other cheeses may have ingredients added via a dry<br>
powder such that 0.5 to 15% of an ingredient is added in the final cheese. And still other<br>
cheese may have both a slurry and a dry powder added simultaneously such that the<br>
combination of slurry and powder result in ingredient amounts of about 0.5 to 25%.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
I. Definitions<br>
[0031] A "soft or firm/semi-hard cheese" as used herein generally includes cheeses that<br>
have a percentage moisture on a fat free basis (MFFB) of about 54% or more, by weight. The<br>
term includes firm/semi-hard cheeses that have a MFFB, for example, of about 54% to about<br>
80%, by wt, and chesses with a MFFB, for example, of about 58% to about 75%, by wt. The<br>
term may also include soft cheeses with a MFFB of greater than about 60%, by wt. The term<br>
encompasses a variety of well known cheeses including, but not limited to, Colby, Havarti,<br>
Monterey Jack, Gorgonzola, Gouda, Cheshire and Muenster, which are examples of<br>
'firm/semi-hard cheeses." Also included in the term are popular "soft cheeses" such as<br>
Mozzarella, cream cheese, and cottage cheese. A variety of mozzarella cheeses are included<br>
by the term; these can be in the soft or firm/semi-hard category, or in between the two,<br>
depending upon their moisture content. Standard mozzarella, for example, is a soft cheese,<br>
part-skim mozzarella is between soft and firm/semi-hard, and low-moisture mozzarella and<br>
low-moisture part-skim mozzarella are both designated as firm/semi-hard cheeses. The term<br>
soft or firm/semi-hard as used herein includes cheeses meeting the CODEX definition of a<br>
soft or firm/semi-hard cheese. The term also includes soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses as<br>
defined bv other local, regional, national or international agencies or organizations.<br>
[0032] Cheeses within the "soft or firm/semi-hard" category as defined herein can be<br>
prepared using a variety of methods, including conventional methods, as well as by<br>
"alternative make" provisions. The term includes, for instance, cheeses made by a process in<br>
which a cheese curd is heated and kneaded to improve the stretchability or stringiness of the<br>
final cheese, provided the cheese falls within the MFFB parameters set above. This process<br>
and related processes are sometimes referred to as a pasta filata process of manufacturing.<br>
Cheeses made by this process are known under a variety of names, including mozzarella,<br>
pasta filata, provolone, Mexican style, scamorze, and pizza cheese. Cheeses made by<br>
alternative make procedures are prepared by alternative methods of making cheeses, so long<br>
as the procedure produces a cheese having the same physical and chemical properties of the<br>
type of cheese made by a specified process (e.g., aprocess specified by a regulatory agency)<br>
and falls within the MFFB parameters set forth above.<br>
[0033] The "soft" and "firrn/serm-hard" cheeses that are provided include standard and non-<br>
standard cheeses and cheese products having the foregoing moisture characteristics. Standard<br>
cheeses are those that satisfy the standards as set forth by a regulatory body with respect to a<br>
particular type of cheese. A non-standard cheese is one whose composition does not meet the<br>
standard. A soft or firm/semi-hard cheese can also be a processed cheese. A soft or<br>
firrn/semi-hard cheese can also be ripened or unripened.<br>
[0034] "Mozzarella" cheese has a minimum milkfat content of 45% by weight of the solids<br>
and a moisture content of more than 52% but not more than 60% by weight. "Low-moisture<br>
mozzarella" cheeses have a minimum milkfat content of 45% by weight of the solids and the<br>
moisture content is more than 45% but not more than 52% by weight. "Part-skim<br>
mozzarella" has a moisture content of more than 52% but not more than 60% by weight, and<br>
a milk fat content that is less than 45% but not less than 30% calculated on the solids basis.<br>
"Low-moisture part-skim" mozzarella has a moisture content of more than 45% but not more<br>
than 52% by weight and a milkfat content, calculated on the solids basis, of less than 45% but<br>
not less than 30%. Further details regarding these various mozzarella cheeses is provided by<br>
21 C.F.R. §1.33.155-133.158.<br>
[0035] The term "cheese precursor" as used herein refers broadly to any ingredient that is<br>
used to prepare a cheese curd, mixtures of such ingredients and subsequent processed forms<br>
of the chsese curd other than the final cheese product. Examples of cheese precursors that<br>
are ingredients include, but are not limited to, unpasteurized milk (sometimes referred to in<br>
the industry as "raw milk"), the growth medium and bacteria used in the cheese making<br>
process (sometimes referred to in the industry as "starter"), and cream. Mixtures of such<br>
ingredients are also included. One specific example of such mixtures is "vat liquid", which is<br>
a term used to refer to a combination of pasteurized milk, starter and cream. The term also<br>
includes coagulum, cheese curd, and processed cheese curd (e.g., curd that has been heated<br>
and/or stretched to form a homogeneous mass of cheese).<br>
[0036] The term "cream" means the liquid milk product high in fat separated from milk<br>
which may have been adjusted by adding thereto: milk, concentrated milk, dry whole milk,<br>
skim milk, concentrated skim milk, nonfat dry milk or other GRAS ingredients. "Whey<br>
cream" is the liquid milk product high in fat separated from whey (cheese, casein, or other),<br>
which may have been adjusted, by adding thereto: whey, concentrated whey, dry whey, or<br>
other GRAS ingredients. "Procream" is the liquid milk product high in fat collected as<br>
retentate from a whey filtration process such as microfiltration which may have been adjusted<br>
by adding thereto: whey, concentrated whey, dry whey, or other GRAS ingredients.<br>
[0037] The term "curd precursor" refers to any soft or firm/serni-hard cheese ingredient,<br>
mixture or composition that exists or is formed prior to formation of the cheese curd. The<br>
term thus includes, for example, raw milk, starter, cream, cheese vat liquids and coagulum.<br>
II. Overview<br>
[0038] Methods for preparing a variety of different types of cheeses are provided, including<br>
for example, soft or firm/semi-hard ripened and unripened cheese. The methods that are<br>
provided generally involve combining a slurry with a cheese precursor to form an admixture<br>
that is subsequently processed to form the final product. The slurry typically contains a<br>
liquid (e.g., water, milk and/or cream) and one or more ingredients (added either as a liquid<br>
or a dry powder, for example) that are selected in accord with the final cheese product that is<br>
desired. Once the slurry and cheese precursor are thoroughly mixed together, the resulting<br>
admixture is processed to yield the final soft or firrn/semi-hard cheese product. Systems for<br>
preparing such cheeses and slurries are also disclosed.<br>
[0039] The methods, for instance, can be used to introduce various ingredients, either in the<br>
slurry and/or with another component of the cheese, to control: 1) melt and fiowability of the<br>
final cheese product, which is a measure of how well the cheese melts and flows into a<br>
homogenous mass, preferably with little or no individual shreds of cheese still detectable; 2)<br>
stretch, which is measure of the ability of the cheese to form interconnected strings when the<br>
heated cheese is pulled; 3) texture, which is a measure of chewiness and smoothness; 4)<br>
coloring, which is a measure of the actual color of the melted cheese; 5) blister<br>
characteristics, which may include size, color and extent of coverage; and/or 6) nutritional<br>
composition.<br>
[0040] The use of a slurry in the methods disclosed herein may also provide significant<br>
improvements in yield. A typical cheese process in its basic approach involves acidifying<br>
and coagulating milk to form a coagulum that contains cheese curd and whey, removing the<br>
whey from the curd, and then processing the curd into a final cheese product. The whey that<br>
is removed in conventional cheese manufacturing often contains many dissolved or<br>
suspended ingredients, which often means that a significant quantity of dissolved substances<br>
(e.g., protein, fat, carbohydrate and minerals) are lost when the whey is separated from the<br>
curd. If any ingredients are added before the whey is separated from the curd, many of these<br>
ingredients, because they are at least partially soluble in the whey fraction, are also lost.<br>
[0041] As a specific example of the extent of this problem, for each 100 pounds of milk<br>
that is used to prepare a cheese, it is not uncommon using conventional cheese manufacturing<br>
techniques to only be able to produce 10 pounds of cheese. By using some of the slurry-<br>
based methods that are disclosed herein, the yield can be increased in some instances to about<br>
15,18, 20 22, or 50 or more pounds of cheese for each 100 pounds of milk. Thus, with some<br>
methods, the yield can be increased by 1.5-2 times or more. The increase in yield is due in<br>
part to the use of slurries that allow ingredients to be integrated into a precursor of the final<br>
cheese product when essentially all the ingredients in the slurry are retained, as compared to<br>
earlier in the process in which a significant proportion of added ingredients are lost.<br>
[0042] One approach is to add the nonfat dry milk to the milk that is used to prepare the<br>
cheese. If added at this stage, it is not uncommon for about 75% of the nonfat dry milk to be<br>
lost, including proteins, lactose and minerals in the nonfat dry milk. If the nonfat dry milk is<br>
instead incorporated into some of the slurries that are provided and the resulting slurry mixed,<br>
for instance, into a cheese precursor (e.g., a homogenized mass of cheese curd) as described<br>
herein, much, if not essentially all, of the nonfat dry milk may be incorporated into the final<br>
cheese product.<br>
[0043] In some methods, the slurry is processed so it is in a form that confers useful<br>
properties on the final cheese product and/or facilitates preparation of the cheese. Some<br>
methods, for instance, utilize a heated slurry that may also have been sheared and/or<br>
homogenized. Such processing can influence the performance of the final cheese product in<br>
various ways. For example, this processing can be used to achieve higher concentrations of<br>
certain ingredients in the final cheese product as compared to traditional approaches.<br>
Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the shearing and homogenization<br>
process can reduce particle size of the components of some cheese ingredients. These<br>
resulting particles because of their reduced size are thus better able to become incorporated<br>
into the overall cheese matrix, thereby allowing more ingredient to be introduced into the<br>
final cheese product.<br>
[0044] The reduced particle size also makes it easier to remove excess water during the<br>
manufacturing process to the level desired in later manufacturing stages. The ability to<br>
control water content is an important factor in being able to regulate the stability of cheese<br>
and thus its shelf life. Reduced particle size also facilitates forming a compact cheese that<br>
can be easily processed (e.g., shredded, sliced, or diced). Shearing and homogenization can<br>
also be important in reducing the viscosity of the slurry, which aids in various processing<br>
steps (e.g., transport of the slurry).<br>
(0045] Use of a slurry that has been heated, sheared and/or homogenized during the<br>
manufacturing process also is useful in activating, exposing the functionality and/or in<br>
hydrating the ingredients, such that the ingredient has different properties than the<br>
corresponding unheated ingredients. As a specific example, it can be difficult to incorporate<br>
nonfat dry milk into a cheese as a dry powder in certain cheese manufacturing methods<br>
because the nonfat dry milk never becomes fully hydrated. This makes the nonfat dry milk<br>
susceptible to burning when cooked, for example. By using certain of the slurry-based<br>
methods disclosed herein, ingredients such as nonfat dry milk can be better hydrated, thus<br>
mitigating against the burning problem. The hydration of other ingredients can have other<br>
beneficial results.<br>
[0046] Some methods also involve a process in which the water content of the slurry is<br>
adjusted. This is useful because the water content in a cheese is an important factor in<br>
stability, shelf life and the ability to slice, shred and dice the final cheese product.<br>
[0047] In sum, the use of slurries to introduce ingredients into cheeses at certain stages of<br>
the manufacturing process can be used to help tailor the performance and nutritional<br>
characteristics of the final cheese product.<br>
III. Methods for Preparing Soft or Firm/Semi-hard Cheese<br>
A. General<br>
[0048] FIG. 1 provides a flow diagram that summarizes one general scheme 10 for<br>
preparing a cheese product, such as a soft or firm/semi-hard cheese. As this figure indicates,<br>
some methods involve providing a slurry 12 that contains one or more ingredients. The<br>
ingredients in the slurry are selected to in accordance with the final cheese product that is<br>
desired and are described in detail below. The slurries in the methods described herein<br>
typically do not contain curd and thus lack cheese curd, but may, for example, instead include<br>
other ingredients selected to impart a taste, performance and/or nutritional characteristic on<br>
the final cheese product (e.g., mouthfeel, blister size, melt characteristic, texture or color).<br>
Some slurries also do not contain ingredients that are commonly used in the preparation of<br>
analog cheese. Methods using such slurries thus typically omit one or more or all of the<br>
following: an oil, a fat, a protein, a starch, a sequestrant and a salt. Other methods, however,<br>
utilize slurries that contain some or all of these ingredients. The slurry is combined 14 with a<br>
cheese precursor to form an admixture. This admixture is then processed 16 to form the final<br>
cheese product.<br>
[0049] Another example of a general method is shown in FIG. 2A. This process 20<br>
involves providing 22 a slurry that contains one or more ingredients and providing 24 a<br>
cheese precursor. In this particular method, the cheese precursor (e.g., milk, cream,<br>
coagulum and/or curd) is mixed 26 with one or more ingredients. This mixture is then<br>
combined 28 with the slurry to form an admixture. Additional ingredients can subsequently<br>
be added 30 to the admixture, thus providing another opportunity to control the composition<br>
of the final cheese product. The admixture is then subjected to final processing 32 to obtain<br>
the desired cheese product. Although the method in FIG. 2A includes two processes in which<br>
additional ingredients are added (i.e., processes 26 and 30), other methods include only one<br>
or neither of these processes.<br>
[0050) FIG. 2B presents a variation of the general method shown in FIG.2A. In this<br>
method 30, a cheese precursor is provided 24, mixed 26 with one or more ingredients and<br>
then combined 28 with a slurry 22 to form an admixture. In contrast to the method shown in<br>
FIG. 2A, however, the resulting admixture is then divided 29 into multiple portions (e.g., a<br>
first and second admixture). Each admixture is then processed separately. For instance, a<br>
first ingredient or set of ingredients can be added 30a to the first admixture portion and the<br>
resulting mixture further processed 32a to form a first cheese product. A second ingredient or<br>
set of ingredients (typically different from the first ingredient or ingredient set) is then added<br>
30b to the second admixture portion and then subjected to further processing 32b to form a<br>
second final cheese product. This approach is useful, for instance, to prepare different<br>
cheeses with similar base compositions but somewhat different ingredients. Although FIG.<br>
2B shows a method in which the initial admixture is divided into only two separate portions,<br>
it should be understood that the initial admixture could be divided into a greater number of<br>
portions with parallel processing of each portion as indicated in FIG. 2B. Further, although<br>
the method in FIG. 2B shows ingredients being added 26 to the cheese precursor before the<br>
cheese precursor and slurry are mixed, this step need not be performed in all methods.<br>
[0051] A second variation of the method shown in FIG. 2A is depicted in FIG. 2C. In this<br>
method 40, the providing 22, 24 and mixing 26 processes are as described with respect to<br>
FIG. 2A. In this particular method, however, once the slurry and cheese precursor have been<br>
combined 28, multiple ingredients are added in a serial process (as compared to the parallel<br>
process illustrated in FIG. 2B). Thus, for example, one or more first ingredients are added 30<br>
to form an initial admixture and then one or more second ingredients added 31 to form a final<br>
admixture, which is subsequently further processed 32 to form the final cheese product. The<br>
first and second ingredient can be the same or different. The first and second ingredient can<br>
also be a single ingredient or a plurality of ingredients. It should further be understood that<br>
although FIG. 2C illustrates a method in which there are two serial additions of ingredients<br>
that more serial additions could be made.<br>
[0052] Methods of the general type shown in FIG. 2C are useful, for example, when<br>
separate additions of ingredients allows for improved incorporation into the cheese {e.g.,<br>
adding all the ingredients at once may prevent the ingredients from becoming fully mixed<br>
into the admixture).<br>
[0053] The various primary processes involved in the methods that are provided, such as<br>
those described in FIGS. 1 and 2A-2C, are discussed in detail in the following sections.<br>
1. Slurry Preparation and Pre-Mixing Process<br>
[0054] The process of providing the slurry can comprise several aspects. Some methods,<br>
for example, generally involve blending a liquid (e.g., water, oil, milk and/or cream) and one<br>
or more ingredients to form the slurry. The resulting slurry is then subjected to a pre-mixing<br>
process to adjust the slurry to a form that will integrate well with the cheese precursor with<br>
which the slurry is mixed. The pre-mixing process usually includes cooking the slurry,<br>
typically to about 90-300 °F, 90-293 °F or 100-250 °F (38-121° C), but this is not mandatory.<br>
This pre-mixing processing also optionally includes one, two or all of the following<br>
processes: (1) subjecting the slurry to high shear conditions, (2) homogenizing the slurry,<br>
and/or (3) adjusting the water content of the slurry, usually to about 5-95%, or 15-80% by<br>
weight. As noted above, these processes are helpful in controlling processing parameters and<br>
the ultimate performance characteristics of the final cheese product.<br>
[0055] Different methods can incorporate different combinations of two or all three of the<br>
foregoing optional processes. So, for example, in some methods, the pre-mixing processing<br>
involves (1) and (2) but not (3). Other processes include (1) and (3) but not (2). Still other<br>
pre-mixing processes include (2) and (3) but not (1). And still other processes include (1), (2)<br>
and (3). The other remaining combinations can also be utilized depending upon the particular<br>
requirements of an application. In some instances, it is sufficient to simply shear the slurry<br>
without homogenizing it. But the pre-mixing process may involve both, in which case the<br>
slurry is first typically sheared and then homogenized, although the order can be reversed.<br>
[0056] In some methods, some of the pre-mixing processes are optionally carried out at the<br>
same time (e.g., subjecting the slurry to high shear conditions while homogenizing the slurry;<br>
or heating the slurry while subjecting it to high shear conditions and/or homogenizing the<br>
slurry). Cooking can optionally be performed during the shearing and/or homogenizing. In<br>
general, however, the pre-mixing processing steps conclude by adjusting the water content of<br>
the slurry.<br>
[0057] Some ingredients need to be subjected to high shear conditions to become<br>
functional (e.g., hydrated or converted to a form that displays functional binding groups).<br>
High shear conditions as used herein generally refers to conditions in which 10,000 to<br>
500,000 s-1 of shear is applied. In some methods, the slurry is typically sheared by a high-<br>
shear mixer or colloid mill, at a temperature of about 90 to 293° F (15 to 82° C) for about<br>
0.01 to 0.5 seconds.<br>
[0058] Homogenization of the slurry, if performed, generally involves the process of<br>
reducing the particle size of fluid products under conditions of extreme pressure, shear,<br>
turbulence, acceleration and impact, to make them more stable and have a better texture. The<br>
effect is typically achieved by forcing the slurry through a special homogenizing valve at a<br>
very high pressure. Homogenization can be done in one or multiple steps. For most<br>
methods, two steps are sufficient. It is common that the main homogenization takes place in<br>
the first homogenization valve and a mild homogenization in the second valve. The second<br>
homogenization valve can enhance the product quality. This step, for example, can break<br>
down newly formed fat globule clusters formed directly after the first valve due to re-<br>
agglomeration. Homogenization is usually conducted at a temperature of about 90-293 °F<br>
(32-145° C) or 100-250 °F (38-121° C) for about 0.01 to 0.5 seconds.<br>
[0059] As indicated above, if the water content of the slurry is adjusted, the moisture<br>
content is generally adjusted to about 5-95 percent, in some instances from about 15-80<br>
percent, in other instances 20-75%, and in still other instances 30-60%. After such<br>
processing, the slurry that is mixed with the cheese precursor, generally has a temperature of<br>
about 100-180° F (37-83° C), or about 120-165° F (48-74° C). It also typically has a<br>
viscosity of 1000 to greater than about 1,000,000 centipoise in this temperature range.<br>
2. Exemplary Methods for Providing Cheese Precursor<br>
[0060] As noted above, various cheese ingredients or mixtures thereof can serve as the<br>
cheese precursor. Other cheese precursors include compositions formed during processing of<br>
the starting ingredients, including, for example: 1) the pasteurized milk; 2) cheese milk<br>
formed by the acidification of the pasteurized milk; 3) the coagulum formed during the<br>
coagulation process; and/or 4) the cheese curd.<br>
[0061 ] Cheese curd can be prepared, for example, from pasteurized cow's milk, buffalo<br>
milk, goat's milk, or other milk source (e.g., concentrated milk, reconstituted milk or milk<br>
protein powders). The milk is acidified to form cheese milk. The acidification step can be<br>
performed either microbially or directly, or by a combination of both microbial and direct<br>
acidification. Microbial acidification is accomplished by the addition of a starter culture of<br>
one or more lactic acid-producing bacteria to the milk, and then allowing the bacteria to grow<br>
and multiply. When making a mozzarella variety cheese, a bacterial starter culture composed<br>
of coccus, rods, or a combination of both is preferably used. In some methods of<br>
acidification, an acid added as a processing aid, such as acetic acid (e.g., vinegar), phosphoric<br>
acid, citric acid, lactic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or glucono-delta lactone (GdL),<br>
lactobionic acid, etc., is added to standardize pH and is followed by addition of microbial<br>
starter to complete the acidification process.<br>
[0062] Following addition of the microbial and/or GRAS acids, the cheese milk is<br>
coagulated to form a coagulum that consists of cheese curd and whey. Rennet, or another<br>
suitable enzyme, is typically added to the milk to enhance the coagulation activity. The<br>
resulting coagulum is cut and the whey drained off to obtain the cheese curd. The curd can<br>
optionally be scalded (cooked) for about 0.08 to 1.0 hours at about 86-120° F (30-49° C) °C.<br>
[0063] When dairy milk is used as a precursor, the sweet cream fraction of the milk, or a<br>
portion thereof, may be separated and replaced by other types of creams and/or fats prior to<br>
acidification. For example, the sweet cream may be replaced by whey cream and/or pro-<br>
cream {i.e., a mixture of protein and cream) that is included with the whey fraction that is<br>
separated from the cheese curd. The replacement of the dairy sweet cream, or a portion<br>
thereof, with the whey cream and pro-cream reduces waste by making use of the whey cream<br>
and pro-cream, as well as making the higher value sweet cream available for sale in the<br>
marketplace.<br>
[0064] In some methods, the cheese curd is heated and kneaded in a cooker/mixer to form a<br>
heated mass of cheese curd (also referred to simply as a heated mass of cheese). The heating<br>
and kneading process is generally done at a temperature of about 120-180°F (48-82° C) for a<br>
time of about 1-15 min. Typically, the resulting mass has a temperature from about 120-150°<br>
F (48-66° C). The heating and kneading process can be conducted simultaneously or<br>
separately.<br>
[0065] The heating and kneading process is generally conducted under low shear<br>
conditions. Heating can be conducted, for instance, in a kneading mixer/extruder via 1)<br>
immersion in hot water or brine, 2) direct steam injection, 3) indirect heating via an indirect<br>
heat exchanger, and/or 4) by microwave. The steam injection option generally involves<br>
releasing live steam into the kneading and stretching chamber. When live steam is used to<br>
heat the curd, the steam condensate is absorbed by the curd and forms part of the final mass<br>
of cheese. When using live steam in the mixer/cooker, typically the water content of the curd<br>
immediately prior to entering the mixer/cooker is about 45 to 65 wt.%, and sufficient steam is<br>
released into the kneading and stretching chamber such that the water content of the mass of<br>
cheese immediately after exiting the machine is up to about 5 percentage points higher, e.g.,<br>
about 0.5 to 10 points higher. Often, it will be about 2.5 to 8.5 points higher. So, for<br>
example, if the water content of the curd entering the machine is 45 wt.%, then usually the<br>
amount of injected steam that is used to bring the curd up to the necessary temperature to<br>
obtain a homogenous mass of cheese will be an amount that raises the water content to no<br>
more than about 55 wt.%. Indirect heating can be accomplished, for example, by conduction,<br>
through the wall of the kneading and stretching chamber, e.g., by use of a hot water jacket.<br>
[0066] In some methods, heating and kneading can be performed in the absence of any<br>
exogenous water. By "exogenous water" is meant water that is used to bathe the curd and<br>
which is subsequently separated from the homogenous cheese mass that is formed. A<br>
shortcoming of the use of exogenous water during the heating and kneading process is that,<br>
when the water is separated, valuable protein, fat, and other solids that otherwise would be<br>
bound up in the finished cheese are removed. Various cookers can be used to heat the cheese<br>
curd in this fashion. One option is the RotaTherm™ cooker available from Gold Peg<br>
International Pry. Ltd. (Moorabbin, Vic, Australia).<br>
[0067] Kneading is often accomplished by working the heated cheese curd with pressure<br>
via single or dual helical intermeshing screws. The whole of the heating and kneading step is<br>
sometimes referred to as a plasticization or pasta filata process, which refers to the heating of<br>
curd to around 120-155°F (48-69°C) and kneading the hot curd. Successful plasticization of<br>
the curd requires that the viscoelastic paracasein matrix undergoes limited flow and stretches<br>
without breaking. Plasticization is believed to be accompanied by changes at a<br>
microstructure level within the curd, including partial aggregation and tightening of the<br>
paracasein gel matrix followed by formation of linear paracasein fibers with high tensile<br>
strength. The cheese fat coalesces into elongated pools entrapped between paracasein fibers<br>
showing their same orientation. This process aids in obtaining the proper functionality in the<br>
final product.<br>
[0068] The heating and kneading process described herein ensure complete mixing of the<br>
heated curd. This is important because incomplete mixing results in the separation of fat and<br>
water and the loss of these ingredients, as well as other such as fat, lactose and minerals.<br>
3. Mixing of Slurry and Cheese Precursor<br>
[0069] The slurry is combined with a cheese precursor to form an admixture. So, for<br>
instance, the slurry can be combined at any stage along the process for preparing a soft or<br>
firm/semi-hard cheese as outlined in the preceding section. Mixing of the slurry with a<br>
cheese precursor can be accomplished using standard mixing apparatus that are known in the<br>
industry.<br>
[0070] In some methods, the slurry is mixed with a heated mass of soft or firm/semi-hard<br>
cheese that has undergone the heating and kneading process that is associated with the pasta<br>
filata process. For ease of reference, cheese curd that has undergone such a heating and<br>
kneading process is simply referred to herein as a "heated cheese mass." In methods such as<br>
this, the mixing typically is performed at a temperature of about 120 to about 170° F (49-77°<br>
C). The temperature in some applications is relatively high, such as between 150-170 °F. In<br>
other methods, the temperature is at or slightly below that of pasteurization (65° C, 150 °F),<br>
for example in the range of about 120-150° F. (49-65° C). Mixing is usually conducted for<br>
about 2-15 or 5-10 minutes. Mixing is generally performed under low shear conditions.<br>
[0071J Combining the slurry with the heated cheese mass is a useful approach because the<br>
slurry can be fully worked into the heated cheese mass with mininal loss of ingredients<br>
during the mixing process and subsequent processing steps. This thus is useful in reducing<br>
waste flow from the manufacturing process, thereby conferring significant cost benefits and<br>
reducing waste disposal issues.<br>
4. Optional Addition of Ingredients<br>
[0072] Some methods optionally involve the further addition of ingredients at points along<br>
the cheese preparation process other than the blending of ingredients with a liquid to form the<br>
initial slurry. Ingredients can be added, for example, to the cheese precursors listed above<br>
(e.g., to the curd ingredients, the coagulum and/or the cheese curd). These ingredients can be<br>
added as liquids and/or powders.<br>
[0073] In certain methods, ingredients are added to the heated cheese mass, the processed<br>
slurry (e.g., after the slurry has been heated, homogenized, sheared and/or the water content<br>
adjusted) or the admixture formed once the heated slurry and heated cheese mass are mixed<br>
together. These ingredients are often added in a dry form (e.g., as a powder), but in some<br>
instances can be added in liquid form. Powdered solids can be added using any of a number<br>
of conventional approaches, including sprinkling the solids onto the cheese mass, usually<br>
across the entire surface of the cheese mass and typically after application of agents or<br>
ingredients in liquid form, if any. Liquid agents or ingredients can be sprayed down onto the<br>
surface of the cheese mass as it passes through the mixing chamber, usually in a spray that<br>
covers substantially the entire surface of the cheese.<br>
5. Final Processing<br>
[0074] Once the slurry and cheese precursor have been combined, the admixture is further<br>
processed to obtain the desired final soft or firrn/serni-hard cheese product. The particular<br>
processing steps required, depend in part upon the cheese precursor with which the slurry is<br>
mixed. If the cheese precursor is a cheese ingredient such as milk or cream, for instance, then<br>
the final processing involves completing the cheese manufacturing process to form a cheese<br>
curd that contains the added slurry, followed by its further processing to yield the final<br>
product. If the slurry is mixed with a cheese curd, the slurry/curd mixture can optionally be<br>
heated and stretched in a pasta filata type process, or this mixture can be pressed together to<br>
form a final cheese product. Thus, in some instances, final processing simply involves<br>
compressing and molding the cheese curd using conventional cheese compression and<br>
molding operations to form a mass of cheese.<br>
[0075] If the process involves a heating of the cheese curd, the still-warm cheese (e.g., at a<br>
temperature in the range of about 110-175 °F (43-80° C)) can be formed into any desired<br>
shape depending upon the ultimate intended use. General options include, but are not limited<br>
to, 1) forming relatively large pieces of cheese which are packaged; 2) comminuting the<br>
cheese into smaller pieces that are packaged without freezing but instead refrigerated; 3)<br>
comminuting, packaging and freezing the cheese, and 4) comrninuting, freezing, then<br>
packaging the cheese.<br>
[0076] In some methods, for instance, the admixture is extruded as a continuous<br>
dimensionally flat Ribbon™, which is discharged into a cold sodium chloride brine channel<br>
or tank, for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,339,468 to Kielsmeier or U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,200,216 to Barz et al. (both of which art incorporated herein in their entirety). The cheese<br>
Ribbon™ is sometimes contacted with cold sodium chloride brine (in one or more tanks or<br>
vessels) until its core temperature drops to about 75° F (24° C) or below. Then the cooled<br>
Ribbon™ can be cut into segments having dimensions suitable for the intended use of the<br>
 cheese.<br>
[0077] Other options include: 1) floating the cheese in a coolant; 2) placing the cheese on a<br>
perforated belt and spraying coolant on the cheese surface; 3) placing the cheese on a solid<br>
belt and spraying coolant on the underside of the belt; 4) transfer through a cooling chamber;<br>
and 5) refrigeration of the heated cheese.<br>
[0078] If a string cheese is the desired product [e.g., a cheese having a diameter of about<br>
1/8 to 1.0 inch (0.32 to 2.54 cm.)], the segments of the string are generally about 1 1/2 to 12<br>
inches (410 30.5 cm) long. If the string cheese is to be baked only while enclosed in pizza<br>
crust (e.g., in a stuffed crust pizza), it typically is unnecessary to age the cheese before using<br>
it. If desired, the string cheese can be frozen and stored.<br>
[0079] The warm cheese can also be molded/extruded into blocks of any of a variety of<br>
sizes that are convenient. Some blocks, for example, are about 4 inches high, 4-8 inches<br>
wide, and 4-24 inches long.<br>
[0080] If the finished cheese is to be used as an exposed topping for a pizza, then the<br>
continuous Ribbon™, typically is rectangular in cross section, and can be cut into loaves, for<br>
example having a width of about 4 to 3 6 inches (10 to 92 cm.), a height of about 1/16 to 4<br>
inches (0.15 to 10 cm.), and a length of about 4 to 36 inches (10 to 92 cm.). The loaves can<br>
then be further cooled in sodium chloride brine, for example to a core temperature in the<br>
range of about 26 to 75° F (-16 to 24° C), and then removed from the brine and comminuted,<br>
and the pieces individually quick frozen, for example by the process described in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,030,470 to Kielsmeier, et al., which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0081] Depending on the composition of the cheese, it may be preferable to store it for a<br>
time [e.g., about 7 to 21 days, at about 3 5 to 45° F (2 to 7° C)] after it is removed from the last<br>
brine tank and before it is comminuted and frozen. However, as described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,200,216 (Barz et al.), if the process is controlled such that the cooled cheese removed from<br>
the brine has a moisture content of about 45 to 60 wt. %, a milk fat content of at least about<br>
30 wt. % (dried solids basis), and a combined moisture and wet milk fat content of at least<br>
about 70 wt. %, the cheese can be frozen immediately and will still perform satisfactorily<br>
when heated under a variety of conditions.<br>
[0082] The final processing procedure can also be as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,902,625, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.<br>
[0083] Methods based on the foregoing processes can be conducted in a batch format or<br>
continuously. Batch methods, for example, involve providing batches of slurry and cheese<br>
precursor that are subsequently combined in batches. The resulting mixtures are<br>
subsequently processed to obtain the desired final cheese product. The process is then<br>
repeated.<br>
[0084] In continuous methods, at least the slurry preparation process and the process in<br>
which the slurry is combined with the cheese precursor is conducted in a continuous process.<br>
In some methods, essentially each of the steps listed above are conducted continuously such<br>
that slurry preparation, cheese precursor preparation, combining of the slurry and precursor,<br>
optional addition of ingredients, and final processing steps are all continuously ongoing.<br>
B. Exemplary Methods<br>
[0085] FIG. 3 A provides a specific example of a method in which a heated slurry and<br>
heated cheese mass are combined to form an admixture that can subsequently be processed to<br>
yield a final cheese product, such as a soft or finn/semi-hard cheese product. As noted<br>
above, in some instances the slurry is heated because this can be useful in increasing the<br>
amount of certain ingredients that can be incorporated into the final cheese product and in<br>
unmasking the functionality of some ingredients.<br>
[0086] This particular method 100 includes a slurry preparation process 105 in which a<br>
liquid (e.g., water, milk and/or cream) and one or more ingredients are blended 110 together<br>
to form the initial slurry. The pre-mixing process 107 involves cooking/heating 115 the<br>
resulting slurry to a temperature of about 90-300 °F. This heated slurry is subsequently<br>
subjected 120 to high shear conditions and then homogenized 125 to obtain a slurry in which<br>
the ingredients are of the desired particle size. Thereafter, the water content of the heated<br>
slurry is adjusted 130, typically to about 5-95 wt. %. The slurry is transferred to the<br>
combining and mixing state 170 through the use of a pump at the discharge of a surge hopper,<br>
which maintains the slurry at a constant volume 131. As the slurry is transferred, it may be<br>
filtered 132 to remove any large particles formed in the slurry during the cooking/heating step<br>
115 (or other extraneous materials), and also exposed to a magnetic field 133 to remove any<br>
metal fragments in the slurry generated by metal to metal contact of the moving parts of the<br>
process equipment.<br>
[0087] As further shown in FIG. 3A, the process of providing 150 a cheese precursor in this<br>
particular method involves several processes to obtain a heated cheese mass. The process is<br>
initiated by forming 155 a cheese curd. Once formed, the cheese curd is heated and kneaded<br>
160 to form a heated cheese mass. During the heating process, the curd is typically heated to<br>
about 120-155 °F.<br>
[0088] Once the heated slurry and heated cheese mass have been formed, they are mixed<br>
170 together to form an admixture. This particular method includes a process of mixing in<br>
175 one or more optional ingredients into the admixture. But as noted above, such additions<br>
are optional and not all methods include this process. Furthermore, although this particular<br>
method shows the additional ingredients being added to the admixture of slurry and heated<br>
cheese mass, the ingredients could also be added to the slurry or to the heated cheese mass<br>
just prior to mixing. Alternatively, the slurry, heated cheese mass and ingredients can be<br>
combined simultaneously. The admixture that is formed is subsequently processed 180 to<br>
form the final soft or firm/semi-hard cheese product. In the particular method depicted in<br>
FIG. 3A, final processing 180 involves shaping 185 the admixture into a desired form and<br>
cooling 190 the shaped cheese to form the final cheese product. Although FIG. 3A shows the<br>
final processing step to first involve the shaping process followed by the cooling process, this<br>
order can be reversed or performed simultaneously.<br>
[0089] Although the particular method illustrated in FIG. 3 A shows the slurry and heated<br>
cheese mass being mixed together, in other methods the slurry is mixed with another cheese<br>
precursor (e.g., milk, coagulum or unprocessed cheese curd). Systems for performing such<br>
methods are shown in FIG. 4C.<br>
[0090] Another example of a method for preparing soft or firm/semi-hard cheese is shown<br>
in FIG. 3B. In general, method 102 illustrates certain methods in which a curd or a curd<br>
precursor is combined with the slurry, instead of a heated mass of cheese. In the method<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3B, a slurry is provided 105 as described with respect to FIG. 3 A. The<br>
process of providing 150 a cheese precursor in methods of this type, however, involves<br>
providing 151 a curd or curd precursor. In this particular method, one or more additional<br>
ingredients can be mixed 152 into the curd or curd precursor, but not all methods include<br>
such additions. The curd or curd precursor is then combined 153 with the slurry to form an<br>
admixture. The resulting mixture may then be heated and kneaded 171 to form a heated mass<br>
of cheese as in a pasta filata process. Method 102 also includes a process in which one or<br>
more additional ingredients are added 162 and mixed 172 with the admixture. Here, too,<br>
however, not all methods include such additions. The admixture is then processed 180 to<br>
form the final soft or firm/semi-hard cheese product.<br>
[0091J The final processing 180 of each of the exemplary methods shown in FIGS. 3A and<br>
3B can involve any of the processing options described above or generally known in the art.<br>
So, for example, in some methods final processing involves individually quick freezing<br>
pieces of the cheese as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,030,470. Other methods involve a<br>
same day dice procedure such as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,200,216. In<br>
still other methods, the cheese is not comminuted but formed into blocks that are directly<br>
packaged and refrigerated. Those of skill will recognize that a variety of other processing<br>
options are available. Further examples are provided in the section on "Final Processing"<br>
above.<br>
IV. Ingredients<br>
A. General<br>
[0092] A number of different types of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) ingredients can<br>
be incorporated into the slurry and optionally added at other stages of the overall<br>
manufacturing process as described herein. If added at a stage other than the slurry, most<br>
ingredients can generally be added as a powder or as part of a solution. The ingredients that<br>
are incorporated are selected, for example, to tailor the performance, nutritional, and taste<br>
characteristics of the final soft or firm/semi-hard cheese product.<br>
[0093] As noted above, some of the ingredients included in the slurry generally fall into<br>
two general categories: 1) ingredients that one seeks to incorporate at relatively high<br>
concentration levels; and 2) ingredients that need to be heated and/or hydrated to become<br>
functionalized, i.e., to be converted into a form that has the chemical and/or physical<br>
properties that are important for imparting the desired characteristics to the final soft or<br>
firm/semi-hard cheese product. But a variety of other ingredients can also be included in the<br>
slurry.<br>
[0094] Examples of such ingredients include, but are not limited to, nonfat dry milk, a milk<br>
protein, an acidity regulator, an acid, an anticaking agent, an antifoaming agent, a coloring<br>
agent, an emulsifier, an enzyme preparation, a flavoring agent, a firming agent, a food<br>
protein, a gelling agent, a preservative, sequestrants, a stabilizer, a starch, a thickener, an oil,<br>
a fat, a cheese powder, a salt, a nutritional supplement, an acid, an enzyme, a neutraceutical, a<br>
carbohydrate, a vitamin, and a mineral. Examples may further include procream, whey<br>
cream, a dairy solid, and foodstuffs of vegetable, fruit and/or animal source. The foodstuffs<br>
may include fruit, vegetables, nuts, meat, and spices, among other foodstuffs.<br>
[009S] Examples and additional specific information regarding the types of ingredients that<br>
can be incorporated to tailor the performance, nutritional and taste characteristics of the final<br>
soft or firm/semi-hard cheese product follow.<br>
[0096] Dairy Solids. A dairy solid can be added to improve various characteristics of the<br>
final cheese product such as: firming the cheese, improving water binding capacity,<br>
improving the melt appearance of the cooked cheese, and/or increasing the blistering of the<br>
cooked cheese. Dairy solids that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, whey protein<br>
concentrate, casein hydrolyzate, milk fat, lactalhumin, cream, milk protein concentrate, milk<br>
protein isolate, lactose, casein, whey protein isolate, hydrolyzed whey protein, denatured<br>
whey protein, skim cheese powder, natural casein isolate, nonfat dry milk, delactose<br>
permeate, procream, mixer overflow liquid, and milk minerals. In general, dairy solids can<br>
be incorporated into the final product from about 0.5-25 wt. %.<br>
[0097] Incorporation of a dairy solid such as nonfat dry milk into a heated slurry is one<br>
approach for obtaining relatively high concentration levels in the final product. For example,<br>
the dairy solid concentration in some soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses that are prepared<br>
according to the methods disclosed herein can be at least 11,12 or 13 wt. %, and can include,<br>
for example, up to about 16, 17, 18,19, 20 or 25 wt. % of the final product. Thus, the<br>
concentration of the dairy solids in the slurry is generally adjusted such that the level of dairy<br>
solid in the final cheese product is about 0.5- 25, about 3-18, about 4-16, or about 11-25 wt.<br>
%. This means that the concentration of the dairy solid in the slurry itself is generally within<br>
the range of about 0.5 to 95 wt. %, for example about 10-80%, or about 30-70%, by wt.<br>
[0098] Starches. Incorporating starches into the heated slurry is also beneficial in some<br>
instances because the functionality of some starches is increased when heated, hydrated<br>
and/or subjected to high shear conditions. Once functionalized in this manner, the starch can<br>
thicken or gel to bind to proteins in the cheese (e.g., casein). In general, starch can be<br>
incorporated into the final product in the range of about 0.5-20 wt. %.<br>
[0099] Some methods add starch such that the starch concentration in the final cheese<br>
product is at least 4, 6, 11, 12, 13 or 20 wt. %. Thus, in some instances, the starch<br>
concentration can range from about 4-20 wt.% or from about 5-16 wt. % in the final cheese<br>
product. This means that the starch concentration in the slurry itself is typically about 0 -95<br>
wt. %, for example about 0.5-50%, or about 1-25% by wt.<br>
[0100] A number of different types of starches can be incorporated into the final cheese<br>
product. Suitable starches include vegetable starches (e.g., potato starch, pea starch, and<br>
tapioca) and grain starches (e.g., corn starch, wheat starch, and rice starch). Specific<br>
examples cf suitable corn starches include dent corn starch, waxy com starch, and high<br>
amylose corn starch. The starches can be used individually or in combination.<br>
[0101] The starch can be modified or native. Modified food starches differ in their degree<br>
of cross-linking, type of chemical substitution, oxidation level, degree of molecular scission,<br>
and ratio of amylose to amylopectin. Examples of some commercially-available modified<br>
food.sarches that are suitable include Mira-Cleer 516, Pending 200, Purity 660, Batterbind<br>
SC, Penbind 100, MiraQuick MGL, Novation 3300, and Gel-n-Melt. A suitable<br>
commercially-available native (unmodified) starch is Hylon V.<br>
[0102] Mira-Cleer 516, from A. E. Staley Company, is a dent corn starch that is cross-<br>
linked and substituted with hydroxypropyl groups. The cross-linking increases its<br>
gelatinization temperature and acid tolerance. The hydroxypropyl substitution increases its<br>
water binding capability, viscosity and freeze-thaw stability. MiraQuick MGL, also from A.<br>
E. Staley Company, is an acid-thinned potato starch. The acid thinning breaks amylopectin<br>
branches in the starch, creating a firmer gel. Batterbind SC, from National Starch, is a cross-<br>
linked and oxidized dent com starch. Purity 660, also from National Starch, is a cross-hnlced<br>
and hydroxypropyl substituted dent com starch. Hylon V, also from National Starch, is an<br>
unmodified, high amylose com starch. Pending 200, from Penwest Foods, is an oxidized<br>
potato starch. The oxidation increases its capacity to bind water and protein. Peribind 100,<br>
also from Penwest Foods, is a cross-linked potato starch.<br>
[0103] Emulsifiers, Gelling Agents, Stabilizers and Thickeners. Gums, celluloses, and<br>
alginates are some examples of emulsifiers, gelling agents, stabilizers and thickeners. Many<br>
of the considerations that apply to starches also apply to gums and celluloses. Certain gums<br>
and celluloses, for example, should be hydrated and/or heated to realize their full functional<br>
characteristics. Heating and hydration also enables increased levels of the gums, celluloses,<br>
or alginates to be included in the final product. Some of the soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses<br>
that are provided herein contain at least about 0.01, 0.5 or 3.0 wt. % gum, cellulose, or<br>
alginate. The products thus generally have a gum, cellulose, or alginate concentration of<br>
about 0.01-3.0 wt. %. This means that the concentration of the gum, cellulose, or alginate in<br>
the slurry itself is typically about 0.02-6.0 wt. % or 0.05-5.0 wt. %.<br>
[0104] Different types of celluloses can also be incorporated into the cheese. The cellulose<br>
can be either natural or modified. One cellulose or combinations of different celluloses can<br>
be utilized. Types of celluloses that can be utilized include, hut are not limited to,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, methylcellulose, propylene glycol alginate,<br>
and sodium alginate. One specific example of a commercially available modified cellulose is<br>
METHOCEL A-l 5™ that is available from Dow Chemical Company (Midland, MI).<br>
[0105] Examples of suitable gums that can be incorporated include, but are not limited to,<br>
xanthan gum, guar gum, konjac flour and locust bean gum. Examples of suitable stabilizers<br>
include chondrus extract (carrageenan), pectin, gelatin, and agar.<br>
[0106] The total amount of gums and stabilizers included in the final cheese product is<br>
typically up to about 0.01, about 0.50, or about 3.0 % by weight. More specifically, the<br>
amount of gums and/or stabilizers can range from about 0.01 to 3.0%, from about 0.25 to 2.5<br>
%, from about 0.5 to 2.0 % , or about 0.75-1.5% by weight of the final cheese product. Gums<br>
and stabilizers concentrations in the slurry are typically in the range of about 0.02 - 6.0, or<br>
0.50 - 5.0 wt. %.<br>
[0107] Acidity Regulators, Anticaking Agents, and Firming Agents. Acidity regulators,<br>
anticaking agents, and firming agents of various types can be included in the cheese.<br>
Typically, these agents are inorganic salts, but other types of acidity regulators, anticaking<br>
agents, and firming agents can also be used. Examples of acidity regulators, anticaking<br>
agents, and firming agents may include calcium chloride, tricalcium phosphate, calcium<br>
hydroxide, powdered cellulose, disodium phosphate, and potassium hydroxide. These agents<br>
are typically added as part of a solution, (but could be used as a powder) either by<br>
incorporation in the slurry or in a non-heated liquid that is incorporated into the admixture of<br>
the slurry and heated cheese mass.<br>
[0108] The total amount of acidity regulators, anticaking agents, and firming agents<br>
incorporated into a slurry is sufficient so the concentration of the acidity regulators,<br>
anticaking agents, and firming agents in the final cheese product is generally up to about<br>
0.05, 1.2, or 3.0 % by weight. More specifically, the amount of acidity regulators, anticaking<br>
agents, and firming agents can range from about 0.05 to 3.0%, from about 0.1 to 2.5 %, or<br>
from about 0.5 to 2.0 % by weight. This means that the concentration of the acidity<br>
regulators, anticaking agents, and finning agents in the slurry is typically about 2 to 95 % by<br>
weight.<br>
[0109] Sequestrants. A number of different sequestrants can be incorporated into the final<br>
cheese product. Sequestrants that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, various<br>
phosphate salts {e.g., sodium hexametaphosphate, monosodium phosphate, sodium<br>
polyphosphate, disodium phosphate, trisodium citrate and potassium phosphate), calcium<br>
citrate, calcium gluconate, oxystearin and sorbitol.<br>
[0110] The total amount of sequestrant is usually up to about 0.1, 1, or 4 % by weight of<br>
the final cheese product. So, for example, the amount of sequestrant in the final cheese<br>
product can range from about 0.1 to 4%, from about 0.25 to 3.0 %, or from about 0.4 to 2.5 %<br>
by weight. The concentration of the sequestrants in the slurry itself thus is generally about<br>
0.1 to 95 wt. %.<br>
[0111] Acids. An acid can be incorporated to adjust the pH of the finished cheese to a<br>
desired level. Various acids can be employed; examples of suitable acids include, but are not<br>
limited to, adipic acid, lactic acid, glucono-delta-lactone, phosphoric acid, lactobionic acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, or Genlac C, the latter being a blend of water, citric acid, lactic<br>
acid, acetic acid and artificial flavors. Acid is typically added to adjust the pH of the finished<br>
cheese to a pH from about 5-6 is reached, and more typically from pH 5.10-5.70.<br>
[0112] If included in the slurry, the acid agent is included in an amount sufficient to adjust<br>
the pH of the slurry within the range of about 0.0 to 8.0, for example, from about 0.5-6.5, or<br>
1-5.<br>
10113] Cheese powders. Cheese powders can also be mixed into the cheese to impart a<br>
different cheese flavor to the finished product. Such powders are typically added to the<br>
heated cheese mass formed during the pasta filata process as a powder rather than as part of<br>
the slurry.<br>
[0114] Examples of suitable cheese powders include, but are not limited to, Parmesan,<br>
cheddar, Monterey Jack, Romano, muenster, Swiss, and provolone powders. The amount of<br>
cheese powder in the finished cheese is generally about 0.25 to 10%, and in some instances<br>
about 1 to 5% by weight. Cheese powders are available from a variety of commercial<br>
suppliers, including, for example, Armour Foods of Springfield, Ky.<br>
[01 IS] Colorants. A colorant can be incorporated into the cheese to adjust its natural color.<br>
This can be useful, for example, if consumers have a preference for a color other than the<br>
naturally-occurring color. Examples of suitable colorants include annatto, tumeric, titanium<br>
dioxide, and beta-carotene. Colorants may be of both the natural or artificial color. If one<br>
wished to color the cheese a red an artificial color such as FD&amp;C red # 40 can be used.<br>
Annatto is useful to give mozzarella cheese the appearance of cheddar. This allows one to<br>
produce a cheese for pizza baking that has the desired melt characteristics of mozzarella, hut<br>
with a different appearance than that of traditional white mozzarella. Annatto-colored<br>
mozzarella can be used as a replacement for cheddar cheese in many food products (e.g.,<br>
Mexican-style prepared foods). Tumeric imparts a yellowish color to mozzarella, which<br>
naturally is white. The yellowish color often is preferred by consumers who perceive it to<br>
indicate a "richer" product upon cooking on a pizza. Colorants such as armatto and tumeric<br>
can be obtained, for example, from Chris Hansens Labs of Milwaukee, WI.<br>
[0116] Colorants can be incorporated into the final cheese product by inclusion in the<br>
slurry. If added apart from the slurry, the colorant is generally sprayed onto the heated<br>
cheese mass as an unheated solution or dispersion in water. The amount of colorant added is<br>
typically in the range of about 0.01 to 2%, based on the weight of the finished cheese.<br>
Tumeric, if used, is generally added in an amount of about 0.05 to 0.5%. If annatto is added,<br>
it normally is added to about 0.1 to 0.9% by weight.<br>
[0117] Flavoring Agents. Various flavoring agents can also be incorporated into the cheese<br>
to tailor the flavor profile of the cheese to meet consumer preferences. Suitable flavors for<br>
mixing into the heated cheese include, for example, cheddar cheese flavor and parmesan<br>
cheese flavor.<br>
[0118] Flavoring agents are typically added in an amount such that the concentration in the<br>
final cheese product is within the range of about 0.01 to 5 wt. %. If incorporated into the<br>
slurry, the concentration of the flavoring agent in the slurry is generally is in the range of<br>
about 0.02 to 5 wt. %.<br>
[0119J Non-dairy protein isolate. A non-dairy protein isolate can also be incorporated into<br>
the soft or fiim/semi-hard cheese. It is to alter the texture of the cheese and/or to change the<br>
sire, color, or integrity of the blisters that are formed when the cheese is baked on a pizza, as<br>
well as other cook characteristics. Examples of suitable non-dairy protein isolates include,<br>
but are not limited to, soy protein (sometimes called "soy powder"), gelatin, wheat germ, com<br>
germ, ghnxn, and egg solids.<br>
[0120] The protein isolate is added such that the concentration of the protein isolate in the<br>
final cheese product is up to about 1, 15 or 30 wt. %. The concentration of the protein isolate<br>
in the slurry is thus adjusted so the concentration is about 2 to 95 % by weight of the slurry.<br>
[012]] Oils. Various oils can also be incorporated into the cheese. They are generally<br>
added to alter the fatty acid profile and/or cost of the cheese and/or to change the size, color,<br>
or integrity of the blisters that are formed when the cheese is baked, as well as other cook<br>
characteristics. Examples of suitable oils include, but are not limited to, vegetable oils, soy<br>
bean oil, corn oil, flax seed oil, walnut oil, palm oil, linoleic acid, fish oil, omega 3 fatty<br>
acids, and medium chain triglycerides, among others. Any of the oils may be partially or<br>
completely hydrogenated. If blended into the initial slurry, the oil is added in a concentration<br>
such that the concentration of the oil in the final cheese product is up to about 1.0,20 or 35<br>
wt. %. The concentration of the oil in the slurry is thus adjusted so the concentration is about<br>
0 to 65, by weight, (e.g., about 5 to 50 % wt.) of the slurry.<br>
[0122] Salt. Salts of various types, but typically sodium chloride, can be added to tailor the<br>
flavor of the final cheese. The salt can be incorporated into the final cheese product by<br>
including it in the heated slurry or by adding it in granular form or as an unheated solution<br>
apart from the slurry. Regardless of how introduced, the salt concentration in the final cheese<br>
product is usually added at a level of about 0.1-5 wt. %. When added as an ingredient of the<br>
slurry, this means that the salt concentration in the slurry is generally about 0.0 to 25.0 wt. %,<br>
for example about 0.5-22%, or about 1-18% by wt.<br>
[0123J Antifoaming Agents. Various antifoaming agents can be incorporated to facilitate<br>
processing. Examples include, but are not limited to, microcrystalline wax, oxystearin and<br>
polydimethylsiloxane.<br>
[0124] Carbohydrates. A variety of simple sugars {e.g., mono- and disaccharides), as well<br>
as more complex carbohydrates can be included in the cheese. Examples include, but are not<br>
limited to, glucose, sucrose, and fructose.<br>
[0125] Enzymes. Enzymes may be used to create flavors, texture, melt, and/or other<br>
functional characteristics in the final cheese product, and/or in the slurry that can then be<br>
transferred to the final cheese product once the slurry and cheese have been mixed together.<br>
Examples of such enzymes, and this is not an all inclusive list, would be lipases, proteases,<br>
oxidoreductases, and transglutaminase.<br>
[0126] Neutraceuticals. Neutraceuticals may be included to deliver nutrients not normally<br>
present in cheese. Examples of neutraceuticals include, but are not limited to lycopene,<br>
antioxidants, probiotics, prebiotics, phosphatidylserine, vegetable sterols, immunoglobulins.<br>
These products in particular may be added as part of the slurry or to the mixer (mixer 290, fig<br>
4B).<br>
V. Slurries and Slurry Preparation Methods<br>
[0127] Slurries that are combined with a cheese precursor to produce the soft or firm/semi-<br>
hard cheese product are also provided. As described, these compositions contain one or more<br>
of the ingredients or ingredients listed in the preceding section. In general, the concentration<br>
of these ingredients is sufficient to obtain a final soft or firrn/semi-hard cheese product having<br>
the desired concentration of the ingredient (see preceding section). More specifically, the<br>
ingredient concentrations are in the range listed above.<br>
[0128] The slurries utilized to prepare the soft or firrn/semi-hard cheeses that are provided<br>
typically are water-based compositions. But some slurries alternatively or in addition include<br>
another liquids such as milk or cream. The water in some compositions typically accounts<br>
for from about 5 - 95 % of the slurry by weight. Slurries may also include emulsions of water<br>
and oil and/or fat.<br>
[0129] The slurries are optionally processed to be in a form that mixes well with another<br>
cheese ingredient (e.g., curd or heated cheese mass), that promotes dissolution of ingredients<br>
and/or that confers the desired processing or performance characteristics. Details regarding<br>
the slurry preparation process are described above, including FIGS. 3A and 3B and<br>
accompanying text.<br>
[0130] One example of a useful base slurry is one that contains cream, nonfat dry milk and<br>
water. To obtain high concentrations on nonfat dry milk, it can be useful to include an acid<br>
and salt. Above about 60% nonfat dry milk, for example, the slurry can get very viscous and<br>
thus difficult to pump through the slurry processing system described above. By adding acid<br>
as a processing aid, and salt to the slurry, the viscosity can be reduced sufficiently such that<br>
the slurry containing the desired high levels of nonfat dry milk can be transported through the<br>
processing system. Although any acid and salt could be added elsewhere during the process,<br>
inclusion in the slurry can be useful for the reasons just listed.<br>
[0131] To reiterate a point made earlier, slurries can be used to provide various benefits<br>
during the cheese manufacturing process, including increased yield. Nonfat dry milk contains<br>
about 27 wt. % casein protein and about 73% other components (e.g., ash, lactose, whey<br>
protein, etc). If the nonfat dry milk is added to the milk at the beginning of the cheese<br>
manufacturing process, much of the casein becomes incorporated into the cheese, but much,<br>
or all, of the other components are lost. Using slurries and methods such as provided herein,<br>
essentially all of the casein and whey protein can be incorporated into the final cheese<br>
product, thus significantly increasing the yield of the overall process.<br>
VI. Systems for Preparing Soft or Firm/semi-Hard Cheese Products<br>
[0132] FIG. 4A depicts one example of a generalized system 200 that can be used to carry<br>
out die foregoing methods to prepare the soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses that are described<br>
herein. This exemplary system includes the following subsystems: (1) a slurry preparation<br>
system 205; (2) a cheese precursor preparation system 260 that is in fluid communication<br>
with slurry preparation system 205; and (3) a final processing system 300 that is in<br>
communication with cheese precursor preparation system 260. The slurry preparation system<br>
includes the equipment necessary to prepare the slurry that contains the one or more<br>
ingredients selected for inclusion in the final cheese product. The cheese precursor<br>
preparation system generally includes the equipment and devices required to prepare a cheese<br>
precursor, and can include a mixer or related device to combine the slurry with the precursor.<br>
The final processing system includes the equipment to convert the admixture of the slurry and<br>
cheese precursor into the desired final product.<br>
[0133] A wide variety of different systems have this general design. Although specific<br>
examples of such systems are described below, it should be understood that these systems are<br>
only examples and not intended to be an exhaustive list of the types of systems that can be<br>
used to carry out the cheese processing methods that are described herein or of the type of<br>
systems that can be used to prepare the type of soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses that are<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
[0134] One exemplary system that can be used to perform the methods that are disclosed<br>
herein is shown in FIG. 4B. This particular system 202 is for use primarily in methods in<br>
which a slurry is combined with a heated mass of cheese (see, e.g., FIG. 3 A). The cheese<br>
precursor preparation system 260 of system 200 generally includes a curd preparation<br>
subsystem 261 that is connected to cooker/kneader 270 by transfer tube 268. Cooker/kneader<br>
270 is connected in turn by transfer tube 269 to mixer 290, which is also in communication<br>
with slurry preparation system 205 via transfer tube 255. In operation, curd is thus prepared<br>
in curd preparation subsystem 261 and can be transported through transfer tube 268 into<br>
cooker/kneader 270, where the cheese curd is heated and kneaded to form a heated cheese<br>
mass. This mass can then be combined with the slurry prepared in slurry preparation system<br>
205. The cheese precursor preparation system 260 also includes dispenser 251 which is<br>
connected to curd preparation system 261. Thus, additional control over the composition and<br>
preparation of the final cheese product can be achieved by adding ingredients from dispenser<br>
251 to compositions in the cheese curd preparation system 261 via transfer tube 252. But not<br>
all systems include such a dispenser.<br>
[0135] The slurry preparation system 205 of system 200 generally includes the equipment<br>
necessary to blend, heat, shear, homogenize and adjust the water content of the slurry to<br>
obtain the desired slurry composition. More specifically, system 205 includes a blender 210<br>
and cooker 220 that are connected to one another via transfer tube 215. The transfer tube 215<br>
may include a pump sniffer that moves the slurry to the cooker 220. The pump stuffer may<br>
include two augers that move the slurry and a hopper that takes up the slurry into the augers<br>
from the blender 210. A liquid {e.g., water, milk and/or cream) and one or more slurry<br>
ingredients can thus be introduced into blender 210, where they are blended together to form<br>
an initial slurry. This resulting slurry can then be transported into cooker 220, where the<br>
slurry is heated to form a heated slurry. Slurry preparation system 205 in this system also<br>
includes slurry mixing and moisture control subsystem 208. The particular subsystem 208<br>
shown in FIG. 4B includes shear pump 230, homogenizer 240 and evaporator 250.<br>
Subsystem 208 is in communication with cooker 220 and mixer 290.<br>
10136] In the particular subsystem shown in FIG. 4B it is shear pump 230 of subsystem 208<br>
that establishes the link with cooker 220, as shear pump 230 is connected to cooker 220 via<br>
transfer tube 225. Shear pump 230 is also connected to homogenizer 240 by transfer tube<br>
235, which in turn is connected to evaporator 250 by transfer tube 245. Subsystem 208 is<br>
connected to mixer 290 by transfer tube 255, which connects evaporator 250 and mixer 290.<br>
[0137] Thus, heated slurry from cooker 220 can flow into shear pump 230 via transfer tube<br>
225, where the slurry is subjected to shear conditions. The sheared slurry can subsequently<br>
be transferred to homogenizer 240 through transfer tube 235, where the slurry and the<br>
ingredient(s) it contains are homogenized. The resulting homogenized slurry can then flow<br>
through transfer tube 245 into evaporator 250. Evaporator 250 adjusts the moisture content<br>
so it is within the desired range. The final slurry then flows from evaporator 250 into mixer<br>
290 via transfer tube 255.<br>
[0138] The heated slurry from slurry preparation system 205 can then be combined with the<br>
heated cheese mass from cheese precursor preparation system 260 in mixer 290. Ingredients<br>
can also optionally be introduced into mixer 290 from additive dispenser 286, which is in<br>
communication with mixer 290 through transfer tube 287. The admixture formed in mixer<br>
290 can then be transported via tube 291 and processed in final processing system 300. Final<br>
processing system 300 as depicted in this particular system includes extruder 305 that is<br>
connected to cooling system 315 by tube 310. Various other final processing systems,<br>
however, can also be utilized as described herein.<br>
[0139] It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that certain units within<br>
slurry preparation system 205 (e.g.s cooker 220, shear pump 230, homogenizer 240 and<br>
evaporator 250) need not be included. Most slurry preparation systems include a blender to<br>
blend the liquid and ingredients together. But the slurry preparation system can include none<br>
of the other units just listed (i. e., cooker, shear pump, homogenizer and evaporator),<br>
individual units, combinations of multiple units or all the units depending upon the particular<br>
requirements of the application. It should also be understood that these units can be arranged<br>
in a variety of other configurations. For instance, although shown as separate units in FIG.<br>
2C, shear pump 230 and homogenizer 240 can be part of a single unit in other systems. Other<br>
combinations that can optionally be utilized in still other systems are those in which cooker<br>
220 and shear pump 230 are part of the same unit, and systems in which cooker 220, shear<br>
pump 230 and homogenizer 240 are all part of the same integrated unit.<br>
[0140] The order in which cooker 220, shear pump 230 and homogenizer 240 appear in<br>
FIG. 4B can also be altered in other systems such that all the various permutations are<br>
possible. Examples of optional arrangements that can be utilized in other systems include: 1)<br>
coolcer-homogenizer-shear pump, 2) shear pump-homogenizer-cooker, 3) shear pump-<br>
cooker-homogenizer, 4) homogenizer-shear pump-cooker, 5) homogenizer-cooker-shear<br>
pump, and the other various permutations.<br>
[0141] Another exemplary system is illustrated in FIG. 4C. This figure depicts a system<br>
203 that would typically be used to conduct methods in which the slurry is mixed with a<br>
cheese curd or curd precursor (see, e.g., FIG. 3B). The resulting admixture can then be<br>
heated and kneaded as in a pasta filata type process.<br>
[0142] The slurry preparation system 205 for system 203 is as described for system 202.<br>
The cheese precursor preparation system 260 includes various units utilized in the preparation<br>
of cheese curd. Cheese precursor preparation system 260 in the particular system shown in<br>
FIG. 4C thus includes, for instance, curd preparation system 261, which includes curd<br>
containers 262 of cheese ingredients (e.g., milk, starter and cream) or mixtures thereof (e.g.,<br>
cheese vat), a system for forming coagulum 264, and containers 266 of curd. Cheese<br>
precursor preparation system 260 also includes mixer 290, but some systems omit this mixer.<br>
In operation, ingredients or mixtures thereof in containers 262 can be moved to the system for<br>
making the coagulum 264 via transfer tube 263. The coagulum can subsequently be<br>
transported from system 264 to container 266 through tube 265. The curd can then be moved<br>
from containers 266 to mixer 290 through transfer tube 267. Curd preparation system 261<br>
may also include ingredient dispenser 251, which can be connected to ingredient containers<br>
262, coagulation system 264 and/or curd container 266 via transfer lines 253a, 253b, 253c,<br>
respectively. This thus allows the option of adding ingredients at each of these stages of the<br>
process.<br>
[0143] In system 203, slurry can be transported through lines 255 and lines 256a, 256b,<br>
and/or 256c such that the slurry becomes combined with the ingredients or mixtures in<br>
containers 262, the coagulum in coagulation system 264, and/or the curd in containers 266.<br>
System 203 is designed to allow for various processing options once the slurry and cheese<br>
precursor are combined to allow for a curd/slurry admixture. One option, for example, is to<br>
transport the admixture through tube 291 to the final processing system 300 to form the final<br>
product. In an alternative configuration, however, curd preparation system 261 is in<br>
communication with cooker 270 via tube 267, which in turn is connected to mixer 290 via<br>
tube 267. Mixer 290 may be connected to final processing system 300 by transfer tube 291.<br>
Alternatively, the transfer tube 291 may divert the flow of the admixture between coloring<br>
units 293 and 294. Coloring unit 293 may add coloring (e.g., orange coloring) to the<br>
admixture to give it the appearance of, for example, cheddar cheese, while coloring unit 294<br>
may add no color and leave the cheese substantially white in color. The entire admixture<br>
may be diverted through one or the other coloring units 293 and 294, as well as being<br>
adjustable to split the admixture between the coloring units to create, for example, a cheese<br>
combination from the admixture.<br>
[0144] Another option is for the admixture to be moved to cooker 270 through tube 267.<br>
Once the admixture has been heated and kneaded, the resulting heated admixture can be<br>
transported to mixer 290 via tube 288. This thus allows additional ingredients to be<br>
introduced into the admixture from dispenser 286 as described with respect to system 202.<br>
Once the additional ingredients are mixed in with, the slurry and cheese precursor admixture,<br>
the resulting admixture can be transported to final processing system 300 through tube 291.<br>
[0145] Embodiments of the system also include the introduction of ingredients in parallel<br>
and serial fashion. Referring to FIG. 4D, for example, a system 400 is shown with a<br>
configuration that has transfer tube 321 diverting the admixture from mixer 320 into two<br>
mixers 290a and 290b. Transfer tubes 287a and 287b connect the mixers 290a and 290b to<br>
ingredient dispensers 286a and 286b, respectively, which can add the same or different<br>
ingredients to admixtures. The final admixtures may then be sent through transfer tubes 291 a<br>
and 291b to final processing systems 300a and 300b, respectively. In another example, FIG.<br>
4E shows system 410 that has one or more ingredients added sequentially from ingredient<br>
dispensers 286 and 332. In system 410, a first ingredient (or first plurality of ingredients) is<br>
dispensed to mixer 290 from ingredient dispenser 286 via transfer tube 287. The resulting<br>
admixture may be sent through transfer tube 336 to mixer 330, where one or more additional<br>
ingredients may be added by a second ingredient dispenser 332 coupled to the mixer 330 via<br>
transfer tube 334. The additional ingredients may be the same as, or different than the first<br>
ingredient (or first plurality of ingredients). The resulting admixture formed in mixer 330<br>
may be sent through transfer tube 338 to the final processing system 300.<br>
[0146] The final processing system utilized in these exemplary systems can vary, but can<br>
include a pre-brine tank that includes super cold sodium chloride brine into which molten<br>
cheese or cheese ribbons can flow. A cutter can cut the cheese into loaves as the cheese<br>
ribbon exits the pre-brine tank. The cooled and salted loaves are then transferred to a main<br>
brine tank where they stay until removed by a conveyor. An exemplary system of this<br>
general design is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,902,625, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety for all purposes.<br>
[0147] A variety of different types of equipment can be utilized in the foregoing systems.<br>
For example, different types of blenders can be used to mix the ingredients together to form<br>
the initial slurry. In general, the blender simply needs to be capable of mixing relatively<br>
viscous fluids. One common blender is a twin-screw mixer or extruder such as is common in<br>
the food industry. Ribbon blenders or pipelines that include a series of pumps and static<br>
mixers can also be utilized.<br>
[0148] The cooker used in the slurry preparation systems can be of various types, including<br>
the lay-down cooker, swept surface heat exchanger, agitated direct heating pipeline cooker.<br>
The cookers are capable of heating a slurry of the compositions defined herein to<br>
temperatures ranging from about 90 - 293° F. Specific examples of suitable cookers include<br>
the RotaTherm™ cooker available from Gold Peg International Pty. Ltd. (Moorabbin, Vic,<br>
Australia) or the FusionCooker™, available from Blentech Corporation, Rohnert Part, CA),<br>
the continuous mixer from READCO Manufacturing (York, PA), or single or Evolum 145<br>
twin screw extruders from Clextral Inc. (Tampa FL). The cookers can heat the slurry by<br>
convection (e.g., a heated blanket surrounds the cooker), conduction, or radiation, or by<br>
directly injecting steam into the cooker.<br>
[0149] Various types of shear pumps can be utilized. Suitable types of shear pumps<br>
mclude inline mixers, or colloid mills. Examples of pumps that can be used include<br>
Silverson in-line mixer (East Longmeadow, MA) and Stephan cooker (Stephan Machinery<br>
Corporation (Columbus, OH), or a colloid mill supplied by Waukesha Cherry Burrell<br>
(Charlotte, NC). The shear pump should be capable of generating a shear rate of at least<br>
10,000 to 500,000 s"1.<br>
[0150] A number of homogenizers are also suitable for use in the systems that are provided.<br>
Examples of homogenizers that can be used include those manufactured by APV Gaulin<br>
(Kansas City, MO) and Waukesha Cherry Burrell (Charlotte, NC). Evaporators of different<br>
types can also be utilized. In general, the evaporator should be able to handle relatively<br>
viscous solution. Flash vacuum vessels are one example of a suitable evaporator.<br>
Evaporators of this type are available from Invensys APV (Lake Mills, WI) or De Dietrich<br>
Process Systems (Bridgeton, MO). Some systems include a feedback system that is<br>
connected to the evaporator (e.g., a near infrared monitor). This system may include a sensor<br>
that can monitor the moisture level in the slurry coming from the evaporator and send a signal<br>
to the evaporator signaling the evaporator to increase, decrease or maintain the level at which<br>
water is removed from the slurry so the desired moisture content in the slurry is achieved.<br>
[0151] For systems in which the cheese curd is heated and kneaded, a number of different<br>
kneading mixers can be used to form the heated mass of cheese, One exemplary device for<br>
performing this operation is a single or twin-screw mixer or a twin-screw extruder, either<br>
fitted for steam injection or having a heated jacket, or a combination of both. When using a<br>
twin-screw mixer or extruder to perform the heating and kneading, the screws (i.e., augers)<br>
are typically arranged so they overlap, to insure morough mixing.<br>
VII. Soft or Firm/semi-Hard Cheeses<br>
[0152] The methods that are described herein can be utilized to prepare soft or firm/semi-<br>
hard cheeses that contain one or more of the ingredients at the concentration ranges described<br>
herein. As indicated above, some of the methods that are disclosed herein can be utilized to<br>
manufacture soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses that contain ingredients that become<br>
functionalized when included in a slurry and are subject to heating and/or hydration. Some of<br>
the soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses can also include relatively high concentrations of certain<br>
ingredients. As set forth above, some of the soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses can contain at<br>
least 10,11,12 ,13 or 14 wt. % of one or more of the ingredients listed above. So, for<br>
instance, some of the cheeses that are provided have one, two, three or more of the following<br>
characteristics.<br>
[0153] Some of the soft-or semi soft cheeses that are provided are characterized by having<br>
a starch concentration of at least 10, 11,12,13 or 14 wt. %. So, for example, some of the soft<br>
or Firm/semi-hard cheeses have a starch concentration of about 12-14 wt. %, others a starch<br>
concentration of about 14-16 wt. %, and still others a starch concentration of about 16-20 wt.<br>
%.<br>
[0154] A characteristic of other soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses that are provided is that they<br>
have a dairy solid (e.g., nonfat dry milk) concentration of at least 10, 11,12,13 or 14 wt %.<br>
Other soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses have dairy solid concentrations up to about 16,17,18,<br>
19, or 20 wt. %. Some soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses of this type thus have dairy solid<br>
concentrations of about 12-14 wt %. Other soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses have a dairy solid<br>
concentration of about 14-16 wt. %, or about 16 - 20 wt. %.<br>
[0155] Other soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses that are provided have a cellulose<br>
concentration of at least 0.01, 0.5, or 3.0 wt. %. Such cheeses, for instance, thus have<br>
cellulose concentrations that range from about 0.01-3.0, or 0.25-2.5, or 0.5-2.0 wt. %.<br>
[0156] The soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses that are provided typically have a protein content<br>
of about 10 -40 wt. %, a moisture content of about 35-65%, and a fat content of about 0-60%<br>
on a dry basis (FDB). The actual composition varies somewhat depending upon the<br>
particular type of cheese that is to be produced. For certain soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses<br>
(e.g., mozzarella cheeses) that are provided, the milk fat content is at least 45% by weight of<br>
solids and the moisture content is about 52-60 wt. %. The low-moisture soft or firm/semi-<br>
hard cheeses (also sometimes referred to as low-moisture mozzarella cheeses) that are<br>
provided generally have a minimum milk fat content of 45% by weight of solids and a<br>
moisture content that is about 45-52 wt. %. Part skim-milk soft or firm/semi-hard ripened<br>
and unripened cheeses (also called part skim mozzarella cheeses) that are provided, in<br>
contrast, have a milk fat content that ranges from about 30-45% by weight of solids and a<br>
moisture content that is about 52-60 wt %. The low-moisture, part-skim soft or firm/semi-<br>
hard ripened and unripened cheeses (also referred to as low-moisture, part skim mozzarella<br>
cheeses) that are provided usually have a milk fat content of about 30-45% by weight of the<br>
solids and a moisture content of about 45-52 wt %. The foregoing moisture percentages are<br>
for bound plus free water, i.e., the percent of weight lost when the cheese is dried for 17 hrs +<br>
1 hr in a 100°C oven.<br>
[01571 The soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses that are provided can be in a variety of different<br>
forms including loavts, Ribbons™, comminuted forms (e.g., diced or shredded forms) and<br>
other forms known in the art. The pH of the soft or firrn/semi-hard cheese generally ranges<br>
from about 5.00 to about 6.00, such as about 5.10 to about 5.90.<br>
VIE. Food Products and Methods of Manufacturing Such Food Stuffs<br>
[0158] The soft or firrn/semi-hard cheeses that are provided can be utilized in essentially<br>
any baking application that involves the use of soft or firrn/semi-hard cheese and can be<br>
incorporated into a wide variety of foodstuffs and food products. The soft or firrn/semi-hard<br>
cheeses, for instance, can be included as an ingredient in a variety of convenience foods,<br>
including entrees, snack foods and appetizers.<br>
[0159] The term "food product" is intended to broadly encompass any type of food to<br>
which one can add cheese. Examples of suitable types of foods into which the provided<br>
cheeses can be added, include, but are not limited to: cereal-based products; poultry, beef,<br>
pork or seafood-based entrees; potatoes; vegetables; fruit; candy; and nuts. The cereal-based<br>
products can be of diverse types including, for instance, pizzas, burritos, dough-enrobed<br>
sandwiches, hand-held foods, breads, bagels, pastries, and grain-based snack foods (e.g.,<br>
crackers and pretzels). The cheese can be included with a variety of different forms of<br>
potatoes, including, chips, French fries, hash browns, and strings. Likewise, vegetables of<br>
various types can be combined with the cheeses that are provided. Exemplary vegetables<br>
include, mushrooms, zucchini, peppers (e.g., jalapenos) and cauliflower.<br>
[0160] The soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses can be incorporated into the food product,<br>
layered onto or in the food product or used as a coating. One common use, for example, is as<br>
an exposed cheese on a pizza or as the string cheese rolled in the outer Up of a pizza crust (a<br>
so-called "stuffed crust pizza").<br>
[0161] As those skilled in the art will recognize, the foregoing list is simply illustrative and<br>
is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the types of foods that can be combined with the<br>
cheeses that are provided herein.<br>
[0162] The soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses that are provided are suitable for use in<br>
essentially any type of cooking including convection heating, steam injection heating and<br>
microwave heating, for example. In some microwave heating applications, for example, the<br>
food product is exposed to microwave energy in an amount and for a duration sufficient to<br>
heat and melt the cheese, whereby the cheese melts to form a uniform mass of cheese. The<br>
cheeses can generally be heated in a variety of microwaves, such as microwaves having<br>
wattages of 400-1000 watts, or full power microwave ovens of 650-85.0 watts that are<br>
common home microwave ovens. The cheeses can be cooked over a range of cooking times<br>
such as from 0.5 to 20 minutes, or 0.5-10 minutes, or 2-5 minutes, which are the typical<br>
microwave cook times used to prepare frozen or refrigerated entrees and appetizers.<br>
[0163] The soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses that are disclosed herein can be combined with<br>
food products such as those just listed using any of a variety of methods. For example, the<br>
food product can be dipped in melted cheese. Alternatively, the cheese can be sprinkled or<br>
layered onto the food product using conventional food processing equipment. In such<br>
processes, die cheese is typically first comminuted to form relatively small pieces of cheese<br>
or shredded cheese. Once the cheese has been combined with the food product, the resulting<br>
food product can optionally be refrigerated or frozen for future sale or use.<br>
[0164] The following examples are presented to illustrate certain aspects of the methods<br>
and soft or firm/semi-hard cheeses that are disclosed herein. These examples should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the claims.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0165] Three different levels of nonfat dry milk (NDM) (2.5%, 6.0%, and 12.0%, by<br>
weight) were incorporated into Mozzarella cheese, either directly in powder form (see<br>
Examples a, c, and e) or as part of a slurry added to the cheese curds (see Examples b, d, and<br>
f). The slurry compositions included the NDM, as well as salt, cream, water, and gluconic<br>
acid, where the gluconic acid is added to the slurry as a processing aid to cause a reduction in<br>
[0166] The final cheese product included conventional starter cultures and the composition<br>
targets were 49.0% moisture, 40.0 FDB, 5.35 pH, and 1.80% salt. Ribbon™ cheese (7 x 9 x<br>
2-inches) was extruded and tire packaged cheese samples were stored at 35°F (1.7°C) for 14<br>
days before being shredded on an Urchell CC shredder (Urchell Laboratories, Inc., Indiana,<br>
USA) into cuts with approximate dimensions of 1.25"-3" by 0.20" by 0.095". The cuts were<br>
individually frozen and stored at -20°F. Two-pound samples of cheese were removed,<br>
thawed at 35°F (1.7°C) and melted on two different types of pizza, including a conveyor-bake<br>
pizza (Middleby Marshall oven at 420°F (215.6°C) for 6.5 minutes) composed of 7-oz of<br>
cheese on a regular pizza crust with 4-oz of pizza sauce. The cheese was also melted on a<br>
frozen pizza composed of 5.6-oz of frozen cheese placed on a ready-made crust with 3-oz of<br>
sauce and frozen for 24 hrs prior to melting in a home oven at 425°F for 19 minutes.<br>
[0167) The shred cut qualities and melt grades of the cheeses produced in Examples a-f<br>
were then measured. The melt grade measurements of the cheeses on the service oven pizzas<br>
and cooked frozen pizzas included comparisons of the blister color, blister %, blister size,<br>
melt, stretch, and oiling-off. The melt grade measurements were made with a 20-point scale,<br>
with 10 being the best grade, while 1 is too little, and 20 is too much. Table 2 summarizes<br>
the melt grade grading system:<br>
[0169] FIGS. 5A-B show the difference in the quality of the final cheese products when the<br>
NDM is added directly as a powder to the cheese curd versus adding the NDM as a<br>
component of a liquid slurry. Adding the dry powder NDM at both the 6% and 12% levels<br>
causes powdered lumps in the finished cheese as shown in FIG. 5A. The lumps give the<br>
cheese an inferior taste and feel, and can also damage dicer blades that are used to shred the<br>
cheese. In contrast, a slurry that is added to cheese having NDM at the same levels (i.e., 6%<br>
and 12% by wt. NDM in the finished cheese) results in a smooth, homogenous finished<br>
cheese as shown in FIG. 5B.<br><br>
[0170] It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for<br>
illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be<br>
suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of<br>
this application and scope of the appended claims. The cheeses of the present invention may<br>
be made by the methods described herein, or by any other method that produces a finished<br>
cheese product having the same physical or chemical properties as the present cheeses. All<br>
publications, patents and patent applications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference<br>
in their entirety for all purposes to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent or<br>
patent application were specifically and individually indicated to be so incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
