				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a potting method and an apparatus for potting hollow fibre membranes typically used in filtration systems.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The potting materials used to support and hold arrays of porous hollow fibre membranes are usually a compromise between materials which have sufficient rigidity to provide adequate support but sufficient softness and flexibility to avoid breakage of the fibres where they enter the pot. Too rigid a material produces rapid breakage of fibres adjacent the pot while too soft a material does not have sufficient mechanical strength to adequately support the fibres. The materials are also chosen to resist breakdown as a result of exposure to various types of feed as well as cleaning fluids used to maintain the fibres.<br>
Known systems employ single layers of epoxy, polyurethane or silicon materials, however, each suffer from the disadvantages outlined above.<br>
The present invention seeks to overcome or at least ameliorate one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art outlined above or at least provide a useful alternative.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect, the present invention provides a method of forming a pot for an array of hollow fibre membranes including the steps of placing the ends of said fibre membranes in a mould; forming a first layer of curable resin material in a non-cured state around said fibre membrane ends, applying a second layer of polyurethane resin material to said first layer prior to<br><br><br>

The invention therefore provides a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof for use in therapy, in particular in human medicine.<br>
There is also provided as a further aspect of the invention the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof in the preparation of a medicament for use in the treatment of conditions mediated by CRF.<br>
In an alternative or further aspect there is provided a method for the treatment of a mammal, including man, in particular in the treatment of condition mediated by CRF, comprising administration of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a solvate thereof.<br>
It will be appreciated that reference to treatment is intended to include prophylaxis as well as the alleviation of established symptoms.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be administered as the raw chemical but the active ingredient is preferably presented as a pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
Accordingly, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises at least one compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and formulated for administration by any convenient route. Such compositions are preferably in a form adapted for use in medicine, in particular human medicine, and can conveniently be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.<br>
Thus compounds of formula (I) may be formulated for oral, buccal, parenteral, topical (including ophthalmic and nasal), depot or rectal administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth or nose).<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycollate); or wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g. almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavouring, colouring and sweetening agents as appropriate.<br>
Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound.<br>
For buccal administration the composition may take the form of tablets or formulated in conventional manner.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for topical administration in the form of ointments, creams, gels, lotions, pessaries, aerosols or drops (e.g. eye, ear or nose drops). Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Ointments for administration to the eye may be manufactured in a sterile manner using sterilised components.<br>
Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents. Drops may be formulated with an aqueous or non-aqueous base also comprising one or more dispersing agents, stabilising agents, solubilising agents or suspending agents. They may also contain a preservative.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds of the invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt<br>
For intranasal administration, the compounds of the invention may be formulated as solutions ~ for administration via a suitable metered or unitary dose device or alternatively as a powder mix with a suitable carrier for administration using a suitable delivery device.<br>
A proposed dose of the compounds of the invention is 1 to about l000mg per day. It will be appreciated that it may be necessary to make routine variations to the dosage, depending on the age and condition of the patient and the precise dosage will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. The dosage will also depend on the route of administration and the particular compound selected.<br>
Thus for parenteral administration a daily dose will typically be in the range of 1 to about 100 mg, preferably 1 to 80 mg per day. For oral administration a daily dose will typically be within the range 1 to 300 mg e.g. 1 to 100 mg.<br>

EXAMPLE 5 CRF Binding Activity<br>
CRF binding affinity has been determined in vitro by the compounds' ability to displace I25I-oCRF and I25I-Sauvagine for CRF1 and CRF2 SPA, respectively, from recombinant human CRF receptors expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell membranes. For membrane preparation, CHO cells from confluent T-flasks were collected in SPA buffer (HEPES/KOH 50mM, EDTA 2mM; MgCl2 l0mM, pH 7.4.) in 50mL centrifuge tubes, homogenized with a Polytron and centrifuged (50'000g for 5min at 4°C: Beckman centrifuge with JA20 rotor). The pellet was resuspended, homogenized and centrifuged as before.<br>
The SPA experiment has been carried out in Optiplate by the addition of 100 μL the reagent<br>
mixture to l μL of compound dilution (100% DMSO solution) per well. The assay mixture<br>
was prepared by mixing SPA buffer, WGA SPA beads (2.5mg/mL), BSA (Img/mL) and<br>
membranes (50 and 5 μg of protein/mL for CRF1 and CRF2 respectively) and 50 pM of<br>
radioligand.<br>
The plate was incubated overnight (&gt;18 hr) at room temperature and read with the Packard<br>
Topcount with a WGA-SPA I25I counting protocol.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 CRF functional assay<br>
Compounds of the invention were characterised in a functional assay for the determination of their inhibitory effect. Human CRF-CHO cells were stimulated with CKF and the receptor activation was evaluated by measuring the accumulation of cAMP.<br>
CHO cells from a confluent T-flask were resuspended with culture medium without G418 and dispensed in a 96-well plate, 25'000c/well, 100 μL/well and incubated overnight. After the incubation the medium was replaced with 100 uL of cAMP IBMX buffer warmed at 37°C (5mM KC1, 5mM NaHCO3, 154mM NaCl, 5mM HEPES, 2.3mM CaCl2, ImM MgCl2; Ig/L glucose, pH 7.4 additioned by Img/mL BSA and ImM IBMX) and lμL of antagonist dilution in neat DMSO. After 10 additional minutes of incubation at 37°C in a plate incubator without CO2, lμL of agonist dilution in neat DMSO was added. As before, the plate was incubated for 10 minutes and then cAMP cellular content was measured by using the Amersham RPA 538 kit<br>
