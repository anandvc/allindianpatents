Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to alternative fuel for diesel engine. The alternative fuel using Poon oil composition-diesel blend can be effectively used in diesel engine with better fuel characteristics and emission standards.<br>
Objective of Invention<br>
To establish that the Poon oil composition-diesel blend as alternative fuel for diesel engine.<br>
Background and Introduction<br>
The world is presently confronted with the twin crises of fossil fuel depletion and environmental degradation. Indiscriminate extraction and lavish consumption of fossil fuels led to reduction in underground-based carbon resources. The search for alternative fuels, which promise a harmonious correlation with sustainable development, energy conservation, efficiency and environmental preservation has become highly pronounced in the present context. The fuels of bio-origin can provide a feasible solution to this worldwide petroleum crisis. India's demand for diesel is five times greater than petrol. Rapid economic growth has meant more people traveling than ever before and larger quantities of goods being transported. Transportation and agricultural sectors are the major consumers of fossil fuels and biggest contributors to environmental pollution, which can be reduced by replacing mineral-based fuels by bio-origin renewable fuels. There are varieties of bio fuels potentially available, but the main bio fuel being considered globally is bio-diesel.<br>
Higher Nitrogen Oxide Emissions: Since bio-diesel contains no nitrogen, the increase in NOx emissions is probably due to the higher cetane rating and the high oxygen content of bio-diesel. These two qualities are thought to cause the nitrogen contained in the air to be converted into NOx during combustion.<br>
Bio-diesel's primary advantage lies in its higher cetane number, low emissions, higher flash point, and greater lubricity. The higher cetane number<br><br>
does shorten the ignition delay and bio-diesel's lower volatility tends to reduce the rate at which fuel is prepared to burn during the ignition delay period. These two factors contribute to a more gradual start of combustion, easy cold starting and low idle noise. This gradual start of combustion reduces the emission of harmful pollutants (mainly smoke, 100% less sulfur dioxide) when compared to that of diesel engines.<br>
Many researchers have proved that bio-diesel is the best substitute for diesel. For instance the technical paper presented by MrP.Thangamuthu and G.M.Genekar at 4th International Biofuels Conference held on Feb 1-2, 2007 at New Delhi organized by Winrock International India shows that the Pinnari oil (poon oil) can be used as a suitable alternative fuel for diesel,<br>
Potential and Characterization of Sterculla Foetida seed oil (Poon oil)<br>
Sterculia Foetida (Poon Tree),<br>
The species has been planted widely throughout the tropics and it originates from old world tropics, A moderate sized to large, handsome tree, sometimes attaining a height of 30m. found on the west coast from Konkan southwards. The tree is often grown for ornament and on the roadsides especially in South India, but the foetid odour of the flowers is a disadvantage. It can easily be raised from seed and ripened cuttings; seedlings may be transplanted during the first rains, without much difficulty. The single, large seed is surrounded by a shell and a thin 1-2 mm layer of pulp. The fruit is at first white in color and later turning to black and when ripe it turns into shining blue black. And kernel is white in color. One hundred numbers of seeds weigh 200-250g. The kernel of the seed yields 40-50% of bland, light - yellow fatty oil. The seed oil is suitable for culinary purposes but is mostly used as an illuminant; other likely uses are in the surface-coating industry and soap making industry.<br>
Expelling of oils from oil seeds<br>
The tree borne oil seeds were dried in the hot sun for 6-8 days, after that the hard shell has been removed by crushing with hammer. Various expellers are<br><br>
used to expel the oil depending upon the seed quantity and quality. Usually power operated rotary machineries are used for expelling the oil from seeds.<br>
The raw Poon oil was extracted by mechanical expeller in which small traces of organic matter, water and other impurities were present. These materials were creating problems during bio-diesel preparation. This was overcome by adding hexane to the raw oil and stirring for 15 to 20 minutes at 30° to 40°C and settled for 30 minutes. The impurities were settled down in another 30 minutes and then removed. Thus the organic matter, water and other impurities were removed and pure poon oil was obtained. The poon oil was chemically altered to obtain poon oil composition. The physico-chemical properties of poon oil composition are listed in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
The Poon oil composition was also tested for its fatty acid contents in a gas chromatography (GC) test for the purpose of finding out the predominant fatty acid components and for calculating the molecular weight of the oil. The above gas chromatography shows the wave form obtained from the GC test, which gives the resident time of different fatty acid components, from which the percentage of major fatty acid components present in the oil were obtained. The fatty acid contents of the oil are given in Table 2. It is observed from the table that poon oil composition consists of fatty acids ranging from C16H32 to C20H40.<br><br><br>
Economical feasibility of bio-diesel<br>
India has rich and abundant forest resources with a wide range of plants and oil seeds. The production of these oilseeds can be stepped up, if the government takes the decision to use them for producing bio-diesel. Economical feasibility of bio-diesel depends on the price of the crude petroleum and the cost of transporting diesel to remote markets in India. It is certain that the cost of crude petroleum is bound to increase due to increase in its demand and limited supply.<br>
Description   of   properties   of   Peon   oil   composition   and   method   of application in Direct injection diesel engine (D.l. diesel engine).<br>
The present work describes how Poon oil composition can be used as an alternate fuel to diesel. The various properties of Poon oil composition are presented in Table IThey are quite comparable with the properties of conventional diesel fuel.<br>
The Poon oil composition can be admitted into the diesel engine in the following methods. They are 1) Bio-diesel (methyl ester of poon oil) and diesel blend, 2) 100% bio-diesel injection. 3) Thirming bio-diesel by blending with ethanol.<br>
Among the above methods, bio-diesel and diesel blend is the best method of admitting poon oil composition into D.l. diesel engine. The test results were quite comparable with diesel base line operation and the emission performance is slightly superior to diesel base line run.<br>
The performance of poon oil composition-diesel blends were explored in the present work at various proportions such as 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 100%. They are named as 20 PO, 30 PO, 40 PO, 50 PO and 100 PO.<br>
The poon oil composition has low heating value (6% lower than the diesel because of presence of substantial amount of oxygen in the fuel) but at the same time it has a higher specific gravity (0.88) as compared to diesel (0.84) resulting in approximately 3% lower energy content. Therefore, the present<br><br>
experimental work aims at finding the effect of various proportions of the blends on the performance of the engine.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention explains how the Poon oil composition-diesel blend comprising the linoleic acid as major constituent can be used as an alternative fuel to D.l.diesel engine. It was found from the investigation that the 40% poon oil composition and 60% diesel blend (40 PO) has produced lesser emissions than diesel fuel and other blends. The 40 PO blend has higher thermal efficiency when compared to neat diesel operation without any engine modification. The poon oil composition is having the similar characteristics of the diesel oil and can be fueled through conventional fueling system without any engine modification.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
Fuel preparation and blend behavior<br>
The Poon oil extracted from Poon seeds can be utilized in D.I. diesel engine in the form of blends with diesel and as neat poon oil composition. This was proved in a D.I. diesel engine by conducting experiments using poon oil composition-diesel blend in various proportions. The experimental set-up used for the investigation is shown in Fig.1.<br>
The test fuels were prepared in four ratios of poon oil composition-diesel blends with following proportions:<br>
•	20% Poon oil composition and 80% diesel oil named as 20 PO<br>
•	30% Poon oil composition and 70% diesel oil named as 30 PO<br>
•	40% Poon oil composition and 60% diesel oil named as 40 PO<br>
•	50% Poon oil composition and 50% diesel oil named as 50 PO<br>
•	100% Poon oil composition named as 100 PO<br>
As the poon oil composition increases in the blend, calorific value decreases and viscosity increases. Hence blends above 40 PO is not suggested for the engine suitable for diesel oil application.<br><br>
Experimental Procedure<br>
As explained in the invention, the poon oil composition-diesel blends (20 PO, 30 PO, 40 PO, 50 PO and 100 PO) are tested in the standard engine set-up as shown in the Fig 1.<br>
1.	The whole test was conducted for the standard engine injection pressure<br>
and injection timing,<br>
2.	The first test was conducted using 100% diesel fuel to establish base line<br>
for emission, and performance.<br>
3.	The various  Poon  oil  composition-diesel  blends  were  prepared  as<br>
mentioned above and fueled into the engine one by one.<br>
4.	The emission and the performance of the blends were compared with the<br>
base line readings,<br>
5.	Based on the improved performance and lower emission the optimum<br>
blend has been identified as 40 PO.<br><br><br>
Description of the Drawings<br>
Fig.1. shows the schematic diagram of the experimental setup. The test engine used was Kirloskar TAF1. Specification of the engine is given in Table 3. A single cylinder four-stroke air-cooled diesel engine developing 4,4 kW at 1500 rpm was used for the experiments. This engine was coupled to a BENZ eddy-current dynamometer with control system. It is capable of maintaining the speed very accurately with an accuracy of 1 rpm. The loads were varied by means of a load cell. Time taken for fuel consumption was measured using a digital stopwatch. Chromel alumel thermocouple in conjunction with a digital temperature indicator was used for measuring the exhaust gas temperature. The cylinder pressure was measured by piezoelectric pressure transducer (Kistler) fitted on the engine cylinder head. A crank angle encoder was fitted on the flywheel to mark the TDC. Both the pressure transducer and encoder signal were connected to the charge amplifier to condition the signals.<br>
An orifice meter was used to measure the air consumption of the engine. Exhaust emission from the engine was measured with the help of QRO TECH, QEO-402 gas analyzer. Smoke emission was measured with the help of Bosch Smoke meter. It consists of a piston type sampling pump and a smoke level measuring unit. A sampling probe was used to receive sample exhaust gases from the engine for measuring emissions. A 2-inch diameter filter paper was used to collect smoke samples from the engine through smoke sampling pump for measuring smoke.<br>
Fig.2. shows the effect of poon oil composition-diesel blend on smoke emission. It is seen from the figure that the smoke is much lower for the poon oil composition-diesel blend and maximum reduction (about 64.5% at 75% load) of smoke occurs for 40 PO.<br>
Fig.3. shows the effect of poon oil composition-diesel blend on brake thermal efficiency. It is observed from the figure that there is an increase in brake thermal efficiency for 40 PO both at 75% and 100% load conditions. However, there are no differences at lower load conditions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim<br>
1.	A Poon oil composition -diesel blend comprising the linoleic acid as major constituent can be used as a alternative fuel to D.I. diesel engine. 40% Poon oil composition-diesel (40 PO) produces lesser emissions with higher thermal efficiency in standard diesel engine of conventional fueling system without any engine modifications.<br>
2.	The Poon oil composition -diesel blend as claimed in claim 1, wherein the maximum blend ratio of 40% Poon oil composition-diesel at 30°C ambient temperature offers better engine performance than diesel fuel.<br>
3.	The Poon oil composition -diesel blend as claimed in claim 2, wherein the fuel consumption of blend is nearly equal to that of fuel consumption of a regular diesel fueled engine.<br>
4.	The Poon oil composition-diesel as claimed in 2, wherein calorific value of Poon oil composition-diesel is almost equivalent with calorific value of diesel fuel.<br>
5.	The Poon oil composition-diesel as claimed in claim 1, wherein the maximum blend ratio of 40% poon oil composition - diesel offers maximum smoke reduction of 64.5% in D.I. diesel engine.<br><br>
6.	The Poon oil diesel composition as claimed in any of the claims wherein<br>
the blend shows that the important properties of bio-diesel are in close<br>
agreement with the commercial diesel making it potential candidate for the<br>
application in diesel engines as a solution for the petro crisis.<br>
7.	The Poon oil-diesel blend composition is being used as an alternative fuel<br>
to Dl diesel engine substantially as herein described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawing.<br><br></td>
