DOMAIN”<br>
APPLICANT AND ADDRESS:<br>

NATIONALITY: US<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is<br>
to be performed.<br>
2<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This disclosure relates generally to antibodies containing one or more modular recognition<br>
domains and more specifically to the use of the antibodies containing one or more modular<br>
recognition domains to treat disease, and methods of making antibodies containing one or<br>
more modular recognition domains.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Catalytically active monoclonal antibodies (Abs) can be used for selective prodrug activation<br>
and chemical transformations. Monoclonal Abs with aldolase activity have emerged as<br>
highly efficient catalysts for a number of chemical transformations, particularly aldol and<br>
retro-aldol reactions. The retro-aldolase activity of Abs, such as 38C2 and 93F3, have<br>
allowed researchers to design, synthesize, and evaluate prodrugs of various chemotherapeutic<br>
agents that can be activated by retro-aldol reactions. (Construction of 38C2 was described in<br>
WO 97/21803, herein incorporated by reference). 38C2 contains an antibody combining site<br>
that catalyzes the aldol addition reaction between an aliphatic donor and an aldehyde<br>
acceptor. In a syngeneic mouse model of neuroblastoma, systemic administration of an<br>
etoposide prodrug and intra-tumor injection of 38C2 inhibited tumor growth.<br>
One drawback in the use of catalytic Abs is that they lack a device to target the catalytic Ab<br>
to the malignant cells. Previous studies demonstrated that in an antibody-directed enzyme<br>
prodrug therapy (ADEPT) or antibody-directed abzyme prodrug therapy (ADAPT) approach,<br>
enzymes or catalytic antibodies can be directed to tumor cells by chemical conjugation or<br>
recombinant fusion to targeting antibodies. However, a more efficient alternative would be<br>
using the catalytic antibody fused to a targeting peptide located outside the antibody<br>
combining site, thereby leaving the active site available for the prodrug activation. For<br>
example, the fusion of Ab 38C2 to an integrin αvβ3-binding peptide would selectively<br>
localize the antibody to the tumor and/or the tumor vasculature and trigger prodrug activation<br>
at that site. The potential therapy of this approach is supported by preclinical and phase Ill<br>
clinical data suggesting that peptides can be converted into viable drugs through fusion to<br>
antibody Fc regions.<br>
The development of bispecific or multi-specific antibodies that target two or more cancer<br>
targets simultaneously and or activate prodrugs offers a novel and promising solution to<br>
attacking cancer and other diseases. Such antibodies are exemplified in Figure 1 of the<br>
3<br>
present application. Studies of bispecific antibodies (BsAb) that simultaneously target two<br>
tumor-associated antigens (e.g. growth factor receptors) for down-regulation of multiple cell<br>
proliferation/survival pathways has provided support for this approach.Traditionally,<br>
bispecific antibodies have been prepared by chemically linking two different monoclonal<br>
antibodies or by fusing two hybridoma cell lines to produce a hybrid-hybridoma. Dualspecific,<br>
tetravalent IgG-like molecules, or dual-variable-domain immunoglobins, have been<br>
engineered from two monoclonal antibodies. Thes dual-variable-domain immunoglobins are<br>
capable of binding both antigens in the presence of serum. However, these approaches<br>
present challenges with respect to manufacturing, yield and purity.<br>
A variety of recombinant methods have been developed for efficient production of small<br>
BsAb fragments such as diabody, minibody, and Fab-scFv fusion proteins. These BsAb<br>
fragments may possess some advantages over the full-length IgG-like molecules for certain<br>
clinical applications, such as for tumor radio-imaging and targeting, because of better tissue<br>
penetration and faster clearance from the circulation. On the other hand, IgG-like BsAb may<br>
prove to be preferred over smaller BsAb fragments for other in vivo applications, specifically<br>
for oncology indications, by providing the Fc domain that confers long serum half-life and<br>
supports secondary immune function, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and<br>
complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Unlike their fragment counterparts, engineering and<br>
production of recombinant IgG-like BsAb has been, however, rather technically challenging<br>
due to their large size (~150-200 kDa) and structural complexity. Success in the field, as<br>
judged by successful application in animal models, has been very limited. Recently, with the<br>
examination of a variety of constructs, the efficient expression of Fc domain containing BsAb<br>
molecules in mammalian cells has made some strides.<br>
Another approach that has been used to target antibodies is through the use of peptibodies.<br>
Peptibodies are essentially peptide fusions with antibody Fc regions. Given the success of<br>
studies using random peptide libraries to find high-affinity peptide ligands for a wide variety<br>
of targets, fusion of such peptides to antibody Fc regions provides a means of making<br>
peptides into therapeutic candidates by increasing their circulatory half-life and activity<br>
through increased valency.<br>
Protein interactions with other molecules are basic to biochemistry. Protein interactions<br>
include receptor-ligand interactions, antibody-antigen interactions, cell-cell contact and<br>
pathogen interactions with target tissues. Protein interactions can involve contact with other<br>
4<br>
proteins, with carbohydrates, oligosaccharides, lipids, metal ions and the like materials. The<br>
basic unit of protein interaction is the region of the protein involved in contact and<br>
recognition, and is referred to as the binding site or target site.<br>
Peptides derived from phage display libraries typically retain their binding characteristics<br>
when linked to other molecules. Specific peptides of this type can be treated as modular<br>
specificity blocks or molecular recognition domains (MRDs) that can be combined to create a<br>
single protein with binding specificities for several defined targets.<br>
An example of such a defined target site is integrin. Integrins are a family of transmembrane<br>
cell adhesion receptors that are composed of α and β subunits and mediate cell attachment to<br>
proteins within the extracellular matrix. At present, eighteen α and eight β subunits are<br>
known; these form 24 different αβ heterodimers with different specificities for various ECM<br>
cell-adhesive proteins. Ligands for various integrins include fibronectin, collagen, laminin,<br>
von Willebrand factor, osteopontin, thrombospondin, and vitronectin, which are all<br>
components of the ECM. Certain integrins can also bind to soluble ligands such as<br>
fibrinogen or to other adhesion molecules on adjacent cells. Integrins are known to exist in<br>
distinct activation states that exhibit different affinities for ligand. Recognition of soluble<br>
ligands by integrins strictly depends on specific changes in receptor conformation. This<br>
provides a molecular switch that controls the ability of cells to aggregate in an integrin<br>
dependent manner and to arrest under the dynamic flow conditions of the vasculature. This<br>
mechanism is well established for leukocytes and platelets that circulate within the blood<br>
stream in a resting state while expressing non-activated integrins. Upon stimulation through<br>
proinflammatory or prothrombotic agonists, these cell types promptly respond with a number<br>
of molecular changes including the switch of key integrins, β2 integrins for leucocytes and<br>
αvβ3 for platelets, from “resting” to “activated” conformations. This enables these cell types<br>
to arrest within the vasculature, promoting cell cohesion and leading to thrombus formation.<br>
It has been demonstrated that a metastatic subset of human breast cancer cells expresses<br>
integrin αvβ3 in a constitutively activated form. This aberrant expression of αvβ3 plays a<br>
role in metastasis of breast cancer as well as prostate cancer, melanoma, and neuroblastic<br>
tumors. The activated receptor strongly promotes cancer cell migration and enables the cells<br>
to arrest under blood flow conditions. In this way, activation of αvβ3 endows metastatic cells<br>
with key properties likely to be critical for successful dissemination and colonization of target<br>
organs. Tumor cells that have successfully entered a target organ may further utilize αvβ3 to<br>
5<br>
thrive in the new environment, as αvβ3 matrix interactions can promote cell survival and<br>
proliferation. For example, αvβ3 binding to osteopontin promotes malignancy and elevated<br>
levels of osteopontin correlate with a poor prognosis in breast cancer.<br>
For these reasons, and for its established role in angiogenesis, the αvβ3 integrin is one of the<br>
most widely studied integrins. Antagonists of this molecule have significant potential for use<br>
in targeted drug delivery. One approach that has been used to target αvβ3 integrin uses the<br>
high binding specificity to αvβ3 of peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence.<br>
This tripeptide, naturally present in extracellular matrix proteins, is the primary binding site<br>
of the αvβ3 integrin. However, RGD based reporter probes are problematic due to fast blood<br>
clearance, high kidney and liver uptake and fast tumor washout. Chemical modification of<br>
cyclised RGD peptides has been shown to increase their stability and valency. These<br>
modified peptides are then coupled to radio-isotpes and used either for tumor imaging or to<br>
inhibit tumor growth.<br>
lntegrin αvβ3 is one of the most well characterized integrin heterodimers and is one of several<br>
heterodimers that have been implicated in tumor-induced angiogenesis. While sparingly<br>
expressed in mature blood vessels, αvβ3 is significantly up-regulated during angiogenesis in<br>
vivo. The expression of αvβ3 correlates with aggressiveness of disease in breast and cervical<br>
cancer as well as in malignant melanoma. Recent studies suggest that αvβ3 may be useful as<br>
a diagnostic or prognostic indicator for some tumors. Integrin αvβ3 is particularly attractive<br>
as a therapeutic target due to its relatively limited cellular distribution. It is not generally<br>
expressed on epithelial cells, and minimally expressed on other cell types. Furthermore,<br>
αvβ3 antagonists, including both cyclic RGD peptides and monoclonal antibodies,<br>
significantly inhibit cytokine-induced angiogenesis and the growth of solid tumor on the<br>
chick chorioallantoic membrane.<br>
Another integrin heterodimer, αvβ5, is more widely expressed on malignant tumor cells and<br>
is likely involved in VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. It has been shown that αvβ3 and αvβ5<br>
promote angiogenesis via distinct pathways: αvβ3 through bFGF and TNF-a, and αvβ5<br>
through VEGF and TGF-α. It has also been shown that inhibition of Src kinase can block<br>
VEGF-induced, but not FGF2-induced, angiogenesis. These results strongly imply that FGF2<br>
and VEGF activate different angiogenic pathways that require αvβ3 and αvβ5, respectively.<br>
6<br>
Integrins have also been implicated in tumor metastasis. Metastasis is the primary cause of<br>
morbidity and mortality in cancer. Malignant progression of melanoma, glioma, ovarian and<br>
breast cancer have all been strongly linked with the expression of the integrin αvβ3 and in<br>
some cases with αvβ5. More recently, it has been shown that activation of integrin αvβ3 play<br>
a significant role in metastasis in human breast cancer. A very strong correlation between<br>
expression of αvβ3 and breast cancer metastasis has been noted where normal breast epithelia<br>
are αvβ3 negative and approximately 50% of invasive lobular carcinomas and nearly all bone<br>
metastases in breast cancer express αvβ3. Antagonism of αvβ3 with a cyclic peptide has been<br>
shown to synergize with radioimmunotherapy in studies involving breast cancer xenografts.<br>
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones, is essential to may<br>
physiological and pathological processes. Normally, angiogenesis is tightly regulated by proand<br>
anti-angiogenic factors, but in the case of diseases such as cancer, ocular neovascular<br>
disease, arthritis and psoriasis, the process can go awry. The association of angiogenesis with<br>
disease has made the discovery of anti-angiogenic compound attractive. The most promising<br>
phage derived anti-angiogenic peptide described to date, developed by Amgen, neutralizes<br>
the angiogenic cytokine Ang2.<br>
While the VEGFs and their receptors have been among the most extensively targeted<br>
molecules in the angiogenesis field, preclinical efforts targeting the more recently discovered<br>
angiopoietin-Tie2 pathway are underway. Both protein families involve ligand receptor<br>
interactions, and both include members whose functions are largely restricted postnatally to<br>
endothelial cells and some hematopoietic stem cell lineages. Tie-2 is a receptor tyrosine<br>
kinase with four known ligands, angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) through angiopoietin-4 (Ang4), the<br>
best studied being Angl and Ang2. Ang1 stimulates phosphorylation of Tie2 and the Ang2<br>
interaction with Tie2 has been shown to both antagonize and agonize Tie2 receptor<br>
phosphorylation. Elevated Ang2 expression at sites of normal and pathological postnatal<br>
angiogenesis circumstantially implies a proangiogenic role for Ang2. Vessel-selective Ang2<br>
induction associated with angiogenesis has been demonstrated in diseases including cancer.<br>
In patients with colon carcinoma, Ang2 is expressed ubiquitously in tumor epithelium,<br>
whereas expression of Ang1 in tumor epithelium was shown to be rare. The net gain of Ang2<br>
activity has been suggested to be an initiating factor for tumor angiogenesis.<br>
Other fusion proteins directed towards cellular receptors are under clinical evaluation.<br>
Herceptin (Trastuzumab), developed by Genentech, is a recombinant humanized monoclonal<br>
7<br>
antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the human epidermal tyrosine kinase<br>
receptor 2 (HER2 or ErbB2). The HER2 gene is overexpressed in 25% of invasive breast<br>
cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis and altered sensitivity to chemotherapeutic<br>
agents. Herceptin blocks the proliferation of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers, and is<br>
currently the only ErbB2 targeted antibody therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of<br>
ErbB2 over-expressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC). In normal adult cells, few ErbB2<br>
molecules exist at the cell surface ~ 20,000 per cell, so few heterodimers are formed and<br>
growth signals are relatively weak and controllable. When ErbB2 is overexpressed, ~<br>
500,000 per cell, multiple ErbB2 heterodimers are formed and cell signaling is stronger,<br>
resulting in enhanced responsiveness to growth factors and malignant growth. This explains<br>
why ErbB2 overexpression is an indicator of poor prognosis in breast tumors and may be<br>
predictive of response to treatment.<br>
ErbB2 is a promising and validated target for breast cancer, where it is found both in primary<br>
tumor and metastatic sites. Herceptin induces rapid removal of ErbB2 from the cell surface,<br>
thereby reducing its availability to heterodimerize and promote growth. Mechanisms of<br>
action of Herceptin observed in experimental in vitro and in vivo models include inhibition of<br>
proteolysis of ErbB2's extracellular domain, disruption of downstream signaling pathways<br>
such as phosphatidylinositiol 3-kinase (P13K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)<br>
cascades, GI cell-cycle arrest, inhibition of DNA repair, suppression of angiogenesis and<br>
induction of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The majority of patients with<br>
metastatic breast cancer who initially respond to Herceptin, however, demonstrate disease<br>
progression within one year of treatment initiation.<br>
Another target cellular receptor is type 1 insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), IGF-<br>
1R is a receptor-tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in signaling cell survival and<br>
proliferation. The IGF system is frequently deregulated in cancer cells by the establishment<br>
of autocrine loops involving IGF-I or -II and/or IGF-1R overexpression. Moreover,<br>
epidemiological studies have suggested a link between elevated IGF levels and the<br>
development of major human cancers, such as breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer.<br>
Expression of IGFs and their cognate receptors has been correlated with disease stage,<br>
reduced survival, development of metastases and tumor de-differentiation.<br>
Besides IGF-1R, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has also been implicated in the<br>
tumorigenesis of numerous cancers. Effective tumor inhibition has been achieved both<br>
8<br>
experimentally and clinically with a number of strategies that antagonize either receptor<br>
activity. Because of the redundancy of growth signaling pathways in tumor cells, inhibition<br>
of one receptor function (e.g. EGFR) could be effectively compensated by up-regulation of<br>
other growth factor receptor (e.g. IGF-1R)-mediated pathways. For example, a recent study<br>
has shown that malignant glioma cell lines expressing equivalent EGFR had significantly<br>
different sensitivity to EGFR inhibition depending on their capability of activating IGF-1R<br>
and its downstream signaling pathways. Other studies have also demonstrated that<br>
overexpression and/or activation of IGF-1R in tumor cells might contribute to their resistance<br>
to chemotherapeutic agents, radiation, or antibody therapy such as Herceptin. And<br>
consequently, inhibition of IGF-1R signaling has resulted in increased sensitivity of tumor<br>
cells to Herceptin.<br>
EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed on many normal tissues as well as<br>
neoplastic lesions of most organs. Overexpression of EGFR or expression of mutant forms of<br>
EGFR has been observed in many tumors, particularly epithelial tumors, and is associated<br>
with poor clinical prognosis. Inhibition of signaling through this receptor induces an antitumor<br>
effect. With the FDA approval of Cetuximab, also known as Erbitux (a mouse/human<br>
chimeric antibody) in February of 2004, EGFR became an approved antibody drug target for<br>
the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. In March of 2006, Erbitux also received FDA<br>
approval for the treatment squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). More<br>
recently, Vectibix, a fully human antibody directed against EGFR, was approved for<br>
metastatic colorectal cancer. Neither drug is a stand-alone agent in colorectal cancer – they<br>
were approved as add-ons to existing colorectal regimens. In colorectal cancer, Erbitux is<br>
given in combination with the drug irinotecan and Vectibix is administered after disease<br>
progression on, or following fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan- containing<br>
chemotherapy regimens. Erbitux has been approved as a single agent in recurrent or<br>
metastatic SCCHN only where prior platinum-based chemotherapy has failed. Advanced<br>
clinical trials which use these drugs to target non-small cell lung carcinoma are ongoing.<br>
The sequence of Erbitux or the EGFR antibody, is well known in the art (see for example,<br>
Goldstein, et al., Clin.Cancer Res. 1:1311, 1995; U.S. Patent No. 6,217,866), herein<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
An obstacle in the utilization of a catalytic antibody for selective prodrug activation in cancer<br>
therapy has been systemic tumor targeting. The present disclosure describes an approach<br>
9<br>
based on the adaptation of target binding peptides, or modular recognition domains (MRDs),<br>
which are fused to full length antibodies that effectively target tumor cells or soluble<br>
molecules while retaining the prodrug activation capability of the catalytic antibody. Since<br>
the MRDs are fused to the antibody so as not to significantly mitigate binding to the<br>
antibody's traditional binding site, the antibody's specificity remains intact after MRD<br>
addition.<br>
As noted in Figure 2, MRDs, designated by triangles, circles, and squares, can be appended<br>
on any of the termini of either heavy or light chains of a typical antibody. The first schematic<br>
represents a simple peptibody with a peptide fused to the C-terminus of an Fc. This approach<br>
provided for the preparation of bi-, tri-, tetra, and penta-specific antibodies. Display of a<br>
single MRD at each N- and C-termini of an IgG provides for octavalent display of the MRD.<br>
As an alternative to the construction of bi- and multifunctional antibodies through the<br>
combination of antibody variable domains, high-affinity peptides selected from phage display<br>
libraries or derived from natural ligands may offer a highly versatile and modular approach to<br>
the construction of multifunctional antibodies that retain both the binding and half-life<br>
advantages of traditional antibodies. MRDs can also extend the binding capacity of noncatalytic<br>
antibodies, providing for an effective approach to extend the binding functionality of<br>
antibodies, particularly for therapeutic purposes.<br>

The present disclosure is also in relation to an isolated polynucleotide comprising a<br>
nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody.<br>
The present disclosure is also in relation to a vector comprising the polynucleotide.<br>
The present disclosure is also in relation to a host cell comprising the vector, or progeny of<br>
the cell.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, use of antibody or the peptide for<br>
treating a disease.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, the disease is cancer.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, the antibody or peptide inhibits<br>
angiogenesis, modulates angiogenesis, or inhibits tumor growth.<br>
The present disclosure is also in relation to a method for producing the antibody comprising<br>
selecting for a MRD using an MRD binding target, wherein the MRD is derived from a phage<br>
display library or from natural ligands.<br>
The term “antibody” used herein to refer to intact immunoglobulin molecules and includes<br>
polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, chimeric, single chain, and humanized antibodies. An<br>
intact antibody comprises at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains interconnected<br>
by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable<br>
region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain<br>
constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is<br>
20<br>
comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain<br>
constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and<br>
VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed<br>
complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more<br>
conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and<br>
four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxyl-terminus in the following order: FR1,<br>
CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains<br>
contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen.<br>
A “dual-specific antibody” is used herein to refer to an immunoglobulin molecule which<br>
contain dual-variable-domain immunoglobins, where the dual-variable-domain can be<br>
engineered from any two monoclonal antibodies.<br>
An “antibody combining site” is that structural portion of an antibody molecule comprised of<br>
a heavy and light chain variable and hypervariable regions that specifically binds<br>
(immunoreacts with) an antigen. The term “immunoreact” in its various forms means specific<br>
binding between an antigenic determinant-containing molecule and a molecule containing an<br>
antibody combining site such as a whole antibody molecule or a portion thereof.<br>
The term “peptibody” refers to a peptide or polypeptide which comprises less than a<br>
complete, intact antibody.<br>
The term “naturally occurring” when used in connection with biological materials such as a<br>
nucleic acid molecules, polypeptides, host cells, and the like refers to those which are found<br>
in nature and not modified by a human being.<br>
“Monoclonal antibody” refers to a population of antibody molecules that contain only one<br>
species of antibody combining site capable of immunoreacting with a particular epitope. A<br>
monoclonal antibody thus typically displays a single binding affinity for any epitope with<br>
which it immunoreacts. A monoclonal antibody may therefore contain an antibody molecule<br>
having a plurality of antibody combining sites, each immunospecific for a different epitope,<br>
e.g., a bispecific monoclonal antibody.<br>
A “modular recognition domain” (MRD) or “target binding peptide” is a molecule, such as a<br>
protein, glycoprotein and the like, that can specifically (non-randomly) bind to a target<br>
molecule. The amino acid sequence of a MRD site can tolerate some degree of variability<br>
21<br>
and still retain a degree of capacity to bind the target molecule. Furthermore, changes in the<br>
sequence can result in changes in the binding specificity and in the binding constant between<br>
a preselected target molecule and the binding site.<br>
“Cell surface receptor” refers to molecules and complexes of molecules capable of receiving<br>
a signal and the transmission of such a signal across the plasma membrane of a cell. An<br>
example of a cell surface receptor of the present disclosure is an activated integrin receptor,<br>
for example, an activated αvβ3 integrin receptor on a metastatic cell.<br>
The "target binding site” or “target site” is any known, or yet to be described, amino acid<br>
sequence having the ability to selectively bind a preselected agent. Exemplary reference<br>
target sites are derived from the RGD-dependent integrin ligands, namely fibronectin,<br>
fibrinogen, vitronectin, von Willebrand factor and the like, from cellular receptors such as<br>
VEGF, ErbB2, vascular homing peptide or angiogenic cytokines, from protein hormones<br>
receptors such as insulin-like growth factor-I receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor and<br>
the like, and from tumor antigens.<br>
The term “protein” is defined as a biological polymer comprising units derived from amino<br>
acids linked via peptide bonds; a protein can be composed of two or more chains.<br>
A “fusion polypeptide” is a polypeptide comprised of at least two polypeptides and optionally<br>
a linking sequence to operatively link the two polypeptides into one continuous polypeptide.<br>
The two polypeptides linked in a fusion polypeptide are typically derived from two<br>
independent sources, and therefore a fusion polypeptide comprises two linked polypeptides<br>
not normally found linked in nature.<br>
The term “linker” refers to a peptide located between the antibody and the MRD. Linkers<br>
can have from about 2 to 20 amino acids, usually 4 to 15 amino acids.<br>
“Target cell” refers to any cell in a subject (e.g., a human or animal) that can be targeted by<br>
the antibody comprising an MRD of the disclosure. The target cell can be a cell expressing<br>
or overexpressing the target binding site, such as activated integrin receptor.<br>
“Patient,” “subject,” “animal” or “mammal” are used interchangeably and refer to mammals<br>
such as human patients and non-human primates, as well as experimental animals such as<br>
22<br>
rabbits, rats, and mice, and other animals. Animals include all vertebrates, e.g., mammals and<br>
non-mammals, such as sheep, dogs, cows, chickens, amphibians, and reptiles.<br>
“Treating” or “treatment” includes the administration of the antibody comprising an MRD of<br>
the present disclosure to prevent or delay the onset of the symptoms, complications, or<br>
biochemical indicia of a disease, alleviating the symptoms or arresting or inhibiting further<br>
development of the disease, condition, or disorder. Treatment can be prophylactic (to prevent<br>
or delay the onset of the disease, or to prevent the manifestation of clinical or subclinical<br>
symptoms thereof) or therapeutic suppression or alleviation of symptoms after the<br>
manifestation of the disease. Treatment can be with the antibody-MRD composition alone,<br>
or it can be used in combination with an additional therapeutic agent.<br>
As used herein, the terms “pharmaceutically acceptable,” or “physiologically tolerable” and<br>
grammatical variations thereof, as they refer to compositions, carriers, diluents and reagents,<br>
are used interchangeably and represent that the materials are capable of administration to or<br>
upon a human without the production of undesirable physiological effects such as nausea,<br>
dizziness, gastric upset and the like.<br>
“Modulate,” means adjustment or regulation of amplitude, frequency, degree, or activity. In<br>
another related aspect, such modulation may be positively modulated (e.g., an increase in<br>
frequency, degree, or activity) or negatively modulated (e.g., a decrease in frequency, degree,<br>
or activity).<br>
“Cancer,” “tumor,” or “malignancy” are used as synonymous terms and refer to any of a<br>
number of diseases that are characterized by uncontrolled, abnormal proliferation of cells, the<br>
ability of affected cells to spread locally or through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to<br>
other parts of the body (metastasize) as well as any of a number of characteristic structural<br>
and/or molecular features. A “cancerous,” “tumor,” or “malignant cell” is understood as a<br>
cell having specific structural properties, lacking differentiation and being capable of<br>
invasion and metastasis. Examples of cancers are, breast, lung, brain, bone, liver, kidney,<br>
colon, head and neck, ovarian, hematopoietic (e.g., leukemia), and prostate cancer.<br>
“Humanized antibody” or “chimeric antibody” includes antibodies in which CDR sequences<br>
derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted<br>
onto human framework sequences.<br>
23<br>
The present disclosure describes an approach based on the adaptation of target binding<br>
peptides or modular recognition domains (MRDs) as fusions to catalytic or non-catalytic<br>
antibodies that provide for effective targeting of tumor cells or soluble molecules while<br>
leaving the prodrug activation capability of the catalytic antibody intact. MRDs can also<br>
extend the binding capacity of non-catalytic antibodies providing for an effective approach to<br>
extend the binding functionality of antibodies, particularly for therapeutic purposes.<br>
One aspect of the present disclosure relates to development of a full-length antibody<br>
comprising a modular recognition domain (MRD). The interaction between a protein ligand<br>
and its target receptor site often takes place at a relatively large interface. However, only a<br>
few key residues at the interface contribute to most of the binding. Thus, molecules of<br>
peptide length (generally 2 to 60 amino acids) can bind to the receptor protein of a given<br>
large protein ligand. It is contemplated that MRDs of the present disclosure contain a peptide<br>
sequence that bind to target sites of interests and are about 2 to 60 amino acids.<br>
The role of integrins such as αvβ3 and αvβ5 as tumor-associated markers has been well<br>
documented. A recent study of 25 permanent human cell lines established from advanced<br>
ovarian cancer demonstrated that all lines were positive for αvβ5 expression and many were<br>
positive for αvβ3 expression. Studies have also shown that αvβ3 and αvβ5 is highly<br>
expressed on malignant human cervical tumor tissues. Integrins have also demonstrated<br>
therapeutic effects in animal models of Kaposi's sarcoma, melanoma, and breast cancer.<br>
A number of integrin αvβ3 and αvβ5 antagonists are in clinical development. These include<br>
cyclic RGD peptides and synthetic small molecule RGD mimetics. Two antibody-based<br>
integrin antagonists are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. The first is<br>
Vitaxin, the humanized form of the murine anti-human αvβ3 antibody LM609. A doseescalating<br>
phase I study in cancer patients demonstrated that it was safe for use in humans.<br>
Another antibody in clinical trials is CNT095, a fully human mAb that recognizes αv<br>
integrins. A Phase I study of CNT095 in patients with a variety of solid tumors has shown<br>
that it is well tolerated. Cilengitide, a peptide antagonist of αvβ3 and αvβ5, has also proven<br>
safe in phase I trials. Furthermore, there has been numerous drug targeting and imaging<br>
studies based on the use of ligands for these receptors. These preclinical and clinical<br>
observations demonstrate the importance of targeting αvβ3 and αvβ5 and studies involving<br>
the use of antibodies in this strategy have consistently reported that targeting through these<br>
integrins is safe.<br>
24<br>
An example of an integrin-binding MRD is an RGD tripeptide-containing binding site, and is<br>
exemplary of the general methods described herein. Ligands having the RGD motif as a<br>
minimum recognition domain are well known, a partial list of which includes, with the<br>
corresponding integrin target in parenthesis, fibronectin (α3β1, α5β1, αvβ1, αIIbβ3, αvβ3,<br>
and α3β1) fibrinogen (αMβ2 and αIIbβ1) von Willebrand factor (αIIbβ3 and αvβ3), and<br>
vitronectin (αIIbβ3, αvβ3 and αvβ5).<br>
Examples of RGD containing targeting MRDs useful in the present disclosure have amino<br>
acid residue sequences shown below:<br>
YCRGDCT (SEQ ID. NO.: 3)<br>
PCRGDCL (SEQ ID. NO.: 4)<br>
TCRGDCY (SEQ ID. NO.: 5)<br>
LCRGDCF (SEQ ID. NO.: 6)<br>
A MRD that mimics a non-RGD-dependent binding site on an integrin receptor and having<br>
the target binding specificity of a high affinity ligand that recognizes the selected integrin is<br>
also contemplated in the present disclosure.<br>
Angiogenesis is essential to many physiological and pathological processes. Ang2 has been<br>
shown to act as a proangiogenic molecule. Administration of Ang2-selective inhibitors is<br>
sufficient to suppress both tumor angiogenesis and corneal angiogenesis. Therefore, Ang2<br>
inhibition alone or in combination with inhibition of other angiogenic factors such as VEGF<br>
may represent an effective antiangiogenic strategy for treating patients with solid tumors.<br>
It is contemplated that MRDs useful in the present disclosure include those that bind to<br>
angiogenic receptors, angiogenic factors, and/or Ang-2. Examples of angiogenic cytokine<br>
targeting MRD sequences are listed below:<br>

It should be understood that such peptides can be present in dimmers, trimers or other<br>
multimers either homologous or heterologous in nature. For example, one can dimerize<br>
identical Con-based sequences such as in 2xConFA to provide a homologous dimer, or the<br>
Con peptides can be mixed such that ConFA is combined with ConLA to create ConFA-LA<br>
heterodimer with the sequence:<br>

Phage display selections and structural studies of VEGF neutralizing peptides in complex<br>
with VEGF have been reported. These studies have revealed that peptide v114<br>
(VEPNCDIHVMWEWECFERL) (SEQ ID. NO.: 13) is VEGF specific, binds VEGF with 0.2<br>
μM affinity, and neutralizes VEGF-induced proliferation of Human Umbilical Vein<br>
Endothelial Cells (HUVEC). Since VEGF is a homodimer, the peptide occupies two identical<br>
sites at either end of the VEGF homodimer. An antibody containing an MRD that targets<br>
VEGF is contemplated in the present disclosure. Anti-VEGF antibodies can be found for<br>
example in Cancer Research 57, 4593-4599, Oct. 1997; J Biol Chem 281:10 6625, 2006,<br>
herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor-specific MRDs can be used in the present disclosure.<br>

A number of studies have characterized the efficacy of linking the vascular homing peptide to<br>
other proteins like IL-I2 or drugs to direct their delivery in live animals. As such, vascular<br>
homing MRDs are contemplated for use in the present disclosure. One example of an MRD<br>
sequence that is a vascular homing peptide is ACDCRGDCFCG (SEQ ID NO.: 15).<br>
Numerous other target binding sites are contemplated by the present disclosure, including<br>
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), CD20, tumor antigens, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4,<br>
insulin-like growth factor-I receptor, nerve growth factor (NGR), hepatocyte growth factor<br>
receptor, and tumor-associated surface antigen epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM).<br>
MRDs can be directed towards these target binding sites.<br>
Examples of MRD sequences that bind to EGFR are listed below:<br>
VDNKFNKELEKAYNEIRNLPNLNGWQMTAFIASLVDDPSQSANLLAEAKKLNDAQA<br>
PK (SEQ ID. NO.: 16).<br>
VDNKFNKEMWIAWEEIRNLPNLNGWQMTAFIASLVDDPSQSANLLAEAKKLNDAQ<br>
APK (SEQ ID. NO.: 17).<br>
An example of an MRD sequence that binds to ErbB2 is listed below:<br>
VDNKFNKEMRNAYWEIALLPNLNNQQKRAFIRSLYDDPSQSANLLAEAKKLNDAQA<br>
PK (SEQ ID. NO.: 18).<br>
The sequence of the MRD can be determined several ways. MRD sequences can be derived<br>
from natural ligands or known sequences that bind to a specific target binding site can be<br>
used. Additionally, phage display technology has emerged as a powerful method in<br>
identifying peptides which bind to target receptors. In peptide phage display libraries,<br>
random peptide sequences can be displayed by fusion with coat proteins of filamentous<br>
29<br>
phage. The methods for elucidating binding sites on polypeptides using phage display<br>
vectors has been previously described, in particular in WO 94/18221. The methods generally<br>
involve the use of a filamentous phage (phagemid) surface expression vector system for<br>
cloning and expressing polypeptides that bind to the pre-selected target site of interest.<br>
The methods of the present disclosure for preparing MRDs involve the use of phage display<br>
vectors for their particular advantage of providing a means to screen a very large population<br>
of expressed display proteins and thereby locate one or more specific clones that code for a<br>
desired target binding reactivity. Once the sequence of the MRD has been elucidated, the<br>
peptides may be prepared by any of the methods disclosed in the art.<br>
Variants and derivatives of the MRDs are included within the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
Included within variants are insertional, deletional, and substitutional variants as well as<br>
variants that include MRDs presented here with additional amino acids at the N- and/or Cterminus,<br>
including from about 0 to 50, 0 to 40, 0 to 30, 0 to 20 amino acids and the like. It is<br>
understood that a particular MRD of the present disclosure may contain one, two, or all three<br>
types of variants. Insertional and substitutional variants may contain natural amino acids,<br>
unconventional amino acids, or both.<br>
It is contemplated that catalytic and non-catalytic antibodies can be used in the present<br>
disclosure. Antibody 38C2 is an antibody-secreting hybridoma, and has been previously<br>
described in WO 97/21803. 38C2 contains an antibody combining site that catalyzes the<br>
aldol addition reaction between an aliphatic donor and an aldehyde acceptor. In a syngeneic<br>
mouse model of neuroblastoma, systemic administration of an etoposide prodrug and intratumor<br>
injection of Ab 38C2 inhibited tumor growth.<br>
Other antibodies of interest to this disclosure include A33 binding antibodies. Human A33<br>
antigen is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the Ig superfamily. The function of the human<br>
A33 antigen in normal and malignant colon tissue is not yet known, however, several<br>
properties of the A33 antigen suggest that it is a promising target for immunotherapy of colon<br>
cancer. These properties include (i) the highly restricted expression pattern of the A33<br>
antigen, (ii) the expression of large amounts of the A33 antigen on colon cancer cells, (iii) the<br>
absence of secreted or shed A33 antigen, and (iv) the fact that upon binding of antibody A33<br>
to the A33 antigen, antibody A33 is internalized and sequestered in vesicles, and (v) the<br>
targeting of antibody A33 to A33 antigen expressing colon cancer in preliminary clinical<br>
30<br>
studies. Fusion of a MRD directed toward A33 to a catalytic or non-catalytic antibody would<br>
increase the therapeutic efficacy of A33 targeting antibodies.<br>
The present disclosure also contemplates the preparation of mono-, bi-, tri-, tetra-, and pentaspecific<br>
antibodies. It is contemplated that the antibodies used in the present disclosure may<br>
be prepared by any method known in the art.<br>
In the antibody-MRD fusion molecules prepared according to the present disclosure, the<br>
MRD may be attached to an antibody through the peptide’s N-terminus or C-terminus. The<br>
MRD may be attached to the antibody at the C-terminal end of the heavy chain of the<br>
antibody, the N-terminal end of the heavy chain of the antibody, the C-terminal end of the<br>
light chain of the antibody, or the N-terminal end of the light chain of the antibody. The<br>
MRD may be attached to the antibody directly, or attached through an optional linker peptide,<br>
which can be between 2 to 20 peptides long. The linker peptide can contain a short linker<br>
peptide with the sequence GGGS (SEQ ID. NO.:1), a medium linker peptide with the<br>
sequence SSGGGGSGGGGGGSS (SEQ ID. NO.:2), or a long linker peptide with the<br>
sequence SSGGGGSGGGGGGSSRSS (SEQ ID NO.: 19). The present disclosure also<br>
provides for two or more MRDs which are linked to any terminal end of the antibody. It is<br>
also contemplated that two or more MRDs can be directly attached or attached through a<br>
linker peptide to two or more terminal ends of the antibody. The multiple MRDs can target<br>
the same target binding site, or two or more different target binding sites. Additional peptide<br>
sequences may be added to enhance the in vivo stability of the MRD.<br>
The antibody-MRD fusion molecules can be encoded by a polynucleotice comprising a<br>
nucleotide sequence. A vector can contain the polynucleotide sequence. The polynucleotide<br>
sequence can also be linked with a regulatory sequence that controls expression of the<br>
polynucleotide in a host cell. A host cell, or its progeny, can contain the polynucleotide<br>
encoding the antibody-MRD fusion molecule.<br>
The present disclosure contemplates therapeutic compositions useful for practicing the<br>
therapeutic methods described herein. Therapeutic compositions of the present disclosure<br>
contain a physiologically tolerable carrier together with at least one species of antibody<br>
comprising an MRD as described herein, dissolved or dispersed therein as an active<br>
ingredient. In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic composition is not immunogenic when<br>
administered to a human patient for therapeutic purposes.<br>
31<br>
The preparation of a pharmacological composition that contains active ingredients dissolved<br>
or dispersed therein is well understood in the art. Typically such compositions are prepared<br>
as sterile injectables either as liquid solutions or suspensions, aqueous or non-aqueous,<br>
however, solid forms suitable for solution, or suspensions, in liquid prior to use can also be<br>
prepared. The preparation can also be emulsified. Thus, an antibody – MRD containing<br>
composition can take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, capsules, sustained release<br>
formulations or powders, or other compositional forms.<br>
The active ingredient can be mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
and compatible with the active ingredient and in amounts suitable for use in the therapeutic<br>
methods described herein. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose,<br>
glycerol, ethanol or the like and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the<br>
composition can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or<br>
emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like which enhance the effectiveness of the<br>
active ingredient.<br>
The therapeutic composition of the present disclosure can include pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of the components therein. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid<br>
addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide) that are formed with<br>
inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids<br>
as acetic, tartaric, mandelic and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can also<br>
be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium,<br>
calcium or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-<br>
ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine and the like.<br>
Physiologically tolerable carriers are well known in the art. Exemplary of liquid carriers are<br>
sterile aqueous solutions that contain no materials in addition to the active ingredients and<br>
water, or contain a buffer such as sodium phosphate at physiological pH value, physiological<br>
saline or both, such as phosphate-buffered saline. Still further, aqueous carriers can contain<br>
more than one buffer salt, as well as salts such as sodium and potassium chlorides, dextrose,<br>
propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and other solutes.<br>
Liquid compositions can also contain liquid phases in addition to and to the exclusion of<br>
water.<br>
32<br>
Exemplary of such additional liquid phases are glycerin, vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil,<br>
organic esters such as ethyl oleate, and water-oil emulsions.<br>
A therapeutic composition contains an antibody comprising a MRD of the present disclosure,<br>
typically in an amount of at least 0.1 weight percent of antibody per weight of total<br>
therapeutic composition. A weight percent is a ratio by weight of antibody to total<br>
composition. Thus, for example, 0.1 weight percent is 0.1 grams of antibody-MRD per 100<br>
grams of total composition.<br>
An antibody-containing therapeutic composition typically contains about 10 microgram (ug)<br>
per milliliter (ml) to about 100 milligrams (mg) per ml of antibody as active ingredient per<br>
volume of composition, and more preferably contains about 1 mg/ml to about 10 mg/ml (i.e.,<br>
about 0.1 to 1 weight percent).<br>
A therapeutic composition in another embodiment contains a polypeptide of the present<br>
disclosure, typically in an amount of at least 0.1 weight percent of polypeptide per weight of<br>
total therapeutic composition. A weight percent is a ratio by weight of polypeptide to total<br>
composition. Thus, for example, 0.1 weight percent is 0.1 grams of polypeptide per 100<br>
grams of total composition.<br>
Preferably, an polypeptide-containing therapeutic composition typically contains about 10<br>
microgram (ug) per milliliter (ml) to about 100 milligrams (mg) per ml of polypeptide as<br>
active ingredient per volume of composition, and more preferably contains about 1 mg/ml to<br>
about 10 mg/ml (i.e., about 0.1 to 1 weight percent).<br>
In view of the benefit of using humanized or chimeric antibodies in vivo in human patients,<br>
the presently described antibody-MRD molecules are particularly well suited for in vivo use<br>
as a therapeutic reagent. The method comprises administering to the patient a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a physiologically tolerable composition containing an antibody<br>
comprising a MRD of the disclosure.<br>
The dosage ranges for the administration of the antibody comprising a MRD of the disclosure<br>
are those large enough to produce the desired effect in which the disease symptoms mediated<br>
by the target molecule are ameliorated. The dosage should not be so large as to cause adverse<br>
side effects, such as hyperviscosity syndromes, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure,<br>
and the like. Generally, the dosage will vary with the age, condition, sex and extent of the<br>
33<br>
disease in the patient and can be determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage can be<br>
adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of an antibody comprising a MRD of this disclosure is<br>
typically an amount of antibody such that when administered in a physiologically tolerable<br>
composition is sufficient to achieve a plasma concentration of from about 0.1 microgram (ug)<br>
per milliliter (ml) to about 100 ug/ml, preferably from about 1 ug/ml to about 5 ug/ml, and<br>
usually about 5 ug/ml. Stated differently, the dosage can vary from about 0.1 mg/kg to about<br>
300 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.2 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, most preferably from about<br>
0.5 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several<br>
days.<br>
The antibody comprising a MRD of the disclosure can be administered parenterally by<br>
injection or by gradual infusion over time. Although the target molecule can typically be<br>
accessed in the body by systemic administration and therefore most often treated by<br>
intravenous administration of therapeutic compositions, other tissues and delivery means are<br>
contemplated where there is likelihood that the tissue targeted contains the target molecule.<br>
Thus, antibodies comprising a MRD of the disclosure can be administered intravenously,<br>
intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracavity, transdermally, and can be<br>
delivered by peristaltic means.<br>
The therapeutic compositions containing a human monoclonal antibody or a polypeptide of<br>
this disclosure are conventionally administered intravenously, as by injection of a unit dose,<br>
for example. The term “unit dose” when used in reference to a therapeutic composition of the<br>
present disclosure refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosage for the subject,<br>
each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the<br>
desired therapeutic effect in association with the required diluent; i.e., carrier, or vehicle.<br>
The compositions are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and<br>
in a therapeutically effective amount. The quantity to be administered depends on the subject<br>
to be treated, capacity of the subject’s system to utilize the active ingredient, and degree of<br>
therapeutic effect desired. Precise amounts of active ingredient required to be administered<br>
depend on the judgment of the practitioner and are peculiar to each individual. However,<br>
suitable dosage ranges for systemic application are disclosed herein and depend on the route<br>
of administration. Suitable regimes for administration are also variable, but are typified by an<br>
34<br>
initial administration followed by repeated doses at one or more hour intervals by a<br>
subsequent injection or other administration. Alternatively, continuous intravenous infusion<br>
sufficient to maintain concentrations in the blood in the ranges specified for in vivo therapies<br>
are contemplated.<br>
The present disclosure is directed towards a full length antibody comprising a modular<br>
recognition domain (MRD). Also embodied in the present disclosure are variants and<br>
derivitaves of such antibodies comprising a MRD.<br>
In one aspect, the antibody and the MRD are operably linked through a linker peptide. In one<br>
aspect, the linker peptide is between 2 to 20 peptides long, or between 4 to 10 or about 4 to<br>
15 peptides long. In one aspect of the present disclosure, the linker peptide comprises the<br>

or the sequence SSGGGGSGGGGGGSSRSS (SEQ ID NO.: 19). Other linkers containing a<br>
core sequence GGGS as shown in SEQ ID NO:1 are included herein wherein the linker<br>
peptide is from about 4-20 amino acids.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, the MRD is operably linked to<br>
the C-terminal end of the heavy chain of the antibody. In another aspect, the MRD is<br>
operably linked to the N-terminal end of the heavy chain of the antibody. In yet another<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1. Integrin Targeting Antibody-MRD Molecules<br>
Novel antibody-MRD fusion molecules were prepared by fusion of an integrin αvβ3-targeting<br>
peptides to catalytic antibody 38C2. Fusions at the N-termini and C-termini of the light chain<br>
and the C-termini of the heavy chain were most effective. Using flow cytometry, the<br>
antibody conjugates were shown to bind efficiently to integrin αvβ3-expressing human breast<br>
cancer cells. The antibody conjugates also retained the retro-aldol activity of their parental<br>
catalytic antibody 38C2, as measured by methodol and doxorubicin prodrug activation. This<br>
demonstrates that cell targeting and catalytic antibody capability can be efficiently combined<br>
for selective chemotherapy.<br>
Example 2. Angiogenic Cytokine Targeting Antibody-MRD Molecules<br>
Angiogenic cytokine targeting antibody – MRD fusion molecules were constructed. The<br>
antibody used was 38C2, which was fused with a MRD containing the 2xCon4 peptide<br>
(AQQEECEWDPWTCEHMGSGSATGGSGSTASSGSGSATHQEECEWDPWTCEHMLE<br>
(SEQ ID. NO.: 10)). The MRD peptide was fused to either the N- or C-terminus of the light<br>
chain and the C-terminus of the heavy chain. Similar results were found with the other Ang-<br>
2 MRD peptides. Additional Ang-2 MRD peptides include:<br>

It should be understood that such peptides can be present in dimmers, trimers or other<br>
multimers either homologous or heterologous in nature. For example, one can dimerize<br>
identical Con-based sequences such as in 2xConFA to provide a homologous dimer, or the<br>
Con peptides can be mixed such that ConFA is combined with ConLA to create ConFA-LA<br>
heterodimer with the sequence:<br>

One of skill in the art, given the teachings herein, will appreciate that other such<br>
combinations will create functional Ang2 binding MRDs as described herein.<br>
Example 3. Antibody-MRD Fusions with Non-catalytic Antibodies<br>
A humanized mouse monoclonal antibody, LM609, directed towards human integrin αvβ3<br>
has been previously described. (Rader, C. et. al., 1998. Rader C, Cheresh DA, Barbas CF<br>
3rd. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Jul 21;95(15):8910-5).<br>
A human non-catalytic monoclonal Ab, JC7U was fused to an anti-Ang2 MRD containing<br>
2xCon4<br>
(AQQEECEWDPWTCEHMGSGSATGGSGSTASSGSGSATHQEECEWDPWTCEHMLE<br>
(SEQ ID. NO.:10)) at either the N- or C-terminus of the light chain. 2xCon4<br>
(AQQEECEWDPWTCEHMGSGSATGGSGSTASSGSGSATHQEECEWDPWTCEHMLE<br>
(SEQ ID. NO.: 10)) was studied as an N-terminal fusion to the Kappa chain of the antibody<br>
(2xCon4-JC7U) and as a C-terminal fusion (JC7U-2xCon4). Both fusions maintained<br>
integrin and Ang2 binding. As shown in the left panel of Figure 3, both antibody constructs<br>
(2xCon4-JC7U and JC7U-2xCon4) specifically bound to recombinant Ang2 as demonstrated<br>
by ELISA studies. Binding to Ang2, however, is significantly higher with JC7U-2xCon4,<br>
which has the 2xCon4 (SEQ ID. NO.:10) fusion at the C-terminus of the light chain of the<br>
antibody. The right panel of Figure 3 depicts the binding of Ang2-JC7U and JC7U-Ang2 to<br>
integrin αvβ3. The results show that fusion of 2xCon4 (SEQ ID. NO.: 10) to either the N- or<br>
the C- light chain terminus does not affect mAb JC7U binding to integrin αvβ3. Figure 4<br>
depicts another ELISA study using the same antibody-MRD fusion constructs.<br>
Example 4. Herceptin – MRD fusion molecules<br>
Another example of MRD fusions to a non-catalytic antibody are Herceptin – MRD fusion<br>
constructs. The Herceptin-MRD fusions are multifunctional, both small-molecule αv integrin<br>
42<br>
antagonists and the chemically programmed integrin-targeting antibody show remarkable<br>
efficacy in preventing the breast cancer metastasis by interfering with αv-mediated cell<br>
adhesion and proliferation. MRD fusions containing Herceptin-2xCon4 (which targets<br>
ErbB2 and ang2) and Herceptin-V114 (which targets ErbB2 and VEGF targeting) and<br>
Herceptin-RGD-4C-2xCon4 (which targets ErbB2, ang2, and integrin targeting) are effective.<br>
Example 5. VEGF Targeting Antibody-MRD Molecules<br>
An antibody containing an MRD that targets VEGF was constructed. A MRD which targets<br>
v114(SEQ ID. NO. 13) was fused at the N-terminus of the kappa chain of 38C2 and<br>
Herceptin using the long linker sequence (SEQ ID. NO. 2). Expression and testing of the<br>
resulting antibody-MRD fusion constructs demonstrated strong VEGF binding.<br>
Example 6. IGF-1R Targeting Antibody-MRD Molecules<br>
Fusion of an MRD which targets the IGF-1R (SFYSCLESLVNGPAEKSRGQWDGCRKK<br>
(SEQ ID. NO.: 14)) to the N-terminus of the kappa chain of 38C2 and Herceptin using the<br>
long linker sequence as a connector was studied. Expression and testing of the resulting<br>
antibody-MRD fusion constructs demonstrated strong IGF-1R binding. Additional clones<br>
showing high binding to IGR-1R were also identified after several rounds of mutagenesis and<br>
screening. The preferred sequences listed below show no significant or no binding affinity to<br>
the insulin receptor. (see Table 2).<br>

Example 7. ErbB2 Binding, Ang-2-Targeting Antibody-MRD Molecules<br>
An antibody was constructed which contains an MRD that targets Ang-2 (L17) fused to the<br>
light chain of an antibody which binds to ErbB2. Either the short linker sequence, the long<br>
linker sequence, or the 4th loop in the light chain constant region was used as a linker. Figure<br>
5 depicts the results of an ELISA using constructs containing an N-terminal fusion of Ang-2<br>
targeting MRD with the ErbB2 antibody with the short linker peptide (GGGS (SEQ ID NO.:<br>
1)) (L17-sL-Her), a C-terminal fusion of Ang-2 targeting MRD with the ErbB2 antibody with<br>
the short linker peptide (Her-sL-L17), a C-terminal fusion of Ang-2 targeting MRD with the<br>
ErbB2 antibody with the 4th loop in the light chain constant region (Her-lo-L17), or an Nterminal<br>
fusion of Ang-2 targeting MRD with the ErbB2 antibody with the long linker<br>
peptide (SSGGGGSGGGGGGSSRSS (SEQ ID NO.: 19)) (L17-lL-Her). ErbB2 was bound<br>
44<br>
with varying degrees by all of the constructs. However, Ang-2 was bound only by Her-sLL17<br>
and L17-lL-Her.<br>
Example 8. Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor Binding, Ang-2-Targeting Antibody-<br>
MRD Molecules<br>
Fusion of an MRD which targets Ang-2 (L17) was made to either the N-terminus or Cterminus<br>
of the light chain of the Met antibody, which binds to hepatocyte growth factor<br>
receptor. Either the short linker sequence or the long linker sequence were used as a<br>
connector. Figure 6 depicts the results of an ELISA using constructs containing N-terminal<br>
fusion of Ang-2 targeting MRD with the Met antibody with the short linker peptide (GGGS<br>
(SEQ ID NO.: 1)) (L17-sL-Met), N-terminal fusion of Ang-2 targeting MRD with the Met<br>
antibody with the long linker peptide (SSGGGGSGGGGGGSSRSS (SEQ ID NO.: 19)) (L17-<br>
lL-Met), and C-terminal fusion of Ang-2 targeting MRD with the Met antibody with the long<br>
linker peptide (Met-iL-L17). Expression and testing of the resulting antibody-MRD fusion<br>
constructs demonstrated strong Ang-2 binding when the long linker peptide was used. Fusion<br>
of the Ang-2 targeting MRD to the C-light chain terminus of the antibody resulted in slightly<br>
higher binding to Ang-2 then fusion of the Ang-2 targeting to the N-light chain terminus of<br>
the antibody.<br>
Example 9. ErbB2 Binding, Integrin-Targeting Antibody-MRD Molecules<br>
An antibody was constructed which contains an MRD that targets integrin αvβ3 (RGD4C)<br>
fused to the light chain of an antibody Herceptin which binds to ErbB2 (Her). Either the<br>
short linker sequence, the long linker sequence, or the 4th loop in the light chain constant<br>
region was used as a linker. Figure 7 depicts the results of an ELISA using constructs<br>
containing an N-terminal fusion of integrin αvβ3 targeting MRD with the ErbB2 antibody<br>
with the short linker peptide (GGGS (SEQ ID NO.: 1)) (RGD4C-sL-Her), a C-terminal<br>
fusion of integrin αvβ3 targeting MRD with the ErbB2 antibody with the short linker peptide<br>
(Her-sL-RGD4C), a C-terminal fusion of integrin αvβ3 targeting MRD with the ErbB2<br>
antibody with the 4th loop in the light chain constant region (Her-lo-RGD4C), or an Nterminal<br>
fusion of integrin αvβ3 targeting MRD with the ErbB2 antibody with the long linker<br>
peptide (SSGGGGSGGGGGGSSRSS (SEQ ID NO.: 19)) (RGD4C-lL-Her). ErbB2 was<br>
bound with varying degrees by all of the constructs. However, integrin αvβ3 was bound only<br>
by RGD4C-lL-Her.<br>
45<br>
Example 10. Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor Binding, Integrin-Targeting<br>
Antibody-MRD Molecules<br>
An antibody was constructed which contains an MRD that targets integrin αvβ3 (RGD4C)<br>
fused to the light chain of an antibody which binds to the hepatocyte growth factor receptor<br>
(Met). Antibody-MRD constructs containing the long linker sequence were used. Figure 8<br>
depicts the results of an ELISA using constructs containing an N-terminal fusion of integrin<br>
αvβ3 targeting MRD with the hepatocyte growth factor receptor antibody (RGD4C-lL-Met),<br>
or a C-terminal fusion of integrin αvβ3 targeting MRD with the hepatocyte growth factor<br>
receptor antibody (Met-lL-RGD4C). The RGD4C-lL-Met demonstrated strong integrin αvβ3<br>
binding.<br>
Example 11. ErbB2 Binding, Insulin-like Growth Factor-I Receptor -Targeting<br>
Antibody-MRD Molecules<br>
Antibodies were constructed which contains an MRD that targets insulin-like growth factor-I<br>
receptor (RP) fused to the light chain of an antibody which binds to ErbB2 (Her). Either the<br>
short linker peptide, the long linker peptide, or the 4th loop in the light chain constant region<br>
was used as a linker. (Carter et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 May 15;89(10):4285-9.<br>
PMID: 1350088 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]; US Patent No. 5,677,171; ATCC<br>
Deposit 10463, all incorporated by reference herein). Figure 9 depicts the results of an<br>
ELISA using constructs containing an N-terminal fusion of insulin-like growth factor-I<br>
receptor targeting MRD with the ErbB2 antibody with the short (RP-sL-Her), a C-terminal<br>
fusion of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor targeting MRD with the ErbB2 antibody and<br>
the short linker peptide (Her-sL-RP), a C-terminal fusion of insulin-like growth factor-I<br>
receptor targeting MRD with the ErbB2 antibody with the 4th loop in the light chain constant<br>
region (Her-lo-RP), an N-terminal fusion of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor targeting<br>
MRD with the ErbB2 antibody with the long linker peptide (RP-lL-Her), or a C-terminal<br>
fusion of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor targeting MRD with the ErbB2 antibody with<br>

construct containing an N-terminal fusion of VEGF targeting MRD with the ErbB2-binding<br>
antibody with the medium linker peptide (V114-mL-Her). Expression and testing of the<br>
resulting antibody-MRD fusion construct demonstrated strong VEGF and ErbB2 binding.<br>
Example 13. Integrin Targeting Antibody-MRD Molecules<br>
Fusion of an MRD which targets integrin αvβ3 (RGD) to the N-terminus of the light chain of<br>
38C2 using the medium linker peptide as a connector was studied. Figure 11 demonstrates<br>
that expression and testing of the resulting antibody-MRD fusion construct had strong<br>
integrin αvβ3 binding.<br>
Example 14. Ang-2 Targeting Antibody-MRD Molecules<br>

chain of an ErbB2 targeting antibody (Her) with a medium linker, and an Ang-2 (L17)<br>
targeting MRD was connected by a short linker to the C-terminus of the same ErbB2<br>
targeting antibody (RGD4C-mL-Her-sL-L17). Figure 13 demonstrates that the resulting<br>
antibody-MRD fusion construct bound to integrin, Ang-2, and ErbB2.<br>

an ELISA using the construct. Both integrin and ErbB2 were bound by the construct.<br>
47<br>
Example 17. ErbB2 or Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor Binding, and Integrin,<br>
Ang-2 or Insulin-like Growth Factor-I Receptor-Targeting Antibody-MRD Molecules<br>
with the Short Linker Peptide<br>
Antibody-MRD molecules were constructed which contain ErbB2 or hepatocyte growth<br>
factor receptor binding antibodies, and integrin αvβ3, Ang-2 or insulin-like growth factor-I<br>
receptor-targeting MRD regions were linked with the short linker peptide to the light chain of<br>

antibody (Her-sL-RP). ErbB2 was bound with varying degrees by the antibody-MRD<br>
constructs, with the exception of the construct containing the hepatocyte growth factor<br>
receptor-binding antibody. Antigen was bound only by the Her-sL-L17 construct.<br>
Example 18. ErbB2 or Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor Binding, and Integrin,<br>
