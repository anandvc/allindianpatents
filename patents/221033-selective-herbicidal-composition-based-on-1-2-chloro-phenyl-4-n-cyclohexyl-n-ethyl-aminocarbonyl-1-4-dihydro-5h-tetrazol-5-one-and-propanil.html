				<td>The present invention relates to selective herbicidal composition based on l-(2-chloro-phenyl)-4-(n-cyclohexyl-n-ethyl-aminocarbonyl)-1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-one and propanil.<br>
The invention relates to novel selective herbicidal, synergistic active compound combinations of the known compound l-(2-chloro-phenyl)-4-(N-cyclohexyl-N-ethyl-aminocarbonyl)-l,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-one and the active compound Propanil, which is also known, which can be used particularly successfully for the selective control of weeds in a variety of crop plants.<br>
The compound 1 -(2-chloro-phenyl)4-(N-cyclohexyl-N-ethyl-aminocarbonyl)-l ,4-di-hydro-5H-tetrazol-5-one - which can also be referred to as l-(2-chloro-phenyl)-4-(N-cyclohexyl-N-ethyl-carbamoyl)-5(4H)-tetrazolinone or as 4-(2-chloro-phenyl)-N-cyclohexyl-N-ethyl-4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-lH-tetrazol-l-carboxamide - is known as a herbicidally active substance (cf. EP 612 735 / US 5 362 704). However, the herbicidal activity of this compound on its own is not always entirely satisfactory.<br>
The compound of the common name Propanil - which may also be referred to chemically as N-(3,4-dichloro-phenyl)propanamide or as 3',4'-dichloropropion-anilide - has been known as a herbicidally active compound for a long time and is a component of commercially available products. However, once more the herbicidal activity of this compound on its own is not always entirely satisfactory.<br>
Surprisingly, biological experiments have now shown that novel active compound combinations characterized by (a) an effective level of the compound l-(2-chloro-phenyl)-4-(N-cyclohexyl-N-ethyl-aminocarbonyl)-1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-one of the formula (I)<br>
And (b) an effective level of the compound N-(3,4-dichloro-phenyl)propanamide<br>
(Propanil) of the formula (II)<br>
CD,<br>
have pronounced synergistic properties in terms of herbicidal activity and are<br>
especially advantageously useful as effective broad range combination products for<br>
the selective control of weeds in crop plants such as, for example, rice and wheat, in<br>
particular in rice.<br>
Surprisingly, the herbicidal activity of the active compound combination according<br>
to the invention is considerably higher than the sum of the activities of the individual<br>
active compounds.<br>
This means that an unforeseeable synergistic effect is present, and not merely a<br>
complementation of action. The novel active compound combinations are well<br>
tolerated by many crops, and even weeds which are otherwise difficult to control are<br>
controlled well by the novel active compound combinations. The novel active<br>
compound combinations are therefore a useful addition to the range of the selective<br>
herbicides.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be used for example<br>
in connection with the following plants:<br>
Dicotvledenous weeds of the genera: Sinapis, Lepidium, Galium, Stellaria, Matricaria,<br>
Anthemis, Galinsoga, Chenopodium, Urtica, Senecio, Amaranthus, Portulaca,<br>
Xanthium, Convolvulus, Ipomoea, Polygonum, Sesbania, Ambrosia, Cirsium, Carduus,<br>
Sonchus, Solanum, Rorippa, Rotala, Lindernia, Lamium, Veronica, Abutilon, Emex,<br>
Datura, Viola, Galeopsis, Papaver, Centaurea, Trifolium, Ranunculus and Taraxacum.<br>
Dicotyledonous crop plants of the genera: Gossypium, Glycine, Beta, Daucus,<br>
Phaseolus, Pisum, Solanum, Linum, Ipomoea, Vicia, Nicotiana, Lycopersicon, Arachis,<br>
Brassica, Lactuca, Cucumis and Cucurbita,<br>
Monocotvledonous weeds of the genera: Echinochloa, Setaria, Panicum, Digitaria,<br>
Phleum, Poa, Festuca, Eleusine, Brachiaria, Lolium, Bromus, Avena, Cyperus,<br>
Sorghum, Agropyron, Cynodon, Monochoria, Fimbristylis, Sagittaria, Eleocharis,<br>
Scirpus, Paspalum, Ischaemum, Sphenoclea, Dactyloctenium, Agrostis, Alopecurus<br>
and Apera.<br>
Monocotvledonous crop plants of the genera: Oryza, Zea, Triticum, Hordeum, Avena,<br>
Secale, Sorghum, Panicum, Saccharum, Ananas, Asparagus and Allium.<br>
However, the use of the active compound combinations according to the invention is in<br>
no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
The synergistic effect of the active compound combinations according to the invention<br>
is especially pronounced at specific concentration ratios. However, the weight ratios of<br>
the active compounds in the active compound combinations can be varied within<br>
relatively wide ranges. In general, 0.01 to 1000 parts by weight, preferably 0.05 to 500<br>
parts by weight, especially preferably 0.1 to 100 parts by weight, of active compound<br>
of the formula (II) are used per part by weight of active compound of the formula (I).<br>
The active compounds or active compound combinations can be converted into the<br>
customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions,<br>
powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspoemulsion concentrates, natural<br>
and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in<br>
polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active<br>
compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with<br>
the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam-formers.<br>
If water is used as an extender, organic solvents can, for example, also be used as<br>
auxiliary solvents. Liquid solvents which are mainly suitable are: aromatics such as<br>
xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions,<br>
mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and<br>
esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or<br>
cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl<br>
sulphoxide, and water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc,<br>
chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic<br>
minerals such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for<br>
granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite,<br>
marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and<br>
organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize<br>
cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example<br>
nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters,<br>
polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers,<br>
alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and protein hydrolysates; suitable<br>
dispersants are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
form of powders, granules or latices such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and<br>
synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Further additives can be<br>
mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo<br>
dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron,<br>
manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active<br>
compounds and optionally safener such as, for example, the compound<br>
N-(4-methylphenyl)-N'-(l -methyl- l-phenyl-ethyl)-urea (SK-223, dymvon), preferably<br>
between 0.5 and 90% of active compounds and optionally safener.<br>
In general, the active compound combinations according to the invention are applied in<br>
the form of ready mixes. However, the active compounds in the active compound<br>
combinations can also be formulated individually and mixed upon application, that is to<br>
say applied in the form of tank mixes.<br>
The novel active compound combinations as such or in the form of their formulations<br>
can also be used as mixtures with further known herbicides, finished formulations or<br>
tank mixes again being possible. Mixtures with other known active compounds such as<br>
fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, bird repellents, growth promoters,<br>
plant nutrients and soil conditioners, are also possible. Furthermore, it may be<br>
advantageous for specific purposes, in particular when using the post-emergence<br>
method, to incorporate mineral or vegetable oils tolerated by plants (for example "Oleo<br>
Dupont HE", which is commercially available) or ammonium salts such as, for<br>
example, ammonium sulphate or ammonium thiocyanate, as further additives in the<br>
formulations.<br>
The novel active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of their<br>
formulations or hi the use forms prepared therefrom by further dilution, such as readyto-<br>
use solutions, suspensions, emulsions, powders, pastes and granules. They are used<br>
in the customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, dusting or<br>
spreading.<br>
The rates of application of the active compound combinations according to the<br>
invention can be varied within a certain range; they depend, inter alia, on the weather<br>
and on the condition of the soil. In general, the rates of application are between 0.05<br>
and 5 kg per ha, preferably between 0.05 and 2 kg per ha, in particular between 0.1 and<br>
1.0 kg per ha.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be applied before<br>
and after the emergence of the plants, i.e. by the pre-emergence and post-emergence<br>
method.<br>
The good herbicidal activity of the novel active compound combinations is evident<br>
from the examples below. While the individual active compounds show weaknesses in<br>
their herbicidal activity, the combinations all exhibit very efficient control of weeds,<br>
and this control exceeds a simple sum of the activities.<br>
In herbicides, a synergistic effect is always present when the herbicidal activity of the<br>
active compound combination exceeds that of the active compounds applied<br>
individually.<br>
The expected activity for a given combination of two herbicides can be calculated as<br>
follows (cf. COLBY, S. R.; "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of<br>
herbicide combinations", Weeds 15, pages 20-22,1967):<br>
If X = % damage by herbicide A (active compound of the formula I) at the<br>
rate of application of p kg/ha<br>
and Y = % damage by herbicide B (active compound of the formula II) at the<br>
rate of application of q kg/ha<br>
andE = the expected damage caused by herbicides A and B at a rate of<br>
application of p and q kg/ha,<br>
then E =X + Y-(X*Y/100).<br>
If the actual damage exceeds the calculated value, the combination is super-additive<br>
with regard to its activity, i.e. it shows a synergistic effect.<br>
The examples below reveal that the herbicidal activity of the active compound<br>
combinations according to the invention found exceeds the calculated value, i.e. that<br>
the novel active compound combinations have a synergistic action.<br>
Use examples;<br>
To prepare the active compound preparations required for the tests, suitable amounts<br>
of a 50% strength water-dispersible powder formulation (50 WP) of the active<br>
ingredient of the above formula (I) and a commercially available emulsion<br>
concentrate having an active ingredient content of 360 g/1 (360 EC) of the active<br>
compound of the above formula (II) (Propanil) are weighed out and diluted with<br>
water to the desired concentration in question; by mixing, various combinations of<br>
the two active ingredient were prepared.<br>
The abbreviations used below have the following meanings:<br>
a.i. = active ingredient;<br>
found = damage or activity found (in per cent);<br>
calc. = damage or activity calculated using the COLBY formula above (in per<br>
cent).<br>
The tests, which were carried out in different geographical regions, were conducted<br>
as described below, the observed spread in the results from different countries (the<br>
Philippines, Italy, Japan) being due to the very different application conditions in the<br>
various regions.<br>
Example A; Test in transplanted rice (Philippines)<br>
To prepare a spray preparation, the abovementioned active ingredient preparations<br>
are mixed with water. The concentration is adjusted so that the application rate<br>
corresponds to 4501 of water/ha.<br>
Rice seedlings (1-2 leaf stage) are transplanted into test plots (2.5 m x 2.5 m) in rice<br>
paddies (soil saturated with water). 7 days after transplantation, the spray preparation<br>
is applied to the test areas (using a hand-operated sprayer). 1 day after the treatment,<br>
the soil is flooded to a water depth of 5 cm; the standing water levels are kept<br>
constant.<br>
4 weeks after the active compound application, the degree of damage to the rice<br>
plants and the herbicidal effect on the emerged weeds Echinochloa cms galli and<br>
Monochoria vaginalis is scored visually in per cent in comparison to an untreated<br>
control.<br>
The figures denote<br>
0% = no action/damage (like untreated control)<br>
100% = total destruction<br>
The results are shown in Table A below.<br>
Example B; Tests in sown rice (Philippines)<br>
To prepare a spray preparation, the abovementioned active ingredient preparations<br>

corresponds to 4501 of water/ha.<br>
Rice seeds are sown in test plots (2.5 m x 2.5 m) in rice paddies (soil saturated with<br>
water). 7 days after sowing, the spray preparation is applied to the test areas (using a<br>
hand-operated sprayer). One day after the treatment, the soil is flooded to a water<br>
depth of 5 cm; the standing water levels are kept constant.<br>
4 weeks after the active ingredient application, the degree of damage to the rice<br>
plants and the herbicidal effect on the emerged weeds Echinochloa crus galli,<br>
Monochoria vaginalis and Sphenoclea zeylanica is scored visually in per cent in<br>
comparison to an untreated control.<br>

Rice seeds are sown in test plots (2 m x 5 m) in rice paddies (moist soil). 2 weeks<br>
after sowing, the spray preparation is applied to the test areas (using a hand-operated<br>
sprayer). 3 days after the treatment, the soil is flooded to a water depth of 5 cm; the<br>
standing water levels are kept constant.<br>
4 weeks after the active ingredient application, the degree of damage to the rice<br>
plants and the herbicidal effect on the emerged weeds Echinochloa crus galli,<br>

To prepare a suitable spray preparation, the abovementioned active ingredient<br>
preparations are diluted to the desired concentration by mixing with water.<br>
Vessels for plant cultivation (size: 20 cm x 20 cm x 9 cm; surface area: 1/2000 Ar)<br>
are filled with soil from a rice paddy. Rice seeds and seeds of Echinochloa crus galli<br>
are sown into the soil, which is kept moist. At the 1.5-2 leaf stage of rice and<br>
Echinochloa crus galli, the dilute active ingredient preparation is applied as a spray<br>
(foliar treatment). The active ingredient concentration of the preparation is not<br>
important; only the active ingredient application rate per unit area matters.<br>
One day after the treatment, the test vessels are flooded to a water depth of 3 cm. The<br>
experiments are subsequently kept flooded (water depth 3 cm).<br>
3 weeks after the active ingredient application, the degree of damage to the plants is<br>
