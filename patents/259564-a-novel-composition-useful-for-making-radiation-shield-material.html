				<td>Field of the invention:<br>
This invention relates to a novel composition useful for the preparation of radiation shields. The present invention further relates to a process of production of the said composition. Radiation shield material comprising of dried powdered ceramic composition, polymer and additives.<br>
The present invention also relates to a composition useful for radiation shielding application for industrial and medical diagnostic and CT scanner rooms, X-ray facilities.<br>
Background and prior art of the invention;<br>
Shielding materials are used to provide shielding against radiation to protect sites where radiation is not required. In the field of medicines radiation is used at a required level and at a particular region beyond that it may be harmful. Lead or lead alloys are presently used for protection against radiation. They are melted and shaped to desired dimensions using moulds. Spheres of lead having diameter of a few millimeters are also used to fill the case of desired dimensions. These methods need lots of energy and require fabrication of mould /case and tooling. For minor modifications or adjustments in the shape of shielding component these fabrication methods are not adequate. Production and application of lead based components are facing problems due to their high density that is 11.34 g/cm3 and the toxic nature. The other metals those are capable of attenuation of X-ray include copper, aluminum, titanium, iron/steel, chromium, magnesium and barium etc. as can be referred to scientific paper by Quan Lin et al in journal "Polymer ", volume number 41, year 2000, page 8305 to 8309. P. Soo and L. M. Milian reported in Journal of Material Science Letters, volume number 20, year 2001, page 1345 to 1348 that concrete is also often used as attenuation material. Polymers containing heavy metals in polymeric chains as reported in Japanese patents Kokai Tokkyo Koho, 157092, (1985) and Kokai Tokkyo Koho, 98765, (1986)] or as reported in European Patent application number 19121 wherein the metal oxides dispersed polymer display radio-pack properties. The lead / rare-earths containing glasses made from oxides of silicon/aluminum/zinc etc. also exhibit X-ray attenuation properties as reported by Ching -hwa lee and Chi - Shiung in Environment Science and Technology in the year 2000, volume 36, page 69-75.<br><br>
The processes for making X-ray attenuation materials based on lead metal, lead bearing glasses or lead compound dispersed polymer composites suffer due to toxicity of lead. Further, the lead bearing tiles/sheets/bricks are significantly heavy in weight. The use of concrete for X-ray attenuation suffers on account of a gradual decrease in its mechanical strength with the period of exposure.<br>
Lead-free X-ray radiation absorbing composites based on environment friendly powder mixtures of 1) Oxides and fluorides of rare earth metals of a group of cerium and dysprosium family, ii) Chemical compounds of some metals such as Sn, Zn, W, etc.), and iii) the various types of binders (special rubbers, resins, cement composites) have been developed. However, having high advantages in ecological safety, life time, and wider energy range of shielding the new materials apart form being costly, exhibited a high ability to generate secondary fluorescent flov s of radiation. This disadvantage is eliminated by application of lead-free multi-layer shield structure consisting of main X-ray radiation absorbing layer efficiently attenuating the primary radiation flow and auxiliary multi-layer shield efficiently attenuating secondary fluorescent flows in a cascade manner. The positive effect is attained by optimization the composition and uniform distribution of X-ray absorbing components in the main protective layer and proper selection structure and thickness of the auxiliary shield. The technique and principal process for multilayer shields, for instance, to protect doors, window openings, walls, ceilings of X-ray rooms with standard disposition to a radiation source using lead-free rubbers, special paint coatings and non-organic tiles in combination with conventional materials have been developed and tested. Very recently lead containing optical resin has also been reported to exhibit good absorption for X-rays.<br>
In the area of shielding materials, on the account of toxic characteristics of lead the alternative materials for shielding are based on Rare Earths. However the cost of rare earths prohibits their wide spread use.<br>
Hitoshi Tomita et al claimed in a US patent application number 20040029998 AI a non lead inorganic powders such as Tungsten or Barium sulfate etc of specific gravity above 4 at 70 to 98 % by weight dispersed in a thermoplastic material by melt blending offers radiation shielding properties. This material can be easily cut by a scissor as well. United States Patent 5,550,383 by Haskell claimed a remoldable thermoplastic radiation shield for use during radiation therapy for protecting healthy tissue during radiotherapy of<br><br>
malignant tissue. The shielding device is composed of nontoxic, high atomic weight metal particles that are dispersed in a thermoplastic matrix material that is substantially rigid at temperatures encountered during radiotherapy, yet becomes readily moldable at temperatures that are within a comfortable range for a patient so as to enable in situ molding of the device. Similarly in US Patent No. 5,190,990 Eichmiller claims nontoxic metal particles dispersed in thermosetting material to give a shielding material. The above-mentioned literature review clearly shows that a non-toxic, lightweight, environment friendly, easily formable economical alternative radiation shield material is not available and hence needed in various applications as indicated earlier. More precisely no reference is available in the literature related to ceramic composition derived from waste material and dispersed in polymer to offer radiation shielding. The present invention provides a novel composition for making radiation-shield material to obviate the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>

The main object of this invention is to provide a novel composition useful as radiation<br>
