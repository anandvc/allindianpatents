The preparation involves the condensation of 3-hydroxymethyl-7-amino cephalosporinc acid with (fur-2-yl)-2-methoxyimino acetic acid to produce (6R,7R)-7-[Z-2-(fur-2-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-hydroxymethylceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid. Carbamoylation of resulting acid with isocyanate of formula RNCO wherein R is a labile substituent to get (6R,7R)-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-7-[Z-2-(fur-2-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid (cefuroxime), followed by converting the cefuroxime into its sodium salt using mixture of water soluble sodium salt.<br>
