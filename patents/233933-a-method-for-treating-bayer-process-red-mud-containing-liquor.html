				<td>The present invention is directed to the clarification of red mud-containing liquors<br>
generated in the Bayer process for the recovery of alumina from bauxite ore with a<br>
combination of high molecular weight emulsion polymer and lower molecular weight<br>
emulsion polymers. The invention is also a method for the same purp6se utilizing a<br>
methyl acrylate emulsion homopolymer.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The Process<br>
In the Bayer process for the production of alumina, bauxite ore is pulverized,<br>
slurried in water, and then digested with caustic at elevated temperatures and pressures.<br>
The caustic solution dissolves oxides of aluminum, forming an aqueous sodium<br>
aluminate solution. The caustic-insoluble constituents of bauxite ore (referred to as "red<br>
mud") are then separated from the aqueous phase containing the dissolved sodium<br>
aluminate. Solid alumina trihydrate is precipitated out of the solution and collected as<br>
product.<br>
In more detail, the pulverized bauxite ore is fed to a slurry mixer where a water<br>
slurry is prepared. The slurry makeup water is typically spent liquor (described below)<br>
and added caustic. This bauxite ore slurry is then diluted and passed through a digester or<br>
a series of digesters where, under high pressure and temperature, about 98% of the total<br>
available alumina is released from the ore as caustic-soluble sodium aluminate. After<br>
digestion, the slurry passes through several flash tanks wherein the pressure of the<br>
digested slurry is reduced from several atmospheres to one atmosphere and the<br>
temperature of the slurry is reduced from about 200째 C. to about 105째 C.<br>
The aluminate liquor leaving the flashing operation contains from about 1 to<br>
about 20 weight percent solids, which solids consist of the insoluble residue that remains<br>
after, or is precipitated during, digestion. The coarser solid particles may be removed<br>
from the aluminate liquor with "sand trap" cyclones. The finer solid particles are<br>
generally separated from the liquor first by settling and then by filtration, if necessary.<br>
The slurry of aluminate liquor leaving the flash tanks is diluted by a stream of recycled<br>
washer overflow liquor. Any Bayer process slurry taken from the digesters through any<br>
subsequent dilution of the slurry, including the flash tanks, but before the primary settler,<br>
is referred hereinafter as the primary settler feed.<br>
Normally, the primary settler feed is thereafter fed to the center well of the<br>
primary settler, where it is treated with a flocculant. As the mud settles, clarified sodium<br>
aluminate solution, referred to as "green" or "pregnant" liquor, overflows a weir at the top<br>
of the primary settler and is collected. This overflow from the primary settling tank is<br>
passed to the subsequent process steps.<br>
The clarity of the primary settler overflow is crucial to the efficient processing of<br>
alumina trihydrate. If the aluminate liquor overflowing the settler contains an<br>
unacceptable concentration of suspended solids (at times from about 10 to about 500 mg<br>
of suspended solids per liter), it must be further clarified by filtration to give a filtrate<br>
with no more than about 10 mg suspended solids per liter of liquor. The treatment of the<br>
liquor collected after the primary settlement to remove any residual suspended solids<br>
before alumina trihydrate is recovered is referred to as a secondary clarification stage.<br>
The clarified sodium aluminate liquor is seeded with alumina trihydrate crystals to<br>
induce precipitation of alumina in the form of alumina trihydrate, A1(OH)3. The alumina<br>
trihydrate particles or crystals are then separated from the concentrated caustic liquor, and<br>
the remaining liquid phase, the spent liquor, is returned to the initial digestion step and<br>
employed as a digestant after reconstitution with caustic.<br>
The settled solids of the primary settler are withdrawn from the bottom of the<br>
settler ("underflow") and passed through a countercurrent washing circuit for recovery of<br>
sodium aluminate and soda. Overflow water from this washing circuit is recycled as<br>
primary settler feed and dilutes the slurry as it leaves the flash tanks.<br>
The partial separation of the red mud solids from the pregnant liquor in the<br>
primary settler is expedited by the use of a flocculant. This initial clarification of the<br>
pregnant liquor is referred to as the primary settler stage. Flocculating agents, such as<br>
inverse emulsion liquid polymers, dry polymers and polysaccharides including starch, are<br>
commonly used to improve the separation of insolubles by increasing the rate at which<br>
the solids settle, by reducing the amount of residual solids suspended in the liquor, and by<br>
decreasing the amount of liquor in the settled solids phase. Flocculation performance is<br>
highly important in the primary settling stages. Red muds are comprised chiefly of iron<br>
oxides (at least about 50 weight percent of the red mud solids), together with silicon<br>
oxides, calcium oxides, sodium alumino-silicates, titanium oxides and other material, and<br>
commonly represent from about 5 to about 50 weight percent of the materials of the<br>
bauxite ore. Generally these muds are comprised of very fine particles, which hinder the<br>
desired rapid and clean separation of red mud particles from the solubilized alumina<br>
liquor. If the rate of separation is too slow, output is materially diminished and overall<br>
process efficiency is impaired. If the separation is not clean, the resultant solubilized<br>
aluminate liquor will require a more extensive treatment to remove residual solids, and/or<br>
the alumina trihydrate recovered will contain levels of impurities that are undesirably<br>
high for many end-uses.<br>
Conventional Treatments''<br>
The polysaccharides, starch and dextran were used early in red mud flocculation.<br>
For instance, U.S. Patent No. 3,085,853, April 16, 1963, Lesinski et al., uses native<br>
dextrans to increase the rate of sedimentation of finely divided solids in aqueous<br>
suspensions and thereby facilitate the separation of such solids. Later synthetic<br>
polymeric flocculants became more commonly employed for the Bayer process. Other<br>
types of polymers found to have utility include polymers formed from polymerization of<br>
vinyl amine or vinyl formamide as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,346,628; phosphonic<br>
acid polymers as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,534,235; and polymers containing<br>
hydroxamic acid groups in U.S. Patent No. 4,767,540.<br>
Another approach to Bayer process treatments is the combination of<br>
polysaccharides with synthetic polymeric flocculants. For example, U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,397,953, August 20, 1968, Galvin et al., uses a blend of starch and polyacrylic acid on<br>
red mud suspensions, noting that polyacrylic acid alone is not suitable as a flocculating<br>
agent. The polyacrylic acids exemplified generally have molecular weights of less than<br>
300,000. The flocculation and sedimentation activity of the blend is exemplified in the<br>
primary settler stage of a bauxite process, contains at least about 80 weight percent of the<br>
acrylic acid mer unit, and has a molecular weight in excess of 50,000, and preferably in<br>
excess of 100,000. Other starch/polymer combinations are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
3,397,953; 3,541,009; 3,681,012; and 5,008,089.<br>
Emulsions of polymers formed from lower primary alkyl acrylate monomers for<br>
refining alumina are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,755,531. Moreover, Unexamined<br>
Japanese Patent No. 4986 - 1979 discloses a process for producing an ultra high<br>
molecular weight acrylic acid copolymer salt. However, the polymers described herein<br>
are copolymers of significantly higher MW than either of these two references, and result<br>
in surprisingly greater activity than those lower molecular weight polymers previously<br>
disclosed by the Japanese references.<br>
A process for improving the flocculation of suspended red mud solids in a Bayer<br>
process liquor comprises a water-continuous dispersion containing a polymer dispersed in<br>
the water of the continuous phase of said dispersion, the polymer comprised of at least 50<br>
mole percent of mer units having pendant groups that hydrolyze to pendant carboxylic<br>
acid groups is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,286,391. However, this reference suggests<br>
that because the in-situ hydrolysis occurs over time and results in continuous activation,<br>
that the optimal polymer would be one containing 100 mole percent of mer units having<br>
pendant hydrolyzable groups. By contrast, this invention discloses that there is an<br>
optimal degree of hydrolysis (not 100%), that occurs in the range of 70 -80%.<br>
Difficulties Associated with Conventional Treatments<br>
Oil continuous liquid flocculants (hereafter termed o/c flocculants), and powder<br>
flocculants (together represent 'synthetic flocculants'). Synthetic flocculants have been<br>
used to flocculate suspended red mud, as described above. Polysaccharides including<br>
starches have also been used to flocculate suspended red mud, as described above. Such<br>
flocculating agents are added in the primary settler, the mud washing circuit, mud<br>
dewatering systems (including centrifuges, vacuum filters, etc.) and to enhance mud<br>
stacking in mud disposal sites .<br>
Prior to the successful introduction of synthetic high molecular weight polymers,<br>
polysaccharides including starch were used to settle red mud. Today, starch is still used<br>
alone in some refineries but starch is more commonly added in conjunction with high<br>
molecular weight synthetic flocculants. In these cases starch improves supernatant liquor<br>
clarity, improves the interface between the settled mud and the cleaner supernatant liquor,<br>
and reportedly helps to maintain mud bed stability of the settled mud in settlers and<br>
washers.<br>
Red mud underflow is removed from the primary mud settler to a wash stage via<br>
an underflow pumping mechanism. Similar mud pumping is used in the mud washers,<br>
etc. In the wash stage, sodium aluminate and soda are recovered from this red mud.<br>
However, starch occasionally produces a red mud which has poor rheology, and, hence,<br>
has undesirable underflow characteristics. When starch is used, a mud is sometimes<br>
produced which has poor rheology and poor underflow characteristics. If not diluted, the<br>
underflow can occasionally become difficult to pump.<br>
The water in oil (inverse) emulsion flocculants must be inverted prior to<br>
application so that the flocculant is contained in the water phase of the emulsion. If the<br>
inverse emulsion flocculants are added neat (non-inverted), the polymer flocculants will<br>
not disperse in the Bayer liquor, and poor activity will be encountered. In light of the<br>
above problems with the inverse emulsions, it would be an advance in the art of Bayer<br>
process treatments to eliminate the need for the inverse emulsions.<br>
Moreover, oil continuous liquid flocculant of sodium or ammonium acrylate are<br>
largely used in bauxite industry for settling the red mud. Since the oil continuous liquid<br>
flocculants contain about 25-30% of paraffinic oils as the carrier, the liquor from which<br>
alumina separates out becomes enriched with an ever increasing amount of organic<br>
material. Since organics in the liquor inhibit the precipitation of alumina, a flocculant<br>
containing the least amount of the organic material would be most desirable.<br>
While dry polymers reduce the level of organics added to the Bayer liquor, they<br>
also are not without concerns. The dry polymers are hygroscopic and must therefore be<br>
handled, stored and prepared without exposing the dry polymer to moisture or humid air.<br>
Once a dry polymer has been exposed to moisture or humidity, severe system plugging<br>
and loss of activity will result. System plugging and loss of activity results in major costs<br>
to the user in terms of the cost of the non-usable dry polymer, disposal of the<br>
contaminated dry polymer, lost alumina production, increased maintenance costs, etc.<br>
Dry polymer storage, solution make-up and feeding equipment must be very elaborate to<br>
prevent these problems. Dry polymers are also difficult to dissolve in water, with 90%+<br>
polymer hydration requiring mixing and aging time of the solution to be as high as 2<br>
hours. This slow dissolution requires thaMhe user have large inventories of solutions in 2<br>
separate tanks. The first tank is the high mixing energy tank where dissolution occurs.<br>
The second tank is the working solution tank from which the polymer solution is drawn<br>
and fed into the process.<br>
Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provider new flocculating agent which<br>
would expedite the separation of the red mud solids from the pregnant liquor, improve<br>
the clarity of liquor overflow, be easy to handle and feed into the process, decrease<br>
flocculant usage, and eliminate starch.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to the clarification of red mud-containing liquors<br>
generated in the Bayer process for the recovery of alumina from bauxite ore with a<br>
combination of high molecular weight emulsion polymer and lower molecular weight<br>
emulsion polymers. The invention is also a method for the same purpose utilizing a<br>
methyl acrylate emulsion homopolymer.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
Bayer process liquors generally are aqueous media containing dissolved sodium<br>
aluminate and red mud solids at various concentrations. Such liquors include the primary<br>
settler slurry or feed, which contains high concentration levels of both red mud and<br>
dissolved sodium aluminate, the red mud washing slurries, which have high red mud<br>
concentrations but lesser concentrations of sodium aluminate and total alkalinity, and the<br>
secondary clarification liquors, which are rich in dissolved sodium aluminate but contain<br>
much less red mud than the other types of liquors. Additional liquors include red mud<br>
slurries which are dewatered in centrifuges or on vacuum drum or disc filters, as well as<br>
red mud slurries which are flocculated to improve their mud stacking properties or to<br>
improve the tendency to release water from the mud slurry. As discussed above, the<br>
separation of the red mud from the sodium aluminate and its aqueous phase is continued<br>
from the primary settlement stage until concentrated red mud is eliminated from the<br>
process circuit, and from the primary settlement stage until the clarified liquor is<br>
subjected to the alumina trihydrate crystallization.<br>
The flocculation of red mud, which routinely precedes or follows either settling or<br>
filtration, is most difficult in the primary settlement stage because of the high<br>
concentration of fine particles, and the high concentration of total alkalinity.<br>
Improvement of the flocculation effectiveness in the primary settlement stage is<br>
extremely important to the entire Bayer process. By reducing the level of suspended<br>
solids that remain in the supernatant above the floc formed in the primary settler liquor,<br>
the solids to be removed during secondary clarification stages are reduced. Also, residual<br>
flocculant (both synthetic and natural red mud flocculants) in the supernatant liquor have<br>
been shown to severely reduce filtration flux in the secondary clarification stage.<br>
In the Bayer process, the bauxite ore is digested under highly alkaline conditions,<br>
and the typical primary settler liquors are routinely highly alkaline, containing sodium<br>
or calcium hydroxide, sodium aluminate, and commonly sodium carbonate. The total<br>
alkalinity of the primary settler feed, that is the liquor charged to the primary settlement<br>
stage, is typically from about 100 to 300 grams per liter of settler feed, as sodium<br>
carbonate. The solids contents of typical primary settler feeds vary from about 25 to<br>
about 85 grams per liter of settler feed. .<br>
By primary settler feed is meant herein the Bayer process digested slurry as<br>
charged to the flash tanks or other vessels emptying into the primary settler. Such feed<br>
may be an admixture of the digested slurry plus dilution liquor, and the dilution liquor is<br>
routinely the counter current technique wash water from the red mud washing stages<br>
discussed above. The primary settler feed differs from the liquors or slurries subjected to<br>
clarification and/or separation in the secondary clarification stage or the red mud washing<br>
stages by composition as to the solids content, dissolved sodium aluminate content, and<br>
total alkalinity. The primary settler feed also differs from the liquors or slurries in that no<br>
insoluble fraction thereof has received an earlier flocculation treatment. An improved<br>
clarification of Bayer process primary settler liquors is the principle object of the present<br>
invention. Nonetheless in broad embodiment the present invention in directed to the<br>
clarification and settling of red mud-containing liquors in any aspect of mineral<br>
processing wherein such red mud is found. For example, the invention may be used in<br>
the counter-current wash liquors, primary settler liquors of the Bayer process, as well as<br>
addition to red mud which is dewatered in centrifuges or by vacuum filtration (drum<br>
filters, and disc filters among others) and red mud which is flocculated after the last mud<br>
washing stage to improve the mud stacking properties in the mud disposal area, or in<br>
addition to red mud which must be made useful for other purposes.<br>
Upon flocculation of a primary settler feed, using the polymers of the invention, a<br>
liquor/mud interface will form where upon settling, the supernatant liquor is low in<br>
suspended solids (generally ranging from about 10 to about 500 mg/1) and overlies a mud<br>
layer. The lower mud layer contains the flocculated material, and as discussed above is<br>
comprised of both red mud solids (generally ranging from about 10 to about 70% mud<br>
solids by weight) and some amount of pregnant liquor. The overlying supernatant is the<br>
liquor that is separated for secondary clarification, again as discussed above. This<br>
supernatant is "mud-clear" and the interface between it and the mud layer is clearly seen<br>
in some cases, but the supernatant is not entirely free of suspended solids, appearing<br>
instead as a hazy, but transparent, liquid. The present invention diminishes the amount of<br>
suspended solids in such supernatant, and hence decreases the extent of secondary<br>
clarification required to obtain a given purity of sodium aluminate solution. The present<br>
invention may also reduce or eliminate the need for starch by improved supernatant<br>
liquor clarity and improved red mud stability.<br>
The digested slurry is typically discharged from the flash tanks at elevated<br>
temperatures. The primary settler feed is generally not further cooled before charging to<br>
the primary settlement stage other than the cooling which may occur when a digested<br>
slurry is optionally admixed with the liquor from the first red mud wash stage to form a<br>
primary settler feed. According to the invention, the flocculation of the primary settler<br>
feed is conducted at atmospheric pressures and at elevated temperatures of from about 80째<br>
or 90째C. to about 103째 or 115째C.<br>
One aspect of the invention is a method for treating Bayer process red mud-<br>
containing liquor comprising the steps of:<br>
a) adding to said red mud-containing liquor an effective clarifying amount of a<br>
combination of poly(methyl acrylate/acrylic acid) emulsion copolymers,<br>
wherein said combination comprises i) a high molecular weight copolymer<br>
formed from monomers having a mole ratio of methyl acrylate to acrylic acid<br>
of from about 85:15 to about 99.9:0.1 and wherein said copolymer has an<br>
intrinsic viscosity in 2N NaNO3 at 30째 C of at least 18 dL/g. and ii. a lower<br>
molecular weight copolymer formed from monomers having a mole ratio of<br>
methyl acrylate to acrylic acid of from about 85:15 to about 99.9:0.1 and<br>
wherein said copolymer has an intrinsic viscosity in 2N NaNO3 at 30 째C of<br>
from about 5 to about 18 dL/g;<br>
b) forming a red mud phase and a clarified liquor phase; and<br>
c) recovering said clarified liquor phase.<br>
These polymers may be added at different times to different parts of the Bayer<br>
processing unit, though it is also possible to blend them together prior to addition. If<br>
added sequentially, the low molecular weight copolymer should be added before the high<br>
molecular weight copolymer.<br>
The invention is also a method for treating Bayer process red mud-containing<br>
liquor comprising the steps of:<br>
a) adding to said red-mud containing liquor an effective clarifying amount of a<br>
poly(methyl acrylate) emulsion homopolymer wherein said homopolymer has an intrinsic<br>
viscosity in 2N NaNO3at 30째C of at least 15 dL/g;<br>
b) forming a red mud phase and a clarified liquor phase; and<br>
:짝 c) recovering said clarified liquor phase.<br>
The following information applies to any aspect of this invention. The high and<br>
lower molecular weight copolymers may be from about 60 to about 90 percent<br>
hydrolyzed in said red mud-containing liquor. Moreover the copolymers may be from<br>
about 75 to about 80 percent hydrolyzed in said red mud-containing liquor. The<br>
copolymers may have a mole ratio of methyl acrylate to acrylic acid of from about 90:10<br>
to about 99.5:0.5. The copolymer may have a mole ratio of methyl acrylate to acrylic<br>
acid of 97.5:2.5. The copolymer may have an intrinsic viscosity in 2N NaNO3 at 30째C of<br>
from about 20 to about 40 dL/g. The ratio of low to high molecular weight copolymers<br>
when treated sequentially or as a blend is from about 50:50 to about 99:1 low molecular<br>
weight copolymer to high molecular weight copolymer. One useful blend is a 90:10<br>
ratio. For either the homo polymer or the copolymer, the effective dosage will depend<br>
upon the particular system to be treated, but generally may fall in the range of from about<br>
5 0.1 to about 10 ppm of each polymer.<br>
The total alkalinity of the red mud containing liquor may be from about 10 to<br>
about 300 grams per liter expressed as sodium carbonate. The solids content of the red<br>
mud containing liquor may be from about 10 grams per liter to about 350 grams per liter.<br>
The treatment of the red mud containing liquor may be conducted at atmospheric or<br>
I elevated pressures and at a temperature of from about 5째 C to about<br>
250째 C. Moreover, the treatment of the red mud containing liquor may be conducted at<br>
atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of from about 30째 C to about 115째 C.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, polymers formed from<br>
acrylic acid and acrylic acid ester monomers ranging in composition from essentially<br>
99% mer units of the acrylic acid ester monomer down to less than 50% mer units of<br>
acrylic acid ester monomer are used. Preferably, the molecular weights range from about<br>
4 million to about 10 million. One feature of the polymers of the invention is the high<br>
molecular weights which produce high reduced specific viscosity (RSV) in the range of<br>
from 30 up to 60 dl/g.<br>
The polymers of the invention are water continuous. In more detail, the polymers<br>
are dispersed in water (true emulsions), where water is the continuous phase. This<br>
directly contrasts what is found in inverse latex polymers where the polymer is dispersed<br>
in an oil phase and an inversion step is required before the polymers can be used as<br>
flocculants. According to the invention, the polymers may be added either neat or in<br>
solution (through hydrolysis) to the primary liquor feed of a Bayer process. Normally, oil<br>
continuous liquid synthetic flocculant emulsions are first inverted to about 0.5 to 3% in<br>
process or raw water and again diluted to about 0.01 to 0.4% as product in process or raw<br>
&gt; water before being introduced to the process (since a product generally range from 15 to<br>
50% active polymer). Upon addition of the treatment polymer to the red mud-containing<br>
liquor, two phases form, a red mud phase and a clarified liquor phase. The treatment<br>
polymer mainly goes into the red mud phase.<br>
One advantage of the neat addition of the polymers of the invention is improved<br>
1 settler overflow clarity. One unique feature of the invention is that when added neat or as<br>
a diluted emulsion, the water continuous polymers of the invention hydrolyze in situ in<br>
the Bayer process liquor itself. In more detail, the polymers formed from AA and acrylic<br>
acid esters are not themselves red mud flocculants, as they are entirely ineffective in<br>
flocculating red mud. However, when placed in the Bayer process liquor in the presence<br>
of red mud, the high alkalinity and the high temperatures hydrolyze the ester to form<br>
polymer acrylic acid ultimately. Furthermore, the composition of the invention does not<br>
hydrolyze instantly, but rather over time. Therefore, the poly AA/acrylic acid ester<br>
essentially is being activated continuously over time, ranging from the initial composition<br>
which is 100% ester for the ester portion down to eventually 100% active polyacrylic<br>
acid.<br>
The present invention produces its surprising and unexpected results through the<br>
formation of micro-floccules of the polymer and the suspended solids; which produce a<br>
red mud which is more amenable to the bulk flocculation in the primary settler. The<br>
micro-floccules form as the polymers hydrolyze and become active toward the red mud.<br>
For this reason, the polymers are injected upstream from the primary settler, such as in<br>
one of the flash tanks or between the flash tanks and the primary settler feed well where<br>
there is sufficient temperature and residence time to allow the hydrolysis of the polymer.<br>
It should be noted that hydrolysis is not instantaneous. The hydrolysis will progress as<br>
the polymer and mud make their way from the flash tanks down the various piping and<br>
into the primary settler.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the invention is practiced as<br>
follows. The polymer is injected into the primary settler feed, preferably into one of the<br>
lines upstream from the primary settler or, preferably, in a flash tank where there is<br>
sufficient temperature. Also, the polymer can be added in the digesters themselves.<br>
The red mud containing liquor may be a primary settler feed, a mud washer feed,<br>
or a centrifuge feed. The feed may be from a digester blow-off, diluted digester blow-off,<br>
primary settler underflow, washer underflow, or a combination of settler and washer<br>
underflows with other process streams including but not limited to washer overflows,<br>
lake return water or raw water. The polymers described herein, when utilized to treat<br>
Bayer process red-mud containing liquor, result in an increase in both clarity and settling<br>
rate.<br>
The polymers may also be utilized to treat the last stage washer underflow at the<br>
mud disposal site to improve mud stacking, or more rapid release of liquor from the mud.<br>
Moreover, the polymers may also be utilized for the treatment of mud filters, including<br>
but not limited to drum and vacuum filters.<br>
It is envisaged that these polymers will also have utility in the following areas of<br>
the Bayer process: classification, flocculation, precipitation and dewatering for either<br>
alumina trihydrate or solid phase oxalate.<br>
The following examples are presented to describe preferred embodiments and<br>
utilities of the invention and are not meant to limit the invention unless otherwise stated<br>
in the claims appended hereto.<br>
Example 1<br>
The following procedure was utilized to synthesize a high molecular weight poly<br>
(methyl acrylate/acrylic acid) in 94/6 mole ratio. In a 1 liter polymerization flask fitted<br>

of Cranbury, New Jersey, 3.88 g of EO-PO block copolymer available from BASF, Mt.<br>
Olive, New Jersey and 0.096 g EDTA tetra sodium salt were taken and a solution was<br>
effected by mixing. To the clear solution, 0.19 g of Sag 2001 an antifoam available from<br>
Witco of Greenwich, CT. was added, nitrogen was sparged through the solution for 15<br>
minutes and the solution was cooled down to 10째C.<br>
Methyl acrylate (99%) 367.2g, AA 19.19g and formic acid 0.15g were mixed in<br>
an addition funnel. A third of this mixture was added to the emulsifier solution in the<br>
reactor and the nitrogen sparge was continued for additional 10 minutes. Ferrous sulfate<br>
heptahydrate, 0.002g, was dissolved in a mixture of sulfuric acid, 0.07g, and water 6.9g,<br>
and the potassium chlorate, 0.0019g, was dissolved in water, 6.9g. The initiator solutions<br>
were drawn into separate syringes and fitted into metered syringe pumps. The initiators<br>
were pumped in at a slow rate so as to maintain a constant reaction temperature, 10-13째C.<br>
When no more exotherm was seen, the initiator addition was stopped and another third of<br>
the monomer was added to the reactor. Polymerization was repeated as described above.<br>
Finally, the third lot of the monomer was added and completed the polymerization. After<br>
completing the polymerization, the reaction temperature was raised to 25째C and held at<br>
that temperature for an hour so as to reduce the unreacted monomer level to 
polymer was collected to determine the gel No. (100 mesh screen) and hydrolyzed in<br>
caustic at 1% emulsion concentration to determine the residual monomer by liquid<br>
chromatography (for acrylic acid) and the reduced specific viscosity/intrinsic<br>
viscosity/molecular weight. Polymers synthesized according to this general procedure<br>
are described in Table I.<br>
Example 2<br>
Another procedure utilized to synthesize a high molecular weight<br>
poly(methylacrylate/acrylic acid) in 97.5/2.5 mole ratio is as follows: In a 1 liter<br>
polymerization flask deioinized water, 606.75g, ammonium nonylphenol ethoxylate<br>
sulfate (58%) 54.3g available from Rhone-Poulenc of Cranbury, New Jersey octylphenol<br>
ethoxylate (70%) 4.9g available from Rhone-Poulenc of Cranbury, New Jersey, EO-PO<br>
block copolymer 4.8g available from BASF of Mt. Olive, New Jersey, EDTA 0.2g were<br>
weighed and mixed until a clear solution resulted. Then the silicone antifoam, 5g, was<br>
added and nitrogen was sparged for 15 minutes with cooling down to 10째C.<br>
Methyl acrylate (99%) 296.7g, acrylic acid 6.3g and formic acid, 0.15g was taken<br>
into an addition funnel. A third of this mixture was added to the aqueous phase while<br>
nitrogen sparge was continued for 10 more minutes. Potassium chlorate, 0.0035g was<br>
dissolved in 10.32g of deionized water and the ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, 0.003g was<br>
dissolved in sulfuric acid, 0.012g, in water, 10.32g. The initiator solutions were drawn<br>
into syringes and mounted onto separate syringe pumps. Polymers synthesized according<br>
to this general procedure are described in Table I.<br>
Example 3<br>
Low molecular weight poly(methyl acrylate/acrylic acid) polymer was obtained<br>
by using a procedure similar to that of Example 2 except that substantial amounts of<br>
isopropyl alcohol were used as the chain transfer agent in the monomer phase. The<br>
aqueous phase consisting of the emulsifiers as describe in Example 2 was used. The<br>
monomer phase consisted of methyl acrylate (99%) 296.6g, and acrylic acid, 6.3g, with<br>
isopropyl alcohol, 16g.Tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (70%) 0.005g was diluted with<br>
water, 10.32g and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, 0.0035, was dissolved in sulfuric acid,<br>
0.012g, in water, 10.32g. The solutions were fed using piston pumps as described above.<br>
The reaction was initiated at 20째C and maintained at 20-25째C. The reaction was post<br>
heated at 40째C/l hour. Representative products are described in Table I.<br>
Example 4<br>
The synthesis of oil in water emulsion of poly(methyl acrylate) homopolymer was<br>
effected in the following manner. In a 1 liter polymerization flask fitted with baffles,<br>
561.49 g of deionized water, 54.3 g of nonylphenol ethoxylate sulfate ammonium salt<br>
(58% solution), available from Rhone-Poulenc of Cranbury, New Jersey, 4.9 g of<br>
octylphenol ethoxylate(70%), available from Rhone-Poulenc of Cranbury, New Jersey,<br>
4.8 g of EO-PO block copolymer available from BASF, Mt Olive, New Jersey, 0.1 g<br>
EDTA tetra sodium salt and sulfuric acid (0.02 g) were taken and a solution was effected<br>
by mixing. To the clear solution, 5.0 g of Sag 2001, an antifoam available from Witco of<br>
Greenwich, CT was added, nitrogen was sparged through the solution for 15 minutes and<br>
the solution was cooled down to 10째C.<br>
The monomer, methyl acrylate (99%) 353.54 g, and formic acid 0.175g were<br>
mixed in an addition funnel. A third of the monomer was added to the emulsifier solution<br>
in the reactor and the nitrogen sparge was continued for additional 10 minutes. Ferrous<br>
heptahydrate, 0.002g, was dissolved in sulfuric acid, 0.07g, solution in water 6.9g, and<br>
the potassium chlorate, 0.0019g, was dissolved in water, 6.9 g. The initiator solutions<br>
were drawn into separate syringes and fitted into metered syringe pumps. The initiators<br>
were pumped in at a slow rate so as to maintain a constant reaction temperature, 10-13째C.<br>
When no more exotherm was seen, the initiator addition was stopped and another third of<br>
the monomer was added to the reactor. Polymerization was repeated as described above.<br>
Finally, the third lot of the monomer was added and completed the polymerization.<br>
After completing the polymerization, the reaction temperature was raised to 25째C<br>
so as to reduce the unreacted monomer level to 
determine the gel No. (100 mesh screen) and hydrolyzed for 1 hr at 85 째C in caustic at 1%<br>
emulsion concentration to determine the residual monomer by liquid chromatography (for<br>
acrylic acid) and the reduced specific viscosity, intrinsic viscosity, and molecular weight.<br>
The hydrolyzed MA homopolymer had an RSV of 28.3 dL/g. This polymer has a<br>
molecular weight of between 4.4 and 5.2 xlO6.<br>
Table I illustrates the properties of the polymers made by the synthetic schemes<br>
described in Examples 1 and 2, labeled as polymers 1-8. Polymers 1-6 and 8 were<br>
synthesized according to the procedure in Example 1. Polymer 7, was synthesized<br>
according to the procedure in Example 2, and polymers 9 and 10 according to the<br>
procedure in Example 3. For comparative purposes, polymers 9-10 represent polymers of<br>
the approximate molecular weight disclosed by the Japanese references, as described in<br>
Examnle 3.<br>
To determine that polymers 9 and 10 are equivalent to those of the Japanese<br>
references, the following procedure was utilized.<br>
Methods practiced to characterize polymers are Reduced Specific Viscosity<br>
(RSV) and Intrinsic Viscosity (IV) measurements. The RSV measurement may be used<br>
indirectly to compare polymer molecular weight. If RSV versus polymer concentration<br>
is plotted and the linear curve is extrapolated to zero concentration (infinite dilute) the<br>
intercept is the IV. The IV value is used to estimate the viscosity average molecular<br>
weight of the polymer via the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada equation.<br>
?=k Mw? which upon rearrangement gives<br>
viscosity average Mw=[?/k]1/?<br>
where ? is the intrinsic viscosity and the coefficients k and a are constants for the<br>
particular polymer type, temperature and solvent system employed.<br>
Upon complete hydrolysis of the methyl acrylate homopolymers (p.MA) or<br>
methyl acrylate/acrylic acid copolymers (p.MA/AA), a sodium acrylate polymer<br>
(p.NaAc) is formed. Thus, the coefficients k= 5.41X10-6 and ? = 0.981 for poly(sodium<br>
acrylate) in 1 M NaCl published by K. J. McCarthy, C. W. Burkhardt and D.P. Parazak<br>
(J. Applied Polvmer Science, Vol. 33, pp 1683-1698,1987) were used for molecular<br>
weight determinations in this work.<br>
Reduced Specific Viscosity measurements were made using Cannon Ubbelohde<br>
semi-micro dilution viscometers (Size 75), at 30 + or 0.02째C. Unless noted, the RSV of<br>
all of the new oil-in-water polymers were determined at a constant polymer<br>
concentration, 0.04 wt % as p.AA, in a 2 N NaNO, solution (i.e., 17% NaNO3). It is<br>
important to define these conditions, as the RSV value is dependent on polymer<br>
concentration and the concentration of salt. Thus, the intrinsic viscosity will also change<br>
with the solvent type and ionic strength used. For the anionic polymers considered in this<br>
work, for example, the IV value will increase as the ionic strength of the solvent is<br>
decreased (e.g., 1 N vs 2 N NaNO,). Since there are no universal standards, great<br>
attention must be paid to (l) the conditions employed, and (2) the values used for the<br>
constants k and a in the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada equation, when comparing polymer<br>
molecular weights referred to in the literature or patents.<br>
Tsukawaki and Inamoto (Kao Soap Co.) were the first to report the oil-in-water<br>
emulsion polyacrylates and the application of these in the Bayer process (U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,755,531). The Intrinsic viscosities of their methyl acrylate polymers varied from 1.6 to<br>
7.4 as measured in acetone at 30째C. A polymer with IV of 3 dL/g in acetone, upon<br>
hydrolysis gave and IV of 5.5 dL/g in 2N NaOH at 30째C. From this it may be<br>
extrapolated that the IV range for the Tsukawaki and Inamoto methyl acrylate polymers<br>
will be 2.9 to 13.6 in 2N NaOH.<br>
It is essential to note that the solvent strength for Tsukawaki and Inamoto<br>
polymers is approximately half of that used for this invention (2 N NaOH = 8.0% salt<br>
while 2 N NaNO3 = 17% salt). Thus, the intrinsic viscosities of the Tsukawaki and<br>
Inamoto methyl acrylate polymers would be significantly lower, if performed in 2 N<br>
NaNO3. For comparison purposes, the IV range of 2.9 to 13.6 dL/g for the Tsukawaki<br>
and Inamoto methyl acrylate polymers may be used to estimate molecular weights to<br>
compare them to the new polymers of this work.<br>
Table I shows that the polymers disclosed herein have a molecular weight range<br>
of 4.4 to 8.1 million while the Tsukawaki and Inamoto polymers are significantly lower<br>
0.69 to 3.3 million, a liberal estimate of the upper limit as in Table II.<br>
The application of the Tsukawaki and Inamoto methyl acrylate polymers has also<br>
been reported by K. Yamada, T. Harato and Y. Shiozaki ("Light Metals", Presented at<br>
the 109th AIME Annual Meeting, Feb. 24-28, 1980). The polymers used therein were<br>
homopolymer of methyl acrylate (obviously obtained from Tsukawaki and Inamoto)<br>
having intrinsic viscosities of 3.5 and 5.6 in acetone at 30째C.<br>
However, also reported is a 70/30 mol % sodium acrylate/methyl acrylate<br>
copolymer with an intrinsic viscosity of 8.7 dL/g in 2 N NaOH. Again, the intrinsic<br>
viscosity of this polymer would be lower if the measurement was made in 2 N NaNO3 as<br>
performed for all polymers in this work. Thus, this polymer would have a molecular<br>
weight lower than 2.1 million, by the method utilized herein.<br>
An additional Japanese patent application by T. Kotani et al. (June 15, 1977)<br>
describes the synthesis of high molecular weight acrylate polymers of the methyl, ethyl<br>
and butyl esters. Therein, the high molecular weight polymers are reported to be in the<br>
range of 7 -50 million, with a specific example of a polymer synthesized having a<br>
molecular weight of 27 million. However, this scale is based on molecular weight<br>
calculations in an organic system. The currently utilized technique for this sort of<br>
molecular weight determination is that the determination is done in an aqueous solvent.<br>
The numerical scale is thus dependent upon the solvent system utilized. With the<br>
physical constants described by Kotani et al, the Mark-Houink equation may be utilized<br>
along with the appropriate values for the constants k = 28.2 x 10-3and alpha = 0.52 (as<br>
obtained from the Polymer Handbook) to obtain a molecular weight equivalent in terms<br>
of the scale utilized herein to only 0.2 million. Therefore, the ultra-high molecular<br>
weight polymers obtained at that time are far smaller than those disclosed herein. In fact,<br>
molecular weight of the polymers described herein by the analytical technique employing<br>
an organic solvent (as was done in Kotani et al) is not applicable to the polymers<br>
disclosed herein because the surfactant package and the extremely high MW polymer<br>
precipitate and contribute to an erroneous result under the conditions described in Kotani<br>
et al. This is further evidence that the polymers disclosed herein are of far greater<br>
molecular weight than those described in Kotani et al.<br>
Table I shows that the polymers described herein are much larger than those<br>
previously described, as summarized in Table II. These results reveal that prior to this<br>
disclosure, "ultra high molecular weight" polymers of this type were considered to be up<br>
to and including molecular weights of only about 3 million. By contrast, this invention<br>
documents far larger polymers, which are much more active than those polymers of Table<br>
II. Example 5 illustrates that such novel, much higher molecular weight polymers in<br>
combination with lower molecular weight copolymers produce surprisingly greater<br>
settling rates and clarity in the Bayer process.<br>
Activity tests reported herein were performed with the hydrolyzed poly sodium<br>
aery late samples of the current invention, the true emulsion polymers. Hydrolysis was<br>
effected using 1% of the emulsion in 1% NaOH at 85째C for 20 minutes.<br>
The rate at which the new methyPacrylate polymers are hydrolyzed can be<br>
controlled by the mole ratio of caustic to polymer concentration and by the reaction<br>
temperature. As hydrolysis occurs, the polymers become more water soluble. T. Kotani<br>
et al. teach that no significant hydrolysis occurred on a 2% solution of polyacrylate latex<br>
sample at a caustic level of 0.5 -1.0 (mol ratio of NaOH/acrylic ester), even at 100째C.<br>
over three hours. Viscosity measurements could not be obtained because their polymers<br>
were insoluble/nonhydrolyzable.<br>
Hydrolysis of Samples 1 and 5 in Table I above, at 1%, were performed at a lower<br>
temperature, 85째C, and at a NaOH/methyl acrylate ester mole ratio of 1 for 1, 2 and 3<br>
hours. Colloid titration was used to determine the anionic charge and the degree of<br>
hydrolysis. The Table III below summarizes the results.<br>
Example 5<br>
Settling Rate Test Procedure<br>
The following general test procedure was utilized to obtain settling rate<br>
information. A well mixed sample of settler feed slurry (red mud obtained from a<br>
mineral processing facility) was portioned out into twelve 1000-mL Nalgene graduated<br>
cylinders by filling all the cylinders to the 500-mL graduation. The remaining 500-mL<br>
are then added to the cylinders in the opposite order. These cylinders were immediately<br>
placed in an oven or hot water bath thermostated to 100째C.<br>
The 1000-mL sample was then transferred to a stainless steel pot and heated to<br>
100째 C with a flame. The resulting slurry was transferred back to the 1000-mL graduated<br>
cylinder.<br>
Next, the cylinder was immediately mixed by two plunges. The plunger was a<br>
1/8" metal rod with a #10 rubber stopper attached to the bottom end. The plunger was<br>
allowed to fall freely on the downward stroke and lifted at the same speed on the upward<br>
stroke. To test a polymer, that polymer was added to the 1000 ml graduated cylinder and<br>
mixed with four plunges.<br>
To determine settling rate, the time for the solid/liquid interface to travel between<br>
the 900 and 700 mL marks on the cylinder was recorded. After measuring the distance<br>
between the two marks, the settling rate could be calculated in (ft/hr) or (m/hr) units.<br>
Based on this information, a replacement ratio (RR) may be calculated by plotting<br>
a graph with settling rate on the Y-axis and dose on the X-axis for each product tested.<br>
The dosage required to produce the desired plant settling rate is determined from the<br>
above graph. The replacement ratio is the dose of new polymer divided by the dose of<br>
conventional treatment needed to obtain the plant settling rate. If the RR value is below<br>
one, the product is superior, if it is one, it would be equivalent, and if it is above one it is<br>
poorer in activity.<br>
Clarity Test Procedure<br>
The following procedure was utilized for measurement of overflow clarity from<br>
red mud settling tests.<br>
A clarity ratio is evaluated as a measure of the performance of the new polymer<br>
compared to conventional polymers. This is determined as the ratio of the overflow<br>
turbidity using the new polymer versus the turbidity of the overflow for the conventional<br>
flocculant at the same specific settling rate (i.e., the plant settling rate).<br>
The clarity of the settler overflow was simulated by determining the solids, mg/L,<br>
in a sample of the liquor in the 1000 ml graduated cylinder after a specific time after<br>
settling, (e.g., 10, 30 or 60 min). The overflow solids may be determined gravimetrically<br>
by filtering a specific volume of liquor, washing the solids with hot water and drying the<br>
solids in an oven at 100C for 2-4 hours. Alternatively, the turbidity of the overflow<br>
liquor was measured as an indirect measure of the overflow solids. The turbidity was<br>
determined using a Hach Co. turbidimeter. If the turbidity of the overflow sample is over<br>
the range of the meter, then the sample may be diluted to a specific volume using a hot 30<br>
wt. % NaOH solution (e.g., 5 ml of overflow combined with 10 ml of 30 wt. % NaOH<br>
solution).<br>
The high molecular weight homopolymer synthesized according to the procedure<br>
of Example 4 was tested as described above to demonstrate flocculation capabilities, in<br>
comparison to a conventional treatment. The results are detailed in Table IV. Thus the<br>
p(MA) product gave comparable results to a conventional treatment as evidenced by a<br>
replacement ratio (based on polymer actives) of 1.3 and a clarity ratio near 1.0.<br>
Table IV. Settling and Clarity Performance of a new poly(methyl acrylate)<br>
flocculant sample versus Conventional Treatment<br>
The copolymer combination of high and lower molecular weight p(MA/AA)<br>
copolymers was tested according to the procedures described above. The results are<br>
given in Table V. When a p(MA/AA) copolymer with RSV of 14-21 dl/g is applied first<br>
to the mud slurry followed by the addition of a small amount of the ultra high molecular<br>
5 weight p(MA/AA) polymer having RSV of 34-49 dL/g, overflow clarities can be<br>
improved by 40 to 70%.<br>
Table V Settling and Clarity Performance for single product us combination<br>
of low and high molecular weight products<br>
This illustrates that improved clarity is obtained using combination of the low and<br>
high molecular weight samples. Tests with addition of only the low molecular weight<br>
samples do not give settling rates in the desired range 10-50 ft/hr as indicated in Table<br>
VI.<br>
Using the procedures described above, poly(MA/AA) copolymers of different<br>
molecular weights as treated singly are compared to conventional treatments.<br>
Table VI. Settling and Clarity Performance of p(MA/AA) versus pNH4Ac - Single<br>
addition of the flocculant.<br>
In the absence of any treatment, settling rate would be less than 1 ft/hr and clarity<br>
would be &gt;4000 NTU for reference to Tables IV-VI.<br>
The results in Table V show that the sequential addition produces acceptable<br>
settling rates and clarity, while a single treatment can give good clarity but not acceptable<br>
settling rates.<br>
