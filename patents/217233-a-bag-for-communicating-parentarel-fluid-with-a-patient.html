DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As shown in Figure 1, an assembly 1 is disclosed which is<br>
formed of a plurality of polymeric sheets 10 and 12 wherein the sheets<br>
can be of a polyvinylchloride, polyolefin or other flexible, liquid-tight<br>
r<br>
and biocpmpatible material.<br>
The sheets are formed into a reservoir 20 capable of containing a medicament or a suitable diluent or other fluid. Reservoir 20 is defined by a plurality of welded seals 22,24, 26, and 28 wherein the seals are operative to separate the reservoir 20 from the rest of the bag assembly 1.<br>
Seals 22,24,26, and 28 are preferentially made by radio-frequency welding, but may be made by any other suitable process for making parenteral fluid delivery bags. The reservoir is further defined by a peripheral seal 30 which is formed about the outer edge of the bag assembly 1 and is operative to enclose the outer edges of reservoir 20 in cooperation with seals 22,24,26 and 28.<br>
The perimeter seal 30 also defines, in cooperation with the first upper reservoir seal 24 and the second upper reservoir seal 28, a first<br>
         hanging aperture 32 and a second hanging aperture 34 which are <br>
                operative to engage a bag hanger 200 as shown in Figure 2, thereby<br>
           orienting the bag assembly 1 correctly for administration of the fluid or<br><br>
                                 medicament contained in, or introduced to, reservoir 20.                                                       Line set 40 is formed integral with reservoir 20 and bag<br>
	assembly 1, and is in fluid communication with reservoir 20 via port<br>
                 41. The integral line set 40 is co-formed with bag 1 and is releasably<br>
attached thereto by a tearable seal 50. To deploy the line set 40, an operator, such as a nurse, would grasp the distal end 78 of the line set 40 and draw the distal end 78 away from the bag assembly 1, thereby<br><br>
releasing the tear seal 50 of the line set 40 and drawing the line set 40 out of the line set aperture 42 defined by the bag web 60 to which the line set 40 is attached via tear seal 50.<br>
In the pictured embodiment, line set 40 is spiral wound within web 60, and displays a continuous spiral tear seal 50. The instant invention contemplates a variety of line set layouts within web 60, including/ but not limited to, sinusoidal or folded s-shaped arrangements when the line set 40 is undeployed.<br>
Line set 40 is composed of a first envelope section 40A and a second envelope section 40B. In this embodiment the envelope sections are formed from sheets 10 and 12, out of which the rest of the bag assembly 1 is also formed.<br>
In an embodiment line set 40, consisting of envelopes 40A and 40B, is formed by sealing the first envelope 40A to the second envelope 406 forming fluid seal 52. Exterior to the fluid seal 52 is tear seal 50 as aforedescribed, thereby allowing deployment of line set 40 whilst<br>
maintaining integrity of the line set 40.   <br>
The distal end or terminus 79 of the line set 40 is fused or<br>
otherwise connected to an appropriate connector or fitment 80 which<br>
may be a septum, or luer fitting, or frangible connector, or some other connector or combination thereof suitable for intravenous delivery of fluids. Additionally, line set 40 is filled with fluid also resident in chamber 20, thereby eliminating the necessity of purging the line set of air as aforementioned.<br>
Associated with the chamber 20, and in fluid communication therewith, is a fill port 85 through which fluid is introduced into the chamber 20. Fill port 85 is subsequently sealed by plug 88, thereby<br>
closing off port 85 and fill tube 87. Alternatively, and preferred, the line set 40 may be used as a fill port prior to connecting the appropriate connector 80 to the line set 40. In an embodiment herein preferred, also associated with chamber 10, is a medicament introduction port 110 which is attached to bag 1 at support ring 100. Support ring 100 is formed with the rest of bag 1 and is operative to support introduction port 110 in a suitable position for administering a medicament from another container into chamber 20. In the preferred embodiment/ introduction port 110 is a spike connector, wherein the spike connector 110 has a connector cup 112 in contact with support ring 100 and a cup bottom 114, the exterior side of which is in contact with the interior of chamber 20. Also associated with connector 110 is an interior spike 130, said spike 130 being in fluid communication with chamber 20 subsequent to opening frangible plug 132.<br>
In operation, protective film 120 is removed exposing spike connector 130. A suitable medicament containing vial 136 is impaled on spike connector 130. Then frangible 132 is broken, allowing fluid communication between chamber l0 and the medicament containing vial 136, allowing the medicament in vial 136 to be introduced to a patient via line set 40.<br>
In the alternate embodiment of the invention a first fluid containing bag 200 has wrapped therearound a substantially helically wound line set 210 which is in fluid communication with the bag 200 by means of a fluid orifice 212. The line set 210 joins a second drainage line set 214 at a wye-junction 216 wherein the second leg of the wye 228 is integral with a drainage line  228 which is helically wound about drainage bag 222 and is formed integral therewith. Drainage line 228 is in fluid communication with drainage bag 222 by<br>
means of a drain orifice 224 at the proximal end 226 of the drain line<br>
The base of wye-junction 216 defines a common delivery and drain line 228, the distal end of which comprises an appropriate fitment 230. Inserted within the delivery line 220 and the drain line 228 are frangible plugs 232,734 which are operative to provide a uni¬directional flow of fluid from the delivery bag 200 to the patient and subsequently from the patient into drain bag 222.<br>
In operation in this embodiment of the invention an operator would deploy both the delivery line 228 and the drain line 228. The operator would then break the delivery line frangible plug after connecting the fitment to the patient thereby allowing fluid to flow from the delivery bag 200 to the patient When the delivery therapy is complete/ the operator would then break frangible plug 234 which is associated with drain line 228 thereby allowing fluid to drain from the patient into the receiving or drain bag 222.<br>
