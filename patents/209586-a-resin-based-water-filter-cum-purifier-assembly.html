This invention relates to a resin based water filter cum purifier assembly which is attachable to a faucet and operable manually.<br>
Water filter and purifiers using carbon filtration cartridge and ultra violet ray irradiation chambers are known in the art. "Aquaguard" a popular brand uses heat activated carbon filtration and UV irradiation for disinfecting water for drinking. Many household and commercial establishments have water purifier units for disinfecting water for drinking. Such units are found to be effective. However, these units are quite expensive and are not affordable by all. This is because the UV irradiation chamber used is an expensive technology. Also, most of these products require power for operation. This drawback has necessitated the development of a low price water filter cum purifier assembly which does not depend on power for its operation.<br>
The assembly developed by us consists of three main parts. They are a coupler housing, a purifier housing and a filter cum purifier cartridge. The device is designed such that, when purified water is not needed by the consumer, the water flows from the faucet through the coupler housing and comes out through a direct outlet port, provided at the under surface of the coupler housing. When purified water is required, the purifier housing is tilted downwards to establish communication with the water inlet of the faucet. Water passes through the housing, enters the filter pad and flows down through the carbon adsorption module and resin filled cartridge. Thus purified water comes out through the purified water outlet provided at the base of the purification housing.<br><br>
The working mechanisms of the above mentioned three main parts are as follows :-<br>
(i) The inlet port of the coupler housing may be connected to the faucet with the help of a conventional tap adapter. When the purifier housing is in a horizontal position, water coming from the faucet flows through the coupler housing directly to the water outlet port. When the purifier housing is in a vertical position, the water from the faucet is deviated to the water purification system.<br>
(ii) The inlet port of the purifier housing is connected to the coupler housing. This connection is locked in place with the help of a locking pin. Water is prevented from leaking into the direct water outlet by sealing the connection with rubber 'O' rings or washers. This arrangement ensures that water bypassing does not take place when the purification housing is titled to a vertical position. Transparent windows are provided on the sides of the purifier housing to monitor the filter cum purifier cartridge housed within it.<br>
(iii) The filter cum purifier cartridge is housed within the purifier housing. This cartridge is detachable by means of a cap provided at the bottom portion. This cartridge consists of three components.<br>
(a)	a sediment filter<br><br>
(b)	a carbon adsorption filter module<br>
(c)	a purification cartridge module<br><br>
a)	The sediment filter is a filter pad, made of polypropylene fabric, fixed on top of the entire filter cum purification cartridge. The incoming water flows through this filter medium. Physical impurities such as dust and dirt are removed fi"om the water before it enters the carbon adsorption and purification filter module.<br>
b)	The carbon adsorption filter module contains activated carbon for adsorption of organic impurities and chemicals such as chlorine and iodine fi:'om water which flows through it fi"om the sediment filter. From this module water passes to the purification module.<br>
c)	The purification cartridge module is filled with iodinated resin beads encased within a top mesh and a bottom mesh. These resin beads are capable of disinfecting and deactivating diseases causing microorganisms like bacteria and virus. A life exhaust identification ring is placed above the top mesh filter to indicate the life or potency of the resin. As water flows through this module, the resin beads expand and push a spring provided therein to indicate the life of the resin.   The life exhaustion identification ring is visible through<br><br>
the transparent window of the purifier housing.   Thus the user can identify when the purification cartridge needs to be replaced.<br>
This assembly is developed based on iodinated resin technology and does not require power for its operation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a resin based water filter cum purifier assembly, comprises a purifier housing provided with a water inlet and a purified water outlet accommodating a filter cum purifier cartridge within, said purifier housing is tiltably connected to a coupling means having inlet and outlet ports, said outlet port communicating with the water inlet of said purifier housing through a unidirectional water diverter, said inlet port aligning with a conventional faucet outlet when coupled therewith, said unidirectional diverter opens in the direction of the purifier housing when the same is tihed to a vertical position, and closes when the housing is horizontally disposed; said filter cum purifier cartridge comprises a sediment filter, a carbon adsorption filter module, and a resin based purification cartridge module.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the attached flow chart and with the figures in the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG     1:        is a flowchart of the water path of the resin based water filter and purifier assembly. Water flow is directed based on the users choice.<br><br>
FIG 2: shows the external view of the system with the purified water outlet port in closed condition. Reference numeral 1 stands for the coupler housing, which is attached to a faucet. Reference numeral 2 stands for the purifier housing. This purifier housing 2 is connected to the coupler housing 1 and is shown in its horizontal position in this figure.<br>
FIG 3: shows the external view of the system with the purified water outlet port in open condition. Reference numeral 1 stands for the coupler housing, which is attached to a faucet. Reference numeral 2 stands for the purifier housing. This purifier housing 2 is connected to the coupler housing 1 and is shown in its vertical position in this figure.<br>
FIG 4: shows a sectional view of the system with the purified water outlet port in open condition.<br>
Reference numeral 1 stands for the coupler housing which is connected to a faucet by means of a tap adapter. Reference numeral 2 stands for the purifier housing which houses the purification cartridge. This housing 2 is capable of tilting 90°. The purifier housing 2 is connected to the coupler housing 1 and this connection is locked with the help of a locking pin. When the user tilts the purifier housing 2 to be in a vertical position, in parallel with the faucet, water is diverted to this housing 2 and is allowed to pass through the filter cartridge before<br><br>
flowing out through the outlet. Reference numeral 3 stands for the purification cartridge which houses the sediment filter, activated carbon and iodinated resin beads. Water flows through the sediment filter, activated carbon and resin when the purifier housing 2 is tilted in a vertical position. Thus the tap water is purified and is delivered through the purified water outlet provided at the end of the purifier housing 2.<br>
Obvious modifications and alterations known to persons skilled in the art are within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
