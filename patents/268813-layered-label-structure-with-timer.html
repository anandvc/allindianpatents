LAYERED LABEL STRUCTURE WITH TIMER<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/670,076, filed April 11, 2005 and U.S. Patent Application No. 11/209,345, filed<br>
August 22, 2005.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a thin, layered, active label structure with built-in<br>
electronic functionality, for example an embedded active display and associated<br>
electronics for driving the display. The display and/or other functional elements in the<br>
structure are formed by printing processes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Product labels have played an important role in communicating information to<br>
people and devices. Typically, the primary purpose of labels is to provide information<br>
such as: directions for use; product identification; trademarks; promotions; production;<br>
freshness or "use-by" dates; product authentication; and other product-related<br>
information. Existing labels generally convey static information such as type, logos,<br>
graphics and product identification information, such as barcodes and the like. Although<br>
variable information (e.g., product serial numbers) has been introduced to individual parts<br>
of some existing labels, once such labels are produced, the image cannot be changed<br>
without removing layers or physically altering the surface.<br>
[0004] Though it is highly desirable to include an active image in product labels, few<br>
effective and affordable methods currently achieve this function. Currently, labels are<br>
generally produced in extremely large volumes at very low cost using traditional printing<br>
processes. Thus, the desire to include active image functionality to the labels through<br>
existing methods has also been limited by the inability to introduce an active image<br>
without modifying the existing manufacturing processes and absorbing the associated<br>
costs. The desire to provide active image functionality through existing methods is also<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
present for applications that are not labels in the usual sense (i.e. labels are usually<br>
affixed to the product or its container) but are closely associated with a product or<br>
service; for example, a timer token packaged with a product indicating elapsed time<br>
relating to product use, variable use instructions, or other active package inserts may be<br>
produced to accompany product packaging or be constructed directly on product<br>
packaging.<br>
[0005] Some methods exist in the art to provide active image labels through the use of<br>
thermochromic or photochromic inks that respond to environmental conditions such as<br>
temperature or light. However, the utility of such approaches is limited due to the<br>
extreme environmental changes required to alter the image. Likewise, optically variable<br>
images have been used to add active components to labels, but the utility of such<br>
approaches is limited by the inability to control the activation of an alternate image.<br>
[0006] Other active labels implement methods to communicate information from the<br>
label to a machine through the use of RF energy for providing information. Although this<br>
method provides additional information to compatible machines, it does not allow<br>
additional communication to humans, because the stored information is not<br>
communicated visually.<br>
[0007] Another approach for providing active images in labels has been through thin<br>
displays. Displays are generally differentiated from print by the capability to actively<br>
change an image. Print is considered static, because once the image is produced, it<br>
cannot change or be influenced by the external environment. Displays, on the other hand,<br>
have the ability to change, based on a given input or environmental condition.<br>
[0008] Another differentiating factor between displays and traditional printed labels is<br>
cost. The cost for traditional print is very low due to the large volumes produced; the<br>
substrate used (paper) and the production processes. Typical printing processes run at<br>
very high speeds and use low cost substrates to convey information at the extremely low<br>
cost point necessary for widespread application. Print processes can easily change over<br>
from one print job to the next. Trillions of square feet of static print are produced<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
annually via these processes on a global basis. They include newspapers, product<br>
packaging, product labels, publications and many other applications.<br>
[0009] By contrast, conventional displays are typically produced by traditional electronic<br>
assembly processes. Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) and Organic Light Emitting Diodes<br>
(OLEDs) are produced in conventional electronic fabrication plants, using micro-<br>
assembly techniques, and are built on polarized glass. Extreme precision is required on<br>
the disposition of the active components, and environmental conditions also must be<br>
tightly controlled.<br>
[0010] Displays can vary in complexity from simple, single dot or icon images to full-<br>
color video. The information content depends on the purpose of the specific display and<br>
the particular communication need. Examples may include a single icon that<br>
communicates a desired warning message, an alpha-numeric display that communicates<br>
words and numeric values or a matrix addressable display that communicates more<br>
complex images such as maps or pictures. The rate at which the display can change or<br>
update determines the stream of information which can be updated.<br>
[0011] Display technology has evolved to meet society's need for increased information.<br>
Of particular interest is the need to provide displays that are thin and withstand flexing at<br>
a cost that allows widespread implementation on disposable items in extremely high<br>
volumes.<br>
[0012] Several attempts have been made to produce such displays. LCDs were<br>
developed using glass as the substrate. Some recent flexible LCD developments achieve<br>
the necessary flexibility but are still extremely costly to produce. Other flexible<br>
technologies include electrophoretic displays such as those described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,445,489. Electrophoretic displays exhibit the necessary flexibility but currently cannot<br>
be produced with existing high-volume and low-cost printing production processes.<br>
[0013] Other advances have been made in higher content displays as well. OLEDs<br>
provide color and very high resolution. OLEDs can be made flexible but require<br>
significant power and are most suitable for high value, high content applications.<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
[0014] As described, printing techniques generally benefit from cost savings and<br>
production efficiencies. Electro-phoretic displays take advantage of some of the print<br>
manufacturing process benefits. This technology may implement screen printing to<br>
deposit the active layer between a conductive front and backplane. However, relatively<br>
thick layers of ink are required and cell thickness must be tightly controlled. Moreover,<br>
operating voltages for electro-phoretic displays are high, typically more than 7 volts,<br>
which requires additional components to alter the power from traditional batteries.<br>
[0015] Thus, there is a need for a thin and flexible, layered label structure with built-in<br>
electronic functionality, such as an embedded active display and associated electronics<br>
for driving the display. This need also extends to non-label structures as well, such as<br>
timer tokens, variable instructions, electrochromic holographic structures, or other active<br>
structures. There is also a need for such label and non-label structures with active<br>
displays that visually convey desired information to humans. Moreover, there is a need<br>
to produce a structure with electronic functionality through low-cost methods, such as<br>
printing processes, that allow for widespread implementation on disposable items in<br>
extremely high volumes. There is also a need for the structure with electronic<br>
functionality to be powered by a relatively low voltage and/or current.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016] The present invention relates to a thin, layered, variable label structure with built-<br>
in electronic functionality. The display and/or other functional elements in the structure<br>
may be formed by printing processes. The label structure includes a thin, layered<br>
structure with an active display, comprising a base layer and a cover layer of material and<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0032] Introduction<br>
[0033] The present invention relates to label display technology that can be produced<br>
entirely or primarily through printing processes, such as the flexographic, gravure, or<br>
rotary screen processes. The resulting display labels are extremely thin and flexible and<br>
can be printed on a variety of substrates such as papers, films, foils or other flexible<br>
substrates. The low cost associated with the printing processes and the label materials<br>
allows implementation at very high volumes that cannot be achieved with current display<br>
technologies. The display labels may be powered through a variety of means, such as an<br>
external probe, an RF antenna, or an internal embedded or printed battery. The label<br>
structures described herein may also be constructed in non-label embodiments as well,<br>
such as timer tokens, package instructions, electrochromic holographic structures, or<br>
other active structures.<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
[0034] The display labels provide active images that can be controlled by a variety of<br>
actuating events that cause the label to display visual information. The display labels of<br>
the present invention typically employ electrochromic material as the display, which<br>
responds chemically and visibly to an actuating event. The display may be produced<br>
with existing print processes used to manufacture conventional static images by<br>
depositing the electrochromic material in the desired configuration, as described in more<br>
detail below. Activation of the label's image requires an electrical input, which can be<br>
controlled through the use of printed switches, sensors, or other low cost actuation<br>
methods.<br>
[0035] The invention allows for the combination of active images in the electrochromic<br>
display material with static images elsewhere in the label, which increases the quantity of<br>
information communicated visually by the label. The information communicated by the<br>
display label may be simple, such as an "on/off message indicator or "good/bad"<br>
message indicator. Alternatively, more complicated infonnation may also be<br>
communicated through the display label through the use of configurations such as an<br>
active matrix display. Regardless of the complexity of the infonnation communicated,<br>
the image of the active display generally changes in response to an actuating event.<br>
[0036] Display<br>
[0037] With reference to Figure 1, the display label includes an electrochromic display<br>
material 110 deposited in the label structure in contact with a pair of spaced apart<br>
electrodes 120 and 130, which may be described as the anode and cathode of the display.<br>
The display construction, described in more detail below, requires the positive electrode<br>
(cathode) 130 and negative electrode (anode) 120 be configured to supply a direct current<br>
and potential across the display material 110. The electrochromic display material 110 is<br>
typically formed with non-aqueous electro-active ink. Examples of such inks are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,639,709, 6,744,549, and 6,879,424, and U.S. Application<br>
No. 11/029,201, entitled "Universal Display Module, filed January 4, 2005, each hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
[0038] A variety of actuating events, as described below, may trigger a change in the<br>
display material 110. An actuating event creates a potential difference across the two<br>
electrodes 120 and 130, which in turn causes at least a portion of the display material 110<br>
to image, i.e., to present a visible change in the display material 110. Specifically, the<br>
display material 110 is caused to image by connecting the electrodes to a DC power<br>
supply. The applied voltage causes current to run across the display material 110, which,<br>
in turn results in illumination or "imaging" of the display material ink. The non-aqueous<br>
ink described above is known to image at about 1.2 volts DC, but lower voltages such as<br>
0.8 volts may suffice in certain configurations.<br>
[0039] The geometry of the electrodes and display material can be varied independent of<br>
the power source provided, as is described in more detail below. The electrodes are<br>
configured in either a planar configuration, formed side-by-side on the same substrate of<br>
the display label, or in a co-planar geometry, formed on different substrates of the display<br>
label. In the co-planar arrangement, the anode and cathode are spatially and electrically<br>
separated by spacer or a suitable dielectric material.<br>
[0040] Label Construction<br>
[0041] The display label components of the present invention are produced through<br>
traditional print processes such as the rotary or flat screen printing, flexography, or<br>
gravure processes. The construction of the label structure, including the display material<br>
and power source, may be produced through a high speed print process, which allows for<br>
high-quantity and low-cost production of the labels. Additionally, non-printed,<br>
preformed components, such as integrated circuits and sensors, may be inserted to the<br>
label structure during or after the printing process.<br>
[0042] Suitable print processes include offset lithography, flexography, gravure, screen<br>
printing and digital printing such as electrostatic toners and ink jet. Offset lithography<br>
dominates the traditional print markets due to the high speeds, full color and substrate<br>
tolerances achieved. The next highest volume print methods include flexography and<br>
gravure. The primary advantages of these processes are that a wide variety of inks and<br>
substrates can be used at high speed. Screen printing can be used in either a rotary format<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
or flat-bed format. The primary advantage of screen printing is that thicker ink layers can<br>
be deposited than by either lithography, flexography or gravure, but the process typically<br>
runs much slower. These methods do not typically allow for changes on a sheet-by-sheet<br>
basis. However, when variability of the image is not a dominating consideration or the<br>
print run is long, these methods entail much lower cost than other print methods.<br>
[0043] The primary advantage of digital print methods is the ability to change images on<br>
a sheet-by-sheet or cell-by-cell basis which allows variable print and is particularly<br>
economical when only short print runs are required. This method may be desirable when<br>
variable images are required, such as serialization of a set of labels.<br>
[0044] Figures 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D show a schematic cross-section side view of a label<br>
structure 200 incorporating an active display 110, each powered by different means in<br>
accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The label structure 200 includes<br>
several discrete layers, which are applied sequentially during the printing process. In the<br>
embodiments shown in Figures 2A-2D, these layers, or components, include a base layer<br>
210, circuitry 220, display material 110, a laminating adhesive 230, a cover film 240, and<br>
a graphic ink layer 250.<br>
[0045] The base layer, or base substrate, 210 supports the overall label structure. Base<br>
layer 210 is typically a traditional label stock and may include a poly-coated paper or<br>
film with a pressure sensitive adhesive coated on one side and may be laminated to a<br>
silicone coated release sheet. However, different substrates may be suitable for the base<br>
layer 210, such as paper, card stocks, un-supported films and the like.<br>
[0046] The circuitry 220 includes anodic electrode 120 and cathodic electrode 130, along<br>
with their respective conductive traces 290 and 280 connecting them to a power source<br>
and any other desired interconnecting circuits and pixels. The electrodes 120 and 130<br>
and conductive traces 290 and 280 may be produced using a variety of conductive<br>
materials for both the anode and cathode. For planar electrode configurations, examples<br>
of suitable electrode conductor materials for the circuitry layer 220 include printed<br>
conductive silver, etched or stamped foils, printed conductive carbon or die cut metallic<br>
foils. The cathode conductor 130 should have chemical resistance to the electro-active<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
ink, suitable conductivity, and the ability to pattern the electrodes spatially. Typically,<br>
the traces 280 and 290 are produced by a printing process with the same conductive<br>
material. For co-planar electrode configurations, suitable backplanes in circuitry layer<br>
220 on base layer 210 can be constructed using a wide variety of conductive materials.<br>
The backplane typically forms the display image, which can be as complex as a matrix<br>
addressable pattern or as simple as a single pixel indicator.<br>
[0047] The laminating adhesive 230 encloses the display material 110, and the cover film<br>
240 encapsulates the top portion of the display material 110. The adhesive 230 is applied<br>
by printing around the display material 110 and adheres the cover film 240 to the base<br>
layer 210 or the circuitry layer 220. The cover film 240 is a clear film of any number of<br>
suitable materials, such as polyester, polyethylene, or PVC, and it is laminated over the<br>
display material 110 and adhesive 230. In a side-by-side, or planar, configuration as<br>
shown in Figs. 2A-2D, where the positive electrode 130 and negative electrode 120 are<br>
both situated in the same layer, namely the circuitry layer 220, the display material 110 is<br>
encased by cover film 240, which is a clear overprint to protect the lower layers and<br>
contain the display materials. The anodic and cathodic electrodes 120 and 130 are<br>
produced as pail of circuitry layer 220 on top of layer 210. When power is applied to the<br>
traces 280 and 290, the current flows between the two electrodes 120/130 and activates<br>
the display.<br>
[0048] Alternatively, cover film 240 may be a clear conductive film, such as Indium Tin<br>
Oxide coated polyester (ITO film). In this case, the cathode is printed and the ITO both<br>
forms the anode and functions as the protective layer. The ITO film is attached to the<br>
backplane through the use of a printed laminating adhesive. A conductive adhesive can<br>
also be printed to provide an electrical connection between the ITO and the backplane, if<br>
desired. Connection of the frontplane conductor 240 to the backplane, if desired, may<br>
also be achieved by depositing a drop of conductive adhesive which provides an<br>
electrical connection between the anode and the anode circuit on the backplane. When<br>
voltage is applied to the display, current flows between the backplane conductor and the<br>
surface of the ITO film.<br>
-10-<br><br>

[0049] If a cover film 240 is not desired, a protective layer, such as varnish, can be<br>
printed over the display 110 to protect and contain it. The varnish is deposited as a<br>
printed coating and is cured through UV or EB radiation or through-thermal drying<br>
during the print process.<br>
[0050] A graphic ink layer 250 may be applied to the cover film 240. The graphic ink<br>
layer 250 is printed with traditional graphic inks to produce the desired static image,<br>
message, or other information for the label, such as calibration marks having a specified<br>
relation to the display or directions for use. The graphic ink layer 250 includes a window<br>
to allow the display material 100 to be visible, which allows the static images of the<br>
graphic ink layer 250 to be used in concert with the active images produced by in the<br>
display material 110. For example, it may be desirable for certain applications to print a<br>
reference color or color scale on the graphic ink layer 250 that approximates the active<br>
color of the display material 110 in proximity of the active image to provide a visual<br>
reference for the user.<br>
[0051] In some embodiments, the label structure 200 includes an IC, sensor, or other<br>
electrical component that is not printable and which is in electrical connection with the<br>
electrodes 120/130 and configured to drive display material 110. The IC provides<br>
dynamic communication to the display 110 to achieve varying images as desired. The<br>
incorporation of an IC, sensor, or other electrical component provides a means to increase<br>
the complexity of display possibilities, thereby achieving greater information<br>
communication. For example, Figure 2D shows a label structure 200 including a sensor<br>
330 embedded into circuitry layer 220 by adhesive 230. The sensor 330 may be any<br>
number of known sensors, such as an environmental sensor that measures temperature or<br>
pressure. The sensor may be placed so as to sense conditions actually present in or near a<br>
product or to sense more generally the conditions surrounding a product.<br>
[0052] In addition to the particular layers and components described, for particular<br>
applications of the label structure 200, a variety of other layers and electrical components<br>
maybe incorporated into circuitry 220 or even other layers of the structure 200. The<br>
surfaces of the structure 200 and the various constituent layers can be used to carry the<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
necessary connecting circuitry for electrical elements. Each layer's front and back may<br>
be used.for circuitry, including printable resistive, dielectric, or other components.<br>
Techniques such as through-hole printing may be employed to bring a conductive circuit<br>
from one face of a layer to the other. This is accomplished by providing a via through a<br>
film layer that is connected electrically by providing a conductive material through the<br>
via. The circuitry may be in the form of conductive traces such as printed silver or other<br>
conductive, resistive, or dielectric materials that are known in the art. For example, in<br>
one embodiment of the present invention the label structure is usable as a timer device.<br>
In this embodiment, printed resistors may be provided to govern the current flow to<br>
individual pixels of the display material 110, which alters the rate of imaging of each<br>
pixel. As described in more detail below, by appropriately calibrating the resistors as a<br>
function of time, the individual pixels are thereby sequentially activated, which allows<br>
the label to function as a low cost timer.<br>
[0053] Thus, all of the elements and components of the label structure 200 may either be<br>
printed in a printing line or readily added to the steps occurring in a printing line. Known<br>
processes may be used to print, or build with printed layers, a wide variety of elements<br>
such as display pixels, conductive traces, resistors, switches, batteries, capacitors,<br>
conductive adhesive, electrodes, capacitors, and antennas. These processes are described<br>
in more detail in U.S. Patent Application No. 11/209,345, entitled, "Layered Structure<br>
with Printed Elements," filed August 22, 2005, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[0054] Power<br>
[0055] In addition to the need to produce the label structure in high volumes, a low cost<br>
means to stimulate and control the display must be implemented. Electrical power is<br>
required to activate most display technologies, and minimizing the power required to<br>
activate the display reduces the overall cost of the display label. The electrochromic<br>
display technology described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,639,709, 6,744,549, and 6,879,424<br>
operates at low voltage and current (on the order of 0.8 to 3.0 volts). For instance, in<br>
some embodiments the minimum voltage required to activate the image may be less than<br>
IV. The electrical current required for this technology is a function of the display<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
thickness. For example, display thicknesses may be printed at .011, .005, and .003<br>
inches. The corresponding response time for each display (i.e., the time from application<br>
of power to a visible change) under identical power conditions is 250 milliseconds, 80<br>
milliseconds, and 50 milliseconds respectively.<br>
[0056] Generally, the actuating event that activates the display material does so by<br>
completing a circuit between a power source and the electrodes 120/130. The displays<br>
may be activated by a variety of power sources, such as external probes, RF fields, and<br>
internal power. The selection of power source may be dictated by the particular<br>
application of the display label.<br>
[0057] In one embodiment of the present invention, an external power supply such as a<br>
probe is employed to activate the display. With reference to Figure 2A, the label<br>
structure 200 includes a positive terminal 260 and a negative terminal 270 that are<br>
electrically connected to electrodes 130 and 120 respectively. The terminals are<br>
connected to the electrodes by conductive traces 280 and 290. Because structure 200<br>
includes a plurality of layers, each layer, front and back, may be used for circuitry,<br>
including printable conductive traces. Techniques such as through-hole printing may be<br>
employed to bring a conductive traces 280 and 290 from one face of a layer to the other<br>
as shown in Figure 2A. The conductive traces may be a printed silver or other<br>
conductive material that is known in the art. This process is described in more detail in<br>
U.S. Patent Application No. 11/209,345. Because terminals 260 and 270 are situated on<br>
an outer surface of the label structure, they are exposed such that they may be contacted<br>
by an external probe to supply the desired voltage and current to the display, which<br>
changes the image of the display material 110. The external supply may be part of a<br>
larger assembly, if desired. Typically, such an external supply is battery operated and<br>
portable. With the external probe, the actuating event is typically the action of bringing<br>
the probe into contact with terminals 260 and 270. Such a label provides an inexpensive<br>
way to display an otherwise invisible authentication marking.<br>
[0058] As shown in Figure 2B, in another embodiment of the present invention the label<br>
structure 200 includes a properly tuned RF antenna 310. The antenna 310 is electrically<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
connected directly to the electrodes 120 and 130 by traces 290 and 280 and may be<br>
printed through the processes described below using conductive material such as that<br>
used to construct the display backplane. With an RF power source, the actuating event is<br>
typically the action of bringing an RF transmitter (not shown) into sufficient proximity to<br>
RF antenna 310. A current is generated through the display when the antenna is<br>
inductively coupled to the transmitter with sufficient power. Because this power source<br>
provides an alternating current, a diode must be included in the display circuit to convert<br>
the current to direct current, which is required to activate the displays of the present<br>
invention. The diode can be provided through a traditional surface mount component or<br>
can be printed along with the other electrical components of the label. If the diode circuit<br>
is pre-produced on the desired label substrate in a pre-determined location, it may<br>
subsequently be finished through the printing process to add the other display<br>
components. Such a label provides an inexpensive way to display an otherwise invisible<br>
authentication marking.<br>
[0059] As shown in Figures 2C and 2D, in yet another embodiment of the invention the<br>
display is powered by an internal battery 310, so that an external power source is not<br>
required. As with the RF antenna 300, the battery 300 is electrically connected to<br>
electrodes 120 and 130. The internal battery 310 may be apre-made component that is<br>
encapsulated or entirely printed into the label structure as an integrated part of the label.<br>
Specifically, during the label construction, the anode and cathode of the battery are<br>
printed along with the desired display image. This process is described in more detail in<br>
U.S. Patent Application No. 11/209,345. The display is actuated by external stimuli,<br>
such as touch, or by internal stimuli, such as sensor 330. For example, a traditional<br>
membrane switch 320 or other means to turn the display on and off is provided and may<br>
be printed through known printing processes, as shown in Figure 2C. The switch 320 can<br>
be made permanent by providing a small conductive adhesive pad that permanently<br>
closes the switch when activated. Alternatively, an internal stimuli may actuate the<br>
display, such as sensor 330 that may be pre-made and incorporated into circuitiy layer<br>
220 during the printing process. The sensor 330 may be as simple as a component that<br>
closes a switch in response to an environmental condition being satisfied. For example,<br>
the sensor 330 may be an environmental sensor that measures temperature. Here, the<br>
-14-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
actuating event is the structure reaching a predetermined high or low temperature, in<br>
response to which the sensor completes the electrical connection between electrodes<br>
120/130 and the power source, battery 310. As a further alternative, the sensor 330 can<br>
be one that accumulates or integrates over time other variables to which it is sensitive.<br>
Then, the sensor may deliver an activation output from the battery 310 only after a period<br>
of time; such a circuit may sense a longer term temperature exposure rather than a single<br>
threshold event.<br>
[0060] The label structure of the present invention has numerous applications, each of<br>
which provides for activating the display material in response to an actuating event. In<br>
one example, a label structure is externally powered with a probe and the display material<br>
includes only a single pixel with planar electrodes and a graphic over-lay 250. In another<br>
example, a display includes a single pixel with planar electrodes and graphic overlay and<br>
the display material is RF-activated. In yet another example, a display label includes a<br>
multi-pixel display with co-planar electrodes, and the display material is battery-powered<br>
and actuated by closing a membrane switch. In still yet another example, a display label<br>
includes RFID and a display and is actuated by an RF transmitter.<br>
[0061] Timer<br>
[0062] The present invention may be configured to provide a label structure with an<br>
active display that indicates a time interval. Because the color change in the display<br>
material 110 is a function of several controllable variables, such as voltage, current, and<br>
display material volume, a desired configuration of power supply, circuitry, and display<br>
material may provide a label structure that communicates elapsed time.<br>
[0063] With reference to Figure 3A, a label structure 400 may be assembled to<br>
communicate elapsed time by forming anodic electrode 120 to include a series of printed<br>
resistors 410a-410e in circuitry layer 220. Cathodic electrode 130 is formed at the<br>
intersection of display material 110 and cover film 240. This arrangement provides for<br>
five planar pixels or pixel areas 420a-420e within the display material 110.<br>
-15-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
[0064] In the configuration shown in Fig. 3A, the power source is printed battery 310,<br>
such as a carbon zinc battery with a battery cathode connected to the common electrode<br>
130 and the battery anode connected to the anode 120, which includes separated printed<br>
resistors 410a-420e that connect to pixels 420a-420e respectively. Each of resistors<br>
410a-410e has a distinct resistance. Although a battery provides the power source in this<br>
example, other power sources described herein and known in the art may also be suitable<br>
for timer constructions in accordance with the present invention.<br>
[0065] In operation, responsive to an actuation event such as closing switch 320, the<br>
individual pixels 420a-420e are powered in parallel by the same power source 310. The<br>
current thereby supplied to each pixel 420 is greater for resistors 410 with lower<br>
resistance and lower for resistors 410 with greater resistance. Accordingly, because the<br>
development of color in each pixel 420 is a function of the current supplied that pixel, the<br>
resistance value of each resistor 420 may be specifically selected to correspond to the<br>
desired color development rate of the associated pixel. A static graphic in graphics layer<br>
250 may be printed proximate each pixel 420 to indicate the corresponding elapsed time.<br>
[0066] As shown in Figures 3 A and 4A, in one example of this embodiment, backplane<br>
circuitry 220 is printed with five separate resistors 410. The resistors 410 are produced<br>
using a carbon resist ink well known in the art. The spacing between the five anodes<br>
within anode 120 and the common cathode 130 is 1 mm and the power supply is a printed<br>
carbon zinc battery 310 providing a potential difference of 1.5 volts. Resistor 410a has<br>
zero resistance, printed resistor 410b has a resistance of 140 Kohms, printed resistor 410c<br>
has a resistance of 350 Kohms, resistor 410d has a resistance of 600 Kohms, and resistor<br>
410e has a resistance of 800 Kohms. Once actuated through switch 320, pixel 420a is<br>
activated in approximately one minute, which occurs when the color change of the<br>
display material 110 at pixel 420a becomes visible. Pixel 420b is activated in<br>
approximately three minutes, pixel 420c is activated in approximately five minutes, pixel<br>
420d is activated in approximately eight minutes, and pixel 420e is activated in<br>
approximately ten minutes.<br>

WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
[0067] Graphic ink layer 250 may include additional static information that provides<br>
context for the display 110, such as a time scale, time indicia, or other temporal visual<br>
image. For example, as shown in Figure 4A, which is a top view of the structure shown<br>
in Figure 3A, the graphic ink layer 250 includes the word "Minutes" and numbers<br>
corresponding to each pixel's 420 associated time. Graphic ink layer 250 also includes<br>
the word "Start" proximate switch 320, which actuates the timer. Numerous variations of<br>
this timer label are possible. For instance, with reference to Figure 4B, a one minute and<br>
five minute, two pixel label structure can be constructed using two of the previous<br>
resistors, resistor 410a and 410c. Figure 4B also includes a second switch 340, which is<br>
configured to clear the existing display pixels 420a and 420c to allow for a subsequent<br>
timer actuation with switch 320. With reference to Figure 4C, a single pixel, ten minute<br>
indicator may be constructed by printing only resistor 410e from the label structure<br>
described above. Alternatively the display material 110 volume, instead of or in<br>
combination with a resistor, may be used to achieve coloration of the pixel at the desired<br>
time.<br>
[0068] All or most of the components of the label structure 400 may be produced using<br>
the flexographic printing process, and one example print run is shown in Figures 5A-5J.<br>
In this example, the base substrate 210, shown in Figure 5A, is a pressure sensitive coated<br>
2 mil polyester film laminated to a silicone release liner. As shown in Figure 5B, the first<br>
print station prints cathode and anode current collectors 510 and 520 for the battery<br>
power source 310, as part of circuitry layer 220, onto base substrate 210. As shown in<br>
Figure 5C, the second print station applies the conductive silver circuit that forms the<br>
anode and cathode circuits 120/130, conductive traces 280/290, and the switch 320 layers<br>
to the base layer 210 as part of circuitry layer 220. An optional resistor 410 may also be<br>
printed along trace 290, as shown in Figure 5C. As shown in Figure 5D, the third print<br>
station prints a manganese dioxide cathode 530 over the cathode current collector 510.<br>
As shown in Figure 5E, the next print station applies a metallic zinc ink 540 over anode<br>
current collector 520. As shown in Figure 5F, the following print station applies the<br>
electro-active display material 110 to form at least one pixel area 420. As shown in<br>
Figure 5G, the next station applies the battery electrolyte 550 over both the cathode 530<br>
and the anode 540 to complete the battery power source 310. As shown in Figure 5H, the<br>
-17-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
next station prints a UV curable laminating adhesive 230, which provides a surround that<br>
encloses both the electro-active display area 110 and the battery area 310, and which may<br>
also cover the battery 310. As shown in Figure 51, the next station laminates the cover<br>
film 240 over the display material 110 and adhesive 230 to encapsulate the display.<br>
Cover film 240 includes a window of transparent material such that display 110 is visible<br>
therethrough.<br>
[0069] As shown in Figure 5J, the next station applies graphics layer 250, which may be<br>
pre-printed with both the label graphics as well as a shorting pad for switch 320. The<br>
pre-printed web of graphics layer 250 is laminated to the cover film 240 using common<br>
laminating techniques well known in the art. Upon lamination, the laminating adhesive is<br>
cured with UV energy to seal the entire structure. Those skilled in the art will recognize<br>
the desired web path to achieve the above label construction.<br>
[0070] The web produced above can be finished into the final desired construction using<br>
label finishing techniques such as die cutting with matrix stripping to achieve singulated<br>
labels. The product can be serialized by the use of ink jet, laser printing or thermal<br>
transfer of serial numbers to each individual label.<br>
[0071] In yet another embodiment, the timer construction shown in Figures 3B and 4F<br>
provides for a development of color in display material 110 at a fixed resistance and<br>
voltage. Cathodic electrode 130 is arranged askew relative to anodic electrode 120, such<br>
that the display material 110 will image sooner at points where the electrodes are closer<br>
and later at points where the electrodes are further apart. The display material 110<br>
images along the electrodes substantially linearly with respect to time. As shown in<br>
Figure 4F, by providing visual time or color references in graphics layer 250, the elapsed<br>
time is determined by comparing the progression of imaged display material 110 or the<br>
color visibly developed in the display material 110 against the visual reference. By<br>
changing the resistance of resistor 410 in anodic electrode 120, a change in the time scale<br>
is achieved, which allows timers with various ranges to be produced from the same basic<br>
design and materials.<br>

[0072] Variable Instructions and Other Applications<br>
[0073] In still another embodiment, the present invention makes possible a new way of<br>
presenting use instructions. For some medicines or nutriceuticals, the recommended dose<br>
or amount to be consumed is variable depending on age or weight or other patent<br>
dimensions. A conventional way to present this information is in the form of a table or<br>
verbal description printed on an instruction sheet. If the table is complex, this can be<br>
difficult to understand and may be too large to present on a small container, at least in<br>
print fonts of reasonable size.<br>
[0074] In Figure 6 is shown a label configuration in which the user can select a button<br>
switch 320 for one of several weight ranges. By closing the switch, the user completes a<br>
circuit for a particular configuration of a segmented display 420, which identifies the<br>
dose or amount to be consumed, e.g., "1.5 TSP" or "0.5 oz." Each switch may be<br>
electrically connected to complete a separate circuit corresponding to unique deposits of<br>
display material. Alternatively, each switch may be electrically configured to logic<br>
components arranged to display different information on the same display material<br>
depending on the selected switch.<br>
[0075] In another embodiment of the present invention, a holographic product<br>
authentication label can be produced that provides the user with an active mark when<br>
activated through an external power source. In this example, a co-planar geometry is<br>
employed with a conductive ITO sputtered front plane and patterned backplane which<br>
form the image. In this particular example, an embossed polyester film is sputtered with<br>
ITO to achieve a holographic effect on the surface of the display. When the display is<br>
inactive, the label appears to have a traditional hologram on the surface, which is formed<br>
in graphics layer 250. When the display is activated, the hologram is altered with either a<br>
discreet image or the entire hologram can change color.<br>
[0076] The display is activated by providing an external probe which provides at least<br>
1.5 V to the display. The use of the probe eliminates the need for an internal power source<br>
and allows the hologram to be "activated" using a special probe to increase the security<br>
of the device. A further dimension of security may be added by use of the timing<br>
-19-<br><br>
WO 2006/110622	PCT/US2006/013236<br>
structures discussed above, such that the hologram is altered only after a specified lapse<br>
of time.<br>
[0077] In another embodiment of the present invention, the timer label described above is<br>
both powered and activated through the use of RF energy. In this example, a RF antenna<br>
is included in the conductive circuit. The antenna couples with a reader which provides<br>
the power for the timer circuit. Since the label is inactive until power is provided, moving<br>
the label within the reader range activates the timer thereby functioning as the switch as<br>
well. Radio frequency readers typically operate at 13.56 Mhz although other frequencies<br>
are employed as well. The energy inductively coupled is in the form of Alternating<br>
Current therefore a diode is included to convert the power to Direct Current to power the<br>
display. Therefore the timer is active whenever the antenna is coupled to the reader.<br>
[0078] In another embodiment of the present invention, a holographic display suitable for<br>
product authentication is produced, which is both powered and activated through the use<br>
of RF energy. In this example, the label has the appearance of a traditional hologram until<br>
it passes through a reader field where the display activates, providing an active hologram.<br>
[0079] The label construction may also be configured with variations of the<br>
aforementioned arrangements. For example, Figures 4D and 4E show label constructions<br>
that include two sensors 330/360, where the sensors are configured to complete the<br>
electrical connection between electrodes 120/130 and battery 310 responsive to a desired<br>
environmental condition being satisfied, such as temperature. Sensor 330 is configured<br>
to actuate a display pixel 420 if a predetermined low temperature is sensed and sensor<br>
360 is configured to actuate a different display pixel 420 if a predetermined high<br>
temperature is sensed. The label construction shown in Figure 4E further includes two<br>
switches 320/340 for providing a secondary actuator for each pixel 420.<br>
[0080] Conclusion<br>
The above examples illustrate the range and flexibility of the printed structure of the<br>
present invention. In particular, the present invention may be used to produce efficiently<br>
an active display in label and non-label constructions that provide specified electronic<br>

functionality of a variety uses. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other<br>
components and configurations can be practiced and are within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
