Examples of compounds of formula (18) are substituted succinic anhydrides, glutaric anhydride, substituted glutaric anhydrides, polymeric anhydrides of higher dibasic acids, maleic anhydride, or substituted maleic anhydride.<br>
For example, the acylation reaction of step a is catalyzed by a Lewis acid, such as AICI3, in an anhydrous aprotic solvent such as carbon disulfide, tetrachloethane, methylene chloride, nitrobenzene, or a mixture of anhydrous aprotic solvents. The reaction is typically carried out for a period of about 1 to about 18 hours, with about 12 to about 18 hours being preferred, at a temperature of about 0°C to about the reflux temperature of the solvent utilized, with about 0°C to about 25°C being preferred.<br>
