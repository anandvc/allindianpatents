SELECTION OF ACCESS POINT IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention [0001] The invention relates generally to the selection of an access point in a wireless communication system providing data services to user-operated terminals. The selection mechanism of the invention can be utilized by a mobile terminal both when joining the network and later, when roaming in the network. The mechanism of the invention therefore also supports mobility in a wireless communication system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] The current development towards truly mobile computing and networking has brought on the evolvement of various access technologies that also provide the users with access to the Internet when they are outside their own home network. At present, wireless Internet access is typically based on either wireless LAN (WLAN) technology or mobile networks, or both.<br>
[0003] Wireless LAN systems are typically extensions of a wired network, providing mobile users with wireless access to the wired network. In wireless LAN technology, two basic network topologies are available for network configuration: an ad-hoc network and an infrastructure network. An ad-hoc network is formed by two or more independent mobile terminals without the services of a base station, i.e. in an ad-hoc network the terminals communicate on a peer~to~peer basis. An ad-hoc network is normally formed for temporary purposes. The infrastructure network, in turn, comprises one or more wireless base stations, called access points, which form part of the wired infrastructure. In this type of network, all traffic goes through the access points, regardless of whether the traffic is between two terminals or a terminal and the wired network, i.e. the mobile terminals do not communicate on a peer-to-peer basis. The mobile terminals are provided with wireless LAN cards, whereby they can access the wired network, such as the Internet, through said access points, which are mainly located in various hot spots, such as airports, convention centers, railway stations, or shopping malls.<br><br>
[0004] In order to be able to deliver messages, a mobile terminal must first join the network. In this process, which is commonly termed association, the mobile station associates with one of the access points in its neighborhood. At any given instant, a particular access point, i.e. the one with which the terminal is associated, acts as the serving access point for the mobile terminal.<br>
[0005] In the following, typical current implementations of the association procedure are discussed briefly. In the simplest embodiment, the terminal selects the first access point it detects. When the terminal is turned on, it starts to scan the channels available in the geographical area in question and selects the first access point it receives. In a more sophisticated approach, the selection is based on the information obtained from the transmissions of a plurality of access points. The terminal utilizes either active or passive scanning in order to detect the access points in the region. In active scanning, the terminal sends a message called a Probe on each channel. When an access point receives a Probe message, it returns a Probe Response to the terminal. In passive scanning, the terminal finds the network simply by listening for the beacon messages, which are periodically broadcast by each access point. Utilizing the above-described active or passive scanning, the terminal scans the channels and examines the information transmitted in the beacon frames or in the Probe Response frames, which contain information about the properties of the access point, such as parameters indicating the security functions of the access point. The terminal determines and stores a parameter termed a RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) which indicates the received signal level on the link to the access point. Having finished the scanning process, the terminal selects the access point with the maximum RSSI, provided that the access point fulfills other requirements set by the terminal. In other words, the terminal assumes that as long as the characteristics of the access point are suitable for the terminal, the access point with the best RSSI provides the best quality of service.<br>
[0006] Another important attribute of the WLAN networks is the overlapping of the coverage areas, i.e. cells, of the neighboring access points, since the overlap enables seamless roaming between the cells. When a mobile user with a terminal moves beyond the coverage area of the currently serving access point, the terminal must associate itself with a new access point. This<br><br>
process of transferring an established association from one access point to another is commonly termed re-association.<br>
[0007] However, the assumption that the access point with the maximum RSSi provides the best quality of service may lead to a situation where an overwhelming majority of the mobile terminals is associated with a few access points, while some of the access points are substantially idle.<br>
[0008] Therefore, load sharing mechanisms have been developed, which result in a more uniform load distribution between the access points, i.e. in a more even distribution of the terminals between all access points. Load sharing mechanisms are based on load information sent by the access points in the beacon or Probe Response frames, the load information indicating the current load of the access point. The load information typically indicates the number of terminals currently associated with the access point. The load information is useful, especially in areas where the cells overlap or in congested areas requiring a multi-cell structure, i.e. where several access points cover essentially the same area.<br>
[0009] The above-mentioned use of load information is disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,469,991, for example. This document discloses a wireless communication system in which the beacon message that is broadcast from an access point includes information about the capabilities of the access point, and possibly also load metric information, which generally contains the number of mobile terminals associated with the access point. Based on the information in the beacon message, the wireless terminal chooses the access point with which it wants to associate.<br>
[0010] It is further known to transmit various connection attributes from the access points, the selection of the access point being based on the said attributes. International patent application WO01/63842 discloses a method in which the connection is kept in the same network as long as possible. The terminal receives the said attributes from several networks and selects two i access points: a first access point, which has the best connection attributes in the network that is the network of the currently serving access point and a second access point, which has the best connection attributes in another network than the network of the currently serving access point. The terminal compares one or more connection attributes of the first and second access<br><br>
points and then re-associates with the second access point if the difference between the connection attributes of the two access points fulfills predetermined criteria. In this way, the connection can be kept in the serving network as long as possible.<br>
[0011] However, this method is for roaming use only, as it requires that the terminal already has a serving access point before the method can be initiated.<br>
[0012] Generally, a major drawback relating to the above-described known methods for joining the network and re-associating with an access point is that the decision on the correct access point can only be made on the basis of the fixed capabilities and the current load of the access points available for the mobile terminal. Therefore, a number of factors possibly affecting the quality of service within the area of the cell cannot be taken into account when selecting the access point. One such factor is the interference caused by external sources. Possible interference sources in a WLAN environment are Bluetooth devices, for example, which operate on the same frequency band (2.4 GHz) as many WLAN systems, and also other WLAN systems operating independently in the neighborhood. The interference level may also rise if the internal channel separation in the WLAN system is smaller than the optimum 25 MHz.<br>
[0013] Furthermore, since the present WLAN networks rely on absolute values of the attributes, such as the load of the access point or the signal level of the serving link, short-term deviations from the overall level of service in the cell may cause undesirable association or re-association decisions. For example, a short-term silent period on a channel or a short-term drop in the load level of the access point may cause such decisions.<br>
[0014] The objective of the present invention is to alleviate or eliminate the above-mentioned drawbacks.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0015] The objective of the invention is to devise a new mechanism for selection of an access point in a wireless communication system, allowing the mobile terminal to take into account the prevailing conditions within the entire cell more effectively than before.<br><br>
[0016] In the present invention, a group of mobile terminals in a cell utilize predetermined attributes which give an indication of the quality of service (QoS) currently experienced by the terminal, by collecting a set of such attributes and sending the set to the serving access point The serving access point processes the attribute sets received from the mobile terminals and compiles a cell report on the basis of the sets. The cell report indicates the current overall quality of service in the cell. For this reason, the cell report is also called a sen/ice report in this context.<br>
[0017] The service report is then transmitted so that each mobile terminal in the neighborhood, which is about to select an access point, may receive it. As the neighboring access points send their service reports, these terminals typically receive service reports from several access points. Each of these terminals examines the service report of at least one access point and, based on the examination, selects the access point to which a wireless link is to be established. The examination of the report(s) prevents the terminal from making an incorrect decision.<br>
[0018] Thus one aspect of the invention is the provision of a method for selecting an access point in a wireless communication system comprising mobile terminals and access points, each access point being capable of serving the mobile terminals within a service area of the access point, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
-	sending at least one set of attributes from a first group of mobile terminals to the access point currently serving said group of mobile terminals, each of said mobile terminals sending a set that contains at least one attribute indicating the quality of a wireless link between the serving access point and the mobile terminal;<br>
-	based on the sets, forming a service report describing current service conditions in the service area of the access point;<br>
-	transmitting the service report to a second group of mobile terminals;<br>
-	in a mobile terminal belonging to said second group, examining at least one service report received; and<br>
-	in response to the examining step, selecting the access point to<br>
which a wireless link is to be established from said mobile terminal.<br>
[0019] in one embodiment of the invention, the attributes that form the set are<br><br>
existing attributes retrieved from the management information base within the MAC layer of the mobile terminal.<br>
[0020] In a further aspect the invention provides a wireless communication system comprising mobile terminals and access points, each access point being capable of serving the mobile terminals within a service area of the access point, the system comprising:<br>
-	reception means for receiving at least one set of attributes from a first group of mobile terminals, at least one of the attributes to indicate the quality of a wireless link between a particular mobile station and the access point serving said mobile station;<br>
-	processing means for forming, based on the sets, a service report describing current service conditions in the service area of the access point;<br>
-	transmission means for transmitting the service report to a second group of mobile terminals; and<br>
-	in each of the mobile terminals in said second group, (a)<br>
examination means for examining a service report received and (b) selection<br>
means, responsive to the examination means, for selecting the access point<br>
with which a wireless link is to be established.<br>
[0021] In another aspect the invention provides an access point for a wireless communication system, the access point comprfsing:<br>
-	interface means for connecting the access point to a distribution system;<br>
-	a transceiver for communicating wirelessly with mobile terminals located within a service area of the access point, said transceiver being adapted to receive sets of attributes from the mobile terminals, at least one of the attributes to indicate the quality of a wireless link between the serving access point and the respective mobile terminal;<br>
-	processing means for forming, based on the sets, a service report describing current service conditions in the service area of the access point;<br>
wherein the transceiver is further adapted to transmit the service report to at least one mobile terminal.<br>
[0022] In a still further aspect the invention provides a mobile terminal for a wireless communication system/the mobile terminal comprising:<br>
-	a transceiver for communicating with an access point of the wireless<br><br>
communication system via a wireless link;<br>
-	memory means for storing attributes relating to said link;<br>
-	collection means for collecting service reports from available access points, each service report describing current service conditions within a service area of a particular access point;<br>
-	examination means for examining the service report received by the mobile terminal;<br>
-	selection means, responsive to the examination means, for selecting the access point; and<br>
-	access means for establishing a wireless link with the access point selected. -<br>
[0023] The selection of the access point may be made when joining the network, as the other terminals already joined to the network have provided the access point with the attribute sets. The selection may be also be made in connection with roaming, whereby the terminal may itself have transmitted sets to the serving access point. However, a terminal making a re-association decision may be another terminal than those providing the access point with the attribute sets. In one embodiment of the invention, the reporting terminals are laptop computers, which have a higher battery capacity than smaller terminals, such as intelligent phones.<br>
[0024] The mechanism of the invention adds intelligence to the selection process. Therefore, the terminals are capable of avoiding cells where one or more factors, such as an external interference source, degrades the quality of service.<br>
[0025] Furthermore, short-term deviations from a more stable long-term situation of the cell can no longer cause erroneous association or re-association decisions as easily as before.<br>
[0026] In one embodiment of the invention, the access point divides the . reporting terminals into different categories with respect to a predetermined attribute, and forms a service report that describes current service conditions within the cell regarding each of the categories. The mobile terminal defines its category with respect to each service report it receives and examines a particular report with regard to the category defined for that report. In this way, only the information that is the most appropriate can be taken as the basis for<br><br>
the selection of the access point.<br>
[0027] Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent through reference to the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.<br>

Detailed Description of the invention<br>
[0040] As mentioned above, the system of the invention is preferably based on the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless local area networking. Furthermore, the wireless network according to the invention operates in the infrastructure mode, i.e. it comprises base stations which forward service requests from the mobile terminals to the fixed network and transfer the services provided by the fixed network to the mobile terminals. The base stations are commonly termed access points.<br>
[0041] FIG. 1 illustrates a typical communication system according to the invention. The system includes one or more WLAN networks, each connected by means of a gateway GW (a router) to another network, such as the Internet, which contains service providers SP. As indicated above, each WLAN network comprises one or more access points, each communicating wirelessly with the terminals within the coverage area, i.e. the cell, of the access point and thus forming a bridge between the terminals and the wired network. In this context, the coverage area is also called the service area.<br>
[0042] It is assumed here that the WLAN network 100 shown in the figure comprises four access points AP1 to AP4. In this type of network (i.e. in an infrastructure network) an access point and at least one terminal is said to form a Basic Serving Set (BSS). A series of BSSs then forms an Extended Service Set (ESS). These BSSs are connected to each othe'r by a Distribution System (DS), which can be a wired network, such as an Ethernet LANT within which TCP/IP packets are transmitted, or a wireless network., or a combination of these two. As the invention does not relate to the architecture of the Distribution System, it is not discussed in more detail here.<br>
[0043] Users moving in the area of the WLAN network may use portable computers, PDA equipment, intelligent phones or other such mobile terminals WIT. In the same way as an ordinary GSM telephone, the terminals can be made up of two parts: the actual subscriber device, e.g. a portable computer (with software), and a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module), whereby from the viewpoint of the network the subscriber device becomes a functioning terminal only when the SIM has been inserted into it. The SIM may be the subscriber<br><br>
identity, module for use in the GSM network or in the UMTS, for example. In the latter case it is termed the USIM (Universal Services Identity Module). However, the terminals may equally well be traditional WLAN terminals in which no SIM is used.<br>
[0044] The system further typically contains an authentication server AS of the WLAN network. The authentication server is connected to the above-mentioned gateway through a secured connection, which is typically a TCP/IP connection established through an operator network or through the Internet.<br>
[0045] Since the present invention concerns the cooperation of the mobile terminals and the access points, the structure of the system is not discussed any further. As is known, the IEEE standard 802.11 defines the physical layer options and the MAC (Media Access Control) layer protocol for the wireless LAN. Since the system of the present invention is compatible with these definitions, they are not discussed in more detail here. An interested reader may find a lot of literature describing the overall structure and function of a WLAN network. Reference is also made to the above-mentioned WO-publication WO01/63842, which contains a brief description of a WLAN network according to the IEEE 802.11 standard.<br>
[0046] In the present invention, the properties of the MAC layer are utilized in a new way. FIG. 2a illustrates the protocol architecture of the IEEE 802.11 standard. As shown in the figure, the actual media access control (MAC) protocol operates in the lower sub-layer of the second layer of the OSI layer model, which is the Data Link Layer (DLL). The MAC management layer supports the association and roaming functionalities and it further controls the authentication and encryption mechanisms, synchronization of the terminals and power saving functions, for example. The MAC management layer further maintains a MAC layer management database, i.e. the MIB (Management Information Base) of the MAC layer. The MAC layer cooperates with the physical management layer to maintain the database. In the present invention, the content of this database is utilized to provide the terminals with an intelligent mechanism for selecting an access point during the joining or re-association process.<br>
[0047] The MAC layer MIB includes various parameters or attributes that are utilized in the present invention. In other words, the present invention utilizes existing attributes of the MAC layer MIB, which the MAC layer protocol also<br><br>
utilizes. These attributes give an indication of the quality of the link between the access point and the mobile terminal. Examples of the MAC layer attributes that can be utilized in the present invention are:<br>
[0048] - RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), which indicates the level of the received signal.<br>
[0049] - NF (Noise Floor), which indicates the interference level on the link.<br>
[0050] - TxRetry and RxRetry, which indicate the amount of re-transmissions and re-receptions, respectively, performed on the link. TxRetry from the point of view of the terminal corresponds to the TxRetry from the point of view of the access point.<br>
[0051] - DR (Data Rate), which indicates the degree of throughput on the link.<br>
[0052] - ACK (Acknowledgment). An acknowledgement is sent when a packet is transmitted successfully.<br>
[0053] - ARQ (Automatic repeat request). An automatic repeat request is sent when a packet is lost.<br>
[0054] - Back-off window, which indicates the amount of time that the terminal waits for its turn to access the media.<br>
[0055] Further attributes which can be utilized are:<br>
[0056] - CCA (Clear Channel Assessment) which indicates when the media is busy or free.<br>
[0057] - RATE, which indicates the basic rates at which the terminal transmits. If the lower basic rates are used frequently, it indicates that the quality of the link has dropped (due to a long link span or due to interferences).<br>
[0058] In the present invention, a mobile terminal associated with an access point retrieves selected attributes from its MAC layer MIB and forms a set of the attributes. The set may be in the form of a list or table, for example. The terminal stores the set and further forwards it to the serving access point. The desired attributes can be retrieved by means of normal get commands used to retrieve information from the MIB.<br>
[0059] In one embodiment of the invention, the MIB attributes are used as such, which requires minimum changes in the terminal. In this case, the mobile terminal only has to retrieve from the MIB the attributes to be utilized and form the set to be transmitted. However, it is also possible that the terminal<br><br>
processes at least some of the attributes. The terminal may, for example, examine selected attributes periodically and produce a new variable from each attribute, such as the average of an attribute.<br>
[0060] The mobile terminal may send the attribute set periodically or upon a request received from the access point, or both. FIG. 2b illustrates the operation of a reporting terminal in the case where the serving access point polls the terminals for the sets. In this case, the terminal monitors for a request sent by the serving access point (step 200) and generates (or updates) and sends the set only when a request to send the set is received from the serving access point (steps 201 to 203). However, the terminal may also send the attribute set without a request from the access point. This kind of embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 2c. As shown in the figure, the attribute set may be sent in response to a specified event, such as a sudden change in one or more of the attributes, for example (cf. step 210). The terminal may also collect and process the attributes in advance, prior to the sending of the set, i.e. steps 201 and/or 202 in FIG. 2b and steps 211 and/or 212 in FIG. 2c may be performed in advance in the background.<br>
[0061] FIG. 3 illustrates the basic operations according to the invention by showing one terminal WIT1 and the access point AP1 serving it. The mobile terminal generates the above-described set (step 300), stores it, and sends a copy of the set to the serving access point (step 301). A plurality of other terminals associated with access point AP1 send similar sets. In other words, the mobile terminal shown in the figure belongs to a group TG of reporting terminals associated with access point API Access point AP1 therefore receives a similar set from a plurality of mobile terminals (cf. step 302). As is obvious, a similar set here refers to a set with the same attributes, but indicating terminal-specific attribute values. The sets can be transmitted in management frames, for example.<br>
[0062] Although all terminals can act as reporting terminals, in one embodiment of the invention the terminals of a certain type form the group TG of reporting terminals. In this way this task can be given to terminals that have good performance in terms of battery power, such as laptops. However, even if the sets were sent only by certain terminals only, all terminals can utilize the results, as discussed below.<br>
[0063] On the basis of the attribute sets received, the access point AP1<br><br>
generates a cell or service report indicating the current service conditions in its cell (step 303). This typically involves calculation of various statistical values of said attributes, such as the average of each attribute received in the sets. Instead of an average, the access point may also determine the attribute values below which a certain proportion, such as half, of the reporting terminals are at the moment For example, regarding the RSSI, the access point may calculate the average of the RSSIs of all reporting terminals or the RSSI value above which the current RSSI values of a certain proportion of the reporting terminals are. Different attributes may be subject to different type of calculations.<br>
[0064] In one embodiment of the invention, the access point further monitors its own load level and determines an average load level over a predetermined period, such as over the last 5 minutes.<br>
[0065] The access point then compiles a service report, which includes at least some of the calculated variables. This service report preferably includes the calculated average load level and possibly also the instantaneous load level of the access point.<br>
[0066] The service report is then transmitted (step 304) to at least one mobile terminal. The transmission can be a unicast transmission (such as a Probe Response), a broadcast transmission (in the beacon frame) or a multicast transmission. Moreover, as the neighboring access points also receive attribute sets from the terminals within their respective cell areas and as they send similar service reports (cf. step 305), an individual terminal, such as terminal MT1 shown in the figure, can typically receive service reports from a plurality of access points.<br>
[0067] The above-described process is utilized when a mobile terminal joins the network. The terminal that enters the network or that is turned on in the network utilizes the service reports and selects the access point with the help of the service reports received. FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating the selection of an access point when a mobile terminal joins a network. When a mobile terminal enters a network or is turned on in the network, it starts to scan through the channels, using the above-described scanning methods, for example (step 400). In this way, the terminal receives the service reports from each of the access points available at the current location of the terminal. The terminal forms a set of the available access points and their respective<br><br>
attributes (step 401) and starts the process of selecting the best available access point<br>
[0068] It is assumed here that this selection process uses a key figure on which the selection is based. As discussed below, the key figure may simply be one of the attributes, which is chosen as the primary attribute. In this example, the RSSI related to each access point link is chosen as the key figure/primary attribute, since the RSSI indicates which one of the access points is the best one, assuming that other factors affecting the quality of the service are substantially equal with respect to each of the access points. The terminal first examines the access point with the best RSSI value (step 402), i.e. the terminal starts the selection from the access point that hypothetical^ is the best one. However, the terminal then uses the information received in the service reports to verify whether this is the case. If the RSSI is not taken into account, the information received in the service reports indicates the general performance and interference levels in the neighborhood of the mobile terminal. This information is then used to verify whether the access point with the best RSSI can be selected. Each of the attributes is typically given a certain range indicating the values that are acceptable for the particular attribute. The terminal checks each attribute by comparing its value with the accepted values (step 403). If all attributes contained in the cell report are acceptable, the terminal associates with the access point in question (step 404). If the terminal notices that at least one of the attributes in the cell report is not acceptable, it starts to examine the service report of the access point with the next best RSSI (steps 406 and 403). In this way the terminal continues the examining of the access points in the order indicated by the RSSI value until an acceptable access point is found. If all the service reports received contain one or more unacceptable attributes, the terminal may continue scanning or may notify the user of the situation (step 407) and wait for user input. Depending on the selection by the user, the terminal may then continue scanning, stop searching for an access point without joining the network, or select the best access point available even though at least one of the attributes in the corresponding service report is not acceptable.<br>
[0069] The above-described process can also be utilized in connection with roaming. In other words, when the terminal moves in the network, it can re-associate with an access point that is selected by means of the service reports in the above-described manner.<br><br>
[0070] In one embodiment of the invention the reporting terminals within the service area of an access point are divided into different categories according to the RSSI value related to the respective access point link. FIGS. 4b and 4c illustrate this division, assuming that 6 different categories are used. As is shown in FIG. 4b, the first RSSI category covers RSSI values that are equal to or greater than A, the second RSSI category covers RSSI values that are smaller than A but equal to or greater than B (B<a the third rssi category covers values that are smaller than b but equal to or greater c etc. value range is thus divided into consecutive sub-ranges. sub-range which of experienced by mobile terminal falls determines with regard respective access point.></a>
[0071] In an ideal environment the terminals are thus located as shown in FIG. 4c with regard to the serving access point: the terminals belonging to category 1 are within circle 1, the terminals belonging to category 2 are within ring 2, the terminals belonging to category 3 are within ring 3, etc.<br>
[0072] The RSSI value of the attribute set sent to the serving access point thus indicates the category of the corresponding mobile terminal. Based on the categories of the reporting terminals, the serving access point generates a service report that includes category-specific values for an individual variable to be inserted in the service report, each category-specific value being calculated based on the respective attribute values received from the terminals belonging to the same category. For example, when an average of an attribute is to be inserted in the service report, the access point calculates an average for each category i (i=1, 2, 3, ...), the average being calculated based on the attribute values received from terminals belonging to category i. When selecting an access point, a terminal then takes into account only the values of the categories to which it belongs. For example, if the terminal belongs to category 5 with respect to the serving access point, to category 6 with respect to a first neighboring access point, and to category 7 with respect to a second neighboring access point, the terminal determines a key figure based on the category 5 specific service report from the serving access point, a key figure based on the category 6 specific service report from the first neighboring access point, and a key figure based on the category 7 specific service report from the second neighboring access point. In this way, only the most appropriate information, i.e. the information originating from those reporting<br><br>
terminals, which are in a position comparable to that of the selecting terminal, is taken into account when selecting the access point In other words, the terminals that are in clearly different positions within the cell than the selecting terminal, cannot distort the information on which the selection is based. For example, the mobile terminals that are very close to the access point do not distort the information that forms the basis for the selection made by a remotely located mobile terminal.<br>
[0073] Although the division is in the above example based on the RSSI values, a similar attribute that indicates the quality of the link to the access point or the level of the received signal can be used.<br>
[0074] In another embodiment of the invention, the scanning cycle (i.e. the interval between two consecutive selection processes) is dependent on the category of the terminal with respect to the serving access point so that the larger the category the shorter the scanning cycle. Thus, the farther away the terminal is from the serving access point, the greater the scanning rate. FIG. 4d illustrates an embodiment in which the scanning rate increases exponentially when the category changes upwards. In this way, the power consumption of the mobile terminals that have a good quality link can further be reduced, and the mobile terminals that have a poorer link to the serving access point have more frequently a chance to select a better access point.<br>
[0075] However, in order to save the batteries of the terminals that do not move, the scanning cycle can be made longer if the category of the terminal does not change for a certain period of time. FIG. 4e is a flow diagram illustrating the operation of a terminal in an embodiment like this. First, a parameter N is given the value zero (step 420) before the RSSI category is defined for the first time at step 421. Based on the category defined, the scanning cycle is then determined and set (step 422), and a timer is set (step 423). When the timer expires, the category is defined again (step 425). The terminal then examines at step 426, whether the category has changed. If so, the parameter N is reset to zero and the scanning cycle is updated to match the scanning cycle of the new category. If the category number increased (i.e. the terminal apparently moved farther away from the access point), the scanning cycle is shortened (i.e. the scanning rate is increased) to match the scanning cycle.of the new category (step 430). If the category changed downwards (i.e. the terminal apparently moved closer to the access point), the scanning cycle is lengthened (i.e. the scanning rate is decreased) to match the<br><br>
new category (step 432). When the scanning cycle has been updated, the process jumps to step 423 to set the timer and to determine the RSSI category again upon the expiration of the timer.<br>
[0076] If it is detected at step 426 that the RSSI category has not changed, the parameter N is incremented by one (step 428) after which the process examines whether the value of the parameter is greater than K, where K is a small integer, for example 1, 2, or 3. If this is the case, the scanning cycle is increased, since in this case the RSSI category has been checked at least K+1 consecutive times without the category being changed. If the value of N is not greater than K, the process jumps to step 423 to set the timer and to determine the RSSI category again upon the expiration of the timer.<br>
[0077] There is typically an upper limit for the scanning cycle that can be set at step 433. This may be implemented for example so that the scanning cycle is not increased any more when N reaches a certain upper threshold M. The amount by which the scanning cycle is increased at step 433 may depend on the value of N.<br>
[0078] FIG. 5 illustrates the terminal elements in view of the invention. The mobile terminal MT comprises a transceiver Tx/Rx provided with at least one antenna, a control unit CPU, user interface means Ul for creating a user interface, and memory means MEM, which may include one or more smart cards SC, such as a SIM card. However, as discussed above, a SIM card is not included in a traditional WLAN terminal.<br>
[0079] The MIB attributes and the service reports are stored in the memory MEM of the terminal and the control unit performs the basic functions described above, i.e. the control unit retrieves the information from the memory, compiles the attribute set if the terminal is a reporting terminal, stores the service reports, and performs the selection of the access point. With the user interface means the control unit may inform the user of various events, if so desired. The control unit further controls the transceiver for scanning the channels and for establishing a connection to an access point<br>
[0080] FIG. 6 illustrates the elements of the access point The access point comprises a transceiver unit 600, a control unit 601, memory means 602, user interface means 603, and a LAN interface for connecting the access point to the distribution system. As discussed above, this interface may be wireless, although it is at present typically a wired one. The MIB attributes, the attribute<br><br>
sets received, and the service reports are stored in the memory means 602. The control unit performs the basic functions described above, i.e. the control unit processes the attribute sets received and generates the service reports. The control unit further monitors the load level of the access point and calculates the load attributes, such as the average load. The access point may be configured through the user interface means.<br>
[0081] The service report may be generated in various ways, i.e. various statistical values based on the attribute sets can be determined. As the . algorithm used in the terminal depends on the content of the service report, the algorithm may vary accordingly. Attribute values received from the terminals may also be used as such for the service reports. For example, the highest and/or lowest value of a certain attribute may be inserted in the service report.<br>
[0082] The selection of the access point by using the service reports may also be based on another primary attribute than the RSSI, such as the average load of the access point. Furthermore, a combination of service report attributes may be used to determine the order in which the access points are examined. In this connection, a key figure can be calculated or determined on the basis of the service report attributes used for each access point. Each attribute can be given a different weight for the calculation of the key figure. The key figures calculated may also directly determine the access point, whereby the validity of each service report attribute is not checked separately or only the critical attributes are checked. If the critical attributes are acceptable, the access point with the best key figure is selected. As discussed above, one of the attributes, such as the RSSI, may also form the key figure.<br>
[0083] As indicated above, certain types of terminals can provide the access points with the information necessary for the functionality according to the invention. The terminals can be given an identifier, such as a bit value, which indicates whether the terminal belongs to the group of reporting terminals. In this way, the access point knows that certain mobile terminals do not send the attribute sets, in other words, the terminal can reject a report request without causing an error situation. Such terminals can be intelligent phones, which have a lower battery capacity than laptop computers. For example, if the access point broadcasts a report request requesting the terminals to send their sets, the access point knows that a terminal returning a message with a certain bit value does not belong to the group.<br><br>
[0084] If only some of the terminals act as the reporting terminals, all the terminals are not necessarily provided with the same functionalities. However, all the terminals according to the invention are provided with the functionalities for utilizing the service reports in the selection of the access point.<br>
[0085] It was assumed in the above examples that all the available access points belong to the same sub-network (i.e. that the ESS identifier of the access points is the same). However, the mechanisms of the invention may equally well be used in an environment where the access points belong to different sub-networks. In this case the selection process may take the network into account, by favoring the access points in the currently serving network, for example.<br>
[0086] An access point capable of operating according to at least two different WLAN standards or modes may indicate on one band that another band is also available. The attribute lists can be received and service reports sent on several or all frequency bands concerned and/or for the desired operating mode(s) of the access point. A terminal capable of using several bands/modes may scan one band while using another band. It is even possible that the access point indicates preferred modes/bands in the service report. This indication may simply be a bit string that the terminal is able to take into account. A terminal capable of using several bands/modes may thus select the access point based on the service reports of more than one band/mode. In the selection process, the access point can be given a certain additional weight depending on the value of the bit string. Alternatively, if the terminal notices that several access points in the neighborhood prefer the same band/mode, the terminal can make the selection based on the sen/ice reports relating to this band/mode only. If the category-based embodiment is utilized, it is also possible to send a sen/ice report for each category, instead of sending category-specific values in one service report.<br>
[0087] Furthermore, various scanning mechanisms can be used for obtaining the service reports. The channels of the neighboring access points can be stored at each access point, which may then inform the said channels in the beacon frame or in the Probe Request In this way the terminals can be notified of the channels to be scanned, whereby the .scanning and selection processes can be accelerated, and the power consumption of the terminals reduced. Based on the reports received on different channels, the mobile<br><br>
terminal may further limit the number of channels to be scanned. The mobile terminal may, for example, notice that due to its movement only a few of the channels are actually such that the performance provided on the channels is comparable to the performance provided by the serving access point, and consequently limit the selection process to these channels.<br>
[0088] The access points may also exchange their service reports through the Distribution System, whereby one access point can utilize the service reports of the neighboring access points and add various information about one or more other access points in its service report. In this way, the service reports can carry various priority orders, for example, in order to further accelerate the selection process.<br>
[0089] Although the invention was described above with reference to the examples shown in the appended drawings, it is obvious that the invention is not limited to these, but may be modified by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, the invention is not restricted to WLAN networks according to the IEEE 802.11 standard only, but can be used in connection with other wireless systems, such as systems based on the BRAN (Broadband Radio Access Networks) standard.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
