				<td>The present invention relates to a dispersion-flattened optical fiber.<br>
The present invention relates to a dispersion-flattened optical fiber suitable for a communication system using an optical fiber network.<br>
Background Art<br>
Communication systems constituted by optical fiber networks are capable of long-haul and high-capacity communications, and their capacity has further been increased by time-division multiplexing transmission and wavelength-division multiplexing soliton transmission (see, for example, N. Edagawa, et al., "Long Distance Soliton WDW transmission using a dispersion-flattened fiber," OFC '97, PD19) . Such an optical communication system is constituted by a high-performance receiver and transmitter for transmitting and receiving signal light, an optical amplifier for optically amplifying the signal light, an optical fiber for transmitting the signal light, and the like. Among them, the optical amplifier, which is essential for obtaining a high S/N, has an optically amplifiable wavelength band ranging from 1530 nm to 1560 nm, thereby the wavelength of usable signal light is substantially<br>
limited within this wavelength bandwidth of 30 nm.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In an optical communication system using an optical amplifier, the strength of signal light in its optical fiber is intensified, thereby nonlinear optical phenomena such as four-wave mixing and self-phase modulation may occur within the optical fiber. Among them, the four-wave mixing can be restrained from occurring when the absolute value of dispersion at the wavelength of signal light is set to about 1 ps/nm/km to 5 ps/nm/km. On the other hand, while the mutual action between self-phase modulation and chromatic dispersion (hereinafter simply referred to as dispersion) is not problematic in the case of soliton transmission of single-wavelength signal light, it may yield the following problems in the case where a plurality of wavelength-multiplexed signal light components are transmitted. Namely, dispersion-shifted optical fibers whose zero-dispersion wavelength has been shifted to a wavelength of about 1550 nm usually have a wavelength dispersion slope (hereinafter simply referred to as dispersion slope) of about 0.07 ps/nm2/km, thereby yielding different dispersion values depending on the wavelength of each signal light component. As a consequence, it may become out of balance with self-phase modulation, thus causing signal light pulses to collapse. Therefore, in such<br>
a case, a dispersion-flattened optical fiber having a very small dispersion slope is needed.<br>
When the nonlinear refractive index of an optical fiber is N2, its effective cross-sectional area is Aeff, the power of signal light is P, and the effective length of the optical fiber is Leff, the amount of occurrence of nonlinear phenomena in the optical fiber is given by the following expression (1):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In order to attain a high S/N by enhancing the signal light power P without increasing the amount of occurrence of nonlinear optical phenomena, a large effective cross-sectional area Ae£f is necessary. In the case of single-wavelength time-division multiplexing transmission, in order to restrain nonlinear optical phenomena from occurring, it is necessary that not only the effective cross-sectional area Aaff be enhanced but also the absolute value of dispersion be suppressed to 1 ps/nm/km or less, and the dispersion slope be made very small. Further, in order to keep the loss upon cabling optical fibers from increasing, it is required that bending loss be small. To this end, it is necessary for cutoff wavelength to be set to an appropriate value.<br>
The above-mentioned nonlinear refractive index N2 is defined as follows. Namely, the refractive index N of a medium under strong light differs depending on the power<br>
of the light. Consequently, the lowest-order effect with respect to the refractive index N is represented by the following expression (2):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
NO is the refractive index with respect to linear polarization;<br>
N2 is the nonlinear refractive index with respect to the third-order nonlinear polarization; and<br>
E is the photoelectric field amplitude.<br>
Under strong light, the refractive index N of the medium is given by the sum of the normal value NO and the increment proportional to the square of the photoelectric field amplitude E. In particular, the constant of proportionality N2 (unit: m2/V2) in the second term is known as nonlinear refractive index.<br>
As disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-OpenNo. 8-248251, the above-mentioned cross-sectional area Aaff is given by the following expression (3):<br>
wherein E is the electric field accompanying the propagated light, and r is the radial distance from a core center.<br>
The dispersion slope is defined by the gradient of a graph showing the dispersion characteristic in a predetermined wavelength band.<br>
As a result of studies concerning conventional dispersion-flattened optical fibers, the inventors have found the following problems. Namely, in the conventional dispersion-flattened optical fibers, though the dispersion slope is small, the effective cross-sectional area is only about 30 µm2 to 40 µm2, thereby optical power density is high in their core region, thus making it easy for nonlinear optical phenomena such as four-wave mixing to occur intensively. As a consequence, the conventional dispersion-flattened optical fibers have not been suitable for wavelength-division multiplexing optical communication systems using optical amplifiers.<br>
For example, the dispersion-flattened optical fiber disclosed in M. Ohashi, et al., "Dispersion-modified Single-Mode Fiber by VAD Method with Low Dispersion in the 1.5 µm Wavelength Region," ECOC '88, pp. 445-448 comprises a core region composed of a center core (first core), a second core surrounding the center core, and a third core surrounding the second core; and a cladding surrounding the core region; while having a triple cladding type refractive index profile in which Ge element is added to the center core (first core) such that the relative refractive index difference of the center core with respect to the cladding is enhanced to 0.87%, F element is added to the second core such that the relative refractive index difference of the second core with respect to the cladding is lowered to -0.41%,<br>
and Ge element is added to the third core such that the relative refractive index difference of the third core with respect to the cladding is enhanced to 0.23%.<br>
Though this conventional dispersion-flattened optical fiber attains a dispersion slope of 0.023 ps/nm2/km at the wavelength of 1550 nm, its effective cross-sectional area Aeff is only about 37 µm2<br>
Also, the dispersion-flattened fiber disclosed in Y. Kubo, et al., "Dispersion Flattened Single-Mode Fiber for 10,000 km Transmission System," ECOC '90, pp. 505-508 comprises a core region composed of a center core and a second core surrounding the center core, and a cladding surrounding the core region; while having a W-shaped refractive index profile in which Ge element is added to the center core such that the relative refractive index difference of the center core with respect to the cladding is enhanced to 0.9%, and F element is added to the second core such that the relative refractive index difference of the second core with respect to the cladding is lowered to -0.4%.<br>
Though this conventional dispersion-flattened optical fiber also attains a dispersion slope of 0.023 ps/nm2/km at the wavelength of 1550 nm, its effective cross-sectional area Aeff is 30 µm2 or less.<br>
On the other hand, though typical dispersion-shifted optical fibers have a relatively large effective cross-sectional area Aeff of about 50 µm2, their dispersion slope<br>
is about 0.07 ps/nm2/km, thus being greatly influenced by dispersion. Therefore, they are not suitable for long-distance optical transmission, either (see, for example, Y. Terasawa, et al., "Design Optimization of Dispersion Shifted Fiber with Enlarged Mode Field Diameter for WDM Transmission," IOOC '95, FA2-2).<br>
Hence, the conventional optical fibers may not suitably be applied to the time-division multiplexing transmission or wavelength-division multiplexing soliton transmission utilizing an optical amplifier.<br>
In order to overcome the above-mentioned problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a dispersion-flattened optical fiber comprising a structure suitable for the time-division multiplexing transmission or wavelength-division multiplexing soliton transmission in an optical communication system including an optical amplifier.<br>
In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to the present invention has, as characteristics at a center wavelength 1550 nm in a 1.55-µm band (1500 nm to 1600 nm), a dispersion with an absolute value not greater than 5 ps/nm/km, an effective cross-sectional area not smaller than 50 µm2, a dispersion slope not greater than 0.02 ps/nm2/km, and a cutoff wavelength not shorter than 1.0 µm at a length of 2 m.<br>
Since the absolute value of dispersion is not greater than 5 ps/nm/km at the wavelength of 1550 nmwith a dispersion slope not greater than 0.02 ps/nm2/km, the dispersion value would vary only a little among individual signal light components in such a dispersion-flattened optical fiber. Also, since the effective cross-sectional area is not smaller than 50 µm2, the power density of the signal light being propagated can be suppressed to a low level in the dispersion-flattened optical fiber. As a consequence, nonlinear optical phenomena are effectively restrained from occurring, and transmission can be carried out with a high S/N. Further, this dispersion-flattened optical fiber has an excellent bending characteristic.<br>
For effectively restraining nonlinear optical phenomena from occurring, it is necessary that the effective cross-sectional area be 50 µm2 or more as mentioned above, more preferably 70 µm2 or more. Such an increase in effective cross-sectional area, however, increases the bending loss. Such an increase in bending loss is undesirable when cabling the dispersion-flattened optical fiber. Meanwhile, the suppression of nonlinear optical phenomena can also be realized by intentionally generating a dispersion in the dispersion-flattened optical fiber.<br>
Therefore, the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to the present invention can also attain a preferable relationship between the above-mentioned<br>
effective cross-sectional area and dispersion slope by setting the effective cross-sectional area to 45 µm2 or more, and the dispersion slope to 0.03 ps/nm2/km or less.<br>
The dispersion-flattened optical fiber having the characteristics mentioned above can be realized when its core region is constituted by a first core having a predetermined refractive index; and a second core, provided on the outer periphery of the first core, having a refractive index higher than that of the first core (ring core structure). Alternatively, the above-mentioned core region can be constituted by a first core having a predetermined refractive index; a second core, provided on the outer periphery of the first core, having a refractive index lower than that of the first core; and a third core, provided on the outer periphery of the second core, having a refractive index higher than that of the second core (three-layer core structure). Its cladding region may have a depressed cladding structure comprising a first cladding (inner cladding) disposed on an outer periphery of the core region; and a second cladding (outer cladding), disposed on an outer periphery of the first cladding, having a refractive index higher than that of the first cladding. The dispersion-flattened optical fiber may also be realized by combining this depressed cladding structure with any of the above-mentioned ring core structure and three-layer core structure.<br>
In view of the case actually employed as a transmission line, it is preferred that the dispersion-flattened optical fiber having the above-mentioned ring core structure or three-layer core structure with the above-mentioned characteristics further have a polarization mode dispersion of 0.15 ps/km1/2 or less as a characteristic at the wavelength of 1550 nm. Also, in view of cabling, the dispersion-flattened optical fiber preferably has a transmission loss of 0.5 dB/turn or less when bent in the diameter of 32 mm and, when it has the above-mentioned three-layer core structure in particular, its cutoff wavelength is preferably 1.4 µm or longer at a length of 2 m.<br>
Also, the inventors have found that, in the dispersion-flattened optical fiber having the above-mentioned three-layer core structure, the third core greatly contributes to lowering the dispersion slope and increasing the cutoff wavelength, thereby reducing the bending loss. Namely, in the dispersion-flattened optical fiber having the three-layer core structure, when the outside diameter of the second core is b, the outside diameter of the third core is c, and the relative refractive index difference of the third core with respect to a reference area in the cladding region is n3, the following relationships:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
are preferably satisfied.<br>
In other words, when the relative refractive index difference of the third core with respect to the reference area in the cladding region is n(r) at a location where the radial distance from a center of the core region is r, the profile volume of the third core preferably satisfies the following condition:<br>
Here, the cladding region may have the above-mentioned depressed cladding structure. In this case, the reference area for defining the relative refractive index difference of each glass region is the second cladding.<br>
In the dispersion-flattened optical fiber constituted by the combination of the three-layer core structure and the depressed cladding structure, when the outside diameter of the first core is a, the outside diameter of the second core is b, the outside diameter of the third core is c, the relative refractive index difference of the first core with respect to the second cladding is n1, and the relative refractive index difference of the first cladding with respect to the second cladding is n4, the following relationships:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
are preferably satisfied.<br>
In addition, in view of fluctuations in manufacture, the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to the present invention must be designed so as to be tolerable to such fluctuations. Specifically, about ±2% of fluctuations in manufacture may occur in the outside diameter of the core region among manufactured lots (i.e., the outside diameter is only controllable within a range not smaller than about ±2%). Hence, it is necessary for the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to the present invention to suppress, as much as possible, the variations in characteristics caused by fluctuations in the outside diameter of the core region, such as variations in dispersion slope in particular.<br>
Experiments conducted by the inventors have revealed that the dispersion slope value tends to decrease and then increase as the outside diameter of the core region increases and further increases, that is, the dispersion slope is minimum at a predetermined value of the outside diameter of the core region. Therefore, in order to restrain characteristics such as dispersion slope from varying due to fluctuations in manufacture, the outside diameter of the core region in the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to the present invention is set within a range of ±2% centered at the outside diameter of<br>
The core region where the dispersion slope acquires the minimum value. In particular, in the case where the outside diameter of the core region fluctuates within the range of ± 2% with respect to its designed value, the amount of variance of dispersion slope is suppressed to 0.003 ps/nm2/km or less.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a dispersion-flattened<br>
optical   fiber   comprising   a   core    region    extending   along   a<br>
predetermined axis and a cladding provided on the outer periphery<br>
of said core region; said dispersion-flattened optical fiber having:<br>
a dispersion with an absolute value of 5 ps/nm/km or less at the<br>
wavelength of 1550 nm;<br>
an   effective   cross-sectional   area  of 45   µm2   or  more   at  the<br>
wavelength of 1550 nm;<br>
a dispersion slope of 0.03 ps/nm2/km or less at a wavelength of<br>
1550 nm;<br>
a cutoff wavelength of 1.0 µm or more at a length of 2 m; and<br>
a transmission loss of 0.5  dB/turn or less when bent into a<br>
diameter of 32 mm at the wavelength of 1550 nm.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be explained with reference to Figs. 1A, 1B,<br>
2 to 4, 5A, 5B, 6 to 10, 11A to 13C, 14, and ISA to 18B. In the explanation of the drawings, constituents identical to each other will be referred to with numerals or letters identical to each other, without repeating their overlapping descriptions.<br>
The dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to the present invention is most favorably applicable to long-distance submarine cables or the like and is a silica-based single mode optical fiber for propagating at least one signal light component in the 1.55-µm wavelength band (at least one signal light components having its center wavelength within the range of 1500 nm to 1600 nm). Also, this dispersion-flattened optical fiber comprises a core region extending along a predetermined axis and a cladding region provided on the outer periphery of the core region, and is designed such that its dispersion slope becomes small in the 1.55-µm wavelength band, which is the signal wavelength band thereof, in order to reduce fluctuations in dispersion among the signal light components propagated thereby.<br>
Specifically, the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to the present invention has, as characteristics at the wavelength of 1550 nm, a dispersion with an absolute value of 5 ps/nm/km or less, an effective cross-sectional area Aeff of 45 µm2 or more, preferably 50 µm2 or more, more preferably 70 µm2 or more, a dispersion slope of 0.03<br>
ps/nm2/km or less, preferably 0.02 ps/nm2/km or less, and a cutoff wavelength of 1.0 µm or longer at a length of 2 m.<br>
Further, it is preferred that the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to the present invention have, as characteristics at the wavelength of 1550 nm, a polarization mode dispersion of 0.15 ps/km1/2 or less, and a transmission loss of 0.5 dB/turn or less when bent in the diameter of 32 mm. A transmission loss per turn is obtained when a transmission loss measured with an optical fiber wound, by a plurality of turns, around a mandrel having a diameter of 32 mm is converted into a per-turn value, and will hereinafter be referred to as bending loss.<br>
For realizing the above-mentioned various characteristics, the core region extending along the predetermined axis may have either a ring core structure comprising a first core having a predetermined refractive index, and a second core, provided on the outer periphery of the first core, having a refractive index higher than that of the first core; or a three-layer core structure comprising a first core having a predetermined refractive index, a second core, provided on the outer periphery of the first core, having a refractive index lower than that of the first core, and a third core, provided on the outer periphery of the second core, having a refractive index higher than that of the second core. In the case of the<br>
three-layer core structure, it is necessary for the cutoff wavelength at a length of 2 m to be 1.4 µm or longer. Also, the cladding region provided on the outer periphery of the core region may have a depressed cladding structure comprising a first cladding (inner cladding) provided on the outer periphery of the core region; and a second cladding (outer cladding), provided on the outer periphery of the first cladding, having a refractive index higher than that of the first cladding.<br>
In particular, in the dispersion-flattened optical fiber having a three-layer core structure, when the outside diameter of the second core is b, the outside diameter of the third core is c, and the relative refractive index difference of the third core with respect to a reference area (the second cladding in the case of the depressed cladding structure) in the cladding region is n3, the following relationships:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
preferably satisfied.<br>
Also, when the relative refractive index difference of the third core with respect to the reference area in the cladding region is An(r) at a location where the radial distance from a center of the core region is r, the profile volume of the third core preferably satisfies the following condition:<br>
Further, in the dispersion-flattened optical fiber constituted by the combination of the three-layer core structure and the depressed cladding structure, when the outside diameter of the first core is a, the outside diameter of the second core is b, the outside diameter of the third core is c, the relative refractive index difference of the first core with respect to the second cladding is Anlf and the relative refractive index difference of the first cladding with respect to the second cladding is An4, the following relationships:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
are preferably satisfied.<br>
Here, the relative refractive index difference of each region with respect to the reference area of the cladding region is given by the following expression (4):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
wherein nT is the refractive index of the target glass region, and nR is the refractive index of the reference cladding area (the refractive index of the second cladding in the case where the cladding region has the depressed cladding structure). In this specification, the relative<br>
refractive index difference of each glass region is expressed in terms of percentage, and the individual parameters in the expression (4 ) may be arranged in any order. Consequently, the relative refractive index difference indicated as a negative value means a region having a refractive index lower than that of the reference area.<br>
Also, it is preferred that the outside diameter of the core region be set within a variable range of ±2% centered at the value where the dispersion slope acquires its minimum value. Specifically, the inventors have found it preferable to design such that, for tolerating fluctuations in manufacture, the amount of fluctuation in dispersion slope be 0.03 ps/nm2/km or less with respect to the fluctuation of the outside diameter of the core region ranging ±2%.<br>

Embodiment 4<br>
Fig. 7 is a refractive index profile of the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to Embodiment 4 of the present invention. The dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to Embodiment 4 has a core region of a three-layer core structure and a cladding region of a single layer. Its refractive index profile 170 is also known as a triple cladding type refractive index profile.<br>
The refractive index profile 170 is basically equivalent to the refractive index of each area along the line L2 in Fig. 5A, in which areas 171, 172, 173, and 174 correspond to the locations, on the line L2, of the first core 601, second core 602, third core 603, and second cladding 702, respectively. In the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to Embodiment 4, however, there is no region corresponding to the first cladding in Fig. 5A.<br>

Fig. 9 is a table listing various characteristics of each of the dispersion-flattened optical fibers according to Embodiments 1 to 4 explained above at the wavelength of 1550 nm. Each of the dispersion-flattened optical fibers according to these embodiments has a dispersion with an absolute value of 5 ps/nm/km or less, an effective cross-sectional area Aeff of 45 µm2 or more, a dispersion slope of 0.03 ps/nm2/km or less, a cutoff wavelength of 1.0 µm or longer at length of 2 m, and a polarization mode dispersion of 0.15 ps/km1/2 or less.<br>
Each of the dispersion-flattened optical fibers has a very small dispersion slope, so that the dispersion characteristic is flat, and a large effective cross-sectional area Aeff of 45 µm2 or more, so that the power density of signal light in the dispersion-flattened optical fiber is suppressed to a low level, thus effectively restraining nonlinear optical phenomena from occurring, and enabling transmission with a high S/N. Further, since the cutoff wavelength at a length of 2 m is 1.0 µm or longer, these dispersion-flattened optical fibers have an excellent bending characteristic (low bending loss). As a consequence, these dispersion-flattened optical fibers are suitable for the time-division multiplexing transmission<br>
or wavelength-division multiplexing soliton transmission using an optical amplifier. In particular, the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to Embodiment 2 (Fig. 3) can suppress the power density of the signal light in the dispersion-flattened optical fiber to a lower level (can more effectively restrain nonlinear optical phenomena from occurring), since the effective cross-sectional area Ae£f is 70 µm2 or more. In the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to Embodiment 3 (Figs. 5A and 5B), the cutoff wavelength at a length of 2 m is longer than the signal light wavelength. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that the actual transmission distance for signal light ranges from several hundreds of km to several thousands of km as will be explained later, its high-order modes would attenuate, leaving no problems.<br>
Without being restricted to the above-mentioned embodiments, the present invention can be implemented in various manners. For instance, the refractive index profiles shown in Embodiments 1 to 4 are merely examples, and there can be various kinds of modes of refractive index profiles for realizing the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to the present invention.<br>
As applied examples of the dispersion-flattened optical fiber having the refractive index profile shown in Fig. 5B, the inventors prepared samples 1 to 5 in which the profile volume in the third core was changed as shown in<br>
Fig. 10, and studied the relationship between the outside diameter of the core region (outside diameter of the third core) c2 and the dispersion slope (ps/nm2/km) and the relationship between the outside diameter of the third core c2 and the cutoff wavelength (µm) at a length of 2 m in each of the samples 1 to 5. Specifically, varied among the prepared samples 1 to 5 are the ratio of the outside diameter of the second core to the outside diameter of the third core (b2/c2) and the relative refractive index difference of the third core An3 with respect to the second cladding. On the other hand, the other parameters are common in the prepared samples 1 to 5, i.e., the ratio of the outside diameter of the first core to the outside diameter of the third core (a2/c2) is 0.25, the ratio of the outside diameter of the first cladding to the outside diameter of the third core (d/c2) is 2.0, the relative refractive index difference of the first core n1 with respect to the second cladding is 0.6%, and the relative refractive index difference of the second core An2 and relative refractive index difference of the first cladding An4 with respect to the second cladding are -0.05% each.<br>
Figs. 11A and 11B are graphs showing changes in dispersion slope (ps/nm2/km) with respect to the outside diameter of the core region (outside diameter c2 of the third core) in the samples 1 to 5, whereas Figs. 12A and 12B are graphs showing changes in cutoff wavelength (µm) with<br>
respect to the outside diameter of the third core c2. In Figs. 11A to 12B, S1 to S5 indicate the graphs of the samples 1 to 5, respectively.<br>
As can be seen from these graphs, when the relative refractive index difference An3 of the third core with respect to the second cladding is too small, or when the ratio of the outside diameter of the second core with respect to the outside diameter of the third core (b2/c2) is too high, the dispersion slope cannot be suppressed to 0.03 ps/nm2/km or less. Also, the cutoff wavelength at a length of 2 m is shortened, thereby the bending loss increases. As a consequence, for lowering the dispersion slope and elongating the cutoff wavelength at a length of 2 m so as to improve the bending loss, it is necessary that the relative refractive index difference An3 of the third core be set to a large value, and that the third core have a large width. Here, in the dispersion-flattened optical fibers according to Embodiments 3 and 4 comprising the core region of the above-mentioned three-layer structure (having a third core), the profile volume of the third core given by the following expression (5):<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
was 13.8% • µm2 and 8.7% • µm2, respectively (see Fig. 9).<br>
Next, as applied examples of the dispersion-flattened<br>
optical fiber according to Embodiment 3 (Figs. 5A and 5B),<br>
the inventors prepared samples 6 to 9 having refractive index profiles shown in Figs. 13A to 13C, respectively, and measured various characteristics of the samples 6 to 9 at the wavelength of 1550 nm. Here, thus prepared samples 6 to 9 have a structure similar to the cross-sectional structure shown in Fig. 5A, comprising a core region constituted by a first core, a second core, and a third core, and a cladding region constituted by a first cladding and a second cladding.<br>
The sample 6 has a refractive index profile 520 shown in Fig. 13A, and the refractive index profile 520 is equivalent to the refractive index of each area along the line L2 in Fig. 5A. In this refractive index profile 520, areas 521, 522, 523, 524, and 525 correspond to the locations, on the lineL2, of the first core 601, second core 602, third core 603, first cladding 701, and second cladding 702, respectively.<br>
In the sample 6, the outside diameter a2 of the first core (refractive index n:) corresponding to the area 521 is 5.7 µm, the outside diameter b2 of the second core (refractive index n2  n2) corresponding to the area 523 is 22.6 µm, the outside diameter d of the first cladding (refractive index n4 = n2) corresponding to the area 524 is 45.2 µm, and the outside diameter of the second cladding<br>
(refractive index ns &gt; n4) corresponding to the area 525 is 125 µm. With respect to the second cladding, the relative refractive index difference An: (= (n: - n5)/n5) of the first core is 0.60%, the relative refractive index difference A n2 (= (n2 - n5)/n5) of the second core and the relative refractive index difference An4 (= (n4 - n5)/n5) of the first cladding are -0.05% each, and the relative refractive index difference An3 (= (n3 - n5)/n5) of the third core is 0.30%. Further, the ratio of the outside diameter of the fist core to the outside diameter of the third core (a2/c2) is 0.25, and the ratio of the outside diameter of the second core to the outside diameter of the third core (b2/c2) is 0.65.<br>
The sample 7 has a refractive index profile 530 shown in Fig. 13B, and the refractive index profile 530 is equivalent to the refractive index of each area along the line L2 in Fig. 5A. In this refractive index profile 530, areas 531, 532, 533, 534, and 535 correspond to the locations, on the line L2, of the first core 601, second core 602, third core 603, first cladding 701, and second cladding 702, respectively. In thus prepared sample 7, the form of the refractive index profile in the area 533 (corresponding to the refractive index profile in the diametrical direction of the third core area) differs from that of the area 513 in the refractive index profile 510 shown in Fig. 5B.<br>
In the sample 7, the outside diameter a2 of the first core (refractive index n1) corresponding to the area 531 is<br>
5.6 µm, the outside diameter b2 of the second core (refractive index n2  n2) corresponding to the area 533 is 24.2µm the outside diameter d of the first cladding (refractive index n4 = n2) corresponding to the area 534 is 48.4 µm, and the outside diameter of the second cladding (refractive index n5 &gt; n4) corresponding to the area 535 is 125 µm. With respect to the second cladding, the relative refractive index difference Anx (= (n: - n5)/n5) of the first core is 0.60%, the relative refractive index difference A n2 (= (n2 - n5)/n5) °f tne second core and the relative refractive index difference n4 (= (n4 - n5)/n5) of the first cladding are -0.05% each, and the relative refractive index difference An3 (= (n3 - n5)/n5) of the third core is 0.41%. Further, the ratio of the outside diameter of the fist core<br>
*<br>
to the outside diameter of the third core (a2/c2) is 0.23, and the ratio of the outside diameter of the second core to the outside diameter of the third core (b2/c2) is 0.52. The sample 8 has a refractive index profile 540 shown in Fig. 13C, and the refractive index profile 540 shown is equivalent to the refractive index of each area along the line L2 in Fig. 5A. In this refractive index profile 540, areas 541, 542, 543, 544, and 545 correspond to the location5, on the line L2, of the first core 601, second core 602, third core 603, first cladding 701, and second cladding 702,<br>
respectively. In thus prepared sample 8, the form of the refractive index profile in the area 541 (corresponding to the refractive index profile in the diametrical direction of the first core area) differs from that of the area 511 in the refractive index profile 510 shown in Fig. 5B.<br>
In the sample 8, the outside diameter a2 of the first core (refractive index nl) corresponding to the area 541 is 8.6 µm, the outside diameter b2 of the second core (refractive index n2  n2) corresponding to the area 543 is 25.2µm the outside diameter d of the first cladding (refractive index n4 = n2) corresponding to the area 544 is 50.4 µm, and the outside diameter of the second cladding (refractive index n5 &gt; n4) corresponding to the area 545 is 125 µm. With respect to the second cladding, the relative refractive index difference Anj (= (nx - n5)/n5) of the first core is 0.85%, the relative refractive index difference A n2 (= (n2 - n5)/n5) °f the second core and the relative refractive index difference An4 (= (n4 - n5)/n5) of the first cladding are -0.05% each, and the relative refractive index difference n3 (= (n3 - n5)/n5) of the third core is 0.29%. Further, the ratio of the outside diameter of the fist core to the outside diameter of the third core (a2/c2) is 0.34, and the ratio of the outside diameter of the second core to the outside diameter of the third core (b2/c2) is 0.74.<br>
On the other hand, the sample 9 has a similar refractive index profile to the above-mentioned sample 6. Therefore, in sample 9, the outside diameter a2 of the first core (refractive index n:) corresponding to the area 521 is 6.6 µm, the outside diameter b2 of the second core (refractive index n2  n2) corresponding to the area 523 is 25.5 µm the outside diameter d of the first cladding (refractive index n4 = n2) corresponding to the area 524 is 41.0 µm, and the outside diameter of the second cladding (refractive index n5 &gt; n4) corresponding to the area 525 is 125 µm. With respect to the second cladding, the relative refractive index difference An: (= (nL - n5)/n5) of the first core is 0.50%, the relative refractive index difference A n2 (= (n2 - n5)/n5) °f the second core and the relative refractive index difference An4 (= (n4 - n5)/n5) of the first cladding are -0.15% each, and the relative refractive index difference An3 (= (n3 - n5)/n5) of the third core is 0.43%. Further, the ratio of the outside diameter of the fist core to the outside diameter of the third core (a2/c2) is 0.26, and the ratio of the outside diameter of the second core to the outside diameter of the third core (b2/c2) is 0.74. By this design, a dispersion flattened optical fiber, which has a positive dispersion value and an exceedingly small dispersion slope, can be obtained.<br>
Fig. 14 shows various characteristics of thus designed samples 6 to 9 at the wavelength of 1550 nm. Here, in view of the individual values of the above-mentioned samples 3 to 9, the profile volume of the third core given by expression (5) is preferably 7.0%µm2 or more.<br>
Further, the inventors measured a plurality of prepared samples in terms of relation5hips between the outside diameter c2 of the third core (outside diameter of the core region) and the above-mentioned various characteristics concerning the dispersion-flattened optical fiber having the refractive index profile shown in Fig. 13B (sample 7). In the prepared samples, with respect to the second cladding, the relative refractive index difference Anj (= (n: - n5)/n5) of the first core is 0.61%, the relative refractive index difference An2 (= (n2 - n5)/n5) of the second core and the relative refractive index difference An4 (= (n4 - n5)/n5) of the first cladding are -0.05% each, and the relative refractive index difference An3 (= (n3 - n5)/n5) of the third core is 0.35%. The second cladding is made of pure quartz. Further, the ratio of the outside diameter of the fist core to the outside diameter of the third core (a2/c2) is 0.23, and the ratio of the outside diameter of the second core to the outside diameter of the third core (b2/c2) is 0.52, and the ratio of the outside diameter of the first cladding to the outside diameter of the third core (d/c2) is 1.8.<br>
Figs. ISA to 15D show the results of measurement of the prepared samples, indicating the relation5hip between the outside diameter c2 (µm) of the third core and the effective cross-sectional area Aeff (µm2), the relation5hip between the outside diameter c2 (µm) of the third core and the bending loss (dB/m) when bent at a diameter of 20 mm, the relation5hip between the outside diameter c2 (µm) of the third core and the dispersion slope (ps/nm2/km), and the relation5hip between the outside diameter c2 (µm) of the third core and the dispersion (ps/nm/km), respectively. In each graph, curves L3, L4, L5, and L6 are theoretical curves obtained by calculation, and plotted dots represent measured values.<br>
As can be seen from these graphs, the resulting dispersion-flattened optical fibers have, at the wavelength of 1550 nm, a dispersion value of -4 to +4 ps/nm/km ( 45 µm2).<br>
To be noted in Fig. 15C in particular is that the fluctuation in dispersion slope is small in the area indicated by A in the graph even when the outside diameter of the third core fluctuates. In general, when making an optical fiber, about ±2% of fluctuation5 in manufacture may occur in the outside diameter of the core region among manufactured lots (i.e., the outside diameter is only<br>
controllable within a range not smaller than about ±2%). Therefore, if the outside diameter of the core region can be controlled within the range in which fluctuation5 in dispersion slope are suppressed, characteristics among the products (dispersion-flattened optical fibers) can be prevented from fluctuating due to the fluctuation5 in manufacture as a matter of course.<br>
Figs. 16A and 16B are graphs showing relation5hips between fluctuation5 in outside diameter of the core region and fluctuation5 in various characteristics, in which Fig. 16A indicates relation5hips between the outside diameter c2 of the third core and the dispersion (ps/nm/km) and the dispersion slope (ps/nm2/km), whereas Fig. 16B indicates a relation5hip of the amount of change in dispersion slope (ps/nm2/km/%) to the ratio of change in outside diameter of the core region (%). In Fig. 16A, D represents dispersion and DS represents dispersion slope.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 16A, while the dispersion value increases as the diameter of area where the signal light is propagated (mainly the core region) increases in diameter, the dispersion slope attain5 a minimum value when the outside diameter c2 of the third core is at a certain value. In particular, the fluctuation of dispersion slope becomes small in the proximity of this minimum value. Specifically, as can be seen from the graph shown in Fig. 16B, when the dispersion-flattened optical fiber is<br>
designed such that the outside diameter of the core region is set to an appropriate value, the amount of change in dispersion slope can be suppressed to 0.003 ps/nm2/km/% or less with respect to the ratio of change in outside diameter of the core region within the range of ±2% in which the outside diameter is controllable.<br>
The bending loss (dB/m) and cutoff wavelength in the dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to the present invention will now be explained.<br>
Fig. 17A is a graph plotting measured values of bending loss (dB/m) with respect to changes in bending diameter (mm), while the outside diameter c2 of the third core is con5tantly held at 22.4 µm. In this graph, L7 represents a theoretical value obtained by calculation. As can be seen from this graph, the bending loss at a bending diameter of 32 mm is 0.04 dB/m (= 0.004 dB/turn), which is a favorable value.<br>
On the other hand, Fig. 17B is a graph plotting measured values of cutoff wavelength (µm) with respect to changes in fiber length (km), while the outside diameter c2 of the third core is con5tantly held at 22.8 µm. In this graph, L8 represents a theoretical value obtained by calculation. The gradient of the line L8 is -252 nm/decade. As can be seen from this graph, even when the cutoff wavelength at a length of 2 m is 2.080 µm, a single-mode operation can be assured at a length of about 200 m or longer. As a con5equence, there is no problem in practice even when<br>
the cutoff wavelength at a length of 2 m is longer than the signal light wavelength (since an optical tran5mission line in a submarine cable or the like is usually con5tituted by fusing together a plurality of optical fibers each having a length of about 5 km).<br>
Fig. 18A is a graph showing a relation5hip between the profile volume (% • µm2) of the third core and the dispersion slope (ps/nm2/km) in each of the above-mentioned samples 1 to 5, whereas Fig. 18B is a graph showing a relation5hip between the profile volume (% • µm2) of the third core and the cutoff wavelength (µm) in each of the samples 1 to 5. As mentioned above, the cutoff wavelength at a length of 2 m is needed to be 1.4 µm or longer in the dispersion-flattened optical fiber having a core region of three-layer structure (Embodiments 3 and 4 comprising the third core). Also, it is preferred that the dispersion slope be 0.03 ps/nm2/km or less. Con5equently, for satisfying these restriction5, in view of Figs . 18Aandl8B, the profile volume in the third core (see expression (5)) must be 7.0% •µm2 or greater. In Figs. 18A and 18B, Si to S5 represent dispersion slopes and cutoff wavelengths with respect to profile volumes of the above-mentioned samples 1 to 5, respectively.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As explained in detail in the foregoing, the<br>
dispersion-flattened optical fiber according to the present invention has, at the wavelength of 1550 nm, a dispersion with an absolute value not greater than 5 ps/nm/km and a dispersion slope of 0.03 ps/nm2/km or less, thereby being capable of suppressing differences in dispersion value among individual signal light components over the whole wavelength band employed. Also, the effective cross-sectional area is preferably 45 µm2 or more. When such an appropriate relation5hip between the effective cross-sectional area and the dispersion slope is realized, the<br>
power density of signal light in the dispersion-flattened<br>
optical fiber is suppressed to a low level, thus effectively<br>
restraining nonlinear optical phenomena from occurring, thereby enabling tran5mission with a high S/N. Further, since the cutoff wavelength at a length of 2 m is l.0µm or more, this dispersion-flattened optical fiber has an excellent bending characteristic. Therefore, this dispersion-flattened optical fiber is suitable for the time-division multiplexing tran5mission or wavelength-division multiplexing soliton tran5mission using an optical amplifier.<br>
Also, when the effective cross-sectional area is 70 µm2or more, the power den5ity of signal light in the dispersion-flattened optical fiber can be suppressed to a lower level, thereby nonlinear optical phenomena are more effectively restrained from occurring. Therefore, this<br>
dispersion-flattened optical fiber is more suitable for the time-division multiplexing tran5mission or wavelength-division multiplexing soliton tran5mission using an optical amplifier.<br><br><br>
