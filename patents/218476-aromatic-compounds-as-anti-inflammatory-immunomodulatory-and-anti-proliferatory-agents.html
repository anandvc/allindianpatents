TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Aromatic compounds as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-proliferatory agents<br>
APPLICANTS<br>
Name	: 4SC AG<br>
Nationality :   a German Company<br>
Address      :   am Klopferspitz 19a, 82152 Martinsried, Germany<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
815/MUMNP/2005<br><br>
The invention relates to novel aromatic compounds that can be used as antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory and antiproliferatory agents. In particular the invention refers to new compounds which inhibit dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a process for their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use for the treatment and prevention of diseases, in particular their use in diseases where there is an advantage in inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH).<br>
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease which is quite common especially among elder people. Its treatment with usual medications as for example non-steroid antiÂ¬inflammatory agents is not satisfactory. In view of the increasing ageing of the population, especially in the developed Western countries or in Japan the development of new medications for the treatment of RA is urgently required.<br>
WO 99/38846 and EP 0 646 578 disclose compounds which are reported to be useful for treatment of RA.<br>
A medicament against rheumatoid arthritis with a new mechanism of action, leflunomide, was recently put on the market by the company Aventis under the tradename ARAVA [EP 780128, WO 97/34600]. Leflunomide has immunomodulatory as well as anti-inflammatory properties [EP 217206, DE 2524929]. The mechanism of action is based upon the inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme of the pyrimidine biosynthesis.<br>
In the body, DHODH catalyzes the synthesis of pyrimidines, which are necessary for cell growth. An inhibition of DHODH inhibits the growth of (pathologically) fast proliferating cells, whereas cells which grow at normal speed may obtain their<br><br>
required pyrimidine bases from the normal metabolic cycle. The most important types of cells for the immuno response, the lymphocytes, use exclusively the synthesis of pyrimidines for their growth and react particularly sensitively to DHODH inhibition. Substances that inhibit the growth of lymphocytes are important medicaments for the<br>
The DHODH inhibiting leflunomide (ARAVA) is the first medicament of this class of compounds (leflunomides) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. WO 99/45926 is a further reference that discloses compounds which act as inhibitors of DHODH.<br>

For example 3,4-dicarboxylic acids of thiophene, furan and pyrrole were converted into the corresponding anhydrides and reacted with amines in analogy to DE 3933573 and D. P. Arnold, Aust. J. Chem. 44,1991, 323-330.<br>
3-carboxamide-2-carboxylic acids or 2-carboxamide-3-carboxylic acids of thiophene, furan and pyrrole were synthesized from 3-carboxylic acids or 2-carboxylic acids, respectively, by amidation of the acid group and subsequent directed ortho-metalation in 2- or 3-position, respectively, followed by addition of carbon dioxide as electrophile according to DE 3933573.<br>
Differently 4,5-substituted 2,3-pyrroledicarboxylic esters and acids were prepared according to literature procedures:<br>
a)	l-hydroxy-4,5-dimethyl: from' dialkyl' acetylenedicarboxylates and butane-2,3-dione monooximes, I. Yavari et al., Synth. Commun. 26, 1996, 4495-4499.<br>
b)	3-hydroxy-4-alkyl or -aryl: from dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates and amino acid esters, P. Kolar et al, Synth. C6mmun. 24,1994,1887-1893.<br>
c)	mixed 4,5-alkyl/aryl: from dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates and aryl- or<br>
benzylhydrazones, J. Barluenga et al., Synthesis, 1975, 642-643.<br>
d)	4-methyl: from N-acetonylphthalimide and diethyl oxalacetate, R; E. Lancaster et<br>
al., J. Org. Chem. 23,1958,1208-1209.<br><br>
The pyrrole diester can be converted into the corresponding acids and anhydrides for further amidation reactions ,or direcfiy transformed into the corresponding mono-hydrazinocarbonyls (M. T. Garcia-Lppez et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans., 1978, 483-487). Diethyl 2-alkyl-, -aryl-, or -aminothiazole-4,5-carboxylates were synthesized from diethyl a-halo-P-oxosuccinate and the respective thioamides or thiourea in analogy to W. K. Anderson et al., J. Med. Chem. 27, 1984, 1559-1565; E. H. Huntress et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 65, 1943, 2167-2169; L. H. Conover et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 72, 1950, 5221-5225; M. Robba et al., Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 1969, 1762-1768.<br>
All diesters were converted into the monoamides as described above. Mixtures of regioisomers resulting from the amidation reaction had to be separated.<br>
Aromatic systems containing a sulfur atom within the aromatic framework can be converted into the corresponding S-monobxides of -dioxides by oxidation of the afore mentioned heterocycles with 'm-ehlorobenz'bic acide, either with or without trifluoroborate etherate being added (N. Furukawa et al., Heterocycles 44, 1997, 61-66).<br>
The invention also provides methods for preparing compounds of formula (II) wherein R2 together with the nitrogen atom which is attached to R8 form a 6 membered heterocylic ring system<br>
For example diethyl 3-acetyl-2-methylfuran-4,5-dicarboxylate was prepared from acetylated sulphonium methylides and diethyl acetylenedicarboxilate according to Tetrahedron 26, 1970, 4353-4360. The diester was converted into the corresponding! anhydride, which was next reacted with an amine as described above to give a; mixture of regioisomers for monoamidation product. Upon esterification of the carboxylic acid using dicylcohexylcarbodiirriide1, 4-dimethylaminopyridine and ethanol in methylene chloride, the two regioisomers were separated, and a-bromination at the acetyl futictionatiiy o'Â£ ethyl 3-acetyl-2-methyl-4-carboxamide-furan-5-carboxylate was achieved either with bromine in methylene chloride or copper dibromide in ethyl acetate in analogy to literature procedures: S. Laufer et al., Arch. Pharm. 330, 1997, 307-312; S. K. C. Devi et al., Synth. Commun. 32, 2002, 1523-1528.<br><br>

The dose can vary within wideiMml$s^and4s"to be-suitedko the individual conditions in each individual case. For the above us6s' the appropriate dosage will vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. In general, however, satisfactory results are achieved at dosage rates of about<br><br>
1 to 100 mg/kg animal body weight preferably 1 to 50 mg/kg. Suitable dosage rates for larger mammals, for example humans, are of the order of from about 10 mg to 3 g/day, conveniently administered once, in divided doses 2 to 4 times a day, or in sustained release form.<br>
In general, a daily dose of approximately 10 mg to 5000 mg, preferably 50 to 500 mg, per human individual is appropriate in the case of the oral administration which is the preferred form of administration according to the invention. In the case of other administration forms too, the daily dose is in similar ranges.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) can also be used in the form of a precursor (prodrug) or a suitably modified form, that releases the active compound in vivo. Such precursors such as the preferred embodiments of R6 or R1 can be obtained for example by masking the free acid group with an ester group, which is then in turn transformed into the free acid group in vivo [F. W. Sum et. al. Bioorg. &amp; Med. Chem. Lett. 9 (1999), 1921-1926; Ada Rephaeli et. al. Drug Development Research 50 (2000) 379-391; H. Ishikawa, Current Med. Chem. 6 (1999), 575-597].
