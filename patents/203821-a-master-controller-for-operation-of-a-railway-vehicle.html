(Technical Field)<br>
The present invention relates to a master controller for operation of a railway vehicle and particularly to a technique in which plural rotation angle sensors for obtaining a notch signal are provided in a master controller.<br>
(Prior Art)<br>
Recently, a construction as a master controller, in which a notch signal being interlocked to a handle is outputted, is changed to an electric system using an encoder or an electrostatic capacity sensor from a mechanical system using a cum switch. For one example, there is one technique shown in (1) Japanese application patent laid-open publication No. Hei 7-107625 and another technique shown in (2) Japanese application patent laid-open publication No. Hei 10-80010.<br>
In the above stated conventional master controller techniques, the rotation angle sensor is formed with a double system and then reliability performance of a train operation can be heightened, however as to relating to a redundancy performance in a train operation it is not taken into consideration.<br>
Namely, in a case of the above stated conventional technique<br>
shown in (1) Japanese application patent laid-open	<br><br><br>
3<br>
publication No. Hei 7-107625, it can correspond only to a case where one of the two rotary encoders is out of order and a signal transmission comes to end, however it does not refer to a case in which values of both siqnals are slipped off, etc..<br>
Further, in a case of the above stated conventional technique shown in (2) Japanese application patent laid-open publication No. Hei 10-80010, when a detection notch of some rotation angle sensor is not coincided with, it can be treated as an abnormality, then there is not an afraid about an error notch command.<br>
However, when an abnormality generates on one of two rotation angles, immediately after since a controlling apparatus or a motor of a locomotive vehicle is formed to stop, in regardless of theTeaving of one of the normal rotation angle, there is a problem in which a whole of a railway train is performed to stop.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a master controller having a redundancy performance in a train operation in which as the master controller having two rotation angle sensors in one of the rotation angle sensors an abnormality generates, even when a non-conformance generates in the both output values of the rotation angle sensors, an operation of a railway vehicle can be continued.<br>
The above stated object can be attained by a master controller in which sTgnal corresponding to each of notches<br><br>
"power", "neutral", and "brake" is outputted from two rotation angle sensors by interlocking a handle, the master controller wherein a position sensor for detecting a "neutral" is provided separately, when the handle is positioned at the "neutral" position, whether the rotation angle sensor checks the "neutral" position or not, and an output of the rotation angle sensor which does not detect the "neutral" position is released.<br>
The above stated object can be attained by a master controller in which a signal corresponding to each of notches of "power", "neutral", and "brake" is outputted from two rotation angle sensors by interlocking a handle, the master controller wherein output signals of the two rotation angle sensors are compared with, and when both output signals of the two rotation angle sensors differ, by selecting a signal at more brake side is selected and outputted.<br>

Description of the Invention:<br>
Hereinafter, a master controller of one embodiment accordinq to the present invention will be explained.<br>
Fia. 1 is an orthoaonal cross-sectional view from a master controller taken from an operator side. To a frame 1 a shaft<br>
3	is installed rotatively freely through bearing members 21 and<br>
22 and the shaft 3 is carried out a rotation motion according<br>
to a handle 4 which is operated by an operator. The positions<br>
enable to be taken by the handle 4, in this embodiment according<br>
to the present invention, are nine (9) portions which are "brake<br>
4	notch" (hereinafter it is abbreviated as "B4" ) , "brake 3 notch"<br>
(hereinafter it is abbreviated as "B3"), "brake 2 notch"<br>
(hereinafter it is abbreviated as "B2"), "brake 1 notch"<br>
(hereinafter it is abbreviated as "Bl"), "neutral notch"<br>
(hereinafter it is abbreviated as "N"), "power 1 notch"<br>
(hereinafter it is abbreviated as "Pl'M , "power 2 notch"<br>
(hereinafter it is abbreviated as "P2"), "power 3 notch"<br>
(hereinafter it is abbreviated as "P3"), and "power 4 notch"<br>
(hereinafter it is abbreviated as "P4").<br>
Further, a number of the_riatc-hes-i-s-no-t^always necessary to have the same one in this embodiment according to the present<br><br>
6<br>
invention, for example, it can be thirteen (13) portions, such as "B7", "B6", "B5", "B4", "B3", "B2", "Bl", "N", "Pi", "P2", " P 3 "  " P 4 "  " P 5 "<br>
To the shaft 3, two rotation angle sensors 5a and 5b are installed, and in response to the detection angle thereof, each<br>
of the notches of the above stated "B4", "B3", "B2" .^LBl-1	IN",<br>
"PI", "P2", "P3", "P4" are assigned. As to the two rotation angle sensors 5a and 5b, the two rotation angle sensors 5a and 5b are employed well known resolvers, for example.<br>
This principle in the resolver is the same of the principle of the synchronization and it uses an induction combination of the primary windings J&gt;1 and P2 and.the.secondary windings SI and S2 as shown in Fig. 1.  In Fig. 1, each of Tl T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7 and_T8 indicates a power supply connection use terminal. As a structure there are a rotor and a stator and has two-phase windings which are orthogonal each other.<br>
When to a primary side the alternating current is added, to a'secondary side, when a rotation angle of the rotor is 0, the voltage which is proportional to sine (sin) and cosine (cos) can be obtained. By utilizing the voltage having sine (sin) and cosine (cos), it is possible to detect the rotation angle. Further, in this embodiment according to the present invention, as to the rotation^angle" sensors 5a and 5b, the resolvers are used, however in addition to these resolvers it is possible to apply a rotary encoder and the like.<br>
On the otner hand, to the shaft 3 in which the handle 4 is positioned at "N", pins 6a and 6b are wedged in, and by<br><br>
detecting respectively the detection of positions of the pins 6a and 6b according to position sensors 7a and 7b, "N" position is detected.<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view along to A-A line of Fig. 1. "The handle 4 can be operated, as shown in this figure, In ranges of "B4", "B3", "B2", "Bl", "N", "Pi", "P2", "P3", "P4". In accompany with this, the shaft 3 , the rotation angle sensors 5a and 5b, and the pins 6a and 6b are rotated. The position of the handle 4 is set "N" as standard namely it is made 6 1 = 02 = 0_degree, and an interval of each notches is 10 degree.<br>
Fig. 3 is a control block diagram showing the master controller. As shown in this figure, the notch detection is constituted to be carried out according to two systems. In a first system, the angle output signal 6 1 from the rotation angle sensor 5a is inputted into a notch discrimination part 8a and the notch in response to 0 1 is detected and the detected notch signal is outputted. In a second system, the angle output signal 6 2 from the rotation angle sensor 5b is inputted into a notch discrimination part 8b and the notch in response to 0 2 is detected and the detected notch signal is outputted.<br>
Further, a detail of the notch discrimination part 8a will be explained in a latter portion using Fig. 4. As to an output of the position sensor 7a, the position of the pin 6a is detected and against "N" position, only within a range of ± 3 degree, an "ON" single is outputted.<br>
The detection notch signal of the first system and the second system is inputted into a notch output part 9 and<br><br>
according to a logic shown in Fiq. 5 an output notch is determined. Namely, when the detection notch of the first system and the detection notch of the second system are equal, such a notch is outputted but when the detection notch of the first system and the detection notch of the second system are different, a notch of a more brake direction is outputted.<br>
For example, when the first system detects "Bl" and the second system detects "Pi", then "Bl" is outputted. According to the output of the more brake direction, it is possible to select a safety side. In accordance with the notch output, the controllers and the motors in the locomotive vehicle during the train are operated.<br>
An abnormality judgment partJLOa is a part in which an abnormality of the rotation angle sensor 5a is judged. Herein, without of regard by fitting the handle 4 to "N" position the output of the position sensor 7a is presented to "ON" state, when the output of the rotation angle sensor 5a is not outputted the detection notch signal which corresponds to "N", "the first system release" signal is outputted to the notch output part 9. In this time, from the notch output part 9 an output notch signal according to only the detection notch signal from the second system is outoutted.<br>
Further,_in_this_embodiment according to the present invention, to the first system and to the second system the position sensors 7a and 7b are provided respectively. However, for example, the position sensor can be provided only the first system, namely only the position sensor 7a is provided, and this<br><br>
output can be to input to the abnormality judgment parts 10a and 10b of the_first system and the second system at the same time.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a notch discrimination according to the angle output signal 6 1 from the rotation angle sensor 5a in the notch discrimination part 8a shown in Fig. 3. To carry out the notch discrimination for coming under the detection notch signal, it discriminates with a hysteresis of __2_de_gree..<br>
Namely, when it proceeds from "N" to "Pi", at a time where from a true notch position "N" to "Pi" direction it is rotated with 6 degree, the output of the notch discrimination part 8a namely the detection notch is changed from "N". to "PI".<br>
Similarlv to. when from the "PI" it is returned to "N" . at a where from the true notch position "N" it is returned to 4 degree, the output of the notch discrimination part 8a namely the detection notch is changed from "PI" to "N". The reasons why the hysteresis is provided, a chattering occurrence in a vicinity of a boundary of the notch can be prevented.<br>
Further, in this figure, the output signal from the position sensor 7a is shown, as stated in above it states at the same time "ON" signal is outputted only a range of + 3 degree against "N" position of the handle 4.<br>
Next, referring to Fig. 6, a motion during the abnormality will be explained. Supposing that at a time tl in the second system namely the abnormality generated in the rotation angle sensor 5b and against the true notch "P4" the second system detection notch becomes "P2". In this condition, according to<br><br>
10<br>
the master controller it is impossible to discriminate that either the abnormality generates in the first system and in the second system, however in accordance with the logic of Fig. 5 the output notch becomes "P2".<br>
A process in which the handle 4 is returned to "N" is at a time t2, a time t3, and a time t4 by the operator, similarly to the condition on a time tl, it is impossible to discriminate the which system is presented the abnormality, however comparing with both systems, the notch in more brake side is outputted.<br>
A condition in which the handle 4 is returned to the true notch "N" is at a time t6 and the position sensors 5a and 5b are presented to an "ON" state. However, as to the second system, since the detection notch becomes to present "B2", the abnormality judgment part 10b output "the second system<br>
release" signal to the notch output part 9. The notch-output part 9 receives this signal and releases the second system, and only'first, system detection notch is presented to as the output notch. Accordingly, on and after this, even when the operator moves the handle 4 to "Pi", "P2", "P3", "P4", only the first system detection notch is continued to output. These manners at a time t7, a time t8, a time t9, and a time tlO are shown in Fig. 6. In this Fig. 6, for example, <b2 indicates an error position signal.></b2>
Next, it will be explained why at "N" position the abnormality detection is carried out (why at "P4", "B4", etc. the "abnormality" detection is not carried out) . When the train<br><br>
11<br>
which is stopped some station is intended to run to a next stopping station, the operation of the master controller by the operator and the conditions of the train become as a following case No. 1. Further, "B" means one of "Bl", "B2", "B3", "B4" and "p" means one of "Pi", "P2", "P3", "P4". Case No. 1:<br>
some station stopping time:<br>
"B"	(stopping)<br>
some station starting time:<br>
"B" =&gt; "N" =&gt; "P"   (starting, acceleration) between both stations:<br>
"P" =&gt; "N"         (coasting) . between both stations:<br>
"N" =&gt; "P" =&gt; "N"   (re-power) between both stations:<br>
"N" =&gt; &gt;&gt;B" =&gt; "N"   (speed limitation) next station approaching time:<br>
"N" =^ "B"         (deceleration, stopping) next station stopping time:<br>
"B"	(stopping)<br>
As understood from above, when the train which is stopped at some station is intended to run to the next stopping station, the handle 4 is operated as a center of "N". As a result, every each time, it is possible to carry out the self diagnosis whether the abnormality is generated in the master controller or not.<br>
However, supposing that to "P4" the above stated "abnormality" detection function is given, when there is a down<br><br>
gradient from some station to the next stopping station, it is not always to detect the "abnormality". Namely, there is a possibility in which the running is carried out not performing the power notch as shown in a following case 2, Further, supposing that it will be similar that the power notch is carried out but it operates only to "P3". Case No. 2:<br>
some station stopping time:<br>
"B"	(stopping)<br>
some station starting time:<br>
"B" =&gt; "N"         (starting under low gradient,<br>
acceleration) between both stations:<br>
"N"	(acceleration under down<br>
gradient) between both stations:<br>
"N" =&gt; "B" =&gt; "N"    (speed limitation condition) next station approaching time:<br>
"N" ^ "B"	(deceleration, stopping<br>
condition) next station stopping time:<br>
"B"	(stopping condition)<br>
In this time, when to "B4" the "abnormality" detection function is given, when only the train is stopped according to the brake operation of "Bl", "B2", "B3", it is impossible to carry out the "abnormality" detection.<br>
With the above stated reasons, it is best to the train<br><br>
13<br>
to carry out the "abnormality" detection using "N", even when to some system the abnormality generates, without the stopping of the train operation since the train can be operated until a place for enable to mend, the redundancy performance in the train operation can be improved.<br>
According to the present invention, when the abnormality generates to one side of the two rotation angle sensors of the master controller, such an abnormality is detected according to "N" position sensor, and this rotation angle sensor is released and using the remaining rotation angle sensor it is possible to continue the function as the master controller. As a result, the effect in which the redundancy performance in the train operation can be improved can be obtained.<br><br>
