Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of (S)-(+)-N, N-dimethyl-3- (1-naphthalenyloxy) -3-(2-thienyl) propanamine, a key intermediate for the preparation of Duloxetine or an acid addition salt.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Duloxetine, [(+)-N-methyl-3- (l-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl) propanamine] has the following structure <br>
Duloxetine hydrochloride is the active ingredient of 'CYMBALTA', which inhibits the uptake of both norepinephrine and serotonin. Duloxetine was first disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,956,388 by Robertson, et al., and the synthesis of it was discussed in more detail by Deeter, et al., in Tetrahedron Letters, 31(49), 7101-04 (1990).<br>
US 5,362,886 discloses a process for the preparation of Duloxetine, or an acid addition salt comprising<br>
i. Condensing (S)-(-)-N, N-dimethyl-3 - (2-thienyl)-3-hydroxypropanamine with 1-fluoronaphthalene in presence of sodium hydride and potassium benzoate in DMSO so as to obtain (S)-(+)-N, N-dimethyl-3- (1-naphthalenyloxy) -3-(2-thienyl) propanamine (optionally converting it to its phosphate salt).<br><br>
ii.  Demethylation of (S)-(+)-N, N-dimethyl-3- (1 -naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl) propanamine with phenyl chloroformate followed by hydrolysis to get Duloxetine<br>
iii.  If desired, converting Duloxetine to its acid addition salt as appropriate<br><br>
PCT publication WO 2004/056795 discloses a process for the preparation of Duloxetine, or an acid addition salt thereof, which process comprises resolving racemic Duloxetine with a chiral acid so as to obtain a salt of the chiral acid and (+) Duloxetine, substantially free of (-) Duloxetine; and also disclosed a process for preparing (+) Duloxetine, or an acid addition salt thereof, comprise an O-alkylation intermediate process step which is carried out in the presence of a base and a phase transfer catalyst.<br><br>
EP 0457559 discloses a process for the preparation of D (+) Duloxetine oxalate as shown in the following scheme-3.<br><br><br>
In the prior art processes coupling of (S)-(+)-N,N-dimethyl-3 -(2-thienyl)-3 -hydroxypropanamine with 1-fluoronaphthalene is conducted in presence of a strong base, such as sodium hydride, in a protic polar solvent, such as DMSO, the dimesyl anion generated under the prior art reaction conditions, becomes a hazardous reaction due to non-compatibility of DMSO with strong bases(NaH, NaOH etc) and also caused partial or complete racemisation of the condensed product.<br>
It has been a long standing need in industry to provide a process for the preparation of Duloxetine which overcomes the problems associated with prior art processes such as usage of sodium hydride in DMSO and the usage of expensive phase transfer catalysts the inventors have developed such a process, which is advantageous in obviating racemisation, so as to yield an enantiomerically pure form of Duloxetine. In particular, our process can be seen to achieve the above described advantage, by carrying out the coupling of (S)-(+)-N, N-dimethyl-3-(2-thienyl)-3-hydroxypropanamine with 1-fluoronaphthalene in presence of base which does not effect the chiral purity of the final product or coupling of N,N-dimethyl-3-(2-thienyl)-3-hydroxypropanamine with 1-fluoronaphthalene in presence of base followed by resolution of the coupled product obtained in the reaction process (thereby obviating the opportunity for racemisation during preceeding intermediate process steps).<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparation of Duloxetine, or an acid addition salt by coupling N, N-dimethyl-3-(2-thienyl)-3-hydroxypropanamine with 1-fluoro naphthalene in presence of an alkoxide in an organic polar solvent followed by resolution and demethylation yields Duloxetine or coupling (S)-(-)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(2-<br><br>
