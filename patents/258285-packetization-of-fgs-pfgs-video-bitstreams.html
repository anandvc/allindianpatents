COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"PACKETIZATION OF FGS/PFGS VIDEO BITSTREAMS"<br>
MICROSOFT CORPORATION, a corporation of the State of Washington<br>
having a place of business at One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington<br>
98052-6399, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to data packetization and, in particular, to<br>
packetization of fine granularity scalable (FGS) and progressive fine granularity<br>
scalable (PFGS) bitstreams.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Due to increasing popularity of multimedia streaming over networks, such<br>
as the Internet, streaming performance is an important issue. Typically, there are<br>
two factors that affect streaming performance. The first is the fact that available<br>
network bandwidth may vary over time depending on the amount of network<br>
traffic. The second is the fact that current delivery processes are not error free,<br>
due to the best-effort nature of the current Internet. This results in data packets<br>
being occasionally lost during transmission. Due to the nature of common video<br>
encoding methods, it is common for data in one data packet to depend on data that<br>
is contained in a previous data packet, accordingly, performance of streaming<br>
video suffers when data packets are not received.<br>
Various video encoding methods can be implemented to address the first<br>
issue, that of varying available bandwidth. Such methods include a fine<br>
granularity scalable (FGS) encoding scheme, a frame-based progressive fine<br>
granularity scalable (PFGS) encoding scheme, and a macroblock-based PFGS<br>
encoding scheme, each of which is an improvement upon the previous in terms of<br>
adapting to available bandwidth variance. Although FGS/PFGS encoding<br>
methods can effectively improve performance of streaming video over networks<br>
with varying bandwidth, they do not address performance decreases caused by lost<br>
data packets.<br>
1<br><br>
Independent development efforts have also focused on ways of improving<br>
the delivery of data packets over a network. This work has shown that<br>
performance improvement has an inverse relationship to the degree of inter-packet<br>
dependency. That is, streams'of data packets that do not depend on one another<br>
result in greater performance than streams of data packets that depend heavily on<br>
one another.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need to establish a method for packetizing<br>
FGS/PFGS encoded video bitstreams such that dependency among the resulting<br>
data packets is minimized.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Packetization of FGS/PFGS video bitstreams to minimize inter-packet<br>
dependency is described. A video encoding system encodes a video stream<br>
according to an FGS/PFGS coding scheme, resulting in encoded bitstream<br>
segments. A set of the encoded bitstream segments is then selected based on each<br>
bitstream segment's total contribution to distortion reduction and based on an<br>
available bandwidth. The selected bitstream segments are then packetized into<br>
data packets such that inter-packet dependency is minimized.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The following discussion is directed to packetization of fine granularity<br>
scalable (FGS) and progressive fine granularity scalable (PFGS) video bitstreams<br>
in order to minimize the impacts of both bandwidth fluctuations and delivery<br>
process errors. FGS and PFGS coding schemes address the negative impacts of<br>
bandwidth fluctuations, while optimal delivery mechanisms are focused on<br>
improving streaming performance by minimizing errors introduced during the<br>
delivery process. Bitstreams with less dependency among packets result in<br>
reduced propagation of delivery errors as compared to bitstreams with more<br>
dependency among packets. Therefore, by optimizing the packetization of<br>
FGS/PFGS coded bitstreams to reduce the dependency among packets, bandwidth<br>
adaptation and optimal delivery can be synergistically integrated,<br>
Exemplary System Architecture and Methods<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary streaming video system 100 that may be<br>
used to encode and packetize video bitstreams. Streaming video system 100<br>
includes video encoding computer system 102 and one or more client devices 104<br>
connected to computer system 102 by network 106. Video encoding computer<br>
system 102 enocdes a video stream according to an FGS or PFGS coding scheme,<br>
and packetizes the encoded video stream according to a packetization scheme to<br>
minimize dependency between packets. Data packets 108 containing the encoded<br>
video stream are then transmitted to client device 104 via network 106.<br>
Video encoding computer system 102 includes processor 110, network<br>
interface 112, and memory 114. Network interface 121 provides a mechanism for<br>
allowing video encoding computer system 102 to communicate with client device<br>
4<br><br>
104 via network 106. FGS/PFGS encoder 116, bitstream selector 118, and packet<br>
generator 120 are stored in memory 114 and executed on processor 110 to<br>
facilitate encoding and packetization of streaming video.<br>
FGS/PFGS encoder 116 encodes a received video stream according to <an></an>
FGS or PFGS encoding scheme. In an exemplary implementation, FGS/PFGS<br>
encoder 116 is implemented as a macroblock-based PFGS encoder. Alternatively,<br>
FGS/PFGS encoder 116 may be implemented as a frame-based PFGS encoder, or<br>
as an FGS encoder. Bitstream selector 118 determines an available bandwidth<br>
associated with network 106, and selects a preferred set of encoded bitstream<br>
segments based on each bitstream's position (frame, bitplane, and macroblock),<br>
required bitrate, and total contribution to distortion reduction. Packet generator<br>
120 packetizes the selected set of encoded bitstream segments according to a<br>
packetization strategy, thereby generating data packets with minimal inter-packet<br>
dependency.<br>
Client device 104 is configured to receive and decode the data packets<br>
generated and tranmitted by video encoding computer system 102. Client device<br>
104 includes processor 122, network interface 124, and memory 126. Network<br>
interface 124 facilitates receipt of data packets 108 from network 106.<br>
FGS/PFGS decoder 128 along with other applications 130 are stored in<br>
memory 126 and executed on process 122. FGS/PFGS decoder 128 is configured<br>
to decode the received, encoded data packets 108 according to the same<br>
FGS/PFGS coding scheme implemented by FGS/PFGS encoder 116. Other<br>
applications 130 may include an application for displaying or otherwise rendering<br>
the decoded video streams using a display device (not shown).<br>
5<br><br>
Streaming Video Encoding Methods<br>
Figures 2-4 illustrate three exemplary methods for encoding video<br>
bitstreams. A fine granularity scalable (FGS) encoding scheme results in two<br>
bitstreams; a low quality base layer, and a high quality enhancement layer. An<br>
FGS encoded frame may be predicted from the base layer of a previous frame. An<br>
exemplary FGS encoding scheme is described in further detail below, with<br>
reference to Figure 2,<br>
A frame-based progressive fine granularity scalable (PFGS) encoding<br>
scheme also results in a low quality base layer and a high quality enhancement<br>
layer. In a PFGS encoded bitstream, a base layer of a frame may be predicted<br>
from the base layer of a previous frame (refered to as the reference frame), while<br>
the enhancement layer of the frame may be predicted from an enhancement layer<br>
of the reference frame. To minimize the propagation of error that may-be caused<br>
by a lost or untransmitted high-quality reference bitstream, a high-quality<br>
reference may alternatively be reconstructed from a previous low-quality<br>
reference. An exemplary frame-based PFGS encoding scheme is described in<br>
further detail below, with reference to Figure 3.<br>
A macroblock-based PFGS encoding scheme improves upon the described<br>
frame-based PFGS encoding scheme by utilizing three coding modes and a<br>
decision-making mechanism for selecting a coding mode to be used for each<br>
enhancement layer macroblock. An exemplary macroblock-based PFGS encoding<br>
scheme is described in further detail below, with reference to Figure 4.<br>
6<br><br>
Fine Granularity Scalable (FGS) Coding Scheme<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an exemplary architecture of an FGS coding scheme.<br>
FGS is a coding scheme that results in a bitstream that can be arbitrarily truncated<br>
based on available bandwidth, such that each truncated version of the bitstream is<br>
still fully decodable. As illustrated in Figure 2, an FGS encoder generates two<br>
bitstreams: the base layer (represented by blocks 202(1), 202(2), 202(3),<br>
202(4), ...) and the enhancement layers (represented by blocks 204(1), 204(2),<br>
204(3), 204(4), ..., 206(1), 206(2), 206(3), 206(4), ,.,, 208(1), 208(2), 208(3),<br>
208(4),...)-<br>
The base layer 202 is coded by traditional motion compensated discrete<br>
cosine transform (DCT), common in other layered coding techniques. The base<br>
layer 202 is typically of low quality and is very thin to ensure that it will fit in<br>
even very small bandwidths. The residue-between the original DCT coefficients<br>
and the dequantized base layer DCT coefficients forms the enhancement bitstream<br>
(204, 206, 208, ...), which is coded using bit-plane coding technology to yield an<br>
embedded bitstream. In an FGS encoded bitstream, the base layer and all<br>
enhancement layers in a predicted frame are coded from a reconstructed version of<br>
the lowest-quality base layer of a reference frame.<br>
Frame-Based PFGS Coding Scheme<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an exemplary architecture of a frame-based progressive<br>
fine granularity scalable (PFGS) coding scheme with two references. PFGS is a<br>
coding scheme that improves upon FGS by predicting a frame's enhancement<br>
Iayer(s) from a reference frame's enhancement layer, while continuing to predict<br>
the frame's base layer from the reference frame's base layer. For example, as<br>
7<br><br>
shown in Figure 3, the base layer of the second frame 302(2) is predicted from<br>
base layer 302(1) of the first frame, and enhancement layers 304(2), 306(2),<br>
308(2), ... of the second frame are predicted from enhancement layer 308(1) of the<br>
first frame. Similarly, the base layer of the third frame 302(3) is predicted from<br>
base layer 302(2) of the second frame, and enhancement layers 304(3), 306(3),<br>
308(3), ... of the third frame are predicted from enhancement layer 306(2) of the<br>
second frame. Because the quality of a frame is higher at an enhancement layer<br>
than it is at the base layer, the frame-based PFGS coding scheme provides more<br>
accurate motion prediction than the FGS scheme, and thus improves the coding<br>
efficiency.<br>
However, when transmitting a PFGS encoded bitstream, a high-quality<br>
enhancement layer reference for predicting future frames may be partially or<br>
completely lost due to truncation caused by a decrease in available-bandwidth. In<br>
such a scenario, the decoder would have to use a corrupted high-quality reference<br>
or a low-quality base layer reference to predict the future frames. Because the<br>
encoder used a high-quality reference to predict the future frames, a drifting error<br>
will likely be introduced. To reduce the drifting errors, the PFGS coding scheme<br>
also incorporates a basic drifting control method of alternatively reconstructing a<br>
high-quality reference from a previous low-quality reference in an event that a<br>
previous high-quality reference is not available. For example, as illustrated in<br>
Figure 3, if enhancement layer 308(2) is corrupted or lost during transmission, a<br>
new high-quality reference 306(2) is alternatively reconstructed from base layer<br>
302(1) and enhancement layer 308(1) of frame 1.<br>
8<br><br>
Macroblock-Based PFGS Coding Scheme<br>
Macroblock-based progressive fine granularity scalable (PFGS) coding is a<br>
coding scheme that improves upon frame-based PFGS by utilizing three coding<br>
modes and a decision-making mechanism for selecting a coding mode-, to be<br>
applied for each enhancement layer macroblock. The three modes are:<br>
low-prediction-low-reconstruction (LPLR), high-prediction-low-reconstruction<br>
(HPLR), and high-prediction-high-reconstruction (HPHR). By selectively<br>
choosing an appropriate mode for each macroblock to be coded, drifting errors are<br>
reduced at low bit rates and coding efficiency is improved at moderate and high bit<br>
rates, when compared to the FGS and frame-based PFGS coding schemes.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the LPLR, HPLR, and HPHR modes of a<br>
macroblock-based PFGS coding scheme. Macroblock 404 is coded using the<br>
LPLR mode, macroblock 406 is coded using the HPLR mode,.and macroblock<br>
408 is coded using the HPHR mode. In Figure 4, prediction is represented by<br>
solid arrows and reconstruction is represented by hollow arrows.<br>
According to the LPLR mode of a macroblock-based PFGS coding scheme,<br>
enhancement layer macroblocks are both predicted and reconstructed from a<br>
previous low quality reference. This is illustrated by the relationship between<br>
macroblock 402 (the reference) and macroblock 404 (the macroblock being<br>
coded). Base layer 404(1) and enhancement layers 404(2), 404(3), 404(4), ..., are<br>
all predicted from base layer 402(1), which is a low-quality reference.<br>
Furthermore, enhancement layer 404(3) is also reconstructed for use as a reference<br>
to future macroblocks from base layer 402(1) (indicated by the hollow arrow).<br>
According to the HPLR mode of a macroblock-based PFGS coding<br>
scheme, enhancement layer macroblocks are predicted from a previous<br>
9<br><br>
high-quality reference, but are reconstructed from a previous low-quality<br>
reference. This is illustrated by the relationship between macroblock 404 (the<br>
reference) and macroblock 406 (the macroblock being coded). Base layer 406(1)<br>
is predicted from base layer 404(1), which is a low-quality reference; while<br>
enhancement layers 406(2), 406(3), 406(4), ..., are predicted from enhancement<br>
layer 404(3), which is a high-quality reference. Enhancement layer 406(3) is<br>
reconstructed for use as a reference to future macroblocks from base layer 404(1)<br>
(indicated by the hollow arrow).<br>
According to the HPHR mode of a macroblock-based PFGS coding<br>
scheme, enhancement layer macroblocks are both predicted and reconstructed<br>
from a previous high-quality reference. This is illustrated by the relationship<br>
between macroblock 406 (the reference) and macroblock 408 (the macroblock<br>
being coded). As in both the LPLR and HPLR: modes, base .layer 408(1) is<br>
predicted from base layer 406(1). Enhancement layers 408(2), 408(3), 408(4), ...,<br>
are predicted from enhancement layer 406(3), which is a high-quality reference.<br>
Furthermore, enhancement layer 408(3) is reconstructed for use as a reference to<br>
future macroblocks from enhancement layer 406(3) (indicated by the hollow<br>
arrow).<br>
Baseline Facketization Strategy<br>
As described above, FGS, frame-based PFGS, and macroblock-based PFGS<br>
are encoding schemes that address the negative impacts of bandwidth fluctuations.<br>
The described encoding schemes, however, do not provide a means for minimizing<br>
the effect of errors caused by packet loss during delivery.<br>
10<br><br>
Figure 5 illustrates the dependencies between FGS/PFGS bit-planes.<br>
According to the dependencies illustrated in Figure 5, a bitstream segment is<br>
decodable only if all of its ancestors (i.e., the bitstream segments belonging to the<br>
same vmacroblock but in the lower bit-planes)-are received and successfully<br>
decoded. For example, bitstream 504 is decodable only if bitstream 502 is<br>
received and successfully decoded. Similarly, bitstream 508 is decodable only if<br>
bitstreams 502, 504, and 506 are received and successfully decoded.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates packetization of two frames according to a baseline<br>
packetization strategy, which results in significant packet dependency. The<br>
illustrated baseline packetization strategy generates packets by scanning and<br>
grouping FGS/PFGS encoded bitstream segments in a raster-scan order, from the<br>
most significant bit plane to the least significant bit plane and from the left to the<br>
right within each bit plane. Whenever a pre-determined packet length is reached, a<br>
packet is formed, and any remaining portion of the bitstream is packetized in a<br>
new packet.<br>
As a result, as illustrated in Figure 6, packets  P1, P3, P4, P6, P7, P10,  P11, P12<br>
and P13 all include data associated with Frame 1. Similarly, packets  P1, P2, P4, P5,<br>
P7, P8, P9, P13, P14, P15, and P16 all include data associated with Frame 2.<br>
Additionally, packets P1, P4, P7, and P13 all contain both data, that is associated<br>
with Frame 1 and data that is associated with Frame 2.<br>
Considering the dependencies between FGS/PFGS bit-planes, as illustrated<br>
in Figure 5, it can then be concluded that the data in packet P3 and at least some of<br>
the data in packet P4 is useless if packet  P1 is not successfully received and<br>
decoded. Similarly, data contained in packets P6 and P7 is useless if packets P1, P3,<br>
and/or P4 are not successfully received and decoded. This can be extrapolated<br>
11<br><br>
further, as follows: if packet P1 is lost, then, because they are dependent on packet<br>
P1, packets P3, P6, P10, P11, and P12 are not decodable, even if they are received<br>
successfully. The lost packet also contaminates packet P4, which may or may not<br>
be partially decodable, depending on the implementation of the decoder. The<br>
contamination of packet P4 also propagates to packets P7, Pg, P9; Pi3, PI4, P15, and<br>
P16. As a result, the loss of packet P1 may render all of the other packets useless,<br>
except for packets P2 and P5.<br>
The significant dependency between packets generated according to the<br>
described baseline packetization strategy is caused, in part, by the fact that there is<br>
no mechanism for aligning packets. A mathematical model for representing the<br>
performance of an encoded bitstream will now be developed and subsequently<br>
used as a basis for establishing two exemplary packetization strategies to reduce<br>
dependency between packets by aligning packets as they are generated.<br>
FGS/PFGS Bitstream Performance Metric<br>
A performance metric of streaming FGS/PFGS bitstreams over a network<br>
(e.g., the Internet) provides a mechanism for comparing alternate bitstream<br>
packetization strategies to determine a packetization strategy that results in<br>
improved performance.<br>
As described above, in both FGS and PFGS coding, the enhancement layer<br>
is encoded using bit-plane coding technology. For each 8x8 DCT block, the 64<br>
absolute values are zigzag ordered into an array. A bit-plane of the block is<br>
defined as an array of 64 bits, one from each absolute value of the DCT<br>
coefficients at the same significant position. For each bit-plane of each<br>
macroblock, (RUN, end-of-bitplane (EOP)) symbols are formed and then the<br>
12<br><br>
variable-length coding (VLC) is applied, together with the sign bits to produce the<br>
output bitstream. After the bit-plane coding, the enhancement layer bitstreams are<br>
generated. These enhancement bitstreams could be separated into many bitstream<br>
segments, each containing the bitstream for one bit-plane of a macroblock. For<br>
the remainder of this discussion, the minimum manipulation unit will be such a<br>
bitstream segment. Because of the bit-plane coding used for producing the<br>
enhancement layer bitstreams, the dependency among bitstream segments<br>
associated with the same macroblock is very strong; whereas, there is no<br>
dependency among bitstream segments associated with different macroblocks.<br>
(As described above, the dependencies between FGS/PFGS bit-planes is illustrated<br>
in Figure 5.)<br>
The mathematical probability that a particular bitstream segment is<br>
decodable can be determined based on this information. To successfully decode a<br>
bitstream segment Si in the ith bit plane, Si must be received without error, and Si-1<br>
(i.e., the bitstream segment that belongs to the same macro block but in the lower<br>
(i-1)th bit plane) must also be decodable. Furthermore, in order for bitstream<br>
segment Si-1 to be decodable, Si-1 must be received and Si-2 must also be decodable,<br>
and so on. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:<br>
p(Si decodable)<br>
= p(Si received, SM decodable)<br>
= p(Si received, 5M received, Si-1 received, ..., S0 received)	(1)<br>
13<br><br>
For example, the decodable probabilities for three bitstream segments, So,<br>
S1, and S2, all belonging to the same macroblock but in the 0th , 1st, and 2nd bit<br>
planes, respectively, may be expressed as follows:<br>
p(S0 decodable) = p(S0 received)<br>
p(S1 decodable)  =p(S1 received, S0 decodable)<br>
= p(S1 received, S0 received)<br>
p(S2 decodable)  = p(S2 received, S1 decodable)<br>
= p(S2 received, S1 received, S0 received)<br>
To simplify the above decodable probabilities, the joint probability<br>
p(Sx received, Sy received) is analyzed. If the bitstream segments Sx and Sy are<br>
packetized into the same packet, packet k, then the joints probability may be<br>
expressed as:<br>
p(Sx received, Sy received)<br>
= p(Sx received) = p(Sy received) = p(packet k received)<br>
If, however, bitstream segments Sx and Sy are packetized into different<br>
packets, packety and packet k, then the joint probability may be expressed as:<br>
p(Sx received, Sy received)<br>
= p(Sx received) x p(Sy received)<br>
= p(packet j received) x p(packet k received)<br>
14<br><br>
Hence, the probability that a bitstream segment is decodable is highly<br>
dependent on how its ancestor bitstream segments are packetized. For further<br>
simplification, a bitstream segment to packet mapping, S1-4 m, is defined to<br>
represent the dependency that packet m must be received in order'to'decode the<br>
received bitstream segment m, where the packet m contains the ancestor bitstream<br>
segment(s) of S, but does not contain S itself. Thus, the decodable probabilities of<br>
S0, S1, and S2 may be expressed as:<br><br>
In addition to different decodable probabilities, different bitstream<br>
segments may also have different contributions to distortion reduction. For a<br>
streaming system, the overall performance can be thought of as the total<br>
end-to-end distortion reduction, provided that a bandwidth constraint (which may<br>
be time-varying) is satisfied. Therefore, in addition to decodable probabilities, the<br>
distortion reduction of each bitstream segment should be considered. Therefore, a<br>
performance metric of streaming FGS/PFGS bitstreams over packet erasure<br>
networks may be defined as:<br><br>
wherein the term (f, l, i) denotes the bitstream segment associated with the fth<br>
frame, lth   bit plane, and ith macroblock.    ∆D(f, l, i) represents the distortion<br>
15<br><br>
reduction that is achieved if (f, l, i) is successfully decoded. pe(m) and pe(f, /, /)<br>
are, respectively, the packet loss probability of the mth packet and the packet<br>
containing the bitstream segment (f, l, i). (f, l, i)-&gt;m denotes the bitstream<br>
segment to packet mapping as presented above. The selected bitstream segments<br>
set, I, represents all enhancement layer bitstream segments that will be transmitted<br>
in the current time slot (which corresponds to a bandwidth adjusting interval). The<br>
transmitting rate of I should satisfy:<br><br>
where ∆R(f, l, i) is the rate of the bitstream segment (f, l, i). B is the current<br>
estimated bandwidth, r is the time slot length and B • r is the estimated available<br>
rate. RBL the bit fate for the base layer bitstream. RARQ and RFEC are,<br>
respectively, the total rates for retransmission and error protection for all packets,<br>
including the base layer and the enhancement layer packets. A packetization<br>
scheme resulting in minimal inter-packet dependence is yielded when 9 is<br>
maximized.<br>
Equation 2 provides a general performance metric that considers the<br>
dependency among bit planes in the enhancement layer bitstream, the dependency<br>
between the base layer and the enhancement layer bitstreams, and also the error<br>
protection on the enhancement layer packets. The influence of error protection is<br>
reflected through pe(•). If unequal error protection (UEP) is adopted, pe's will be<br>
different for different enhancement layer packets. On the other hand, if equal error<br>
protection (EEP) or no error protection is adopted, pe's will be the same for all<br>
enhancement layer packets. Since the enhancement layer bitstream depends on the<br>
16<br><br>
base layer bitstream, which is usually very thin, it is assumed that the base layer<br>
bitstream is transmitted correctly. Furthermore, for the sake of simplicity, no error<br>
protection is applied on the enhancement layer packets.<br>
Accordingly, the performance metric defined above indicates two factors<br>
that should be considered when selecting a packetization system. Firstly, the<br>
bitstream segment set, I, that provides maximum distortion reduction for the<br>
available bandwidth should be selected. (Because the selection is based on the<br>
available bandwidth, the selection of bitstream segment set, I, can be explained in<br>
terms of rate allocation.) Secondly, a packetization strategy should be selected<br>
that minimizes the impact of packet loss (by minimizing the dependency between<br>
packets).<br>
Rate Allocation<br>
For each encoded bitstream segment, if the rate and contribution to<br>
distortion reduction are known, the selection of bitstream segment set, /, can be<br>
converted into a standard Langrangian minimization problem, and a preferred<br>
solution can be found by applying an equal-slope argument. For each FGS or<br>
PFGS enhancement layer bitstream segment, the corresponding rate is explicit,<br>
while its contribution to distortion reduction is not so obvious, especially for<br>
PFGS bitstreams.<br>
17<br><br>
For an FGS bitstream, the contribution of a certain enhancement bitstream<br>
segment consists only of the resultant distortion reduction for the current frame,<br>
and can be calculated precisely (based on the unitary property of the discrete<br>
cosine transform (DCT)) using the number of 1's in the residual bit .plane in .the<br>
DCT domain:<br><br>
where n is the number of 1's of the current iAMB in the /* bit-plane; 7 = 0,1,2,...;<br>
L -1 denotes the index of the bit-plane (/ = 0 denotes the most significant bit-plane<br>
and l - L - 1 denotes the least significant bit plane); and L is the maximum number<br>
of bit planes in the fth frame.<br>
Because a PFGS enhancement layer may be used as a high quality<br>
reference for a future frame, it can cause quality loss of the current frame (as is the<br>
case with an FGS enhancement layer) and can also cause drifting in the<br>
subsequent frames. Therefore, the contribution to distortion reduction of a<br>
particular PFGS bitstream segment is based on two parts: the distortion reduction<br>
for the current frame (as for an FGS bitstream segment) and drifting suppression<br>
for the subsequent frames. The contribution to distortion reduction of a PFGS<br>
bitstream segment may be expressed as:<br><br>
where the terms ∆Do(f, l, i,)  and ∆Ddr (f, l, i,) denote, respectively, the distortion<br>
reduction and drifting suppression of bitstream segment (f, l, i,).<br>
18<br><br>
Directly calculating the drifting suppression (∆Ddr(f, l, i,) is unrealistic in a<br>
practical system due to its extremely high computational complexity, and therefore<br>
must be estimated. Such an estimate will be determined based on an error<br>
propagation pattern associated with a PFGS coding scheme. As described above,<br>
the macroblock based PFGS coding scheme results in better performance than the<br>
frame-based PFGS coding scheme. Accordingly, the estimated drifting<br>
suppression is determined based on the macroblock-based PFGS coding scheme.<br>
As described above with reference to Figures 3 and 4, according to the<br>
PFGS coding scheme, a high-quality reference at an enhancement layer is used for<br>
prediction. As a result, more accurate prediction is obtained and better coding<br>
efficiency is achieved as compared to an FGS coding scheme. On the other hand,<br>
drifting error is introduced if the high-quality reference bitstream is not received<br>
by the decoder (i.e., the encoder and decoder lose synchronization). To suppress<br>
the drifting error, the frame-based PFGS coding scheme restricts the maximal error<br>
propagation by periodically referencing a low-quality reference reconstructed from<br>
the base layer bitstream in both the encoder and the decoder. In this way, the<br>
encoder and the decoder are well synchronized and the drifting error propagation<br>
is well controlled. However, the macroblock-based PFGS coding scheme does not<br>
include a mechanism to guarantee the periodical resynchronization between the<br>
encoder and the decoder, and as a result, drifting errors may continue to propagate.<br>
The drifting error propagation is further complicated by the fact that the<br>
macroblock-based PFGS coding scheme implements three coding modes, namely,<br>
LPLR, HPLR, and HPHR. Drifting errors are not propagated with the LPLR<br>
mode because prediction and reconstruction are both based on a low-quality base<br>
layer reference. With the HPLR mode, prediction errors may be propagated, but<br>
19<br><br>
because reconstruction is based on a low-quality base layer reference, the<br>
prediction error is prevented from propagating further. With the HPHR mode,<br>
because both prediction and reconstruction are based on a high-quality<br>
enhancement layer reference, the prediction error may be propagated further to<br>
future frames.<br>
To estimate the drifting suppression for a particular bitstream segment, it is<br>
assumed that, for each pixel in the current frame, the selection of coding mode<br>
LPLR, HPHR, or HPLR in the next frame is random. Let RHH(f) and RHL(f)<br>
respectively represent the percentage of the HPHR and HPLR modes in the<br>
fth frame. Therefore, for any pixel in the fth frame that is referenced by the<br>
(f + 1)th frame, the probability that it is referenced in HPHR mode is RHH(f + 1),<br>
and the probability that it is referenced in HPLR mode is RHL(f + 1). Hence, the<br>
prediction error will be propagated to the (f + 1)th frame with the probability<br>
RHH(f + 1) + RHL(f + 1) and the RHH(f + 1) portion of the error will continue to<br>
propagate.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates an error propagation model for estimating the drifting<br>
suppression for each bitstream segment based on the assumptions stated above.<br>
For example, if the fth frame, with distortion reduction eo(f) is not received, the<br>
drifting caused to the (f + 1)th frame is approximately eo(f) x RHH(f + 1) and<br>
eo(f) x RHL(f + 1), denoted as e1(f + 1) and e2(f + 1), respectively. Additionally,<br>
e1(f + 1) will be further propagated to the e2(f + 2)th frame in the same way, and so<br>
on.<br>
20<br><br>
Accordingly, the drifting suppression attributed to a particular enhancement<br>
layer reference bitstream segment (f, l, i) can be represented as:<br><br>
where N is the number of frames used for drifting estimation.<br>
It then follows from equations (5) and (6) that the total contribution of<br>
bitstream segment (f, l, i) is:<br><br>
After the rate and total contribution for each enhancement layer bitstream<br>
segment are obtained, the selection of a set of bitstream segments within the<br>
constraint of the available bandwidth can be converted into a standard<br>
Langrangian minimization problem, and a preferred solution can be found by<br>
applying the equal-slope argument.<br>
Packetization Strateeies to Minimize Impact of Packet Loss<br>
As described above; the performance metric defined above in Equation (2)<br>
indicates two factors that should be considered when selecting a packetization<br>
system. First, the bitstream segment set, 7, that provides maximum distortion<br>
reduction for the available bandwidth should be selected, and second, a<br>
packetization strategy should be selected that minimizes the impact of packet loss.<br>
21<br><br>
Selection of bitstream segment set, I, is discussed above, and a discussion of<br>
selecting a packetization strategy follows.<br>
Equation (2) indicates that streaming performance is sensitive to<br>
dependencies between packets. Accordingly, a packetization strategy that results<br>
in less inter-packet dependency will result in better performance. The following<br>
discussion will describes two packetization strategies that may be considered as<br>
alternatives to the baseline packetization strategy (described above with reference<br>
to Figure 6). As described above, the baseline packetization strategy is simple and<br>
straightforward, but introduces heavy dependency among packets. The following<br>
discussion will describe a binary tree packetization strategy that greatly reduces<br>
the dependency among packets, and a packet-independence packetization strategy<br>
that eliminates dependency among packets.<br>
Binary Tree Packetization Strategy<br>
Figure 8 illustrates packetization of two frames according to a binary tree<br>
packetization strategy, which results in significantly less packet dependency than<br>
that found with the baseline packetization strategy described above with reference<br>
to Figure 6. Bitstream segments of FGS enhancement bit planes typically tend to<br>
increase in size approximately exponentially. Accordingly, the enhancement<br>
layers of a frame can be naturally represented by a binary tree wherein each node<br>
represents a segment of the bitstream and the edges represent dependencies. A<br>
well aligned binary tree structure is constructed by aligning a left child to the left<br>
of its parent and aligning a right child to the right of its parent in a top down<br>
fashion.<br>
22<br><br>
As illustrated in Figure 8, the dependency among packets is significantly<br>
reduced. For example, if packet P1 is lost, packets P3, P4, P5, and P6 are also<br>
impacted, but packets P2, P7, P8, P9, and P10 remain fully decodable. A downside<br>
to the binary tree packetization strategy is that the packet size varies from node to<br>
node.<br>
Each node in the binary tree is associated with a (rate, distortion) tuple.<br>
According to the available bit rate, the binary tree is pruned using a rate-distortion<br>
(R-D) criterion to select the nodes that result in the largest distortion reduction for<br>
the given bit rate. For example, for the frames illustrated in Figure 8, some<br>
bitstream segments at the 4th bit-plane are left out. In one implementation, a<br>
preferred transport packet length (e.g., 5 kilo-bits) is defined to allow a parent<br>
node and two child nodes to be grouped together into one transport packet.<br>
Packet-Independence Packetization Strategy<br>
23<br>
Figure 9 illustrates packetization of multiple macroblocks according to a<br>
packet-independence packetization strategy that eliminates dependency between<br>
packets. As discussed above, because of the bit-plane coding used in both FGS<br>
and PFGS coding schemes, there is strong dependency among enhancement layer<br>
bitstreams segments of the same macroblock, but no dependency among bitstream<br>
segments of different macroblocks. Accordingly, the packet-independence<br>
packetization strategy packetizes bitstream segments from all of the bit-planes of<br>
the same macroblock into the same packet. Therefore, the performance metric<br>
defined by Equation (2) can be reduced to:<br><br><br>
where the rate constraint remains unchanged.<br>
As described above, the ∆D(f, l, i) term represents the distortion reduction<br>
that is achieved if (f, l, i) is successfully decoded. Using a macroblock as the<br>
smallest unit, an R-D based selection strategy is applied at the macroblock level.<br>
Each layer of a macroblock is represented by a (rate, distortion) tuple, and for a<br>
given target bit rate, the equal-slope argument in a Langrangian minimization<br>
problem is used to determine which macroblocks, and which layers of each<br>
macroblock should be selected such that the Lagrangian objective function D + AR<br>
is minimized. In other words, regardless which layers and which macroblocks the<br>
bitstream segments are from, only those bitstream segments that result in the most<br>
significant distortion reduction are selected while observing the bandwidth<br>
constraint. As illustrated in Figure 9, different numbers of layers may be selected<br>
for each of the different macroblocks. For example, macroblock 10 includes only<br>
three layers, while macroblocks 0, 3, 6, and 7 each include five layers.<br>
After bitstream selection, packets are generated in such a way that all of the<br>
selected bit-planes of the same macroblock are packetized into the same packet so<br>
as to eliminate packets dependencies. When a pre-determined packet length is<br>
reached, a packet is formed, and any remaining selected bitstreams from other<br>
macroblocks are packetized in new packets. Bitstream segments from multiple<br>
macroblocks may be packetized in the same packet, provided that all selected<br>
bitstream segments from a given macroblock are packetized in the same packet.<br>
As illustrated by the arrows in Figure 9, raster-scan ordering is employed to<br>
facilitate packing the bitstream segments into the same packet. The raster-scan<br>
ordering results in the bitstream segments being packed in order according to their<br>
24<br><br>
R-D contribution from the most important bitstream segment to the least important<br>
bitstream segment.<br>
Methods for Packetization of FGS/PFGS Video Bitstreams<br>
FGS/PFGS video bitstream packetization as performed by a video encoding<br>
computer system 102 may be described in the general context of computer-<br>
executable instructions, such as application modules, being executed by a<br>
computer. Generally, application modules include routines, programs, objects,<br>
components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement<br>
particular abstract data types. An FGS/PFGS video bitstream packetization<br>
system may be implemented using any number of programming techniques and<br>
may be implemented in local computing environments or in distributed computing<br>
environments where tasks are performed by remote processing 'devices- that are<br>
linked through various communications networks based on any number of<br>
communication protocols. In such a distributed computing environment,<br>
application modules may.be located in both local and remote computer storage<br>
media including memory storage devices.<br>
Figure 10 illustrates an exemplary method for encoding and packetizing<br>
video streams. For illustrative purposes, Figure 10 will be described with<br>
reference to components illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
At block 1002, a video stream is encoded according to an FGS/PFGS<br>
coding scheme. For example, FGS/PFGS encoder 116 of video encoding<br>
computer system 102 receives a video stream to be encoded, and applies a<br>
macroblock-based PFGS coding scheme, resulting in a set of encoded video<br>
bitstream segments (e.g., as described with reference to Figure 4).<br>
25<br><br>
At block 1004, video encoding computer system 102 gathers data<br>
associated with a position, a required bitrate, and total contribution to distortion<br>
reduction for each encoded bitstream segment. In one implementation, the data is<br>
gathered as part 6f the encoding process (described with reference to block 1002).<br>
Alternatively, the data may be gathered during a separate process after the<br>
bitstream segments are encoded. An exemplary method for gathering data during<br>
an FGS/PFGS encoding process is described in more detail below with reference<br>
to Figure 11.<br>
At block 1006, bitstream selector 118 determines a set of bitstream<br>
segments for packetization. In the described implementation, the set of bitstream<br>
segments is selected based on each bitstream's position (frame, bitplane, and<br>
macro block), required bitrate, and total contribution to distortion reduction. An<br>
exemplary method for selecting a set of bitstream segments is described in further<br>
detail below with reference to Figure 12.<br>
At block 1008, packet generator 120 packetizes the selected set of bitstream<br>
segments according to a packetization strategy to minimize inter-packet<br>
dependency. One implementation utilizes the described binary tree packetization<br>
strategy, while an alternate implementation utilizes the described<br>
packet-independence packetization strategy. In one implementation, raster-scan<br>
ordering is employed such that the selected" bitstream segments are ordered within<br>
a packet according to their contribution to distortion reduction, from the most<br>
important bitstream segment to the least important bitstream segment.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates an exemplary method 1004 for gathering data<br>
associated with a position, a required bitrate, and total contribution to distortion<br>
reduction for each encoded bitstream segment.<br>
26<br><br>
At block 1102, FGS/PFGS encoder 116 gathers position data (including<br>
which frame, which bitplane, and which macroblock) for each encoded bitstream<br>
segment. The position is readily available to the encoder during the encoding<br>
process, and is easily recorded.<br>
At block 1104, FGS/PFGS encoder 116 determines a percentage of HPHR<br>
modes and HPLR modes for each enhancement layer bitstream segment in the<br>
current frame. (If encoding based on an FGS coding scheme, both of these values<br>
are equal to zero.)<br>
At block 1106, FGS/PFGS encoder 116 calculates a required bitrate and a<br>
total contribution to distortion reduction for each encoded enhancement layer<br>
bitstream segment. In the described implementation, the drifting suppression is<br>
initialized to zero for each bitstream segment that is not used as a high quality<br>
reference, because no drifting distortion will be propagated to future'frames. This<br>
data is saved to a buffer for use in determining future drifting estimations.<br>
An estimated drifting contribution is then calculated for each enhancement<br>
layer bitstream segment that is used as a high quality reference. A relatively small<br>
number of frames can be used to estimate the drifting suppression due to the fact<br>
that drifting is attenuated as distance between frames increases. In the described<br>
implementation a group of N frames (e.g., 10) is used to compute an estimated<br>
drifting suppression. For every previous frame (within the distance of N frames)<br>
the drifting suppression associated with the frame is estimated and updated based<br>
on the percentages of HPHR and HPLR modes in the current frame. The drifting<br>
suppression is then accumulated to the toal contribution.<br>
27<br><br>
At block 1108, after all N frames of drifting suppression have been<br>
estimated, the gathered data is output to a side information file to be used to select<br>
a set of bitstream segments for packetization.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates an exemplary method for selecting a set of bitstream<br>
segments to be packetized.<br>
At block 1202, bitstream selector 118 estimates an available bandwidth<br>
associated with network 106 for a particular time slot.<br>
At block 1204, bitstream selector 118 determines a number (M) of frames<br>
to be transmitted based on the frame rate, which is an intrinsic charasteric of a<br>
video stream.<br>
At block 1204, bitstream selector 118 loads the data stored in the side<br>
information file. (This includes a position, a required bitrate, and a total<br>
contribution to distortion reduction for each encoded bitstream segment.)<br>
At block 1206, bitstream selector 118 examines the rates and contributions<br>
to distortion reduction for different bit-planes of the same macroblock to verify<br>
that the R-D curve is convex, which ensures that a solution to the previously<br>
defined Lagrangian minimization problem can be obtained.<br>
At block 1208, bitstream selector 118 selects a set of bitstream segments for<br>
each macroblock based on the equal-slope argument of a standard Lagrangian<br>
minimization problem.<br>
