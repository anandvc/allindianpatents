				<td>-Transport Protein I Used to Interduce| Compounds into Nerve Cells<br>
The present invention relates to a transport protein which binds to neurons, is<br>
accommodated by receptor-mediated endocytosis and is translocated from the<br>
acid, endosomal compartment into the cytosol of neurons. This protein is used as<br>
a transporting means for translocating other chemical substances (e. g.<br>
proteases), which are unable physiologically to penetrate into the cytosol of<br>
nerve cells through the plasma membrane. The present invention relates to the<br>
use of a transport protein for inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters.<br>
Nerve cells release transmitter substances by exocytosis. The fusion of the<br>
membranes of intracellular vesicles with the plasma membrane is referred to as<br>
exocytosis. In the course of this process the vesicular contents is simultaneously<br>
discharged into the synaptic gap. The fusion of the two membranes is regulated<br>
by calcium, reacting with the protein synaptotagmin. Together with other cofactors<br>
synaptotagmin controls the status of three so-called fusion proteins,<br>
SNAP-25, synaptobrevin 2 and syntaxin 1A. While syntaxin 1A and<br>
synaptobrevin 2 are integrated into the plasma and/or vesicle membrane, SNAP-<br>
25 binds only Bghtfy to the plasma membrane. To the extent that the intracellular<br>
calcium concentration increases, the three proteins bind to one another, both<br>
membranes approaching one another and subsequently fusing together. In the<br>
case of choiinergic neurons acetyl choline is released, causing muscle<br>
contractions, perspiration and other cholinergically provoked reactions.<br>
The above mentioned fusion proteins are the target molecules (substrates) of the<br>
light chains of the clostridial neurotoxins, formed by the bacterium Clostridium<br>
botuiinum.<br>
The anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium Clostridium botuiinum produces seven<br>
different types of protein neurotoxins. The latter are referred to as the Botulinus<br>
neurotoxins (BoNT/A to BoNT/G). Among these, in particular BoNT/A and<br>
BoNT/B cause a neuroparalytic disorder in humans and animals, referred to as<br>
botulism. The spores of Ciostridium botu/inum can be found in the soil, but may<br>
also develop in incorrectly sterilised and sealed home-made food preserves, to<br>
which many cases of botulism are attributed.<br>
BoNT/A is the most lethal of all known biological substances. As little as 5-6 pg of<br>
purified BoNT/A represents an MLD (Multiple Low Dose). One unit (Engl.: Unit,<br>
U) of BoNT is defined as the MLD, killing half of the female Swiss Webster mice,<br>
each weighing 18 - 20 g, after intraperitoneal injection. Seven immunologically<br>
different BoNTs were characterised. They are denoted as BoNT/A, B, Ci, D, E, F<br>
and G and may be distinguished by neutralisation with serotype-specific<br>
antibodies. The different serotypes of BoNTs differ in affected animal species<br>
with regard to severity and duration of the paralysis caused. Thus, with regard to<br>
paralysis, BoNT/A is 500 times more potent in rats for example, than BoNT/B. In<br>
addition, BoNT/B has proved to be non-toxic in primates at a dosage of 480 U/kg<br>
of body weight. The same quantity of BoNT/A corresponds to 12 times the lethal<br>
dose (LD) of this substance in primates. On the other hand, the duration of<br>
paralysis after BoNT/A injection in mice is ten times longer than after injection of<br>
BoNT/E.<br>
BoNTs have been used clinically for treating neuromuscular disorders,<br>
characterised by hyperactivity in skeleton muscles, caused by pathologically<br>
overactive peripheral nerves. BoNT/A has been approved by the U.S. Food and<br>
Drug Administration for treating blepharo-spasm, strabism and hemi-facial<br>
spasms. Compared with BoNT/A the remaining BoNT serotypes are evidently<br>
less efficacious and manifest a shorter duration of efficacy. Clinical effects of<br>
BoNT/A administered peripheral-intramuscularly are usually noticeable within a<br>
week. The duration of symptom suppression by one single intramuscular<br>
injection of BoNT/A is normally about 3 months.<br>
The clostridial neurotoxins specifically hydrolyse different proteins of the fusion<br>
apparatus. BoNT/A, Ci and E split SNAP-25, while BoNT/B, D, F, G as well as<br>
tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) attack the vesicle-associated membrane protein<br>
(VAMP) 2 - also referred to as synaptobrevin 2 -. BoNT/Ci furthermore splits<br>
syntaxin 1A.<br>
The Clostridium bacteria release the neurotoxins as single-chain polypeptides<br>
each having 1251 to 1315 amino acids. Thereafter endogenous proteases split<br>
each of these proteins at a defined location into 2 chains each ('nicking'), the two<br>
chains however remaining interlinked by a disulphide-bridge. These dual-chain<br>
proteins are referred to as holo-toxins (see Shone et al. (1985), Eur J Biochem<br>
151, 75-82). The two chains have different functions. While the smaller fragment,<br>
the light chain (light chain = LC), represents a Zn2+-dependent endoprotease, the<br>
larger unit (heavy chain = HC) represents the transporting means of the light<br>
chain. By treating the HC with endopeptidases two 50 kDa fragments were<br>
brought about (see Gimenez et al. (1993), J Protein Chem 12, 351-363). The<br>
amino-terminal half (Hm-fragment) integrates into membranes at a low pH-value<br>
and enables the LC to penetrate into the cytosol of the nerve cell. The carboxyterminal<br>
half (He-fragment) binds to complex polysialogangltosides, occurring<br>
exclusively in nerve cell membranes and to protein receptors not identified to<br>
date (Halpern et al. (1993), Curr Top Microbial Immunol 195, 221-241). The<br>
latter explains the high neuroselectivity of the clostridial neurotoxins. Crystalline<br>
structures confirm that BoNT/A disposes of three domains, which may be<br>
harmonised by the three steps of the action mechanism (see Lacy et al. (1998),<br>
Nat Struct Biol 5, 898-902). Moreover, these data give rise to the conclusion that<br>
within the He-fragment two autonomous subunits (sub-domains) exist of 25 kDa<br>
each. The first proof for the existence of the two functional sub-domains was<br>
brought about by the amino-terminal (HCN and the carboxy-terminal half (HCc) of<br>
the He-fragment of the TeNT, which were expressed in recombinant form and<br>
which revealed that the HCC-, but not the HCN domain binds to neurons (see<br>
Herreros et al. (2000), Biochem J 347, 199-204). The protein receptor-binding<br>
site of the synaptotagmin was discovered inside the Hcc-domains of BoNT/B and<br>
G, proving their separate functionality (see Rummel et al. (2004), J Biol Chem<br>
279, 30865-70).<br>
Under physiological conditions the HC binds to neuronal gangliosides, is<br>
received inside the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and reaches the<br>
natural vesicle circulation via the endosomal compartment. In the acid medium of<br>
the early endosomes, HN, the amino-terminal half of HC, penetrates into the<br>
vesicle membrane and forms a pore. Each substance (X), linked to HC via a<br>
disulphide bridge, will be split off the HC by intracellular redox systems, gaining<br>
access to the disulphide bridge and reducing it. X will ultimately appear in the<br>
cytosol.<br>
In the case of the ciostridial neurotoxins the HC is the carrier of an LC, splitting<br>
its specific substrate in the cytosol in the final step. The cycle of complex<br>
formation and dissociation of the fusion proteins is interrupted and the release of<br>
acetyl choline is consequently inhibited. As a result thereof, striated muscles are<br>
paralysed and sweat glands cease their secretion. The active period of the<br>
individual BoNT serotypes differs and depends on the presence of intact LC in<br>
the cytosol. As all neurons possess receptors for ciostridial neurotoxins, it is not<br>
only the release of acetyl choline which may be affected, but potentially also the<br>
release of the substance P, of noradrenalin, GABA, glycine, endorphin and other<br>
transmitters and hormones.<br>
That the cholinergic transmission is blocked preferentially, may be explained by<br>
the fact that the HC in the periphery enters into the neuron. Central synapses are<br>
protected by the blood-brain-barrier, which cannot be surmounted by proteins.<br>
The HCs possess a high affinity for peripheral nerve cells, mediated<br>
predominantly by the interaction with complex polysialogangliosides - these are<br>
glycol lipids composed of more than one sialine acid (see Halpern et al. (1995),<br>
Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 195, 221-41). As a result, the LCs binding to them<br>
reach only this cell type and become active only in these cells. BoNT/A and B<br>
bind merely one molecule ganglioside GT1b each.<br>
In order to research the role played by the amino acids, which build the binding<br>
pocket, a recombinant He-fragment was produced according to the invention.<br>
This technique permits to exchange individual amino acids. Thus, positivelycharged<br>
amino acids may be substituted by negatively-charged or neutral amino<br>
acids, and vice versa. Slight modifications in the surface of the binding pocket<br>
produce no dramatic effect regarding the passing ability of the gangliosides. It<br>
could be shown that the affinity receded by more than 99%, if e.g. the amino acid<br>
in position 1266, the tryptophane - referred to as W in the SXWY-motive - is<br>
substituted by an aliphatic residue, e.g. leucine. However, the contrary has also<br>
been observed, The substitution of amino acids, extending into the binding<br>
pocket, resulted in an increase of the affinity to gangliosides. Since the<br>
configuration of the binding pocket is so decisive for the affinity of the HC to the<br>
ganglioside receptor, the proteolytic potency of the associated LC,<br>
simultaneously with the affinity of the HC to the ganglioside receptor, either<br>
increases or decreases in harmony with the affinity.<br>
In a ligand-receptor-study specific amino acid residues were thus characterised<br>
according to the invention in the ganglioside-binding pocket of BoNT/A and<br>
substituted in order to increase the affinity to the ganglioside receptor accordingly.<br>
The affinity of the mutated He-fragment was determined in ganglioside and<br>
synaptosome-binding assays. Subsequently, the HC exhibiting the same<br>
mutations was coupled to LC-A, for which purpose a thrombin-sensitive amino<br>
acid sequence was used. The recombinant protein was activated ('nicked') by<br>
thrombin and resulted in a double-chain molecule, both chains being interlinked<br>
by a single disulpUide bridge. The activity of the constructs was tested in<br>
synaptosomes of rat brain - a preparation releasing transmitters. The extent of<br>
transmitter release inhibition was considered as the measure of the degree of<br>
activity of the constructs. In addition, the potency of the individual constructs was<br>
analysed by means of the isolated nerve-muscle-preparation of the mouse<br>
(Hemi-Diaphragma-Assay = HDA), representing the physiological object of<br>
clostridial neurotoxins.<br>
Disorders and symptoms which are to be treated with TrapoX are accompanied<br>
by a focally increased activity of motor neurons and vegetative nerve cells. The<br>
increased activity results in painful cramps of the muscles innerved by these cells<br>
and in an excessive liquid secretion from gland cells. Furthermore, facial wrinkles<br>
occur in different regions due to the increased activity. The cause is a<br>
pathologically increased release of acetyl choline from the peripheral nerve ends.<br>
If TrapoX is injected into the affected muscle, a relaxation of the affected muscles,<br>
the drying up of secretion and smoothing of the facial skin comes about after a<br>
latency of 1-3 days. This is due to an inhibition of the release of acetyl choline by<br>
TrapoX. The patient becomes virtuaJly pain-free and the pain provoked by the<br>
muscle cramp is alleviated and disappears completely.<br>
The release of acetyl choline is inhibited both in humans as well as in animals.<br>
Animal testing is therefore used routinely both as evidence of BoNT in poisoning<br>
cases as well as for activity determination of BoNT-drugs (Botox, Dysport,<br>
Xeomin). The activity of BoNT is quantified by performing a determination of the<br>
LDso in mice. In this context one determines the dose, killing 50% of the animals<br>
of one test group. It is obvious that apart from doses not destroying any animal,<br>
doses may be administered killing 100% of the animals from one group. Since<br>
the poison is administered systemically (i.p.), a large number of animals thus die<br>
painfully of respiratory arrest, caused by a paralysis of the respiratory muscles. In<br>
order to avoid animal tests, we have introduced the Mouse Hemi-Diaphragma<br>
Assay. With the LD50 test, trial mice die of respiratory paralysis, caused by<br>
paralysis of the respiratory muscles. This means that the respiratory muscle,<br>
including the innerving nerve (Nervus phrenicus) can be removed from the<br>
mouse and be poisoned in vitro. BoNT will bind to its receptors, will enter the cell<br>
and be translocated and will finally split its substrate, whereupon the muscle<br>
paralyses. There is a strict correlation between the LDso value and the paralysis<br>
of the respiratory muscle. This in vitro test represents, as it were, a watereddown<br>
version of the animal test (Wohlfarth K, Goeschel H, Frevert J, Dengler R,<br>
Bigalke H, Botolinum A toxis: units versus units. Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch<br>
Pharmacol, 1997 Mar; 335(3):335-40).<br>
One can therefore assume that the BoNT, paralysing the diaphragm in vitro, also<br>
acts in the living mouse, killing the latter according to the dose administered. This<br>
animal test replacement method is so convincing that the Mouse Hemi-<br>
Diaphragma-Assay will shortly be accepted for the EU member states by the ED<br>
Pharmacopoeia as the official testing method for BoNT. The increased efficacy of<br>
TrapoX in the mouse diaphragm preparation thus suggests an increased efficacy<br>
in humans as well.<br>
In the more recent past, the BoNT/A complex was used for treating motor<br>
dystonias, as well as for attenuating excessive sympathetic activity (see Benecke<br>
et al. (1995), Akt Neural 22, 209ff) and for alleviating pain and migraine (see<br>
Sycha et al. (2004), J Neural 251,19-30). This complex consists of the<br>
neurotoxin, various haemagglutinines and a non-toxic, non-haemagglutinating<br>
protein. The complex dissociates rapidly at physiological pH. The resultant<br>
neurotoxin is the sole ingredient of the complex which is therapeutically relevant<br>
and brings about an alleviation of the symptoms. Since the underlying<br>
neurological illness is not cured, the complex needs to be injected again at<br>
intervals of three to four months. Depending on the quantity of the injected<br>
foreign protein, some patients develop specific BoNT/A-antibodies, These<br>
patients become resistant to the neurotoxin. Once antigen-sensitive cells have<br>
recognised the neurotoxin and antibodies have been formed, the relevant brain<br>
cells are conserved over years. For this reason it is important to treat the patient<br>
with preparations of the highest possible activity at the lowest possible dosage.<br>
The preparations should furthermore not contain any further proteins of bacterial<br>
origin, since these may act as immuno-adjuvants. Such substances attract<br>
macrophages, which recognise both the immuno-adjuvants as well as the<br>
neurotoxins, presenting them to the lymphocytes, which thereupon respond by<br>
forming immunoglobulins. Consequently, only products of extreme purity, not<br>
containi ng any foreign proteins, may be used for therapy.<br>
The present invention now provides a transport protein (Trapo), which is able to<br>
overcome the above described problems of the methods known to date.<br>
Preferably, a transport protein (Trapo) is provided, the affinity of which to<br>
complex; gangliosides is increased at least three fold.<br>
"Binding to nerve cells with a higher affinity than native neurotoxin". The native<br>
neurotoxin is in this case preferably the native neurotoxin of C. botulinum.<br>
Preferably, the native neurotoxin is in this context Botulinus neurotoxin A and/or<br>
Botulinus neurotoxin B and/or Botulinus neurotoxin G from C. botulinum. The<br>
Botulinu s neurotoxin prepared in recombinant form from Â£. coli, which, inter alia,<br>
contains the amino acid sequence identical to the native Botulinus neurotoxin,<br>
acts in a pharmacologically identical manner to the native Botulinus neurotoxin<br>
and is referred to as recombinant Botulinus neurotoxin wild type. The nerve cells<br>
mentioned in this case are cholinergic motor neurons. Preferably, the transport<br>
protein binds specifically to polysialogangliosides on the nerve cell membrane<br>
surface, such as e.g. GD1a, GD1b or GT1b. The binding is determined<br>
preferably in vitro. Particularly preferably, the determination is performed by the<br>
use of a n assay, elucidated in detail in the examples.<br>
The term "modification of the heavy chain of the neurotoxin formed by C.<br>
botulinum." The amino acid and/or nucleic acid sequence of the heavy chain (HC)<br>
of the neurotoxin formed by C, botulinum are generally available from publicly<br>
accessible databases, for each of the known serotypes A to G (also refer to table<br>
1). Modification includes in this context that at least one amino acid is deleted,<br>
added, is inserted into the amino acid sequence, or that at least one amino acid<br>
of the native neurotoxin is substituted by another naturally occurring or not<br>
naturally occurring amino acid and/or that one amino acid in the stated amino<br>
acid sequence is modified post-translationally. Post-translational modifications<br>
include in this context glycosylations, acetylations, acylations, de-aminations,<br>
phosphorylisations, isoprenylisations, glycosyl phosphatidyl inositolisations and<br>
further modifications known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The HC of the neurotoxin formed by C. botulinum includes three sub-domains, i.e.<br>
the amino-terminal 50 kDa-sized translocation domain HN, the 25 kDa HCNdomain<br>
following thereon, and the carboxyl-terminally situated 25 kDa Hccdomain.<br>
Together, the HCN- and Hcc-domains are denoted as He-fragment. The<br>
corresponding amino acid sections of the respective sub-domains for the<br>
individual serotypes and their variations are apparent from Table 1.<br>
In order to describe in detail hybrid proteins with domains of different BoNT<br>
serotypes, the following nomenclature is introduced in what follows. The term<br>
scAtAAB denotes e.g. a single-chain neurotoxin (sc), consisting of the four<br>
domains LC, HN, HCN and Hcc- each domain, according to its origin, being<br>
marked by the capital letter of the respective serotype. This means that scAtAAB<br>
is derived from LC, HN and HCN, while the Hcc-domain of BoNT/A was substituted<br>
by BoNT/B. The small letter "t" symbolises an inserted thrombin marker<br>
sequence between LC and HN.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The present invention relates, in particular, to a transport protein, obtained by<br>
modifying the HC of the neurotoxin formed by Clostridium botulinum, the said<br>
protein, with a higher affinity than the native neurotoxin, binding specifically to<br>
nerve cells and being received by these cells by endocytosis.<br>
The transport protein provided in the present invention exhibits an increased<br>
specific affinity of its ganglioside-binding domain to complex<br>
polysialogangiiosides. The increase of the affinity is preferably attained by<br>
substitution or deletion of amino acids.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the transport protein exhibits an affinity<br>
which is at least 15% higher than the native neurotoxin. Preferably, the transport<br>
protein exhibits an affinity which is at least 50% higher, particularly preferably at<br>
least 80% higher and in particular at least 90% higher than the native neurotoxin.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the modification of the HC takes place in<br>
the region of the He-fragment of the given neurotoxin. If the modification includes<br>
a substitution, deletion, insertion or addition, the latter may also be performed, for<br>
example, by specific mutagenesis, methods in this context being known to the<br>
person skilled in the art. The amino acids present in the native neurotoxin are in<br>
this context modified either by naturally occurring or by not naturally occurring<br>
amino acids. Amino acids are, in principle, divided into different physicochemical<br>
groups. Aspartate and glutamate belong to the negatively-charged amino acids.<br>
Histidine, arginine and lysine belong to the positively-charged amino acids.<br>
Aspargine, glutamine, serine, threonine, cysteine and tyrosine belong to the polar<br>
amino acids. Glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, proline,<br>
phenylalanine and tryptophane belong to the non polar amino acids. Aromatic<br>
side groups are to be found among the amino acids histidine, phenylalanine,<br>
tyrosine and tryptophane. In general, it is preferred to substitute an amino acid by<br>
a different amino acid pertaining to another physicochemical group.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the transport protein is a<br>
Botulinus neurotoxin serotype A to G.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the transport protein is derived from<br>
the protein sequence of the clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type A (database no.<br>
AAA23262 and CAA51824).<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention relates to a transport protein,<br>
wherein at least one amino acid in the positions 1117, 1202 to 1204, 1252 to<br>
1254, 1262 to 1267, 1270 and 1278 to 1279 of the protein sequence of the<br>
Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type A (database no. AAA23262 and<br>
CAA51824) has either been removed or been substituted by a naturally occurring<br>
or not naturally occurring amino acid.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention relates to a transport protein,<br>
wherein amino acids in positions 1092 to 1296 of the protein sequence of the<br>
Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type A (database no. AAA23262 and<br>
CAA51824) - a region including the ganglioside-binding domain - have been<br>
substituted by the sequence of<br>
Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type B protein (database no. AAA23211),<br>
amino acids 1079 to 1291,<br>
Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type Ci protein (database no. CAA51313),<br>
amino acids 1093 to 1291<br>
Clostridium hotulinum neurotoxin type D protein (database no. CAA38175),<br>
amino acids 1080 to 1276,<br>
Clostridium hotulinum neurotoxin type E protein (database no. CAA44558),<br>
amino acids 1067 to 1252,<br>
Clostridium butyricum neurotoxin type E protein (database no. CAA43998),<br>
amino acids 1067 to 1251,<br>
Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type F protein (database no. CAA57358),<br>

Clostridium baratii neurotoxin type F protein (database no. CAA48329),<br>

Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type G protein (database no. CAA52275),<br>
amino acids 1087 to 1297.<br>
Further Hcc-domains suitable for interchangeability with amino acid positions are<br>
apparent from Table 1.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention relates to a composition containing<br>
a transport protein according to the invention and at least one intervening<br>
molecule (X). The intervening molecule may be a small organic molecule, a<br>
peptide or a protein; preferably covalently bonded, e.g. by a peptide-, ester-,<br>
ether-, sulphide-, disulphide- or carbon-carbon-bond.<br>
In addition, the intervening molecule includes all known therapeutically active<br>
substances, Cytostatics, antibiotics, virustatics, but also immunoglobulins are<br>
preferred in this context.<br>
In order to better utilise the increased affinity of the Trapo, it was bound aminoterminally<br>
to an LC of BoNT/A, B, C-i, D, E, F or G via an amino acid sequence,<br>
which is specifically recognised and split by the protease thrombin, bringing<br>
about a specific TrapoX. The active strength of the said TrapoX, in comparison<br>
with native BoNT/A, was increased and particularly preferred by a factor of at<br>
least 3. This new product, which is free of foreign proteins, will dramatically<br>
reduce the stimulation of the immune systems due to the greater purity of the<br>
material and the low dosage.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention relates to a transport protein,<br>
wherein the protein is a protease, splitting one or a plurality of proteins of the<br>
release apparatus of neurotransmitters, the protease being selected from the<br>
group of neurotoxins consisting of the LC of the Clostridium botulinum<br>
neurotoxins, in particular of type A, B, d, D, E, F and G or a proteolytically active<br>
fragment of the LC of a Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin, in particular a<br>
neurotoxin of serotype A, B, CL D, E, F and G, the fragment exhibiting at least<br>
0,01% of the proteolytic activity of the native protease, preferably at least 5%,<br>
particularly preferably at least 50%, in particular at least 90%. Preferably, the<br>
transport protein and the protease are derived from the same C. botulinum<br>
neurotoxin serotype, in particular and preferably the HN-domain of the transport<br>
protein and the protease are derived from the C. botulinum neurotoxin serotype A.<br>
The sequences of the proteases are generally accessible at databases and the<br>
database numbers are apparent from Table 1. The proteolytic activity of the<br>
proteases is determined by way of substrate separation kinetics (see Bina et al.<br>
(2002), Biochemistry 41 (6), 1717-23).<br>
The LCs are characterised in that they contain the sequence His-Glu-Leu-Xaa-<br>
His-(Xaa)33.36-Glu(Xaa)84.9o-Glu-(Xaa)ii-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Tyr, wherein Xaa may be<br>
any amino acid. The transport protein of the present invention is characterised in<br>
that the protein and the protease stem from the previous groups of proteins<br>
and/or proteases.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present invention, a method for<br>
producing the transport protein is provided. In this case, in a first step a nucleic<br>
acid coding for the transport protein is provided. The coding nucleic acid may<br>
represent in this context RNA, DMA or mixtures thereof. The nucleic acid may<br>
furthermore be modified with regard to its nuclease resistance, such as e.g. by<br>
inserting phosphorthioate bonds. The nucleic acid may be produced from a<br>
starting nucleic acid, the latter being accessible e.g. by cloning from genomic or<br>
cDNA-databases. Moreover, the nucleic acid may be produced directly by solid<br>
phase synthesis. Suitable methods are known to the person skilled in the art. If<br>
one assumes a starting nucleic acid, a specific modification, e.g. by localityspecific<br>
mutagenesis, may be brought about, resulting in at least one addition,<br>
insertion, deletion and/or substitution on the amino acid level. The nucleic acid is<br>
then linked operatively to a suitable promoter. Suitable promoters for expression<br>
in known expression systems are known to the person skilled in the art. The<br>
choice of promoter depends in this case on the expression systems used for<br>
expression, in general, constitutive promoters are preferred, but inducible<br>
promoters may likewise be used. The construct produced in this manner includes<br>
at least one part of a vector, in particular regulatory elements, the vector, for<br>
example, being selected from X-derivates, adenoviruses, baculoviruses, vaccinia<br>
viruses, SV40-viruses and retroviruses. The vector is preferably capable of<br>
expressing the nucleic acid in a given host ceil.<br>
The invention further provides host cells, which contain the vector and are<br>
suitable for expressing the vector. Numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic<br>
expression systems are known in the state of the art, the host cells being<br>
selected, for example, from prokaryotic cells such as E. coli or B. megaterium,<br>
from eukaryotic cells such as S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris. Although higher<br>
eukaryotic cells, such as insect cells or mammal cells, may be used as well, host<br>
cells are nevertheless preferred, which, like C. botulinum, do not possess a<br>
glycosylation apparatus.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the nucleic acid codes for the Hcc-domain<br>
of the C. botulinum neurotoxin. This nucleic acid contains endonucleaseinterfaces,<br>
flanking the nucleic acid coding for the He-fragment, the<br>
endonuclease sites being compatible with those of other He-fragments of C.<br>
Doiunnum neurotoxins, in order to permit their easy modular substitution in the<br>
gene coding for the transport protein, while the similarity of the amino acid<br>
sequence is preserved.<br>
If a composition according to the invention is provided, which, apart from the<br>
transport system, further contains at least one intervening molecule, and this<br>
intervening molecule, a peptide or protein, is functionalised either with a carboxyterminal<br>
cysteine or a mercapto-group, then, in an analogous manner, as<br>
described before, the peptide and/or protein may be produced recombinantly, for<br>
example by using binary vectors or various host cells. If the same host cell is<br>
used for the expression both of the transport protein and the peptide or protein,<br>
an intermolecular disulphide bond is preferably formed in situ. For a more<br>
efficient production in the same host cell, the nucleic acid coding for the peptide<br>
or protein may also be translated with that of the transport protein in the same<br>
reading frame, so that a single-chain polypeptide is produced. In this case<br>
preferably an intramolecular disulphide bond is formed in situ. For simple<br>
hydrolysis of the likewise present peptide cross-linking between the transport<br>
protein and the peptide and/or protein, an amino acid sequence is inserted at the<br>
amino-terminus of the transport protein, which is either specifically recognised<br>
and separated by the protease thrombin or by a specific endoprotease of the<br>
host cell.<br>
If this is not possible, an appropriate intermolecular disulphide-linkage, after<br>
separate purification of the transport protein and the protein, may subsequently<br>
be brought about by oxidation processes known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The peptide or protein may also be obtained directly by synthesis or fragment<br>
condensation. Appropriate methods are known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The transport protein and the peptide, or protein respectively, are subsequently<br>
purified. For this purpose methods are used, known to the person skilled in the<br>
art, such as e.g. chromatography-methods or electrophoresis,<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention relates to the pharmaceutical<br>
composition, including the transport protein and optionally a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient, a diluent and/or an additive and which is suitable to treat<br>
the following disorders or diseases: hemt-facial spasms, spasmodic torticollis,<br>
spasticities, dystonias, migraine, pain, disorders of the neck and lumbar vertebral<br>
column, strabism, hypersalivation and depressive diseases.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition is suitable for oral, intravenous, subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular and topical administration. Intramuscular administration is<br>
preferred. A dosing unit of the pharmaceutical composition contains<br>
approximately 0,1 pg to 1 mg of transport protein and/or the composition<br>
according to the invention.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention includes a cosmetic composition,<br>
consisting of the transport protein and a pharmaceutical excipient, a diluent<br>
and/or an additive, suitable for treating hyperhydrosis and very pronounced facial<br>
wrinkles. The cosmetic composition is suitable for oral, intravenous,<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular and topical administration. Intramuscular<br>
administration is preferred. A dosing unit of the cosmetic composition contains<br>
about 0,1 pg to 1 mg of transport protein and/or the composition according to the<br>
invention. The cosmetic composition is suitable to treat hyperhydrosis and facial<br>
wrinkles.<br>
The transport protein described in the present invention may be produced by a<br>
suitable host cell, such as e.g. Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,<br>
Pichia pastohs or Bacillus megaterium, which multiplies a recombinant<br>
expression vector, the vector coding for a transport protein.<br>
The present invention is elucidated by the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows that the affinity of the mutated He-fragment of BoNT/A to<br>
synaptosome membrane preparations from the rat brain is three times higher<br>
than that of the H c-fragment of the wild type of BoNT/A.<br>
Figure 2 shows t he binding of different BoNT/A He-fragment mutants to rat brain<br>
synaptosomes, the affinity of the BoNT/A He-fragment wild type being set to<br>
100% as a standard. The first column shows the affinities of the BoNT/A mutants,<br>
showing mutations of the amino acids Y1117 resulting in an increase. The<br>
second column shows further BoNT/A-mutants. The third column shows the<br>
affinities of BoN T/A-mutants exhibiting double mutations, which enhance the<br>
binding to nerve cell membranes (synaptosomes).<br>
Figure 3 shows t he increased neurotoxicity of the Y1117A-mutant of BoNT/A in<br>
comparison with the BoNT/A-wild type on the isolated nervus phrenicus -<br>
diaphragm musd e-preparation of the mouse.<br>
Figure 4 shows the binding of the four BoNT/A He-fragment hybrids HcAB, HcAC,<br>
HcAE and McAT (T = tetanus neurotoxin} in nerve cell membranes<br>
(synaptosomes), the BoNT/A He-fragment wild type being set to 100% as a<br>
standard.<br>
Figure 5 shows the increased neurotoxicity of the total toxin hybrids consisting of<br>
BoNT/A and either the He-fragment or the Hcc-domain of BoNT/B in comparison<br>
with the BoNT/A-wiid type in the isolated nervus phrenicus - diaphragm musclepreparation<br>
of the mouse.<br>
In detail, the present invention contains a transport protein (Trapo), formed by a<br>
modification of the HC of the neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum,<br>
preferably specifically binding to neurons, accommodated intracellulariy by<br>
receptor-mediated endocytosis and translocated from the acid endosomal<br>
compartment into the cytosol of neurons. This protein is used as a transporting<br>
means in order to introduce into the cells proteases and other substances bound<br>
to the said transporting means, unable to penetrate physiologically into the<br>
plasma membrane and to reach the cytosol of nerve cells. The substrates of the<br>
proteases are intracellularly localised proteins and peptides participating in the<br>
transmitter release. After separation of the substrates, the specific functions of<br>
the neurons are blocked; the cells themselves are not damaged. One of these<br>
functions is exocytosis, bringing about the neurotransmitter release. If the release<br>
of transmitters is inhibited, the transmission of signals from cell to cell is blocked.<br>
For example, striated muscles are paralysed if the release of acetyl choline is<br>
inhibited at the neuromuscular contact point. This effect may be used<br>
therapeutically, if TrapoX is applied to nerve ends of spastic or dystonic muscles.<br>
Other active substances are, for example, substances exhibiting anti-viral action-<br>
Conjugated with Trapo, they might be of use for treating viral infections of the<br>
nervous system. The present invention also relates to the use of a transport<br>
protein for inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters.<br>
If patients are treated with the native forms of BoNT/A and B, injection of these<br>
non-human proteins, despite the low dosage, causes the formation of antibodies,<br>
so that the therapy must be stopped in order to prevent anaphylactic shock. By<br>
applying a substance with the same active mechanism having a higher transport<br>
efficiency of the enzymatic activity, the dosage may be lowered drastically and<br>
the formation of antibodies will not occur. These properties are attributed to the<br>
transport protein described herein.<br>
Although examples are stated for application, the suitable mode of application<br>
and the dosage is, in general, individually determined by the treating physician.<br>
Such decisions are routinely made by each physician well versed in the relevant<br>
special field. Thus, the mode of application and the dosage of the neurotoxin may<br>
e.g. be selected in accordance with the invention described herein, based on<br>
criteria such as the solubility of the selected neurotoxin or the intensity of the pain<br>
to be treated.<br>
The treatment interval for native BoNT/A and B is currently three to four months<br>
on average. Prolonging this interval would reduce the risk of the formation of<br>
antibodies and allow a longer treatment period with BoNT. The increase of LC in<br>
the cytosol would extend its decomposition timewise and would thus also prolong<br>
the duration of action. The transport protein described here exhibits a higher<br>
affinity and reception rate than the native HC-A.<br>
The following example merely serves for elucidation and should not be<br>
contemplated in a limiting manner.<br>
Examples<br>
Recombinant expression of the genetically engineered TrapoX in E. coli<br>
The DMA-sequence of the HC of BoNT/A was amplified in chromosomal DNA of<br>
Clostridium botulinum (database no. AAA23262) by means of PCR. For this<br>
purpose, by means of specific oMgonucleotides, the codon for the ami no acid<br>
tyrosine 1117 was substituted by a base triplet coding for the amino acid residue<br>
of alanine. Furthermore, the 5'-end of the gene was supplemented by a DNAsequence,<br>
coding for the amino acids of the recognition sequence of thrombin.<br>
This DMA-sequence was inserted into a bacterial expression vector. The inserted<br>
gene for Trapo was in this case fused with an oligonucleotide at the 3'-end,<br>
coding for a carboxy-terminal affinity peptide such as e.g. the Strep-day, 6xHNday<br>
or Hise-day. The expression vector pAR-Trapo produced in this manner is<br>
the starting basis for adding carrier molecules, such as the LC of the BoNT.<br>
The DNA-sequence of the LC of BoNT/A was amplified by the PCR-method in<br>
the chromosomal DNA-sequence of Clostridium botulinum (database no.<br>
AAA23262) and inserted into the expression vector pAR-Trapo upstream of the<br>
coded thrombin recognition sequence. The expression vector pAR-TrapoX thus<br>
produced was transformed into an E.coli K12 strain and the expression of the<br>
protein TrapoX was induced under the conditions of Biological Safety Level 2 and<br>
in compliance with the rules and regulations issued for the project by the district<br>
government of Hanover, file reference 501g.40654/3/57/3. The over-expressed<br>
TrapoX was isolated in an affinity-chromatographic manner, following the<br>
directions of the manufacturer, as a single-chain protein with a molecular weight<br>
of 150 kDa. The protein was subsequently hydrolysed with thrombin conjugated<br>
on sepharose bringing about a pure protein, the two chains of which remained<br>
interlinked by a disulphide-bridge.<br>
Compared with the wild type of BoNT/A, this protein exhibited an affinity,<br>
increased by 300%, to isolated ganglioside GT1b immobilised on micro titre<br>
plates and to synaptosome membrane preparations from rat brain (Figure 1). The<br>
catalytic activity of the LC-A was not changed, as has been shown in the in vitro<br>
splitting of recombinant SNAP-25. The potency of the TrapoX with regard to<br>
inhibition of the neurotransmitter release in functional synaptosomes from rat<br>
brain had increased by 300%, compared with the native BoNT/A recovered from<br>
Clostridium batulinum. In nerve muscle-preparations of the mouse (HDA), the<br>
potency of the TrapoX was likewise increased by 300% compared with the native<br>
BoNT/A (Figure 2).<br>
Measurement of the binding to rat brain svnaptosomes and the<br>
neurotoxicitv in the HDA of different BoNT/A-mutants<br>
The binding of radioactively marked He-fragments to rat synaptosomes was<br>
measured as stated in Rummel et al., J. Mol. Biol. 326 (2003), 835-847. The<br>
neurotoxictty of the BoNT/A-mutants was determined as described by<br>
Habermann et al., Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 311 (1980), 33-40.<br>
The comparison of the binding of different BoNT/A-mutants as compared with the<br>
wild type is shown in the following table:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The mutation of individual determined amino acids within the ganglioside binding<br>
pocket of BoNT/A resulted in an increase of the binding to nerve cells. Preferably,<br>
in position 1117, tyrosine is substituted by alanine, cysteine or valine. In<br>
particular, the substitution of the tyrosine residue in position 1117 by alanine<br>
results in an increase of the affinity to about 330%.<br>
Further mutations of individual amino acids from the ganglioside binding pocket<br>
in position 1252 and 1253 result likewise in an increase of the binding. In<br>
particular, the mutation of F1252 in tyrosine and H1253 in lysine resulted in an<br>
increase of the affinity by 110%, and 50% respectively.<br>
Furthermore, increases of the binding to nerve cells can be expected in<br>
mutations in positions 1202,1262, 1270, 1278 and 1279.<br>
Moreover, mutants of BoNT/A were also tested with double mutations, in which<br>
case, in particular, the mutants Y1117C/H1253K and Y1117V/H1253K resulted in<br>
an increase of the binding to synaptosomes (cf. Figure 2).<br>
It was furthermore determined that the increase of the binding, particularly of the<br>
mutant Y1117A of BoNT/A resulted in an increase of the neurotoxicity in the<br>
N.phrenicus - neurotoxicity assay (HDA-Assay) (Figure 3).<br>
Determination of binding and neurotoxicity of BoNT/A Hy.-hybrids<br>
The determination of the binding and the neurotoxicity was performed as<br>
described above.<br>
The results are reflected in the following table and further in Figures 4 and 5.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Substitution of the Hcc-domain of BoNT/A by the other serotypes, in particular C.<br>
botulinum neurotoxin B and C. botulinum neurotoxin C, resulted in an increase<br>
of the binding to nerve cells. It was furthermore observed that the substitution of<br>
the Hcc-domain of He-fragment of BoNT/A by the corresponding domain of<br>
tetanus neurotoxin likewise resulted in an increase of the affinity in nerve cells.<br>
The affinity changes also apply to the substitution of the Hcc-domain in the entire<br>
BoNT/A. Figure 5 shows in this context that in a hybrid scAtAAB the increase of<br>
affinity has a similar effect on increased neurotoxicity. If, instead of the Hccdomain,<br>
the entire He-fragment scAtAAB is substituted, corresponding results are<br>
observed. In particular, it was observed that an improvement of the neurotoxicity<br>
by about 350% was noted when substituting the Hcc-domain or the He-fragment<br>
of BoNT/A by that of BoNT/B.<br>
Determination of binding of the BoNT-mutants to the ganglioside GT1b<br>
Ganglioside GT1b [NAcNeua3Gal(J3NAcGal<br>
fi4(NAcNeua8NAcNeua3)GalB4Glc(X] (Sigma-Aldrich) is dissolved in methanol<br>
and applied to high-affinity 96-cup polystyrene-micro titre plates (Corning; 1ug<br>
GT1b in 100 ul/cup) or, in the case of competition assays to high-affinity CS<br>
single fracture strip plates with 125l-BoNTs (Greiner Bio-ohne; 0,1 ug GT1b in 100<br>
Ml / cup). The solvent is evaporated at room temperature and the cups are rinsed<br>
three times with a binding buffer (10mM Tris-HCI, 10mM Na2HPO4, 0,5% BSA,<br>
pH7,2). The non specific binding sites are then blocked by incubation for two<br>
hours in PBS/Tween [140 mM NaCI, 7 mM KCI, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1,8 mM<br>
KH2PO4, 0,05% (VA/) Tween 20, pH 7,2], supplemented by 3% (w/v) BSA. The<br>
binding assays are carried out in binding buffers (100ul / cup) for 2 hours at room<br>
temperature either with increasing quantities of the wild type or specific quantities<br>
of the mutants. Unbound protein is removed in 3 rinsing steps, each with 250ul<br>
PBS/Tween buffer. Bound He-fragments are identified by incubation with Strep<br>
Tactin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (ST-AP, IBA GmbH) in a binding<br>
buffer for a duration of 2 hours at room temperature according to manufacturer's<br>
instructions, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml in 100 mM glycine, 1 mM MgCb, 1<br>
mM ZnCb, pH 10,4), which ultimately serves as substrate for the alkaline<br>
phosphatase. The desphorphoryiation reaction is stopped by adding a 3 M NaOH<br>
solution and the extinction is measured at 405 nm using a Spectra Count micro<br>
plate reading device (Packard). The competition assays are performed over a<br>
period of 2 hours at room temperature in a 100ul binding buffer with<br>
700000cpm/cup [1251]-BoNT, different quantities of native BoNT or recombinant<br>
He-fragment. After incubation and removal of the supernatants the cups are<br>
rinsed three times with PBS/Tween buffer, dried and separated. The quantities of<br>
bound radioactiveiy marked BoNT are then determined in an automatic y-counter<br>
(Wallac 1480 Wizard 3).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
