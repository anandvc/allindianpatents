				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of acetic acid and/or methyl acetate in the liquid phase in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst comprising iridium and platinum.<br>
The process of the invention makes it possible to obtain an increased productivity in terms of acetic acid, as well as an improved stability of the catalyst system employed.<br>
Various ways of obtaining acetic acid are known and exploited in industry. These include the methanol carbonylation reaction carried out in the liquid phase, under a pressure of carbon monoxide, which is one of the reactants, in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst system. Another way of obtaining acetic acid consists in isomerizing methyl formate. This reaction, too, is generally carried out in the presence of a catalyst system in the homogeneous phase. Finally, another process involves carrying out the carbonylation of methanol and the isomerization of methyl formate simultaneously.<br>
More precisely, the carbonylation process using rhodium is a known process, exploited in industry, which has formed the subject of numerous articles and patents, for example American patents US 3,769,329 and US 3,813,428.<br>
European patents EP618 183(IN 0183019) and EP 618 184(IN 0183018) and European patents EP 785 919 and EP 759 022, describe a carbonylation process carried out in the presence of a catalyst system based on iridium and, if appropriate, also containing rhodium.<br>
A carbonylation process using iridium and ruthenium, which is currently exploited in industry, is described in European patent EP 643 034.<br>
More recently, a new preparative process, consisting of a methyl formate isomerization reaction in the presence of iridium, was proposed in French patent FR 2 746 794 and international patent application WO 97/35829(IN 805/DEL/97)<br>
In parallel, a process for the preparation of acetic acid and/or methyl acetate by carrying out a methyl formate isomerization reaction and a methanol carbonylation reaction simultaneously was proposed in patent FR 2 746 795 and international patent application WO 97/35828(IN 1142/DEL/97)<br>
These different processes for acetic acid production are generally carried out continuously in plants comprising essentially three zones. The first corresponds "to the actual reaction zone comprising a pressurized reactor in which the carbonylation<br>
and/or isomerization are carried out. The second consists of a zone for separation of the acid formed. This operation is effected by partial vaporization of the reaction mixture in a so-called flash apparatus, in which the pressure is kept below that in the reactor. The vaporized part is then sent to a third zone, where the acetic acid produced is purified. This zone comprises various distillation columns in which the acetic acid produced is separated from the water, the reactants and the by-products. That part of the mixture which remains in liquid form at the outlet of the vaporization zone, and comprises especially the catalyst, is recycled to the reactor.<br>
The aim of the process according to the invention is to improve the processes described above by using a homogenous phase catalyst system comprising iridium and platinum.<br>
In fact, it has now been found that the addition of platinum to a catalyst system based on iridium or iridium and rhodium makes it possible, totally unexpectedly, to increase the acid production rate. In other words, the process according to the invention makes it possible to achieve a reaction rate which is greater than or equal to that obtained, under the same conditions, with a catalyst system involving only iridium or an iridium/rhodium mixture, while the total number of moles of metals used in the process of the invention remains unchanged.<br>
Apart from the productivity increase, obtaining comparable rates using a smaller number of moles of catalyst constitutes an additional economic advantage, namely that of reducing the catalyst costs.<br>
It has also been shown that platinum considerably enhances the stability of the iridium, even when the water content is low.<br>
The process according to the invention is carried out in the liquid phase. Consequently the catalyst system used is in a form soluble in the reaction medium.<br>
The catalyst system suitable for carrying out the invention is based on at least one iridium compound, by itself or in the presence of rhodium, and at least one halogen-containing promoter and also comprises at least one platinum derivative.<br><br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of acetic acid and/or methyl acetate in liquid phase by carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide in the presence of water content less than 14% by weight, based on a total weight of reaction medium, a solvent such as herein described in the presence of a homogenous catalyst system such as herein described to obtain acetic acid, wherein said acetic acid is optionally subjected to isomenzation with methyl formate in the presence of water content less than 5% thereby obtaining methyl acetate and excess acetic acid and isolating excess acetic acid and methyl acetate in a manner known per se wherein said process is performed at a temperature in the range of 150 to 250°C and under a carbon monoxide partial pressure in the range of 0.1.105 Pa to 200.10 Pa in the presence of a homogenous catalyst system comprising:<br>
iridium and/or rhodium at a concentration of iridium and rhodium in the<br>
range of 0.1  to  100 mmol/1 and platinum introduced into said catalyst<br>
system; anda halogen-containing promoter such as herein described.The invention therefore consists in improving the processes for the preparation of acetic acid by isomenzation, by carbonylation or by a combination of isomerization and carbonylation by using a catalyst system based on soluble iridium and a halogen-containing promoter, and by adding platinum to said catalyst system in a form soluble in the medium.<br>
ln a first variant of the process of the invention, methanol is carbonylated by maintaining a carbon monoxide partial pressure of between 0.1.10' Pa and 200.10' Pa throughout the reaction.<br><br>
In a second variant of the process, methyl formate is isomerized by maintaining a carbon monoxide partial pressure of between 0.1.10' Pa and 25.10' Pa throughout the reaction. The preferred conditions for carrying out such a process can be obtained directly by those skilled in the art by reference to international patent application WO 97/35829 cited above, except that platinum is added to the iridium.<br><br>
In a third variant of the process, a methanol carbonylation reaction and a methyl formate isomerization reaction are carried out simultaneously by maintaining a carbon monoxide partial pressure of between 0.1.10' Pa and 25.10' Pa throughout the reaction. The preferred conditions for carrying out such a process can be obtained directly by those skilled in the art by reference to international patent application WO 97135828 cited above, except that platinum is added to the iridium.<br><br>
In the catalyst system used in the above three variants, the iridium may advantageously be replaced with a combination of iridium + rhodium.<br><br>
In cases where a catalyst system containing rhodium is employed, the atomic ratio of rhodium to iridium may vary within wide limits, i.e. between 0.01 and 99.<br><br>
In all these variants, the platinum will be introduced into the reaction medium in a sufficient amount and in appropriate proportions relative to the iridium. Experiments carried out by the inventors of the present invention have in fact shown that the optimum amounts and proportions of platinum are intimately associated with the form in which the platinum is introduced into the reaction medium.<br><br>
In precise terms, it is possible to use any platinum compounds which are soluble or capable of being solubilized in the reaction medium under the conditions of the invention.<br>
As examples, and without implying a limitation, the following are particularly suitable for carrying out the invention:<br><br>
- platinum compounds hereafter referred to as simple compounds", such as platinum in the metallic state, its salts and its oxides; and<br><br>
-	coordination complexes of this metal.<br><br>
The compounds in the form of complexes prove to be the preferred compounds according to the invention.<br><br>
The salts used are preferably platinum halides. The halogen is more particularly selected from chlorine, bromine and iodine, the last of these being preferred.<br><br>
Thus compounds such as PtI2, PtBr2, P!C12, PtCI4.xH2O, H2PtCI6.xH2O, Na2PtCI4.xH2O and Na2PtCI6.xI-120 can be used in the process according to the invention.<br><br>
Oxides, selected from PtO, PtO2 and PtO2.xH2O, can likewise be appropriately used in the process according to the invention.<br><br>
As far as the soluble platinum coordination complexes are concerned, the most commonly used compounds are those having ligands selected from carbon monoxide and a carbon monoxide/halogen combination, the halogen being selected from chlorine, bromine and, more particularly, iodine. It is not excluded, however, to use soluble platinum complexes whose ligands are selected for example from organophosphorus and organonitrogen compounds.<br><br>
The following compounds may be mentioned, without implying a limitation, as coordination complexes which are known to those skilled in the art and are particularly suitable for carrying out the invention: PtI2(CO)2, [PtI2(CO)]2, [Pt3(CO)6]2{Q]2 and [Pt6(CO)12]2{Q]2, in which formulae Q can be especially hydrogen or a group NR4 or PR~, where R is selected from hydrogen and/or a hydrocarbon radical, tetraiododicarbonyldiplatinum, [PtI2(CO)]2, being preferred.<br><br>
In a first variant of the invention, if the platinum is introduced in the form of a simple compound - platinum in the metallic state, salts or oxides - it will be preferable to maintain a platinum content of at least 4 mmol/l of reaction medium and an atomic ratio of iridium to platinum of between 2 and 5.<br><br>
In a second, particularly preferred variant of the invention, if the platinum is introduced in the form of a coordination complex of this metal with ligands selected from carbon monoxide, a carbon monoxide/halogen combination and organonitrogen and organophosphorus compounds, it will be preferable to maintain a platinum content of at least I mmol/l of reaction medium and an atomic ratio of iridium to platinum of between I and 5.<br><br>
The atomic ratio of iridium to platinum or, in the case where the catalyst system also comprises rhodium, the atomic ratio of (iridium + rhodium) to platinum<br><br>
is between 2 and S when the platinum is used in the form of simple compounds as defined above, and between 1 and 5 when the platinum is introduced in the form of coordination complexes. The platinum content will preferably be at least 4 mmol/l of reaction medium in the case of simple platinum compounds and at least about I mmol/l in the case of coordination complexes.<br><br>
In general, the concentration of iridium or, if appropriate, iridium + rhodium in the reaction medium is between 0.1 and 100 mxnol/l, preferably between I and 20 inmolA.<br><br>
Any of the rhodium- and iridium-based compounds conventionally used in carbonylation and/or isomerization reactions can be employed in the process according to the invention.<br><br>
It is possible to use any iridium compounds which are soluble or capable of being solubilized in the reaction medium under the operating conditions of the invention. As examples, and without implying a limitation, iridium in the metallic state, salts of this metal, oxides or coordination complexes are particularly suitable for carrying out the invention.<br><br>
The iridium salts conventionally used are iridium halides. The halogen is more particularly selected from chlorine, bromine and iodine, the last of these being preferred. Thus compounds like In3, IrBr3, mCI,, IrI,.4H20, In4 and IrBr,.4H20 can be used in the process according to the invention.<br><br>
Oxides, selected from mO2 and 1r20,.xH2O, can likewise be appropriately used in the process according to the invention.<br>
As far as soluble iridium coordination complexes are concerned, the most commonly used compounds are those having ligands selected from carbon monoxide and a carbon monoxide/halogen combination, the halogen being selected from chlorine, bromine and, more particularly, iodine. It is not excluded, however, to use soluble iridium complexes whose ligands are selected for example from organophosphorus and organonitrogen compounds.<br><br>
The following compounds may be mentioned, without implying a limitation, as coordination complexes which are known to those skilled in the art and are particularly suitable for carrying out the invention: 1r4(CO)12, Ir(CO)211Q, Ir(CO)2BrfQ' and Ir(CO)2ClQ~, in which formulae Q can be especially hydrogen or a group NR4 or PR4, where R is selected from hydrogen and/or a hydrocarbon radical.<br><br>
These catalysts can be obtained by any method known to those skilled in the<br>
rt. Reference may thus be made to patents EP 657 386 and EP 737 103 for the preparation of iridium-based catalyst solutions suitable for carrying out the present invention.<br><br>
As indicated previously, the reaction according to the invention can be carried out with a catalyst system comprising iridium by itself, or iridium and rhodium, in addition to platinum.<br><br>
In general, the rhodium- and iridium-based compounds used are selected from coordination complexes of these metals which are soluble in the medium under the reaction conditions. More particularly, the coordination complexes used are those whose ligands are on the one hand carbon monoxide and on the other hand a halogen such as chlorine, bromine or, more particularly, iodine. It is of course possible to use soluble complexes comprising ligands other than those mentioned, such as organophosphorus or organonitrogen ligands in particular. Advantageously, however, the present invention does not require the use of rhodium and iridium complexes of this type.<br><br>
Thus complexes of the type 1r4(CO)12, Ir(CO)21Q, Ir(CO)2BrQ~, Rh.~(CO)12, Rh(CO)2IjQ~ or Rh(CO)2BriQ~, or complexes based on both metals, such as Rh3Ir(CO)12 or Rh2Ir2(CO)12, in which formulae Q can be especially hydrogen or a group NR~ or PR4, where R is selected from hydrogen and/or a hydrocarbon radical, may be mentioned especially as examples of coordination complexes which are used more particularly in the present invention.<br><br>
Compounds selected from the salts of these elements, such as especially 1r13, IrBr,, IrCl3, 1r13.4H20, IrBr3.4H20, Rhl3, RhBr3, RhCl3, Rhl3.4H20 and RhBr3.4H20, or rhodium and iridium in the metallic state, can likewise be used in the process according to the invention.<br><br>
It should be noted that the above-mentioned list of rhodium- and iridium-based compounds cannot be considered as exhaustive and that reference may be made to patents US 3 769 329 and US 3 772 380, whose teaching is included herewith, for additional examples of compounds of the two metals mentioned above.<br><br>
In general, the rhodium-, iridium- and platinum-based compounds used are selected from the coordination complexes of these metals which are soluble in the medium under the reaction conditions. More particularly, the coordination complexes used are those whose ligands are on the one hand carbon monoxide and on the other hand a halogen such as chlorine, bromine or, more particularly, iodine.<br><br>
It is of course possible to use soluble complexes comprising ligands other than those mentioned, such as organophosphorus or organonitrogen ligands in particular. Complexes of two or three of the above metals may also be mentioned; [PtRh,(CO)15]Q, Q being as defined above, may be mentioned without implying a limitation.<br><br>
One important characteristic of the invention lies in the fact that the platinum is present in the reaction medium in a sufficient amount and in appropriate proportions relative to the iridium. The platinum concentration is equal to at least 4 mmol/l of reaction medium and, in addition, the atomic ratio of iridium or (iridium + rhodium) to platinum is between 2 and 5 in the case where simple platinum compounds are used. If the platinum is introduced in the form of a coordination complex, the platinum concentration is preferably equal to at least 1 mmol/l of reaction medium and the atomic ratio of iridium to platinum is between I and 5. It has in fact been observed, totally unexpectedly, that such conditions allow a considerable increase in the reaction rate. Remarkably, the stability of the catalyst system is also appreciably improved under these conditions.<br><br>
Apart from the compounds mentioned above, the catalyst system according to the invention comprises a halogen-containing promoter. This can take the form of a halogen by itself or a halogen combined with other moieties such as hydrogen or the methyl or acetyl radical.<br><br>
The halogen is generally selected from chlorine, bromine and iodine, iodine being preferred.<br><br>
Iodine, hydriodic acid, methyl iodide and acetyl iodide may be mentioned as halogen compounds which can also be used as promoters.<br><br>
Methyl iodide will preferably be used as the halogen-containing promoter.<br><br>
In one variant of the invention, the halogen-containing promoter is partially or totally introduced into the reaction mixture in the form of a precursor. In such a case, said precursor generally takes the form of a compound which is capable of releasing the hydrocarbon radical of the above-mentioned halogen-containing promoter into the reaction medium under the action of a halogen or a hydrohalic acid in particular, the latter compounds being present in the medium or introduced for this purpose.<br><br>
Compounds selected from methanol, dimethyl ether, methyl acetate and methyl formate, used by themselves or in a mixture, may be mentioned as nonlimiting examples of suitable precursors.<br><br>
The amount of halogen-containing promoter present in the reaction mixture is advantageously less than or equal to 20%, based on the total weight of said mixture. The content of halogen-containing promoter is preferably less than or equal to 15%.<br><br>
It should be noted that if the above-mentioned promoter is partially or totally introduced in the form of a precursor, the amount of precursor or promoter! precursor mixture is such as to give an amount equivalent to that mentioned above.<br><br>
The process of the invention can be carried Out by feeding the reactor with methanol as the only reactant in the case of carbonylation only. It can also be carried out by feeding the reactor with methyl formate in the case of an isomerization process, or with methyl formate and methanol in the case of a combined process involving simultaneous isomerization and carbonylation.<br><br>
The reaction according to the invention is also carried out in the presence of water. The process according to the invention makes it possible to obtain a good productivity with low water contents, without loss of catalyst metal by precipitation.<br><br>
Thus the process forming the subject of the invention can be carried out over a wide range of water concentrations in the reaction medium, but preferably with a concentration less than or equal to 14%, based on the total weight of said medium. More particularly, the water content of the reaction medium is less than or equal to 10%.<br>
In the first variant of the process, where only the carbonylation of methanol is carried out, the water content is preferably between 2% and 8% by weight of the reaction medium.<br>
In the second variant, where the isomerization of methyl formate is carried out, optionally simultaneously with the carbonylation of methanol, the water content is less than 5% and preferably less than 2% by weight of the reaction medium.<br>
The process according to the invention can be carried out in the presence of iodides in a form soluble in the reaction medium. The iodides can be introduced into the reaction medium as such, but also in the form of compounds capable of forming soluble iodides.<br>
Iodides are understood as meaning ionic species, i.e. excluding covalent iodides (such as the halogen-containing promoter in particular) and hydriodic acid.<br><br>
Thus the iodides introduced as such into said mi~cture are selected from inorganic and organic iodides.<br>
Inorganic iodides which may principally be mentioned are the iodides of alkaline earth metals or alkali metals, the latter being preferred. Potassium iodide, lithium iodide and sodium iodide may be mentioned among said alkali metal iodides.<br><br>
Organic iodides which may be mentioned are organic compounds comprising at least one organophosphorus group and/or at least one organonitrogen group and reacting with iodine-based compounds to give ionic species containing this halogen. Examples which may be mentioned are the compounds of the formula Q~X, in which Q is a group NR4 or PR4, where R is selected from hydrogen and/or a hydrocarbon radical.<br><br>
Examples which may be mentioned of compounds capable of forming iodides soluble in the reaction medium are alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carboxylates and hydroxides, such as lithium acetate, potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide in particular.<br><br>
It should moreover be noted that the iodides may originate in ways other than those indicated above.<br><br>
These compounds can thus originate from impurities, such as alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, present in the starting materials employed to prepare the catalyst solution.<br><br>
Likewise the iodides can originate from the corrosion metals appearing during the reaction. It is preferable to keep the concentration threshold of these metals relatively low, of the order of a few hundred parts per million, because they have the effect especially of favoring the water-gas shift reaction and contribute to increasing the atomic ratio of iodides to iridium.<br><br>
It is possible to introduce a particular amount of iodides into the reaction medium according to the amount of iridium present in the medium. Thus said amount of iodides introduced is such that the atomic ratio of iodides introduced to iridium (expressed in mol/mol) is below 10 and is kept within this range throughout the reaction.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the atomic ratio of iodides to iridium is kept below I More particularly, this ratio is below 1 5.<br>
It has been found that the addition of such amounts of iodides makes it possible to improve the stability of the catalyst and keep the productivity of the process high.<br>
Consequently the present invention is more particularly intended to be carried out continuously and the stable operating conditions of the process correspond to the composition and proportions indicated.<br><br>
More particularly, as far as the soluble iodides are concerned, the atomic ratio of soluble iodides to iridium can be maintained by treating a mixture comprising at least the iridium compound with an ion exchange resin and then adding iodides in soluble form in an amount such that said ratio is below 10.<br><br>
In addition to the compounds and reactants mentioned above, the reaction according to the invention is advantageously carried out in the presence of esters.<br><br>
The ester used is preferably methyl acetate and/or methyl formate, which are used as such or in a masked form.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the ester content is advantageously less than or equal to 40% by weight, based on the weight of the reaction mixture. More particularly, this content remains less than or equal to 30%.<br>
Finally, the reaction is carried Out in the presence of a solvent. The solvent used in the process according to the invention is advantageously acetic acid or formic acid. It is of course possible to use other solvents such as, in particular, compounds which are inert towards the reaction mixture and have a boiling point above that of the acid formed.<br><br>
The reaction is generally carried out at a temperature between 150 and 2500C. More particularly, the reaction temperature is between 175 and 2100C and preferably between 175 and 2000C.<br><br>
The total pressure under which the reaction is carried out is generally above atmospheric pressure. More particularly, it is advantageously below 200. 1 Q5 Pa and preferably below or equal to 50.10' Pa. In the case of a process according to the invention which involves the isomerization of methyl formate, optionally simultaneously with the carbonylation of methanol, the CO partial pressure will advantageously be between 0.1.10' Pa and 25.10' Pa, as indicated previously. The pressures are expressed in absolute pascals and are measured hot, i.e. under the temperature conditions of the reaction.<br><br>
The process according to the invention is preferably carried out in the<br>
presence of a corrosion metal content of less than a few hundred ppm, preferably of less than 200 ppm. The corrosion metals are especially iron, nickel, chromium, molybdenum and zirconium. The corrosion metal content of the reaction mixture is maintained by the methods known to those skilled in the art, for example selective precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction or passage over ion exchange resins.<br><br>
In general, the process of the invention is advantageously carried out continuously.<br><br>
The reaction is carried out in equipment which is resistant to the corrosion created by the medium. Thus zirconium or alloys of the HASTELLOY® C or B type are particularly suitable for the operating conditions of the reaction.<br><br>
When the reaction is started, the various components are introduced into an appropriate reactor, which is fitted with stirring means so as to ensure a good homogeneity of the reaction mixture. It should be noted that although the reactor preferably comprises mechanical means for stirring the reaction mixture, it is not excluded to dispense with such means, it being possible for the mixture to be homogenized by the carbon monoxide introduced into the reactor.<br><br>
It should be noted that the reaction could conveniently be carried Out in a reactor of the piston type.<br>
It is of course possible to envisage combining several reactors of the stirred and piston type.<br>
Carbon monoxide can be introduced directly into the reactor where the reaction according to the invention takes place, but it can also be introduced into the recycling zone, which will be described below.<br><br>
The reaction mixture leaving the reactor is treated in an appropriate manner for separating the products from the reaction mixture comprising especially the catalyst.<br><br>
For this purpose, and in the case where the reaction is carried out continuously, it is possible for example to employ a conventional technique which consists in expanding the mixture so as to cause a partial vaporization thereof This operation can be effected using a valve for expanding the mixture, the latter being introduced into a separator (called a flash separator). The operation can take place with or, preferably, without the provision of heat, i.e. under adiabatic conditions.<br><br>
The non-vaporized part, comprising especially the catalyst which has remained in solution, is advantageously recycled to the reactor, conventionally by means of a pump.<br><br>
The vaporized part, which comprises the acetic acid and/or the methyl acetate produced, is then sent to a purification zone, which conventionally comprises various distillation columns.<br><br>
Finally, the process according to the invention can be carried out with the insertion of an additional reactor between the main reactor and the partial vaporization zone, more particularly upstream of the reaction mixture expansion valve; in said additional reactor, the carbon monoxide present in the dissolved and/or entrained state will be wholly or partially consumed.<br><br>
