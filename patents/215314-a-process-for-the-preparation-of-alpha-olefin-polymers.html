EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Butyl-2-methyl-2,4,4-trichlorobut-3-enoate Butyl-2-methyl-4,4,4-trichloro-2-enoate (180 g., 0.7 mole, 87% assay by GC) was distilled at a pressure of 85 mm Hg with a pot temperature of 180-200°C and a vapor temperature of 156-172°C, to produce 95.5 grams of a pale yellow distillate which was shown by GC/Mass Spectrometry (MS) and NMR to contain approximately 43% butyl-2-methyl-<br>

Example 4<br>
Preparation of Butyl-2-methyl-2,4,4-trichloro-3-enoate and Butyl-2-hydroxymethyl-4,4-dichlorobut-enoate<br>
A 60/40 mixture of butyl-2-methyl-4,4,4-trichlorobut-2-enoate and butyl-2-methyl-2,4,4-trichlorobut-3-enoate (A) (50 grams, 0.2 mole) prepared by the thermal isomerization procedure described in Example 1, was stirred vigorously with 20% aqueous hydrochloric acid (125 grams) and tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (2 grams, 3 mole %), at 105-110°C for 22 hours to produce a crude reaction product containing 69% butyl-2-methyl-2,4,4-trichlorobut-enoate (A), 11% butyl-2-hydroxymethyl-4,4-dichlorobut-3-enoate (C), 3% residual butyl-2-methyl-4,4,4-trichlorobut-2-enoate, and approximately 8% high boiling material.  The water was distilled from the crude reaction product at 65°C/0.1 mm Hg to produce a distillate containing 85% A, 11% C, and 2% residual butyl-2-methyl-4,4,4-trichlorobut-3-enoate.<br>
Example 5 and Comparative Example A<br>
Preparation of EPDM in Solution Utilizing Butyl-2-methyl-2.4,4-trichloro-3-enoate and Comparative Activator Butyl-2-methyl-2,4,4,4-tetrachlorobutanoate<br>
A one gallon glass reactor equipped with temperature regulating coils was maintained at 30°C and charged with 1.5 L of dry hexane and 4.2 mmole of ethylaluminum sesquichloride in 1.7 ml of hexane, and agitation was<br>
initiated.  A 500 ml cylinder was pressurized with 1.5 psig of hydrogen, and the hydrogen was then charged into the reactor along with sufficient propylene to achieve a total pressure of 15 psig in the reactor.  Ethylidene norbornene (ENB, 6 ml) was then added to the reactor. The reactor was then pressurized to 50 psig with a 1.5/1 weight ratio of ethylene and propylene.  This gaseous ethylene/propylene mixture was fed continuously as required to maintain 50 psig pressure in the reactor throughout the polymerization.  Vanadium oxytrichloride (VOC13, 0.075 mmole in 1.5 ml of hexane) and either butyl-2-methyl-2,4,4-trichloro-3-enoate or Comparative Activator butyl-2-methyl-2,4,4,4-tetrachlorobutanoate (1.5 mmole in 1.5 ml hexane), were then added to the reactor, followed 5 minutes later by an additional aliquot (4 ml) of the ENB.  The temperature of the resultant reaction mixture in the reactor briefly rose to approximately 45°C early in the polymerization process, but was cooled and maintained at 30°C thereafter.  After 0.5 hour, the reaction was terminated by addition of isopropyl alcohol and the resultant polymer product was washed, separated from the reaction mixture and analyzed. Results of such analysis for the polymer product prepared using butyl-2-methyl-2,4,4-trichloro-3-enoate and for the polymer product prepared using Comparative Activator butyl-2-methyl-2,4,4,4-tetrachlorobutanoate, are presented below in Table 1.<br>
Catalyst Efficiency is presented in terms of pounds of polymer/pound of VOC13.  The propylene composition and the Mooney Viscosity (ML 1+4 @ 125°C) of the polymer products were determined using ASTM D-3900-86, Method D , and ASTM D-1646-87, respectively.  The ENB composition of the products was determined as described in I. J. Gardner and G. Ver Strate, Rubber Chemistry and Technology 46(4), 1019 (1973).<br>
Compared to Comparative Activator butyl-2-methyl-2,4,4,4-tetrachlorobutanoate, the butyl-2-methyl-2,4,4-<br>
trichloro-3-enoate provided superior catalyst efficiency, superior propylene conversion, and molecular weight regulation (as shown by the Mooney viscosity).<br>

Example 6<br>
Preparation of Ethvlene-Propylene Copolvmer (EPM) in Suspension<br>
Into a 3 liter stainless steel stirred autoclave (Buchi, Model BEP 280) with jacketed cooling, a dip tube for feeding ethylene, a thermocouple well, pressure gauge and ports for the introduction of hydrogen, propylene, and the catalyst components, was charged 780 grams of liquid propylene.  The temperature was set at 15°C by cooling the jacket with water from a circulating water bath.  Ethylene. was then added in an amount sufficient to raise the reactor pressure by 20 psig.  A solution of 9.25 mmole of diethyl aluminum chloride in 16 ml of hexane from a pressurized bomb was then added to the Buchi followed by enough hydrogen gas to raise the pressure to 280 psig.  11 ml of a hexane solution containing 0.08 mmole of vanadium oxytrichloride and 1.28 mmole of Promoter Composition II (from Table 2) from a pressurized bomb was then charged to the Buchi all at<br>
once.  The ensuing exotherm was controlled by the jacket cooling to maintain the temperature of 15°C.  The pressure was maintained at 280 psig. by feeding ethylene into the Buchi to replace the ethylene which was being polymerized.  Uptake of ethylene began to slow noticeably after 15 minutes and addition of ethylene was stopped after 36 minutes.<br>
The contents of the Buchi were then transferred in increments to a two liter stainless steel pressure vessel (Parr reactor) containing 400 ml of hexane, 0.2 grams of octadecyl 3-(3',5'-di-tert-butyl-4'-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate as antioxidant and 10 ml of isopropanol to deactivate the catalyst.  After each incremental transfer, propylene was vented from the Parr reactor to lower the pressure and the Buchi reactor was repressurized with nitrogen.  Transfer was continued in this manner until all the contents of the Buchi were discharged and all the propylene had been vented off. The solution remaining in the Parr reactor was then removed and filtered through Celite.  The hexane was then removed by distillation leaving a low molecular weight ethylene-propylene copolymer.  Characteristics of this copolymer are presented in Table 3 below.<br>
Example 7<br>
Preparation of EPM in Suspension<br>
The same procedure as described in Example 6 above was conducted except that Promoter Composition I was used instead of Promoter Composition II.  The characteristics of the copolymer produced are presented in Table 3 below.<br>
Example 8<br>
Preparation of EPM in Solution<br>
Into the Buchi autoclave described in Example 6, was charged 346 grams of hexane, 518 grams of propylene, 10 psig ethylene, 15.4 mmole of diethyl aluminum chloride, and 20 psig hydrogen.  The temperature was maintained at<br>
38°C.  A hexane solution containing 0.01 mole/liter vanadium oxytrichloride and 0.046 mole/liter of Promoter Composition III was prepared to produce a catalyst/activator solution, and 20 ml of this catalyst/activator solution was pumped rapidly into the reactor.  Exotherm began and was controlled by the jacket cooling to maintain the temperature at 38°C.  Ethylene was then fed at 2 grams/minute and the catalyst/activator solution was pumped into the reactor at a rate sufficient to maintain a constant pressure.  After 30 minutes, pumping of the catalyst/activator solution and feeding of the ethylene were terminated.<br>
A solution of 0.15 grams of epoxidized soybean oil and 0.15 grams of octadecyl 3 -(3',5'-di-tert-butyl-4'-hydroxyphenyDpropionate in 10 ml hexane was added and the propylene was slowly vented from the reactor. Another 400 grams of hexane was added to the reactor and the contents were heated to 49°C.  The contents were then transferred to a 3 quart flint glass Chemco reactor containing 350 ml of deoxygenated distilled water.  The mixture was agitated rapidly for 30 seconds and then allowed to settle for 20 minutes.  A 600 ml portion of the washed hexane solution was then transferred to a second Chemco reactor and washed a second time with 160 ml of the deoxygenated distilled water.  The twice washed hexane solution was then isolated and the hexane was removed by distillation to leave a low molecular weight ethylene-propylene copolymer.  Characteristics of this copolymer are presented below in Table 3.<br>
Example 9<br>
Preparation of EPM in Solution<br>
The same procedure as described above in Example 8 was conducted except that Promoter Composition I was used instead of Promoter Composition III.  The characteristics of the copolymer produced are presented in Table 3 below.<br>
