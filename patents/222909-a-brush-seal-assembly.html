				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to seals, and more particularly, to a brush seal<br>
assembly for rotary machines.<br>
Rotary machines include, without limitation for steam turbines and compressors<br>
and turbines for gas turbines and generators. A steam turbine has a steam path<br>
which typically includes, in serial-flow relationship, a steam inlet, a turbine, and a<br>
steam outlet. A gas turbine has a gas path which typically includes, in serial-flow<br>
relationship, an air intake (or inlet), a compressor, a combustor, a turbine, and a<br>
gas outlet (or exhaust nozzle). Gas or steam leakage, either out of the gas or<br>
steam path or into the gas steam path, from an area of higher pressure to an<br>
area of lower pressure, is generally undesirable. For example, gas-path leakage<br>
in the turbine or compressor area of a gas turbine, between the rotor of the<br>
turbine or compressor and the circumferentially surrounding turbine or<br>
compressor casing, will lower the efficiency of the gas turbine leading to<br>
increased fuel costs. Also, steam-path leakage in the turbine area of a steam<br>
turbine, between the rotor of the turbine and the circumferentially surrounding<br>
casing, will lower efficiency of the steam turbine leading to increase fuel costs.<br>
Annular brush seals have been used between a rotor and a surrounding casing in<br>
gas and steam turbines. A gas or steam brush seal is made up of<br>
circumferentially- arrayed brush seal segments. Each brush seal segment<br>
includes a plurality of flexible, metal-wire bristles attached to (e.g., welded to) a<br>
metal bristle holder which has a shape of an annular segment of a circular ring.<br>
The bristle holder has a fixed radius and a fixed circumferential length<br>
corresponding to the radius and circumferential length of the surface groove of<br>
the annular casing segment into which the backing plate positioned between the<br>
bristles and the lower-pressure side of the seal with the free ends of the bristles<br>
radially-inwardly-extending beyond the radially-inward end of the backing plate.<br>
Brush seals of the above-mentioned type (German Patent Document DE 39 07<br>
614 A1) are used in turbo-engines, particularly gas turbine engines in order to<br>
seal off spaces with respect to one another with as little leakage flux as possible<br>
on circumferential gaps which are acted upon fluidically by pressure in different<br>
manners, for example, between an engine casing and the rotor or an engine<br>
shaft. It must be possible in this case to compensate eccentric rotor or shaft<br>
position relative to the casing resulting, for example from unbalanced rotor<br>
masses by means of an elastic and movable following of bristles.<br>
Metal brush seals are expensive and can generate excessive heat which precludes then-<br>
use for oil sealing applications. Nonmetallic brush seals using micro-filaments made<br>
from yarns can be used in some applications. However, due to the very small filament<br>
diameter and very small width of the brush seals (about 0.05 inches), these seals can be<br>
used only in low pressure applications.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, a brush seal assembly is provided that includes an elongate brush core<br>
holder, at least three elongate brush core packs bundled together side-by-side in the<br>
brush core holder forming a single assembly. Each brush core pack includes a bristle<br>
holder and a plurality of bristles coupled to the bristle holder.<br>
In another aspect, a rotary machine is provided that includes a rotor having a<br>
longitudinal axis, and a plurality of stator casing segments circumferentially arrayed<br>
together to define a stator casing which is generally coaxially aligned with the<br>
longitudinal axis and which circumferentially surrounds and is radially spaced apart<br>
from the rotor. The rotary machine also includes at least one brush seal assembly that<br>
includes an elongate brush core holder, at least three elongate brush core packs<br>
bundled together side-by-side in the brush core holder forming a single assembly. Each<br>
brush core pack includes a bristle holder and a plurality of bristles coupled to the<br>
bristle holder.<br>
In another aspect, a brush seal assembly is provided that includes an elongate brush<br>
core holder, at least three elongate brush core packs bundled together side-by-side in a<br>
staggered arrangement in the brush core holder. Each brush core pack includes a<br>
bristle holder and a plurality of bristles coupled to the bristle holder.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A rotary machine that includes a brush seal assembly in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention is described in detail below. The brush seal<br>
assembly is formed from multiple brush core packs arranged to achieve an extra wide<br>
packing thickness of the brush seal using micro-filaments. The brush seal assembly<br>
provides a low leakage of micro-fiber brush seals and a relatively high pressure load<br>
capability. A large packing width provides for low leakage rates of the seal which<br>
permits the brush seal assembly to be used in sealing lethal substances. Further, the<br>
brush seal assembly does not generate sparks during operation, and is non-conductive<br>
permitting use in explosive gas sealing, for example, hydrogen sealing in industrial<br>
generators.<br>
Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a rotary<br>
machine 10 and of a brush seal assembly 12 in accordance with an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, and Figure 2 is a schematic cross-sectional view<br>
along lines A-A of rotary machine 10. Rotary machines include, but are not limited to,<br>
an electric generator, or a high, medium, or low pressure turbine of a steam turbine, or<br>
a compressor or turbine section of a gas turbine. Rotary machine 10 includes a rotor<br>
14, stator casing segments 16 and 18, and a plurality of brush seal assemblies 12. In<br>
another embodiment, rotary machine 10 includes one brush seal assembly. Rotor 14<br>
has a longitudinal axis 20. Stator casing segments 16 and 18, as shown in Figure 1, are<br>
circumferentially arrayed together to define a stator casing 22 which is generally<br>
coaxially aligned with the longitudinal axis 20 and which circumferentially surrounds<br>
and is radially spaced apart from rotor 14. Stator casing segments 16 and 18 each<br>
have a surface groove 24 which together define a circumferential channel which is<br>
generally coaxially aligned with longitudinal axis 20 and which is open to rotor 14. In<br>
one alternate embodiment, stator casing 22 is formed from one stator casing segment<br>
16, and in another alternate embodiment, stator casing 22 is formed from more than<br>
two stator casing segments 16. In the exemplary embodiment, a spacer 26 secure<br>
brush seal assemblies 12 in surface groove 24 of the stator casing segments 16 and 18.<br>
In alternate embodiments, stator casing 22 does not include a surface groove and brush<br>
seal assembly 12 is coupled to stator casing 22 by other suitable methods, for example,<br>
by fasteners, by adhesives, by clips, and a combination thereof.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, brush seal assembly 12 includes an elongate brush core holder<br>
28 and a plurality of brush core packs 30. Brush core holder 28 bundles brush core<br>
packs 30 together to form a single assembly 12. Brush core holder 28 has a first side<br>
32 and a second side 34. Brush core packs 30 are bundled together in holder 28 in a<br>
side-by-side arrangement that extends from first side 32 to second side 34 of brush<br>
core holder 28. Each brush core pack 30 includes a plurality of bristles 36 extending<br>
from a base portion 38. In the exemplary embodiment, brush core packs are arranged<br>
in a staggered or off-set arrangement where base portion 38 of brush core pack 30<br>
positioned immediately adjacent first side 32 of holder 28 is off-set from base portion<br>
38 of the immediately adjacent brush core pack 30, which is in turn off-set from the<br>
next immediately adjacent brush core pack 30, and so on across the width of holder 28,<br>
as shown in Figure 3. In an alternate embodiment, brush core packs 30 are arranged<br>
so that base portions 38 are not off-set from each other. In other alternate<br>
embodiments, brush core packs 30 are arranged in groups with base portions 38 of<br>
packs 30 in the group are arranged with no off-set and base portions 38 of a group of<br>
brush core packs 30 are off-set from base portions 38 an adjacent group of core packs<br>
30.<br>
Brush core packs 30 are fabricated by any suitable brush manufacturing process. For<br>
example, in the exemplary embodiment, as shown in Figure 4 and 5, brush core packs<br>
30 are fabricated by wrapping bristles 36 around a core wire 40 and clamping bristles<br>
36 in place with a bristle holder or clamp 42. This brush core fabrication method is<br>
known and is common practice among brush manufacturers. In an alternate<br>
embodiment one end of bristles 36 are fixedly attached to bristle holder 42. Bristles 36<br>
can be formed from any suitable material, for example, textile yarn filaments, plastic<br>
filaments, ceramic filaments and carbon fiber filaments. In an alternate embodiment,<br>
bristles 36 are replaced by a woven cloth. In the exemplary embodiment, bristles 36<br>
are formed from micro-filaments, however, in other embodiments, larger filaments can<br>
be used.<br>
In one embodiment, the width of multi-core brush seal assembly 12 is about 0.05 inch<br>
to about 1.0 inch. In another embodiment, the width of brush seal assembly is about<br>
0.05 to about 0.8 inch, and in still another embodiment, about 0.05 inch to about 0.1<br>
inch.<br>
Figure 6 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a brush seal assembly 50 in accordance<br>
with another embodiment of the present invention. Brush seal assembly 50 includes<br>
brush core packs 52 positioned adjacent first and second side 32 and 34 of brush core<br>
holder 28 that include bristles 54 formed from a different material than bristles 36 of<br>
the remaining brush core packs 30 of assembly 50. Brush seal assembly 50 is useful in<br>
highly turbulent and aggressive applications where bristles 54 of core packs 52 are<br>
subject to turbulence. For example, in one embodiment, bristles 54 have stiffer or<br>
larger diameter filaments than bristles 36 of brush core packs 30. In another<br>
embodiment, brush core packs 52 include bristles 54 made from a different material<br>
than bristles 36 of core packs 30.<br>
Figure 7 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a brush seal assembly 60 in accordance<br>
with another embodiment of the present invention. Brush seal assembly 60 includes a<br>
plurality of alternating brash core packs 62 and 64. In one embodiment, brush core<br>
packs 62 include bristles 66 made from a different material than bristles 68 of core<br>
packs 64. In another embodiment, brush core packs 62 include bristles 66 having a<br>
stiffer or thicker diameter filaments than bristles 68 of core packs 64.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of various specific embodiments, those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification<br>
within the spirit and scope of the claims.<br>
