COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a computer aided design system<br>
and a computer aided design method which transform the shape of a<br>
member into an objective curved surface shape.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Today, there is a desire to shorten processes from<br>
planning, to design and production to respond to consumer<br>
demand. In order to improve the efficiency of design and<br>
production processes, the use of CG (Computer Graphics) and<br>
CAD (Computer Aided Design) systems is popular. In order to<br>
depict shapes having complex curved lines or curved surface<br>
shapes, such as for motor vehicles, domestic electric<br>
appliances or the like, on a computer, the following<br>
processing methods have conventionally existed.<br>
The first is solid modeling, where simple shapes called<br>
primitives, are held in a computer, and operations to combine<br>
the shapes with each other are repeated in order to express<br>
complex shapes. A primitive is for example a column, a cube,<br>
a hexahedron, a torus, a ball, or the like, and in the solid<br>
modeling, shapes are represented by set operations on these<br>
primitives. Therefore, in order to produce a complex shape<br><br>
many steps are required and precise calculations are required.<br>
The second is surface modeling, which utilizes an<br>
algorithm such as a bezier, b-spline, rational bezier, NURBS<br>
(Non-Uniform Rational b-spline), or the like in order to<br>
perform operations such as cutting or connecting lines or<br>
surfaces, and by repeating these operations complex free<br>
curved lines or curved surfaces are represented.<br>
However, even with a model where there are no problems<br>
from the point of representation with the solid model or<br>
surface model described above, in some cases problems may<br>
occur in the case where it is used by a downstream application<br>
such as CAM, CAE, or the like. This is caused by differences<br>
between the support element to be supported by the produced<br>
computer graphics, and the support element to be supported by<br>
the other computer graphics, computer aided design, and<br>
downstream applications, and differences in shape definition,<br>
or the like. The model is corrected via an application such<br>
as a translator which modifies these differences (Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 2001-250130, Hei 11-65628,<br>
Hei 10-69506, Hei 4-134571, Hei 4-117572, and Hei 1-65628).<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
However, the above described correcting operations are<br>
extremely ineffective for shortening the design and production<br>
processes. The reasons for requiring the corrections vary<br>
depending on each case, but the point which becomes a problem,<br>
particularly in the production stage is that the<br><br>
representations of all curved lines and curved surfaces are<br>
approximated by Euclidean geometry in a conventional computer<br>
graphics or computer aided design system. For example, in the<br>
case where a saddle type tabulated cylinder surfaces shown in<br>
FIG. 6 is generated by a sweep operation, a long line in the<br>
lower slope part of the saddle and a short line in the central<br>
part of the saddle exist. Therefore, this sweep operation is<br>
a transformation accompanied with graphical expansion and<br>
contraction in order to maintain the continuity of the curved<br>
surface generated. However, in the conventional computer<br>
graphics or computer aided design system, this expansion and<br>
contraction is not considered, and the internal representation<br>
is approximately represented as a cylinder type. Therefore,<br>
if the computer graphics model or computer aided design model<br>
which are actually approximately represented by such Euclidean<br>
geometry, are passed to a CAE, the error occurring here<br>
becomes a problem in production.<br>
The present invention has been devised to solve such<br>
problems, with an object of providing a computer aided design<br>
system and a computer aided design program which can greatly<br>
utilize a computer graphics model or a computer aided design<br>
model, and can improve the efficiency of design and production<br>
processes.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereunder is a description of an embodiment of a computer<br>
aided design system of the present invention, with reference<br>
to the drawings. FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a<br>
configuration of the computer aided design system of the<br>
present embodiment. The computer aided design system of the<br>
present embodiment comprises; a central processor such as<br><br>
central processing unit (CPU) or the like (not shown), a<br>
storage memory such as a ROM, RAM, or the like mot shown), a<br>
database 10, a graphic display processing section 11, a<br>
display section 12, an output section 13, and a communication<br>
section (not shown).<br>
The CPU reads out an analysis program 1, a converting<br>
program 2, and a reproducing program 3 stored in a ROM and<br>
executes a series of processes related to free-form surface<br>
analysis, conversion, and reproduction. The RAM is a<br>
semiconductor memory in which the CPU primarily stores data.<br>
The analysis program 1 is a program which executes in the<br>
CPU, a process for reading in actual measurement value data 20<br>
of a three-dimensional shaped body by CAT (computer aided<br>
testing) or the like, or other computer aided design format<br>
data 21 (graphics data represented for example by a surface<br>
model such as a solid model, a bezier, a b-spline, a rational<br>
bezier, or a NURBS), creating a point sequence information<br>
table 30, a table 31 of coefficients of the first fundamental<br>
form, and a table 32 of coefficients of the second fundamental<br>
form, and then storing this in the database 10.<br>
The point sequence information table 30 comprises point<br>
sequence information (u, v) for on a curved surface expressed<br>
in a parameter form of;<br>
S(U, v)= {X (U, V), y(U, V), Z(u, V)} 0≤ U, V≤1 .... (equation 1)<br>
as shown in FIG. 2. For example, assuming that u = 0, 1/m,<br>
2/m, to m-1/m (m is a natural number) and v = 0, 1/n, 2/n, to<br><br>
n-1/n (n is a natural number), the curved surface shown in<br>
FIG. 2 is divided into an m x n mesh. In this case, the point<br>
sequence information (u, v) becomes an mn data sequences from<br>
the mesh ID1 to IDmn.<br>
The table 31 of coefficients of the first fundamental<br>
form comprises coefficients of the first fundamental form E,<br>
F, and G derived from the following equations. In the case<br>
where u and v described above have a functional relation, then<br>
s (u, v) denotes a curved line on the curved surface, the<br>
partial derivative δs/δu = Su denotes a tangent vector of a<br>
curved line of u = constant, and the partial derivative δs/δv<br>
= Sv denotes a tangent vector of a curved line of v =<br>
constant. At this time, the fundamental vectors Su and Sv<br>
form a tangent plane of the curved surface. Moreover, a<br>
vector ds linking two points on the curved surface, from s (u,<br>
v) to s (u+du, v+dv), is represented by:<br>
ds = Sudu + svdv .... (equation 2)<br>
Here, the square of the absolute value of ds is<br>
represented by:<br>
(ds)2 = ds • ds = Su2 (du)2+ 2su • Svdudv + sv2 (dv)2... (equation 3)<br>
The coefficients of the first fundamental form described<br>
above are defined from the fundamental vector of the curved<br>
surface by the following equation:<br>
E = Su2, F = Su • Sv. G = Sv2... (equation 4)<br>
The coefficients of the first fundamental form E, F, and<br>
G described above are uniquely determined for the respective<br><br><br>
meshes in this way. The table 31 of coefficients of the first<br>
fundamental form stores the values for the respective meshes<br>
ID1 to IDmn.<br>
Moreover, combining the abovementioned equation 3 and<br>
equation 4 gives:<br><br>
The table 32 of coefficients of the second fundamental<br>
form comprises coefficients of the second fundamental form L,<br>
M, and N derived from the following equations. Assuming that<br>
ω is an angle between the fundamental vectors Su and Su, then<br>
their inner product F, and the absolute value H of the vector<br>
product of the fundamental vectors, are represented as follows<br>
using the coefficients of the first fundamental form:<br><br>
Then using this calculated value H, the unit normal<br>
vector n on the curved surface is represented by:<br><br>
Moreover, as shown in FIG. 3, the pencil of lines of the<br>
tangent vectors at a point P on the curved surface exists in<br>
this tangent plane, and a unit tangent vector t of these is<br>
represented by the following equation:<br><br>
The plane determined by t and n as shown in FIG. 3 is<br><br>
called a normal plane.<br>
The curvature k at the point P on this normal section<br>
plane is called a normal curvature. Differentiating t for the<br>
arc length s on the normal section plane gives:<br><br>
Multiplying both equations by the normal vector, and<br>
introducing the following coefficients of the second<br>
fundamental form:<br><br>
The coefficients of the second fundamental form L, M, and<br>
N described above are uniquely determined for the respective<br>
meshes in this way. The table 32 of coefficients of the<br>
second fundamental form stores the values for the respective<br>
meshes ID1 to IDmn.<br>
If equation 5 is substituted in equation 12, the<br>
following equation is obtained.<br><br>
From the above, the normal curvature is computed from the<br>
coefficients of the first fundamental form and the<br>
coefficients of the second fundamental form.<br><br>
The converting program 2 is a program which executes on a<br>
computer a process for; reading out the necessary information<br>
for a free-form surface from the point sequence information<br>
table 30, the table 31 of coefficients of the first<br>
fundamental form, and the table 32 of coefficients of the<br>
second fundamental form, then creating free-form surface data,<br>
and transforming this into a form which an other computer<br>
aided design application can interpret.<br>
The reproducing program 3, similarly to the converting<br>
program 2, is a program which executes on a computer a process<br>
for; reading out the necessary information for a free-form<br>
surface from the point sequence information table 30, the<br>
table 31 of coefficients of the first fundamental form, and<br>
the table 32 of coefficients of the second fundamental form,<br>
then creating free-form surface data, and outputting to the<br>
graphic display processing section 11.<br>
The database 10 stores the above described point sequence<br>
information table 30, the table 31 of coefficients of the<br>
first fundamental form, and the table 32 of coefficients of<br>
the second fundamental form, and writes in the output result<br>
of the analysis program 1 in association with a mesh ID<br>
described later.<br>
The graphic display processing section 11 performs<br>
graphic display processing on the output results from the<br>
reproducing program, and other computer aided design<br>
applications.<br>
The display section 12 displays the output results of the<br><br>
graphic display processing section 11.<br>
The output section 13 outputs the output results of the<br>
graphic display processing section 11 to the communication<br>
section, other recording media, or the like. The<br>
communication section transfers data such as the point<br>
sequence information, the coefficients of the first<br>
fundamental form, and the coefficients of the second<br>
fundamental form stored in the database 1 to other severs or<br>
clients via a network such as a LAN, the Internet, or the<br>
like.<br>
Next is a description of a series of processing flows<br>
related to the free-form surface analysis, conversion, and<br>
reproduction by the computer aided design system of the<br>
present embodiment, with reference to the drawings. FIG. 4 is<br>
a flowchart showing a processing flow from free-form surface<br>
analysis to data transfer, by the analysis program 1.<br>
By the user's operation, the CPU receives an analyze<br>
command for the actual measurement value data 20 or other<br>
computer aided design format data 21, reads out the analysis<br>
program 1 from ROM, and executes the free-form surface<br>
analyzing process. Firstly, the CPU performs a process for<br>
extracting a plurality of point sequences on a curved surface<br>
such as a two-dimensional NURBS surface, bicubic surface, or<br>
the like, held by the actual measurement value data 20 or the<br>
other computer aided design format data 21. Then, a curved<br>
surface is generated from this point sequence using the other<br>
computer aided design system (step S1 in FIG. 4), and the<br><br>
curved surface is divided into a predetermined mn mesh number<br>
as shown in FIG. 2, after which the respective mesh parts are<br>
standardized by fundamental vectors Su and Sv. The point<br>
sequence information (u, v) generated during the<br>
standardization is written in the point sequence information<br>
table 30 held by the database 10, in association with the mesh<br>
ID.<br>
Next, the CPU executes differential geometric analysis<br>
processing. That is, it performs processing for computing the<br>
coefficients of the first fundamental form E, F, and G defined<br>
by the fundamental vectors Su and Sv which form the tangent<br>
plane of the mesh. The computed coefficients of the first<br>
fundamental form E, F and G, similarly to the point sequence<br>
information, are written in the table 31 of coefficients of<br>
the first fundamental form held by the database 10, in<br>
association with the mesh ID. Moreover, the CPU performs a<br>
process for computing the coefficients of the second<br>
fundamental form L, M, and N defined by the fundamental<br>
vectors Su and Sv and an unit normal vector n of the mesh.<br>
The computed coefficients of the second fundamental form L, M,<br>
and N, similarly to the coefficients of the first fundamental<br>
form E, F and G, are written in the table 32 of coefficients<br>
of the second fundamental form held by the database 10, in<br>
association with the mesh ID.<br>
Moreover, the CPU performs processing for computing an<br>
integrable condition which is a condition where the<br>
differential equation representing the above described mesh is<br><br>
continuous at the respective boundaries of the mesh, in other<br>
words, a condition where this differential equation has a<br>
unique solution.<br>
Now, the curved surface coordinates (u, v) described<br>
above are substituted by (u1, u2) and the point is made p (u1,<br>
u2). If a curved line formed by fixing u2 and moving ul is<br>
called a ul curved line, and a curved line formed by fixing ul<br>
and moving u2 is called a u2 curved line, then assuming that p<br>
(u1, u2) on the curved surface is the initial point, then the<br>
tangent vector along the ul curved line and the u2 curved line<br>
can be calculated as follows:<br><br>
Then, the unit normal vector n can be calculated from el<br>
and e2 as follows:<br><br>
In this way, three vectors {el, e2, n} are defined for<br>
the respective points on the curved surface.<br>
For the respective points, first fundamental quantities<br>
E, F and G are defined as follows:<br><br>
Then, a first fundamental tensor (gij, i, j = 1, 2) is<br>
defined as follows:<br><br>
Moreover, four numerical sets gij, i, j = 1, 2 are defined<br><br>
as follows.<br><br>
Furthermore, for the respective points, second<br>
fundamental quantities L, M and N are defined as follows:<br><br>
Then, a second fundamental tensor (hij, i, j = 1, 2) is<br>
defined as follows:<br><br>
Now, if the dynamic frame {e1, e2, n} is differentiated<br>
by the curved surface coordinates (u1, u2), structural<br>
equations of a curved surface shown by the following two<br>
equations (Gaussian equation of equation 21 and Weingarten's<br>
equation of equation 22) are obtained:<br><br>
where equation 23 exhibits the Christoffel symbol.<br>
The integrable condition of these structural equations 21<br>
and 22 is shown by the following two equations (the Gaussian<br>
equation of equation 24 and the Mainardi-Codazzi's equation of<br>
equation 25):<br><br><br><br>
where equation 26 exhibits the Riemann-Christoffel curvature<br>
tensor.<br>
In the case where the first fundamental tensor (gij, i, j<br>
= 1, 2) and the second fundamental tensor (hij, i, j = 1, 2)<br>
are applied as the function of the curved surface coordinate<br>
(u1, u2) and they satisfy the Gaussian equation and the<br>
Mainardi-Codazzi's equation described above, the shape of the<br>
curved surface having such g±j and h^ is uniquely determined<br>
(refer to Bonnet's fundamental theory). Therefore, the<br>
respective meshes become C2 continuous.<br>
The CPU performs these arithmetic processes and<br>
calculates the integrable condition described above (step S2).<br>
Next, the CPU executes a line of curvature analyzing<br>
process, a feature line analyzing process, and a<br>
curvature/girth length converting process (step S3). Firstly,<br>
the principal curvatures k1 and K2 in the mesh are calculated<br>
based on the coefficients of the first fundamental form E, F<br>
and G, and the coefficients of the second fundamental form L,<br>
M and N by the line of curvature analyzing process (step S4).<br>
That is to say, firstly the extremum of the curvature K1<br>
described above is calculated. The shape of the normal<br>
section plane, which is the line of intersection of the normal<br><br>
plane and the curved surface, changes together with the<br>
tangential direction, and accompanied by this, the normal<br>
curvature also changes. This shape returns to the initial<br>
condition when the normal plane is half rotated. Now,<br>
assuming that;<br><br>
and rewriting K as the function k (y) of y, gives:<br><br>
From this quadratic equation of <br>
becomes the extremum. Then, if equation 15 is differentiated<br>
in this condition for the extremum, and K and γ are rewritten<br><br>
is obtained. Then, if it is substituted in equation 16,<br><br>
is obtained. The following relations are obtained from these<br>
equations:<br><br>
If equation 18 is modified,<br><br><br>
is obtained. The coefficient of K is positive from equation<br>
7. Assuming that the roots are k1 and K2, the value becomes<br>
the principal curvature as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Next, the Gaussian curvature or the mean curvature are<br>
calculated based on the principal curvature (step S5). That<br>
is, from the relation of the roots and the coefficients of the<br>
quadratic equation,<br><br>
is expressed. Here, Km is the mean curvature and K0 is the<br>
Gaussian curvature. When Kq = 0, this is the case where the<br>
curved surface becomes the developable surface as shown in<br>
FIG. 6, and the line of curvature on the curved surface<br>
becomes a straight line. In the present embodiment, the point<br>
where this Gaussian curvature becomes zero is assumed to be<br>
the reference point of transformation described later.<br>
As an appropriate point for the reference point of<br>
transformation other than this point, for example, lines of<br>
curvature, borderlines (ridgelines), isoclinic orthogonal<br>
lines shown in FIG. 7, principal curvature extremum lines<br>
shown in FIG. 8, isoclinic extremum lines shown in FIG. 9, or<br>
umbilicus points may be selected. These are points or lines<br>
which become a reference point or a reference line of<br>
transformation defined by changing patterns of one or more<br><br>
feature quantities among the principal curvature, the<br>
principal direction, the Gaussian curvature, the mean<br>
curvature and the line of curvature, which are feature<br>
quantities showing the feature of the curved surface. It is<br>
possible to calculate these based on the coefficients of the<br>
first fundamental form and the coefficients of the second<br>
fundamental form.<br>
Moreover, the line of curvature showing the principal<br>
direction of the mesh is calculated based on the principal<br>
curvature. That is, eliminating  from equation 19 gives:<br><br>
Both these two equations are equations of the line of<br>
curvature and the quadratic equation so that Y1 and Y2 have the<br>
following relations:<br><br>
At a point on the curved surface, the curvature becomes<br>
the extremum in the direction determined by Y1 and Y2. The<br>
tangent vector on the curved surface is (Sudu + Svdv) and the<br>
inner product of the two tangent vectors corresponding to Y1<br>
and Y2 becomes:<br><br>
If inside the bracket {} is converted then:<br><br><br>
becomes zero. That is, it is found that the two tangential<br>
directions of the normal section plane of the principal<br>
curvature become orthogonal. This direction is called the<br>
principal direction. In the case where this direction and the<br>
tangent line on the curved surface are matched, this becomes<br>
the lines of curvature shown in FIG. 10.<br>
From the above, the calculation process of the line of<br>
curvature showing the principal direction of the mesh is<br>
performed.<br>
Next, the curvature/girth length converting process is<br>
performed (step S6). That is, the CPU calculates the girth<br>
length based on the curvature which is calculated based on the<br>
coefficients of the first fundamental form E, F, and G and the<br>
coefficients of the second fundamental form L, M, and N.<br>
Along the line of curvature calculated by the line of<br>
curvature calculating process described above, the radius of<br>
curvature is calculated from the curvature (1/r), and the<br>
girth length of the line of curvature is expanded and<br>
contracted in each calculation interval.<br>
From the above, the analyzing process is performed.<br>
Next, after the point sequence information, the<br>
coefficients of the first fundamental form, and the<br>
coefficients of the second fundamental form, which were<br>
generated and extracted at step S1 and step S2, have been<br>
collected (Yes in step S7), the CPU performs the curved<br>
surface data transferring process (step S9). On the other<br>
hand, in the case where such information has not been<br><br>
completed, the database evaluating process is performed (No in<br>
step S7). That is, the shape reproduced based on the<br>
principal direction, the reference position (point, line, or<br>
the like), the transformed amount, that were calculated at<br>
steps S4 to S6, and the shape reproduced based on the point<br>
sequence information, the coefficients of the first<br>
fundamental form, and the coefficients of the second<br>
fundamental form are compared, and in the case where they<br>
match (Yes in step S8), the curved surface data transferring<br>
process is performed (step S9). Moreover, in the case where<br>
they do not match (No in step S8), an accuracy improving<br>
process by approximation and interpolation is performed. That<br>
is, the initial curved surface is approximated and<br>
interpolated so that it becomes doubly differentiable, and the<br>
processes described above are repeatedly performed again from<br>
step SI. Then, at the stage where the comparative evaluation<br>
in step S8 is matched, the flow shifts to the curved surface<br>
data transferring process.<br>
The curved surface data is transferred to the converting<br>
program 2 or the reproducing program 3 shown in FIG. 1. If<br>
the CPU receives a convert command, it executes the converting<br>
program 2. That is, firstly assuming that a point selected as<br>
a feature point or a feature line, where the Gaussian<br>
curvature becomes zero, is the transformation reference, the<br>
line of curvature is expansion and contraction transformed by<br>
the girth length in the line of curvature direction so that<br>
the mesh or the curved surface is reproduced. Then, a<br><br>
plurality of point sequences on the curved surface are<br>
extracted from the reproduced mesh or curved surface, and the<br>
point sequences are converted according to a graphical<br>
representation algorithm in an other computer aided design<br>
system. The converted graphics data is reproduced by the<br>
other computer aided design application 22 and then output to<br>
the graphic display processing section 11. The graphic<br>
display processing section 11 performs graphic display<br>
processing of the data output from the computer aided design<br>
application 22 and outputs this to the display section 12.<br>
The display section 12 receives the input of the display data<br>
and displays this.<br>
Moreover, if the CPU receives a reproduction command, it<br>
executes the reproducing program 3. The reproducing program<br>
makes the CPU to execute the processes in the converting<br>
program except for the converting process. That is, assuming<br>
that a point where the Gaussian curvature becomes zero, is the<br>
transformation reference, the line of curvature is expansion<br>
and contraction transformed by the girth length in the line of<br>
curvature direction so that the mesh or the curved surface is<br>
reproduced. Then, the reproduced graphics data is output to<br>
the graphic display processing section 11, and after display<br>
processing, it is displayed in the display section 12.<br>
As described above, according to the computer aided<br>
design system of the present embodiment, an effect can be<br>
obtained where a free-form surface can be analyzed, converted<br>
and reproduced while retaining the continuity of the C2<br><br>
continuous. Therefore, an effect can be obtained where the<br>
utility value of a computer aided design model can be greatly<br>
increased, and the efficiency of the design and production<br>
processes can be improved.<br>
In the computer aided design system of the present<br>
embodiment, the description is for a series of processes<br>
related to free-form surface analysis, conversion, and<br>
reproduction in a computer aided design model. However, the<br>
computer aided design system of the present invention is not<br>
limited to this, and is applicable to a computer graphics<br>
system, or a system and a program which performs graphical<br>
representation using a computer.<br>
Moreover, in the computer aided design system of the<br>
present embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2, as a suitable example,<br>
a curved surface is divided into meshes, and then standardized<br>
by the fundamental vectors Su and Sv, so that the free-form<br>
surface analysis, conversion, and reproduction are performed<br>
by a u, v parameter form which uses point sequence information<br>
(u, v). However, the computer aided design system of the<br>
present invention is not limited to this, and coordinate<br>
values for (x, y, z) coordinate parameters may be used.<br>
The computer aided design system described above contains<br>
a computer system inside. Moreover steps of a series of<br>
processes related to the aforementioned free-form surface<br>
analysis, conversion, and reproduction are stored in a<br>
computer readable recording media in program format. A<br>
computer reads out and executes this program, to thereby<br><br>
perform the above processes. Here, the computer readable<br>
recording media is for example a magnetic disk, magneto-<br>
optical disk, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, semiconductor memory or the<br>
like. Moreover, the arrangement may be such that this<br>
computer program is delivered to a computer by a communication<br>
line, and the computer which receives this delivery, executes<br>
the program.<br><br>
