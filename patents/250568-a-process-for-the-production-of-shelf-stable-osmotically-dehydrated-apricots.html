				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for the production of shelf-stable osmotically dehydrated apricots<br>
PRIOR ART<br><br>
The quality of apricots depends on their stage of ripening. Apricots usually ripen on the trees and are harvested after ripening only. Quality of apricots is reduced if harvested in semiripened stage as they do not ripen further satisfactorily after plucking. But ripe apricots are very delicate and do not have an adequate shelf life of even 24 hrs at ambient temperature. As such, they can be nicely picked and stored in a ripe state from the trees, if cooled to a refrigerated temperature since cooling slows overripening and prevents excessive softening.<br>
The invention relates to methods that enable the development, production and packaging of osmotically dehydrated apricots Partially dried apricots are a snack and fruit coktail favourite of thousands of people. They are excellent fruits, which are highly nutritious in fresh form. Unfortunately, fresh apricots are available in seasons for only limited periods of time. Canned apricots are available which are used as garnishing for ice creams. But the liquid in the can will typically amount to 50% of the canned weight and, due to heat processing, the quality of the fruit is somewhat degraded. In some cases, they lose most of their texture during storage in the cans. Due to very short shelf life and large availability in the equally short season, there is current need for improving the quality of apricots for use as snacks, fruit cocktails and the like and ensuring a year round source of apricots suitable for a variety of food applications. Apricots have been the subjects of several prior art processes, but to date they are still limited and are available only in a few forms. Thus, apricots are currently considered underutilized for their beneficial healthy-diet advantages.<br>
Whole apricots are generally dried to a moisture content of 17 to 23%. Retention of colour during dehydration and storage is achieved by the addition of SO2 or sulfites to the fruits. A substantial market exists for use of fruits in products such as yogurts, fruit creams/cocktails and ice creams etc. Up to now apricot fruits of satisfactory quality at reasonable costs are not available for such uses. Canned apricots tend to be too soft and 'mushy', they are bulky to store and inconvenient to use since cans have to be opened and contents have to be drained off carefully. Frozen fruits are likewise unsuitable for ice creams because they are too hard, lack flavour, have to be thawed with subsequent drip, are not sweet enough and are generally less than satisfactory.<br>
Lewis et al in US patent No.5256 438 (1993) have claimed ready to eat preserved edible fruits/fruit products (apricot has been mentioned) which consist of natural fruit or fruit pieces, which have been dehydrated to a soluble solids level of 40 to 60%, a moisture level of 35 to 55% and a water activity level of 0.75 to 0.90 and to processes of producing such products and foods containing such products. The products remain unfrozen at temperature with the range of 0 to -25째C.<br><br>
However, the above process suffers from many disadvantages. In the above process Lewis et al, have not studied the shelf stability of the product processed at ambient temperature whereby them is a chance of browning. Moreover the process claimed that the product is to be paateurized after storage. Since browning is not a problem in this case, they did not used any anti browning agents'.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 4,390,550, Khan, at al., disoclose Infusing fruit (apricots not mentioned) with sugar solutes to reduce the watar activity by creating sites for removing part of the water content and bathing the fruit in sugar bath to Infuse sugar therein. The bath is a fructose-containing com syrup of about 70 to 80% sugar solids with 40 to 90% being fructose and/or dextrose, resulting in fruit having a water activity of 0.45 to 0.65. The fruit is added to cereals.<br>
However, the above process also suffers from disadvantages. In the above process, Khan et al, claimed that the treated fruits contain mostly fructose syrup. As fructose gives more sweetness, the product suffers from the excessive sweet taste. .<br>
Augustine, et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 4,775,545, describe the preparation of a sweetened fruit having a low water activity relative to its moisture content. A dry fruit (apricot not mentioned) is bathed in an aqueous sugar solution having about 70 to 95 weight percent sugar, at least about 75 weight percent of which is fructose. The bath preferably includes an alkaline calcium compound. In the above process Augustine et al, discussed about sweetened fruit in a solution essentially consisted of fructose, where the improvement claimed comprised of drying the fruits prior to soaking to reduce the moisture level at least above 67%.<br>
However, this process also suffers from many disadvantages. Since the fruits are dried before soaking, there is a possibility of loss of flavour as well as other organoleptic qualities.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 5,000,972, Nafisi Movaghar describes a process for drying fruits that includes applying vacuum while infusing with a sugar solution containing an acid and an antimicrobial agent. The objectives seem to be centered on the prevention of enzymatic and nonenzymatic browning without the use of sulfites and apricots are not among the fruits listed for treatment.<br>
In the above process Nafisi-Movaghar et al, used a combination of vacuum and particular infusion of soaking solution containing a sugar having more than 6 carbon atoms and other ingredients to avoid discolouration.<br>
However, this process also suffers from the disadvantage that this process uses antibrowning agent which consumer may not like. Moreover this process is costly due to vacuum infusion.<br>

The invention will be better understood and its advantages more apparent from the following detailed description.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the production of shelf-stable osmotically dehydrated apricots comprising of following steps:<br>
i) preparing infusion solution by making a sugar syrup having a concentration of at least 70째 Brix along with potassium metabisulphite as antibrowning agent and 0.6-0.8% calcium chloride solution; ii) pre-heating the ripe apricots by washing, sized/grading, cutting into halves, removing seeds and blanching in the said infusion solution at 90째C. iii)      soaking  the   said  pre-treated  apricots  in  the   said  infusion<br>
solution at 60째C, rinsing the said apricots; iv)       packaging the said apricots by drying the said rinsed apricots to a moisture content of 25-30%.<br>
The invention is capable of producing soft, shelf-stable osmotically dehydrated apricots having a moisture content of about 25 to 30% and water activity below 0.65. The process comprises the steps of immersing fruits in a bath of sugar syrup having a sugar concentration of about 60% Brix, maintaining the immersion of fruit for about 3 hours at 60째C, removing the fruit from contact with sugar syrup, rising the surface sugar and drying the product to a moisture content of 25-30%. The apricots are rendered shelf stable due to the presence of sugar, low pH and anti-browing agents. Typically, the pH<br>
value will be less than 4.5. The process of the present invention is capab shelf-stable intermediate moisture apricots which can remain shelf sta temperature (28-33째t) and shelf stable for 1 year at refrigerated temperatu uses infusion solution itself for blanching of apricots to avoid enzymatic bi<br>
The process for the production of shelf-stable osmotically dehydrated apri of following steps:<br>
i)         Preparation of infusion solution<br>
The infusion solution comprises of sugar syrup having a concentration of along with about 1000 ppm of potassium metabisulphile (as antibrown: about 0.6-0.8% of calcium chloride solution.<br>
ii)        Pre-treatment of apricots<br>
Ripe apricot fruits are washed, sized/graded, cut into halves, seeds ren blanched at about 90째C for 3 min in the infusion solution prepared in step (i<br>
iii)       Soaking of apricots in the infusion solution<br>
The pre-treated apricots obtained from step (ii) are soaked into the infusior they have an integral sugar content of about 45째 Brix which typically takes 60째C depending upon size of apricots, bath temperature, bath concentration apricots are rinsed to ensure substantial reduction of external surface sugar :<br>
"(iv) Packaging of apricots<br>
The rinsed apricots dried to a final moisture content of 25-30% . This moisture content is highly desirable from the standpoint of texture which it imparts to the apricots. Finally, the apricots are packed in polypropylene pouches.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with working examples, which are intended to be illustrative examples, and are not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention<br>
Working Example 1<br>
10 kgs of pre-treated Khante/Halman variety of apricots were blanched at 90째C for 3 min in a tank which contained infusion solution of about 20 kg of 70째 Brix in such a way that they were fully immersed in the solution. The solution is cooled down to about 60째C and the apricots are kept immersed in the solution for at least 3 hours. Potassium meta bisulphate was used as the anti-browning agent so that the quantity of potassium meta bisulphate in final product does not exceed 500 ppm. The infusion solution was prepared by mixing sugar - 14.00 kg, water - 5.78 kg, calcium chloride 0.16 kg and potassium meta bisulphite - 0.06 kg. Following the infusion for 3 hours, the excess sugar is drained and apricots are then shifted to drier for drying to a final moisture content of 25-30%. The final weight of the product was 3.0 kg.<br>
Working Example 2<br>
10 kgs of pre-treated of apricots were blanched at 90째C for 3 min in a tank which contained infusion solution of about 20 kg of 65째 Brix in such a way that they were fully immersed in the solution. The solution is cooled down to about 60째C and the apricots are kept immersed in the solution for at least 3 hours. Potassium meta bisulphate was used as the anti-browning agent so that the quantity of potassium meta bisulphate in final product does not exceed 500 ppm. The infusion solution was prepared by mixing sugar - 13.00 kg, water - 6.78 kg, calcium chloride 0.16 kg and potassium meta bisulphite - 0.06 kg. Following the infusion for 3 hours, the excess sugar is drained and apricots are then shifted to drier for drying to a final moisture content of 25-30%. The final weight of the product was 3.5 kg.<br>
The present embodiment of the invention, which has been set forth above, was for the purpose of illustration and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. It is to be understood that various changes, adaptations and modifications can be made in the invention described above by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention, which has been defined by following claims<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
