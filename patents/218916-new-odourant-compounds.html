Improvements in or relating to organic compounds<br>
This invention relates to new odorant compounds having musk characteristics, their manufacture and their use in fragrance compositions.<br>
Conventional compounds having musk characteristics have been selected from nitro arêtes, polycyclic aromatics and macro cyclic compounds. However, in recent years there has been great activity to find novel compounds having musk characteristics to replace these conventional musk’s, the use of which is becoming more restricted because of, e.g. environmental concerns.<br>
In recent years, research activity has resulted in the development of new classes of compounds with musk characteristics. EP 472966, for example describes a family of compounds exemplified by the product Helvetolide (1) that is described as having musky, amoretto-like characteristics. Further attempts were made to improve on the olfactory properties of Helvetolide (1) and its related compounds by replacing the gem-darkly group in the aliphatic side chain by a carbonyl group, as disclosed in WO 00/14051, exemplified by compound (2) that has been described as having a stronger musky smell than prior art compounds.<br><br>
Surprisingly, we now found certain unsaturated salicylic carbonyl compounds that have musk characteristics and a high impact in perfume formulations.<br>
Thus, the present invention refers in a first aspect to a compound of formula (1)<br><br><br><br>
wherein<br>
R is CIO to C4 alkyl, for example methyl, ethyl, /-propyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-<br>
butyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl; or<br>
R is vinyl or a linear, branched or cyclic Ca to C4 alchemy. for example propen-1 -yl,<br>
propen-2-yl, or prop-2-en-1-yl, butane, e.g. but-1-en-1-yl, cyclobut-1-en-1-y|, or<br>
butadienyl, e.g. buta-2,4-dien-1-yl;<br>
X is carbonyl or a divalent radical -(CMe2)-;<br>
Y is oxygen or a divalent radical ~(CH2)- ;<br>
the bond between C-a and C-b is a single bond and the bond between C-b and C-c<br>
together with the dotted line represents a double bond; or<br>
the bond between C-a and C-b together with the dotted line represents a double bond<br>
and the bond between C-b and C-c is a single bond.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may comprise one or more choral centers and as such may exist as a mixture of stereoisomers, or they may be resolved as isomeric ally pure forms. Resolving stereoisomers adds to the complexity of manufacture and purification of these compounds and so it is preferred to use the compounds as mixtures of their stereoisomers simply for economic reasons. However, if it is desired to prepare individual stereoisomers, this may be achieved according to methodology known in the art, e.g. preparative HPLC and GC or by stereoselective syntheses.<br>
Preferred compounds of formula (I) are propanoic acid 2'-[1 "-(3"',3"'-dimethylcyclohex-1"'-enyl}ethoxy]-2'-methylpropyl ester, cyclopropanecarboxylic acid 2'-[1"-(3"',3"'-dimethylcyclohex-1"'-enyl)ethoxy]-2'-methylpnDpyl ester, propionic acid 2'-[1"-(5"',5"'-dimethylcyclohex-1"'-enyl)ethoxy]-2'-methylpropyl ester, cyclopropanecarboxylic acid 2'-[1"-(5"',5"'-dimethylcyclohex-1"'-enyl)ethoxy]-2'-methylpropyl ester, propionic acid 1 "-(5"',5"'-dimethylcyclohex-1 "'-enyl)ethoxycarbony I methyl ester, and<br>
30067 PCT 19.11.2003 CS<br><br>
cyclopropanecarboxylic acid 1 "-(5"',5"'-dimethylcyclohex-l '-enyijeinoxy-carbonylmethyl ester.<br>
Particular preferred are compounds of formula (I) wherein the bond between C-b and C-c together with the dotted line represents a double bond and the bond between C-a and C-b is a single bond, e.g. propanoic acid 2'-[1"-(3"',3"'-dimethytcyclDhex-r"-enyl)ethoxy]-2'-methylpropyl ester and cyclopropanecarboxylic acid 2'-[1"-(3"'.3"'-dlmethylcyclohex-1 "'-enyl)ethoxy]-2'-methylpropyl ester.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) having a double bond between C-b and C-c are more powerful and possess more distinct musk notes, while compounds having a double bond between C-a and C-b possess more pronounced fruity, green aspects besides their main must character.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may be used alone or in combination with known odourant molecules selected from the extensive range of natural and synthetic molecules contently available, such as essential oils, alcohols, aldehydes and [ketones, ethers and acetals, esters and lactones, macrocycles and heterocycles, and/or in admixture with one or more ingredients or percipients conventionally used in conjunction with odourants in fragrance compositions, for example carrier materials, and other auxiliary agents commonly used in the art.<br>
The following list comprises examples of town odourant molecules, which may be combined with the compounds of the present invention:<br>
-	ethereal oils and extracts, e.g, cestrum, costus root oi(, oak moss absolute, geranium oil, jasmin absolute, patchouli oil, rose oil, sandalwood oil or ylang-ylang oil;<br>
-	alkohols, e.g. citroneiiol, Ebanol^", eugenol, geraniol. Super Muguet^"^, linalool, phenylethyl alcohol, Sandalore™, terpineol or Timberol™.<br>
-	aldehydes and ketones, e.g. a-amylcinnamaldehyd, Georgywood™,<br>
hydroxycitronellal, Iso E Super™, Isoratdeine™, Hedione™, maltol, methyl cedryl<br>
ketene, methylionone or vanillin;<br>
500G7PCT 19.11.2003 CS<br><br>
-	ether and acetals, e.g. Ambo ,granny( methy( ether, rose oxide or Splrambrene"^.<br>
-	esters and lactones, e.g. benzyl acetate, cedryl acetates, t^-defalcations, Helvetollde® (1), r-undecalactone or delivery acetate.<br>
-	macrocycles, e.g. ambrettolide, ethylene brassylate or Exaltolide®.<br>
-	heterocydes, e.g. Isobutylchinoiine.<br>
However, due to their unique character, the compounds of formula (I) are especially well suited for use in fresh musky accords, woody-spicy or floral-hesperidia compositions as is more specifically illustrated in the Example.<br>
Reference is also made to our cop ending application no, 1039/CHENP/2005<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used In a broad range of fragrance applications, e.g. in any field of fine and functional perfumery, such as perfumes, household products, laundry products, body care products and cosmetics. The compounds can be employed in wide ranging amounts depending upon the specific application and on the nature and quantity of other odourant ingredients, that may be for example, from about 0.001 to about 20 weight percent. In one embodiment compounds of the present invention may be employed in a fabric softener in an amount of about 0.001 to 0.05 weight percent. In another embodiment compounds of the present invention may be used in an alcoholic solution in amounts of about 0.1 to 20 weight percent, more preferably between about 0.1 and 5 weight percent. However, these values should not be limiting on the present invention, since the experienced perfumer may also achieve effects or may create novel accords with lower or higher concentrations.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be employed into the fragrance application simply by direct mixing the fragrance composition with the fragrance application, or they may, in an earlier step be entrapped with an entrapment material such as for example polymers, capsules, microcapsules and nanocapsules, liposome, film formers, absorbents such as for example by using carbon or elites, cyclic oligosaccharides and mixtures thereof, or they may be chemically bound to substrates which are adapted to release the fragrance molecule upon application of an exogenous stimulus such as light, enzyme, or the (il^e, and then mixed with the application.<br><br>
Compounds of formula {)) may be prepared starting from a corresponding ai)yy)c alcohol, which is accessible either by reduction of Artemone (1-(3',3'-dimethylcyclohex-1'-enyl)ethanone; trademark of Givaudan SA, Switzerland), or by Rupe rearrangements of 1-ethynyl-3,3-dimethylcyclohexanol.<br>
By etherification of the corresponding allelic alcohol with isobutylene oxide and subsequent etherification with the corresponding carboxylic acids compounds of formula (I) wherein X Is a divalent radical -(CMe2)-, and Y is oxygen, i.e. oxa esters, may be synthesized.<br>
Compounds of formula (1) wherein X is cartonyl and Y oxygen, i.e. diester, may be synthesized by esterification of the corresponding allylic alcohol with chloroacetic acid, followed by further esterification with the con-esponding carboxylic acids.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) wherein X is carbony! and Y is a divalent radical -(CH2)-, i.e. 0X0 ester, may be prepared by esterification of the corresponding allylic alcohol with the corresponding ox carboxylic acids, e.g. laevulin acid.<br>
Compounds of formula (1) wherein X is a divalent radical -(CMe2)- and Y is a divalent radical -(OHz)-, i.e. oxa ketones may be prepared by etherification of the corresponding allylic alcohol with isobutylene oxide, subsequent oxidation to the aldehyde followed by a Wetting-Horner-Emmons reaction well known in the art and selective hydrogenation of the formed double bond.<br>
Further particulars as to reaction conditions are provided in the examples.<br>
