The invention relates to a system for ensuring that the total force acting on a<br>
shifting mechanism that is used to change the gear ratio in a gearbox does not<br>
exceed a predetermined value.<br>
In accordance with the prior art, the gear shifting mechanisms, such as the shift<br>
forks and the synchronisation mechanisms in manual gearboxes, are constructed so<br>
as to be able to withstand the forces to which they are subjected when operated<br>
manually. On operation of a manual gearbox, the forces employed by the driver<br>
when he operates the gear lever are transmitted by, for example, a mechanical or<br>
hydraulic transmission to the gear shifting mechanism in the gearbox.<br>
In lorries with large motor torques available, the gearboxes will have to be<br>
constructed to withstand these motor torques, and this involves high shifting forces<br>
in order to change gear. The forces required to change gear are in some<br>
constructions so great that the driver needs assistance in the form of power<br>
assistance from some form of assistance system/servo system in order to be able to<br>
operate the gear lever in a comfortable manner. There are many different solutions<br>
which attempt to provide the necessary power assistance to ensure that a gear<br>
change can be made in a comfortable manner. In this connection, reference is<br>
made, for instance, to DE 2223881 which discloses examples of assistance<br>
systems/servo solutions.<br>
Due to the large forces to which the gear shifting mechanism is subjected, it is<br>
necessary to manufacture the gear shifting mechanism parts in such manner that the<br>
construction withstands these forces. However, this need means that the gear<br>
shifting mechanism parts are expensive to manufacture and thus also expensive to<br>
purchase. There is therefore a desire on the part of gearbox manufacturers that<br>
measures should be taken to permit the gear change forces which occur in the gear<br>
shifting mechanism of the gearbox to be limited, so as to reduce the costs that are<br>
traditionally incurred in the manufacture of the parts of the gear shifting mechanism<br>
which are especially heavily loaded during the gear shift operation. If a solution is<br>
achieved in which the forces acting on the gear shifting mechanism are reduced, it<br>
will at the same time be possible to introduce cost-saving coatings or treatment<br>
methods for the synchronisation rings, so that considerable sums can be saved in<br>
production. 'One drawback of such a solution is that the gearboxes are then more<br>
marginally constructed, so that in practice they have lower tolerance for misuse than<br>
before. There is therefore a need for a solution which protects the gearbox whilst<br>
maintaining to the maximum possible extent the desired operating forces.<br>
One solution to this problem in order to limit the forces acting on the gear shifting<br>
mechanism is to introduce a limit on the power assistance that is supplied by the<br>
assistance system. Therefore, in servo-assisted systems, a limit to the maximum<br><br>
power supplied by the servomechanism is introduced. In electronically controlled<br>
servo-assisted systems, this can be achieved by introducing a reduction of the servo<br>
assistance when the estimated total force on the gear shifting mechanism in the<br>
gearbox exceeds a predetermined value. This is done, e.g., in software.<br>
However, it is an object of the present invention to provide a mechanical solution to<br>
the aforementioned problem that is independent of whether a mechanically or<br>
electrically controlled servo assistance system is used.<br>
One approach in order to solve this problem is to obtain a condition-controlled limit<br>
to the assistance system power supply, the controlling conditions for limiting the<br>
power supply being set according to parameters such as the tolerance limit of the<br>
gear shifting mechanism etc. This can be solved by introducing a reducer which<br>
•can work together with the servomechanism and which is capable of providing an<br>
altered power supply to the servomechanism.<br>
The objects of the invention are obtained with the invention as disclosed in the<br>
independent patent claims, embodiments of the invention being disclosed in the<br>
dependent claims of the set of claims. •<br>
According to independent claim 1, a system is provided to ensure that the total force<br>
acting on the gear shifting mechanism does not exceed a predetermined value. It is<br>
presupposed in this connection that the force transmitted from the gear lever to the<br>
gear shifting mechanism receives power assistance from an assistance system. The<br>
system is provided so that a first limit value is used to control the power assistance<br>
having a positive value, and that a second limit value is used to control the power<br>
assistance having a negative value. The power assistance provided by the assistance<br>
system has a value that holds the total force acting on the gear shifting mechanism<br>
constant or reduces the total force acting on the gear shifting mechanism, when the<br>
gear lever force is equal to or greater than a limit value (hereinafter referred to as<br>
the second limit value). The limit value is adjusted according to the durability of the<br>
gear shifting mechanism that is to be used and the other individual properties of the .<br>
system.<br>
If the invention is to be used in a gear shifting mechanism which requires large<br>
forces to effect a shift of the gear ratio, an assistance system is used which provides<br>
power assistance that makes it easier for the driver to change gear, typically a so-<br>
called servo system. The system according to the invention as disclosed in<br>
independent patent claim 2 will have a two-part function wherein:<br>
- the power assistance provided by the assistance system has a value which<br>
increases the total force acting on the gear shifting mechanism, when the gear lever<br>
force is increased within a range in which the gear lever force is equal to or greater<br>
than the first limit value and less than the second limit value; and wherein<br>
- the power assistance provided by the assistance system has a value which<br><br>
holds the total force acting on the gear shifting mechanism constant or reduces the<br>
total force acting on the gear shifting mechanism, when the gear lever force is equal<br>
to or greater than the second limit value.<br>
The system may also be controlled by setting the limit values for the total force<br>
acting on the gear shifting mechanism.<br>
The term "signal transmission" is used below to describe the power transmission<br>
that takes place in the gear shifting system between the gear lever mechanism and<br>
the gear shifting mechanism and the assistance system, respectively. By<br>
transmission of signals in this connection is meant transmission of information<br>
about which input conditions apply to the gear shifting mechanism and the<br>
assistance system. The signal that is transmitted between the gear lever mechanism<br>
and the gear shifting mechanism and the assistance system, respectively, may thus<br>
be of different types. It may be a combined force and motion signal via a rod or<br>
cable, for example, if the gear shifting system is mechanical. The signal<br>
transmission may also be in the form of a pressure signal, for example, if the gear<br>
shifting system is a hydraulic system. The pressure signal transmission may, of<br>
course, also be carried out by pressure mediums other than hydraulic, for example,<br>
pneumatic. Alternatively, the signal transmission may be in the form of an electric,<br>
optical or electromagnetic signal. It should be mentioned that this same term<br>
"signal transmission" will also be used to describe the transmission of pressure,<br>
force and voltage conditions between other components in the system.<br>
If a power-providing device, for example, a servomechanism, is included in the<br>
assistance system, the signal is transmitted from the gear lever to the power-<br>
providing device, and depending upon the value of the signal, power assistance is<br>
transmitted to the gear shifting mechanism. Alternatively, a signal can be<br>
transmitted from the assistance system which represents power assistance to a<br>
power-providing device that is connected tothe gear shifting mechanism.<br>
A signal that corresponds to the signal from the gear lever or that is derived from<br>
this signal is transmitted to a reducer that is provided so that, depending on the<br>
value of the incoming signal, it can adjust the value of a power supply to which the<br>
reducer is connected. This may be a power supply of different kinds such as<br>
pressurised fluid, a voltage source etc. The reducer can transmit a power supply to<br>
the servomechanism, or may alternatively transmit a signal that represents a power<br>
supply, for example, if the power supply is of a kind that must be converted in order<br>
to be compatible with the servomechanism.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the reducer, it comprises at least one measuring unit<br>
and at least one regulator, The measuring unit receives the signal from the gear<br>
lever, or the signal that is derived from the gear lever's signal, and controls the<br>
regulator on the basis of this signal. When the signal from the gear lever represents<br><br>
a value that is equal to or greater than the second limit value, the measuring unit<br>
controls the regulator so that the signal from the reducer to the servomechanism is<br>
or represents a reduced power supply.<br>
When the signal from the gear lever represents a value that is less than the second<br>
limit value, but greater than or equal to the first limit value, the signal that is<br>
transmitted to the servomechanism from, the reducer represents the power supply<br>
that the regulator receives from a source. When the signal from the gear lever<br>
represents a value that is equal to or greater than the second limit value,, the power-<br>
supply from the source is reduced in the regulator, and the value of the signal that is<br>
transmitted to the servomechanism from the reducer is reduced correspondingly.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the power supply can be provided by a<br>
pressurised fluid, and the regulator is made haying a inlet for conducting the<br>
pressurised fluid from the source to a:ca.vity.in the regulator. Arranged in the cavity<br>
is a preloaded regulator piston which is made having a bore for conducting the fluid<br>
to an outlet. Furthermore, the piston causes the opening of an exhaust port when<br>
moved in the direction of its preloading force. When the signal from the gear lever<br>
represents a value that is less than the second limit value, the pressure of the fluid<br>
exiting the outlet is essentially equal to the pressure of the fluid that is supplied to<br>
the regulator. When the signal from the gear lever represents a value that is equal<br>
to or greater than the second limit value, the exhaust port in the regulator is opened<br>
for discharge of fluid from the regulator and the pressure of the fluid that is passed<br>
out of the outlet is thus reduced in accordance with the value of the signal from the<br>
gear lever.<br>
According to a further embodiment it is the case that when the signal from the gear<br>
lever represents a value that is equal to or greater than the second limit value, the<br>
measuring unit controls the regulator so that a force is provided in the regulator<br>
which counteracts/is greater than the preloading of the regulator piston, and<br>
optionally the preloading of the regulator piston valve seat that closes the exhaust<br>
port, the piston thereby opening for discharge of fluid through the exhaust port.<br>
The force that is provided in the regulator can be produced in different ways, and<br>
the measuring unit's control of the regulator can also be effected in different ways.<br>
In one implementation of the invention, the measuring unit comprises two preloaded<br>
pistons that are arranged in the cavity of the measuring unit. The piston rod of the<br>
first piston is placed in a though-going bore that extends through the second piston<br>
and the piston rod of the second piston. When the signal from the gear lever<br>
represents a value that is equal to or greater than the second limit value, a force<br>
against one of the two pistons is provided which counteracts/is greater than the sum<br>
of the preloading of the piston in question, the preloading of the regulator piston<br>
and optionally the preloading of the valve seat. Thus, the piston of the first<br><br>
measuring unit is displaced into abutment against the regulator piston which is also<br>
displaced so that the exhaust port, is opened.<br>
In the case where the reducer with measuring unit as described in the above<br>
paragraph is used in a hydraulic gear shifting system, the force exerted against one<br>
of the two pistons will be provided by the supply of fluid to the measuring unit in<br>
response to the gear lever force. On movement of the gear lever in one direction,<br>
fluid is transferred to the measuring unit so that it exerts pressure against the piston<br>
face of the first piston. On movement of the gear lever in the other direction, fluid is<br>
transferred to a space between the first and the second piston in the measuring unit<br>
so that the fluid exerts pressure against the piston face of the second piston.<br>
In the case where the reducer is used in a mechanical gear shifting system, the<br>
reducer may, in a preferred embodiment, comprise two regulators and one<br>
measuring unit that is disposed between the two regulators. The measuring unit<br>
comprises two preloaded slides that are placed in a cavity in the measuring unit.<br>
Movement of the gear lever with a force that is equal to or greater than the second,<br>
limit value in one direction or the other results in a force being exerted against one<br>
of the two slides that is'greater than,the sum of the preloading of the slide in<br>
question, the preloading of a valve arranged in the cavity of the measuring unit, the<br>
preloading of the regulator piston in question, and optionally the preloading of the<br>
regulator piston valve seat. This results in an opening of the exhaust port with<br>
subsequent pressure regulation of the power supply into the servomechanism.<br>
In what follows the premises of the invention, together with a functional description<br>
and two embodiments of the invention, will be explained with reference to the<br>
attached drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows the forces that arise in the gear shifting mechanism according to the<br>
prior art.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the forces that arise in the gear shifting mechanism according to the<br>
solution principle that forms the basis for the invention.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of the solution principle according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the invention used in a hydraulic gear shifting system.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a reducer that is used in the system in Figure 4.<br>
Figs. 6, 7 and 8 show the invention used in a mechanical gear system.<br>
In Figure 1 the horizontal axis shows the force that the driver exerts on the gear<br>
lever. The vertical axis shows the force that is applied to the gear shifting<br>
mechanism. A standard system without power assistance from an assistance system<br>
will give a force on the gear selector mechanism in the gearbox as a function of the<br>
driver's force on the gear lever. This situation is shown by curve 2, where it is seen<br>
that the force acting on the gear selector mechanism increases proportionally with<br>
the driver's force on the gear lever.<br><br>
Curve 5 shows an example of how the power assistance from the assistance system<br>
will work. At low gear lever forces, the power assistance from the assistance<br>
system will increase as a function of the gear lever forces, and when maximum<br>
power assistance from the assistance system has been reached, the curve will flatten<br>
out and indicate constant supplementary power to the gear selector mechanism in<br>
the gearbox.<br>
The total force that acts on the gear selector mechanism in the gearbox is shown by<br>
curve 6. This curve is the resultant of the gear lever force shown by curve 2 and the<br>
power assistance from the assistance system shown by curve 5.<br>
Curve 1 shows the maximum force that the synchronisation rings of the gearbox.can<br>
withstand. For gear lever forces that are greater than the force value at the point<br>
where the curve 6 intersects the curve 1, an overloading of the gearbox<br>
synchronisation mechanism is a risk. This area is indicated by the reference<br>
numeral 7 in Figure 1.<br>
To prevent the resultant shown by curve 6 from exceeding the maximum tolerance<br>
value of the gear mechanism/synchronisation mechanism, the aim of the present<br>
invention is to provide a system which, with the aid of suitable means, ensures that<br>
the total force acting on the gear mechanism is maintained below the maximum<br>
tolerance value.<br>
A solution principle for such a system is shown in Figure 2. The horizontal'axis<br>
shows the force that the driver exerts on the gear lever. The vertical axis shows the<br>
force that is applied to the gear shifting mechanism. Curve 2 shows, as in Figure 1,<br>
a standard system without power assistance from an assistance system which will<br>
provide a force on the gear selector mechanism in the gearbox as a function of the<br>
driver's force on the gear lever.<br>
Curve 3 shows an example of a solution in which desired protection against<br>
overloading of the gear shifting mechanism is introduced by adjusting the power assistance from an assistance system. As curve 3 illustrates, this is done by reducing the power assistance from the assistance system when the gear lever force<br>
reaches a certain limit value. This solution principle results in the gear shifting<br>
mechanism being loaded with the resultant (illustrated by curve 4) of the gear lever<br>
force (illustrated by curve 2) and the power assistance from the assistance system .<br>
(illustrated by curve). It is seen from Fig. 2 that at low gear lever forces, the power<br>
assistance from the assistance system will increase as a function of the gear lever<br>
forces. At a certain limit value; whether this is a limit value for the gear lever force<br>
or a limit value for the total force on the gear shifting mechanism, the power<br>
assistance from the assistance system will be reduced with increasing gear lever<br>
force, so that the total force on the gear shifting mechanism never exceeds the<br><br>
maximum force allowed. The maximum total force allowed on the gear shifting<br>
mechanism is shown by curve 1.<br>
It is thus seen from Fig. 2 that the power assistance from the assistance system has a<br>
magnitude that increases the total force acting on the gear shifting mechanism when<br>
the gear lever force is increased within a range in which the gear lever force is equal<br>
to or greater than a first limit value and less than a second limit value. Also, the<br>
power assistance from the assistance system has a magnitude that holds the total<br>
force acting on the gear shifting mechanism constant, or reduces the total force<br>
acting on the gear shifting mechanism, when the gear lever force is equal to or<br>
greater than the second limit value.<br>
The value of the maximum total force allowed on the gear shifting mechanism, and<br>
the first and second limit values may vary depending on what type of system is<br>
used. In the example shown in Figure 1, the second limit value of the gear lever<br>
force will be in the range where it is seen that the power assistance from the<br>
assistance system has a reducing effect (see curve 2) on the total force shown by<br>
curve 4, The first limit value of the gear lever force will also be less than the<br>
second limit value, and in the example shown in Figure 2, the first limit value will<br>
be found in the range in which the power assistance from the assistance system<br>
(curve 2) begins to make a positive contribution to the total force on the gear<br>
shifting mechanism (curve 4).<br>
It is seen from Fig. 2 that if the gear lever force is further increased beyond the<br>
range in which the assistance system provides power assistance, the increase in gear<br>
. lever forces will gradually result in the maximum tolerance force (curve 1) being<br>
exceeded. For safety reasons, it may in some cases be desirable to provide the<br>
system so that it is possible for the driver to make a gear change at such high gear<br>
shifting forces,.even though the high gear lever force then results in the maximum<br>
tolerance force of the gear shifting mechanism being exceeded, and there being a<br>
danger of damage to the gear shifting mechanism.<br>
In Figure 3, a functional description of the system according to the invention is<br>
illustrated in the form of a block diagram.<br>
Arrow 6a illustrates the force that the driver applies to the gear lever. The gear<br>
lever mechanism transfers the driver's force load on the gear lever to a signal 6b.<br>
The signal 6b may be a combined force and motion via rod or cable or the like.<br>
Optionally, it may be a hydraulic or pneumatic pressure or an electrical signal.<br>
In most cases, the signal from the gear lever mechanism will actuate the gearbox<br>
gear shifting mechanism 3 directly by signal 6c. In the illustrated case, a servo assistance is included in the assistance system, and the signal from the gear lever<br>
mechanism controls a servomechanism 2. The servomechanism provides power<br><br>
assistance, represented as signal 2a, to the gearbox gear shifting mechanism. Signal<br>
2a and signal 6c represent the total force applied to the gear shifting mechanism in<br>
the gearbox.		<br>
The servomechanism 2 receives a signal 5b which is or represents a power supply.<br>
The signal 5b may, for example, be a pneumatic or hydraulic pressure, or<br>
alternatively a voltage supply signal.<br>
The assistance system further comprises a reducer which is shown within the<br>
marked area 1. The reducer comprises a regulator 5 and a measuring unit 4 which<br>
receives desired gear change force signal from the gear lever mechanism via signal<br>
6b. The measuring unit 4 controls the regulator 5 which is provided so that a power<br>
supply 5a can be adjusted to a desired level 5b, depending on the input signal 6b to<br>
the measuring unit 4. A power source provides the power supply 5a, the power<br>
source, for example, being an air pressure supply, supply of hydraulic pressure,<br>
voltage supply etc.<br>
If the signal 6b is greater than or equal to the first limit value, the power supply 5b<br>
that is delivered to the servomechanism 2 will essentially correspond to the power<br>
supply 5a into the regulator. Under these conditions, the servomechanism provides<br>
power assistance which increases the total force on the gear shifting mechanism,<br>
and which thus makes changing gear easier for the driver of the vehicle. If the<br>
signal 6b is equal to or exceeds the second limit value, the measuring unit 4 will<br>
control the regulator so that the power supply 5a to the regulator is adjusted down in<br>
the regulator, and a reduced power supply 5b to the servomechanism is obtained. It<br>
is thus ensured that the power assistance 2a provided by the servomechanism to the<br>
gear shifting mechanism is limited when the force on the gear lever is greater than<br>
the second limit value. Thus, it is ensured that the total force on the gear shifting<br>
mechanism is maintained at less than or equal to a pre-set value, thereby avoiding a<br>
possible overloading of the shifting mechanism.<br>
The solution principle illustrated in Fig. 3 is, in Fig. 4, implemented in a hydraulic<br>
gear shifting system with pneumatic servo assistance. In the example shown in<br>
Figure 4, the reducer 1 is shown made having a regulator part 5, here shown as a<br>
pneumatic pressure reduction valve 5, which is controlled by a hydraulic measuring<br>
unit 4. Of course, other types of fluid may also be used as pressure medium in the<br>
regulator, and for that matter also in the measuring unit. The detailed construction<br>
of the reducer is shown most clearly in Figure 5. This embodiment of the solution<br>
principle will be described below with reference to both Figure 4 and Figure 5.<br>
The measuring unit 5 is comprised of a cavity 12 that is formed in the reducer 1,<br>
where in the cavity 12 there is arranged a first preloaded piston 13 and a second<br>
preloaded piston 14. It is seen from Figures 4 and 5 that the first piston 13 is<br>
arranged with its piston rod projecting through a bore in the second piston 14, so<br><br>
that the ends of the piston rods of both pistons are placed at a similar distance from<br>
the regulator piston 15. It is also seen in Figures 4 and 5 that the first and the<br>
second piston 13, 14 are preloaded by springs 13a, 14a.<br>
When a gear change is made, hydraulic fluid is transferred through transfer lines to<br>
the servomechanism 2 and to the measuring unit 4. In this embodiment, the<br>
servomechanism 2 comprises a valve unit and a servo actuator. If the gear lever is<br>
moved in the direction of the arrow A, hydraulic fluid is transferred through the<br>
lines 10 to the servomechanism 2 and to the area of thecavity that is above the<br>
piston face of the piston 13b. If the gear lever is moved in the direction of the<br>
arrow B, hydraulic fluid is transferred through lines 11 to the servomechanism 2<br>
and to the area that is above the piston face 14b of the second piston 14.<br>
The pressure that acts against the respective piston faces in each of the two cases is<br>
dependent upon the force that the driver exerts on the gear lever. To obtain<br>
displacement of one piston or the other, the force that acts on the pistons 13 and 14<br>
must have a magnitude and direction that are capable of overcoming the preloading<br>
force of the springs 13a and 14a, respectively.<br>
If the force that is exerted against the piston faces 13b, 14b is less than the second<br>
limit value, sufficient displacement of the respective pistons is not obtained in the<br>
reducer to enable the valve seat 19 of the regulator piston to be opened. A fluid<br>
path is established from a source 16 to the valve unit that is connected to the<br>
servomechanism. Pressurised fluid is passed from the source 16 into an inlet 16a in<br>
the regulator and then through a bore 17 formed in the regulator piston 15, out<br>
through an outlet 21 and then into the valve unit. In this way, it is ensured that the<br>
servomechanism is supplied with a pressure substantially equivalent to the pressure<br>
of the fluid in the source 16. The pressure supply from the reducer 1 to the<br>
servomechanism 2 is determining for the power assistance provided by the<br>
servomechanism to the gear shifting mechanism 3. In this case, the pressure supply<br>
into the servomechanism 2 provides power assistance that helps to increase the total<br>
force acting on the gear shifting mechanism 3.<br>
In the regulator part 5, the regulator piston 15 is shown preloaded by a spring 15a.<br>
If the force acting on one of the pistons 13, 14 is greater than the second limit value,<br>
this will result in the end of the associated piston rod being moved into abutment<br>
against the regulator piston 15. In this case, the piston 13 or 14 transfers a force to<br>
the regulator piston 15 which counteracts the preloading of the regulator piston 15.<br>
The regulator piston 15 is thus displaced downwards into abutment against the valve<br>
seat 19 of the regulator piston which is preloaded by a spring 19a, and furthermore<br>
the force is sufficient to counteract the preloading of the spring 19a so that the<br>
spring is compressed. Thus, the valve seat 19 of the regulator piston is opened and<br>
this allows a discharge of fluid to the exhaust port 20. How large an opening is<br><br>
obtained when the valve seat 19 of the regulator piston is opened, and thus how<br>
much fluid is passed out of the fluid path between the source 16 and the valve unit,<br>
is therefore dependent upon the force acting on the piston faces 13b or 14b. The<br>
greater the force the driver exerts on the gear lever, the greater the force that acts on<br>
the piston faces 13b or 14b, and this means that a greater drawing off of fluid<br>
through the exhaust port 20 is also obtained. The result is then a pressure supply that is down-regulated compared with the pressure of the fluid in the source 16, and<br>
power assistance from the servomechanism which ensures that the total force acting<br>
on the gear shifting mechanism is maintained below a pre-determined value<br>
In Figures 6-8 the solution principle that is illustrated in Figure 3 is implemented in<br>
a mechanical gear shifting system with pneumatic servo assistance. Figure 6 shows<br>
an overview of the mechanical gear shifting system. The term "mechanical gear<br>
shifting system" is used here to mean a cable or rod transmission between gear lever<br>
and gearbox. Figures 7 and 8 show a reducer la for use in such a mechanical gear<br>
shifting system. The reducer la comprises a measuring unit 4 that is disposed<br>
between two regulators .5a and 5b. The reducer's measuring unit in this case<br>
consists of a servo valve. However, the servo actuator is placed outside the reducer<br>
as in the embodiment in Figures 4-5. For'the sake of simplicity, the term<br>
servomechanism 2 is used to refer to the servo actuator in the following.<br>
The regulators 5a, 5b essentially resemble the regulator shown in Figures 4 and 5.<br>
Therefore, to a large extent the same reference numerals have been used as for the<br>
regulator in Figure 4. It is seen that the measuring unit 4' has a different structure<br>
than the measuring unit shown in Figure 4. The measuring unit 4' is double acting<br>
(works in both directions) and comprises two slides 22a, 22b that are preloaded by '<br>
springs 22e and 22d. The force from the gear lever is transferred to the<br>
. servomechanism 2 and the reducer la by a balanced lever (not shown). The lever<br>
has a point of action in the measuring unit 4' of the reducer at an actuating pin 12<br>
that exerts a force on one slide or the other. Depending on whether the gear lever is<br>
moved in a direction corresponding to A or B as shown in Figure 4, the force will<br>
act on either the slide 22a or the slide 22b. The descriptions of the mode of<br>
operation and the structure will thus be identical for both sides of the reducer.<br>
If the system is inoperative, fluid (air) is passed from the source into the regulator<br>
part through the inlet 16a, 16b. The outlet 21a, 21b leads to the side of the<br>
servomechanism 2 which on increase of pressure will move the actuator in the same<br>
direction as the force from the gear lever indicates. The exhaust ports 20 and 24 are<br>
used to release air from the system.<br>
In this case, the outlet 21a, 21b for transfer of pressurised air to the<br>
servomechanism 2 is directly connected to the exhaust port 24 via exhaust port<br><br>
valve seat 26 and a bore 25 inside the slide 22a, 22b. The system as shown in<br>
Figures 7 and 8 is shown in its unloaded state.<br>
When the gear lever force is equal to or greater than the first limit value, but less<br>
than the second limit value, the measuring unit is activated in that the actuating pin<br>
12 exerts a force that presses on one of the slides 22a, 22b and moves it down some<br>
distance so that the spring 22c, 22d which provides preloading of the slide 22a, 22b<br>
is compressed to a certain extent. This in turn means that the force required to<br>
move the slide is a function of spring stiffness and movement path. When the slide<br>
22a, 22b is moved some distance, the exhaust port valve seat 26 will seal against<br>
the valve 27. This means that the outlet 21 to the servomechanism is no longer<br>
vented to the exhaust port 24. Further movement of the slide will therefore als.o<br>
move the valve 27, which in turn compresses the valve spring 28, and also opens for<br>
passage of fluid through the supply valve seat 29. The fluid from the source will be<br>
passed in through the inlet 16a, 16b, through the bore 17 in the regulator piston 15,<br>
then through duct 23 and then into the supply valve seat 29 via slots in the valve<br>
seat 30 where the valve seat 30 rests against the regulator piston 15. These slots are<br>
not shown in the drawing.<br>
The fluid passage that is produced by the valve 27 being moved in the direction of<br>
the supply valve seat 29, is facilitated either in that there is a possibility for<br>
movement of the valve 27 relative to a pin 31 that is received in a recess in the<br>
valve 27 and the regulator piston 15, or that the valve 27 and the pin 31 are moved<br>
relative to the regulator piston 15. Alternatively, the valve 27, the connecting pin<br>
31 and the regulator piston 15 are moved downwards together, the distance between<br>
the regulator piston valve seat 19 and the regulator piston 15 permitting this without<br>
it resulting in the opening of the regulator piston valve seat 19.<br>
Fluid will thus flow out to the servomechanism 2 and make it easier for the driver to<br>
move it. When the servomechanism 2 moves towards the position indicated by the<br>
gear lever, the distance between.desired position (the gear lever) and real position<br>
(servomechanism 2) will be reduced, and the lever mechanism that couples the<br>
regulator to the servomechanism 2 will ensure that once desired position has been<br>
reached, the displacement of the slide 22a, 22b is drawn back towards its original<br>
position. In this way, the described valve mechanism will act as a position<br>
regulator.<br>
The regulator piston 15 can be actuated by the pin 31 that is received in a recess in<br>
the valve 27, the pin 31 also optionally being fastened to the valve. The pin 31 is<br>
not fixed in the regulator piston 15, but can be moved independently thereof. As<br>
has also been mentioned above, the valve 27 moves as a result of the fact that the<br>
force exerted on the gear lever represents a counter-force that is greater than the<br>
preloading of the slide spring 22c, 22d.<br><br>
Furthermore, the top part of the regulator piston 15 may be supplied with<br>
pressurised fluid via the duct 23. The supply from the source that is brought in<br>
through the inlet 16a, 16b comes into the regulator piston 15 to a cavity halfway<br>
between two slide seals as shown in Figures 6 and 7. The net force from the supply<br>
from the source against the regulator piston 15 is virtually zero.. The underside of<br>
the large piston area of the'regulator piston 15 is vented to exhaust port 20 via duct<br>
32, so that there is never a build-up of pressure there.<br>
The sum of the forces from the gear lever that are transferred via the actuating pin<br>
12, and the force component from the pressure in the duct 23 against the top of the<br>
regulator piston 15 will seek to press the regulator piston 15 downwards, thus compressing the spring 15a. On a certain force from the gear lever mechanism,<br>
depending upon the spring stiffness of the slide spring 22c or 22d + valve spring 28<br>
+ spring 15a for the regulator piston, the regulator piston 15 will abut against the<br>
regulator piston valve seat 19 and thus close off the supply from the source through<br>
the inlet 16a, 16b.	,<br>
If the driver stops the movement of the gear lever there, the servomechanism 2 will<br>
use some of the air from the outlet 21a or 21b, and thus the air pressure above the<br>
regulator piston 15 will drop, and the piston-will be pushed back by the spring 15a<br>
until the regulator piston 15 is lifted from the regulator piston valve seat 19 and<br>
again lets fluid into the measuring unit/servo valve. (The same applies in the case of<br>
the embodiment shown in Figs. 4 and 5).<br>
If, on the other hand, the driver seeks to increase the force on the gear lever'further<br>
so that the gear lever force'is equal to or greater than the second limit value, the<br>
regulator part 5 is actuated in order to obtain a down regulation of the pressure of<br>
the fluid that is passed into the servomechanism 2. In this case, the regulator piston<br>
5 is pressed even further down, and the regulator piston valve seat 19 is pressed<br>
downwards in that the spring 19a is compressed. The fluid that is passed into the<br>
servo valve/measuring unit 4' through duct 23 will then be vented to the exhaust<br>
port 20. A balance between the pressure on the upper side of the regulator piston<br>
15, the force the driver exerts on the gear lever mechanism that is transferred by the<br>
actuating pin 12 and the counted force from the spring to the regulator piston<br>
ensures that the unit pin 31, the regulator piston 15, the regulator piston 15' spring,<br>
the regulator piston valve seat 19 and the associated spring 19 together work as a<br>
pressure regulator and regulate down the supply pressure that is to be delivered to<br>
the servo valve/measuring unit 4'. The drawing off of fluid via the exhaust port 20,<br>
and the subsequent reduced pressure in fluid that is then passed to the<br>
servomechanism 2 through the outlet 21a, 21b, will result in the total force acting<br>
on the gear shifting mechanism being held constant or reduced.<br><br>
The pressure regulation of the fluid that is delivered to the measuring unit/servo<br>
valve and thence to the servomechanism 2 is so adapted that when the force that the<br>
driver exerts on the gear mechanism in excess of an initial dead band increases, the<br>
pressure of the fluid into the servo valve will drop proportionally. This means that<br>
the greater the force with which the driver changes gear, the smaller the servo boost<br>
the servo valve contributes, when the gear lever force is above the second limit value. This will continue until the servo unit is no longer capable of providing<br>
power assistance. In this way, the total force acting on the gear shifting mechanism<br>
from the servomechanism 2 and the gear lever force will be prevented from<br>
exceeding a predetermined maximum value.<br>
It is of course possible to use means other than springs to provide the preloading of<br>
the various pistons that are used in the reducer 1 and 1a.<br><br>
