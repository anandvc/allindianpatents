Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of compounds which are therapeutically active in the central nervous system.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Many diseases of the central nervous system are influenced by the adrenergic, the dopaminergic, and the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. For example, serotonin has been implicated in a number of diseases and conditions which originate in the central nervous system. A number of pharmacological and genetic experiments involving receptors for serotonin strongly implicate the 5-HT2c receptor subtype in the regulation of food intake (Obes. Res. 1995, 3, Suppl. 4,449S-462S). The 5-HT2c receptor subtype is transcribed and expressed in hypothalamic structures associated with appetite regulation. It has been demonstrated that the non-specific 5-HT2c receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), which has some preference for the 5-HT2c receptor, causes weight loss in mice that express the normal 5-HT2c receptor while the compound lacks activity in mice expressing the mutated inactive form of the 5-HT2c receptor (Nature 1995. 374, 542-546). In a recent clinical study, a slight but sustained reduction in body weight was obtained after 2 weeks of treatment with mCPP in obese subjects (Psychopharmacology 1997. 133, 309-312). Weight reduction has also been reported from clinical studies with other "serotonergic" agents (see e.g. EDrugs 1998,1,456-470). For example, the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine and the 5-HT releasing agent/reuptake inhibitor dexfenfluramine have exhibited weight reduction in controlled studies. However, currently available drugs that increase serotonergic transmission appear to have only a moderate and, in some cases, transient effects on the body weight.<br><br>
,	The 5-HT2c receptor subtype has also been suggested ,c be involved in CNS<br>
borders such as depression and anxiety (Exp. Opin. Invest. D™es 1998 7  ,587 ,500.<br>
IDrugs,1999,2, 109-120).	'	'<br>
The 5-HT2c receptor subtype has further been suggested ,0 be involved in urinary disorders such as urinary incontinence (Drugs, 1999, 2, 109-120).<br>
Compounds which have a selective effect „' the 5-HT2c receptor may therefore have a therapeutic potential in the treatment or prophylaxis of disorders like those mentioned above. Of course, selectivity also reduces the potential for adverse effects mediated by other serotonin receptors.<br>
Examples of such compounds are W-l-(3-{2-[(2-eth0xy-3-Pyridinyl)oxy]ethoxy}-2-pyTazmvI)-2-methyIpiperazine,W-methyl-l-{3-[2-(3-Pyn-dinyloxy]ethoxy]-2-pyra2inyl}piperazine and pharmaceutical acceptable acid salts thereof. WO 00/76984 (hereinafter called Dl) relates to a process for the preparation of such compounds on a small scale such as a gram scale. jA problem to be solved by the present invention was to prepare such compounds on a large scale such as on a kilogram scale. The following factors are more important for preparation on a large scale, in comparison to preparation on a small scale:<br>
-	to obtain a high yield of the desired products for economy reasons,<br>
-	that the processes for PreParation are safe with regard to explosion,<br>
-	that the reagents and solvents used are relatively non-toxic,<br>
-	that the Products obtained are relatively stable, and<br>
-	that the reaction times are relatively short.<br>
These Problems have been solved by the Present invention] It has been shown that the yields of the desired Products according to the present invention are higher than the yields according    ' to Dl. In the experimental part, the yields according to the present invention and Dl are compared. Regarding the choice of solvents for the process steps, dioxane, as used according to Dl, has been replaced by solvents such as MtBE and THF (see step (ii) below) which are less prone to form peroxides and which are less carcinogenic than dioxane. Furthermore, it has been shown that W-methyl-l-{3-[2-(3-pyridinyloxy)ethoxy]-2-Pyra2inyl}Pipera2ine, L-malate salt prepared according to the present invention (see Example 3A) has superior properties compared to W-methyl-l-IS--P-pyridinyloxethoxyJ-pyrazinyDpiperazine, hydrochloride prepared according to Dl in that the former has a higher crystallinity, is less hygroscopic and has a higher chemical stability than the latter. Regarding chemical stability, Dl discloses the preparation of W-l
 <br>
also been prepared in Example 8 below. This compound is not stable for storage as a free base. As (T/?;-l-(3-chloro-2-pyrazinyl)-2-methylpiperazine is a key intermediate, chemical stability during long term storage is important with regard to process economy. It has now been found that the corresponding hydrochloride salt thereof is considerably more stable, which has been prepared in Example 9 below.<br>
The method to prepare Example 3C is a good way of increasing the purity of Example 2C. It has been shown that Example 2C with a purity of 60-70% gives Example 3C with a purity of 99% in one crystallization step. By contrast, the same purity increasing effect has not been achieved by making the acetate of Example 2C.<br>
Regarding reaction time, the reaction according to Example 2A below was complete at room temperature in 15 minutes. The same compound has been prepared in Example 173 in Dl. The procedure of Example 172, step 3 has been followed, wherein the reaction was stirred at S5°C for 15 h. Furthermore, the reaction according to Example 2B below was complete in 35 minutes at 55°C. The same compound has been prepared in Example 200 in Dl. The procedure of Example 192, step 3 has been followed, wherein the reaction was stirred at 90°C for 2 h.<br>

EXAMPLE IB - Preparation of 2-f(2-ethoxv-3-pvridinyl)oxv]ethanol<br>
To water (30.0 kg) was added 3.40 kg of NaOH. The resulting suspension was stirred until complete dissolution had occurred. The temperature of the solution was then adjusted to approx. 60°C. To the alkaline solution was carefully added 2-ethoxy-3-hydroxypyridine, HCl (6.00 kg). The temperature was raised to 85.0°C and the mixture stirred for 30 min to allow for complete dissolution. During 85 min, 2-chloroethanol (4.10 kg) was added, while the temperature was kept between 88.0-92.0°C. The reaction was allowed to age for 50 min at approx. 90°C, after which time HPLC indicated complete conversion of 2-ethoxy-3-hydroxypyridine, HCl to the title compound. The reaction mixture was poured into 65.1 kg of methyl tert-butylether (MtBE). The reaction vessel was rinsed with water (2.0 kg). To the resulting two-phase system was added 3.05 kg of NaCl and 0.20 kg of NaOH. The resulting<br><br>
mixture was stirred for 55 min, while the temperature was lowered to 24.9°C. The mixture was the allowed to stir for another 20 min at 23.7-24.9°C. The water phase was removed. The remaining organic phase was concentrated by distillation at atmospheric pressure. When 45L had been removed, the residue was cooled to room temperature and transferred to a drum. The residue weighed 33.1 kg. According to HPLC, the assay is 118.9 g of the title compound per kg of mixture, corresponding to a yield of 6.25 kg (quantitative yield) of pure title compound. The yield of the title compound according to Dl, starting from 2-bromo-3-(2-{[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy}ethoxy)pyridine and sodium ethoxide in ethanol was 41%.<br>
EXAMPLE 1C - Preparation of 2-(f2-f2-dimethylaminoethoxv)-3-pvridinylloxv}ethanol<br>
DMSO (17L) and potassium carbonate (8.2kg) were charged to the lOOL-glasslined reactor. The mixture was heated to 5S°C while stirring. 2-(2-Dimethylaminoethoxy)pyridin-3-ol (4.11kg) was charged to the reactor during 25 minutes (gas evolution). The mixture was heated to 117°C before the prepared ethylene carbonate solution was added through the manhood in portions. After 1L ethylene carbonate solution was added IP-HPLC was taken to ensure that the title compound had started to form. The total addition of ethylene carbonate solution was made during lh 35 minutes. Temperature after the addition was 124°C. A HPLC sample was taken from the reaction mixture 10 minutes after finished addition. It showed 95% conversion to product. The reaction-mixture was allowed to cool to 70°C before water (45L) and sodium chloride (4.06kg) was charged to the reactor. The mixture was then stirred for 20 minutes at 70°C before cooled to RT. Ethyl acetate (137L) was charged into a 328L glass-lined reactor. The water mixture was transferred from the 100L reactor to the 328L reactor. The mixture was stirred for 25 minutes before the mechanical stirrer was turned off. After allowing the phases to separate for 40 minutes, the water-phase (65L) was discharged. The mixture was heated to reflux and 102L of ethyl acetate was distilled off. Toluene (72L) was added and the mixture was heated to reflux again and 61L of toluene/ethyl acetate was distilled off. The reaction mixture was then cooled to RT. The title compound was never isolated; it was directly used in Example 2C.<br>

EXAMPLE 9 - Preparation of 2/?)-l-(3-chloro-2-pvrazinvn-2-methvlpiperazine, hydrochloride<br>
To a 200 L reactor was added the product from Example 8 in toluene solution (ca 25 kg thereof in 93 kg solution) with an EtOAc rinse (10 kg). Solvent was removed using vacuum until a volume of 35 L was reached. To remove most of the toluene, EtOAc (2 x 90 kg) was added to the 200 L reactor and distilled until a volume of 35 L was reached. EtOAc (90 kg) was added to the 200 L reactor and heated to reflux (78°C). The slurry in the 200 L reactor was cooled to 55°C to 60°C, filtered through a bag filter to remove solid impurities sending the filtrate to the 200 L receiver. The 200 L reactor was rinsed with EtOAc (5 kg) sending the rinse into the 200 L receiver. The solution in the 200 L receiver was transferred to the 400 L reactor with an EtOAc rinse (5 kg). 37% HC1 (9.0 kg) was added to the 200 L receiver and rinsed with EtOAc (9 kg). The 37% HC1 solution was transferred to the 200 L<br><br>
reactor while maintaining a temperature of73°C to 80°C in the 200 L reactor. The solution in the 200 L reactor was maintained at 72°C for 10 min. The solution was cooled to -25°C to -30°C for 2h 45 min. The resulting slurry in the 200 L reactor was filtered onto an 18" Nutsche filter sending the filtrate into the 200 L receiver. The reactor and nutsche were nnsed with -25°C EtOAc (3 x 45 kg) sending the filtrate into drums. The filter cake was dned to afford 24.5 kg (79%) of the title compound of 98.4% GC punty. A 2nd similar run gave 23.1 kg for a total of 47.6 kg (77%).<br>

Example 11 - Comparison of the properties of different salts of Example 2 A<br>
The following salts were prepared by Chemical development, Stockholm and Kalamazoo and evaluated by Pharmaceutical Development, Nerviano:<br>
-	(7/?/j-methyl-l-{3-[2-(3-pyridinyloxy)ethoxy]-2-pyrazinyl}piperazine (free base; see<br>
Example 2 A)<br>

-	(2R)-methy\-1 -{3-[2-(3-pyridinyloxy)ethoxy]-2-pyrazinyl}piperazine, hydrochloride (see<br>
Dl, Example 173)<br>
-	-methyl-l-{3-[2-(3-pyridinyloxy)ethoxy]-2-pyrazinyl}piperazine, acetate<br>
-	2i?&gt;methyl-l-{3-[2-(3-pyridinyloxy)ethoxy]-2-pyrazinyl}piperazine, benzoate<br>
-	f2/t&gt;-methyl-l-{3-[2-(3-pyridinyloxy)ethoxy]-2-pyrazinyl}piperazine, cinnamate.<br>
[fif-ntification (NMR and elementary analysis)<br>
Positive data for most salts, except for the free-base and the hydrochloride. NMR analysis was positive for the free-base. The hydrochloride showed problems related to the stoichiometric ratio.<br><br>
- Crvstallinitv (x-rays)<br>
Positive results for free base, acetate, benzoate, L-malate, and cinnamate were obtained. Most samples were substantially crystalline. Hydrochloride and especially fumarate came out to be of lower crystallinity.<br>
Hygroscopicitv (DVS, storage at RT/different RHs and at 40oO"75%RH)<br>
Positive results were obtained on benzoate, L-malate, and cinnamate. They showed lower hygroscopicity (
Solubility (Water. DH 1.2 and pH 7.4 buffers)<br>
Positive results were obtained for all salts (= 300 mg/ml FBE) with the exception of cinnamate whose solubility in water is about 8-10 mg/ml FBE.<br>
Intrinsic Dissolution Rate (pH 1.2)<br>
All results confirmed the solubility data. IDRs were about 10"1 mgsec'cm"2 while cinnamate had much lower dissolution rate (10'3 that means -2 order of magnitude lower than the others). Acetate salt showed problem during tablet preparation (sticking to the punch).<br>
Chemical stability (2 weeks at 65°C)<br>
Positive data for benzoate, L-malate, and cinnamate were obtained. Fumarate and acetate seemed to be the less stable salts either at RT/90% RH and at high temperature. Formation of the reaction product with fumaric acid was also observed. These samples showed unchanged DSC patterns except for the acetate (peak broadening).<br>
Polymorphism<br>
The tested conditions (RT evaporation, cooling crystallization at -20°C in different solvent or mixtures) did not show other polymorphs of benzoate and L-malate salts.<br><br>
Manufacturing method<br>
Benzoate, L-malate, and cinnamate seemed to be easier to crystallize than fumarate, hydrochloride and free base.<br>
Toxicological acceptability<br>
There are few marketed drugs that are cinnamate salts and no much information in literature. Oral LD50S in rats are about 2500 mg/kg and 5 g/kg in mice.<br>
Malic acid is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle and occurs naturally in apple and many fruits. It is FDA approved as food additive. A lot of drugs are approved in Europe and US as malate salts.<br>
In summary, of the salts examined above, (2R)-methy\-l- {3-[2-(3-pyridinyloxy)ethoxy]-2-pyrazinyl}piperazine, L-malate seems to be the best choice of the salts examined due to its high crystallinity, low hygroscopicity, high chemical stability and low toxicity.<br>
Example 12 - Comparison of the properties of different salts of Example 2B The following salts have been prepared:<br>
(2R)-\-(3-{2-[(2-ethoxy-3-pyridinyl)oxy]ethoxy}-2-pyrazinyl)-2-methylpiperazine (free<br>
base, see Example 2B)<br>

-	(2R)-\ -(3- {2-[(2-ethoxy-3-pyridinyl)oxy]ethoxy} -2-pyrazinyl)-2-methylpiperazine, succinate (see Example 3B).<br>
Crystallinity (powder x-ray diffraction)<br>
For the succinate salt, the degree of crystallinity was very high. The degree of crystallinity decreased in the order succinate&gt;acetate&gt;fumarate.<br>
Thermal properties<br>
For the free base and the acetate salt the melting temperature onset was low (81°C and 96°C, respectively). These low melting points can be drawbacks in future developmem work.<br><br>
For the succinate and fumarate salts the thermal properties were fair since the extrapolated melting temperature onset was 123°C and 149°C, respectively.<br>
Hygroscopicity<br>
All but the acetate salt had acceptable properties with repect to hygroscopicity. The acetate salt was very hygroscopic and showed a pronounced hysteresis at high values of relative humidity.<br>
Solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate<br>
The solubility of the succinate salt, in all investigate media, was at least 250 mg/ml. For the fumarate salt the solubility was &gt;93 mg/ml in 0.9 % w/w NaCl and &gt;68 mg/ml in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. Hence, the solubility of succinate was in all instances higher than the fumarate salt.<br>
The intrinsic dissolution rate studies indicated the dissolution rate to increase according to the order base<fumarate></fumarate>
In conclusion, with the respect to the solubility and the intrinsic dissolution rate, the succinate salt proved to have the most favourable qualities of the salts and the free base studied.<br>
Impurities<br>
Analysis (LC-UV-MS) of the fumarate salt revealed the presence of a fumarate adduct (-1%) and the formation of dimers of the free base (0.2%). The fumarate adduct may be a Michael adduct between the piperazine ring and fumaric acid.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The succinate salt hade the overall best state properties, good crystallinity, a relatively high melting point, a high solubility and a high intrinsic dissolution rate. The acetate salt proved to be both hygroscopic and to have a low melting range. The solubility, intrinsic dissolution rate and the degree of crystallinity of the fumarate salt was inferior to that of the succinate salt. In view of the properties of the different salts investigated the best candidate for further development is the succinate salt.<br>

Crvstallinitv (powder x-ray diffraction)<br>
The acetate- and the oxalate salt had a high degree of crystallinity whilst the crystallinity of the succinate salt and the phosphoric acid salt ranged from predominantly crystalline to moderately crystallinity. The D-tartrate salt had a low degree of crystallinity. Two salts, edeteate and citrate proved to be practically amorphous. The free base is a viscous oil at ambient conditions. The benzenetricarboxylate, naphthalenedisulfonate and terephtalate were predominantly crystalline, whilst the galactareate was partially amorphous.<br><br><br>
The acetate, citrate, edeteate, succinate and D-tartrate salts proved to be very hygroscopic and deliquescent. Also the free base was hygroscopic. The hygroscopicity of the the oxalate and phosphoric acid salt was low. The hygroscopicity of the benzenetricarboxylate, naphthalenedisulfonate and terephthalate was low, moderate and hight (deliquescent), respectively.<br>
Solubility<br>
The solubility of the phosphoric acid salt was, in all investigated media, not less than<br>
590 mg/ml. Preliminary studies indicated the benzenetricarboxylic acid to have a solubility of &gt;19 mg/ml in SGF (simulated gastric fluid without enzymes; pH of filtrate 2.9), 11 mg/ml in SIF (simulated intestinal fluid without enzymes; pH of filtrate 4.2) and in purified water «4 mg/ml (pH of filtrate 3.6). The solubility of the naphthalenedisulfonate was high &gt;540 mg/ml. Preliminary studies of the solubility of the terephthalate salt in purified water indicated the solubility to be low (
Toxicological acceptability<br>
Regarding the oxalate salt although its solid state properties are good it was deemed inappropriate due to toxicological reasons. The benzenetricarboxylate salt had the overall most promising solid state properties but the solubility was lower than for the phosphoric acid salt and requires a toxicological evaluation. The phosphoric acid salt was deemed to be the best choice of the salts regarding high crystallinity, low hygroscopicity, high solubility, and low toxicity.<br><br><br>
