Intermediate Production Example 11 Production of intermediate compound 138)<br>
First, 0.56 g of 2,6-dichlorO-4-benzoyloxyphenol (which can be produced according to the method as described in JP-A 8-337549/1996), 0.30 g of potassium carbonate, 0.74 g of 5-(methanesulfonyloxy)pentyloxy-acetone 0-tert-butyloxime, and 10 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide are placed in a reaction vessel. After stirring at room temperature for 24 hours, the reaction mixture is poured into diluted hydrochloric acid, and extracted twice with diethyl ether. The diethyl ether layers are combined, washed with water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to give a crude product. This crude product is subjected to silica gel chromatography, which affords 5-(2,6-dichloro-4-(benzoyloxy)phenoxy)pentyloxyacetone 0-tert-butyloxime.<br>
To a solution of 0.99 g of 5-(2,6-dichloro-4-(benzoyloxy)phenoxy)-pentyloxyacetone 0-tert-butyloxime dissolved in 7.5 ml of methanol is added a solution of 0.15 g of potassium hydroxide dissolved in 1.5 ml of water. After stirring at room temperature for 1 hour, the reaction mixture is acidified by the addition of diluted hydrochloric acid, and concentrated. Water is added to the residue, and the mixture is extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layers are combined, washed with water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to give a crude product. This crude product is subjected to silica gel chromatography, which affords 5-(2,6-di-chloro-4-hydroxyphenoxy)pentyloxyacetone 0-tert-butyloxime.<br>
