DESCRIPTION<br>
CARBOSTYRIL DERIVATIVES AND SEROTONIN REUPTAKE<br>
INHIBITORS FOR TREATMENT OF MOOD DISORDERS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention provides pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising carbostyril derivatives that<br>
act as dopamine-serotonin system stabilizers in<br>
combination with serotonin reuptake inhibitors in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Further, the<br>
present invention provides methods of using the<br>
compositions of the present invention to treat mood<br>
disorders such as depression and major depressive<br>
disorder.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The number of people with mood disorders such<br>
as major depressive disorder, and exhibiting various<br>
symptoms of depressions is increasing every year for<br>
numerous reasons such as social stress, unemployment,<br>
disease, and poverty. Depression is a major social<br>
problem throughout the world. For example, in Japan<br>
the occurrence rate of depression in the generation<br>
older than 65 years is 5% or more, including major<br>
depressive disorder. Some of the depression in this<br>
population is associated with mental disturbances<br>
representing senile diseases associated with dementia<br><br>
2<br>
and neurosis. Many depressed patients show high<br>
recurrence rate, and severe depressive symptoms are<br>
major causes of suicide and drug abuse (Nishimura Ken,<br>
"NIPPON RONEN IGAKUZASSHI", Vol. 33, pp 503-504<br>
(1996)).<br>
Since the period of 1950, tricyclic<br>
antidepressant drugs (e.g., imipramine, desipramine,<br>
amitriptyline, etc.) have been developed that act to<br>
inhibit monoamine reuptake. They are frequently used<br>
for treating patients suffering from mood disorders,<br>
such as depression and major depressive disorder.<br>
However, these drugs have side-effects such as the<br>
following: dry mouth, hazy eyes, dysuria, constipation,<br>
recognition disturbance and the like due to<br>
anticholinergic activity; cardiovascular side-effects<br>
such as, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia and the<br>
like on the basis of 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist<br>
activity; side-effects such as, sedation, increase in<br>
the body weight and the like on the basis of histamine-<br>
H1 receptor antagonist activity.<br>
Since 1980, serotonin reuptake inhibitors<br>
have been developed, including but not limited to<br>
fluoxetine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, milnacipran,<br>
citalopram, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and<br>
sertraline, and these inhibitors have side-effects such<br>
as recognition disturbance, sleep disturbance, and<br>
excerbation of anxiety and agitation. Additionally,<br>
these inhibitors also have other side effects in the<br><br>
3<br>
digestive organs, such as nausea, vomiting and the<br>
like.<br>
For the reason that the mood disorders such<br>
as depressive symptoms, depression and the like are<br>
diseases with severely strong psychalgalia, the<br>
manifestation of new symptoms on the basis of these<br>
side-effects are quite serious problems in the therapy<br>
of mood disorders (Shioe Kunihiko, Kariya Tetsuhiko,<br>
"SHINKEI SEISHIN YAKURI", Vol. 11, pp 37-48 (1989);<br>
Yamada Mitsuhiko, Ueshima Kunitoshi, "RINSHOU SEISHIN<br>
YAKURI", Vol. 1, pp 355-363 (1998)).<br>
Although the mood disorders including<br>
depression and major depressive disorder are<br>
heterogeneous diseases, and the causes of these<br>
diseases are not been fully understood, it is likely<br>
that the abnormalities of monoaminergic central nervous<br>
system caused by serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine<br>
and the like, and the abnormality of various hormones<br>
and peptides as well as various stressors are causes of<br>
depression and various mood disorders (Kubota Masaharu<br>
et al., "RINSHOU SEISHIN IGAKU", Vol. 29, pp 891-899<br>
(2000)). For these reasons, even though antidepressant<br>
drugs, such as tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitors were used, these drugs are not<br>
always effective in treating all depressed patients.<br>
About 30% of the depressed patients do not respond to<br>
the primarily selected antidepressants (Nelson, J. C,<br>
et al., J. Clin. Psychiatry, 55, pp 12-19 (1994)).<br><br>
4<br>
Further, when a second or third antidepressant is<br>
administered to these patients, insufficient;<br>
improvements of the symptoms occurs in about 10% of<br>
these patients (Inoeu Takeshi, Koyama Tsukasa, "RINSHOU<br>
SEISHIN IGAKU", Vol. 38, pp 868-870 (1996)). These<br>
patients are called as refractory depression patients.<br>
In some cases, electric shock therapy is used<br>
to treat refractory depression, and the efficacy of<br>
this treatment has been reported. However, in fact,<br>
the condition of numerous patients is not improved<br>
(Inoue Takeshi, Koyama Tsukasa, "RINSHOU SEISHIN<br>
YAKURI", Vol. 2, pp 979-984 (1999)). Additionally,<br>
psychological anguish experienced by these patients and<br>
their families concerning the use of the electric shock<br>
therapy can be severe.<br>
New therapeutic trials involve proposed<br>
combined therapies using an atypical antipsychotic<br>
drug, such as olanzapine, which is an agent for<br>
treating for schizophrenia (antipsychotic drug),<br>
together with an antidepressant drug such as serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitor (EP 0 367 141, WO 98/11897,<br>
WO99/61027, WO99/62522, U.S. 2002/0123490A1 and the<br>
like). However, commercially available atypical anti-<br>
psychotic drugs have significant problems relating to<br>
their safety. For example, clozapine, olanzapine and<br>
quetiapine increase body weight and enhance the risk of<br>
diabetes mellitus (Newcomer, J. W. (Supervised<br>
Translated by Aoba Anri), "RINSHOU SEISHIN YAKURI",<br><br>
5<br>
Vol. 5, pp 911-925 (2002); Haupt, D. W. and Newcomer,<br>
J. W (Translated by Fuji Yasuo and Misawa Fuminari),<br>
"RINSHOU SEISHIN YAKURI", Vol. 5, pp 1063-1082 (2002)).<br>
In fact, urgent safety alerts have been issued in Japan<br>
relating to hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis and<br>
diabetic coma caused by olanzapine and guetiapine,<br>
indicating that these drugs were subjected to dosage<br>
contraindication to the patients with diabetes mellitus<br>
and patients having anamnesis of diabetes mellitus.<br>
Risperidone causes increases serum prolactin levels and<br>
produces extrapyramidal side effects at high dosages.<br>
Ziprasidone enhances the risk of severe arrhythmia on<br>
the basis of cardio-QTc prolongation action. Further,<br>
clozapine induces agranulocytosis, so that clinical use<br>
thereof is strictly restricted (van Kammen, D. P.<br>
(Compiled under Supervision by Murasaki Mitsuroh),<br>
"RINSHOU SEISHIN YAKURI", Vol. 4, pp 483-492 (2001)).<br>
Accordingly what is needed are new<br>
compositions useful for treating mood disorders,<br>
particularly, depression and major depressive disorder,<br>
which are efficacious and do not cause the deleterious<br>
side effects associated with prior art compounds.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention solves the problem<br>
described above by providing novel compositions and<br>
methods of using these compositions for treating mood<br>
disorders, particularly depression and major depressive<br><br>
6<br>
disorder.<br>
The present invention provides solutions to<br>
the above-mentioned problems, and demonstrates that the<br>
mood disorders such as depression, major depressive and<br>
the like can be treated effectively by administering to<br>
a patient with such disorder a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising at least one carbostyril<br>
derivative that is a dopamine-serotonin system<br>
stabilizer in combination with at least one serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitor in a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier.<br>
A preferred carbostyril derivative of the<br>
present invention that is a dopamine-serotonin system<br>
stabilizer is aripiprazole or a metabolite thereof.<br>
Another preferred carbostyril derivative of the present<br>
invention that is a dopamine-serotonin system<br>
stabilizer is a metabolite of aripiprazole called<br>
dehydroaripiprazole, also known as OPC-14857. Other<br>
such metabolites of aripiprazole included within the<br>
present invention are shown in Figure 8. Preferred<br>
metabolites are shown in Figure 8 indicated by the<br>
following designations: OPC-14857, DM-1458, DM-1451,<br>
DM-1452, DM-1454 and DCPP.<br>
Aripiprazole, also called 7-{4-[4-(2,3-<br>
dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butoxy}-3,4-dihydro-<br>
2(1H)-quinolinone, is a carbostyril compound and is<br>
useful for treating schizophrenia (EP 0 367 141, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,006,528) . Aripiprazole is also known as<br><br>

7-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butoxy}-3 , 4 -<br>
dihydrocarbostyril, Abilify, OPC-14597, OPC-31 and BMS-<br>
337039. Aripiprazole possesses 5-HT1A receptor agonist<br>
activity, and is known as useful compound for treating<br>
types of depression and refractory depressions, such as<br>
endogeneous depression, major depression, melancholia<br>
and the like (WO 02/060423, U. S. Patent Application<br>
2002/0173513A1). Aripiprazole has activity as an<br>
agonist at the serotonin receptors and dopamine<br>
receptors, and acts as an agonist or partial agonist at<br>
the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and as an agonist or<br>
partial agonist at the dopamine D2 receptor.<br>
Aripiprazole is a dopamine-serotonin system stabilizer.<br>

fo.rmed by N-dealkyiation of DM-1451 and DM-14 59.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present<br><br>
16<br>
invention comprises a first ingredient comprising a<br>
carbostyril derivative active as a dopamine-serotonin<br>
system stabilizer and a second ingredient comprising a<br>
serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions of<br>
the present invention are useful in treating mood<br>
disorders, including depression and major depressive<br>
disorder.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition: the first ingredient<br>
The first ingredient comprises a carbostyril<br>
derivative active as a dopamine-serotonin system<br>
stabilizer. Such carbostyril derivative has activity<br>
as an agonist or partial agonist at some serotonin<br>
receptors and some dopamine receptors, preferably as an<br>
agonist or partial agonist at the serotonin 5-HT1A<br>
receptor and as an agonist or partial agonist at the<br>
dopamine D2 receptor. Carbostyril derivatives are<br>
described in U.S. Patent 5,006,528 and U.S. published<br>
patent application 2002/0173513A1. In one embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the carbostyril derivatives<br>
represented by the following formula (1) are used:<br><br><br>
17<br>
wherein the carbon-carbon bend between 3- and 4-<br>
positions in the carbostyril skeleton is a single or a<br>
double bond.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, this activity of<br>
the carbostyril derivative is as an agonist or partial<br>
agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor and an agonist or<br>
partial agonist at the dopamine D, receptor subtype. In<br>
another preferred embodiment, the carbostyril<br>
derivative to be used as a first component in the<br>
present invention is aripiprazole, or a metabolic<br>
derivative thereof. Metabolic derivatives of<br>
aripiprazole include but are not limited to<br>
dehydroaripiprazole, also called OPC-14857. Other<br>
metabolic derivatives of aripiprazole include but are<br>
not limited to the chemical structures shown in Figure<br>
8 as OPC-14857, DM-1458, DM-1451, DM-1452, DM-1454 and<br>
DCPP. All of the aforementioned carbostyril<br>
derivatives may be .used as a first component in the<br>
practice of the present invention.<br>
Aripiprazole, also called 7-{4-[4-(2,3-<br>
dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butoxy}-3, 4-dihydro-<br>
2(1H)-quinolinone, is a carbostyril compound useful as<br>
the effective ingredient for treating schizophrenia<br>
(JP-A-2-191256, U S. Patent 5,006,528). Aripiprazole<br>
is also known as 7-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-<br>
piperazinyl]butoxy]-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril, Abilify,<br>
OPC-14597, OPC-31 and BMS-337039. Aripiprazole<br>
possesses 5-HT1A receptor agonist activity, and is<br><br>
18<br>
known as a useful compound for treating types of<br>
depression and refractory depression, such as<br>
endogenous depression, major depression, melancholia<br>
and the like (WO 02/060423A2; Jordan et al. U.S. Patent<br>
Application 2002/0173513A1). Aripiprazole has activity<br>
as an agonist at serotonin receptors and dopamine1<br>
receptors, and acts as an agonist or partial agonist at<br>
the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and as an agonist or<br>
partial agonist at the dopamine D2 receptor.<br>
Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic drug having<br>
new mechanism of action which is different from that of<br>
other atypical antipsychotic drugs (Grunder, G. et al.,<br>
Arch Gen Psychiatry, 60(10), pp 974-977, 2003). The<br>
available typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs act<br>
as antagonists at the dopamine-D2 receptors. In<br>
contrast, aripiprazole acts as a partial agonist at the<br>
dopamine D2 receptor (By Ishigooka Jyunya and Inada Ken,<br>
RINSHO SEISHIN YAKURI, Vol. 4, pp 1653-1664 (2001);<br>
Burris, K. D. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 302, pp<br>
381-389 (2002)). In addition to the partial agonist<br>
action at dopamine-D2 receptors, aripiprazole has<br>
activity as a partial agonist at the serotonin 5-HT1A<br>
receptors, as well as antagonist action at serotonin 5-<br>
HT2A receptors. Accordingly, aripiprazole is a drug<br>
belonging to new category defined as a dopamine-<br>
serotonin system stabilizer (dopamine-serotonin<br>
stabilizer (Burris, K. D. et al., J. Pharmacol, Exp.<br>
Ther., 302, pp 381-389, 2002; Jordan, S. et al., Eur.<br><br>

milling methods can be used to mill conventional<br>
aripiprazole hydrate. For example, conventional<br>
aripiprazole hydrate can be milled in a milling<br>
machine. A widely used milling machine such as an<br>
atomizer, pin mill, jet mill or ball mill can be used.<br>
Among of these, the atomizer is preferably used.<br><br>

Regarding the specific milling conditions<br>
when using an atomizer, a rotational speed of 5000-<br>
15000 rpm could be used for the main axis, for example,<br>
with a feed rotation of 10-30 rpm and a screen hole<br>
size of 1-5 mm.<br>
The mean particle size of the aripiprazole<br>
hydrate A obtained by milling may be normally 50 urn or<br>

Method for preparingy Aripiprazole /Anhydride/ Crystals B<br>
The aripiprazole anhydride crystals B of the<br>
present invention are prepared for example by heating<br>
the aforementioned aripiprazole hydrate A at 90-125°C.<br>
The heating time is generally about 3-50 hours, but<br>
cannot be stated unconditionally, because it differs<br>
depending on heating temperature. The heating time and<br>
heating temperature are inversely related, so that for<br>
example when the heating time is longer, then the<br>
heating temperature is lower, and when the heating<br>
temperature is higher then the heating time is shorter.<br><br>
WO 2004/060374	.	PCT/JP2003/016724<br>
73<br>
Specifically, if the heating temperature of<br>
aripiprazole hydrate A is 100°C, the heating time may<br>
be 18 hours or more, or preferably about 24 hours. If<br>
the heating temperature of aripiprazole hydrate A is<br>
120°C, on the other hand, the heating time may be about<br>
3 hours. The Aripiprazole anhydride Vrystals B of the<br>
present invention can be prepared with certainty by<br>
heating aripiprazole hydrate A for about 18 hours at<br>
100°C, and then heating it for about 3 hours at 120°C.<br>
Thee aripiprazole anhydride crystals B of the present<br>
invention can also be obtained if the heating time is<br>
extended still further, but this method may not be<br>
economical.<br>
When small particle size is not required for<br>
the formulation, e.g., when drug substance is being<br>
prepared for injectable or oral solution formulations,<br>
aripiprazole anhydride crystals B can be also obtained<br>
by the following process.<br>
Aripiprazole anhydride crystals B of the<br>
present invention are prepared for example by heating<br>
conventxohal aripiprazole anhydride crystals at 90-<br>
125°C. The heating time is generally about 3-50 hours,<br>
but cannot be stated unconditionally because it differs<br>
depending on heating temperature. The heating time and<br>
heating temperature are inversely related, so that for<br>
example if the heating time is longer, the heating<br>
temperature is lower, and if the heating time is<br>
shorter, the heating temperature is higher.<br><br>
WO 2004/060374		PCT/JP2003/016724<br>
24<br>
Specifically, if the heating temperature of the<br>
'aripiprazole anhydride crystals is 100°C, the heating<br>
time may be about 4 hours, and if the heating<br>
temperature is 120°C the heating time may be about 3<br>
hours.<br>
Furthermore aripiprazole anhydride crystals<br>
B of the present invention are prepared for example, by<br>
heating conventional aripiprazole hydrate at 90-125° C.<br>
The heating time is generally about 3-50 hours, but<br>
cannot be stated unconditionally because it differs<br>
depending on heating temperature. The heating time and<br>
heating temperature are inversely related, so that for<br>
example, if the heating time is longer, the heating<br>
temperature is lower, and if the heating time is<br>

Specifically, if the heating temperature of the<br>
aripiprazole hydrate is 100°C, the heating time may be<br>
about 24 hours, and if the heating temperature is 120°C<br>
the heating time may be about 3 hours.<br>
The aripiprazole anhydride crystals which are<br>
the raw material for preparing the aripiprazole<br>
anhydride crystals B of the present invention are<br>
prepared for example by Method a or b below.<br>
"Method a": Process for preparing crude crystals of<br>
Aripiprazole<br>
Conventional aripiprazole anhydride  crystals<br>
are prepared by well-known methods, as described in<br><br>
WO 2004/060374	PCT/JP2003/016724<br>
25<br>
Example 1 of Japanese ***Unexamined Patent Publication No.<br>
191256/1990.<br>
7-(4-bromobutoxy)-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril, is<br>
reacted with 1-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazine and the<br>
thus obtained crude aripiprazole crystals are<br>
recrystallized from ethanol.<br>
"Method b": Process for preparing conventiona]<br>
Aripiprazole anhydrde <br>
The Method b is described in the Proceedings<br>
of the 4th Joint Japanese-Korean Symposium on<br>
Separation Technology (October 6-8, 1996).<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate which is the raw<br>
material for preparing the aripiprazole anhydrde<br>
crystals B of the present invention is prepared for<br>
example by Method c below.<br>
"Method c": Method for preparing conventional<br>
Aripiprazole Hydrate<br>
Aripiprazole hydrate is easily obtained by<br>
dissolving the aripiprazole anhydrde crystals obtained<br>
by Method a above in a hydrous solvent, and heating and<br>
then cooling the resulting solution. Using this<br>
method, aripiprazole hydrate is precipitated as<br>
crystals in the hydrous solvent.<br>
An organic solvent containing water is<br>
&gt; usually used as the hydrous solvent. The organic<br>
solvent may be preferable one which is miscible with<br><br>
26<br>
water, for example an alcohol such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, propanol or isopropanol, a ketone such as<br>
acetone, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dimethylformamide, or a mixture thereof, ethanol is<br>
particularly desirable. The amount of water in the<br>
hydrous solvent may be 10-25% by volume of the solvent,<br>
or preferably close to 20% by volume.<br>
Aripiprazole can easily form an acid addition<br>
salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. As to<br>
such acid, for example, an inorganic acid, such as<br>
sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, etc.; an organic<br>
acid such as, acetic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric<br>
acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic<br>
acid, succinic acid, etc. can be exemplified. Similar<br>
to aripiprazole of free forms, these acid addition<br>
salts can also be used as the active ingredient<br>
compounds in the present invention.<br>
The objective compound thus obtained through<br>
each one of production steps, is separated from the<br>
reaction system by usual separation means, and can be<br>
further purified. As to the separation and<br>
purification means, for example, distillation method,<br>
solvent extraction method, dilution method,<br>
recrystallization method, column chromatography, ion-<br>
exchange chromatography, gel chromatography, affinity<br>
chromatography, preparative thin-layer chromatography<br><br>
27<br>
and the like can be exemplified.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition: the second ingredient<br>
In the composition of the present invention,<br>
a serotonin reuptake inhibitor is used as the second<br>
ingredient. Compounds which function as serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitors can be widely used as the serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitors and are known to one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art.<br>
Among the serotonin reuptake inhibitors,<br>
those having IC50 value (a concentration of the drug<br>
that inhibits serotonin reuptake by about 50%),<br>
measured by the method of Wong et al.<br>
(Neuropsychopharmacology, 8, pp 337-344 (1993)), the<br>
standard pharmacological assay method, is about 1000 nM<br>
or lower is preferable.<br>
As to such serotonin reuptake inhibitors, for<br>
example, fluvoxamine (5-methoxy-l-[4-(trifluoro-<br>
methyl)phenyl]-1-pentanone-O-(2-aminoethyl)oxime),<br>
fluoxetine (N-methyl-3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-3-<br>
phenylpropylamine), paroxetine (trans-(-)-3-[ (1,3-<br>
benzodioxol-5-yloxy)methyl] -4-(4~fluorophenyl)-<br>
piperidine), sertraline (lS-cis)-4-(3,4-<br>
dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-l-<br>
naphthylylamine hydrochloride), venlafaxine,<br>
miinacipran (N,N-diethyl-2-aminomethyl-l-<br>
phenylcyclopropanecarboxyamide) , citalopram,<br>
escitalopram, duloxetine and the like may be used.<br><br>
23<br>
The serotonin reuptake inhibitor may be<br>
either in the form of a free base or a salt (an acid<br>
addition salt or the like). Further, the serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitor may be either a racemic<br>
modifications or R and S enantiomers.<br>
The serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be<br>
either a single use of one serotonin reuptake<br>
inhibitor, and in case of need, two or more of the<br>
serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be used in combina-<br>
tion. Use of one serotonin reuptake inhibitor is<br>
preferred.<br>
The serotonin reuptake inhibitor can easily<br>
form an acid addition salt with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid. As to such acid, for example, an<br>
inorganic acid, such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid,<br>
etc. ; an organic acid such as, acetic acid, p-toluene-<br>
sulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid,<br>
maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid,<br>
citric acid, benzoic acid, succinic acid, etc. can be<br>
exemplified. Similar to the reuptake inhibitor of free<br>
forms, these acid addition salts can be also used as<br>
the active ingredient compounds in the present<br>
invention.<br>
Among the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, a<br>
compound having acidic group can easily form salt by<br>
reacting with a pharmaceutically acceptable basic<br>
compound. As to such basic compound, a metal<br><br>
29<br>
hydroxide, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and the<br>
like; an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate, for<br>
example sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium<br>
hydrogencabonate, potassium hydrogencarbonate and the<br>
like; a metal alcoholate, for example sodium methylate,<br>
potassium ethylate and the like can be exemplified.<br>
The thus obtained salt form of serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitor is separated from the reaction<br>
system by usual separation means, and can be further<br>
purified. As to the separation and purification means,<br>
for example, distillation method, solvent extraction<br>
method, dilution method, recrystallization method,<br>
column chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, gel<br>
chromatography, affinity chromatography, preparative<br>
thin-layer chromatography and the like can be<br>
exemplified.<br>
Combination of the first ingredient with the second<br>
ingredient<br>
As to combination of carbostyril derivatives<br>
with activity as dopamine-serotonin system stabilizers,<br>
non-limiting examples of aripiprazole and dehydroari-<br>
piprazole are described herein. When aripiprazole is<br>

inhibitor. Metabolites of aripiprazole that may be<br>
used in the present invention include but are not<br>
limited to OPC-14857, DM-1458, DM-1451, DM-1452, DM-<br>
1454 and DCPP as shown in Figure 8. Any one of these<br>
metabolites may be used in the present invention. The<br>
following sentences describe a combination of<br>
dehydroaripiprazole with specific serotonin reuptake<br>
inhibitors, however it is to be understood that any one<br>
of DM-1458, DM-1451, DM-1452, DM-1454 or DCPP, as shown<br>
in Figure 8, could be substituted for<br>
dehydroaripiprazole in these disclosed combinations.<br>
Dehydroaripiprazole (also called OPC-14857 in Figure 8)<br>
is a preferred metabolite of aripiprazole. As to<br>

39<br>
and Formulation Sample Examples  First, analytical<br>
methods are explained.<br>
Analytical Methods<br>
(1)	The 1H-NMR spectrum was measured in DMSO-<br>
d6 by using TMS as the standard.<br>
(2)	Powder X-ray Diffraction<br>
By using RAD-2B diffraction meter<br>
manufactured by Rigaku Denki, the powder x-ray<br>
diffraction pattern was measured at room temperature by<br>
using a Cu Ka filled tube (35 kV 20mA) as the x-ray<br>
source with a wide-angle goniometer, a 1° scattering<br>
slit, an 0.15 mm light-intercepting slit, a graphite<br>
secondary monochromator and a scintillation counter.<br>
Data collection was done in 20-continuous scan mode at a<br>
scan speed of 5°/minute in scan steps of 0.02° in the<br>
range of 3° to 40°.<br>
(3)	The IR spectrum was measured by the KBr<br>
method.<br>
(4)	Thermogravimetric/Differential Thermal<br>
Analysis<br>
Thermogravimetric/differential thermal<br>
analysis was measured by using SSC 5200 control unit<br>
and TG/DTA 220 simultaneous differential thermal/<br>
thermogravimetric measuring unit manufactured by Seiko<br>
Corp. Samples (5 - 10 mq) were placed in open aluminum<br>
pans and heated at from 20°C to 200°C in a dry nitrogen<br>
atmosphere at a heating rate of 5°C/minute. -Alumina<br><br>
40<br>
was used as the standard substance.<br>
(5)	Differential Scanning Calcrirnetry<br>
Thermogravimetric/differential thermal<br>
analysis was measured by using SSC 5200 control unit<br>
and DSC 220C differential scanning calorimeter<br>
manufactured by Seiko Corp. Samples (5 - 10 mg) were<br>
placed in crimped aluminum pans and heated from 20°C to<br>
200°C in a dry nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of<br>
5°C/minute. -Alumina was used as the standard<br>
substance.<br>
(6)	Particle Size Measurement<br>
The particles (0.1 g) to be measured were<br>
suspended in a 20 ml n-hexane solution of 0.5 g soy<br>
lecithin, and particle size was manufactured by using a<br>
size distribution measuring meter (Microtrack HRA,<br>
manufactured by Microtrack Co.).<br>
Reference Example 1<br>
7-(4-Cholorobutoxy)-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril<br>
(19.4 g) and monohydrochloride 16.2 g of l-(2,3-<br>
dichlorophenyl)piperadine 1 hydrochloride were added to<br>
a solution of 8.39 g of potassium carbonate dissolved<br>
in 140 ml of water, and refluxed for 3 hours under<br>
agitation. After the reaction was complete, the<br>
mixture was cooled and the precipitated crystals<br>
collected by filtration. These crystals were dissolved<br>
in 350 ml of ethyl acetate, and about 210 ml of<br>
water/ethyl acetate azeotrope was removed under reflux.<br><br>
WO 2004/060374		PCT/JP2003/016724<br>
41<br>
The remaining solution was cooled, and the precipitated<br>
crystals were collected by filtration. The resulting<br>
crystals were dried at 60°C for 14 hours to obtain 20.4<br>
g (74.2%) of crude product of aripiprazole.<br>
The crude product of aripiprazole (30- g)<br>
obtained above was recrystallized from 4 50 ml of<br>
ethanol according to the methods described in Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 191256/1990, and the<br>
resulting crystals were dried at 80°C for 40 hours to<br>
obtain aripiprazole anhydrde<br>
 crystals. The yield was<br>
29.4 g (98.0%)-<br>
The melting point (mp) of these aripiprazole<br>
anhydrde crystals was 140°C, which is identical to the<br>
melting point of the aripriprazole anhydrde crystals<br>
described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.<br>
191256/1990.<br>
Reference Example 2<br>
The crude product of aripiprazole (6930 g)<br>
obtained in Reference Example 1 was heat dissolved by<br>
heating in 138 liters of hydrous ethanol (water content<br>
20% by volume) according to the method presented at the<br>
4th Joint Japanese-Korean Symposium on Separation<br>
Technology, the solution was gradually (2-3 hours)<br>
cooled to room temperature,, and then was chilled to<br>
near 0°C. The precipitated crystals were collected by-<br>
filtration, about 7200 g of aripiprazole hydrate (wet-<br>
state) .<br><br>
WO 2004/060374	.	PCT/JP2003/016724<br>
- 2<br>
The wet-state aripiprazole hydrate crystals<br>
obtained above were dried at 8 0DC for 30 hours to<br>
obtain 6480 g (93.5%) of aripiprazole anhydrde<br>
crystals. The melting point (rap) of these crystals was<br>
139.5°C.<br>
Further, the crystalline form of these<br>
crystals was colorless flake.<br>
The water content of the crystals were<br>
confirmed by the Karl Fischer method, the moisture<br>
value was 0.03%, thus the crystals were confirmed as<br>
anhydrous product.<br>
Reference Example 3<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate (820 g) in wet state<br>
obtained from Reference Example 2 was dried at 50°C for<br>
2 hours to obtain 780 g of aripiprazole hydrate<br>
crystals- The moisture value of the crystals had a<br>
moisture value was 3.82% measured according to the Karl<br>
Fischer method. As shown in Figure 6,<br>
thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis<br>
revealed endothermic peaks at 75.0, 123.5 and 140.5°C.<br>
Because dehydration began near at 70°C, there was no<br>
clear melting point (rap) was observed.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, the powder x-ray<br>
diffraction spectrum of aripiprazole hydrate obtained<br>
by this method exhibited characteristic peaks at 20 =<br>
12.6% 15.1°, 17.4°, 18.2% 18.7°, 24.3° and 27.5°.<br>
The powder x-ray diffraction spectrum of this<br><br>

aripiprazole hydrate was identical to the powder x-ray<br>
diffraction spectrum of aripiprazole hydrate presented<br>
at the 4th Joint Japanese-Korean Symposium on Isolation<br>
Technology.<br>
Reference Example..4.<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate crystals (500.3 g)<br>
obtained in Reference Example 3 were milled by using a<br>
sample mill (small size atomizer). The main axis<br>
rotation rate was set to 12,000 rpm and the feed<br>
rotation rate to 17 rpm, and a 1.0 mm herringbone<br>
screen was used. Milling was finished in 3 minutes,<br>
and obtained 474.6 g (94.9%) of powder of aripiprazole<br>
hydrate A.<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate A (powder) obtained<br>
in this way had a mean particle size of 20-25 pm. The<br>
melting point (mp) was undetermined because dehydration<br>
was observed beginning near at 70°C.<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate A (powder) obtained<br>
above exhibited an 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6, TMS) spectrum which<br>
was substantially identical to the 2H-NMR spectrum shown<br>
in Figure 2. Specifically, it had characteristic peaks<br>
at 1.55-1.63 ppm (m, 2H), 1.68-1.78 ppm (m, 2H), 2.35-<br>
2.46 ppm (m, 4H), 2.48-2.56 ppm (m, 4H + DMSO), 2.78<br>

7.04 ppm (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 1H) , 7.11-7.17 ppm (in, 1H) ,<br><br>
44<br>
7.28-7,32 pprn (m, 2H) and 10.00 ppm (s, 1H) .<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate A (powder) obtained<br>
above had a powder x-ray diffraction spectrum which was<br>
substantially identical to the powder x-ray diffraction<br>
spectrum shown in Figure 3. Specifically, it had<br>
characteristic peaks at 29 = 12.6°, 15.4°, 17.3°, 18,0°,<br>
18.6°, 22.5° and 24.8°. This pattern is different from<br>
the powder x-ray spectrum of unmilled aripiprazole<br>
hydrate shown in Figure 7.<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate A (powder) obtained<br>
above had infrared absorption bands at 2951, 2822,<br>
1692, 1577, 1447, 1378, 1187, 963 and 784 cm-1 on the IR<br>
(KBr) spectrum.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the axipiprazole<br>
hydrate A (powder) obtained above had a weak peak at<br>
71.3°C in thermogravimetric/differential thermal<br>
analysis and a broad endothermic peak (weight loss<br>
observed corresponding to one molecule of water)<br>
between 60-120°C which was clearly different from the<br>
endothermic curve of unmilled aripiprazole hydrate (see<br>
Figure 6).<br>

membranes. The test compound was studied at 10<br>
concentrations to determine effects upon basal [35S]GTPyS<br>
binding relative to that produced by 10 M 5-HT. The<br>
relative potency (EC50, 95% confidence interval) and<br>
intrinsic agonist activity (% of Emax for 10 M 5-HT) was<br>
calculated for each compound by computerized non-linear<br>
regression analysis of complete concentration-effect<br>
data. The binding affinity of test compound at the h5-<br>
HT1A receptor was determined by its ability to prevent<br><br>
49<br>
[3H ] 8-OH-DPAT binding to CHO cell membranes that express<br>
this receptor. Non-linear regression analysis of the<br>
competition binding data was used to calculate an<br>
inhibition constant (TC50, 95% confidence interval),<br>
which is the concentration of test compound that<br>
occupies half of the h5-HTlA sites specifically bound<br>
by [3H]8-OH-DPAT. The affinity of h5-HT1A receptors for<br>
test compound (Ki, 95% confidence interval) was<br>
calculated by the equation, Ki = (IC50)/(1+([ [3H] 8-OH-<br>
DPAT]/Kd) , where the Kd for [3H]8-OH-DPAT at h5-HTlA =<br>
0.69 nM (NEN Life Sciences). All estimates of drug<br>
binding affinity, potency and intrinsic efficacy at the<br>
h5-HTlA receptor were calculated using GraphPad Prism<br>
version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego,<br>
Calif.).<br>
2. Results<br>
The test compound and 5-HT produced<br>
concentration-dependent increases above basal [35S]GTPyS<br>
binding. 1% DMSO tested alone had no effect upon basal<br>
or drug-induced [35S]GTPyS binding.<br>
The test compound (EC50 = 2.12 nM) , 5-HT (EC50<br>
= 3.67 nM) , potently stimulated basal [35S]GTPyS binding.<br>
Potency and intrinsic agonist efficacy estimates were<br>
derived by non-linear regression analysis with correla-<br>
tion coefficients (r2)&gt;0.98 in each case (Table 1). The<br>
test compound exerted partial agonist efficacies in the<br>
65 - 70% range. WAY-100 635 produced no significant<br><br>
50<br>
change (unpaired Student's t-test) in basal [35S]GTPyS<br>
binding at ail concentrations tested (Table 1). WAY-<br>
100635 did, however, completely inhibit the effects of<br>
5-HT and test compound upon [35S]GTPyS binding to h5-HTlA<br>
receptors in CHO cell membranes (Table 2). Tables 1<br>
and 2 are shown below.<br>
The test compound demonstrated high affinity<br>
binding to h5-HTlA receptors in CHO cell membranes (IC50<br>
= 4.03 nM, 95% confidence interval = 2.67 to 6.08 nM;<br>
Ki = 1.65 nM, 95% confidence interval = 1.09 to 2.48<br>
nM) .<br>

Pharmacological Test<br>
The forced swimming test proposed by Porsolt<br>
et ai. (Porsolt, R. D. et al.: Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn.,<br>
229, 327-336, 1977) is widely used as to an<br>
experimental animal model for predicting the<br>
antidepressant activity in clinical settings. In this<br>
experimental model, a test mouse is put in a cylinder<br>
in which a suitable amount of water is contained, and<br>
the antidepressant action of a test drug is detected by<br>
measuring the immobility time, as the indication, shown<br>
by the mouse. It was reported that the action of<br>
shortening the immobility time is correlated with<br>
clinically observed antidepressive action (Willner, P.:<br>
Psychopharmacology, 83: 1-16, 1984). The crisis of<br>
depression is closely concerned with lowering of<br>
serotonin 5-HT1A receptor neurotransmission action, and<br>
the present inventors have found the facts that<br><br>
52<br>
antidepressive action of anridepressants which affect<br>
to serotonin system can be detected more precisely<br>
using prolongation of the immobility time performed<br>
with WAY-100635, which is a selective serotonin 5-HT1A<br>
receptor antagonist. The prolongation of the<br>
immobility time performed by WAY-100635 is defined as<br>
the indication. In this manner, the antidepressive<br>
action of test antidepressants was determined by taking<br>
the prolongation of immobility time performed by WAY-<br>
100635 in the forced swimming test as the indication.<br>
In a cylinder (diameter: 9 cm, height 20 cm),<br>
water was poured therein up to the height of 9.5 cm,<br>
from the bottom, then a mouse of ICR strain is placed<br>
in the cylinder. After placing the mouse in the<br>
cylinder, an immobility time of 6 minutes is measured.<br>
During the test, the water temperature is maintained at<br>
23 to 24oC. A test drug is orally administered to the<br>
mouse at 1 or 2 hours before placing the mouse in the<br>
water. WAY-100635 is administered subcutaneously to<br>
the mouse 30 minutes before placing the mouse in the<br>
water.<br>
During this test, aripiprazole is used in<br>
combination together with citalopram, escitalopram,<br>
fluoxetine, venlafaxine or milnacipran. Following such<br>
combination administration, a decrease in the<br>
immobility time (the antidepressant activity) is<br>
observed in comparison with the case of single use of<br>
each one of aripiprazole, citalopram, escitalopram,<br><br>
WO 2004/060374 .	PCT/JP2003/016724<br>
53<br>
fluoxetine, venlafaxine or milnacipran, respectively.<br>
Further, when aripiprazole is used in<br>
combination with citaloprain, escitalopram, fluoxetine,<br>
venlafaxine or milnacipran, a decrease in the<br>
immobility time (the antidepressant activity) is<br>
observed in comparison to administration of the<br>
available atypical antipsychotic drugs such as<br>
olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone in combination with<br>
citalopram, fluoxetine, venlafaxine or milnacipran.<br>

disorder who were previously non-responsive or<br>
partially responsive no anti-depressant medication<br>
comprising serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These<br>
patients currently receive therapy through<br>
administration of serotonin reuptake inhibitors.<br>
Patients ranging in age from 18 to 65 years<br>
who have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder<br>
and are receiving therapy with a serotonin reuptake<br>
inhibitor are evaluated to ensure that they have a<br>
baseline Hamilton score for depression (item 17) of 14<br>
or higher. Only patients with such Hamilton scores<br>
receive treatment. These patients are interviewed to<br>
obtain a complete medical and psychiatric history.<br>
Aripiprazole is first administered at a dose of 10<br>
mg/day and increased to 30 mg/day as needed in the<br>
opinion of the monitoring psychiatrist. Aripiprazole<br>
is administered to these patients at a dose of from 10<br>
mg/day to 30 mg/day for a period of at least four<br>
weeks, and up to eight weeks for patients who respond<br>
well to this treatment during the first four weeks.<br>

Example 9<br>
Pharmacological test<br>
The tail suspension test (TST) was originally<br>
described by Steru et al. (1985) .11 A mouse suspended<br>
by its tail shows periods of agitation and immobility.<br>
The antidepressant activity of a test drug can be<br>
detected as an index of shortening the immobility time.<br>
This test is widely used as to an experimental animal<br>
model for predicting the antidepressant activity of a<br>
test drug in clinical settings. An automated device<br>
for performing the TST was developed by the authors of<br>
the TST (1989).21 We improved this device and developed<br>
our own device incorporating an electric balance, an<br>
A/D converter, a testing box (30x25x25 cm), and a<br>
personal computer. The mouse was suspended from a hook<br>
hanging from the ceiling in the testing box by adhesive<br>
tape applied 20 mm from the tip of the tail. The<br>
duration of immobility was measured by the computer for<br>
a period of 15 min following the start of suspension.<br>
The immobility time for a period of 10 min (5-15 min)<br>
was evaluated. The experiments were carried out in a<br>
sound-proof room.<br>
Aripiprazole was suspended in 0.5% gum<br>
arabic-0.9% saline solution and citalopram was<br>
dissolved in 0.9% saline solution. Aripiprazole<br>
(3 mg/kg) and citalopram (3 mg/kg) were orally<br>
administered to mice 60 min before the start of<br>
suspension. In this test, the decrease in the<br><br>
70<br>
immobility time of the combination of aripiprazoie with<br>
citalopram was statistically significant synergistic<br>
effect in comparison with the effects of aripiprazoie-<br>
and citaroplam-treated groups (Table 3) .<br>
