				<td>ORGANIC COMPOUNDS<br>
The present invention refers to a novel class of spiroalkyl- and -alkenylketones and esters thereof possessing damascone-like odour notes and to their use as odorants. This invention relates furthermore to a method for their production and for fragrance compositions comprising them.<br>
In the fragrance industry there is a constant demand for new compounds that enhance, modify or improve on odour notes. Damascones, also known as rose ketones, constitute an important class of perfume ingredients. They display particular floral (rosy)-fruity notes reminiscent of dried fruits. Thus, there is a constant desire to find new compounds possessing a damascone-like odour note.<br>
The present invention refers in one of its aspects to the use as fragrance of a compound of formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

The proportion is typically from 0.0001 to 2 weight percent of the application. In one embodiment, compounds of the present invention may be employed in a fabric softener in an amount of from 0.0001 to 0.005 weight percent. In another embodiment, compounds of the present invention may be used in an alcoholic solution in amounts of from 0.01 to 3 weight percent, more preferably between 0.5 and 2 weight percent. However, these values are given only by way of example, since the experienced perfumer may also achieve effects or may create novel accords with lower or higher concentrations, e.g. up to about 20 weight percent based on the fragrance composition.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be employed into the fragrance application simply by directly mixing the fragrance composition with the fragrance application, and/or they may, in an earlier step, be entrapped with an entrapment material such as polymers, capsules, microcapsules and nanocapsules, liposomes, film formers, absorbents such as carbon or zeolites, cyclic oligosaccharides and mixtures thereof, and/or they may be chemically bonded to substrates, which are adapted to release the fragrance molecule upon application of an external stimulus such as light, enzyme, or the like, and then mixed with the application.<br>
Thus, the invention additionally provides a method of manufacturing a fragrance application and consumer products resulting therefrom. The method comprises the incorporation therein of a compound of formula (I) as a fragrance ingredient, either by directly admixing the compound to the application or by admixing a fragrance composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or a precursor thereof, which may then be mixed to a fragrance application, using conventional techniques and methods. Through the addition of an olfactory acceptable amount of a compound of the present invention, the odour notes of a fragrance application will be improved, enhanced or modified.<br>
By "precursors" is meant, in particular, reaction products of a compound of formula (I) with a compound comprising at least one functional group selected from the group of primary amine, secondary amine, sulfhydril (thiol), hydroxyl and carboxyl, in which a covalent bond is formed between at least one carbon atom of the compound of formula<br>
 (I) and at least one of the hetero atoms of said compounds comprising at least one functional group selected from the group of N, S and O.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a method for improving, enhancing or modifying a fragrance application through the addition thereto of an olfactory acceptable amount of a compound of formula (I), or a mixture thereof.<br>
The invention also provides a fragrance application comprising:<br>
a)	as odorant a compound of formula (I) or a mixture thereof; and<br>
b)	a consumer product base.<br>
As used herein, "fragrance application" means any consumer products, such as fine fragrances, e.g. eaux de perfume and eaux de toilette; household products, e.g. detergents for dishwasher, surface cleaner, air freshener; laundry products, e.g. softener, bleach, detergent; body care products, e.g. after-shave lotion, shampoo, shower gel, shower and bath salt, hygiene product; and cosmetics, e.g. deodorants, vanishing creams, comprising an odorant. This list of products is given by way of illustration and is not to be regarded as being in any way limiting.<br>
As used herein, "consumer product base" means a composition for use as a consumer product to fulfill specific actions, such as cleaning, softening, and caring or the like. Examples of such products include fabric care and personal care products such as laundry care detergents, rinse conditioners, personal cleansing compositions. The composition may comprise a variety of active ingredients such as surfactants, polymers, fillers and auxiliary agents, such as dyes and solvents.<br>

At-20°C, a solution of 3,3,15-trimethyl-2,4-dioxadispiro[5.0.4.4]pentadec-13-ene-1,5-dione (85 g, 80% pure, 244 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (850 ml) was treated within 15 min. with methyllithium (427 ml, 1.6M in diethyl ether, 683 mmol). The resulting solution was warmed to 10°C by removing the cooling bath before being refluxed for 3 h, cooled at 0°C, poured into a mixture of 2N aqueous NaOH and ice, and extracted twice with methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE, 400 ml). The combined organic phases were washed with water, dried (MgSO4), and concentrated giving unreacted starting material (20 g, 46% pure). The aqueous phase was acidified with 2N aqueous HCI to pH 1 and extracted three times with MTBE (450 ml), washed twice with a saturated aqueous solution of NaCI, dried (MgSO4), and concentrated giving the crude intermediate ketoacid (52.2 g) which was refluxed in pyridine (520 ml) during 2 h. The resulting mixture was concentrated and the residue was poured into 2N aqueous HCI and ice, and extracted three times with MTBE (350 ml). The combined organic phases washed to pH 7, dried (MgSO4), and concentrated. Short-path distillation (bath temperature 110°C, head temperature: 70-85°C, 0.09 mbar) of the crude product (39.3 g) gave a diastereomeric mixture of the desired methyl ketones (30.7 g, 66%, rel-(6S,7R)/rel-(6R.7R) 30:70). Sodium (2.2 g, 96 mmol) was added to ethanol (300 ml) and the resulting solution was treated with a solution of 30:70 mixture of 1-(rel-(6S,7R)-7-methylspiro[4.5]dec-8-en-6-yl)ethanone and 1 -(rel-(6R,7R)-7-methylspiro[4.5]dec-8-en-<br>

The combined organic phases washed three times with a saturated aqueous solution of NaCI, dried (MgSO4), and concentrated. Short-path distillation (bath temperature 110°C, head temperature 85°C, 0.09 mbar) of the crude product (32.9 g) gave a diastereomeric mixture of the desired methyl ketones (26.8 g, 87%, rel-(6S,7R)/rel-(6R,7R) 85:15).

The required intermediate 1-(7-methylspiro[4.5]dec-6-en-6-yl)ethanone was then prepared from 7-methylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one according to the Example 10 via 6-ethynyl-7-methylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol (lithium acetylide ethylenediamine complex, THF, 2 h, 0-20°C, 75%, 78:22 diastereomeric mixture) and 6-ethynyl-7-methylspiro[4.5]dec-6-ene (POCI3, pyridine, 100°C, 19h, 45%) that was treated with AcOH/H2SO4 (20°C, 50 min., 34%) to give 1-(7-methylspiro[4.5]dec-6-en-6-yl)ethanone. Subsequent aldol condensation with acetaldehyde (LDA, THF; according to the Example 10) followed by treatment of the crude with acetic anhydride/sodium acetate (80°C, 5 h, 59%; according to the Example 10) gave (E)-1-(7-methylspiro[4.5]dec-6-en-6-yl)but-2-en-1-one.<br>
