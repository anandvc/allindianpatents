[0019]<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view along the line 6-6 of Fig. 5.  In this figure, the protection plate 57d is attached to the tread bar 57c in the vehicle running direction (left side of the figure).<br>
[0020]<br>
Operation of the stand device explained above will then be explained.<br>
Fig. 7 is a diagram for explaining operation of the stand device of the present invention. Even when muddy water splashes to the main stand 57 from the road surface as<br>
indicted by the arrow mark  the protection plate 57d of the main stand 57 prevents that the muddy water is splashed to the rear upper side of the vehicle and yet splashes muddy water to the downward as indicted by the arrow marks (2), (3). Therefore, the side cover 17 and rear upper cover 19 (refer to Fig. 1) are not contaminated with muddy water.<br>
[0021 ]<br>
Moreover, even when a fellow passenger P sitting on<br>
the rear part of the seat 23 (refer to Fig. 2) places her legs on the step 72, the legs F and clothes of the fellow passenger P are not contaminated by muddy water.<br>
In addition, even if a stone, for example, hits the main stand 57 , the body or fellow passenger P can be protected from the stone by the protection plate 57d. [0022]<br>
Furthermore, since the protection plate 57d is provided in almost the vehicle running direction, it prevents that muddy water D splashes upward. [0023]<br>
Figs. 8(a), 8(b) are sectional views indicating the other embodiments of the stand device of the present invention.  Fig. 8(a) shows the condition that the protection plate 57d is welded to the upper part of the tread bar 57c, the flat plate 75 is attached to the lower part of the protection plate 57d and these protection plate 57d and flat plate 75 reinforce the tread bar 57c.<br>
With this structure, the protection plate 57d and flat plate 75 effectively prevent that the side cover 17 and fellow passenger P shown in Fig. 7 are contaminated by muddy water. Moreover, use of the flat plate 75 simplifies the manufacturing and reduces the manufacturing cost of the stand device.<br>
[0024]<br>
Fig. 8(b) shows the condition that a reinforcing member 76 having the V-shape cross-sectional view is welded<br>
in front of the tread bar 57c for the reinforcing purpose.<br>
The reinforcing member 76 includes the flat area 76a and the inclined area 76b and the flat area 76a corresponds to the protect.on plate 57d explained previously.<br>
In such a structure, the reinforcing member 76 prevents that the side cover 17 and fellow passenger P are contaminated by muddy water as indicated in Fig. 7.  Moreover, since the reinforcing member 76 is formed as a single member, it can be formed easily by the press machining and can also be fixed easily to the tread bar 57c with the less number of welding points.<br>
[0025]<br>
