				<td>METHOD FOR REGENERATING OF USED MINERAL OILS FOR<br>
OBTAINING LUBRICANT BASES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention, in general, is associated with the regeneration of used<br>
oils; an industrial operation which consists in recovering the base oils by<br>
separating them from the additives, from their degradation products and from<br>
the contaminants acquired during its use or collection. More specifically, the<br>
invention refers to a method for regenerating used petroleum oils by<br>
demetallization and distillation.<br>
The refined petroleum oils which are used to make lubricants and<br>
other industrial oils are called lubricant bases.<br>
The lubricants and other industrial oils are formulated by mixing the<br>
lubricant bases with additives, some of which contain metals (Ca, Zn, etc.),<br>
which confer them the qualities demanded by the service they have to<br>
provide (resistance to oxidation, to shearing and to temperature, emulsifying<br>
and anti-foaming properties, low variability of viscosity with temperature,<br>
etc.).<br>
The discarded oils, after their use in motors and other machines, are<br>
called used oils. The regeneration of used oils consists in recovering the<br>
lubricant bases by separating them from the additives as well as from their<br>
degradation products (lighter petroleum fractions such as naphtha and gas-<br>
oil, and heavier ones such as asphalts and coke) and the contaminants<br>
acquired in their use or collection, in garages and petrol stations, such as<br>
water, glycols and solvents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The separation of the additives, degradation products and<br>
contaminants of used oils is normally carried out by distillation methods. In<br>
the patent WO 9407798 (Viscolube Italiana Sp, 1994) a typical distillation<br>
method is described which uses high temperatures under vacuum distillation<br>
(around 350 °C) with the aim of breaking down the additives, which also<br>
deteriorates the lubricant bases, which acquire colour and odour and contain<br>
oxygenated products. To obtain quality lubricant bases by distillation at high<br>
temperature it is necessary to use final refining treatments with acid and<br>
earths or by hydrogenation, which are onerous and complicated.<br>
Also, the high temperatures employed cause fouling of the industrial<br>
equipment, which involves stopping the process for cleaning.<br>
As an alternative to the separation of the additives by distillation, the<br>
chemical demetallization has been developed by reacting the metal additives<br>
of the used oil with reagents that form metal salts. Thus, in the patent US<br>
4247389 (Phillips Petroleum US, 1981) the used oil is treated with solutions<br>
of ammonium phosphate at temperatures of 320-420 °C. However, the<br>
demetallization treatment at these temperatures and the subsequent<br>
distillation of the demetallized oil also produce odour and colour and yield<br>
unstable products, which require treating the bases obtained by<br>
hydrogenation or by adsorbents, with the already indicated disadvantages of<br>
these final refining processes.<br>
On the other hand, there are some references to the use of alkaline<br>
hydroxides in the regeneration of used oils. Thus, in patent DE 3433336<br>
(BUSS AG, 1985) treatment with alkaline hydroxides is employed on the<br>
used oils before proceeding to the separation of the additives and asphalts<br>
by distillation.<br><br>
Other methods use alkaline treatment of the lubricant fractions<br>
obtained after separating the additives and asphalts by distillation (US<br>
4834868, F. J. Lappin 1989, and WO 9826031, Sotulub, Tunisia 1997); or by<br>
extraction with solvents and distillation (PCT/ES02/00354 Sener, Spain<br>
2002), achieving in this way lubricant bases which do not require final refining<br>
treatments by acid/earths or hydrogenation.<br>
However, no antecedents have been about methods which use<br>
treatments with alkaline hydroxides before, during or after chemical<br>
demetallization of used oils.<br>
The present invention consists in a method of chemical demetallization<br>
followed by a distillation process of the demetallized product in the presence<br>
of alkaline hydroxides, both earned out at moderate temperatures in such<br>
conditions that lubricant bases are obtained with good characteristics of<br>
odour and colour, acidity and copper corrosion test and complying with other<br>
typical specifications of lubricant bases of first refining.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has as its objective to regenerate used oils by<br>
means of a chemical demetallization process which does not require costly<br>
treatments by hydrogenation or by acid and earths, to obtain lubricant bases<br>
which comply which the specifications of virgin base oils.<br>
The objective of the method is also to carry out the regeneration under<br>
moderate temperature conditions in a way which will avoid fouling of the<br>
equipment and the need for frequent cleaning in installations for used oil<br>
treatment.<br><br>
Likewise it is the objective of the method that the regeneration is<br>
carried out without producing emissions and odours and without generating<br>
polluting solid wastes (acid residues, adsorbent earths, etc.).<br>
Finally, it is also the objective of the present invention to carry out the<br>
regeneration of used oils by means of a continuous industrial process which<br>
should require a low investment and have moderate operational costs, with<br>
high returns, with the aim of making competitive installations of moderate<br>
capacity (15,000 - 30,000 t/y).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for the regeneration of used<br>
mineral oils for obtaining lubricant bases which comprises the following<br>
steps:<br>
(a)	demetallization of the used mineral oil by means of chemical<br>
treatment of said oil with an aqueous solution of a chemical<br>
reagent containing anions which form low solubility salts with<br>
the metals of the oil, followed by the separation of the<br>
demetallized oil;<br>
(b)	distillation of the demetallized oil obtained in step (a) at<br>
atmospheric pressure and in the presence of alkaline<br>
hydroxides; and<br>
(c)	distillation of the bottom liquid obtained in the atmospheric<br>
distillation of step (b) under vacuum and in the presence of<br>
alkaline hydroxides to obtain lubricant bases.<br>
Said method can be carried out in continuous mode or discontinuous<br>
mode, preferably in continuous mode.<br><br>
The term "low solubility salts" in the context of the invention refers to<br>
salts which tend to precipitate in the medium in which they are dissolved.<br>
It has been verified experimentally that the elimination of the metals<br>
from the additives takes place with reasonable demetallization yields<br>
(achieving a content in metals of about 100 ppm), when the oils are treated<br>
with ammonium phosphates (mono or diammonium) at moderate<br>
temperatures (120-180 °C). This enables the operation to be carried out<br>
without deterioration of the base oil's, by avoiding the temperatures described<br>
in the literature (around 350 °C) for achieving high demetallization yields<br>
(content in metals less than 10 ppm). Other ammonium salts, whose anions<br>
have the property of forming insoluble or low solubility salts in water with<br>
metals present in used oils, are equally effective as reagents in the<br>
demetallization. Thus, for example, besides the already mentioned mono-<br>
and diammonium phosphate, triammonium phosphate, the mono- and<br>
diammonium sulphates, ammonium bisulphate and ammonium<br>
polyphosphates or mixtures of these salts whose anions form insoluble or low<br>
solubility salts with the metals of the additives (mainly Ca, Zn and Mg) or with<br>
other metals present in used oils (Pb, Fe, Cu and others) can be used.<br>
So, in a particular embodiment of the method of the invention, the<br>
chemical reagent employed in step (a) is an ammonium salt; said reagent<br>
being used in a proportion of 0.5% to 5% by weight of ammonium salt in<br>
relation to the used oil.<br>
In another particular embodiment, said ammonium salt contains<br>
anions of the phosphate and sulphate groups, and can be mono-ammonium<br>
or diammonium phosphate, or mono-ammonium or diammonium sulphate, or<br>
a mixture thereof.<br><br>
In a particular embodiment of the method of the invention, the<br>
chemical treatment of step (a) is carried out in a continuous way in tubular<br>
reactors, or in one or several well-mixed reactors in series or in a<br>
combination of both systems, and in which the reaction is carried out at<br>
temperatures between 120 °C and 180 °C, at pressures between 3 and 11<br>
bar and with residence times between 10 and 120 minutes.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the separation of step (a) is<br>
carried out continuously by means of an adiabatic decompression which<br>
produces flash vaporisation, so that at least a part of the water and the light<br>
hydrocarbons and solvents is vaporised. These light hydrocarbons and<br>
solvents are collected and decanted after their condensation.<br>
The liquid obtained after the decompression and flash vaporisation is<br>
cooled and separated into a sludge which containing the metal salts, an<br>
aqueous phase with excess of reagent and the demetallized oil. The<br>
separation of the demetallized oil from the sludge of metal salts is carried out<br>
preferably by continuous centrifugation in one or two steps in series.<br>
Likewise, it has been verified that when the oils demetallized in this<br>
way are distilled at moderate temperatures in the presence of alkaline<br>
hydroxides, lubricant bases of a quality equal to that of virgin bases of first<br>
refining is achieved, avoiding the final treatments with acid and earths or by<br>
hydrogenation, which are necessary when using high temperatures in the<br>
demetallization and in the distillation.<br>
Therefore, in another embodiment of the method of the invention, in<br>
step (b) the demetallized oil is distilled continuously at atmospheric pressure<br>
in the presence of alkaline hydroxides, so that the remains of water, light<br>
hydrocarbons and solvents are distilled, together with the ammonia released<br>
by the effect of the alkaline hydroxides.<br><br>
In another particular embodiment, the distillate is subjected to<br>
condensation, followed by decanting, in such a way that an organic phase is<br>
obtained which contains light hydrocarbons and solvents, and an aqueous<br>
phase which contains ammonia. The non-condensables of the distillate are<br>
washed with water or with an aqueous solution of an acid to retain the<br>
ammonia in aqueous solution, which is added to the aqueous ammonia<br>
phase obtained previously.<br>
In order to carry out this atmospheric distillation in a simple way and to<br>
subject the product to the least possible degradation, this operation of<br>
distillation at atmospheric pressure is carried out by indirect heating by<br>
means of a thermal fluid at temperatures below 300 °C. Preferably, said<br>
atmospheric distillation is carried out in a continuous way subjecting the<br>
demetallized oil to flash vaporisation at temperatures between 200 and 300<br>
°C.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, in step (c) the bottom liquid<br>
obtained in the atmospheric distillation of step (b) is distilled continuously<br>
under vacuum in a rectification column in the presence of alkaline<br>
hydroxides, preferably at a pressure between 2 and 10 mbar at the top of the<br>
column and a column feed temperature between 310 and 335 °C, obtaining<br>
as side cuts a vacuum gas-oil, one or several fractions of lubricant bases and<br>
a bottom with characteristics of fuel-oil or an asphalt component.<br>
Likewise, in the method of the invention, for carrying out the vacuum<br>
distillation of step (c) under mild conditions (temperatures lower than 330 °C),<br>
the fractionating column operates preferably at low pressure (2 to 10 mbar in<br>
the head), with low pressure loss (packed column instead of valve or<br>
perforated plates) and by heating the feed to the column by means of a<br>
thermal oil at a temperature less than 385 °C in a tubular heat exchanger,<br>
designed for high fluid velocity in the tubes.<br><br>
Similarly, the atmospheric distillation of step (b) is preferably<br>
performed in a tubular heat exchanger with high fluid velocity through the<br>
tubes, a thermal oil preferably at a temperature less than 300 °C being the<br>
heating fluid which circulates outside these tubes.<br>
So, in a particular embodiment of the invention, the distillations of<br>
steps (b) and (c), that is, the distillation at atmospheric pressure and the<br>
vacuum distillation, are carried out in tubular heat exchangers, in which the<br>
demetallized oil obtained in step (a), or the bottom liquid obtained in the<br>
atmospheric distillation of step (b), circulates at high speed inside the tubes<br>
and in which the heating fluid on the outside of these tubes is a thermal oil<br>
which circulates preferably at temperatures lower than 300 °C in the<br>
atmospheric distillation and lower than 385 °C in the vacuum distillation.<br>
Another characteristic of the method claimed is the use of proportions<br>
of alkaline hydroxides between 0.5% and 5% by weight of oil, higher than<br>
that described in the literature (generally lower than 0.5% by weight), since<br>
sufficient hydroxide is required to displace the ammonia in the demetallized<br>
oil.<br>
Thus, in another particular embodiment of the method of the invention,<br>
the alkaline hydroxide used in steps (b) and (c) is sodium hydroxide or<br>
potassium hydroxide or a mixture of both, which is added in a proportion of<br>
0.5% to 5% by weight in relation to the demetallized oil, more preferably in a<br>
proportion of 0.5% to 3%, so that said addition is carried out completely<br>
before the atmospheric distillation, or a part before the atmospheric<br>
distillation and a part before the vacuum distillation.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br><br>
Figure 1 attached illustrates the method of the invention, carried out<br>
continuously, as is described below:<br>
The current of used oil to be regenerated (1) and the chemical reagent<br>
(2), an aqueous solution of ammonium phosphate, for example, are<br>
introduced into the reaction device (A) where they react to form metal salts.<br>
As has been mentioned previously, the reaction device (A) could be a<br>
tubular reactor, one or several agitated reactors in series, or a combination<br>
of both, where the reaction is preferably carried out at pressure and<br>
continuously.<br>
The product which flows from the reaction device (A) is subjected to<br>
decompression in (B), some vapours being separated which are condensed<br>
in (C) and decanted into two phases in (D), to give rise to an organic phase<br>
(3) of light hydrocarbons and solvents (in the petrol and kerosene range) and<br>
an aqueous phase (4).<br>
The liquid resulting from the decompression in (B) is cooled down in<br>
(E) and passes to the phase separation system (F). Although the phase<br>
separation system (F) can be a combination of decanting, filtration and<br>
centrifugation techniques, in the method of the present invention the<br>
separation of an oily sludge which contains the metal salts (6), an aqueous<br>
phase with excess reagent (7), and the demetailized oil (5), are achieved<br>
advantageously by continuous centrifugation in one or two centrifuges in<br>
series.<br>
The aqueous solution which contains the excess reagent (7) can be<br>
recycled, at least partly, to prepare the chemical reagent again (1), while the<br>
liquid phase which contains the metal salts (6) is sent to a waste treatment<br>
plant for its subsequent processing.<br><br>
The demetallized oil (5), mixed with the alkaline hydroxide (8) is<br>
subjected to continuous atmospheric distillation in (G), some vapours being<br>
obtained which are condensed in (H) and decanted in (I), obtaining in this<br>
way an organic phase (9) of hydrocarbons and solvents, of a higher boiling<br>
point than those separated in the current (3), in the range of kerosene and<br>
light gas-oil, and an aqueous phase (10) which contains the ammonia<br>
displaced by the alkaline reagent. The non-condensables from the decanter<br>
(I) are washed with water or an aqueous solution of an acid to retain the<br>
ammonia which is added to the aqueous ammonia solution (10) obtained<br>
previously.<br>
The bottom of the atmospheric distillation, optionally with a second<br>
addition of alkaline hydroxide (8), is subjected to rectification in a vacuum<br>
distillation column (J), thus separating a vacuum gas-oil (11), one or several<br>
side cuts of lubricant bases (12) (SN-150 and SN-350, for example) and a<br>
column bottom (13) which has characteristics of fuel-oil or of an asphalt<br>
component.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The examples which are shown below illustrate the method with their<br>
embodiment not necessarily constituting the limits of the possibilities of the<br>
invention.<br>
As used oil a product is employed with the following characteristics:<br>
Colour: dark<br>
Viscosity (ASTM D 445) at 100 °C: 13.3 cSt.<br>
Water (ASTM D 95): 5% by weight<br>
Metals: 3,500 ppm (Ca 1,750 ppm, Zn 854 ppm).<br>
Distillation ASTM D 1160<br>
I.P. = 228 °C<br>
F.P. = 520 °C<br>
Distilled volume: 88%<br><br>
Example No. 1 (Conventional demetallization and distillation treatment)<br>
1000 g of used oil is mixed with a saturated aqueous solution which<br>
contains 25 g of diammonium phosphate and is heated for 60 minutes at 150<br>
°C in an autoclave at 6 bar provided with mechanical agitation.<br>
After the reaction, the autoclave is decompressed, condensing the<br>
vapours by means of a refrigerant and collecting an aqueous condensate<br>
from which 20 g of light hydrocarbons and chlorinated products is separated<br>
by decanting.<br>
The contents of the autoclave, after decompression, is cooled down to<br>
ambient temperature and is centrifuged, separating 30 g of a sludge<br>
containing metal phosphates (zinc, calcium, etc.), the aqueous phase<br>
containing the excess ammonium phosphate and 910 g of demetallized oil<br>
containing 123 ppm of metals (Zn: 30 ppm; Ca: 39 ppm).<br>
The 910 g of demetallized oil is distilled at atmospheric pressure until it<br>
reaches 280 °C. Thus 35 g of an organic phase (light gas-oil, solvents, etc.)<br>
are obtained from which distilled water is decanted leaving a distillation<br>
bottom which contains the demetallized oil.<br>
Next, the bottom is vacuum distilled (15 mm Hg) obtaining 61 g of<br>
heavy gas-oil, 393 g of light base oil and 306 g of heavy base oil leaving in<br>
the distillation flask a bottom of 114 g of fuel-oil or an asphalt component.<br>
The base oils obtained have a strong colour (2.5 to 5.0) and odour, an<br>
acidity greater than 0.1 mg KOH/g and its IR spectrum showing a notable<br>
concentration of oxygenated products in the 1700 - 1730 cm-1 band,<br>
requiring an additional treatment with adsorbent earths or by hydrogenation,<br>
to comply with the typical specifications of virgin lubricant bases.<br><br>
To verify this aspect, 250 cm3 of SN-350 oil obtained were taken<br>
(colour: 5.5, acidity: 0.14) and were treated with 4% diatomaceous earths<br>
and 1% CaO for 20 minutes at 130 °C; after the reaction the mixture was<br>
cooled down and filtered through, a sintered glass disc.<br>
The oil obtained had a colour of 2.5, an acidity of 0.04 and a light<br>
odour.<br>
The recovery in lubricant fractions is 74% by weight of the starting<br>
used oil on a dry basis, before these additional treatments with earths, and<br>
72% after treatment with earths.<br>
Example No. 1 shows that carrying out the distillation of the<br>
demetallized oil in low temperature conditions, an oil base is obtained with<br>
good recoveries, but with characteristics which still require a final treatment<br>
with earths or by hydrogenation.<br>
Example No. 2 (Treatment according to the claimed method)<br>
1000 g of used oil has is demetallized as shown in example 1.<br>
The 910 g of demetallized oil is mixed with a saturated solution of<br>
potassium hydroxide containing 25 g of potassium hydroxide and is distilled<br>
at atmospheric pressure until reaching 280 °C.<br>
The distillate is collected over water to retain the ammonia released.<br>
Thus an ammonium solution is obtained containing 15 g of ammonia, from<br>
which is decanted 33 g of an organic phase containing kerosene, light gas-oil<br>
and solvents.<br><br>
The bottom of the atmospheric distillation containing the sodium<br>
hydroxide added previously, is subjected to rectification at vacuum (2 mm<br>
Hg) for obtaining 55 g of spindle oil (SN-80), 400 g of light base oil (SN-150)<br>
and 235 g of heavy base oil (SN 350), leaving 200 g as a bottom. The<br>
recovery in lubricant bases is 67% in weight of used oil on a dry basis.<br>
The base oils obtained have characteristics typical of virgin base oils<br>
and comply with the normal specifications of these products, without the<br>
need for further treatments, as shown below:<br><br>
Example No. 2 demonstrates that demetallization followed by<br>
distillation, both carried out under moderate temperature conditions and in<br>
the presence of an alkaline hydroxide, as specified in the present invention,<br>
produces base oils with characteristics of base oils of first refining.<br><br>

where the reaction is carried out at temperatures between 120 °C and 180 °C, at<br>
pressures between 3 bar and 11 bar and with residence times in the reactors<br>
between 10 minutes and 120 minutes.<br><br>
5.	Method as claimed in the previous claims, wherein in step (a) the<br>
separation is carried out continuously by means of a flash vaporisation, so that at<br>
least a part of the water and the light hydrocarbons and solvents are vaporised,<br>
which are collected and decanted after their condensation, and a liquid is<br>
obtained, which after cooling down, is separated into a sludge containing the<br>
metal salts, an aqueous phase with the excess reagent and the demetallized oil.<br>
6.	Method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the separation of the sludge<br>
containing the metal salts, the aqueous phase with the excess reagent and the<br>
demetallized oil is carried out by continuous centrifugation in one or two steps in<br>
series.<br>
7.	Method as claimed in the previous claims, wherein in step (b) the<br>
demetallized oil is distilled continuously at atmospheric pressure in the presence<br>
of alkaline hydroxides, so that the remains of water, light hydrocarbons and<br>
solvents are distilled, along with the ammonia released by the effect of the<br>
alkaline hydroxides.<br>
8.	Method as claimed in claim 7, wherein the distillate is subjected to<br>
condensation, followed by decanting, in such a way that an organic phase is<br>
obtained which contains light hydrocarbons and solvents and an aqueous phase<br>
which contains ammonia.<br>
9.	Method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the non-condensables of the<br>
distillate are washed with water or with an aqueous solution of an acid to keep<br>
the ammonia in aqueous solution, which is added to the aqueous phase obtained<br>
in claim 8.<br>
10.	Method as claimed in claims 7-9, wherein the atmospheric distillation is<br>
carried in a continuous way by flash vaporisation at temperatures between 200<br>
°C and 300 °C.<br><br>
11.	Method as claimed in the previous claims, wherein in step (c) the bottom<br>
liquid obtained in the atmospheric distillation of step (b) is vacuum distilled in a<br>
rectification column in a continuous way in the presence of alkaline hydroxides,<br>
preferably at a pressure between 2 mbar and 10 mbar at the top of the column<br>
and a column feed temperature between 310 °C and 335 °C, for obtaining a<br>
vacuum gas-oil or several fractions of lubricant bases as side cuts and a bottom<br>
with characteristics of fuel-oil or an asphalt component.<br>
12.	Method as claimed in the previous claims, wherein the distillations of steps<br>
(b) and (c) are carried out in tubular heat exchangers, in which the demetallized<br>
oil obtained in step (a), or the bottom liquid obtained by atmospheric distillation in<br>
step (b), circulates at high speed inside the tubes and in which the heating fluid<br>
on the outside of these tubes is a thermal oil which circulates preferably at<br>
temperatures below 300°C in the atmospheric distillation and below 385°C in the<br>
vacuum distillation.<br>
13.	Method as claimed in the previous claims, wherein the alkaline hydroxide<br>
employed in steps (b) and (c) is sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or a<br>
mixture of both, which is added preferably in a proportion of 0.5% to 5% in weight<br>
in relation to the demetallized oil, more preferably in a proportion of 0.5% to 3%,<br>
wherein said addition is carried out before the atmospheric distillation or,<br>
alternatively, said addition may be divided in two parts, one being added before<br>
the atmospheric distillation and the other being added before the vacuum<br>
distillation.<br><br>
The present invention discloses method for the regeneration of used mineral oils<br>
for obtaining lubricant bases which comprises the following steps:<br>
(a)	demetallization of the used mineral oil by means of chemical<br>
treatment of said oil with an aqueous solution of a chemical reagent such<br>
as herein described containing anions which form low solubility salts with<br>
the metals of the oil, followed by the separation of the demetallized oil;<br>
(b)	distillation of the demetallized oil obtained in step (a) at<br>
atmospheric pressure and in the presence of alkaline hydroxides; and<br>
(c)	distillation of the bottom liquid obtained in the atmospheric<br>
distillation of step (b) under vacuum and in the presence of alkaline<br>
hydroxides to obtain lubricant bases.</td>
