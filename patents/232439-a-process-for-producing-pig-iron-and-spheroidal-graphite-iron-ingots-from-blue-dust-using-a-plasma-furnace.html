				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for producing pig iron and spheroidal graphite iron ingots from blue dust uaing a plasaa furnace.<br>
Blue dust is a powdery ore which is available plentifully in India and contains irt&gt;n oxide  (Fe205) to the extent of about 989% aloqg with less than 196 of oxides like SiOp and Al2O3     The presence of sulphur (S) and phosphorus (P) which are treated as" critical impurities of iron is negligibly small in blue dust,  namely, less than 0,0696 for S and less than 0.049( for P,    Inspite of the abovementioned advantageous featxires,  blue dust is not at present directly usable for production of pig iron in a blast furxxace without its prior sintering or pelletizirig at an additional cost which makes its use uneconomic so lorjg as lumpy iron ores are available at a relatively low cost in India.<br>
There  is  therefore a need for providing an economically viable process for producing ingots of pig iron and spheroidal graphite (SG)  iron,  directly from blue dust,  without prior sintering or pelletising thereof.<br>
The object of the p:resent invention is   to provide an economically viable process for producing value-added products like pig iron and SG (spheroidal graphite) iron ingots directly from blxie dust without sintering or pelletising thereof,  in a plasma furnace constructed for the purpose.<br>
The invented process  comprises the following main steps :<br>
(a)	selection of blue dust and other Ingredients for use as raw materials;<br>
(b)	constniction of a Linde  type plasma furnace to be used;<br>
(c)	smelting of blue dust in the plasma furnace to produce pig iron ingots;  and<br>
(d)    production of SG iron  ingots from pig iron by nodularization of the graphite content of pig ircaa in magnesium vapour.<br>
The blue dust of composition as given in Table I is selected as raw material, which contains  (by weight):98.5% Fe2O3,1.05% SiO2,  0.40% AI2O3,  0.035%    S and 0.025% P.    Because of the negligibly small contents  of both S and P,  the blue dust selected is considered to be ideally suitable for producing SG iron having an allowable S content limit    of 0.14% and P content limit of 0.04%.<br>
The distribution of particle size in the selected blue dust is presented in Table II which shows that the content of fine Particles of size below 53 micron is relatively high i.e.  35.88%.<br>
The carbonaceous reductant selected for use in the process is the Dankuni char of relatively high fixed carbon content i.e.  55% by weight and low sulphur content i.e. 0.2A% by weight, which is  produced by low temperature carbonisation of coal.<br>
Besides blue dust and Dankuni char,  CaO and MgO powders are added to the charge for adjusting basicity of the slag produced during smelting of the charge in a plasma furnace.<br>
The Linde type plasma furnace constructed is capable of being operated in both 'transferred'  and  'non-transferred' modes,  although the smelting of raw materials in the process was carried out entirely in the   'transferred'  mode with a view<br>
to attaining an increased thermal efficiency of the furnace. The hearth of the plasma furnace is a magnesia-lined graphite crucible provided with a bubble alumina insulation. Two graphite electrodes are provided in vertical configuration, one above the other, for forming the plasma,between their adjacent ends inside the crucible,!.e. a matter (usually ga^) in an ionised state containing almost equal number of positive and negative charges. The remaining ends of both the electrodes are cooled by circulating water through the copper holders thereof. The upper electrode has an axial bore through which Argon gas is introduced into the arc zone inside the crucible. The lower electrode is held stationary while the upper electrode is movable In the vertical direction by means of a rack and pinion arrangement. The exhaust gases produced in the crucible are allowed to escape thi*ough an outlet provided for the purpose. The two electr<xies are connected respectively to the terminals of a dc power supply upper cne being negative and lower one positive terminal.></xies>
The charge of blue dust and Dankunl char is smelted in the plasma furnace for producing pig iron through reduction of FCgOj into Fe in presence of 25%  excess carbon ovex^ the stoichiometric requirement, following the reaction<br>
PegOj + 3C - 2Fe + 3C0. Basicity of the slag,namely, the ratio of (CaO + MgO) to (Si02 + AlgO,), is vaxied between 1 and 2, by adding CaO and MgO to the charge.<br>
The pig iron produced is converted into ingots of required sizes by casting in moulds, which are re-melted in the plasma furnace with additicm of extra carbon, magnesium alloy of iron and ccaaverted into SG iron by nodularizing the graphites present in the pig iron in presence of magnesium vapour and cast into ingots of required sizes in moulds.<br>
The invention is described fully and particularly, without restricting its scope in any manner, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which -<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional elevation of the Llnde type plasma furnace ccmstructed and used in the process; and<br>
Figure 2 is a flow diagram showing the main steps followed in the process.<br>
Referring to Pig. 1, the Linde type plasma furnace constructed for use in the invented process comprises graphite crucible 3 having magnesia lining 2; bubble alumina insulation A; M.S. casing 5; tap hole 6 for discharge of molten metal; alumina bush7ApBp.ower graphite electrode 8 with copper holder 15A:, water inlet 9A and water outlet 10A; outlet 11 for exhaust gases; graphite sleeve 12 for upper graphite electrode 13 provided with copper holder 15B, water inlet 9B and water outlet 10B, axial bore 1A for the entry of plasma forming gas 16 into the crucible, insulation 17, and rack and pinion arrangement 18 for moving the upper graphite electrode downward and upward as required; and hopper 19 for feeding the charge of raw materials into the crucible. The plasma 1 is formed inside the crucible of the furnace betwe^i the adjacent ends of the two graphite electrodes.<br>
The typical operating, parameters of the furnace are' :<br>
(i )   Plasma generating gas - Argon.<br>
(ii)   Flow rate of Plasma generating gas - 0.7 to ?.1 litre/<br>
minute.<br>
(iii)	D.C.   Power supply -  20 to 80 volts,  100-550  Amperes.<br>
(iv)	Power consumption -  upto  35 KW.<br>
(v)	Arc length of  plasma -  2-7 cm.<br>
(vi)	Temperature  Attained  -  10,000 to  15,000°C.<br>
Referring to  Fig.   2 the  main steps   followed in sequence in  the  process ares   (a)  feeding the  charge  of blue dust,  Dankuni  char and varying weight of CaO and MgO for adjusting basicity, of  the   slag  produced  into  graphite crucible of the plasma furnace   (Fig.  1.) thixsugh hopper 19;   (b) smelting the charge in the graphite    crucible at a temperature of 10,000 to  15,000°C;   (c) discharging the pig  iron through tap hole 6  of the  plasma furnace into moulds to  produce  pig  iron ingot*;   (d)  re-charging the  pig  iron ingots  into  the graphite crucible of  the  plasma furnace through hopper 19;   (e)  re-melting the pig iron ingots charged into the graphite czucSbLLe at a pjasma tamper at ure of  10,000 to  15,000°C;     (f) homogenaizirig the re-melted pig iron in the graphite     crucible with addition of a magnesium alloy of iron;   (g) discharging the melt from the graphite crucible  into moal.ds through tap hole 6;   and   (h) removing the  SG iron ingots  from the mould.<br>
Experiments   are  performed with the  composition of the charge  of blue dust Dankuni   char and vailing weight of CaO and MgO added  for  adjustment of  the  slag basicity.     A typical-composition  of  the  charge having  slag  basicity adjusted to  1.5<br>
is   presented  in  Table  III.<br>
The charge of weight 500 - 750g/2000g is fed Into the graphite crucible of the plasma furnace while keeping the adjacent ends of the upper and lower graphite electrodes 8 and 13 at a separation of less than imm inside the charge.  The plasEca forming Argon gas 16 is then allowed to flow into the graphite crucible through the bore 1A in the upper electrode 13.  An arc is struck between the adjacent ends of the two electrodes by switching on  the electric power supply to the electrodes.  The separation between the adjacent ends of the electrodes is then quickljr increased to 2 to 3 mm and kept in this state for about 2 minutes for preheating the charge materials.  The upper electrode.13 is.then slowly moved upward' by means of the rack and pinion arrangement 18 to set arc length at 2 to 7 cm.  The current flowing through the two<br>
•l««trodt«   IC   thftn iacraased   to   tlOe   Xevel   required   for   smelting<br>
the  charge materials,     Tlrie typical  conditions  for carrying out the smelting operation  are  :-<br>
(i)       Power supply   :     20-80V DC,   1OO-550A. (ii)       Arc length     :       2-7 cm. (iii)       Flow  rate of Argon gas   :     0.7 - 2 litre/minute, (iv)       plasma temperature     :     10,000 to  15,000^C.<br>
(v)      diameter of graphite  electrodes  used   :     2.5  cm. (vi)      diameter of bore  in the  upper electrode     :     5 mm,<br>
(vii)       smelting duration<br>
(a)	for charge weight 5O0-750g   ;   20 to  30 minutes.<br>
(b)	for  charge  weight   2  kg      :     60  to   70 minutes.<br>
(viii)       Power consumption     :     7 KVH per Kg  of  pig  iron<br>
produced.<br>
On  completion  of the  smelting operation,   the molten charge  is   poured  into  magnesia coated  graphite  moulds to  produce cylindrical   pig  iron ingots  of weight  200-  250g  each for charge weight of 500-750g  gud  of weight 850g  for charge weight of 2000g,<br>
Pig  iron ingots obtained  at  slag basicity varying from 1,0 to 1.8 are analysed for their chemical  composition and found  to be deficient  in their Si  content.<br>
A charge comprising  pig  iron  ingot  - A55g,   carbon (LEGO) - 23g  and   Mg  alloy containing  Fe-51%,   Si-^0%,  Mg-996 -15g  is fed  into  the same  plasma furnace and  re-melted  therein for  15 minutes  under the  remad.ning  conditions   same  as  followed for the  smelting  operation.<br>
After homogenelsing the  melt in the  furnace for 2 to  3 minutes,   10 g  of the  said   Mg  alloy  is added  to the melt in the form of lumps  of size  2-3 mm with  stirring of  the melt by means of  a graphite  rod.<br>
The  melt  is  then  qiiickly  poured  into  magnesia coated graphite  moulds   in which 5   g   of  the  Said  Mg   alloy   is   spread beforehand.     Mg vapour diffuses  throughout the  melt during solidification  of the  same  in  the moulds.     The flaky graphite present in  pig  iron is   iiiodularised by Mg vapour to  produce SG iron Ingots  of the required composition.<br>
The chemical  composition  and  percentage yield of the pig iron  ingots  produced  at different  slag basicity and the chemical  composition  of the  SG iron ingots   produced  are given in  Tables  IV  and  V respectively.<br>
From Table IV it is noted that the yield of pig iron increases from 83 to  97% with increase in the slag basicity from 1.0 to  1.8 but decreases to 88% with further increase in the slag basicity from 1.8 to 2.0,    Considering the yield and content of S and P,  the pig iron ingots produced at the slag basicity 1,5 appears to be of the optimum quality for the production of SG iron ingots.<br>
In respect of the mechanical properties,  such as, hardness,  ultimate tensile strength,  elOTigation at break and machinability also,  the SG iron  ingots produced at slag basicity 1.5 appears to be the best.<br>
The advantages of the invented process are  :-<br>
1.	The estimated cost of production of SG iron from blue dust is lower in comparision the production in the Blast furnace process.<br>
2.	The production rate is A to 6 times faster in comparison with the Blast furnace process.<br>
3.	The size of the furnace used is smaller than that of the Blast furnace of equivalent production capacity.<br>
A.      The heat loss of the furnace is less compare! with the Blast furnace.<br>
