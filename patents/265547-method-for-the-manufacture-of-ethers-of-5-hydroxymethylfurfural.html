				<td>Title: Method for the synthesis of 5-alkoxymethylfurfural ethers and<br>
their use.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation<br>
of derivatives of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), in particular ether<br>
derivatives of HMF, more in particular to 5-alkoxymethylfurfural<br>
ethers and to their application as a fuel or fuel additive.<br>
The conversion of sugars or sugar (hexoses) containing biomass<br>
into more economically useful compounds is of increasing interest.<br>
Current fuel activities are mainly directed towards ethanol from<br>
sugar/glucose. Typically, sucrose and glucose are fermented into<br>
ethanol. One glucose molecule is converted into two molecules of<br>
ethanol and two molecules of CO2. This conversion has drawbacks<br>
especially in view of atom economy, the low energy density of ethanol<br>
{7.7 kWh/kg or 6.1 kWh/L) and its relative low boiling point (78,4<br>
degrees Celsius).<br>
Another application area involves the conversion of sugars<br>
such as fructose into HMF in the presence of an acid catalyst has<br>
been reported (for example in EP0230250 to Suedzucker or EP0561928 to<br>
CEA)). In this case HMF is obtained as a highly potential starting<br>
material for obtaining bio-based monomer such as furandicarboxylic<br>
acid which can inter alia be used as an alternative to terephthalic<br>
acid as a monomer for polyethylene terephthalate type polyesters<br>
(Moreau et. al. in Topics in Catalysis Vol 27, Nos. 1-4, 2004, 11 -<br>
30 and references cited therein). When under these conditions sucrose<br>
or glucose was used as a feed, no conversion to HMF is observed<br>
(Moreau et. al. in Topics in Catalysis Vol 27, Nos. 1-4, 2004, pl3,<br>
col 2. line 2-3), which is a distinct disadvantage given the low<br>
price and abundant availability of sucrose and glucose. Only in the<br>
presence of DMSO, DMF and DMA (low HMF yields from glucose: Ishida<br>
et. al. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn 74 2001, 1145) or in a sub- and<br>
supercritical mixture of acetone and water (fructose, glucose,<br>
sucrose and inulin conversion to HMF in 77%, 48%, 56% and 78% yields<br>
respectively: Vogel et. al. Green Chemistry 5, 2003, 280) reasonable<br>
HMF yields from starting materials other than fructose were obtained.<br>
In the current market situation, fructose as feed is<br>
undesirable given the high price thereof, compared to glucose and/or<br><br>
sucrose. Therefore, so far, no process for the synthesis of HMF has<br>
been developed on an industrial scale.<br>
The synthesis chemistry and applications of HMF are reviewed<br>
extensively in Lewkowski, ARKIVOC 2001, (i) 17-54; in Gandini, Prog.<br>
 Polym. Sci. 22, 1997, 1203; in Lichtenthaler, C.R. Chimie, 7, 2004,<br>
65 and Ace. Chem. Res. 35, 2002, 728; and Moreau, Topics in<br>
Catalysis, 27, 2004, 11.<br>
DE3621517 relates to a process for the synthesis of<br>
alkoxymethylfurfurals and alkyl levulinates from cellulose or<br>
 lignocelluloses or starch and alcohols. The starting materials are<br>
heated briefly (for 1 to 60 minutes) at 170 DEG to 225 DEG C with an<br>
addition of a strong, catalytically acting acid and, if appropriate,<br>
a further, inert solvent in a pressure apparatus. Alcohols which can<br>
be employed are primary or secondary aliphatic alcohols, preferably<br>
methanol or ethanol. The strong acid used is preferably sulphuric<br>
acid at a concentration of 0.5 to 10% (based on the alcohol), if<br>
appropriate with an addition of a metal halide. Lignocellulose-based<br>
raw materials and waste substances, such as wood, wood pulp<br>
(cellulose), waste paper, cereal straw, bagasse or the like, can thus<br>
be converted into extractable and distillable organic intermediates.<br>
Similar information is provided by the inventor of this German patent<br>
reference in JOURNAL OF WOOD CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY, MARCEL DEKKER,<br>
NEW YORK, NY, US - ISSN 0277-3813, Volt 8, Nr. 1, Page(s): 121-134<br>
(1988). On the other hand, the process produces primarily alkyl<br>
levulinates; the production of HMF ethers using the sulphuric acid (a<br>
non-solid) is rather poor (the maximum yield of an HMF-ether reported<br>
in the 11 examples of DE621517 is 5.3% and 2.7% in Garves'scientific<br>
paper).<br>
DE635783 describes a process for the preparation of<br>
alkoxymethylfurfurals and alkyl levulinate esters. The acid used is<br>
gaseous hydrochloric acid, a non-solid catalyst, As is illustrated in<br>
the examples of this German patent, the product prepared from<br>
glucose, saccharose, or starch is mostly the alkyl levulinate ester<br>
(the maximum yield of EMF ether reported is 6.4%.<br>
Tyrlik et al describes the "Selective dehydration of glucose<br>
to hydroxymethylfurfural and a one-pot synthesis of a 4-<br>
acetylbutyrolactone from glucose and trioxane in solutions of<br>
aluminium salts" in CARBOHYDRATE RESEARCH, ELSEVIER SCIENTIFIC<br>
PUBLISHING COMPANY. AMSTERDAM, NL - ISSN 0008-6215, Vol: 315, Nr. 3-<br>
4, Page(s): 268-272 (1999). The acidic catalyst under the reaction<br><br>
conditions illustrated in this article is a homogeneous catalyst. The<br>
yield of the alkoxymethylfurfural is rather poor (the maximum yield<br>
of HMF + HMF-ether combined is 14%.<br>
Moye et al describes the "Reaction of ketohexoses with acid<br>
in certain non-aqueous sugar solvents" in JOURNAL OF APPLIED<br>
CHEMISTRY, SOCIETY OF CHEMICAL INDUSTRY. LONDON, GB, Vol: 16, Nr. 7,<br>
Page(s): 206-208 (1966). HMF is made using various acidic catalysts<br>
from fructose, sorbose, kestose and inulin (a group of polysaccharides<br>
based on fructose with a terminal glucose group). No experiments were<br>
done with glucose. The HMF yields reported from fructose (Table I)<br>
appear high, but do no concern isolated HMF, but rather calculated<br>
values on the basis of UV analysis. The yield of the ethers of 5-<br>
hydroxymethylfurfural is unknown, given the indication that the<br>
furfuryl alcohols were very unstable to acid and readily polymerised<br>
at room temperature, it is thus rather evident that the yield of such<br>
ethers is rather insignificant.<br>
In the paper by Tarabanko et al, on the "Preparation of butyl<br>
levulinate by the acid-catalyzed conversion of sucrose in the<br>
presence o butanol", published in "Khimiya Rastitel'nogo Syrya<br>
(2004), (2), 31-37, the pulse-flow process of the acid-catalyzed<br>
conversion of sucrose in the two-phase water-butanol system is<br>
studied. 5-HMF and levulinic acid were obtained as the main products,<br>
using a solution of sulphuric acid and sodium hydrosulfate as<br>
catalyst. The conversion of glucose into an alkoxymethylfurfural is<br>
not disclosed. A similar conclusion my be drawn on the second article<br>
by the same author: "Catalyzed carbohydrate dehydration in the<br>
presence of butanol at moderate temperatures", published in "Khimiya<br>
Rastitel'nogo Syrya (2002), (2),5-15<br>
RU2203279 relates to the synthesis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural<br>
ethers from sucrose. The end product is synthesized by dehydration of<br>
sucrose or fructose in a biphasic system in the presence of sodium<br>
bisulfite or mixture of sodium bisulfite and sulfuric acid as<br>
catalyst and aliphatic alcohols as alkylating agent under normal<br>
pressure. In a biphasic system, these catalysts are homogeneous.<br>
Another distinguishing feature of this process is the use of sucrose<br>
or fructose as the parent reagent.<br>
Finally, WO9967409 relates to a "METHOD OF TREATING BIOMASS<br>
MATERIAL" wherein hemicellulosic and cellulosic components in biomass<br>
material are hydrolyzed in a single-stage digester by using a dilute<br>
mineral acid such as sulfuric acid or nitric acid, at a temperature<br><br>
above 200 DEG C and a residence time of less than ten minutes. The<br>
hemicellulosic components are converted to monosaccharides selected<br>
from the group consisting of pentoses and hexoses and the cellulosic<br>
components are converted to glucose. In addition, organic acids,<br>
furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, acid-soluble lignin, levulinic<br>
acid and other products are produced. The acid used is sulphuric acid<br>
or nitric acid, as a dilute aqueous solution, i.e., a homogeneous<br>
catalyst. The product stream is one of C6 and C5 sugars combined with<br>
furfural, HMF, levulinic acid, ASL and other extracted organics. The<br>
preparation of alkoxy ethers of HMF is not disclosed.<br>
Concluding, the current methods for the synthesis of HMF<br>
mostly start from fructose and typically do not give high yield,<br>
partly attributable to the instability of HMF under the acidic<br>
reaction conditions. In most acid-catalysed water-based reactions,<br>
the further reaction to levulinic acid and hurnins has been reported,<br>
making this a less attractive alternative.<br>
The present inventors have set out to overcome these<br>
disadvantages.<br>
Surprisingly, the inventors have found that the conversion of<br>
hexose-containing starting material, in particular fructose and/or<br>
glucose -containing starting material and more particular glucose-<br>
containing material that may be derived from biomass in the presence<br>
of a catalytic or sub-stoechiometric amount of acid in the presence<br>
of an alcohol with or without the presence of one or more additional<br>
diluents leads to the formation of the corresponding HMF-ether in<br>
good yield and selectivity.<br>
Thus, the invention pertains to a method for the manufacture<br>
of 5-alkoxymethylfurfural ethers by reacting a fructose and/or<br>
glucose-containing starting material with an alcohol in the presence<br>
of a catalytic or sub-stoechiometric amount of acid catalyst.<br>
It was found that this in situ formation and derivatisation of<br>
HMF prevents the occurrence of the onward and undesired reaction<br>
towards the above-mentioned levulinic acid and humins, thus leading<br>
to an efficient procedure for the conversion of fructose and/or<br>
glucose -containing material into HMF derivatives.<br>
The energy density of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), the ether<br>
resulting from reaction of HMF with (bio)ethanol, can be calculated.<br>
Taking into account stoeichiometry and a calculated enthalpy of<br>
formation using increment tables of 502.32 kJ/mole, the reaction<br>
enthalpy can be calculated as 3854.76 kJ/mol, leading to an energy<br><br>
density of 7.0 kWh/kg or 8.7 kWh/L. This is as good as regular<br>
gasoline (12.7 kWh/kg, 8.8 kWh/L) and diesel ((11.7 kWh/kg, 9.7<br>
kWh/L) and significantly higher than ethanol (7.7 kWh/kg, 6.1 kWh/L).<br>
This high energy density of EMF, the fact that these HMF derivatives<br>
can now be obtained in high yields, in one step, from very cheap<br>
hexose or hexose-containing starting materials such as sucrose and<br>
glucose, and as these ethers are, in contrast to HMF, liquids at room<br>
temperature, make these very interesting fuels or fuel additives.<br>
In certain embodiments, the alcohol is selected from the group<br>
consisting of primary (un)branched aliphatic alcohols. In certain<br>
preferred embodiments, the alcohol is selected from the group<br>
consisting of primary C1-C5 (un)branched aliphatic alcohols,<br>
preferably methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-hydroxymethyl-propanol,<br>
1-butanol. More preferable are methanol and/or ethanol. The resulting<br>
(m)ethyl ether ((m)ethoxymethylfurfural, MMF or EMF) has a high<br>
energy content and may directly be used as a fuel additive as an<br>
alternative for MTBE or as a fuel. Mixtures of alcohols may also be<br>
employed. Ethanol is the most preferred alcohol in the method of the<br>
present invention as the ethanol that is used can also be derived<br>
from bioinass or glucose-containing material (bio-ethanol) .<br>
The acid catalyst in the method of the present invention can<br>
be selected from amongst solid (halogenated) organic acids, inorganic<br>
acids, salts, Lewis acids, ion exchange resins and zeolites or<br>
combinations and/or mixtures thereof, including combinations and/or<br>
mixtures thereof with a homogenous catalyst. The expression "solid"<br>
is here used in the ordinary meaning of the word as being solid<br>
during the reaction. Another common expression for solid catalysts is<br>
"heterogeneous" catalyst. The acid may be a protonic, BrΦmst'ed or,<br>
alternatively, a Lewis acid. In certain embodiment, the acid may be<br>
organic or inorganic. In certain embodiments, the organic acid can be<br>
selected from amongst oxalic acid, levulinic acid, maleic acid or<br>
para-toluenesulphonic acid. In certain embodiments, the inorganic<br>
acid can be selected from amongst phosphoric: acid, sulphuric acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, hydroiodic acid,<br>
optionally generated in situ. In certain embodiments, the inorganic<br>
acid is selected form the group of sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, nitric acid. In certain embodiments, the salt can<br>
be one of (NH4)2SO4/SO3, ammonium phosphate, triethylamine phosphate,<br>
pyridinium salts, pyridinium phosphate, pyridinium<br>
hydrochloride/hydrobromide/perbromate, DMAP, aluminium salts, Th and<br><br>
Zr ions, zirconium phosphate, Cr-, A1-, Ti-, Ca-, In-ions, ZrOC12,<br>
VO(SO4)2, TiO2, V-porphyrine, Zr-, Cr-, Ti-porphyrine. In certain<br>
embodiments, the Lewis acid can be one of ZnCL2, A1Cl3, BF3. In<br>
certain embodiments, the ion exchange resins can be one of Amberlite,<br>
Diaion, levatit. In certain embodiments, it is preferred that the<br>
acid catalyst is a solid catalyst that may be selected form the group<br>
consisting of acid resins, natural clay mineral, zeolites, supported<br>
acids such as silica impregnated with mineral acids, heat treated<br>
charcoal, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal salts and mixed oxides<br>
and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, mixtures or<br>
combinations of acid catalysts can be used.<br>
The temperature at which the reaction is performed may vary,<br>
but in general it is preferred that the reaction is carried out at a<br>
temperature from 50 to 300 degrees Celsius, preferably from 125 to<br>
250, more preferably from 175 to 225 degrees Celsius. In general,<br>
temperatures higher than 300 are less preferred as the selectivity of<br>
the reaction as many by-products occur, inter alia caramelisation of<br>
the sugar. Performing the reaction below the lowest temperature is<br>
also less preferable because of the slow reaction speed.<br>
The fructose and/or glucose-containing starting material can<br>
be selected from a wide variety of feeds. In general any feed with a<br>
sufficient high fructose or glucose content can be used. It is<br>
preferred that the fructose and/or glucose -containing starting<br>
material is selected from the group of starch, amylose, galactose,<br>
cellulose, hemi-cellulose, glucose-containing disaccharides such as<br>
sucrose, maltose, cellobiose, lactose, preferably glucose-containing<br>
disaccharides, more preferably sucrose or glucose.<br>
The catalyst can be added to the reaction mixture in an amount<br>
varying from 0.01 to 40 mole % drawn on the fructose or glucose<br>
content of the fructose and/or glucose -containing starting material'<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 30 mole %, more preferably from 1 to 20 mole<br>
%.	■<br>
In certain embodiments, one or more solvents or diluents may<br>
be added, in general to aid the dissolution of the glucose containing<br>
material or as a diluent. The solvent may be selected form the group<br>
consisting of water, sulfoxides, preferably DMSO, ketones, preferably<br>
methyl ethylketone, methylisobutylketone and acetone or mixtures of<br>
two or more of the above solvents.<br>
In certain embodiments, the ratio of alcohol/solvent is from<br>
50 to 0.1, preferably from 20 to 1, more preferably from 10 to 2.<br><br>
Higher amounts of alcohol may have the result that the<br>
reaction is too slow due to the limited solubility (hence<br>
availability of the starting material), whereas too much solvent in<br>
the system may lead to a too high dilution, which in both cases are<br>
less preferred results. One of the possible solvents is water.<br>
In certain embodiments, the method can be performed in a<br>
continuous flow process. In such method, the residence time of the<br>
reactants in the flow process is between 0.1 second and 10 hours,<br>
preferably from 1 second to 5 hours, more preferably from 1 minute to<br>
1 hour.<br>
In certain embodiments the continuous flow process is a fixed<br>
bed continuous flow process or a reactive (catalytic) distillation<br>
process with preferably a solid ("heterogeneous") acid catalyst. To<br>
initiate or regenerate the heterogeneous acid catalyst or to improve<br>
performance, an inorganic or organic acid may be added to the feed of<br>
the fixed bed or reactive distillation continuous flow process. In a<br>
fixed bed process, the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) can be<br>
from 1 to 1000, preferably from 5 to 500, more preferably from 10 to<br>
250 and most preferably from 25 to 100.<br>
As explained above, the application of the products of the<br>
method of the present invention, i.e. the ethers, is in the use as a<br>
fuel or fuel additive and as precursor for the manufacture of 2,5-<br>
di(hydroxymethyl)furan, furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid, 2-<br>
hydroxymethylfuran-5-carboxylic acid, 2,5-<br>
(dihydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran, which can be used as monomers in a<br>
polymerisation process, optionally after conversion of the diol to a<br>
diamine. See for a review Moreau, Topics in catalysis, 2004, 27, 11-<br>

Examples<br>
Apparatus<br>
Continuous parallel flow reactor system consisting of four quartz<br>
reactors inserted in a silver heating block; temperature and flow<br>
regulators and three HPLC pumps. Two of the pumps deliver the liquid<br>
to the reactors and third one is employed to dilute the reaction<br>
products prior to collection.<br>
Analytical Method<br>
The reaction products were quantified with the aid of HPLC-analysis<br>
with an internal standard (saccharine, Sigma Aldrich). A Merck-<br>
Hitachi L7000 chromatograph, equipped UV and RI detectors, was used.<br>
Stationary phase were reverse phase C18 (Sunfire 3.5 pm, 4.6x100mm,<br>
Waters) and cation exchange (SupelcogelH, 4.6x300mm/ SigmaAldrich)<br>
columns connected in series. A gradient elution at a constant flow<br>
0.6 ml/min and temperature 60°C was used according to the following<br>
scheme.<br><br>
General Procedure<br>
A 1.25 wt% solution of glucose (99-7 % Sigma Aldrich) in water or<br>
88.7 % ethanol was flowed through a fixed bed (200 μl) of a solid<br>
("heterogeneous") catalyst at 180 °C. Flow rates were chosen such to<br>
achieve a space velocity 0.25 or 0.5 min"1, i.e. contact time 2 or 4<br>
min. Liquid coming out of the reactors was diluted by a mixture of<br>
water and ethanol (50:50) to prevent tubing blockages.<br>

4% at very low conversion. Mordenite presented both reduced activity<br>
and selectivity to furan derivatives.<br>
HMF was a main furan found in the reaction mixture.<br>
Reactions in ethanol.<br>
With the use of Zeolite beta about 4 % selectivity to HMF and EMF was<br>
achieved at 17% conversion at a low space velocity. For the other<br>
catalysts tested, the conversion developed initially to more than 20%<br>
and the selectivity was in the range between 1 and 3 %.<br>
The predominant furan derivative was the desired EMF.<br><br><br>
In a small-scale model diesel engine, comparative testing is<br>
performed with normal commercial diesel as a fuel and the same<br>
commercial diesel to which samples of 1 wt.%, 2 wt.%, 3 wt.%, 5 wt%,<br>
and 10 wt.% HMF or EMF are added, respectively. The diesel samples<br>
with HMF are less homogenous on visual inspection (solid particles<br>
remain visible, flocculation) and above 5 wt.% HMF, a solid deposit<br>
is sometimes observed. EMF is added as a liquid and does not yield<br>
any mixing or flocculation problems. The engine is run stationary<br>
with a set volume (100 mL) of fuel until empty. HMF containing fuels<br>
run less regular, whereas EMF containing fuels run at a regular pace<br>
and for a longer period (up to 15%). On visual inspection of the<br>
engine, EMF provides less visual contamination.<br><br>
