The invention relates to spiro2H-1 -benzopyran-2,4'-piperidine] derivatives, to phamnaceutical compositions containing the same, as well as to the use of these spiro[2H-1-benzopyran-2,4'-piperidine] derivatives in therapy.<br>
The simplest a-amino acid glycine has a number of important roles in the mammaifan central nervous system (CNS). Along with y-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it is a major post-synaptic inhibitory transmitter in the spinal cord and brainstem, acting through [igand gated ion channels. Interaction of glycine with these receptors can be antagonized by the alkaloid strychnine. These receptors are therefore referred to as 'strychnine sensitive' glycine receptors. Glycinergic neurotransmission is important in the processing and control of visual, auditory and motor signalling. Glycine is also an obligatory co-agonist along with glutamate at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Glycine therefore functions in excitatory transmission by modulating the actions of glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. In addition the amino acid plays a role in the metabolism of peptides and proteins, including the exchange of one-carbon units.<br>
Control of the availability of glycine for any of the above processes will potentially influence their function and provide means of treating a number of diseases and conditions. Apart from metabolism, one of the major processes controlling the concentrations of free glycine in the proximity of strychnine-sensitive and strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors is the functioning of selective high affinity glycine transporters. These proteins can actively limit the spread of glycine beyond the immediate environs of receptors, thus maintaining both spatial and temporal fidelity of receptor activation. Rapid sequestering of transmitter into neuronal or glial cells via the transporter will also conserve glycine for future release.<br>
Glycine transporters have been doned to reveal two major classes, GlyT-1 and GlyT-2. GlyT-1 is expressed throughout the brain with higher mRNA levels being detected in caudal areas and cellular localisation being predominantly glial.<br><br>
Three isoforms of GlyT-1, la, 1b and 1c, arising from differential splicing and exon usage have been identified by Kim et al. (Molecular Phaim. 1994, 45, 608-617), The doning and expression of a further human isofomn GlyT-ld was recently disclosed in European Patent Application EP 951543 (Allelix Neuroscience, inc.).<br>
GlyT-2 distribution, as indicated by immunochemistry studies, corresponds closely to that of inhibitory 'strychnine sensitive' glycine receptors, particulariy in the spinal cord.<br>
By regulating the synaptic levels of glycine, the glycine transporters GlyT-1 and GlyT-2 are expected to selectively influence the activity at NMDA receptors and at strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, respectively.<br>
Compounds which alter the functional activity of glycine transporters may therefore result in changes in tissue glycine levels which can be useful in the treatment of a number of disease states. Such disease states include those associated with decreased or exaggerated function of NMDA receptors, namely psychosis, depression, dementia and other forms of impaired cognition, such as attention deficit disorders. NMDA receptors have further been implicated in conditions arising from neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration such as, for example, stroke (head trauma), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Enhanced inhibitory glycinergic transmission resulting from inhibition of GlyT-2 or GIyT-1 activity may be useful in the treatment of muscle hyperactivity associated with spasticity, myoclonus and epilepsy. Compounds elevating spinal glycine may also possess analgesic properties.<br>
Compounds that inhibit glycine transport via the Gly-TI or GIy-T2 transporters are disclosed in WO 97/45115 (TROPHIX PHARM. INC.). in WO 97/45423 (TROPHIX PHARM. INC.). in WO 99/34790 (ALLELIX NEUROSCIENCE INC.) and in WO 00/07978 (AK20 NOBEL N.V.) as compounds useful in the treatment of the neurological and neuropsychiatric disonders discussed above. There exists a need for additional compounds suitable for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders, especially for compounds having a selective pharmacological profile.<br><br><br><br>

To a stirred solution of 7-methoxy-A/-methylspiro[2H-1-benzopyran-2,4*-piperidine]-4(3H}-one (6.19 g, 23.72 mmol), in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (80 cm2) under an atmosphere of anhydrous nitrogen was added drop-wise a solution of phenylmagnesium bromide in tetrahydrofuran (40 cm2, 1.0 M, 40 mmol) maintaining the reaction temperature below 30 C. When the addition was complete the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 2.5 h at which time the reaction was incomplete but no Grignard reagent was present. A further portion of phenylmagnesium bromide (13.3 cm2) was carefully added to the reaction and it was allowed to stir overnight. Water (30 cm2) was added followed by saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (30 cm2). The volatiies were removed in vacuo before the resulting material was treated with diethyl ether (100 cm2) and water (100 cm2). The organic layer was separated before the aqueous portion was extracted further with diethyl ether (2 x 100 cm2). The combined extracts were washed with water (3 x 100 cm2), dried over sodium sulfate and the ether was removed in vacuo. The residue was triturated with a little diethyl ether and the resulting crystals were isolated by vacuum filtration (4.57 g. 12.15 mmol, 51 %). This solid was then taken up into ethyl alcohol (75 cm2) and treated with hydrochloric acid (75 cm2, 2 N) before being heated to reflux for 1.5 h. The solution was concentrated under reduced pressure until a solid began to crystallise. The mixture was then cooled and the solid was isolated by vacuum filtration. This was then treated with a mixture of water (300 cm2), saturated aqueous potassium bicarbonate solution (50 cm2) and diethyl ether (650 cm2) and shaken. The aqueous layer was separated and extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 100 cm2) before the combined extracts were washed with water (3 x 250 cnr), dried over sodium sulfate and the volatiies were removed in vacuo to afford the title compound (3.91 g, 12.18 mmol, 51 % from ketone).<br><br>

The reaction mixture was heated to reflux overnight and a further portion of 1-chloroethyl chioroformate (0.8 cm2. 7.4 mmol) was added before it was heated to reflux for a further 24 h. Upon cooling, the reactbn mixture was filtered through cotton wool which was subsequently washed with dichloro-methane (50 cm2) and the volatiles were removed in vacuo. The resulting intermediate was treated with methyl alcohol (200 cm2) and the mixture was heated to reflux overnight. Upon cooiing, the voiatiies where removed In vacuo before the resulting solid was dissolved in a mixture of dichloromethane (150 cm2) and aqueous sodium carbonate solution (5 %, 30 cm2). The organic layer was separated, washed with water (2 x 50 cm2), dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent was removed in vacuo to afford the title compound as a gum (3.93 g).<br>

The resulting mixture was poured into water (600 cm2) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 X 150 cm2). The combined organic extracts were washed with water (3 x 300 cm3 dried over sodium sulfate and the volatiles were removed in vacuo. This cmde product was purified by column chromatography (silica, eluting with dichloromethane-ethyl acetate-9:1 through to 4:1) resulting in the pure ethyl ester (3.51 g, 71 %).<br><br>
step E: a mixture of ethyl 7-methoxy-4-phenylspiro[2H-1-benzopyran-2,4'-piperidine]-1'-acetate (3.38 g, 8.60 mmol), ethyl alcohol (250 cm2) and aqueous lithium hydroxide solution (2 N, 6.44 cm2 12.88 mmol) was heated to reflux for 3.5 h. Upon cooling, the mixture was treated with hydrochloric acid (5 N, 70 cm2) and some of the ethyl alcohol was removed until precipitation began.
