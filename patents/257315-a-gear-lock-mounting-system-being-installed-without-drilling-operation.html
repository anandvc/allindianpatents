				<td>A GEAR LOCK MOUNTING SYSTEM BEING INSTALLED WITHOUT DRILLING OPERATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a gear lock mounting system being installed without drilling operation on the chassis of vehicle. More particularly, the said gear lock system is easy to install and prohibit the lose of chassis fitting means. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
It is known that the main purpose of gear lock mounting assembly is to restrict the movement of gear shift lever when the vehicle is not in motion.<br>
Conventional gear lock mounting system are mounted by drilling the chassis of the vehicle, wherein holes are drilled in the chassis for installing the gear lock mounting assembly. Since, the holes are drilled in the chassis; the said holes remain permanently in the chassis of the vehicle, even in the circumstances, when it is removed for maintenance. As the said holes are exposed during maintenance, the edges of the said holes become active sites for corrosion.<br>
Due to such drilling in chassis, the body of the vehicle starts to erode at the sites of holes and thereby weaken the chassis body. In addition to this, it is noted that drilling of chassis is not desired due various practical business reasons. More specifically, if fitment of any part in the vehicle tampers/modifies some other part, supplied by different company, it may result in the loss of manufacturers warranty .Hence, it is always necessary for practical reasons, that automobile parts must not be altered during the fitment of other parts which require operations like machining etc.<br>
Further, it is also necessary that part/component should be developed in such a way that it can be mounted with ease and assembly of the component is secured enclosed in such manner that it can't be detached or tampered or stolen.<br>
Further at various instances, it has been found that the gear lock system are taken away by dismantling the gear lock mounting system. This is due to the reason that in the conventional gear lock assembly, the fixing means which is used to fix the assembly are easily accessibly and any even an non skilled person can easily remove fixing means and can remove the entire gear lock system.<br>
Therefore, in above said circumstances, the entire purpose of installing gear lock mounting system is defeated. Therefore, it is found that conventional gear lock mounting system is irrational to certain extent and due to one or more of the aforesaid reasons, there may arise a situation wherein the gear lock mechanism could fail to function.<br>
Hence, there exists a grave need to provide a gear lock mounting system which can be mounted without drilling of the chassis and ensures safety of the vehicle.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING GEAR-LOCK:<br>
The most easily available existing gear lock kit contains following components:<br>
•	Gear lock<br>
•	A metal plate with certain holes in it, in association with gear lock.<br>
•	Gear lock pin stand<br>
•	Gear lock pin<br>
•	Gear lock fitting hardware<br>
•	Rectangular rubber washer.<br>
Generally the metal plate associated with gear lock has five holes in it - four holes for fitting this plate around the gear and one central hole for the gear to pass-through it.<br>
Some existing locks use plastic moldings; some locks contain single gear lock pin and others have double pins - but main fact is that all these gear-locks use gear lock fitting hardware, which require drilling on the chassis of vehicle for fixing the lock.<br>
The main steps of installation process of the existing gear lock in Hyundai Santro-Xing motor car are as followed:<br>
(i)        The gear-lever knob is removed first.<br>
(ii) The console screws (total five in number) are removed, which are located on front and rare of the console.<br>
(iii) The plastic cup on the center of the console is removed and the console screws fitted under the cup are also removed.<br>
(iv)      Then the console is removed.<br>
(v) The central hole of the metal plate of gear lock is positioned above the hole for gear, on the chassis and four 10 mm holes are marked for drilling on the chassis.<br>
(vi)      Holes are drilled on the chassis, around gear lever.<br>
(vii) The metal plate with gear lock is properly positioned above the holes and it is tightened with sets of washers and plane nut-bolts having unbreakable nut-heads, from the outside of the chassis (underneath the vehicle).<br>
(viii) A rectangular hole is marked on the console (with the template provided) for the gear lock to come out of the console after the fitment.<br>
(ix)      Console is re-fitted and a rectangular washer is put on the gear lock.<br>
(x)       The gear lever knob is retightened.<br>
Finally the gear lock pin stand is fixed on the console with two skews.<br>
Drawbacks of Conventional gear lock and its installation process:<br>
(i) The existing or conventional gear lock system needs drilling of chassis for its installation. Here some holes are drilled on the chassis of the vehicle and the gear-lock assembly is fixed with the help of nut-bolts having self-breakable heads.<br>
(ii) In case of presently available gear-lock system, the installation process is of permanent type.<br>
(iii) The conventional gear lock installation process is a time taking lengthy process, which requires as expert mechanic and therefore sometimes costly too.<br>
(iv) The drilling of chassis affects the serviceability of the vehicle and the vehicle-owner looses its warranty validation.<br>
(v) In case the gear-lock system is removed from the vehicle's chassis, four holes remain permanently open, which become troublesome during rain for the vehicle user.<br>
(vi)      These holes become active sites for corrosion too.<br>
Summary of the proposed Gear Lock system - its structural features, special design, the new installation process of the lock; detailed description of the invention including the details of illustrative figures attached with the specification; difference between Gear Lock system and conventional gear locks on the basis of their features; claims for patent protection / all these are substantially written in following write-up. <br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a gear lock mounting system which can be installed in the vehicle without any drilling.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a tamper resistant gear lock mounting system.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a method of mounting and dismounting the gear lock mounting system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present is a complete solution for locking the gear shift lever of the vehicle to ensure vehicle's security. This gear lock mounting system has components like the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket, L-shaped Locking Segment, small pin , long pin , the Main Lock assembly and the Customized key. The Main Lock-Mounting Bracket has four sections, all metallic plates, and due to their mutual perpendicular positions the Main Lock-Mounting Plate looks like an armless chair (see the figures 2, 6 and 11). The horizontal base plate of this bracket has matching locking holes, which come above the inbuilt rear end studs (bolts) of the vehicle, around the gear shift lever. Three plates / horizontal base plate, first vertical plate and upper horizontal plate, create a space where the Special Nuts, tightened with the inbuilt studs, and above them the L-shaped Locking Segment get accommodated. The L-shaped Locking segment, itself being mounted at the lower surface of the upper horizontal plate of the Main Lock- Mounting Plate, covers the Special Nuts and thus protects the Main Lock-Mounting Plate. In the L-shaped region between the upper horizontal plate and the second vertical plate, the Main Lock assembly is mounted with the second vertical plate using small pin and thus the Main Lock Assembly firmly hides the screws fixing the L-shaped protective Locking segment to the upper horizontal plate. The long pin , operated (locked/ unlocked) by the special customized key, holds the gear shift lever in its reversed position and thus stops gear's movements. This whole assembly always remains inside the console around the gear shift lever and thus seems like a Gear Lock. Due to its special design, shape of components, the size of the complete lock assembly and the customized key; each   component  of the  proposed  Gear  Lock   mounting  system  assures<br>
protection for the other associated component and makes this system a safest gear lock system. The present Gear Lock can be designed for vehicles of Indian style as well as for any style of vehicles (including the European style of vehicles). At the same time the proposed lock system can be made to lock the gear shift lever in its normal (neutral) position too. <br>

It offers a special type of key - dimple key, where duplicity is not  possible.  This  present invention  has  an  advantage of providing the<br>
flexibility to the user - to remove the gear lock at any instant of time without creating any adverse effect unlike in case of conventional gear lock systems.<br>
3.1. DESCRIPTION OF GEAR LOCK MOUNTING SYSTEM<br>
The proposed Gear Lock Mounting system is a unique and very compact assembly of following components:<br>
(a)	Main Lock-Mounting Bracket<br>
(b)	L-shaped protective Locking Bracket<br>
(c)	Main Lock assembly<br>
(d)	A short and a long pin 1<br>
(e)	fitting means<br>
(f)	Special Nuts<br>
(g)	Key<br>
(a) Main Lock-Mounting Bracket: Actually it is the core component of the Gear Lock Mounting System. It is a molded metal plate (generally steel or plastic), and its shape can be considered as a chair consisting of a seat, a backrest, an extra large base (in the form of a metallic surface) and no arm. Various portions of the Main Lock- Mounting Bracket can be divided in four sections:<br>
(i) First base portion (Horizontal base plate): This plate has certain holes, preferably two in numbers, and a projection for accommodating the gear shift lever. The holes are exactly matching to the inbuilt studs around the gear shift lever, so that the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket can seat above these studs. This horizontal base-plate of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket is placed exactly above the inbuilt studs (preferably on the rear end studs) and thus the    Gear Lock is fixed using special nuts. This<br>
horizontal base plate has certain cavities/space provided in the hole of the horizontal base plate of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket in which Special Nuts are applied.<br>
(ii) First extended portion (First vertical plate): This provision in the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket is to accommodate the L-shaped Locking Segment beneath the upper horizontal plate.<br>
(iii) Second base portion (Upper horizontal plate) This plate is also a part of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket. Its surface area is almost equal to the surface area of the biggest surface of Main Lock Asy (that is, area of Upper horizontal plate = length x width of Main Lock Asy). It also has certain holes (preferably three) for fixing &amp; holding L-shaped Locking Segment beneath it.<br>
(iv)Second extended portion : This fourth portion of the Main Lock-Mounting racket is an upper vertical plate, which makes 90° angle with the upper horizontal plate. Along with upper horizontal plate, it creates a depression in the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket where the Main Lock assembly gets properly accommodated. Not only this, the second extended or vertical plate is provided with certain holes for placing a short pin to fix Main Lock assembly with this plate and for inserting/operating the a long pin, which passes through the Main Lock assembly.<br>
Therefore due to its special design the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket creates two cavities/ positions / one above the upper horizontal plate and another below this plate. In these two cavities/positions the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket properly accommodates the Main Lock Asy and the L-shaped Locking Segment above and below its upper horizontal plate respectively. This novel design of the Main Lock- Mounting Bracket makes the Gear Lock system so compact that it remains covered and hidden inside the console of the gear shift lever of the vehicle.<br>
(b)	L-shaped protective Locking Segment : It is a metallic component<br>
(preferably of metal or tough plastic) of Gear Lock, which makes those bolts<br>
unreachable that fix the Main Lock- Mounting Bracket. This segment is three<br>
dimensional, though it has two hands. Each of the two hands of the L-shaped<br>
Locking Segment has two surfaces at 90°. One hand is to be tightened firmly at<br>
the lower surface of the second base portion of the Main Lock mounting Bracket.<br>
Other hand, with the help of its two surfaces at 90°, completely covers the nuts<br>
fitted with bolts, which tightly fix the horizontal base plate of the Main Lock<br>
' Mounting Bracket to die chassis of the vehicle. Thus, due to presence of L-shaped protective Locking Segment, removal of these nuts, tightened on the bolts, becomes impossible.<br>
(c)	Main Lock Assembly: This is that component of the Gear Lock, which is operated by the user after the installation of the lock mounting assembly. It is a cuboidal shaped metallic box, which comprises of lock-key system and the Pin Large and is used to lock the Pin Large (gear shift lever locking pin) so that the pin cannot be removed without the key. A customized dimple shaped key has to be inserted at the space provided in the Main Lock Asy to remove the Pin Large. The Main Lock Assembly is specially designed to fix it on the second extended or vertical plate of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket with the help of a short pin . The shape and size of the Main Lock Assembly is designed in such a manner that it perfectly gets accommodated on the rectangular depression created by second vertical plate and upper horizontal plate of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket. Thus	the	Main	Lock	Assembly does not require any separate space and it also remains inside the console of the gear shift lever. It has one large hole through which the Pin Large passes and is locked/unlocked using its key.<br>
(d)	A small pin: It is a small and thick nut like structure. The length of small pin is in the range of 2 mm to 10 mm. It is used to mount the Main Lock Assembly on the second vertical plate of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket. The position of this<br>
small pin in a properly installed Gear Lock system is such that it always remains hidden and away from any stranger, until the system is unlocked using it key, Pin Large is removed, position of gear shift lever is changed and then the console is removed.<br>
(e)	A long pin: It is a long, smooth, thick and very hard pin, made up of very<br>
strong alloy (i.e. copper-nickel-chrome plated). The length of long pin is from 5<br>
mm to 30mm. It is pointed at one end and its other end is blunt. It is used to stop<br>
the movement of the gear shift lever (in reverse gear) when locked in the Main<br>
Lock Assembly.<br>
(f)	Special Nuts: When the horizontal base plate of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket is placed above two rear end inbuilt studs of the gear shift lever, almost total length of the studs gets covered under the thickness of the horizontal base plate. Therefore to tighten the horizontal base plate with the vehicle's chassis, certain Special Nuts are used. The Special Nut occupies the cavity/space provided in the hole of the horizontal base plate of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket. The upper portion of these nuts get covered and protected by the L-shaped Locking Segment, fixed above the horizontal base plate.<br>
(g)	Key: The Main Lock Asy has a provision of a dimple key for locking and unlocking it.<br>
3.2. New Process of Installation of Gear Lock<br>
Due to unique components like Main Lock-Mounting Bracket, L-shaped Locking Segment, Main Lock Asy, Pin Small, Pin Large, Special Nuts and special designs of these components, process of installation of the new proposed Gear Lock mounting system becomes very easy and matchless. Following steps are involved in the installation of Gear Lock Mounting system around the gear:<br>
Step (1): The console is removed by unscrewing all the screws.<br>
Step (2): Four nuts present over the plastic housing are unscrewed and the gear shift lever assembly along with the metal plate beneath it are removed.<br>
Step (3): The Main Lock-mounting Bracket of the proposed gear Lock system is placed over the 2 nos. studs (two rear end studs) of the vehicle.<br>
Step (4): The metal plate and the gear shift lever assembly are placed over the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket of the proposed Gear Lock. Then all three / Main Lock-Mounting Bracket, the metal plate and the gear shift lever assembly / are assembled above the studs (bolts) and fixed loosely by using two vehicle nuts on the front end studs and on the rear studs, the Special Nuts supplied along with the Gear Lock kit.<br>
Step (5): The Main Lock Asy is installed on the second vertical plate of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket, using the small pin . Then the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket is adjusted at its position in such a manner that the locking pin (Pin Large) of the Main Lock Asy touches the gear shift lever (preferably in its reversed position).<br>
Step (6): All the four nuts/ two vehicle nuts at front-end studs (bolts) and two Special Nuts at rear end studs (bolts), are tightened.<br>
Step (7): Again the Main Lock Asy is uninstalled, so that the L-shaped Locking Segment can be fixed with the upper horizontal plate of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket.<br>
Step (8): The L-shaped locking segment is assembled in the space below the upper horizontal plate of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket and above the Special Nuts, holding the Horizontal base-plate of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket. Finally it is fixed at the lower surface of the upper horizontal plate using certain screws (preferably three in numbers), supplied along with the gear Lock kit.<br>
Step (9): The Main Lock Asy is reinstalled at its original position.<br>
Step (10): In the console, holes are made for locking-pin entry (i.e. of Pin Large) and for the entry of key, as per the template supplied along with the kit.<br>
Step (11): Finally the console is installed and all the screws arc tightened.<br>
Step (12): The Pin-stand (for placing the Pin Large) is mounted on the console using two screws.<br>
Above mentioned steps of installation of new and advanced Gear Lock Mounting<br>
system can be performed in about 10 minute duration. In this installation of gear<br>
lock no drilling on the vehicle's body is done and same inbuilt studs (bolts) are<br>
used, provided by company for holding and fixing the gear-lever. The Main Lock-<br>
Mounting Bracket mounts the Gear Lock Mounting system around gear. The<br>
Main Lock-Assembly is properly mounted and locked on the mounting bracket<br>
and it can't be removed without the own key of the lock. Mounting a thick<br>
metallic cover, that is, the L-shaped protective Locking-Segment, above two<br>
Special Nuts, holding the Horizontal base-plate, ensures the safety of Main Lock-<br>
Mounting Bracket. Again the screws, which fix the L-shaped protective Locking<br>
Segment with the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket, remains inaccessible because of<br>
the	Main	Lock-<br>
Assembly, present above these screws. The small pin , locking the Main Lock-Assembly, is also very safely mounted so that it does not allow the removal of Main Lock Assemblyy. Finally removal of console is also not possible because of the long pin passing through it. The complete Gear Lock Mounting assembly, except the blunt portion of long pin is hidden inside the console because of its compact shape and small size. Therefore the Gear Lock Mounting system is the most robust design of lock and it is the safest gear lock mounting system.<br>
3.3 Details of the figures and description of the invention with the help of figures:<br>
The present embodiment about proposed Gear Lock mounting system is tried to further explained by discussing certain drawings where some numerals are used<br>
as symbols to indicate several components/ parts of the lock system. These drawings show various schematic views of different components of the Gear Lock system and comprehensively depict the installation of the proposed gear lock system.<br>

Figure 1(a) &amp; (b): It depicts the gear shift lever assembly. The gear shift lever 1 looks from out side of the associated plastic housing 5 (Figure 1(b)). The complete assembly also consists of the transmission wires 2, the metal plate 3 and four studs (bolts) 4 on the metal plate 3 of the gear (Figure 1(a)). On these four inbuilt studs (bolts), 4, vehicle's nuts are placed firmly and thus the base surface of vehicle's chassis tightly holds the gear-lever assembly. At the same time, four studs help in fixing the metallic plate 3 as well as the plastic housing 5.<br>
Figure 2: The Main Lock-Mounting Bracket is a specially molded metal plate (generally steel) with certain holes and a cut for positioning the gear shift lever. In a particular side view, it looks like a chair with a seat, a backrest, an extra large base (in the form of a metallic surface) and no arm. Various portions of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket can be divided in four sections: Horizontal base-plate 6, first vertical plate 1, upper horizontal plate 8 and second vertical plate 9.<br>
Figure 3: The horizontal base plate 6 has locking holes, 11, and one big cut (curved space) 10 where the gear shift lever is positioned. The locking holes 11 of Main Lock-Mounting Bracket are placed on two of the rear-end studs, 4, in such a manner that the gear shift lever 1 cornes at the center of the cut/curve 10.<br>
Figure 4(a) &amp; 4(b): The Main Lock-Mounting Bracket has several features and it has very special design — shape and size. Four sections of it are 6, 7, 8 and 9. 6 has locking holes 11 and the cut/curve 10 for positioning of gear shift lever 1.<br>

Figure 5: The drawing is a schematic display of the L-shaped Locking Segment (symbolized by 15 in the write-up) / a three dimensional metallic component of the Gear Lock. This component has two hands / 16 and 17, both mutually perpendicular to each other. Here hand 17 has two mutually perpendicular plates 20 and 21. These plates 20 and 21 completely covers Special Nuts at studs 4 and at locking holes 11 of 6. Again hand 16 has two mutually perpendicular plates 18 and 19. Plate 18 has certain holes 22 (preferably three in number) which are exactly matching with holes 12 of 8 (figure 4). These holes 12 of plate 8 come above 22 of 18 and thus both the plates are fixed using screws. Plate 19 acts as base for hand 17. Two plates 20 and 21 of hand 17 are joined to plate 19 of hand 16.<br>
Figure 6: This drawing represents the mutually mounted Main Lock-Mounting Bracket and the L-shaped protective Locking Segment. Here, in a side view, the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket is shown in its chair like shape. Important point is, the upper horizontal plate 8, at its lower surface, is fixed with plate 18 of L-shaped Locking Segment 15. It is very clear here that 15 is very well accommodated between 6 and 8.<br>
Figure 7: This top view of the mutually mounted Main Lock-Mounting Bracket and the L-shaped protective Locking Segment indicates that plate 20 and 21 of L-shaped Locking Segment come just over the locking holes 11 of 6. Once the Special Nuts are placed on these holes, they get protected by20 and 21 from two sides/ top as well as front.<br>
Figure 8: Here the complete schematic view of the mutually mounted Main Lock-Mounting Bracket and the L-shaped protective Locking Segment indicates positions of several parts of proposed Gear Lock, like 10, 11, 16, 17, 8, 12, 9, 13 and 14.<br>

Figure 11: This is a complete side view of the Gear Lock mounting system depicting all important parts of the lock assembly-6,7,8,9,18,19,20,21,23,24 and 25.<br>
All these drawings show only schematic displays of gear Lock mounting assembly and different components of it. Gear Lock may get miner alterations in the design, shape and size of this new lock system, for aesthetics.<br>
The installation process, with the help of numerical symbols marked in the figures, is as follows:<br>
In figure 1, gear shift lever 1, is shown. A metallic plate 3 is surrounding the gear shift lever 1 with the help of four inbuilt nuts 4 just above the base surface of vehicle's chassis. These nuts 4 provide support to the metallic plate 3 for fixing the plastic housing 5 inside the console. When this new Gear Lock Mounting System is to be installed around gear, first its console is removed, plastic housing<br>
is unscrewed and the gear shift lever assembly along with the metal plate 3 are removed. Figure 1 depicts the same condition of gear shift lever assembly, four inbuilt studs (bolts) and the plastic housing.<br>
First, holes 11 of 6 are placed above two rear-end studs 4. Then the metallic plate 3 and gear shift lever assembly is placed on 6 in such a way that 1 is positioned exactly at 10. Plate 6 is loosely fixed by using two vehicle's nuts on the front-end studs and Special Nuts are applied at rear end studs (at 11). Then 23 is installed on plate 9, at hole 14, with the help of small pin 25. Long pin 24 is inserted in 13 and then position of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket is such adjusted that 24 of 23 touches the gear shift lever 1 in its reversed condition. All four nuts (two vehicle's nuts and two Special Nuts) are tightened properly. At this condition 23 is uninstalled and L-shaped protective Locking Segment 15, through its plate 18 and holes 22, is mounted at lower surface of plate 8 at holes 12 using screws provided with the lock kit. Again 23 is reinstalled on 9 and 24 is kept away. Two holes are drilled /cut in the console / one for entry of 24 into 13 and another for entry of customized key to 26. These holes are as per the template supplied along with the kit. Finally the console is installed and all the screws are tightened followed by mounting the pin stand on the console using two screws.<br>
3.4. Important facts of the proposed Gear Lock mounting system, once it is installed.<br>
(i). The long pin 24 is locked/unlocked by a customized and specially threaded key. Only two holes on console indicates the presence of the Gear Lock mounting system around gear shift lever. It is not possible to uninstall this Gear Lock mounting system from vehicle's chassis without unlocking the Main Lock Assembly 23 using the customized key followed by removal of long pin 24.<br>
(ii) The Main Lock Assembly 23 is firmly and safely fixed with the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket using small pin 25. 23 always remains inside the console, covered by the movement-less gear shift lever (preferably in reversed position).<br>
(iii) The Main Lock Assembly 23, due to special shape of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket, seats above upper horizontal plate 8 and efficiently protects and hides those screws, which mount L-shaped protective Locking Segment 15 at the lower surface of 8. Holes 12 on 8 and 22 of 18 are tightly fixed together by screws provided with the lock assembly kit.<br>
(iv) Again the plates 20 and 21 of hand 17 of L-shaped protective Locking Segment 15 cover specially Installed Nuts placed at locking holes 11 of 6, from upper as well as from front side. 15 itself is fixed safely with 8 of Main Lock-Mounting Bracket. In this way Main Lock-Mounting Bracket is also inaccessible to a stranger without customized key.<br>
(v) The complete design, shape and size of the proposed gear Lock mounting system is such that it remains covered inside the console, when it is installed around the gear shift lever. Due to special design of the system, all the major components / the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket, L-shaped protective locking segment, the Main Lock Assembly, long pin , small pin etc.; protect each other and thus ensure security of the vehicle.<br>
3.5       Gear lock mounting system   is applicable to any style of vehicles.<br>
The present embodiment along with attached drawings showing different schematic views of Gear lock mounting system and its components is according to the vehicles of Indian style. In India vehicles generally moves in the left hand side of the road and therefore the vehicles have driver's seat at the right side of the vehicle. The proposed Gear Lock mounting system, as described here, is installed in such a way so that the driver can easily operate the long pin and the key, from right to left direction and vice-versa, for locking and unlocking the Gear Lock. With certain change<br>
in the design of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket of the proposed Gear Lock mounting system, it can be made suitable for installing in any style of vehicles. For example, in the European style of vehicle, where the driver's seat remains in the left side of the vehicle. In the European style of vehicle, the driver looks the Gear Lock in his right at the console and can operate the key as well as the long pin from left to right direction and vice-versa. For this purpose, the positions of first extende portion (first vertical plate) 1 and second extended portion (second vertical plate) 9 of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket can be changed. 7 is created at left side edge of the horizontal base-plate 6, in spite of the normal position in right side edge of 6. Similarly 9 is created at right side edge of the upper horizontal plate 8, in spite of the normal position in left side edge of 8. Due to such alteration in the design of the Main Lock-Mounting Bracket all the operations of locking and unlocking of the Gear Lock change / that is from left to right. Even with certain alteration in the design of the Gear Lock can be made to lock in the normal (neutral) position of the gear shift lever. All these alternative features of the proposed gear lock, mentioned in annexure 3.5, are also under our consideration for patent protection.<br>
3.6.      Difference between the proposed gear lock mounting system and the existing one.<br>
(i)        Drilling of Chassis is not required<br>
For the installation of the existing gear lock system in the vehicle the drilling of the chassis is required on which the gear lock system is mounted. The proposed new system doesn't require any drilling on the chassis because it uses the inbuilt studs (bolts) at the base of gear for its installation.<br>
(ii)       Easy Installation<br>
The installation of the proposed Gear Lock system is easy. It doesn't require any drilling hi the body of the vehicle. This proposed system uses the inbuilt studs (bolts) for its installation. Hence it is easy to install in<br>
comparison to the existing gear lock system, it does not require any expertise for drilling and any drive to automobile service point, which ultimately saves money and time of the consumers.<br>
(iii)Safety<br>
The existing gear lock system is installed on the body by drilling and fixing it using nut bolts with self-breakable heads. So there is all probability of getting it stolen by taking out the nuts from the bottom of the body. Hence, there is a question more on its safety. But the proposed system used the inbuilt base and studs (bolts) tor its installation. Thus the proposed one provides reliable security. The proposed new gear lock system uses the most robust design of lock and customized key, which ensures more safety. The lock system is so fitted in a sandwich from inside the console around gear shift lever, which is not distinctly visible to others except the acquainted users.<br>
Improvised rotor Lock Pins<br>
The existing conventional gear lock system consists of a conventional design of rotor lock pins whereas the proposed new system uses an improved design of rotor lock pins. These improved designed rotor lock pins are comparatively strong,<br>
Advanced gear lever locking pin<br>
The existing gear lock system uses a gear lever locking pin made up of nickel-chrome plated which is lesser in strength than the gear lever locking pin made up of copper-nickel-chrome plate, used by the proposed system. The latter one adds a new metal to increase its strength. The locking latch of the existing system is made up of aluminum, but the proposed new gear-locking latch is of CRCA.<br>
Durability<br>
The durability of the proposed Gear Lock system is more than the exiting one because of its improved design of lock pins and hardened lock pins. If you ever remove the existing gear lock system from the vehicle, then the holes made in the body of the vehicle remain as it is and it creates a lot of problem such as in rainy season the water will rush in. But in the proposed Gear Lock system since it is mounted on the inbuilt body around the gear lever so if you take it out, it doesn't create any problem / neither it leaves any mark on the body nor it deforms the vehicle.<br>
(viii)    Serviceability is not affected<br>
While installing the existing gear lock system in the vehicle, few holes were made on the body, which deforms the original appearance of the vehicle as provided by the company. These holes become active sites for corrosion too. So it affects the serviceability conditions and also the warranty of the vehicle. The proposed Gear Lock system even with it being installed, the vehicle serviceability is not affected because it doesn't deform the original configuration of the vehicle.<br>
(ix)      Provides OEM solution for Mechanical Locks<br>
The existing gear lock system has a little drawback as for as the duplicity of key is concerned. But the proposed system provides no space for the duplicity of key because it offers a unique key for the locking system.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
