Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation carbapenem antibiotic. More particularly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt in amorphous form<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Wif"<br>
 <br>
(I) wherein R represents hydrogen or COOM and M represents hydrogen or<br>
sodium ion.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Ertapenem sodium is a carbapenem marketed by Merck as Invanz®, and has     chemical     name     [4R,5S,6S]-3-[[(3S,5S)-5-[[(3-carboxyphenyl)amino] carbonyl]-3-pyrrolidinyl]-thio]-6-[(lR)-l-hydroxyethyl]-4-methyl-7-oxo-l-azabicyclo[3.2.0] hept-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid.<br>
Ertapenem sodium of general formula (I) is a ip-methylcarbapenem antibiotic, and used as antibiotic agent in the treatment of moderate to severe complicated foot infection due to indicated pathogens in diabetic patients without osteomyelitis, and also useful in the treatment of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal, gynecological, skin, and soft tissue infections, meningitis, septicemia and febrile Neutrogena.<br>
 <br>
In view of the importance of the compound of the formula (I), several synthetic procedures to prepare the compound have been reported.<br>
US 5,478,820 and US 5,856,321 claim two different processes for preparing Ertapenem and its salt. According to US 5,478,820, disodium salt of Ertapenem was prepared by dissolving crude product in water using NaHCOs (carbon dioxide source), followed by purification using column chromatography using HP20SS® or using CHP 20P and subsequent lyophilization. According to this specification the compound of formula (I) can be formulated along with alkali metal carbonate (carbon dioxide source).<br>
US 6,504,027 provides a process for preparing Ertapenem in crystalline form which comprises deprotecting and extracting into a polar organic solution containing a crude mono-protected Ertapenem of formula<br>
 <br>
CO2-X<br>
OH<br>
wherein P represents protecting group with C4.10 alcohol in the presence of an ion-pair reagent followed by adjusting the pH to 5.5, collecting and crystallizing the resultant aqueous phase to produce a crystalline compound. However this patent involves several operations and reagents.<br>
Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt is administered as a parenteral drug. Color of the reconstituted solution is an important indicator that indicates stability of the product. The formation of intense color like dark brown, black or reddish brown indicates the presence of highly unsaturated, intensely<br>
 <br>
colored impurities and/or degradation products. A significant change in color of the reconstituted solution can become a limiting factor to the shelf life of a parenteral product. In order to get rid of colored impurities, the prior art patents utilize column chromatographic techniques and extraction techniques. The prior art processes are not convenient for industrial scale-up as they involve chromatographic purification in certain stages of synthetic processes.<br>
US 7,022,841 (593/CHENP/2004) discloses a process for reducing the levels of organic solvents in a crystalline carbapenem to pharmaceutically acceptable levels; this patent indicated that the disclosed process is suitable only for crystalline solid having water content at about 13% to about 25% by passing wet nitrogen and vacuum. Further it has been indicated that the removal of residual organic solvent is difficult when the antibiotic is in amorphous form.<br>
There are several prior arts in the relevant field disclose that the use of humidified gas for the removal of residual solvent. For example, US 4,978,752 provides the method of passing humidified air to bring down the residual solvent below pharmaceutically acceptable level in the product. For example as shown in example 14 of the said patent, the content of ethanol was reduced to 100 ppm from about 10.0%.<br>
US 4,692,519 teaches a process of removing residual organic solvent by passing water vapor (moist air or moist nitrogen gas with relative humidity of not less than about 70%).<br>
JP 55-102585 teaches a method of drying penicillin, cephalosporin containing a low-boiling organic solvent with steam under reduced pressure, thereby removing the low-boiling organic solvent.<br>
 <br>
Process for the preparation of formulated amorphous form of Ertapenem or its salt is described in WO02/34750A1. The process involves filtering the final formulation product using sterilizing filter into a sterilizing vial and then lyophilization to final product. Process for formulation of Ertapenem-sodium or Ertapenem-COa-adduct is provided in WO01/32172A1. The process involves sterile filtration and lyophilization.<br>
In our PCT publication WO 2008/062279 (2153/CHE/2006) we have provided an improved process for the preparation of amorphous form of Ertapenem sodium by precipitation.<br>
With our continued research for developing a process for the preparation of Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt in amorphous form having good stability and pharmaceutically acceptable level of residual solvent, (The limit of pharmaceutically acceptable level residual solvent is provided in ICH Harmonised Tripartite guideline; see: Note for guidance on Impurities: residual solvents (CPMP/ICH/283/95)), we have identified a process, which is not only commercially viable, but involves simple sterile preparation techniques such as precipitation using organic solvent.<br>
Objective of the invention<br>
The main objective is to provide a simple and commercially viable, industrially scalable process for the preparation of compound of the formula (I) in amorphous form having good stability.<br>
Another objective is to provide a process for the preparation of amorphous form of Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt having pharmaceutically acceptable level of residual solvent.<br>
 <br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt<br>
 <br>
wherein R represents hydrogen or COOM and M represents hydrogen or sodium<br>
ion.<br>
the said process comprising the steps of:<br>
i)        obtaining solution of Ertapenem (I) or its sodium salt in water and<br>
optionally in the presence of solvent; ii)       optionally adjusting the pH of step (i) solution to 5.5 to 8.5; iii)      treating the solution with decolorizing agent selected from the reagent<br>
consisting of alumina, silica, clay or mixtures thereof; iv)      mixing the reaction solution with an anti-solvent; v)       filtering the precipitated amorphous solid, and optionally washing the<br>
solid using an organic solvent; and vi)       drying the amorphous Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium<br>
salt using dry gas and/or humidified gas; wherein the improvement consists of one or more of the following: i)        treating the aqueous solution with decolorizing agent selected from the<br>
reagent consisting of silica, alumina, or clay; and/or ii)       avoids the use of vacuum during drying step; and/or<br>
 <br>
iii) maintaining the water content of amorphous form of Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt about 2.5% to about 11.0% throughout the washing and drying process.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
"Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described circumstance may or may not occur, so that the description includes instances where the circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salts includes, but not limited to, the following compounds:<br>
 <br>
(H+)    (Naia<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
Further the compounds may be isolated as a mixture.<br>
In first embodiment of the present invention, the solution of Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt in step (i) is obtained by dissolving the Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt in water or directly from the reaction solution.<br>
In second embodiment of the present invention, the solvent used in step (i) is selected from methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, 1-propanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, carbonated water (Prepared by purging carbon dioxide gas in water using autoclave) and mixtures thereof.<br>
In third embodiment of the present invention the solution of Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt is obtained by dissolving Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt in water using buffer. The buffer used is selected from buffer such as N-morpholinoalkanesulfonic acid like, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), 3-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) 3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid (MOPSO), 3[N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propanesulfonic acid (TAPS), and the like. The pH of the buffer solution for dissolving Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt was adjusted between 5.5 and 8.5, preferably 5.0 and 6.0 to get monosodium. The use of buffer maintains pH of the solution medium, which minimize the degradation.<br>
 <br>
In fourth embodiment of the present invention the pH of the aqueous solution optionally adjusted to about 5.5 to 8.5. The pH of aqueous solution determines the final form of Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt. For example isolation at about pH 5.5 to 6,0 yields monosodium salt of Ertapenem, while isolation at about 7.5 pH yields disodium salt. The pH was adjusted using acids like acetic acid, formic acid, dil HCl or bases like NaOH solution, sodium bicarbonate solution and the like.<br>
In fifth embodiment of the present invention the solution of Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt is obtained by dissolving Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt in aqueous solution containing a base such as sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium carbonate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium hydroxide and the like. Accordingly Ertapenem monosodium dissolved using sodium bicarbonate and pH was further adjusted using NaOH to yield stable Ertapenem disodium. Likewise the pH of the aqueous solution was adjusted suitably to convert acid into sodium or one form of sodium into another form. Further the said solution is obtained directly from the reaction; the use of solution directly obtained from the reaction solution (Scheme-I illustrates the reaction) obviates the need of isolation of non-sterile Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt and hence directly can be utilized for sterile preparation. Since Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt being administered as injectable drug, the final drug has to be subjected to sterile micron filtration in sterile area.<br>

P" = Hydrogen or protecting group<br>
In sixth embodiment of the present invention, the aqueous solution thus obtained was treated with decolorizing agent selected from the reagent consisting of silica, alumina, clay or mixtures thereof. Such a treatment with decolorizing agent found to be advantage in terms of increasing stability of the product. As color is one of the important indicating parameter that determines the stability of injectable drug, the conventional usage of carbon to remove color fails to yield good quality product. The color of reconstituted product is dark brown to black during the use of carbon, whereas it is pale yellow, maintained for a week at 25-30** C, during the usage of above said decolorizing agent.<br>
In seventh embodiment of the present invention the solution containing Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt is further subjected to micron filtration into sterile area by conventional technique.<br>
In eight embodiment of the present invention, the anti-solvent used in step (iv) for precipitation of sterile Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt is selected from ethanol, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, 1-propanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, isopropyl ether, diethyl ether, 2-methylTHF, methyl t-butyl ether and the like or mixtures thereof.<br>
In ninth embodiment of the present invention, the organic solvent used for washing in step (v) is selected from methanol, isopropyl ether (IPE), ethyl<br>
10<br>
 <br>
acetate, methyl acetate, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-hexane, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, 2-methylTHF, methyl t-butyl ether, acetone and the like or mixtures thereof. The Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt obtained after the precipitation and after washing is found to be amorphous in nature, and may contain higher amount of residual solvents like ethanol, iso-propanol, 1-propanol, isopropyl ether, methanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane (MDC), and the like.<br>
In tenth embodiment of the present invention, the Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt thus prepared is dried using dry and/or humidified gases like air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and the like (humidified gases are obtained by mixing with water vapour). Though US 7,022,841 teaches that the removal of residual solvent in amorphous form of Ertapenem sodium is difficult, the present invention provides amorphous Ertapenem sodium of general formula (I) or its sodium salts having water content about 2.5-11.0 % throughout the operation that permits removal of residual solvent using dry and/or humidified gas. The present invention further avoids vacuum drying technique and employs dry and/or humidified gas. The drying process involves passing dry or humidified gas through Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt placed in a pressure filter till the desired results are obtained at -10 to 30° C, for example a Nutsche filter.<br>
The sterile sodium salt of formula (I) obtained through this process is found to be stable, free flowing, pure and could be easily handled for further filling in vials.<br>
Suitable temperature for dissolving non-sterile Ertapenem sodium is in the range of -30 to 15 °C.  Precipitation   was   desirably   carried   out   in   the<br>
11<br>
 <br>
temperature range of about -5 °C to 30 °C. The process provided could be conveniently followed for the preparation of non-sterile Ertapenem sodium also.<br>
In eleventh embodiment, the Ertapenem of general formula (I) or its sodium salt obtained could be optionally blended with alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate (when R is H) or with salts like Lysine or Arginine and stored in vial under carbon dioxide atmosphere or nitrogen atmosphere. Pharmaceutical composition of Ertapenem sodium may also contain sodium citrate, sodium acetate, sodium tartrate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, morpholinopropanesulfonic acid, or other phosphate buffers and the like and chelating agents like ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, hydroxyethylenediaminetriacetic acid, and the like or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The final sterile compound obtained is free flowing, having good physical properties and suitable for subsequent formulation.<br>
