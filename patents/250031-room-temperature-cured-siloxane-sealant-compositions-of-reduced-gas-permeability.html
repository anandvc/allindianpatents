PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to room temperature cured compositions of diorganopolysiloxanes polymer blends having reduced gas permeability and methods of using these compositions. The compositions are particularly well suited for use in the window area as an insulating glass sealant and in applications such as coatings, adhesives and gaskets.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Room temperature curable compositions are well known for their use as sealants. In the manufacture of Insulating glass (IGU), for example, panels of glass are placed parallel to each other and sealed at their periphery such that the space between the panels, or the inner space, is completely enclosed. The inner space is typically filled with a low conductivity gas or mixture of gases.<br>
One of the disadvantages of sealant compositions is their permeability to low conductivity energy transfer gases (e.g. argon) used to enhance the performance of insulated glass units. As a result of this permeability, the reduced energy transfer maintained by the gas between the panels of glass is lost over time.<br>
There remains a need for sealants with good barrier protection that overcomes the deficiencies described above, and is highly suitable for applications that are easy to apply and have excellent adhesion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery that a diorganopolysiloxane polymer or blend thereof exhibiting permeability to a gas and at least one polymer having a permeability to a gas or mixture of gases that is less than the permeability of diorganopolysiloxane polymer provides a sealant that has improved gas barrier<br>
-2-<br><br>
properties along with the desired characteristics of softness, process ability, and elasticity. Specifically, the present invention relates to a curable sealant composition comprising: (a) diorganopolysiloxane exhibiting permeability to gas; (b) at least one polymer having a permeability to gas that is less than the permeability of diorganopolysiloxane polymer (a); (c) cross-linker; and (d) catalyst for the cross-linker reaction.<br>
These compositions advantageously provide for longer service life of insulated glass units (IGU).<br>

Preferably, the methods of blending the diorganopolysiloxane polymers with polymers may be accomplished by contacting the components in a tumbler or other physical blending means, followed by melt blending in an extruder. Alternatively, the components can be melt blended directly in an extruder, Brabender or any other melt blending means.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting examples:<br>
Polydimethyl Siloxane (PDMS) mixture (Silanol 5000 and silanol 50000, Gelest), was melt blended with LLDPE (melt flow index (MFI) 20, from Sabic) by Rake internal mixer at 150°C, 200RPM, for total mixing time of 12 minutes. Three (3) such blends were prepared with weight percent LLDPE of 10,20 and 30, (see Example 1,2 and 3, respectively, listed below), by the following procedure:<br>
Mix silanols 5000 cPs and 50000 cPs in 1:1 ratio.<br>
Add 70 percent of silanol mixture into the Rake mixer @ 150°C<br>
Start the experiment using program window.<br>
-13-<br><br>
Add LLDPE to the mixer in small amounts. Time of addition 1-2 minutes.<br>
Add remaining mixture 30 percent of silanol into the mixer.<br>
Continue mixing for total of 12 minutes.<br>
At the end of 12th minute the rotation stops automatically, collect the blended material into a glass petridish.<br>
The following Examples were prepared from the batches obtained using above procedure:<br>
Example 1 = 52 grams mix silanol (5000 and 50000 @ 50:50) + 6 grams LLDPE<br>
Example 2 = 48 grams mix silanol (5000 and 50000 @ 50:50) + 12 grams LLDPE<br>
Example 3 = 42 grams mix silanol (5000 and 50000 @ 50:50) + 18 grams LLDPE<br>
Example 1,2 and 3, were then used to make cured sheets as follows:<br>
PDMS-LLDPE blends were mixed with n-propyl silicate (cross-linker, obtained from Gelest Chemicals, USA) and solubilized dibutyl tin oxide (DBTO)( catalyst, obtained from GE silicones, Waterford, USA), in amounts as shown in Table 1, using a hand blender for 5-7 minutes. Air bubbles were removed by vacuum and the mixture was poured in Teflon mould and kept for 24 hrs under ambient conditions (25° C and 50 percent humidity). The cured sheets were removed from mould after 24 hours and kept at ambient temperature for seven days for complete curing.<br>

The variable-volume method as displayed in Figure 1 measures Argon (Ar) permeability in "barrer" units (0.0 to 1200.0). As shown in Figure 1, Examples 1-3 displayed lowered Ar permeability relative to the Comparative Example 1.<br>
Examples 5,6 and 7 were prepared as follows:<br>
Polydimethyl Siloxane (PDMS) mixture (Silanol 3000 and silanol 30000, GE silicones), was melt blended with LLDPE (melt flow index (MFI) 20, from Sabic) in<br>
-15-<br><br>
an extruder at 150°C, along with the mixture of Hakenuka TDD CaCO? and Omya FT CaC03. The temperature settings of the barrel are given below in Table 2:<br>
Comparative Example 4 was prepared as follows:<br>
Polydimethyl Siloxane (PDMS) mixture (Silanol 3000 and silanol 30000, GE silicones), was melt blended in an extruder at 150°C, along with the mixture of Hakenuka TDD CaC03 and Omya FT CaCOa. The temperature settings of the barrel are given below in Table 2:<br>

The extruded material was collected in 6-ounce semco cartridges.<br>
Comparative Example 4, and Examples 5, 6, and 7 were then used to make cured sheets as follows:<br>
The PDMS-LLDPE blends of Examples 5-7 and Comparative Example 4 were mixed with Part B (catalyst mixture consists of solubilized dibutyl tin oxide, n-propyl silicate, aminopropyl triethoxysilane, carbon black and silicone oil) in 12.5 :1 ratio in semkit mixer for 6 minutes. The mixture was then poured in Teflon mould and kept for 24 hours under ambient conditions (25° C and 50 percent humidity). The cured sheets were removed from mould after 24 hours and kept at ambient temperature for seven days for complete curing.<br>
The permeability data of Comparative Example 4, and Examples 5, 6, and 7 with LLDPE and fillers is displayed in Figures 2 and 3.As shown in Figures 2 and 3, Examples 5-7 displayed lowered Ar permeability relative to Comparative Example 4.<br>
