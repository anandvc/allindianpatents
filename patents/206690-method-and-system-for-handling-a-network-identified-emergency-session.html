TITLE<br>
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR HANDLING A NETWORK-IDENTIFIED EMERGENCY SESSION<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention generally relates to the connection of emergency sessions such as emergency calls.<br>
Emergency calls shall be supported in IP Multimedia networks (IMS)â€¢ The UE (User Equipment) may usually be able to indicate in the initial session setup (e.g. in the INVITE message of SIP) that the session is an emergency session.<br>
However, there may be situations where the initial session setup message is just sent with an ordinary number and there is no indication about the emergency. These situations may e.g. occur when a subscriber is roaming in another IMS network.<br>
It is important to identify the intended emergency session as soon as possible, because the network and the UE need to perform some special actions for performing the emergency session.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides method and system for enabling emergency sessipns to be established in a reliable manner-<br><br>
The invention provides a method and/or system as defined in the claims.<br>
This invention discloses means and functions of how the network can detect an emergency session, how the UE can be informed about it and what effects this information has on later session setup.<br>
The invention provides among others a Network-identification of an emergency session initiated by a session initiating entity such as a user equipment (UE) including mobile or stationary stations or terminals, or the like.<br>
Even when the user equipment is unable to detect by itself that the initiated session is an emergency session, it is quickly informed thereon and can then initiate the appropriate steps for establishing the emergency session.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention, in order to guarantee resourcete at the transport level for the emergency call, a response is sent back to the UE immediately after a control means such as P-CSCF has discovered that the session is an emergency session. When the UE receives such a response it will perform a normal emergency session procedure, e.g. as defined in 3GPP specifications. To execute a normal emergency session, the UE will e.g. obtain or query location information and send it in the INVITE message and also the UE will activate an emergency PDP context for the session.<br>
The invention enables to identify the session to.be an emergency session as soon as possible so that the network and the UE can perform the necessary special actions for the emergency session as quickly as possible.<br><br>
In one of the alternative implementations of the invention, the control entity such as P-CSCF does not respond immediately to UE when it has received an  INVITE message from the UE but waits for the reception of a message, e.g. 183 Session Progress, from an emergency center or an intermediate network entity, and adds to that message the emergency information .The information about the emergency call is not delayed at all, and the call establishment is continued in the conventional or any other manner such as with the 183 Session Progress message.<br>
Sending an INVITE message takes remarkable radio resources and it is not preferable to send multiple INVITE messages. Actually there is no delay in session establishment, since UE has not yet started creating secondary PDP Context before UE receives the SDP message. This means that the indication can be included with high priority for the user plane. If no emergency centre is indicated, a default emergency center may be chosen.       <br>
This invention concerns a situation, in which PDP context activation can not or will not be performed at first when initiating a session for any reason, but a message such as an INVITE message is sent first from the UE to the CSCF.<br>
Further details, aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following reference to specific embodiments and the attached drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig- 1 shows a first embodiment of a method and system in<br><br>
accordance with the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a second embodiment of a method and system in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a third embodiment of a method and system in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Fig. 4 shows an implementation for emergency session processing in a normal case.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention discloses solutions to several problems such as:<br>
-	The UE is able to activate an emergency PDP context after<br>
it has been informed about the session characteristics. This<br>
is important to get high priority for the PDP context in the<br>
GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) and RAN (Radio Access<br>
Network) .     -	The UE sends location information after it-is being<br>
informed about the session characteristics (it"is assumed<br>
that location information is not sent in every INVITE<br>
message). The location information is used for selecting the<br>
most suitable Emergency Centre (EC).<br>
Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of the invention which includes a call originating element, i.e. a session initiating element, such as a mobile station (UE) 10, and a network which comprises a serving network element such as a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN), and a further control element such as a Call State Control Function (CSCF) or Proxy Call State Control Function (P-CSCF) 11. The further network elements<br><br>
necessary for completing an IP multimedia session such as a terminating element, a gateway node if needed, a subscriber information register such as a home location register (HLR) or home subscriber server (HSS), etc. are known to the skilled man and are therefore neither shown nor described in more detail. Generally, a MSC (Mobile Switching Centre, not shown) may return to UE a Call Proceedings message which contains a Priority information field defining also EC (Emergency Centre).<br>
In all embodiments described above or below, the UE 1 may be equipped with a USIM (User Services Identity Module).<br>
The embodiments shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 relate to a Network-identified emergency session.<br>
A solution to guarantee resources at the transport level to perform the emergency call is to respond back to the UE 10 immediately after a network entity, e.g. a control means such as P-CSCF 11, has discovered that the session is an emergency session. When the UE 10 receives the response, i.e. is informed, by the network, on the initiated session being an emergency session, it will perform normal emergency session procedure, e.g. as defined in 3GPP specifications.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the solution at a general level.<br>
In step 1, the UE 10 sends a session initiation message, e.g. an INVITE message of SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), which indicatess an identifier, e.g. the E.164 number or LN (logical name), of the called entity, to the P-CSCF 11.<br>
In a step 2, the P-CSCF 11 analyses the number or LN. When detecting that a normal session is to initiated, a normal connection procedure is continued. When, however, the P-CSCF 11 discovers that the call is emergency call, steps 3<br><br>
to 6 shown in Fig. 1 are performed.<br>
In step 3, a response is sent to the UE 10 indicating that the session is an  emergency session.<br>
Step 4: The UE 10 returns an acknowledgement message ACK to the P-CSCF 11.<br>
In an optional step 5, the UE 10 may inform the user that the session is emergency session, e.g. by displaying an appropriate message on a display of the UE 10.<br>
Then, a normal emergency session is executed (performed) as  indicated by step 6. The execution of a normal emergency session means that the UE 10 will e.g. obtain location information and send it in the INVITE message and also that the UE 10 will activate an emergency PDP context for the session.<br>
The response message at step 3 can be a new message, or an existing SIP message or other known message can be used. The information in the response message may be a new parameter in SIP protocol, but an existing parameter may also be used.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a solution in which, in step 3, a SIP 302 message "Moved Temporarily" is used as response. The parameter value in the 302 message indicates-that the session is an emergency session. The parameter may e.g. be "Contact: sip:<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e1848c849386848f8298a197889288958485cf82928287cf828e8c">[email&#160;protected]</a>". This value can e.g. be used in SIP URI when sending a new INVITE message to P-CSCF 11, or the UE 10 just generates a new INVITE message with the indication of an emergency session. Another alternative can be to use the SIP NOTIFY method. i<br>
Apart from the above discusion, the embodiment sh.own in Fig. 2 has the same structure and functioning as the one of Fig. 1.<br>
&gt;  Fig. 3 illustrates another embodiment of the invention. In<br><br>
addition to the UE 10 and the P-CSCF 11, a Serving CSCF (S-CSCF) 12 and an Emergency Centre (EC) 13 are shown. The embodiment according to Fig. 3 provides an alternative functioning as compared to the embodiments of Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
In order to achieve a very fast session establishment the P-CSCF 11 does not respond back to the UE 10 immediately after P-CSCF 11 has discovered that the session is an emergency session. On the contrary it continues session establishment and optionally, if possible, the P-CSCF 11 adds an indication of emergency session to the messages generated by P-CSCF 11 for ensuring high priority treatment of the messages.<br>
The details of the procedure are shown in Fig, 3. Taking account of the nature of emergency session it is highly desirable not to add any additional delay also in case of abnormal situations to session establishment. By using the alternative of Fig. 3, it is possible to avoid the transfer of another INVITE message over the air interface, which is probably the largest and slowest message and thus very time-consuming.       *<br>
The response message (in SIP, preferably a message "183 Progress") to the UE 10 preferably includes an indication of emergency session. This allows to activate an emergency PDP context for the session.<br>
If there should not exist location information in S-CSCF 12 (or the relevant server) to select an emergency center 13, the S-CSCF 12 (or relevant server) will select an emergency center 13 without location information of the user (e.g. it selects a default emergency center, nearest emergency center or it may use some other technique to select the emergency center e.g. based on the address of P-CSCF 11.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 3, in step 1, the UE 10 initiates a session establishment and sends a session setup message, e.g. an INVITE message, to the P-CSCF 11. The P-CSCF 11 analyses the number or logical name (LN) of the called party/entity indicated in the session setup message, and discovers that the call is an emergency call. The P-CSCF 11 may add an indication of emergency session to the INVITE message (it is also possible that other elements add this indication of emergency session to the INVITE message).<br>
In step 2, the INVITE message is forwarded to the S-CSCF 12.<br>
In Step 3, the S-CSCF 12 selects an emergency center (EC) 13 and forwards the INVITE message to the EC 13.<br>
Step 4: The EC 13 responds to the INVITE request by returning a response such as SIP 183 "Session Progress" to the S-CSCF 12. The subset of the media flows shown in steps 4 to 6 indicates that messages are returned back to originating endpoints proposing an EC 13 for providing support, or requesting the emergency session.<br>
Step 5: The S-CSCF 12 forwards the response such as SIP 183 "Session Progress" back to the P-CSCF 11.<br>
Step 6: The P-CSCF 11 forwards the response such as SIP 183 "Session Progress" back to the UE 10. The response includes the indication of emergency session. The UE 10 thus learns that this session is an emergency session and can act properly.<br>
The circles and ovals shown in Fig. 3 mean "Emergency call detected. Possibility to add an emergency indication".<br><br>
Fig. 4 presents a proposal for normal emergency session establishment for the case where the UE has USIM. It is assumed that the UE has activated a signalling PDF context to the GGSN in the visited PLMN.<br>
In the following, the steps shown in Fig. 4 are described in more detail, referring to the step numbering of Fig. 4.<br>
1.	UE may request SAI (Service Area Identity) from SGSN.<br>
2.	SGSN sends response message to UE.<br>
3.	UE sends the SIP INVITE request, containing an initial SDP, to a P-CSCF determined via the CSCF discovery mechanism. Information about emergency call is sent in the INVITE message. UE includes the location information in the INVITE message.<br>
4.	P-CSCF detects that the call is an emergency call using the information in the INVITE message e.g. by analysing the number or name requested. P-CSCF selects a S-CSCF in the visited network and forwards the SIP INVITE request including the information about emergency call to S-CSCF.<br>
5.	S-CSCF uses the location information to select an<br>
appropriate EC. S-CSCF forwards the request to EC.<br>
6.	The media stream capabilities of the destination are<br>
returned along the signaling path.<br>
7.    S-CSCF forwards the message containing the destination SDP cababilities to P-CSCF.<br>
8. P-CSCF authorizes the resources necessary for this session.<br>
9.	P-CSCF forwards the SDP message to the originating<br>
endpoint.<br>
10.	UE decides the final set of media streams for this<br><br>
session, and sends the Final SDP to P-CSCF.<br>
11.	P-CSCF forwards the final SDP to S-CSCF.<br>
12.	S-CSCF forwards this message to EC.<br>
13.	Activate PDP Context Request. The UE activates a PDP<br>
context for the emergency session by sending the Activate<br>
Secondary PDP Context Request message to the SGSN. The UE<br>
indicates that the PDP context is used for an emergency<br>
session. For the PDP context, the Allocation / Retention<br>
Priority shall be at once set to the high value.<br>
14.	The SGSN, when recognising that the PDP context is for an emergency session, may itself request location information from SRNC, in order to receive updated or more accurate location information regarding the UE. SGSN thereafter sends a location report to Gateway Mobile Location services Centre (GMLC) as specified in TS 23.271, and the EC may obtain this location information from GMLC.<br>
15.	Radio Access Bearer Setup<br>
16.	Create PDP Context Request<br>
17.	Create PDP Context Response<br>
18.	Activate PDP Context Accept<br>
19.	UE sends the "Resource Reservation Successful" message to the terminating endpoint, via the signaling path established by the INVITE message.<br>
20.	P-CSCF forwards this message to S-CSCF.<br>
21.	S-CSCF forwards this message to EC.<br>
22.	Resources are reserved successfully.<br>
23.	EC sends information about alerting to S-CSCF.<br>
a<br>
24.	S-CSCF forwards the Ringing message to P-CSCF.<br><br>
25.	P-CSCF forwards this message to UE,<br>
26.	EC answers the call and sends final 200 OK message to S-CSCF.<br>
27.	S-CSCF forwards final 200 OK message to P-CSCF.<br>
28.	P-CSCF indicates the resources reserved for this session should now be committed.<br>
29.	P-CSCF forwards final 200 OK message to UE.<br>
30.	UE starts the media flow for this session.<br>
31.	The calling party responds to the 200-OK final response with a SIP ACK message which is sent to P-CSCF.<br><br>
32.	P-CSCF forwards the SIP ACK message to S-CSCF<br>
33.	S-CSCF forwards the ACK message to EC.<br>
Although the invention has been described above with reference to specific embodiments, the scope of protection of the invention intends to cover all modifications, omissions, additions and amendments of the disclosed features as well.<br>
The teaching according to the invention is preferably-implemented in an All-IP Network but may also be employed in networks of various other types, i.e. in IM, GPRS and UMTS domains.<br><br><br><br><br>
