				<td>This invention relates to an auto-lock slide fastener slider for use in an ordinary type slide fastener, and more particularly to an auto-lock slide fastener slider in which locking function is performed by pivotal movement of a pull tab, without using a spring.<br>
FIG. 7 of the accompanying drawings shows a conventional auto-lock slide fastener slider as disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Sho 45-2165. In this conventional slider, a locking leaf spring 102 having a U-shaped locking projection 109 is floatably seated in a central arcuate recess 110 of the upper wing 115 with one end fixed in a recess 133 near a front end of the central recess 110 with the U-shaped locking projection 119 being able to be fitted in the locking-projection-insertion hole 111 provided in a bottom of the recess 110. A pull tab 103 has at one end an axle rotatably supported by a pair of pull-tab-attachment lugs 114 standing on the upper wing 105 at opposite sides of the central recess 110 and a cam 122 on the axle. In response to pivotal movement of the pull tab 103 from an upright posture to a horizontal posture, the cam 122 resiliently bends the leaf spring 102 so as to insert the locking projection 119 through<br><br>
the locking-projection-insertion hole 111 communicating with the recess 110.<br>
FIG. 8 shows another conventional auto-lock slide fastener slider as disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Sho 51-523766.  In this conventional slider, a locking plate 102 having on its lower surface a locking pawl<br>
119	is loosely received in a recess 110 of the upper wing 105 for pivotal movement about a rear end of the recess 110 and also for sliding movement in longitudinal direction, the cutout having a varying depth progressively increasing from its rear end, which is off the fulcrum 121 of a pull tab 103 to the rear side, toward its front end. The locking plate 102 has on its upper surface a central projection 134 having a perpendicular front surface and a convex rear surface. The pull tab 103 has in its front end portion at a position off an axle 121 a cutaway<br>
120	complementary in shape to the central projection 134 of the locking plate 102 so that the central projection 134 can be fitted in the cutaway 120 when the pull tab 103 assumes a horizontal posture. Also the pull tab 103 has a cam 122 being forward of the cutaway 120 point-symmetric in shape with and contiguous with the central projection 134.<br>
According to the auto-lock slider of FIG. 7, when it assumes a horizontal posture to lock the slider, the pull tab 103 tends to be pushed upwardly partly because the U-shaped locking projection 119 is raised by the fastener elements and<br><br>
partly since the locking leaf spring 102 slides to the rear side by its own restoration, thus resulting in a non-stable locking operation. Further, since the locking projection 119 of the leaf spring 102 is merely curved in a U shape, it tends to deform so that a precise locking operation cannot be expected.<br>
According to the auto-lock slider of FIG. 8, since, in response to pivotal movement of the pull tab 103, the locking plate 102 is pivotally moved in the vertical direction and is slid in the longitudinal direction, it is necessary to press a grip portion of the pull tab against the slider body in order to insert the locking pawl 119 between adjacent fastener elements, thus resulting in a very meticulous and non-smooth locking operation. Further, since, for sliding the slider, it is required to pivotally move and slide the locking plate 102 by pivotally moving the pull tab 103 to an upright posture, a smooth sliding operation cannot be expected as the locking plate 102 is held non-stably.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A first object of this invention is to provide an auto-lock slide fastener slider in which, though the slider has a locking mechanism performed by a locking pawl, the locking pawl is prevented from giving any hurt or damage to the user or a garment.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of an auto-lock slide fastener slider according to this invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
The auto-lock slide fastener slider of this invention is<br><br>
an ordinary type having a locking mechanism, and is composed of three members, i.e. a slider body 1, a locking plate 2 and a pull tab 3, as shown in FIG. 1 and 2 or four members, i.e. a slider body 1, a locking plate 2, a pull tab 3 and a cover 4, as shown in FIG. 5. These members are molded preferably of metal, such as aluminum alloy or zinc alloy, by die casting, and alternatively they may be molded of thermoplastic resin, such as polyamide, polyacetal or polypropylene, by injection molding. In another alternative form, the slider may be assembled of metal members and thermoplastic members in combination.<br>
In the auto-lock slide fastener slider of FIG. 1, the slider body 1 is composed of upper and lower wings 5, 6 joined by a guide post 7, and the upper wing 5 has along its opposite side edges a pair of flanges 8 to define between the upper and lower wings 5, 6 an element guide channel 9 through which a pair of rows of fastener elements (hereinafter called the fastener elements) are to be guided. The upper wing 5 has in its upper surface a recess 10 extending from the center of an upper surface thereof to an upper portion of the guide post 7, and a locking-pawl-insertion hole 11 extends at a rear position and on one side of the recess 10 to communicate with the element guide channel 9 for accommodating a locking pawl 19 of the locking plate 2. Further, the upper wing 5 has on its upper surface a locking-plate-attachment projection 12<br><br>
disposed in front of the recess 10 for pivotally attaching the locking plate 2 and a pair of pull-tab-attachment lugs 14 disposed at opposite sides of the recess 10, each pull-tab-attachment lug 14 having a U-shaped cutout 13 for rotatably attaching an axle (described below) of the pull tab 3.<br>
The locking plate 2 has a stepped surface 16 at its upper surface so that the locking plate 2 can escape from contact of a cam (described below) of the pull tab 3 when the pull tab 3 is pulled in order to slide the slider. The locking plate 2 has in one end a cutout 17 and an axle 18 extending across the cutout 17 so that the locking plate 2 is pivotally mounted on the locking-plate-attachment projection 12. And the locking plate 2 has on a lower surface of the other end the round-headed locking pawl 19 disposed off to one side so as to be aligned with the locking-pawl-insertion hole 11, the locking pawl 19 having a round head larger than the gap between adjacent fastener elements so as to be supported between them.<br>
The pull tab 3 is in the form of a rectangular or other plate and has in one end a pair of through-holes 20 on opposite sides and a pintle 21 at ends of the through-holes 20 so that the pull tab 3 is pivotally mounted on the pull-tab-attachment lugs 14. Also the pull tab 3 has a cam 22 extending centrally between the through-holes 20 perpendicularly to the pintle 21 and has a width equal to the width of the locking plate 2. When the pull tab 3 is set to be flat, a peak 22' of the cam 22 is<br><br>
disposed off an axis of the pintle 21 toward the above-mentioned one end and toward the axle side of the locking plate 2 for resting on the upper surface of the locking plate 2.<br>
For assembling, firstly the locking plate 2 is loosely seated in the recess 10 on the upper wing 5 with the axle 18 rotatably supported by the locking-plate-attachment projection 12 and with the locking pawl 19 being inserted in the locking-pawl-insertion hole 11 communicating with the recess 10. Over the locking plate 2, the pintle 21 of the pull tab 3 is received in the U-shaped cutouts 13 of the pull-tab- attachment lugs 14, whereupon the confronting upper ends of each lug 14 are clamped toward each other in such a manner that the axle 21 is rotatably held on the pull-tab-attachment lugs 14 with the cam 22 in contact with the upper surface of the locking plate 2.<br>
In operation, as shown in FIG. 4, for sliding the slider along the fastener chain, the pull tab 3 is turned to its upright posture to release the cam 22 from pressing the locking plate<br>
2	so that the locking plate 2 can be pivotally moved freely.<br>
If the slider body 1 is then slid, the locking plate 2 is floated<br>
as the locking pawl 19 is pushed away by the fastener elements.<br>
As a result, the slider 1 can be slid freely on the fastener<br>
chain as the locking plate 2 is pivotally moved up and down.<br>
For stopping the slider, as shown in FIG. 3, the pull tab<br>
3	is turned to its horizontal posture to press the cam 22 against<br><br>
the upper surface of the locking plate 2 and, at the same time, the peak 22' of the cam 22 touches the upper surface of the locking plate 2 off an axis of the pintle 21 toward the above-mentioned one end of the pull tab 3, thus forcing the locking pawl 19 into the gap between adjacent fastener elements. Thus the slider is kept in locked posture unless the pull tab 3 is turned to its upright posture.<br>
In the auto-lock slide fastener slider of FIG. 5, the slider body 1 is composed of upper and lower wings 5, 6 joined by a guide post 7 so as to define between the upper and lower wings 5, 6 an element guide channel 9. The upper wing 5 has in its upper surface a recess 10 extending from the center of an upper surface thereof to an upper portion of the guide post 7, and a locking-pawl-insertion hole 11 extends at a rear position and on one side of the recess 10 to communicate with the element guide channel 9. Further, the upper wing 5 has on its upper surface a pair of cover-attachment projections 23 at front and rear sides, respectively, of the recess 10 for attaching a cover 4, each cover-attachment projection 23 having a protuberance 24 bulging outwardly from its upper end. Also the upper wing 5 has on its upper surface a pair of pull-tab- attachment lugs 25 at opposite sides of the recess 10, each pull-tab-attachment lug 25 having in its upper end a U-shaped cutout 26 for rotatably receiving a pintle 29 of a pull tab 3. The lower wing 6 also has in its upper surface an<br><br>
element-receiving recess 15 extending from the central position to the rear end.<br>
The locking plate 2 has a stepped surface 16 at its upper surface so that the locking plate 2 can escape from contact of a cam (described below) of the pull tab 3 when the pull tab 3 is pulled in order to slide the slider. The locking plate 2 has at one end a downwardly directed round head 27 through its entire width so that the locking plate 2 is pivotally seated in the first recess 10. And the locking plate 2 has on a lower surface of the other end a round-headed locking pawl 19 disposed off to one side so as to be aligned with the locking-pawl-insertion hole 11, the locking pawl 19 having a round head larger than the gap between adjacent fastener elements so as to be supported between them.<br>
The pull tab 3 has at one end a through-hole 28, the pintle 29 extending cross the through-hole 28 to be supported on the pull-tab-attachment lugs 25, and a cam 22 integrally formed centrally on the pintle 29 and having a width corresponding to a width of the locking plate 2. The cam 22 has a peak 22' disposed off an axis of the pintle 29 to the above-mentioned one end of the pull tab 3.<br>
The cover 4 is in the form of a rectangular box having in opposite side walls a pair of cutaways 30, through which the pintle 29 of the pull tab 3 is to be inserted, and in front and rear walls a pair of rectangular windows 31, in which the<br><br>
respective protuberances zi  or tne rront and rear cover-attachment projections 23 are to be inserted. Further, the cover 4 has on its inner surface a pair of (front and rear) engaging projections 32 engageable with the front and rear cover-attachment projections 23 on the upper wing 5, respectively, the front engaging projection 32 being also engageable with the round head 27 of the locking plate 2.<br>
For assembling, firstly the locking plate 2 is loosely seated in the recess 10 on the upper wing 5 with the locking pawl 19 is inserted in the locking-pawl-insertion hole 11 communicating with the recess 10. Over the locking plate 2, the pintle 29 of the pull tab 3 is received in the U-shaped cutouts 26 of the pull-tab-attachment lugs 25, whereupon the cover 4 is pressed against the cover-attachment projections 23 in such a manner that the respective protuberances 24 of the front and rear cover-attachment projections 23 are engaged in the front and rear windows 31 of the cover 4 in a snap action with the cam 22 in contact with the upper surface of the locking plate 2, thus fixing the cover 4 to assemble the slider body 1. As an alternative cover-attaching means, opposite side walls of the cover 4 may be clenched against grooves in opposite side surfaces of modified front and rear cover-attachment projections 23 after the cover-attachment projections 23 are covered with the cover 4.<br>
In operation, likewise the previous embodiment, for<br><br>
sliding the slider along the fastener chain, the pull tab 3 is turned to its upright posture to release the cam 22 from pressing the locking plate 2 so that the locking plate 2 can be pivotally moved freely. If the slider body 1 is then slid, the locking plate 2 is floated as the locking pawl 19 is pushed away by the fastener elements. As a result, the slider 1 can be slid freely on the fastener chain as the locking plate 2 is pivotally moved up and down, during which the front engaging projection 32 of the cover 4 is disposed in confronting relation to the round head 27 of the locking plate 2 so that the pivotal movement of the locking plate 2 is restricted within a predetermined range.<br>
For stopping the slider, the pull tab 3 is turned to its horizontal posture to press the cam 22 against the upper surface of the locking plate 2 and, at the same time, the peak 22' of the cam 22 touches the upper surface of the locking plate 2 at a position off the axis of the pintle 21 toward the above-mentioned one end of the pull tab 3, thus preventing the pull tab 3 from pivotally moving to be upright, so that the locking pawl 19 is forced into the gap between adjacent fastener elements to lock the slider. At that time, a pair of rows of fastener elements is forced against the element-receiving recess 15 of the lower wing 6 by the pressing action of the locking pawl 19 to reliably stop the sliding of the slider in the direction of opening the slide fastener. Alternatively,<br><br>
in case of a single fastener element, the fastener element may be forced into the element-receiving recess 15 to prevent slider from sliding.<br>
With the auto-lock slide fastener slider of this invention, the following advantageous results can be achieved:<br>
According to the first aspect of the invention, partly since the locking plate 2 is pivotally mounted at one end on the upper wing 5 and has at the other end the locking pawl 19 for projecting into the element guide channel 9 from the locking-pawl-insertion hole 11 provided in the upper wing 5 and retracting from the element guide channel 9 into the locking-pawl-insertion hole 11, and partly since the pull tab 3 is pivotally connected at one end to the upper wing 5 and has the cam 22 touchable with the upper surface of the locking plate 2 to be floated by the fastener elements, the locking pawl and/or other sharp projection does not expose on the slider surface unlike the conventional slider, in which a locking pawl is formed directly on the pull tab, thus giving no hurt to the user or no damage to a garment. Further, this slider is safe and excellent in operability and secures a reliable locking operation.<br>
According to the second aspect of the invention, partly since the upper wing has a recess extending from its center to the upper portion of the guide post 7 and the locking-pawl-insertion hole 11 communicating with the recess 10, and<br><br>
partly since the locking plate 2 is seated in the recess with the round-headed locking pawl 19 loosely inserted in the locking-pawl-insertion hole 11, the entire locking plate 2 is accommodated within the slider body 1, thus making the slider neat in appearance without increasing the height of the slider body. Further, since the locking pawl 19 has a round head, smooth sliding of the slider can be achieved.<br>
According to the third aspect of the invention, since the round-headed locking pawl 19 of the locking plate 2 is larger than the gap between adjacent fastener elements and can be supported between the adjacent fastener elements, it is possible to move the locking plate 2 without damaging the fastener elements, unlike the conventional slider in which a round-headed locking projection is to be inserted between adjacent fastener elements, thus realizing a smooth locking operation.<br>
According to the fourth aspect of the invention, since, when the pull tab 3 is in upright posture, the point of contact between the cam 22 of the pull tab 3 and locking plate 2 is disposed off the pintle 21 of the pull tab 3 toward the. pivot end of the locking plate 2, the pull tab is prevented from being pivotally moved when it is in horizontal posture, thus making the slider neat in appearance.<br>
According to the fifth aspect of the invention, since the lower wing 6 has in its upper surface the element-receiving<br><br>
recess 15 facing the locking-pawl-insertion hole 11 of the upper wing 5 so as to confront with the locking pawl 19 of the locking plate 2, the fastener elements can be forced into the element-receiving recess 15 by the locking pawl 19 when the pull tab 3 is turned to its horizontal posture, thus the slider is prevented from sliding. Especially the slider is completely prevented from moving in an opening direction, thus it is suitable for the fastener chain having a single element, achieving a reliable locking operation.<br>
According to the sixth aspect of the invention, since the locking plate 2 has on its upper surface a stepped surface 16 so as to escape from contact with the cam 22, the locking plate<br>
2	can be floated by the fastener elements so as to pivotally<br>
move freely, thus realizing smooth sliding of the slider.<br>
According to the seventh aspect of the invention, partly since the upper wing 5 has the pair of pull-tab-attachment lugs 14 standing on said upper surface at opposite sides of the recess 10 for rotatably supporting the axle 18 of the locking plate 2, and partly since the upper wing 5 has the locking-plate-attachment projection 12 disposed in front of the recess 10 for rotatably supporting the axle of the pull tab, partly since the locking plate 2 has the axle 18 at one end and the locking pawl 19 at the other end, partly since the pull tab<br>
3	has at the center of one end the cam 22 having the pintle<br>
21 extending on both sides of the cam 22, partly since the axle<br><br>
18 of the locking plate 2 is pivotally attached to the locking-plate-attachment projection 12, and partly since the pintle 21 of the pull tab 3 is pivotally attached to the pull-tab-attachment lugs 14, the auto-lock slider composed of three members of the slider body 1, the locking plate 2, and the pull tab 3 can be assembled simple in structure with simple members, the slide being suitable for automatic assembling, thus improving the rate of production.<br>
According to the eighth aspect of the invention, partly since the upper wing 5 has on its upper surface the pair of cover-attachment projections 23 at front and rear sides, and the pair of pull-tab-attachment lugs 25 at opposite sides, respectively of the recess 10 for rotatably supporting the pintle 29 of the pull tab 3, partly since the locking plate<br>
2	has at one end the downwardly directed round head 27 and at the other end the locking pawl 19, partly since the pull tab<br>
3	has at one end the pintle 29 having in its center a cam 22, partly since the cover 4 has in its inner surface the engaging projections 32 which are engageable with the cover-attachment projections 23, and partly since the locking plate 2 is loosely seated in the recess 10 and the pintle 29 of the pull tab 3 is mounted on the pull-tab-attachment lugs 25, and then the cover 4 is put on from the above, so that the cover 4 is fixed to the cover-attachment projections 23 while the engaging projections 32 are engageable with the round head 27, the<br><br>
auto-lock slider composed of four members i.e. the slider body 1, the locking plate 2, the pull tab 3 and the cover 4 can be assembled simple in structure with simple members, thus the slider can be neat in appearance and the slider can be automatically assembl i at higher speed to improve productivity.<br><br><br>
