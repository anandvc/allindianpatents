				<td>The powder was applied to the surfaces bearing the latent fingerprint with a camel hairbrush. The excess powder was blown off. The surface was photographed.<br>
Accordingly, the  present  invention  provides  a  novel  powder formulation  for detecting  latent fingerprints comprising:<br>
[a]	crystal violet<br>
[b]	corn flour<br>
[c]	talcum powder, wherein the ratio of [a] : [b] : [c] is 1:50:49.<br>
The invention further provides process for the preparation of the said formulation, wherein the steps comprising:<br>
[a]	mixing crystal violet, corn flour and talcum powder in a ratio of 1:50:49 to form a dry powder;<br>
[b]	adding water to the powder as obtained in step [a] wherein the ratio of powder to water is 1:5 by weight under vigorous stirring to obtain a suspension;<br>
[c]	drying the suspension as obtained in step [b] at a temperature of 20 to 30 degree C for 7 to 10 days to get a dried mass;<br>
[d]	grinding the dried mass as obtained in step [c] to obtain the desired powder formulation.<br>
Results<br>
The formulation has been used to detect latent fingerprints on both absorbent and non-absorbent surfaces. It is specifically used on multi-coloured, glossy articles. Weak prints on both white and multi-coloured surfaces may be detected under ultraviolet light. Good quality prints have been lifted from lamination sheets. Thus, the present method may be extended to obtaining fingerprints on laminated documents, such as archeological scripts, certificates, driving licenses and identity cards. Fingerprints have been visualized on obverse and waxed, reverse sides of postal stamps. Prints may also be developed on polythene bags, commonly used for carrying household items. Other surfaces on which an unscrupulous element is likely to leave his fingerprint impressions include glassware, steel handles, knobs and almirahs, bakelite switches and switchboards, bone china and porcelain crockery, polished furniture and enameled utilities like cars, washing machines and refrigerators. The present formulation gives good results on all these surfaces.<br>
Advantages<br>
The present fingerprint dusting composition offers the following advantages:<br>
l.The fingerprints developed by the present method are sharp, clear and visible even to the naked<br>
eye. 2. The method is not surface-specific, it works equally well on absorbent and non-absorbent surfaces. It is particularly useful for detecting fingerprints on multi-coloured glossy items.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is that the crystal violet is a fluorescent dye and, therefore, weak, chance prints may be developed by imp ringing ultraviolet light on treated surface.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is that the technique requires neither a sophisticated instrument nor a costly equipment. It does require an ultraviolet lamp when weak fingerprints are encountered. However, this apparatus has a reasonable cost and is easily available.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is that it takes just one minute to develop the latent fingerprints by this method.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is that the formulation may be used both in the laboratory, as well as at the scene of crime.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is that the composition may be prepared and used even by an amateurish hand.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is that the formulation does not pose occupational hazard to the user. Crystal violet is a biological stain. It is also used for making inks and for dyeing paper. Corn floor is a food-thickening agent. Talcum powder is a cosmetic.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In order to overcome these problems, a novel fingerprint powder composition based on a non-toxic, fluorescent, organic dye, crystal violet (Fig. 1), has been prepared. The method of preparation is as follows:<br>
The formulation contained 1% by weight of crystal violet. Corn flour (2.50g), talcum powder (2.45 g) and crystal violet (0.05 g) were suspended in about 25 ml water. The contents were stirred vigorously and then allowed to dry at room temperature for about 7 days. The dried mass was ground with a mortar and pestle and the fine powder was stored in a tightly stoppered vessel.<br><br>
The powder was applied to the surface bearing the latent fingerprint with a camel hairbrush. The excess powder was blown off. The surface was photographed.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel fingerprint dusting composition comprising a novel fingerprint dusting composition having crystal violet with adhesive mixture of corn flour and talcum powder in a ratio of 1:50:49 for taking finger prints on a wide range of absorbent, non-absorbent surfaces and multi-colored surfaces. Accordingly the present invention provides a process comprising of steps<br>
a.	mixing crystal violet, corn flour and talcum powder in a ratio of about<br>
1:50:49 as dry powder.<br>
b.	stirring vigorously the mixture as formed in step (a) into water in a<br>
proportion 1:5 by weight.<br>
c.	drying the aqueous suspention of mixture as   formed in step (b) at<br>
room temperature for seven days<br>
d.	grinding of dried power in a mortar and pestle to obtain uniform fine<br>
powder to be used for fingerprinting.<br>
Results<br>
The formulation has been used to detect latent fingerprints on both absorbent and non-absorbent surfaces. It is specifically useful on multi-colored, glossy articles. Weak prints on both white and multi-colored surfaces may be detected under ultraviolet light. Good quality prints have been lifted from lamination sheets. Thus the present method may be extended fro obtaining fingerprints on laminated documents, such as archeological scripts, certificates, driving licenses and identity cards. Fingerprints have been visualized on obverse and waxed, reverse sides of postal stamps. Prints may also be developed on polythene bags- commonly used for carrying household items.<br>
Other surfaces on which an unscrupulous element is likely to leave his fingerprint impressions include glassware; steel handles, knobs and almirahs; bakelite switches and switchboards; bone china and porcelain crockery; polished furniture; and enameled utilities like cars, washing machines and refrigerators. The present formulation gives good results on all these surfaces (Fig. 2).<br>
Advantages<br>
The present fingerprint dusting composition offers the following advantages:<br>
1.	The fingerprints developed by the present method are sharp, clear and visible<br>
even to the naked eye.<br>
2.	The method is not surface-specific; it works equally well on absorbent and<br>
non-absorbent surfaces.  It is particularly useful for detecting fingerprints on<br>
multicolored, glossy items.<br><br>
3.	Crystal violet is a fluorescent dye and, therefore, weak, chance prints may be<br>
developed by imp ringing ultraviolet light on treated surface.<br>
4.	The technique requires neither a sophisticated instrument nor a costly<br>
equipment.   It does require an ultraviolet lamp when weak fingerprints are<br>
encountered.   However, this apparatus has a reasonable cost and is easily<br>
available.<br>
5.	It takes just one minute to develop the latent fingerprints by this method.<br>
6.	The formulation may be used both in the laboratory, as well as at the scene of<br>
crime.<br>
7.	The composition may be prepared and used even by an amateurish hand.<br>
8.	The formulation does not pose occupational hazard to the user. Crystal violet<br>
is a biological stain. It is also used for making inks and for dyeing paper. Corn<br>
floor is a food-thickening agent. Talcum powder is a cosmetic<br>
9.	Crystal violet- based dusting powder is a versatile reagent for developing<br>
latent fingerprints on a wide range of surfaces.  The method is simple, cost-<br>
effective and non-hazardous.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A novel powder formulation for detecting latent fingerprints comprising:<br>
[a]	crystal violet<br>
[b]	corn flour<br>
[c]	talcum powder<br>
wherein the ratio of [a] : [b] : [c] is 1:50:49.<br>
2.	A process for the preparation of the formulation as claimed in claim 1, wherein the steps<br>
comprising:<br>
[a]	mixing crystal violet, corn flour and talcum powder in a ratio of 1:50:49 to form a dry powder;<br>
[b]	adding water to the powder as obtained in step [a] wherein the ratio of powder to water is 1:5 by weight under vigorous stirring to obtain a suspension;<br>
[c]	drying the suspension as obtained in step [b] at a temperature of 20 to 30 degree C for 7 to 10 days to get a dried mass;<br>
[d]	grinding the dried mass as obtained in step [c] to obtain the desired powder formulation.<br>
3.	A novel powder formulation and a process for the preparation thereof substantially as<br>
herein described with reference to the foregoing examples.<br></td>
