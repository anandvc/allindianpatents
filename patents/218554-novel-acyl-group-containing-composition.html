				<td>The present invention relates to an acyl group-containing composition that comprises a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid derivative and is of high purity and free from much coloration, and to a process for easily producing the same which uses a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There have been known various anionic surfactants useful as components of cleansing agents or cosmetics. It is known that surfactants have to excel in surface activities such as detergency and forming properties. However, with the recent diversification of consumers' needs or an increase in consumers' desire for high-quality articles, they are also required not only to be less irritating to the skin, ophthalmic mucous membrane or the like, but also to make products that are free from coloration or turbidity and give a more favorable feel to the skin. In addition, there is a growing tendency for consumers to require, from the standpoint of burdening the environment, that surfactants have good biodegradability and exert a surface active effect even when used in small amounts.<br><br>
2<br>
Traditionally, anionic surfactants such as alkyl sulfates, polyoxyethylene alkyl sulfates and alkyl benzene sulfonates have been used. However, many of these surfactants are not satisfactory in that they strongly irritate the skin at the time of use. Anionic surfactants that are highly safe and excel in biodegradability are amino acid surfactants such as, for example, long chain N-acyl amino-acid salts and derivatives thereof. These surfactants, however, are not satisfactory with respect to surface activity at low concentrations, and the coloration and turbidity of products containing them at low temperatures.<br>
An example of a processes of the prior art for producing a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid derivative is disclosed in JP-B-50-2973, in which an N-acyl amino acid menthol ester is obtained by dissolving, a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride and menthol in toluol or benzol in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid as a catalyst at around 100°C for reaction, and then neutralizing, water-washing and drying the reaction product. In this process, however, coloration in the resultant long chain N-acyl acidic menthol ester (light-yellow) is inevitable because the reaction temperature is high also, industrially implementing the process is difficult because the process involves complicated operations such as neutralization, water washing and drying.<br><br>
3<br>
In JP-A-2000-44554, there is disclosed a process for producing a surfactant composed of a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid derivative, in which a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride is reacted with a compound having a hydroxy1 group or an amino group, just like the process disclosed in JP-A-50-2 973 described above. In this process, in order to prevent coloration in the end product, the reaction is carried out at temperatures higher than the melting<br>
 point of any one of the ingredients so that the<br>
ingredient is in the liquid state during the reaction, or the reaction is carried out in an inert solvent such as toluene while keeping any one of the ingredients in the liquid state. This process is, however, not a<br>
 satisfactory one with respect to preventing coloration and the reaction yield (purity) of the end product.<br>
For example, in JP-A-2000-44554, an embodiment is described in which N-lauroylglutamic acid anhydride and a sugar, such as sorbitol, or an amino<br>
 acid, such as L-glutamic acid, are reacted without a<br>
solvent at a high temperature of 100°C or more. In this process, formation of by-products is inevitable and coloration occurs in the product also, the reaction yield is too low to obtain the intended surfactant<br>
 having high purity. The specification describes that the reaction can be carried out using an inert solvent such as toluene. However, when reacting N-lauroylglutamic acid anhydride and a sugar, such as<br><br>
4 <br>
sorbitol, or an amino acid, such as L-glutamic acid, the reaction has to be carried out at a high temperature of 100°C or more so that the reaction is that of two phases, a solid phase and a liquid phase, since the solubility of these ingredients in a solvent is low. As a result, the process is not a satisfactory one with respect to the coloration and purity of the end product.<br>
The present inventors have already disclosed<br>
 in JP-A-2002-167313 an acyl group-containing<br>
composition (surfactant) that contains a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid derivative produced by reacting one or more compounds which have, per molecule, m functional groups of one kind or more selected from the<br>
 group consisting of hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups with a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride, and a process for producing the same. The inventors have made sure that the resultant acyl group-containing composition has surface activity even at low<br>
 concentrations and does not practically irritate the skin. However, the acyl group-containing composition obtained by this process is not satisfactory in that when it is neutralized and takes the form of an aqueous solution, significant coloration or turbidity occurs<br>
 and its stability is not good. Further, the reaction yield of the composition is not satisfactorily high, and due to the high impurity content, the resultant composition has to be chromatographed to enhance the<br><br>
5 end product's purity.<br>
In this reaction process, the reaction is also carried out at temperatures higher than the melting point of any one of the ingredients or by using an inert solvent, just like the process disclosed in JP-A-2000-44554 described above. Accordingly, when reacting a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride with an amino acid in an inert solvent such as toluene, since an amino acid is hard to dissolve in<br>
 solvents other than water, the reaction temperature has to be elevated to allow the reaction to procede. As a result, by-products are inevitably formed due to the secondary reaction characteristic of the reaction, which causes coloration or turbidity in the end<br>
 product.<br>
Further, acyl compounds as the reaction products do not highly dissolve in a solvent, either, or have a high melting point. Therefore, in a reaction without a solvent or in an organic solvent, they can<br>
 sometimes precipitate as intermediate products in the course of the reaction. Due to the necessity to prevent such a situation, the reaction temperature has to be set at around 100°C or higher.<br>
The present inventors have found that (i) one<br>
 of the by-products formed in such reactions (reactions carried out at temperatures equal to or higher than the melting point of any one of the ingredients used or by using an inert solvent, just as disclosed in JP-A-2002-<br><br>
6 <br>
167313 and JP-A-2000-44554) has a molecular weight smaller than that of the acyl compound as the intended end product of the reactions by 18 and (ii) the byproduct is hard to remove even by separating operations such as separation by chromatography. In fact, such a by-product could not be removed in a separation by chromatography conducted in the examples of the process disclosed in JP-A-2002-167313 and was a cause of coloration in the resultant acyl compound.<br>
	Thus, the drawbacks of the prior art lead to<br>
a first demand, that is, an acyl group-containing composition, as an anionic surfactant which is less irritating to the skin or the like and has a satisfactory surface activity even at low<br>
 concentrations, and which contains a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid derivative, wherein the composition contains a smaller amount of by-products, thereby being free from coloration and turbidity when it takes the form of an aqueous solution, and can be more easily<br>
 produced in a high yield.<br>
In the meantime, there are various kinds of gelatinous compositions, which are prepared by mixing an oil ingredient with an aqueous solvent and allowing the mixture to take the form of a gel. The term "gel"<br>
 used herein means a form of compositions which contain liquid over a wide content range, such as a paste, a cream or a jelly, as described in The Basis of Colloid Chemistry, Dainippon Tosho, 1976: 245. For example,<br><br>
7 <br>
JP-A-55-141243 discloses an oily gelatinous composition which is prepared by using sodium stearate as a gelling agent and fat and oil as a mediator. The gelatinous composition thus prepared is not satisfactory in that its gel strength is not enough, and cracks are likely to occur in the composition. Moreover, because its hardness is fixed, it does not have arbitrary hardness. JP-A-55-81655 discloses a gelatinous aromatic substance in which a water-soluble polymer compound, as a gelling agent, is generally added to make the<br>
composition gel. However, gelatinous compositions obtained by this process are not satisfactory in that when they are left at temperatures of around 40 to 50°C, their oil ingredients tend to separate or the polymerization degree of the polymers added tends to change which increases or decreases the viscosity of the compositions, and thus their stability deteriorates with time.<br>
Examples of cosmetics which use gelatinous compositions include gelatinous cleansing agents. Such gelatinous cleansing agents are prepared, for example, by mixing an oil ingredient with an aqueous solvent and allowing the mixture to take the form of a gel. Then a water-soluble polymer compound known as a gelling agent is commonly added. When using a gelatinous composition formed with a water-soluble polymer compound for cleansing cosmetics, the resultant cleansing cosmetics are not satisfactory in that they do not spread well,<br><br>
8 <br>
their detergency is questionable and they are sticky even after washing with water. Moreover, their stability deteriorates with time as described above. Meanwhile, there exists an oil gel which is obtained by making oil to gel with a gelling agent.<br>
However, the use of an oil gel makes it hard to adjust the viscosity of gelatinous compositions produced from it. Moreover, when using it for a cleansing agent such as a makeup remover, it cannot be washed from the skin<br>
 with water, and it needs to be wiped off with tissue paper or the like after use and then cleaned off again with a facial cleanser, etc. There also exist gelatinous compositions which are water-in-oil emulsions. Also in this case, the oil phase is a<br>
 continuous phase, and thus when using the compositions for cleansing agents, they need to be cleaned off the skin again with a facial cleanser, etc., just like the case of an oil gel. In either case, the hands become sticky with the oil ingredients, and the cleansing<br>
 agent does not have a favorable feel.<br>
Gelatinous compositions which are oil-in-water emulsions are also known. These types of compositions can be washed from the skin with water without a wipe-off operation as described above.<br>
 However, their oil ingredients often remain on the skin and cannot be washed off completely from the skin using only water. Further, they have a poor compatibility with oily pollutants and their cleansing performance is<br><br>
9 <br>
not satisfactory. Thus, many compositions of this type have been examined while changing the kind or amount of the oil ingredient or surfactant used. However, there no compositions have been provided that are satisfactory in terms of stability and pleasant feel on the skin.<br>
JP-A-10-219278 discloses compositions of anionic surfactants containing two long-chain acyl groups and two polar groups. The specification states<br>
 that the compositions can take the form of a gel or a paste if desired; however, it discloses only aqueous solutions of the compositions as cleansing agents and does not describe the gelatinous oil compositions at all.<br>
	Thus, the above described drawbacks of the<br>
prior art led to a second demand, that is, a gelatinous composition which contains oil ingredients in a stable manner and can have arbitrary hardness in a range of the hardness of a paste to that of a solid, thereby<br>
 overcoming the above described drawbacks.<br>
Traditionally, cosmetics such as creams, milks and lotions have been allowed to contain a relatively large amount of moisturizing agents such as various types of oil ingredients or glycerol so as to<br>
 leave the skin feeling moist or give the skin a<br>
sufficient moisturizing effect after their application. However, trying to leave the skin feeling further moist or giving the skin a better moisturizing effect often<br><br>
10 <br>
results in leaving the skin feeling excessively oily or sticky or makes the emulsified system unstable, which causes its separation with time, and hence the product deterioration. On the contrary, increasing the content of a surfactant so as to improve the stability of the emulsified system often results in increasing the irritation to the skin. Thus, it has been difficult to satisfy, at the same time, the moist feeling on the skin or the skin moisturizing effect of the<br>
 composition, the better feeling on the skin after the application of the composition, and the stability of the products of the composition.<br>
JP-A-10-2 03 956 discloses cosmetics which contain a polyhydric alcohol and an amide compound<br>
 having a specified structure, that excel in skin<br>
moisturizing effects, and will not feel sticky on the skin. However, the stability of its emulsified state is not fully satisfied.<br>
JP-A-10-218754 discloses cosmetics composed<br>
 of an anionic surfactant containing two long-chain acyl groups and two polar groups, powder and/or fine powder, and water. However, the cosmetics are not satisfactory with respect to stability, etc., though they feel better at the time of their application and have an<br>
 improved skin moisturizing effect.<br>
Thus, the above described drawbacks of the prior art led to a third demand, that is, cosmetics which excel not only in having a moist feeling on the a<br><br>
11<br>
skin and a skin moisturizing effect, but also in being stable in an emulsified state.<br>
There has been a tendency in recent years to use pigments, instead of dyes, as colorants for aqueous compositions for use in writing implements, recording instruments, printers or liquid cosmetics. This is because pigment colorants are superior in water resistance and light resistance. However, unlike dyes, pigments are insoluble or hardly soluble in water, and<br>
 therefore it is necessary to disperse pigments stably in water. As dispersants used for this purpose, various types of nonionic or anionic surfactants, cellulose derivatives, or water-soluble polymers such as nonionic polymers have been used independently or in<br>
 the form of a mixture. However, the method described above cannot disperse pigments well and is insufficient to cope with the occurrence of sedimentation or aggregation with time.<br>
In oil makeup cosmetics, etc., it is<br>
 generally necessary to disperse an inorganic pigment such as talc, mica, titanium dioxide or kaolin in an oil base material. However, such inorganic pigments are highly hydrophilic, and thus they do not disperse well in an oil base material, which causes problems<br>
 such as deterioration of product quality.<br>
For example, titanium dioxide is used in cosmetics to screen the skin from ultraviolet rays. The screening effect is produced when the particles of<br><br>
12<br>
titanium dioxide are in a finely dispersed state. Accordingly, if the particles are not dispersed well and aggregate, the effect becomes insufficient. In delivery apparatuses for writing implements, recording instruments, printers or liquid cosmetics,<br>
sedimentation of pigments may cause problems such as clogging of the delivery portions.<br>
JP-A-10-218754 discloses cosmetics composed of an anionic surfactant containing two long-chain acyl<br>
 groups and two polar groups, powder and/or fine powder, and water. However, the cosmetics are not satisfactory yet in respect to stability, etc., though they feel better at the time of their application and have improved moisturizing effect.<br>
	Generally, the affinity of dispersants varies<br>
depending on whether the pigment is hydrophilic or hydrophobic, and therefore the effectiveness of the dispersion also varies. As a result, there has been no dispersant composition which has satisfactory<br>
 dispersion stability to hydrophilic pigment and/or hydrophobic pigment.<br>
Thus, the above described drawbacks of the prior art led to a fourth demand, that is, a dispersant composition which has a high dispersion stability with<br>
 respect to hydrophilic powder and/or hydrophobic powder.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
13 <br>
As is apparent from the above description of "Background Art," an object of this invention is to provide an acyl group-containing composition, as an anionic surfactant that is less irritating to the skin or the like and has a sufficient surface activity even at low concentrations, which contains a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid derivative and forms a smaller amount of by-products, and therefore, does not cause coloration or turbidity when it takes the form of an aqueous solution, and to a process for easily producing the above described composition in a high yield. Another object of this invention is to provide a gelatinous composition that contains oil ingredients in a stable manner and can have arbitrary hardness in the range of the hardness of a paste to that of a solid.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide cosmetics which excel not only in having a moist feeling on the skin and a skin moisturizing effect, but also in being stable in an emulsified state.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a dispersant composition which has a high dispersion stability with respect to hydrophilic powder and/or hydrophobic powder.<br>
After directing tremendous research efforts toward the above described problems, the present inventors have ascertained that in the acyl group-<br><br>
14 <br>
containing compositions produced by conventional processes, there exists a reaction by-product, which is a characteristic of the compositions, besides the acyl compound as the intended end product. Thus they have found that (a) such a by-product is formed when a condensation reaction is carried out between a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride and one or more compounds which have a hydroxyl, thiol or amino group without a solvent or with a non-aqueous solvent, as described in the documents of the prior art; (b) the tendency toward the by-product formation grows with an increase in the reaction temperature; and (c) the larger the amount of the by-product contained in the acyl group-containing composition, the higher the degree of coloration or turbidity caused in the<br>
composition when in the form of an aqueous solution. Mass spectrometry of the by-product has shown that the molecular weight of the by-product is smaller than that of the acyl compound, as the intended product, by 18. This leads to the presumption that the by-product is the acyl compound after it has undergone dehydration (one molecule of H20) . Thus the by-product is defined herein as a "dehydrated acyl compound."<br>
The inventors tried to remove the dehydrated acyl compound from the acyl group-containing<br>
composition. Their attempt using, for example, chromatographic treatment increased the purity of the acyl compound to a considerable extent, but could not<br><br>
15 <br>
remove the dehydrated acyl compound. In other words, the method using chromatographic treatment can remove by-products other than the dehydrated acyl compound, but can hardly remove the dehydrated acyl compound. The reason that the dehydrated acyl compound is hard to separate by chromatographic treatment is probably because the polarity of the acyl compound and that of the dehydrated acyl compound are very close to each other.<br>
	So then, the inventors examined whether the<br>
formation of the dehydrated acyl compound itself can be retarded or not. Surprisingly, the examination revealed that in the process for producing the acyl group-containing composition of this invention in which<br>
 a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride is<br>
reacted with a compound having m functional groups of one kind or more selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups, when the reaction was carried out in a water-based solvent (aqueous solvent<br>
 and/or mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent), which is usually active to anhydrides, the formation of the above described dehydrated acyl compound could be significantly retarded. In other words, the reaction solution obtained through the above described reaction<br>
 was already colorless and clear before carrying out a by-product removing operation.<br>
Also surprisingly, the inventors have found that in the reaction process in a water-based medium,<br><br>
16 <br>
though the reaction uses an anhydride, an acyl group-containing composition as an object substance can be produced at low temperatures very effectively and in a very high yield, compared with conventional reactions carried out in an inert solvent. Employing a reaction process in which the reaction is carried out in an aqueous medium enables the production of an acyl group-containing composition free from coloration and of high purity without conducting a chromatographic treatment<br>
 after the reaction. Under conventional reaction conditions, in which no solvent or a non-aqueous solvent is used, the purity of the acyl group-containing composition in the reaction product is no more than about 60% by weight. On the other hand,<br>
 under reaction conditions in which an aqueous medium is used, an acyl group-containing composition with purity of 90% by weight or more can be easily obtained {this depends on other factors, though). The production process of this invention has overcome the problems of<br>
 the prior art just by using a water-based solvent as a reaction solvent and has further advanced the purity of the product in a very easy and simple way. This is a remarkable technological improvement in terms of industrial implementation.<br>
	Further, unexpectedly, the inventors have<br>
also found the following effects. In the production process of this invention, since the reaction is carried out in a water-based solvent, N-acyl acidic<br><br>
17 <br>
amino acid anhydride inevitably undergoes hydrolysis, and a very small amount of a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid or a salt thereof remains in the acyl group-containing composition. The very small amount of the long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid or the salt thereof remaining in the acyl group-containing composition lowers the Krafft point of the acyl group-containing composition and improves the stability, forming properties, lather creaminess, texture, feelings such<br>
 as the feeling at the time of washing and a refreshing feeling, and the thickening performance of a cleanser comprising an aqueous solution of the composition.<br>
The present inventors also directed their research efforts toward specifying the characteristics<br>
 of the acyl group-containing composition of this<br>
invention and have found several advantages thereof. They have ascertained, as one of the advantages, that the use of the acyl group-containing composition of this invention makes it possible to provide a<br>
 gelatinous composition that contains oil ingredients in a stable manner and in a gelatinous state without a gelling agent, excels in stability with time, and can have arbitrary hardness in the range of the hardness of a paste to that of a solid. Surprisingly, the<br>
 gelatinous composition obtained as above extremely excels in its dispersibility in water. Thus, the inventors have found that the gelatinous composition is a useful composition as a base material for cleansing<br><br>
18 <br>
agents, etc. which can be easily washed with water after application to the skin, do not remain on the skin after application and have an excellent afterfeel and that the gelatinous composition having a viscosity in a certain range has excellent spreading<br>
characteristics when applied on the skin or the like. They have also found that the appearance of the gelatinous composition is so transparent that the difference in the index of refraction between the water<br>
 phase that is composed of a surfactant, a polyhydroxyl compound and water and the oil phase composed of oil ingredients is small.<br>
They have ascertained, as a second advantage of the characteristics of the acyl group-containing<br>
 composition of this invention, that cosmetics<br>
containing a specified amount of the acyl group-containing composition excel not only in providing a moist feeling on the skin and a skin moisturizing effect, but also in their stability in an emulsified<br>
 state. They have also found that a very stable milky lotion can be produced by using an oil gelatinous composition composed of one kind or more acyl group-containing compositions of this invention, one or more polyhydroxyl compounds having 2 or more hydroxyl groups<br>
 per molecule and one or more oil ingredients.<br>
Further, the inventors have found a third advantage of the characteristics of the acyl group-containing composition of this invention, that is, the<br><br>
19 <br>
acyl group-containing composition has a high dispersion stability with respect to hydrophilic powder and/or hydrophobic powder.<br>
Specifically, the present invention is made up as follows.<br>
[1] A method of producing an acyl group-containing composition comprising a step of reacting a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride represented by the following formula (1): [Formula 1]<br><br>
wherein R1CO represents a long chain acyl group derived from a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid with 2 to 20 carbon atoms; R2 is hydrogen or a lower alkyl group with 1 to 3 carbon atoms which is optionally substituted with a hydroxyl or carboxyl group; j, k are independently any of 0, 1 and 2 and are not 0 at the same time, with one or more compounds having, per molecule, m functional groups of one kind or more selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups in an aqueous solvent and/or a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent, which is<br><br>
20 defined as reaction step,<br>
wherein the acyl group-containing composition comprises at least one acyl compound represented by the following general formula (2): [Formula 2]<br><br>
wherein R1CO, R2, and j, k each represent the same as those defined in the above formula (1); n (n is an integer of 2 to 20, including 2 and 20) Zs are bonding portions to which m (m&gt;n) functional groups of one kind or more selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups substituted on X bind and which are selected independently from the group consisting of -0-, -NR3- (R3 is hydrogen, or an alkyl, an alkenyl, an aryl or an alkylaryl group with 1 to 10 carbon atoms) and -S-; X is a spacer of a straight, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon chain of molecular weight of 1,000,000 or less which optionally has substituents other than hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups and contains or does not contain an aromatic hydrocarbon; n substituents represented by the following general formula (3): [Formula 3]<br><br>
21<br><br>
wherein reference characters each represent the same as those defined in the above formula (2), which are attached to X via Z are independent of each other; and Y represents a carboxyl group or the salt thereof.<br>

Now, a method for producing an acyl group-containing composition of this invention will be<br>
 described. The method includes a step of reacting a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride and a compound having, per molecule, m functional groups of one kind or more selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups in water and/or a<br>
 mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent.<br>
The present inventors have found that the above described reaction step produces the following effects. First, even if amino acids or saccharides, which are compounds slightly soluble in solvents other<br>
 than water, are used as ingredients, such ingredients, and besides, acyl compounds as products can be dissolved in the reaction solvent under reaction conditions of around room temperature or lower, and<br><br>
42 <br>
therefore the reaction solution can be kept in a uniform state until the reaction is completed. Thus, the reaction is allowed to progress under moderate conditions, which retards the formation of b?-products, resulting in the production of an acyl group-containing composition of high purity. Particularly the amount of dehydrated acyl compound, a b?-product which conventional processes cannot avoid, can be restricted to a very small amount.<br>
	A second effect is as follows. Since the<br>
production method of this invention uses a water-based solvent as a reaction solvent, there remains in the acyl group-containing composition a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid or a salt thereof, which is produced<br>
 by the inevitable hydrolysis of N-acyl acidic amino<br>
acid anhydride during the reaction. The inventors have found that this small amount of a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid or a salt thereof remaining in the acyl group-containing composition produces unexpected<br>
 effects. Specifically, the acyl group-containing<br>
composition of this invention is free from coloration, and besides, its following properties are improved due to the presence of the long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid or the salt thereof.<br>
 Lowers the Krafft point of the acyl group-containing composition, thereby improving its utility at low temperatures. Increases the solubility of the acyl group-containing<br><br>
43 <br>
composition in water, thereby make possible its use in a wider and lower pH range {particularly in the weak-acid range).<br>
	Improves the stability of cleansing agents composed of<br>
 the aqueous solution of the acyl group-containing<br>
composition.<br>
	Improves the forming properties of cleansing agents<br>
composed of the aqueous solution of the acyl group-<br>
containing composition and the creaminess of the<br>
 lather.<br>
	Makes finer the lather texture of cleansing agents<br>
composed of the aqueous solution of the acyl group-<br>
containing composition.<br>
	Improves the touch of cleansing agents composed of the<br>

aqueous solution of the acyl group-containing<br>
 composition.<br>
	Improves the thickening properties of an aqueous<br>
solution of the acyl group-containing composition with<br>
a thickening agent.<br>
From the viewpoint of the above described properties, preferably the acyl group-containing<br>
composition contains 0.5 to 30% by weight of a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid or the salt thereof, more preferably 1 to 15% by weight and much more<br><br>
44 preferably 1 to 10% by weight.<br>
A long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride represented by the general formula (1) and used in this invention is an acidic amino acid having been acylated by a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid residue with 2 to 20 carbon atoms which may be straight-, branched- or cyclic-chain. The amino group of the amino acid may be either N-methylated one or N-ethylated one. It does not matter which optically isomeric configuration the amino acid has. It may be a D-isomer, L-isomer or racemate.<br>
Examples of such amino acids include a long chain N-acylglutamic acid, asparagic acid, lanthionine, ß-methyllanthionine, cyctathionine, diencholic acid, felinine, aminomalonic acid, ß-oxyasparagic acid, ?a-amino-a-methylsuccinic acid, ß-oxyglutamic acid, ?-oxyglutamic acid, ?-methylglutamic acid, ?-methyleneglutamic acid, ?-methyl-?-oxyglutamic acid, a-aminoadipic acid, a-amino-?-oxyadipic acid, cc- aminopimelic acid, a-amino-?-oxypimelic acid, (3-<br>
aminopimelic acid, a-aminosuberic acid, a-aminosebacic acid and pantothenic acid. Of these acidic amino acids, L-acidic amino acids are preferable, because when using them, the resultant acyl grouß-containing composition of this invention excels in biodegradability.<br>
Long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydrides can be obtained easily by commonly used<br><br>
45 <br>
synthetic methods. For example, even crude crystals of a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride obtained by reacting a carboxylic acid anhydride such as acetic anhydride with a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid and then subjecting the reaction solution to crystal precipitation, filtration and drying can be directly applied to this invention.<br>
The reaction step in the production method of this invention can be carried out by, for example,<br>
 mixing a compound having m functional groups of one kind or more, which are selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, thiol and amino groups, and a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride, while stirring, in an aqueous solvent or a mixed solvent of<br>
 water and an organic solvent(s) (a single kind of or a mixture of more than one kind of organic solvent). The important point is that the compound having m functional groups of one kind or more selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups is<br>
 dissolved in the reaction solvent under the reaction conditions.<br>
When reacting an amino acid or saccharide with a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride by a conventional process, the ingredients have to be<br>
 reacted in such a state that they are dispersed in a solution, because there is no appropriate solvent. Accordingly, severe reaction conditions, for example, elevated reaction temperatures have to be employed. On<br><br>
46 <br>
the other hand, in the method of this invention where the reaction medium is a water-based one, reaction can be carried out under very moderate conditions. And the moderate reaction conditions allow the formation of by- products to be restrained to a minimum.<br>
The mixing ratio of water and an organic solvent applicable is in the range of 100/0 to 1/99 {volume ratio) and preferably 100/0 to 20/80 {volume ratio). The state of such a mixed solvent may be a uniform phase or non-uniform phase such as 2-phase as long as no precipitation occurs.<br>
Examples of organic solvent applicable include tetrahydrofuran, benzene, toluene, xylene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexane, dioxane and tertiary butanol. The organic solvent used in the production method of this invention need not be of high purity, and it may be a water-containing organic solvent produced as, for example, water azeotrope. Organic solvents recovered from a reaction purification system can also be used without purification.<br>
In the reaction step of the production method of this invention, the reaction temperature is not particularly limited; however, generally, lower reaction temperatures are advantageous, because the<br>
lower the reaction temperature becomes, the smaller the formation rate of the hydrolyzed product of a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride becomes.<br><br>
47 <br>
However, too low a temperature may cause an increase in viscosity of the reaction solution or a setting of the same, which results in an impossibility of mixing or a significant decrease in reaction rate. Thus, a reaction temperature should be selected from a<br>
temperature range that permits such situations to be avoided. The reaction temperature may be changed with time. Normally, the reaction temperature is in the range of -5 to 100°C, preferably in the range of 0 to 60°C and more preferably in the range of 5 to 40°C.<br>
In the reaction step of the production method of this invention, the concentration of each ingredient prepared is not particularly limited. However, the concentration should be such that it allows the operation of mixing under stirring to be carried out during the reaction. Preferably the concentration is 0.1 to 50% by weight in terms of solids concentration.<br>
In the reaction step of the production method of this invention, preferably the reaction is carried out while keeping the pH of the reaction solution in the range of 4 to 14. Alkaline substances used for adjusting the pH of the reaction solution include: for example, inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, barium hydroxide; and organic bases such as ammonia and<br>
organic ammonium. Preferably, an aqueous solution of an inorganic base is used.<br>
If the pH of the reaction solution is lower<br><br>
48 <br>
than 4, by-products due to the hydrolysis of a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride are increased whereas if the pH is higher than 14, a larger amount o alkaline substance than needed is consumed, and therefore the amount of acid consumed in the next step is also increased, though no substantial disadvantages occur. Thus, from the viewpoint of resource consumption, it is preferable to keep the pH of the reaction solution in the range of 4 to 14, more preferably in the range of 6 to 13 and much more preferably in the range of 9 to 12.<br>
In the reaction step of the production method of this invention, the reaction can be carried out in the following manner. Specifically, it can be carried out in a batchwise operation in which first, all of the prescribed amount of ingredients: one or more compounds<br>
selected from the compounds each having a hydroxyl, thiol or amino group; a solvent; and a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride are prepared in a stirring vessel, and then an alkaline substance is fed to the mixed solution to keep the pH of the solution in a specified range- Or it can be carried out in a semi-batch operation in which first, one kind or moze compounds having m functional groups of one kind or more, which are selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, thiol and amino groups and a solvent are prepared, and then a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride are continuously fed to form the mixed<br><br>
49 <br>
solution while feeding an alkaline substance to keep the pH of the solution in a prescribed range. Or it can be carried out in a continuous feeding operation in which first a reaction solvent is prepared, and then one or more compounds selected from the compounds each having a hydroxyl, thiol or amino group and a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride are continuously fed at the same time. The reaction solution in the stirring vessel in which a prescribed<br>
 amount of ingredients have been reacted can be provided for the next step, that is, the acid-precipitation and layer-separation step. When feeding a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride into the stirring vessel, the anhydride may be in the form of a powder or<br>
 a solid, or in the form of a solution of the powder or the solid in an inert organic solvent capable of dissolving the same or in the form of a slurry of the powder or solid dispersed in an inert organic solvent. A compound having m functional groups of one<br>
 kind or more, which are selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydroxyl, thiol and amino groups which are used in the reaction step of the production method of this invention are compounds that have a straight-chain, branched-chain or cyclic-chain hydrocarbon chain<br>
 of molecular weight of 1,000,000 or less, which<br>
contains or does not contain an aromatic hydrocarbon, and optionally have substituents other than hydroxyl, thiol and amino groups. As such compounds, compounds<br><br>
50 <br>
having a compound residue such as the above described X can be used. The compound having m functional groups of one kind or more, which are selected from the groups consisting of hydroxy1, thiol and amino groups is preferably a compound with 1 to 40 carbon atoms. It is preferable that such compounds independently have, per molecule, at least one carboxyl group, sulfonic acid group, sulfate ester group, phosphate ester group or a salt thereof, as a substituent(s) other than hydroxyl,<br>
 thiol and amino groups, because with such compounds,<br>
the acyl groub-containing composition of this invention excels in solubility in a weak-acid solution.<br>
In the reaction step of the production method of this invention, usually preferably the molar ratio<br>
 of the total functional groups contained in one kind or more compounds having, per molecule, m functional groups of one kind or more selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups to a long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid anhydride is 0.1 to<br>
 5. To produce an acyl group-containing composition of high purity with the least possible separation and purification treatment after the reaction, it is preferable to carry out the reaction in the molar ratio range of 0.5 to 2, though its depends on the purpose<br>
 for which the acyl group-containing composition of this invention is used. If the molar ratio is less than 0.5, the anhydride shows more tendency towards hydrolysis, which leads to an increase in the ratio of<br><br>
51 <br>
the long chain N-acyl acidic amino acid formation. On the other hand, if the molar ratio is higher than 2, the amount of the compounds having a hydroxyl, thiol or amino group that remain unreacted tends to be increased, and such impurities require separation and purification treatment depending on the purpose for which the acyl group-containing composition of this invention is used. The molar ratio is more preferably in the range of 0.6 to 1.4 and much more preferably<br>
 0.75 to 1.15.<br>
When employing the acid-precipitation and layer-separation step in the production method of this invention, the pH of the reaction solution obtained in the above described reaction step is adjusted to 1 to 6<br>
 by adding a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid to the solution, thereby separating the reaction solution into two layers, an organic layer and a water layer, allowing to obtain the organic layer, which includes an acyl group containing composition.<br>
 In the reaction solution, part of or all of the acyl<br>
group-containing composition formed exists in the form of an alkaline salt. Addition of a mineral acid allows part of or all of the carboxyl groups in the acyl group-containing composition to be free acid, thereby<br>
 separating the reaction solution into an organic layer and a water layer. In this process, inorganic salts, which are water-soluble impurities, and unreacted compounds each having a hydroxyl, thiol or amino group<br><br>
52 <br>
move to the water layer, thereby being removed from the acyl group-containing composition.<br>
In the acid-precipitation and layer-separation step, it does not matter whether an organic solvent is present or not. However, the presence of an organic solvent makes the layer separation more likely to occur, and therefore it is preferable to carry out the step in the presence of an organic solvent. For example, when the reaction in the reaction step is<br>
 carried out with an aqueous solvent alone, an organic solvent is added in the acid-precipitation and layer-separation step. Although the content of the organic solvent at the time of the acid-precipitation and layer-separation may be determined arbitrarily, the<br>
 content in the mixed solution is preferably 0.01 to 99% by weight.<br>
When using an organic solvent in the above described reaction step, the organic solvent may be used at the time of the acid-precipitation and layer-<br>
 separation as well. Other organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, .isopropanol, butanol and isobutanol may also be used. Two kinds or more of these solvents can be used in combination. In the following, the acid-precipitation and layer-separation<br>
 step will be described in detail in terms of a system where tertiary butanol alone is used as a preferable hydrophilic organic solvent.<br>
The dissociation state of carboxyl group<br><br>
53 <br>
changes depending on the pH of the reaction solution at the time of acid-precipitation and layer-separation. And the state of layer-separation, in other words, the weight ratio of the organic layer to the water layer or the removability of inorganic salts, changes a little with the change of the dissociation state of carboxyl group. Accordingly, preferably the reaction is carried out in the pH range of 1 to 3 and more preferably in the pH range of 1 to 2.5.<br>
	The temperature at the time of acid-<br>
precipitation and layer-separation is preferably in the range of 35°C to the boiling point of the hydrophilic organic solvent used. For example, when the hydrophilic organic solvent is tertiary butanol,<br>
 preferably the temperature is in the range of 35°C to 80°C and more preferably in the range of 40°C to 70°C. The reason of this is that if the temperature is lower than 3 5°C, it takes a longer time for the system to attain layer-separation equilibrium. Or even if the<br>
 system attains layer-separation equilibrium, a<br>
considerable amount of inorganic salts can sometimes remain in the organic layer, or layer separation cannot sometimes occur depending on the types of the acyl group-containing composition or its concentration in<br>
 the reaction solution. On the other hand, a<br>
temperature higher than 80°C is also disadvantageous, because if the temperature is higher than 80°C, boiling is more likely to occur since the boiling point of the<br><br>
54 <br>
azeotropic composition of water/tertiary butanol is near 80°C at a normal pressure.<br>
When employing a washing step in the production method of this invention, the washing step, which is mainly intended to remove impurities the acid-precipitation and layer-separation step cannot remove, may be carried out without the acid-precipitation and layer-separation step. Specifically, the acyl group-containing composition, tertiary butanol and water are<br>
 mixed so as to give a composition which can be<br>
separated into two layers, an organic layer and a water layer, and then water-soluble impurities, mainly inorganic salts or unreacted compounds each having a hydroxyl, thiol or amino group, in the organic layer<br>
 which includes the acyl group-containing composition are moved to the water layer by solvent extraction. Just like the above described acid-precipitation and layer-separation step, the step will be described in detail in terms of a system where tertiary butanol<br>
 alone is used as a hydrophilic organic solvent.<br>
The present inventors have found that a mixed solution of an acyl group-containing composition of this invention/tertiary butanol/water is separated into two layers, an organic layer that contains the acyl<br>
 group-containing composition, and a water layer, if<br>
only the composition of the mixed solution is adjusted so that it falls in a specified range. They have also found that the above layer separation makes it possible<br><br>
55 <br>
to remove the inorganic salts or unreacted compounds, each having a hydroxyl, thiol or amino group, in the organic layer. Specifically, if water and/or tertiary butanol is added to the organic phase formed in the acid precipitation and layer separation step so as to give a composition in which layer separation occurs, or tertiary butanol and/or water is added to the acyl group-containing composition that contains a large amount of impurities such as inorganic salts, layer<br>
 separation occurs in the system, thereby making it possible to remove the inorganic salts etc, in the organic layer.<br>
In both the acid-precipitation and layer-separation step and the washing step, the higher the<br>
 tertiary butanol concentration of the layer separation region becomes, the shorter the time required for the layer separation of the system becomes. Accordingly, it is preferable to increase the concentration of tertiary butanol within the concentration range that<br>
 permits layer separation. When employing the washing step, the washing temperature is 35 to 80°C and preferably 40 to 70°C for the same reasons having been described in terms of the acid-precipitation and layer-separation step.<br>
	To take out the acyl group-containing<br>
composition from the organic layer after layer separation, which contains only a decreased amount of water-soluble impurities such as inorganic salts, the<br><br>
56<br>
organic solvent is removed from the organic layer by<br>
fractional distillation or by crystallization of the<br>
organic layer by acidification and cooling, followed by<br>
filtration.<br>
	The fractional distillation of the organic<br>
solvent may be carried out in accordance with conventional procedures using a stirring vessel, or it may be carried out using a thin film evaporator, such as a falling film evaporator, centrifugal thin film<br>
 evaporator or agitated thin film evaporator, or using a spray evaporator. When removing the organic solvent by fractional distillation, the part of the carboxyl groups in the acyl group-containing composition may be neutralized or may not be neutralized before distilling<br>
 off the solvent. However, the fractional distillation which involves neutralization of part of the carboxyl groups in the acyl group-containing composition is preferable in that once the organic solvent is removed, a neutralized aqueous solution of the acyl group-<br>
 containing composition can be obtained directly.<br>
Since solutions including an acyl group-containing composition are foamable, it is not easy to carry out distillation efficiently on an industrial scale while inhibiting the foaming of solutions. In<br>
 this respect, distillation using a spray evaporator can be carried out efficiently even on an industrial scale. From that point of view, the process using a spray evaporator is preferable.<br><br>
57<br>
The distillation with a spray evaporator is to evaporate a solvent using, for example, an apparatus disclosed in JP-B-7-51201 in the following steps: draining a solution from the bottom of an evaporator can; circulating the solution to a heat exchanger by using a pump to overheat it to a prescribed extent; spraying the overheated solution in the inside of the can through piping provided on the top of the can. This method has the following characteristics: (1) in<br>
 the gas phase portion of the evaporator can, one or more nearly cylindrical tube tip is provided with its end facing the solution surface and is connected to the piping provided on the top of the can; (2) the overheated solution having been passed through the heat<br>
 exchanger is evaporated, until it reaches the tube tip, by controlling the flow rate of the solution in the heat exchanger and the overheated degree of the same at the outlet of the heat exchanger to obtain a gas-liquid two-phase flow; and (3) the amount of the overheat<br>
 remaining in the solution droplets having been sprayed through the tube tip is released in the gas phase portion until the droplets reach the surface of the liquid phase in the evaporation can.<br>
This method enables the production of an acyl<br>
 group-containing composition of considerably low degree of coloration and of high purity.<br>
The acyl compounds represented by the general formula (2) can be isolated from the acyl group-<br><br>
58 <br>
containing composition produced by the above described methods by properly adopting purification means known in the art.<br>
The acyl group-containing composition of this invention contains an acyl compound at a purity of 70% by weight or more. If the purity is low, the efficiency of the composition as a surfactant is decreased, or the desired physical properties of the acyl group-containing composition of this invention can sometimes be impaired. Further preferably, the purity of the acyl compound is 85% by weight or more.<br>
The acyl group-containing composition of this invention contains only a trace amount of dehydrated acyl compound product derived from an acyl compound, and preferably the content is 5% or less in terms of its area ratio to the acyl compound which is obtained by the analysis by high performance liquid chromatography using a detector at 205 nm. The dehydrated acyl compound is very hard to separate from the acyl compound, and once the dehydrated acyl<br>
compound is formed, it is very difficult to remove it completely by purification. When the acyl group-containing composition is used in the form of an aqueous solution, the lower the content of the dehydrated acyl compound, the less the turbidity or<br>
coloration of the aqueous solution. Thus, the content is preferably 3% or less and more preferably 1% or less (based on the above described analytical method).<br><br>
59 <br>
The acyl group-containing composition of this invention can be neutralized by a basic substance, and therefore it can be used as aqueous solutions having a wide pH region if its neutralization rate is adjusted. Preferably, the acyl group-containing composition is used in such a state that 0.2 to 2 equivalent of 1 equivalent of its dissociated group (carboxyl group) is neutralized (i.e., neutralization rate is 0.2 to 2). Preferably, the acyl group-containing<br>
 composition of this invention is such that when it is neutralized with, for example, sodium hydroxide and prepared into a 20% by weight aqueous solution of pH 10, the transmittances both at 430 nm and at 550 nm are 90% or more. Since occurrence of turbidity or<br>
 coloration in its aqueous solution lowers its value as a commercial product, it is preferable that either one of the transmittances is 90% or more and more preferably 95% or more.<br>
The acyl group-containing composition of this<br>
 invention can be used directly as a surfactant<br>
depending on the application for which the surfactant is used and can also be used in the form of an aqueous solution. The composition can sometimes be hard to handle as a solid at ordinary temperature depending on<br>
 its properties. In such a case, preferably it is handled in the form of an aqueous solution. For example, aqueous solutions containing the acyl group-containing composition can have a pH ranging from 3 to<br><br>
60 <br>
12. Preferably the pH of the aqueous solutions is adjusted to 4.5 to 11. The aqueous solutions prepared as above are less irritating to the skin and have remarkably excellent surface activity even at low concentrations. More preferably, the pH of the aqueous solutions is adjusted to 5 to 8.<br>
When the acyl group-containing composition of this invention is used in the form of a solution, the content of the acyl group-containing composition is not<br>
 particularly limited. The content can be 0.01 to 99% by weight and preferably 0.01 to 50% by weight, which is within the range that allows the composition to exert surface activity, depending on the application for which it is used.<br>
	The aqueous solution containing the acyl<br>
group-containing composition may contain another surfactant, such as an anionic, nonionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactant, depending on the situation. Above all, those containing a long chain N-acyl amino<br>
 acid or a salt thereof as an anionic surfactant in the aqueous solution in such an amount that (A) an acyl group-containing composition and (B) a long chain N-acyl amino acid or the salt thereof are contained in the mass ratio (A)/(B) of 1/100 to 100/1 in the aqueous<br>
 solution are preferable.<br>
The term "long chain N-acyl amino acid" herein used means an amino acid with an acyl group derived from a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid with<br><br>
61 <br>
8 to 20 carbon atoms introduced to its amino group. The amino acid residue in the long chain N-acyl amino acid may be an a-amino acid, ß-amino acid, ?-amino acid or ©-amino acid and the amino group may be a N-methyl group or N-ethyl group. It does not matter which<br>
optically isomeric configuration the acidic amino acid has. It may be a D-isomer, L-isomer or racemate.<br>
Examples of such amino acids include glutamic acid, asparagic acid, glycine, alanine, lanthionine, ß-<br>
 methyllanthionine, cyctathionine, diencholic acid,<br>
felinine, aminomalonic acid, ß-oxyasparagic acid, a-amino-a-methylsuccinic acid, ß-oxyglutamic acid, ?-oxyglutamic acid, ?-methylglutamic acid, ?-methyleneglutamic acid, ?-methyl-?-oxyglutamic acid, a-<br>

	The acyl group may be any acyl group as long<br>
as it is derived from a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid with 8 to 20 carbon atoms. It does not matter whether it is a straight-chain, branched-chain or cyclic-chain. From the viewpoint of biodegradability,<br>
 it is preferable that the a long chain N-acyl amino acid is a long chain N-acyl-L-amino acid.<br>
Typical examples of applications for which the acyl group-containing composition of this invention<br><br>
62 <br>
or aqueous solutions thereof are used are: raw materials for industrial cleaning agents and treatments, domestic detergents (for clothes, kitchen, house, tableware, etc.), cosmetics, foods, medicines, emulsifying (polymerization) agents, agricultural<br>
chemicals, textile processing agents (scouring agent, dye-assist agent, textile softener, water repellent), stainproofing agents, concrete admixtures, printing inks, lubricating oils, antistatic agents, anti-fogging<br>
 agents, lubricants, dispersants and deinking agents. These are useful applications where the characteristics of this invention, such as less coloration in products, less irritation to the skin, surface activity at low concentrations, moisturizing<br>
 performance, pigment dispersion stability, detergency, high emulsifying stability, low loading on environment due to biodegradability, are made good use of. When using the acyl group-containing composition of this invention for these applications, it is prepared into<br>
 formulas (e.g. cosmetic compositions) depending on the applications for which it is used. The amount of the acyl group-containing composition blended in a formula is not particularly limited, and it can be in the range of 0.01 to 99% by weight and preferably in the range of<br>
 0.01 to 50% by weight depending on the application.<br>
The acyl group-containing composition of this invention can be used as solutions having a pH, for example ranging widely from 3 to 12, preferably as solutions<br><br>
63<br>
having a pH ranging from 4.5 to 11 and more preferably<br>
as solutions having a pH ranging from 5 to 8 by<br>
adjusting the neutralization rate of the composition<br>
with a basic substance.<br>
	When using the acyl group-containing<br>
composition of this invention as formulas for various applications, it can take the form of a liquid, a solid, a gel, a paste or a mist depending on the purpose for which it is used.<br>
	The acyl group-containing composition of this<br>
invention and the aqueous solution thereof are used as materials for cosmetics.<br>

 stipulated in Pharmaceutical Affairs Law.<br>

 as tetrose such as erythrose, threose and erythrulose, pentose such as ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, xylulose and ribulose, hexose such as allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, tarose, fructose, sorbose, psicose and tagatose; and<br>

	Such polyhydroxyl compounds may be other<br>
saccharide residues such as heptose, deox?-saccharides, amino-saccharides, thio-saccharides, seleno-saccharides, aldonic saccharides, uronic acid, sugar<br><br>
67 <br>
acid, ketaldonic acid, anhydrosugars, unsaturated sugars, sugar esters, sugar ethers and glycoside, or polysaccharides such as starch, glycogen, cellulose, chitin and chitosan, or hydrolyzed products thereof. The combination of two kinds or more of these<br>
polyhydroxyl compounds may also be used. Preferable polyhydroxyl compounds are those with valence of 3 or more.<br>
Preferably, the cosmetics containing the acyl<br>
 group-containing composition of this invention contain one kind or more acyl group-containing compositions and a polyhydroxyl compound, wherein the content of the polyhydroxyl compound is 0.001 to 40% by weight and the content of the acyl group-containing composition is<br>
 10/1 to 1/100 in terms of the weight ratio to the polyhydroxyl compound. If the content of the polyhydroxyl compound is less than 0.001% by weight, the cosmetics leave the skin feeling less moist and the moisturizing effect of the composition is hard to<br>
 exert, whereas if the content of the polyhydroxyl<br>
compound is higher than 40% by weight, the cosmetics leave the skin feeling stickier. If the amount of the acyl group-containing composition is less than 1/100 in terms of the weight ratio to the polyhydroxyl compound,<br>
 the cosmetics are likely to give users feeling of<br>
stickiness coming from the polyhydroxyl compound and other ingredients, whereas if the amount is more than 10/1, the cosmetics are likely to give users feeling of<br><br>
68 <br>
stickiness coming from the acyl group-containing composition. More preferably, the content of the polyhydroxyl compound is 0.1 to 30% by weight and the content of the acyl group-containing composition is 5/1 to 1/50 in terms of the weight ratio to the<br>
polyhydroxyl compound. Much more preferably, the content of the acyl group-containing composition is 5/1 to 1/20 in terms of the weight ratio to the polyhydroxyl compound.<br>
	In the cosmetics containing the acyl group-<br>
containing composition of this invention, use of oil ingredients is preferable, because they provide moisturizing and emollient effects on the skin.- As oil-ingredients, either liquid oil or solid fat may be used<br>
 and those commonly used as ingredients for cosmetics or medicines for external application may also be used.<br>
Examples of oil ingredients include volatile and non-volatile ones, specifically they include: oils and fats such as avocado oil, almond oil, olive oil,<br>
 cacao oil, sesame oil, safflower oil, soybean oil,<br>
camellia oil, persic oil, castor oil, grape seed oil, macadamia nut oil, mink oil, cottonseed oil, Japan tallow, coconut oil, yolk oil, palm oil, palm stone oil, glyceryl triisooctanoate, glyceryl tri-2-<br>
 ethylhexanoate and cholesterol fatty acid ester; waxes such as spermaceti, carnauba wax, candellia wax, jojoba seed oil, bee wax, lanolin and the derivatives thereof; hydrocarbons such as liquid paraffin, paraffin,<br><br>
69 <br>

 lanolin alcohol and hexyldecanol; higher alcohol fatty acid esters such as isopropyl myristate, octadecyl myristate, 2-octyldodecyl myristate, cetyl 2-ethylhexanoate, diisostearyl malate, isostearyl isostearate, isostearyl cholesteryl ester and<br>
 butylstearate; and silicone oils such as (di)methyl silicone, methyl phenyl silicone, amino modified silicone and cyclic silicone. These oil ingredients may be used in combination of two kinds or more. Cosmetics that contain the acyl group-<br>
 containing composition of this invention can be<br>
produced by mixing, while stirring, an acyl group-containing composition, a polyhydroxyl compound and, if necessary, water and an oil ingredient. Particularly when producing an oil ingredient-containing emulsion<br>
 such as a milky lotion, a later-described process is preferably used in which cosmetics are produced by emulsifying an acyl group-containing composition, a polyhydroxyl compound and an oil- and gelatinous-<br><br>
70 <br>
composition that contains an oil ingredient. Specifically, oil- and gelatinous-compositions are very easily brought to the stable emulsified and dispersed state when they are stirred with water added thereinto; and therefore, cosmetics are produced only by adding water to oil- and gelatinous-compositions. To produce cosmetics that further excel in a moist feeling or moisture retaining effect and are in the stable emulsified state, a process is preferable in which not only water, but also a polyhydroxyl compound, a higher alcohol or oil ingredients are properly added to the above described gelatinous composition depending on the situation.<br>
The cosmetics that contain the acyl group- containing composition of this invention obtained as above are characterized by excellent moist feeling, excellent moisture retaining effects and being capable of keeping a very stable emulsified state over time. Cosmetics that contain the acyl group- containing composition of this invention can be applied to, for example, a milky lotion, a cream, a lotion and a skin lotion, along with those intended to cleanse the skin, such as a cleansing lotion, a facial cleansing preparations and a body shampoo. Cosmetics that contain the acyl group-containing composition of this invention can take various forms such as a liquid, a paste, a gel and an aerosol, depending on desire. When using the acyl group-containing<br><br>
71 <br>
composition of this invention as a blended composition, preferably the composition is used as a gelatinous composition that contains the acyl group-containing composition, a polyhydroxyl compound and oil ingredients.<br>
Examples of polyhydroxyl compounds having 2 or more hydroxyl groups per molecule and applicable to the gelatinous composition of this invention include those described above. In the gelatinous composition of this invention, polyhydroxyl compounds with valency of 3 or more are preferably used.<br>
Polyhydroxyl compounds may be used in combination of two kinds or more and polyhydroxyl compounds with different valencies, for example, polyhydroxyl compounds of 2-valency and 3-valency may also be used in combination.<br>
Examples of oil ingredients used in the<br>
gelatinous composition of this invention include those<br>
described above.<br>
	The gelatinous composition of this invention<br>
contains one kind or more acyl group-containing compositions, one or more polyhydroxyl compounds having 2 or more hydroxyl groups per molecule and one or more oil ingredients, and preferably the water content in the gelatinous composition is 50% by weight or less and the composition of the gelatinous composition is such that 1) the total amount of acyl group-containing composition(s) is 0.1 to 40% by weight, 2) the total<br><br>
72 <br>
amount of polyhydroxyl compound(s) is 1 to 60% by weight and 3) the total amount of oil ingredient (s) is 1 to 95% by weight. The contents of acyl group-containing compositions, polyhydroxyl compounds and oil ingredients herein mentioned each indicate the total sum of the respective ingredients. If the water content is outside this range, the gel state of the composition cannot sometimes be kept stable. The water content is more preferably 30% by weight or less and<br>
 much more preferably 20% by weight or less.<br>
Even if the content of each ingredient is outside the above described range, the composition can sometimes take the gel form. However, such gelatinous composition can sometimes be poor in stability due to<br>
 the separation of oil ingredients, be poor in gel<br>
forming performance, have decreased detergency, or have an unfavorable after feel depending on the purpose for which it is used.<br>
In the gelatinous composition of this<br>
 invention that contains an acyl group-containing composition(s), the composition of acyl group-containing composition(s), polyhydroxyl compound(s) and oil ingredient(s) is more preferably such that 1} the total amount of surfactant(s) is 1 to 25% by weight, 2)<br>
 the total amount of polyhydroxyl compound(s) is 5 to 40% by weight and 3} the total amount of oil ingredient(s) is 20 to 80% by weight and much more preferably 1) the total amount of surfactant(s) is 3 to<br><br>
73 <br>
15% by weight, 2) the total amount of polyhydroxyl compound(s) is 5 to 30% by weight and 3) the total amount of oil ingredient(s) is 30 to 70% by weight. In the production of the gelatinous composition of this invention, to obtain one whose appearance is transparent, it is preferable to allow the difference in refractive index at 20°C between the water phase, which is composed of an acyl group-containing composition(s), a polyhydroxyl compound(s)<br>
 and water, and the oil phase, which is composed of an oil ingredient(s), to be ± 0.05 or less. If the difference in refractive index between the two phases is outside the range, one whose appearance is transparent cannot be obtained. The closer the<br>
 difference in refractive index between the two phases comes to 0, the better. More preferably the difference is ± 0.03 or less and much more preferably 0.01 or less. It is particularly preferable that the difference is 0.<br>
	The gelatinous composition of this invention<br>
is produced by mixing, while stirring, an acyl group-containing composition(s), a polyhydroxyl compound(s), an oil ingredient(s) and, depending on the situation, water under high shear stress. A preferred production<br>
 process is to fully mix, while stirring, the<br>
ingredients other than the oil ingredient(s) and then add the oil ingredient(s) to the mixture little by little.<br><br>
74 <br>
The gelatinous composition of this invention obtained as above has excellent characteristics of: 1) being highly capable of forming a gelatinous composition and keeping a stable gel state over time, 2) having a wide range of viscosity, 3) being easily fine-dispersed and brought to an emulsion state when water is added, and 4) being easily washed with water when used as a cleansing agent such as a cleansing preparation and leaving no residue on the skin while leaving the skin feeling refreshed.<br>
Typical examples of suitable applications of the gelatinous composition of this invention are: various external preparations, gel base materials, and cleaners. Examples of external preparations include: various kinds of cosmetics such as a cream or a gel for facial washing/cleansing, a cold cream, a vanishing cream or a moisturizing cream; skin or hair care cosmetics such as massage gel and hair dressings; and drugs such as antiphlogisties or gelatinous pharmaceuticals, or vermin repellent. Examples of<br>
inclusion/carrier type of gel base materials include: sustained-release perfume gels in which perfume or an absorbent/adsorbent such as activated carbon is included/dispersed; deodorizing gel base materials; and in addition, pesticides and bath agents in which the water-dispersibility of the materials is made good use of. The gelatinous composition of this invention can also be used as cleaners, in which its characteristic<br><br>
75 <br>
of absorbing oil ingredients is made good use of, such as cleaners for oil stains in the kitchen and around gas ranges, cleaners for oil stains on machines, cleaners for hands, and cleaners for coated surfaces on metals of cars etc., coated surfaces on woods of family Buddhist altars/Buddhist altar<br>
fittings/wardrobes/desks, etc., plastic surfaces of<br>
electric appliances such as TVs/personal computers and<br>
glass surfaces.<br>
	When used for cleansing agents the gelatinous<br>
composition that contains the acyl group-containing composition of this invention, those whose viscosity at 25°C is in the range of 1000 to 200000 mPa-s are preferably used because they spread smoothly when applied to the skin etc. The gelatinous compositions whose viscosity at 25°C is in the range of 3000 to 60000 mPa s are more preferably used<br>
When using the acyl group-containing composition of this invention as a blended composition, preferably it is used as a dispersant composition that contains the acyl group-containing composition.<br>
The dispersant composition that contains the acyl group-containing composition of this invention prevents hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic powder from aggregating, and therefore, excels in dispersion<br>
stability. Such a dispersant composition can be used with various pigments in the following application fields, specifically including, pigments in the water-<br><br>
76 <br>
based/non-water-based coating fields; those in the pigment/printing ink fields, such as titanium white, red iron oxide, aluminum powder, talc, carbon black, azo pigment and phthalocyanine, those in the pigment/cosmetic fields (including bath agents), such as carbon black, azo pigment and phthalocyanine; those in the pigment/reinforced rubber, plastic fields, such as talc, (fine-grained) titanium oxide, titanium, mica, alumina, bentonite, red iron oxide, zinc laurate, zinc<br>
 stearate, zinc oxide, chromium oxide, ultramarine,<br>
Prussian blue, iron oxide, kaolin, sericite, safflower pigment and cochineal extract; those in pigment/fiber, dyeing fields, such as clay, calcium carbonate, silica, carbon black and phthalocyanine; pigment printing,<br>
 disperse dye/cement, concrete fields; cement/coated paper coating color fields; pigment/optical catalyst fields, such as calcium carbonate, talc, titanium oxide and clay; and ultra fine particle titanium oxide. Examples of other pigments include: inorganic pigments<br>
 such as cobalt blue, chromium green, chromium oxide, silicic acid anhydride and magnesium aluminate silicate; organic pigments such as powdered skin of fruits or nuts, powdered Japanese cypress, polyethylene powder, polymethylsilsesquioxane powder, Hansa yellow,<br>

77 <br>
silicate, zinc cadmium sulfide, calcium sulfide, strontium sulfide and calcium tungstate; and other known organic fluorescent pigments.<br>
The dispersant composition that contains the acyl group-containing composition of this invention may or may not contain water. It may take the form of a solid, a liquid or a paste which is simply a mixture of the acyl group-containing composition, a pigment, etc. It can be used in the form of: pigment coated with the<br>
 acyl group-containing composition; pigment to which the acyl group-containing composition is sealed using a polymer etc. as a matrix; pigment bearing the acyl group-containing composition; or pigment chemically binding to the acyl group-containing composition<br>
 directly or via a crosslinking agent or the like.<br>
In the dispersant composition that contains the acyl group-containing composition of this invention, preferably the percentage of the acyl group-containing composition to a pigment is 0.01% by weight<br>
 or greater, more preferably 0.1% by weight or greater, and much more preferably 1% by weight or greater. A larger percentage of the acyl group-containing composition to the pigment in the dispersant composition makes the dispersant composition more<br>
 stable, as long as there is no other problem. However, if the amount exceeds 500% by weight, there can sometimes be created problems depending on the application; for example, when the dispersant<br><br>
78 <br>
composition is applied to ink, the water resistance of the ink can sometimes deteriorate.<br>
A pigment dispersant can be produced with the dispersant composition of this invention by mixing, while stirring, the dispersant composition, a pigment and a dispersion medium with a dispersion mixer commonly used such as a ball mill, roll mill, sand mill, flow mill, dyno-mill, attritor, homomixer, homogenizer or high-speed disperser. The mixing while<br>
 stirring can be carried out at an ordinary temperature or with heating, depending on the situation.<br>
The acyl group-containing composition of this invention is also useful for cleansing agent compositions. With the acyl group-containing<br>
 composition of this invention, a cleansing composition can be provide which is capable of decreasing surface tension even at low concentrations, is less irritating to the skin, and excels in forming properties and a refreshing afterfeel. The acyl group-containing<br>
 composition of this invention is characterized in that when it is dissolved in water to prepare a dilute aqueous solution and used to wipe sebum off one's face, it leaves the face skin feeling smooth. Further, because the composition itself has a moisture retention<br>
 performance, it can be used a moisturizer.<br>
The acyl group-containing composition of this invention can be used together with various kinds of base materials depending on the application and purpose<br><br>
79 for which it is used.<br>

In the following this invention will be described in detail giving examples. [Example 1]<br>
(Reaction step)<br>
First, 9.1 g (0.05 mol) of L-lysine hydrochloride was mixed in 57 g of water. Then, 31.1 g (0.1 mol) of N-lauroyl-L-glutamic acid anhydride was added to the mixed solution under stirring over 2<br>
hours, while adjusting the pH of the mixed solution in the range of 10 to 11 using a solution of 25% sodium hydroxide in water and keeping the reaction temperature at 5°C, to allow the reaction to progress. (Acid-precipitation and layer-separation step)<br>
After continuing another 30-minute stirring, tertiary butanol was added so that its concentration in the mixed solution was 20% by weight, and 75% sulfuric<br><br>
91 <br>
acid was added dropwise to adjust the pH of the solution to 2 while adjusting the temperature of the solution to 65°C. After completion of the sulfuric acid addition, stirring was stopped, and the mixed solution was left stand at 65°C for 20 minutes so that the solution was separated into an organic layer and a water layer. Then the organic layer was isolated. (Washing step)<br>
Tertiary butanol and water were added to the<br>
 isolated organic layer to prepare a mixed solution having a composition of acyl compound/tertiary butanol/water = 33/25/42 (% by weight). The mixed solution was stirred at 65°C for 20 minutes. After stopping stirring, the mixed solution was left stand at<br>
 65°C for 20 minutes so that the solution was separated into an organic layer and a water layer. Then the operation of washing the resultant organic layer with water was repeated to remove the solvent from the organic layer. Thus, 34.6 g of acyl group-containing<br>
 composition was yielded. The analytical results are shown in Table 1. [Example 2]<br>
The same steps as those of Example 1 were carried out under the same conditions except that in<br>
 the reaction step, a mixed solution of water and<br>
tertiary butanol (concentration of tertiary butanol was 20% by weight) was used instead of water and N-lauroyl-D-glutamic acid anhydride was used instead of N~<br><br>
92<br>
lauroyl-L-glutamic acid anhydride to yield 33.8 g of<br>
acyl group-containing composition. The analytical<br>
results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[Example 3]<br>
	The same steps as those of Example 1 were<br>
carried out under the same conditions except that in the reaction step, 7.2 g of octanediamine was used instead of 9.1 g of L-lysine hydrochloride, the reaction temperature was changed to 55°C and the pH<br>
 range to 11 to 12 to yield 32.9 g of acyl group-containing composition. The analytical results are shown in Table 1. [Example 4]<br>
The same steps as those of Example 1 were<br>
 carried out under the same conditions except that in the reaction step, 33.9 g of N-myristoyl-L-glutamic acid anhydride was used instead of 31.1 g of N-lauroyl-L-glutamic acid anhydride, the reaction temperature was changed to 15°C and the pH range to 12 to 13 to yield<br>
 37.1 g of acyl group-containing composition. The analytical results are shown in Table 1. [Example 5]<br>
The same steps as those of Example 1 were carried out under the same conditions except that in<br>
 the reaction step, 31.1 g of N-cocoyl-L-glutamic acid anhydride was used instead of 31.1 g of N-lauroyl-L-glutamic acid anhydride and 3.0 g of ethylenediamine was used instead of 9.1 g of L-lysine hydrochloride to<br><br>
93 <br>
yield 29.0 g of acyl group-containing composition. The analytical results are shown in Table 1. [Example 6]<br>
The same steps as those of Example 1 were carried out under the same conditions except that in the reaction step, 3.53 g of N-palmitoyl-L-asparagic acid anhydride was used instead of 31.1 g of N-lauroyl-L-glutamic acid anhydride and a mixed solution of water and toluene (concentration of toluene was 30% by<br>
 weight) was used instead of water and 30°C of the<br>
reaction temperature was used instead of 5°C to yield 38.3 g of acyl group-containing composition. The analytical results are shown in Table 1. [Comparative Example 1]<br>
	Just like Example 9 described in JP-A-2002-<br>
167313, 31.1 g {0.1 mol) of N-lauroyl-L-glutamic acid anhydride was added to 400 mL of toluene and stirred at 95°C. Then, 3.7 g {0.05 mol) of 1,3-propanediamine was added dropwise to the mixed solution over 2 hours.<br>
 After completing the addition of 1,3-propanediamine,<br>
the mixed solution was stirred 1 hour, and toluene was distilled off from the solution to obtain 33.1 g of an acyl group-containing composition. It was then purified by chromatography to yield 23.0 g of acyl<br>
 group-containing composition. The analytical results are shown in Table 1. [Comparative Example 2]<br>
The same operations as those of comparative<br><br>
94 <br>
Example 1 were carried out under the same conditions except that 7.3 g of L-lysine was used instead of 3.7 g of 1,3-propanediamine to yield 25.0 g of acyl group-containing composition. The analytical results are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
95<br><br><br>
96 [Example 7]<br>
The composition obtained in Example 1 was neutralized with sodium hydroxide to prepare an aqueous solution of solid content 30% by weight and pH 6.5. The aqueous solution was dried to produce powder of neutralized acyl group-containing composition. [Example 8]<br>
The composition obtained in Example 5 was neutralized with sodium hydroxide to prepare an aqueous solution of solid content 30% by weight and pH 7.5. The aqueous solution was dried to produce powder of neutralized acyl group-containing composition. [Examples 9 to 22, Comparative Examples 3 to 6]<br>
Gelatinous compositions shown in Table 2 were produced, and the stability, utility, viscosity and transparency were evaluated for each of the compositions. The results are shown in Table 2. The composition are shown in % by weight. (Production process)<br>
All of the gelatinous compositions were prepared by the following process.<br>
The ingredients other than oil ingredients were mixed at 70°C while stirring the mixture. Then, the oil ingredients were slowly added dropwise to the mixture while stirring. The mixture was further stirred and cooled to yield a gelatinous composition.<br><br>
97<br><br><br>
98<br><br><br>
99<br><br><br>
100 [Examples 23-24]<br>
The gelatinous composition produced in Example 21 was stirred at 70°C, the oil phase portion was added to the composition while stirring at 70°C, the remaining water phase portion was added to 100 parts by weight in all, and the mixture was cooled to produce a formulation. The stability and afterfeel were evaluated. The results are shown in Table 3. The compositions in Table 3 are shown in terms of % by weight. [Comparative Example 7]<br>
The oil phase portion and the water phase portion shown in Comparative Example 7 in Table 3 were respectively heated to 70°C and dissolved, then the oil phase portion was mixed and emulsified with the water phase portion, and the mixture was cooled to yield a formulation. The stability and afterfeel were evaluated for the formulation. The results are shown in Table 3. The formulation composition in Table 3 is shown in terms of % by weight.<br><br>
101<br><br><br>
102 [Reference Example 1]<br>
The moisture absorption rate under high humidity and the moisture retention rate under low humidity were evaluated for the composition produced in Example 7 and urea as a contrast. Specifically, 1 g of dried sample was dried in a weighing bottle and weighed precisely, and left stand in a desiccator under relative humidity as high as 84% at 25°C while measuring the sample weight with time until 313 hours has elapsed. Then, the same sample was transferred into a desiccator under relative humidity as low as 33% at 25°C , and left stand in the desiccator while measuring the sample weight with time in the same manner as above considering the point 313 hours has elapsed as a test starting point (0 hr). The moisture absorption rate was obtained in accordance with the following equation. Moisture absorption rate {%) = (Wt - WO/WO) x 100 WO: dry weight before being left stand, Wt: weight at the time of each measuring<br>
The results are shown in Table 4. Urea showed its deliquescent properties during the course of moisture absorption, but once it was left stand under low humidity, it released almost all its moisture. On the other hand, the acyl group-containing composition produced in Example 7 did not have deliquescent properties and showed high moisture retention compared with urea.<br><br>
103 [Table 4]<br><br>
[Examples 25 to 26, Comparative Example 8]<br>
A skin lotion was prepared using the acyl group-containing composition produced in Example 7 so that it has a composition shown in Table 5 and evaluation was conducted for the skin lotion. The results are shown in Table 5. The composition in Table 5 is shown in terms of % by weight.<br>
The skin lotion prepared using the acyl group-containing composition produced in Example 7 had an excellent afterfeel.<br><br>
104 [Table 5]<br><br>
[Example 27]<br>
The composition produced in Example 7 was used as a dispersant. The dispersant was added to 300 ml of purified water so that the solid content concentration was 0.01% by weight, fine-grained titanium oxide (ISHIHARA SANGYO KAISHA, LTD.; "TTO-55(A)", trademark) as a pigment was added to the above solution so that the solid content concentration was 1% by weight, and the mixed solution was stirred and dispersed for 2 minutes with a homomixer at 10000 rpm and normal temperature. The dispersion was left stand at 40°C and the transmittance of the supernatant at 300 nm was measured with time. The results are shown in Table 6.<br>
Since the fine-grained titanium oxide exerts its ultraviolet ray screening effect when being<br><br>
105 <br>
dispersed, smaller transmittance measurements indicate that the titanium oxide is neither aggregated nor precipitated, but stably dispersed. From this point of view, the composition of Example 27 has excellent dispersion stability. [Comparative Examples 9 to 11]<br>
The transmittance of the supernatant at 300 nm was measured with time in the same manner as Example &amp;&amp; except that the dispersant used in Example 27 was replaced by the following ones . The results are shown in Table 6.<br>
Comparative Example 9; sodium lauroylglutamate<br>
Comparative Example 10; polyethyleneglycol{20} monostearate<br>
Comparative Example 11; polyoxyethylene(20) sorbitanmonolaurate<br><br>
106<br><br><br>
107 <br>
[Example 28, Comparative Examples 12 to 13]<br>
The transmittance of the supernatant was measured with time under the same conditions as Example 27 except that activated carbon (Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., trademark: "Shirasagi") was used as a pigment instead of fine-grained titanium oxide, the dispersant used in Example 27 was replaced by the following ones and the transmittance was measured at 300 nm and at 660 nm. The results are shown in Table 7. Smaller transmittance measurements indicate that the activated carbon is neither aggregated nor precipitated, but stably dispersed. From this point of view, the composition of Example 7 has particularly excellent dispersion stability.<br>
