Surface-modified, aerogel-type, structured silica<br>
The invention concerns a surface-modified, aerogel-type, structured silica.<br>
Aerogels are understood to be silica gels having a low bulk density (approx. 20 to 50 q/l\   and high macroporosity (DBP) numbers from 200 to 400). Due to the contraction effect described by R: iler, which leads to a collapse of the pore structure during the drying of silica gels from the aqueous phase, silica aerogels are only obtainable by the method described by.Kistler in US-PS 2,249,767. To this end Kistler partially debaters silica sols with alcohols and then dries the water-containing alcogel in an autoclave by expansion under supercritical conditions. In this way 'he obtains particularly loosely constructed structures consisting of the primary particles of the silica sol, which display high volume values in the macropore range (&gt;300-A) combined with a very low apparent density (bulk density)...<br>
Depending on their degree of porosity and bulk density, these substances, which are classed as an aerogel, are used as fillers, support silicas, flatting agents, thickeners, etc. The necessary use of organic solvents and the supercritical drying to be performed in an autoclave make the process for producing these aerogels both technically complicated and expensive.<br>
It is known that the stated disadvantages of the methods available until now for the production of aerogels can be avoided if primary particles of pyrogenically produced silicas are used in place of the silica sol particles and recovery from the liquid phase -is omitted.<br>
The primary particles of pyrogenic silica occur in beds, loosely associated by means of electrostatic and van der Waals forces.<br><br>
They .agglomerate into floes, which display a high air content and thus have a very high apparent pore volume and correspondingly a low bulk density.<br>
A bed of these floes is best described as an air dispersion. The floes are unstable, however, and unlike the secondary particles in Kistler aerogels they are broken down into primary particles under the slightest mechanical loading.<br>
The use of aerogel-type structured silica as a flatting agent in surface coatings, such as paints for example, is known (DE 24 14 478).<br>
The invention provides an aerogel-type, structured silica which is characterized in that it is surface-modified.<br>
An aerogel-type, -structured silica according to DE 2 414 873 for example can be used as the starting silica.<br>
The starting silica for the surface modification can also be an aerogel-type structured silica having the following material parameters:<br>
BET surface area between 80 and 450 m2/g Bulk density between 10 and 60 g/1 DBP number between 200 and 400<br>
pH from 6 to 8<br>
The aerogel-type structured silica	can be produced by<br>
incorporating 5-50 wt.% water into	air-dispersed pyrogenic<br>
silica with uniform dispersion and	drying the powdered<br>
mixture that is obtained.<br>
Since the volume of silica reduces only slightly as the water is incorporated, it can be assumed that the originally existing association of the primary particles of the air-dispersed pyrogenic silica is substantially<br><br>
retained. The loading with water probably leads to a partial dissolution of the silica surface, such that dissolved silica is present here.<br>
During the subsequent drying process this bonds the primary particles to their points of contact.<br>
Selective loading with water and subsequent drying from a pyrogenic silica thus produces a dispersible substance corresponding to the Kistler aerogels, having a high macropore volume and very low apparent density (bulk density).<br>
It was also established that the apparent structure existing before incorporation of the water, determined by the packing density of the pyrogenic silica in air and expressed by its apparent density (bulk density), has a marked influence on the product that can be obtained by the process according to the invention: the more voluminous the starting product, the mere voluminous the end product.<br>
Pyrogenically produced silica is known from Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der technischen Chemie 4 th Edition, Volume 21, page 462 ff.<br>
It can be produced by flame hydrolysis of volatile or evaporable silicon compounds, such as e.g. SiCl4, methyl trichlorosilane and others, in an oxyhydrogen flame.<br>
It has proven convenient to use pyrogenic silica with a bulk density of 10 to 60,.  preferably 15 to 30, in particular around 20 g/i, to produce the products according to the invention.<br>
It has also proven advantageous to choose pyrogenic silica with large surface areas and hence small primary particles. According to a favorable embodiment of the process according to the invention, silica with BET surface areas of between 100 and 480, in particular 250 to 300 m2/g, is used.<br><br>
Complete wetting of the primary particles can be achieved by incorporating as little as 5 to 20, in particular 7 to 1!5 wt.% water into the silica with uniform distribution. Since the water that is incorporated is to be removed again by drying, it is 'desirable for economic reasons to minimize the amount of water. The amount required depends to a certain extent on the type of incorporation, however.<br>
Structure formation by the process according to the invention can be noticeably promoted if basic-reacting compounds, such as e.g. ammonia, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, water-soluble amines, water glass or the like are added to the water. The amounts to be added are conveniently chosen such that a pH of 7 to 14, preferably 8 to 12, in particular 10 to 11, is established in the water.<br>
The alkalis used act as a solution aid for silica and bring about an increase in the macroporosity of the process products.<br>
Instead of alkaline compounds, free silica or hydrolytic silica and/or substances that release alkali can also be added to the water.<br>
Free silica produced for example by acidification or ionic exchange of silicate solutions or by hydrolytic cleavage of organosilicon compounds, for example tetramethyl silicate, likewise promotes structure formation.<br>
A substance that releases alkali and silica hydrolytically is sodium methyl siliconate, for example.<br>
The water can be uniformly dispersed in the silica by dropping or spraying it into the silica, which is kept in motion by mixing, at silica temperatures -of between 20 and 100, preferably 40 to 70, in particular 50 to 60 °C. The mixing motion is conveniently achieved by stirring.<br><br>
A further variant of water incorporation consists of spraying the water into a mass flux of silica fluidized in a downpipe for example.<br>
It has further proven advantageous to perform the water<br>
loading at moderately elevated temperatures.<br>
This can be done by preheating either the water to be<br>
incorporated or the silica or both components. Thus the<br>
water to be incorporated can be at a temperature of between<br>
20 and 100, preferably 50 to 100, in particular 90 to<br>
100 °C.<br>
Structure formation can also be promoted by brief steaming of the loaded silica in a closed room.* Steaming leads to a particularly good water distribution. It has proven favorable in this respect to steam the water-loaded silica before drying for approx. 5" to 6C, preferably'10 to 30, in particular around 20 minutes, in a closed vessel at temperatures up to the boiling point of water, preferably 50 to 80, in particular around 60 °C.<br>
A further possibility for improving the water distribution consists of grinding the water-loaded silica in a pin mill or air jet mill for example.<br>
It is then dried, whereby the preformed structure is presumably fixed by primary particles that are partially dissolved at the surface or that are coated at the surface with free silica.<br>
The type of drying is not of critical importance. The mixture of silica and water that has been produced, which in phenomenological terms always resembles a dry powder, can be dried for example in chamber, disk, Buttner, flow or microwave dryers. However, the water-loaded silica can also be ground and dried simultaneously, avoiding a separate process stage, in a steam jet :r air jet mill.<br><br>
If the powdered mixture obtained after loading with water is dried 'separately, this can be followed by dry grinding in a pin mill or air jet mill.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the production of the surface-modified, aerogel-type, structured silica; which is characterized in that an aerogel-type, structured silica is prepared, optionally sprayed first with water or with acidified'"water and then with the silanizing agent, which can optionally be dissolved in a solvent, post-mixed and the mixture' conditioned.<br>
Ethanol for example can be used as the solvent for the silanizing agent. Conditioning can be performed batchwise in a drying oven, for example, or continuously. Conditioning can optionally be performed under a protective gas atmosphere.<br>
Once spraying has been completed, post-mixing is continued for a further 15 to 30 min and conditioning then performed for 1 to 4 h at 100 to 400 °C.<br>
The water used can be acidified with an acid, for example hydrochloric acid, to a pH of 7 to 1.<br>
Silanization can be performed by spraying the silica with the silanizing agent at room temperature and then subjecting the mixture to a thermal treatment at a temperature of 105 to 400 °C for a period of 1 to 6 h.<br>
An alternative method for silanizing the silica can be performed by treating the silica with the silanizing agent in vapor form and then subjecting the mixture to a thermal treatment at a temperature of 200 to 800 °C for a period of 0.5 to 6 h.<br>
The thermal treatment can be performed under protective gas, such as nitrogen for example.<br><br>
Silanization can be performed in heatable mixers and dryers with sprayers, on a continuous or batchwise basis. Examples of suitable devices include plough mixers, disk dryers, fluidized bed or moving bed dryers.<br>

Determination of the physico-chemical properties<br>
BET surface area<br>
The BET surface area is determined with nitrogen in accordance with DIN 66 131•<br>
Compacted bulk density<br>
Determination of compacted bulk density by reference to DIN ISO 787/XI<br>
Principles of determining compacted bulk density The compacted bulk density (previously compacted bulk volume) equals the quotient of the mass and volume -of a powder after tamping in a tamping volumeter under established conditions. According to DIN ISO 7 87/XI the compacted bulk density is stated in g/cm3. Due to their very low compacted bulk density, the value for oxides is stated in g/1. Drying, screening and repetition of the tamping process are omitted.<br>
Equipment for determining compacted bulk density<br>
Tamping volumeter<br>
Measuring cylinder<br>
Laboratory balance (sensitive to 0.01 g)<br>
Method for determining compacted bulk density 200 ± 10 ml oxide are introduced into the measuring cylinder of the tamping volumeter such that no voids remain and the surface is horizontal.<br>
The mass of the sample introduced into the cylinder is determined to an accuracy of 0.01 g. The measuring cylinder with the sample is placed in the measuring cylinder holder in the tamping volumeter and tamped 1250 times. The volume of the tamped oxide is read off to an accuracy - of 1 ml.<br><br><br>
pH<br>
The pH is determined in a 4 % aqueous dispersion,<br>
in water : methanol 1:1 in the case of hydrophobic oxides.<br>
Reagents for determining pH<br>
Distilled or demineralized water, pH &gt; 5.5<br>

Beaker, 250 ml<br>
Magnetic stirrer<br>
Magnetic rod, length 4 cm -<br>
Combined pH electrode<br>
pH meter<br>
Dispensette, 100 ml<br>
Procedure for determining pH<br>
The determination is performed by reference to DIN/ISO<br>
787/IX:<br>
Calibration: Before measuring the pH the meter is<br>
calibrated with the buffer solutions. If several<br>
measurements are performed successively, a single<br>
calibration is sufficient.<br>
4 g hydrophilic oxide are placed in a 250 ml beaker with 96 g (96 ml) water using a Dispensette and, with the pH electrode immersed, stirred for five minutes with a magnetic stirrer (speed approx. 1000 rpm).<br>
4 g hydrophobic oxide are mixed into a paste with 48 g (51 ml) methanol in a 250 ml beaker and the suspension diluted with 48 g (48 ml) water and, with the pH electrode<br><br>
immersed, stirred for five minutes with a magnetic stirrer (speed approx. 1000 rpm).<br>
After turning off the stirrer the pH is read after a standing time of one minute. The result is expressed to one decimal place.<br>
Loss on drying<br>
In contrast to the weighed amount of 10 g as stated in DIN ISO 787 II, a weighed amount of 1 g is used to determine the loss on drying.<br>
The cover is fitted before cooling. A second drying stage is not performed.<br>
Avoiding dust formation, approx. 1 g of the sample is weighed to an accuracy of 0.1 mg into a weighing pan with a ground-glass cover, said pan having been dried at 105 °C, and dried in a drying oven for two hours at 105 °C. It is reweighed after being cooled in the desiccator over blue gel with the lid in place.-<br>

The result is expressed to one  decimal place.<br>
Ignition loss<br>
Equipment for determining ignition loss<br>
Porcelain crucible with crucible lid<br>
Muffle furnace<br>
Analytical balance (sensitive to 0.I mg)<br>
Desiccator<br><br>
Method for determining ignition loss<br>
Deviating' from DIN 55 921, ,0.3 - 1 g of the un-predried<br>
substance is weighed to an-accuracy of 0.1 mg into a<br>
previously ignited porcelain crucible with crucible lid and<br>
ignited for 2 hours at 1000 °C in a muffle furnace.<br>
Care should be taken to avoid dust formation. It has proven<br>
favorable for the weighed samples to be placed into the<br>
muffle furnace when it is still cold.<br>
The slow heating of the furnace avoids any major air<br>
turbulence in the porcelain crucible.<br>
Once a temperature of 1000 °C is reached, ignition is<br>
continued for a further 2' hours. The crucible is then<br>
covered with a lid and the weight loss determined over blue<br>
gel in the desiccator.<br><br>

-Switch on the plastograph without the metering pump.<br>
-Switch on the kneader (press both start buttons simultaneously).<br>
-With the "Cal" key pressed down, press the "Funk" key-once; the display alternates between the current zero point and "Lo S.C".<br>
-Press the "Cal" key again; after four seconds (calibration) the instrument displays the current total range "10000" and "Fu S.C".<br>
-Press the "Cal" key again; after four seconds (calibration) the instrument displays the friction-corrected zero point "tare".<br>
-Press the "Cal" key again and wait for 5 sec.<br>
-If necessary carry out the "Cutoff point" and<br>
"Calibration process" steps once a day before measurements.<br><br>
3. Measurement<br>
12.5 g of the sample are weighed into a plastic beaker<br>
and poured into the mixing chamber. If instructed, a<br>
different weighed amount can also be used (e.g. 8 or<br>
20 g). The DBP metering unit is switched on- As soon<br>
as the filling process has been completed (display F),<br>
the plastograph is ready for operation.<br>
Start the measurement by pressing the start buttons<br>
simultaneously.<br>
The metering unit delivers 4 ml DBP/min until the<br>
preset cutoff point (1000) is reached.<br>
The device switches off automatically.<br>
The consumption of DBP can then be read from the<br>
display of the metering unit.<br><br><br><br>
