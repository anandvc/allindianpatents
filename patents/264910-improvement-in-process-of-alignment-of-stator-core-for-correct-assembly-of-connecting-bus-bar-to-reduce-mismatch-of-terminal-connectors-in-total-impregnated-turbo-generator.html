				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to improvement in process of alignment in the filed<br>
of stators for electrical rotating machines in general, and particularly to alignment<br>
of stator core winding of turbogenerators.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART:<br>
Total VPI Turbo Generators are being manufactured in one place and Stator Core<br>
and Stator Frame are manufactured in separate manufacturing facility. Stator Core<br>
is manufactured outside in vertical condition. Two numbers core bars (diagonally<br>
opposite) have three numbers locating pins on each. Three numbers Spring<br>
Baskets (each in two halves) are assembled over core guided by two diagonally<br>
opposite locating holes in each basket. Each of each half basket is stretched and<br>
welded. Core is made horizontal and centerlines are marked. Winding brackets are<br>
welded and it is sent for assembly of stator windings. After this Connecting Bus<br>
Bars are assembled. A fixture is used for assembly of Connecting Bus Bar. It is<br>
mounted on extreme ring of Spring Basket on exciter end (EE) of core. Distances<br>
of palm of connecting bus bar is maintained with respect to core and assembled.<br>
Wound Core is totally impregnated, cured. Ready wound core is placed on C-Beam<br>
after alignment of verticality of spring basket holders. Stator Frame is inserted<br>
over wound stator with the help of crane, aligned with core and bushes are welded<br>
to spring basket holders and springs for load transfer. Then it is shifted on test bed<br>
and<br><br>
Terminal Box, Terminal Bushings are assembled. Finally, connecting links are<br>
assembled between terminals of Connecting bus bars and terminal bushings.<br>
The following problems are faced during the above process:<br>
(A) Mismatch of ends of Terminal Connectors -<br>
Since assembly of spring basket is a fitting job, its plane does not remain<br>
perpendicular to axis of Stator Core. This results in to mis-matching of palm of<br>
connecting bus bar (6 numbers) with connecting links coming from Terminal<br>
Bushings (6 numbers). The order of mis-match is about 30 to 40 mm. It requires<br>
many more Man-Hours to correct the mis-match in position and assemble.<br>
(B) Interference between Bush and Spring Holder Plate -<br>
Sometimes bush was found to interfere with a collar on Spring holder. Due to this<br>
a step had to be machined on bushes to accommodate assembly.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION:<br>
The process was analysed at different stages in detail starting from machining of<br>
Spring Baskets &amp; core assembly up to insertion of wound core into stator frame.<br>
Reasons for problems were narrowed down to following assemblies:<br>
1.	Machining of spring basket<br>
2.	Measurement of parallelity of spring basket holder<br>
3.	Assembly of fixture for mounting connecting bus bars<br>
4.	Insertion of wound core into stator frame<br>
To overcome the drawbacks of the prior art, innovative remedial actions were<br>
undertaken to improve it.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
(a)	Machining of Spring Baskets-<br>
Three number Spring Baskets are used after core assembly to apply radial<br>
pressure on stator core to make it monolithic. Each spring basket has two<br>
diametrically opposite holes having diameter in the range 20-25 mm preferably 21<br>
mm.<br>
(1)	Process Requirements -<br>
Location of these holes are very important because these are used for locating<br>
spring baskets on core. Two numbers core bars (diametrically opposite) has pins<br>
where the holes locate the basket (makes spring holder vertical and horizontal<br>
with respect to core axes). Variation in this dimension will make spring holders<br>
more inclined leading to interference of Bush with collar on the spring basket.<br>
Improvement Process Implemented -<br>
Control marking was introduced for the holes and all chord values were recorded<br>
before drilling. Locations of holes were ensured by control marking.<br>
(b)	Alignment of center of top &amp; bottom slot with vertical plane and<br>
Measurement of parallelity of spring holders on spring baskets -<br>
Stator core is made horizontal after assembly of spring baskets. Centre of<br>
top and bottom stator slots are aligned with vertical plane and<br>
measurements of parallelity of six vertical spring holders are taken with<br>
respect to vertical plane. So these values are to be used as reference for all<br>
further operations. Parallelity of machined spring holders holders on spring<br>
baskets are ensured to be within limits.<br>
Process requirements -<br>
Centre of top and vertical slots to be set in vertical plane.<br>
(2)	Measurement of parallelity of six vertical spring basket holders<br>
with respect to vertical plane so that when these values are<br><br>
reproduced, it will set the center of top and bottom slots in<br>
vertical plane.<br>
(ii) Improved Process Implemented -<br>
A plumb was dropped on Exciter end side from center of top core bar and<br>
core was rotated on rollers to bring center of bottom core bar in line of the<br>
plumb. The center of top and bottom slots were also observed to be in line of<br>
plumb and minor correction was carried out by rotating the core on rollers.<br>
Measurement of parallelity of six vertical spring holders was carried out with the<br>
help of square sprit level (size 200x200) at the center of machined face of<br>
spring holder and recorded. This value of setting was used for all further<br>
operations.<br>
(c)  Alignment of connecting bus bar mounting fixture on stator core<br>
Locations of terminals of connecting bus bar are defined in the drawing<br>
with respect to vertical and horizontal centerline of stator core. Therefore,<br>
x,y, and z co-ordinates (Fig. 1) of terminal of connecting bus bar should be<br>
controlled with respect to vertical and horizontal planes and axial center of<br>
stator core.<br>
I.   Process requirements -<br>
1.	Longitudinal axis of core should be horizontal.<br>
2.	Fixture Beam should be assembled perpendicular to the axis of<br>
core (Fig-2).<br>
3.	Top face of beam should be aligned with x-z plan<br>
in both z-direction and x-direction<br>
4.	Height of the fixture should be maintained at specified height with<br>
respect to a reference plane.<br><br>
5. Actual length of core should be taken in to account while<br>
adjusting distance between palm of connecting bus bars<br>
along axial direction .<br>
(ii) Earlier process described as under, has the following drawbacks -<br>
Fixture (Fig-4) is assembled on the extreme ring of spring basket on Exciter<br>
End with the assumption that plane of the ring is perpendicular to z-axis of the<br>
core. But this is not true due to following reasons -<br>
a)	When spring basket is assembled on the stator core, the position of ring<br>
deviates from that of desired position by about 8 to 10 mm along its<br>
whole periphery in spite of all efforts.<br>
b)	Fixture mounting holes are dependent upon how accurately basket has<br>
been assembled which in turn depends upon actual drilled location of<br>
21mm radial holes.<br>
c)	It is not ensured that top plane of beam is parallel to xz-plane as shown<br>
in the diagram.<br>
It means that ring of the basket can not be taken as a reference for<br>
assembly of fixture beam. Since, stampings of core is punched to a very<br>
close tolerance, centerline of top core bar can be taken as reference and<br>
beam should be aligned with this.<br><br>
(iii) Improved Process implemented -<br>
Following improved process were adopted for setting and aligning of fixture<br>
beam for improved assembly of connecting bus bar -<br>
1.	Fixture beam for assembly of connecting bus bar was improved. In following<br>
way-<br>
(a)	A close tolerance slot was machined at center of fixture beam in<br>
perpendicular direction to its length. (Fig.5)<br>
(b)	A    special    rectangular   alignment    beam    was    designed    and<br>
manufactured for alignment of fixture beam with center of top core<br>
bar.<br><br>
2.	Stator core is placed on tow pairs of rollers. Height of the rollers were<br>
checked with a sprit level and found to be alright.<br>
3.	Stator core was rotated before mounting of fixture such that parallelity<br>
values were achieved as measured earlier in step b-(ii) after taking care that<br>
top of core is placed now at bottom for assembly of connecting bus bar.<br>
4.	Centreline was marked on top core bar and bottom spring holder on exciter<br>
end side.<br>
5.	Rectangular steel bar was fixed in the slot of fixture beam.<br>
6.	Fixture beam was assembled on extreme ring of spring basket on exciter<br>
end side.<br>
7.	A plumb was dropped from edge of rectangular beam at two locations (first<br>
near to beam and next at far end of rectangular bar) and it was aligned with<br>
cecterline of top core bar by placing packers at mounting locations of fixture<br><br>
between fixture and spring basket ring. This has aligned the beam perfectly<br>
perpendicular to core axis<br>
8.	A sprit level was placed on top surface of fixture beam in both x and z<br>
direction (Fig.2) and its surface was aligned parallel to x-z plane by<br>
assembling a few packers below fixture. Height of the beam was also set as<br>
per requirement.<br>
9.	Now the beam is perfectly ready for further assembly of connecting bus bars<br>
(Fig. 6)<br>
(d) Alignment of wound core on C-beam -<br>
Impregnated wound core is placed on C-beam with line joining center of top<br>
and bottom slot aligned with vertical. Stator Frame is inserted over wound<br>
core with the help of crane, aligned and bushes are welded,<br>
(i)   Process Requirements -<br>
Vertical centerline of core should be in vertical plane,<br>
(ii) Improved Process Implemented -<br>
Wound core is to be placed on C-beam in such a way so that<br>
values of parallelity of spring holders matches with earlier<br>
measurements carried out in step b-(ii). This makes the<br>
centerline of top and bottom slot aligned with vertical. Stator<br>
Frame is inserted over the wound core. Alignment is done for<br>
achieving desired radial gaps between stator wall and ring of<br>
spring basket at specified locations. Bushes are inserted and<br>
welded.<br><br>
