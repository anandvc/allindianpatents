				<td>AQUEOUS COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING METRONIDAZOLE<br>
The invention pertains to the field of topically applied<br>
medications for treatment of skin and mucosal disorders. In<br>
particular, the invention pertains to aqueous compositions<br>
containing metronidazole as the active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Metronidazole, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-5-<br>
nitroimidazole, has long been known as an effective drug to<br>
treat a variety of disorders, and is especially well known for<br>
the treatment of various protozoal diseases. As a topical<br>
therapy, metronidazole has also been shown to be useful in<br>
treating various skin disorders, including acne rosacea,<br>
bacterial ulcers, and perioral dermatitis. See, Borgman, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,837,378. Metronidazole has been found to have an<br>
anti-inflammatory activity when used topically to treat<br>
dermatologic disorders. See, Czernielewski, et al., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,849,776. Metronidazole may also be used as an<br>
intravaginal therapeutic agent for the treatment of bacterial<br>
vaginosis. See, Borgman, U.S. Patent No. 5,536,743.<br>
Compositions containing metronidazole for treatment of<br>
dermatologic disorders are available in cream, lotion and gel<br>
forms. One commercially available metronidazole cream<br>
product, NORITATEJ (Dermik Laboratories, Inc., Collegeville,<br>
PA 19426 USA) contains 1% metronidazole in which the insoluble<br>
drug is suspended in the opaque cream. A commercially<br>
available metronidazole gel product, METROGEL7 (Galderma<br>
Laboratories, Inc. Fort Worth, Texas, 76133 USA), contains<br>
0.75% metronidazole which is solubilized to produce a clear<br>
gel.<br>
For the treatment of many dermatologic and mucosal<br>
disorders, it is often preferable to use a solubilized water-<br>
based formulation, such as a gel, rather than a cream, lotion<br>
or an ointment. Creams, lotions (typically oil in water<br>
emulsions) and ointments (typically petroleum jelly based<br>
compositions) are often comedogenic, acnegenic, or not<br>
cosmetically appealing to patients. Solubilized topical<br>
products are generally more bioavailable than products in<br>
which the active ingredient is insoluble.<br>
The oil-based cream and ointment metronidazole<br>
formulations have an advantage over presently available gel-<br>
based formulations in that oil-based formulations may contain<br>
a concentration of metronidazole of 1%. Aqueous-based gel<br>
compositions are limited to a concentration of metronidazole<br>
of 0.75% because of the poor solubility of metronidazole in<br>
water.<br>
Cyclodextrins have been shown to enhance the solubility<br>
of various drugs in aqueous solutions. An amphiphilic or<br>
lipophilic drug, such as metronidazole, is partially or<br>
completely enclosed within this cage structure, thereby<br>
increasing the solubility of the drug in aqueous media.<br>
Cyclodextrins have certain disadvantages, however, including<br>
expense, limitations of cyclodextrin solubility,<br>
incompatibility in certain vehicles, and potential for local<br>
and systemic toxicity.<br>
Several authors have described the use of beta-<br>
cyclodextrin (BCD) in combination with metronidazole. Kata<br>
and Antal, Acta Pharmaceutica Hungarica, 54:116-122 (1984),<br>
disclose a marked increase in the rate of dissolution of<br>
metronidazole when dissolved in a solution containing BCD at<br>
37Â°C. The stability of the BCD/metronidazole solutions is not<br>
addressed. Major problems with the use of BCD to solubilize<br>
drugs such as metronidazole is that BCD has a relatively low<br>
solubility in water and is a relatively inefficient<br>
solubilizer, particularly for lipophilic or amphiphilic drugs<br>
such as metronidazole. Additionally, cyclodextrins, such as<br>
BCD and its derivatives, are expensive and the drug<br>
formulations containing BCD as a solubilizing agent likewise<br>
become expensive. A need exists for a way to increase the<br>
solubility of drugs which requires a reduced concentration of<br>
BCD.<br>
Solubility enhancing agents other than cyclodextrins have<br>
been described. Yie W. Chien, Journal of Parenteral Science<br>
and Technology, 38(l):32-36 (Jan. 1984), discloses that<br>
niacinamide is a solubility enhancing agent that can increase<br>
the water solubility of MTZ. Chien further discloses that the<br>
water soluble vitamins ascorbic acid, and pyridoxine are<br>
solubility enhancing agents for aqueous solutions. Chien<br>
discloses that the solubility of metronidazole in water<br>
increases linearly with relation to the concentration of these<br>
water soluble vitamins in the solution. The Chien article is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. The prior art does not<br>
address the combination of cyclodextrins, such as BCD, with<br>
other solubility enhancing agents, such as niacinamide or<br>
other water soluble vitamins.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been surprisingly discovered that the combination<br>
of a cyclodextrin and a second solubility enhancing agent,<br>
such as niacinamide or niacin, has a synergistic effect on the<br>
aqueous solubility of amphiphilic or lipophilic chemical<br>
compounds such as metronidazole. The second solubility<br>
enhancing agent may be other than niacinamide or niacin. The<br>
synergistic effect provided by the combination of cyclodextrin<br>
and the second solubility enhancing agent permits the use of<br>
lower concentrations of cyclodextrins than would be necessary<br>
o obtain a desired level of solubility of the chemical<br>
compound in the absence of the second solubility enhancing<br>
agent. Because cyclodextrins are expensive, has limited<br>
aqueous solubility, and is not entirely free of toxicity, the<br>
invention provides an important way to greatly reduce costs in<br>
the formulation and preparation of pharmaceutical<br>
preparations, as well as to increase the solubilizing<br>
capability of cyclodextrins such as BCD, and to obtain desired<br>
concentrations of pharmacologic compounds while minimizing the<br>
amount of cyclodextrins used..<br>
As used herein, the term Asolubility enhancing agent@ or<br>
Asolubility enhancer means a chemical compound that, when<br>
present in solution in a solvent, increases the solubility of<br>
a second chemical compound, such as an active ingredient, in<br>
the solvent, but which chemical compound is not itself a<br>
solvent for the second chemical compound.<br>
All concentrations referred to in this specification are<br>
% w/w, unless indicated otherwise.<br>
The invention is described below with reference to a<br>
particular cyclodextrin, BCD, and a particular chemical<br>
compound, metronidazole. It is conceived, however, that the<br>
invention is applicable to other cyclodextrins, both<br>
crystalline and non-crystalline, including alpha and gamma<br>
cyclodextrins, and crystalline and non-crystalline derivatives<br>
thereof, and other amphiphilic and lipophilic chemical<br>
compounds besides metronidazole.<br>
Physically stable aqueous solutions of higher than 0.75%<br>
metronidazole (MTZ) may be obtained by combining in the<br>
solution a first solubility enhancing agent which is a<br>
cyclodextrin, such as beta-cyclodextrin (BCD),. and a second<br>
solubility enhancing agent, such as niacinamide or niacin.<br>
The combination of the cyclodextrin and the second solubility<br>
enhancing agent provides a synergistic effect in increasing<br>
the solubility of MTZ in water. These discoveries permit the<br>
production of aqueous MTZ solutions, including solutions that<br>
are gels, at levels of 1% MTZ or higher. At such levels, MTZ<br>
may be effectively used as a topical medicament.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention is an aqueous solution<br>
having a concentration of MTZ higher than 0.75% w/w,<br>
preferably about 1% or higher. The aqueous solution contains<br>
a cyclodextrin, such as BCD, as a first solubility enhancing<br>
agent and a second solubility enhancing agent, such as niacin<br>
or niacinamide. Preferably, the level of each of the<br>
cyclodextrin and the second solubility enhancing agent is less<br>
than that which, in the absence of the other solubility<br>
enhancing agent, would provide for a dissolved concentration<br>
of the MTZ to the level of that present in the aqueous<br>
solution. If desired, however, the solution may contain an<br>
excess of the second solubility enhancing agent. Most<br>
preferably, the enhanced solubility of MTZ in the combination<br>
solution is higher than the sum of the enhanced solubilities<br>
of MTZ in two solutions, each of which contains a single<br>
solubility enhancer at the concentration present in the<br>
combination solution. Preferably, the solution is<br>
substantially free of aqueous solubility-enhancing agents<br>
other than a cyclodextrin and the second solubility enhancing<br>
agent. Preferably, the solution is an aqueous gel.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is a method for the<br>
manufacture of an aqueous solution of MTZ having a<br>
concentration greater than 0.75%, preferably about 1.0% or<br>
higher. The method includes combining MTZ and two solubility<br>
enhancing agents, one of which is a cyclodextrin such as BCD,<br>
in a water based solution wherein the concentration of the<br>
final aqueous solution of MTZ is higher than 0.75%.<br>
Preferably, the level of each of the cyclodextrin and the<br>
second solubility enhancing agent is less than that which, in<br>
the absence of the other solubility enhancing agent, would<br>
provide for a dissolved concentration of the MTZ to the level<br>
of that present in the aqueous solution. If desired, however,<br>
an excess of the second solubility enhancing agent may be<br>
used. Most preferably, the enhanced solubility of MTZ in the<br>
combination solution is higher than the sum of the enhanced<br>
solubilities of MTZ in two solutions, each of which contains a<br>
single solubility enhancer at the concentration present in the<br>
combination solution. Preferably, a gelling agent is further<br>
combined in the solution, preferably after addition of the MTZ<br>
and the solubility-enhancing agents.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is a method for the<br>
treatment of a dermatologic or mucosal disorder. The method<br>
includes topically applying to affected areas an aqueous<br>
solution of MTZ and a cyclodextrin, such as BCD, and a second<br>
solubility enhancing agent, such as niacin or niacinamide.,<br>
which solution has a concentration of MTZ higher than 0.75%,<br>
preferably about 1.0% or higher. Preferably, the level of<br>
each of the cyclodextrin and the second solubility enhancing<br>
agent is less than that which, in the absence of the other<br>
solubility enhancing agent, would provide for a dissolved<br>
concentration of the MTZ to the level of that present in the<br>
aqueous solution. If desired, however, the solution may<br>
contain an excess of the second solubility enhancing agent.<br>
Most preferably, the enhanced solubility of MTZ in the<br>
combination solution is higher than the sum of the enhanced<br>
solubilities of MTZ in two solutions, each of which contains a<br>
single solubility enhancer at the concentration present in the<br>
combination solution. Preferably, the aqueous solution is a<br>
gel.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is a kit for the<br>
treatment of a dermatologic or mucosal disorder. The kit of<br>
the invention includes a container that contains an aqueous<br>
solution of MTZ and which aqueous solution contains a first<br>
solubility enhancing agent which is a cyclodextrin, such as<br>
BCD, and a second solubility enhancing agent such as niacin or<br>
niacinamide. Preferably, the level of each of the<br>
cyclodextrin and the second solubility enhancing agent is less<br>
than that which, in the absence of the other solubility<br>
enhancing agent, would provide for a dissolved concentration<br>
of the MTZ to the level of that present in the aqueous<br>
solution. If desired, however, the solution may contain an<br>
excess of the second solubility enhancing agent. Most<br>
preferably, the enhanced solubility of MTZ in the combination<br>
solution is higher than the sum of the enhanced solubilities<br>
of MTZ in two solutions, each of which contains a single<br>
solubility enhancer at the concentration present in the<br>
combination solution. Preferably, the aqueous solution is a<br>
gel.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of a<br>
preferred embodiment of the kit of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been unexpectedly discovered that stable aqueous<br>
solutions of metronidazole (MTZ) of greater than 0.75% w/w,<br>
and even about 1.0% or higher, are able to be obtained by<br>
using a combination of solubility-enhancing agents, wherein<br>
one of the solubility enhancing agents is a cyclodextrin, such<br>
as BCD, and the second solubility enhancing agent is other<br>
than a cyclodextrin. Examples of suitable second enhancing<br>
agents include niacin and niacinamide.<br>
As used in this specification, the term Astable refers<br>
to physical, rather than chemical, stability. In accordance<br>
with the invention, the metronidazole solutions of the<br>
invention are physically stable, that is substantially no<br>
crystal or precipitate from solution, when stored at<br>
refrigerated temperatures of 5EC for at least 7 days.<br>
The physically stable aqueous solutions of metronidazole<br>
at concentrations greater than 0.75% are obtained without the<br>
substantial presence of water-miscible organic solvents, such<br>
as ethyl alcohol or propylene glycol, which may be irritating<br>
to intact or damaged skin or mucosal surfaces. The<br>
elimination of these organic solvents provides a therapeutic<br>
solution that has decreased potential for irritation and makes<br>
the solutions especially good for treating topical<br>
dermatologic conditions, such as rosacea, that may be worsened<br>
by irritating chemicals present in a therapeutic formulation.<br>
However, if desired, such organic solvents may be included in<br>
the solution, up to a concentration of about 10%. In a most<br>
preferred embodiment, the aqueous solutions are substantially<br>
free of organic solvents for MTZ.<br>
The stable aqueous MTZ solutions of the invention have a<br>
concentration of MTZ greater than 0.75% w/w. Preferably, the<br>
concentration of MTZ in the solution of the invention is about<br>
1.0%. In accordance with the invention, the concentration of<br>
MTZ in aqueous solution may be even higher, such as 1.25%,<br>
1.5%, 2.0%, or 2.5%, or more. At a level of 1% or higher of<br>
MTZ, the aqueous solution may be effectively used<br>
therapeutically as a topical formulation.<br>
The solution is preferably in the form of a gel.<br>
Therefore, the aqueous MTZ solution preferably contains a<br>
gelling agent. Any gelling agent that is water-dispersible<br>
and forms an aqueous gel of substantially uniform consistency<br>
is suitable for use in the solution of the invention so long<br>
as the gelling agent does not substantially interfere with the<br>
water solubility of MTZ or with the therapeutic efficacy of<br>
the solution. ASubstantially interferes means that the<br>
inclusion of the gelling agent decreases the solubility of MTZ<br>
to 0.75% w/w or less in aqueous solution. A preferred gelling<br>
agent is hydroxyethylcellulose (NATROSOLJ, Hercules Inc.,<br>
Wilmington, DE, USA). Examples of other suitable gelling<br>
agents include carboxyvinyl polymers, such as CARBOPOL7 934,<br>
940, and 941 (Noveon, Inc., Akron, OH, USA).<br>
The level of the cyclodextrin in the solution may be<br>
varied depending upon the desired dissolved concentration of<br>
MTZ. In general, it is preferable to use as low a<br>
concentration of cyclodextrin as possible to obtain the<br>
desired concentration of MTZ because cyclodextrins are<br>
expensive, of limited aqueous solubility, not entirely free of<br>
toxicity, and the presence of cyclodextrin may be irritating<br>
to certain intact and diseased skin and mucosal surfaces. In<br>
accordance with the invention, the concentration of<br>
cyclodextrin in aqueous solution may be between 0.1% and 20%,<br>
or higher. Preferably, the concentration of cyclodextrin in<br>
the solution is no more than about 5% w/w. In the case of<br>
beta-cyclodextrin, the concentration in aqueous solution is<br>
limited by its solubility in water. An aqueous solution,<br>
such as a gel, of beta-cyclodextrin is saturated at a<br>
concentration of about 0.5% at 5EC (refrigerator temperature).<br>
The solutions, especially in gel formulation, are non-<br>
tacky, fast-drying, and cosmetically elegant. The solutions,<br>
including the gel formulations, are physically stable at 5EC<br>
(refrigerator temperature) or room temperature conditions for<br>
at least 7 days. No crystal formation or precipitation is<br>
observed after one week at 5Â°C.<br>
It is preferred that the aqueous solution of the<br>
invention be substantially free of pharmacologically active -<br>
compounds other than MTZ having a water-solubility which is<br>
increased by the presence of cyclodextrins. These other<br>
compounds may act as competitors for the sequestration sites<br>
within the cyclodextrin cage structure and reduce the MTZ<br>
solubility enhancement by the cyclodextrin. Multiple solutes<br>
that are increased in solubility by cyclodextrins may be<br>
utilized in the solutions so long as the level of cyclodextrin<br>
and the second solubility enhancer in the solution is<br>
sufficiently high to result in the desired dissolved<br>
concentration of MTZ, even in the presence of the competitor<br>
solute.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the amount of<br>
cyclodextrin in the solution is at a level below that which<br>
enhances the solubilization of MTZ to the level desired, and a<br>
second solubility enhancer, such as niacinamide or niacin, is<br>
included in the solution at a level that permits the desired<br>
concentration of MTZ in aqueous solution to be attained. For<br>
example, if a stable 1% MTZ aqueous solution is desired, 0.1%<br>
to 1.0% BCD may be used and an amount of niacinamide or niacin<br>
may be combined in the solution to bring the solubility of MTZ<br>
to 1%. The amount of niacinamide to be combined in the<br>
solution is less than that which, without the presence of BCD<br>
in the solution, can enhance the solubility of MTZ<br>
sufficiently to obtain a 1% solution of MTZ, or whatever level<br>
of MTZ is desired. In accordance with this embodiment of the<br>
invention for a 1% aqueous solution of MTZ, the concentration<br>
of BCD % w/w in the solution is preferably at a level of 1.0%<br>
or less and the concentration of niacinamide or niacin equal<br>
to or more than that of BCD.<br>
The aqueous solutions, including the aqueous gels, of the<br>
invention may be made in any way that results in a stable MTZ<br>
concentration of greater than 0.75%, preferably of 1.0% or<br>
higher. Preferably, the solubility enhancers and the MTZ are<br>
combined in water, or a water-based solution, before the<br>
addition of a gelling agent, or at least before gelling of the<br>
solution occurs. Preferably, the solubility enhancers are<br>
dissolved in water before addition of the MTZ.<br>
In a preferred method of manufacture of the aqueous<br>
solution of the invention, an aqueous solution of BCD and<br>
niacinamide or niacin is prepared, wherein the levels of BCD<br>
and niacinamide or niacin are as described above.<br>
Metronidazole is then added to the solution. The amount of<br>
metronidazole added to the solution may be an amount<br>
calculated to provide the desired concentration of MTZ or it<br>
may be an excess amount of MTZ. The solution is preferably<br>
stirred or agitated at an elevated temperature and then<br>
permitted to cool to room or refrigerator temperature. A<br>
gelling agent, if desired, is preferably added at any time<br>
after the addition of MTZ to the solution. Most preferably,<br>
the gelling agent is added to the solution after the agitation<br>
of the solution, during the cooling of the solution, or<br>
following cooling of the solution.<br>
The solutions of the invention, including gels, may be<br>
used for the topical treatment of dermatologic or mucosal<br>
disorders that are responsive to therapy with metronidazole.<br>
In accordance with the method of treatment of the invention, a<br>
stable aqueous solution containing metronidazole at a<br>
concentration higher than 0.75% w/w, preferably about 1% or<br>
higher, is topically applied to skin or mucosal surfaces in<br>
need of such therapy. The applied solution preferably<br>
contains a cyclodextrin like BCD, as described above, in<br>
combination with niacin or niacinamide, as described above.<br>
The therapeutic method of the invention may be used to<br>
treat any disorder that is responsive, or potentially<br>
responsive, to metronidazole therapy. Examples of disorders<br>
that are suitably treated in accordance with the invention<br>
include inflammatory lesions on the skin, oral mucosa, or<br>
vaginal mucosa, diabetic foot ulcers, and certain infectious<br>
diseases that may be treated topically. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the method of the invention is used to treat<br>
rosacea.<br>
At concentrations of about 1% or higher, the application<br>
of the metronidazole solution is preferably only once daily.<br>
The solution is applied on a daily basis, one or more times<br>
per day, for a time sufficient to produce an amelioration or a<br>
cure of the disorder. In certain chronic disorders, the<br>
solution may be applied one or more times daily for a<br>
prolonged period to prevent worsening of the disorder.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a kit (Figure 1)<br>
is provided for the topical treatment of skin or mucosal<br>
disorders. The kit contains a jar 101 or other container<br>
suitable for holding an aqueous metronidazole solution as<br>
described herein, and instructions (not illustrated) for<br>
applying the solution topically to affected areas of the skin<br>
or mucosal surface. Preferably, the metronidazole solution<br>
has a concentration of metronidazole of about 1% or higher and<br>
the instructions call for applying the metronidazole solution<br>
to affected areas once daily. The jar 101 is preferably<br>
packaged within a box 102, upon which additional information,<br>
such as instructions, may be written.<br>
The following non-limiting examples provide a further<br>
description of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
All solutions in the following examples contain the<br>
components listed as the generic formula or gel vehicle shown<br>
in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br>
Different solutions according to Table 1 were made with<br>
varying concentrations of beta-cyclodextrin (BCD). The<br>
solutions of BCD were maintained at 5EC monitored weekly for<br>
two weeks for signs of crystal or precipitate formation. The<br>
results are shown in Table 2. The data show that the<br>
saturated BCD solubility in the aqueous solutions at 5EC is<br>
about 0.5%.<br>

with the gel vehicle of Example 1 containing 0.5% BCD. The<br>
metronidazole (MTZ)/BCD solutions were maintained at 5EC for<br>
one week. The results are shown in Table 3.<br>
Table 3<br>
From this study, the stable solubility of metronidazole<br>
in the gel vehicle containing 0.5% BCD at 5Â°C was determined to<br>
be about 0.8% w/w.<br>
Example 3<br>
A similar study using various concentrations of<br>
niacinamide showed that the concentration of niacinamide<br>
required to obtain a stable aqueous gel solution of 1.0%<br>
metronidazole is about 3%. Various gel solutions of Table 1<br>
were prepared with a concentration of 1.0% metronidazole and<br>
containing either 0.5% or 1.0% BCD and differing<br>
concentrations of niacinamide. The gels were maintained at<br>
5EC for one week to observe for precipitate or crystal<br>
formation. The results are shown in Table 4.<br>
Table 4<br>
The results in Table 4 show that concentrations of BCD<br>
and niacinamide as low as 0.5% and 1.0%, respectively, may be<br>
used together to obtain a physically stable aqueous gel<br>
solution of 1.0% metronidazole.<br>
Example 4<br>
Various gel solutions of Table 1 were prepared with a<br>
concentration of 1.0% metronidazole and various concentrations<br>
of niacin. The pH was adjusted to 5.0 +/- 0.15 with<br>
trolamine. The solutions were maintained at 5EC for one week<br>
to observe evidence of precipitation or crystal formation.<br>
The results are shown in Table 5.<br>
* - seven out of eight samples showed crystal formation<br>
Table 5<br>
The results in Table 5 show that the minimum<br>
concentration of niacin required to obtain a stable 1.0%<br>
metronidazole gel solution is greater than 0.5% and preferably<br>
about 0.75%.<br>
Example 5<br>
Various solutions according to Table 1 with 1%<br>
metronidazole, 0.5% niacin, pH adjusted to 5.0+/-0.15 and<br>
varying concentrations of BCD. The solutions were maintained<br>
at 5EC for one week to observe for crystal or precipitate<br>
formation. The results are shown in Table 6.<br>
Table 6<br>
As shown in Table 6, using a combination of 0.5% niacin<br>
and 0.5% BCD, a stable 1.0% aqueous gel solution of<br>
metronidazole was produced.<br>
The above data in Examples 1 to 5 show that BCD at its<br>
maximum soluble aqueous concentration raises the stable<br>
solubility of MTZ in aqueous solution, such as a gel, at 5Â°C by<br>
0.1%, that is from 0.7% to 0.8%. A 3% concentration of<br>
niacinamide is needed to increase MTZ aqueous solubility by<br>
0.3% to 1%. Thus, niacinamide at about 3% raises the<br>
physically stable solubility of MTZ in aqueous gel by an<br>
amount that is about 3 times the increase provided by the<br>
maximum soluble concentration of BCD.<br>
When BCD and niacinamide are both utilized in the<br>
solution, the two compounds act synergistically to increase<br>
the solubility of MTZ in water. The data in Examples 1 to 5<br>
show that when BCD is added to an aqueous solution at an<br>
amount expected to yield an increase of 0.1% and niacinamide<br>
is added at a level that is one third the amount of<br>
niacinamide that is able to raise the solubility of MTZ by<br>
0.3%, this combination results in a solubility of MTZ that is<br>
0.3% above its unaided solubility.<br>
Similar results were obtained using a 0.5% concentration<br>
of niacin, a concentration which is below that which produces<br>
a stable 1% solution of metronidazole. When this<br>
concentration of niacin was combined with 0.5% BCD, a<br>
concentration that provides only a 0.1% increase in MTZ<br>
aqueous solubility to 0.8%, the solubility of MTZ was<br>
synergistically increased to 1% at a pH of about 5.<br>
Various modifications of the above described<br>
invention will be evident to those skilled in the art. For<br>
example, more than one cyclodextrin may be used, such as beta-<br>
cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Similarly,<br>
the second solubility enhancing agent may be a multiplicity of<br>
solubility enhancing agents, such as both niacin and<br>
niacinamide. It is intended that such modifications are<br>
