COMPLETE		<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is<br>
to be performed.		<br>
DESCRIPTION		<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a plasma pyrolysis device for disposing waste more particularly municipal waste and most particularly medical waste.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Microwave disinfection is a non-incineration process that is used for sterilization (disinfection) of medical waste. Subsequently, the sterilized waste is either dumped along with the municipal waste or is treated by incinerators. The microwave process has potential for getting the workers expose to a contaminated shredder. In incineration, merely the burning of waste material takes place in the presence of oxygen. The major disadvantage with incinerator is, it has significant air emission control problem.<br>
Thermal plasmas have been used for high temperature gas heating application for more than a century. Thermal plasma is used as an effective source for the efficient conversion of electrical energy into thermal energy. These high temperature plasmas are employed for a large number of applications, for example cupola for steel foundries, thermal decomposition of Zircon sand, spherodization, production of fine ceramic powders etc. Clean disposal of hazardous waste is one of the most important applications of thermal plasma.<br>
The majority of plants utilizing the different plasma torches and plasma heating system have been in use typically 24 hours a day year round at industrial capacity. For example, a plasma plant in Defiance, Ohio, employs six 2.5 megawatt torches simultaneously, handling over 40 tons per hour scrap metals. The existing plasma torches use nitrogen or air as a plasmagen gas. The electrodes need proper cooling thus appreciable part of energy is lost in electrode cooling.<br>
US patent 5,090,340 discloses apparatus and method for the disintegration of waste by subjecting the waste within a closed chamber to an array of plume of an electrically generated high temperature plasma.<br>
US patent 4,644,877 of Pyroplasma International discloses a method and apparatus for the pyrolytic destruction of materials. The waste is fed into a plasma arc burner where it is atomized and ionized and then discharged into a reaction chamber. Plasma burner has a pair<br>
2<br><br>
of co-linear hallow graphite electrodes connected through a 500 kW power supply. The plasma arc is stabilized by annular electromagnetic field coils which spin the arc. Vortex air is supplied to plasma burner at a flow rate of 20 cubic feet per minute.<br>
Integrated environment technologies has developed plasma enhanced melter for the disposal of medical and hazardous waste and toxic ash. Waste is coverted in an arc plasma-joule heated melter system utilizing one or more graphite electrodes to produce arc plasma and a plurality of joule heating electrodes. The arc plasma electrodes are powered by AC or DC source or for switching between AC or DC source or for switching between AC and DC power. The graphite electrodes are mounted vertically and the molten glass bed is used to transfer the energy. The joule heating is done simultaneously with the arcing without any detrimental interaction with the arcing electrodes. C.H. Titus et al invented an arc furnace that utilizes a combined DC arc system and an AC joule heating system to melt and disposed the waste and keep the wase material in a molten condition.<br>
Plascon is an in-flight plasma arc system developed by Australia's CSIRO. A liquid or gaseous waste stream mixed with argon is injected directly into a plasma flame, which provides emperatures in excess of 3000°C for pyrolysis. The residence time of the waste in the reaction chamber is of the order of 20-50 milliseconds, resulting in a small process inventory. The end products include gases consisting of argon, carbon dioxide and water vapour and an aqueous solution of inorganic sodium salts. Chlorinated organics yield very high destruction performance and release very low dioxins and furace. The measured emission of dioxins and furans in the off gases has been found to be in the range of 0.005 -0.009 ng/m , which is well below the strictest proposed invironmental standard in the word.<br>
Parcon is the product of Plasma Environmental Technoligies Inc. developed and designed specifically for destruction of the environment's most problematic liquid chemical wastes, including pesticides, PCBs, chemical weapons, fungicides, and petroleum derivatives. Destruction and Removal Efficiency exceeds the EPA standard of 99.9999%, with documented DRE as high as &gt; 99.999998%. For example, the PARCON emission of dioxin/furan has been documented at 0.03 nanograms per cubic meter (ng/Nm ), against the US-EPA allowed level of 0.2 ng/ Nm . PARCON technology is available in transportable units ranging from 12.5 kilograms per hour to &gt; 200 kg/hour feed capacity. The furnace uses a transferred arc plasma torch to heat the bath material.<br>
3<br><br>
The plasma Arc Centrifugal Treatment process is developed by Retech. The waste is fed continuously by a screw feeder into the centrifugal reactor. A copper throat, at the bottom of the primary chamber, is used to strike the arc of the plasma torch. Solid material is retained in the tub by centrifugal force. The heat of the plasma gas volatilizes organic components. The destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of organic compounds is claimed to be greater than 99.99%. The system can operate under pyrolytic conditions and a reducing atmosphere avoiding dioxin formation in the primary chamber. Given the total air emission volumes are less than for conventional combustion processes, the potential impact of emissions is expected to be lower. Investment costs are located in the range 3.8-7.6 millions of ECU while the operating costs may be evaluated around 120-150 ECU/ton.<br>
The Startech Environmental Corporation developed the STARTECH Plasma-electric Waste Converted (PWC) in the US. The system was designed to treat both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. The PWC is a plasma heated pyrolysis system, operating in a oxyen deficient or reducing atmosphere. Organic and inorganic wastes can be introduced into the plasma chamber as solids, liquids, gases, and sludges. Gas recovered from the top of the chamber is treated and can be reused as fuel gas or chemical feed stock to produce, for example, polymers.<br>
Incidis is an Aerospatiale product, built to prove the efficiency of plasma treatment in disposing of solids holding high percentage of chlorinate compounds such as PCBs. The torch used has got a power of 800 kW and waste held in bins are reduced in a liquid mixture and pumped in contact with plasma flame which destroys harmful molecules and produces neutral slag. Trials carried out with pentaclorophenol showed a DRE &gt; 99.999% and a VOC (volatile organic compounds ) 
In 1986 Westinghouse developed a trailer for a mobile unit plasma plant disposing of liquid organic material such as PCBs. the plasma plant was based on a 1MW non-transferred plasma torch, areaction chamber and an analysis, control laboratory on line and an end of pipe effluents treatment. This plant demonstrated good results for the disposal of methanon, ethanol, methyl ethylketone, and carbon tetrachloride. The most interesting results arise from PBCs incineration in fact, with a torch power supply of 850 kW, a destruction efficiency (DRE) beyond 99.99999%) had been reached with emissions of HCI, particulate<br>
4<br><br>
and NOx which were below the accepted Canadian regulatory agency guidelines. Furthermore dioxines and furans emissions were usually undetectable.<br>
EPA's Hazardous Waste Engineering Research Laboratory and the New York State department of environmental conservation established in 1982 a co-operative agreement for the construction of a mobile pilot scale plasma system for the destruction of Hazardous waste such as PCBs. The system is basically composed by a plasma torch able to reach the typical temperature of 10000 C°, a reactor where the reaction takes place, a scrubber system and a gas effluent system; emissions had been measured by a monitoring system. In 1985 trials for PCB destruction have been carried out by highlighting DRE efficiency beyond 99.9999% and a HC1 formation rate below 4 kg/hr. In the scrubber effluents and in the exhaused gases as well, an appreciable concentration of dioxins or furans has not been noticed.<br>
Plasmarc plant is a closed reactor vessel equipped with a transferred plasma torch and an oxygen-fuel lance. The oxygen-fuel is added to heat up the system and to keep the reactor on required temperature during treatment of low caloric material. Within Plasma reactor the amount of dust in the off-gas is normally low.<br>
The prior art plasma pyrolysis processes are predominantly carried out using air or nitrogen plasma torches. The electrodes are copper or thoriated tungsten which need to be changed after specified life of 100-1000 hours. Introduction of N2 through electrodes requires uninterrupted nitrogen supply or nitrogen generator. Using air as plasmagen gas results in formation of dioxins and furans. These drawbacks have been overcome in the present invention.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to propose a plasma pyrolysis device which is energy efficient and meets the emission norms.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a plasma pyrolysis device which eliminates the use of nitrogen or plasmagen gas in the process of pyrolysis.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a plasma pyrolysis device which is simple in construction and cost effective.<br>
5<br><br>
Other objects and advanteges of the present invention will be clear from the ensuing description, claims, examples and drawings.<br>

(22), purging time of about 120 sec (24), fish mouth opening delay of about 90 sec (25), time delay of about 3.5 Min (27). The automation devices include proximity switches (23 and 26).<br>
Block diagram of a preferred embodiment of secondary chamber (4) is given in Fig. 5 which comprises multiple pipes used for burning the combustible gas (28), hole for air admission (29), flame igniter (30), multiple small apertures for air introduction (31), cera-wool to reduce heat losses (32), MS outer pipe (33), multi-pipe arrangement to improve residence time (34)<br>
•	The first step of the process is pre-heating of the primary chamber with external resistive heater or by plasma torch.<br>
•	In the second step plasma torch is energized and then waste material is introduced in the primary chamber, where the material is subjected to intense heating by plasma torch. The organic material breaks up into small molecules due to intense heating in an oxygen starved environment. The plasma torch is placed at one end of the primary chamber as shown in the figure 1.<br>
•	These fragmented molecules enter in the secondary chamber where they are combusted in the excess of air. The induced draft fan creates a negative pressure into the primary chamber, drives the pyrolysed gases into secondary chamber. The induced draft fan also sucks in the required air for complete combustion.<br>
•	The gases after the combustion are very hot (~900°C) as well as contain some hydrochloric acid. These gases are sent to scrubber to remove hydrochloric acid.<br>
8<br><br>
The scrubbed gases pass through a filter to further reduce soot content in the exhaust. Finally, the exhaust gases (mainly C02, 02, N2 and H20) are released in the atmosphere through small chimney.<br>
Plasma pyrolysis technology is state of the art technology for safe disposal of medical waste. It is environment friendly technology, which convert organic waste into commercially useful byproducts. Plasma, the state of matter formed by removing the bound electrons from the atoms, is an electrically conducting fluid consisting of charged and neutral particles. These charged particles have high kinetic energies. When the ionized species in the plasma recombine with the stripped electrons, significant amount of energy in the form of ultraviolet radiation is released. The particle kinetic energy takes the form of heat and can be used for decomposing chemicals. In addition, the presence of charged and excited species renders he plasma environment highly reactive which catalyses homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions.<br>
The important feature of the present invention is that pyrolysis carried out in oxygen starved environment using specific graphite plasma torch. The present torch benefited the plasma pyrolysis through elimination of nitrogen and the problems associated with nitrogen or air plasma torches. The problems include replacement of electrodes by handling the contaminated torch particularly in the case of hospital waste. In order to enhance the life of electrodes, the cooling and arc rotation by producing magnetic field in the vicinity of anode was essential. The cooling of anode and cathode was carrying substantial amount of heat thus reducing the efficiency of torch. The plasmagen gas was also extracting substantial amount of heat energy, therefore, it was difficult to increase the temperature of reaction zone at low power (20-25kW). With the use of graphite plasma torch it has become possible to enhance the temperature of reaction zone. At higher temperature (&gt;1000°C), super thermal pyrolysis takes place which provide high conversion efficiency. The use of nitrogen generator or gas cylinders has been completely eliminated. In the absence of plasmagen gas (N2 or air), the pyrolysis gas composition has changed and large quantity of combustible gases produced in the primary chamber. Further the pyrolysis is endothermic process and needs external input energy. Present pyrolysis systems around the world are in few hundred kW range. The process of this invention has been optimized to operate at power levels of few tens of kW. Performance of each subsystems were optimized to meet the emission norms.<br>

In plasma pyrolysis the most likely compounds that form from carbonaceous matter are methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and water molecules. The intense and versatile heat generation capabilities of plasma pyrolysis technology enable it to dispose of all type of waste including municipal solid waste, biomedical waste and hazardous waste in a safe and reliable manner. Medical waste is pyrolysed into CO, H2, acids, acid gases and hydrocarbons when it comes in contact with the plasma arc. These gases are burned and produce high temperature of 1000-1200°C (around 1200°C). In the plasma pyrolysis process the hot gases are quenched from 500°C to 40°-70°C to avoid recombination reactions of gaseous molecules that inhibit the formation of dioxins and furans. The gas analysis results reveal that toxic gases found after the combustion are well within the limit of Central Pollution Control Board's emission standards. It is shown in Table 1. Dioxins and furans analysis results are shown in Table 2. The analysis was done at Regional Research Laboratory Trivandrum.<br>

As shown in Figure 1, Primary chamber (1) is constructed out of mild steel of suitable dimension. The inner wall has ceramic wool lining to prevent the dissipation of heat. The chamber has an arrangement to mount three graphite electrodes. In this chamber the pyrolytic destruction of medical waste takes place. The dimensions of the primary chamber vary with the increase in capacity.<br>
losses and material does not stick during the feed cycle. The dimensions of the feeder vary with the change in capacity.<br>
Arrangement has been made to purge steam in the feeder. Steam is introduced continuously in the feeder to replace the pyrolysed gases. The pyrolysed gases fill in the feeder at the time of material feeding in the primary chamber.   Another connection is made from feeder to<br>
10<br><br>
secondary chamber for replacing the pyrolysed gases. Steam feeding is essential to prevent explisive reactions during the transfer of waste from feeder to primary chamber. In an embodiment the steam is generated on a steam generator.<br>
Graphite plasma torch (9) used in the present set up comprises of: a tubular anode (12), two tubular cathode (13), means for holding the anode and cathode in position, arrangement to rotate chathodes, arrangement for linear motion of anode and cathode, means for initiating the arc. The anodes are mounted transverse to the cathode at angle of about 90° as shown in Figure 2. The electrodes are powered by indigenously designed and fabricated 200A and 125 V power supply. The plasma arc is produced between the three electrodes by shorting them.<br>
The power supply (7) is capable of delivering electrical power up to 25 kW. It has interlocks and is used to energize the plasma torch. The power supply has following protections: secondary flame disappearance, induced draft fan failure, pressure limit in the secondary and primary chamber, scrubber water temperature, failure of water circulation motor for scrubber, etc. Arc is initiated by shorting anode and cathode and auxiliary anode. The pilot arc then transferred to the main anode.<br>
Secondary chamber (94) is made up of two co-axial cylindrical, mild steel chambers. The inner cylinder has multiple holes to suck in air for combustion. It is connected to scrubber and induced draft fan. The outer cylinder is open from the top and lined outside by compressed glass combusted to form carbon dioxide and water. The necessary condition for the secondary chamber as per the environment regulation is that the residence time of the gas should be nearly 1 sec and the temperature should be maintained at 1000-1200°C preferably approximately 1050°C for complete destruction of aromatic hydrocarbons. The pyrolysed gas from the primary chamber and excess air from the holes of cylindrical chamber is sucked in by induced draft fan and burn into the secondary chamber. A sparker mounted in the secondary chamber ignites the flame. A self sustained flame exiss as long as the pyrolysis is taking place at an adequate rate in the primary chamber. Reduction in flame temperature is used as an indication for less pyrolytic reaction of reduction of material in primary chamber.<br>
A dilute alkali solution preferably sodium hydroxide solution is sprayed into the chamber of the scrubber (5) by a pump. The direction of the spray is opposite to the gas flow. The gases coming out of the secondary chamber contain acid and acid gases such as Hydrochloric acid due to the PVC present in the primary chamber. The alkali solution reacts with hydrochloric<br>
11<br><br>
acid forming chloride and water. Thus it is necessary to continuously monitor the pH of the scrubbing solution.<br>
The induced draft fan (8) sucks the gases from the primary chamber and provides a negative pressure into the system. It is also used in the present setup to provide necessary air for combustion in the secondary chamber. The capacity depends on the disposal capacity of the system.<br>
The cathode (13) and anode (12) are automatically moved in linear direction with the help of PLC circuit (11). The cathodes are also rotated along the axis for uniform erosion using another PLC circuit (11), the opening of feeder doors and bringing the equilibrium of gaseous environment in primary chamber and feeder has been automized.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
The primary chamber is preheated to 800°C in the beginning by the plasma torch (it takes typical 50-60 minutes). The Medical waste was placed in the feeder and the top lid was closed. It was purged with steam for sufficient time. The fish mouth door was opened for feeding. The pyrolysis begins within couple of minutes. The igniter in the secondary was switched to initiate combustion of pyrolysed gasses emitted from the primary chamber. This helps in maintaining a stable flame in the secondary chamber and in getting suitable temperature (1000 + 50° C). Material in the primary chamber is continuously stirred to complete pyrolysis.<br>
The chemical reactions taking place during pyrolysis are given below:<br>
C6H10O5 + Heat O      CH4 + 2CO + 3H20 + 3C	— (1)<br>
Cellulose<br>
[-CH2-CH2 -]'„ + H20 + Heat        xCH4 + yH2 + zCO	— (2)<br>
Polyethylene<br>
Experiments were also carried out with contaminated medical waste. The emission norms were met by adjusting the plasma power and temperature of the order of 1000 + 50°C. The emissions from the system are found well within the limit of Central Pollution Control Board's Standards.   Additional electrical heaters in the primary chamber increase overall<br>
12<br><br>
temperature of the primary chamber above 400°C preferably between 800 - 1000°C to reduce formation of toxic compounds such as dioxin and furans. Additional heaters surrounding the secondary chamber provide sufficient temperature to combust pyrolysed gases completely during the startup of the process.<br>
The present device can be scaled to increase the capacity by increase in number of plasma torches, increase in primary chamber volume and shape. This will also calls for scale up in secondary chamber volume, scrubber capacity and induced draft fan capacity.<br>
