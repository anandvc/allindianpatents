COMPOUNDS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to 4-(substituted cycloalkylmethyl) imidazole-2-<br>
thiones, 4-(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl) imidazole-2-thiones and related<br>
compounds and to their use as specific or selective agonists of alpha2B and/or alpha2c<br>
adrenergic receptors. More specifically the present invention relates to the above-<br>
noted compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds as active<br>
ingredient for modulating the alpha2B and/or alpha2C adrenergic receptors, and even<br>
more specifically for utilizing these compounds and pharmaceutical compositions to<br>
alleviate chronic pain, allodynia, muscle spasticity, diarrhea, neuropathic pain and<br>
other diseases and conditions.<br>
The present invention also relates to, 4-(substituted cycloalkylmethyl)<br>
imidazol-2-ones and 4-(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl) imidazoI-2-ones and to<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds alleviate chronic pain,<br>
allodynia, muscle spasticity, diarrhea, neuropathic pain and other diseases and<br>
conditions.<br>
Background Art<br>
Human adrenergic receptors are integral membrane proteins which have been<br>
classified into two broad classes, the alpha and the beta adrenergic receptors. Both<br><br>
types mediate the action of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system upon binding of<br>
catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine.<br>
Norepinephrine is produced by adrenergic nerve endings, while epinephrine is<br>
produced by the adrenal medulla. The binding affinity of adrenergic receptors for<br>
these compounds forms one basis of the classification: alpha receptors tend to bind<br>
norepinephrine more strongly than epinephrine and much more strongly than the<br>
synthetic compound isoproterenol. The preferred binding affinity of these hormones is<br>
reversed for the beta receptors. In many tissues, the functional responses, such as<br>
smooth muscle contraction, induced by alpha receptor activation are opposed to<br>
responses induced by beta receptor binding.<br>
Subsequently, the functional distinction between alpha and beta receptors was<br>
further highlighted and refined by the pharmacological characterization of these<br>
receptors from various animal and tissue sources. As a result, alpha and beta<br>
adrenergic receptors were further subdivided into alphai, α2, β1, and β2 subtypes.<br>
Functional differences between α1 and α2 receptors have been recognized, and<br>
compounds which exhibit selective binding between these two subtypes have been<br>
developed. Thus, in published international patent application WO 92/0073, the<br>
selective ability of the R(+) enantiomer of terazosin to selectively bind to adrenergic<br>
receptors of the α1 subtype was reported. The α1/α2 selectivity of this compound was<br>
disclosed as being significant because agonist stimulation of the α2 receptors was said<br>
to inhibit secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine, while antagonism of the α2<br>
receptor was said to increase secretion of these hormones. Thus, the use of non-<br>
selective alpha-adrenergic blockers, such as phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine,<br>
was said to be limited by their α2 adrenergic receptor mediated induction of increased<br>
plasma catecholamine concentration and the attendant physiological sequelae<br>
(increased heart rate and smooth muscle contraction).<br>
For a further general background on the a-adrenergic receptors, the reader's attention<br>
is directed to Robert R. Ruffolo, Jr., a-Adrenoreceptors: Molecular Biology,<br>
Biochemistry and Pharmacology, (Progress in Basic and Clinical Pharmacology<br>
series, Karger, 1991), wherein the basis of α1/α2 subclassification, the molecular<br><br>
biology, signal transduction, agonist structure-activity relationships, receptor<br>
functions, and therapeutic applications for compounds exhibiting a-adrenergic<br>
receptor affinity is explored.<br>
The cloning, sequencing and expression of alpha receptor subtypes from<br>
animal tissues has led to the subclassification of the ai adrenoreceptors into aiA, OIIB,<br>
and aiD. Similarly, the a2 adrenoreceptors have also been classified a2A, CLIB, and a2C<br>
receptors. Each a2 receptor subtype appears to exhibit its own pharmacological and<br>
tissue specificities. Compounds having a degree of specificity for one or more of<br>
these subtypes may be more specific therapeutic agents for a given indication than an<br>
a2 receptor pan-agonist (such as the drug clonidine) or a pan-antagonist<br>
Among other indications, such as the treatment of glaucoma, hypertension,<br>
sexual dysfunction, and depression, certain compounds having alpha 2 adrenergic<br>
receptor agonist activity are known analgesics. However, many compounds having<br>
such activity do not provide the activity and specificity desirable when treating<br>
disorders modulated by alpha-2 adrenoreceptors. For example, many compounds<br>
found to be effective agents in the treatment of pain are frequently found to have<br>
undesirable side effects, such as causing hypotension and sedation at systemically<br>
effective doses. There is a need for new drugs that provide relief from pain without<br>
causing these undesirable side effects. Additionally, there is a need for agents which<br>
display activity against pain, particularly chronic pain, such as chronic neuropathic<br>
and visceral pain.<br>
British Patent 1 499 485, published February 1,1978 describes certain<br>
thiocarbamide derivatives; some of these are said to be useful in the treatment of<br>
conditions such as hypertension, depression or pain.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A general description of the compounds of the invention is provided in the<br>
Summary section of the present application for patent with reference to Formula 1. It<br>
will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that some of the compounds<br>
depicted in these formulas may exist in trans (E) and cis (Z) isomeric forms.<br>
Moreover, some of the compounds of the invention may contain one or more<br>
asymmetric centers, such that the compounds may exist in enantiomeric as well as in<br>
diastereomeric forms. Unless it is specifically noted otherwise, the scope of the<br>
present invention includes all trans (E) and cis (Z) isomers, enantiomers,<br>
diastereomers and racemic mixtures. Some of the compounds of the invention may<br>
form salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base, and such pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula 1 are also within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
Both the imidazole-2-thione and the imidazol-2-one derivative compounds of<br>
the present invention can undergo tautomeric transformations and can be depicted by<br>
the tautomeric formulas shown below. All tautomers of Formula 1 are within the<br>
scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
Generally speaking and referring to Formula 1 in the preferred compounds of<br>
the invention the variable p represent the integer zero (0) or one (1) and the RJO<br>
groups of the moiety [C(Rio)2]p are hydrogen. Thus, in the preferred compounds of<br>
the invention a methylene (CH2) group connects the imidazole-2-thione or imidazol-2-<br>
one nucleus with the cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl ring shown in Formula 1, or there is<br>
no such connecting group.<br>
In the preferred compounds of the invention the variable n represents an integer<br>
having the values zero (0) or one (1) so that the cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl ring shown<br>
in Formula 1 is preferably 5 or 6 membered.<br>
The variables Rj, R2, R3, and R4 of the preferred compounds of the invention<br>
represent hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbons, an oxo group, and ethynyl. Alternatively<br>
in many preferred compounds of the invention two adjacent ones of the Ri, R2, R3,<br>
and R4 groups form a 5 or 6 membered ring which can be aromatic, or fully or partly<br>
saturated but more preferably at least partly unsaturated. When the ring formed by<br>
two adjacent ones of the Ri, R2, R3, and R4 groups is heteroaromatic then pyridyl,<br>
thienyl, furyl, pyrollyl and imidazole rings are preferred with the thienyl, pyridyl and<br>
piperidinyl being most preferred.<br><br>
The variable Rg represents the substituent on the ring formed by two adjacent<br>
ones of the Rj, R2, R3, and R4 groups and is preferably H, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbons,<br>
OR9,Cl,Br,F,orCH2OH.<br>
The presently most preferred 4-(substituted cycloalkylmethyl) imidazole-2-<br>
thione and 4-(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl) imidazole-2-thione compounds of the<br>
invention are disclosed by their structural formula in Table 1 together with their<br>
activity in assays measuring their ability to act as agonists of alpha2A, alpha^ and<br>
alpha2c adrenergic receptors. The presently most preferred 4-(substituted<br>
cycloalkylmethyl) imidazol-2-one and 4-(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl) imidazol-2-<br>
one compounds of the invention are disclosed by their structural formula in Table 2.<br>
Table 1 (imidazole- 2-thione compounds)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Reaction Scheme A illustrates a general method for obtaining the 4-<br>
(substituted cycloalkylmethyl) imidazole-2-thione and 4-(substituted<br>
cycloalkenylmethyl) imidazole-2-thione compounds of the invention. The starting<br>
material in this scheme is a primary alcohol of Formula 2 where the variables have<br>
the same definitions as in Formula 1. However the scheme is primarily applicable<br>
when one of the Ri and R2 substituents is not H. Thus, the compound of Formula 2<br>
has one C(Rio)2 unit less than the compound of Formula 1 in the corresponding<br>
chain. However, for simplicity of illustration the scheme discloses the preparation of<br>
the preferred class of 4-(substituted cycloalkylmethyl) imidazole-2-thione and 4-<br>
(substituted cycloalkenyylmethyl) imidazole-2-thione compounds of the invention<br>
where p is one (1) and Rio is hydrogen, and the starting material shown in the scheme<br>
is designated with Formula 2 A. The compounds of Formula 2 and of Formula 2 A<br>
can be obtained in accordance with known procedures in the chemical scientific and<br>
patent literature or by such modifications of known procedures which are readily<br>
apparent to the practicing synthetic organic chemist.<br><br><br>
Referring still to Reaction Scheme A the primary cyclic alcohol of Formula<br>
2 A is reacted with ethyl vinyl ether (EVE) in the presence of mercuric ions (mercuric<br>
acetate Hg(OAc)2) to provide the vinyl ether of Formula 3 which is thereafter<br>
oxidized and rearranged by treatment with lithium perchlorate (LiClO/O to provide the<br>
4-(substituted cycloalkyl)-acetaldehydes or 4-(substituted cycloalkenyl)-acetaldehydes<br>
of Formula 4. The aldehydes of Formula 4 are then reacted xviihpara-<br>
toluenesulfonyl isocyanide (tosylmethylisocyanide, TosMIC), sodium cyanide<br>
(NaCN) and thereafter heated with ammonia in an alcohol solvent to provide the 4-<br>
(substituted cycloalkylmethyl) imidazole or 4-(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl)<br>
imidazole compounds of Formula 5 which are preferably isolated as the fumarate<br>
salt. The 4-(substituted cycloalkylmethyl) imidazole or 4-(substituted<br>
cycloalkenylmethyl) imidazole compounds of Formula 5 are then reacted with<br>
phenylchlorothionoformate (PhOC(S)Cl) to convert them to the corresponding<br>
imidazole-2-thione compounds of Formula 6. The compounds of Formula 6 are<br>
pharmaceutically active compounds of the invention and are within the scope of<br>
Formula 1.<br><br><br>
REACTION SCHEME A<br>
Reaction Scheme B discloses another general synthetic routes to 4-(substituted<br>
cycloalkylmethyl) imidazole-2-thiones and 4-(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl)<br>
imidazole-2-thione compounds of the invention. This synthetic route is particularly<br>
suitable for preparation of those compounds of the invention where the Ri substituent<br>
of Formula 1 represents an oxo group, and where a suitably substituted cycloalkyl or<br>
cycloalkenyl group of Formula 7 is readily available commercially or in accordance<br>
with the chemical literature. In accordance with this scheme, the keto compound of<br>
Formula 7 is heated with 4,5-imidazole carboxaldehyde of Formula 8 in the<br>
presence of strong acid to yield (lH-imidazol-4-yl-methylene)-cycloalkyl or (1H-<br>
imidazol-4-yl-methylene)-cycloalkenyl derivatives of Formula 9. 4,5-imidazole<br>
carboxaldehyde is available from Aldrich. The methylene group of the imidazole<br>
compound of Formula 9 is reduced by hydrogenation to provide (lH-imidazol-4-yI-<br>
methyl)-cycloalkyl or (lH-imidazol-4-yl-methyl)-cycloalkenyl derivatives of<br>
Formula 10. The (lH-irnidazol-4-yl-memyl)-cycloalkyl or (lH-imidazol-4-yl-<br>
methyl)-cycloalkenyl derivatives of Formula 10 are reacted with<br>
phenylchlorothionoformate (PhOC(S)Cl), as described above in connection with<br><br>
Reaction Scheme A, to obtain the thione compounds of Formula 11. The<br>
compounds of Formula 11 are pharmaceutically active compounds of the invention<br>
and are within the scope of Formula 1.<br><br>
REACTION SCHEME B<br>
Reaction Scheme C discloses still another general synthetic route to the<br>
preparation of the 4-(substituted cycloalkylmethyl) imidazole-2-thione and 4-<br>
(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl) imidazole-2-thione compounds of the invention.<br>
This synthetic route is particularly suitable for preparation of those compounds of the<br>
invention where a corresponding, suitably substituted cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl<br>
methyl iodo (or chloro or bromo) compound of Formula 12 is available<br>
commercially or in accordance with the chemical literature to serve as a starting<br>
material. The iodo compound is reacted with l-N-(dimethylsulfamoyl)-2-tert-<br>
butyldimethylsilyl imidazole of Formula 13 in the presence of /i-butyl lithium to give<br>
4-(substituted cycloalkylmethyl or 4-(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl 1-N-<br>
(dimethylsulfamoyl)-2-tert-butyldimethylsilyl imidazole of Formula 14. The<br>
synthesis of l-N-(dimethylsulfamoyl)-2-^er/-butyldimethylsilyl imidazole is described<br>
below in the experimental section of the present application for patent The tertiary<br>
butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) group is removed from the compound of Formula 14 by<br>
treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) to give 4-(substituted<br>
cycloalkylmethyl or 4-(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl 1- N-(dimethylsulfamoyl)-<br><br>
imidazole compounds of Formula 15. Treatment of the 4-(substituted<br>
cycloalkylmethyl or 4-(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl 1- N-(dimethylsulfamoyl)-<br>
imidazole compounds of Formula 15 with strong base, such as potassium hydroxide<br>
removes the N-(dimethylsulfamoyl) group and the resulting 4-(substituted<br>
cycloalkylmethyl or 4-(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl-imidazole compounds of<br>
Formula 5 are isolated as the fumarate salt. The 4-(substituted cycloalkylmethyl or<br>
4-(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl-imidazole compounds of Formula 5 are then<br>
reacted with phenylchlorothionoformate (PhOC(S)Cl) to convert them to the<br>
corresponding imidazole-2-thione compounds of Formula 6, as is described in<br>
connection with Reaction Scheme A.<br><br>
REACTION SCHEME C<br>
Reaction Scheme D illustrates a general method for obtaining the 4-<br>
(substituted cycloalkylmethyl) imidazol-2-one and 4-(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl)<br><br>
imidazole-2-one compounds of the invention. The actual starting material in this<br>
scheme can also be the primary alcohol of Formula 2 which is shown in Reaction<br>
Scheme A, where the variables have the same definitions as in Formula 1. Thus, the<br>
compound of Formula 2 has one C(Rio)2 unit less than the compound of Formula 1<br>
in the corresponding chain. However, for simplicity of illustration the scheme<br>
discloses the preparation of the preferred class of 4-(substituted cycloalkyhnethyl)<br>
imidazol-2-one and 4-(substituted cycloalkenyylmethyl) imidazol-2-one compounds<br>
of the invention where p is one (1) and Rjo is hydrogen. Because certain initial<br>
reaction steps followed in this scheme are the same as in Reaction Scheme A, this<br>
Scheme D illustrates the synthesis only from the compound of Formula 5, which is<br>
obtained as described in Scheme A. Thus the compounds of Formula 5, preferably in<br>
the form of the fumarate salt, are reacted with phenylchloroformate (PhOC(O)Cl) in<br>
the presence of sodium bicarbonate, followed by reaction with sodium carbonate to<br>
convert them to the corresponding imidazol-2-one compounds of Formula 16. The<br>
compounds of Formula 16 are pharmaceutically active compounds of the invention<br>
and are within the scope of Formula 1.<br><br>
REACTION SCHEME D<br>
Reaction Scheme E discloses another general synthetic routes to 4-(substituted<br>
cycloalkylmethyl) imidazol-2-ones and 4-(substituted cycloalkenylmemyl) imidazol-<br>
2-one compounds of the invention. Similarly to Reaction Scheme B this synthetic<br>
route is particularly suitable for preparation of those compounds of the invention<br>
where the R\ substituent of Formula 1 represents an oxo group, and where a suitably<br>
substituted cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group of Formula 7 as shown in Reaction<br><br>
Scheme B is readily available commercially or in accordance with the chemical<br>
literature. In the reaction sequence disclosed in tins scheme the compounds of<br>
Formula 10, obtained as shown in Reaction Scheme B, are reacted with<br>
phenylchloroformate (PhOC(O)Cl) in Ihe presence of sodium bicarbonate, followed<br>
by reaction with sodium carbonate to convert them to the corresponding imidazol-2-<br>
one compounds of Formula 16.<br><br>
REACTION SCHEME E<br>
Another general presently preferred synthetic route shown in Reaction Scheme<br>
F for the synthesis of the 4-(substituted cycloalkylmethyl) imidazol-2-one and 4-<br>
(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl) imidazol-2-one compounds of the invention is<br>
particularly suitable for preparation of those compounds of the invention where a<br>
corresponding, suitably substituted cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl methyl iodo (or chloro<br>
or bromo) compound of Formula 12, shown in Reaction Scheme C, is available<br>
commercially or in accordance with the chemical literature to serve as a starting<br>
material. This synthetic route follows the route shown in Reaction Scheme C to<br>
prepare the imidazole compounds of Formula 15, as shown in Scheme C. These are<br>
thereafter converted to the corresponding cycloalkylmethyl) imidazol-2-one or 4-<br>
(substituted cycloalkenylmethyl) imidazol-2-one compounds by reactions with<br>
phenylchloroformate (PhOC(O)Cl) in the presence of sodium bicarbonate, followed<br>
by reaction with sodium carbonate to yield the corresponding irnidazol-2-one<br>
compounds of Formula 16.<br><br><br>
REACTION SCHEME F<br>
The reaction schemes incorporated in the experimental section of this application<br>
illustrate the synthetic schemes which are employed for the synthesis of preferred<br>
embodiments of compounds of the invention.<br>
BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY, MODES OF ADMINISTRATION<br>
The imidazole-2-thione compounds of the invention are agonists of alpha2<br>
adrenergic receptors, particularly they tend to be specific or selective agonists of<br>
alpha2B and/or to a lesser extent alpha2c adrenergic receptors, in preference over<br>
alpha2A adrenergic receptors. The specific or selective alpha2B and/or to a lesser<br>
extent alpha2c agonist activity of the compounds of the invention is demonstrated in<br>
an assay titled Receptor Selection and Amplification technology (RSAT) assay, which<br>
is described in the publication by Messier et. Al, 1995, Pharmacol. Toxicol. 76, pp.<br>
308 - 311 (incorporated herein by reference) and is also described below. Another<br>
reference pertinent to this assay is Conklin et al. (1993) Nature 363:274-6, also<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Receptor Selection and Amplification Technology (RSAT) assay<br>
The RSAT assay measures a receptor-mediated loss of contact inhibition mat<br>
results in selective proliferation of receptor-containing cells in a mixed population of<br>
confluent cells. The increase in cell number is assessed with an appropriate<br><br>
transfected marker gene such as J}-galactosidase, the activity of which can be easily<br>
measured in a 96-well format. Receptors that activate the G protein, Gq, elicit this<br>
response. Alpha2 receptors, which normally couple to Gi, activate the RSAT<br>
response when coexpressed with a hybrid Gq protein that has a Gi receptor<br>
recognition domain, called Gq/i5.<br>
NIH-3T3 cells are plated at a density of 2xl06 cells in 15 cm dishes and<br>
maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf<br>
serum. One day later, cells are cotransfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with<br>
mammalian expression plasmids encoding p-SV-p-galactosidase (5-10 fig), receptor<br>
(1-2 ug) and G protein (1-2 ug). 40 ug salmon sperm DNA may also be included in<br>
the transfection mixture. Fresh media is added on the following day and 1-2 days<br>
later, cells are harvested and frozen in 50 assay aliquots. Cells are thawed and 100 ul<br>
added to 100 ul aliquots of various concentrations of drugs in triplicate in 96-well<br>
dishes. Incubations continue 72-96 hr at 37 °C. After washing with phosphate-<br>
buffered saline, P-galactosidase enzyme activity is determined by adding 200 ul of the<br>
chromogenic substrate (consisting of 3.5 mM o-nitrophenyl-p-D-galactopyranoside<br>
and 0.5% nonidet P-40 in phosphate buffered saline), incubating overnight at 30 °C<br>
and measuring optical density at 420 nm. The absorbance is a measure of enzyme<br>
activity, which depends on cell number and reflects a receptor-mediated cell<br>
proliferation. The EC50 and maximal effect of each drug at each alpha2 receptor is<br>
determined. The efficacy or intrinsic activity is calculated as a ratio of the maximal<br>
effect of the drug to the maximal effect of a standard full agonist for each receptor<br>
subtype. Brimonidine, also called UK14304, the chemical structure of which is<br>
shown below, is used as the standard agonist for the alpha^ alphas and alpha2c<br>
receptors.<br><br><br>

The results of the RSAT assay with several exemplary compounds of the<br>
invention are disclosed in Table 1 above together with the chemical formulas of these<br>
examplary compounds. Each number in the table represents EC50 in nanomolar (nM)<br>
concentration whereas the number in parenthesis in the table shows the fraction of<br>
activity of the appropriate standard which is attained by the tested compound. NA<br>
stands for "not active" at concentrations less than 10 micromolar. As is known EC50<br>
is the concentration at which half of a given compound's maximal activity is<br>
observed.<br>
Generally speaking alpha2 agonists, can alleviate sympathetically-sensitized<br>
conditions that are typically associated with periods of stress. These include 1) the<br>
increased sensitivity to stimuli such as intracranial pressure, light and noise<br>
characteristic of migraines and other headaches; 2) the increased sensitivity to colonic<br>
stimuli characteristic of Irritable Bowel Syndrome and other GI disorders such as<br>
functional dyspepsia; 3) the sensation of itch associated with psoriasis and other<br>
dermatological conditions; 4) muscle tightness and spasticity; 5) sensitivity to<br>
normally innocuous stimuli such as light touch and spontaneous pain characteristic of<br>
conditions like fibromyalgia; 6) various cardiovascular disorders involving<br>
hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac ischemia and peripheral vasoconstriction; 7)<br>
metabolic disorders including obesity and insulin resistance; 8) behavioral disorders<br>
such as drug and alcohol dependence, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's<br>
syndrome, attention deficit disorder, anxiety and depression; 9) altered function of the<br>
immune system such as autoimmune diseases including lupus erythematosis and dry<br>
eye disorders; 10) chronic inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease and<br>
gastritis; 11) sweating (hyperhydrosis) and shivering; and 12) sexual dysfunction.<br>
Alpha2 agonists including alpha2B/2C agonists are also useful in the treatment<br>
of glaucoma, elevated intraocular pressure, neurodegenerative diseases including<br>
Alzheimer's, Parkinsons, ALS, schizophrenia, ischemic nerve injury such as stroke or<br>
spinal injury, and retinal injury as occurs in glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic<br>
retinopathy, retinal dystrophies, Lebers optic neuropathy, other optic neuropathies,<br>
optic neuritis often associated with multiple sclerosis, retinal vein occlusions, and<br>
1.<br><br>
following procedures such as photodynamic therapy and LASIX. Also included are<br>
chronic pain conditions such as cancer pain, post-operative pain, allodynic pain,<br>
neuropathic pain, CRPS or causalgia, visceral pain.<br>
A compound is considered selective agonist of alpha2B and/or alpha^<br>
adrenergic receptors in preference over alpha2A receptors, if the compound is at least<br>
ten (10) times more active towards either alpha^ or towards alpha2c receptors than<br>
towards alpha2A receptors. It can be seen from these tables that the compounds of the<br>
invention are specific or selective agonists of alpha2B and/or alpine adrenergic<br>
receptors within the former definition, and in fact have no agonist like activity or only<br>
insignificant agonist-like activity on alpha2A receptors.<br>
Thus, the imidazole-2-thione compounds of the invention are useful for treating<br>
conditions and diseases which are responsive to treatment by alpha2B and/or alpha2c<br>
adrenergic receptor agonists. Such conditions and diseases include, but are not limited<br>
to, pain including chronic pain (which may be, without limitation visceral,<br>
inflammatory, referred or neuropathic in origin) neuropathic pain, corneal pain,<br>
glaucoma, reducing elevated intraocular pressure, ischemic neuropathies and other<br>
neurodegenerative diseases, diarrhea, and nasal congestion. Chronic pain may arise as<br>
a result of, or be attendant to, conditions including without limitation: arthritis,<br>
(including rheumatoid arthritis), spondylitis, gouty arthritis, osteoarthritis, juvenile<br>
arthritis, and autoimmune diseases including without limitation, lupus erythematosus.<br>
Visceral pain may include, without limitation, pain caused by cancer or attendant to<br>
the treatment of cancer as, for example, by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In<br>
addition, the compounds of this invention are useful for treating muscle spasticity<br>
including hyperactive micturition, diuresis, withdrawal syndromes, neurodegenerative<br>
diseases including optic neuropathy, spinal ischemia and stroke, memory and<br>
cognition deficits, attention deficit disorder, psychoses including manic disorders,<br>
anxiety, depression, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiac ischemia and nasal<br>
congestion, chronic gastrointestinal inflammations, Crohn's disease, gastritis, irritable<br>
bowel disease (IBD), functional dyspepsia and ulcerative colitis. Surprisingly,<br>
although the selective alpha2B or alpha2c adrenergic receptor agonist activity of the<br><br>
imidazole-2-one compounds cannot be demonstrated in the RS AT assay, these<br>
compounds also are useful for treating the same conditions.<br>
The activity of the compounds of the invention is highly advantageous because<br>
the administration of these compounds to mammals does not result in sedation or in<br>
significant cardivascular effects (such as changes in blood pressure or heart rate).<br>
The compounds of the invention act and can be used as a highly effective<br>
analgesic, particularly in chronic pain models, with minimal undesirable side effects,<br>
such as sedation and cardiovascular depression, commonly seen with other agonists of<br>
the ct2 receptors.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered at pharmaceutically<br>
effective dosages. Such dosages are normally the minimum dose necessary to achieve<br>
the desired therapeutic effect; in the treatment of chromic pain, this amount would be<br>
roughly that necessary to reduce the discomfort caused by the pain to tolerable levels.<br>
Generally, such doses will be in the range 1-1000 mg/day; more preferably in the<br>
range 10 to 500 mg/day. However, the actual amount of the compound to be<br>
administered in any given case will be determined by a physician taking into account<br>
the relevant circumstances, such as the severity of the pain, the age and weight of the<br>
patient, the patient's general physical condition, the cause of the pain, and the route of<br>
administration.<br>
The compounds are useful in the treatment of pain in a mammal; particularly a<br>
human being. Preferably, the patient will be given the compound orally in any<br>
acceptable form, such as a tablet, liquid, capsule, powder and the like. However, other<br>
routes may be desirable or necessary, particularly if the patient suffers from nausea.<br>
Such other routes may include, without exception, transdermal, parenteral,<br>
subcutaneous, intranasal, intrathecal, intramuscular, intravenous, and intrarectal<br>
modes of delivery. Additionally, the formulations may be designed to delay release of<br>
the active compound over a given period of time, or to carefully control the amount of<br>
drug released at a given time during the course of therapy.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is drawn to therapeutic compositions<br>
comprising the compounds of Formula 1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of<br><br>
these compounds and a phannaceutically acceptable excipient. Such an excipient may<br>
be a carrier or a diluent; this is usually mixed with the active compound, or permitted<br>
to dilute or enclose the active compound. If a diluent, the carrier may be solid, semi-<br>
solid, or liquid material that acts as a excipient or vehicle for the active compound.<br>
The formulations may also include wetting agents, emulsifying agents, preserving<br>
agents, sweetening agents, and/or flavoring agents. If used as in an ophthalmic or<br>
infusion format, the formulation will usually contain one or more salt to influence the<br>
osmotic pressure of the formulation.<br>
In another aspect, the invention is directed to methods for the treatment of pain,<br>
particularly chronic pain, through the administration of one or more compounds of<br>
Formula 1 or phannaceutically acceptable salts thereof to a mammal in need<br>
thereof. As indicated above, the compound will usually be formulated in a form<br>
consistent with the desired mode of delivery.<br>
It is known that chronic pain (such as pain from cancer, arthritis, and many<br>
neuropathic injuries) and acute pain (such as that pain produced by an immediate<br>
mechanical stimulus, such as tissue section, pinch, prick, or crush) are distinct<br>
neurological phenomena mediated to a large degree either by different nerve fibers<br>
and neuroreceptors or by a rearrangement or alteration of the function of these nerves<br>
upon chronic stimulation. Sensation of acute pain is transmitted quite quickly,<br>
primarily by afferent nerve fibers termed C fibers, which normally have a high<br>
threshold for mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimulation. While the mechanisms<br>
of chronic pain are not completely understood, acute tissue injury can give rise within<br>
minutes or hours after the initial stimulation to secondary symptoms, including a<br>
regional reduction in the magnitude of the stimulus necessary to elicit a pain response.<br>
This phenomenon, which typically occurs in a region emanating from (but larger than)<br>
the site of the original stimulus, is termed hyperalgesia. The secondary response can<br>
give rise to profoundly enhanced sensitivity to mechanical or thermal stimulus.<br>
The A afferent fibers (A(5 and A5 fibers) can be stimulated at a lower threshold<br>
than C fibers, and appear to be involved in the sensation of chronic pain. For<br>
example, under normal conditions, low threshold stimulation of these fibers (such as a<br><br>
light brush or tickling) is not painful. However, under certain conditions such as those<br>
following nerve injury or in the herpes virus-mediated condition known as shingles<br>
the application of even such a light touch or the brush of clothing can be very painful.<br>
This condition is termed allodynia and appears to be mediated at least in part by Ap<br>
afferent nerves. C fibers may also be involved in the sensation of chronic pain, but if<br>
so it appears clear that persistent firing of the neurons over time brings about some<br>
sort of change which now results in the sensation of chronic pain.<br>
By "acute pain" is meant immediate, usually high threshold, pain brought about<br>
by injury such as a cut, crush, burn, or by chemical stimulation such as that<br>
experienced upon exposure to capsaicin, the active ingredient in chili peppers.<br>
By "chronic pain" is meant pain other than acute pain, such as, without<br>
limitation, neuropathic pain, visceral pain (including that brought about by Crohn's<br>
disease and irritable bowel syndrome (DBS)), and referred pain.<br>
The following in vivo assays can be employed to demonstrate the biological activity<br>
of the compounds of the invention.<br>
Sedative Activity<br>
To test sedation, six male Sprague-Dawley rats are given up to 3 mg/kg of the<br>
test compound in a saline or DMSO vehicle by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.).<br>
Sedation is graded 30 minutes following administration of the drug by monitoring<br>
locomotor skills as follows.<br>
The Sprague-Dawley rats are weighed and 1 ml/kg body weight of an<br>
appropriate concentration (ie. 3 mg/ml for a final dose of 3 mg/kg) drug solution is<br>
injected intraperitoneally. Typically the test compound is formulated in<br>
approximately 10 to 50 % DMSO. The results are compared to controls that are<br>
injected with 1 ml/kg saline or 10 to 50% DMSO. Rat activity is then determined 30<br>
minutes after injection of the drug solution. Rats are placed in a dark covered chamber<br>
and a digicom analyzer (Omnitech Electronic) quantitates their exploratory behavior<br>
for a five-minute period. The machine records each time the rat interrupts an array of<br>
32 photoelectric beams in the X and Y orientation.<br><br>
Representative Compounds 18,23,49 and 61 of the invention were tested in<br>
this assay intraperitoneally and up to a dose of 1 nag/kg, and were found to have no<br>
sedative effect. The results in this test with other compounds of the invention are<br>
also expected to show that the compounds of the invention have no significant<br>
sedatory activity.<br>
Effects on Cardiovascular System<br>
To test the effect of the compounds on the cardiovascular system, typically six<br>
cynomolgus monkeys are given 500 |xg/kg of the test compound by intravenous<br>
injection (i.v.) Or 3 mg/kg by oral gavage. The effects of the compound on the<br>
animals' blood pressure and heart rate is measured at time intervals from 30 minutes<br>
to six hours following administration of the drug. The peak change from a baseline<br>
measurement taken 30 minutes before drug administration is recorded using a blood<br>
pressure cuff modified for use on monkeys.<br>
Specifically and typically the monkeys are weighed (approximately 4 kg) and<br>
an appropriate volume (0.1 ml/kg) of a 5 mg/ml solution of the test compound<br>
formulated in 10 to 50 % DMSO is injected into the cephalic vein in the animals' arm.<br>
Cardiovascular measurements are made with a BP 100S automated<br>
sphygmomanometer (Nippon Colin, Japan) at 0.5,1,2,4 and 6 hours.<br>
The results of this test show that the compounds of the invention have no or<br>
only minimal detectable effect on the cardiovascular system.<br>
Alleviation of Acute Pain<br>
Models to measure sensitivity to acute pain have typically involved the acute<br>
application of thermal stimuli; such a stimulus causes a programmed escape<br>
mechanism to remove the affected area from the stimulus. The proper stimulus is<br>
thought to involve the activation of high threshold thermoreceptors and C fiber dorsal<br>
root ganglion neurons that transmit the pain signal to the spinal cord.<br>
The escape response may be "wired" to occur solely through spinal neurons,<br>
which receive the afferent input from the stimulated nerve receptors and cause the<br>
"escape" neuromuscular response, or may be processed supraspinally - that is, at the<br>
level of the brain. A commonly used method to measure nociceptive reflexes involves<br><br>
quantification of the withdrawal or licking of the rodent paw following thermal<br>
excitation. See Ding, D.M. et al., J. Neurosci. Methods 76:183-191 (1997) and<br>
Hargreaves, K. et al., Pain 32:77-88 (1988), hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
In a variation of this latter model, male Sprague-Dawley rats are tested by<br>
being placed on a commercially available thermal stimulus device constructed as<br>
described in Hargreaves et al. This device consists of a box containing a glass plate.<br>
The nociceptive stimulus is provided by a focused projection bulb that is movable,<br>
permitting the stimulus to be applied to the heel of one or both hindpaws of the test<br>
animal. A timer is actuated with the light source, and the response latency (defined as<br>
the time period between application of the stimulus and an abrupt withdrawal of the<br>
hindpaw) is registered by use of a photodiode motion sensor array that turns off the<br>
timer and light. Stimulus strength can be controlled by current regulation to the light<br>
source. Heating is automatically terminated after 20 seconds to prevent tissue damage.<br>
Typically four test animals per group are weighed (approximately 0.3 kg) and<br>
injected intraperitonealy (i.p.) with 1 ml/kg of the test compound formulated in<br>
approximately 10 to 50% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle. Animals typically<br>
receive a 0.1 mg/kg and.a 1 mg/kg dose of the three compounds. Rats are acclimated<br>
to the test chamber for about 15 minutes prior to testing. The paw withdrawal latency<br>
is measured at 30,60 and 120 minutes after drug administration. The right and left<br>
paws are tested 1 minute apart, and the response latencies for each paw are averaged.<br>
Stimulus intensity is sufficient to provide a temperature of 45-50 degrees centigrade to<br>
each rat hindpaw.<br>
The results in this test are expected to show that the compounds of the<br>
invention do not provide analgesic effects in this bioassay of acute pain.<br>
Alleviation of Chronic Pain<br>
A model in accordance with Kim and Chung 1992, Pain 150, pp 355-363<br>
(Chung model), for chronic pain (in particular peripheral neuropathy) involves the<br>
surgical ligation of the L5 (and optionally the L6) spinal nerves on one side in<br>
experimental animals. Rats recovering from the surgery gain weight and display a<br>
level of general activity similar to that of normal rats. However, these rats develop<br><br>
abnormalities of the foot, wherein the hindpaw is moderately everted and the toes are<br>
held together. More importantly, the hindpaw on the side affected by the surgery<br>
appears to become sensitive to pain from low-threshold mechanical stimuli, such as<br>
that producing a faint sensation of touch in a human, within about 1 week following<br>
surgery. This sensitivity to normally non-painful touch is called "tactile allodynia"<br>
and lasts for at least two months. The response includes lifting the affected hindpaw<br>
to escape from the stimulus, licking the paw and holding it in the air for many<br>
seconds. None of these responses is normally seen in the control group.<br>
Rats are anesthetized before surgery. The surgical site is shaved and prepared<br>
either with betadine or Novacaine. Incision is made from the thoracic vertebra Xlll<br>
down toward the sacrum. Muscle tissue is separated from the spinal vertebra (left side)<br>
at the L4 - S2 levels. The L6 vertebra is located and the transverse process is carefully<br>
removed with a small rongeur to expose the L4 - L6 spinal nerves. The L5 and L6<br>
spinal nerves are isolated and tightly ligated with 6-0 silk thread. The same procedure<br>
is done on the right side as a control, except no ligation of the spinal nerves is<br>
performed.<br>
A complete hemostasis is confirmed, then the wounds are sutured. A small<br>
amount of antibiotic ointment is applied to the incised area, and the rat is transferred<br>
to the recovery plastic cage under a regulated heat-temperature lamp. On the day of<br>
the experiment, at least seven days after the surgery, typically six rats per test group<br>
are administered the test drugs by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or oral gavage. For<br>
i.p. injection, the compounds are formulated in approximately 10 to 50% DMSO and<br>
given in a volume of 1 ml/kg body weight.<br>
Tactile allodynia is measured prior to and 30 minutes after drug administration<br>
using von Frey hairs that are a series of fine hairs with incremental differences in<br>
stiffness. Rats are placed in a plastic cage with a wire mesh bottom and allowed to<br>
acclimate for approximately 30 minutes. The von Frey hairs are applied<br>
perpendicularly through the mesh to the mid-plantar region of the rats' hindpaw with<br>
sufficient force to cause slight buckling and held for 6-8 seconds. The applied force<br>
has been calculated to range from 0.41 to 15.1 grams. If the paw is sharply<br><br>
withdrawn, it is considered a positive response. A normal animal will not respond to<br>
stimuli in this range, but a surgically ligated paw will be withdrawn in response to a 1-<br>
2 gram hair. The 50% paw withdrawal threshold is determined using tine method of<br>
Dixon, W.J., Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 20:441-462 (1980). The post-drug<br>
threshold is compared to the pre-drug threshold and the percent reversal of tactile<br>
sensitivity is calculated based on a normal threshold of 15.1 grams. The results are<br>
expressed in per cent (%) MPE, where the MPE value reflects the percentage reversal<br>
of pain threshold to that of a normal animal (100 %). Table 3 below indicates results<br>
of this test with Compounds 1,7 and 29 of the invention, administered i.p. and in oral<br>
doses. The doses and the observed MPE values (± SEM) are shown in the table.<br><br><br>

The results shown in Table 3 illustrate that these compounds of the invention<br>
significantly alleviate allodynic pain, and based on these test and/or on the compounds<br><br>
ability to activate alpha2B and/or alpha2c adrenergic receptors in preference over<br>
alpha2A adrenergic receptors, the compounds of the invention are expected to be useful<br>
as analgesics to alleviate allodynia and chronic pain.<br>
SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS, EXPERIMENTAL<br><br>
A solution of 3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2H-pentalen-l-one (Intermediate Al)<br>
(prepared in accordance with Cooke et al. J. Org Chem. 1980,45,1046, incorporated<br>
herein by reference ) (1.5 g, 12.3 mmol) in MeOH (30 mL) and CeCl3-7H20 (3.6 g,<br>
14.6 mmol) at 0 °C was treated with NaBH4 (494 mg, 14.6 mmol). The solution was<br>
allowed to warm to rt and stirring was continued for 30 min. Water (100 mL) and<br>
diethyl ether (150 mL) were added. The organic layer was dried over MgSC&gt;4, filtered<br>
and evaporated to dryness. The alcohol (Intermediate A2) was used in the next step<br>
without further purification.<br>
A solution of the alcohol (Intermediate A2) (0.85 g, 6.9 mmol) in efhyl vinyl<br>
ether (50 mL) at rt was treated with Hg(OAc)2 (1.75 g, 5.5 mmol) at rt for 18h. The<br>
mixture was quenched with 5-10% KOH solution (80 mL) and the product was<br><br>
extracted with 50% ether:hexane (3 x 80 mL) and dried over MgSO4. The organic<br>
layer was filtered and evaporated under vacuum. The crude vinyl ether (Intermediate<br>
A3) was used directly in the next step.<br>
A solution of 4M LiC104 in ether (15 mL) was treated with the crude vinyl<br>
ether (Intermediate, A3) (-0.90 g). The mixture was allowed to stir for 20-30 min. at<br>
rt. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted with ether (3 x 75 mL).<br>
The organic layers were combined, dried over MgSO4 and evaporated to give the<br>
crude aldehyde (Intermediate A4).<br>
The following preparation followed the procedure by Home et al.<br>
Heterocycles, 1994, 39,139, incorporated herein by reference. A solution of the<br>
aldehyde (Intermediate A24) (0.85 g, 5.6 mmol) in EtOH (15 mL) was treated with<br>
tosylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC available from Aldrich, 1.1 g, 5.6 mmol) and NaCN<br>
(-15 mg, cat). This mixture was allowed to stir at rt for 20 min. The solvent was<br>
removed in vacuo and the residue was dissolved in ~ 7M NH3 in MeOH and<br>
transferred to a resealable tube. This mixture was heated to at 100 °C for 15h. The<br>
mixture was concentrated and purified by chromatography on SiOj with 5% MeOH<br>
(sat. w/ NH3) '.CELjC^- The imidazole was purified further as the fumarate salt<br>
(Intermediate A25).<br>
A solution of 4-(l,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydro-pentalen-l-ylmethyl)-lH-imidazole;<br>
fumarate salt (Intermediate A25) (160 mg, 0.5 mmol) in THF (3 mL) and water (3<br>
mL) was treated with NaHC03 (420 mg, 5 mmol) at rt for 20 min. Phenylchloro<br>
thionoformate (available from Aldrich, 180 uL, 1.3 mmol) was added and stirring was<br>
continued for 4h. The mixture was diluted with water (15 mL) and extracted with<br>
ether (3 x 25 mL). The organic portions were combined, dried over MgSO4, filtered<br>
and freed of solvent. The residue was dissolved in MeOH (4 mL) and treated with<br>
NEt3 (0.35 mL) for 18h. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the product was<br>
washed on a glass frit with 50% CH^CLjhexanes to give a white solid (-50%) 4-<br>
