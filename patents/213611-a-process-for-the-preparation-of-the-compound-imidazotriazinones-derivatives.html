 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 ; rule 13]<br><br><br><br>
"A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPOUND<br>
IMIDEGTRIAGINONES DELLVATRIES."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
BAYER HEALTHCARE AG, a body corporate organised under the laws of Germany, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The invention relates to 7-(4-tert butyl-cyclohexyl)-iraidazotriazinones, processes for their preparation and their use in medicaments, esp. for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of inflammatory processes and/or immune diseases.<br>
Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a family of enzymes responsible for the metabolism of the intracellular second messengers cAMP (eye lie adenosine monophosphate) and cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate). PLE 4, as a cAMP specific PDE, catalyses the conversion of cAMP to AMP and if the major if not sole isoform of the phosphodiesterase enzymes present in inflammatory and immune cell types. Inhibition of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of cAMP which, in these cells, leads to the inhibition of a range of pro-inflammatory functions. Uncontrolled production of inflammatory mediators can lead to acute and chronic inflammation, tissue damage, multi-organ failures and to death. Additionally, elevation of phagoÂ¬cyte cAMP leads to inhibition of oxygen radical production. This cell function is more sensitive than others such as aggregation or enzyme release.<br>
It is now recognised that both asthma and COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases. In the case of asthma the eosinophil is the predominant infiltrating cell. Subsequent release of superoxide radicals as well as damaging cationic proteins from these infiltrating cells are believed to play a role in the progression of the disease and development of airway hyperreactivity.<br>
By contrast, in COPD the neutrophil is the predominant inflammatory cell type found in the lungs of sufferers. The action of mediators and proteases released in the environment of the lung is believed to result in the irreversible airway obstruction seen in COPD. In particular the action of proteases in degrading the lung matrix results in fewer alveoli and is likely to be the major cause of accelerated long term lung function decline seen in this disease.<br><br>
Treatment with a PDE 4 inhibitor is expected to reduce the inflammatory cell burden in the lung in both of these diseases [M.S. Barnette, "PDE 4 inhibitors in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", in: Progress in Drug Research, Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, 1999, pp. 193-229; H.J. Dyke and J.G. Montana, "The therapeutic potential of PDE 4 inhibitors", Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 8, 1301-1325 (1999)].<br>
While PDE 4-inhibitors also usually produce side effects like vomiting, it has been shown that these side effects correlate with the affinity to a high affinity binding site for rolipram, and that emesis is reduced in compounds with a decreased affinity to this binding site (J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39,120-125).<br>
 WO 99/24433 AnD WO 99/67244/describe 2 -phenyl-imidazotriazinones as synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of 2-(aminosulfonyl-phenyl)-imidazotriazinones as inhibitors of cGMP-metabolizing phosphodiesterases.<br>
US-A-4,278,673 discloses 2-aryl-imidazotriazinones with cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitory activity for the treatment of i.a. asthma.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of the general formula (I)<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 denotes (C6-C10)-aryl, which is optionally substituted by identical or different residues selected from the group consisting of halogen, (C1-C4)-alkyl, tri-fluoromethyl, cyano, nitro und trifluoromethoxy, or<br><br>

The process according to the invention can be illustrated using the following scheme as an example:<br><br><br>
Solvents which are suitable for the individual steps are the customary organic solvents which do not change under the reaction conditions. These preferably include ethers, such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, glycol dimethyl ether, or hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane or mineral oil fractions, or halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, trichloroethylene or chlorobenzene, or ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, acetonitrile, acetone,<br><br>
dimethoxyethane or pyridine. It is also possible to use mixtures of the above-mentioned solvents. Particular preference is given to ethanol for the reaction II/IIa + III â&gt; IV/IVa and dichloroethane for the cyclisation IV â âº I.<br>
The reaction temperature can generally be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the reaction is carried out in a range of from -20Â°C to 200Â°C, preferably of fromOÂ°C to lOOÂ°C.<br>
The process steps according to the invention are generally carried out under atmospheric pressure. However, it is also possible to operate under superatmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure (for example, in a range of from 0.5 to 5 bar).<br>
The compounds of the general formula (IVa) are preferably hydrolysed to compounds of the general formula (V) under acidic conditions as for example in refluxing 2N hydrochloric acid.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (V) are condensed with the compounds of the general formula (VI) to compounds of the general formula (IV) in inert solvents, if appropriate in the presence of a base.<br>
Suitable inert solvents are the customary organic solvents which do not change under the reaction conditions. These preferably include ethers, such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrabydrofuran, glycol dimethyl ether, or hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane or mineral oil fractions, or halogenated hydroÂ¬carbons, such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, dichloro-ethylene, trichloroethylene or chlorobenzene, or ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethoxyethane or pyridine. It is also possible to use mixtures of the abovementioned solvents.<br>
Suitable bases are generally alkali metal hydrides or alkali metal alkoxides, such as, for example, sodium hydride or potassium tert-butoxide, or cyclic amines, such as,<br><br>
for example, piperidine, pyridine, dimethylaminopyridine or (C1-C4)- alkylamines, such as, for example, triethylamine. Preference is given to triethylamine, pyridine and/or dimethylaminopyridine.<br>
The base is generally employed in an amount of from 1 mol to 4 mol, preferably from 1.2 mol to 3 mol, in each case based on 1 mol of the compound of the formula (V).<br>
The reaction temperature can generally be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the reaction is carried out in a range of from -20Â°C to 200Â°C, preferably of fromOÂ°C to lOOÂ°C.<br>
Some of the compounds of the general formula (IT) are known, or they are novel, and they can then be prepared by<br>
converting compounds of the general formula (VI)<br>
R2-CO-T	(VI)<br>
in which<br>
R2       is as defined above<br>
and<br>
T        represents halogen,.preferably chlorine,<br>
initially by reaction with Î±-amino-butyric acid in inert solvents, if appropriate in the presence of a base and trimethylsilyl chloride, into the compounds of the general formula (VII),<br><br><br>
in which<br>
is as defined above, and finally reacting with the compound of the formula (VIII)<br><br>
in which<br>
L        is as defined above,<br>
in inert solvents, if appropriate in the presence of a base.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (IIa) can be prepared analogously.<br>
Suitable solvents for the individual steps of the process are the customary organic solvents which do not change under the reaction conditions. These preferably include ethers, such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, glycol dimethyl ether, or hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane or mineral oil fractions, or halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene or chlorobenzene, or ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethoxyethane or pyridine. It is also possible to use mixtures of the above-mentioned solvents. Particular preference is given to dichloromethane for the first step and to a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and pyridine for the second step.<br>
Suitable bases are generally alkali metal hydrides or alkali metal alkoxides, such as, for example, sodium hydride or potassium tert-butoxide, or cyclic amines, such as,<br><br>
for example, piperidine, pyridine, dimethylaminopyridine or (Ci-C^-alkylamines, such as, for example, triethylamine. Preference is given to triethylamine, pyridine and/or dimethylaminopyridine.<br>
The base is generally employed in an amount of from 1 mol to 4 mol, preferably from 1.2 mol to 3 mol, in each case based on 1 mol of the compound of the formula (V).<br>
The reaction temperature can generally be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the reaction is carried out in a range of from -20Â°C to 200Â°C, preferably of fromOÂ°C to lOOÂ°C.<br>
The compounds of the general formulae (VI) and (VIII) are known per se, or they can be prepared by customary methods.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (III) are known or can be prepared by<br>
reacting compounds of the general formula (IX)<br>
R1--Y	(IX)<br>
in which<br>
Rl       is as defined above, and<br>
Y        represents a cyano, carboxyl, methoxycarbonyl or ethoxycarbonyl group,<br>
with ammonium chloride in toluene and in the presence of trimethylaluminium in hexane in a temperature range of from -20Â°C to room temperature, preferably at 0Â°C and atmospheric pressure, and reacting the resulting amidine, if appropriate in situ, with hydrazine hydrate.<br><br>
The compounds of the general formula (IX) are known per se, or they can be prepared by customary methods.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (I) inhibit the PDE 4 resident in the membranes of human neutrophils and display an especially favourable binding profile versus the PDE 4 high affinity site, binding to which is made responsible for side effects like emesis. One measured functional consequence of this inhibition was inhibition of superoxide anion production by stimulated human neutrophils.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (I) can therefore be employed in medicaments for the treatment of inflammatory processes, esp. acute and chronic inflammatory processes, and/or immune diseases.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are preferably suitable for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory processes, i.e. acute and chronic inflammatory processes, and/or immune diseases, such as emphysema, alveolitis, shock lung, all kinds of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), asthma, bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, eosinophilic granuloma, arteriosclerosis, arthrosis, inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract, myocarditis, bone resorption diseases, reperfusion injury, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type I diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, anaphylactoid purpura nephritis, chronic glomerulonephritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, other benign and malignant proliferative skin diseases, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, arterial restenosis, sepsis and septic shock, toxic shock syndrome, grafts vs. host reaction, allograft rejection, treatment of cytokine-mediated chronic tissue degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, coronary insufficiency, myalgias, multiple sclerosis, malaria, AIDS, cachexia, prevention of tumor growth and tissue invasion, leukemia, depression, memory impairment and acute stroke. The compounds according to the invention are additionally suitable for reducing the damage to infarct tissue after reoxygenation.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) according to the invention can be used as active compound components for the production of medicaments. For this, they can be converted into the customary formulations such as tablets, coated tablets, aerosols, pills, granules, syrups, emulsions, suspensions and solutions in a known manner using inert, non-toxic, pharmaceutically suitable excipients or solvents. Preferably, the compounds according to the invention are used here in an amount such that their concentration in the total mixture is approximately 0.5 to approximately 90% by weight, the concentration, inter alia, being dependent on the corresponding indication of the medicament.<br>
The above-mentioned formulations are produced, for example, by extending the active compounds with solvents and/or excipients having the above properties, where, if appropriate, additionally emulsifiers or dispersants and, in the case of water as the solvent, alternatively an organic solvent, have to be added.<br>
Administration is carried out in a customary manner, preferably orally, transdermally or parenterally, for example perlingually, buccally, intravenously, nasally, rectally or inhalationally.<br>
For human use, in the case of oral administration, it is recommendable to administer doses of from 0.001 to 50 mg/kg, preferably of 0.01 mg/kg - 20 mg/kg. In the case of parenteral administration, such as, for example, intravenously or via mucous membranes nasally, buccally or inhalationally, it is recommendable to use doses of 0.001 mg/kg-0.5 mg/kg.<br>
In spite of this, if appropriate, it may be necessary to depart from the amounts mentioned above, namely depending on the body weight or the type of administration route, on the individual response towards the medicament, the manner of its formulation and the time or interval at which administration takes place. Thus, in some cases it may be sufficient to manage with less than the above mentioned<br><br>
minimum amount, while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, it may be recom-mendable to divide these into several individual doses over the course of the day.<br>
Test descriptions<br>
1.	Preparation of human PMN<br>
Human PMN (polymorphonuclear neutrophil leucocytes) are readily purified from peripheral blood. Phosphodiesterase in these cells is predominantly located in the membrane fraction. Inhibitory potency of compounds against this preparation correlate well with the anti-inflammatory activity as measured by inhibiton of superoxide production.<br>
Blood was taken- from healthy subjects by venous puncture and neutrophils were purified by dextran sedimentation and density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll Histopaque and resuspended in the buffered medium.<br>
2.	Assay of human PMN phosphodiesterase<br>
This was performed as a particulate fraction from human PMN essentially as described by Souness and Scott [Biochem. J. 29J., 389-395 (1993)]. Particulate fractions were treated with sodium vanadate/glutathione as described by the authors to express the descrete stereospecific site on the phosphodiesterase enzyme. The prototypical PDE 4 inhibitor, rolipram, had an IC5o value in the range 450 nM-1500 nM, thus defining this preparation as the so-called "low affinity" [L] form. The preparation examples had IC50 values within the range of 0.1 nM - 10,000 nM.<br>
3.        Inhibition of FMLP-stimulated production of superoxide radical anions<br><br>
Neutrophils (2.5 x 105 ml"-1) were mixed with cytochrome C (1.2 mg/ml) in the wells of a microtitre plate. Compounds according to the invention were added in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). Compound concentration ranged from 2.5 nM to 10 uM, the DMSO concentration was 0.1% v/v in all wells. After addition of cytochalasin b (5 Î¼g x ml*1) the plate was incubated for 5 min at 37Â°C. Neutrophils were then stimulated by addition of 4 x 10'-8M FMLP (N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe) and superoxide generation measured as superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of cytochrome C by monitoring the OD550 in a Thermomax microtitre plate spectrophotometer. Initial rates were calculated using a Softmax kinetic calculation programme. Blank wells contained 200 units of superoxide dismutase.<br>
The inhibition of superoxide production was calculated as follows:<br><br>
Rx = Rate of the well containing the compound according to the invention<br>
Ro = Rate in the control well<br>
Rb = Rate in the superoxide dismutase containing blank well<br>
The preparation examples had IC50 values within the range of 0.1 nM -10,000 nM.<br>
4.        Assay of binding to the rolipram binding site (PDE 4 high affinity site; "H-PDE 4 form") in rat brain membranes<br>
The activity of compounds on the PDE 4 high affinity site ("H-PDE 4 form") is readily measured by determining their potency for displacement of  [3H]-<br><br>
rolipram from its binding site in rat brain membranes. Activity at this site is believed to be a measure of side effect potential (e.g. stimulation of stomach acid secretion, nausea and emesis).<br>
The rolipram binding site assay was performed essentially as described by Schneider et al. [Eur. J. Pharmacol. 127., 105-115 (1986)].<br>
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - induced neutrophil influx into rat lung<br>
Intranasal administration of LPS to rats causes a marked influx of neutrophils into the lungs measurable by histological or biochemical (myeloperoxidase content of the ceil pellet) analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 24 h later. Rats were treated with test compound or vehicle administered by the oral route 1 h prior to and 6 h after administration of intranasal LPS. 24 hours later animals were euthanatized and their lungs lavaged with PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Neutrophil and total cell numbers were analysed.<br>
Emetic potential in the marmoset<br>
Vehicle or test compound was administered by the oral route to conscious marmosets. Animals were observed for emetic episodes or abnormal behaviour for 1 h post dosing. In some experiments, if no adverse response was seen, a separate group of animals was tested at 1/2 log dose higher until emesis or abnormal behaviour was observed. The highest dose at which no abnormal behavior or emetic episodes occurred was recorded as the NOEL.<br><br>
