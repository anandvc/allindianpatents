THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br>
3 1 JAN 2005<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an antispasmodic formulation in stable injectable form and to a method  of making the same particularly for the treatment of colicky pain.<br>
r<br>
Colicky abdominal pain may be caused by spasm of smooth muscles of various internal abdominal organs such as intestinal colic, biliary colic, renal colic and dysmenorrhoea.<br>
WHAT THE INVENTION ENVISAGES<br>
This invention envisages an injectable stable composition containing Camylofin dihydrochloride .<br>
The injectable composition containing camylofin dihydrochloride in accordance with this invention is stable and effective in relief of spasm.<br>
Therapeutic effective amount of Camylofin used in the formulation preferably as camylofin dihydrochloride or any pharmaceutically acceptable salt form or any other steriochemical pure form of it.<br>
The formulation whose pH is maintained between 4.0 and 7.0 throughout its shelf life, . preferably contains propylethylene glycols - 300, propylethylene glycols - 400, as a solvent and propylene glycols, at least one antioxidant, at least one chelating agent, at least one preservative, and one surfactant and water for injection .<br>
The formulation is typically meant to be administrated into the human body either by slow intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular route.<br>
2<br><br>
CAMYLOFIN<br>
Camylofin dihydrochloride chemically it is isopentyl 2-[2-diethylaminoethylamino]-2-phenyl acetate dihydrochloride of molecular weight 393.4, Molecular Formula C19H32N202 2HC1. Camylofin is a pale yellow oil. Camylofin Dihydrochloride is a white crystalline powder melting point 170 °C and 180 °C, soluble in water.<br>
In prior art, chemical structure and pharmaceutical properties of camylofin dihydrochloride have been studied in in detail. Camylofin has a direct papaverine like spasmolytic action on the smooth muscle and a mild atropine like anticholinergic action, making it one of the most potent antispasmodics. It inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase, which in turn causes increase in concentration of cyclic AMP and smooth muscle relaxation. Due to its phosphodiesterase enzyme-IV isoenzyme selectivity, this drug does not interfere with uterine contractility. LD 50 in mice 760 mg/kg orally; 1.35 gm/ kg s.c; 49.2 mg/kg i.v. Camylofin dihydrochloride primarily acts on smooth muscles (intestine, ureter, cervix) whereas its influence on glands, eyes, heart and circulation is slight and of no clinical significance. It has very mild anticholinergic side effects like dryness of mouth, dilatation of pupils, paralysis of accommodation and palpitations ._It has a wide margin of safety. The ratio of the effective therapeutic dose to the toxicity dose in animal studies varied from 1:40 to 1:150.5<br>
In the prior art it was not possible to obtain a stable camylofin in injectable form having a useful extended shelf life. Camylofin hydrolyzes in water and loses its potency quickly in solution. This has acted as a deterrent in making camylofin in an injectable form. The loss of potency is nearly ten percent within a month of manufacture.<br>
3<br><br>
An aspect of the invention comprises the incorporation of ingredients or excipients for making a stable pH adjusted formulation of this invention and comprises at least one adjuvant solvent, at least one antioxidant(s), at least one chelating agent, at least one preservative(s), and at least one surfactant.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a stable injectable antispasmodic formulation comprising camylofin dihydrochloride dissolved in water for injection q.s. , at least one adjuvant glycolic co-solvent, 10 % to 55 % of the total volume of the injectable formulation; at least one pH-adjusting agent in dilute solution to adjust the pH of the formulation to between 4.0 and 7.0, at least one antioxidant, 0% to 5% of the total volume of the formulation; at least one chelating agent, 0% to 4% of the total volume of the formulation; at least one preservative, 0% to 5% of the total volume of the formulation; and at least one surfactant, 0% to 10 % of the total volume of the formulation.<br>
"The formulation includes glycolic co-solvents along with the water for injection which may be one or in combination that is selected from the glycols such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols - 300, polyethylene glycols - 400. Unexpectedly and surprisingly, the co solvent prevents the hydrolysis of camylofm and therefore the camylofin remains stable and potent throughout the period of the shelf life of the product."<br>
The injectable formulation contains antioxidants that mainly prevent the oxidation of the active drug and to stabilize the formulation throughout the shelf life of the formulation. The anti-oxidant used in the formulation<br>
4<br><br>
is selected from the group consisting of sodium metabisulfide, sodium sulfide, sodium disulfide.<br>
The formulation contains chelating agent that forms a complex with the oxidizing agent and thus prevent oxidation of the active drug and thus potentiate the stabilizing action of the other antioxidants used thus stabilize the formulation throughout the shelf life of the formulation. The chelating agent used in the formulation is preferably sodium salt of EDTA (ethylene diamino tetra acetic acid).<br>
The formulation contains surfactant that mainly solubilizes the drug in the medium and thus prevent the precipitation of drug that may occur during the storage of the formulation. The surfactant used in the formulation is selected from the group of polysorbates. The formulation preferably contain polysorbate 80.<br>
Another aspect of the invention comprises the incorporation of ingredients or excipients for adjusting the pH. The pH of the injection is the singlemost crucial parameter for stability of the drug in the formulation. The formulation of this invention comprises at least one pH-adjusting agent in its dilute solution that may be preferably sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, citric acid, ammonium acetate, glacial acetic acid, ammonium acetate, sodium acetate. The pH of the formulation is kept within the range of 4.0 to 7.0 throughout its shelf life.<br>
The formulation contains preservatives that mainly prevent the deterioration of the formulation from the microbial contamination. The preservative used in the formulation is a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
5<br><br>
material and is preferably selected from the group of benzyl alcohol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben and the like . The preservative may be used optionally in the formulation where the quantity of the said adjuvant solvents is more than 40 % of the total volume. The adjuvant solvent itself acting as a preservative. A preferred content of added preservative is from 0.001% to 5% of the total volume of the formulation.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention there is provided a process of making a stable injectable antispasmodic formulation comprising camylofin dihydrochloride which comprises the steps, carried out throughout in an inert atmosphere, of<br>
[a]	dissolving dispensed quantity of camylofin dihydrochloride in fresh water for injection to obtain a clear solution;<br>

"CLINICAL STUDY"<br>
Objective - To determine the efficacy, onset of action, duration of action<br>
and   adverse   reactions   of  intravenous   Camylofin   Dihydrochloride<br>
12<br><br>
injectable formulation in accordance with this invention      given in patients with colic due to smooth muscle spasm.<br>
"METHODOLOGY:"<br>
This multicentric trial was conducted by 35 doctors in the following indications:<br>
1)	Intestinal colic<br>
2)	Renal colic<br>
3)	Biliary colic and<br>
4)	Primary Dysmenorrhea.<br>
Cases requiring surgical intervention were excluded and treated by conventional surgical means.<br>
Children below 12 years were excluded from the study although the drug is not contraindicated in children. This exclusion was made on the basis of the legal problems associated with the clinical trial in children. After diagnosis, severity of pain was graded on a scale of 1- 10. 25mg of camylofin diHCl in 1ml (single ampoule) was given intravenously slowly over a period of l min. The patients were kept under constant observation and following points were noted:<br>
1.	Degree of relief in-patient who responded either good response or no response<br>
2.	Duration of relief<br>
3.	Follow up of repeated dose in patients who required second dose because of recurrence of pain.<br>
4.	Adverse reaction<br>
RESULTS:<br>
13<br><br>
The study was conducted in a total of 209 patients, 73 patients with intestinal colic, 88 patients with renal colic, 36 patients with billiary colic and 12 patients suffering from dysmenorrhea. The severity of pain in all cases were reported on the arithmetical scale of 1 to 10 with numbers 1 to 3 indicating mild pain, numbers 4 to 6 indicating moderate pain and numbers 7 to 10 indicating severe pain.<br>
INTESTINAL COLIC:<br>
Among the 73 patients with intestinal colic, 5 patients had reported mild<br>
pain, 26 patients had reported moderate pain and 42 patients had reported<br>
severe pain. 67 (91 %) patients reported good relief after treatment with<br>
Camylofm Dihydrochloride intravenous injection in accordance with this<br>
invention . The duration of relief was up to 1 hr in 20 cases, between 1-2<br>
hrs in 20 cases and over 2 hrs in 20 cases. Duration of relief was not<br>
reported in 7 cases due to lack of follow up. The dose was required to be<br>
repeated in 13 cases.	,<br>
RENAL COLIC:<br>
Out of 88 patients with renal colic, 4 patients reported mild pain, 20 patients reported moderate pain and 64 patients reported with severe pain. A total of 83 (94%) patients reported good relief after treatment with Camylofm Dihydrochloride intravenous injection. The remaining 5 patients (5.6%) reported no relief after treatment with Camylofm Dihydrochloride intravenous injection. The duration of relief was upto 1 hr in 24 cases, 1 to 2 hrs in 24 cases and over 2 hrs in 25 cases. In 10 patients the duration of relief was not reported due to lack of follow up. A repeat dose was required in 29 patients.<br>
BILIARY COLIC:<br>
14<br><br>
Out of 36 cases reported with biliary colic, 11 patients had moderate pain and 25 cases were reported with severe pain. 33(91%) patients reported good relief after treatment with Camylofin Dihydrochloride intravenous, injection. The duration of relief was up to 1 hr in 7 cases, between 1 to 2 hrs in 12 cases and over 2 hrs in 12 cases. The duration of relief was not reported in 2 cases due to lack o follow-up. The dose was required to be repeated in 15 cases.<br>
DYSMENORRHOEA:<br>
Out of 12 cases reported with dysmenorrhoea, 2 had mild pain, 3 had moderate pain and 7 had severe pain. All 12 (100%) patients reported good relief after treatment with Camylofin Dihydrochloride intravenous injection. The duration of relief was upto 2 hrs in 7 patients and over 2 hrs in 5 patients and the injection was required to be repeated in 2 patients. Therefore, out of the total 209 patients, 195 (95%) patients showed good response to Camylofin Dihydrochloride intravenous injection. The adverse reactions reported were dizziness (10 patients), drowsiness (2 patients), burning at the site of injection (1 patient), Palpitation and fall in blood pressure (2 patients), nausea and vomiting (3 patients) and dryness of mouth (11 patients).<br>
The above result shows that the symptomatic relief with Camylofin Dihydrochloride intravenous injection in accordance with this invention from the colicky pain due to smooth muscle pain in the intestines, renal tract, biliary tract and primary dysmenorrhoea is excellent. However, it must be noted that although all patients should have responded, theoretically there were a small number of treatment failures where there was no relief. It is difficult to conclude as to why some patients did not respond. Possibly the diagnosis of the causative factor for colicky pain<br>
15<br><br>
was not complete or accurate. It is possible that there may have been some surgical causes of the pain in some patients. It is also possible that a higher dose may have been given relief in some of the non-responders. In the above study it is obvious that most of the patients were symptomatically relieved from the colicky pain of the 4 conditions for which the drug was administered. The incidence of adverse reactions was comparatively few and was not severe.<br>
Camylofm Dihydrochloride intravenous injection in accordance with this invention is a very effective treatment for symptomatic relief of abdominal pain caused by spasm of smooth muscles of the abdominal viscera. The adverse reactions were very mild and few.<br>
The requirements to be met by a good antispasmodic are naturally very comprehensive. The following five points should be especially detailed: -<br>
1.	The antispasmodic should act promptly.<br>
2.	Its effect should last as long as possible.<br>
3.	It must be free from side-effects.<br>
4.	Its therapeutic spectrum as regards the organs prone to spasm should be   as extensive as possible.<br>
5.	It is desirable that the drug should have a wide variety of presentations: as tablets, oral solution and injection ampoules."<br>

The toxicity of Camylofm Dihydrochloride   injectable   formulation in<br>
accordance with this invention was found to be low. The medium lethal<br>
dose (LD50) for mice was<br>
Intravenously 40.00 mg. per kilo<br>
Intramuscularly 360.00 mg. per kilo<br>
16<br><br>
A comparison of LD50 with ED50 (medium effective dose producing antispasmodic effects) in various species of animals demonstrated a wide margin of safety, i.e. a therapeutic ratio of 1:40 to 1:150. Tolerance and influence on respiration and circulation were tested on dogs and cats. It was shown that even on administration of ten times the therapeutic dose, especially if administered by slow intravenous injection, no accidents occurred. In accelerated studies, Long-continued use of Camylofm Dihydrochloride did not produce any lesions in parenchymatous organs, in the blood pressure or in metabolism. Camylofm Dihydrochloride had no central point of attack, certainly not in the sense of a central analgesic action. But, according to its chemical structure, it exerted a notable local-anaesthetic effect, which on the rabbit's eye showed intensity comparable to that of cocaine.<br>
Local tolerance:<br>
Any fear that tissue lesion might occur by the direct action of Camylofm Dihydrochloride can therefore be excluded. Repeated intramuscular and subcutaneous injections in numerous histologically controlled experiments did not produce abscesses, inflammation, or necroses. Repeated intravenous injection into rabbit's ear were tolerated without reaction.<br>
The injectable formulation in accordance with this invention was found to be stable in accelerated studies did not exhibit in microbial contamination and no precipitation. The drug remained in solution throughout the shelf life without degradation or reduced potency.<br>
