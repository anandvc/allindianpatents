Detailed Descriptions of Illustrative Embodiments<br>
[25]	Referring now to Figs, la-b, a spray gun 18 includes a spray gun body 20 housing a<br>
nozzle 24. Nozzle 24 is disposed at the front end of the gun body 20 to dispense fluent coating material (hereinafter sometimes paint) from a front end opening 26. An air cap 28 is attached to the front end of the gun body 20 by a retaining ring 30. The air cap 28 has a central atomizing air orifice 32 and a plurality of atomizing air orifices 34 surrounding the central orifice 32. These orifices communicate with a gallery 36 which is coupled to a supply of compressed air. Shaping air orifices 38 are provided on air horns 40 which extend forward from diametrically opposite sides of the air cap 28. The shaping air orifices 38 communicate with a shaping air supply gallery 42 which is also coupled to a supply of compressed air. Shaping air orifices 38 provide air for shaping a spray pattern of paint flowing from the nozzle 24 and atomized by air from atomizing air orifices 32,34.<br><br>
The spray gun 18 includes a valve including a valve body 44 having a somewhat frustoconically shaped front end 46 which cooperates with a complementarily configured valve seat 48 formed by an inner wall of a front portion of the nozzle 24. A needle-like electrode 50 projects forward from valve body 44 and is coupled via its rearward extension through valve body 44 to a terminal of a high-magnitude potential supply 52 by which the particles of coating material become electrically charged as they leave the vicinity of nozzle 24. Spray gun body 20, nozzle 24, air cap 28, and valve body 44 illustratively are constructed from, for example, suitably chemically inert, electrically non-conductive resins or polymers, such as Delrin® or Acetron® brand acetal resin or polyetheretherketone. Electrode 50 illustratively is constructed from metal.<br>
A shaping air control valve 60 is oriented rearwardly from the shaping air supply gallery 42 in a passageway 62 through which shaping air is supplied to gallery 42. Valve 60 includes a stem 64 having a generally part-spherically shaped tip 66. Stem 64 is threaded into a valve stem retaining nut or valve body 68 and captured in valve body 68 by an e-ring 70 which is snapped into a groove 72 provided therefor on stem 64. Valve body 68 is also threaded on its outside surface so that the assembled shaping air control valve 60 can be threaded into a passageway provided in spray gun 18 for this purpose, and includes diametrically opposed flats 73 to assist in threading control valve 60 into spray gun 18. Appropriate Oring seals 75 are provided between valve . stem 64 and valve body 68 to seal the these two against leakage, and between valve 60 and spray gun body 20 to seal the valve 60 into the body 20.<br>
The part-spherical shape of the tip 66 has a radius equal to the radius of the region of the passageway 62 into which the tip 66 protrudes as the valve stem 64 is adjusted axially of the valve stem 64 axis into the passageway 62. The axis about which stem 64 is turned as it is threaded into and out of valve body 68 includes the center of the circular cross section region of passageway 62 in the vicinity of tip 66. This geometry permits the valve 60 to substantially completely shut off the flow of shaping air through passageway 62 to orifices 38 when tip 66 is projected completely into passageway 62.<br>
Valve body 68 is provided with one or more, illustratively two, diametrically opposed, radially extending bores 74. Each bore 74 provides a seat 76 at its radially inner end adjacent stem 64. Seats 76 provide positive stops for an equal number, illustratively two, of detent balls 80. Each ball is spring 82-urged against its seat 76. Valve stem 64 includes a number, illustratively eight, of peripherally equally angularly spaced axially extending grooves or notches 84 into which spring 82-urged balls 80 snap when stem 64 is turned so that one of the grooves or notches 84 is under each ball 80. Stem 64 further includes a control knob 86 at its outer end. Control knob 86 is<br><br>
scalloped 88, knurled or otherwise textured to assist the operator in gripping control knob 86, for example, between a thumb and index finger, to adjust valve 60.<br>
The operator receives the sensation of the detent balls 80 snapping into their respective grooves or notches 84 by feeling and/or hearing the balls 80 snap into their respective grooves or notches 84, Hie operator may thus count the number of 'clicks' from the orientation of the valve 60 in which no fan air is being provided to some number of clicks corresponding to the desired fan shape or pattern of the cloud of atomized coating material particles. Once this number of clicks has been sensed, the operator stops turning knob 86, and a coating operation can commence.<br>
The source of compressed gas or mixture of gases is provided to a passageway controlled by a trigger 90-operated valve 92 forward in spray gun 18 to gallery 36 and, either through valve 92 or independently to passageway 62. Either way, passageway 62 is controlled by separate valve 60. Valve 60 is controlled by the position of knob 86. Valve 60 controls the flow of shaping air to shaping air orifices 38 on horns 40 of air cap) 28. The outside diameter of the valve stem 64 is provided with notches, grooves, or the like, 84. The valve body 68 includes (a) spring 82-loaded ball(s) or the like, 80, which is (are) yieldably urged into a notch, groove, or the like, 84 beneath the ball(s) 80. There is thus provided an indexing fan air adjustment valve 60 that provides an indication to the operator of the adjustment of the valve 60. The operator can use the indication to adjust the valve 60 to provide the desired fan air flow rate* The operator establishes a desired flow rate once, and adjusts the valve 60 closed, counting the number of clicks until the valve 60 closes. The operator is then able to duplicate this   • adjustment by opening the valve 60 the same number of clicks in the same or any subsequent coating operation in which it is desired to provide the same spray pattern for the dispensed coating.<br>
Illustratively, stem 64 is constructed from suitably chemically inert, electrically non-conductive resin or polymer, such as Torlon® 4203 polyamide-imide. Illustratively, valve stem retaining nut or valve body 68 and the spring 82 retaining plugs are constructed from aluminum or suitably chemically inert, electrically non-insulative resins or polymers, such as 30% carbon fiber filled Torlon® 7130 polyamide-imide. Detent balls 80 and springs 82 are illustratively stainless steel.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
