				<td>Method and device for soldering connections using<br>
inductive heating<br>
The invention relates to a method for soldering<br>
connections by inductive heating exhibiting the<br>
features of the preamble of Claim 1, and to a<br>
particularly suitable device for implementing this<br>
method.<br>
Document GB-1 183 316 discloses methods for the<br>
inductive soldering of heating wires placed in parallel<br>
with their collector conductors. In the first<br>
embodiment, the heating wires are fixed by bonding onto<br>
a glazing surface and the collector conductor - a thin<br>
strip of tinned copper - is positioned over the top.<br>
The soldering tool is guided over the same surface of<br>
the glazing with a constant stand-off distance along<br>
the collector conductor using spacer rollers. In the<br>
second embodiment, the heating wires and the collector<br>
conductors are inaccessible from the outside in a<br>
laminated glazing unit made up of two sheets of glazing<br>
and an adhesive layer. Here, electrical contact between<br>
the heating conductors and their collector conductors<br>
is to be made only after the laminated glazing unit has<br>
been produced. To achieve this, use is made of the<br>
ability of a magnetic field to transmit, without<br>
contact, through one of the sheets of glazing, the<br>
energy required to melt the solder; this sheet of<br>
glazing in this instance acts as the "spacer" for the<br>
hand-guided soldering tool.<br>
It is known that such glazing is used especially in<br>
motor vehicle manufacture, but also in buildings. Other<br>
typical applications are, for example, the soldering of<br>
contact bases for connection lines. These are becoming<br>
increasingly small in order to save space in motor<br>
vehicle manufacturing and are often also provided with<br>
cable connections, which may prove awkward when<br>
soldering  tools  are  being  applied  directly  (see<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
EP 477 069 Bl). Likewise, electronic components such as<br>
amplifiers or the like are already soldered directly to<br>
antenna conducting fields printed onto an external<br>
surface of the glazing.<br>
For technical reasons associated with manufacture and<br>
in order to be able to connect a plurality of<br>
connections towards the outside using a common multiple<br>
cable, several soldered assemblies or solder spots are<br>
usually positioned very close together (see<br>
DE 195 36 131 C2) . Using conventional soldering tools,<br>
these assemblies or spots do, however, have to be<br>
soldered one after another individually.<br>
However, applying soldering irons directly to the<br>
connection components concerned from the open "front<br>
face" is often a disadvantage, especially when - and<br>
above all in industrial-scale production with short<br>
pass times - incorrect positioning can occur as a<br>
result of the inevitable action of forces.<br>
In the case of induction soldering, apparatus<br>
manufacturers do, however, typically recommend a high<br>
frequency of between 700 and 900 kHz depending on the<br>
thermal power to be applied. At the same time, the<br>
electrical power requirement is only relatively low (1<br>
to 4 kW).<br>
Tests carried out under the conditions of the possible<br>
applications discussed above with the recommended<br>
relatively high frequencies have not, however, made it<br>
possible to obtain satisfactory results. In particular,<br>
the conducting structures that act as<br>
soldered-connection faces on the surface of the<br>
glazing, which are made up of a thick baked-on layer of<br>
screen printing paste with a relatively high silver<br>
content, may heat up excessively and dissipate a great<br>
deal of heat while at the same time the components that<br>
are to be soldered have not yet become sufficiently<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
hot. One cause could be that the conducting structure,<br>
or its material, has high absorption with respect to<br>
the waves generated by induction. The heating effect<br>
obtained by using high frequencies then either does not<br>
penetrate deep within a voluminous body or does so<br>
extremely slowly, but rather remains at the surface<br>
thereof (something also called the "skin effect", see,<br>
in this respect, DE 694 30 275 T2, page 36) . In<br>
consequence, the short pass times do not allow the<br>
required depth of penetration to the other face of the<br>
thick layer concerned to be achieved with any<br>
certainty.<br>
Document DE 196 36 216 Al describes a device and a<br>
method for the induction heating of components,<br>
particularly for hardening and soldering, in which an<br>
induction loop or coil is combined with a conducting<br>
body to deflect or orientate the magnetic field. The<br>
loop/coil is made up of a tubular material that is a<br>
good conductor of electricity, which is cooled during<br>
the soldering operation by a circulating cooling fluid.<br>
The operating or frequency range recommended for<br>
heating metals by induction is from 10 kHz to 10 MHz.<br>
In that document, however, just one application to the<br>
hardening of the edges of bored holes is described in<br>
detail. The conducting body mentioned forms a core that<br>
can be introduced into the respective bore. The<br>
document gives no other information as to the<br>
production of installations or methods for soldering<br>
using inductive heating.<br>
The problem underlying the invention is to afford an<br>
improved method for the inductive soldering of<br>
connections to glazing units and a device particularly<br>
suited to implementing this method.<br>
This problem is solved according to the invention by<br>
the features of Claim 1 as far as the method is<br>
concerned and by the features of Claim 12 as far as the<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
device is concerned. The features of the secondary<br>
claims dependent on the respective independent claims<br>
set out advantageous embodiments of the invention.<br>
The magnitude and shape of the surface area of an<br>
induction loop or coil positioned in a soldering tool<br>
is consequently tailored to suit the magnitude and<br>
shape, respectively, of the respective multiple contact<br>
regions. This surface area may be very small, but as a<br>
general rule is several square centimetres in size. For<br>
example, it measures 0.5 to 70 cm2 and may be larger<br>
still.<br>
These tools may be applied to the surface of the<br>
glazing concerned on the opposite side to the soldering<br>
face. The magnetic field emitted by these tools passes<br>
through the material of the glazing with practically no<br>
attenuation, which means that the soldering heat<br>
required is released only from the back side of the<br>
glazing. Even any opaque (non-conducting) local coating<br>
at the edge of the surface of the glazing is penetrated<br>
by the magnetic field with practically no attenuation.<br>
At the same time, the smooth surface of the glazing<br>
forms an ideal bearing surface for the tool, and even<br>
the distance at which it lies from the actual solder<br>
spot is kept practically constant from one sheet of<br>
glazing to another by the glazing and layer thickness<br>
that is reproducible with negligible discrepancies.<br>
However, it is not strictly necessary to position the<br>
soldering tools on the face of the glazing situated<br>
facing the solder spots if the fixing of the necessary<br>
distance can be respected using other means. Likewise,<br>
it is possible to apply the soldering tools directly to<br>
the components that are to be soldered.<br>
This technique can be employed with simple glazing and<br>
with laminated glazing.<br>
In  mass  production,   the  tools  may  therefore<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
advantageously be mounted in a fixed position in<br>
soldering devices or soldering stations, in which the<br>
glazing prepared for the making of the soldered<br>
connections is introduced and positioned. Keeping the<br>
tools stationary has the additional advantage that the<br>
necessary supply ducting does not need to be moved.<br>
By moving away from the recommendations of the<br>
apparatus manufacturers, the frequency of the induced<br>
waves, and respectively of the magnetic field, were<br>
markedly reduced, for experimental purposes, to a range<br>
ranging between 5 and 150 kHz. The magnetic field<br>
penetration depth in the applications described is<br>
thereby markedly greater. However, it is necessary to<br>
use more electrical power because relatively<br>
low-frequency radiation suffers from relatively high<br>
transmission losses in the stand-off gap and within the<br>
body of the glazing. It is also necessary to work with<br>
a higher magnetic field strength at low frequency.<br>
In the light of the markedly improved soldering results<br>
which have a favourable knock-on effect on mass<br>
production, this aspect does, however, need to be taken<br>
into consideration. At the same time, a marked<br>
speeding-up of production is achieved because, even for<br>
very short pass times, all the nearby solder spots even<br>
in relatively extensive soldered-connection fields are<br>
soldered at the same time and with good process<br>
reliability. Using the relatively small high-frequency<br>
soldering tools, a relative movement between the tool<br>
and the respective glazing would also be needed. It has<br>
proved to be favourable, in the context of the present<br>
invention, for the loops or coils for induction<br>
soldering at relatively low frequencies to have<br>
markedly greater volumes than the loops or coils used<br>
for high-frequency induction.<br>
Appropriate large-sized loops or coils have been used<br>
to make various experimental soldered connections which<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
have all led to satisfactory results. Thus, for<br>
example, a five-pole antenna connection, four<br>
individual antenna connections in the form of press<br>
studs, and two heating conductor connections in<br>
addition to two antenna connections, have been soldered<br>
to typical glazing equipped differently, all of this<br>
having been done in the region of an opaque edge<br>
coating of the glazing with electrically conductive<br>
tracks printed thereon. As a result of the good<br>
penetration of the field lines into these conducting<br>
structures for low induction frequency the bodies or<br>
the (metal) contacts of the contact elements have been<br>
heated sufficiently and quickly enough by the magnetic<br>
field to melt their pre-tinning and assemble them<br>
reliably with the connection faces on the side of the<br>
glazing.<br>
The soldering tools also experience practically no<br>
wear. The holding tools for positioning the components<br>
for soldering may be produced more simply and in a more<br>
compact form without soldering tools.<br>
During the soldering operation, the components to be<br>
connected are pressed only freely against the surface<br>
of the glazing using simple clamping means, which are<br>
not themselves heated by the magnetic field. These<br>
tools may for example by made of plastic or ceramic or<br>
both, or may be lined with non-metallic parts in the<br>
regions where they come into contact with the<br>
components that are to be soldered. In order locally to<br>
optimize and deflect the magnetic field it is also<br>
possible to use clamping means made of ferrite<br>
materials.<br>
Soldering from the "rear face" of a sheet of glazing<br>
(which in a vehicle is usually the exterior face) and<br>
the resulting direct application of heat yield the<br>
additional major structural advantage, namely that more<br>
complicated structural elements can be soldered.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
In particular, with the exception of the actual solder<br>
spot, the components to be connected do not need to<br>
exhibit any free metal surface but may, for example, be<br>
entirely coated or overmoulded in plastic, and if<br>
appropriate may even contain components positioned in a<br>
second plane immediately above the contact points (see<br>
DE 198 56 663 C2) . Such components may be used with no<br>
special protection in their assembly environment. A<br>
visual inspection of the soldered joint can also of<br>
course be carried out at the solder spot itself, for<br>
example using "inspection holes" (see<br>
DE 102 49 992 Cl) .<br>
Naturally, the shape of the loop or of the coil, or of<br>
the tool which contains it, must be tailored to suit<br>
the respective particulars, in material terms, to suit<br>
the envisaged connection geometries (surface areas and<br>
shapes of the components in the region of the<br>
soldered-connection faces) so that the magnetic field<br>
lines can be orientated optimally on the components for<br>
heating. It is particularly advantageous to have<br>
ferrite elements in the tool in order to optimize the<br>
pattern of the field lines. In order to tailor it to<br>
suit curved glazing surfaces, corresponding preforming<br>
and/or an elastic intermediate layer on the contact<br>
face of the tool may prove advantageous.<br>
Other details and advantages of the solution according<br>
to the invention will become apparent from the attached<br>
drawings of examples of possible applications and from<br>
the detailed descriptions thereof.<br>
In these schematic depictions which are not drawn to<br>
scale:<br>
Fig. 1 depicts a view of a piece of glazing with<br>
connections for soldering, which is placed in a<br>
device for the inductive soldering of these<br>
connections for soldering; and<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
Fig. 2  shows an enlarged detail of Fig.  1 in the<br>
region of a multiple soldered-connection point.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a trapezoidal sheet of glazing 1 made of<br>
glass or plastic, of which the top surface, in the<br>
direction of viewing, is provided along its edge with<br>
an opaque coating 2 (here shaded grey but in actual<br>
fact generally black), which is electrically<br>
non-conducting. This is, for example, the rear window<br>
of a motor vehicle, depicted here without curvature for<br>
reasons of simplicity. On its surface it is also<br>
provided with electrically conducting tracks or<br>
structures 3, for example heating conductors and<br>
antenna conductors, which extend through the field of<br>
view of the window and/or the side of the edge as far<br>
as the coating 2. Along the left-hand edge of the sheet<br>
of glazing 1 there are collector conductors 4 and 5 on<br>
the surface of the coating 2. Furthermore, several<br>
connection faces 6, 7, 8 (shown in paler grey in the<br>
illustration) intended for the electrical connection of<br>
the conducting structures 3 or of the collector<br>
conductors, and to which we will return in greater<br>
detail later on, are also provided.<br>
Shown on the right-hand edge of the sheet of glazing is<br>
a reversed identical configuration of collector<br>
conductors and connection faces without the<br>
corresponding numerical references. The configurations<br>
of the collector conductors and of the connection faces<br>
may in actual fact differ from one side of the sheet of<br>
glazing to the other. The connection faces and the<br>
solder spots may also be positioned along the long<br>
sides of the shape of glazing shown here.<br>
The configuration of the heating and antenna conducting<br>
structures 3 in the central field of vision of the<br>
sheet of glazing 1 is not depicted further. For the<br>
purposes of the present description this is of no<br>
importance because the description relates only to the<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
making of the edge electrical connections of the<br>
conducting structures 3 by soldering with the heat<br>
produced by induction.<br>
The conducting structures 3 are usually produced, as<br>
are the collector conductors 4, 5 and the connection<br>
faces 6, 7, 8 by printing (screen printing) a<br>
conducting printing paste (containing silver) using the<br>
thick layer technique with subsequent baking (on glass<br>
glazing, preferably at the time of bending).<br>
The glazing 1 is placed in a device 10 indicated by a<br>
box, to which belong, amongst other things, the stops<br>
11, the supports 12 and the soldering tools 13. Whereas<br>
the stops 11 are pressed against the lateral edges of<br>
the glazing 1 in order to position it in the plane, the<br>
supports 12 and the soldering tools 13 lie, in the<br>
direction of view, behind/under the glazing 1. It can<br>
be seen that the soldering tools 13 fixed in the device<br>
entirely cover the regions of the connection faces, in<br>
vertical projection onto the surface of the glazing.<br>
Their surface area facing towards the glazing measures<br>
several square centimetres.<br>
The connection faces 6, 7 and 8 have to be connected to<br>
the outside of the glazing to electrical supply or<br>
connection lines corresponding to their function, or to<br>
antenna cables, respectively, these not having been<br>
depicted in Fig. 1.<br>
A ring labelled "II" on the left-hand edge of the sheet<br>
of glazing 1 surrounds the region depicted in enlarged<br>
detail in Fig. 2, in order to explain in detail the<br>
method according to the invention and the corresponding<br>
device. The region encircled is also denoted<br>
hereinafter as the connection field. This in total has<br>
a defined surface area to which the associated<br>
soldering tool is tailored.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
The connection field covered by an individual soldering<br>
tool could if need be be larger still. Likewise, an<br>
individual soldering tool may comprise two or more<br>
terms. This would be recommended if solder spots are to<br>
be produced on flat or only slightly curved or<br>
cylindrically curved glazing.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a side view of the edge region of the<br>
glazing 1 laid out flat, viewed from the left side of<br>
Fig. 1. For elements that are identical, the same<br>
numerical references as were used in Fig. 1 have been<br>
kept. Although admittedly a flat sheet of glazing 1 has<br>
been depicted, the invention can naturally be applied<br>
also to curved glazing.<br>
Visible on the opaque coating 2 are the two connection<br>
faces 7 and the four connection faces 8 of the<br>
connection field in the circle II of Fig. 1. On the<br>
twin connection faces 7, the two soldering shoes 14 of<br>
a bridge-shaped contact element 15 provided with a<br>
connecting cable have been applied. Such contact<br>
elements with a soldered flexible lead are known in the<br>
prior art (for example from EP 0 477 069 Bl) . They are<br>
often used for the electrical connection of heating<br>
fields to the on-board power supply of a vehicle.<br>
Specifically, such components are critical to<br>
subsequent soldering because the soldering of the lead<br>
must not be heated excessively. Such excessive heating<br>
can be avoided reliably using the method according to<br>
the invention.<br>
Applied to the four connection faces 8 is a multiple<br>
contact element 16 also known per se which comprises<br>
four metal contacts 17 each of which has to be soldered<br>
to one of the connection faces 8. Likewise, the<br>
multiple contact element 16 is connected by a<br>
connecting cable. The latter may, for example, be an<br>
antenna cable, if appropriate in a diversity antenna<br>
environment.<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
The multiple contact element 16 exhibits a sheath,<br>
preferably made of an appropriate plastic (which is<br>
electrically insulating) in which its contacts 17 with<br>
its line connections to the connection cable are<br>
embedded. Free metal surfaces on the face of the<br>
multiple contact element situated opposite the glazing<br>
1 are not required. Other electrical and/or electronic<br>
components (for example amplifiers) may also be located<br>
inside the sheath.<br>
Each of the six solder spots shown in Fig. 2 is<br>
provided with a thin layer of solder 9 containing lead<br>
or free of lead (pre-tinned or bearing a deposit of<br>
solder), if appropriate with a flux incorporated or<br>
applied subsequently. It might be enough to apply a<br>
deposit of solder to just one of the two faces that are<br>
to be soldered, thus either to the connection faces 7,<br>
8 or to the solder shoes 14 or contacts 17, if it can<br>
be guaranteed that the energy injected will be able to<br>
heat all the components enough to solder both sides<br>
firmly and if the non-tinned surface can be wetted with<br>
the solder.<br>
The thicknesses of the coating 2, of the connection<br>
faces 7 and 8 and of the deposit of solder are not<br>
shown to scale here.<br>
Chain line has been used to indicate clamping means 18,<br>
19 which each position and press the contact sole 14<br>
and the multiple contact element 16 on(to) the contact<br>
or solder spots. These do not need to have galvanic<br>
contact with the solder spots. These clamping means<br>
may, for example and advantageously, at the same time<br>
be remote-controlled holding and positioning tools in<br>
an automated production line. This dual function is<br>
indicated by the slight overlap of the clamping means<br>
with the contact elements illustrated. They pick up the<br>
contact elements, initially loose, from the respective<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
stores, position them on the corresponding connection<br>
faces and hold them in place during the soldering<br>
operation until the solder hardens.<br>
The soldering tool 13 is applied to the underside of<br>
the glazing 1, situated on the opposite side to the<br>
contact points 7 and 8, with (at least) one induction<br>
loop or coil 131 which is powered from a commercially<br>
available generator 13G with an AC voltage at<br>
adjustable frequency and power. Symbolically, also<br>
depicted is a switch 13S in the connection between the<br>
generator and the coil, by means of which switch the<br>
operation of the induction loop 131 can be controlled.<br>
Finally, if need be, the tool 13 can be cooled by<br>
connecting hoses 13C. In contrast with the schematic<br>
depiction, the cooling fluid inlet and the electrical<br>
power supply lines may be gathered together.<br>
The soldering tools 13, which are large by comparison<br>
with the conventional high-frequency induction loops or<br>
coils, comprise coils or loops the sizes of which<br>
correspond more or less to the length and width of the<br>
soldering tool. Intermediate spaces may be filled in a<br>
way known per se using ferrite bodies or bodies made of<br>
other equally suitable materials. In this way, the<br>
magnetic field that they emit can be optimized in such<br>
a way that it is deflected and that it acts as<br>
intensively and as concertedly as possible on the<br>
solder spots. It is therefore possible not so much to<br>
obtain great homogeneity as rather to heat as quickly<br>
and as intensively as possible determined or small-area<br>
spots - namely the solder spots and the metal contact<br>
elements applied to them.<br>
Similarly, it may also be advantageous for the clamping<br>
means also to be equipped with ferrite elements or<br>
components having the same functions in order to shape<br>
and guide the field lines. This option, just like the<br>
soldering  tool  itself,  needs  to  be  individually<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
tailored to the respective connection field and to its<br>
solder spots.<br>
In order constantly to achieve high soldering quality,<br>
it is important for the distance between the soldering<br>
tool 13 and the solder spots to be kept as constant as<br>
possible on each glazing sheet. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment illustrated here, the soldering tool is<br>
therefore applied directly to the surface of the<br>
glazing. Naturally, any damage to the smooth surface of<br>
the glazing must be prevented. Here it is possible<br>
according to the invention to provide a very small<br>
well-defined stand-off between the soldering tool and<br>
the underside of the glazing, in order to completely<br>
avoid any contact.<br>
Thus, if a tool with an induction coil is to be applied<br>
to a surface of a curved sheet of glazing rather than<br>
the flat glazing 1 shown here, it would need to be<br>
tailored to suit the local contours of the glazing, in<br>
the sense of precise reproducible positioning, or would<br>
need to hug this surface, possibly by means of an<br>
elastic intermediate layer.<br>
As a preference, these soldering tools are positioned<br>
fixedly/stationary in the device 10. The sheet of<br>
glazing to be treated is brought in each time using<br>
conveyor means not depicted and is positioned between<br>
the stops 11 on the supports 12.<br>
Of course, it is however also possible to apply<br>
soldering tools that can move by means of robots into<br>
reproducible positions on a sheet of glazing that is to<br>
be treated. For example, this solution will be<br>
preferred when it is not necessary to process large<br>
numbers of components on glazing units that always<br>
remain the same, or when a frequent change in model has<br>
to be processed using the same device.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
In order to produce soldered assemblies, the induction<br>
loop 131 is supplied with current at the desired<br>
frequency (between 5 and 100 kHz) by connecting its<br>
electrical power supply (closing the switch 13S). A<br>
typical power of the order of 1.3 to 15 kW is set,<br>
although this may naturally be altered according to the<br>
remoteness of the loop or of the coil, the (total)<br>
surface area of the solder spots and the masses to be<br>
heated. The magnetic field passes through the material<br>
of the glazing a few millimetres thick and the opaque<br>
edge coating 2 a few microns thick without excessive<br>
attenuation; the smaller the stand-off, the lower the<br>
attenuation. There is a release of heat in the metallic<br>
components of the contact points  7,  8  and solder<br>
deposits 9 and also in the metallic components (solder<br>
legs 14, contacts 17) of the applied contact elements<br>
15 and 16. The low frequency,  in addition to the<br>
advantage of allowing a relatively deep penetration,<br>
exhibits  the  additional  advantage  that  certain<br>
components that are sensitive to electromagnetic waves<br>
can  also  be  soldered  without  destroying  these<br>
components.<br>
The time for which the magnetic field needs to be in<br>
action until the solder completely melts and the best<br>
frequency range can be determined simply and repeatedly<br>
by tests, and simulated using appropriate software.<br>
After the soldering operation, the magnetic field is<br>
switched off (the switch 13S is opened) . The glazing 1<br>
is still held briefly, as are the clamping means 18,<br>
19, until the solder has hardened and the electrical<br>
connections hold firm without additional mechanical<br>
fixing. Thereafter, the glazing 1 is transferred on to<br>
the subsequent processing operations.<br><br>

Thus, for a high work rate, markedly better heating of<br>
the components that need to be soldered is obtained<br>

depth of penetration into the bodies. A device<br>
particularly suited to implementing the method is also<br>
described.</td>
