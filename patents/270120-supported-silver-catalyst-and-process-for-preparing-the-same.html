				<td>BACKGROUND OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
The present   invention  relates   to  a   catalyst   and  to   the use   of   the  catalyst   in  olefin   epoxidation.<br>
In olefin  epoxidations,   catalyst  performance may be assessed on the  basis  of selectivity,   activity  and stability of  operation.     The  selectivity  is  the percentage  of the converted olefin   yielding  the   desired  olefin   oxide.     As   the catalyst ages,   the  percentage  of  the  olefin  converted normally decreases  with time  and  to maintain  a   constant level,of olefin   oxide  production   the  temperature   of  the reaction  is   increased.     However   this  adversely  affects   the selectivity  of   the   conversion   to   the  desired  olefin oxide. In   addition,   the   equipment  used   can   tolerate   temperatures only  up  to  a  certain   level   so   that   it   is   necessary to terminate  the   reaction  when   the   reaction   temperature  would reach   a  level   inappropriate   for   the   reactor.      Thus  the longer  the  selectivity  can  be   maintained  at   a   high  level   and the  epoxidation   can  be  performed  at   an  acceptably  low temperature,   the   longer  the   catalyst   charge   can  be  kept   in the   reactor  and   the  more  product   is   obtained.      Quite modest improvements   in   the  maintenance   of   selectivity  over  long periods  yields   huge   dividends   in   terms  of   process efficiency.<br>
Olefin  epoxidation  catalysts   comprise   a   silver component,   usually  with  one   or  more   further   elements  co-deposited  therewith   on  a  carrier.     Carriers   are   typically formed   of  a   temperature   resistant   oxide   such   as   α-alumina and   in   general   higher   purity   has   been   found   to   correlate with   better   performance.      however   it   has   also   been   found   for example   that   the   presence  of   minor   amounts   of   impurities   in<br>
the carrier such as alkali metals and some forms of silica can have a beneficial effect.<br>
Intuitively it might also be considered that the higher the surface area of the carrier, the greater the area available for deposition of the silver and therefore the more effective the silver deposited thereon.  However, this is generally found not to be the case and in modern catalysts the tendency is to use a carrier with a surface<br>
area of less than 1 m2/g. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention teaches that the picture with respect to carrier surface area is significantly more complicated than was at first appreciated since the nature of the porosity of the carrier, in particular the pore size distribution and the pore volume provided by the pores which have a pore size within a defined range, has now been found to play a significant role.  On this basis it was possible to prepare olefin epoxidation catalysts with excellent activity, selectivity and unusually prolonged retention of the activity and stability level.  The carriers having an advantageous pore size distribution may be made from particulate materials which have specific particle sizes.<br>
The present invention provides a catalyst which comprises a 'carrier and silver deposited on the carrier in a quantity of at least 10 g/kg, relative to the weight of the catalyst, which carrier has a surface area of at least 1.4 m2/g, and a pore size distribution such that pores with diameters in the range of from 0.2 to 10 µm represent more than 80 % of the total pore volume and such pores together provide a pore volume of at least 0.27 ml/g, relative to the weight of the carrier, wherein the carrier is based on<br>
refractory materials, silicon carbide, clays, zeolites, charcoal and alkaline earth metal carbonates.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a catalyst which process comprises depositing at least silver on the carrier in a quantity of at least 10 g/kg, relative to the weight of the catalyst, and, if necessary, one or more further elements selected from the group of nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, fluorine, Group IA metals, Group IIA metals, rhenium, molybdenum, tungsten, chromium, titanium, hafnium, zirconium, vanadium, thallium, thorium, tantalum, niobium, gallium and germanium and mixtures thereof.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a catalyst which process comprises depositing silver on a carrier, wherein the carrier has been obtained by a method which comprises forming a mixture comprising:<br>
a)	from 50 to 90 %w of a first particulate α-alumina<br>
having an average particle size (d50) of from more than 10<br>
up to 100 µm; and<br>
b)	from 10 to 50 %w of a second particulate a-alumina<br>
having a d50 of from 1 to 10 µm;<br>
%w being based on the total weight of a-alumina in the mixture; and firing the mixture to form the carrier.  In an embodiment,"amongst others, the mixture may be shaped into formed bodies and the formed bodies are fired to form the carrier.  When the formed bodies are formed by extrusion, it may be desirable to include conventional burnout materials and/or extrusion aids, and an aqueous liquid, e.g. water, in the mixture.<br>
Further, the invention provides a process for the epoxidation of an olefin, which process comprises reacting an olefin with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst which<br>
comprises a carrier and silver deposited on the carrier, which carrier has a surface area of at least 1 m2/g, and a pore size distribution such that pores with diameters in the range of from 0.2 to 10 µm represent more than 80 % of the total pore volume and such pores together provide a pore volume of at least 0.27 ml/g, relative to the weight of the carrier.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the epoxidation of an olefin, which process comprises reacting an olefin with oxygen in the 'presence of a catalyst which has been obtained by a process which comprises depositing silver on a carrier  wherein the carrier has been obtained by a method which comprises forming a mixture comprising:<br>
a)	from 50 to 90 %w of a first particulate α-alumina having a d50 of from more than 10 up to 100 µm; and<br>
b)	from 10 to 50 %w of a second particulate a-alumina having a d50 of from 1 to 10 µm;<br>
%w being based on the total weight of α-alumina in the mixture; and firing the mixture to form the carrier.  In an embodiment, amongst others, the mixture may be shaped into formed bodies and the formed bodies are fired to form the carrier.  When the formed bodies are formed by extrusion, it may be desirable to include conventional burnout materials and/or extrusion aids, and an aqueous liquid, e.g. water, in<br>
the mixture.<br>
The invention also provides a method of using an olefin oxide for making a 1,2-diol, a 1,2-diol ether or an alkanolamine comprising converting the olefin oxide into the 1,2-diol  the 1 2-diol ether or the alkanolamine wherein the olefin oxide has been obtained by a process for the epoxidation of an olefin in accordance with this invention.<br>
In accordance with the teaching of this invention, by maximizing the number of pores having a diameter in the range of 0.2 to 10 µm, in particular by minimizing the number of pores having a diameter greater than 10 µm, the catalyst is advantaged over catalysts where are prepared from carriers which have a substantial number of pores having a diameter greater than 10 µm.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
"Surface area" as used herein is understood to refer to the surface area as determined by the BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) method as described in Journal of the American Chemical Society 60 (1938) pp. 309-316.<br>
As used herein, water absorption is deemed to have been measured in accordance with ASTM C393, and water absorption is expressed as the weight of the water that can be absorbed into the pores of the carrier, relative to the weight of the carrier.<br>
The pore size distribution may be measured by a conventional mercury intrusion device in which liquid mercury is forced into the pores of a carrier.  Greater pressure is needed to force the mercury into the smaller pores and the measurement of pressure increments corresponds to volume increments in the pores penetrated and hence to the size of the pores in the incremental volume.  As used herein, the pore size distribution and the pore volumes are as measured by mercury intrusion to a pressure of 3.0 x 108 Pa using a Micromeretics Autopore 9200 model (130° contact angle, mercury with a surface tension of 0.473 N/m, and correction for mercury compression applied).<br>
The average particle size, referred to herein as "d50", is as measured by a Horiba LA900 particle size analyzer and represents a particle diameter at which there are equal spherical equivalent volumes of particles larger and particles smaller than the stated average particle size. The method includes dispersing the particles by ultrasonic treatment, thus breaking up secondary particles into primary particles.  This sonification treatment is continued until no further change in the d50 value is noticed, which<br>
typically requires 5 minute sonification when using the Horiba LA900 particle size analyzer.<br>
As used herein, pore volume (ml/g), surface area (m2/g) and water absorption (g/g) are defined relative to the weight of the carrier, unless stated otherwise.<br>
Typically, the pore size distribution is such that pores with diameters less than 0.2 µm represent less than 10 % of the total pore volume.  Typically, the pore size distribution is such that pores with diameters greater than 10 µm represent less than 20 %, in particular less than 15 %, of the total pore volume.  The pore size distribution is such that the pores with diameters in the range of from 0.2 to 10 µm represent more than 80 %, more preferably more than 85 %, most preferably more than 90 % of the total pore volume; the pores with diameters greater than 10 µm represent less than 12 %, in particular less than 10 %, more in particular less than 5 % of the total pore volume; and the pores with diameters less than 0.2 µm represent less than 7 %, in particular at most 5 %, and more in particular at most 4 % of the total pore volume.<br>
Frequently, the pore size distribution is such that the pores with diameters in the range of from 0.2 to 10 µm represent less than 99.9 %, more frequently less than 99 % of the total pore volume; the pores with diameters greater than 10 µm represent more than 0.1 %, more frequently more than 0.5 % of the total pore volume; and the pores with diameters less than 0.2 µm represent more than 0.1 %, more frequently more than 0.5 % of the total pore volume.<br>
Typically, the pores with diameters in the range of from 0.2 to 10 µm provide a pore volume of at least 0.28 ml/g, in particular at least 0.3 ml/g, more in particular at least 0.35 ml/g.  Typically, the pores with<br>
diameters in the range of from 0.2 to 10 µm provide a pore volume of at most 0.8 ml/g, more typically at most 0.7 ml/g, in particular at most 0.6 ml/g, more in particular at most 0.56 ml/g.   In a preferred embodiment, the pores with diameters in the range of from 0.2 to 10 µm provide a pore volume in the range of from 0.35 to 0.4 5 ml/g.<br>
The total pore volume of the carrier may vary between wide ranges.  Typically the total pore volume is at least 0.28 ml/g, in particular at least 0.30 ml/g, more in particular at least 0.35 ml/g.  Typically, the total pore , volume is at most 0.8 ml/g, and more typically it is at most 0.7 ml/g, in particular at most 0.6 ml/g, more in particular at most 0.56 ml/g.  In a preferred embodiment, the total pore volume of the carrier is in the range of from 0.35 to 0.45 ml/g.<br>
The surface area of the carrier is at least 1 m2/g. Typically, the surface area is at most 2.9 m2/g. Preferably, the surface area is in the range of from 1 to 2.6 m2/g, more preferably from 1.4 to 2.6 m2/g, most preferably from 1.6 to 2.2 m2/g, for example from 1.6 to 2.0 m2/g or from 1.8 to 2.2 m2/g.<br>
The water absorption of the carrier is typically at least 0.3 g/g, more typically at least 0.35 g/g. Frequently, the water absorption is at most 0.8 g/g, more frequently at most 0.7 g/g, or at most 0.55 g/g. Preferably, the water absorption of the carrier is in the range of from 0.35 to 0.7 g/g, for example 0.39 g/g, or 0.41 g/g, or any value in the range of from 0.35 to 0.55 g/g, in particular 0.38 to 0.5 q/g or 0.40 to 0.55 g/g or 0.48 to 0.55 g/g.  A higher water absorption and a higher total pore volume are in favour in view of a more efficient deposition of silver and further elements, if any, on the carrier by impregnation.  However, at a higher water<br>
absorption and higher total pore volume, the carrier, or the catalyst made therefrom, may have lower crush strength.<br>
The carrier is based on refractory materials, silicon carbide, clays, zeolites, charcoal and alkaline earth metal carbonates, for example calcium carbonate.  Preferred are refractory materials, such as alumina, magnesia, zirconia and silica.  The most preferred material is α-alumina. Typically, the carrier comprises at least 85 %w, more typically 90 %w, in particular 95 %w a-alumina, frequently up to 99.9 %w a-alumina.<br>
Carriers may generally be made by firing particulate mineral components at an elevated temperature until the particles sinter together.  In general, firing is continued until the particles are bonded together, either by the formation of bond posts from any added bond material or through sintering, but preferably not beyond the point at which the water absorption of the carrier is reduced.<br>
The water absorption of the carrier may suitably be controlled by the use of so-called burnout materials, and it is preferred to employ a burnout material when practicing this invention.  Burnout materials are well known in the art (cf., for example, F F Y Wang (Ed.), "Treatise on Materials Science and Technology", Volume 9, (New York, 1976), pp. 79-81; or J S Reed, "Introduction to the Principles of Ceramic Processing", (New York, 1988), pp. 152 ff.).  The burnout materials may also be used to ensure the preservation of the structure during a green, i.e. unfired, phase of the carrier preparation, for example the phase in which formed bodies are shaped, for example by extrusion.  The burnout materials are removed during the firing.  The use of burnout materials also allows more complete sintering without too great a<br>
reduction in water absorption of the carrier.  The burnout materials,are typically finely divided solid organic materials that volatilize or burn, leaving as little residue as possible.  The selection of the burnout material is considered not to be of any criticality to the invention. Burnout, materials may be selected from the group of carbohydrates, gums, flours, proteins, lignins, resins, waxes, alcohols, and esters.<br>
It is also a common expedient to use a bond material, i.e. a material which reduces the length of sintering time applied to bond the particles together, and it is preferred to employ such bond material when practicing this invention. It is advantageous that the bond material also forms a coating on at least a part of the carrier surface, which makes the carrier surface more receptive.  Suitable bond materials have been specified hereinafter.<br>
It has been found that, suitably, alumina carriers for use in this invention may be made by a method which comprises forming a mixture comprising:<br>
a)	from 50 to 90 %w of a first particulate α-alumina having a d50 of from more than 10 up to 100 µm, in particular from 11 to 60 µm, more in particular from 12 to 4 0 µm;<br>
b)	from 10 to 50 %w of a second particulate α-alumina having a d50 of from 1 to 10 µm, in particular from 2 to 6 µm; and preferably in addition<br>
c)	a bond material;<br>
%w being based on the total weight of α-alumina in the mixture; and then shaping the mixture into formed bodies and firing the formed bodies, typically at a temperature of from 1250 to 1500 °C, to form the carrier.<br>
The present method for making alumina carriers is well adapted to produce the carriers for use in this invention,<br>
in view of the careful matching of large and small particles of the α-alumina components.  The alumina particles are readily commercially available, or they may readily be made, for example, by subjecting more course materials to grinding and sieving operations.  In an embodiment, the smaller particles may be prepared from the larger particles by grinding, and the ground and un-ground particles are then combined.  In another embodiment, the desired mixture of large and small particles may be formed by grinding relatively large particles to the extent that the mixture of particles has the desired bimodal particle size distribution.<br>
Typically, the first particulate α-alumina is employed in a quantity of from 65 to 75 %w, relative to the total weight of a-alumina in the mixture.  Typically, the second particulate a-alumina is employed in a quantity of from 25 to 35 %w, relative to the total weight of a-alumina in the mixture.<br>
In particular when the carrier is an a-alumina carrier, more in particular comprising at least 80 %w, 90 %w, or 95 %w a-alumina, it is preferred that the bond material is based on a silica-containing composition comprising a crystallization inhibitor, inhibiting the formation of crystalline silica-containing compositions.  It is also preferred that the bond material provides a coating of a non-crystalline silica compound to the carrier surface.<br>
Typically, silica-containing compositions for use as a bond material comprise an  amorphous silica compound which may be, for example, a silica sol, a precipitated silica, an amorphous silica, or an amorphous alkali metal silicate or aluminasilicate.  Typically, silica-containing compositions for use as a bond material may also comprise hydrated alumina.  The crystallization inhibitor that is most<br>
conveniently   incorporated   is   an  alkali  metal   compound,    in particular  a   water  soluble   sa.lt,   such  as   a   sodium or potassium salt.<br>
A convenient  bond material may comprise  a mixture   of boehmite,   ammonium silicate   or silica  sol,   and a water soluble sodium salt.     Similar  effects can  be  achieved  by incorporation  of  conventional  ceramic bonds   formulated  to contain aluminosilicates  and  an alkali metal  component.<br>
When  the  carrier is  an  α-alumina  carrier,   more  in particular  comprising at  least  80  %w,   90   %w,   or  95  %w  α-alumina,   it   is  preferred  that  the bond material  is  based on<br>
a)	from 1 to 10 %w, in particular 2 to 5 %w, of an alumina hydrate, calculated as aluminum oxide relative to the weight of   the a-alumina;<br>
b)	from  0.1   to   1   %w,   in  particular  0.2   to   0.8   %w,   of   an amorphous   silica   compound,   as   specified   hereinbefore, calculated  as   silicon  oxide   relative  to   the   weight   of   the   α-alumina;   and<br>
c)	from  0.01   to   0.5  %w,   in   particular   0.05   to  0.3   %w,   of an  alkali  metal   compound,   calculated as   the   alkali  metal oxide  relative   to  the  weight   of  the a-alumina.<br>
In  a  preferred embodiment,   the  alumina   carrier   has   an alumina  content   of  at   least   95  %w  and may  be  made  by   a method which  comprises   forming  a mixture   comprising:<br>
a)	from  65   to   75  %w,   relative  to  the   total   weight   of   α-alumina   in   the  mixture,   of   a   first  particulate  a-alumina having a   d50   of   from  10  to   60   µm,   in particular   from   12   to 40   µm;<br>
b)	from 25 to 35 %w, relative to the total weight of α-alumina in the mixture, of a second particulate α-alumina having   a   d50   of   from  2   to   6   µm;<br>
c)	from   2   to   5   %w  of   an   alumina   hydrate,    calculated   as aluminum  oxide   relative   to   the   total   weight   of   α-alumina   in<br>
the mixture;<br>
d)	from 0.2 to 0.8 %w of an amorphous, silica compound, as specified hereinbefore, calculated as silicon oxide relative to the total weight of α-alumina in the mixture; and<br>
e)	from 0.05 to 0.3 %w, of an alkali metal compound, calculated as the alkali metal oxide relative to the total weight of α-alumina in the mixture;<br>
and then shaping the mixture into formed bodies and firing<br>
the formed bodies at a temperature of from 1250 to 1500 °C to form the carrier.<br>
The preferred alumina hydrate is boehmite, though gibbsite, bayerite or diaspore may also be used.<br>
Suitable alkali metals are, for example, lithium, sodium and potassium, or combination thereof.  Suitable alkali metal compounds are, for example, alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal acetates, alkali metal formates, alkali metal nitrates, and combinations thereof.  Typically, the overall atomic ratio of silicon to the alkali metal is in the range of from 1 to 10, more typically 2 to 8, for example 6.  The overall atomic ratio of silicon to the alkali metal is deemed to relate to the total alkali metal content and the total silicon content of the carrier, which includes any alkali metal and any silicon which may be present in the carrier other than in the bond material.<br>
It is also preferred that the carrier particles be prepared in the form of formed bodies, the size of which is in general determined by the dimensions of a reactor in which they are to be deposited.  Generally however it is found very convenient to use particles such as formed bodies in the form of powdery particles, trapezoidal bodies, cylinders, saddles, spheres, ooughnuts, and the like.  The cylinders may be solid or hollow, straight or bend, and they<br>
may have   their   length  and  cross-sectional  dimensions  about<br>
the  same   and  from   5   to  10 mm.	<br>
The   formed bodies  can  be   formed  from  the  mixture by  any convenient molding   process,   such   as   spraying,    spray drying, agglomeration or pressing,   but   preferably  they are  formed by extrusion of the mixture.     For  applicable methods,   reference may be made to,   for  example,   US-A-5145824,   US-A-5512530,   US-A-5384302,   US-A-5100859 and US-A-5733842,   which  are herein incorporated by reference.     To   facilitate  such molding processes,   in  particular extrusion,   the mixture  may suitably be  compounded with  up to about   30   %w  and preferably from 2 to  25   %w,   based  on   the weight  of   the mixture,   of  extrusion aids.      Extrusion   aids   (also  referred  to by  the   term "processing aids")    are   known  in   the   art   (cf.,    for   example, "Kirk-Othmer  Encyclopedia  of  Chemical  Technology",   4th edition,   Volume   5,   pp.   610   ff.).      Suitable  extrusion  aids may  be   for example   petroleum jelly,   hydrogenated   oil, synthetic  alcohol,    synthetic ester,   glycol,   polyolefin  oxide or  polyethylene  glycol.     Burnout   materials   are   typically applied   in a  quantity of  up  to   30   %w,   in  particular  from  2 to  25   %w,   relatively   to  the weight   of  the mixture.     Boric acid  may  also  be   added  to  the  mixture,   for   example  in  a quantity  of  up  to   0.5  %w,   more   typically  in   a   quantity  of from  0.01  to  0.5   %w.     The  effect   of   the  presence   of  boric acid  may  be  a   reduced content   of   leachable   alkali  metal   ions in   the   carrier   after   firing.      Enough   water  may  be   added  to the  mixture  to  make   the mixture   extrudable    (by   the  term  "the weight   of  the  mixture",   as  used   hereinbefore,    is   meant   the weight   of  the   total   mixture,   but   excluding  the   weight   of   any added   water) .<br>
The formed bodies are dried and fired at a temperature high enough to ensure that the alumina particles are joined together   by  a   sintering   action   and/or  by   the   formation   of<br>
bond posts formed from the bond material, if incorporated in the mixture.  Generally, drying may take place between 20 and 400 °C and preferably between 30 and 300 °C, typically for a period of up to 100 hours and preferably for from 5 minutes to 50 hours.  Typically, drying is performed to the extent that the mixture contains less than 2 %w of water. Generally, firing may take place between 1250 and 1500 °C, typically between 1250 and 1470 °C, preferably between 1300 and 1450 °C, more preferably between 1300 and 1440 °C, typically for a period of up to about 5 hours and preferably for from 2-to 4 hours.  Drying and firing may be carried out in any atmosphere, such as in air, nitrogen, or helium, or mixtures thereof.  Preferably, in particular when the formed bodies contain organic material, the firing is at least in part or entirely carried out in an oxidizing atmosphere, such as in oxygen containing atmosphere.<br>
It has been found that the performance of the catalyst may be enhanced if the carrier is washed, to remove soluble residues, before deposition of other catalyst ingredients on the carrier.  On the other hand, unwashed carriers may also be used successfully.  A useful method for washing the carrier comprises washing the carrier in a continuous fashion with hot, demineralised water, until the electrical conductivity of the effluent water does not further decrease.  A suitable temperature of the demineralised water is in the range of 80 to 100 °C, for example 90 °C or 95 °C. Reference may be made to WO-00/15333 and US-B-6368998, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Generally, the catalyst of this invention comprises silver as a catalytically active metal.  Appreciable catalytic activity is obtained by employing a silver content of the catalyst of at least 10 g/kg, in particular at least 50 g/kg, relative to the weight of the catalyst.  The<br>
preparation of the catalysts is known in the art and the known methods are applicable to the preparation of the catalyst of this invention.  Methods of preparing the catalyst include impregnating the carrier with a silver compound and performing a reduction to form metallic silver, particles.  Reference may be made, for example, to US-A-5380697, US-A-5739075, US-B-6368998, US-2002/0010094 Al, EP-A-266015, WO-00/15333, WO-00/15334 and WO-00/15335, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The impregnation may include impregnation with a solution of which the pH has a value above 12, for example 13 or 13.2 or above.  This may be accomplished by the addition of a base to the impregnation solution, for example lithium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide or a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, such as tetramethylarnmonium hydroxide or tetraethylammonium hydroxide, in sufficient quantity. Dependent of the composition of the impregnation solution, a quantity of base in the range of from 20 to 70 mmole/kg catalyst, for example 30, 40, 50 or 60 mmole/kg catalys't may be sufficient to achieve a sufficiently high pH.<br>
The reduction of cationic silver to metallic silver may be accomplished during a step in which the catalyst is dried, so that the reduction as such does require a separate process step.  This may be the case if the impregnation solution comprises a reducing agent, for example, an oxalate, as described in the Examples hereinafter.<br>
The catalyst preferably comprises silver, and a further element or compound thereof.  Eligible further elements may be selected from the group of nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, fluorine, Group IA metals, Group IIA metals, rhenium, molybdenum, tungsten, chromium, titanium, hafnium, zirconium, vanadium, thallium, thorium, tantalum, niobium, gallium and germanium and mixtures thereof.  Preferably the<br>
Group IA metals are selected from lithium, potassium, rubidium and cesium.   Most preferably the Group IA metal is lithium, potassium and/or cesium.  Preferably the Group IIA metals are selected from calcium and barium.  Where possible, the further element may suitably be provided as an oxyanion, for example, as a sulfate, borate, perrhenate, molybdate or nitrate, in salt or acid form.<br>
It is preferred to employ the carrier of this invention in the preparation of a highly selective catalyst.  The highly selective silver-based catalysts may comprise, in addition to silver, one or more of rhenium, molybdenum, tungsten, a Group IA metal, and a nitrate- or nitrite-forming compound, which may each be present in a quantity of from 0.01 to 500 mmole/kg, calculated as the element (rhenium, molybdenum, tungsten, the Group IA metal or nitrogen) on the total catalyst.  The nitrate- or nitrite-forming compounds and particular selections of nitrate- or nitrite-forming compounds are as defined hereinafter.  The nitrate- or nitrite-forming compound is in particular a Group IA metal nitrate or a Group IA metal nitrite. Rhenium, molybdenum, tungsten or the nitrate- or nitrite-forming compound may suitably be provided as an oxyanion, for example as a perrhenate, molybdate, tungstate or nitrate, in salt or acid form.<br>
Of special preference are the highly selective catalysts which comprise rhenium in addition to silver. Such catalysts are known from EP-A-266015, US-A-4761394 and US-A-4766105, which are incorporated herein by reference. Broadly, they comprise silver, rhenium or compound thereof, the further element (as defined hereinbefore, in particular tungsten, molybdenum and/or a Group IA metal, in particular lithium and/or cesium) other than rhenium or compound thereof, and optionally a rhenium co-promoter.  The rhenium<br>
co-promoter may be selected from one or more of sulfur, phosphorus, boron, and compounds thereof.<br>
Preferred amounts of the' components of the catalysts are, when calculated as the element, relative to the weight of the catalyst:<br>
-	silver from 10 to 500 g/kg,<br>
rhenium from 0.01 to 50 mmole/kg, if present,<br>
-	the further element or elements, if present, each from 0.1 to 500 mmole/kg, and,<br>
-	the rhenium co-promoter from 0.1 to 30 mmole/kg, if present.<br>
With respect to silver, this metal is present preferably in an amount of 50 to 500 g/kg, more preferably 50 to 400 g/kg, in particular 50 to 250 g/kg, for example 105 g/kg, or 120 g/kg, or 145 g/kg, or 191 g/kg, or 200 g/kg.  Rhenium may preferably be present in an amount of from 0.1 to 10 mmoles/kg, for example 2 mmoles/kg, or<br>
3	mmoles/kg, or 5 mmoles/kg.  The further element or<br>
elements may each be present in a preferredamount of from<br>
0.5 to 100 mmole/kg.  For example, tungsten may typically be<br>
present in an amount in the range of from 0.5 to<br>
20 mmole/kg, such as 1 mmole/kg, or 1.5 mmoles/kg, or 5 mmole/kg, or 15 mmole/kg; molybdenum may typically be present in an amount in the range of from 1 to 40 mmole/kg, such as 2.3 mmole/kg, or 12 mmole/kg, or 25 mmole/kg; and the alkali metal may each typically be present in amount of from 5 to 100 mmole/kg.  Suitable amounts for lithium are for example 5 mmole/kg, or 10 mmole/kg, or 22.2 mmole/kg, or 30 mmole/kg, or 40 mmole/kg, or 50 mmole/kg.  Suitable amounts for cesium are for example 5 mmole/kg, or 5.3 mmole/kg, or 5.4 mmole/kg, or 7.2 mmole/kg, or 10.3 mmole/kg, or 10.5 mmole/kg, or 33 mmole/kg, or<br>
4	7 mmole/kg.<br>
Although the present epoxidation process may be carried out'in many ways, it is preferred to carry it out as a gas phase process, i.e. a process in which the feed is contacted in the gas phase with the catalyst which is present as a solid material, typically in a packed bed.  Generally the process is carried out as a continuous process.<br>
The olefin for use in the present epoxidation process may be any olefin, such as an aromatic olefin, for example styrene, or a di-olefin, whether conjugated or not, for example 1,9-decadiene or 1,.3-butadiene.  Typically, the olefin is a monoolefin, for example 2-butene or isobutene. Preferably, the olefin is a mono-α-olefin, for example 1-butene or propylene.  The most preferred olefin is ethylene.<br>
The olefin concentration in the feed may be selected within a wide range.  Typically, the olefin concentration in the feed will be at most 80 mole%, relative to the total feed.  Preferably, it will be in the range of from 0.5 to 70 mole%, in particular from 1 to 60 mole%, on the same basis.  As used herein, the feed is considered to be- the composition which is contacted with the catalyst.<br>
•The present epoxidation process may be air-based or oxygen-based, see "Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology", 3rd edition, Volume 9, 1980, pp. 445-447.  In the air-based process air or air enriched with oxygen is employed as the source of the oxidizing agent while in the oxygen-based processes high-purity (at least 95 rnole%) oxygen is employed as the source of the oxidizing agent. Presently most epoxidation plants are oxygen-based and this is a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The oxygen concentration in the feed may be selected within a wide range.  However, in practice, oxygen is generally applied at a concentration which avoid.s the flammable regime.  Typically, the concentration of oxygen<br>
applied will be within the range of from 1 to 15 mole%, more typically from 2 to 12 mole% of the total feed.<br>
In order to remain outside the flammable regime, the concentration of oxygen in the feed may be lowered as the concentration of the olefin is increased.  The actual safe operating ranges depend, along with the feed composition, also on the reaction conditions such as the reaction temperature and the pressure.<br>
A reaction modifier may be present in the feed for increasing the selectively, suppressing the undesirable oxidation of olefin or olefin oxide to carbon dioxide and water, relative to the desired formation of olefin oxide. Many organic compounds, especially organic halides and organic nitrogen compounds, may be employed as the reaction modifier.  Nitrogen oxides, hydrazine, hydroxylamine or ammonia may be employed as well.  It is frequently considered that under the operating conditions of olefin epoxidation the nitrogen containing reaction modifiers are precursors of nitrates or nitrites, i.e. they are so-called nitrate- or nitrite-forming compounds (cf. e.g. EP-A-0003642 and US-A-4822900, which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Organic halides are the preferred reaction modifiers, in particular organic bromides, and more in particular organic chlorides.  Preferred organic halides are chlorohydrocarbons or bromohydrocarbons.  More preferably they are selected from the group of methyl chloride, ethyl chloride, ethylene dichloride, ethylene dibromide, vinyl chloride or a mixture thereof.  Most preferred reaction modifiers are ethyl chloride and ethylene dichloride.<br>
Suitable nitrogen oxides are of the general formula NOX<br>
wherein x is in the range of from 1 to 2, and include for example NO, N2O3 and N2O4.   Suitable organic nitrogen<br>
compounds are nitro compounds, nitroso compounds, amines, nitrates and nitrites, for example nitromethane, 1-nitropropane or 2-nitroproparie.  In preferred embodiments, nitrate- or nitrite-forming compounds, e.g. nitrogen oxides and/or organic nitrogen compounds, are used together with an organic halide, in particular an organic chloride.<br>
The reaction modifiers are generally effective when used in low concentration in the feed, for example up to 0.1 mole%, relative to the total feed, for example from 0.01x10-4 to 0.01 mole%.  In particular when the olefin is ethylene, it is preferred that the reaction modifier is present in the feed at a concentration of from 0.1x10-4 to 50x10-4 mole%, in particular from 0.3x10-4 to 30x10-4 mole%, relative to the total feed.<br>
In addition to the olefin, oxygen and the reaction modifier, the feed may contain one or more optional components, such as carbon dioxide, inert gases and saturated hydrocarbons.  Carbon dioxide is a by-product in the epoxidation process.  However, carbon dioxide generally has an adverse effect on the catalyst activity.  Typically, a concentration of carbon dioxide in the feed in excess of 25 mole%, preferably in excess of 10 mole%, relative to the total feed, is avoided.  A concentration of carbon dioxide as low as 1 mole% or lower, relative to the total feed, may be employed.  Inert gases, for example nitrogen or argon, may be present in the feed in a concentration of from 30 to 90 mole%, typically from 40 to 80 mole%.  Suitable saturated hydrocarbons are methane and ethane.  If saturated hydrocarbons are present, they may be present in a quantity of up to 80 mole%, relative to the to;al feed, in particular up to 75   molel.  Frequently they are present in a quantity cf at least 30 mole%, more frequently at least 40 mole's.<br>
Saturated hydroca'rbons may be added to the feed in order to increase the oxygen flammability limit.<br>
The epoxidation process may be carried out using reaction temperatures selected from a wide range. Preferably the reaction temperature is in the range of from 150 to 325 °C, more preferably in the range of from 180 to 300 °C.<br>
The epoxidation process is preferably carried out at a reactor inlet pressure in the range of from 1000 to 3500 kPa.  "GHSV" or Gas Hourly Space Velocity is the unit volume of gas at normal temperature and pressure (0 °C, 1 atm, i.e. 101.3 kPa) passing over one unit volume of packed catalyst per hour.  Preferably, when the epoxidation process is as a gas phase process involving a packed catalyst bed, the GHSV is in the range of from 1500 to 10000 Nl/(l.h).  Preferably, the process is carried out at a work rate in the range of from 0.5 to 10 kmole olefin oxide produced per m3 of catalyst per hour, in particular 0.7 to 8 kmole olefin oxide produced per m3 of catalyst per hour, for example 5 kmole olefin oxide produced per m3 of catalyst per hour.  As used herein, the work-rate is the amount of the olefin oxide produced per unit volume of catalyst per hour and the selectivity is the molar quantity of the olefin oxide formed relative to the molar quantity of the olefin converted.<br>
The olefin oxide produced may be recovered from the reaction mixture by using methods known in the art, for example by absorbing the olefin oxide from a reactor outlet stream in water and optionally recovering the olefin oxide from the aqueous solution by distillation.  At least a portion of the aqueous solution containing the olefin oxide may be applied in a subsequent process for converting. the olefin oxide into a 1,2-diol or a 1,2-diol ether.<br>
The olefin oxide produced in the epoxidation process may be converted into a 1,2-diol, a 1,2-diol ether, or an alkanolamine.  As this invention leads to a more attractive process for the production of the olefin oxide, it concurrently leads to a more attractive process which comprises producing the olefin oxide in accordance with the invention and the subsequent use of the obtained olefin oxide in the manufacture of the 1,2-diol, 1,2-diol ether, and/or alkanolamine.<br>
The conversion into the 1,2-diol or the l,2-dio,l ether may comprise, for -example, reacting the olefin oxide with water, suitably using an acidic or a basic catalyst.  For example, for making predominantly the 1,2-diol and less 1,2-<br>
diol ether, the olefin oxide may be reacted with a ten fold molar excess of water, in a liquid phase reaction in presence of an acid catalyst, e.g. 0.5-1.0 %w sulfuric acid, based on the total reaction mixture, at 50-70 °C at 1 bar<br>
solute, or in a gas phase reaction at 130-240 °C and 20-40 bar absolute,preferably in the absence of a catalyst.<br>
the proportion of water is lowered the proportion of 1,2-diol ethers in the reaction mixture is increased.  The 1,2-diol ethers thus produced may be a di-ether, tri-ether, tetra-ether or a subsequent ether.  Alternative 1,2-diol ethers may be prepared by converting the olefin oxide with an alcohol, in particular a primary alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol, by replacing at least a portion of the water by the alcohol.<br>
The conversion into the alkanolamine may comprise, for<br>
example, reacting the olefin oxide with ammonia.  Anhydrous<br>
aqueous ammonia may be used, although anhydrous ammonia<br>
is typically used to favour the production of<br>
monoalkanolamine.  For methods applicable in the conversion<br>
of the olefin oxide into the alkanolamine, reference may be<br>
made   to,    for  example   US-A-4845296,   which  is   incorporated herein by  reference.<br>
The   1,2-diol   and  the   1,2-diol   ether may  be  used  in   a large   variety  of   industrial   applications,   for   example  in  the fields of  food,   beverages,   tobacco,   cosmetics,   thermoplastic polymers,   curable resin systems,   detergents,   heat  transfer systems,   etc.     The  alkanolamine  may be used,   for example, in  the  treating   ("sweetening")   of  natural gas.<br>
Unless  specified otherwise,   the  low-molecular weight organic compounds  mentioned herein,   for example   the  olefins,.-1,2-diols,   1,2-diol   ethers,   alkanolamines and   reaction modifiers,   have  typically at most   40  carbon  atoms,   more typically  at  most   20   carbon   atoms,   in particular  at  most   10 carbon  atoms,   more   in  particular   at  most  6  carbon  atoms.     As defined herein,   ranges  for  numbers   of   carbon   atoms   (i.e. carbon  number)   include  the  numbers   specified   for   the   limits of   the  ranges.<br>
Having  generally described   the   invention,    a   further understanding may  be   obtained  by   reference  to   the   following examples,   which   are  provided   for  purposes  of   illustration only   and  are   not   intended  to  be   limiting  unless   otherwise specified. EXAMPLES Preparation of  Carriers<br>
A  carrier   (designated  hereinafter  as  "Carrier  A")   was made   by mixing   the   following   ingredients:<br>
1.	67.4   parts  by   weight   (pbw)    of   an  α-alumina   with  d50  of 2 9   µm;<br>
2.	29  pbw  of  an   α-alumina   with   d50  of   3  µm;<br>
3.	3   pbw  of   aluminum  oxide    (in   the   form  of   boehmite);<br>
A.	0.5   pbw   of   silica    (in   the   form  of   amnonia   stabilized<br>
silica   sol);   and<br>
5.   0.1 pbw of sodium oxide (in the form of sodium acetate).<br>
To this mixture were added 5 %w, relative to the mixture weight, of petroleum jelly and 9 %w, relative to the mixture weight, of burnout material and 0.1 %w, relative to the mixture weight, of boric acid.  Water (about 30 %w, relative to the mixture weight) was then added in an amount to make the mixture extrudable and this mixture was then extruded to form formed bodies in the form of hollow cylinders that are about 8 mm in diameter and 8 mm long. These were then dried and fired in a kiln at 1425 °C, for 4 hours in air to produce -Carrier A.  As regards procedures followed in this carrier preparation, reference may be made to US-A-5100859.<br>
A second carrier (hereinafter "Carrier B") was made by the same procedure as Carrier A, except that 14 %w of burnout material was used, instead of 9 %w.<br>
A third carrier (hereinafter "Carrier C") was made by the same procedure as Carrier A, except that:<br>
20 pbw of the α-alumina with d50 of 3 µm was used instead of 29 pbw;<br>
76.4 pbw of an a-alumina with d50 of 16 µm was used, instead of the a-alumina with d50 of 28 µm;<br>
8 %w of burnout material was used, instead of 9 %w; and<br>
14 %w, relative to the mixture weight, of the petroleum jelly was used, instead of 5 %w.<br>
For comparative purposes, an a-alumina was prepared according to the process as described in Example 1 of US-A-5100859 (hereinafter "Carrier D")-<br>
The carriers exhibited characteristics as indicated in Table I.  The pore size distribution is specified as the volume fraction (%v) and the volume (ml/g) of the pores having diameters in the specified ranges (
10  µm,   and  &gt;10  µm),   relative  to  the   total  pore  volume "Pore  volume"   represents   the  total  pore  volume.<br>
TABLE I<br><br>

Preparation of catalysts<br>
A silver-amine-oxalate stock solution was prepared by the following procedure:<br>
415 g of reagent-grader sodium hydroxide were dissolved in 2340 ml de-ionized water and the temperature was adjusted to 50 °C.<br>
1699 g high purity "Spectropure" silver nitrate was dissolved in 2100 ml de-ionized water and the temperature was adjusted to 50 °C.<br>
The sodium hydroxide solution was added slowly to the silver nitrate solution, with stirring, while maintaining a solution temperature of 50 °C.  This mixture was stirred for 15 minutes, then the temperature was lowered to 40 °C.<br>
Water was removed from the precipitate created in the mixing step and the conductivity of the water, which contained sodium and 'nitrate ions, was measured.  An amount<br>
of fresh deionized water equal to the amount removed was added back to the silver solution.  The solution was stirred for 15 minutes at 40 °C.  The process was repeated until the conductivity of the water removed was less than 90 µmho/cm. 1500 ml fresh deionized water was then added.<br>
630 g of high-purity oxalic acid dihydrate were added in approximately 100 g increments.  The temperature was keep at 40 °C and the pH was kept above 7.8.<br>
Water was removed from this mixture to leave a highly concentrated silver-containing slurry. The silver oxalate slurry was cooled to 30 °C.<br>
.699 g of 92 %w ethylenediamine (8% de-ionized water) was added while maintaining a temperature no greater than 30 °C.   The resulting solution contained approximately 27-33 %w silver.<br>
Enough 45 %w aqueous cesium hydroxide and water was added to this solution to give a finished catalyst having 14.5 %w silver and a cesium loading which provides the optimum selectivity.  Actual cesium loadings have been specified in Table II, hereinafter.<br>
Carriers A, B and D, prepared as indicated under the heading "Preparation of Carriers", were impregnated with the impregnation solution and dried, as follows, to form Catalyst A (according to the invention), Catalyst B (according to the invention) and Catalyst D (for comparison), respectively.<br>
A carrier sample of approximately 30 g was placed under a 25 mm Hg vacuum for 1 minute at ambient temperature. Approximately 50 g of the impregnating solution was then introduced to submerse the carrier, and the vacuum was maintained at 25 mm Hg for an additional 3 minutes.  The vacuum was then released and the excess impregnating solution was removed from the catalyst pre-cursor by<br>
centrifugation   at   500   rpm  for   two   minutes.      The   catalyst pre-cursor was   then   dried while   being  shaken ,at   250  °C  for 5.5  minutes  in  a   stream of  air.<br>
The   catalysts   were  used  to  produce  ethylene   oxide   from ethylene  and oxygen.     To do this,   1.5  to  2   g   of  crushed catalyst  were  loaded   into  a  stainless  steel   U-shaped  tube. The  tube was  immersed  in a molten metal bath   (heat medium) and  the  ends were   connected to  a  gas   flow  system.     The weight  of catalyst   used and the   inlet  gas   flow  rate (0.28   Nl/minute)    were   adjusted  to  give  a  gas   hourly space velocity of  6800   Nl/(l.h),   as  calculated  for  un-ground bulk catalyst.     The  inlet   gas  pressure  was  1530   kPa.<br>
The  gas  mixture  passed through   the  catalyst   bed,   in   a "once-through"   operation,   during   the   entire   test   run including  the   start-up,   consisted  of   25  %v  ethylene,   7   %v oxygen,   5  %v  carbon   dioxide,   63   %v  nitrogen   and   2.0  to   6.0 ppmv   ethyl  chloride.<br>
The   initial   reactor   temperature   was   180   °C   and  this   was ramped  up at   a   rate   of   10  °C  per   hour  to  225   °C   and  then adjusted   so as   to   achieve  a  constant   ethylene   oxide  content of   1.5   %v  in   the   outlet  gas  stream  at  an  ethyl   chloride concentration   of   2.5   ppmv.     Performance  data   at   this conversion  level   are   usually  obtained  when   the   catalyst  has been   on   stream   for   a   total  of   at   least   1-2   days.<br>
The   initial   performance  values   for  selectivity  and temperature  are   reported   in  Table   II,   below.      A   lower temperature  needed   to   accomplish   a   certain   ethylene  oxide content   in  the   outlet   gas   stream   is   indicative   for  a  higher activity   of   the   catalyst.<br>
