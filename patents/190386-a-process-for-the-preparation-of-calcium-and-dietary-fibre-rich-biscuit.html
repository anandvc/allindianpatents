				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of calcium and dietary fibre rich biscuits.<br>
This invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of calcium and dietary fibre rich baked fpod using single natural source.<br>
Calcium is a vital nutrient in food, required for growth and maintenance of bone m&amp;ss as well as maintenance of normal health particularly among children, pregnant women and lactating mothers. Calcium requirement for adult is 400mg/day, adolescent children, it is 600mg/day and for pregnant women and lactating mother, it is 1000 mÂ§/day (Recommended dietary allowances of calcium for Indians, ICMR Report 1989.). This daily requirement is being met mostly by dairy products which contributes 70% of the requirement and the rest by green leafy vegetables, as cereals are poor source of calcium (Gopalan, C., Shastry, B.V. and Balasubramanian, S.C., Nutritive value of Indian foods., IGMR Publications., NIN, 1989, Hyderabad). Dietary survey carried out indicated a wide variation in the consumption of milk ranging from 256 ml to as low as 45 ml in different socio-economic groups as well as in urban-rural population (Average intake of milk - Rural India., Nutrition News, vol 2:1, NIN, 1981., and Consumption of milk in different socio-economic groups in India, vol 10:1, NIN, 1989.).The consumption of green leafy vegetable has also been repotted to be low among different sections of the population. {Since the consumption of calcium rich milk and green leafy vegetable is on the lower side, the calcium intake is also low especially, among economically weaker section as well in rural population (NNMB<br>
Reports, vol 12:3, NIN, 1991.).Several dietary factors such as type and quantity of  calcium intake (Greger, J.L., Krzykowski, C.E., Khazen, R.R. and  Kroshoc C.L.,       Mineral utilisation by rats fed various  commercially available  calcium supplements  or milk.,  J.  Nutr.,  117:717, 1987.),  quantity  of  protein intake (Linkswiler,  H.M.,  Zemel, M.B.,   Hegsled,   M.  and Schaette,    S.,    Protein  induced hypercalciurea.,   Federation Proc.   40:2429,   1981),   sodium chloride  intake (Totna, R.B. and Culis, D.J.,    Dietary  fiber., Effect   on      mineral  bioavailability.,   Food   Technology. 23:111,  1986)  and  other dietary  components  present  in  food<br>
(Allen, L.H., Calcium bioavailability and absorption - A review. Am J. Clin. Nutr. 35:783., 1982) influence the calcium.; bioavailability. Hence, the actual availability of calcium in the diet, particularly in the Indian diet may be low. In recent years with increase in health awareness, marketing of calcium salts (Sheik, M.S., Santa, C.A., Nicar, M.J., Scluter, L.R. andj Fordton, J.S., Gastrointestinal absorption of calcium from milk; and calcium salts. New Engl. J. Med., 317:532., 1987) in the form of tablets and fortified beverage mixes are being promoted!<br>
(Medeiros, D.M., Bock, M.A., Ortiz, M., Raab, C., Read, M., Schutz, H.G., Sehechan, E.J. and Williams D.K., Vitamin and mineral supplementation practices of adults in seven Western states. J. Am. Diet. Assoc. 89:383, 1989). In western countries, more and more people are taken to calcium tablets an4 supplements, over and above their intake from the food sources,, despite the fact that healthy children and adults should obtain their adequate nutrient from dietary sources and not frotfi synthetic sources (Berner, A.L., McBean, L.D. and Lofgren, P.A.,<br>
Calcium and    chronic disease prevention.  Challenges  to the-food  industry.  Food Technology.  44(3):50, 1990; and Diet  and; health:    Implications  for  reducing  chronic       disease Executive  committee  summary on Diet and Health.       Food and Nutr. Board.  Natl, Acadamy Press, Washington D.C.,  1989} .   The real need is for all the children and adults from the low  socio-economic  groups  and persons having higher  calcium requirement like pregnant  women and lactating mothers as  well  as  elderly post-menopausal women (Berner, A.L., McBean, L.D.  and Lofgren, P.A.  Calcium and    chronic disease prevention.  Challenges to the food industry.     Food Technology. 44(3):50,  1990;   and: Recommended dietary allowances of calcium for    Indians,   ICMR Report 1989.) for whom a low cost easily available fortified food is essential  (NNMB Reports vol 11:1, NIN,   1990;   and  Ris, B.K.,    Thomsen,   K.   and  Christiansen,   C.   Does   calcium supplementation prevent post-menopausal bone loss?  New  Engl. J. Med. 316: 173, 1987).<br>
Due  to  change in the socio-economic status, more  and more people  are taken to refined and polished foods which are  devoid of  dietary fibre.  Lack of dietary fibre in food leads  to diet related diseases like diabetes, hypertension, obesity and colonic disorder especially in higher income group (Hugh Trowell,    Role of dietary fibre-. Symposium on "Role of     Dietary fibre in Health,"   Am. J. Clin. Nutr. Supplement to    Vol. 31, No.  10, page  S3-S11, October 1978) .   Diet rich in calcium and dietary fibre  has  been  found beneficial  in  countering  osteoporosis, hypertension,  diabetes,  obesity and colonic  diseases  (Berner, A.L.,  McBean, L.D. and Lofgren, P.A. ,  Calcium and     chronic disease prevention.,  Challenges to the food industry.,   Food<br>
Technology.  44(3):50, 1990.; Gruchow, H.W., Sobociuski, K.A. and Barboriak,  J.J., Calcium intake and the relationship of  dietary-sodium  and potassium to blood pressure.,  Am. J. Clin.  Nutr., 48:1463., 1988;   Sempos, C., Kovar, C.P., Johnson, M.G.,  Drizd, C.T.  and Yettey,     E.,  Dietary calcium and blood pressure  iri national    health  and nutrition examination survey I  and  II.,' Hypertension   8: 1067-1073., 1986;  Lipkin, M. and Newmark,  H. Effect  of  added dietary calcium on  colonic  epithelial  cell proliferation in subjects at high risk  for  familial  colonic: cancer.,   New Engl.  J. Med.,   313:1381.,  1985;  Lipkin,  M., Friedman,  E., Winwer, S.J. and Newmark, H.,  Colonic  epithelial cell proliferation in responders  and non-    responders  to; supplementary dietary calcium.,  Cancer Res. 49:     248., 1989 ,-and Hugh Trowell, 1978.  Role of dietary  fibre:  Symposium on "Role  of     Dietary  fibre in Health".   Am.  J.  Clin.  Nutr. Supplement  to  Vol. 31, No. 10, page  S3-S11,  October 1978.). Hence,  there  is a need for enrichment of calcium as well  as dietary fibre content of commonly used food products.<br>
Presently available calcium enriched products are mostly baaed on milk, products and hence they are expensive for the common man. Some of the products available have been enriched with synthetic calcium salts such as calcium sulphate, calcium; citrate etc. Therefore, there is a need to develop an economically affordable product based on natural food materials and make available for the use of common man. So far no product is available where the product is rich in both calcium as well as fibre and also based on natural source.<br>
Biscuit  is a popular bakery product consumed by all  cross sections of population.  The production of biscuit, at present,<br>
is  estimated to be 1.1 million tons and is expected to  increase at  the  estimated  growth rat  of 7-8% per annum .   It  has  ail advantage of  excellent  storage property of  6-8  months undet ambient  conditions and therefore, it is easily transported   and marketed all over the country. Over 50% of biscuits produced  is consumed  in rural areas and is an ideal vehicle for  nutritional! enrichment  to  improve the nutritional status of  rural  people.: Biscuits  based on composite flour, wherein wheat flour is partly replaced by other non-wheat flours for nutritional  and other advantages is well known (Dendy, D.A.V., Kasasian, R., Bent,  A., Clarke,  P.A.,  and James,     A.W., Composite  flour  technology bibliography  (2nd    edn.).  G89, Tropical Products  Institute, London  ,  1975; and Tsen, C.C., Regular  and protein  fortified: cookies   from      composite  flours.   Cereals   Food  World, 21(12) :633,  1976) .  Soya, sunflower, groundnut and  cotton  seed flours were used to increase the protein content in biscuit (Kim, J.C.,    Manufacturing  biscuits   from   composite    flours., Composite  Flour Sym. Tech. Inst. Bogota, Colombia , 1972;  Tsen, C.C.,  Peters, E.M., Schaffer, T. and Hoover, W.J., 1973.   High-protein   cookies.   I.    Effect  of   soy   fortification   and surfactants.

Today, 17 : 70 . ,1972 . ) . Reported studies  on<br>
incorporation  of  non-wheat- cereal and tuber flours  in  biscuit were  aimed towards economical and other advantages (Tsen,  C.C.,; Regular and protein fortified  cookies   from  composite flours., Cereals Food World, 21 (12) : 633 . ,1976; Kissel, L.T, and Yamazaki^ W.T.,  Protein  enrichment  of     cookie     flours  with  wheat gluten    and soy flour derivatives.  Cereal Chem., 52 â¢. 63 8 . , 1975 ; Badi,  S.M.  and  Hosney,  R.C.,     Use  of  sorghum  and  pearl millet  flours in cookies.,  Cereal Chem., 53: 733.,  1976;  here the authors have used sorghum and pearl millet separately ;  Kim, J.C.,    Manufacturing  biscuits   from   composite    flours., Composite  Flour  Sym. Tech. Inst. Bogota,  Colombia.,1972;   and' Chandra  Shekhara, S. and Shurpalekar, S.R.,  On the  use     of potato and cassava  flours  in soft dough biscuits.,   J.  Fd Sci.  Technol.  21(4) =239., 1984).  Some of the millets are  rich in minerals and dietary fibre. Incorporation of millet flours  in biscuit  will  increase its mineral and  dietary  fibre  content. However,  the millets need a suitable processing for the  removal of husk portion so that its deleterious effect on the quality  of the product  is reduced to the minimum.  In the  present  study, other  conditions  for the removal of husk present in  different millets  to obtain refined flour and  to employ  it  at  optimum: level  in biscuit  formulation  have  been  used  so  that   the deleterious  effect  on biscuit is minimised to  a  large  extent without sacrificing the nutritional advantage.<br>
The  main objective  of  the  invention   is   simultaneous' enrichment of biscuit with calcium and dietary fibre through use of  natural source.  Calcium enriched biscuit will be useful  in; meeting the calcium requirement of  adolescent children, pregnant-women,  lactating mothers  and post-menopausal women as well  asmajority of people living in rural areas . Apart frpro this,  thef calcium and dietary fibre enriched biscuit will als0 be helpful|<br>
in couatering tfce diet related diseases  like osteoporosis,!<br>
f hypertension,   diabetes,   obesity  and  colonic   diseases.|<br>

Example 1 :<br>
i) Processing of millets and preparation of refined wheat flour(maida)-millet composite flour blends: Commercial samples of Pearl millet, little millet, finger millet and kodu millet are procured locally and cleaned manually by sieves and winnows (or mechanically using machines like separators, aspirators and destoners for large scale cleaning). They are ground in a plate mill (Chakki) to a medium particle size (112- 670 micron) and sieved to remove coarser bran particles using 525 micron sieve and 90% extraction rate millet flours (112-525 micron) are<br>
Obtained. The throughs are aqain ground in a laboratory mill such that the particle size of millet flours art' similar to that of refined wheat flour (112-132 micron). These flours are analysed for chemical characteristics and the data are Table (Removed)<br>
A - kodu millet;  B - little millet;  C - finger millet;D - pearl millet;<br>
Composite flour blends based on refined wheat flour and millet flour are prepared by blending 20 parts of millet flour with 80 parts of refined wheat flour. Biscuits are prepared from the above blends according to the methodology given below:<br>

water  for 20g of  millet Hours  A, B, C and  D  in  iOUg	blend<br>
respectively.<br>
Method of preparation:<br>
a)	Sugar powder, hydrogenated fat, glucose,  lecithin and vanilla<br>

b)	Milk powder, salt, ammonium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate<br>
and sodium aluminium sulphate are dispersed separately in  small<br>
quantities of the required water and added to thr- above cream and<br>
creamed further for 4-6 min<br>
c)	Flour blend is then added and blended for 4 to 6 min to get a<br>
soft dough.<br>
d)	The dough is sheeted to 15 mm thickness and cut to a  circular<br>
shape of 5 cm dia, with  seven doctoring holes  made on it.<br>
e)	They are baked at 200 2()SÂ°C for ') 10 min. and coolod.<br>
iii)  Quality  of  biscuit:    Physical  characteristic  such  as weight, width and thickness are measured and width/thickness(W/T) ratio  is  calculated. Sensory qualities  such as  crust  colour, crust  appearance,  crumb colour, texture, taste and  flavour  as well as overall quality are assessed by 9 semi-trained panellists and average total scores(60N are arrived at. The sensory  quality data  are analysed according to Duncan's New Multiple Range  Test and  the  biscuits  having different  total  scores   are  graded according to the following:  excellent - 60; very good -48;  good &gt;36;  fair  &gt;30;  poor  
iv) Effect of incorporation of different millet flours on the sensory as well as nutritional quality of biscuits: Biscuits are prepared using composite flour containing different millet flours as per the methodology described above and the results are presented in Table 2.<br>

The data show that use of millet flours A, B and C produce biscuits having higher thickness arid lower width/thickness(W/T) ratio as compared to that made from blend containing millet flour D and refined wheat flour(control). The crust as well as crumb colour of biscuits made with millet flours C and D are darker. The scores for texture, taste, flavour and overall quality of biscuits made with millet flour D are lower as compared to others. It has hard, and gritty texture. The overall total scores of biscuits containing A, B and C millet flours are rated as good while that containing millet flour D is rated as satisfactory. Therefore, it is inferred that among the different millet flours, use of A, B and C yield good quality biscuits. With regards to nutritional quality, biscuits prepared with millet flour A, B and C have higher dietary fibre content. However, the calcium content is highest in biscuit made with millet flour C (64.5 mg%), which is about twice as that of other biscuits. In case of biscuits made with other millet flours, hardly any increase in calcium is observed (Table 3).<br>

Based on the sensory as well as nutritional quality, millet flour C is selected as a source for nutritional improvement with respect to dietary fibre and calcium. Further studies arerried out on composite flour blends containing millet flour C.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Preparation of different extraction rate millet  flour-C:   The<br>
selected millet  is cleaned and ground in a plate mill to a flour<br>
of medium fine particle size.  It is then, sieved through  sieves<br>
of different apertures  to obtain 50, 70, 90 and 100%  extraction<br>
