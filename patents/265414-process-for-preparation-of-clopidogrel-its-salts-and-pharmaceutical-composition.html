The application is cognate with Indian Patent application no.54/KOL/2003 filed<br>
with a provisional specification on 03.02.2003<br>
The invention relates to an improved and cost effective process for<br>
preparation of clopidogrel and its salts including clopidogrel bisulphate, a<br>
biologically active thiophene, preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
of clopidogrel and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The<br>
invention also relates to novel salts of clopidogrel, their preparation and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising them.<br>
Clopidogrel bisulfate (I) i.e., methyl (S)-(+)-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-<br>
thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate sulphate, is an ADP (Adenosine Di-<br>
phosphate) receptor antagonist that is indicated for the reduction of<br>
atherosclerotic events including myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and<br>
vascular death in patients with atherosclerosis manifested by recent stroke,<br>
myocardial infarction or established peripheral vascular disease (Blair Jarvis<br>
and Kerryn Simpson, Drugs 2000, Aug; 60(2): 347-377).<br><br><br>
Atherothrombosis can give rise to unstable angina, myocardial infarction or<br>
stroke in susceptible individuals. Platelets, which do not interact with the<br>
endothelium of normal vessels, play a central role in atherothrombosis by<br>
adhering to exposed sub-endothelial structures in damaged vessels.<br>
Platelets may be activated by several substances. Among these, ADP plays<br>
an important role. ADP is present in high concentrations in the dense granules<br>
within platelets and can initiate and reinforce aggregation after secretion of<br>
these granules (George JN. Platelets. Lancet 2000 Apr. 29: 355: 1531-9).<br>
Clopidogrel bisulfate is an antiplatelet agent that selectively and irreversibly<br>
blocks ADP-induced platelet aggregation. After activation by cytochrome<br>
P450 (CYP)-mediated hepatic metabolism, clopidogrel bisulfate is a selective<br>
and irreversible inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation (Blair Jarvis and<br>
Kerryn Simpson, Drugs 2000, Aug; 60(2): 347-377).<br>
In literature, it is known that methyl-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-<br>
thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate of formula (II) and its salts can be used in<br>
the treatment of platelet aggregation inhibitory and anti-thrombotic effect. The<br>
process for preparing methyl-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-thieno[3,2-<br>
c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate and its salts are described in WO 98/51689.<br><br><br>
According to US 4,847,265, it was found that the biological activity resides<br>
only with (+)-stereoisomer i.e., methyl (S)-(+)-alpha-(2-ch!orophenyl)-6,7-<br>
dihydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate sulphate (I) also known as<br>
clopidogrel bi-sulphate.<br>
Also, US 4,847,265 describes the process to obtain clopidogrel bisulphate (I)<br>
i.e., methyl(S)-(+)-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-<br>
5(4H)-acetate sulphate, wherein methyl-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-<br>
thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate (II) is resolved by laevorotatory camphor-<br>
10-sulfonic acid to give methyl(R)-(-)-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-<br>
thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate camphor sulfonic acid salt (III), which<br>
remains in the mother liquor and can be converted in to methyl (R)-(-)-alpha-<br>
(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate (XII) by<br>
known method, where as methyl(S)-(+)-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-<br>
thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate camphor sulfonic acid salt (IV) separates<br>
out as solid as shown in Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
Further, in order to obtain clopidogrel bisulfate (I), the methyl (S)-(+)-alpna-(2-<br>
chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate camphor<br>
sulfonic acid salt (IV) is converted into (+)- stereo isomer of (II) i.e., methyl<br>
(S)-(+)-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-thieno[3I2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate<br>
by using aqueous sodium bicarbonate in dichloromethane, which is further<br>
reacted with H2S04 in acetone to give desired product, clopidogrel bisulfate(l).<br>
However, the undesired isomer i.e., methyl (R)-(-)-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-<br>
dihydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate camphor sulfonic acid salt (III),<br>
which remains in mother liquor is unused and hence is practically considered<br>
as waste. Also, it should be noted that a part of useful salt i.e., methyl (S)-(+)-<br>
alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate<br>
camphor sulfonic acid salt (IV), which remains dissolved in mother liquor is<br>
also not recovered. Hence, the quantities of (III) and (IV) from mother liquor<br>
are wasted.<br>
If the undesired R-isomer (III) is not used then, the resolution step being the<br>
extreme last step, all the reagents, solvents, drying agents, purification<br>
agents, utilities, manpower from the first step of the synthesis till the resolution<br>
step which are used up in the formation of discarded R-isomer (III) are<br>
wasted.<br>
Considering the high demand of the potential drug, there is a need for a<br>
process, which uses the undesired isomer i.e., methyl (R)-(-)-alpha-(2-<br>
i chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate	camphor<br>
sulfonic acid salt (III) in an intelligent way. Also, the recovery of useful salt i.e.,<br>
I methyl (S)-(+)-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-<br><br>
acetate camphor sulfonic acid salt from mother liquor is necessary for the<br>
process economy.<br>
As mentioned in Scheme 2, WO 00/27840 (Sanofi - Synthelabo) describes the<br>
racemization of undesired intermediate amide (V) i.e., (-)-[2-(2-<br>
thienyl)ethylamino] (2-chlorophenyl)acetamide. The racemization process<br>
converts undesired R-isomer of amide (V) into racemic amide (VI) i.e., [2-(2-<br>
thienyl)ethylamino] (2-chlorophenyl)acetamide using base.<br><br>
Further racemized amide (VI) is converted to clopidogrel bisulfate (I) as<br>
shown in Scheme 3.<br><br><br><br>
The drawback of the above synthetic route is that racemized amide (VI)<br>
further needs to be converted into clopidogrel bisulfate(l) by a number of<br>
reaction steps as shown in Scheme 3. Thus, it requires more number of<br>
reaction steps for recycling racemic amide (VI), in order to get the final<br>
product i.e., clopidogrel bisulfate (I). Also, it requires more (a) time, (b)<br>
reagents, (c) solvents, (d) purifying agents, (e) manpower, (f) utility, which<br>
makes this recycling of undesired stereoisomer to get clopidogrel bisulfate a<br>
costlier process.<br>
Also, WO 02/059128 describes the process for the racemization of undesired<br>
R- isomer i.e., compound (V) to intermediate amide (VI) as well as undesired<br>
R-isomer of compound (II) in the presence of base. The main drawback of this<br>
process lies in the use of base such as potassium tert-butoxide, sodium<br>
hydride which are hazardous and costly base.<br>
It needs to be appreciated that there is a need for a racemization process for<br>
the preparation of clopidogrel bisulfate (I), which converts undesired R-isomer<br>
into racemic form. Also it should require minimum (a) reaction steps, (b) time,<br>
(c) reagents, (d) solvents, (e) purifying agents, (f) manpower and (g) utility and<br>
also devoid of hazardous reagents to make the process cost-effective and<br>
commercially viable.<br><br><br>
In US 4,847,265, the reaction-step for the conversion of racemic clopidogrel<br>
base to the camphor sulphonate salt of methyl (S)-(+)-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-<br>
6,7-dihydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate requires a reaction time period<br>
of 72 hrs and is also accompanied by intermittent work-up for volume<br>
reduction. This implies increase in utilities and manpower to complete the<br>
production cycle, rendering the process commercially expensive. Thus, there<br>
is need to reduce the reaction time of the said reaction, while simultaneously<br>
reducing the work-up to make the process convenient and economically more<br>
viable.<br>
In US 4,847,265, it is acknowledged that various salts namely acetate,<br>
benzoate, fumarate, maleate, citrate, tartrate, gentisate, mesylate, benzene<br>
sulfonate, lauryl sulfonate, dobesilate, tosylate and hydrochloride of<br>
clopidogrel are hygroscopic and thus makes them difficult to handle on<br>
industrial scale. Thus, there is difficulty in their purification, isolation and<br>
storage. Furthermore, these salts are amorphous. For preparation of<br>
pharmaceutical composition the compound i.e., active pharmaceutical<br>
ingredient (API) is preferred in the form of crystalline nature. The<br>
pharmaceutical usage always demands pure compounds, as it goes for<br>
human consumption. However, the impure compounds, which are the results<br>
of purification difficulty, cannot lead to a drug in the market. Hence, there is a<br>
need for a process of their production, which can be handled on an industrial<br>
scale and can generate crystalline compound.<br><br><br><br>
It is an object of the invention to recycle the undesired R-isomer namely<br>
methyl (R)-(-)-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-<br>
acetate (XII), in the synthesis of clopidogrel and its salts, which is practically<br>
considered as waste, and make the process more cost effective and<br>
commercially viable.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
racemization of the said R-isomer for recycling to the process for synthesis of<br>
clopidogrel<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide an improved commercially<br>
viable and cost effective racemization process towards the synthesis of the<br>
clopidogrel or its salts, which requires minimum (a) reaction steps, (b) time, (c)<br>
reagents, (d) solvents, (e) purifying agents (f) manpower and (g) utility and<br>
also avoids hazardous reagents.<br>
A further object of the invention is to reduce the time required for the<br>
preparation of the reaction intermediates.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a cost effective method of<br>
preparation of clopidogrel and its salts, namely clopidogrel mesylate,<br><br><br>
clopidogrel hydroiodide and clopidogrel perchlorate, and the other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts mentioned herein.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide the industrially suitable<br>
procedure to synthesize the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of clopidogrel.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide novel clopidogrel salts.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide pharmaceutical composition with<br>
clopidogrel salts.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a process for racemization of methyl<br>
(R)-(-)-alpha-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate<br>
(XII)<br><br>

Preparation of clopidogrel mesylate<br>
In a 3 lit 3-neck round-bottom flask, 347.45 gm of clopidogrel (XIV) was<br>
reacted with 104.3183 gm of methane sulfonic acid in 1646.9 gm of methanol<br>
at 30-35°C followed by distillation of the methanol to prepare a solution of<br>
clopidogrel mesylate (645.553 gm). The sample of the solution was analyzed<br>
for the content of clopidogrel mesylate % w/w. The analysis indicated that<br>
clopidogrel mesylate was present in 69.68% w/w in methanol.<br>
Further from the above solution, 100 gm of solution was removed and<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure at 30-35°C to give 69.68 gm of white to<br>
off-white crystalline powder (99.67%).<br><br><br>

Suppository formulations may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient<br>
with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures<br>
but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to<br>
release the drug. Suitable excipients include, for example, cocoa butter and<br>
polyethylene glycols.<br>
Topical formulations, such as creams, ointments, gels and aqueous or oily<br>
solutions or suspensions, may generally be obtained by formulating an active<br>

hydrocarbons may be used and the aerosol device is conveniently arranged<br>
to dispense a metered quantity of active ingredient.<br>
The amount of active ingredients that can be combined with one or more<br>
excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending<br>
upon the host treated and the particular route of administration.<br>
In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compounds of the<br>
present invention may also be administered by controlled release means or<br>
delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such<br>
as those described in U.S. Patent Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809;<br>
3,598,123 4,008,719; 5, 674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548;<br>
5,073,543; 5,639,746; 5,354,556 and 5,733,566, the disclosures of which are<br>
each incorporated herein by express reference thereto. These<br>
pharmaceutical compositions can be used to provide slow or controlled<br>
release of one or more of the active ingredients therein using, for example,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable<br>
membranes, osmotic systems multiple layer coatings, microparticles,<br>
liposomes, microspheres, or like, or a combination thereof to provide the<br>
desired release profile in varying proportions.<br>
Suitable controlled release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the<br>
art, including those described herein may be readily selected for use with the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Thus, single unit dosage forms<br>
suitable for oral administration, such as tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets,<br><br><br>
and the like, that are adapted for controlled-release are encompassed by the<br>
present invention.<br>
The salts of the present invention, particularly clopidogrel hydroiodide and<br>
clopidogrel mesylate exhibit excellent flowability properties, as indicated by<br>
their low values of angle of repose and high values of tapped density. Tapped<br>
density is of great importance when one considers the high dose capsule<br>
product or the homogeneity of a low-dose formulation in which there are large<br>
differences in drug and excipient densities.<br>
Tapped density is determined by the following procedure.<br>
10 gm of the salt is weighed and transferred into a dry measuring cylinder.<br>
Stoppered the cylinder with rubber cork and kept it in the tapped density<br>
apparatus. Operated the apparatus for 50 taps. Measured the volume after<br>
tapping and calculated the tapped density.<br>
Tapped density for clopidogrel hydroiodide is 0.991 g/ml, which is higher than<br>
that of clopidogrel bisulphate i.e. 0.834 g/ml. Good flowability properties are<br>
essential for an efficient tabletting operation. A good flow of the powder or<br>
granulation to be compressed is necessary to assure efficient mixing and<br>
acceptable weight uniformity for the compressed tablets. Pharmaceutical<br>
powders have angle-of-repose values varying from 25 to 45°, with lower<br>
values indicating better flow characteristics. The angle of repose is<br>
determined by the following procedure.<br><br><br>
A dry stainless steel funnel of length 14.0 cm, stem length of 8.0 cm, internal<br>
diameter 7.5 cm and an internal diameter of outflow opening of 0.8 cm. It is<br>
placed over a graph paper kept on a flat horizontal surface and fixed by a<br>
suitable device to maintain an upright position. Adjusted the distance between<br>
the lower end of the stem and the paper at 2.0 cm. The tip of the funnel was<br>
closed with the fore finger and the sample was poured along the side of the<br>
funnel upto the rim. The finger was removed to allow the sample to flow till the<br>
apex of the conical pile formed by the sample touches the lower end of the<br>
stem.<br>
Marked the circle formed by the sample and calculated the radius from the<br>
observed diameter. Calculated the tan from the following equation.<br>
Distance between paper and lower end of funnel in cm<br>
tan =	<br>
Radius in cm<br>
The angle of repose was calculated from the value of tan using the tangent<br>
table/scientific calculator.<br>
The angle of repose for clopidogrel bisulphate is found to be 22.73°, which is<br>
less than 25°. On the other hand the angle of repose for clopidogrel<br>
hydroiodide is found to be 28.56°. These properties lead to better<br>
processabilty of these salts for preparing oral solid dosage formulations like<br>
tablets and hard gelatin capsules.<br>
In the fasted state, pH of stomach is approximately 1.2 - 1.7. Past the pyloric<br>
sphincter between the stomach &amp; duodenum the pH is about 4-5. Beyond<br><br><br>
the proximal jejunum, pH is above 6. In fed conditions, the pH of the stomach<br>
may rise to 7. Dissolution in the pH of stomach will result in greater absorption<br>
from jejunum and ileum. The BCS allows estimation of likely contributions of<br>
three factors: dissolution, solubility and intestinal permeability, which affect<br>
oral drug absorption. The dissolution rate of drug can be controlled by<br>
changing the surface area and the solubility. One method of doing this is by<br>
changing the physical state as crystal form or salts (Notari. R Absorption of<br>
Drugs from Gastrointestinal Tract in Biopharmaceutics and Clinicai<br>
Pharmacokinetics and Introduction, 4th Edition, Marcel Decker, New York)<br>
The solubility data of the three salts of clopidogrel were generated in buffer of<br>
pH 1.2 and was found as given below in the Table.<br><br>
At a pH of 1.2, the solubility of the mesylate and hydroiodide salt is<br>
significantly better than that of the bisulphate salt (the solubility for the<br>
mesylate, hydroiodide and bisulphate being 204.17 mg/dl, 62.77 mg/dl and<br>
30.68 mg/dl respectively). From the data available it is expected that the<br><br>
mesylate and hydroiodide salt will be more soluble than the bisulphate salt at<br>
the relevant human gastric pH (pH 1.2 -1.8).<br>
The dissolution and dissolution rate are related to the solubility. One can<br>
increase the absorption rate by increasing the dissolution rate (Notarl. R<br>
Absorption of Drugs from Gastrointestinal Tract in Biopharmaceutics and<br>
Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Introduction, 4th Edition, Marcel Decker, New<br>
York). Therefore, drug dissolution in aqueous media being a significant<br>
contributor in its oral absorption; drugs with greater solubility and dissolution<br>
have less chance of oral drug absorption problems.<br>
The mesylate and the hydroiodide salts which are highly soluble at a pH of 1.2<br>
will be more rapidly and completely absorbed in the stomach and the upper Gl<br>
tract as compared to the bisulphate salt.<br>
The above aspects of the invention are illustrated by way of examples.<br>
