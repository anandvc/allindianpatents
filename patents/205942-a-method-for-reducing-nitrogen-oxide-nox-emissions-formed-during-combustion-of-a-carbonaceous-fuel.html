				<td>The present relates to a method for reducing NOx emissions from the combustion of carbonaceous fuels using three stages of oxidation and second stage in-situ furnace flue gas recirculation. In the first stage, a partial oxidation combustor is used to partially combust the fuel in the presence of preheated combustion air. The fuel gas produced in the partial oxidation process is passed to a second stage partial oxidation combustor while molten slag is removed and disposed of. Preheated combustion air also is introduced into the second stage of combustion to produce a slightly reducing flue gas and is injected into the furnace in such a way as to create the desired in-situ furnace flue gas recirculation. In the upper part of the furnace a third combustion air is mixed with the flue gas in a third stage of combustion to substantially complete the combustion process. Preheated steam may be added to the first or second stages of combustion. The stoichiometric ratios at each stage of combustion are controlled to minimize overall NOx emissions to acceptable levels. Further, an existing excess air cyclone-fired boiler furnace may be modified to operate in a three-stage combustion mode. This is accomplished by adding a preheated air system that includes two added air injection points into the furnace, with air introduction at a cyclone barrel re-entrant throat that is located at the interface between the cyclone barrel and the furnace, followed by overfire air introduction into the upper part of the furnace.</td>

This invention relates to a method for reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions formed during combustion of a carbonaceous fuel. More particularly, it refers to a combustion technique that uses two sequential stages of partial oxidation followed by a final stage of complete oxidation. In-situ furnace flue gas recirculation is incorporated in the second stage of partial oxidation to effect a cooler oxidation zone with lower localized oxygen concentrations.<br>
There are several patents that describe staged combustion techniques to reduce nitrogen oxides emissions from the combustion of fuels containing nitrogen. U.S. Pat. No. 3,727,562 describes a three stage process for reducing nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions wherein the first stage of combustion is operated with a deficiency of air and the unburned fuel from this stage is separated and burned in a second zone with excess air and then the first and second stage gases are burned in a third excess air stage. U.S. Pat. No. 4,343,606 describes a multi-stage<br><br>
combustion process wherein fuel gas produced in a first stage partial oxidation zone, operated at a stoichiometric air to fuel ratio of 0.50 to 0.625, followed by a second stage of oxidation operated at an air to fuel stoichiometric ratio of 1.0 or slightly greater. Following this, additional air is added to insure that (he fuel is completely oxidized- Other patents describe external flue gas recirculation such as U.S. Patent 5,002,484 for reducing NOx emissions. Still others use flue gas recirculation within the burners proper, e.g. U.S. Patents 5,316,469 and 5,562,438 to reduce NOx emissions. While these methods accomplish their intended purposes, they do not provide the NOx reduction required under current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations.<br>
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 set NOx emission limits for coal*fired utility boilers to be met in the year 2000, that range from 0.40 to 0.86 lb NOx/106 Btu depending on boiler type and many of the patented techniques mentioned above could have been used to meet these limits.  However, in response to the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (01 AG) State Implementation Plan (SIP) call to Eastern and Mid-Western States in 1998, the U.S. EPA has promulgated new rules for nitrogen oxides emissions for all types of coal-fired boilers that will require emissions of 0.15 lb NO106 Btu or less during the ozone season (May through September) in the year 2003.<br>
The combustion technologies commercially available today cannot meet this limit The<br>
only technology available to the carbonaceous fuel fired utility boiler industry that will guarantee<br>
tins low level of NOx emissions is the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology. The<br>
SCR method uses ammonia addition and a downstream catalyst to destroy the NOx produced in<br>
the coal combustion process. This approach is expensive both from capital and operating cost<br>
perspectives. Further, arsenic  in the  can poison the	Also,<br><br>
ammonium sulfites/sulfates and calcium sulfates from the combustion process can blind the catalyst, thereby reducing its effectiveness.<br>
Therefore, it would be very advantageous to have an improved combustion process that will yield nitrogen oxide emissions, when firing carbonaceous nitrogen containing fuels, of 0.15 lb NOX/106 Btu or less. Such a system will also provide a lower cost per ton of NOx reduced compared to SCR to provide the electric utility industry an economical technology to meet the newly promulgated level of nitrogen oxides emissions.<br>
The staged combustion with in-situ furnace flue gas recirculation method of the present invention is less costly than SCR technology in achieving these reductions and since catalyst, which can be poisoned from the products of carbonaceous fuel combustion, is not required, staged combustion with in-situ furnace flue gas recirculation represents a more reliable technology.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
I have discovered a process employing staged combustor and in-situ furnace flue gas recirculation techniques into one system that will reduce NOx emissions to the Year 2003 regulated limit of 
 <br>
molten slag. Although any staged combustor type could be used, the preferred types are those that remove molten slag from the combustor proper to minimize ash carryover and reduce slag fouling in the boiler furnace. Further, cyclone fired furnaces that operate under excess air conditions may be retrofitted to implement the three stage combustion technique.<br>
Typically, coal is fired in the first stage of the combustors under a stoichiometric ratio (SR) of air to coal of about 0.50 to 0.70 to minimize the NOx produced from the oxidation of fuel bound nitrogen. A fuel gas is exiting and molten slag separated out. In the second stage of combustion, preheated second stage combustion air is introduced into the fuel gas produced in the first stage, an air rate being added to yield an overall SR at this point of about 0.85 to 0.99. The method of air entry to provide for rapid mixing and high localized flame temperatures under a reducing atmosphere to yield the high temperature condition that provides for high combustion efficiency (defined as low unburned carbon content in ash). Since the flame zone is reducing (oxygen deficient) in the second stage partial oxidation zone, minimal thermal NOx is produced. The second stage combustion fuel gas and air introduction methods are designed to effect in-furnace flue gas recirculation (FGR) that allows part of the oxygen for the second stage partial oxidation to be provided by the FGR. This technique provides for lower localized oxygen concentrations in the flame zone that helps to minimize NOx formation.<br>
The second stage products of partial combustion rise up through the boiler furnace and are cooled by radiant heat transfer to the furnace water-walls. When the flue gases have been cooled down to a range of about 2300° to 2700°F, overfire air (OFA) is added to bring the overall SR at this point to a range of approximately 1.05 to 1.25 to complete the combustion<br><br>
process. NOx production is greatly reduced in this OFA zone because the temperatures are relatively low and thermal NOx production reactions are not favored.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
To achieve deep levels of NOx reduction using staged combustion for the firing of carbonaceous fuels requires that the stoichiometric air to fuel ratios be less than 1.0 during the<br><br>
process until the gases are cool enough to preclude thermal NOx production. I have discovered a process employing a three-stage combustion technique, with second stage flue gas recirculation (FGR), that will reduce NOx emissions preferably to a level less than 0.15 lb NOx/106 Btu.<br>
To implement this three-stage combustion technique, any of the first stages of existing staged combustors mentioned previously can be used wherein the air to fuel stoichiometric ratio (SR) can be operated in the 0.50 to 0.70 range. Such combustion technologies may add alkali compounds to reduce the coal ash slag viscosity and/or to capture sulfur in the molten slag. Steam may also be added to the first stage of combustion to improve carbon burnout, as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,458,659. Although any staged combustor type could be used, the most preferred are those that remove molten slag from the combustor or bottom of the furnace to minimize ash carryover and reduce slag fouling in the boiler furnace. Excess air cyclone-fired units may also be converted to the three-stage operation by adding preheated air at the re-entrant throat where the cyclone barrel fuel gases enter the furnace, or alternatively at points in the furnace below and/or above the re-entrant throats that further includes the addition of the upper furnace overfire air injection into the flame.<br>
Coal is fired into the first stage of the combustor under a sub-stoichiometric air condition that reduces the NOx produced from released fuel nitrogen oxidation. The first stage temperatures achieved are dependent on the fuel analysis, rate of steam or water addition, the temperature of the pre-heated air, air to fuel ratio, and the heat removal designed into the combustor or cyclone barrel. The first stage temperatures will typically be in the range of 2600° to 3000°F. The SR in this stage will typically be in the range of about 0.50 to 0.70. The first<br><br>
stage of combustion should preferably have a residence time of at least about 0.1 to 03 sec to provide for lower production of ammonia and hydrogen cyanide that are NOx precursors under subsequent high temperature, more oxidizing conditions. A fuel gas is produced and the molten slag removed, either from the combustor proper or from the bottom of the boiler furnace.<br>
In a second stage of combustion, preheated second stage combustion air is introduced into the fuel gas from the first stage. Second stage combustion air is added at a rate to yield an overall SR at this point in the range of about 0.85 to 0.99. This method of air entry is such to provide for rapid mixing and high localized flame temperatures that yield high temperatures, under reducing conditions, to provide for high combustion efficiency (low carbon in ash) and increase the kinetic rates of NOx destruction reactions. Since the flaipe zone is overall reducing (oxygen deficient) in the second stage partial oxidation zone, minimal thermal NOx is produced. The second stage combustion fuel gas and air introduction method are designed to effect in-situ furnace flue gas recirculation (FGR) that allows part of the oxygen to be provided by the FGR so that the rate of preheated atmospheric air to the second stage may be reduced, thus reducing the oxygen partial pressure and temperature in localized gas zones to minimize the formation of thermal NOx production. Each specific boiler will require physical and/or computational fluid dynamic (CDF) modeling to be completed to determine the optimum jet velocity and airflow orientation of the second stage flame air infection to create the desired FGR effect.<br>
The SR established in this second stage of partial oxidation is similar to the SR used in conventional Rebum technology, wherein fuel, such as natural gas is added to combustion flue gases in the hot part of the furnace, above and with some separation from the conventional<br><br>
burners, to reduce the furnace SR at the Reburn fuel injection point from the 1.10 to 1.20 range supplied by the burners entering the zone, down to an SR of about 0.90. The nominal 0.90 SR provides a reducing gas condition that converts nitric oxide (NO) that was formed in the excess air burner flames, back to atmospheric or diatomic nitrogen (N2). With the staged combustion technique of the present invention, the NOx and NOx precursor compounds (ammonia and hydrogen cyanide) exiting the first stage (typically a SR = 0.60) will be much lower than that of conventional burners that yield an overall excess air condition (SR &gt; 1.0). Since NOx production is greatly influenced by the oxygen partial pressure in the combustion zone, the higher the oxygen concentration, the higher the NOx production. By firing the coal in the first stage at an SR of 0.60 and by firing the fuel gas as it exits the first stage and enters the furnace at an SR of about 0.90, minimal NOx is formed, because the slightly reducing gases produced have the tendency to convert any NOx that has formed to N2. The in-situ furnace FGR also helps minimize localized temperature and oxygen concentration zones in the hot portion of the furnace.* The hydrocarbon radicals (CHX), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) produced in the first two stages of partial oxidation are favored to convert NO to N2 in accord with the following overall simplified reaction examples:<br>
NO + [CH]-1/2N2 + CO + 1/2 H2,<br>
NO + CO -&gt; 1/2 N2 + C02, and<br>
NO + H2-&gt;1/2N2 + H20.<br>
The slightly reducing gaseous products from the second stage rise upward through the<br>
boiler furnace and are cooled by radiant and convective heat transfer to the furnace watertube-<br>
walls. When the slightly reducing flue gases, containing 1 to 3 volume percent carbon<br>
monoxide, have cooled down to a range of about 2300° to 2700°F, overfire air (OFA) is added to<br>
complete the combustion process. NOx production is minimal in this OFA excess air zone<br>
tjttM<br><br>
because the temperatures are low and thermal NOx reactions are less favored than that for higher furnace temperatures.<br>
Throughout the following detailed process description, the same reference numerals refer to the same elements in the various figures.<br>
A typical example of the process of the present invention, preferably using the Florida Power Corporation staged combustor (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,423,702 and 5,458,659), is shown schematically in Fig. 1. It will be understood by those skilled in the art, that certain variations from this schematic could be made with such variations still being within the context of the present invention. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, a first stage combustor 10 is located in front of the entry 12 into the furnace-14. Openings 16 into each of the combustors receive a conventional fuel such as pulverized coal (for example) and an alkaline product such as lime or limestone (not shown) with the carrier air 8 or the preheated primary air 17. Controlled partial oxidation of the coal takes place in the combustor by regulation of the preheated (400° to 700°F) secondary air flow 18. The air to fuel stoichiometric ratio (SR) in first stage combustor 10 is maintained at about 0.50 to 0.70 (SRi) through control of the preheated air flow 17, and most preferably at about 0.60. In an alternative embodiment, the injection of steam or water 20 into the combustor 10 may be used, adding steam or water to yield a 0.1 to 0.3 steam or water to fuel weight ratio to enhance the partial oxidation or gasification reactions. With the first stage combustor 10, the products of partial combustion in the form of a fuel gas and the molten slag from the ash portion of the coal plus the inorganic alkali compounds are separated in the partial oxidation chamber 22, and a molten slag eutectic 24 containing alkali compounds and coal ash<br><br>
exit through the bottom opening 26 of the first stage combustor 10. The molten slag is quenched in a water quench sluice system 28 and the ash is sluiced to a collection tank from where it is pumped to a settling pond, or otherwise disposed of according to conventional known methods.<br>
The staged combustor 10 has a partial oxidation zone where mixing at a temperature of about 2200° to 3000°F provides intimate contact between the coal and air. Through the use of a staged combustor 10 that has incorporated molten slag removal, a high percentage (75-90%) of the molten slag produced during partial oxidation of the coal is removed from the gas prior to. entry into the furnace 14, and prior to further partial oxidation at entry 12. The residence time in the first stage combustor, to minimize the production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and ammonia (NH3), which are NOx precursors at high temperatures under excess air conditions, should be in the range of at least about 0.1 seconds to 0.3 seconds. The hot fuel gas products leave the combustor 10 and pass via pipe 29 to the entry 12 into the boiler furnace 14. Secondary air is admitted through a entry which forms a second stage of partial oxidation 30 into the furnace to yield rapid mixing of fuel gas with air to create a hot flame zone where the production of*NOx is minimized due to the reducing condition in this zone (SR2 = 0.85 to 0.99). -The jet effect of the products of combustion is set within a certain velocity range to provide for recirculation of furnace flue 38 into the second stage jet stream. The velocity will vary depending on furnace geometry and number of furnace burners. With this flue gas recirculation effect, the preheated atmospheric air introduced in the second stage is reduced. The oxygen in the recirculated flue gases that are pulled down by the entrance velocity and flow orientation effects of the fuel gas from the first, second and third stage air from the upper part of the furnace, which is an oxidizing<br><br>
atmosphere, makes up the rest of the oxygen required to maintain the desired SR of or about 0.85 to 0.99.<br>
Gaseous fuel products from the second stage of partial oxidation 31, rise upward through the radiant section of the furnace 14 and are cooled by radiant and convective heat transfer to the furnace water-walls 36 to a temperature of 2300° to 2700°F, wherein the gases have been maintained in a reducing atmospheric condition for about 0.25 seconds to 0.50 seconds or greater. At this point, overfire air (OFA) is introduced into the furnace at inlet 32 forming a third stage combustion technique to complete the combustion process, air being added to bring the stoichiometric ratios in this zone to an excess air condition of about 1.05 to 1.30 (SR3). OF A injection may be accomplished through any commercially available design to provide for   . intimate and rapid mixing of the air with the furnace gases so as to provide complete combustion of the fuel components in the second stage gas stream.<br>
The second approach, as shown in Fig. 3b, is to introduce the tertiary and quaternary air through two concentric pipe annuluses 54, 56 that surround the inner fuel gas pipe 29, with one or both of these cylinders preferably containing internal adjustable angled baffles 58, 60, respectively, to provide for air swirl. Tertiary air is introduced through the annulus 54 of a concentric pipe 43 that surrounds the inner hot fuel gas pipe 29 exiting the first stage partial oxidation unit 10 and terminating in furnace entry 12. Quaternary air is added through the annulus 56 of a concentric pipe 64 that surrounds the tertiary air pipe 43. By changing the relative air flow rates and air swirl intensity between these two zones, the flame may be shaped to provide for a long flame that radiates energy away from it, providing for a cooler flame. If<br><br>
necessary, this type of second stage entry could be used effectively in the case when the overfire air system is not in use to provide for low NOx emissions, but it is known that it will generally not be as low as that when the OFA system is in service. The total air rate is controlled to bring the overall stoichiometric ratios in the second stage to 0.85 to 0.99 (SR2). If desired, steam or water may be added at this stage as well.<br>
In the third embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3 (c), tertiary air is introduced through one concentric pipe annulus 66 of a concentric pipe 68 that surrounds the inner hot fuel gas pipe 29 exiting the first stage partial oxidation unit 10 and terminating in furnace entry 12. The tertiary air is designed to provide air swirl 67. The total air rate is controlled to bring the overall SR in the second stage to a range of approximately 0.85 to 0.99 (SR2). The third stage combustion technique (overfire air) 32 is completed after the fuel gas 31 from the second stage has been cooled to a range of to 2300° to 2700°F.<br>
A One Dimensional Flame (ODF) kinetics model was used to evaluate the three-stage pulverized coal combustion technique. The ODF model treats the combustion system as a series of one-dimensional reactors. Each reactor may be perfectly mixed or unmixed. Each ODF    -reactor may also be assigned a variety of thermodynamic characteristics, including adiabatic, isothermal, or specified profiles of temperature or heat flux, and/or pressure. Further, process streams may be added over any interval of the plug flow reactor, with arbitrary mixing profiles along the reactor length. Input data include initial species concentrations and conditions, description of the conditions for each reactor, the chemical species and reaction mechanism including rate parameters, and model control parameters. A separate input file provides the<br><br>
thermodynamic property database for the chemical species. Output data include concentration profiles at specified locations along the reactor chain. The chemistry within each reactor is calculated using detailed reaction mechanisms based on data from experimental literature that was validated by comparison with experimental results. The solution of the detailed reaction mechanisms uses an implicit solution algorithm applicable to systems of many coupled equations. Specialized sub-models allow for the phenomena of pulverized coal combustion and gas-phase radiation. The ODF model has been validated against experimental data from several sources. It was therefore used to evaluate the three-stage combustion technique of the present invention.<br>
In the three stage combustion technique analyzed, a coal, sorbent (and optionally steam) mixture was introduced at the start of the first plug flow reactor at a stoichiometric ratio of about 0.60 (SRi) and a set initial temperature (2600°F to 3000°F). Plug flow, with an SR of 0;60 was used in the first stage to increase localized flame temperatures, under reducing conditions, to reduce the formation of the nitrogen oxide precursors - specifically, hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, see Fig. 2. After a residence time of about 0.20 seconds, the second stage starts with the addition of air, bringing the second stage stoichiometric ratio to about 0.88 to 0.96 (SR2). The residence time of the second stage was set at 0.5 sec, which is believed to be a reasonable time for electric utility boiler furnace applications. Second stage flame temperature and fuel gas/air mixing time had the most dramatic effects on final NOx emissions. The lower the second stage flame temperature, the lower the NOx produced. Lower NOx is produced with steam injection compared to no steam injection primarily due to lower flame temperatures. All other parameters being equal, with steam injection, the second stage flame temperature is reduced by<br><br>
60°F as compared to no steam injection. Therefore, cooling the fuel gas in the first stage vessel either with steam or with greater heat removal, prior to second stage firing, is seen to be beneficial in lowering NO* emissions. Based on identical firing temperatures, steam addition itself, at a rate of about 0.30 lb steam/lb coal lowered NOx emissions some 10%o, as compared to using three stages of combustion with no steam injection.<br>
In addition, the longer the residence time of fuel gas/air mixing in the second stage, the lower the localized flame temperatures and therefore the lower the final NOx emissions. The NOx reducing thermochemical equilibria of the second stage are shown in Fig. 3. After maintaining the second stage reducing condition for a time of 0.5 sec, overfire air (OFA) is added to bring the third stage stoichiometric ratio to about 1.14 (SR3) to provide for a 3.2% (dry) oxygen concentration. This zone was also set for a residence time of 0.5 sec. before entering the cooling (superheat/reheat) passes in the upper furnace. Since air is being added after.the second stage fuel gas has been cooled, the flame temperatures in the OFA combustion zone are low (2300° to 2700°F). As shown in Fig. 4, thermal NOx production is less favored at lower temperatures. For example, the equilibrium coefficient for the thermal NOx production reaction (N2 + 02 -&gt; 2 NO) at 2400°F is less than one-tenth of the equilibrium constant at 2700°F.<br>
A value of 0.07 seconds was assumed for the second stage and third stage mixing times based on experimental data. The stages were operated taking into consideration flame radiation and dissociation losses with heat extractions added to match the mass and energy balances developed. The flue gases, from the point of OFA injection until entering the furnace<br><br>
superheater/reheater areas, should have a residence time of at least about 0.25 seconds and more preferably 0.50 seconds or greater.<br>
Table 1 shows the projected overall NOx emissions for various second stage stoichiometric ratios (SR2) when operating with and without steam. As shown, by operating the second stage at stoichiometric ratios in the range of about 0.88 to 0.97, the three-stage combustion technique can yield NOx emissions of about 0.15 lb/million Btu and less. At the low stoichiometric ratios, NOx emissions as low as 0.067 to 0.088 lb/million Btu were projected. This data does not take into account the FGR phenomenon that will help to lower NOx even further..<br><br>
While stoker-fired, wall-fired and tangentially fired boilers would require the addition of a first-stage partial oxidation unit to implement the three-stage oxidation technique of the present invention, cyclone-fired boilers would not. As shown in Fig. 5, the existing combustor barrels on a cyclone-fired unit 70 could be modified to operate under the first stage partial oxidation conditions of the present invention. The difference between the conventional two-stage<br><br>
combustion systems and the cyclone-fired units 70 is that they fire pulverized coal and the cyclone-fired units1 fire ground coal 72 (typically -1/' in size).<br>
Recently, certain electric utilities have added overfire air 74 to their cyclone-fired units units so that the cyclone barrels 76 can be run under slightly reducing conditions (SR = 0.90 to 0.95). This resulted in NOx reductions of up to 60%. Cyclones fired units, operating under conventional excess air conditions in the barrels 76, are typically high NOx emitting units, usually in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 lb. NOX/106 Btu. To implement the three-stage technique to a cyclone unit fired boiler 70 that already has overfire air 74 capability, additional preheated air 78 would be added at the re-entrant throat location(s) 82 where the hot gases 91 from the barrel(s) 76 enter the main furnace. The first stage unit, the cyclone barrel 76, would then be operated under the stoichiometric ainfuel conditions described for conventional two stage combustion units (SR of about 0.50 to 0.70), adding preheated air 80 and 78 into the barrel through lines '87 (primary air), 88(secondary air) and 89 (tertiary air). Preheated air 78 would be added at the barrel re-entrant throat locations 82 to increase the SR to about 0.85 to 0.99 in the lower part 84 of the furnace. This second stage air could be introduced around the re-entrant throats 90 where the first stage fuel gas 91 from the barrels 76 enters the furnace, or above and/or below 83 the reentrant throat openings on the same furnace wall as the re-entrant throats or on the opposite or side walls of the furnace or combinations thereof.   The second stage air, no matter where located will be done so as to effect an in-situ furnace flue gas recirculation, as shown by direction arrows 93 and or 92. Overfire air 74 is added in the upper part 86 of the furnace to complete the combustion process, raising the SR at this point typically to about 1.10 to 1.20 to provide for adequate carbon burnout.<br><br>
The modifications required to implement the three stage technique to any existing cyclone-fired unit, would include the following: 1) boiler tubewall penetrations, air ducting and injectors to supply air for a second stage of combustion at the re-entrant throat location 82; 2) probable addition of limestone to decrease the molten ash viscosity (preferably a viscosity of about 10 poise) so that the slag will tap from the bottom of the furnace easily; 3) possible replacement of the existing refractory layer on the studded barrel waterwalls to a refractory that performs better under reducing atmospheric conditions; and 4) the addition of ducting and overfire air 74 injectors to supply air to the upper part 86 of the furnace (if not in place). For cyclone-fired units that are equipped with a flue gas recycle (FGR) system, wherein flue gas is injected into the furnace directly above the re-entrant throat locations, it may be possible to use the existing FGR ports for second stage air addition to eliminate the need for added tubewall penetrations.<br>
Further, the steam and/or water addition technique could be applied to these modified cyclone units, if required for low reactivity fuels such as low volatile bituminous coal, anthracite or petroleum coke, to increase carbon bumout. This is accomplished through the carbon-water reaction (C + H20 -&gt; CO + H2), which at high temperatures (e.g. 2600°F), has a rate of reaction similar to the carbon-oxygen reactions. Steam and/or water injection is a proven technique that has been practiced for decades in the coal gasification industry.<br>
