STACKED ORGANIC LIGHT EMITTING DEVICE HAVING HIGH EFFICIENCY<br>
AND HIGH BRIGHTNESS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a stacked organic light emitting device. More particularly, the present invention relates to a stacked organic light emitting device including a single-layered internal electrode aligned between stacked light emitting sections.<br>
Background Art<br>
An organic light emitting device is a semiconductor device for converting electric energy into optical energy. The organic light emitting device includes two opposite electrodes (an anode and a cathode) for applying external power to the organic: light emitting device and an organic material layer aligned between the anode and the cathode in order to emit light having a wavelength of the visible ray range when a hole is recombined with an electron. As a forward electric field is applied to the organic light emitting device having the above structure, holes and electrons generated from the anode and cathode are injected into the organic material layer so that the holes are combined with the electrons in the organic material layer, thereby generating excitons. When the excitons have become the ground state, light is generated. Recently, an organic material layer with a multi-layered structure (see, Applied Physics Letters, vol. 51, no. 12, pp. 913-915, 1987) has been suggested in order to allow the holes and electrons generated from the electrodes of the organic light emitting device to<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	PCT/KR2005/001001<br>
be effectively injected or transferred into the organic material layer. If the organic material layer is formed with the multi-layered structure, it is possible to drive the organic light emitting device with significantly reduced operational voltage while improving light emitting efficiency of the organic light emitting device.<br>
In the meantime, various attempts have been made to realize high brightness in organic light emitting devices. For instance, a method of increasing current density obtained by applying an electric field to the organic light emitting device has been suggested. However, since an organic material layer and a thin film structure of the organic light emitting device are weak against heat, higher current density may exert a bad influence upon the organic material layer and the thin film structure of the organic light emitting device, so that the stability of the organic light emitting device may be degraded as the current density increases. For this reason, current studies are focused on organic light emitting devices representing high,brightness at low current density.<br>
There are two approaches to obtain high brightness at low current density. The first approach is to use an organic material capable of improving generation efficiency of excitons, which are generated due to recombination of holes and electrons, and/or generation efficiency of photons, which are generated when the excitons have become the ground state. The second approach is to stack at least two organic light emitting device units in series, in which each organic light emitting device unit includes an anode, a cathode and a light emitting section having a light emitting layer capable of emitting light by receiving holes and electrons from the<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	PCT/KR2005/001001<br>
anode and the cathode, respectively. In the following description, a term "stacked organic light emitting device" refers to the structure including at least two organic light emitting device units stacked in series. The light emitting section may include an organic material layer having a multi-layered structure including a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transport layer, if necessary.<br>
Methods of fabricating the above-mentioned stacked organic light emitting devices have been disclosed in various documents.<br>
For instance, International Publication No. WO95/06400 discloses a stacked organic light emitting device including organic light emitting device units capable of emitting lights having different wavelengths such that light with desired colors can be emitted from the stacked organic light emitting device. According to the above stacked organic light emitting device, each organic light emitting device unit includes two electrodes and a light emitting layer aligned between two electrodes. In addition, the electrodes are connected to the external power source, respectively, in such a manner that the organic light emitting device units can be individually driven.<br>
In addition, International Publication No. WO99/03158 discloses a stacked organic light emitting device including organic light emitting device units capable of emitting lights having the same wavelength such that light with improved brightness can be emitted from the stacked organic light emitting device. The stacked organic light emitting device disclosed in International Publication No. WO99/03158<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	PCT/KR2005/001001<br>
has a structure similar to that of the stacked organic light emitting device disclosed in International Publication No. WO95/06400, except that the external power source is connected to both ends of the stacked organic light emitting device. That is, external electrodes of the stacked organic light emitting device are connected to the external power source and internal electrodes of the stacked organic light emitting device are disconnected from the external power source.<br>
According to the above-mentioned stacked organic light emitting devices, internal electrodes interposed between the organic light emitting device units include an internal anode in the form of a conductive thin film electrode made from indium-tin-oxide (ITO) or Au having a high work function, and an internal cathode in the form of a metal thin film electrode made from Al (4.28 eV), Ag (4.26 eV), or Ca (2.87 eV} . Thus, two-layered internal electrodes, - that is, the internal anode and the internal cathode are aligned between the organic light emitting device units of - the stacked organic light emitting device while making contact with each other. FIG. 1 shows such a stacked organic light emitting device including two-layered internal electrodes between the organic light emitting device units.<br>
However, according to the stacked organic light emitting device having the structure as shown in FIG. 1, since an ITO-based transparent oxide electrode (internal anode) is formed on a metal thin film (internal cathode), to which electrons are injected, a physical bonding property between the internal anode and the internal cathode is degraded, so the two-layered internal electrodes cannot be effectively formed.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	PCT/KR2005/001001<br>
In addition, if the internal anode is made from ITO, a sputtering process must be carried out due to the characteristics of the ITO. However, such a sputtering process may increase kinetic energy of atoms (
In the meantime, European Patent Publication No. 1351558 Al discloses a stacked organic light emitting device including a single-layered internal electrode made from a single non-conductor thin film having specific resistance<br>
above 105 ?cm without forming two-layered internal electrodes between stacked light emitting sections. The single non-conductor thin film is made from a material capable of simultaneously generating holes. and electrons as an electric field is applied to the stacked organic light emitting device in such a manner that the holes and electrons are injected into a hole transport layer and an electron transport layer, respectively. However, the single non-conductor thin film is very expensive and a method of forming the single non-conductor thin film is very difficult.<br>
Accordingly, it is necessary to provide a stacked organic light emitting device, which can be easily fabricated without forming two-layered internal electrodes between stacked light emitting sections.<br>

In addition, "HOMO" is an abbreviation of "the highest occupied molecular orbital" and "LUMO" is an abbreviation of "the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital".<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail.<br>
In a conventional stacked organic light emitting device,<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	PCT/KR2005/001001"<br>
two-layered internal electrodes including an internal anode and an internal cathode, which make contact with each other, are formed between the stacked light emitting sections. In such a conventional stacked organic light emitting device, a material having a relatively high work function is used for the internal anode for the purpose of hole injection and a material having a relatively low work function is used for the internal cathode for the purpose of electron injection.<br>
However, inventors of the present invention have found that, if an organic material layer containing an organic material having an electron affinity above 4 eV is formed in the light emitting section between the light emitting layer of the light emitting section and the electrode facing the external anode in two electrodes which make contact with the light emitting section, it is possible to fabricate the internal electrode by using a single-layered internal electrode made from one selected from the group consisting of a metal, alloys of the metal, and metal oxides thereof, having a work function below 4.5 eV.<br>
Hereinafter, an operational principle of the present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
In the present invention, a term "electron affinity" means a difference between a vacuum level and a LUMO energy level. The LUMO energy level can be calculated by adding an optical band gap to a HOMO energy level, wherein the HOMO energy level can be obtained by measuring ionization potential.<br>
If an organic material layer containing an organic material having the electron affinity above A eV is formed in the light emitting section between the light emitting layer<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	PCTYKR2005/00I001<br>
of the light emitting section and the electrode facing the external anode in two electrodes which make contact with the light emitting section, there is no great difference between the LUMO energy level of the organic material layer and the HOMO energy level of the hole transport layer or the light emitting layer in the light emitting section to which the organic material layer is adjacent {the HOMO energy level of the existing hole transport layer is set to 5.0-6.0 eV) . In addition, if the organic material layer has the electron affinity above 4 eV, electrons in the HOMO energy level of the hole transport layer or the light emitting layer can be easily transferred to the organic material layer. At this time, if the electrons in the HOMO energy level of the hole transport layer or the light emitting layer are emitted, holes are generated at the very electron emitted site, i.e., in the HOMO energy level of the hole transport layer or the light emitting layer. The holes in the HOMO energy level may move to the light emitting layer through . the HOMO energy level, if necessary. Accordingly, when the organic material layer is formed ,with an organic material having the electron affinity above 4 eV, the organic material layer may act as an anode and/or a hole injection layer. In addition, the electrons shifted into the LUMO energy level of the organic material layer having the electron affinity - above 4 eV can move between molecules and have an electric conductive characteristic, so that the electrons may move toward an electrode facing the external anode due to an electric potential between the external anode and the external cathode connected to the external power source.<br>
The reason for setting the electron affinity above 4 eV<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	PCT/KR2005/001001<br>
is to receive electrons from the hole transport layer or the light emitting layer positioned adjacent to the organic material layer having the electron affinity above 4 eV while injecting holes into the hole transport layer or the light emitting layer and to easily inject electrons into a metal internal electrode.<br>
Preferably, the organic material having a high electron affinity above 4 eV ensures high carrier mobility. In this case, threshold voltage and driving voltage of the device can be lowered.<br>
According to the operational principle as mentioned above, the organic material layer having the electron affinity above 4 eV, which is formed between the light emitting layer of the light emitting section and the electrode facing the external anode in two electrodes which make contact with the light emitting section, can act as an anode. Therefore, according to the stacked organic light emitting device of the present invention, it is possible to form a single-layered internal electrode by using a metal, alloys of the metal, or metal oxides thereof, having a work function below 4.5 eV, which are known as materials for the cathode of the organic light emitting device used for injecting electrons into the organic material layer of the organic light emitting device when external power is applied thereto, without forming a separate internal anode between the light emitting sections of the stacked organic light emitting device.<br>
An example of the organic material having the electron affinity above 4 eV is shown in chemical formula 1.<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	PCT/KR2005/001001<br><br>
In above chemical formula 1, R1 to R6 are one selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen atom, nitrile (-CN) , nitro (-NO2), sulfonyl (-SO2R), sulfoxide (-SOR)', sulfonamide (-SO2NR2) , sulfonate (-SO3R), trifluoromethyl (-CF3), ester(-COOR), amide (-CONHR or - CONRR' ), substituted or unsubstituted linear or branched C1-C12 alkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted linear or branched C1-C12 alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aromatic or non-aromatic heterocyclic compound, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted . or unsubstituted mono-arylamine or de-arylamine, and substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl. In addition, R and R' are one selected from the group consisting of ' substituted or unsubstituted C1-C60 alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, and substituted or unsubstituted 5-7 membered heterocyclic compound.<br>
C1-C60 alkyl, aryl and heterocyclic compound of R and R' can be substituted with at least one functional group, which is one selected from the group consisting of arnine, amide, ether, and ester radicals-<br>
In addition, aryl is one selected from the group consisting of phenyl, biphenyl, terphenyl, benzyl, naphthyl,<br>

anthracenyl, tetracenyl, pentacenyl, perylenyl, and coronenyl, which can be mono-substituted, poly-substituted or unsubstituted.<br>
If an electron withdrawing functional group (hydrogen, halogen atom, nitrile (-CN), nitro (-NO2) , sulfonyl (-SO2R), sulfoxide (-SOR), sulfonamide (-SO2NR2), sulfonate (-SO3R), trifluoromethyl (-CF3), ester (-COOR), amide (-CONHR or -CONRR' ) is applied to R1 to R6, the electrons introduced into Tc-orbital of a core structure shown in chemical formula 1 are withdrawn by means of the electron withdrawing function group so that the electrons are stabilized, i.e., re-localized, thereby leveling up the electron affinity, that is, a LUMO level may drop down.<br>
According to the present invention, it is preferred to use -CN for R1 to R6.<br>
Examples and synthesis methods for above chemical formula 1 are disclosed in Korean Patent Application No. 10-2003-87159 in detail, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Another example of the organic material having the<br>
electron affinity above 4 eV includes 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-<br>
7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ, LUMO energy level =<br>
5.24	eV),	fluoride	3,4,9,10-<br>
perylenetetracarboxylicdianhydride (PTCDA), cyano PTCDA, naphthalenetetracarboxylicdianhydride (NTCDA), fluoride NTCDA and cyano NTCDA.<br>
According to the present invention, the single-layered internal electrode is made from one selected from the group consisting of a metal having a work function below 4.5 eV, preferably below 4.3 eV, more preferably in a range of 3.5 eV<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	PCT/KR200S/001001<br>
to 4.3 eV, alloys of the metal, and metal oxides thereof. Since the single-layered internal electrode can be made from materials having a low work function, electrons are effective injected if the single-layered internal electrode is used as a cathode for the organic light emitting device.<br>
In addition, since the metal having the work function below 4.5 eV used for the internal electrode can be melted by means of heat, the internal electrode can be formed through a thermal evaporation process instead of a sputtering process. Thus, the stacked organic light emitting device can be prevented from being damaged and a process cost can be reduced. However, all metal alloy or metal oxide having the work function below 4.5 eV is not adaptable to the thermal evaporation process. If the metal alloy or metal oxide has a high melting point, an e-beam evaporation process or , a sputtering process is carried out.<br>
The metal used for fabricating the single-layered internal electrode includes Al (4.28 eV), Ag (4.26 eV), Zn (4.33 eV), Nb (4.3 eV), Zr (4.05 eVJ, Sn (4.42 eV), Ta (4.25 eV), V (4.3 eV), Hg (4.49 eV), Ga (4.2 eV), In (4.12 eV), Cd (4.22 eV), B (4.4 eV), Hf (3.9 eV&gt;, La (3.5 eV), Ti (4.3 eV), a Nd or Pd alloy thereof, Ca (2.87 eV), Mg (3.66 eV), Li (2.9eV), Na 
The thickness of the single-layered internal electrode can be adjusted by taking transmittance of light having a wavelength of a visible ray range and electric conductivity<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	PCT/KR2005/001001<br>
into consideration. In detail, the single-layered internal electrode must represent superior transmittance for the light in the visible ray range in order to allow the light generated from the light emitting device to be easily emitted to an exterior. To this end, it is preferred for the internal electrode to have a thin thickness as possible. However, a thin film made from a metal may represent low electric conductivity even if the metal has superior electric conductivity. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the thickness of the' internal'electrode in such a manner that the internal electrode has superior electric conductivity while representing superior transmittance for the light. According to the present &gt; invention, the thickness of the internal electrode is preferably adjusted in a range of about 1 to 100A.<br>
According to the present invention, if the light. emitting section aligned adjacent to the external anode includes the organic material layer containing the organic material having the electron affinity above 4 eV between the light emitting layer of the light emitting section and the external anode, the external anode can be fabricated by using a material having a relatively low work function as used for the internal electrode, as well as a material having a relatively high work function used for the anode of the conventional organic light emitting device. Therefore, the external anode can be fabricated not only using materials used for the internal electrode, but also using a metal having a high work function, such as V, Cr, Cu, Zn, Au or an alloy thereof, metal oxides, such as Zn oxide, In oxide, ITO (indium-tin-oxide) or In-Zn oxide, a combination of a metal<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	PCT/KR2005/001001<br>
and oxide, such as ZnO:Al or SnO2:Sb, and conductive polymer, such as poly{3-methylthiophene), poly[3,4-(ethylene-1,2-dioxy)thiophene] (PEDT), polypyrrole, or polyaniline. However/ the present invention is not limited to the above materials.<br>
According to the present invention, the external cathode can be fabricated by using a material having a relatively low work function in such a manner that electrons can be easily injected into the organic material layer. In detail, the external cathode can be fabricated not only using materials used for the internal electrode, but also using a metal, such as Mg, Ca, Na, Yt, Li, Gd, Pb or an alloy thereof, and a multi-layered material, such as LiF/Al or LiO2/Al. However, the present invention is not limited to the above materials.-¦<br>
The stacked organic light emitting device according to one embodiment of the present invention can be fabricated through the following processes. The structure of the stacked organic light emitting device fabricated according to one embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 2, an anode 3 made from one of the above-mentioned anode materials is formed on a transparent glass substrate 2. Then, a first light emitting section 4 including a light emitting layer is formed on the anode 3. The light emitting section 4 can be fabricated with a multi-layered structure or a single-layered structure. The multi-layered structure may include a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transport layer. According to the present invention, the light emitting section includes an organic material layer containing an organic material having an electron affinity<br>

above 4 eV formed between the light emitting layer of the light emitting section and the electrode facing the external anode in two electrodes which make contact with the light emitting section. As mentioned above, the organic material layer containing the organic material having the electron affinity above 4 eV plays a role of a hole injection layer or a hole transport layer. In addition, the organic material layer can be used for the purpose of hole injection and hole transportation. Then, an internal electrode 5 having a thickness in a range of about a few A to tens of A is formed on the light emitting section 4 by using one of the above-mentioned materials. In addition, a second light emitting section 6 is formed on the internal electrode in the same manner as the first light emitting section 4. At this time, the internal electrode and the light emitting sections can be repeatedly formed by several times, if necessary. Finally, a cathode 7 is formed on the second light emitting section 6 by using one of one of the above-mentioned cathode materials. Herein, the electrode and the light emitting section including an organic material layer can be formed through a conventional technology generally known in the art.<br>
The stacked light emitting sections are formed in the same structure by using the same material. However,, it is also possible to form the stacked light emitting sections in different structures or by using different materials.<br>
The stacked organic light emitting device of the present invention can be fabricated in the form of a top emission type organic light emitting device, a bottom emission type organic light emitting device, or a dual emission type organic light emitting device according to materials used for<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	-	PCT/KR2005/001001<br>
the stacked organic light emitting device.<br>
In addition, a display apparatus including the stacked organic light emitting device of the present invention can be fabricated through a conventional method generally known in the art.<br>
Since the organic light emitting device units are connected to each other in series in the stacked organic light emitting device of the present invention, density of photons generated from the light emitting layer of each light emitting section may increase under the same current density, so that emission efficiency and brightness of light can be improved proportionally to the number of stacked light emitting sections.<br>
In addition, according to the stacked organic light emitting device of the present invention, the light emitting section is fabricated in such a manner that it has a light emission spectrum of. a color selected from' red, green, blue, and a combination thereof. Thus, a light emitting device capable of emitting light having a white color or a desired color can be obtained by stacking the light emitting sections.<br>
In the meantime, if the thickness of the light emitting section provided in the stacked organic light emitting device according to the present invention is properly adjusted, at least two overlapped optical peaks can be generated due to micro-cavity effect, so that a white light of a wide range can be produced, although it does not precisely match with the white light defined' in a CRI (color rendition index). That, ,is, if an internal, electrode having a ¦ high reflective property is used, some of light generated from the light<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/075822	PCT/KR2005/001001<br>
emitting section is reflected from the internal electrode without being emitted to the exterior, thereby causing light interference in the stacked organic light emitting device. In this state, if the thickness of the organic material layer provided in the light emitting section is properly adjusted, a light emitting spectrum is changed, which is called "micro-cavity effect".<br>
In addition, since the present invention employs a single-layered internal electrode, the problem occurring in the conventional stacked organic light emitting device in relation to two-layered internal electrodes, such as poor physical bonding force between internal electrodes, may not happen. Conventionally, the organic light emitting device is easily damaged when fabricating the internal anode through the sputtering process. However, the single-layered internal electrode of the present invention can be made from a material adaptable for the evaporation process, so the stacked organic light emitting device of the present invention can be prevented from being damaged, thereby improving stability of the stacked organic light emitting device. In addition, since the present invention employs the single-layered internal electrode, the present invention represents advantages in view of the manufacturing cost and manufacturing process as1 compared with the conventional art employing two-layered internal electrodes, which must be bonded to each other.<br>
. Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail. It should be noted that the following embodiments are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

Embodiments<br>
Reference Example 1: HOMO and LUMO levels of HAT (USP and UV-VIS absorption schemes)<br>
In order to detect the HOMO level of Hexanitrile hexaazatriphenylene (HAT)r a UPS (Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy) scheme was used. According to the UPS scheme, kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from a sample was analyzed while radiating vacuum UV line (21.20 eV) generated from a helium lamp onto the sample under an ultra high vacuum state (
In' the reference example 1, after obtaining the work function of gold1 by using a gold film, the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from a HAT film was analyzed while depositing the HAT film on the gold film, in order to obtain the HOMO level of the HAT. FIG. 4 shows UPS data generated from the gold film and the HAT film formed on the gold film<br>

with a thickness of about 20nm. Hereinafter, the description will be made with reference to terminology disclosed in a document (H. Ishii, et al. Advanced Materials, IX, 605-625 (1999)). Binding energy shown in an x-axis of FIG. 7 was calculated based on the work function measured from the metal film. That is, the work function of gold in reference example<br>
1 can be obtained by subtracting a maximum value (15.92 eV)<br>
i<br>
of the binding energy from vacuum LJV line (21.20 eV) . According to reference example 1, the work function of gold was 5.28 eV. In addition, the HOMO level of the HAT can be obtained by subtracting a difference value between the maximum value (15.19 eV) and the minimum value (3.79) of the binding energy from the vacuum UV line (21.20 eV) radiated on the HAT deposited on the gold film. According to reference example 1, the HOMO' level of the HAT was 9.80 eV and the Fermi level was 6.02 eV.<br>
An UV-VTS spectrum as shown in FIG. 5 was obtained by using an organic material formed by depositing the HAT on a surface of glass, in addition, a band gap of 3.26. eV was obtained by analyzing an absorption edge. Thus, it is understood that the LUMO of the HAT is below 6.54 eV. The above value may vary according to exciton binding energy of the HAT film. That is, since 6.54 eV is larger than the Fermi level. (6.02 eV) of the HAT film, the exciton binding energy of the HAT film must exceed 0.52 eV in order, to set the LUMO level lower than the Fermi level. In general, the exciton binding energy of the organic material is 0.52 eV (maximum<br>
value thereof is lower than 1 eV), so the LUMO level of the<br>
i<br>
HAT is in the range of 5.54 to 6.02 eV.<br>
