TEST EXAMPLE 2<br>
Therapeutic Hfficacy on Experimental Tinea Pedis in Guinea Pigs with Compound (A):<br>
Male Hartley guinea pigs (Japan SLC Inc.) weighing 400 to 620 g wer ; used for the infection study. One side of a paper disc (i .5 mm thick x 8 mm diameter) was covered with a piece of aluminum !:oi 1 while the other side was free to carry the inoculum suspension. The disc was immersed with 50 ul of the inoculum suspension (trichophyton mentagrophytes TIMM 2789, lx.1.08 con id i a-'m.1 ), and was then fixed on the planta pedis of animal feet with an adhesive elastic tape. The disc was removed on the seventh day postinfection. Each agent dissolved in PEG 400 (0 . ] mJ/Locus) was topically applied to the whole soles of guinea pigs once a day for 3 consecutive days, starting on the 10th day postinfection. Five days after the last treatment;, the skin tissue from each planta pedis and the corresponding tarsus of all animals was cut into small blocks (about 2 &gt; 2 ;nm) . Ten skin bJocks obtained from each part ofthe foot, were implanted on a Sabouraud' s glucose agar plate containing antibiotics, and were cultured at 27°C for 14 days. The skin blocks yielding fungal growth were regarded as culture-positive, and the foot, (planta pedis plus tarsus) with more than one culture-positive skin block was considered f ungus-pos.) t : ve In addition, the intensity of infection was assessed by !he scores' based on the number of culture-positive skin blocks. Namely, -MO, + 9, +8, + 7, +6, +5, +4, +3, +2, +1 or 0 was given as the score according to the corresponding number of culture-positive skin blocks out of ten skin blocks studied. Statistical analyses for the rate of fungus-positive feet and th«&gt; average intensity of infection were assessed by Fisher's exact probably test and Mann-Whitney's U-test, respectively ' results are shown in Table 2.TABLE 2<br>
(formula Removed) (Notes) A: p-.O.Ol vs untreated control group<br>
B: p
C: p'O.OS vs 1% Racemic Compound (A) treated group<br>
The ; unquii-positlve rate of the untreated group was 100% and f'unqi. were detected from all of the infected feet. In terms of the average intensity of infection, a high value of t7.7 was obtained in the planta pedis, but it was +5.4 in the tarsus. Thus, this shows a tendency that the degree of infection in the tarsus was lower than in the planta pedis. Nearly the same results were obtained in the PEG 400 treated group and the curative effect by the solvent was not recognjzed. The 1% Racemic Compound (A) treated group showed a significant curative effect as compared with the untreated group and ! he LM-iG 400 treated group, but the fungus-positive<br>
ra*te was 40% and the average intensity of infection of the planta pedis and the tarsus was +0.6 and +0.2, respectively, and fungi were detected from four feet among the inoculated ten feet. In the 0,5% Compound (A) treated group, the fungus-positive rate was 20%, which shows that the effect of Compound (A) was twice that, of 1% Racemic Compound (A) , and in the 1% Compound (A) treated group, the remarkable effect that all of the infected feet were cure fungus-negative was obtained, namely, rnyco.iog.icaL.ly complete healing was attained.<br>
As a result: of the comparison between Compound (A) and Racemi.c Compound (i\), it became clear that Compound (A) showed a curative effect, markedly higher than Racemic Compound (A) at the same concentration and that when 0.5% Compound (A) and 1% Racemic Compound (A) which were the same in concentration in terms of active ingredient (A.I.) which was Compound (A) were compared, Compound (A) showed the higher effect more than twice that of 1% Raconuc Compound (A) . Considering MIC for T. mentagrophytes TIMM 2789 used for the test, it is clear that Compound (A) had in vitro antifungal activity of 4 times that of Racemic Compound (A) , and this difference in antifungal action was reflected a.) so in the curative test for the .infection model in vivo.<br>
TEST EXAMPLE 3 In vitro ant:; fungal activity against Candida albicans:<br>
MICs were determined by the twofold micro-broth dilution method with RPMI L640 buffered with morphorino-propanesulf onic acid to a final molarity of 0.165 M (pH 7.0). One hundred µl of a yeast cell suspension (1 to 5xl03 cells/ml) and 100 ul of the compound-containing medium were pipetted into each well flat-bottomed microtiter plates. After incubation for 48 hours at Hf.°C, the turbidity of each well was measured at 630 nm. The MIC was determined as the lowest drug concentraLion which showed 80% inhibition of a control fungal growth (as measured i.n turbidity-increase). The results are shown i.n Tab: e .-. ,TABLE 3<br>

(formula Removed) (Note )  FCZ:  2- ( 2 ( 4-Difluorophenyl)-1 , 3-bis(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1 yl)-2-propanol (general name: fluconazole)<br>
TEST EXAMPLE 4<br>
In vitro anlifungal activity of Compound (B) against Aspergi11 us fumigatus:<br>
MICs were determined by the twofold agar dilution method with ras.i tone agar which constituted with 0.9% bacto-casitone, 1% oaoto -yeas t extract, 2% glucose, 0.1% KH7PO/,, 0.1% Na2HPO,,, 1. % Na3C6.H6O1 and 1.6% agar. A loopful of each inoculum (1xlO6 conidj a/ml. ) was streaked onto the agar plate containing a compound, and a fungal growth was observed after incubation for 48 hours at 35°C. The MIC was determined as the lowest<br>
drug concentration which prevented a visible fungal growth. The results are shown in Table 4.<br>
