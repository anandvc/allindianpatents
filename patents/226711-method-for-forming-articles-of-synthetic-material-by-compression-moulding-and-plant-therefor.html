				<td>METHOD FOR FORMING ARTICLES OF SYNTHETIC MATERIAL BY<br>
COMPRESSION MOULDING, AND PLANT THEREFOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a method and the relative plant for forming articles of<br>
synthetic material by compression moulding. It relates in particular to the forming<br>
of large-thickness articles or alternatively articles comprising at least two different<br>
materials which may have different technical characteristics.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Plants based on injection moulding technology are known enabling articles to be<br>
formed comprising at least two material portions of different characteristics. The<br>
most recent type of injection moulding plants, namely the horizontal turntable<br>
type, comprises two opposing dies provided with cavities, and at least one punch<br>
to be inserted in succession into the cavities of each of the two dies to define two<br>
different product forming chambers, into which the materials are fed.<br>
Although the said plants perform the functions for which they are proposed, they<br>
present the intrinsic limits of injection moulding. The object of this invention is to<br>
obtain a product of large thickness and/or composed of portions of different<br>
materials by compression moulding.<br>
The document JP 7 276394 discloses a method for forming a cap comprising a<br>
liner which comprises the following features.<br>
A liner 62 is formed by compression moulding into a first mould 48 (Fig. 2), and<br>
remains attached to a first punch 52, later on it is discharged onto a disc 22 (Fig.<br>
5), where it is collected by a second punch 74, the punch 74 with the liner enters<br>
into a second mould cavity 72 in which a second quantity 87 of material is<br>
contained to be press moulded in a cap.<br>
The method of JP 7 216394 is very complicated to be carried out and needs a<br>
very expensive apparatus<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention attains said object by providing a method for forming<br>
articles of synthetic material by compression moulding, comprising inserting a<br>
punch into the forming cavity of a mould to define a forming chamber having the<br>
shape of the article, said method comprising at least the following operative<br>
stages:<br>
a)	inserting a first measured quantity of synthetic material in the plastic state into<br>
the forming cavity of the mould,<br>
b)	inserting the punch into the cavity to define a first forming chamber and<br>
pressing said measured quantity to obtain a first inner portion of the article, said<br>
method comprising the additional steps of:<br>
c)	opening the mould by withdrawing the punch and feeding a second measured<br>
quantity into said forming cavity,<br>
d)	closing the mould by repositioning the punch in said forming cavity to define a<br>
second forming chamber, and pressing said second measured quantity,<br>
e)	again opening the mould, by withdrawing the punch and extracting said article.<br>
According to the method of the invention, the number of measured quantities fed<br>
in succession into the cavity, and hence the number of pressings executed to<br>
obtain the final product, vary according to the type of product. Hence stages c),<br>
d), e) can be repeated a number of times equal to the number of constituent<br>
portions of the product to be obtained.<br><br>
This method is preferably implemented by a forming plant comprising a<br>
rotary turntable for compression moulding composed of a support element<br>
which rotates about a central vertical axis.<br>
A plurality of compression moulding units are mounted on the support<br>
element equidistant from each other and from the axis of said turntable.<br>
Each of said units comprises an upper punch with which there is<br>
associated at least one tower die provided with a cavity into which the<br>
measured quantity or pellet of synthetic material to be pressed is<br>
deposited.<br>
Said at least one punch and at least one die mutually cooperate to define<br>
the various forming chambers.<br>
Means are provided for driving said support elements such that each unit<br>
undergoes a path comprising a first pellet loading region, a first moulding<br>
region, a first cooling region, a second loading region, a second moulding<br>
region, a second cooling region and a discharge region for the moulded<br>
article.<br>
Means are provided for moving said punches and said cavities relative to<br>
each other during the rotation of the support element.<br>
In a first embodiment of the invention, each of said units comprises one<br>
punch and one die, of variable geometry, and means for varying the<br>
relative position of said punch and said die in order to define a number of<br>
forming chambers based on the number of constituent portions of the final<br>
product.<br>
In a different embodiment of the invention, each of said units comprises at<br>
least one punch and a number of dies equal to the number of constituent<br><br>
portions of the final product. In this case means are provided for<br>
associating the punch with the connect die at any given time.<br>
Specifically, in this embodiment said means for associating the punch with<br>
the correct die at any given time comprise a die support shaft which can<br>
rotate about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the<br>
turntable. According to a first variant, said means comprise a die support<br>
slide which can translate in a direction radial to the axis of rotation of said<br>
turntable.<br>
Finally in a further variant said means comprise a die support plate which<br>
can rotate about an axis parallel to the turntable axis.<br>
From the description it is apparent that by virtue of the method and plant<br>
of the invention, products comprising portions of materials which differ<br>
from each other by at least one characteristic can be advantageously<br>
formed by compression moulding.<br>
Moreover by virtue of the method of the invention, large-thickness<br>
products of synthetic material can be formed by double pressing identical<br>
materials. In this case the advantage consists in a decrease in the time<br>
required to cool the product, and hence the total product production time.<br>
In this respect the cooling time varies with the square of the product<br>
thickness, hence for the same final product thickness, if the product is<br>
formed by double pressing, the time required to cool the product is one<br>
half of the time required to cool the same product of the same thickness<br>
obtained by a single pressing.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, a rotary turntable is not used, said<br>
forming units being disposed in line.<br><br>
Moreover according to the invention, each of said forming units can comprise a<br>
plurality of punches and a single die, means being provided to move each punch<br>
in succession in front of said die.<br>

Figure 38 is the view in the direction XXXVIII of Figure 37.<br>
Figure 1 shows the compression moulding plant 1 comprising a turntable 2,<br>
which can be rotated by known means, and supports a plurality of<br><br>
identical forming units 3 disposed equidistant along a circumference at the<br>
edge of said turntable 2.<br>
The pellet or measured quantity 100 (Figure 4) is fed to each forming unit<br>
3 by two known extruders 5' and 5" positioned tangentially to the turntable<br>
2 in correspondence with said forming units 3.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment a known device 6 for removing the formed<br>
article is present at the extruder 5'.<br>
Figures from 3 to 17 show a first embodiment of the individual forming<br>
units 3 installed on the turntable 2. Said units 3 are arranged to form by<br>
compression moulding a cap 7 provided internally with a disc 8 or liner<br>
shown in Figure 2.<br>
Each of said units 3 comprises an upper male half-mould 9, shown in<br>
Figure 3, and a lower female half-mould 10, shown in Figure 4.<br>
From Figure 3 it can be seen that the upper male half-mould 9 comprises<br>
an internally hollow socket-shaped body 11, the base 110 of which<br>
constitutes a portion of the upper pressing punch.<br>
On the outer surface of the socket-shaped body 11 there is an annular<br>
shoulder 111 on which there rests a corresponding annular shoulder 112<br>
present on the inner surface of a tube 12 mounted on the socket-shaped<br>
body 11. The lower outer surface of the tube, together with the base 110<br>
of the socket-shaped body 11, forms the base of the upper pressing<br>
punch.<br>
The socket-shaped body 11 is screwed at its top onto a tubular stem 13,<br>
which in proximity to its upper end is associated with an outer ring 14<br>
resting on the upper end of a spacer 15, which rests on a bush 16<br>
mounted on the outside of the stem 13, and rigid with the turntable 2.<br><br>
On the outside of the spacer 15 a first compression spring 17 is positioned<br>
between the ring 14 and the bush 16.<br>
The bush 16 lowerly presents an annular shoulder 160 on which there<br>
rests the end of a second compression spring 18, the other end of which<br>
rests on an annular shoulder 120 of the tube 12.<br>
A centering and extraction ring 19 is mounted on the tube 12 and can<br>
translate vertically, being driven by a linear actuator 20 which is connected<br>
to said centering ring 19 by a fork member 21. The linear actuator is<br>
operated by a cam rigid with the turntable 2, but not shown.<br>
The centering and extraction ring 19 is partially received in the interior of a<br>
collar 22 by way of interposed usual sealing slide means 221 positioned<br>
both between the centering ring 19 and the collar 22, and between the<br>
centering ring 19 and the tube 12.<br>
The collar 22 is locked in a hole in the turntable 2, and presents internally<br>
a shoulder 220 on which a cup-shaped element 23 rests to receive the<br>
lower end of a third spring 24, the upper end of which rests against the<br>
lower surface of the bush 16.<br>
The upper half-mould is also provided with a usual cooling system<br>
comprising a cooling fluid circulation conduit 25 which passes though the<br>
tubular stem 13 and opens into the socket-shaped body 11, it being<br>
connected to usual means, not shown, for feeding the cooling fluid.<br>
The bush 16 also presents a plurality of suction conduits 16, the mouths of<br>
which open in proximity to its lower and upper edges, they being<br>
connected to suction means and/or delivery means for a pressurized fluid,<br>
the function of which is clarified hereinafter.<br><br>
The female tower half-mould 10 comprises a die 29 consisting of a<br>
cylindrical block 31 and a tubular body 33 mounted about said block.<br>
The forming cavity is defined by the inner surface of the body 33, which<br>
presents two shoulders 330 and 331 (Figure 4), and the upper surface of<br>
the cylindrical block 31.<br>
The die 29 is supported by a cup 30 which can translate vertically, being<br>
associated with usual hydraulic drive means. The cup 30 is provided with<br>
two concentric annular recesses 300 and 301. The annular recess 301<br>
receives the cylindrical block 31, the upper surface of which represents<br>
the base of the forming cavity.<br>
The annular recess 300 receives a ring 32 having the double function of<br>
locking the cylindrical block 31 within the recess 301, and supporting said<br>
body 33 via a spring 43 positioned between said ring and an annular<br>
enlargement 332 of the body 33.<br>
The body 33 is inserted into a sleeve 35, against the upper edge of which<br>
there rests the annular enlargement 332 of the body 33, and with the<br>
lower edge of which there is associated a ring nut 36 which rigidly fixes it<br>
to the cup 30.<br>
A cooling device, not shown because of known type, is also associated<br>
with the lower half-mould 10.<br>
The operation of the first embodiment of the invention is explained with<br>
the aid of Figures from 5 to 17 which illustrate the various operative<br>
stages thereof.<br>
The two half-moulds 9 and 10 must firstly be withdrawn from each other to<br>
insert a measured quantity 100 of synthetic material into the cavity of the<br>
die 29. The lower half-mould is then made to rise into the position shown<br><br>
in Figures 5 and 12, where it can be seen that the lower edge of the tube<br>
12 rests against the annular shoulder 331 of the body 33 to define,<br>
together with the base 110 of the socket-shaped body 11 and the upper<br>
surface of the block 31, the first forming chamber 200.<br>
At the same time the lower edge of the centering and extraction ring 19 is<br>
partly inserted into the body 33 and rests against the annular shoulder<br>
330.<br>
At this point using drive means, not shown, the cup 30 and hence the<br>
cylindrical block 31 are translated vertically against the action of the<br>
springs 18 and 34, as shown in Figures 6 and 13. The translating cup<br>
compresses the measured quantity which becomes distributed within the<br>
forming chamber to create the disc 8. The incompressibility of the plastic<br>
material causes the cup to halt in the final first pressing position shown in<br>
Figure 6.<br>
When the plastic material has attained a suitable solidification point by<br>
virtue of the cooling induced by the cooling devices with which the mould<br>
is provided, the mould is opened to insert a second measured quantity of<br>
plastic material into the cavity of the die 29.<br>
It should be noted that before opening the mould to insert the second<br>
measured quantity 201, the means 26 are activated to create a vacuum in<br>
the interior of the upper half-mould 9. These means create a vacuum<br>
which acts on the liner 8 to retain it against the base 10 of the socket-<br>
shaped body 11, to prevent the liner separating from the base 110 during<br>
the mould opening.<br>
When the second measured quantity 201 has been inserted the mould is<br>
closed as shown in Figures 7 and 14. From Figure 14 it can be seen that<br><br>
the linear actuator 20 lowers the centering and extraction ring 19, to bring<br>
its lower edge to the same level as the lower edge of the tube 12, hence<br>
defining a second forming chamber.<br>
At this point the cup 30 is made to rise vertically, to move the centering<br>
and extraction ring 19 upwards until the lower edge of the tube 12 rests<br>
against the shoulder 331 of the body 33, as shown in detail in Figure 15.<br>
As shown in Figures 9 and 16, the movement of the cup 30 then causes<br>
lowering of the socket-shaped body 11 and of the tube 12 against the<br>
action of the spring 18. During this stage the material becomes distributed<br>
within the undercut which forms between the lower edge of the liner 8 and<br>
the lower edge of the tube 12, to form a retention ring 202 for the liner. In<br>
this position the centering ring 19 rests against the cup element 23 (Figure<br>
9) and tends to raise it against the action of the spring 24.<br>
The upward thrust of the cup 30 then causes the centering ring 19 to<br>
further rise against the force exerted by the spring 24, as shown in Figure<br>
10, and at the same time the material becomes all distributed within the<br>
forming chamber to create the cap 7.<br>
When the cap 7 has been formed, the mould is opened and the linear<br>
actuator lowered so that the socket-shaped ring presses against the edge<br>
of the cap 7 to extract it from the upper half-mould (Figure 11).<br>
Figures from 18 to 26 show a second embodiment of the invention which<br>
enables a cap 40 to be formed comprising an inner portion 41 clad with an<br>
outer covering 42 (Figure 18).<br>
In the description of the second embodiment the same reference<br>
numerals will be used to indicate those identical components already<br>
described in the preceding embodiment of the invention.<br><br>
The cap 40 is formed by forming devices 43 comprising an upper half-<br>
mould 44 and a lower half-mould 45.<br>
With particular reference to Figures 19 and 20 it can be seen that the<br>
upper half-mould 44 comprises a disc-shaped punch 46 upperly provided<br>
with a shank 47 provided with a central cavity 48, the bottom of which<br>
communicates with a plurality of conduits 49 which open into the lateral<br>
surface of the punch 46.<br>
The shank 47 (Figure 19) is screwed onto a sleeve 50 which is screwed<br>
onto a tubular stem 51. In the interior of the tubular stem 51, of the sleeve<br>
50 and of the cavity 48 of the shank 47 there are inserted two tubes, one<br>
inside the other, indicated by the numerals 52 and 53, and connected<br>
respectively to a cooling system and to a pressurized air blowing system.<br>
In detail, the tube 53 (Figure 20) is sealedly mounted on a centrally bored<br>
cylinder 54 received on the base of the cavity 48, and communicates with<br>
the conduits 49 via the hole of the cylinder 54. The other end of the tube<br>
53 is connected to said pressurized air delivery system, not shown being<br>
of usual type.<br>
The tube 52 (Figure 20) rests on an annular shoulder of the cavity 48 and<br>
opens into a chamber 55 from which a plurality of radial conduits 56<br>
branch to open on the outside of the shank 47. Said radial conduits<br>
specifically open into an annular interspace 57 present between the inner<br>
surface of the sleeve 50 and the shank 47.<br>
The upper end of the tube 52 is connected to a cooling system, not shown<br>
being of usual type.<br><br>
With reference to Figure 19, with the tubular stem 51 there is associated<br>
an outer ring 14 which rests, via the spring 59, on an annular member 60,<br>
into which the tubular stem, rigid with the turntable 2, is inserted.<br>
On the tubular stem 51 there is also mounted a spacer 15 resting on the<br>
member 60 and positioned concentric to the spring 59.<br>
The member 60 is composed of a tubular element 61 into which a ring 62<br>
is screwed.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 19, the spring 59 maintains the sleeve 50,<br>
screwed onto the tubular stem 51, resting against the lower surface of the<br>
member 60. On the sleeve 50 there is mounted an extraction ring 63<br>
connected to a linear actuator 20 by a fork member 21.<br>
When the mould is open (Figure 19) the upper edge of the extraction ring<br>
63 rests on the edge of a cup 64 mounted on the outside of the member<br>
60, and on which there rests a spring 65, the other end of which rests on<br>
an annular shoulder of the member 60. Said cup is normally maintained<br>
against an annular shoulder 600 of the member 60, as shown in Figure<br>
19.<br>
On the outside of the extraction ring there is provided a closure ring 66<br>
having two slots through which the fork 21 connecting the extraction n'ng<br>
63 to the linear actuator 20 passes. As can be seen from Figure 19, the<br>
closure ring 66 rests against an annular bracket element 667 rigid with a<br>
hole in the turntable which supports the forming unit.<br>
The closure ring is inserted in an annular collar inserted into said hole in<br>
the turntable 2 which supports the forming unit. Sealing slide means 221<br>
are present between the closure ring and the extraction ring, and between<br>
the closure ring and said collar.<br><br>
The collar 60 presents an inner annular shoulder 690 on which there rests<br>
a socket 67 acting as a lower end guide for a spring 68, the other end of<br>
which rests against an annular shoulder of the member 60.<br>
The lower half-mould comprises a die 70, internally defining the forming<br>
cavity 700, which is fixed to an overlying support member 71 by an<br>
external ring nut 72, a ring 73 being interposed between said die 70 and<br>
said support member.<br>
The support member 71 can translate vertically, being associated with<br>
suitable hydraulic operating means, not shown being of known type.<br>
Inside the member 71 there are provided a plurality of channels 74<br>
connected to a usual cooling system.<br>
The forming cavity 700 receives the feed quantities to be pressed to form<br>
the product, and comprises an annular shoulder 701 on which both the<br>
edge of the closure ring and the edge of the extraction ring rest when the<br>
mould is closed.<br>
The product is formed by inserting the first annular measured quantity 100<br>
into the forming cavity with the mould open (Figure 19) then dosing the<br>
mould to define a first forming chamber. When the mould is closed, the<br>
pressing of the measured quantity 100 commences by raising the lower<br>
half-mould. The upward movement of the lower half-mould causes both<br>
the extraction ring 63 and the closure ring 66 to rise against the action of<br>
the respective springs 65 and 68. When the material being pressed<br>
comes into contact with the lower edge of the extraction ring, this is urged<br>
further upwards. It should be noted that the extraction ring may either rest<br>
or not rest against the lower surface of the shoulder of member 60,<br><br>
depending on the moulding pressure. In this manner the edge 410 of the<br>
insert 41 of the cap 40 is formed, as shown in Figure 22.<br>
When formation of the cap insert 41 is complete, the mould is reopened, a<br>
second measured quantity 201 is inserted into the cavity and the mould is<br>
reclosed to define a second forming chamber, which comprises the outer<br>
surface of the insert 41 in addition to a portion of the cavity 700.<br>
Moulding of the second measured quantity takes place substantially in the<br>
aforedescribed manner, as will be clear from the accompanying figures.<br>
When the cap has been moulded the mould is reopened and the linear<br>
actuator 20 is lowered to cause the extraction ring to move downwards<br>
and extract the formed cap 40. It should be noted that during the<br>
extraction stage the compressed air delivery system is activated to inflate<br>
the cap in order to facilitate its detachment.<br>
Figures from 27 to 37 show a third embodiment of the invention for<br>
forming a cap 80 comprising an inner portion 800 and an outer covering<br>
801.<br>
In the description of the third embodiment of the invention, the same<br>
reference numerals will be used to indicate those identical components<br>
already described in the preceding embodiments of the invention.<br>
The cap 80 is formed by forming devices 81 comprising an upper half-<br>
mould 82 and a lower half-mould 83.<br>
With particular reference to Figures 28 and 29 it can be seen that the<br>
upper half-mould 81 comprises a punch 46 upperly provided with a shank<br>
47 provided with a central cavity 48, the bottom of which communicates<br>
with a plurality of conduits 49 which open into the lateral surface of the<br>
punch 46.<br><br>
The shank is screwed onto a sleeve 50 which is screwed onto a tubular<br>
stem 51. In the interior of the tubular stem 51, of the sleeve 50 and of the<br>
cavity 48 of the shank 47 there are inserted two tubes, one inside the<br>
other, indicated by the numerals 52 and 53, and connected respectively to<br>
a cooling system and to a pressurized air blowing system.<br>
In detail, the tube 53 (Figure 29) is sealedly mounted on a centrally bored<br>
cylinder 54 received on the base of the cavity 48, and communicates with<br>
the conduits 49 via the hole in the cylinder 54. The other end of the tube<br>
is connected to said pressurized air delivery system, not shown being of<br>
usual type.<br>
The tube 52 (Figure 29) rests on an annular shoulder of the cavity 48 and<br>
opens into a chamber 55 from which a plurality of radial conduits 56<br>
branch to open on the outside of the shank 47. Said radial conduits<br>
specifically open into an annular interspace 57 present between the inner<br>
surface of the sleeve 50 and the shank 47.<br>
The upper end of the tube 52 is connected to a cooling system, not shown<br>
being of usual type.<br>
On the tubular stem 51 there is mounted a fixed bush 84 supporting a<br>
spacer 15 and a spring 59. The spring 59 is mounted about the spacer 15<br>
and acts against a disc 14 rigid with the tubular stem 51.<br>
The bush 84 is mounted on the tubular stem 51 and is rigid with the<br>
turntable 2. The bush 84 carries a screwed tube 85, the lower edge of<br>
which rests on the annular shoulder of the sleeve 50 by virtue of the thrust<br>
of the spring 59.<br>
On the sleeve 50 the is also mounted a closure and extraction ring 86<br>
connected to an actuator 20 by a fork 21.<br><br>
The extraction ring 86 is mounted in a collar 87 inserted into a hole<br>
present on the turntable 2. Friction and slide means 221 are positioned<br>
both between the ring 86 and said collar 87, and between the ring 86 and<br>
the sleeve 50.<br>
The collar 87 presents an internal annular shoulder 870 on which there<br>
rests a guide cup 888 for a spring 89 positioned between said cup and a<br>
shoulder 840 of the bush 84.<br>
The lower half-mould 83 comprises a fork-shaped member 88 movable in<br>
level by known means, not shown. The fork of the member 88 supports a<br>
shaft 890 carrying two dies 90 and 91, each of which presents an inner<br>
cavity indicated by the reference numerals 96 and 97.<br>
To one end of the shaft 890 there is fixed a pinion 95 associated with drive<br>
means, not shown, enabling the shaft 890 to be rotated to bring the two<br>
dies in front of the punch 46 in succession.<br>
In greater detail, the dies 90 and 91 are associated with the shaft by<br>
means of an interposed hollow cylinder 92, within said hollow cylinder 92,<br>
within said shaft 890 and within said fork member 88 there being present<br>
a plurality of mutually communicating conduits 93 and 94 which open in<br>
proximity to said dies and are connected at their other end to a usual<br>
respective die cooling system; according to the invention there is also<br>
provided a compressed air feed system, not shown, which facilitates the<br>
elimination of the vacuum effect which can be generated on the outside of<br>
the moulded product when opening the mould. The operation of the third<br>
embodiment of the invention consists of inserting a measured quantity of<br>
synthetic material into the cavity 96 of the die 90, then operating the<br>
means for varying the level of the member 88 in order to bring the edge of<br><br>
the die 90 against the edge of the closure and extraction ring to close the<br>
mould and define a first forming chamber. The member 88 is further<br>
raised to distribute the measured quantity within the forming chamber.<br>
During the raising of the member 88 the closure ring is raised until its<br>
upper edge comes into contact with the cup 888 guiding the spring 89,<br>
which hence commences to exert on said ring a force opposing the raising<br>
of the member 88.<br>
When the insert 800 has been formed (Figure 30), the mould is opened,<br>
the insert remaining rigid with the upper half-mould because of the thread<br>
present in the insert.<br>
At this point the shaft 89 is rotated to bring the die 91 below the punch 46,<br>
and a second measured quantity 201 of synthetic material is inserted into<br>
the cavity 97 of the die 91. The mould is then closed to define a second<br>
forming chamber. When the mould is closed the die is raised to form the<br>
outer covering 801 on top of the inner part 800 by compression.<br>
On termination of pressing, the mould is reopened and the linear actuator<br>
20 is operated to cause the closure and extraction ring 86 to move<br>
downwards and extract the cap 80 from the punch. It should be noted<br>
that during this latter stage said compressed air delivery systems 53 are<br>
activated to inflate the cap from its interior in order to facilitate its<br>
detachment from the punch, to which it is connected by the thread-<br>
Figures 34,35 and 36 show a first variant of the third embodiment of the<br>
invention, which differs with regard to the lower half-mould of the forming<br>
unit.<br>
From said figures it can be seen that the lower half-mould comprises a<br>
slide 105 to which the dies 90 and 91 are fixed. The slide 105 comprises<br><br>
two opposing L-shaped lower guides 106 in which three pairs of bearings<br>
107	are received to enable the slide 105 to be translated by means, not<br>
shown, in the direction radial to the axis of rotation of the turntable to bring<br>
the two dies below the punch 46 in succession.<br>
With reference to Figure 36, the bearings 107 are associated with a frame<br>
108	provided with a central hole for receiving a pin 118 screwed to a<br>
support shank 110, there being interposed between the frame and the<br>
support shank a spring 111 mounted on a stem 109 branching centrally<br>
from the support shank 110.<br>
The element 110 is associated with usual drive means, not shown,<br>
enabling the slide to translate vertically.<br>
Figure 35 also shows two ribs 109 which branch from the shank 110 and<br>
are received in two slots 122 of the frame 108; said ribs prevent rotation of<br>
the frame about the pin 118.<br>
To operate of this variant of the invention, the die 90 is firstly positioned<br>
below the punch 46, a first measured quantity 100 is inserted into the die<br>
and the mould is closed by raising the slide 105. When the mould has<br>
been closed, pressing takes place in the manner described for the third<br>
embodiment of the invention, with the difference that after moulding the<br>
insert 800, the mould is reopened and the slide made to translate in order<br>
to bring the cavity 91, into which a second measured quantity of plastic<br>
material has been inserted, below the punch 46. At this point the mould is<br>
reclosed and the outer covering of the cap 801 is pressed.<br>
It should be noted that the forces exerted during pressing are not<br>
supported by the bearings 107 but by the pin 108. In this respect, during<br><br>
pressing, the frame 108 translates relative to the pin 110, and the slide<br>
105 rests on the upper surface of the pin 118.<br>
Figures 37 and 38 show a further variant of the invention which differs<br>
from the described third embodiment with regard to the lower half-mould<br>
112.<br>
With reference to the figures it can be seen that the dies 90 and 91 are<br>
fixed to a plate 113 associated with the turntable 2 and rotataWe relative<br>
thereto about an axis eccentric and parallel to the axis of rotation of the<br>
turntable.<br>
Specifically the plate presents two lower circular guides 114 receiving a<br>
rolling bearing 115 associated with a support frame 116 provided with a<br>
central hole for receiving the pin 118 screwed to the support shank 110,<br>
the spring 111 being interposed between the frame and the support<br>
shank.<br>
The support pin is associated with drive means enabling it to translate<br>
vertically, these means not being shown being of known type. The<br>
operation of this variant of the invention is similar to the operation of the<br>
preceding variant, with the difference that in this case the dies are<br>
repositioned below the punch by rotating the plate 113.<br><br>
