CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/984,980 filed on November 2, 2007 which is hereby incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure pertains to control systems for electro-mechanical<br>
transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary<br>
powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a<br>
driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric<br>
machines, operative as motors or generators, generate an input torque to the<br><br>
transmission, independently of an input torque from the internal combustion<br>
engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br>
powertrain, including controlling transmission operating range state and gear<br>
shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical<br>
power interchange among the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and<br>
rotational speed.<br>
[0005] Transmissions within a hybrid powertrain, as described above, serve<br>
a number of functions by transmitting and manipulating torque in order to<br>
provide torque to an output member. In order to serve the particular function<br>
required, the transmission selects between a number of operating range states<br>
or configurations internal to the transmission defining the transfer of torque<br>
through the transmission. Known transmissions utilize operating range states<br>
including fixed gear states or states with a defined gear ratio. For example, a<br>
transmission can utilize four sequentially arranged fixed gear states and allow<br>
selection between the four gear states in order to provide output torque<br>
through a wide range of output member speeds. Additively or alternatively,<br>
known transmissions also allow for continuously variable operating range<br>
states or mode states, enabled for instance through the use of a planetary gear<br>
set, wherein the gear ratio provided by the transmission can be varied across a<br>
range in order to modulate the output speed and output torque provided by a<br>
particular set of inputs. Additionally, transmissions can operate in a neutral<br><br>
state, ceasing all torque from being transmitted through the transmission.<br>
Additionally, transmissions can operate in a reverse mode, accepting input<br>
torque in a particular rotational direction used for normal forward operation<br>
and reversing the direction of rotation of the output member. Through<br>
selection of different operating range states, transmissions can provide a range<br>
of outputs for a given input.<br>
[0006] Operation of the above devices within a hybrid powertrain vehicle<br>
require management of numerous torque bearing shafts or devices<br>
representing connections to the above mentioned engine, electrical machines,<br>
and driveline. Input torque from the engine and input torque from the electric<br>
machine or electric machines can be applied individually or cooperatively to<br>
provide output torque. However, changes in output torque required from the<br>
transmission, for instance, due to a change in operator pedal position or due to<br>
an operating range state shift, must be handled smoothly. Particularly difficult<br>
to manage are input torques, applied simultaneously to a transmission, with<br>
different reaction times to a control input. Based upon a single control input,<br>
the various devices can change respective input torques at different times,<br>
causing increased abrupt changes to the overall torque applied through the<br>
transmission. Abrupt or uncoordinated changes to the various input torques<br>
applied to a transmission can cause a perceptible change in acceleration or jerk<br>
in the vehicle, which can adversely affect vehicle drivability.<br>
[0007] Various control schemes and operational connections between the<br>
various aforementioned components of the hybrid drive system are known,<br>
and the control system must be able to engage to and disengage the various<br>
components from the transmission in order to perform the functions of the<br><br>
hybrid powertrain system. Engagement and disengagement are known to be<br>
accomplished within the transmission by employing selectively operable<br>
clutches. Clutches are devices well known in the art for engaging and<br>
disengaging shafts including the management of rotational velocity and torque<br>
differences between the shafts. Engagement or locking, disengagement or<br>
unlocking, operation while engaged or locked operation, and operation while<br>
disengaged or unlocked operation are all clutch states that must be managed in<br>
order for the vehicle to operate properly and smoothly.<br>
[0008] Clutches are known in a variety of designs and control methods. One<br>
known type of clutch is a mechanical clutch operating by separating or joining<br>
two connective surfaces, for instance, clutch plates, operating, when joined, to<br>
apply frictional torque to each other. One control method for operating such a<br>
mechanical clutch includes applying a hydraulic control system implementing<br>
fluidic pressures transmitted through hydraulic lines to exert or release<br>
clamping force between the two connective surfaces. Operated thusly, the<br>
clutch is not operated in a binary manner, but rather is capable of a range of<br>
engagement states, from fully disengaged, to synchronized but not engaged, to<br>
engaged but with only minimal clamping force, to engaged with some<br>
maximum clamping force. Clamping force applied to the clutch determines<br>
how much reactive torque the clutch can carry before the clutch slips.<br>
Variable control of clutches through modulation of clamping force allows for<br>
transition between locked and unlocked states and further allows for managing<br>
slip in a locked transmission. In addition, the maximum clamping force<br>
capable of being applied by the hydraulic lines can also vary with vehicle<br>
operating states and can be modulated based upon control strategies.<br><br>
[0009] Clutches are known to be operated asynchronously, designed to<br>
accommodate some level of slip in transitions between locked and unlocked<br>
states. Other clutches are known to be operated synchronously, designed to<br>
match speeds of connective surfaces or synchronize before the connective<br>
surfaces are clamped together. This disclosure deals primarily with<br>
synchronous clutches.<br>
[0010] Slip, or relative rotational movement between the connective surfaces<br>
of the clutch when the clutch connective surfaces are intended to be<br>
synchronized and locked, occurs whenever reactive torque applied to the<br>
clutch exceeds actual torque capacity created by applied clamping force. Slip<br>
in a transmission results in unintended loss of torque control within the<br>
transmission, results in loss of engine speed control and electric machine<br>
speed control caused by a sudden change in back-torque from the<br>
transmission, and results in sudden changes to vehicle acceleration, creating<br>
adverse affects to drivability.<br>
[0011] Transmissions can operate with a single clutch transmitting reactive<br>
torque between inputs and an output. Transmission can operate with a<br>
plurality of clutches transmitting reactive torque between inputs and an output.<br>
Selection of operating range state depends upon the selective engagement of<br>
clutches, with different allowable combinations resulting in different operating<br>
range states.<br>
[0012] Transition from one operating state range to another operating state<br>
range involves transitioning at least one clutch state. An exemplary transition<br>
from one fixed gear state to another involves unloading a first clutch,<br>
transitioning through a freewheeling, wherein no clutches remain engaged, or<br><br>
inertia speed phase state, wherein at least one clutch remains engaged, and<br>
subsequently loading a second clutch. A driveline connected to a locked and<br>
synchronized clutch, prior to being unloaded, is acted upon by an output<br>
torque resulting through the transmission as a result of input torques and<br>
reduction factors present in the transmission. In such a torque transmitting<br>
state, the transmission so configured during a shift is said to be in a torque<br>
phase. In a torque phase, vehicle speed and vehicle acceleration are functions<br>
of the output torque and other forces acting upon the vehicle. Unloading a<br>
clutch removes all input torque from a previously locked and synchronized<br>
clutch. As a result, any propelling force previously applied to the output<br>
torque through that clutch is quickly reduced to zero. In one exemplary<br>
configuration, another clutch remains engaged and transmitting torque to the<br>
output while the transmission synchronizes the second clutch. In such a<br>
configuration, the transmission is in an inertia speed phase. As the second<br>
clutch to be loaded is synchronized and loaded, the transmission again enters a<br>
torque phase, wherein vehicle speed and vehicle acceleration are functions of<br>
the output torque and other forces acting upon the vehicle. While output<br>
torque changes or interruptions due to clutch unloading and loading are a<br>
normal part of transmission operating range state shifts, orderly management<br>
of the output torque changes reduces the impact of the shifts to drivability.<br>
[0013] As described above, changes in transmission operating range states<br>
involve transitioning clutches. In synchronous operation, it is important to<br>
match speeds across the clutch connective surfaces before clamping the<br>
connective surface together. However, engine operation and torque output<br>
may not be accommodative to the changes in operating range states requiring<br><br>
particular changes in input speed. Engines are known to preferably operate in<br>
a certain speed range, and attempted operation of the engine outside that range<br>
can cause the engine to stall, incur fuel economy penalties associated with<br>
changing engine settings and operating the engine in non-ideal speeds, and<br>
adversely affect drivability. A method to control a powertrain through<br>
transmission shifts accounting for costs associated with synchronous clutch<br>
operation would be beneficial.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

transmission shift based upon an input speed profile resulting from the<br>
predicted output deceleration and from the desired synchronous transmission<br>
shift, and executing the synchronous transmission shift based upon the penalty<br>
cost.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0036] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, FIGS. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain in accordance with the present disclosure is depicted in FIG. 1,<br>
comprising a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid<br><br>
transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14 and first and second<br>
electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can be<br>
transmitted to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transmitted to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input torques, referred to herein as T|,<br>
TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as N1, NA, and NB,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0037] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12.<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and output<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed, N1, and the input torque, T|, to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic<br>
pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0038] The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24, 26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transmitting devices,<br>
i.e., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer<br>
to any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound<br>
plate clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module<br><br>
(hereafter 'TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and<br>
C4 75 preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches.<br>
Clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled<br>
stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68.<br>
Each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably<br>
hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0039] The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably comprise<br>
three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a rotor (not<br>
shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for each<br>
machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and<br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br>
[0040] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br><br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NAand NB, respectively.<br>
[0041] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power, e.g., to vehicle wheels 93, one of which is shown in<br>
FIG. 1. The output power is characterized in terms of an output rotational<br>
speed, NO and an output torque, TO. A transmission output speed sensor 84<br>
monitors rotational speed and rotational direction of the output member 64.<br>
Each of the vehicle wheels 93, is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted<br>
to monitor wheel speed, VSS-WHL, the output of which is monitored by a<br>
control module of a distributed control module system described with respect<br>
to Fig. B, to determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds<br>
for braking control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0042] The input torques from the engine 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 (T1, TA, and TB respectively) are generated as a result of<br>
energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical<br>
energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The transfer<br>
conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor switch 38 is<br>
closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between the ESD 74<br>
and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric current<br><br>
flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM 19<br>
transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power to and<br>
from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31, in response to<br>
torque requests to the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to achieve<br>
the input torques TA and TB. Electrical current is transmitted to and from the<br>
ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or<br>
discharged.<br>
[0043] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA and TB.<br>
The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power<br>
electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC<br>
power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive control<br>
commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for<br>
each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States of the<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive<br>
mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality.<br>
The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is<br>
conducted to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for<br><br>
operation as motors or generators via transfer conductors 29 and 31<br>
respectively.<br>
[0044] FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control module<br>
system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall<br>
vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of the<br>
exemplary powertrain described in FIG. 1. The distributed control module<br>
system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes algorithms<br>
to control various actuators to achieve control objectives, including objectives<br>
related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and protection of<br>
hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes an<br>
engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
('UI') 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP') from which<br>
an operator torque request is determined, an operator brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a<br>
transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a vehicle speed cruise control<br>
(not shown). The transmission gear selector 114 may have a discrete number<br>
of operator-selectable positions, including the rotational direction of the output<br>
member 64 to enable one of a forward and a reverse direction.<br>
[0045] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus<br><br>
6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states of operating<br>
parameters and actuator command signals between the various control<br>
modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific.<br>
The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and<br>
multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control<br>
modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as antilock<br>
braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple communications<br>
buses may be used to improve communications speed and provide some level<br>
of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication between individual<br>
control modules can also be effected using a direct link, e.g., a serial<br>
peripheral interface ('SPI') bus (not shown).<br>
[0046] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the powertrain, serving to<br>
coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and BPCM 21.<br>
Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 generates various commands,<br>
including: the operator torque request ('TO_REQ'), a commanded output torque<br>
('TCMD') to the driveline 90, an engine input torque request, clutch torques for<br>
the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission<br>
10; and the torque requests for the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72, respectively. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42 and provides various functions including monitoring various<br>
pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and communicating<br>
control signals to various solenoids (not shown) thereby controlling pressure<br>
switches and control valves contained within the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br><br>
[0047] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions<br>
to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a<br>
plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-directional<br>
interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque request from<br>
the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, T|,<br>
provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon monitored<br>
engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23<br>
monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine<br>
input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission input<br>
speed, N1. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0048] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated clutch<br>
torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and<br>
rotational output speed, No, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br><br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0049] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT^MIN to PBAT MAX-<br>
[0050] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19 and BPCM<br>
21 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and serial peripheral interface buses. The<br>
control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br><br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for example each<br>
3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing operation of the<br>
powertrain. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to the<br>
occurrence of an event.<br>
[0051] The exemplary powertrain selectively operates in one of several<br>
operating range states that can be described in terms of an engine state<br>
comprising one of an engine on state ('ON') and an engine off state ('OFF'),<br>
and a transmission state comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br>
[0052] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br><br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch C1 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('MI_Eng_On') or OFF<br>
('M1_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2, or<br>
M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., NI/NO, is achieved. A first fixed gear operation<br>
('G1') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear<br>
operation ('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third<br>
fixed gear operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75.<br>
A fourth fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62<br>
and C3 73. The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with<br>
increased fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary<br>
gears 24, 26, and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, NA and NB respectively, are dependent on internal<br>
rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to<br>
the input speed measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0053] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake<br>
pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of<br>
the other control modules determine the commanded output torque, TCMD,<br>
intended to meet the operator torque request, TO_REQ, to be executed at the<br><br>
output member 64 and transmitted to the driveline 90. Final vehicle<br>
acceleration is affected by other factors including, e.g., road load, road grade,<br>
and vehicle mass. The operating range state is determined for the transmission<br>
10 based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. This<br>
includes the operator torque request, communicated through the accelerator<br>
pedal 113 and brake pedal 112 to the user interface 13 as previously described.<br>
The operating range state may be predicated on a powertrain torque demand<br>
caused by a command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode.<br>
The operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine, initiated for example within a hybrid strategic control module of the<br>
HCP 5, which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The control<br>
system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage<br>
fuel economy and battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-<br>
generative devices, and determines the power output from the transmission 10<br>
required to achieve the desired output torque to meet the operator torque<br>
request. As should be apparent from the description above, the ESD 74 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are.electrically-operatively<br>
coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore, the engine 14, the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the electro-mechanical<br><br>
transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to transmit power<br>
therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member 64.<br>
[0054] As discussed above, managing output torque in order to maintain<br>
drivability is a priority in controlling a hybrid powertrain. Any change in<br>
torque in response to a change in output torque request applied through the<br>
transmission results in a change to the output torque applied to the driveline,<br>
thereby resulting in a change in propelling force to the vehicle and a change in<br>
vehicle acceleration. The change in torque request can come from operator<br>
input, such a pedal position relating an operator torque request, automatic<br>
control changes in the vehicle, such as cruise control or other control strategy,<br>
or engine changes in response to environmental conditions, such as a vehicle<br>
experiencing an uphill or downhill grade. By controlling changes to various<br>
input torques applied to a transmission within a hybrid powertrain, abrupt<br>
changes in vehicle acceleration can be controlled and minimized in order to<br>
reduce adverse effects to drivability.<br>
[0055] As is known by one having ordinary skill in the art, any control<br>
system includes a reaction time. Changes to a powertrain operating point,<br>
comprising the speeds and torques of the various components to the<br>
powertrain required to achieve the desired vehicle operation, are driven by<br>
changes in control signals. These control signal changes act upon the various<br>
components to the powertrain and create reactions in each according to their<br>
respective reaction times. Applied to a hybrid powertrain, any change in<br>
control signals indicating a new torque request, for instance, as driven by a<br>
change in operator torque request or as required to execute a transmission<br>
shift, creates reactions in each affected torque generating device in order to<br><br>
execute the required changes to respective input torques. Changes to input<br>
torque supplied from an engine are controlled by an engine torque request<br>
setting the torque generated by the engine, as controlled, for example, through<br>
an ECM. Reaction time within an engine to changes in torque request to an<br>
engine is impacted by a number of factors well known in the art, and the<br>
particulars of a change to engine operation depend heavily on the particulars<br>
of the engine employed and the mode or modes of combustion being utilized.<br>
In many circumstances, the reaction time of an engine to changes in torque<br>
request will be the longest reaction time of the components to the hybrid drive<br>
system. Reaction time within an electric machine to changes in torque request<br>
include time to activate any necessary switches, relays, or other controls and<br>
time to energize or de-energize the electric machine with the change in applied<br>
electrical power.<br>
[0056] FIG. 3 graphically depicts reaction times of exemplary hybrid<br>
powertrain components to changes in torque request, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure. Components to an exemplary hybrid powertrain system<br>
including an engine and two electric machines are exemplified. Torque<br>
requests and resulting changes in input torque produced by each torque<br>
generating device are illustrated. As described above, the data shows that<br>
electric machines quickly respond to changes in torque requests, whereas the<br>
engine follows changes in torque requests more slowly.<br>
[0057] A method is disclosed wherein reactions times of the engine and of<br>
the electric machine or machines within a hybrid powertrain are utilized to<br>
control in parallel an lead immediate torque request, controlling the engine,<br>
and an immediate torque request, controlling the electric machines, the torque<br><br>
requests being coordinated by respective reaction times in order to<br>
substantially effect simultaneous changes to input torque.<br>
[0058] Because, as discussed above, changes to input torque from the engine<br>
are known to involve consistently longer reactions times than changes to input<br>
torque from an electric machine, an exemplary embodiment of the disclosed<br>
method can implement changes in torque request to the engine and the electric<br>
machine, acting in parallel as described above, including a lead period to the<br>
more quickly reacting device, the electric motor. This lead period may be<br>
developed experimentally, empirically, predictively, through modeling or<br>
other techniques adequate to accurately predict engine and electric machine<br>
operation, and a multitude of lead periods might be used by the same hybrid<br>
powertrain, depending upon different engine settings, conditions, operating<br>
and ranges and vehicle conditions. An exemplary equation that can be used in<br>
conjunction with test data or estimates of device reaction times to calculate<br>
lead period in accordance with the present disclosure includes the following:<br>
T Lead + T Lead Reaction - T Immediate Reaction	[ 1]<br>
TLead equals the lead period for use in methods described herein. This equation<br>
assumes that two torque producing devices are utilized. TLead Reaction represents<br>
the reaction time of the device with the longer reaction time, and TImmediate<br>
Reaction represents the reaction time of the device with the shorter reaction time.<br>
If a different system is utilized, comprising for example, an engine with a long<br>
lead period, a first electric machine with an intermediate lead period, and a<br>
second electric machine with a short lead period, lead periods can be<br><br>
developed comparing all of the torque generating devices. In this exemplary<br>
system, if all three torque generating devices are involved, two lead periods,<br>
one for the engine as compared to each of the electric machines, will be<br>
utilized to synchronize the responses in each of the devices. The same system<br>
at a different time might be operating with the engine off and disengaged from<br>
the transmission, and a lead period comparing the first electric machine and<br>
the second electric machine will be utilized to synchronize the responses in the<br>
two electric machines. In this way, a lead period can be developed<br>
coordinating reaction times between various torque generating devices can be<br>
developed.<br>
[0059] One exemplary method to utilize lead periods to implement parallel<br>
torque requests to distinct torque generating devices in order to effect<br>
substantially simultaneous changes to output torque in response to a change in<br>
operator torque request includes issuing substantially immediately a change to<br>
the engine torque immediate request, initiating within the engine a change to a<br>
new engine output torque. This new engine output torque, in conjunction with<br>
the electric motor operating state, is still managed by the HCP in order to<br>
provide some portion of the total input torque to the transmission required to<br>
propel the vehicle. From the point that the engine torque immediate request<br>
changes, the lead period expires, described above taking into account the<br>
differences in reaction times between the engine and the electric machine.<br>
After the lead period, a change to torque requests issued to the electric<br>
machine or machines, managed by the HCP in order to fulfill a portion of the<br>
operator torque request, is executed, and the electric machine changes the<br>
electric machine operating state, and as described above, the changes to the<br><br>
input torques provided by the engine and the electric machine change<br>
substantially simultaneously.<br>
[0060] As described in the disclosed method above, engine torque immediate<br>
requests and torque requests to an electric machine are disclosed for use in<br>
parallel to control distinct torque generative devices with different reaction<br>
times to reaction to changes in operator torque request. Changes in operator<br>
torque request can include a simple change in desired output torque within a<br>
particular transmission operating range state, or changes in operator torque<br>
request can be required in conjunction with a transmission shift between<br>
different operating range states. Changes to operator torque requests in<br>
conjunction with a transmission shift are more complex than changes<br>
contained within a single operating range state because torques and shaft<br>
speeds of the various hybrid powertrain components must be managed in order<br>
to transition torque applied from a first clutch and to a second previously not<br>
applied clutch without the occurrence of slip, as described above.<br>
[0061] Shifts within a transmission, such as the exemplary transmission of<br>
FIG. 1, frequently involve unloading a first clutch, transitioning through an<br>
inertia speed phase state, and subsequently loading a second clutch. Within<br>
the transmission of a conventionally powered vehicle utilizing an engine only,<br>
the change within a transmission from one fixed gear state to another fixed<br>
gear state frequently includes unloading a first clutch, allowing the vehicle to<br>
briefly coast, and then loading a second clutch. However, as described in<br>
relation to FIG. 1 and Table 1, above, clutches within a hybrid powertrain<br>
transmission are frequently applied in pairs or groups, and a shift within the<br>
transmission can involve only unloading one of the applied clutches and<br><br>
subsequently loading another clutch while maintaining engagement of a third<br>
clutch throughout the shift. FIG. 4 demonstrates gear transition relationships<br>
for an exemplary hybrid powertrain transmission, in particular as described in<br>
the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1 and Table 1, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure. NI is plotted against NO. At any fixed gear state, NO is<br>
determined by the corresponding NI along the fixed gear state plots. Operation<br>
in either EVT Mode 1 or EVT Mode 2, wherein a continuously variable gear<br>
ratio is utilized to power from a fixed input speed can take place in the<br>
respective zones illustrated on the graph. Clutch states, C1 - C4, as described<br>
in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1, are described in Table 1. For<br>
instance, operation in a second fixed gear state requires clutches C1 and C2 to<br>
be applied or loaded and clutches C3 and C4 to be not applied or unloaded.<br>
While FIG. 4 describes gear transitions possible in the exemplary powertrain<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1, it will be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the<br>
art that such a description of gear transitions is possible for any transmission<br>
of a hybrid powertrain, and the disclosure is not intended to be limited to the<br>
particular embodiment described herein.<br>
[0062] FIG. 4 can describe operation of an exemplary system in a fixed gear<br>
state or EVT mode, as described above, and it can also be used to describe<br>
shift transitions between the various transmission operating range states. The<br>
areas and plots on the graph describe operation of the operating range states<br>
through transitions. For example, transitions between fixed gear states within<br>
an EVT mode region require transitory operation in the EVT mode between<br>
the fixed gear states. Similarly, transition from EVT Mode 1 to EVT Mode 2<br><br>
requires a transition through the second fixed gear state, located at the<br>
boundary between the two modes.<br>
[0063] In accordance with FIGS. 1 and 4 and Table 1, an exemplary<br>
transmission shift from a third fixed gear state to a fourth fixed gear state is<br>
further described. Referring to FIG. 4, both the beginning and the preferred<br>
operating range states exist within the area of EVT Mode 2. Therefore, a<br>
transition from the third gear state to the fourth gear state requires first a shift<br>
from the third fixed gear state to EVT Mode 2 and then a shift from EVT<br>
Mode 2 to the fourth fixed gear state. Referring to Table 1, a hybrid<br>
powertrain transmission, beginning in a third fixed gear state, will have<br>
clutches C2 and C4 applied. Table 1 further describes operation in EVT<br>
Mode 2, the destination of the first shift, to include clutch C2 applied.<br>
Therefore, a shift from the third fixed gear state to EVT Mode 2 requires<br>
clutch C4 to be changed from an applied to a not applied state and requires<br>
that clutch C2 remain applied. Additionally, Table 1 describes operation in<br>
the fourth fixed gear mode, the destination of the second shift, wherein<br>
clutches C2 and C3 are applied. Therefore, a shift from EVT Mode 2 to the<br>
fourth fixed gear state requires clutch C3 to be applied and loaded and requires<br>
that clutch C2 remain applied. Therefore, clutches C4 and C3 are transitioned<br>
through the exemplary shift, while clutch C2 remains applied and transmitting<br>
torque to the driveline throughout the shift event.<br>
[0064] Applied to the methods disclosed herein, changes in input torque<br>
through a transmission shift can be adjusted to reduce negative effects to<br>
drivability by coordinating signal commands to various torque generative<br>
devices based upon reaction times of the various components. As described<br><br>
above, many transmission shifts can be broken down into three phases: a first<br>
torque phase, during which an initially applied clutch is changed from a<br>
torque-bearing, locked, and synchronized clutch state to an unlocked and<br>
desynchronized clutch state; an inertia speed phase, during which affected<br>
clutches are unlocked and in transitional states; and a second torque phase,<br>
during which a second previously not applied clutch is changed from an<br>
unlocked and desynchronized clutch state to a torque-bearing, locked, and<br>
synchronized clutch state. As aforementioned, clutch slip is preferably<br>
avoided throughout transmission shifts to avoid adverse effects on drivability,<br>
and clutch slip is created when reactive torque applied across a clutch exceeds<br>
the actual torque capacity of the clutch. Therefore, within a transmission shift<br>
event, input torques must be managed in relation to the actual torque capacity<br>
of the currently applied clutch, such that the transmission shift can be<br>
accomplished without the occurrence of slip.<br>
[0065] While a process can be utilized to perform necessary steps in a clutch<br>
loading or unloading event in sequence, with the torque capacity of the clutch<br>
being maintained in excess of reactive torques, time involved in an unlocking<br>
transition is also important to drivability. Therefore, it is advantageous to<br>
perform associated torque requests and clutch capacity commands in parallel<br>
while still acting to prevent slip. Such parallel implementation of control<br>
changes intending to effect clutch state changes associated with a transmission<br>
shift preferably occur in as short of a time-span as possible. Therefore.<br>
coordination of torque capacity within the clutches involved in the<br>
transmission shift to the torque requests, both to the engine and to the electric<br>
machine, as described in the exemplary embodiment above, is also important<br><br>
to maintaining drivability through a transmission shift. FIGS. 5-7 depict<br>
exemplary processes combining to accomplish an exemplary transmission<br>
shift, in accordance with the present disclosure.<br>
[0066] FIG. 5 is a graphical representation of torque terms associated with a<br>
clutch through an exemplary transitional unlocking state, in accordance with<br>
the present disclosure. Lines illustrated at the left extreme of the graph depict<br>
clutch operation in a locked state. The graph depicts clutch command torque<br>
by a clutch control system and a resulting estimated torque capacity. Clutch<br>
torque capacity in a clutch resulting from a command torque is a result of<br>
many factors, including available clamping pressure, design and conditional<br>
factors of the clutch, reaction time in the clutch to changes in the clutch<br>
control system. As demonstrated in the exemplary data of the graph in the<br>
initial locked region, it is known to command a torque to a locked clutch in<br>
excess of the clutch capacity and allow the other factors affecting the clutch to<br>
determine the resulting clutch capacity. Also at the left extreme of the graph<br>
depicting clutch operation in a locked state, estimated reactive torque applied<br>
to the clutch as a result of input torque from the engine and electric machine<br>
torques is depicted. At the time labeled "Initiate Unlocking State", logic<br>
within the clutch control system or the TCM, having determined a need to<br>
transition the clutch from locked to unlocked states, changes the command<br>
torque to some level lower than the torque capacity but still higher than the<br>
reactive torque currently applied to the clutch. At this point, mechanisms<br>
within the clutch control system, for example, variable pressure control<br>
solenoids within an exemplary hydraulic clutch control system, change<br>
settings to modulate the clamping force within the clutch. As a result, torque<br><br>
capacity of the clutch begins to change as the clamping force applied to the<br>
clutch changes. As discussed above, the clutch reacts to a change in command<br>
torque over a reaction time, and reaction time for a particular clutch will<br>
depend upon the particulars of the application. In the exemplary graph of FIG.<br>
5, torque capacity reacts to a reduction in command torque and begins to<br>
reduce accordingly.<br>
[0067] As mentioned above, during the same unlocking state, reactive torque<br>
resulting from input torque and electric machine torques must also be<br>
unloaded from the clutch. Undesirable slip results if the reactive torque is not<br>
maintained below the torque capacity throughout the unlocking state. Upon<br>
initiation of the unlocking state, at substantially the same point on FIG. 5<br>
where the torque capacity is reduced to initiate the unlocking state, limits are<br>
initiated and imposed upon input torques from the engine and the electric<br>
machine in order to accomplish a ramping down of each to zero. As described<br>
in the method disclosed herein and in exemplary embodiments described<br>
above, changes to limits including a engine torque immediate request and an<br>
immediate torque request are executed in a coordinated process, implementing<br>
a lead period calibrated to the reaction times of the various torque providing<br>
devices, such that the resulting input torques from the devices are reduced<br>
substantially simultaneously. FIG. 5 illustrates a method to perform this<br>
coordinated change to torque requests by imposing limits upon torque requests<br>
in the form of a clutch reactive torque lead immediate min/max constraining<br>
the engine torque immediate request and a clutch reactive torque immediate<br>
min/max constraining the torque request to the electric machine. These<br>
maximum reactive torque values represent the maximum torque that is<br><br>
permitted to be commanded from each torque providing device: the actual<br>
engine torque immediate request and the actual immediate torque request can<br>
be less than the maximum reactive torque values, but as the maximum values<br>
reduce, so the actual torque request values will also eventually reduce. The<br>
input torques from the engine and electric machine together provide, each up<br>
to the defined maximum values, some portion of the overall input torques,<br>
with the portion of each being controlled by the HCP. As a result of the<br>
calibrated lead period, both the clutch reactive torque lead immediate min/max<br>
and the clutch reactive torque immediate min/max reduce applied reactive<br>
torque to the clutch at substantially the same time, resulting in the reduction to<br>
the actual clutch reactive torque as illustrated in FIG. 5. As will be<br>
appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art, other safeguards will<br>
additionally need to be utilized to ensure that the torque capacity remains in<br>
excess of the reactive torque throughout the unloading process. Many such<br>
methods are contemplated, and an exemplary set of terms which might be used<br>
are depicted on FIG. 5. For instance, a calibrated offset term can be used to<br>
ensure that the command setting the clutch capacity remains in excess of the<br>
actual clutch reactive torque until the actual torque passes below some<br>
threshold. An exemplary threshold for such a purpose is defined in FIG. 5 as<br>
the calibrated threshold for reactive torque. In maintaining this torque<br>
capacity request above the actual clutch reactive torque, and remembering that<br>
all devices include a reaction time to request changes, including the clutch<br>
clamping mechanism, the delay in the change to torque capacity in response to<br>
clutch command changes in combination with this offset term will maintain<br>
the torque capacity in excess of the actual clutch reactive torque.<br><br>
Additionally, another threshold, a calibrated threshold for torque estimate, can<br>
be used to define the end of the torque phase. For instance, if an estimate of<br>
the clutch torque capacity, as determined by an algorithm modeling clutch<br>
operation, stays below this threshold through a calibrated period of time, then<br>
the clutch can be determined to be in an unlocked state.<br>
[0068] FIG. 6 is a graphical representation of torque terms associated with a<br>
clutch through an exemplary transitional locking state, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure. As described above, within many transmission shift<br>
events, a second clutch is synchronized and locked, and torque is applied to<br>
the clutch. Lines illustrated at the left extreme of the graph depict clutch<br>
operation in an unlocked state. The initiation of locking state requires a series<br>
of subordinate commands necessary to transition the clutch from an unlocked<br>
state to a locked state. As described above in relation to a transition to a<br>
second torque phase within a transmission shift, the clutch, including the shaft<br>
connected to the oncoming torque providing shafts and the shaft connected to<br>
the output member, must be synchronized. Once the clutch connective<br>
surfaces attached to these shafts have been attenuated and are moving at the<br>
same rotational velocity, clamping force can begin to be applied to the clutch<br>
to bring the clutch to a locked state and begin increasing the torque capacity of<br>
the clutch. As described above with regards to avoiding slip during a torque<br>
phase, clutch capacity must be increased before reactive torque to the clutch<br>
can be increased. In order to enable the application of input torques resulting<br>
in a reactive torque across the clutch as rapidly as possible, an increase in<br>
clutch capacity can be commanded anticipatorily to achieve an initial increase<br>
in clutch capacity coincident with the clutch reaching a locked state. Reactive<br><br>
torques, taking into account reaction times by utilizing a lead period by the<br>
method disclosed herein, can then be timely commanded with a short lag to<br>
follow increasing clutch torque capacity. An exemplary embodiment of this<br>
method, acting in reverse of the limits imposed to torque requests as described<br>
in FIG. 5, imposes limits upon the torque requests which can be issued to the<br>
engine and to the electric machine according to a calibrated ramp rate, selected<br>
to avoid slip. As depicted in FIG. 6, a clutch reactive torque immediate<br>
min/max acting as a constraint upon electric machine torque requests is<br>
increased after a calibrated lead period from the initiation of an increasing<br>
clutch reactive torque lead immediate min/max acting as a constraint upon<br>
engine torque requests. By utilizing the lead period, the increase in input<br>
torques from the engine and the electric machine increase reactive torque<br>
applied to the clutch substantially simultaneously, according to the methods<br>
disclosed herein. As the limits upon the torque generating devices are lifted<br>
according to the calibrated ramp rate applied to each limit, the HCP can<br>
command the engine and the electric machine to fulfill a portion of the<br>
reactive torque required from the clutch, each up to the respective maximum.<br>
In this way, torque requests to the engine and the electric machine are<br>
coordinated in order to compensate for reaction times in order to increase<br>
input torques from each substantially simultaneously through a shift event.<br>
[0069] The calibrated ramp rate utilized in the above exemplary transmission<br>
shift is a selected value which will adjust input torque levels to the desired<br>
range quickly, but also will stay below the torque capacity for the clutch so as<br>
to avoid slip. The ramp rate may be developed experimentally, empirically,<br>
predictively, through modeling or other techniques adequate to accurately<br><br>
predict engine and electric machine operation, and a multitude of ramp rates<br>
might be used by the same hybrid powertrain, depending upon different engine<br>
settings, conditions, or operating ranges and behavior of the control system<br>
actuating the clutch torque capacity. The ramp rate used to decrease input<br>
torques in an unlocking event can but need not be an inverse of the ramp rate<br>
used to increase input torques in a locking event. Similarly, the lead period<br>
used to coordinate input torques can but need not be the same time span value<br>
utilized in both transmission transitional states and can be varied according to<br>
particular behaviors of a vehicle and its components.<br>
[0070] As described above, during a transmission shift, for example,<br>
between two fixed gear states as defined in the exemplary transmission<br>
described above, the transmission passes through an inertia speed phase<br>
between a first torque phase and a second torque phase. During this inertia<br>
speed phase, the originally applied clutch and the clutch to be applied are in an<br>
unlocked state, and the input is initially spinning with a rotational velocity that<br>
was shared across the first clutch just prior to becoming unsynchronized. in<br>
order to accomplish synchronization within the second clutch to be applied<br>
and loaded in the second torque phase, inputs to be connected to the second<br>
clutch must change NI to match the driveline attached through the<br>
transmission at some new gear ratio. A number of methods are known in the<br>
art to accomplish this synchronization. However, within a shift in a hybrid<br>
powertrain transmission, shifts usually occur through range operating state<br>
where at least one clutch is still applied while another clutch is in an inertia<br>
speed phase. This means that changes to the various torque generative devices<br>
required to create synchronization in the input speed and output speed of the<br><br>
second clutch still impact vehicle performance in the inertia speed phase<br>
through the still applied clutch. Therefore, the methods described herein to<br>
utilize a lead period to effect changes to input torques substantially<br>
simultaneously can additionally present advantages to drivability can continue<br>
to be utilized through an inertia speed phase.<br>
[0071] An exemplary method to accomplish this synchronization through an<br>
inertia speed phase of a transmission shift is graphically depicted in FIG. 7, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure. The effects of the transmission shift<br>
upon two terms descriptive of the shifting process are illustrated in two<br>
sections with a common timescale. The top section depicts N|, initially<br>
connected through the first, initially applied clutch. The upper dotted line<br>
represents the velocity profile of NI while the first clutch is in a locked state<br>
before initiation of the shift. The bottom dotted line represents the velocity<br>
profile of NI that must be achieved to synchronize the input speed with the<br>
output speed of the second clutch. The transition between the two dotted lines<br>
represents the change to input speed that must take place to accomplish the<br>
shift. The bottom section of FIG. 7 depicts input acceleration (NI_DOT), or a<br>
derivative with respect to time of NI. NI_DOT is described in this case as the<br>
input acceleration immediate or the acceleration profile driven with a<br>
relatively quick reaction time by an electric machine or machines, and the<br>
term closely tracks actual NI_DOT. The input acceleration immediate shows the<br>
change in the rate of speed which must be accomplished in order to transition<br>
the NI from an initial NI at the synchronous state with the first clutch to a<br>
target input speed at the synchronous state with the second clutch. The initial<br>
flat portion describes the acceleration with which the input speed is increased<br><br>
before the initiation of the shift, and this constant value reflects the slope of<br>
the input speed in the left portion of the top section of the FIG. 7. At the time<br>
of the initiation of the shift, based upon operator input such as pedal position<br>
and algorithms within the transmission control system, including determining<br>
a preferred operating range state, a determination is made regarding target<br>
input speed that will be required to achieve synchronization and the target<br>
input acceleration profile required to accomplish the shift. An input<br>
acceleration rate, calculated to support a target acceleration rate after the shift<br>
is completed, can be termed an input acceleration lead predicted and describes<br>
the NI_DOT that needs to exist after the inertia speed phase is completed. The<br>
input acceleration lead immediate is predicted through an algorithm factoring<br>
in operator requested torque, the preferred operating range state being<br>
transitioned to, and other relevant variables. Because, as described in the top<br>
portion of FIG. 7, NI must be changed through the inertia speed phase to<br>
accomplish the shift and because NI_DOT describes the rate of change of the NI,<br>
the NI_DOT of the device being controlled during the inertia speed phase must<br>
reflect the input speed change to be accomplished through the inertia speed<br>
phase. In the exemplary data displayed in FIG. 7, wherein the input speed<br>
needs to be reduced to accomplish the transmission shift, the NNI_DOT of the<br>
device necessarily must change to a negative value representing the change in<br>
NI. Once NI has been reduced to a level enabling transition to the target input<br>
speed needed for synchronizing the input and output speeds, the NNI_DOT<br>
changes to match the input acceleration lead predicted. In this way, NI and<br>
NNI_DOT can be controlled through an inertia speed phase to match a target input<br><br>
speed and target input acceleration necessary to achieve a smooth transmission<br>
shift.<br>
[0072] As described above, a transmission shift in a hybrid powertrain<br>
transmission requires transition between operating range states, wherein an<br>
inertia speed phase must be accomplished as described above, while at least<br>
one clutch is still applied and transferring torque from the torque producing<br>
devices to the driveline. Changes to input torques, driven by torque requests<br>
to the various torque generating devices, must accomplish both the required NI<br>
and NI_DOT changes and maintain drivability throughout the inertia speed<br>
phase. Therefore, exemplary methods described herein to utilize a lead period<br>
to effect changes to input torques substantially simultaneously can be utilized<br>
through an inertia speed phase to effect torque request changes to the various<br>
torque producing devices in order to effect substantially simultaneous changes<br>
to the input torques. FIG. 7 illustrates coordinating torque producing device<br>
reaction times, and a lead period calibrated to the difference in the related<br>
reaction times, to improve drivability in a transmission shift. An engine, as<br>
described above, includes the greater reaction time among torque generating<br>
devices. In order to adjust the NI and NI_DOT as quickly as possible to achieve<br>
the target speed and acceleration values for the shift, an input acceleration lead<br>
immediate is predicted through an algorithm. This input acceleration lead<br>
immediate includes the reaction time of the engine to changes in torque<br>
requests, and profiles the most rapid change in NI and NI_DOT in the lead<br>
device that can be accomplished to reach the target values. This rapid change<br>
in NI must include the aforementioned reaction time in the engine to changes<br>
in torque requests and the time the engine will take to accelerate or decelerate<br><br>
through the input acceleration lead immediate. As depicted in FIG. 7, the<br>
input acceleration lead immediate, in anticipation of a pending shift, can<br>
initiate requisite commands to the engine in anticipation of the inertia speed<br>
phase, as the resulting input torque from the engine will not begin to reduce<br>
until later, due to the relatively long engine reaction time. Once the input<br>
acceleration lead immediate has been determined, an input acceleration<br>
immediate, following the input acceleration lead immediate by a lead period,<br>
calibrated to reaction times as described above, can be utilized to control the<br>
electric machine to match changes in NI and NI_DOT at substantially the same<br>
time as the response from the engine. In this way, the engine and the electric<br>
machines are substantially synchronized in affecting the target input speed and<br>
target acceleration.<br>
[0073] The above methods describe cases in which a transmission is<br>
operating with a clutch or clutches engaged and with a torque being applied<br>
from at least one input torque to either an output torque or between torque<br>
generating devices. However, a neutral operating range state is known<br>
wherein all clutches are unlocked and no torque is being applied through the<br>
transmission. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that for<br>
various reasons, either the engine or an electric machine can be set to an idle<br>
or operational state in a neutral condition, and that portions of the transmission<br>
attached to the running device can continue to spin. In such a neutral<br>
operating state, such portions of the transmission can apply little resistance to<br>
the spinning device and can quickly accelerate to a high rotational speed.<br>
Such portions of the transmission rotating at high speeds can cause a variety of<br>
issues, including noise and vibrations issues, damage to the spinning parts, or<br><br>
the spinning parts, storing kinetic energy, can cause a perceptible jerk in the<br>
transmission if subsequently connected through a clutch. The above methods,<br>
monitoring portions of the powertrain and issuing lead and immediate control<br>
signals to the torque generating devices in order to maintain control over the<br>
torques and speeds of the various portions of the powertrain, can be applied in<br>
the neutral operating range state to monitor speed of various components,<br>
monitored or predicted as a clutch slip acceleration lead predicted and by<br>
imposing limits upon clutch slip acceleration in a lead control signal as a<br>
clutch slip acceleration lead immediate and an immediate control signal as a<br>
clutch slip acceleration immediate. Operated in this way, a powertrain can be<br>
controlled through a neutral operating range state, maintaining speed of<br>
various portions of the transmission within a preferred range.<br>
[0074] The above methods describe torque management processes as a<br>
comparison of positive values. It will be appreciated by one having ordinary<br>
skill in the art that clutch torques are described as positive and negative<br>
torques, signifying torques applied in one rotational direction or the other.<br>
The above method can be used in either positive or negative torque<br>
applications, where the magnitudes of the torques are modulated in such a way<br>
that the magnitude of the applied reactive torque does not exceed the<br>
magnitude of the torque capacity for a particular clutch. One particular<br>
corollary to minimum and maximum reactive torque values is illustrated in<br>
FIG. 8. FIG. 8 graphically illustrates an instance in which an input<br>
acceleration lead immediate has been determined for engine control through<br>
an inertia speed phase, and additionally, a corresponding input acceleration<br>
immediate has been determined for electric machine control through the<br><br>
inertia speed phase. In an instance where negative NI_DOT or deceleration is<br>
occurring to the engine in an inertia speed phase, this condition is most<br>
commonly an instance where the engine is simply being allowed to slow down<br>
by internal frictional and pumping forces within the engine. However, when<br>
an electric machine is decelerating, this condition is most commonly<br>
accomplished with the electric machine still under power, or conversely,<br>
operating in a regeneration mode. Because the electric machine is still<br>
operating under system control and with implications with the rest of vehicle's<br>
systems, the motor is still subject to systemic restraints, for instance, battery<br>
power available to drive the motor. FIG. 8 imposes such a systemic restraint<br>
in the minimum input acceleration constraint. Where such a restraint<br>
interferes with the input acceleration immediate, algorithms within the electric<br>
machine control system modify the input acceleration immediate to<br>
accommodate the constraint. Once the constraint no longer limits electric<br>
machine operation within the input acceleration immediate, the algorithm<br>
operates to recover the NI_DOT to the effect the desired changes to NI.<br>
[0075] FIG. 9 shows a control system architecture for controlling and<br>
managing torque and power flow in a powertrain system having multiple<br>
torque generative devices, described hereinbelow with reference to the hybrid<br>
powertrain system shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, and residing in the aforementioned<br>
control modules in the form of executable algorithms and calibrations. The<br>
control system architecture can be applied to any powertrain system having<br>
multiple torque generative devices, including, e.g., a hybrid powertrain system<br>
having a single electric machine, a hybrid powertrain system having multiple<br>
electric machines, and non-hybrid powertrain systems.<br><br>
[0076] The control system architecture of FIG. 9 depicts a flow of pertinent<br>
signals through the control modules. In operation, the operator inputs to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the<br>
operator torque request ('TO_REQ'). Operation of the engine 14 and the<br>
transmission 10 are monitored to determine the input speed ('N|') and the<br>
output speed ('No'). A strategic optimization control scheme ('Strategic<br>
Control') 310 determines a preferred input speed ('NI_DOT') and a preferred<br>
engine state and transmission operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des')<br>
based upon the output speed and the operator torque request, and optimized<br>
based upon other operating parameters of the hybrid powertrain, including<br>
battery power limits and response limits of the engine 14, the transmission 10,<br>
and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The strategic<br>
optimization control scheme 310 is preferably executed by the HCP 5 during<br>
each 100 ms loop cycle and each 25 ms loop cycle.<br>
[0077] The outputs of the strategic optimization control scheme 310 are used<br>
in a shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme ('Shift Execution and<br>
Engine Start/Stop') 320 to command changes in the transmission operation<br>
('Transmission Commands') including changing the operating range state.<br>
This includes commanding execution of a change in the operating range state<br>
if the preferred operating range state is different from the present operating<br>
range state by commanding changes in application of one or more of the<br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 and other transmission commands.<br>
The present operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Actual') and an input<br>
speed profile ('NI_PROF') can be determined. The input speed profile is an<br>
estimate of an upcoming input speed and preferably comprises a scalar<br><br>
parametric value that is a targeted input speed for the forthcoming loop cycle.<br>
The engine operating commands and the operator torque request are based<br>
upon the input speed profile during a transition in the operating range state of<br>
the transmission.<br>
[0078] A tactical control scheme ('Tactical Control and Operation') 330 is<br>
repeatedly executed during one of the control loop cycles to determine engine<br>
commands ('Engine Commands') for operating the engine, including a<br>
preferred input torque from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 based upon<br>
the output speed, the input speed, and the operator torque request and the<br>
present operating range state for the transmission. The engine commands also<br>
include engine states including one of an all-cylinder operating state and a<br>
cylinder deactivation operating state wherein a portion of the engine cylinders<br>
are deactivated and unfueled, and engine states including one of a fueled state<br>
and a fuel cutoff state.<br>
[0079] A clutch torque ('TCL') for each clutch is estimated in the TCM 17,<br>
including the presently applied clutches and the non-applied clutches, and a<br>
present engine input torque ('TI') reacting with the input member 12 is<br>
determined in the ECM 23. A motor torque control scheme ('Output and<br>
Motor Torque Determination') 340 is executed to determine the preferred<br>
output torque from the powertrain ('TO_CMD')&gt; which includes motor torque<br>
commands ('TA','TB') for controlling the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72 in this embodiment. The preferred output torque is based upon the<br>
estimated clutch torque(s) for each of the clutches, the present input torque<br>
from the engine 14, the present operating range state, the input speed, the<br>
operator torque request, and the input speed profile. The first and second<br><br>
electric machines 56 and 72 are controlled through the TPIM 19 to meet the<br>
preferred motor torque commands based upon the preferred output torque.<br>
The motor torque control scheme 340 includes algorithmic code which is<br>
regularly executed during the 6.25 ms and 12.5 ms loop cycles to determine<br>
the preferred motor torque commands.<br>
[0080] FIG. 10 is a schematic diagram exemplifying data flow through a<br>
shift execution, describing more detail exemplary execution of the control<br>
system architecture such as the system of FIG. 9 in greater detail, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure. Powertrain control system 400 is<br>
illustrated comprising several hybrid drive components, including an engine<br>
410, an electric machine 420, and clutch hydraulics 430. Control modules<br>
strategic control module 310, shift execution module 450, clutch capacity<br>
control module 460, tactical control and operation module 330, output and<br>
motor torque determination module 340, and clutch control module 490, are<br>
illustrated, processing information and issuing control commands to engine<br>
410, electric machine 420, and clutch hydraulics 430. These control modules<br>
can be physically separate, can be grouped together in a number of different<br>
control devices, or can be entirely performed within a single physical control<br>
device. Module 310, a strategic control module, performs determinations<br>
regarding preferred powertrain operating points and preferred operating range<br>
states as described in FIG. 9. Module 450, a shift execution module, receives<br>
input from strategic control module 310 and other sources regarding shift<br>
initiation. Module 450 processes inputs regarding the reactive torque<br>
currently applied to the clutch and the preferred operating range state to be<br>
transitioned to. Module 450 then employs an algorithm, determining<br><br>
parameters for the execution of the shift, including hybrid range state<br>
parameters describing the balance of input torques required of the torque<br>
providing devices, details regarding a target input speed and input acceleration<br>
lead predicted required to execute the transition to the preferred operating<br>
range state, an input acceleration lead immediate as previously described, and<br>
clutch reactive torque lead immediate min/max and clutch reactive torque<br>
immediate min/max values as previously described. From module 450. clutch<br>
reactive torque parameters and hybrid range state information are fed to clutch<br>
capacity control module 460, lead control parameters and signals are fed to<br>
tactical control and operation module 330, and immediate control parameters<br>
and signals are fed to output and motor torque determination module 340.<br>
Clutch capacity control module 460 processes reactive torque and hybrid<br>
range state information and generates logic describing clutch reactive torque<br>
limits enabling engine control through module 330, electric machine control<br>
through module 340, and clutch control through module 490, in accordance<br>
with methods described herein. Tactical control and operation module 330<br>
includes means to issue torque requests and execute limits upon input torque<br>
supplied from engine 410, and feed, additionally, describe the input torque<br>
supplied from the engine to module 340 for use in control of electric machine<br>
420. Output and motor torque determination module 340 likewise receives<br>
and processes information to issue electric machine torque requests to electric<br>
machine 420. Additionally, module 340 generates clutch reactive torque<br>
commands for use by clutch control module 490. Module 490 processes<br>
information from modules 460 and 340 and issues hydraulic commands in<br>
order to achieve the required clutch torque capacity required to operate the<br><br>
transmission. This particular embodiment of data flow illustrates one possible<br>
exemplary process by which a vehicular torque generative devices and related<br>
clutches can be controlled in accordance with the method disclosed herein. It<br>
will be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art that the particular<br>
process employed can vary, and this disclosure is not intended to limited to the<br>
particular exemplary embodiment described herein.<br>
[0081] Control of a powertrain system, such as the exemplary hybrid<br>
powertrain described above in FIGS. 1 and 2, requires selection and balancing<br>
of a number of variable control parameters. FIG. 11 schematically illustrates<br>
an exemplary hybrid powertrain configuration including power loss terms<br>
useful in calculating various powertrain settings, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure. There is a first power flow path from a fuel storage system<br>
9 which transfers fuel power ('PFUEL') to the engine 14 which transfers input<br>
power ('PI') to the transmission 10. The power loss in the first flow path<br>
comprises engine power losses ('PLOSS ENG'). There is a second power flow<br>
path which transfers electric power ('PBATT') from the ESD 74 to the TPIM 19<br>
which transfers electric power ('PIN ELEC') to the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 which transfer motor power ('PMOTOR MECH ') to the<br>
transmission 10. The power losses in the second power flow path include<br>
battery power losses ('PLOSS BATT') and electric motor power losses ('PLOSS<br>
MOTOR')- The TPIM 19 has an electric power load ('PHV LOAD') that services<br>
electric loads in the system ('HV Loads'), which can include a low voltage<br>
battery storage system (not shown). The transmission 10 has a mechanical<br>
inertia power load input ('PINERTIA') in the system ('Inertia Storage') that<br>
preferably include inertias from the engine 14 and the transmission 10. The<br><br>
transmission 10 has a mechanical power losses ('PLoss MECH') and power<br>
output ('POUT') which can be affected by brake power losses ('PLOss BRAKE')<br>
when being transferred to the driveline in the form of axle power ('PAXLE')-<br>
[0082] The power cost inputs to the cost function 450 are determined based<br>
upon factors related to vehicle drivability, fuel economy, emissions, and<br>
battery usage. Power costs are assigned and associated with fuel and<br>
electrical power consumption and are associated with a specific operating<br>
points of the hybrid powertrain. Lower operating costs can be associated with<br>
lower fuel consumption at high conversion efficiencies, lower battery power<br>
usage, and lower emissions for each engine speed/load operating point, and<br>
take into account the candidate operating state of the engine 14. As described<br>
hereinabove, the power costs may include the engine power losses ('PLOSS<br>
ENG'), electric motor power losses ('PLoss MOTOR'), battery power losses ('PLOSS<br>
BATT'), brake power losses ('PLOSS BRAKE'), and mechanical power losses<br>
('PLOSS MECH') associated with operating the hybrid powertrain at a specific<br>
operating point which includes, for example, in the exemplary powertrain<br>
described above: NI, NA, NB, TI, TA, TB, a transmission operating range state<br>
and an engine state.<br>
[0083] As described above, changes in transmission operating range states<br>
involve transitioning clutches. According to the exemplary four clutch<br>
transmission described above, in reference to Table 1 and FIG. 4, a number of<br>
transitions between operating range states are foreseeable. In transition from<br>
one operating range state to another operating range state, at least one clutch is<br>
initially engaged, and at least one clutch is transitioned according to a process,<br>
such as the exemplary process of FIG. 5, from a locked state to an unlocked<br><br>
state and at least one clutch is transitioned according to a process, such as the<br>
exemplary process of FIG. 6, from an unlocked state to a locked state. In the<br>
interim period, clutches can pass through a neutral state, but such a change is<br>
not preferable due to impacts to drivability and losses in efficiency caused by<br>
unloading and re-loading the engine in a wasteful use of fuel not contributing<br>
to the output of the powertrain. Instead, utilizing an inertia speed phase as<br>
described above in the exemplary process of FIG. 7 allows for continued<br>
transmission of torque from torque generative devices to the output throughout<br>
the change in transmission operating range states. In this way, waste and<br>
adverse impacts associated with changes through neutral can be avoided.<br>
[0084] In FIG. 11 above, a process is described which compares losses or<br>
costs to determine preferable powertrain settings. One such process can be<br>
implemented to select operating range state in a transmission. A desired<br>
operating range state can be selected based upon the losses or costs associated<br>
with selecting various operating range states. Within an exemplary control<br>
system such as depicted in FIG. 9, a strategic control module 310 monitors<br>
inputs regarding current powertrain operation and communicates the desired<br>
range state and a desired input acceleration to shift execution. Shift execution<br>
coordinates the effort of tactical control and motor torque determination along<br>
with controlling the transmission clutches to sequence and achieve the desired<br>
range state.<br>
[0085] A control module determining a desired operating state range based<br>
upon costs associated with different operating range states monitors inputs<br>
regarding current powertrain operation and communicates the desired range<br>
state to shift execution. In the context of coordinating synchronous shifting<br><br>
within a transmission, including quantifying power losses or inefficiencies<br>
associated with particular operating range states, the inputs most relevant to<br>
powertrain operation describe matching NI to NO through the gear ratio of the<br>
selected operating range state within a time span and in the context of<br>
changing powertrain operation set by an accelerator input. FIG. 12<br>
graphically illustrates exemplary powertrain operation through a transmission<br>
shift, including terms descriptive of costs associated with powertrain operation<br>
through the shift and at the desired operating range state, in accordance with<br>
the present disclosure. The exemplary shift illustrated describes the above<br>
described exemplary hybrid powertrain shifting from EVT Mode 2 to EVT<br>
Mode 1 through a transitory second fixed gear state in accordance with<br>
shifting described in FIG. 4 and Table 1. As the shift is initiated, clutch C2 is<br>
engaged. In order to synchronously engage clutch C1 in accordance with a<br>
shift to the second fixed gear, an inertia speed phase is initiated in clutch C1,<br>
wherein NI is changed to match NO adjusted by the gear ratio of the second<br>
fixed gear, the requisite speed change in NI being described by the difference<br>
between the horizontal line originally occupied and a dotted line representing<br>
the second fixed gear for the current NO. The slope of the line associated with<br>
the second fixed gear describes a gradual deceleration of the powertrain over<br>
some time span through the shift. Once clutch C1 is synchronized and locked<br>
in accordance with the dotted line representing the second fixed gear, as<br>
described at the end of the oncoming clutch engagement period, the<br>
transmission is in the second fixed gear and can begin the shift from the<br>
second fixed gear to EVT Mode 1. Through the off-going clutch<br>
disengagement, clutch C2 is unlocked through a method such as the exemplary<br><br>
method of FIG. 5. Once clutch C2 is unlocked, clutch C1 remains engaged,<br>
and the transmission operates in EVT Mode 1, and engine commands drive NI<br>
to a preset selected speed for EVT Mode 1.<br>
[0086] Every transition within a transmission and an engine creates<br>
inefficiencies. Adjustments to engine speed, particularly adjustments outside<br>
of fuel efficient operation into less efficient operation, lower work output for a<br>
given amount of fuel and create displeasing transitional jerks and sounds to the<br>
customer registering as an adverse impact to drivability. Shifts through<br>
neutral, if required, consume fuel through operation of the engine without<br>
performing work upon the output shaft. Any shift, even if torque to an output<br>
shaft is not interrupted, creates potential for adverse impacts to drivability and<br>
usually require changes to NI through engine speed changes, as described<br>
above. Because transmission shifts, particularly transmission shifts occurring<br>
during a change in desired NO, involve values that change as a function of<br>
time, a projection of costs through a potential shift requires an understanding<br>
of the time spans involved in the shift.<br>
[0087] In order to estimate time spans through a transmission shift, time<br>
spans of individual events through the shift can be estimated. Using the<br>
exemplary shift of FIG. 12 as an example, the relevant time spans through the<br>
shift needed to evaluated the costs of the potential shift include the inertia<br>
speed phase from EVT Mode 2 state to the second fixed gear state; the on-<br>
coming clutch engagement period associated with engaging clutch C1; and the<br>
off-going clutch disengagement associated with disengaging clutch C2 Once<br>
C2 is released, EVT Mode 1 is achieved, and the shift can be considered<br>
complete. Referring still to FIG. 12, the time necessary to complete the inertia<br><br>
speed phase can be estimated by quantifying the change required of NI. This<br>
change required of NI can be estimated by determining the NI that would be<br>
immediately required in the destination gear based upon NO and the gear ratio<br>
of the destination gear and projecting based upon accelerator position pedal<br>
what NI can be achieved through an inertia speed phase. This projection can<br>
be utilized through a look-up table and can be developed experimentally,<br>
empirically, predictively, through modeling or other techniques adequate to<br>
accurately predict engine and transmission operation, and a multitude of<br>
calibration curves might be used by the same engine for different settings,<br>
conditions, or operating ranges. Alternatively, the projection can be<br>
performed by an algorithm or computational model quantifying the transitions<br>
necessary to complete the inertia speed phase. In the exemplary transmission<br>
shift of FIG. 12, an initial NI delta can be quantified, based upon an initial No,<br>
and a change required in NI can be projected based upon the initial NI delta<br>
and an accelerator pedal position describing a desired change in NO. Based<br>
upon these values, a time necessary to complete the inertia speed change can<br>
be estimated. This inertia speed change time, in addition to clutch engagement<br>
and disengagement times, easily estimable from known clutch operation, can<br>
be summed to estimate the time until EVT Mode 1 is achieved and NI at EVT<br>
Mode 1 achieved. NI at the potential destination operating range state<br>
achieved along with the behavior of NI throughout the transmission shift<br>
describes the engine commands and fuel consumption that will occur through<br>
a shift. NI at the potential destination operating range state achieved also<br>
describes a projected engine speed through the shift, and this engine speed can<br>
be compared with allowable engine speeds to determine whether the shift is<br><br>
possible without a shift through neutral. The projection of times and NI<br>
behavior through a shift event can be projected through multiple destination<br>
range states, and the behavior of NI and the shift times can be used to project<br>
costs associated with each potential operating range state. In this way,<br>
transitions to multiple operating range states can be evaluated and selected<br>
from based upon projected costs of each potential transmission shift.<br>
[0088] FIG. 14 illustrates in tabular form use of an exemplary 2D look-up<br>
table to determine inertia speed phase times, in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure. Accelerator pedal position and the initial NI delta allow<br>
projection of a change required in NI, as describe above, which, in turn, allows<br>
estimation of an inertia speed phase time. Based upon the given inputs, an<br>
estimated inertia speed phase time can be estimated. Values of the initial NI<br>
delta in the look-up table can span positive and negative values, allowing for<br>
different calibrations according to upshifts and downshifts.<br>
[0089] The anticipated change in No, for example through a prediction or<br>
profile of output deceleration, indicated by accelerator pedal position has a<br>
direct impact on whether a particular potential shift is preferable. FIG. 13<br>
graphically illustrates two different deceleration events, one a light<br>
deceleration maneuver and a second an aggressive deceleration maneuver, and<br>
the impacts upon NI through the potential shifts, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure. An analysis of NI through a light deceleration maneuver<br>
and projected transmission shifting to a desired operating range state, as<br>
depicted in the top portion of the graph, indicates no violation of NI with either<br>
a minimum allowable input speed or a maximum allowable input speed.<br>
Minimum and maximum allowable input speeds will often be determined by<br><br>
the resulting engine speeds and the limits of the engine. By contrast, an<br>
analysis of NI through an aggressive deceleration maneuver a projected<br>
transmission shifting to a desired operating range state, as depicted in the<br>
bottom portion of the graph, indicates that a predicted minimum input speed<br>
would drop below the minimum allowable input speed before completion of<br>
the shift. This violation of the minimum allowable input speed can be utilized<br>
to flag this potential transmission shift as not preferred due to an excessive<br>
cost associated with the fuel inefficiencies and adverse impacts to drivability<br>
that would be incurred by the NI violation. The graphical depiction of<br>
determining NI at EVT Mode 1 achieved can be reconstructed mathematically.<br>
For example, in the exemplary shifts of FIG. 13, prediction of NI at the point<br>
EVT Mode 1 is achieved can be expressed through the following equation:<br>
NI_MI Achieved = (NO_Current + NO_DOT * ShiftTimeEstimate) * Gear2Ratio	[2]<br>
As described above, this predicted input speed can used to judge whether the<br>
input speed will violate minimum and maximum allowed values.<br>
Additionally, the impact of the predicted input speed can be compared to fuel<br>
consumption impacts, drivability impacts, predicted noise and vibration<br>
impacts, and other factors that can be evaluated and calibrated into cost terms<br>
and predictive tables.<br>
[0090] The methods described above to evaluate costs associated with<br>
transmission shifts can be utilized similarly in shifts to and from different<br>
operating range states. FIG. 15 graphically illustrates exemplary powertrain<br>
operation through a transmission shift, including illustration of time spans<br><br>
relative to defining costs through the shift, in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure. The shift illustrated in FIG. 15 differs from the shift illustrated in<br>
FIG. 12 because the initial state of the clutch is in a third fixed gear. As a<br>
result, the time necessary to complete the shift is lengthened by the additional<br>
off-going clutch release associated with shifting from the third fixed gear into<br>
the inertia speed phase. FIG. 16 graphically illustrates exemplary powertrain<br>
operation through an additional transmission shift, including illustration of a<br>
time span relative to defining costs through the shift, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure. The shift illustrated in FIG. 16 is a simple shift from a<br>
second fixed gear, with two clutches applied, to EVT Mode 1. Because the<br>
only transition required to shift from the second fixed gear to EVT Mode 1 is a<br>
release of a single clutch, and, as described above, once the shift is in a<br>
destination state with a single clutch applied and no costs are incurred, the<br>
only time relevant to cost of the shift is the off-going clutch release time.<br>
[0091] The above methods to determine costs associated with different<br>
potential operating range states can be used at any time to aid evaluation of<br>
whether a transition to one operating range state is desired as compared to the<br>
present operating range state. However, it will be appreciated that the current<br>
operating range state is not a required input to the determination, as NI<br>
independent of the current operating range state is utilized in the<br>
determination. Additionally, it will be appreciated that not all calculations are<br>
required to be run for every determination. Where No or output acceleration<br>
(NO_DOT) are determinative according to calibrated thresholds, indicating<br>
operation there NI in the potential operating range state is not feasible, then the<br>
prediction of NI at the achieved operating range state can be disabled.<br><br>
[0092] Many relationships of predicted NI resulting from shifts to potential<br>
operating range states are envisioned. One particular cost that can be<br>
quantified through the above method is a likelihood that NI, as a result of the<br>
transmission shift, will drop below a minimum input speed. Viewing this<br>
result as preferable to avoid, a penalty cost can be defined as a scalar<br>
likelihood that selection of a transmission shift to a destination operating range<br>
state will cause NI to drop below the minimum input speed. While a<br>
comparison can be made to the predicted NI at the destination operating range<br>
state achieved, one with ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that variables<br>
can change through the course of a deceleration, and use of a scalar term<br>
tending to avoid NI values close to the minimum input speed accounts for<br>
some of the uncertainty in the prediction of NI. A higher scalar penalty cost<br>
used to describe a high likelihood that NI will drop to these levels can be<br>
combined with other factors to dissuade the selection of that particular shift.<br>
In the exemplary control system described above in FIG. 9, this deceleration<br>
penalty cost can be combined with other costs that are determined within<br>
strategic control for the purpose of determining a desired range state.<br>
[0093] FIG. 17 graphically illustrates an exemplary relationship between<br>
predicted input speeds at the destination operating range state achieved and<br>
penalty costs that can be assigned to the potential transmission shift, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure. As described above, a penalty cost<br>
can be associated with a predicted NI at a destination operating range state<br>
achieved as a measure of the risk of NI dropping below a minimum input<br>
speed. The shape of the curve depicted in FIG. 17 relates assignment of a<br>
penalty cost based upon a likelihood that NI will drop below the minimum<br><br>
level. A high predicted NI value makes the likelihood that NI will drop below<br>
the threshold level small. Therefore, a small cost penalty is appropriate. A<br>
low predicted NI value, such as a predicted value below the minimum input<br>
speed, makes the likelihood that NI will drop below the threshold level great.<br>
Therefore, a large cost penalty is appropriate. In cases wherein the predicted<br>
NI value is close to or within a certain range of the minimum input speed, then<br>
an intermediate cost penalty, calibrated to system behaviors, likelihoods of<br>
aggressive deceleration, the severity of incorrect predictions, and other factors,<br>
is appropriate. Such a calibrated curve can be employed in a series of ID<br>
look-up tables or can be utilized through a algorithm programmed with the<br>
calibrated information. FIG. 18 illustrates use of exemplary ID look-up tables<br>
to determine penalty cost values associated with potential destination<br>
operating range states, in accordance with the present disclosure. Using<br>
methods described above and utilizing inputs describing current conditions,<br>
known shift characteristics and predicted behavior of the input speed through<br>
the shift can be utilized to tabulate costs associated with a particular shift<br>
under certain deceleration profiles. The exemplary cost tables of FIG. 18<br>
input various operating range state transitions and, based upon predicted<br>
deceleration of the input speed, output penalty costs for various shifts given<br>
current conditions. By utilizing look-up tables as described by FIG. 18, a wide<br>
variety of potential shifts under any current condition can be quickly evaluated<br>
for selection.<br>
[0094] FIG. 19 illustrates an exemplary process whereby penalty costs for<br>
potential operating range state during a deceleration can be determined, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure. Process 500 starts in block 502. At<br><br>
block 504, a determination is made whether an output speed is within a<br>
calibratable maximum and minimum threshold, such that operation of the<br>
powertrain within the potential operating range state at that output speed is<br>
feasible. If the output speed is within the appropriate range, then the process<br>
proceeds to block 506, wherein a speed enable term is set to "MET". If the<br>
output speed is not within the appropriate range, then the process proceeds to<br>
block 508, wherein a speed enable term is set to "NOT MET". At block 510,<br>
a determination is made whether an output acceleration is less than a<br>
calibratable threshold, such that change in NI will not fall below a threshold<br>
level within a given amount of time. If the output acceleration is less than the<br>
threshold level, then the process proceeds to block 512, wherein an<br>
acceleration enable term is set to "MET". If the output acceleration is not less<br>
than the threshold level, then the process proceeds to block 514, wherein<br>
determination is made whether an output acceleration is greater than a<br>
calibratable threshold. If the output acceleration is greater than the<br>
calibratable threshold, then the process proceeds to block 516 wherein an<br>
acceleration enable term is set to "NOT MET". Blocks 512, 514, and 516<br>
advance the process to block 518. At block 518, if both the speed enable and<br>
acceleration enable terms are set to "MET", then the process proceeds to block<br>
520, wherein a penalty cost is calculated for the potential operating range state<br>
being evaluated. If both the speed enable and acceleration enable terms are<br>
not set to "MET", the process proceeds to block 522, wherein an indication is<br>
made that the penalty costs for the shift being evaluated was not calculated<br>
due to one of the criteria not being met. In the present exemplary<br>
embodiment, a decel penalty cost of zero, as opposed to a low but not zero<br><br>
value corresponding to a high predicted NI value, indicates that the criteria of<br>
the calculation were not met. Other values or flags can be used in different<br>
embodiments to indicate the same failure. At block 524, the process ends.<br>

the disclosure. The disclosure has been described with specific reference to<br>
the preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications<br>
and alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations<br>
