				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the wireless telecommunications field and, in particular, to the forwarding of short text messages to mobile subscribers in a cellular communications system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for Post Dated / deferred SMS with Network side support.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The SMS enables the mobile networks to route short text messages, each up to 160 alphanumeric characters long, over the signaling channels to or from mobile stations. If the SMS sender wants some message to be delayed / deferred or if he/she wants to send the message repeatedly in a periodic or non periodic interval, the message is stored in a Short Message Service Center (SMSC). The SMSC forwards the message to the mobile station at the pre-determined time as specified.<br>
At the present scenario SMS is sent immediately to the SMS receiver's User Equipment (UE). There is no network side implementation so that the delivery can be delayed / deferred at the SMSC, till a pre determined time.<br>
Without the concept of post dated / deferred SMS at the network side (this has neither been implemented in 3GPP nor in 3GPP2), a user would not be able to send an SMS at a later date / time and / or with a prescribed frequency (such as weekly, daily, monthly, etc.)<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
However the post dated / deferred SMS concept is now being implemented at the UE itself, which has certain limitations some of which are listed below:<br>
1)	If the Sender is on roaming, he will be charged as per the roaming charges,<br>
2<br><br>
which will be usually higher than the normal charges.<br>
2) If the UE is not in the coverage area, then the very purpose would not be served.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of this invention is, therefore, to provide a system and method for facilitating post dated / deferred SMS implemented from the network. The present invention provides for post dated / deferred SMS implementation in 3GPP networks, where the network has the flexibility to and provides to the sender the option of configuring the specific time and date, when the SMS is to be sent including the details such as how often the message has to be send (whether daily, weekly, etc.).<br>
The network should have a specific storage allocation for the SMS sender, until the network sends to the final recipient on the scheduled day / time. Accordingly, the invention proposed herein, on implementation, would be a fair source of income for the operator and would provide flexibility to the user. The present invention would provide for sending of SMS even if the sender’s UE is switched off at the particular instance of the message being sent by the network. Further, if the user is on Roaming mode, the charges would be comparatively higher than being able to set up a network based deferred SMS before the user leaves the home network.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for facilitating post dated / deferred SMS implementation in network wherein the network has the flexibility to and provides to a sender the option of configuring a specific time and date, when the SMS is to be sent including the details such as how often the message has to be send. The network has a specific storage allocation for the SMS sender.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for facilitating post dated / deferred<br>
3<br><br>
SMS implementation using the 3GPP protocol comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	achieving the functionality of deferred date, time, frequency and other information implementation using a new User Data Header; and<br>
(b)	achieving the functionality of deferred date, time, frequency and other information implementation using the reserved values &amp; different interpretation of Validity period.<br>
Once a Post dated SMS is submitted, the sender can request the network to delete any Post dated SMS from its storage and after submitting the Post Dated SMS, the sender can fetch any of the already submitted Post Dated SMS from the network &amp; modify it &amp; submit it again to the network with a same reference id. Fetching the Post Dated SMS from the network is based on the TP-MR where the network should have a method for the indication when the Post Dated SMS limit has been reached. Fetching the Post Dated SMS is achieved by getting the entire UDH corresponds to some valid TP-MR, which is stored in the UE or by some notification sent by the server.<br>
The fields used for the implementation are:<br>
1)	Validity Period (TP-VP)<br>
2)	Protocol Identifier (TP-PID)<br>
3)	Some modifications in the SMS_SUBMIT<br>
4)	Command Type (TP-CT) in the SMS_COMMAND and<br>
5)	Message Number (TP-MN).<br>
The Validity Period (TP-VP) is used by the network to mention the deferred date, time. The Protocol Identifier (TP-PID) consists of a pool of reserved values where a new Protocol Identifier, can denote a Post - dated message. The SMS_SUBMIT includes modifications which includes modifications in<br>
a)	TP-RD (Reject duplicates) for modifying the post dated message;<br>

For DELETING already sent Post Dated SMS, SMS_COMMAND packet shall be sent which can have the User Data - the TP-MR of the message which is to be deleted. Where a TP-Command is to delete any already submitted Post Dated short message Known by the combination of TP-CT, TP-MN, the SC shall send a Status Report indicating that the SM has been deleted if the original Submit SM request, requested a status Report. For MODIFYING already sent Post Dated SMS, first DELETING Step is performed then Clear it from the ME and then perform steps required for Adding.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a method of facilitating post dated / deferred SMS implementation in network using a new User Data Header where the fields used for the implementation are:<br>

These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Post dated SMS implementation is done using the 3GPP protocol. Implementation uses a new User Data Header to achieve this functionality, which has the deferred date, time, frequency (no. of times to be sent by network automatically) &amp; other information. It can also be achieved using the reserved values &amp; different interpretation of Validity period where the deferred date, time frequency (no. of<br>
8<br><br>
times to be sent by network automatically) &amp; other information. Once the Post dated SMS is submitted, the sender can request the network to delete any Post dated SMS from its storage. After submitting the Post Dated SMS, the sender can fetch any of the already submitted Post Dated SMS from the network &amp; modify it &amp; submit it again to the network with the same reference id.<br>
Fetching the Post Dated SMS from the network can be based on the TP-MR (Message Reference). Network should have a method for the indication when the Post Dated SMS limit has been reached. Fetching the Post Dated SMS can be achieved by getting the entire UDH corresponds to some valid TP-MR, which is stored in the UE. It can also be fetched by some notification sent by the server, for example, the same way as a WAP push for MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) indication. Network should able to delete all the Post Dated SMS, on the request raised by the sender. Post Dated SMS can be used for giving Wake up calls also.<br>
An attempt has been made hereunder to illustrate the working of the present invention trying in a 3GPP scenario based on TS 23.040 specification. This illustration explains the implementation of the present invention in 3GPP. Similar implementation is possible in 3GPP2 technology also.<br>
In 3GPP, the following fields can be used for the implementation of this invention.<br>
7)	Validity Period (TP-VP)<br>
8)	Protocol Identifier (TP-PID)<br>
9)	Some modifications in the SMS_SUBMIT<br>
10)	Command Type (TP-CT) in the SMS_COMMAND<br>
11)	Message Number (TP-MN)<br>
The following section explains the in fields in detail.<br>
2)	Validity Period (TP-VP) - This should be used by the network to mention the deferred date, time. Its value can be 05 H. (A reserved value). The<br>
9<br><br>
interpretation of this is explained later in this document.<br>
3)	Protocol Identifier (TP-PID) - There is a pool of reserved values (starting from 01001000 - 01011101). We can take any one value say (48H) as a new Protocol Identifier, which can denote a Post - dated message.<br>
4)	Few modifications in SMS_SUBMIT - These modifications can include<br>
a)	TP-RD (Reject duplicates) can be set to 0, because the maximum number of message possible are 28-1 (255), &amp; user can modify the post dated message.<br>
b)	TP-SRR (Status report) fields should be set to 1<br>
c)	Validity period - Using the reserved values, so that it can be interpreted in enhanced format.<br>
d)	Validity-Period-Format (TP-VPF) - The value will be 01H, i.e. enhanced format.<br>
SMS-SUBMITTPDU<br>

The TP-Validity Period comprises 7 octets. The presence of all octets is mandatory although they may not all be used. The first octet indicates the way in which the following 6 octets are used. Any reserved/unused bits or octets must be set to zero.<br>
Octet 1	TP-VP functionality indicator<br>
Bit 7 - Extension bit<br>
Set to 1 if the TP-VP functionality indicator is to be extended to another octet. A setting of 0 indicates that there are no more TP-VP functionality indicator extension octets to follow. Any such extension octet shall immediately follow the previous TP-VP functionality indicator.<br>
Bit 6 - Single shot SM<br>
Set to 1 if the SC is required to make up to one delivery attempt. The TP-Validity Period, where present, shall be applicable to the Single shot SM.<br>
12<br><br>
Bits 5, 4, 3 - Reserved<br>
Bits 2, 1, 0 -Validity Period Formats.<br>
Value		2 1 0<br>
bits<br>
0  0   0   No Validity Period specified<br>
0  0  1  Validity Period is as specified for the relative case. The following octet contains the TP-VP value as described in 9.2.3.12.1<br>
0  1  0 Validity period is relative in integer representation and the following octet contains the TP-VP value in the range 0 to 255 representing 0 to 255 seconds. A TP-VP value of zero is undefined and reserved for future use.<br>
0  1  1 Validity period is relative in semi-octet  representation. The following 3 octets contain the relative time in Hours, Minutes and Seconds giving the length of the validity period counted from when the SMS-SUBMIT is received by the SC. The representation of time uses the same representation as the Hours, Minutesand	Seconds	in	the TP-Service-Centre-Time-Stamp.<br>
1  0   0  Reserved<br>
1  0   1  Reserved<br>
1  1   0  Reserved<br>
1  1   1  Reserved<br>
The SC shall reject any Unsupported/ Reserved values received by returning the TP-VP not supported' TP-FCS value in the Submit SM Report for RP-Error<br>
13<br><br>
The Octet 1 will have:<br><br>
The frequency is determined by bit 3,4,5.<br>
Bit 3	Bit 4	Bit 5<br>
0	0	1			Daily<br>
0	1	0			Every week same day (After Every 7 days)<br>
0	1	1			Bi weekly<br>
1	1	1			INVALID Message..<br>
Other values			Reserved<br>
Octet 2 will have the value 244. Which will be interpreted as 52 weeks?  This is the relative format (which is suggested by Octet 1 - Bit 1, 2 with the values 0, 1 respectively.)<br>
Octet 3, 4, 5 will be used to mention - DD, MM, YY<br>
Octet 6, 7 will be used to mention HH:MM (in 24hrs format).<br>
5)	Changes in SMS_COMMAND<br>
14<br><br><br><br><br>
6) TP-MN (Message Number) - In Case of Post Dated SMS, TP-sMessage-Number should be the value of Message, which is supposed to be deleted or modified.<br>
One example how the Post dated SMS can be added/modified/deleted...<br>
Ø	For ADDING new postdated SMS, The new TP-PID (similar sto SMS_SUBMIT packet) shall have the following changes.<br>
v	Octet 1: Bit 2 (TP - RD) - Set to 0. (Reject Duplicates = 0).<br>
v	Octet 1: Bit 3,4(TP - VPF) - Set to 01 (Enhanced Format).<br>
v	Octet 1: Bit 5 (TP - SRR) - Set to 1.( Status Report Request = 1)<br>
v	Octet 1: Bit 6 (TP - UDH) - Set to 0. ( User Date Header Present)<br>
v	New TP-PID value:-Set to 48 H<br>
Once SMS-SUBMIT has been sent, the UE should store the Post Dated SMS in the sent folder with the TP-MR as the unique identifier.<br>
If UE receives RP-ERROR, then the Post Dated SMS which is just now stored in the Sent folder should be deleted.<br>
16<br><br>
If UE receives RP-ACK, it shows that the network has received the SMS.<br>
Ø	For DELETING already sent Post Dated SMS, SMS_COMMAND packet shall be sent which can have the User Data - the TP-MR of the message which I want to delete (Taking the Reference from the Post Dated SMS, stored in the ME and TP-CT (Command Type) can be 04H (the Reserved value).<br>
Ø	In the case where the case where a TP-Command is to Delete any already submitted Post Dated short message (Known by the combination of TP-CT, TP-MN, the SC shall send a Status Report indicating that the SM has been deleted if the original Submit SM request requested a status Report<br>
Ø	For MODIFYING already sent Post Dated SMS, First perform DELETING Steps. Clear it from the ME also &amp; then perform steps required for Adding.<br>

(starting from 01001000 - 01011101). We can take any one value say (48H) as a new Protocol Identifier, which can denote a Post - dated message.<br>
c.	Few modifications in SMS_SUBMIT - These modifications can include<br>
i. TP-RD (Reject duplicates) can be set to 0, because the maximum<br>
number of message possible are 28-1 (255), &amp; user can modify the<br>
post dated message, so duplicates are possible,<br>
ii. TPJJDHI  (User-Date-Header-Indicator) field should be set to 1, because we include a new UDH, which contains the necessary<br>
information for the post dated message,<br>
iii. TP-SRR (Status report) fields should be set to 1 iv. If any data compression needs to be acted upon the message, that also is very well possible<br>

MESSAGE RETENTION DAYS   -         Validity Period (in Days) - SEND<br>
DATE (in days), will be in term of total no of days. If the REOCCURRENCE FREQ is 1, then this value remains intact, if REOCCURRENCE FREQ is 2, MESSAGE RETENTION DAYS /= 7; if REOCCURRENCE FREQ is 3, MESSAGE RETENTION DAYS /= 14; Once the Message RETENTION DAYS . Once This value becomes ZERO. Stop sending further. Do not delete from the SERVER. Once the Validity Period is EXPIRED, the ME and the SERVER<br><br>
20<br><br><br><br>
should clean it up. Otherwise the DELETE should happen when the ME triggers the DELETE / MODIFY.<br>
MESSAGE LENGTH	-	The message length.<br>
7) Changes in SMS_COMMAND<br><br>
21<br><br><br><br><br><br>
8) TP-MN (Message Number) - In Case of Post Dated SMS, TP-Message-Number should be the value of Message, which is supposed to be deleted or modified.<br>
One example how the Post dated SMS can be added/modified/deleted...<br>
Ø	For ADDING new post dated SMS, The new TP-PID (similar to SMS_SUBMIT packet) shall have the following changes.<br>
v	Octet 1: Bit 5 (TP - SRR) - Set to 1.( Status Report Request = 1)<br>
v	Octet 1: Bit 6 (TP - UDH) - Set to 1.( User Date Header Present)<br>
v	Octet 1: Bit 2 (TP - RD) - Set to 0. (Reject Duplicates = 0).<br>
v	New TP-PID value:-Set to 48 H<br>
Once SMS-SUBMIT has been sent, the UE should store the Post Dated SMS in the sent folder with the TP-MR as the unique identifier.<br>
If UE receives RP-ERROR, then the Post Dated SMS which is just now stored in the Sent folder should be deleted.<br>
23<br><br>
If UE receives RP-ACK, it shows that the network has received the SMS.<br>
Ø	For DELETING already sent Post Dated SMS, SMS_COMMAND packet shall be sent which can have the User Data - the TP-MR of the message which I want to delete (Taking the Reference from the Post Dated SMS, stored in the ME and TP-CT (Command Type) can be 04H (the Reserved value).<br>
Ø	In the case where a TP-Command is to Delete, any already submitted Post Dated short message (Known by the combination of TP-CT, TP-MN, the SC shall send a Status Report indicating that the SM has been deleted if the original Submit SM request requested a status Report<br>
For MODIFYING already sent Post Dated SMS, First perform DELETING Steps. Clear it from the ME also &amp; then perform steps required for Adding.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
a)	Backward compatibility - As per the TS 23.040, Section 9.2.3.9<br>
“The MS will interpret reserved or unsupported values as the value 00000000 but shall store them exactly as received. The SC may reject messages with a TP-Protocol - Identifier containing a reserved value or one which is not supported”<br>
So the backward compatibility is achieved.<br>
b)	Interoperability ensured.<br>
c)	Value added service for the operator, so it’s a source of income.<br>
d)	Flexibility for the user, a good experience.<br>
e)	Considerably beneficial, when the user is in roaming or out of coverage area.<br>
f)	Even if the sender's mobile is switched off, there won’t be any problem.<br><br>
