BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a fan array fan section utilized in an airhandling<br>
system.<br>
Air-handling systems (also referred to as an air handler) have traditionally been<br>
used to condition buildings or rooms (hereinafter referred to as "structures"). An air-handling<br>
system is defined as a structure that includes components designed to work together in order to<br>
condition air as part of the primary system for ventilation of structures. The air-handling system<br>
may contain components such as cooling coils, heating coils, filters, humidifiers, fans, sound<br>
attenuators, controls, and other devices functioning to meet the needs of the structures. The<br>
air-handling system may be manufactured in a factory and brought to the structure to be<br>
installed or it may be built on site using the necessary devices to meet the functioning needs of<br>
the structure. The air-handling compartment 102 of the air-handling system includes the inlet<br>
plenum 112 prior to the fan inlet cone 104 and the discharge plenum 110. Within the airhandling<br>
compartment 102 is situated the fan unit 100 (shown as an inlet cone 104, a fan 106,<br>
and a motor 108), fan frame, and any appurtenance associated with the function of the fan (e.g.<br>
dampers, controls, settling means, and associated cabinetry). Within the fan 106 is a fan wheel<br>
(not shown) having at least one blade. The fan wheel has a fan wheel diameter that is<br>
measured from one side of the outer periphery of the fan wheel to the opposite side of the outer<br>
periphery of the fan wheel. The dimensions of the handling compartment 102 such as height,<br>
width, and airway length are determined by consulting fan manufacturers data for the type of fan<br>
selected.<br>
FIG. 1 shows an exemplary prior art air-handling system having a single fan unit<br>
100 housed in an air-handling compartment 102. For exemplary purposes, the fan unit 100 is<br>
shown having an inlet cone 104, a fan 106, and a motor 108. Larger structures, structures<br>
requiring greater air volume, or structures requiring higher or lower temperatures have generally<br>
needed a larger fan unit 100 and a generally correspondingly larger air-handling compartment<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, an air-handling compartment 102 is substantially divided into<br>
a discharge plenum 110 and an inlet plenum 112. The combined discharge plenum 110 and the<br>
inlet plenum 112 can be referred to as the airway path 120. The fan unit 100 may be situated in<br>
the discharge plenum 110 as shown), the inlet plenum 112, or partially within the inlet plenum<br>
112 and partially within the discharge plenum 110. The portion of the airway path 120 in which<br>
the fan unit 100 is positioned may be generically referred to as the "fan section" (indicated by<br>
reference numeral 114), The size of the inlet cone 104, the size of the fan 106, the size the<br>
motor 108, and the size of the fan frame (not shown) at least partially determine the length of<br>
the airway path 120. Filter banks 122 and/or cooling coils (not shown) may be added to the<br>
system either upstream or downstream of the fan units 100.<br>
For example, a first exemplary structure requiring 50,000 cubic feet per minute of<br>
airflow at six (6) inches water gage pressure would generally require a prior art air-handling<br>
compartment 102 large enough to house a 55 inch impeller, a 100 horsepower motor, and<br>
supporting framework. The prior art air-handling compartment 102, in turn would be<br>
approximately 92 inches high by 114 to147 inches wide and 106 to 112 inches long. The<br>
minimum length of the air-handling compartment 102 and/or airway path 120 would be dictated<br>
by published manufacturers data for a given fan type, motor size, and application. Prior art<br>
cabinet sizing guides show exemplary rules for configuring an air-handling compartment <br>
These rules are based on optimization, regulations, and experimentation.<br>
For example, a second exemplary structure includes a recirculation air handler<br>
used in semiconductor and pharmaceutical clean rooms requiring 26,000 cubic feet per minute<br>
at two (2) inches water gage pressure. This structure would generally require a prior art airhandling<br>
system with a air-handling compartment 102 large enough to house a 44 inch impeller,<br>
a 25 horsepower motor, and supporting framework. The prior art air-handling compartment 102,<br>
in turn would be approximately 78 inches high by 99 inches wide and 94 to 100 inches long.<br>
The minimum length of the air-handling compartment 102 and/or airway path 120 would be<br>
dictated by published manufacturers data for a given fan type, motor size and application. Prior<br>
art cabinet sizing guides show exemplary rules for configuring an air-handling compartment 102.<br>
These rules are based on optimization, regulations, and experimentation.<br>
These prior art air-handling systems have many problems including the following<br>
exemplary problems:<br>
• Because real estate (e.g. structure space) is extremely expensive, the<br>
larger size of the air-handling compartment 102 is extremely undesirable.<br>
• The single fan units 100 are expensive to produce and are generally<br>
custom produced for each job.<br>
• Single fan units 100 are expensive to operate.<br>
• Single fan units 100 are inefficient in that they only have optimal or peak<br>
efficiency over a small portion of their operating range.<br>
• If a single fan unit 100 breaks down, there is no air conditioning at all.<br>
• The low frequency sound of the large fan unit 100 is hard to attenuate.<br>
• The high mass and turbulence of the large fan unit 100 can cause<br>
undesirable vibration.<br>
Height restrictions have necessitated the use of air-handling systems built with<br>
two fan units 100 arranged horizontally adjacent to each other. It should be noted, however,<br>
that a good engineering practice is to design air handler cabinets and discharge plenums 110 to<br>
be symmetrical to facilitate more uniform airflow across the width and height of the cabinet.<br>
Twin fan units 100 have been utilized where there is a height restriction and the unit is designed<br>
with a high aspect ratio to accommodate the desired flow rate. As shown in the Greenheck<br>
"Installation Operating and Maintenance Manual," if side-by-side installation was contemplated,<br>
there were specific instructions to arrange the fans such that there was at least one fan wheel<br>
diameter spacing between the fan wheels and at least one half a fan wheel diameter between<br>
the fan and the walls or ceilings. The Greenheck reference even specifically states that<br>
arrangements "with less spacing will experience performance losses." Normally, the airhandling<br>
system and air-handling compartment 102 are designed for a uniform velocity gradient<br>
of 500 feet per minute velocity in the direction of airflow. The two fan unit 100 air-handling<br>
systems, however, still substantially suffered from the problems of the single unit embodiments.<br>
There was no recognition of advantages by increasing the number of fan units 100 from one to<br>
two. Further, the two fan unit 100 section exhibits a non-uniform velocity gradient in the region<br>
following the fan unit 100 that creates uneven airflow across filters, coils, and sound attenuators.<br>
It should be noted that electrical devices have taken advantage of multiple fan<br>
cooling systems. For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,414,845 to Bonet uses a multiple-fan modular<br>
cooling component for installation in multiple component-bay electronic devices. Although some<br>
of the advantages realized in the Bonet system would be realized in the present system, there<br>
are significant differences. For example, the Bonet system is designed to facilitate electronic<br>
component cooling by directing the output from each fan to a specific device or area. The Bonet<br>
system would not work to direct airflow to all devices in the direction of general airflow. Other<br>
patents such as U.S. Patent No. 4,767,262 to Simon and U.S. Patent No. 6,388,880 to El-<br>
Ghobashy et al. teach fan arrays for use with electronics.<br>
Even in the computer and machine industries, however, operating fans in parallel<br>
is taught against as not providing the desired results except in low system resistance situations<br>
where fans operate in near free delivery. For example, Sunon Group has a web page in which<br>
they show two axial fans operating in parallel, but specifically state that if "the parallel fans are<br>
applied to the higher system resistance that [an] enclosure has, . . . less increase in flow results<br>
with parallel fan operation." Similar examples of teaching against using fans in parallel are<br>
found in an article accessible from HighBeam Research's library (http://stati.highbeam.com) and<br>
an article by Ian McLeod accessible at (http://www.papstplc.com).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a fan array fan section in an air-handling<br>
system. As shown in FIGS. 2-11, the fan array fan section in the air-handling system uses a<br>
plurality of individual single fan units 200. In one preferred embodiment, the fan units 200 are<br>
arranged in a true array (FIGS. 3-7), but alternative embodiments may include, for example,<br>
alternative arrangements such as in a spaced pattern (FIG. 8), a checker board (FIG. 9), rows<br>
slightly offset (FIG. 10), or columns slightly offset (FIG. 11). As the present invention could be<br>
implemented with true arrays and/or alternative arrays, the term "array" is meant to be<br>
comprehensive.<br>
The fan units 200 in the fan array of the present invention may be spaced as little<br>
as 20% of a fan wheel diameter. Optimum operating conditions for a closely arranged array<br>
may be found at distances as low as 30% to 60% of a fan wheel diameter. By closely spacing<br>
the fan units 200, more air may be moved in a smaller space. For example, if the fan wheels of<br>
the fan units 200 have a 20 inch fan wheel diameter, only a 4 inch space (20%) is needed<br>
between the outer periphery of one fan wheel and the outer periphery of the adjacent fan wheel<br>
(or a 2 inch space between the outer periphery of a fan wheel and an the adjacent wall or<br>
ceiling).<br>
By using smaller fan units 200 it is possible to support the fan units 200 with less<br>
intrusive structure (fan frame). This can be compared to the large fan frame that supports prior<br>
art fan units 100 and functions as a base. This large fan frame must be large and sturdy<br>
enough to support the entire weight of the prior art fan units 100. Because of their size and<br>
position, the known fan frames cause interference with air flow. In the preferred embodiment,<br>
therefore, the fan units 200 of the fan array may be supported by a frame that supports the<br>
motors 108 with a minimum restriction to airflow.<br>
As mentioned in the Background, others have tried using side-by-side installation<br>
of two fan units 100 arranged horizontally adjacent to each other within an air-handling system.<br>
As is also mentioned in the Background, fan arrays have been used in electronic and computer<br>
assemblies. However, in the air-handling system industry, it has always been held that there<br>
must be significant spacing between the horizontally arranged fan wheels and that<br>
arrangements with less spacing will experience performance losses. A single large fan moves<br>
all the air in a cabinet. Using two of the same or slightly smaller fans caused the air produced<br>
by one fan to interfere with the air produced by the other fan. To alleviate the interference<br>
problem, the fans had to be spaced within certain guidelines - generally providing a clear space<br>
between the fans of a distance of at least one wheel diameter (and a half a wheel diameter to<br>
an adjacent wall). Applying this logic, it would not have made sense to add more fans. And<br>
even if additional fans had been added, the spacing would have continued to be at least one<br>
wheel diameter between fans. Further, in the air-handling system industry, vertically stacking<br>
fan units would have been unthinkable because the means for securing the fan units would not<br>
have been conducive to such stacking (they are designed to be positioned on the floor only).<br>
It should be noted that the plenum fan is the preferred fan unit 200 of the present<br>
invention. In particular, the APF-121, APF-141, APF-161, and APF-181 plenum fans<br>
(particularly the fan wheel and the fan cone) produced by Twin City Fan Companies, Ltd. of<br>
Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S. has been found to work well. The reason that plenum fans work<br>
best is that they do not produce points of high velocity such as those produced by axial fans and<br>
housed centrifugal fans and large plenum fans. Alternative embodiments use known fan units<br>
or fan units yet to be developed that will not produce high velocity gradients in the direction of<br>
airflow. Still other embodiments, albeit less efficient, use fan units such as axial fans and/or<br>
centrifugal housed fans that have points of high velocity in the direction of airflow.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, each of the fan units 200 in the fan array fan<br>
section in the air-handling system is controlled by an array controller 300 (FIGS. 12 and 13). In<br>
one preferred embodiment, the array controller 300 may be programmed to operate the fan<br>
units 200 at peak efficiency. In this peak efficiency embodiment, rather than running all of the<br>
fan units 200 at a reduced efficiency, the array controller 300 turns off certain fan units 200 and<br>
runs the remaining fan units 200 at peak efficiency. In an alternative embodiment, the fan units<br>
200 could all run at the same power level (e.g. efficiency and/or flow rate) of operation.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that the array controller 300 (which<br>
may be a variable frequency drive (VFD)) used for controlling fan speed and thus flow rate and<br>
pressure, could be sized for the actual brake horsepower of the fan array fan section in the airhandling<br>
system. Since efficiency of the fan wall array can be optimized over a wide range of<br>
flow rates and pressures, the actual operating power consumed by the fan array is substantially<br>
less than the actual operating power consumed by the comparable prior art air-handling<br>
systems and the array controller's power could be reduced accordingly. The array controller<br>
300 could be sized to the actual power consumption of the fan array where as the controller<br>
(which may have been a variable frequency drive) in a traditional design would be sized to the<br>
maximum nameplate rating of the motor per Electrical Code requirements. An example of a<br>
prior art fan design supplying 50,000 cubic feet per minute of air at 2.5 inches pressure, would<br>
require a 50 horsepower motor and 50 horsepower controller. The new invention will preferably<br>
use an array of fourteen 2 horsepower motors and a 30 horsepower array controller 300.<br>
This invention solves many of the problems of the prior art air-handling systems<br>
including, but not limited to real estate, reduced production costs, reduced operating expenses,<br>
increased efficiency, improved airflow uniformity, redundancy, sound attenuation advantages,<br>
and reduced vibration.<br>
Controllability<br>
As mentioned, preferably each of the fan units 200 in the fan array fan section in<br>
the air-handling system is controlled by an array controller 300 (FIGS. 12 and 13) that may be<br>
programmed to operate the fan units 200 at peak efficiency. In this peak efficiency<br>
embodiment, rather than running all of the fan units 200 at a reduced efficiency, the array<br>
controller 300 is able to turn off certain fan units 200 and run the remaining fan units 200 at<br>
peak efficiency. Preferably, the array controller 300 is able to control fan units 200 individually,<br>
in predetermined groupings, and/or as a group as a whole.<br>
For example, in the 5x5 fan array such as that shown in FIGS. 4, 12, and 13, a<br>
person desiring to control the array may select desired air volume, a level of air flow, a pattern<br>
of air flow, and/or how many fan units 200 to operate. Turning first to air volume, each fan unit<br>
200 in a 5x5 array contributes 4% of the total air. In variable air volume systems, which is what<br>
most structures have, only the number of fan units 200 required to meet the demand would<br>
operate. A control system (that may include the array controller 300) would be used to take fan<br>
units 200 on line (an "ON" fan unit 200) and off line (an "OFF" fan unit 200) individually. This<br>
ability to turn fan units 200 on and off could effectively eliminate the need for a variable<br>
frequency drive. Similarly, each fan unit 200 in a 5x5 array uses 4% of the total power and<br>
produces 4% of the level of air flow. Using a control system to take fan units 200 on line and off<br>
line allows a user to control power usage and/or air flow. The pattern of air flow can also be<br>
controlled if that would be desirable. For example, depending on the system it is possible to<br>
create a pattern of air flow only around the edges of a cabinet or air only at the top. Finally,<br>
individual fan units 200 may be taken on line and off line. This controllability may be<br>
advantageous if one or more fan units 200 are not working properly, need to be maintained (e.g.<br>
needs general service), and/or need to be replaced. The problematic individual fan units 200<br>
may be taken off line while the remainder of the system remains fully functional. Once the<br>
individual fan units 200 are ready for use, they may be brought back on line.<br>
A further advantage to taking fan units 200 on and off line occurs when building<br>
or structure control systems require low volumes of air at relatively high pressures. In this case,<br>
the fan units 200 could be modulated to produce a stable operating point and eliminate the<br>
surge effects that sometimes plague structure owners and maintenance staff. The surge effect<br>
is where the system pressure is too high for the fan speed at a given volume and the fan unit<br>
200 has a tendency to go into stall.<br>
Examples of controllability are shown in FIGS. 12 and 13. In the fan array fan<br>
section in the air-handling system shown in FIG. 12, the array controller 300 alternates "ON" fan<br>
units 200 and "OFF" fan units 200 in a first exemplary pattern as shown so that the entire<br>
system is set to operate at 52% of the maximum rated air flow but only consumes 32% of full<br>
rated power. These numbers are based on exemplary typical fan operations in a structure.<br>
FIG. 13 shows the fan array fan section in the air-handling system set to operate at 32% of the<br>
maximum rated air flow but only consumes 17% of full rated power. These numbers are based<br>
on exemplary typical fan operations in a structure. In this embodiment, the array controller 300<br>
creates a second exemplary pattern of "OFF" fan units 200 and "ON" fan units 200 as shown.<br>
Real Estate<br>
The fan array fan section in the air-handling section 220 of the present invention<br>
preferably uses (60% to 80%) less real estate than prior art discharge plenums 120 (with the<br>
hundred series number being prior art as shown in FIG. 1 and the two hundred series number<br>
being the present invention as shown in FIG. 2) in air-handling systems. Comparing the prior<br>
art (FIG. 1) and the present invention (FIG. 2) shows a graphical representation of this<br>
shortening of the airway path 120, 220. There are many reasons that using multiple smaller fan<br>
units 200 can reduce the length of the airway path 120, 220. For example, reducing the size of<br>
the fan unit 100, 200 and motor 108, 208 reduces the length of the discharge plenum 110, 210.<br>
Similarly, reducing the size of the inlet cone 104, 204 reduces the length of the inlet plenum<br>
112,212. The length of the discharge plenum 110,210 can also be reduced because air from<br>
the fan array fan section in the air-handling system of the present invention is substantially<br>
uniform whereas the prior art air-handling system has points of higher air velocity and needs<br>
time and space to mix so that the flow is uniform by the time it exits the air-handling<br>
compartment 102, 202. (This can also be described as the higher static efficiency in that the<br>
present invention eliminates the need for settling means downstream from the discharge of a<br>
prior art fan system because there is little or no need to transition from high velocity to low<br>
velocity.) The fan array fan section in the air-handling system takes in air from the inlet plenum<br>
212 more evenly and efficiently than the prior art air-handling system so that the length of the<br>
inlet plenum 112, 212 may be reduced.<br>
For purposes of comparison, the first exemplary structure set forth in the<br>
Background of the Invention (a structure requiring 50,000 cubic feet per minute of airflow at a<br>
pressure of six (6) inches water gage) will be used. Using the first exemplary structure, an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention could be served by a nominal discharge plenum<br>
210 of 89 inches high by 160 inches wide and 30 to 36 inches long (as compared to 106 to 112<br>
inches long in the prior art embodiments). The discharge plenum 210 would include a 3x4 fan<br>
array fan section in the air-handling system such as the one shown in FIG. 5) having 12 fan<br>
units 200. The space required for each exemplary fan unit 200 would be a rectangular cube of<br>
approximately 24 to 30 inches on a side depending on the array configuration. The airway path<br>
220 is 42 to 48 inches (as compared to 88 to 139 inches in the prior art embodiments).<br>
For purposes of comparison, the second exemplary structure set forth in the<br>
Background of the Invention (a structure requiring 26,000 cubic feet per minute of airflow at a<br>
pressure of two (2) inches water gage) will be used. Using the second exemplary structure, an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention could be served by a nominal discharge plenum<br>
210 of 84 inches high by 84 inches wide, and and 30 to 36 inches long (as compared to 94 to<br>
100 inches long in the prior art embodiments). The discharge plenum would include a 3x3 fan<br>
array fan section in the air-handling system (such as the one shown in FIG. 6) having 9 fan units<br>
200. The space required for each exemplary fan unit 200 would be a rectangular cube of<br>
approximately 24 to 30 inches on a side depending on the array configuration. The airway path<br>
220 is 42 to 48 inches (as compared to 71 to 95 inches in the prior art embodiments).<br>
Reduced Production Costs<br>
It is generally more cost effective to build the fan array fan section in the airhandling<br>
system of the present invention as compared to the single fan unit 100 used in prior art<br>
air-handling systems. Part of this cost savings may be due to the fact that individual fan units<br>
200 of the fan array can be mass-produced. Part of this cost savings may be due to the fact<br>
that it is less expensive to manufacture smaller fan units 200. Whereas the prior art single fan<br>
units 100 were generally custom built for the particular purpose, the present invention could be<br>
implemented on a single type of fan unit 200. In alternative embodiments, there might be<br>
several fan units 200 having different sizes and/or powers (both input and output). The different<br>
fan units 200 could be used in a single air-handling system or each air-handling system would<br>
have only one type of fan unit 200. Even when the smaller fan units 200 are custom made, the<br>
cost of producing multiple fan units 200 for a particular project is almost always less that the<br>
cost of producing a single large prior art fan unit 100 for the same project. This may be because<br>
of the difficulties of producing the larger components and/or the cost of obtaining the larger<br>
components necessary for the single large prior art fan unit 100. This cost savings also extends<br>
to the cost of producing a smaller air-handling compartment 202.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the fan units 200 are modular such<br>
that the system is "plug and play." Such modular units may be implemented by including<br>
structure for interlocking on the exterior of the fan units 200 themselves. Alternatively, such<br>
modular units may be implemented by using separate structure for interlocking the fan units<br>
200. In still another alternative embodiment, such modular units may be implemented by using<br>
a grid system into which the fan units 200 may be placed.<br>
Reduced Operating Expenses<br>
The fan array fan section in the air-handling system of the present invention<br>
preferably are less expensive to operate than prior art air-handling systems because of greater<br>
flexibility of control and fine tuning to the operating requirements of the structure. Also, by using<br>
smaller higher speed fan units 200 that require less low frequency noise control and less static<br>
resistance to flow.<br>
Increased Efficiency<br>
The fan array fan section in the air-handling system of the present invention<br>
preferably is more efficient than prior art air-handling systems because each small fan unit 200<br>
can run at peak efficiency. The system could turn individual fan units 200 on and off to prevent<br>
inefficient use of particular fan units 200. It should be noted that an array controller 300 could<br>
be used to control the fan units 200. As set forth above, the array controller 300 turns off certain<br>
fan units 200 and runs the remaining fan units 200 at peak efficiency.<br>
Redundancy<br>
Multiple fan units 200 add to the redundancy of the system. If a single fan unit<br>
200 breaks down, there will still be cooling. The array controller 300 may take disabled fan units<br>
200 into consideration such that there is no noticeable depreciation in cooling or air flow rate.<br>
This feature may also be useful during maintenance as the array controller 300 may turn off fan<br>
units 200 that are to be maintained offline with no noticeable depreciation in cooling or airflow<br>
rate.<br>
Sound Attenuation Advantages<br>
The high frequency sound of the small fan units 200 is easier to attenuate than<br>
the low frequency sound of the large fan unit. Because the fan wall has less low frequency<br>
sound energy, shorter less costly sound traps are needed to attenuate the higher frequency<br>
sound produced by the plurality of small fan units 200 than the low frequency sound produced<br>
by the single large fan unit 100. The plurality of fan units 200 will each operate in a manner<br>
such that acoustic waves from each unit will interact to cancel sound at certain frequencies thus<br>
creating a quieter operating unit than prior art systems.<br>
Reduced Vibration<br>
The multiple fan units 200 of the present invention have smaller wheels with<br>
lower mass and create less force due to residual unbalance thus causing less vibration than the<br>
large fan unit. The overall vibration of multiple fan units 200 will transmit less energy to a<br>
structure since individual fans will tend to cancel each other due to slight differences in phase.<br>
Each fan unit 200 of the multiple fan units 200 manage a smaller percentage of the total air<br>
handling requirement and thus produce less turbulence in the air stream and substantially less<br>
vibration.<br>
It should be noted that FIG. 3 shows a 4x6 fan array fan section in the airhandling<br>
system having twenty-four fan units 200, FIG. 4 shows a 5x5 fan array fan section in<br>
the air-handling system having twenty-five fan units 200, FIG. 5 shows a 3x4 fan array fan<br>
section in the air-handling system having twelve fan units 200, FIG. 6 shows a 3x3 fan array fan<br>
section in the air-handling system having nine fan units 200, and FIG. 7 shows a 3x1 fan array<br>
fan section in the air-handling system having three fan units 200. It should be noted that the<br>
array may be of any size or dimension of more than two fan units 200. It should be noted that<br>
although the fan units 200 may be arranged in a single plane (as shown in FIG. 2), an<br>
alternative array configuration could contain a plurality of fan units 200 that are arranged in a<br>
staggered configuration (as shown in FIG. 14) in multiple planes. It should be noted that cooling<br>
coils (not shown) could be added to the system either upstream or downstream of the fan units<br>
200. It should be noted that, although shown upstream from the fan units 200, the filter bank<br>
122, 222 could be downstream.<br>
It should be noted that an alternative embodiment would use a horizontally<br>
arranged fan array. In other words, the embodiments shown in FIGS. 2-14 could be used<br>
horizontally or vertically or in any direction perpendicular to the direction of air flow. For<br>
example, if a vertical portion of air duct is functioning as the air-handling compartment 202, the<br>
fan array may be arranged horizontally. This embodiment would be particularly practical in an<br>
air handling compartment for a return air shaft.<br>
It should be noted that the fan section 214 may be any portion of the airway path<br>
220 in which the fan units 200 are positioned. For example, the fan units 200 may be situated in<br>
the discharge plenum 210 (as shown), the inlet plenum 212, or partially within the inlet plenum<br>
212 and partially within the discharge plenum 210. It should also be noted that the air-handling<br>
compartment 202 may be a section of air duct.<br>

specification are used as terms of description and not of limitation, and are not intended to<br>
