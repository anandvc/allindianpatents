Field of invention<br>
The present invention related to a method of making a strip type lamination in window lamination type in an offset printing field for making the product visible when it is placed in a closed container. For example in candle boxes we can see the candle without opening the packing.<br>
Prior art<br>
It is well know to the person skilled in the window lamination field that the window lamination can be performed only for given full board size (i.e. 20" x 30" 10" x 20, 15"25"5 24"x35" etc). Take for an example a board with size 15" x 25" has to be window laminated. In current practice it is possible to perform 15" minus lOtnm (5mmleft side and 5mm right side) x 25". And in very rare case it is possible to perform 15" minus 4" (2" left side and 2" right side) x 25" ( as shown in fig no.l )using suitable adjustment. One of the main drawback in the current method is, it is not possible to arrest the adhesive coating in the said coated area i.e. 11", but adhesive arresting can only possible in the sides (2" left side and 2" right side). If the adhesive coating get arrested inside the coating area, for example 1" inside the 11" coating area, then with the present lamination machine it is not possible to do two 5" jobs ( 11" minus 1", so two 5" jobs ) in one given board size at the same time. This type of lamination is known as strip window lamination. This type of lamination is not possible with the existing machine.<br>
It is well know to the person skilled in the art that (i ) thickness from 200 gsm to 400 gsm and above is called as Board and (ii ) thickness from 25 gsm to 150 gsm is called as paper. With the available window lamination machine it is possible to laminate 250 gsm and above and minimum possibility is with the duplex board having thickness of 225 gsm and very rarely 200 gsm. But running the job with 200 gsm using the presently available window lamination machine is not possible. When the board having a thickness of 200 gsm get coated in the existing machine the board gets stick with the hard chromium adhesive coating roll instead of coming out from the coating roll to get pasted with the film to complete the work. Another main drawback is when the board thickness gets reduced the material wastage gets increased. And so it is also not possible to perform paper jobs work in the existing machine.<br><br>
Object of the invention<br>
A method of making strip type window lamination comprising, a hard chromium adhesive coating roll, characterized in that fixing a removable shaft near the coating roll, the said shaft is connected to a tightly rotatable adjustment, a metal piece embedded with a sheath of rubber on the front side of the said metal piece for arresting the adhesive feeding in the coating roll and a copper blade after the coating roll.<br>
The one object of the present invention is to provide a method to perform, a strip type window lamination in the existing window lamination machine and also to enable the adjustment of the strip type coating area. In the shown fig No.2, 33mm x 6 strips x 36" alone can be window laminated at same time. The rest white area of the board (As per fig no.2) will be left uncoated. The 33mm coating area can also be changed and adjusted as per the job needs. This type of arresting adhesive inside the coating area as per job need is known as Strip type window lamination.<br>
Another object of the present invention is overcoming the difficulties in making window lamination in 200 gms board and also making window lamination even in 75 gsm poster paper without any wastage of time and raw material.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for making strip type window lamination, a said method comprising, a hard chromium adhesive coating roll, characterized in that fixing a removable shaft near the adhesive coating roll, the said shaft is connected to a tightly rotate able adjustment, a metal piece embedded with a sheath of rubber on the front side of the said metal piece for arresting the adhesive feeding in the coating roll and a blade made up of copper.<br>
As it is 90% removable shaft, adjustment and changing the metal piece size and changing the rubber sheath and also adjusting the strip setting is possible very easily and quickly in a user-friendly maimer. In the old machine we can't even do one strip, but now we can do even six strips at the same time.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a device to perform the strip window lamination in paper job work in the existing window lamination machine, the said device comprising, a chromium roll, a shaft characterized in that the said<br><br>
device comprises a removable shaft, a metal strip embedded with rubber sheath, a blade made up of copper, the said blade is fixed to float in the chromium roll with pressure.<br>
When the paper gets adhesive coated and when the paper comes out of the coating unit instead of sticking in the coating roll it will come out easily with the help of the copper blade. The copper blade prevents the paper from sticking and rotating along with the adhesive roll.<br><br><br><br>
