				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing an adsorbent prepared from granular microporous carbon to be used in the storage of fuel gases at low pressure and ambient temperature and such adsorbents from granular microporous carbon preferably from the coconut shell.<br>
The object of the invention is to prepare an adsorbent for storing and adsorbing the fuel gases at a low pressure of about 400-600 psig at the ambient temperature resulting in the storage of the fuel as natural gas and its blends, in particular, Hythane , which is a mixture in the range of 5 to 20% hydrogen and 80-95% Natural gas by volume, of about 150 litres of gas per litre of adsorbent.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an environmentally friendly and easy-to-practice method of binding together adsorbent particles comprising microporous carbon powders and granules in order to yield compacted and mechanically strong monoliths of high packing density carbon to be utilised in storage container for efficient adsorptive storage and transportation of gaseous fuels such as natural gas and Hythane.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
Presently, the use of liquefied petroleum gas consisting mainly of propane and butane for the domestic purposes is widespread. Though the LPG is convenient to store as it liquefies at moderate pressure and ambient temperature. However, LPG has several drawbacks as of potential fire hazard. This is due to the fact that propane and butane vapours are heavier than air so that when spilled or leaked they will remain close to ground level thus creating a risk of fire or explosion. Moreover, LPG burning causes substantially larger emissions of CO2 on the basis of per unit of energy generated.<br>
The use of Natural gas for such purposes has also been tried because unlike that of LPG, there is an abundant supply of natural gas with world reserves estimated to last more than 100 years. Since natural gas is lighter than air, it is inherently safe because upon accidental leakage it would rapidly disperse. Natural gas also has the advantage of clean-burning characteristics with very low level emissions of toxic and regulated gases such as hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides (NO and N02). Also it is the least carbon intensive of the fossil fuels and therefore produces the least amount of carbon dioxide per unit of energy generated. Octane rating of natural gas is about 130, substantially higher than octane rating of propane (105 - 110). The combination of an extensive resource base and environmental advantages makes natural gas a preferred fuel.<br>
For utilization of natural gas and/or Hythane as fuel in cooking appliances and in automobiles in places where pipeline transmission and distribution system of these gaseous fuels does not exist, it is required to provide an alternative cost-effective and convenient means of storage, transportation and distribution of these gaseous fuels in these places. The most commonly perceived way is to store natural gas and its blends under pressures between 3,000 to 5,000 psig. This method of high pressure storage requires use of very heavy and expensive storage cylinders and expensive fuelling equipment. The high pressure gas is also a safety hazard. In the case of an accident, high pressure natural gas and Hythane could explode due to ignition. Therefore, this method of high pressure Natural Gas storage is not acceptable for use in barbecue stoves and indoor burners.<br>
Another way of off-line (non-pipeline) transportation of natural gas and its blends is to supply it in liquid form in thermally-insulated tanks. However, this method of natural gas and Hythane storage and distribution is also not a viable option due to the prohibitively high costs involved in liquefaction and refrigeration, and extraordinary safety precautions that must be taken during the transportation and handling of such dangerous cryogenic liquids.<br>
To avoid such safety hazards , the solution founded is the use of adsorbents for storing such Natural Gas at low pressures. The adsorbents using monoliths of polyvinyl alcohol or other organic materials as binder are tried and found not to be sufficiently efficient for such adsorption.<br>
The use of microporous materials such as zeolites, molecular sieves, and activated carbons have also been known for long for their adsorptive affinity of gases and vapours. The adsorption capacity of an adsorbent generally increases with its increasing internal surface area and pore volume. However, with the activated carbon based adsorbent, it has generally been observed that higher the surface area, the lower is its packing density (that is, lesser weight of carbon can be packed into a fixed volume). This decrease of packing density is due partly to interparticle void spaces left while packing and partly to intraparticle voidage arising from the development of macropores within the carbon network. Thus, although there is usually an increase in adsorption capacity on a weight basis of adsorbent with increase in the surface area, little or no gain is generally made in the adsorption capacity on a volume basis. However, for adsorptive storage of gaseous fuels such as natural gas and Hythane, the volume of the container holding the adsorbent is an important limiting factor. Unfortunately, the microporous carbons, which can be made only in the form of granules or powders from the precursor materials by methods known to the art have low packing density. Thus, for applications of microporous carbons in the storage and transportation of natural gas and Hythane, it is necessary to consolidate them. The consolidation greatly reduces void spaces between carbon particles and possibly even macropore volume so that a larger quantity of adsorbent can be packed in a given storage volume. The compacted carbon so made is likely to exhibit higher adsorption capacity on the volume basis of adsorbent than is otherwise observed.<br>
The presently known art of consolidating the carbon particles into shaped material for use in the storage of natural gas is based mainly on the use of organic binding materials which suffers from major disadvantages.<br>
The polymer, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), which is often referred to by the Dow Chemical trade name Saran, has been used to bind KOH-activated coal carbon sold under trade name AX-21 to produce composite carbon pellets (Barton et al., Reports submitted to Ontario Ministry of Energy, 1984-85) This method has certain drawbacks. It requires the use of high percentages of polymer ranging from 30-90% by weight in the carbon-polymer mix. Furthermore, it is necessary to slowly heat the carbon-polymer composite pellets to a temperature of 700°C under vacuum in order to transform them into adsorbent. This heat treatment process liberates a large volume of corrosive HCI vapour, thus placing significant constraints on the materials of construction of the reactor. The heat treatment process can also generate vinyl chloride, a hazardous substance. Moreover, PVDC is not desirable to use as it is not a cost effective material and is also not easily available.<br>
The use of phenolic resins for carbon binding and compaction of activated carbons made from coals and scrap tires into shaped material for use in storage of natural gas is also known to the art (see J. Sun, T.A. Brady, M.S. Rood, C.M. Lehmann, Energy and Fuels, Vol. II, pp 316-322, 1997). However, this class of binders also has a number of limitations. It is necessary to use large quantities of binder (binder to carbon ratio &gt;0.3) and to heat the carbon-binder mix to a high temperature (&gt;500°C) under compressive pressure to achieve binding. Furthermore, phenolic resins being condensation products of phenol and formaldehyde can potentially cause emissions of harmful substances, for example, formaldehyde, during the course of pressure-temperature moulding of the carbon-resin binder mix.<br>
Another organic binder which has been used for compacting activated carbon powder derived from coal (sold under trade name AX-21) is polyvinyl alcohol<br>
(U.S. Patent No. 4,999,330). This polyvinyl alcohol method of binding requires heating and cooling under carefully controlled conditions, is cumbersome and time-consuming.<br>
Hence, the methods known in the art on fabrication of compacted carbon adsorbents for use in the storage of natural gas and other gaseous fuels are expensive, time-consuming, and are detrimental to health and the environment to quite an extent.<br>
To overcome the drawbacks existing in the problems on compacting of microporous carbons for use in the storage of natural gas, the subject invention has been developed. The novel method of compacting the carbon at low pressure and temperature disclosed in this invention is economically viable and environmentally safe to warrant its wide range of applications.<br>
The adsorbent of this invention consists of carbon monoliths of high packing density fabricated by binding and compacting microporous carbon particles, prepared from coconut shells, using an inorganic clay material as binder.<br>
In an another embodiment of the subject invention, the microporous carbon particles are prepared from the coal, coal coke, petroleum coke, wood and rice husks and the like for the storage, transportation and distribution of natural gas and Hythane in accordance with this invention.<br>
The use of non-toxic, non-hazardous, inexpensive and readily available inorganic materials as binding agents for binding together carbon particles to form monoliths of desired shapes and sizes is achieved by using a cationic clay of phyllosilicate family, either alone or as a mixture with sodium silicate or calcium hydroxide, as the binding agent. Preferred cationic clay of the said binding agent formulation is bentonite, Na-exchanged bentonite or pillared analogues of bentonite, preferably AI-, Fe-, Cr-, Zr- or Ti- pillared bentonite. In the said binder formulation, the clay content is 5% to 15% by weight,<br>
sodium silicate content is 0.5% to 1.5% by weight, and calcium hydroxide content in 0.5% to 1.5% by weight, all based on the weight of carbon in the monolith. The use of totally inorganic materials as binder in the subject invention eliminates the risk of emission of toxic and regulated gases or vapour during monolith production.<br>
The method of binding and compacting microporous carbon particles to yield high strength monoliths is achieved by mixing microporous carbon powder with water dispersion of the cationic clay binding agent referred to above, drying the slurry to desired consistency, and consolidating the carbon-binder mix so prepared either by compression under a modest pressure in the range of 8,000 psi to 16,000 psi in a die/pelleting press without having to apply heating as done conventionally, or by the extrusion process using a conventional extruder to yield dense, mechanically strong blocks of regular shape and desired dimension. The binding and compaction method, as disclosed above, causes nearly a two-fold reduction in bulk volume and a corresponding increase of packing density. As, the method does not require application of heat, it results in providing substantial processing cost savings. Since, the method does not involve heating and cooling of the carbon-binder mix during monolith fabrication, the carbon-binder mix are formed into monoliths in substantially little time as less as 15 minutes, thereby reducing the process time.<br>
Moreover, the monolith fabrication process is not associated with release of obnoxious gases or vapours of any kind and therefore is free from environmental hazards or occupational health and safety concerns. The method thus overcomes the difficulties associated with the methods known to the art on pelletization or briquetting of activated carbon powders for using them in natural gas storage.<br>
Accordingly, the subject invention relates to a process for the preparation of an  adsorbent prepared from granular microporous carbon preferably<br>
from the coconut shell to be used in the storage of fuel gases preferably natural gas and its blends at low pressure and ambient temperature , comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	grinding granular microporous carbon into a fine powder;<br>

with the said aqueous dispersion of the binding agent to make a<br>
carbon-binding agent-water slurry;<br>
d)	drying the said carbon-binding agent-water slurry by evaporating<br>
water by heating while stirring until moisture content of the<br>
resultant mix corresponds to the range from 80% to 100% by<br>
weight, based on the weight of carbon in the mix;<br>
e)	consolidating   the  said   dried   carbon-binding   agent   mix  at<br>
ambient temperature, to obtain dense and mechanically strong<br>

70° C and at a temperature of 120°C to 140°C in air atmosphere<br>

The embodiment of the invention resides in a process for the preparation of a granular microporous carbon prepared by carbonization and controlled partial oxidation of coconut shells, comprising:-<br>
crushing the said coconut shells to a particle size of 5-10mm, washing the said crushed coconut shells with water and drying the same at a temperature of 110°C<br>

The said microporous carbon may also be derived from carbonaceous materials selected from wood, coal, various kinds of pitch, and petroleum tar.<br>
The said granular microporous carbon is obtained by chemical activation in an inert atmosphere with KOH, phosphoric acid or ZnCI2 at temperatures in the range 300-600°C or by carbonization at temperatures in the range 600-800°C , followed by controlled partial oxidation with CO2 or water vapour-N2 mixture at temperatures in the range 700-850°C.<br>

The binding agent is selected from clay mixed with or without sodium silicate or calcium hydroxide .<br>
The clay material is selected from the group consisting of cationic clays and pillared analogues of cationic clays selected from hydrous layer silicates of the called phyllosilicate family consisting of groups as smectite, vermiculite, serpentine-kaolin, talc-pyrophyllite, mica, chlorite and sepiolite-palygorskite, typical examples being bentonite, atapulgite, hectorite, beidellite, fuller's earth halloysite, illite kaolin, montmorillonite and mullite.<br>
The binding agent used is bentonite clay, Na- or K- exchanged bentonite clay, pillared bentonite clay (wherein pillaring species is a polycationic oxide of Al, Fe, Cr, Zr or Ti) and a combination thereof. The pillared analogues of<br>
cationic clays are materials in which small cations of the cationic clay are replaced by large polyoxocationic species.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 depicts the block flow diagram showing various unit operations involved in the preparation of high density monolithic microporous carbon adsorbent from coconut shells for use in the storage, off-line transportation and distribution of natural gas and Hythane fuels.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As illustrated in Figure 1, microporous carbon for binding and consolidation in accordance with the method disclosed in this invention is prepared from abundant and inexpensive coconut shells by the two-stage process of carbonization and controlled partial oxidation.<br>
The process for the preparation of activated carbon from coconut shells for use as guard bed; comprises:<br>
1	pyrolysis/carbonization of dried coconut shell at 873 K under an inert<br>
atmosphere.<br>
2	Activation of coconut char by partial gasification/controlled oxidation<br>
with CO2at 1073K.<br>
The coconut shells were cleaned of loose fibers and traces of kernel, crushed to particle size of about 10mm, washed with water and dried at a temperature of 110°C and then subjected to carbonization by heating to a temperature of 600°C to 700°C in an inert atmosphere. The char so produced is crushed, screened to 8-30 mesh size and then submitted to controlled partial oxidation with oxidising agents such as carbon dioxide and water vapour/nitrogen mixture at a temperature of 700°C to 850°C. The resultant product obtained is a granular microporous carbon having a surface area in the range 1200 -1800 m2/g.<br>
The process for the preparation of carbon monoliths comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	crushing and milling the granular carbon into a fine powder by<br>
conventional means preferably in a ball mill;<br>
b)	preparing an aqueous dispersion of  the binder formulation by<br>
adding the ingredients of the formulation to water at the rate of<br>
25 mL to 50 ml water per gram of binder    and thoroughly<br>
agitating the mix;<br>
c)	mixing dry or pre-wetted carbon powder of step (a) with the<br>
water dispersion  of the  binder of step  (b)   in  appropriate<br>
proportions to make a slurry of carbon and binding agent;<br>
d)	drying the carbon-binding agent slurry of step (c) to desired<br>
moisture content ranging from 80% to 100% by weight based on<br>
the weight of carbon used in step (c), by evaporating water<br>
while stirring in any conventional blending-drying equipment;<br>
e)	consolidating    carbon-binder   mix   of   step    (d)   either   by<br>
compression,  at ambient temperature,  inside a suitable die<br>
under a pressure of 8,000 to  16,000 psi  using  a suitable<br>
pelleting press or by extrusion process using a suitable extruder<br>
to   provide   high   density,   mechanically  strong   monoliths   of desired shapes and sizes; and<br>
f) subjecting the monoliths to drying in steps at a temperature of 60°C to 70°C and at temperature of 120°C to 140°C in air atmosphere to provide dried monoliths free of moisture.<br>
the said binding agent used in step (b) is a clay material used alone or along with sodium silicate or calcium hydroxide, wherein the clay component is chosen from a group of cationic clays which are hydrous layer silicates of the so-called phyllosilicate family consisting of such groups as smectite, vermiculite, serpentine-kaolin, talc-pyrophylite, mica, brittle mica, chlorite and sepiolite-palygorskite, typical examples being bentonite, atapulgite, hectorite, beidellite, fuller's earth, halloysite, illite kaolin, montmorillonite and mullite or from a group consisting of pillared analogues of cationic clays which are materials in which small cations of cationic clay are replaced by large polyoxocationic species. The most preferred clays for use in the binding agent formulation include bentonite clay, sodium exchanged bentonite clay, pillared analogues of bentonite clay (such as AI-, Fe-, Cr-, Zr- or Ti- pillared bentonite clay) and combinations thereof. In the said binding agent formulation, the clay content is 5% to 15% by weight, sodium silicate content is 0.5% to 1.5% by weight, and calcium hydroxide content is 0.5% to 1.5% by weight, all based on the weight of carbon used in step (c).<br>
In step (d), the moisture content of the carbon-binder paste is controlled in the range from 80% to 100% by weight based on the weight of carbon used in the preparation.<br>
The packing density of the monoliths so obtained is nearly twice as much as that of the starting granular material. The binding agents used in the subject invention are thermally and chemically stable substances which at no stages of monolith fabrication process release obnoxious gases or vapours of any<br>
kind and therefore there is no cause for concern from the viewpoint of environmental pollution or occupational health and safety hazard.<br>
Another key feature of the method of this invention is that it does not suffer from the problem of pore plugging with binder. This is due to the fact that the major ingredient of binder formulation that is the clay component is applied as a dispersion in water rather than as a solution wherein size of the clay particulates are too large to penetrate into and occupy the micropores of carbon particles.<br>
The method of binding and compaction as disclosed above is also suitable for binding and consolidation of other microporous solid adsorbents such as zeolites, carbon molecular sieves, alumino-phosphates, silicoaluminophosphates, silicas and aluminas.<br>
The subject invention can better be understood with reference to the undermentioned examples, which should not be construed to restrict the scope of the invention.<br>

The monoliths were tested for the storage of natural gas fuel under a pressure of 500 psig and at temperature of 22 °C. A batch of monoliths weighing 36.6 grams and having a total geometric volume 54.9 ml was used.<br>
The natural gas storage capacity of the adsorbent was found to be 156 litres of natural gas per litre of adsorbent (156 v/v), as shown in Table 2.<br>

In the examples 1-6 , the packing densities of the cylindrical shaped monoliths were ranging from 0.67-0.78, which was determined from their physically measured dimensions and weights. A batch consisting of 5 to 7 monoliths were used in the measurement. The weights were recorded after degassing the monoliths under vacuum at a temperature of 130°C to 150°C. The mechanical strength of the monoliths was tested in an apparatus consisting of a screw-thread type hand press attached to an electronic balance. Monolithic pieces were subjected to a constant compressive pressure of 5 kg/cm2 (applied load divided by cross-sectional area of the monolith) and if found to remain intact it was concluded that the crushing strength of the particular monolith is at least 5 kg/cm2. Packing density of the granular samples was measured by filling a calibrated cylinder with a known sample weight and tapping the cylinder until a constant volume was obtained. The results are reported in Table A. The surface area of granular carbon samples was determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherm measured at liquid nitrogen temperature using BET equation. Packing density of the granular samples was measured by filling a calibrated cylinder with a known sample weight and tapping the cylinder until a constant volume was obtained. The results are reported in TABLE A<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The binding and consolidation with the bentonite clay based binding agents result in a increase in the packing density of the microporous carbons prepared by using different oxidizing agents and having different surface<br>
areas, thus making these materials suitable for the storage, transportation and distribution of gaseous fuels such as natural gas and Hythane, as illustrated in the Table A The mechanical strength of the carbon monoliths was found to be greater than 5 kg/cm2 which is adequate for most applications.<br>
EXAMPLE :7<br>
The polyvinyl alcohol based binder was used for fabrication of carbon monoliths, where Carbon used was a mixture of two coconut shell carbons (surface area ~ 1100 m2 and ~ 1600 m2/g) in the ratio 80 : 20. The binder was a mixture of 0.06 gram of polyvinyl alcohol (mol. wt. ~ 115,000), 0.004 gram of urea and 0.002 gram of ethylene glycol per gram of carbon. A slurry of carbon and binder ingredients in water was prepared, which was then partially evaporated to obtain a semi-dried mass with a moisture content of 40-50% by wt. (based on the total wt. of carbon used). Cylindrical shaped carbon monoliths of 20 mm diameter and 15-30 mm thickness were fabricated by pressing the semi-dried mass contained in a cylindrical die by means of a hydraulic press at a pressure of 50,000 psi while slowly heating the die to a temperature of 250°C and holding at that temperature for about 1 hour. The average packing density of dried (moisture free) monoliths was 0.84 g/mL.<br>
The monoliths were tested for the storage of natural gas fuel under a pressure of 500 psig and at ambient temperature (22°C - 25°C). A batch of pellets weighing 44.7 grams and having a total geometric volume of 53.0 ml was used in the test. The natural gas storage capacity of the adsorbent was measured.<br>
The natural gas storage capacity of the adsorbent was found to be 155 litres of gas per litre of adsorbent (155v/v), as shown in Table 7.<br>

EXAMPLE 8<br>
Microporous carbon particles, prepared from coconut shells by carbonization and partial oxidation with water vapour - N2 mixture and having surface area of about 1240 m2/g, were binded together and consolidated into cylindrical monoliths having 20 mm diameter and 20-40 mm thickness using an admixture of bentonite clay and sodium silicate as binding agent in the<br>
amounts of 0.10 gram of bentonite clay and 0.010 gram of sodium silicate per gram of carbon. The average density of carbon monoliths was 0.79 g/mL.<br>
The monoliths were tested for the storage of Hythane fuel (composition : 90 volume percent natural gas and 10 volume percent hydrogen) under a pressure of about 550 psig and at ambient temperature 25°C. A batch of monoliths weighing 44.5 grams and having a total geometric volume 56.5 mL was used in the test. The fuel storage capacity of the adsorbent was measured.<br>
The Hythane storage capacity of the adsorbent was found to be 154 litres of Hythane per litre of adsorbent (154 v/v), as shown in Table 8.<br>

Hythane Storage by Monolithic Microporous Coconut Carbon at 550 psig Pressure and Ambient Temperature.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Examples 1-6, which deal with the monolithic carbon adsorbent fabricated using clay-based binders according to the method of this invention, clearly illustrate that the concentrated storage of natural gas at low pressures can be achieved by the method and adsorbent materials of this invention, thus avoiding the high pressures needed for storage as compressed gas (CNG) or cryogenic temperatures needed for storage as liquefied natural gas (LNG).<br>
Example 7, deals with the monolithic carbon adsorbent monoliths fabricated using PVA-based binder. It is evident from the above mentioned table that PVA-based procedure is not only time-consuming, cumbersome and energy intensive but does not offer any advantages also. The natural gas storage capacity of the adsorbent fabricated using clay-based binders according to this invention, is similar to that of the adsorbent fabricated using PVA-based binder. On the other hand, the clay-based fabrication method has a number of advantages: it is simple and easy-to-practice ; fabrication process does not require costly heating ; and there is no risk of releasing obnoxious gases or vapours. Example 8 illustrates that the method and adsorbent material of this invention is also well suited for low pressure adsorptive storage of Hythane fuel.<br>
The adsorbent material of the present invention is placed in the containers used for storing the natural gas and Hythane. Storage containers containing such adsorbent can be fuelled in a central filling station. Once the natural gas or Hythane stored in a container is exhausted due to usage as fuel in the desired application, the container can be brought back to the filling station, refilled and transported back to the user. In this way, the same batch of<br>
adsorbent can be used for storage and distribution of natural gas or Hythane over and over again for years.<br>
While the invention has been described and illustrated herein by references to various specific materials, procedures and examples, it is understood that the invention is not restricted to the particular materials and procedures selected for that purpose. Numerous variations of such details can be employed, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art without deviating from the scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
