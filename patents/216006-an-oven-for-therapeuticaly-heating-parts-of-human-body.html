				<td>This device is intended to heat parts of the human body for therapeutic purposes.<br>
Application of heat to parts of human body for therapeutic purposes is necessary in several conditions. One such condition is lymphoedema, a type of swelling affecting parts of human body, especially the limbs. In this condition, there is blockage in a system of tubes called lymphatics inside the human body. The swelling makes the limb heavy and predisposes it to frequent infections. Lymphoedema is not curable and has to be managed life-long. In India filariasis is the main cause of lymphoedema and it is widely prevalent.<br>
Heat therapy is one of the modalities to reduce lymphoedmatous swelling of the limbs. In this type of therapy the limb is heated at a temperature 6-7° C above the body temperature for 30-60 minutes daily for several days.<br>
. A type of heating device consists of a non-insulated aluminium chamber heated by electrical bulbs and has no temperature regulation mechanism. Absence of insulation is likely to cause  heat  loss  and  fluctuation  in temperature. Absence of temperature regulation may lead to overheating causing burns.<br>
The objective of this invention is to develop a device, for heating parts of the human body, which is safe, energy efficient, maintains near constant temperature at the desired level and does not get overheated.<br>
Statement of invention:<br>
The present invention provides an oven for therapeutically heating parts of human body; the said oven having the shape of a cuboid chamber (CC); the said oven having a double layered wall having a space between the two layers of the wall (W); the said space filled up with glass wool as insulating material (I) to<br><br>
prevent heat escape; the said oven closed on all sides except an aperture (A) on front to prevent heat escape; the said aperture admitting the human body part intended for heating through the raised ambient tempetature inside the cuboid chamber; the said oven fitted with a coil type electrical heating appratus (H) of 1000 watts capacity operating at 240 Volts AC current placed at the rear part of the cuboid chamber for the purpose of raising the temperature inside the cuboid chamber; the said oven fitted with a therrnostat (T) with a working range of 30° to 100°C for maintaining a desired temperature for the purpose of safety from bums by preventing undue rise in temperature ; the said oven provided at the bottom with a wooden platform (P) as a heat nonconductor platform to rest the body part on; the said oven fitted with a miniature circuit breaker (CB) to prevent accidental electric shock.<br>
This invention will be described with reference to the figures 1-3 in the accompanying two drawing pages.<br>
Fig. 1. is the cross sectional view and Fig.2. is the front view. (W) is the two layered wall made of aluminium sheets. (0 is the insulating material, glass wool in the present case . {CC) is Ae cuboid chamber of the oven. (A) is the aperture in front of the oven for introducing the body part inside the cuboid chamber. (CB) is a miniature circuit brerker provided for preventing accidental electric shock. (T) is a thermocouple type of thennostat with a temperature control range of 30" - 100°C placed on the top of the oven. (H) is a coil type electrical heating apparatus of l000W capacity operating at 240 volts AC fitted at the rear part of the cuboid chamber. (?) is a wooden platform serving as a heat nonconducting platform for resting the body part on.<br>
Fig. 3. is the diagram of the electrical circuit. It consist of a miniature circuit breaker (CB), a thermocouple type of thermostat (T) with its sensor (SN) placed inside the cuboid chamber (CC), a two way switch (SW) that allows flow of the<br><br>
current either directly or through the thermostat, a neon lamp (NE) for indicating current flow and the heater (H) placed inside the cuboid chamber. (L) is the main line and (N) is the neutral.<br>
Method of using the device:<br>
The oven is placed on a stand. It is connected to the main line {L).The affected body part is passed inside the cuboid chamber (CC) through the aperture (A) in the front of the oven and allowed to rest on the wooden platform (P). Any residual gap in the aperture around the limb is closed by a piece of woolen blanket to prevent heat loss.<br>
The thermostat (T) is set at 44°C. This temperature level is safe, comfortable and effective. Exposure of body parts to temperature above 50°C for several minutes can cause bums. Thermoregulation through the thermostat provides safety from bums by preventing rise of temperature by cutting off the current at the set value. The temperature inside the cuboid chamber is maintained around the set value. When the temperature drops below the set value the thermostat automatically switches the current on in order to maintain the temperature at the set value. The thermostat is checked daily for its performance to maintain safety.<br>
The two way switch (SW) is always set to allow flow of current through the thermostat to the heater (H). The other side of the switch which passes<br><br>
current directly to the heater bypassing the thermostat, is always kept off by taping it in order to prevent accidental switching on causing uncontrolled rise in temperature inside the oven which can cause bum to the body part. Very rarely, if the thermostat goes out of order and the situation demands use of the oven urgently for temporary purpose, the other side of the switch can be set bypassing the thermostat. But this is normally discouraged; must be used with proper monitoring to prevent over heating that can cause bums and must be used for a temporary period only.<br>
The neon lamp indicates flow of current.<br>
Now the main line is switched on. The heater (H) produces heat and raises the temperature inside the chamber till the set value is reached. The temperature is controlled by the thermostat.<br>
The body part is kept at 44""C for 30 minutes after which it is taken out. At this point the main line can be switched off. If necessary, a number of body parts from either the same patient or different patients can be heated in tandem without switching off the main thus preventing heat loss<br>
It is to be noted that the temperature setting and the duration of heating of the body part can be varied depending on the need.<br>
Even though the description is with reference to filarial lymphoedema of the limb this device can be used in other conditions and other parts of the body also.<br><br>
The advantages of the present device compared to the available ones are<br>
1.	Thermo regulation through thermostat prevents over heating and hence ensures safety from bums.<br>
2.	The insulated chamber prevents heat loss and saves electricity.<br>
3.	Thermo regulation and insulation together maintain the ambient temperature at a desired level which is necessary for desired effective therapy.<br>
4.	The circuit breaker provides safety from accidental electric shock.<br>
It is to under stood that the present invention is by no means limited to the particular construction herein disclosed and/or shown in the drawing, but also comprises any modification or equivalent within the scope of disclosure.<br><br><br>
