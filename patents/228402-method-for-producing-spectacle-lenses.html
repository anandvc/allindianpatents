				<td>METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF<br>
OPHTHALMIC LENSES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to ophthalmic lenses. In particular, the<br>
invention provides methods and compositions for producing lenses by casting.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of spectacle lenses for the correction of ametropia is well known.<br>
For example, multifocal lenses, such as progressive addition lenses, are used for the<br>
treatment of presbyopia. A number of methods are known for producing ophthalmic<br>
lenses. These methods include casting semi-finished lens blanks and subsequently<br>
polishing and grinding the blanks to form lenses, casting of whole lenses, and<br>
casting of a surface onto an optical preform to form a lens.<br>
The casting of a surface onto an optical preform is advantageous in that it<br>
can reduce the number of molds required to produce a full prescriptive range of<br>
lenses. However, the known surface casting processes lack the efficiency necessary<br>
for use of the processes in the mass production of lenses. More specifically, the<br>
known processes require cure times of 30 minutes or more to achieve a cured resin<br>
layer free of optical distortions, defects, or voids. Additionally, known resins for use<br>
in surface casting processes cannot provide both a high refractive index on cure and<br>
a low viscosity at room temperature. Therefore, the invention provides methods and<br>
compositions for casting surfaces onto preforms to form lenses that attempt to<br>
overcome these disadvantages.<br>
Description of the Invention and its Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides methods and compositions for producing<br>
ophthalmic lenses, including multifocal spectacle lenses such as progressive addition<br>
lenses, as well as lenses produced using the methods and compositions of the<br><br>
invention. The invention, provides a fast and reliable method for producing<br>
ophthalmic lenses.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for producing an<br>
ophthalmic lens comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of the steps of:<br>
a.) exposing to low intensity ultraviolet light a mold assembly and a surface-forming<br>
effective amount of a resin comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of<br>
reactive groups, the low intensity UV light exposure carried out under conditions<br>
suitable to convert at least about 50 percent or more of the resin's reactive groups;<br>
and b.) exposing, subsequently, the resin to high intensity UV light under conditions<br>
suitable to substantially complete through curing of the resin. In another<br>
embodiment, the invention provides lenses produced by this method.<br>
By "ophthalmic lens" is meant a contact lens, intraocular lens, spectacle lens<br>
and the like. Preferably, the lens formed by the method of the invention is a<br>
spectacle lens, more preferably a multifocal, most preferably a progressive addition<br>
lens. By "mold assembly" is meant one or more mold halves, an optical preform, or<br>
combinations thereof. By "optical preform" or "preform" is meant a shaped,<br>
optically transparent article capable of refracting light, which article is suitable for<br>
use in producing a spectacle lens. By "resin" is meant at least one monofunctional<br>
monomer, one or more polyfunctional monomers, and one or more initiators. By<br>
"convert" is meant that the reactive groups are incorporated into the polymer being<br>
formed.<br>
In the first step of the method of the invention, a mold assembly is exposed<br>
to low intensity ultraviolet light. For purposes of the invention, low intensity UV<br>
light is UV light with an intensity of about 0.5 to about 50, preferably about 1 to<br>
about 5 mW/cm2. Suitable wavelengths for carrying out this step of the process are<br>
about 300 to about 450, preferably about 360 to about 400 nm. The low intensity<br>
exposure is carried out under conditions of wavelength and time suitable to convert<br><br>
at least about 50 percent or more of the resin's reactive groups and, preferably, while<br>
maintaining the rate of polymerization as low as possible, which rate is a rate at<br>
which undesirable shrinkage induced defects are avoided. One ordinarily skilled in<br>
the art will recognize that this rate will depend on a number of factors including,<br>
without limitation, the resin used and the thickness of the resin layer. The<br>
maintenance of the low polymerization rate is achieved through the use of the low<br>
intensity UV light and, optionally, one or more of using a photoinitiator<br>
concentration of about 1 weight percent or less based on the total resin weight,<br>
incorporation of periods of non-exposure into the low intensity exposure cycle, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
The time for the low intensity exposure will depend on the resin selected for<br>
casting onto the preform, the type and amount of initiator used, resin viscosity, the<br>
nature of the reactive groups, the thickness of the resin layer to be cast, and the<br>
intensity of the UV light. Generally, the total exposure time will be about 5 seconds<br>
to about 300 seconds, preferably about 60 seconds to about 120 seconds.<br>
The low intensity exposure preferably is carried out in one step. However,<br>
some lens assemblies may require that the low intensity exposure be carried out in<br>
two or more steps using periods of non-exposure to the UV light of about 5 to about<br>
60 seconds between each low intensity exposure. Preferably, periods of exposure of<br>
about 30 to about 60 seconds are alternated with non-exposure periods of about 5 to<br>
about 60 seconds.<br>
Subsequent to the termination of the low intensity exposure, the mold<br>
assembly is exposed to high intensity UV light under conditions suitable to complete<br>
through cure of the resin. The intensity of the UV light for this step may be about 50<br>
to about 2000, preferably 500 to about 1500 mW/cm2. The wavelength at which the<br>
exposure is carried out may be, and preferably is, the same as that used to carry out<br>
the low intensity exposure. The same factors determinative for low intensity<br><br>
exposure time are determinative for the high intensity exposure time. Generally, the<br>
exposure time will be about 3 seconds to about 60 seconds, preferably about 5<br>
seconds to about 15 seconds. The high intensity exposure may, and preferably is,<br>
carried out as a single, continuous exposure. However, the high intensity exposure<br>
also may be carried out using alternating periods of UV exposure and non-exposure<br>
periods.<br>
It is a discovery of the invention that the disclosed cure process using low<br>
and high intensity exposure permits production of a cast layer substantially free of<br>
distortions, defects and voids using a total UV exposure, both low and high<br>
intensity, time of about 150 or less seconds. Preferably the total exposure time is<br>
about 130 seconds or less.<br>
The low and high intensity polymerization steps may be carried out at<br>
ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Preferably, the resin is hot-coated<br>
and the polymerization process is carried out at about the glass transition<br>
temperature, or Tg, of the cured resin or above. By "hot-coated " is meant that the<br>
resin is heated before it is cast to about its Tg. Heating may be accomplished by any<br>
convenient means including, without limitation, use of an oven, heat circulator, or<br>
combination thereof. Polymerization at the preferred temperature is also achieved<br>
by any convenient means including, without limitation, maintaining the cure<br>
chamber at the preferred temperature by use of forced air.<br>
The low and high intensity UV exposures may be carried out in any fashion<br>
that permits the even distribution of the light through the mold assembly. A<br>
convenient and preferred mode is to expose the mold assembly to the UV light by<br>
placing the UV light source beneath the mold assembly. Sources of low intensity<br>
UV light include, without limitation, mercury and xenon arc lamps, fluorescent-type<br>
bulbs, or the like, and combinations thereof. High intensity UV light sources<br>
include, without limitation, mercury, xenon, and mercury-xenon arc lamps,<br><br>
FUSION™ microwave-ignited lamps, or the like, and combinations thereof.<br>
Suitable sources for the UV light used in the invention are commercially available.<br>
The mold half or halves used may be made of any suitable material<br>
including, without limitation, glass or plastic. The optical preforms used in the mold<br>
assemblies may be made of any suitable materials including, without limitation,<br>
polycarbonates, such as bisphenol A polycarbonates, allyl diglycol carbonates, such<br>
as diethylene glycol bisallyl carbonate (CR-39™), allylic esters, such as triallyl<br>
cyanurate, triallyl phosphate and triallyl citrate, acrylic esters, acrylates,<br>
methacrylates, such as methyl- ethyl- and butyl methacrylates and acrylates,<br>
styrenics, polyesters, poly ether phosphine oxides, and the like and combinations<br>
thereof. The preform may be produced by any convenient means including, without<br>
limitation, injection molding, injection-compression molding, thermoforming,<br>
casting, or the like.<br>
In practice of the method of the invention, the rein may contain any mono- or<br>
polyfunctional monomer suitable for use for casting a surface onto an optical<br>
preform and containing the requisite reactive groups. The reactive groups required<br>
to be contained in the monomers used in the invention are photopolymerizable<br>
groups including, without limitation, free-radical polymerizable, photoanionic<br>
polymerizable, photocationic polymerizable groups, and the like, and combinations<br>
thereof. Preferably, resins with free-radical polymerizable groups are used.<br>
Examples of such groups include, without limitation, substituted vinyl and allyl<br>
groups including, without limitation, acrylate, methacrylate, styryl, allylic esters,<br>
vinylic esters, allyl carbonates, allyl alkyl ethers, allyl aryl ethers and the like, and<br>
combinations thereof. As another alternative, the reactive groups may be<br>
photocationically reactive groups, such as an epoxide, aliphatic cyclic ether, vinyl<br>
alkyl and vinyl aryl ethers, styrenic groups, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
As still another alternative, photoanionic reactive groups may be used including,<br><br>
without limitation, acryjate, methacrylate, epoxide, styryl, and the like, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Suitable mono- and polyfunctional monomers include, without limitation,<br>
those disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,470,892, incorporated in its entirety<br>
herein by reference. Additional suitable monomers include, without limitation, allyl<br>
and bis(allyl) carbonates, such as diethylene glycol bis(allyl) carbonate, bisphenol A<br>
diallyl carbonate, and the like, acrylic acid, multi-functional acrylates and<br>
methacrylates, such as ethylene glycol diacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate,<br>
tripropylene glycol diacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl<br>
methacrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate, hexanediolmethacrylate, methyl<br>
methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate,<br>
urethane acrylates and methacrylates, styrene and styrene derivatives such as divinyl<br>
benzene, 4-vinyl anisole, various esters or maleic and itaconic acids, methacrylic<br>
and acrylic anhydrides and the like, and combinations thereof. Such monomers are<br>
commercially available or methods for their production are known.<br>
It is another discovery of the invention that certain monomers are particularly<br>
useful in forming lenses with high refractive indices. By "high refractive index" is<br>
meant a refractive index on curing of about 1.54 or greater, preferably of about 1.56<br>
or greater. The monomers useful in forming high refractive index resins are<br>
bisphenol A diacrylates and dimethacrylates, ethoxylated bisphenol A diacrylates<br>
and dimethacrylates, acrylate and methacrylate esters of diglycidyl bisphenol A,<br>
epoxy acrylates and methacrylates, acrylates and methacrylates of tetrabromo<br>
bisphenol A, acrylates and methacrylates of bisphenol S, acrylate and methacrylate<br>
esters of diglycidyl tetrabromo bisphenol A, acrylate and methacrylate esters of<br>
diglycidyl tetrabromo bisphenol S, acrylate and methacrylate esters of<br>
tetrahydrofuran, and the like. The monomers may be used alone or in combination<br>
with one or more of the following: epoxy acrylates and methacrylates; ethoxylated<br>
phenoxy acrylates and methacrylates; isobornyl acrylates and methacrylates; divinyl<br><br>
benzene; benzyl acrylates and methacrylates; polyethylene glycol diacrylates and<br>
dimethacrylates; N-vinyl carbazole, and the like.<br>
In formulations using ethoxylated bisphenol A, the weight percentages of the<br>
ethoxylated bisphenol A component may be about 1 to about 99, preferably about 4<br>
to about 80, more preferably about 20 to about 75 weight percent of the total weight<br>
of the resin composition. The ethoxylated bisphenol A component may be a mixture<br>
of at least two ethoxylated bisphenol A components, the first component of about 2<br>
to about 4 and the second component of about 9 to about 11 mole, preferably about 3<br>
and about 10 mole, respectively. The weight percentages for the first component<br>
may be about 30 to about 60 and the second about 0 to about 30 weight percent,<br>
preferably about 40 to about 50 and about 20 to about 30 weight percent,<br>
respectively, based on the total weight of the resin used. A preferred composition<br>
for use as the casting resin is about 30 to about 80 weight percent of ethoxylated<br>
bisphenol A diacrylate (preferably about 40 to about 50 weight percent of about 3<br>
mole and about 20 to about 30 weight percent of about 10 mole) and about 24 to<br>
about 50 weight percent of 2-phenoxyethyl acrylate. A particularly preferred<br>
composition is about 75 weight percent of ethoxylated bisphenol A (about 50 weight<br>
percent of about 3 mole and about 25 weight percent of about 20 mole) and about 24<br>
weight percent 2-phenoxyethyl acrylate.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method for producing a<br>
lens comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of the steps of: a.)<br>
exposing a mold assembly and a resin comprising, consisting essentially of, and<br>
consisting of about 30 to about 80 weight percent of ethoxylated bisphenol A<br>
diacrylate and about 24 to about 50 weight percent of 2-phenoxyethyl acrylate to<br>
low intensity UV light under conditions suitable to convert at least about 50 percent<br>
or more of the resin's reactive groups; and b.) exposing, subsequently, the resin to<br>
high intensity UV light under conditions suitable to complete through curing of the<br>
resin.<br><br>
The viscosity of the resin may be about 5 to about 500, preferably less than<br>
about 300, more preferably about 5 to about 300, most preferably about 5 to about<br>
100 centipoise measured at 25° C with a Brookfield viscometer. It is another<br>
discovery of the invention that it is possible to obtain a suitable resin with both a<br>
high refractive index and a viscosity of less than about 300 cp. One ordinarily<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that the weight percentages of the mono- and<br>
polyfunctional monomers must be controlled so as to achieve the desired viscosity.<br>
Additionally, the glass transition temperature, or Tg, of the cured resin used<br>
preferably is greater than about 45 ° C. One ordinarily skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that the Tg of the cured resin should not differ significantly, preferably not<br>
by more than about 1 to about 10° C from that of the material used to form the<br>
optical preform. Preferably, the Tg of the cured resin and optical preform material<br>
are substantially the same. Further, one ordinarily skilled in the art<br>
will recognize that the desired cured resin Tg is achievable by selection of<br>
monomers and their concentrations.<br>
The monomers selected may have about 0.04 to about 1.17; preferably about<br>
0.15 to about 1.2 equivalents of reactive groups per 100 g resin. Preferably, the<br>
monomers used contain about 0.4 to about 0.6 reactive group equivalents per 100 g<br>
resin. The amount of resin cast will be an amount effective to form a surface, which<br>
amount will depend on the resin selected, the parameters of the surface<br>
desired to be formed, and the size and shape of the surface on which the resin will be<br>
cast. Typically, the amount of resin used will be about 2 to about 20 g.<br>
Photoinitiators useful in the invention are those capable of initiating<br>
polymerization of the cast resin in the UV absorption spectrum selected. Suitable<br>
initiators include, without limitation, free-radical generating photoinitiators,<br><br>
photocationic initiators, photobase initiators, and mixtures thereof. Suitable free-<br>
radical generating initiators include, without limitation, methyl benzoyl formate,<br>
aromatic ketones including, without limitation, 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-l-phenyl-<br>
propan-1-one, 1-hydroxycyclohexylphenylketone, 2,2-di-secbutoxyacetophenone,<br>
2,2-diethoxyacetophenone, 2,2-diethoxy-2-phenyl-acetophenone, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-<br>
phenyl-acetophenone, benzoin methyl ether, benzoin isobutyl ether, benzoin, benzil,<br>
benzil dimethyl ketal, benzyl disulfide, 2,2-dihydroxybenzophenone,<br>
benzylideneacteophenone, benozphenone, and acetophenone, 2,4,6-<br>
trimethylbenzoyldiphenoylphosphine oxide, and the like, and combinations thereof.<br>
Suitable free-radical generating initiators are commercially available or methods for<br>
their production known.<br>
Exemplary photocationic initiators include, without limitation,<br>
triarylsulfonium salts, such as triphenylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonate and<br>
triphenylsulfonium hexafluorophospate, diarylodonium salts such as di-(4-<br>
dodecylphenyl)iodonium hexafiuorophosphate, aryl diazonium salts, and the like<br>
and combinations thereof. Suitable photocationic initiators are commercially<br>
available or methods for their production are known.<br>
Exemplary photobase initiators include, without limitation, ortho-nitrobenzyl<br>
carbamates such as 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyI carbamate, N-{[4,5-dimethoxy-2-<br>
nitrobenzyl)oxy]-carbonyl-2,6-dimethylpiperidine}, 3,5,-dimethoxy-a,a-<br>
dimethylbenzyl carbamates, benzoin carbamates such as 3,3\5,5'-dimethoxy<br>
benzoin carbamate, o-acyloximes, ammonium salts of a-ketocarboxylic acids, such<br>
as dimethyl benzyl ammonium phenylglyoxylate, cobalt (III) alkylamine complexes<br>
such as trans-[Co(pyridine)4Cl2]Cl, and the like, and combinations thereof. Methods<br>
for their production are disclosed in: 1.) Cameron, J.F. and J.M. Frechet, 113 J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc, 4303-4313 (1991); 2.) Cameron, J.F. and J.M. Frechet, 55 J. Org.<br>

Mater., 453-457 (1992).<br><br>
The amount of initiator used will depend on the type of initiator selected as<br>
well as the resin formulation used. Typically, the amount of initiator will be an<br>
amount effective to initiate polymerization, about 0.1 to about 5 weight percent<br>
based on the weight of the resin formulation, preferably about 0.1 to about 1 weight<br>
percent. In addition to a suitable initiator, the resin of the invention may include any<br>
desired additive, including without limitation, crosslinkers, viscosity control agents,<br>
and the like, and combinations thereof.<br>
One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that the curing of the resin<br>
may be carried out by curing methods in addition to the preferred UV light cure of<br>
the invention. For example, thermal, microwave, and infra-red radiation curing may<br>
be used alone or in combination with UV curing.<br>
Casting of the resin onto the preform to form a surface or surfaces may be<br>
accomplished by any known method. Suitable methods for casting one or more<br>
surfaces of a preform are disclosed in U. S. Patent Nos. 5,147,585, 5,178,800,<br>
5,219,497, 5,316,702, 5,358,672, 5,480,600, 5,512,371, 5,531,940, 5,702,819,<br>
5,793,465, 5,859,685, 5,861,934, and 5,907,386 incorporated herein in their<br>
entireties by reference.<br>
In general, the resin is dispensed into the mold assembly using any<br>
convenient means, such as by the use of a displacement pump. Preferably, the mold<br>
assembly is formed of one mold half and an optical preform, the preform acting as<br>
the second mold half. The resin may be dispensed so as to form, when cured, one or<br>
both of a convex and concave surface, preferably a convex surface, on the preform.<br>
Preferably, the mold half is positioned, the resin is dispensed onto a surface of the<br>
mold half and the preform is then contacted with the resin by placing the preform on<br>
the resin. Once the mold half and preform are positioned as desired, additional resin<br>
may be dispensed into the mold assembly to ensure the elimination of air bubbles<br>
and voids.<br><br>
Preferably, the mold half or halves used are of a greater diameter than that of<br>
the optical preform. This permits containment of the resin without the use of a<br>
gasket, sealing ring, or similar equipment. In those cases in which the curve radius<br>
of the preform surface in contact with the resin and mold half is less than that of the<br>
mold half, the use of a spacing means may be necessary. By "spacing means" is<br>
meant any equipment suitable for use in maintaining the desired distance between<br>
the mold half surface and the optical preform surface in contact with the resin.<br>
Exemplary equipment for use as spacing means include, without limitation, tapes,<br>
gaskets, O-rings, and the like.<br>
Once the curing of the resin is completed, the mold assembly is disassembled<br>
to separate the lens from the mold half or halves. Any convenient means may be<br>
used for separating the lens from the mold assembly including, without limitation,<br>
mechanical separation, thermal separation, and the like, and combinations thereof. It<br>
is a further discovery of the invention that disassembly may be achieved by using a<br>
water bath and ultrasound. More specifically, separation of the lens, including the<br>
cast surface, from the mold is achieved by using ultrasound in the range of about 25<br>
to about 150, preferably 40 to about 50 Khertz induced into a container filled or<br>
partially filled with water. The water temperature used will depend on the<br>
temperature of the mold assembly; the higher the mold assembly temperature, the<br>
higher the water temperature used. Typically, the water temperature will be about<br>
room temperature to about -5 ° C.<br>
Optionally, and preferably, following disassembly of the mold assembly, the<br>
lens is heated for a time and at a temperature suitable to relieve stresses resulting<br>
from the polymerization process. Heating may be carried out by any convenient<br>
method including, without limitation, using thermal, infrared, or microwave energy<br>
or combinations thereof. Preferably, the lens is heated using thermal energy for<br>
about<br><br>
1 to about 30, preferably about 5 to about 15 mins at a temperature of about 50 to<br>
about 125, preferably about 80 to about 110° C.<br>
One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that any type of lens<br>
including, without limitation, single vision, flat-top, multifocal including, without<br>
limitation, bifocal, trifocal, progressive, or the like, may be produced using the<br>
method of the invention. However, the invention may find greatest utility in the<br>
production of progressive addition lenses using surface casting. In embodiments in<br>
which the desired final lens is a bifocal, the preform, the added layer, or both must<br>
provide near vision power in addition to distance power. For embodiments in which<br>
the final lens is a progressive addition lens, the preform, cast layer, or both must<br>
provide near vision power, distance power and a zone of transition power between<br>
the distance and near vision power zones. For example, a surface of the preform or<br>
the cast layer may form a progressive addition surface thus providing a progressive<br>
addition lens as the final lens. By "progressive addition surface" is meant a<br>
continuous, aspheric surface having distance and near vision zones and a zone of<br>
transition power, or zone of increasing dioptric power, connecting the distance and<br>
near vision zones.<br>
The invention will be clarified by considering the following, non-limiting<br>
examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Examples 1 - 65<br>
The following procedure was used to form lenses using the process of the<br>
invention. A pre-weighed amount of a casting resin was dispensed onto the concave<br>
side of a glass mold that was 81 mm diameter. A 70 mm polycarbonate optical<br>
preform was placed on the resin and additional resin is dispensed, using a pipette, to<br>
ensure that no air bubbles or voids are present between the glass mold and preform.<br><br>
The UV light source was positioned below the glass mold. For examples 1<br>
through 33, the resin was then exposed to UV light of an intensity of approximately<br>
2.7 mW/cm2 and about 300 nm for 2 minutes and, subsequently of an intensity of<br>
approximately 250 mW/cm2 and 100 nm for 6 sees. For example 34, the resin was<br>
exposed to no low intensity UV light, but light only of an intensity of approximately<br>
358 mW/cm2 and about 300 nm for 15 sees. For example 42, the resin was exposed<br>
to UV light of an intensity of approximately 2.7 mW/cm2 and about 300 nm for 45<br>
sees and, subsequently, of an intensity of approximately about 1130 mW/cm2 and<br>
300 nm for 6 sees. For examples 43 through 53, the resin was exposed to low<br>
intensity UV light of 2.7 mW/cm2 for 120 sees and then exposed to UV light of an<br>
intensity of approximately 358 mW/cm2 for 15 sees. For examples 59 -62, the resin<br>
was exposed to low intensity UV light of 2.7 mW/cm2 for 45 sees on, 30 sees off,<br>
and 45 secs on. Subsequently, the resin was exposed to UV light of 1130 mW/cm2<br>
for 6 sees. The lens formed from the resin and preform was removed from the mold<br>
using ultrasound demolding and baked for 10 min at 100° in a convection oven.<br>
