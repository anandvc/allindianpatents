                                    FORMULA  (1)   <br><br>
 A PROCESS FOR PREPARING A COMPOUND <br><br>
4-[PHENIL -(PIPERDIN -4 -YL) -AMINO)]<br><br>
BENZAMIDE DERIVATIVE.<br><br><br>
/<br><br><br>
AstraZeneca AB, a Swedish company of S-l5l 85 SoSertalje, Sweden,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a compound 4-[Phenyl-(piperidin-4-yl-amino)benzamide derivative.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to novel compounds, to a process for their preparation, their use and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the novel compounds. The novel compounds are useful in therapy, and in particular for the treatment of pain, anxiety and functional gastrointestinal disorders.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
.The 6 receptor has been identified as having a role in many bodily functions such as circulatory andpain systems. Ligands for the 5 receptor may therefore find potential use as analgesics, and/or as antihypertensive agents. Ligands for the 5 receptor have also been shown to possess immunomodulatory activities.<br>
The identification of at least three different populations of opioid receptors (p., 8 and K) is now well established and all three are apparent in both central and peripheral nervous systems of many species including man. Analgesia has been observed in various animal models when one or more of these receptors has been activated. <br>
With few exceptions, currently available selective opioid 8 ligands are peptidic in nature and are unsuitable for administration by systemic routes. One example of a non-peptidic 5-agonist is SNCSO (Bilaky E.J. et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 273(1), pp. 359-366 (1995)). There is however still a need for selective S-agonists having not only improved selectivity, but also an improved side-effect profile.<br>
Thus, the problem underlying the present invention was to find new analgesics having improved analgesic effects, but also with an improved side-effect profile over current u agonists, as well as having improved systemic efficacy.<br><br><br>
Analgesics that have been identified and are existing in the prior art have many disadvantages in that they suffer from poor pharmacokinetics and are not analgesic when administered by systemic routes. Also, it has been documented that preferred 8agonist compounds, described within the prior art, show significant convulsive effects when administered systemically.<br>
We have now found certain compounds that exhibit surprisingly improved properties, i.a. improved 5-agonist potency, in vivo potency, pharmacokinetic, bioavailability, in vitro stability and/or lower toxicity.<br>

A preferred route of administration is orally, intravenously or intramuscularly. The dosage will depend on the route of administration, the severity of the disease, age and weight of the patient and other factors normally considered by the attending physician, when determining the individual regimen' and dosage level as the most appropriate for a particular patient.<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets, and suppositories.<br>
A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, or tablet disintegrating agents; it can also be an encapsulating material.<br>
In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.<br>
For preparing suppository compositions, a low-melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides and cocoa butter is first melted and the active ingredient is dispersed<br><br><br><br>
therein by, for example, stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds and allowed to cool and solidify.<br>
Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, lactose, sugar, pectin, dextrin, starch, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, a low-me]ting wax, cocoa butter, and the like.<br>

Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts are hydrochlorides, sulfates and bitartrates. The hydrochloride and sulfate salts are particularly preferred.<br>
 The term composition is intended to include the formulation of the active component with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component (with or without other carriers) is surrounded by a carrier which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets are included.<br><br>
,	<br>
Tablets, powders, cachets, and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
Liquid from compositions include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Sterile water or water-propylene glycol solutions of the active compounds may be mentioned as an example of liquid preparations suitable for parenteral administration. Liquid compositions can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.<br>
Aqueous solutions for oral administration can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavoring agents, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water together with a viscous material such as natural synthetic gums, resins, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and other suspending agents known to the pharmaceutical formulation art.<br>
Preferably the pharmaceutical compositions is in unit dosage form. In such form, the composition is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of the preparations, for example, packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet, or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these packaged forms.<br>
BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION<br>
In vitro model<br>
Cell culture<br>
A. Human 293S cells expressing cloned human \i, 8, and K receptors and neomycin resistance were grown in suspension at 37°C and 5% CO2 in shaker flasks containing<br>
-23-<br><br><br>
calcium-free DMEM10% FBS, 5% BCSS 0.1% Pluronic F-68, and 600 pg/ml geneticin.<br>
B. B. Mouse and rat brains were weighed and rinsed in ice-cold PBS (containing 2.5mM EDTA, pH 7.4). The brains were homogenized with a polytron for 15 sec (mouse) or 30 sec (rat) in ice-cold lysis buffer (50mM Tris, pH 7.0, 2.5mM EDTA, with phenylmethylsulfony] fluoride added just prior use to 0.5MmM from a 0.5M stock in DMSO:ethanol).<br>
 Membrane preparation<br>
Cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0,2.5 mM EDTA, with PMSF added just prior to use to 0.1 mM from a 0.1 M stock in ethanol), incubated on ice for 15 min, then homogenized with a polytron for 30 sec. The suspension was spun at lOOOg (max) for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was saved on ice and the pellets resuspended and spun as before. The supematants from both spins were combined and spun at 46,000 g(max) for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in cold Tris buffer (50 mM Tris/Cl, pH 7.0) and spun again. The final pellets were resuspended in membrane buffer ( 50 mM Tris, 0.32 M sucrose, pH 7.0). Aliquots (1 ml) in polypropylene tubes were frozen in dry ice/ethanol and stored at -70°C until use. The protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry assay with SDS.<br>
Binding assays<br>
Membranes were thawed at 37°C, cooled on ice, passed 3 times through a 25-gauge needle, and diluted into binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 3 mM MgCl2,1 mg/ml BSA (Sigma A-7888), pH 7.4, which was stored at 4°C after filtration through a 0.22 m filter, and to which had been freshly added 5 pg/ml aprotinin, 10 uM bestatin, 10 uM diprotin A, no DTT). Aliquots of 100 pi were added to iced 12x75 mm polypropylene tubes containing 100 pi of the appropriate radioligand and 100 pi of test compound at various concentrations. Total (TB) and nonspecific (NS) binding were determined in the absence<br><br><br>
and presence of 10 uM naloxone respectively. The tubes were vortexed and incubated at 25°C for 60-75 min, after which time the contents are rapidly vacuum-filtered and washed with about 12 ml/tube iced wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 3 rr M MgCI2) through GF/B filters (Whatman) presoaked for at least 2h in 0.1 % polyethyleneimine. The radioactivity (dpm) retained on the filters was measured with a beta counter after soaking the filters for at least ]2h in minivials containing 6-7 ml scintillation fluid. If the assay is set up in 96-place deep well plates, the filtration is over 96-place PEI-soaked unifilters, which were washed with 3 x 1 ml wash buffer, and dried in an oven at 55°C for 2h. The filter plates were counted in a TopCount (Packard) after adding 50 µ l MS-20 scintillation fluid/well.<br>
Functional Assays<br>
The agonist activity of the compounds is measured by determining the degree to which the compounds receptor complex activates the binding of GTP to G-proteins to which the receptors are coupled. In the GTP binding assay, GTP[y]35S is combined with test compounds and membranes from HEK-293S cells expressing the cloned human opioid receptors or from homogenised rat and mouse brain. Agonists stimulate GTP[y] S binding in these membranes. The EC50 and Ema)t values of compounds are determined from dose-response curves. Right shifts of the dose response curve by the delta antagonist naltrmdole are performed to verify that agonist activity is mediated through delta receptors.<br>
Procedure for rat brain GTP<br>
Rat brain membranes are thawed at 37°C, passed 3 times through a 25-gauge blunt-end needle and diluted in the GTPyS binding (50 mM Hepes, 20 mM NaOH, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4, Add fresh:  1 mM DTT, 0.1% BSA). 120nM GDP final is added membranes dilutions. The EC50 and Emax of compounds are evaluated from 10-point dose-response curves done in 300ul with the appropriate amount of membrane protein (20ug/well) and 100000-130000 dpm of GTPy^S per well (0.11 -0.14nM). The basal and maximal stimulated binding are determined in absence and presence of 3uM SNC-80<br><br><br><br>
Data analysis<br>
The specific binding (SB) was calculated as TB-NS, and the SB in the presence of various test compounds was expressed as percentage of control SB. Values of IC50 and Hill coefficient (nH) for ligands in displacing specifically bound radioligand were calculated from logit plots or curve fitting programs such as Ligand, GraphPad Prism, SigmaPlot, or ReceptorFit. Values of Kj were calculated from the Cheng-Prussoff equation. Mean ± S.E.M. values of IC50, Kj and nH were reported for ligands tested in at least three displacement curves. Biological activity of the compounds of the present invention is indicated in Table 2.<br>
Table 2: Biological data.<br><br>
Ex.	HDELTA (nM)	■   RAT BRAIN (nM)	MOUSE BRArN (UM)<br>
	IC50	EC50	%EMax	EC5o	%EMax	EC50	%EMax<br>
1-15	0.247-5.405	0.115-338.89	84.69-110.25	0.563-73.672	100.1-176.86	0.807-48.164	93.36-163.19<br>
Receptor saturation experiments<br>
Radioligand K8 values were determined by performing the binding assays on cell membranes with the appropriate radioligands at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 5 times the estimated Kg (up to 10 times if amounts of radioligand required are feasible). The specific radioligand binding was expressed as pmole/mg membrane protein. Values of Kg and Bmax from individual experiments were obtained from nonlinear firs of specifically bound (B) vs. nM free (F) radioligand from individual according to a one-site model.<br><br><br>
Acetic acid ("AcOH): 120 µ L of Acetic.Acid is added to 19.88 ml of distilled water in order to obtain a final volume of 20 ml with a final concentration of 0.6% AcOH. The solution is then mixed (vortex) and ready for injection.<br>
Compound ("drug): Each compound is prepared and dissolved in the most suitable vehicle according to standard procedures.<br>
(ii) Solutions administration<br>
The compound (drug) is administered orally, intraperitoneally (i.p.), subcutaneously (s.c.) or intravenously (i.v.)) at 10 ml/kg (considering the average mice body weight) 20, 30 or 40 minutes (according to the class of compound and its characteristics) prior to testing. When the compound is delivered centrally: Intraventricularly (i.c.v.) or intrathecally (i.t.) a volume of 5 µ L is administered.<br>
The AcOH is administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) in two sites at 10 ml/kg (considering the average mice body weight) immediately prior to testing.<br>
(iii) Testing<br>
The animal (mouse) is observed for a period of 20 minutes and the number of occasions (Writhing reflex) noted and compiled at the end of the experiment. Mice are kept in individual "shoe box" cages with contact bedding. A total of 4 mice are usually observed at the same time: one control and three doses of drug.<br>
For the anxiety and anxiety-like indications, efficacy has been established in the geller-seifter conflict test in the rat.<br>
For the functional gastrointestina disorder indication, efficacy can be established in the assay described by Coutinho SV et al, in American Journal of Physiology -Gastrointestinal &amp; Liver Physiology. 282(2):G307-16, 2002 Feb, in the rat.<br><br><br>
