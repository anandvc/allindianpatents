				<td>RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is related to (and where permitted by law, claims priority to)<br>
U.S. Provisional Application number 60/369,337 filed 03 April 2002, the contents of which<br>
are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention pertains generally to the field of biologically active compounds, and more specifically to certain hydroxamic acid compounds which inhibit HDAC (histone deacetylase) activity. The present invention also pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and the use of such compounds and compositions, both in vitro and in vivo, to inhibit HDAC, and in the treatment of conditions mediated by HDAC, cancer, proliferative conditions, psoriasis, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Throughout this specification, including any claims which follow, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise," and variations such as "comprises" and "comprising," will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.<br>
It must be noted that, as used in the specification and any appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a pharmaceutical carrier" includes mixtures of two or more such carriers, and the like.<br>
Ranges are often expressed herein as from "about" one particular value, and/or to "about" another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by the use of the antecedent "about," it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment.<br>
DNA in eukaryotic cells is tightly complexed with proteins (histones) to form chromatin. Histones are small, positively charged proteins which are rich in basic amino acids (positively charged at physiological pH), which contact the phosphate groups (negatively charged at physiological pH) of DNA. There are five main classes of histones, H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The amino acid sequences of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 show remarkable conservation between species, whereas H1 varies somewhat, and in some cases is replaced by another histone, e.g., H5. Four pairs of each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 together form a disk-shaped octomeric protein core, around which DNA (about 140 base pairs) is wound to form a nucleosome. Individual nucleosomes are connected by short stretches of linker DNA associated with another histone molecule (e.g., H1, or in certain cases, H5) to form a structure resembling a beaded string, which is itself arranged in a helical stack, known as a solenoid.<br>
The majority of histones are synthesised during the S phase of the cell cycle, and newly synthesised histones quickly enter the nucleus to become associated with DNA. Within minutes of its synthesis, new DNA becomes associated with histones in nucleosomal structures.<br>
A small fraction of histones, more specifically, the amino side chains thereof, are enzymatically modified by post-translational addition of methyl, acetyl, or phosphate groups, neutralising the positive charge of the side chain, or converting it to a negative charge. For example, lysine and arginine groups may be methylated, lysine groups may be acetylated, and serine groups may be phosphorylated. For lysine, the -(CH2)4-NH2 sidechain may be acetylated, for example by an acetyltransferase enzyme, to give the amide -(CH2)4-NHC(=O)CH3. Methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation of amino termini of histones which extend from the nucleosomal core affects chromatin structure and gene expression. (See, for example, Spencer and Davie, 1999).<br>
Acetylation and deacetylation of histones is associated with transcriptional events leading to cell proliferation and/or differentiation. Regulation of the function of transcription factors is also mediated through acetylation. Recent reviews of histone deacetylation include Kouzarides, 1999 and Pazin et al., 1997.<br>
The correlation between the acetylation status of histones and the transcription of genes has been known for over 30 years (see, for example, Howe et al., 1999). Certain<br>
enzymes, specifically acetylases (e.g., histone acetyltransferase, HAT) and deacetylases (e g., histone deacetylase, HDAC), which regulate the acetylation state of histones have been identified in many organisms and have been implicated in the regulation of numerous genes, confirming the link between acetylation and transcription. See, for example, Davie, 1998. In general, histone acetylation correlates with transcriptional activation, whereas histone deacetylation is associated with gene repression.<br>
A growing number of histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been identified (see, for example, Ng and Bird, 2000). The first deacetylase, HDAC1, was identified in 1996 (see, for example, Tauton et al., 1996). Subsequently, two other nuclear mammalian deacetylases were found, HDAC2 and HDAC3 (see, for example, Yang et al., 1996, 1997, and Emiliani et al., 1998). See also, Grozinger et al., 1999; Kao et al., 2000; and Van den Wyngaert et al., 2000.<br>
Eleven (11) human HDACs have been cloned so far: HDAC1 (Genbank Accession No. NP_004955) HDAC2 (Genbank Accession No. NP_001518) HDAC3 (Genbank Accession No. O15379) HDAC4 (Genbank Accession No. AAD29046) HDAC5 (Genbank Accession No. NP_005465) HDAC6 (Genbank Accession No. NP_006035) HDAC7 (Genbank Accession No. AAF63491) HDAC8 (Genbank Accession No. AAF73428) HDAC9 (Genbank Accession No. AAK66821) HDAC10 (Genbank Accession No. AAK84023) HDAC11 (Genbank Accession No. NM_024827<br>
These eleven human HDACs fall in two distinct classes: HDACs 1,2,3 and 8 are in class I, and HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 are in class II.<br>
There are a number of histone deacetylases in yeast, including the following-RPD3 (Genbank Accession No. NP_014069) HDA1 (Genbank Accession No. P53973) HOS1 (Genbank Accession No. Q12214) HOS2 (Genbank Accession No. P53096) HOS3 (Genbank Accession No. Q02959)<br>
There are also numerous plant deacetylases, for example, HD2, in Zea mays (Genbank Accession No. AF254073_1).<br>
HDACs function as part of large multiprotein complexes, which are tethered to the promoter and repress transcription. Well characterised transcriptional repressors such as Mad (Laherty et al., 1997), pRb (Brehm et al., 1998), nuclear receptors (Wong et al., 1998) and YY1 (Yang et al., 1997) associate with HDAC complexes to exert their repressor function.<br>
The study of inhibitors of histone deacetylases indicates that these enzymes play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation. The inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) (Yoshida et al., 1990a) causes cell cycle arrest at both G1 and G2 phases (Yoshida and Beppu, 1988), reverts the transformed phenotype of different cell lines, and induces differentiation of Friend leukaemia cells and others (Yoshida et al., 1990b). TSA (and SAHA) have been reported to inhibit cell growth, induce terminal differentiation, and prevent the formation of tumours in mice (Finnin et al., 1999).<br>
Trichostatin A (TSA)<br>
Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Cell cycle arrest by TSA correlates with an increased expression of gelsolin (Hoshikawa et al., 1994), an actin regulatory protein that is down regulated in malignant breast cancer (Mielnicki et al., 1999). Similar effects on cell cycle and differentiation have been observed with a number of deacetylase inhibitors (Kim et al., 1999).<br>
Trichostatin A has also been reported to be useful in the treatment of fibrosis, e.g., liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis.  See, e.g., Geerts et al., 1998.<br>
Recently, certain compounds that induce differentiation have been reported to inhibit histone deacetylases. Several experimental antitumour compounds, such as trichostatin A (TSA), trapoxin, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and phenylbutyrate have been reported to act, at least in part, by inhibiting histone deacetylase (see, e.g., Yoshida et al., 1990; Richon et al., 1998; Kijima et al., 1993). Additionally, diallyl sulfide and related molecules (see, e.g., Lea et al., 1999), oxamflatin (see, e.g., Kim et al., 1999, Sonoda et al., 1996), MS-27-275, a synthetic benzamide derivative (see, e.g., Saito et al , 1999; Suzuki et al., 1999; note that MS-27-275 was later re-named as MS-275), butyrate derivatives (see, e.g., Lea and Tulsyan, 1995), FR901228 (see, e.g., Nokajima et al., 1998), depudecin (see, e.g., Kwon et al., 1998), and m-carboxycinnamic acid bishydroxamide (see, e.g., Richon et al., 1998) have been reported to inhibit histone deacetylases. In vitro, some of these compounds are reported to inhibit the growth of fibroblast cells by causing cell cycle arrest in the G1 and G2 phases, and can lead to the terminal differentiation and loss of transforming potential of a variety of transformed cell lines (see, e.g., Richon et al., 1996; Kim et al., 1999; Yoshida et al., 1995; Yoshida &amp; Beppu, 1988). In vivo, phenybutyrate is reported to be effective in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in conjunction with retinoic acid (see, e.g., Warrell et al., 1998). SAHA is reported to be effective in preventing the formation of mammary tumours in rats, and lung tumours in mice (see, e.g., Desai et al., 1999).<br>
The clear involvement of HDACs in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation suggests that aberrant HDAC activity may play a role in cancer. The most direct demonstration that deacetylases contribute to cancer development comes from the analysis of different acute promyelocytic leukemias (APL). In most APL patients, a translocation of chromosomes 15 and 17 (t(15;17)) results in the expression of a fusion protein containing the N-terminal portion of PML gene product linked to most of RARa (retinoic acid receptor).  In some cases, a different translocation (t(11 ;17)) causes the fusion between the zinc finger protein PLZF and RARa. In the absence of ligand, the wild type RARa represses target genes by tethering HDAC repressor complexes to the promoter DNA. During normal hematopoiesis, retinoic acid (RA) binds RARa and displaces the repressor complex, allowing expression of genes implicated in myeloid differentiation. The RARa fusion proteins occurring in APL patients are no longer responsive to physiological levels of RA and they interfere with the expression of the RA-inducible genes that promote myeloid differentiation. This results in a clonal expansion of promyelocytic cells and development of leukaemia. In vitro experiments have shown that<br>
TSA is capable of restoring RA-responsiveness to the fusion RARa proteins and of allowing myeloid differentiation. These results establish a link between HDACs and oncogenesis and suggest that HDACs are potential targets for pharmaceutical intervention in APL patients. (See, for example, Kitamura et al., 2000; David et al., 1998, Lin et al., 1998).<br>
Furthermore, different lines of evidence suggest that HDACs may be important therapeutic targets in other types of cancer. Cell lines derived from many different cancers (prostate, colorectal, breast, neuronal, hepatic) are induced to differentiate by HDAC inhibitors (Yoshida and Horinouchi, 1999). A number of HDAC inhibitors have been studied in animal models of cancer. They reduce tumour growth and prolong the lifespan of mice bearing different types of transplanted tumours, including melanoma, leukaemia, colon, lung and gastric carcinomas, etc. (Ueda et al., 1994; Kim et al., 1999)<br>
Psoriasis is a common chronic disfiguring skin disease which is characterised by well-demarcated, red, hardened scaly plaques: these may be limited or widespread. The prevalence rate of psoriasis is approximately 2%, i.e., 12.5 million sufferers in the triad countries (US/Europe/Japan). While the disease is rarely fatal, it clearly has serious detrimental effects upon the quality of life of the patient: this is further compounded by the lack of effective therapies. Present treatments are either ineffective, cosmetically unacceptable, or possess undesired side effects. There is therefore a large unmet clinical need for effective and safe drugs for this condition.<br>
Psoriasis is a disease of complex etiology. Whilst there is clearly a genetic component, with a number of gene loci being involved, there are also undefined environmental triggers   Whatever the ultimate cause of psoriasis, at the cellular level, it is characterised by local T-cell mediated inflammation, by keratinocyte hyperproliferation, and by localised angiogenesis. These are all processes in which histone deacetylases have been implicated (see, e.g., Saunders et al., 1999; Bernhard et al., 1999; Takahashi et al., 1996; Kim et al , 2001). Therefore HDAC inhibitors may be of use in therapy for psoriasis. Candidate drugs may be screened, for example, using proliferation assays with T-cells and/or keratinocytes.<br>
Thus, one aim of the present invention is the provision of compounds which are potent inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs). There is a pressing need for such<br>
compounds, particularly for use as antiproliferatives, for example, anti-cancer agents, agents for the treatment of psoriasis, etc.<br>
Such molecules desirably have one or more of the following properties and/or effects:<br>
(a)	easily gain access to and act upon tumour cells;<br>
(b)	down-regulate HDAC activity;<br>
(c)	inhibit the formation of HDAC complexes;<br>
(d)	inhibit the interactions of HDAC complexes;<br>
(e)	inhibit tumour cell proliferation;<br>
(e)	promote tumour cell apoptosis;<br>
(f)	inhibit tumour growth; and,<br>
(g)	complement the activity of traditional chemotherapeutic agents.<br>

and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, amides, esters, ethers, chemically protected forms, and prodrugs thereof.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the hydroxamic acid group, -C(=O)NHOH, is unmodified (e.g., is not an ester).<br>
Note that each of the groups -J1-Q1-Cy and -J2-Q2-C(=O)NHOH is a monovalent and monodentate species; and that is it not intended that these groups be linked, other than via the N-1 and N-4 atoms, respectively, of the piperazin-1,4-diyl group.<br>
The Piperazin-1,4-diyl Group<br>
The piperazin-1,4-diyl group is optionally substituted, i.e., unsubstituted or substituted.<br>
In one embodiment, the piperazin-1,4-diyl group is unsubstituted (i.e., unsubstituted at the 2-, 3-, 5-, and 6-positions).<br>
In one embodiment, the piperazin-1,4-diyl group is substituted (i.e., substituted at one or more the 2-, 3-, 5-, and 6-positions.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, the piperazin-1,4-diyl group is substituted<br>
(i.e., substituted at one or more the 2-, 3-, 5-, and 6-positions with C1-4alkyl, for example, -<br>
Me or -Et.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, the piperazin-1,4-diyl group is: unsubstituted piperazin-1,4-diyl or 2-methyl-piperazin-1,4-diyl.<br>
The piperazin-1,4-diyl group may be in any conformation, including, but not limited to, chair-, boat-, or twist-forms.<br>
The Linkers, J1 and J2<br>
In one embodiment, J1 is independently a covalent bond. In one embodiment, J1 is independently -C(=O)-.<br>
In one embodiment, J2 is independently -C(=O)-. In one embodiment, J2 is independently -S(=O)2-.<br>
In one embodiment:<br>
J1 is a covalent bond and J2 is -C(=O)-; or:<br>
J1 is -C(=O)- and J2 is -C(=O)-; or:<br>
J1 is a covalent bond and J2 is -S(=O)2-.<br>
In one embodiment:<br>
J1 is a covalent bond and J2 is -C(=O)-; or:<br>
J1 is -C(=O)- and J2 is -C(=O)-.<br>
In one embodiment, J1 is a covalent bond and J2 is -C(=O)- (and the compounds may be referred to as "piperazino-amides"):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In one embodiment, J1 is -C(=O)- and J2 is -C(=O)- (and the compounds may be referred to as "piperazino-bisamides"):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In one embodiment, J1 is a covalent bond and J2 is -S(=O)2- (and the compounds may be referred to as "piperazino-sulfonamides"):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In one embodiment, J1 is -C(=O)- and J2 is -S(=O)2- (and the compounds may be referred to as "piperazino-amide-sulfonamides"):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that, if there is a -C(=O)- group immediately adjacent to the N-1 atom of the piperazin-1-4-diyl group, then that -C(=O)- group must be assigned as J1 (that is, J1 is -(C=O)-) and not as part of Q1 (e.g., as part of an oxo-substituted Q1 group). For example, if the Cy-Q1-J1- group is Ph-CH2-C(=O)-, then Cy is Ph-, Q1 is -CH2-, and J1 is -C(=O)-.<br>
Assigning the Cyclyl Group, Cy<br>
If, within the group -J1-Q1-Cy, there is a plurality of candidate groups satisfying the definition of Cy (referred to as candidate Cy groups), then the candidate Cy group which is furthest from from the N-1 atom of the piperazin-1,4-diyl group is identified as Cy (and referred to as "the relevant Cy group").<br>
In this context, distance (e.g., further, furthest) is measured as the number of chain atoms in the shortest continuous chain linking the groups (i.e., the N-1 atom and Cy).<br>
If there is a plurality of furthest candidate Cy groups, then the one (including any substituents) with the largest molecular weight is the relevant one.<br>
If there is a plurality of furthest heaviest candidate Cy groups, then the one (excluding any substituents) with the most annular heteroatoms is the relevant one.<br>
If there is a plurality of furthest heaviest candidate Cy groups with the most annular heteroatoms, then the one with an IUPAC name which alphabetically precedes the other(s), is the relevant one.<br>
Some illustrative examples are shown below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
If the group, Q1, is a cyclyl leader group (i.e., not a covalent bond) and/or J1 is -C(=O)-, the group -Q1-J1- has a backbone length, as determined by the number of chain atoms in the shortest continuous chain of atoms linking the relevant cyclyl group, Cy, and the N-1 atom of the piperazin-1,4-diyl group. In the following example, -Q1-J1- has a backbone length of 2.<br>

In one embodiment, Q1 is selected so that the N-1 atom of the piperazin-1,4-diyl group is not connected to a carbon atom which is connected to another carbon atom via a non-aromatic carbon-carbon double bond (i.e., C=C). That is, the N-1 atom of the piperazin-1,4-diyl group is not adjacent to a non-aromatic carbon-carbon double bond (i.e., C=C). In this way, groups such as -CH=CH- and -CH2-CH=CH- are excluded from Q1, but groups such as -CH=CH-CH2- are not.

In one embodiment, the group -J1-Q1- has a backbone of:<br>
from 1 to 7 atoms;<br>

In one embodiment, the group -J1-Q1- has a backbone of at least 3 atoms. In one embodiment, the group -J1-Q1- has a backbone of at least 4 atoms. In one embodiment, the group -J1-Q1- has a backbone of at least 5 atoms.<br>

Note that, for embodiments which are characterised by, or further characterised by, a backbone length limitation, corresponding changes in the description of that embodiment may be implicit. For example, for an embodiment wherein (a) Q1 is a partially unsaturated C2-7alkylene group and (b) Q1 has a backbone of 4 carbon atoms, the term "C2-7alkylene" group is necessarily, and implicitly, interpreted as "C4-7alkylene."<br>
The Cyclyl Leader Group, Q1: Substituents<br>
In one embodiment, Q1, if other than a covalent bond, is unsubstituted.<br>
In one embodiment, Q1, if other than a covalent bond, is optionally substituted.<br>
In one embodiment, Q1, if other than a covalent bond, is substituted.<br>
Examples of substituents on Q1 include, but are not limited to, those described under the heading "Substituents" below.<br>
In one embodiment, substituents on Q1, if present, are as defined under the heading "The Cyclyl Group, Cy: Optionally Substituted Phenyl: Substituents."<br>
In one embodiment, substituents on Q1, if present, are independently: halo, hydroxy, ether (e.g., C1-7alkoxy), C5-20aryl, acyl, amino, amido, acylamido, or oxo.<br>
In one embodiment, substituents on Q1, if present, are independently: -F, -CI, -Br, -I, -OH, -OMe, -OEt, -OPr, -Ph, -NH2, -CONH2, or =O.<br>
In one embodiment, substituents on Q1, if present, are independently -OH or -Ph.<br>
In one embodiment, substituents on Q1, if present, are independently -Ph.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, Q1 is unsubstituted methylene, and is -CH2-; in one embodiment, Q1 phenyl (-Ph) substituted methylene, and is -CH(Ph)-.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, Q1 is unsubstituted ethylene, and is -CH2-CH2-; in one embodiment, Q1 is oxo (=O) substituted ethylene, and is -C(=O)-CH2-; in one embodiment, Q1 is hydroxy (-0H) substituted ethylene, and is -CH(OH)-CH2-; in one embodiment, Q1 is phenyl (-Ph) substituted ethylene, and is -CH2CH(Ph)-.<br>
Again, for the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that, if there is a -C(=O)- group immediately adjacent to the N-1 atom of the piperazin-1-4-diyl group, then that -C(=O)-group must be assigned as J1 (that is, J1 is -(C=O)-) and not as part of Q1 (e.g., as part of an oxo-substituted Q1 group). For example, if the Cy-Q1-J1- group is Ph-CH2-C(=O)-, then Cy is Ph-, Q1 is -CH2-, and J1 is -C(=O)-.<br>

The Acid Leader Group, Q2: Backbone Length<br>
The acid leader group, Q2, has a backbone length, as determined by the number of chain atoms in the shortest continuous chain of atoms linking the N-4 atom of the piperazin-1,4-diyl group and the hydroxamic acid group, -C(=O)NHOH.<br>
If Q2 is alkylene, Q2 necessarily has a backbone of at least 1 atom. Some examples are shown below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
If Q2 is arylene, arylene-alkylene, alkylene-arylene, alkylene-arylene-alkylene,<br>
Q2 necessarily has a backbone of at least 2 atoms. Some examples are shown below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that Q2 groups with shorter backbone lengths prevent or reduce the interaction of the hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NHOH) with HDAC (or its complexes), and thereby reduce the compound's activity as an HDAC inhibitor.<br>
In one embodiment, Q2 has a backbone of at least 4 atoms. In one embodiment, Q2 has a backbone of at least 5 atoms. In one embodiment, Q2 has a backbone of at least 6 atoms.<br>
In one embodiment, Q2 has a backbone of: from 4 to 8 atoms; from 4 to 7 atoms; from 4 to 6 atoms; or, from 4 to 5 atoms.<br>
In one embodiment, Q2 has a backbone of: from 5 to 8 atoms; or from 5 to 7 atoms; or from 5 to 6 atoms.<br>
In one embodiment, Q2 has a backbone of from 5 to 6 atoms.<br>
In one embodiment, Q2 has a backbone of 4 atoms. In one embodiment, Q2 has a backbone of 5 atoms. In one embodiment, Q2 has a backbone of 6 atoms. In one embodiment, Q2 has a backbone of 7 atoms. In one embodiment, Q2 has a backbone of 8 atoms.<br>
In one embodiment, the backbone of "atoms" is a backbone of "carbon atoms."<br>
Note that, for embodiments which are characterised by, or further characterised by, a backbone length limitation, corresponding changes in the description of that embodiment may be implicit. For example, for an embodiment wherein (a) Q2 is a partially unsaturated C2-8alkylene group and (b) Q2 has a backbone of 4 carbon atoms, the term "C2-8alkylene" group is necessarily, and implicitly, interpreted as "C4-8alkylene."<br>
The Acid Leader Group, Q2: Substitution<br>
In one embodiment, Q2 is unsubstituted.<br>
In one embodiment, Q2 is optionally substituted.<br>
In one embodiment, Q2 is substituted.<br>
The backbone atoms of the acid leader group, Q2, which link J and the hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)IMHOH), are denoted α, ß, , δ, etc., starting with the backbone atom adjacent to the hydroxamic acid group. Some examples are illustrated below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that groups (e.g., substituents), particularly bulky groups (e.g., substituents), at the α-position, or at either or both of the α- and ß -positions, prevent or reduce the interaction of the hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NHOH) with HDAC (or its complexes), and thereby reduce the compound's activity as an HDAC inhibitor.<br>
In one embodiment, Q2 is, additionally, unsubstituted at the α-position.<br>
In one embodiment, Q2 is, additionally, unsubstituted at the α-position and unsubstituted at the ß-position.<br>
Note that, in some embodiments, Q2 may have a non-linear alkylene group (for example, a branched alkylene) adjacent to the hydroxamic acid group. An example, wherein Q2 is a branched saturated C6-alkylene, having a methyl group at the a-position, is shown below. Although there is a group (i.e., a methyl group) at the a-position, such compounds are unsubstituted at the a-position, because the a-methyl group itself is considered to be part of the unsubstituted Q2. Another example, wherein Q2 is a branched saturated C6-alkylene, having an amino group at the a-position and a methyl group at the P-position, is shown below; such compounds are a-substituted, P-unsubstituted.<br>

Bidentate Substituents<br>
The term "bidentate substituents," as used herein, pertains to substituents which have two points of covalent attachment, and which act as a linking group between two other moieties.<br>
In some cases (A), a bidentate substituent is covalently bound to a single atom. In some cases (B), a bidentate substituent is covalently bound to two different atoms, and so serves as a linking group therebetween.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Within (B), in some cases (C), a bidentate substituent is covalently bound to two different atoms, which themselves are not otherwise covalently linked (directly, or via intermediate groups).  In some cases (D), a bidentate substituent is covalently bound to two different atoms, which themselves are already covalently linked (directly, or via intermediate groups); in such cases, a cyclic structure results. In some cases, the bidentate group is covalently bound to vicinal atoms, that is, adjacent atoms, in the parent group.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In some cases (A and D), the bidentage group, together with the atom(s) to which it is attached (and any intervening atoms, if present) form an additional cyclic structure.  In this way, the bidentate substituent may give rise to a cyclic or polycyclic (e.g., fused, bridged, spiro) structure, which may be aromatic.<br>
Examples of bidentate groups include, but are not limited to, C1-7alkylene groups, C3-20heterocyclylene groups, and C5-20arylene groups, and substituted forms thereof.<br>
Alkylene<br>
Alkylene: The term "alkylene," as used herein, pertains to a bidentate moiety obtained by removing two hydrogen atoms, either both from the same carbon atom, or one from each of two different carbon atoms, of a hydrocarbon compound having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms (unless otherwise specified), which may be aliphatic or alicyclic, and which may be saturated, partially unsaturated, or fully unsaturated. Thus, the term "alkylene" includes the sub-classes alkenylene, alkynylene, cycloalkylene, etc., discussed below.<br>
In this context, the prefixes (e.g., C1-4, C1-7, C1-20, C2-7, C3-7, etc.) denote the number of carbon atoms, or range of number of carbon atoms. For example, the term "C1-4alkylene," as used herein, pertains to an alkylene group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of groups of alkylene groups include C1-4alkylene ("lower alkylene"), C1-7alkylene, and C1-20alkylene.<br>
Examples of linear saturated C1-7alkylene groups include, but are not limited to, -(CH2)n-where n is an integer from 1 to 7, for example, -CH2- (methylene), -CH2CH2- (ethylene), -CH2CH2CH2- (propylene), and -CH2CH2CH2CH2- (butylene).<br>

Examples of alicyclic saturated C1-7alkylene groups include, but are not limited to, cyclopentylene (e.g., cyclopent-1,3-ylene), and cyclohexylene (e.g., cyclohex-1,4-ylene).<br>
Examples of alicyclic partially unsaturated C1-7alkylene groups include, but are not limited to, cyclopentenylene (e.g., 4-cyclopenten-1,3-ylene), cyclohexenylene (e.g., 2-cyclohexen-1,4-ylene; 3-cyclohexen-1,2-ylene; 2,5-cyclohexadien-1,4-ylene).<br>
Arylene<br>
Arylene: The term "arylene," as used herein, pertains to a bidentate moiety obtained by removing two hydrogen atoms, one from each of two different aromatic ring atoms of an aromatic compound, which moiety has from 3 to 20 ring atoms (unless otherwise specified). Preferably, each ring has from 5 to 7 ring atoms.<br>
In this context, the prefixes (e.g., C3-20, C5-7, C5-6, etc.) denote the number of ring atoms, or range of number of ring atoms, whether carbon atoms or heteroatoms.  For example, the term "C5-6arylene," as used herein, pertains to an arylene group having 5 or 6 ring atoms. Examples of groups of arylene groups include C3-20arylene, C3-12arylene, C5-12arylene, C5-7arylene, and C5-6arylene.<br>
The ring atoms may be all carbon atoms, as in "carboarylene groups" (e.g., C5-20carboarylene).<br>
Alternatively, the ring atoms may include one or more heteroatoms, as in "heteroarylene groups" (e.g., C5-20heteroarylene).<br>
Examples of C5-20arylene groups which do not have ring heteroatoms<br>
(i.e., C5-20carboarylene groups) include, but are not limited to, those derived from the<br>
compounds discussed above in regard to carboaryl groups.<br>
Examples of C5-20heteroarylene groups include, but are not limited to, those derived from the compounds discussed above in regard to heteroaryl groups.<br>
Includes Other Forms<br>
Unless otherwise specified, included in the above are the well known ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of these substituents. For example, a reference to carboxylic acid (-COOH) also includes the anionic (carboxylate) form (-COO), a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms. Similarly, a reference to an amino group includes the protonated form (-N+HR1R2), a salt or solvate of the amino group, for example, a hydrochloride salt, as well as conventional protected forms of an amino group. Similarly, a reference to a hydroxyl group also includes the anionic form (-0), a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms.<br>
Isomers, Salts, Solvates, Protected Forms, and Prodrugs<br>
Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric, optical, enantiomeric, diasteriomeric, epimeric, atropic, stereoisomeric, tautomeric, conformational, or anomeric forms, including but not limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and Z-forms; c-, t-, and r-forms; endo- and exo-forms; R-, S-, and meso-forms; D- and L-forms; d- and l-forms; (+) and (-) forms; keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms; syn- and anti-forms; synclinal- and anticlinal-forms; α- and ß-forms; axial and equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and halfchair-forms; and combinations thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as "isomers" (or "isomeric forms").<br>
Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term "isomers," as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e., isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space). For example, a reference to a methoxy group, -OCH3, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH. Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl. However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g., C1-7alkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para-methoxyphenyl).<br>
The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, N-nitroso/hyroxyazo, and nitro/aci-nitro.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Note that specifically included in the term "isomer" are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including 1H, 2H (D), and 3H (T); C may be in any isotopic form, including 12C, 13C, and 14C; O may be in any isotopic form, including 160 and 180; and the like.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or partially) racemic and other mixtures thereof. Methods for the preparation (e.g., asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g., fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also includes ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of thereof, for example, as discussed below.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding salt of the active compound, for example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al., 1977, "Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts," J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 66, pp. 1-19.<br>
For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g., -COOH may be -COO"), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na+ and K+, alkaline earth cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, and other cations such as Al+3. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH4+) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NH3R+, NH2R2+, NHR3+, NR4+).  Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine,<br>
ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3)4+.<br>
If the compound is cationic, or has a functional group which may be cationic (e.g., -NH2 may be -NH3+), then a salt may be formed with a suitable anion. Examples of suitable inorganic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following inorganic acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, nitrous, phosphoric, and phosphorous.<br>
Examples of suitable organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following organic acids: 2-acetyoxybenzoic, acetic, ascorbic, aspartic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, cinnamic, citric, edetic, ethanedisulfonic, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, glucheptonic, gluconic, glutamic, glycolic, hydroxymaleic, hydroxynaphthalene carboxylic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauric, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, mucic, oleic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phenylsulfonic, propionic, pyruvic, salicylic, stearic, succinic, sulfanilic, tartaric, toluenesulfonic, and valeric. Examples of suitable polymeric organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following polymeric acids: tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound. The term "solvate" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute (e.g., active compound, salt of active compound) and solvent.  If the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the active compound in a chemically protected form. The term "chemically protected form" is used herein in the conventional chemical sense and pertains to a compound in which one or more reactive functional groups are protected from undesirable chemical reactions under specified conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, radiation, solvent, and the like).  In practice, well known chemical methods are employed to reversibly render unreactive a functional group, which otherwise would be reactive, under specified conditions. In a chemically protected form, one or more reactive functional groups are in the form of a protected or protecting group (also known as a masked or masking group or a blocked or blocking group). By protecting a reactive functional group, reactions involving other unprotected reactive<br>
functional groups can be performed, without affecting the protected group; the protecting group may be removed, usually in a subsequent step, without substantially affecting the remainder of the molecule. See, for example, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999).<br>
A wide variety of such "protecting," "blocking," or "masking" methods are widely used and well known in organic synthesis. For example, a compound which has two nonequivalent reactive functional groups, both of which would be reactive under specified conditions, may be derivatized to render one of the functional groups "protected," and therefore unreactive, under the specified conditions; so protected, the compound may be used as a reactant which has effectively only one reactive functional group. After the desired reaction (involving the other functional group) is complete, the protected group may be "deprotected" to return it to its original functionality.<br>
For example, a hydroxy group may be protected as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=O)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (-OC(=O)CH3, -OAc).<br>
For example, an aldehyde or ketone group may be protected as an acetal (R-CH(OR)2) or ketal (R2C(OR)2), respectively, in which the carbonyl group (&gt;C=O) is converted to a diether (&gt;C(OR)2), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid.<br>
For example, an amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (-NRCO-R) or a urethane (-NRCO-OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHCO-CH3); a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OCH2C6H5, -NH-Cbz); as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)3, -NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)2C6H4C6H5, -NH-Bpoc), as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc), as a 2(-phenylsulphonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NH-Psec); or, in suitable cases (e.g., cyclic amines), as a nitroxide radical (&gt;N-O•).<br>
For example, a carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an C1-7alkyl ester (e.g., a methyl ester; a t-butyl ester); a C1-7haloalkyl ester (e.g., a<br>
C1-7trihaloalkyl ester); a triC1-7alkylsilyl-C1-7alkyI ester; or a C5-20aryl-C1-7alkyl ester (e.g., a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide.<br>
For example, a thiol group may be protected as a thioether (-SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (-S-CH2NHC(=O)CH3).<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the active compound in the form of a prodrug. The term "prodrug," as used herein, pertains to a compound which, when metabolised (e.g., in vivo), yields the desired active compound. Typically, the prodrug is inactive, or less active than the active compound, but may provide advantageous handling, administration, or metabolic properties.<br>
For example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g., a physiologically acceptable metabolically labile ester). During metabolism, the ester group (-C(=O)OR) is cleaved to yield the active drug. Such esters may be formed by esterification, for example, of any of the carboxylic acid groups (-C(=O)OH) in the parent compound, with, where appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive groups present in the parent compound, followed by deprotection if required.<br>
Examples of such metabolically labile esters include those of the formula -C(=O)OR<br>
wherein R is:<br>
C1-7alkyl (e.g., -Me, -Et, -nPr, -iPr, -nBu, -sBu, -iBu, -tBu);<br>
C1-7aminoalkyl (e.g., aminoethyl; 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl; 2-(4-morpholino)ethyl); and<br>
acyloxy-C1-7alkyl<br>
(e.g., acyloxymethyl;<br>
acyloxyethyl;<br>
pivaloyloxymethyl;<br>
acetoxymethyl;<br>
1-acetoxyethyl;<br>
1-(1-methoxy-1-methyl)ethyl-carbonxyloxyethyl;<br>
1 -(benzoyloxy)ethyl; isopropoxy-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1 -isopropoxy-carbonyloxyethyl; cyclohexyl-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1-cyclohexyl-carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1-cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy) carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1-(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy)carbonyloxyethyl; (4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxymethyl; and 1-(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxyethyl).<br>
Also, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active compound, or a compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields the active compound (for example, as in ADEPT, GDEPT, LIDEPT, etc.). For example, the prodrug may be a sugar derivative or other glycoside conjugate, or may be an amino acid ester derivative.<br>

a halt in the rate of progress, amelioration of the condition, and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure (i.e., prophylaxis) is also included.<br>
The term "therapeutically-effective amount," as used herein, pertains to that amount of an active compound, or a material, composition or dosage form comprising an active compound, which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
The term "treatment" includes combination treatments and therapies, in which two or more treatments or therapies are combined, for example, sequentially or simultaneously. Examples of treatments and therapies include, but are not limited to, chemotherapy (the administration of active agents, including, e.g., drugs, antibodies (e.g., as in immunotherapy), prodrugs (e.g., as in photodynamic therapy, GDEPT, ADEPT, etc.); surgery; radiation therapy; and gene therapy.<br>

Formulations<br>
While it is possible for the active compound to be used (e.g., administered) alone, it is often preferable to present it as a formulation.<br>
Thus, one aspect of the present invention pertains to a composition comprising a compound, as described herein, and a carrier.<br>
In one embodiment, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., formulation, preparation, medicament) comprising a compound, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
In one embodiment, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound, as described herein, together with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art, including, but not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients, adjuvants, fillers, buffers, preservatives, anti-oxidants, lubricants, stabilisers, solubilisers, surfactants (e.g., wetting agents), masking agents, colouring agents, flavouring agents, and sweetening agents.<br>
In one embodiment, the composition further comprises other active agents, for example, other therapeutic or prophylactic agents.<br>
Suitable carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts. See, for example, Handbook fo Pharmaceutical Additives, 2nd Edition (eds. M. Ash and I. Ash), 2001 (Synapse Information Resources, Inc., Endicott, New York, USA), Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1990; and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 2nd edition, 1994.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention pertains to methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art, e.g., carriers, diluents, excipients, etc.  If formulated as discrete units (e.g., tablets, etc.), each unit contains a predetermined amount (dosage) of the active compound.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein pertains to compounds, ingredients, materials, compositions, dosage forms, etc., which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of the subject in question (e.g., human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, diluent, excipient, etc. must also be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
The formulations may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound<br>
with carriers (e.g., liquid carriers, finely divided solid carrier, etc.), and then shaping the product, if necessary.<br>
The formulation may be prepared to provide for rapid or slow release; immediate, delayed, timed, or sustained release; or a combination thereof.<br>
Formulations may suitably be in the form of liquids, solutions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), suspensions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), emulsions (e.g., oil-in-water, water-in-oil), elixirs, syrups, electuaries, mouthwashes, drops, tablets (including, e.g., coated tablets), granules, powders, losenges, pastilles, capsules (including, e.g., hard and soft gelatin capsules), cachets, pills, ampoules, boluses, suppositories, pessaries, tinctures, gels, pastes, ointments, creams, lotions, oils, foams, sprays, mists, or aerosols.<br>
Formulations may suitably be provided as a patch, adhesive plaster, bandage, dressing, or the like which is impregnated with one or more active compounds and optionally one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients, including, for example, penetration, permeation, and absorption enhancers. Formulations may also suitably be provided in a the form of a depot or reservoir.<br>
The active compound may be dissolved in, suspended in, or admixed with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients. The active compound may be presented in a liposome or other microparticulate which is designed to target the active compound, for example, to blood components or one or more organs.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration (e.g, by ingestion) include liquids, solutions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), suspensions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), emulsions (e.g., oil-in-water, water-in-oil), elixirs, syrups, electuaries, tablets, granules, powders, capsules, cachets, pills, ampoules, boluses.<br>
Formulations suitable for buccal administration include mouthwashes, losenges, pastilles, as well as patches, adhesive plasters, depots, and reservoirs. Losenges typically comprise the active compound in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth. Pastilles typically comprise the active compound in an inert matrix, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia. Mouthwashes typically comprise the active compound in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Formulations suitable for sublingual administration include tablets, losenges, pastilles, capsules, and pills.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral transmucosal administration include liquids, solutions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), suspensions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), emulsions (e.g., oil-in-water, water-in-oil), mouthwashes, losenges, pastilles, as well as patches, adhesive plasters, depots, and reservoirs.<br>
Formulations suitable for non-oral transmucosal administration include liquids, solutions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), suspensions (e.g., aqueous, non-aqueous), emulsions (e.g., oil-in-water, water-in-oil), suppositories, pessaries, gels, pastes, ointments, creams, lotions, oils, as well as patches, adhesive plasters, depots, and reservoirs.<br>
Formulations suitable for transdermal administration include gels, pastes, ointments, creams, lotions, and oils, as well as patches, adhesive plasters, bandages, dressings, depots, and reservoirs.<br>
Tablets may be made by conventional means, e.g., compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with one or more binders (e.g., povidone, gelatin, acacia, sorbitol, tragacanth, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose); fillers or diluents (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, silica); disintegrants (e.g., sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose); surface-active or dispersing or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate); preservatives (e.g., methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, sorbic acid); flavours, flavour enhancing agents, and sweeteners. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active compound therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile. Tablets may optionally be provided with a coating, for example, to affect release, for example an enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach.<br>
Ointments are typically prepared from the active compound and a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base.<br>
Creams are typically prepared from the active compound and an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least about 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active compound through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related analogues.<br>
Emulsions are typically prepared from the active compound and an oily phase, which may optionally comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), or it may comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabiliser. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabiliser(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and/or fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.<br>
Suitable emulgents and emulsion stabilisers include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate and sodium lauryl sulphate. The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations may be very low. Thus the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.<br>
Formulations suitable for intranasal administration, where the carrier is a liquid, include, for example, nasal spray, nasal drops, or by aerosol administration by nebuhser, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active compound.<br>
Formulations suitable for intranasal administration, where the carrier is a solid, include, for example, those presented as a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 to about 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose.<br>
Formulations suitable for pulmonary administration (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation therapy) include those presented as an aerosol spray from a pressurised pack, with the use of a suitable propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichoro-tetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gases.<br>
Formulations suitable for ocular administration include eye drops wherein the active compound is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active compound.<br>
Formulations suitable for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols, for example, cocoa butter or a salicylate; or as a solution or suspension for treatment by enema.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active compound, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection), include aqueous or non-aqueous, isotonic, pyrogen-free, sterile liquids (e.g., solutions, suspensions), in which the active compound is dissolved, suspended, or otherwise provided (e.g., in a liposome or other microparticulate). Such liquids may additional contain other pharmaceutical^ acceptable ingredients, such as anti-oxidants, buffers, preservatives, stabilisers, bacteriostats, suspending agents, thickening agents, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood (or other relevant bodily fluid) of the intended recipient. Examples of excipients include, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable<br>
oils, and the like. Examples of suitable isotonic carriers for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Solution, or Lactated Ringer's Injection. Typically, the concentration of the active compound in the liquid is from about 1 ng/ml to about 10 ug/ml, for example from about 10 ng/ml to about 1 ug/ml. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets.<br>
Dosage<br>
It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that appropriate dosages of the active compounds, and compositions comprising the active compounds, can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in combination, the severity of the condition, and the species, sex, age, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, veterinarian, or clinician, although generally the dosage will be selected to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.<br>
Administration can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell(s) being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician, veterinarian, or clinician.<br>
In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 0.1 to about 250 mg per kilogram body weight of the subject per day. Where the active compound is a<br>
salt, an ester, an amide, a prodrug, or the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately.<br>
Kits<br>
One aspect of the invention pertains to a kit comprising (a) the active ingredient, preferably provided in a suitable container and/or with suitable packaging; and (b) instructions for use, for example, written instructions on how to administer the active compound, etc.<br>
The written instructions may also include a list of indications for which the active ingredient is a suitable treatment.<br>

The mixture was stirred at ice bath temperature for 30 minutes and a solution of appropriate piperazine (2.75 mmol) in dimethylformamide (3 mL) was added (if the piperazine was used in a hydrochloride form triethylamine (1.0 mL) before the piperazine hydrochloride to the reaction mixture was added). The mixture was stirred at ice bath temperature for 1 hour followed by 20 hours at room temperature. Then the reaction mixture was diluted with brine (50 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 25 mL). The organic phase was washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4), and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel with appropriate eluent to give the corresponding reaction product.<br>

HPLC analysis on Alltima C18: 
Biological Activity<br>
Candidate compounds were assessed for their ability to inhibit deacetylase activity (biochemical assays) and to inhibit cell proliferation (cell-based antiproliferation assays), as described below.<br>
Primary Assay (1): Deacetylase Activity<br>
Briefly, this assay relies on the release of radioactive acetate from a radioactively labelled histone fragment by the action of HDAC enzyme. Test compounds, which inhibit HDAC, reduce the yield of radioactive acetate. Signal (e.g., scintillation counts) measured in the presence and absence of a test compound provide an indication of that compound's ability to inhibit HDAC activity. Decreased activity indicates increased inhibition by the test compound.<br>
The histone fragment was an N-terminal sequence from histone H4, and it was labelled with radioactively labelled acetyl groups using tritiated acetylcoenzyme A (coA) in conjunction with an enzyme which is the histone acetyltransferase domain of the transcriptional coactivator p300. 0.33 mg of peptide H4 (the N-terminal 20 amino acids of histone H4, synthesized using conventional methods) were incubated with His6-tagged p300 histone acetyltransferase domain (amino acids 1195-1673, expressed in E. coli strain BLR(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Cat. No. 69451-3) and 3H-acetyl coA (10 uL of 3.95 Ci/mmol; from Amersham) in a total volume of 300 uL of HAT buffer (50 mM TrisCI pH 8, 5% glycerol, 50 mM KCI, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF)). The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 45 min after which the His-p300 was removed using nickel-trinitriloacetic acid agarose (Qiagen, Cat No. 30210). The acetylated peptide was then separated from free acetyl coA by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-15 (Sigma G-15-120), using distilled H20 as the mobile phase.<br>
After purification of the radiolabeled histone fragment, it was incubated with a source of HDAC (e.g., an extract of HeLa cells (a rich source of HDAC), recombinantly produced HDAC1 or HDAC2) and any released acetate was extracted into an organic phase and quantitatively determined using scintillation counting. By including a test compound with the source of HDAC, that compound's ability to inhibit the HDAC was determined.<br>
Primary Assay (2): Deacetylase Activity: Fluorescent Assay<br>
Alternatively, the activity of the compounds as HDAC inhibitors was determined using a commercially available fluorescent assay kit: (Fluor de Lys™, BioMol Research Labs, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, USA). HeLa extract was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C in assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, 137 mM NaCI, 2.7 mM KCI, 1 mM MgCI2, pH 8.0) with 15 µM acetylated substrate in the presence of test compound (HDAC inhibitor). The extent of deacetylation was determined by the addition of 50 uL of a 1-in-500 dilution of Developer, and measurement of the fluorescence (excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm), according to the instructions provided with the kit.<br>
Extensive comparative studies have shown that Primary Assay (1) and Primary Assay (2), discussed above, yield equivalent results. Primary Assay results reported herein are (a) exclusively from (1); (b) exclusively from (2); or (c) from both (1) and (2).<br><br>
HeLa Cell Extract<br>
The HeLa cell extract was made from HeLa cells (ATCC Ref. No. CCL-2) by freeze-thawing three times in 60 mM TrisCI pH 8.0, 450 mM NaCI, 30% glycerol. Two cell volumes of extraction buffer were used, and particulate material was centrifuged out (20800 g, 4°C, 10 min). The supernatant extract having deacetylase activity was aliquotted and frozen for storage.<br>
Recombinantly Produced HDAC1 and HDAC2<br>
Recombinant plasmids were prepared as follows.<br>
Full length human HDAC1 was cloned by PCR using a Agt11 Jurkat cDNA library (Clontech-HL5012b). The amplified fragment was inserted into the EcoRI-Sall sites of pFlag-CTC vector (Sigma-E5394), in frame with the Flag tag. A second PCR was carried out in order to amplify a fragment containing the HDAC1 sequence fused to the Flag tag. The resulting fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI-Sac1 sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pAcHTL-C (Pharmingen-21466P).<br>
Full length mouse HDAC2 was subcloned into pAcHLT-A baculovirus transfer vector (Pharmingen-21464P) by PCR amplification of the EcoRI-Sad fragment from a HDAC2-pFlag-CTC construct.<br>
Recombinant protein expression and purification was performed as follows.<br>
HDAC1 and HDAC2 recombinant baculoviruses were constructed using BaculoGold Transfection Kit (Pharmingen-554740). Transfer vectors were co-transfected into SF9 insect cells (Pharmingen-21300C). Amplification of recombinant viruses was performed according to the Pharmingen Instruction Manual. SF9 cells were maintained in serum-free SF900 medium (Gibco 10902-096).<br>
For protein production, 2x107 cells were infected with the appropriate recombinant virus for 3 days. Cells were then harvested and spun at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes. They were then washed twice in PBS and resuspended in 2 pellet volumes of lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, 400 mM KCI, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM AEBSF). Resuspended cells were frozen on dry ice and thawed at 37°C 3 times and centrifuged for<br>
10 minutes at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was collected and incubated with 300 ul of 50% Ni-NTA agarose bead slurry (Qiagen-30210). Incubation was carried out at 4°C for 1 hour on a rotating wheel. The slurry was then centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes.  Beads were washed twice in 1 ml of wash buffer (25 mM HEPES pH7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, 150 mM KCI, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM AEBSF). Protein was eluted 3 times in 300 ul elution buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, 250 mM KCI, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM AEBSF) containing increasing concentrations of imidazole: 0.2 M, 0.5 M and 1 M. Each elution was performed for 5 minutes at room temperature. Eluted protein was kept in 50% glycerol at -70°C.<br>
Assay Method<br>
A source of HDAC (e.g., 2 µL of crude HeLa extract, 5 µL of HDAC1 or HDAC2; in elution buffer, as above) was incubated with 3 µL of radioactively labelled peptide along with appropriate dilutions of candidate compounds (1.5 µL) in a total volume of 150 µL of buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 10% glycerol). The reaction was carried out at 37°C for one hour, after which the reaction was stopped by adding 20 µL of 1 M HCI / 0.4 M sodium acetate. Then, 750 uL of ethyl acetate was added, the samples vortexed and, after centrifugation (14000 rpm, 5 min), 600 uL from the upper phase were transferred to a vial containing 3 mL of scintillation liquid (UltimaGold, Packard, Cat. No. 6013329). Radioactivity was measured using a Tri-Carb 2100TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (Packard).<br>
Percent activity (% activity) for each test compound was calculated as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein So denotes signal measured in the presence of enzyme and the compound being tested, S° denotes signal measured in the presence of enzyme but in the absence of the compound being tested, and B denotes the background signal measured in the absence of both enzyme and compound being tested. The IC50 corresponds to the concentration which achieves 50% activity.<br>
IC50 data for several compounds of the present invention, as determined using this assay, are also shown in Table 1, below.<br>
Measurement of cell viability in the presence of increasing concentration of test compound at different time points is used to assess both cytotoxicity and the effect of the compound on cell proliferation.<br>
Secondary Assay: Cell Proliferation<br>
Compounds with HDAC inhibition activity, as determined using the primary assay, were subsequently evaluated using secondary cell-based assays. The following cell lines were used:<br>
HeLa - Human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line (ATCC ref. No. CCL-2).<br>
K11 - HPV E7 transformed human keratinocyte line provided by Pidder Jansen-Duerr, Institut fur Biomedizinische Alternsforschung, Innsbruck, Austria.<br>
NHEK-Ad - Primary human adult keratinocyte line (Cambrex Corp., East Rutherford, NJ, USA).<br>
JURKAT- Human T-cell line (ATCC no. TIB-152).<br>
Assay Method<br>
Cells were cultured, exposed to candidate compounds, and incubated for a time, and the number of viable cells was then assessed using the Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1 from Boehringer Mannheim (Cat. No. 1 644 807), described below.<br>
Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 3-10x103 cells/well in 100 uL of culture medium. The following day, different concentrations of candidate compounds were added and the cells incubated at 37°C for 48 h. Subsequently, 10 uL/well of WST-1 reagent was added and the cells reincubated for 1 hour. After the incubation time, absorbance was measured.<br>
WST-1 is a tetrazolium salt which is cleaved to formazan dye by cellular enzymes. An expansion in the number of viable cells results in an increase in the overall activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases in the sample. This augmentation in the enzyme activity leads to an increase in the amount of formazan dye formed, which directly correlates to the number of metabolically active cells in the culture. The formazan dye produced is<br>
quantified by a scanning multiwell spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance of the dye solution at 450 nm wavelength (reference wavelength 690 nm).<br>
Percent activity (% activity) in reducing the number of viable cells was calculated for each test compound as:<br><br>
wherein So denotes signal measured in the presence of the compound being tested, S° denotes signal measured in the absence of the compound being tested, and B denotes the background signal measured in blank wells containing medium only. The IC50 corresponds to the concentration which achieves 50% activity. IC50 values were calculated using the software package Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) , setting top value at 100 and bottom value at 0.<br>
IC50 data for several compounds of the present invention, as determined using this assay, are also shown in Table 2, below.<br>
Measurement of cell viability in the presence of increasing concentration of test compound at different time points is used to assess both cytotoxicity and the effect of the compound on cell proliferation.<br>
Screening in Mice with Intraperitoneal P388 Tumour<br>
Female B6D2F1 hybrid mice weighing 19-23 grams were inoculated with the tumour cell line P388 (106 cells in 0.2 mL) intraperitoneally (IP).  Inoculation of tumour cells was performed on a Friday and treatment with compounds at a dose of 64 umol/kg/day started on Day 3 (Monday). The compounds were given as a single daily IP dose for five consecutive days. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO, at a concentration corresponding to 50 uL injection volume per treatment. Treatments were given at the same hour of the day (within one hour). Five mice in each group were treated with compounds, and with each series of experiments, control groups (not treated, and DMSO-treated) were included. Moribund mice were euthanised, and the day of death was recorded. Log-rank analysis of the survival data was performed using the statistical software SAS v8.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).<br>
