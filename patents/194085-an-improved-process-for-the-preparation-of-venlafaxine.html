				<td>The invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of<br>
venlafaxine i.e 1-[2(dimethylamino)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]cyclohexanol<br>
Venlafaxine i.e. 1-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]cyclohexanoll<br>
(I) and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as hydrochloride, are<br>
widely used for the treatment of depression.<br>
Venlafaxine is phenylethylamine derivative possessing a neuropharmacological<br>
profile, which differs from that of tricyclic antidepressant drugs. Venlafaxine is a<br>
departure from the earlier classes of antidepressants, offering equivalent or<br>
even better efficacy, while improving on many of undesirable side effects of the<br>
earlier classes. Venlafaxine inhibits the synaptosomal reuptake of both<br>
serotonin and noradrenaline and is also a weak inhibitor of dopamine reuptake<br>
(Stephen M. Hollyday and Paul Benfield; Drugs 49(2): 280-294; 1995).<br><br><br>
Background of the invention<br>
In literature, it is known that Venlafaxine i.e. 1-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl) ethyl]cyclohexanol (I) and its pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts can be prepared by -<br>
(a)	condensing 4-methoxy phenyl acetonitrile (II) with cyclohexanone (III) to<br>
prepare 1-[cyano(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]cyclohexanol (IV) as shown in<br>
Scheme -1<br><br>
(b)	reducing the 1-[cyano(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]cyclohexanol (IV) to<br>
prepare 1-[2-amino-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]cyclohexanol (V) as shown in<br>
Scheme-2.<br><br><br>
( c) The intermediate 1-[2-amino-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]cyclohexanol (V) as<br>
obtained by reduction of (IV) in Scheme 2 above is further converted to<br>
Venlafaxine (I).<br><br>
As disclosed in US 4535186, 1-[cyano(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]cyclohexanol<br>
(IV) is prepared by condensation of 4-methoxy phenyl acetonitrile (II) with<br>
cyclohexanone (III) by using n-butyl lithium. The draw back of this condensation <br>
process lies in the use of the n-butyl lithium, which is a highly flammable, <br>
pyrophoric, moisture sensitive and corrosive in nature. Also, the reaction is<br>
carried out at very low temperature i.e. -50°C to -70° C. Maintaing such low<br>
temperature is not convenient on commercial scale. Moreover, yield quoted for<br>
the condensation is below 50%.<br>
To avoid the use of n-butyl lithium and improve the yield for above<br>
condensation process, lithium diisopropylamide was used in WO 00/32556.<br>
Though, it improved the yield, but the reaction was carried out at low<br>
temperature of -65° C to -78° C. Maintaining such low temperature and<br>
handling the lithium diisopropylamide, which is corrosive in nature, are not<br>
convenient at commercial level. Also, the improved yield (80.7%) is still not<br>
satisfactory for commercial exploitation.<br>
In attempt to avoid low temperature, CN 1225356 used organic base like <br>
sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium hydride for the above<br>
condensation process. However, the handling of such hazardous bases are <br><br>
inconvenient. Also, there is a need to have the higher yields on commercial<br>
production scale.<br>
 In WO 02/18325, 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide used for the condensation<br>
of 4-methoxy phenyl acetonitrile (II) with cyciohexanone (III) in presence of<br>
phase transfer catalyst (PTC) like tetra butyl ammonium bromide. However,<br>
the use of such catalyst at commercial level makes the process costlier. Also,<br>
EP 1238967 disclose the condensation process by using aq. NaOH/KOH or<br>
powdered NaOH/KOH in presence or absence of PTC. However, much lower<br>
yield (78%) is obtained in absence of PTC. Also, the addition of powdered<br>
NaOH/KOH is exothermic, which increases the impurities.<br>
Thus there is a need for an improved process for condensing 4-methoxy<br>
phenyl acetonitrile (II) with cyciohexanone (III) to prepare 1-[cyano(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl)methyl]cyclohexanol (IV) that avoids any hazardous and toxic<br>
chemicals . Also, the reaction should be easy to operate and eco-friendly with<br>
higher yield.<br>
Further, 1-[cyano(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]cyclohexanol (IV) is reduced over<br>
rhodium on alumina, to prepare 1-[2-amino-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]<br>
cyclohexanol (V) according to Scheme -2 as disclosed in US 4535186.<br>
The main drawback of this reaction lies in the use of rhodium on alumina,<br>
which is hazardous in nature and is a costly chemical. Also, the reaction is<br>
carried out in parr apparatus under high pressure. Maintaining such high<br>
pressure makes the process critical and requires special equipment, which is<br>
not economical on commercial scale.<br>
To avoid the use of hazardous rhodium as reducing agent, Raney Nickel is<br>
used at 30°-60° C in parr apparatus as disclosed in US 6350912 B1. But<br>
maintaining such temperature under high pressure is difficult to handle and<br>
may be explosive. Yet in another attempt to solve the problem associated with<br>
the above reduction process, CN 1225356 used 40-50% BF3 - etherate<br>
solution as reducing agent. However, the use of BF3 as reducing agent, which<br><br><br>
is highly toxic in nature should better be avoided for commercial production of<br>
Venlafaxine.<br>
Also, to solve the problem associated with the use of parr apparatus in<br>
reduction process of 1-[cyano(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]cyclohexanol (IV), WO<br>
0032555 disclosed the use of sodium borohydride in presence of cobalt<br>
chloride as reducing agent.<br>
However, the main drawback of this process is in use of cobalt chloride, which<br>
is carcinogenic and toxic in nature. Also, the reported yield is low.<br>
Considering the potential use of the drug venlafaxine, there is a demand for a<br>
cost effective process for the synthesis of venlafaxine on commercial scale<br>
with higher yield.<br>
Also, process to be economical should dispense with special equipment like<br>
parr apparatus and without any costly catalyst. The process should be easy to<br>
operate on commercial scale. Also, the method needs to be using reagents<br>
which are non toxic, non- hazardous and easy-to-handle on a commercial<br>
scale, and thus the process needs to avoid reagents such as n- butyl lithium,<br>
lithium diisopropylamide, rhodium on alumina, BF3 and the like.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The first object of the invention is to provide an improved, cost effective and<br>
simple process, for production of Venlafaxine i.e. 1-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl)ethyl]cyclohexanol (I) or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
in higher yield.<br>
The second object of the invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
production of 1-[2-amino-1-(4-methoxyphenyl) ethyl]cyclohexanol (V) a key<br>
intermediate in the production of Venlafaxine.<br><br><br>
The third object of the invention to provide a cost effective process to prepare<br>
1-[cyano(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]cyclohexanol (IV) an early intermediate in<br>
production of Venfalxine by condensing 4-methoxy phenyl acetonitrile (II) with<br>
cyclohexanone (III) while avoiding very low temperature and use of<br>
hazardous chemical like n- butyl lithium, lithium diisopropyl amide as<br>
condensation reagent.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent with<br>
reference to the following description and claims.<br>

The invention discloses a process for the preparation of 1-[2-(dimethylamino)-<br>
1-(4-methoxyphenyl) ethyl] cyclohexanol (I), Venlafaxine and its<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br><br>
which comprises the steps of<br>
(a)condensing 4-methoxy phenyl acetonitrile (II) with cyclohexanone (III) using<br>
a base in an alcoholic solvent at a temperature range of -5° to 15° C to<br>
produce 1-[cyano(4-methoxyphenyl) methyl] cyclohexanol (IV)<br>
(b)reducing the 1-[cyano(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]cyclohexanol (IV) with<br>
NaBH4 in presence of a carboxylic acid in an aprotic solvent at a temperature<br>
range of 25° to 80°C to prepare 1-[2-amino-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)<br>
ethyl]cyclohexanol (V)<br>
(c)converting the 1-[2-amino-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]cyclohexanol (V) in to<br>
Venlafaxine (I) and its pharmaceutical salts by manner known per se. The<br>
invention is also for preparation of intermediate compound (v) above by novel<br>
process steps (a) and (b) as stated.<br></td>
