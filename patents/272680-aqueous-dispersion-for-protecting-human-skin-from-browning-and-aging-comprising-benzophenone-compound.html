				<td>Use of transmission dyes for protecting Inhuman skin from browning and ageing<br>
 <br>
Tile present invention relates to tile use of specific transmisson dyes for protecting human<br>
tear and skin against UV radiation and skin aging and preventing tanning and cosmetic or<br>
dermatological compositions comprising these dyes.<br>
It is known that certain photostable organic UV filters, for example bis- exhibit pronounced UV filtering properties in the UV-A range up to 380nm. In the range from 380nm to 420nm no satisfactory UV protection can be achieved.<br>
However, it is known that in the region &gt; 380nm the sun light significantly contributes to skin aging and enhanced skin cancer risk.<br>
Surprisingly it was found that specific UV absorbers which have absorption maxima above Son show no significant color when applied to the skin.<br>
Therefore the present invention relates to the use of an aqueous dispersion comprising<br>
(a)	a micronized sparingly soluble organic compound which has a UV-Vis spectrum with a maximum from 380 to 420 nm; and<br>
(b)	an anionic dispersing agent<br>
for protecting the human skin from browning and skin aging.<br>
Preferably the organic micronized UV absorbers are selected from benzophenone derivatives.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
02   is a number from 1 to 3;<br>
when Di is 3,<br>
C2-C2oalkenyl is for example allyl, lethally, isopropenyl, 2-butenyl, 3-butenyl, isobutene, n-penta-2,4-dieny!, 3-methyl-but-2-enyl, n-oct-2-enyl, n-dodec-2-enyl, iso-dodecenyl, n-dodec-2-enyI or n-octadec-4-enyi.<br>
 <br>
substituted with one or more radicals they are preferably substituted with one, two, three or four, preferably with one or two equal or different radicals.<br>
If Ri and R2 are heterocyclic radicals, these comprise one, two, three or four equal or different ring hetero atoms. Special preference is given to heterocycles which contain one, two or three, especially one or two, identical or different hetero atoms. The heterocycles may be mono- or poly-cyclic, for example mono-, bi- or tri-cyclic. They are preferably mono- or bi-cyclic, especially monocyclic. The rings preferably contain 5, 6 or 7 ring members. Examples of monocyclic and bicyclic heterocyclic systems from which radicals occurring in the compounds of formula (1) or (2) may be derived are, for example.<br>
Most preferably the benzophenone derivative used for the present invention corresponds to formula<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
The compounds of formula (1) may be prepared according to known methods as described for example in EP-1,046,391 or WO 04/052837.<br>
Sparingly soluble organic compounds which are used in the present invention are present in the micronized state. They may be prepared by any known process suitable for the preparation of microparticles, for example: wet-milling, wet-kneading, spray-drying from a suitable solvent, by expansion according to the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions) of supercritical fluids (e.g. CO2, by reprecipitation from suitable solvents, including supercritical fluids (GASR process = Gas Anti-Solvent Recrystallisation / PGA process = Precipitation with Compressed Anti-solvents).<br>
As milling apparatus for the preparation of the sparingly soluble micronised organic compounds there may be used, for example, a jet mill, ball mill, vibratory mill or hammer mill, preferably a high-speed mixing mill. Even more preferable mills are modern ball mills; manufacturers of these types of mill are, for example, Netzsch (LMZ mill), Drais (DCP-Viscoflow or Cosmo), Buhler AG (centrifugal mills) or Bachhofer.<br>
Examples of kneading apparatus for the preparation of the micronised organic UV absorbers are typical sigma-blade batch kneaders but also serial batch kneaders (IKA-Werke) or continuous kneaders (Continua from Werner und Pfleiderer).<br>
 <br>
The grinding of the sparingly soluble organic compounds used in the present inventions preferably carried out with a grinding aid.<br>
The dispersing agent (b) is used as a low molecular weight grinding aid for all the above micronisation processes.<br>
Useful anionic, non-ionic or amphitricha surfactants are disclosed below in the sections entitled "specific dispersing agents".<br>
Preferred useful grinding aids for an aqueous dispersion are anionic surfactants with a HLB (Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance) value higher than 8, more preferably higher than 10.<br>
Any conventionally usable anionic, non-ionic or amphoteric surfactants can be used as dispersing agents (component (b)). Such surfactant systems may comprise for example: carboxylic acids and their salts: alkaline soap of sodium, potassium and ammonium, metallic soap of calcium or magnesium, organic basis soap such as Laurie, myristic, palmitic, sorbitan mono- and di-esters of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids having from 6 to 22 carbon atoms and ethylene oxide addition products.
