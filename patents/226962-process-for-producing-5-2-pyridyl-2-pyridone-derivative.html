(III)	is added to a solution of 2-sulfonylpyridine derivative<br>

The reaction can be carried out in the presence of a solvent. While the solvent is not particularly limited as long as it does not adversely affect the reaction, for example, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, octane and the like; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, mesitylene, chlorobenzene and the like; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tert-butylmethyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,4-dioxane, diglyme and the like; esters such as ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate and the like; nitriles such as acetonitrile, benzonitrile and the like; diraethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like can be mentioned.

derivative (V).<br>
The 5-(2'-pyridyl)-2-pyridone derivative {VI) thus produced can be isolated or purified by the methods generally used for the isolation or purification of organic compounds. For example, the reaction mixture is washed with methyl-tert-butyl ether and the like, alkalified with sodium hydroxide and the like and then washed again with methyl-tert-butyl ether and the like.

In addition, 2-sulfonylpyridine derivative (IV) can be easily produced by,<br>
for example, a method comprising reacting ct,p-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with sulfonyl cyanides (JP-A-11-269147).<br>
Examples The present invention is explained in detail by referring to Examples, which are not to be construed as limitative. Example 1 Synthesis of 5-bromo-2-methoxypyridine<br>
Ethyl acetate (325 kg), sodium acetate (58 kg, 707 mol) and 2-methoxypyridine (68.7 kg, 630 mol) were mixed in a reactor vessel (inner volume 1000 L) . To this solution was added dropwise bromine (122.3 kg, 765 mol) over 6.5 hr while keeping the inside temperature from exceeding 10Â°C. After the dropwise addition, the inside temperature was raised to 20Â°C and the mixture was stirred for 5 hr. The ratio of reaction<br><br>
progress at this time point was 73%. Thereafter, the inside<br>
temperature was raised to 50Â°C and the reaction was continued more for 5 hr. The ratio of reaction progress at this time point was 98%. The reaction mixture was cooled and water (70 kg) was added to the reaction mixture. While keeping the inside temperature from exceeding 5Â°C, the solution obtained by dissolving sodium hydroxide (46.1 kg) and sodium sulfite (17 kg) in water (200 kg) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stood still to allow partitioning. After confirming that the pH of the aqueous layer was not less than 8 and peroxide was absent, the organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (40 kg), and the extract and the above-mentioned organic layers were combined. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to give crude 5-bromo-2-methoxypyridine (gross: 121.8 kg, net: 110.7 kg, yield 93%). The crude product was purified by distillation under reduced pressure to give 5-bromo-2-methoxypyridine (101.8 kg, yield 86%) having the following analytical data at a purity of not less than 99%.<br>

After the completion of the dropwise addition, the mixture was stirred for 1 hr and a sample was taken to confirm the disappearance of 5-bromo-2-methoxypyridine. To the obtained reaction mixture was added dropwise a solution obtained by dissolving 2-<br><br>
benzenesulfonylpyricline {45.7 kg, 209 raol) in tetrahydrofuran<br>
{133 kg) at a temperature range of -71CC to -75Â°C over 6.5 hr. After the completion of the dropwise addition, the mixture was<br>
stirred at -71CC for 3 hr and isopropanol (32 kg) was added to stop the reaction.<br>
The obtained reaction mixture was warmed to 0Â°C and the reaction mixture was transferred to an extraction vessel containing water (216 kg) while keeping the inside temperature of the extraction vessel from exceeding 20Â°C. After the completion of the transfer, the mixture was stirred for 30 min, stood still and the organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted twice with ethyl acetate (62 kg + 86 kg) and the extracts and the above-mentioned organic layer were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a crude product (gross: 52.8 kg). The crude product was quantified and found to contain 36.8 kg (yield 95%, based on 2-benzenesulfonylpyridine) of 6-methoxy-3,2'-bipyridine having the following analytical data.

Crude 6-metho&gt;cy-3,2'-bipyridine (55.0 kg, net: 42.6 kg) obtained in Example 2, 35% hydrochloric acid (65 kg) and water (110 kg) were charged in a reactor vessel (inner volume 500 L) and the mixture was heated under reflux for 4 hr. The reaction mixture was cooled and the aqueous layer was washed with<br>
methyl-tert-butyl ether (116 kgx4). A solution obtained by dissolving sodium hydroxide (35 kg) in water (102 kg) was added while maintaining the inside temperature at 25-35Â°C to adjust its pH to 12, and the aqueous layer was washed again with methyl-tert-butyl ether (116 kgx2). 35% Hydrochloric acid (40 kg) was added while maintaining the inside temperature at<br><br>
25-40Â°C to adjust its pH to 7. This mixture was transferred to a reactor vessel {inner volume 1000 L), n-butanol (175 kg) was added and sodium chloride (70 kg) was further added. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with n-butanol (175 kg). The extract and the organic layer were combined and concentrated until n-butanol remaining in the reactor vessel became 69 kg. Ethyl acetate (84 kg) was added to the concentrate, and the mixture was dissolved by heating to 80Â°C and cooled to 0Â°C to allow recrystallization to give crude 5-(2'-pyridyl)-2-pyridone (32.1 kg, net: 29.1 kg).<br>
This was added to water (224 kg), dissolved by heating to 60Â°C and cooled to 0Â°C. The obtained slurry was filtered, washed with water (45 kg) and dried to give 5-(2'-pyridyl)-2-pyridone (23.56 kg, yield 60%).<br>
