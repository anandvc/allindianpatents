OIL-IN-WATER	TYPE	EMULSION<br>
COMPOSITION;<br>
SHISEIDO	COMPANY,	LTD.,	A<br>
CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF JAPAN WHOSE ADDRESS IS 5-5, GINZA 7-CHOME, CHUO-KU, TOKYO, 1048010, JAPAN<br><br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED. 1<br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an oil-in-water emulsified composition; this composition is particularly suitable for use in cleansing creams or massage creams.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Among oil-in-water emulsified compositions used as external preparation compositions such as cosmetics, there are products that contain fatty acid soaps and aim primarily or secondarily for removing dirt such as cleansing creams and massage creams; the main focus in the development of such products is to maintain the oil-in-water emulsion system from the time of production to just before use, and destroy the emulsion with the hand pressure at the time of use to elute out the oil ingredients in the inner phase to manifest the cleansing effect and massage effect.<br>
2<br><br>
In these oil-in~water emulsified compositions, the rich sensation derived from the richness of the composition is an element that improves the value of the product. Conventionally, means such as increasing the ratio of the oil ingredients in the inner phase to the total amount and increasing the ratio of the semisolid oil ingredients are employed to give this richness.<br>
Patent Document 1: JP 2004-168736 A<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION TECHNICAL PROBLEM<br>
Based on the situation as described above, the object of the present invention is to provide an oil-in-water emulsified composition primarily or secondarily aiming at removing dirt that exhibits no stickiness, superior stability, and ri chness.<br>
Patent Document 1, which is a prior art technology related to the present invention, discloses a cleansing agent containing 50% or less of water, 1-60% of a polyhydroxy compound, and 1-<br>
3<br><br>
95% of an oil ingredient; said cleansing agent is a transparent, semi-transparent, or emulsoid cleansing agent in which the oil ingredient is gelated stably without adding a gelling agent. However, the cleansing agent of said prior art document is not an emulsified type so it is difficult to give a rich sensation. Furthermore, said prior art document does not use polyethylene glycol, which is an essential ingredient in the present invention.<br>
TECHNICAL SOLUTION<br>
The inventor discovered that the problem described above could be solved by adding polyethylene glycol having a specified range of molecular weight to an oil-in-water emulsified composition primarily or secondarily aiming at removing dirt and maintaining other conditions in specified ranges, and thus completed the present invention.<br>
That is, the present invention provides an oil-in-water emulsified composition comprising (1) fatty acid soap, the following ingredients (2)-(5)<br>
4<br><br>
and (6) water (hereafter also referred to as "this emulsified composition").<br>
(2)	polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of 2000-25000 in the amount of 0.3-4.0 wt% of the composition,<br>
(3)	one, two, or more of nonionic surfactants having a HLB of 10-17 in the amount of 0.1-5.0 wt% of the composition,<br>
(4)	one, two, or more of nonionic surfactants having a HLB of 2-10 in the amount of 0.1-5.0 wt% of the composition, and<br>
(5)	an oil ingredient comprising a solid or semisolid oil ingredient in the amount of 40-70 wt% of the composition.<br>
Also, the present invention provides the oil-in-water emulsified composition wherein the solid or semisolid oil ingredient content in said emulsified composition is 5.0-50 wt% of the total amount of the oil ingredients.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides the oil-in-water emulsified composition wherein said emulsified composition is a cleansing cream<br>
5<br><br>
or massage cream.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS<br>
The present invention provides an oil-in-water emulsified composition primarily or secondarily aiming at removing dirt that exhibits no stickiness, superior stability, and richness.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
"Essential ingredients of the emulsified<br>
composition"<br>
(1) Fatty acid soap<br>
This emulsified composition can contain one, two or more types of fatty acid soaps regardless of the type as long as they are fatty acid soaps that can be used for external preparations; the fatty acid portion of said fatty acid soap usually has 12-22 carbon atoms, preferably 16-20. In the manufacturing process of this emulsified composition, said fatty acid soap is prepared by separately adding the fatty acid that is to be the fatty acid group of said fatty acid soap and the alkali agent (saponifying agent) to the system so<br>
6<br><br>
they coexist: said fatty acid is saponified by said alkali agent to generate the fatty acid soap. Examples of said alkali agent include potassium hydroxide, triethanolamine, diethanolamine, basic amino acids, borax, ammonia, taurate, and n-methy 1 taurate.<br>
Examples of the fatty acid soap that is added to this emulsified composition include sodium laurate, sodium myristate, sodium palmitate, sodium stearate, sodium oleate, potassium laurate, potassium myristate, potassium palmitate, potassium stearate, potassium oleate, monoethanolamine laurate, monoethanolamine myristate, monoethanolamine palmitate, and monoethanolamine stearate.<br>
The blend ratio of the fatty acid soap thus added to this emulsified composition is not limited in particular and can be chosen according to the specific form of this emulsified composition and other ingredients; generally, the fatty acid soap has 12-22 .carbon atoms and the blend ratio is 0.3-3.0 wt% of the composition, and preferably the fatty acid soap has 16-20 carbon<br>
7<br><br>
atoms and the blend ratio is approximately 0.5-2.0 wt% of the composition.<br>
(2) Polyethylene glycol<br>
This emulsified composition is required to contain polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of 2000-25000 (hereafter also referred to as "the specific high molecular weight polyethylene glycol"). If said average molecular weight is less than 2000, then it becomes hard for the composition to give a rich sensation; if it is over 25000, then emulsificat ion becomes difficult and the formulation tends to be unstable.<br>
One, two or more types of the specific high molecular weight polyethylene glycol are added to this emulsified composition; the blend ratio is 0.3-4.0 wt%, preferably 0.5-3.0 wt%, of the composition. If the blend ratio is less than 0.3 wt% of the composition, then it becomes hard for the composition to give a rich sensation; if it is over 4.0 wt%, then there is a strong tendency for the emulsification stability to decrease.<br>
(3) Hydrophilic nonionic surfactant<br>
8<br><br>
One, two or more types of nonionic surfactants having a HLB of 10-17 are added to this emulsified composition; the blend ratio is 0.1-5.0 wt%, preferably 0.5-3.0 wt%, of the composition. If the blend ratio is outside of this range, the combination balance with the lipophilic nonionic surfactant, described later, becomes poor and there is a stronger tendency for the emulsificat ion stability to decrease.<br>
Selection of said hydrophilic nonionic surfactant is not limited in particular; examples include POE (10-40) glyceryl monostearate, hexaglyceryl monolaurate, decaglyceryl monolaurate, decaglyceryl monomyristate, decaglyceryl monostearate, decaglyceryl monooleate, POE (40-60) castor oil, POE (30-100) hydrogenated castor oil, PEG (40-60) glyceryl triisostearate, PEG (10-60) glyceryl isostearate, PGE (40-60) glyceryl trioleate, PEG (40-60) hydrogenated castor oil isostearate, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil triisostearate, PEG (40-60) hydrogenated castor oil laurate, POE (7-20) cetyl ether, and POE (10-50) ol ey 1 ether.<br>
9<br><br>
(4) Lipophilic nonionic surfactant<br>
One, two or more types of nonionic surfactants having a HLB of 2-10 are added to this emulsified composition; the blend ratio is 0.1-5.0 wt%, preferably 0.5-3.0 wt%, of the composition. If the blend ratio is outside of this range, the combination balance with the aforementioned hydrophilic nonionic surfactant becomes poor and there is a stronger tendency for the emulsificat ion stability to decrease.<br>
Selection of said lipophilic nonionic surfactant is not limited in particular; examples include POE (3) oleyl ether, POE (3) lauryl ether, diglyceryl monostearate, decaglyceryl pentastearate, hexaglyceryl tristearate, POE (2) nonylphenyl ether, glyceryl palmitate, glyceryl isostearate, propylene glycol stearate, PEG (5-7) hydrogenated castor oil, PEG (5-20) glyceryl triisostearate, PEG (3-8) glyceryl isostearate, PEG (3-15) glyceryl tristearate, PEG (5-10) glyceryl trioleate, PEG (10-40) hydrogenated castor oil triisostearate, PEG (5-30) hydrogenated castor oil isostearate, POE sorbitol stearate, POE sorbitol isostearate, and POE sorbitol oleate.<br>
10<br><br>
r (5) Oil phase ingredients (sometimes simply referred to as "the oil phase" in this specification)<br>
This emulsified composition has the oil phase ingredients in the amount of 40-70 wt% of the composition. Here, the oil phase ingredients stand for the totality of the ingredients added as the oil phase when manufacturing the oil-in-water emulsified composition; specifically they are mainly oil ingredients (liquid oil ingredients, semisolid oil ingredients, and solid oil ingredients), surfactants (liquid surfactants, semisolid surfactants, and solid surfactants), and fatty acids. In addition to the ingredients mentioned above, oil soluble preservatives, ultraviolet absorbents, oil soluble drugs, antioxidants, and perfumes may be added. If the oil phase is less than 40 wt% of the composition, then the stability is satisfactory, but the makeup does not come off well and the composition tends to resist spreading; if it is more than 70 wt%, then the stability is poor and stickiness is felt during use.<br>
11<br><br>
For this emulsified composition, the aforementioned oil phase ingredients are required to contain solid or semisolid oil ingredients.<br>
A "solid or semisolid oil ingredient" refers to an oil ingredient whose melting point is room temperature (about 20~25°C) or higher; specific examples include waxes such as candelilla wax, beeswax, cotton wax, carnauba wax, bayberry wax, tree wax, montan wax, bran wax, lanolin, reduced lanolin, hard lanolin, kapok wax, sugar cane wax, jojoba wax, and shellac wax; higher alcohols that are solid at room temperature such as cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol; and solid oil ingredients such as cacao oil, hydrogenated castor oil, Japanese core oil, and shea butter.<br>
The blend ratio of the solid or semisolid oil ingredients in the oil phase of this emulsified composition is 5.0-50 wt%, preferably 10-35 wt%, of the total amount of the oil phase. If the ratio of the solid or semisolid oil ingredients is less than 5.0 wt% of the total amount of the oil phase, then the richness of the cream tends to decrease; if it is over 50 wt%,<br>
12<br><br>
then the stability decreases and stickiness is felt dur ing use.<br>
As described above, in addition to the aforementioned solid or semisolid oil ingredients, it is possible to add a liquid oil ingredient that is liquid at room temperature (as described above) as a constituent ingredient of the oil phase. Selection of the liquid oil ingredient is not limited in particular'» examples include liquid oils and fats such as linseed oil, tsubaki oil, macadamia nut oil, corn oil, olive oil, avocado oil, sasanqua oil, castor oil, safflower oil, apricot kernel oil, cinnamon oil, jojoba oil, grape oil, almond oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, sunflower oil, wheat germ oil, rice germ oil, rice bran oil, cotton seed oil, soybean oil, peanut oil, tea seed oil, evening primrose oil, egg yolk oil, liver oil, triglycerin, glyceryl trioctanoate, and glyceryl triisopalmitate ; octanoic esters such as cetyl octanoate! isooctanoic esters such as glyceryl tri-2-ethylhexaenoate and pentaerythritol tetra-2-ethylhexanoate; lauric esters such as hexyl laurate! myristic esters such as isopropyl myristate and octyldodecyl myristate; palmitic<br>
13<br><br>
esters such as octyl palmitate; isostearic esters such as isocetyl stearate; isostearic esters such as isopropyl isostearate; isopalmitic esters such as octyl isopalmitate; oleic esters such as isodecyl oleateJ adipic diesters such as diisopropyl adipate; sebacic diesters such as diethyl sabacate; and ester oils such as diisostearyl malatel and liquid hydrocarbon oils such as liquid paraffin and squalane.<br>
Furthermore, for the silicone oil, it is possible to use chain silicones such as dimethylpolysiloxane, methylphenylpolysiloxane, and methyhydrogenpolysiloxane; cyclic silicones such as octame thy 1 eye 1otetrasi1oxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, and dodecamethyleye 1ohexasiloxane; silicone resins capable of forming a three dimensional network structure such as amino-modified silicone oil, polyether-modified silicone oil, carboxy-modified silicone oil, alky1-modified silicone oil, ammonium salt-modified silicone oil, fluorine-modified silicone oil, and trim.ethylsi.loxy si 1 icic acid; high polymer me thylpolysi1oxane such as high polymer dimethylpolysiloxane, high polymer<br>
14<br><br>
methylphenylpolysi1oxane, and high polymer methylvinylpolysi1oxane; and high polymer amino-modified methylpolysiloxane. Also, for the silicone surfactant, it is possible to add dimethicone polyol and such.<br>
(6) Water<br>
n-<br>
ratio<br>
wt%.<br>
This emulsified composition is an oil~i water type emulsified composition and it is essential for it to contain water. The blend is the balance of the ingredients other than water; it is generally in the range of 10-50<br>
