				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  a  process  for  preparation  of Moxifloxacin hydrochloride, using a novel intermediate namely (4aS-Cis) -(l-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-4-0X0-1,4-dihydro-3-quinolinecarboxylicacid-0^0^)bis(acyloxy-0)borate.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride namely (4aS-Cis)-l-cyclopropyl-7-(2, 8-diazabicyclo [4.3.0] non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride has the formula<br><br>
Moxifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone broad spectrum antibacterial particularly against Gram-positive bacteria significantly better than those of Sparfloxacin and Ciprofloxacin that was disclosed in EP No 350,733 and EP No 550,903. Moxifloxacin has activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, including Streptococcus pneumonia. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, particularly against the respiratory disease-causing pathogens like Mycoplasma pneumonia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Chlamydia pneumoniae and the activity shown to be unaffected by B-lactamases.<br>
US Patent No 5,157,117 discloses (l-cyclopropyl-6,7-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid-0^C) bis (acyloxy-0) borate and a process for its preparation by reacting the ethyl-1-cyclopropyl-6,7-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l, 4-dihydro-3-quinoline<br><br>
carboxylate with Boric acid and acetic anhydride in presence of zinc chloride and conversion to Gatifloxacin hydrochloride.<br>
Other hydrates known are the anhydrous and monohydrate. US Patent No. 5,849,752 discloses the monohydrate of Moxifloxacin hydrochloride and its preparation by treating the anhydrous crystalline form with ethanol/ water mixtures.<br>
The prior art disclosed in European Patent No"s EP 350,733, EP 550,903 and EP 657,448 discloses the preparation of Moxifloxacin hydrochloride involving the condensation of l-cyclopropyl-6,7-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid or its esters with (S,S) 2,8-Diaza bicyclo[4.3.0]nonane in presence of a base followed by conversion to hydrochloride at higher temperatures leading to the desired Moxifloxacin along with its positional isomer namely (4aS-Cis)-l-cyclopropyl-6-{2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-7-fluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid as a major impurity. As the impurity and the Moxifloxacin are positional isomers they are difficult to separate. Purification of Moxifloxacin to free it of this isomer results in lower yields thereby increasing the product cost. Similarly methods described in the prior art involve the preparation of Moxifloxacin and then its conversion to its hydrochloride thereby incorporating an additional step in the manufacturing process also leading to lowering of yields.<br>
It is a long felt of the industry to provide high yielding and cost effective processes for the preparation of Moxifloxacin hydrochloride<br>
Sijinmary of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a high yielding and cost effective process for the preparation of Moxifloxacin hydrochloride.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Moxifloxacin hydrochloride without the additional step of isolation of Moxifloxacin.<br>
Another object of the invention is to explore other hydrates of Moxifloxacin hydrochloride<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide the fingerprinting of Moxifloxacin hydrochloride pseudohydrate prepared by the invented process.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the conversion of Moxifloxacin hydrochloride pseudohydrate to Moxifloxacin hydrochloride monohydrate<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation  of  novel  intermediate   (4aS-Cis)-l-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l, 4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid-0^, 0^)bis (acyloxy-0)borate   and its use in the preparation for Moxifloxacin hydrochloride .<br>
