This invention relates to benzoxazine derivatives, and associated compositions, methods for use as therapeutic agents, and methods of preparation thereof.<br>
The actions of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) as a major modulatory neurotransmitter in the brain, are mediated through a number of receptor families termed 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5- HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. Based on a high level of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA in the brain, it has been stated that the 5-HT6 receptor may play a role in the pathology and treatment of central nerve system disorders. In particular, 5-HT6 selective ligands have been identified as potentially useful in the treatment of certain CNS disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, anxiety, depression, manic depression, psychoses, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, Alzheimer's disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, panic attacks, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. Such compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, B.L. Roth et al., /. Pharmacol Exp. Ther., 1994, 268, pages 1403-14120, D. R. Sibley et al, MoL Pharmacol, 1993, 43, 320-327, AJ. Sleight et al, Neurotransmission, 1995, 11,1-5, and A. J.

"Solvates" means solvent additions forms that contain either stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed . molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water the solvate formed is a hydrate, when the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an akoholate. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with one of the substances in which the water retains its molecular state as H^O, such combination being able to form one or more hydrate.<br>
"Subject" means mammals and non-mammals. Mammals means any member of the mammalia class including, but not limited to, humans; non-human primates such as chimpanzees and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such as cattle, horses, sheep, goats, and swine; domestic animals such as rabbits, dogs, and cats; laboratory animals including rodents, such as rats, mice, and guinea pigs; and the like. Examples of<br><br>
non-mammals include, but are not limited to, birds, and the like. The term "subject" does not denote a particular age or sex.<br>
"Therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of a compound that, when administered to a subject for treating a disease state, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease state. The "therapeutically effective amount" will vary depending on the compound, disease state being treated, the severity or the disease treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the route and form of administration, the judgement of the attending medical or veterinary practitioner, and other factors.<br>
The terms "those defined above" and "those defined herein" when referring to a variable incorporates by reference the broad definition of the variable as well as preferred, more preferred and most preferred definitions, if any.<br>
"Treating" or "treatment" of a disease state includes:<br>
(i)	preventing the disease state, i.e. causing the clinical symptoms of the<br>
disease state not to develop in a subject that maybe exposed to or predisposed to the disease state, but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease state.<br>
(ii)	inhibiting the disease state, i.e., arresting the development of the disease<br>
state or its clinical symptoms, or<br>
(iii)	relieving the disease state , Le., causing temporary or permanent<br>
regression of the disease state or its clinical symptoms.<br>
The terms "treating", "contacting" and "reacting" when referring to a chemical reaction means adding or mixing two or more reagents under appropriate conditions to produce the indicated and/or the desired product. It should be appreciated that the reaction which produces the indicated and/or the desired product may not necessarily result directly from the combination of two reagents which were initially added, i.e., there may be one or more intermediates which are produced in the mixture which ultimately leads to the formation of the indicated and/or the desired product.<br>

The coupling reaction between Compound of Formulas II and III is typically conducted in an inert organic solvent, such as toluene or xylene, in the presence of a coupling catalyst. Suitable coupling catalysts include a mixture of a transition metal catalyst, such as a palladium source (e.g., tris(dibenzylideneacetone)palladium(0) and palladium acetate), and a suitable phosphine ligand, such as 2,2'-<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino)-l,r-binaphthyl, and tri-o-tolylphosphine. In some cases, a base is also added to the coupling reaction.

The coupling reaction between Compound of Formulas II and III generally requires elevated temperature, typically in the range of from about 50 °C to about 150 °C. Preferably, the coupling reaction temperature range is from about 80 °C to about 110 °C. More preferably, about 95 °C However, it should be appreciated that the coupling reaction temperature is not limited to these ranges. The coupling reaction temperature can vary significantly depending on the nature of the substrate as well as other factors, such as the coupling catalyst, concentrations of each components, etc.<br>

When desired, formulations can be prepared with enteric coatings adapted for sustained or controlled release administration of the active ingredient. For example, the compounds of the present invention can be formulated in transdermal or subcutaneous drug delivery devices. These delivery systems are advantageous when sustained release of the compound is necessary and when patient compliance with a treatment regimen is crucial. Compounds in transdermal delivery systems are frequently attached to an skin-adhesive solid support. The compound of interest can also be combined with a penetration enhancer, e.g., Azone (l-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one). Sustained release delivery systems are inserted subcutaneously into the subdermal layer by surgery or injection. The subdermal implants encapsulate the compound in a lipid soluble membrane, e.g., silicone rubber, or a biodegradable polymer, e.g., polylactic acid.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>

Example 5<br>
This example illustrates in vitro radioligand binding studies of Compound of Formula 1.<br>
The binding activity of compounds of this invention in vitro was determined as follows. Duplicate determinations of ligand affinity are made by competing for binding of [ H]LSD in cell membranes derived from HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant human 5-HT6 receptor(Boess et al, Neuropharmacology, vol. 36 No. 4/5, pp 713-720, 1997; Monsma et al., Molecular Pharmacology, vol. 43, pp 320-327,1993).<br>
All determinations were made in assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgS04, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM ascorbic acid, pH 7.4 at 37 °C, in a 250 microliter reaction volume. Assay tubes containing [3H] LSD (5 nM), competing ligand, and membrane were incubated in a shaking water bath for 60 min. at 37 °C, filtered onto Packard GF-B plates (pre-soaked with 0.3% PEI) using a Packard 96 well cell harvester and washed 3 times in ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCl. Bound [*H] LSD was determined as radioactive counts per minute using Packard TopCount.<br>
Displacement of [3HJLSD from the binding sites was quantified by fitting concentration-binding data to a 4-parameter logistic equation:<br><br>
where Hill is the Hill slope, [ligand] is the concentration of competing radioligand and 1C50 is the concentration of radioligand producing half-maximal specific binding of radioligand. The specific binding window is the difference between the Bmax and the basal parameters.<br>
Using the procedures of Example 5, compounds of Formula I were tested and found to be selective 5-HT6 antagonists.<br><br><br>
Example 6<br>
The cognition-enhancing properties of compounds of the invention maybe in a model of animal cognition: the object recognition task model. 4-month-old male Wistar rats (Charles River, The Netherlands) were used. Compounds were prepared daily and dissolved in physiological saline and tested at three doses. Administration was always given i.p. (injection volume 1 ml/kg) 60 minutes before Tl. Scopolamine hydrobromide was injected 30 minutes after compound injection. Two equal testing groups were made of 24 rats and were tested by two experimenters. The testing order of doses was determined randomly. The experiments were performed using a double blind protocol. All rats were treated once with each dose condition. The object recognition test was performed as described by Ennaceur, A., Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats. 1: Behavioral data. Behav. Brain Res. 31, 47-59.<br><br><br>
