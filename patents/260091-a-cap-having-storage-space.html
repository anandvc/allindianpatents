BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described more in detail hereinafter in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numerals will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
FIGS. 1 through 3 shows a cap according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A cap 1 is screw-coupled to a container.<br>
The cap 1 includes a cap main body 10 having a storage portion 12<br>
defining a storage space 11 and an outer cap 20 coupled to the cap main body 10.<br>
The cap 1 includes a seal plate 30 and an operation member 40 that is designed to break the seal plate according to the operation of the outer cap 20. The operational member 40 is located inside the storage portion 12.<br>
The seal plate 30 is preferably formed of synthetic resin or aluminum, being attached on a lower end of the storage portion 12.<br>
The cap main body 10 is provided with a folding portion 21 with a folding line 13. A spouting portion 24 is formed on an outer surface of the folding portion 21 and coupled to the outer cap 20. A spouting member<br>
22	is inserted in the spouting portion 24.<br>
The spouting member 22 is provided with an operational projection<br>
23	extending downward to break the seal plate 30.   A hook step 27 is<br>
formed on the spouting portion 24 to prevent the spouting member 22<br>
from removing.   A spouting hole 28 is provided to exhaust a mixture.<br>
The spouting member 22 is provided with a spouting passage 25 and an air introduction portion 26 in a longitudinal direction.<br>
The operational member 40 is provided with fixing portion 41 fixed inside the storage portion 12 and connected to the fixing portion 41 by a<br><br>
connection portion 42.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, in a state when different material is stored in the storage portion 12, the seal plate 30 is attached and the cap main body 10 coupled to the outer cap 20 is fixed on the container.<br>
In this state, the spouting portion 24 and the outer cap 20 are disposed on a horizontal plan as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
At this point, as shown in FIG. 1, when the spouting portion 24 and the outer cap 20 are pivoted to a vertical position, the folding portion 21 is moved outward by the folding line 13 and the operational projection 23 formed on the spouting portion 22 pivots to allow the operational member 40 to pivot and break the seal plate 30.<br>
Therefore, the different material stored in the storage portion 12 is dropt into the container to mix with main material contained in the container.<br>
In this state, the outer cap 20 is separated and the mixture can be spouted through the spouting passage 25 through the spouting hole 28 of the spouting member 22.<br>
Since the spouting member 22 is vertically movable, the user can be more easily drink the mixture. Furthermore, since the air introduction<br>
portion 26 is formed on the spouting member 22, the mixture can be effectively discharged.<br>
FIG, 4 shows a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A cap main body 10 is provided with a storage space 11. A seal plate 30 is attached on a lower end of the storage space 11. A pouch container 100 is attached on the cap main body.<br>
FIGS. 5 and 6 shows a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, a seal step is formed in a space 51.<br>
A folding portion is integrally formed in the space 51 with a folding line 53. A spouting portion 55 is formed in the folding portion and an outer cap 200 is coupled to the spouting portion 55.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, a protecting member 70 is formed on an opened top of the cap main body 10, being provided with a concave portion 71.<br>
FIGS. 8 through 10 shows a fourth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A cap 1 includes a cap main body 10 and a spouting portion 90 formed on the cap main body.<br>
A cutting plate 95 with a pulling ring 94 is formed on the spouting portion 92.<br>
FIGS. 11  through 13 are views of a cap according to a fifth<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
This embodiment is similar to the first embodiment.<br>
FIG. 14 is a sixth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A withdrawal wing 148 is formed on the spouting portion 140. In this embodiment, there is no need of an outer cap for opening the spouting portion 140.<br>
FIGS. 15 through 16 shows a seventh embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the container is formed of a carton bag.<br>
An air introduction portion 157 is formed on the spouting portion 150.<br>
FIGS. 17 through 18 shows an eighth embodiment similar to the first embodiment.<br>
FIGS. 19 through 20 shows a ninth embodiment of the present invention similar to the eighth embodiment.<br>
FIGS. 21 through 22 show a tenth embodiment of the present invention. A barrier 211 is formed on the cap main body.<br>
A storage member 220 stores different material and is designed to be pivoted to exhaust the different material. After exhausting the different<br>
material, it functions as a spouting member for exhausting the mixture.<br>
FIGS. 23 through 25 shows an eleventh embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A spouting portion is formed on a storage portion 232. An operational member 240 is coupled to the storage space 233.<br>
FIGS. 26 through 27 show a twelfth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
An outer cap is pivotally coupled to a cap main body. The outer cap 20 is provided with a storage space 280. A stopper 282 is formed on the outer cap, which contacts a coupling portion.<br>
The outer cap is rotated by a predetermined angle by the stopper 282 to communicate with a seal groove 271 of the storage space 280.<br>
When the outer cap 20 is pivoted to a horizontal plale, the seal hole 271 is closed again.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As described above, the present invention is directed to a pouch container with a spout assembly, in which the spout assembly can be hygienically protected. The present invention is further directed to a method for mass production of such a pouch container.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
