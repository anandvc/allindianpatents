The reaction temperature may be from room temperature to 100°C but conveniently about 70°C<br><br>
Compounds of formula XI are either commercially available or may be prepared by known methods.<br>
Compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are useful as pharmaceuticals. In particular, they exhibit inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pi3 kinase) enzymes, especially the gamma isoform (pllOy), which are responsible for generating phosphorylated signalling products. The inhibitory properties of compounds of formula I may be demonstrated in the following test procedures:<br>
Baculovirus expressing different fragments of human PI3Ky fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) have been previously described by Stoyanova, S., Bulgarelli-Leva, G., Kirsch, C, Hanck, T., Klinger, R., Wetzker, R., Wymann, M.P. (1997) Lipid- and protein kinase activities of G protein-coupled PI 3-kinase g: structure-activity analysis and interactions with wortmannin, Biocbem. /., 324:489. Residues 38-1102 of human PI3Ky are subcloned into the BamHl and EcoRl sites of the transfer vector pAcG2T (Pharmingen) to create a GST-PI3Ky lacking the first 37 residues of PI3Ky. To express the recombinant protein, Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda 9) insect cells are routinely maintained at densities between 3 X 105 and 3 X 106 cells/ml in serum containing TNMFH medium (Sigma). Sf9 cells, at a density of 2 X 106 are infected with human GST-PI3KyA34 baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection (rn.o.i.) of 1 for 72 hours. The infected cells are harvested by centrifugation at 1400 g for 4 minutes at 4° C and the cell pellets are frozen at -80° C. Both Sf9 and Sf21 cells work equally well. Sf9 cells (1X10*) are resuspended in 100 ml cold (4° C) lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH<br><br>
7.5,1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaF5 2 mM DTT and protease inhibitors. Cells are incubated on ice for 30 minutes then centrifuged at 15000g for 20 minutes at 4° C. Purification of the supernatant sample is carried out at 4e C by affinity chromatography using SEPHAROSE™ agarose gel beads coupled to glutathione (from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A cell lysate/GST resin ratio of 50:1 is used. The GST resin is firstly pre-rinsed to remove ethanol preservative and then equilibrated with lysis buffer. Cell lysate (supernatant) is added (usually as 50 ml lysate to 1 ml GST resin in 50 ml tubes) and gently rotated on a mixer at 4° C for 2-3 hours. The unbound flow through sample is collected by centrifugation at lOOOg for 5 minutes at 4° C using a DENLEY™ centrifuge. The 1 ml GST resin containing bound material is transferred to a 15 ml FALCON™ centrifuge tube for subsequent washing and elution steps. Firstly a series of 3 cycles of washings (mixing by gentle inversion) is performed with 15 ml ice cold wash Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,1% Triton X-100, 2 mM DTT) interspersed with centrifugation at lOOOg for 5 minutes at 4° C. A final single wash step is performed with 15 ml ice cold wash Buffer B (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2 mM DTT) and then centrifuged at lOOOg for 5 minutes at 4° C. The washed GST resin is finally eluted with 4 cycles of 1 ml ice cold elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM reduced glutathione, 2 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaF, 50% ethylene glycol and protease inhibitors) interspersed with centrifugation at lOOOg for 5 minutes at 4° C. Samples are aliquoted and stored at -20° C.<br>
An in vitro kinase assay was established that measures the transfer of the terminal phosphate of adenosine triphosphate to phosphatidylinositol. The kinase reaction is performed in a white 96 well microtitre plate as a Scintillation Proximity Assay. Each well contains 10 pi test compound in 5% dimethylsulphoxide and 20 \A assay mix (40 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM ethyleneglycol-aminoethyl-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 15 [ig/ml phosphatidylinositol, 12.5 |iM adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 25 mM MgCb, 0.1 pCi [33P]ATP). The reaction is started by the addition of 20 yd of enzyme mix (40 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA containing recombinant GST-pllOy). The plate is incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes and the reaction terminated by the adding 150 |al of WGA-bead stop solution (40 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA, 1.3 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 2.6 \JM ATP and 0.5 mg of Wheat Germ Agglutinin-SPA beads (Amersham Biosciences) to each well. The plate is sealed, incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes, centrifuged at 1200 rpm and then counted for 1 minute using a scintillation counter. Total activity is determined by<br><br>
adding 10 \i\ of 5% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and non-specific activity is determined by adding 10 jol 50 mM EDTA in place of the test compound.<br>
Compounds of the Examples hereinbelow have IC50 values below 0.60 |iM in the aforementioned assay.<br>
Having regard to their inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase enzymes, compounds of formula I in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, hereinafter alternately referred to as "agents of the invention", are useful in the treatment of conditions which are mediated by the activation of the Pi3 kinase enzymes, particularly inflammatory or allergic conditions. Treatment in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic.<br>
Accordingly, agents of the invention are useful in the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases, resulting, for example, in reduction of tissue damage, airways inflammation, bronchial hyperreactivity, remodelling or disease progression. Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma, mild asthma, moderate asthma, severe asthma, bronchitic asthma, exercise-induced asthma, occupational asthma and asthma induced following bacterial infection. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as "wheezy infants", an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics. (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome".)<br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g. of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e. therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti-inflammatory (e.g. corticosteroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to "morning dipping". "Morning dipping" is a recognised asthmatic<br><br>
syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant form any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>
Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include acute lung injury (ALI), adult/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary, airways or lung disease (COPD, GOAD or COLD), including chronic bronchitis or dyspnea associated therewith, emphysema, as well as exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity consequent to other drug therapy, in particular other inhaled drug therapy. The invention is also applicable to the treatment of bronchitis of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., acute, arachidic, catarrhal, croupus, chronic or phthinoid bronchitis. Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by airways obstruction, whether chronic or acute, and occasioned by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis, including, for example, aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and byssinosis.<br>
Having regard to their anti-inflammatory activity, in particular in relation to inhibition of eosinophil activation, agents of the invention are also useful in the treatment of eosinophil related disorders, e.g. eosinophilia, in particular eosinophil related disorders of the airways (e.g. involving morbid eosinophilic infiltration of pulmonary tissues) including hypereosinophilia as it effects the airways and/or lungs as well as, for example, eosinophil-related disorders of the airways consequential or concomitant to Loffler's syndrome, eosinophilic pneumonia, parasitic (in particular metazoan) infestation (including tropical eosinophilia), bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, polyarteritis nodosa (including Churg-Strauss syndrome), eosinophilic granuloma and eosinophil-related disorders affecting the airways occasioned by drug-reaction.<br>
Agents of the invention are also useful in the treatment of inflammatory or allergic conditions of the skin, for example psoriasis, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, erythema muitiforma, dermatitis herpetiformis, scleroderma, vitiligo, hypersensitivity angiitis, urticaria, bullous pemphigoid, lupus erythematosus,<br><br>
pemphisus, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and other inflammatory or allergic conditions of the skin.<br>
Agents of the invention may also be used for the treatment of other diseases or conditions, in particular diseases or conditions having an inflammatory component, for example, treatment of diseases and conditions of the eye such as conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and vernal conjunctivitis, diseases affecting the nose including allergic rhinitis, and inflammatory disease in which autoimmune reactions are implicated or having an autoimmune component or aetiology, including autoimmune haematological disorders (e.g. haemolytic anaemia, aplastic anaemia, pure red cell anaemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenia), systemic lupus erythematosus, polychondritis, sclerodoma, Wegener granulamatosis, dermatomyositis, chronic active hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, Steven-Johnson syndrome, idiopathic sprue, autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), endocrine opthalmopathy, Grave's disease, sarcoidosis, alveolitis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, multiple sclerosis, primary billiary cirrhosis, uveitis (anterior and posterior), keratoconjunctivitis sicca and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, interstitial lung fibrosis, psoriatic arthritis and glomerulonephritis (with and without nephrotic syndrome, e.g. including idiopathic nephrotic syndrome or minal change nephropathy).<br>
Other diseases or conditions which may be treated with agents of the invention include septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, proliferative diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, allograft rejection following transplantation, stroke, obesity, restenosis, diabetes, e.g. diabetes mellitus type I (juvenile diabetes) and diabetes mellitus type II, diarrheal diseases, ischemia/reperfusion injuries, retinopathy, such as diabetic retinopathy or hyperbaric oxygen-induced retinopathy, and conditions characterised by elevated intraocular pressure or secretion of ocular aqueous humor, such as glaucoma.<br>
The effectiveness of an agent of the invention in inhibiting inflammatory conditions, for example in inflammatory airways diseases, may be demonstrated in an animal model, e.g. a mouse or rat model, of airways inflammation or other inflammatory conditions, for example as described by Szarka et al,/. Immunol. Methods (1997) 202:49-57; Renzi et al, Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. (1993) 148:932-939; Tsuyuki et al., /. Clin. Invest. (1995) 96:2924-2931; and Cemadas et al (1999) Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 20:1-8.<br><br>
