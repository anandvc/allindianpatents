				<td>SYSTEM AND PROCESS FOR INJECTING CATALYST AND/OR ADDITIVES<br>
INTO A FLUTDIZED CATALYTIC CRACKING UNIT<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
[0001] This is a continuation in part of U.S. application no. 10/806,563, filed<br>
March 23, 2004, the contents of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to equipment used in fluidized catalytic<br>
cracking (FCC) operations and, more particularly, to systems and processes for injecting<br>
catalyst and/or additives into equipment units employed to conduct FCC operations.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0003] FCC units commonly include a circulating inventory of bulk catalyst. The<br>
bulk catalyst is typically used to perform a primary function, such as producing naptha<br>
from petroleum feedstock, the naptha being further processed into gasoline. Additives,<br>
which are often in the same fluidizable and particulated form as the catalyst, are often<br>
introduced into the circulating inventory of bulk catalyst to perform a secondary function<br>
such as reducing certain types of emissions, e.g., SOx or NOx, produced by the FCC unit.<br>
These emissions are produced in the catalyst regenerator of the FCC unit where coke<br>
deposits from the cracked petroleum are burne. off and the regenerated catalyst returned<br>
to the circulating catalyst inventory, These additives are usually introduced into the<br>
regenerator using an injection device commonly referred to as a "loader." Loaders are also<br>
used to add catalyst to the bulk inventory as additional catalyst becomes necessary due to<br>
factors such as attrition and deactivation.<br>
[0004] Loaders used for catalyst and/or additive injection typically comprise a<br>
transfer pot, and a storage hopper or silo located above or proximate the transfer pot. The<br>
catalyst and/or additive is usually transferred to the storage hopper from a storage bin<br>
using a suitable technique such as vacuum transfer. During operation of the loader, a<br>
predetermined amount of catalyst and/or additive can be metered to the transfer pot from<br>
the storage hopper. The transfer pot can subsequently be pressurized, and the catalyst<br>
and/or additive can be injected into the regenerator in response to the pressure within the<br>
transfer pot. This process is usually repeated on a cyclical basis.<br>
[0005] The amount of catalyst metered to the transfer pot and injected during each<br>
cycle is usually small in comparison to the overall volume of the storage hopper. In other<br>
words, a relatively large volume of catalyst and/or additive is typically stored in the hopper<br>
so that relatively small doses of the catalyst and/or additive can be metered to the transfer<br>
pot during each cycle. A typical storage hopper is relatively large due to the need to<br>
accommodate a large amount of additive or catalyst therein. For example, a typical<br>
storage hopper can have a diameter of five feet or more, and height of fifteen feet or more.<br>
[0006] The relatively large size of conventional storage hoppers can limit the<br>
number of suitable locations in which the loader can be installed. This characteristic can<br>
be particularly disadvantageous at a refinery, where space can be and often is limited. The<br>
need for a relatively large area to accommodate the loader (and in particular the storage<br>
hopper) can thus necessitate placing the loader in a less than optimal location.<br>
[0007] Moreover, the loader can only be used to inject one type of catalyst and/or<br>
additive at a time, due to the need for a dedicated storage hopper for each type of catalyst<br>
and/or additive. In other words, the transfer pot can only inject the catalyst and/or additive<br>
stored in its associated hopper, until the catalyst and/or additive is replaced with another<br>
type of catalyst and/or additive. Hence, loading different types catalyst and/or additives on<br>
simultaneous or near-simultaneous (back to back) basis can only be accomplished using<br>
multiple loaders. Each additional loader requires additional outlays of time, labor, and<br>
money to purchase, install, operate, and maintain. Moreover, each loader consumes<br>
potentially valuable space within the refinery.<br>
[0008] The storage hopper may be pressurized in some applications to facilitate<br>
transfer of the catalyst and/or additive to the transfer pot. The pressurized air within the<br>
hopper can adversely affect the measurements that provide and indication of how much<br>
catalyst and/or additive has been added to the transfer pot. Also, the catalyst and/or<br>
additive may be exposed to pressurized air from the refinery (commonly referred to as<br>
"plant air") while it is being transferred to, or stored in the hopper. Plant air often contains<br>
moisture or other contaminates that can adversely affect the catalyst anoVor additive.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0009] A preferred embodiment of a system for injecting catalyst and/or additives<br>
into a fluidized catalytic cracking unit comprises a dust collector in fluid communication<br>
with a storage bin holding one of the catalyst and/or additives, and a vacuum producer in<br>
fluid communication with the dust collector so that the vacuum producer generates a<br>
vacuum within the dust collector that draws the one of the catalyst and/or additives into the<br>
dust collector.<br>
[0010] The system also comprises a transfer pot for receiving the one of the<br>
catalyst and/or additives from the dust collector. The transfer pot is in fluid<br>
communication with the fluidized catalytic cracking unit and a source of pressurized air so<br>
that the one of the catalyst and/or additives is transferred to the fluidized catalytic cracking<br>
unit in response to a pressure differential "between the transfer pot and the fluidized<br>
catalytic cracking unit.<br>
[0011] A preferred embodiment of a system for loading catalyst and/or additives<br>
into a fluidized catalytic cracking unit comprises a bin for storing at least one of the<br>
catalyst and/or additives, and a loading unit in fluid communication with the storage bin<br>
and the fluidized catalytic cracking unit on a selective basis. The loading unit is capable of<br>
being evacuated so that a resulting vacuum within the loading unit draws the at least one<br>
of the catalyst and/or additives from the bin, and the loading unit is capable of being<br>
pressurized so that the least one of the catalyst and/or additives is transferred from the<br>
loading unit to the fluidized catalytic cracking unit.<br>
[0012] Another preferred embodiment of a system for loading catalyst and/or<br>
additives into a fluidized catalytic cracking unit comprises a first bin for storing a first of<br>
the catalyst and/or additives, a second bin for storing a second of the catalyst and/or<br>
additives, and a loading unit in fluid communication with the first and second bins and the<br>
fluidized catalytic cracking unit. The system also comprises a first valve for isolating the<br>
first bin from the loading unit on a selecti ve basis, a second valve for isolating the second<br>
bin from the loading unit on a selective basis, and a third valve for isolating the second bin<br>
from the fluidized catalytic cracking unit on a selective basis.<br>
[0013] A preferred embodiment of a system for introducing catalyst and/or<br>
additives into a fluidized catalytic cracking unit comprises a dust collecting means in fluid<br>
communication with a storage bin holding one of the catalyst and/or additives, and a<br>
vacuum producing means in fluid communication with the dust collecting means so that<br>
the vacuum producing means draws the one of the catalyst and/or additives into the dust<br>
collecting means. The system also comprises a means for receiving the one of the catalyst<br>
and/or additives from the dust collecting means and injecting the one of the catalyst and/or<br>
additives into the fluidized catalytic crackcing unit.<br>
[0014] A preferred process for introducing catalyst and/or additives into a fluidized<br>
catalytic cracking unit comprises generating a vacuum within a loading unit, drawing one<br>
of the catalyst and/or additives from a stoxage bin and into the loading unit in response to<br>
the vacuum, pressurizing the loading unit, and injecting the one of the catalyst and/or<br>
additives into the fluidized catalytic craclcing unit in response to the pressurization of the<br>
loading unit.<br>
[0015] A preferred process for loading catalyst and/or additives into a fluidized<br>
catalytic cracking unit comprises storing at least one of the catalyst and/or additives at a<br>
first location, vacuuming the at least one of the catalyst and/or additives into a loading unit<br>
positioned at a second location, and injecting the at least one of a catalyst and/or additives<br>
into the fluidized catalytic cracking unit from the loading unit.<br>
[0016] A preferred embodiment of a system for introducing one or more<br>
particulate substances into a fluid stream comprises a dust collecting means in fluid<br>
communication with at least one storage bin holding the one or more particulate<br>
substances. The system also comprises a vacuum producing means in fluid<br>
communication with the dust collecting means so that the one or more particulate<br>
substances is drawn into the dust collecting means from the at least one storage bin by a<br>
vacuum. The system further comprises a means for receiving the one or more particulate<br>
substances from the dust collecting means and injecting the one or more particulate<br>
substances into the fluid stream.<br>
[0017] A preferred conveying process comprises generating a vacuum within a<br>
dust collector of a loading unit, and drawing a particulate material from a storage bin and<br>
into the dust collector in response to the vacuum so that the particulate material enters a<br>
transfer pot of the loading unit adjoining the dust collector. The process also comprises<br>
pressurizing the transfer pot, and discharging the particulate material from the transfer pot<br>
in response to the pressurization of the transfer pot.<br>

Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
[0029] A preferred embodiment of a system 10 far injecting catalyst and/or<br>
additives into an FCC unit is depicted in Figures 1-6. The loading system 10 forms part of<br>
an overall system 11 for storing and loading catlalyst and/or additives. The system <br>
includes the loading system 10, and one or more storage bins 37.<br>
[0030] The loading system 10 comprises a loading unit 14 having a dust collector<br>
16 and an adjoining transfer pot 18. The loading system LO, as discussed in detail below,<br>
produces a vacuum that draws catalyst and/or additive from the storage bins 37 and into<br>
the dust collector 16. The catalyst and/or additive falls to the bottom of the dust collector<br>
16 and into the transfer pot 18. The transfer pot 18 is subsequently pressurized, and the<br>
catalyst and/or additive is injected into a regenerator of the FCC unit in response to the<br>
pressure within the transfer pot 18.<br>
[0031] The loading unit 14 can be housed within a. cabinet 19 (see Figures 2-4).<br>
(The cabinet 19 is shown in the figures with its side panels removed, for clarity.) The<br>
loading unit 14 is preferably supported by a plurality of legs 20 affixed to the transfer pot<br>
 [0032] Cabinet 19 is optional and can be configured to accommodate the particular<br>
configuration and size of the injection system. Preferably side panels to the cabinet are<br>
removable (and/or designed as doors which are easily opened) and substantially full length<br>
and width of the enclosure to give an operator or repair peirson full access to the system.<br>
Alternatively, closable portals can be placed in walls that are more substantially affixed to<br>
the system's base, with the portals used for access to relati vely small components of the<br>
system.<br>
[0033] The cabinet serves to protect the system from damaging elements in the<br>
environment, e.g., plant dust, rain, direct sunlight, as well as reduces dusting created by the<br>
movement of catalyst as it is drawn in and then injected by the system. The cabinet also<br>
can retain any catalyst particulate that may spill or leak from broken or damaged hoses that<br>
transport catalyst into" and throughout the system, as well as retain any fugitive emissions<br>
from the contained equipment.<br>
[0034] The cabinet can also be designed to be large enough to provide shelter for<br>
an operator or repair person. The cabinet also "unitizes" the system, thereby making it<br>
easier to transport and install the system. Indeed, the cabinet could be designed to serve as<br>
a shipping container in addition to serving as a protective enclosure.<br>
[0035] The dust collector 16 comprises a sidewall 17. The sidewall 17 should be<br>
of a suitable strength and thickness to withstand the presence of a vacuum within the dust<br>
collector 16.<br>
[0036] The cross section and overall shape of the dust collector 16 can vary. The<br>
dust collector 16 depicted in the figures has a substantially cylindrical upper portion 16a,<br>
and a substantially conical lower portion 16b that adjoins the upper portion 16a. An<br>
opening 23 is formed in the center of the lower portion 16b (see Figure 1). A screen 24 is<br>
positioned across the lower portion 16b. In other embodiments, the cross section of the<br>
upper portion 16a and the lower portion 16b can be square or rectangular, and the overall<br>
shape can be in the form of a square or rectangular column. (Directional terms such as<br>
"upper," "lower," etc. are used herein with reference to the component orientations<br>
depicted in Figure 1. These terms are used for exemplary purposes only, and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the appended claims.)<br>
[0037] The dust collector 16 also includes a cover 25. The cover 25 mates with an<br>
upper edge of the sidewall 17. A gasket is positioned between the cover 25 and the<br>
sidewall 17 to form a substantially airtight seal therebetween. The sidewall 17 and the<br>
cover 25 define an internal volume 26 within the dust collector 16 (see Figure 1).<br>
[0038] The dust collector 16 also comprises a suitable filter 32 (see Figure 1). The<br>
filter 32 can be, for example, a Mactiflo model E376094 filter.<br>
[0039] The filter 32 is mounted within the upper portion 16a of the dust collector<br>
16. The sidewall preferably includes a hatch 33 to provide access to the interior of the<br>
upper portion 16a (and the filter 32) (see Figures 1 and 4). The hatch 33 is preferably<br>
secured the sidewall 17 of the dust collector 16 using brackets 34 that permit the hatch 33<br>
to be removed with a minimal expenditure of time and effort, thereby facilitating<br>
replacement of the filter 32 with a minimum of time and effort. Alternative embodiments<br>
of the loading system 10 can be equipped with more than one of the filters 32.<br>
[0040] The system 10 also comprises suitable vacuum producer 30 (see Figures 1<br>
and 2). For example, the vacuum producer can be an Empire two-inch Vacutran S150<br>
vacuum producer.<br>
 [0041] . The vacuum producer 30 is mounted within the cabinet 19 (see Figure 2)..<br>
The vacuum producer 30 is preferably mounted separately from the loading unit 14. The<br>
vacuum producer 30 is in fluid communication with the filter 32 by way of a hose 35.<br>
[0042] The vacuum producer 30 is in fluid communication with a suitable source<br>
of pressurized air (not shown). (The source of pressurized air can be the plant air typically<br>
available at refineries.) The flow of pressurized air into the vacuum producer 30 can be<br>
regulated by a suitable valve 36 having an actuator 36a (see Figure 1).<br>
[0043] The vacuum producer 30 can operate in a manner commonly known to<br>
those skilled in the art of vacuum-chamber design. In particular, opening the valve 36<br>
permits the pressurized air to flow through the vacuum producer 30. The flow of<br>
pressurized air through the vacuum producer 30 causes the vacuum producer 30 to draw<br>
air from the internal volume 26 of the dust collector 16, thereby generating a vacuum<br>
within the internal volume 26. (The vacuum producer 30 draws the air through the filter<br>
32, thereby causing the dust collector 16 to collect the dust generated by the flow of<br>
catalyst and/or additive into the dust collector 16.) The respective directions of various<br>
airflows within the loading system 10 are denoted by arrows 39 in Figure 1.<br>
[0044] The loading system 10 draws catalyst and/or additive from storage bins in<br>
response to the vacuum within the internal volume 26. In particular, the dust collector <br>
is in fluid communication with storage bins 37 (see Figure 1). The storage bins 37 hold<br>
catalyst and/or additives to be injected into the FCC unit. The storage bins 37 can be, for<br>
example, the shipping containers used to transport the catalyst and/or additives to the<br>
refinery at which the loading system 10 is installed.<br>
[0045] Each storage bin 37 is coupled to the dust collector 16 by a corresponding<br>
hose (or pipe) 38. A suitable valve 42 having an actuator 42a is located between each<br>
hose 38 and the dust collector 16. Each valve 42 isolates its associated storage bin 37<br>
from the dust collector 16 on a selective basis. The valves 42 are installed on the upper<br>
portion 16a of the dust collector 16, and are in fluid communication with the internal<br>
volume 26 by way of corresponding openings formed in the upper portion 16a of the dust<br>
collector 16. (The hoses 38 and valves 42 thus form part of the system 11 for storing and<br>
loading catalyst and/or additives).<br>
[0046] The hoses 38 can be coupled to the upper portion 16a by way of a common<br>
manifold 74 in alternative embodiments, as shown in Figure 8.<br>
[0047] - The hoses 38 are preferably equipped with fittings that permit the hoses 38<br>
to be readily removed from the dust collector 16 (or the manifold 74) and the storage bins<br>
 [0048] Opening one of the valves 42 permits catalyst and/or additive to be drawn.<br>
from the associated storage bin 37 by way of the associated hose 38, in response to the ?<br>
vacuum within the internal volume 26. The catalyst and/or additive is thus drawn directly<br>
from the storage bin 37 and into the loading system 10, without a need to load the catalyst<br>
and/or additive into a storage hopper.<br>
[0049] The loading system 10 is depicted as being equipped with three sets of the<br>
valves 42 and hoses 38, for exemplary purposes only. Alternative embodiments can be<br>
equipped with more or less than three valves 42 and three hoses 38, and can draw catalyst<br>
and/or additive from more or less than three of the storage bins 37.<br>
[0050] One or more (2,3, 4, etc.) storage bins 37 can be positioned at a location<br>
remote from the loading system 10. For example, the storage bins 37 can be located up to<br>
twenty feet from the loading system 10. (The maximum distance between the loading<br>
system 10 and the storage bins 37 is application dependent, and can vary with factors such<br>
as the capacity of the vacuum producer 30, the diameter of the hoses 38, etc. A particular<br>
value for this parameter is specified for exemplary purposes only.)<br>
[0051] The dust collector 16 preferably includes three pipe guides 40. Each pipe<br>
guide 40 is in fluid communication with an associated one of the hoses 38.<br>
[0052] The catalyst and/or additive drawn into the internal volume 26 by way of<br>
one of the pipe guides 40. The pipe guides 40 discharge the catalyst or additive proximate<br>
into the internal volume 26, proximate the screen 24.<br>
[0053] Alternative configurations of manifold 74 include an internal manifold,<br>
such as the manifold 100 depicted in Figure 9. In such an embodiment, one or more<br>
individual hoses 38 can be routed through portals in the upper portion 16a, with the portals<br>
preferably sealed via gaskets or the like. One or more pipe guides 102 can be secured to<br>
the sidewalls of the upper portion 16a by a suitable means such as welds, flanges, brackets.,<br>
fasteners, etc., so that the pipe guides 102 extend into the upper portion 16a.<br>
[0054] Each of the hoses 38 are then coupled by way of the common manifold 100<br>
that is located inside the upper portion 16a. The manifold 100 can include valves, such as<br>
the valves 42, for placing the manifold 100 (and the dust collector 16) in fluid<br>
communication with the associated hose 38 and storage bin 37 on a selective basis. A<br>
single discharge pipe guide 104 (as opposed to the multiple pipe guides 40 illustrated in<br>
FIG. 1) can descend from the manifold 100 in the direction of the bottom portion of 16b.<br>
The end of the discharge pipe guide 104 preferably is located approximately six inches<br>
above the opening 23 formed in the lower portion 16b of the dust collector 16. (The<br>
optimal distance between the end of the discharge pipe guide 104 and the opening 23 can<br>
vary by application; a specific value for this distance is presented for exemplary purposes<br>
only.) This configuration of hoses 38, manifold 100, and single discharge pipe guide 104<br>
create a "spider" arrangement of hoses such that the single discharge pipe guide 104 can be<br>
positioned in the center of the upper portion 16a. Centering the manifold 100 and the<br>
associated discharge pipe guide 104 insures that catalyst and/or additive is deposited at the<br>
bottom of dust collector 16. This configuration helps reduce catalyst and/or additive<br>
striking the sides of the upper portion 16a, and thereby reduces any potential build up of<br>
catalyst and/or additive on those walls. This configuration also potentially reduces catalyst<br>
and/or additive attrition that could occur as the catalyst and/or additive particulate strikes<br>
the sidewalls.<br>
[0055] Another arrangement for discharging the catalyst and/or additive into the<br>
dust collector 16 is depicted in Figure 10. In this embodiment, one or more of the<br>
individual hoses 38 can be routed through portals in the upper portion 16a, with the portals<br>
preferably sealed via gaskets or the like. One or more pipe guides 110 can be secured to<br>
the sidewall of the upper portion 16a by a suitable means such as welds, flanges, brackets,<br>
fasteners, etc., so that each pipe guide 110 receives catalyst and/or additive from a<br>
respective hose 38. A valve, such as the valve 42, can be mounted on each pipe guide <br>
to place the pipe guide 110 (and the dust collector 16) in fluid communication with the<br>
associated hose 38 and storage bin 37 on a selective basis. Each valve 42 can be mounted<br>
on the sidewall of the upper portion 16a by a suitable means such as flanges.<br>
[0056] The pipe guides 110 each extend inward from the sidewall of the upper<br>
portion 16a, so that the respective ends of the pipe guides 110 are located proximate the<br>
centerline of the dust collector 16. The ends of the pipe guides 110 can be secured to each<br>
other by a suitable means such as welding, fasteners, brackets, etc. Each pipe guide <br>
thus discharges catalyst and/or additive proximate the centerline of the dust collector 16.<br>
The pipe guides 110 preferably extend downward, at an angle of approximately seventy<br>
degrees in relation to the horizontal direction. (The optimal orientation of the pipe guides<br>
110 can vary by application; a specific orientation is presented for exemplary purposes<br>
only.) The ends of the pipe guides 100 preferably are located approximately six inches<br>
above the opening 23 formed in the lower portion 16b of the dust collector 16. (The<br>
optimal distance between the ends of the pipe guides 110 and the opening 23 can vary by<br>
application; a specific value for this distance is presented for exemplary puiposes only.)<br>
This configuration helps reduce catalyst and/or additive striking the sides of the upper<br>
portion 16a, and thereby reduces any potential build up of catalyst and/or additive on those<br>
walls. This configuration also potentially reduces catalyst and/or additive attrition that<br>
could occur as the catalyst and/or additive particulate strikes the sidewalls.<br>
[0057] It should be noted that the depiction of the system 11 in Figure 1 is<br>
schematic in nature, and the relative positions of the various hoses, piping, etc. of the<br>
system 11 can be different than those depicted in Figure 1. For example, the openings<br>
formed in the upper portion 16a of the dust collector 16 to accommodate the hoses 38 can<br>
be positioned around the circumference of the upper portion 16a, in lieu of the vertical<br>
arrangement depicted in Figure 1. In other embodiments, multiple hoses can be positioned<br>
on two or more sides of upper portion 16a.<br>
[0058] The catalyst or additive drops toward the bottom of the dust collector 16&gt;,<br>
i.e., toward the lower portion 16b, after being discharged from the pipe guides 40 (or trxe<br>
discharge pipe guide 104 or pipe guides 110) due to gravity. The catalyst and/or additive<br>
passes through the screen 24 as it drops (see Figure 1). The mesh of the screen 24 is<br>
preferably chosen to block the passage of relatively large clumps or catalyst and/or<br>
additive (or foreign objects), while permitting relatively fine granules of catalyst and/oir<br>
additive to flow freely therethrough. The substantially conical shape of the lower portion<br>
16b directs the catalyst and/or additive toward the opening 23 in the lower portion 16b.<br>
[0059] The loading system 10 includes the valve 43 for covering and sealing the<br>
opening 23 on a selective basis. The valve 43 can be, for example, a plug valve<br>
comprising a seat 44 and plug 45. The seat 44 is secured to the lower portion 16b, around<br>
the periphery of the opening 23. The plug 45 is movable between an upper and a lowerposition<br>
(the plug 45 is depicted in its lower position in Figure 1).<br>
[0060] The valve 43 is actuated by pressurized air. The pressurized air is directed<br>
to the valve 43 by way of piping 46 that extends through the transfer pot 18. The flow of<br>
pressurized air into the piping 46 can be initiated and interrupted on a selective basis by a<br>
valve 48 in fluid communication with the piping 46. The valve 48a includes an actuate* T<br>
48a.<br>
[0061] The pressurized air impinges upon the plug 45 after exiting of the piping<br>
46. More particularly, the pressurized air is directed to the interior of the plug 45, and<br>
urges the plug 45 into its closed position against the seat 44. The contact between the plug<br>
45 and the seat 44 substantially seals the opening 23.<br>
[0062] The plug 45 drops from its closed to its open position when the pressurized<br>
air is interrupted by closing the valve 48. The resulting gap between the plug 45 and the<br>
seat 44 permits catalyst and/or additive reaching the bottom of the lower portion 16b to<br>
pass through the opening 23 and into the transfer pot 18 (see Figure 1).<br>
 [0063] The loading system 10 preferably includes a volume chamber and moisture<br>
trap 49 in fluid communication with the piping 46 (see Figures 1 and 2). The volume<br>
chamber and moisture trap 49 removes moisture from the pressurized air directed to the<br>
valve 43.<br>
[0064] The transfer pot 18 comprises a sidewall 51. The si dew all 51 should be of<br>
a suitable strength and thickness to withstand pressurization of the transfer pot 18.<br>
[0065] The cross section and overall shape of the transfer pot 18 can vary. The<br>
transfer pot 18 depicted in the figures has a substantially cylindrical upper portion 18a, and<br>
a substantially conical lower portion ISb that adjoins the upper portion 18a. The upper<br>
portion 18a and the lower portion ISb of the transfer pot 18, and the lower portion 16b of<br>
the dust collector 16 define an internal volume 50 within the transfer pot 18 (see Figure 1).<br>
(The lower portion 16b and the valve 43 thus form a boundary between the internal<br>
volume 26 of the dust collector 16 and the internal volume 50 of the transfer pot 18.)<br>
[0066] An opening 53 is formed in the center of the lower portion 18a of the<br>
transfer pot 18. The transfer pot 18 is coupled to the regenerator of the FCC unit by piping<br>
54. The piping 54 is in fluid communication with the opening 53. Catalyst and/or additive<br>
enters the piping 54 by way of the opening 53 and subsequently flows to the regenerator,<br>
as discussed below.<br>
[0067] A valve 55 having an actuator 5a is installed in piping 54. The valve 55<br>
permits the transfer pot 18 to be isolated from the regenerator on a selective basis. A<br>
suitable transfer pot 18 can be obtained, for example, by adapting a Clemtex, Inc. model<br>
2452 six-cubic foot sandblasting pot, or a model 1648 two-cubic-foot sandblasting pot to<br>
mate with the dust collector 16. (The sandblasting pot can be mated with the dust collector<br>
16 by securing the lower portion 16b of the dust collector 16 to the upper periphery of the<br>
sandblasting pot by a suitable means such as welding.)<br>
[0068] The loading unit 14 is supported by a plurality of load cells 56 (see Figures<br>
1 and 4). The load cells 56, as discussed below, provide a measure of the weight of the<br>
loading unit 14 in both an unloaded and loaded condition, i.e., with and without catalyst<br>
and/or additive therein. The load cells 56 are preferably mounted between a base 19a of<br>
the cabinet 19, and a plate 57 fixedly coupled to the legs 20 of the transfer pot 18.<br>
[0069] Each load cell can be restrained from substantial horizontal movement by a<br>
corresponding restraint 61 (the restraints 61 are shown only in Figure 5, for clarity.) Each<br>
restraint 51 is pivotally coupled to the base 19a of the cabinet 19.<br>
[0070] The loading system 10 can include a plurality of jack assemblies 62 (the<br>
jack assemblies 62 are shown only in Figure 5, for clarity.) Each jack assembly 62<br>
comprises a threaded shaft 62a fixedly coupled to the base 19a of the cabinet 19. Two<br>
nuts 62b are threadably coupled to each shaft 62a. The nuts 62b are located above and<br>
below the plate 57. The lower nuts 62b can be raised so that the lower nuts 62b support<br>
the plate 57 (and the portion of the loading system 10 positioned on the plate 57). The<br>
upper nuts 62b can be lowered to lock the plate 57 in position, i.e., the plate 57 can be<br>
sandwiched between the upper and lower nuts 62b.<br>
[0071] The jack assemblies 62 can thus substantially isolate the load cells 57 from<br>
the weight of the loading system 10. This feature can be used, for example, to protect the<br>
load cells 57 from being damaged by impact loads during shipping of the loading system<br>
10.<br>
[0072] External connections to the loading unit 14 are preferably configured so as<br>
to introduce a negligible tare into the load cell readings. For example, the piping 54<br>
includes a flexible sections 46a that substantially decouples the transfer pot 18 from the<br>
portion of the piping 54 connected to the regenerator, thereby minimizing any tare<br>
introduced into the load cell readings (see Figure 1). The piping 46 likewise includes a<br>
flexible section 46a that substantially decouples the transfer pot 18 from the portion of the<br>
piping 46 connected to the plant-air equipment. Moreover, the hoses 35, 38 preferably<br>
have sufficient flexibility so that any tare introduced thereby is negligible.<br>
[0073] The internal volume 26 of the dust collector 16 and the internal volume 50<br>
of the transfer pot 18 are in fluid communication on a selective basis by way of piping 58.<br>
A valve 59 having an actuator 59a is located in the piping 58 to selectively open and close<br>
the path formed by the piping 58. The piping 58 is used to equalize the pressures within<br>
the internal volumes 26, 50, as discussed below.<br>
[0074] The loading system 10 preferably comprises a controller 60 (see Figures 3<br>
and 6). The actuators 36a, 42a, 48a, 55a, 59a of the respective valves 36, 42, 48, 55, 59<br>
are electrically coupled to the controller 60. This feature permits the operation of the<br>
valves 36, 42, 48, 55, 59 to be controlled by the controller 60.<br>
[0075] The controller 60 is a programmable loop controller (PLC), although<br>
virtually any type of computing device such as a minicomputer, microcomputer, etc. can<br>
be used as the controller 60 in alternative embodiments. A server or mainframe computer<br>
that controls other equipment and processes at the refinery in which the loading system 10<br>
is operated can also be used to control the loading system 10 in the alternative.<br>
For example, a computer based system known as a "distributed control system" or DCS is<br>
an example of a centralized system used by FCC unit operators to control a number of unit<br>
operations. Controller 60 can be coupled to and/or communications lines can be<br>
establisned between controller 60 and the DCS so that the DCS controls the loading<br>
system through the controller.<br>
[0076] The controller 60 can include a control panel 64 for inputting commands<br>
and operating data to the controller 60 (see Figures 3 and 6). The controller 60 and the<br>
control panel 64 can be mounted on the cabinet 19. The control panel 64 by itself, or both<br>
the control panel 64 and the controller 60 can be mounted at a convenient location remote<br>
from the remainder of the loading system 10 in alternative embodiments. For example, the<br>
control panel 64 can be mounted in a central control room of the refinery, thus allowing<br>
the operation of the loading system 10 to be controlled on a remote basis.<br>
[0077] The controller 60 can be configured to cause a predetermined amount of<br>
catalyst and/or additive to be injected into the regenerator. The predetermined amount can<br>
be input to the controller 60 by the user via the control panel 64.<br>
[0078] Moreover, the controller 60 can be configured to facilitate injection of the<br>
catalyst and/or additive on a cyclical basis. For example, the controller 60 can be<br>
programmed to facilitate the injection of a predetermined amount of additive over a<br>
twenty-four hour period, i.e., per day, using a predetermined number of discrete injections<br>
over that period. The operation of the loading system 10 over one such cycle is described<br>
below, and is depicted in the form of a flow diagram in Figure 7.<br>
[0079] (The controller 60 can also be configured to facilitate injection of the<br>
catalyst and/or additive on a non-cyclical basis. In other words, the controller 60 can be<br>
programmed to facilitate periodic injections of varying amounts of catalyst and/or<br>
additive.)<br>
[0080] The total amount of catalyst and/or additive to be injected over the twentyfour<br>
hour period can be input to the controller 60 by the user using the control panel 64.<br>
The number of discrete injections to be performed per day can also be input by way of the<br>
control panel 64. (The controller 60 can be programmed to operate based on other inputs<br>
in alternative embodiments. For example, the controller 60 can be programmed to inject a<br>
predetermined amount of additive per cycle, using predetermined interval between<br>
injections.)<br>
[0081] The controller 60 can be programmed to automatically calculate the amount<br>
of catalyst and/or additive to be injected during each cycle based on the above-noted<br>
inputs. The controller 60 can also be programmed to calculate the time interval between<br>
the start of each injection. The interval is calculated by dividing twenty-four hours by the<br>
required number of injections per day. Moreover, the controller 60 can be configured to<br>
accept an input denoting the particular storage bin 37 from which the catalyst and/or<br>
additive is to be drawn.<br>
[0082] The controller 60 sends a control input to the actuator 42a of the valve 42<br>
associated with the particular storage bin 37 from which the catalyst and/or additive is to<br>
be drawn (see Figure 7). The control input causes the actuator 42a to open the valve 42,<br>
thereby placing the storage bin 37 in fluid communication with the dust collector 16. (The<br>
valves 36, 42,48, 55, 59 are in their respective closed positions, and the plug 45 of the<br>
valve 43 is in its open (lower) position at the start of the cycle.)<br>
[0083] The controller 60 also sends an input to the actuator 36a of the valve 36,<br>
thereby allowing pressurized air to flow through the vacuum producer 30. The vacuum<br>
producer 30 creates a vacuum within the internal volume 26 of the dust collector 16 in<br>
response to the flow of pressurized air therethrough, as discussed above.<br>
[0084] The vacuum within the internal volume 26 draws the catalyst and/or<br>
additive from the storage bin 37 and into the upper portion 16a of the dust collector 16.<br>
(The direction of travel of the catalyst and/or additive through the loading system 10 is<br>
denoted by arrows 65 in Figure 1.) The catalyst and/or additive subsequently falls toward<br>
the lower portion 16b due to gravity, and enters the transfer pot 18 by way of the opening<br>
23 in the lower portion 16b, as noted previously.<br>
[0085] The controller 60 continually monitors the weight of the loading unit 14,<br>
and the weight of the catalyst and/or additive added thereto. (The combined weight of the<br>
loading unit 14 and any catalyst and/or additive therein is hereinafter referred to as the<br>
"live weight" of the loading system 10). In particular, the load cells 56 are electrically<br>
coupled to the controller 60. The controller 60 receives inputs from each of the load cells<br>
56, and adds the inputs to determine the live weight of the loading system 10.<br>
[0086] The controller 60 calculates the amount of catalyst and/or additive that is<br>
added to the loading system 10. The controller 60 performs this calculation by subtracting<br>
the live weight of the loading system 10 at a given instant from the live weight of the<br>
loading system 10 at the start of the cycle, i.e., immediately prior to the opening of the<br>
valves 36, 42 (the loading unit 14 is assumed to be substantially empty of catalyst and/or<br>
additive at the start of the cycle).<br>
[0087] The controller 60 stops the flow of catalyst and/or additive to the dust<br>
collector 16 as the amount of catalyst and/or additive added to the loading system 10<br>
approaches the amount to be injected into the regenerator during each cycle (this amount is<br>
subsequently referred to as a "target value")- In particular, the controller 60 sends a<br>
control input to the actuator 42a of the open the valve 42 as the weight of the catalyst of<br>
additive approaches its target value. The control input causes the valve 42 to close,<br>
thereby interrupting the flow of catalyst and/or additive to the dust collector 16. (The<br>
controller 60 can be programmed to commence the closing of the valve 42 when the<br>
weight of the catalyst and/or additive is below the target weight by a predetermined<br>
amount, so as to compensate for the lag between the issuance of the "close" command to<br>
the valve 42, and the point at which the valve 42 is fully closed).<br>
[0088] The controller 60 also sends a control input to the actuator 36a of the valve<br>
36 as the weight of the catalyst of additive in the loading system 10 reaches its target<br>
value. The control input causes the actuator 36a to close the valve 36, thereby interrupting<br>
the flow of pressurized air through the vacuum producer 30.<br>
[0089] The controller 60 subsequently sends a control input to the actuator 48a of<br>
the valve 48 to cause the valve 48 to open. Opening the valve 48 permits pressurized air to<br>
enter the internal volume 50 of the transfer pot by way of the piping 46. The pressurized<br>
air impinges on the plug 45 of the valve 43 upon exiting the piping 46, and thereby urges<br>
the plug 45 into its closed (upper) position against the lower portion 16b of the dust<br>
collector 16, as discussed above. The contact between the plug 45 and the lower portion<br>
16b covers and seals the opening 23.<br>
[0090] The pressurized air pressurizes the internal volume 50 of the transfer pot 18<br>
after the opening 23 has been sealed by the plug 45. (The pressurized air, as discussed<br>
above, is dried by the volume chamber and moisture trap 49 before reaching the transfer<br>
pot 18, thereby minimizing the potential for contamination of the catalyst and/or additive<br>
within the transfer pot 18.)<br>
[0091] The controller 60 receives an input from a first pressure transducer 68 that<br>
measures the pneumatic pressure in the internal volume 50 (see Figure 6). The controller<br>
60 also receives an input from a second pressure transducer 70 that measures the<br>
pneumatic pressure in the regenerator proximate the location at which the catalyst and/or<br>
additive is injected.<br>
[0092] The controller 60 sends a control input to the actuator 4Sa of the valve 48<br>
when the difference between the pneumatic pressures in the internal volume 50 and the<br>
regenerator 14 reaches a predetermined value, i.e., when the pressure in the internal<br>
volume 50 exceeds the pressure in the regenerator by a predetermined amount. This<br>
control input causes the valve 48 to close.<br>
[0093] The controller 60 subsequently sends a control input to the actuator 55a of<br>
the valve 55 to cause the valve 55 to open. The differential between the pressures in the<br>
internal volume 50 arid the regenerator causes the catalyst and/or additive in the transfer<br>
pot 18 to flow into the regenerator by way of the piping 54.<br>
[0094] The controller 60 sends a control input to the actuator 55a to close the valve<br>
55, after a predetermined interval has passed following issuance of the control input to<br>
open the valve 55. (The predetermined interval should be chosen so as to allow sufficient<br>
time for substantially all of the catalyst and/or additive in the transfer pot 18 to be injected<br>
into the regenerator). Alternatively, the controller 60 can send a control input to the<br>
actuator 55a to close the valve 55 when the pressure differential between the internal<br>
volume 50 and the regenerator reaches approximately zero.<br>
[0095] The controller 60 subsequently sends a control input to the actuator 59a of<br>
the valve 59 to cause the valve 59 to open. The opening of the valve 59 permits the<br>
pneumatic pressures within the internal volumes 26, 50 to substantially equalize. In<br>
particular, opening the valve 59 relieves the relatively high pressure in the internal volume<br>
50 (which is approximately equal to pressure within the regenerator 14) by way of the<br>
piping 58.<br>
[0096] The controller 60 sends a control input to the actuator 59a of the valve 59<br>
when the pressure differential between the internal volumes 26, 50 is approximately zero<br>
(the pneumatic pressure in the internal volume 26 can be measured by a third pressure<br>
transducer 72 located therein). This control input causes the valve 59 to close.<br>
[0097] The controller 60 can be programmed to repeat the above process after the<br>
calculated interval between the start of each injection cycle (discussed above) has passed.<br>
[0098] Moreover, the controller 60 can be programmed to inject catalyst and/or<br>
additive from any of the other storage bins 37 after the above-described cycle has been<br>
completed. In other words, another injection cycle can be performed in a manner identical<br>
to that described above, with the exception that the valve 42 associated with one of the<br>
other storage bins 37 can be opened to allow the catalyst and/or additive from that<br>
particular storage bin 37 to be drawn into the dust collector 16.<br>
[0099] Vacuuming the catalyst and/or additive directly from its storage bin 37 can<br>
provide substantial flexibility in the operation of the loading system 10. For example, the<br>
loading system 10 can draw catalyst and/or additive from virtually any location at the<br>
refinery accessible by a hose such as the hose 38. Hence; the storage bins 37 can be<br>
positioned at an optimal location within the refinery. Moreover, the use of vacuum as a<br>
means to transport the catalyst and/or additive to the loading system 10 can permit the<br>
catalyst and/or additive to be drawn directly from its shipping container. Hence, the<br>
expenditure of time and labor associated with transferring the catalyst and/or additive from<br>
its shipping container to a storage unit can be eliminated through the use of the loading<br>
system 10.<br>
[0100] Moreover, vacuuming the catalyst and/or additive directly into the dust<br>
collector 16 can obviate the need to transfer the catalyst and/or additive into a relatively<br>
large storage hopper (as is typically required with conventional loaders). Hence, the<br>
expenditure of time and labor associated with transferring the catalyst and/or additive to a<br>
storage hopper can be eliminated through the use of the loading system 10.<br>
[0101] Eliminating the need for a storage hopper can also minimize the amount of<br>
space needed to accommodate the loading system 10. For example, the footprint the<br>
loading system 10 is approximately four feet by four feet, and the maximum height of the<br>
loading system is approximately five feet. A conventional loader of comparable capacity<br>
(with its storage hopper) can have a footprint of approximately five feet by eight feet, and<br>
a height of approximately twenty feet. (The dimensions of the loading system 10 will vary<br>
by application, and specific dimensions are provided herein for exemplary purposes only.)<br>
Moreover, in contradistinction to many conventional loaders, the loading system 10 can be<br>
installed without the use of special mounting provisions such as a base specifically tailored<br>
to a particular installation.<br>
[0102] The loading system 10 can be repositioned with relative ease due to the<br>
absence of a storage hopper. In particular, the absence of a storage hopper provides a<br>
measure of portability to the loading system 10, and can facilitate movement of the loading<br>
system 10 between different locations within the refinery (or between different refineries)<br>
with a minimal expenditure of time and effort in comparison to conventional loaders.<br>
Portability and ease of use for the user of the loading system 10 is further enhanced when<br>
the loading system 10 is used in conjunction with portable storage bins, e.g., known as<br>
"totes," which are normally built to hold approximately 2,000 pounds (approximately 900<br>
kilograms) of catalyst and/or additive.<br>
[0103] The absence of a storage hopper, it is believed, can also minimize the<br>
amount of time necessary to install the loading system 10 in relation to conventional<br>
loaders. The ability to install the loading system 10 in a minimal amount of time can be<br>
particularly beneficial, for example, where the use of the loading system 10 is required on<br>
an immediate basis to comply with a particular regulatory standard.<br>
[0104] The loading system 10 can be used to inject different types of catalyst<br>
and/or additives with no mechanical reconfiguration, and without the need to unload and<br>
reload a storage hopper. In particular, the loading system 10 can inject one type of catalyst<br>
and/or additive from one of the storage bins 37, and can immediately thereafter inject<br>
another type of catalys't from another of the storage bins 37 by manipulating the valves 42<br>
in the appropriate manner. Of course, the loading system 10 can also be used to load ?<br>
product stored in just one storage bin. In any event, the need for multiple loaders to inject<br>
different types of catalyst and/or additives can thus be eliminated through the use of the<br>
loading system 10. It is believed that that substantial savings in time, labor, refinery space,<br>
and money can be achieved by eliminating the need to purchase, install, and maintain<br>
multiple loaders each dedicated to a particular type of catalyst and/or additive.<br>
[0105] Eliminating multiple loaders and employing the invention also eliminates<br>
multiple lines from the loaders being connected to the catalyst and/or additive addition line<br>
of the FCC unit, and in particular the catalyst and/or additive addition line to the FCC<br>
unit's regenerator. Having multiple lines routed into the catalyst and/or additive addition<br>
line can lead to blockages at the point where the multiple lines converge, or causes<br>
blockages close thereto. Typical embodiments of the invention, however, are designed to<br>
have only one supply line exiting the loading system and to be connected to the catalyst<br>
and/or additive addition line of the FCC unit, and therefore does not provide a routing<br>
configuration that leads to the aforementioned blockages.<br>
[0106] Eliminating the use of a storage hopper can also reduce the amount of<br>
moisture to which the catalyst and/or additive is exposed. In particular, the use of the<br>
loading system 10 permits the catalyst and/or additive to remain in the storage bins 37<br>
until a point immediately prior to its injection into the regenerator 14. The environment in<br>
the storage bins 37, it is believed, can be controlled more closely than that within a storage<br>
hopper. In particular, catalyst and/or additive is typically exposed to plant air when being<br>
transported to and stored in a hopper. Plant air is often a source of moisture, oil based<br>
products, or other contamination that can adversely affect catalyst and/or additive. Hence,<br>
minimizing the exposure of the catalyst and/or additive to plant air, as in the loading<br>
system 10, can reduce the potential for contamination of the catalyst and/or additive.<br>
Reducing such contamination also reduces the catalyst and/or additive from agglomerating<br>
or clumping together. Such agglomeration makes the catalyst and/or additive less fluid,<br>
and can lead to plugging of hoses and supply lines. The invention thereby helps insure<br>
that the catalyst remains fluid as it is transported through the system.<br>
[0107] As a result of the invention reducing contamination and inadvertent water<br>
absorption, the invention can be employed to load and/or transport hygroscopic material<br>
wherein it is desirable to process, handle and deliver such material with little increase in<br>
water uptake. By "hygroscopic", it is meant having the property of absorbing atmospheric<br>
moisture. Hygroscopic materials include, but are not limited to, food products,<br>
pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals, as well as catalyst and/or additives, e.g., FC.C<br>
catalysts and/or additives. The invention is also suitable for delivering materials that acre<br>
formulated or otherwise possess pyrophoric properties when used, e.g., spark or flame<br>
inducing.<br>
[0108] For the purpose of understanding such uses, one can refer to earlier<br>
descriptions relating to delivering catalyst and/or additive and apply those teachings when<br>
using the invention to store, process, handle and/or deliver hygroscopic or pyrophoric<br>
material. For example, it is envisioned that the invention be can used to transport and/or<br>
deliver hygroscopic material and pyrophoric material to delivery vehicles, reactor units,<br>
mixers, or storage containers designed for delivery of the materials to individual<br>
consumers of the relevant product.<br>
[0109] The pressurized volume loading system 10 is believed to be less than that of<br>
conventional loaders of comparable capacity. Hence, less pressurized air is required to<br>
operate the loading system 10 in comparison to conventional loaders. This feature can<br>
reduce the operating cost of the loading system 10 in relation to conventional loaders. For<br>
example, in instances where multiple conventional loaders are employed in a plant,<br>
consumption of pressurized plant air can be significant, especially when multiple<br>
conventional loaders are being operated simultaneously. Indeed, there can be large<br>
pressure drops when simultaneously using multiple loaders of the conventional type. Such<br>
pressure drops can lead to incomplete delivery of catalyst and/or additive, as well<br>
detrimentally affect the performance of other plant operations that employ plant air. These<br>
pressure drops, however, can be avoided when using typical embodiments of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0110] The loading unit 14 is substantially isolated from sources of pressurized air<br>
as the catalyst and/or additive is transferred thereto, due primarily to the use of a vacuum<br>
to transfer the catalyst and/or additive. Hence, the potential for the readings of the load<br>
cells 56 to be biased by forces induced by pressurized air is believed to be minimal.<br>
(Some types of conventional loaders, as discussed above, transfer catalyst and/or additive<br>
under pressure from a storage hopper to a transport unit. The pressurized air used effect<br>
the transfer can adversely affect readings of the transfer pot's weight.)<br>
