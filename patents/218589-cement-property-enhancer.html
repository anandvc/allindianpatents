				<td>Cement Property Enhancer<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
This invention relates to a composition which improves the properties of cement and white cement when mixed together. Such properties include improved gripping power, damp proofing, preventing hair cracking, desaltification of construction, minimizing heat transmission through construction, improved compatibility of the repaired portions with the rest of construction areas, prolonged strength of construction, better finish, reduced cement consumption resulting in economy of scale etc.<br>
This invention also relates to a process of preparing the said composition. This invention further relates to a method of using the composition.<br>
This invention still further relates to a method of enhancing the properties of cement and white cement.<br>
This invention additionally relates to a method of damp proofing in construction.<br>
This invention still additionally relates to a method of preventing hair cracking of white cement.<br>
This invention still further relates to a method of desaltification of construction etc.<br>
Almost all construction work involve the use of cement externally and internally. For better internal finish, flooring etc. white cement is also increasingly used. Needless to say that there is no better and cheap material available which can replace the mass use of cement and white cement where applicable in construction job. It is also a fact that a good civil construction from cement, mortar, steel etc, gives the building a prolong life withstanding the fury of nature, weather conditions such as summer heat, winter, monsoon, thunderstorm etc. But it is often noticed that a house gets damped, piaster loosened or cracked externally or internally sooner or later. Rainwater or water from other sources within the building penetrates, spoil the belongings and create damages to the whole building property. Life term of such buildings gets reduced unless repaired and living in such buildings also becomes hazardous.Even a good finish white cement work can show micro-crack which often requires repair for preventing further damage. Once such defects are noticed in a construction it is extremely difficult within the known art to completely repair the defect for a prolong time at least.<br><br>
Prior Art:<br>
There is no exact prior art available by which bonding property of cement-mortar is known to get enhanced or modified. However, some related patent references available in the art are given below:<br>
EP 19910302346 19910319 by KAO Corporation (Japan) describes an additive to cement which uses organo zinc copolymer of an olefin having 2 to 8 carbon atoms and an ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydride.<br>
EP 20050006722 20050329 uses AI(OH)3 for accelerating the drying of air injected concrete.<br>
Patent application No. RU 20050102758 20050207 uses KCI as an additive for cement concrete and mortar mix.<br>
US patent application No. US 20030450495 20030616 where a cement additive has been described which reinforces cement. The additive comprises chlorides of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals and/or transition metals and oxides selected from the group consisting of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal oxides, aluminium oxide.<br>
US patent application No. US 20030396519 20030326 describes settable compositions for general purpose concrete construction containing class F fly ash, class C fly ash and/or slag, and KCI as a substantial replacement of portland cement conventionally used in such compositions. The KCI is an additive for improved high early strength and accelerated setting times, thereby allowing the concrete structure to be put into service sooner.<br>
Patent application No. GB 19730004417 19730129 describes an additive to cement which comprises calcium sulphate and calcium fluoroaluminate. It acts as an accelerator.<br>
German application DE 19712122710 19710507 describes an agent using calcined, dry AI2(SO4)3 in addition to diluent, an alkanolamino accelerator, i.e. ethanolamine and inorganic binding agent - sodium silicate.<br>
So the main object of the invention is to find and offer a solution to the technical problems associated with the civil construction, their prevention and repairs economically.<br>
While experimenting by using different salts with cement, this surprising invention could be developed by the inventor.<br><br><br>
Description of the invention:<br>
According to this invention there is provided a cement property enhancer composition comprising a mixture of Zn(OH)2, AI(OH)3, KCI, CaSO4 and H2SO4 as an aqueous suspension.<br>
The relative proportions of the components are based on amount of Zinc Sulphate, Calcium Chloride and Alum used in making the composition in the proportions of 1:0.5 -2:0,5 - 2 respectively by weight.<br>
The said composition is acidic in nature and has a pH of about 5.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing the said cement property enhancer composition which comprises mixing zinc sulphate, calcium chloride, and alum, boiling the same in water sufficiently to get an emulsion as the desired composition.<br>
The invention also provides for a method plastering/concrete roofing/pillar piling/ flooring/desaltification in concrete construction/damp proofing/repairing cracks/heat proofing/painting characterized in that the cement property enhancer composition is mixed with cement or white cement as applicable in an amount depending on the nature of work to be done such as herein described. The civil work can be construction of a new building or simply a repair job. The cement and/or white cement used for working the invention can be of any source, quality or brand.<br>
The invention also provides for a method of enhancing property of cement or white cement comprising mixing cement or white cement with the cement property enhancer composition before use.<br>
Generally the proportion of the cement property enhancer composition of the invention used is 7 to 14 gms of the composition per kg of cement used.<br>
Preparation method:<br>
The process for preparation of the cement property enhancer composition: Raw materials:-<br>
a)	Zinc Sulphate (ZnSO4)<br>
b)	Calcium Chloride (CaCI2)<br>
c)	Alum (K2SO4, AI2(SO4)3, 24H2O)<br>
d)	Water (H2O)<br>
4<br><br>
d) Water (H2O)<br>
Equipments:<br>
a)	Heating stove or oven<br>
b)	Fuel<br>
c)	Stainless steel cauldron<br>
d)	Stirring means (stainless steel)<br>
Procedure:<br>
Heat water (1 Lt) to boiling in the stainless steel cauldron. Mix the raw materials zinc sulphate, calcium chloride and alum in equal proportions (totaling 1 kg). Add the mixture to the boiling water. Continue boiling the mixture with stirring with a stainless steel stirrer for one to one and half hour till the mass becomes a suspension like. Mass temperature to be within 120 - 180 degrees C. Remove the cauldron from the stove. Add 150 - 200 ml water per kg of suspension to make it a homogeneous liquid emulsion. Allow it to cool and store in natural environment in closed plastic or glass bottles.<br>
The product composition as an aqueous suspension constitutes a   mixture of Zn(OH)2, AI(OH)3, KCl, CaSO4 and H2SO4.<br>
The raw materials are readily available in the market and are of commercial grade.<br>
Method of using:<br>
Using the composition of the invention is very simple. However, depending upon the nature of the use or application the proportion of the composition is determined. For example, to make brick wall, plastering, concrete roof, flooring and pillaring in a new building, ratio of the composition to the mortar is 450 gm per 1 bag (50 kg) cement. Slight deviation in proportion as prescribed would not make much difference in the end result. But in case of repair work, to increase the gripping property, the ratio of the composition to the mortar is 600 gm per 1 bag (50 kg) cement to be mixed with water.<br>
To make desaftification in new concrete construction, simply the composition can be used as cement additive. But in case of repair of old concrete buildings, firstly the composition is needed to be spread over the affected surface before actually applying the total mix of the composition, cement, sand etc. for increasing the gripping property.<br>
5<br><br>
To make damp proof of new and old concrete constructions same method of application as in the case of desaltification is to be followed.<br>
In case of repairing the crack in a building and roof, the composition of the invention acts as an adhesive. Firstly, the affected area needs to be cleaned. Then the composition of the invention is spread to have a thin layer. After the same, the mixture of the composition with cement and sand etc. be plastered on the area.<br>
For heat proofing, a thin layer of the composition is applied on both the outer and inner surface of the walls of the existinq building. In case of new building, the plastering is done with the composition of the invention added to cement and sand in the general way. But in case of old buildings the treatment as in the case of desaltification is to be followed.<br>
The composition of the invention will prevent hair cracking and increase the density of the piaster. So using this property it is possible to make the floor stony like, it can be used for white cement wash. It can also be used for colouring outside and inside the building with all beneficial qualities as aforesaid. It can also be applied to plaster of pans over the wet surface.<br>
Exact mechanism as to how the composition of the invention works is not known. However, it is believed that using this composition with cement and sand etc. there occurs a kind of polymerization resulting in an increase of density of the plaster and minimization of the gap between sand and sand. This helps to increase the strength of the concrete. In the mortar the salts possibly change their character which does not absorb environment water or moisture. There are minimum pores, thus remains damp proof in comparison with the structures where such composition of the invention is not used. By the same mechanism, because of the increase in the density of the plaster using this invented composition and reducing the sand to sand gap reduction of heat transmission through the concrete surface could be possible. To repair the crack on the wall, roof in the construction, this invented composition acts as an adhesive. Similarly, when white cement is mixed with this composition, the resulting mixture prevents hair crack. The extra gripping or increase in sand to sand bond strength could be also due to polymerization and electronic bonding of the substances used.<br>
The invented composition has long shelf life in normal temperature, light and air. It is non-toxic, non-corrosive, mildly acidic, non-odourous, white in colour and also is environment friendly.<br>
6<br><br>
Examples of some work applications or use where cement property is shown to have been enhanced:<br>
1)	A   new small  cottage  made  with  the  cement  property  enhancer<br>
composition of the invention in West Rabindra Nagar, Kolkata-65<br>
where   costing   came   less   than   the   conventional   cost   with   less<br>
consumption  of cement.   Inside temperature  is  cooler than  other<br>
cottages. It was also damp proof. Strength became such that drilling<br>
machine could not penetrate the wall<br>
2)	Repair of multiple roof crack three years back at the same locality<br>
where the construction is still damp proof and crack proof with inside<br>
cooling effect control.<br>
3)	Making of a floor one year back in the same building. Still no hair<br>
crack is noticed. The floor remains marble like.<br>
4)	Painting of wall was done with this invented composition in the same<br>
building about six months back and found to have better finish.<br>
5)	Two storied new construction was constructed one and a half year<br>
back at the same locality with the help of this invented composition.<br>
Requirement of cement was less than usual ratio of cement and sand<br>
1:8. Still it is damp, heat and salt proof. The roof was done using<br>
cement with  half of the normal ratio of cement and  sand. Wail<br>
colouring was done with the help of this invented composition. The<br>
wall was washable and still has not developed any crack.<br><br>
6)	Repair done of cracks developed in an old building in the same area<br>
two years back. Repairs were done in the usual way several times<br>
before but failed. The invented composition helped to repair the crack<br>
and the construction is still in good condition.<br>
7)	Treatment was done to a concrete roof water tank using the invented<br>
composition about two years back. Still there is no water soaking.<br>
Plastering and colouring done with this invented composition are still<br>
intact.<br>
8)	Plaster of paris done to a multistoried building about two years back<br>
     with the help of this invented composition in Birati, Kolkata-65. Still the<br>
condition is good.<br>
