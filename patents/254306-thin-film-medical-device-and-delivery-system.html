THJN FILM MEDICAL DEVICE AND DELIVERY SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a thin film medical device, and in particular to an<br>
intraluminal thin film medical device and delivery system. This medical device and delivery<br>
system are particularly well suited for occlusion of an aneurysm, vessel side branch or<br>
dissection of a body lumen or duct, such as an artery or vein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are many instances when it may be desirable to permanently occlude a vessel in<br>
the human body. Examples of when permanent occlusion of a vessel might be desirable<br>
include: occlusion of an aneurysm or side branch vessel; therapeutic occlusion, or embolization,<br>
of the renal artery; occlusion of a Blalock-Taussig Shunt; pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae and<br>
transjugular intrahepatic stent shunt occlusion; some non-vascular applications, such as<br>
therapeutic ureteric occlusion; and the occlusion of vessels feeding large cancerous tumors.<br>
In the past, certain coiled stents, stent grafts or detachable balloons have been utilized<br>
for providing permanent occlusion of vessels. Stent-grafts are essentially endoluminal stents<br>
with a discrete covering on either or both of the luminal and ablurninal surfaces of the stent that<br>
occludes the open spaces, or interstices, between adjacent structural members of the<br>
endoluminal stent. It is known in the art to fabricate stent-grafts by covering the stent with<br>
endogenous vein or a synthetic material, such as woven polyester known as DACRON, or with<br>
expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. Additionally, it is known in the art to cover the stent with a<br>
biological material, such as a xenograft or collagen.<br>
There are certain problems associated with coiled stents, including, migration of the<br>
coiled stent within the vessel to be occluded, perforation of the vessel by the coiled stent, and<br>
failure to completely thrombose, or occlude, the vessel. Another disadvantage associated with<br>
such coiled stents is that the vessel may not be immediately occluded following placement in<br>
the vessel. Disadvantages associated with detachable occlusion balloons include premature<br>
detachment with distal embolization, or occlusion, and they are believed to require a longer<br><br>
period of time for the user of the device to learn how to properly use such detachable occlusion<br>
balloons.<br>
In addition to vessel occlusion, conventional graft type intraluminal medical devices are<br>
frequently used post-angioplasty in order to provide a structural support for a blood vessel and<br>
reduce the incidence of restenosis following percutaneous balloon angioplasty. A principal<br>
example are endovascular stents which are introduced to a site of disease or trauma within the<br>
body's vasculature from an introductory location remote from the disease or trauma site using<br>
an introductory catheter, passed through the vasculature communicating between the remote<br>
introductory location and the disease or trauma site, and released from the introductory catheter<br>
at the disease or trauma site to maintain patency of the blood vessel at the site of disease or<br>
trauma. Stent-grafts are delivered and deployed under similar circumstances and are utilized to<br>
maintain patency of an anatomic passageway, for example, by reducing restenosis following<br>
angioplasty, or when used to exclude an aneurysm, such as in aortic aneurysm exclusion<br>
applications.<br>
While these medical devices have specific advantages, their overall size, in particular<br>
the diameter and delivery profile, are significant disadvantages that render these devices<br>
prohibitive for certain uses. Another significant disadvantage is the limited flexibility these<br>
devices have for navigating paths through small and/or tortuous vessels. As such, they may not<br>
be desirable for many small diameter vessel applications, for example neurovascular vessels.<br>
What is needed is a medical device capable of occluding various parts of a vessel that<br>
can assume a reduced diameter and delivery profile.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a delivery system for an intraluminal thin film medical<br>
device particularly well suited for occlusion of an aneurysm, vessel side branch or dissection of<br>
a body lumen or duct, such as an artery or vein.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the delivery system comprises an outer sheath<br>
attached along the distal end of a relatively long and flexible tubular shaft. The outer sheath is<br>
capable of constraining the thin film medical device in a longitudinally stretched position, and<br>
subsequently being retracted relative to the flexible tubular shaft to release the thin film medical<br><br>
device from the constrained longitudinally stretched position. The delivery system further<br>
comprises a secondary sheath substantially coaxial too, and slideably engaged within, the outer<br>
sheath. The secondary sheath is capable of restraining the self-expanding support structure in<br>
a radially constrained position, and subsequently being retracted to release the self-expanding<br>
support structure from the radially constrained position. An inner lumen is substantially coaxial<br>
to the outer sheath and incorporated into the flexible tubular shaft.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the delivery system is configured for deploying<br>
a self-supporting thin film medical device in a body lumen. The delivery system comprises<br>
an outer sheath attached along the distal end of a relatively long and flexible tubular<br>
shaft. The outer sheath is capable of constraining the thin film medical device in a longitudinally<br>
stretched position, and subsequently being retracted relative to the flexible tubular shaft to<br>
release the thin film medical device from the constrained longitudinally stretched position. The<br>
delivery system further comprises an inner lumen substantially coaxial to the outer sheath, and<br>
incorporated into the flexible tubular shaft.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, the delivery system is configured to deploy<br>
a thin film medical device and a mechanically expandable radial support structure. The delivery<br>
system comprises an outer sheath attached along the distal end of a relatively long and flexible<br>
tubular shaft. The outer sheath is capable of constraining the thin film medical device in a<br>
longitudinally stretched position, and subsequently being retracted relative to the flexible tubular<br>
shaft to release the thin film medical device from the constrained longitudinally stretched<br>
position. The delivery system further comprises a mechanical expansion catheter substantially<br>
coaxial too, and slideably engaged within, the outer sheath. The mechanical expansion<br>
catheter is capable of radially expanding the expandable support structure. An inner lumen<br>
substantially coaxial to the outer sheath and incorporated into the flexible tubular shaft is also<br>
provided.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention discloses delivery system for a thin film medical device<br>
particularly well suited for occlusion of an aneurysm or vessel side branch, or dissection of body<br>
lumen or duct, such as an artery or vein. One advantage of the present invention is that it<br>
allows for multi-stage deployment of various members of the medical device. For example the<br>
delivery system will allow a thin film medical device to first expand independently of a supporting<br>
structure as herein disclosed. This permits the use of a thin film having different foreshortening<br>
characteristics than the support structure. In addition, it allows the thin film to be designed with<br>
a geometric pattern optimal for occluding blood, and eliminates the need to design a geometric<br>
pattern designed to have the same foreshortening properties as the supporting structure.<br>
Although this specification provides detailed description for implantation of the medical<br>
device in a artery or vein, one of skill in the art would understand that modifications of the<br>
disclosed invention would also be well suited for use on other body lumens and anatomical<br>
passageways, such as, for example those found in the cardiovascular, lymphatic, endocrine,<br>
renal, gastrointestinal and or reproductive systems.<br>
The primary component of the medical device is a thin film made primarily of a<br>
substantially self-supporting biocompatible metal or psuedometal. The thin film may be<br>
fabricated either as single layer, or a plurality of layers. The terms "thin film", "metal film", "thin<br>
metallic film", and "metallic thin film" are used synonymously in this application to refer to a<br>
single or plural layer film fabricated of biocompatible metal or biocompatible pseudometals<br>
having a thickness greater than 0.1 urn but less than 250 pm, preferably between 1 and 50 urn.<br>
In some particular embodiments of the invention, such as where the thin film is used as a<br>
structural support component, the thin film may have a thickness greater than approximately 25<br>
pm. In other embodiments, for example, where the thin film is used as a cover member with<br>
additional structural support, the thin film may have a thickness of between approximately 0.1<br>
pm and 30 pm, most preferably between 0.1 µm and 10 µm.<br><br>
In a preierrea embodiment, the medical device is fabricated from a shape memory thin<br>
metallic film or pseudometallic film having super elastic characteristics. One example of a<br>
shape memory metallic thin film is Nickel Titanium (Nitinol) formed into a tubular structure.<br>
Nitinol is utilized in a wide variety of applications, including medical device applications<br>
as described above. Nitinol or NiTi alloys are widely utilized in the fabrication or construction of<br>
medical devices for a number of reasons, including its biomechanical compatibility, its bio-<br>
compatibility, its fatigue resistance, its kink resistance, its uniform plastic deformation, its<br>
magnetic resonance imaging compatibility, its ability to exert constant and gentle outward<br>
pressure, its dynamic interference, its thermal deployment capability, its elastic deployment<br>
capability, its hysteresis characteristics, and is moderately radiopacity.<br>
Nitinol, as described above, exhibits shape memory and/or super elastic characteristics.<br>
Shape memory characteristics may be simplistically described as follows. A metallic structure,<br>
for example, a Nitinol tube that is in an Austenitic phase may be cooled to a temperature such<br>
that it is in the Martensitic phase. Once in the Martensitic phase, the Nitinol tube may be<br>
deformed into a particular configuration or shape by the application of stress. As long as the<br>
Nitinol tube is maintained in the Martensitic phase, the Nitinol tube will remain in its deformed<br>
shape. If the Nitinol tube is heated to a temperature sufficient to cause the Nitinol tube to reach<br>
the Austenitic phase, the Nitinol tube will return to its original or programmed shape. The<br>
original shape is programmed to be a particular shape by well-known techniques as briefly<br>
described above.<br>
Super elastic characteristics may be simplistically described as follows. A metallic<br>
structure for example, a Nitinol tube that is in an Austenitic phase may be deformed to a<br>
particular shape or configuration by the application of mechanical energy. The application of<br>
mechanical energy causes a stress induced Martensitic phase transformation. In other words,<br>
the mechanical energy causes the Nitinol tube to transform from the Austenitic phase to the<br>
Martensitic phase. By utilizing the appropriate measuring instruments, one can determined that<br>
the stress from the mechanical energy causes a temperature drop in the Nitinol tube. Once the<br>
mechanical energy or stress is released, the Nitinol tube undergoes another mechanical phase<br>
transformation back to the Austenitic phase and thus its original or programmed shape. As<br><br>
described above, the original shape is programmed by well know techniques. The Martensitic<br>
and Austenitic phases are common phases in many metals.<br>
Medical devices constructed from Nitinol are typically utilized in both the Martensitic<br>
phase and/or the Austenitic phase. The Martensitic phase is the low temperature phase. A<br>
material is in the Martensitic phase is typically very soft and malleable. These properties make<br>
it easier to shape or configure the Nitinol into complicated or complex structures. The Austenitic<br>
phase is the high temperature phase. A material in the Austenitic phase is generally much<br>
stronger than the materiel in the Martensitic phase. Typically, many medical devices are cooled<br>
to the Martensitic phase for manipulation and loading into delivery systems. When the device is<br>
deployed at body temperature, they return to the Austenitic phase.<br>
Although Nitinol is described in this embodiment, it should not be understood to limit the<br>
scope of the invention. One of skill in the art would understand that other materials, both<br>
metallic and pseudo-metallic exhibiting similar shape memory and super-elastic characteristics<br>
may be used.<br>
The tubular thin film structure is sized to match or be slightly greater than the diameter<br>
of the inner lumen of the body vessel when the tube is in the unrestrained (" self-expanded")<br>
configuration. The inherent properties of the thin Nitinol tube are such that the tube is capable<br>
of being longitudinally stretched, which decreases the tube's diameter. Reducing the diameter<br>
allows the medical device to maintain a compact profile for insertion into a body lumen via a<br>
catheter during a percutaneous, endoluminal procedure. Accordingly, the inherent shape<br>
memory and super-elastic characteristics allow the thin metallic tube to be stretched and<br>
restrained in a reduced profile configuration, and then self-expand back to its original "pre-<br>
stretched" diameter once the restraint is removed. As the tube diametrically expands, it<br>
longitudinally contracts or foreshortens to its pre-stretched length and diameter.<br>
Figures 1A and 1B show a medical device fabricated from a Nitinol thin film tube<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. Figure 1A shows the thin film medical<br>
device 100 in the deployed or "pre-stretched" configuration, while Figure 1B shows the thin film<br>
medical device 100 in the stretched reduced profile and restrained position.<br>
To facilitate the ability for the thin film medical device 100 to stretch in the longitudinal<br>
direction, the tubular structure 101 has a plurality of radial slots 102 incised or formed<br><br>
circumferentially through the tube 101 wall. In one embodiment, the slots are in the form of slits<br>
made completely through the thin film tube wall 101. Alternatively, where the thin film is<br>
manufactured in layers, the radial slots 102 may be through one or more layers of the thin film<br>
tube 101 wall. As the thin film tube 101 is longitudinally stretched, the slots 102 open, creating<br>
an opening in the tube 101 wall. When the thin film tube 101 is allowed to return to the pre-<br>
stretched (radially expanded) configuration, the radial slots 102 close, excluding blood flow in<br>
the circumferential direction.<br>
The terms exclude, excluding and variations thereof, should not be construed as having<br>
zero porosity and completely preventing fluid flow. Instead, the closed slits and apertures in the<br>
thin film that exclude fluid flow may have openings that are small enough to substantially<br>
occlude blood flow through the thin film tube 101 wall. A medical device 100 illustrating all the<br>
radial slots 102 in the open position is illustrated in Figure 1B.<br>
The medical device 100 may also be designed so that some of the radial slots 102 can<br>
open, while other radial slots 102 remain substantially closed. Figure 1C illustrates a medical<br>
device 100 where only a portion of the radial slots 102 along the proximal end 103 and distal<br>
end104 are open, while the radial slots 102 in the intermediate section remain closed.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the medical device 100 may also has<br>
apertures 102 incised or formed through the tube wall in various shapes. The shapes may be<br>
chosen to facilitate longitudinal stretching and/or radial expansion of the thin film tube.<br>
Essentially, the apertures 102 in the thin film have longitudinal and latitudinal dimensions,<br>
thereby forming an opening in the thin film having a net free open area.<br>
The above-described medical device 100 can be used, for example, across an<br>
aneurysm, side-branch vessel, or any vessel wall defect to exclude blood flow. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the tubular thin film 101 may be fabricated to a thickness that can<br>
support itself circumferentially. Alternatively, thinner films could be supported by a balloon or<br>
self-expanding stent or stents if additional radial support is needed.<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective partial section view showing a medical device 200 deployed in<br>
a vessel 205 according to one embodiment of the present invention. The vessel 205 has a<br>
weakened vessel wall causing an aneurysm 206, and the medical device 200 is deployed over<br>
the aneurysm 206. The medical device 200 is self-supporting, and does not require additional<br><br>
stent(s) for support. As described earlier, the medical device 200 comprises a thin metallic film<br>
tube 201 having a proximal end 203 and a distal end 204. The thin film tube 201 has a series of<br>
radial slots 202 arranged circumferentially along the thin film tube 201 longitudinal axis. Upon<br>
deployment from a catheter system, the radial slots 202 incised in the thin film tube 201<br>
substantially close, excluding blood flow in the circumferential direction. This relieves pressure<br>
in the aneurysm 206, and mitigates potential medical conditions associated with the aneurysm<br>
206 bursting. Reducing the pressure in the aneurysm 206 may also allow the vessel 205 wail to<br>
contract.<br>
The medical device may also include one or more stents to assist in securing the thin film tube<br>
into the vessel wall. Figure 3A shows a medical device 300 according to another embodiment<br>
of the present invention deployed over an aneurysm 306 in a vessel wall 305. Similar to the<br>
medical devices described above, the medical device 300 comprises a thin metallic film formed<br>
into a tube 301, having a proximal end 303 and distal end 304. The thin film tube 301 has a<br>
series of radial slots 302 incised circumferentially through the tube 301 wall. The medical<br>
device 300 additionally comprises a stent 307 along the proximal end 303.<br>
The stent 307 disclosed comprises at least one hoop structure extending between the stent 307<br>
proximal and distal ends, 303, 304 respectively. The hoop structure includes a plurality of<br>
longitudinally arranged strut members and a plurality of loop members connecting adjacent<br>
struts. Adjacent struts are connected at opposite ends in a substantially S or Z shaped<br>
sinusoidal pattern so as to form a plurality of cells. However, one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
would recognize that the pattern shaped by the struts is not a limiting factor, and other shaped<br>
patterns or radially expandable structures may be used.<br>
As previously described, the stent 307 assists in anchoring the medical device 300 to the vessel<br>
305 wall. The thin film tube 301 may be affixed to the stent 307 at anchor point 308.<br>
Attachment may be by any suitable attachment means, including adhesion resulting from radial<br>
pressure of the stent 307 against the thin metallic film tube 301, adhesion by means of a binder,<br>
heat, or chemical bond, and/or adhesion by mechanical means, such as welding or suturing<br>
between the stent 307 and the thin metallic film tube 301. It should be noted that the stent 307<br>
does not necessarily have to be fixedly attached to the metallic film tube 301. Instead, the<br><br>
radially outward force that stent 307 exerts against the vessel wall may be adequate to hold the<br>
metallic thin film 301 in place.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the thin metallic film tube 301 may be anchored to the<br>
vessel 305 wall by a plurality of anchors. Figure 3B shows a medical device 300 having a<br>
proximal stent 307 attaching the thin film tube 301 to the vessel 305 wall along the proximal end<br>
303, as well as a distal stent 309 attaching the distal end of the thin film tube 301 to the vessel<br>
305 wall along the distal end 304. Still one of skill in the art would understand that additional<br>
stents may be used to anchor the medical device 300 to the vessel 305 wall, such as additional<br>
proximal or distal anchors placed longitudinally along the thin film tube 301.<br>
In a further alternate embodiment, stents having multiple hoop structures or longer<br>
hoop structures may be used to fully support the thin metallic film along all or substantially all of<br>
the film's length. Figure 3C shows a medical device 300 having a multi-hoop stent 307<br>
supporting the metallic thin film 301 substantially along the entire length of the thin metallic film<br>
301.<br>
The multiple hoop stent 307 illustrated in Figure 3C comprises three hoop structures<br>
311A through 311C connected by a plurality of bridge members 314. Each bridge member 314<br>
comprises two ends 316A, 316B. One end 316A, 316B of each bridge 314 is attached to one<br>
hoop. Using hoop sections 311A and 311B for example, each bridge member 314 is connected<br>
at end 316A to the proximal end of hoop 311A, and at end 316B the distal end of hoop section<br>
311B.<br>
The various embodiments of the medical device described above are preferably<br>
delivered to the target area and subsequently deployed by a catheter system. Figure 4 is a<br>
longitudinal section view illustrating a medical device 400 having a self-supporting metallic thin<br>
film tube 401 loaded on a delivery catheter 420 according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The catheter 420 comprises an outer sheath 421 attached along the distal end of a<br>
relatively long and flexible tubular shaft, and an inner lumen 422. The outer sheath 421 serves<br>
to hold the thin film tube 401 in the longitudinally stretched position. The inner lumen 422 is<br>
substantially coaxial to the outer sheath 421 and provides a conduit for a guide wire.<br>
The outer sheath 421 can be made from a variety of polymeric materials, or<br>
combination of polymeric materials, as would be understood to one of skill in the art. In a<br><br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the material for the outer sheath 421 would include<br>
poly(ethylene)s, poly(amide)s, poly(urethane)s, poly(tetrafluroethylene)s, or a combination of<br>
these materials. Other polymeric materials may also be used, including poly(carbonate)s<br>
and/or, poly(imide)s. In other embodiment of the invention the outer sheath 421 could include<br>
reinforcement materials, such as metallic braid and high tensile strength polymeric braid woven<br>
in, or onto an inner or outer surface.<br>
The materials of construction for the inner lumen 422, sometimes called a guidewire<br>
lumen, would be obvious to those familiar with the art of balloon expandable delivery devices,<br>
PTCA devices, etc. In one embodiment of the invention, the inner lumen 422 may consist of a<br>
single polymeric material, a single polymeric material coated with a lubricious coating, or a<br>
multi-layered polymeric material. In a preferred embodiment the inner lumen 422 would be<br>
made from poly(ethylene)s, poly(amide)s, poly(urethane)s, poly(tetrafluroethylene)s, or a<br>
combination of these materials. Other polymeric materials may also be used, including<br>
poly(carbonate)s, poly(imide)s, poly(ether, ether-ketones)etc. Embodiments of the sheath could<br>
include reinforcement materials, such as metallic braid and high tensile strength polymeric<br>
braid. Lubricious coatings could be applied to the inner surface of this tube to assist guide wire<br>
movement.<br>
To be deployed, the medical device 400 is longitudinally stretched and mounted on the<br>
delivery catheter 420. A guide wire (not shown) is steered to the target area through well know<br>
means, and the delivery catheter 420/medical device 400 is loaded onto the guide wire using<br>
inner lumen 422. The catheter 420/medical device 400 is then pushed over the guide wire to<br>
the target site. Once properly located, the outer sheath 421 is retracted, allowing the thin film<br>
tube 401 to expand and longitudinally foreshorten to its unconstrained diameter. As previously<br>
described, this will allow the slots 402 (not shown) incised through the thin film tube 401 wall to<br>
substantially close and eliminate blood flow to the vessel wall defects.<br>
The illustrated embodiment describes an over-the-wire delivery catheter. However, one<br>
of skill in the art would understand that other types of delivery catheters may also be used,<br>
including catheters utilizing a monorail design as are known in the art.<br>
As previously described, very thin films may require extra radial support to adequately<br>
anchor the thin film in the vessel. In one embodiment, extra radial support could be supplied by<br><br>
lauiany cApai iuauie devices, such as radially expandable stents. Figure 5 is a longitudinal<br>
section view illustrating a medical device 500 having a self-expanding stent 507 for additional<br>
radial support according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The catheter 520 for restraining and delivering the medical device 500 having a self-<br>
expanding stent 507 has three main components. Similar to the embodiment described above,<br>
the catheter 520 comprises an outer sheath 521 that serves to hold the thin film tube 501 in the<br>
longitudinally stretched position. The outer sheath 521 can be made from various polymeric<br>
materials, or combination of polymeric materials known to one of skill in the art. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the outer sheath 521 is constructed from poly(ethy!ene)s, poly(amide)s,<br>
poly(urethane)s, poly(tetrafluroethylene)s, or a combination of these materials. Still other<br>
polymeric materials may also be used for outer sheath 521, including, poly(carbonate)s and/or<br>
poly(imide)s. In addition, embodiments of the sheath could include reinforcement materials,<br>
e.g., metallic braid and high tensile strength polymeric braid.<br>
Coaxial to the outer sheath 521 is a secondary sheath 523 of smaller diameter that<br>
serves to hold the self-expanding stent in a constrained position. Similar self-expanding stent<br>
constraining sheaths and delivery systems are found in U.S. Patent 6,425,898 entitled Delivery<br>
Apparatus for a Self-expanding Stent, issued on July 30, 2002 to Wilson, D. et al., which is<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety here.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the secondary sheath 523 is a composite structure<br>
incorporating an inner polytetrafluoroethylene layer, an outer polyamide layer, and a middle<br>
stainless steel braid wire layer. The outer layer can incorporate a single outer polyamide layer<br>
from proximal end to its distal end or can be a series of fused transitions decreasing in material<br>
durometer from proximal end to distal end along outer layer of the secondary sheath 523. The<br>
inclusion of transitions of varying material durometers can effectively enhance the catheter<br>
performance as it is pushed over the guidewire through the vascular anatomy. The flexibility of<br>
the delivery system from proximal end to distal end of secondary sheath 523 can improve the<br>
manner in which the system tracks over the guidewire.<br>
The inner, outer and middle layers of secondary sheath 523 collectively enhance the<br>
stent 507 deployment. In particular, the inner layer and outer layer help to prevent the stent 507<br>
from becoming too imbedded into the secondary sheath 523, prior to stent deployment. The<br><br>
middle braid layer provides radial support to the inner layer creating sufficient resistance to the<br>
outward radial force of the stent 507 within the secondary sheath 523. The inner layer also<br>
provides a low coefficient of friction surface to reduce the forces required to deploy the stent<br>
507. In addition to the above mentioned benefit, the braid layer offers many other advantages,<br>
including providing support to give the delivery catheter 520 better pushability. Pushability is,<br>
the ability to transmit a force applied by the physician at a proximal location on the delivery<br>
catheter to the distal tip, which aids in navigation across tight stenotic lesions within the vascular<br>
anatomy. The braid layer also gives the secondary sheath 523 better resistance to elongation<br>
and necking as a result of tensile loading during sheath retraction for stent deployment.<br>
The configuration of braid layer can be changed to change system performance. This is<br>
achieved by changing the pitch of the braid, the shape of the individual braid wires, the number<br>
of braid wires, and the braid wire diameter. Additionally, coils could be incorporated similarly to<br>
the braid layer of secondary sheath 523 to minimize stent embedment and enhance system<br>
flexibility. Use of coils in other types of catheters can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,279,596 issued<br>
to Castaneda et al. on Jan. 18, 1994, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Alternatively, the secondary sheath 523 of the delivery catheter 520 system may<br>
comprise three tubing sections (proximal sheath, distal sheath, and distal end). The proximal<br>
sheath may be constructed of 304 stainless steel hypo-tubing (O. D.=0.065", I.D. 0.053") and be<br>
approximately 20 inches long. The proximal end of the proximal shaft is attached to a valve that<br>
provides a seal to blood flow when closed, and allows free movement over the inner member<br>
when opened. Again, the use of stainless steel for the proximal end will give the physician the<br>
necessary stiffness and column strength to manipulate the system for deployment. The distal<br>
sheath of the secondary sheath 523 may also be constructed of a co-extruded tube of nylon-12<br>
over the PLEXAR PX209 polymer. The same logic used above applies, i.e. lubricity over the<br>
inner member (provided by the PLEXAR PX209 polymer) and the push and tracking ability of<br>
nylon-12. The distal tube is again heat fused to the distal sheath.<br>
As earlier described, the medical device 500 may have more than one stent for added<br>
radial support, i.e. may have stent 507 and 509 (not shown) as earlier described. In each case,<br>
secondary sheath 523 may serve to hold each radially expandable stent in the constrained<br>
position.<br><br>
the miro component or tne medical device 500 is an inner lumen 52?.. The inner lumen 522 is<br>
substantially coaxial to the outer sheath 521 and the secondary sheath 523, and provides a<br>
conduit for a guide wire. The thin film tube 501 is affixed to the stent 507 at anchor point 508.<br>
As earlier described, attachment may be by any suitable attachment means, including adhesion<br>
resulting from radial pressure of the stent 507 against the thin metallic film tube 501, adhesion<br>
by means of a binder, heat, or chemical bond, and/or adhesion by mechanical means, such as<br>
welding or suturing between the stent 507 and the thin metallic film tube 501.<br>
To be deployed, the medical device 500 is longitudinally stretched (axially), restrained,<br>
and mounted on the delivery catheter 520. A guide wire (not shown) is steered to the target<br>
area through well-known means, and the delivery catheter 520/medical device 500 is loaded<br>
onto the guide wire using inner lumen 522. Alternatively, the delivery catheter 520/medical<br>
device 500 may be loaded onto the guide wire in a monorail fashion as is known in the art. The<br>
catheter 520/medical device 500 is then pushed over the guide wire to the target site. Once<br>
properly located, the outer sheath 521 is retracted, first allowing the thin film tube 501 to expand<br>
and longitudinally foreshorten to its unconstrained diameter. As previously described, this will<br>
allow the slots 502 (not shown) incised through the thin film tube 501 wall to substantially close<br>
and exclude blood flow to the vessel wall defects. The secondary sheath 523 may then be<br>
retracted, allowing the stent 507, and any other stents (not shown) to self-expand into the vessel<br>
wall (not shown). The radial pressure exerted by the stent 507 into the vessel wall anchors the<br>
stent 507 in place. As a result, the thin film tube 501 is further supported and anchored to the<br>
vessel wall.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the self-expanding stent may be replaced with a balloon<br>
expandable stent. Figure 6 is a longitudinal section view illustrating a medical device 600<br>
having a balloon expandable stent 607 for additional radial support according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The catheter 620 for restraining and delivering the medical device 600 having a balloon<br>
expandable stent 607 has three main components. Similar to the embodiment described<br>
above, the catheter 620 comprises an outer sheath 621 that serves to hold the thin film tube<br>
601 in the longitudinally stretched position. Coaxial to the outer sheath 621 is balloon catheter<br>
625 having a balloon 624 mounted thereto.<br><br>
The balloon catheter 625 is typical of most balloon catheters know in the art in that is<br>
has a relatively long and flexible tubular shaft defining one or more passages or lumens, and an<br>
inflatable balloon 624 attached near one end of the shaft. This end of the catheter where the<br>
balloon 624 is located is customarily referred to as the "distal" end, while the other end is called<br>
the "proximal" end. The balloon 624 is connected to one of the lumens extending through the<br>
shaft to selectively inflate and deflate the balloon 624. The other end of this inflation lumen<br>
leads to a hub coupling at the other end for connecting the shaft lumens to various equipment.<br>
Examples of this type of balloon catheter 625 are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,304,197, entitled<br>
"Balloons For Medical Devices And Fabrication Thereof," issued to Pinchuk et al. on Apr. 19,<br>
1994, and also in U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,615, entitled "Balloon Catheter For Angioplasty," issued to<br>
Johnson on Dec. 6, 1994, and are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Various materials for the balloon catheter 625 components are well known. For<br>
example, the balloon 624 material is preferably substantially inelastic, and as such it stretches a<br>
relatively small amount under pressures of up to 15 atmospheres or more. Different balloon 624<br>
materials may be used, including nylon, PEEK, polymer materials sold under the trade name<br>
Pebax or Plexar, polyethylene, HDPE, polyurethane, or a block copolymer thereof. Likewise,<br>
various materials may be used for the shaft components and strain relief, including for example<br>
all of the materials listed above, as well as others including metal such as a stainless steel<br>
hypotube for example. The hub may be made of a hard plastic, such as for example<br>
polycarbonate. Markers may be made of any suitably radiopaque material, metal, alloy, or<br>
combination of materials, including for example tungsten or platinum.<br>
The balloon expandable stent 607 is mounted or crimped in a low profile configuration<br>
to the balloon catheter 625 over the expansion balloon 624. As earlier described, the medical<br>
device 600 may have more than one stent for added radial support, i.e. may have stent 607 and<br>
609 (not shown), and possible others, as earlier described. In each case, each balloon 624 or<br>
balloons 624, on the balloon catheter 625 may serve to hold and deliver each radially<br>
expandable stent in the constrained position.<br>
The third component of the medical device 600 is an inner lumen 622. The inner lumen<br>
622 is substantially coaxial to the outer sheath 621 and the balloon catheter 625, and provides a<br>
conduit for a guide wire. In a preferred embodiment, the inner lumen 622 is an integral part of<br><br>
the balloon catheter 625. Alternatively, the catheter 620 may be a loop or similar capture device<br>
along the distal end to accept the guide wire in a monorail fashion. Monorail type catheters are<br>
known in the art.<br>
The thin film tube 601 is preferably affixed to the stent 607 at anchor point 608. As<br>
earlier described, attachment may be by any suitable attachment means, including adhesion<br>
resulting from radial pressure of the stent 607 against the thin metallic film tube 601, adhesion<br>
by means of a binder, heat, or chemical bond, and/or adhesion by mechanical means, such as<br>
welding or suturing between the stent 607 and the thin metallic film tube 601.<br>
To be deployed, the medical device 600 is mounted on the balloon cathater 625. A<br>
guide wire (not shown) is steered to the target area through well know means, and the balloon<br>
catheter 625/medical device 600 is loaded onto the guide wire using inner lumen 622. The<br>
catheter 625/medical device 500 is then pushed over the guide wire to the target site. Once<br>
properly located, the outer sheath 621 is retracted, first allowing the thin film tube 601 to expand<br>
and longitudinally foreshorten to its unconstrained diameter. As previously described, this will<br>
allow the slots 602 (not shown) incised through the thin film tube 601 wall to substantially close<br>
and exclude blood flow to the vessel wall defects. The balloon 624 is then inflated (expanded),<br>
expanding the stent 607, and any other stents (not shown) into the vessel wall (not shown). The<br>
radial pressure exerted by the stent 607 into the vessel wall anchors the stent 607 in place. As<br>
a result, the thin film tube 601 is further supported and anchored to the vessel wall.<br>
While a number of variations of the invention have been shown and described in detail,<br>
other modifications and methods of use contemplated within the scope of this invention will be<br>
readily apparent to those of skill in the art based upon this disclosure. It is contemplated that<br>
various combinations or sub combinations of the specific embodiments may be made and still<br>
fall within the scope of the invention. Moreover, all assemblies described are believed useful<br>
when modified to treat other vessels or lumens in the body, in particular other regions of the<br>
body where fluid flow in a body vessel or lumen needs to be excluded or regulated. This may<br>
include, for example, the coronary, vascular, non-vascular and peripheral vessels and ducts.<br>
Accordingly, it should be understood that various applications, modifications and substitutions<br>
may be made of equivalents without departing from the spirit of the invention or the scope of the<br>
following claims.<br><br>
