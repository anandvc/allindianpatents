DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
While the concepts of the present disclosure are susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific exemplary embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the disclosure to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all<br><br>
WO 2006/020211	PCT/US2005/025411<br>
-3-<br>
modifications, equivalents, and alternatives following within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a catalytic converter 10 is configured for treating emissions present in exhaust gas discharged from an engine (not shown) or other exhaust gas producer. Converter 10 is used, for example, to convert CO to CO2, HC to H2O, and NOX to nitrogen.<br>
Converter 10 comprises a housing 12, first and second catalyzed substrates 14, 16, a tubular heat shield 18, and an oxygen sensor 20. Catalyzed substrates 14, 16 are configured to treat the emissions in the exhaust gas. Each catalyzed substrate 14, 16 comprises a substrate that is made of, for example, a ceramic material such as cordierite and is coated with a catalyst such as platinum, palladium, and/or rhodium. Substrate 14 is secured in a tubular first side portion 22 of an outer tube 24 of housing 12 by use of, for example, a first support mat 26 positioned between substrate 14 and first side portion 22 and made of intumescent or fiberglass material. Substrate 16 is secured in a tubular second side portion 28 of outer tube 24 by use of, for example, a second support mat 30 positioned between substrate 16 and second side portion 28 and made of intumescent or fiberglass material. Heat shield 18 is positioned in a tubular intermediate portion 32 of outer tube 24 around a longitudinal axis 34 of outer tube 24 to inhibit transfer of heat from exhaust gas present in intermediate portion 32 to intermediate portion 32. Oxygen sensor 20 is secured to intermediate portion 32 by use of, for example, a sensor mount 36 welded to intermediate portion 32 to sense the oxygen content of exhaust gas present between substrates 14, 16.<br>
Each of side portions 22, 28 has a diameter smaller than a diameter of intermediate portion 32. The diameter of each of side portions 22, 28 is reduced during assembly of converter 10 to secure substrates 14, 16 in side portions 22, 28.<br><br>
WO 2006/020211	PCT/US2005/025411<br>
-4-<br>
End caps 38 are secured to side portions 22, 28. Together, outer rube 34 and end caps 38 provide housing 12. Illustratively, end caps 38 are welded to outer tube 24. It is within the scope of this disclosure for one or both of end caps 38 to be formed as a one-piece construction with outer tube 34.<br>
i	Referring to Figs. 1-3, heat shield 18 comprises an inner tube 40 and a<br>
tubular insulation layer 42 positioned between inner tube 40 and intermediate portion. It is within the scope of this disclosure for layer 42 to be omitted from heat shield 18, as shown, for example, in Fig. 4.<br>
Inner tube 40 comprises a tubular main body 44, a plurality (e.g., three) of standoffs 46, and opposite end portions 48, as shown, for example, in Figs. 1 and 2. Standoffs 46 extend radially outwardly from main body 44 to intermediate portion 32 and are secured to intermediate portion 32 by, for example, spot-welding. End portions 48 taper radially inwardly from main body 44 to accommodate the difference in diameter between intermediate portion 32 and first and second side portions 22, 28. An aperture 50 defined in main body 44 receives sensor mount 36 to facilitate sensing of oxygen by oxygen sensor 20.<br>
During assembly of converter 10 with heat shield 18, the diameter of side portions 22, 28 is initially the same as the diameter of intermediate portion 32. As such, outer tube 24 is initially cylindrical and has no welds.<br>
Heat shield 18 is inserted through one of side portions 22, 28 into intermediate portion 32 and secured to intermediate portion 32. When heat shield 18 includes insulation layer 42, insulation layer 42 is positioned on inner tube 40 before heat shield 18 is inserted into intermediate portion 32. Standoffs 46 are spot-welded to intermediate portion 32 to secure heat shield 18 in place.<br><br>
WO 2006/020211	PCT/US2005/025411<br>
-5-<br>
Catalyzed substrates 14, 16 are inserted into side portions 22, 28. First catalyzed substrate 14 is inserted into first side portion 22 and second catalyzed substrate 16 is inserted into second side portion 28.<br>
Each side portion 22, 28 is swaged or otherwise deformed radially inwardly as indicated by arrows 52 from an initial undeformed position shown in phantom in Fig. 1 to a deformed position shown in solid in Fig. 1 to reduce the diameter of each side portion 22, 28. Such diameter reduction of side portions 22, 28 compresses support mats 26, 30 against substrates 14, 16 to hold substrates 14, 16 in place in side portions 22, 28. The diameter of each of side portions 22, 28 may be reduced in this manner after insertion of heat shield 18 into intermediate portion 32. In other cases, the diameter of one of side portions 22, 28 may be reduced before insertion of heat shield 18 into intermediate portion 32 and the diameter of the other side portion 22, 28 may be reduced after insertion of heat shield 18 into intermediate portion 32.<br>
Sensor mount 36 may be secured to intermediate portion 32 and oxygen sensor 20 may be secured to mount 36 before or after reduction of the diameter of side portions 22, 28.<br>
Referring to Figs. 5-7, converter 10 comprises a heat shield 118 in place of heat shield 18. Heat shield 118 is secured to outer tube 24 in a manner different from the way heat shield 18 is secured to outer tube 24. In particular, heat shield 118 is secured to outer tube 24 as a result of reduction of the diameter of side portions 22, 28.<br>
Heat shield 118 comprises an inner tube 140 and a tubular insulation layer 142 positioned between inner rube 140 and intermediate portion 32. Inner tube 140 comprises a main body 144 and opposite first and second end portions 148a, 148b. Side portions 22, 28 engage opposite end portions 148a, 148b and deform them<br><br>
WO 2006/020211	PCT/US2005/025411<br>

radially inwardly to establish a mechanical lock between first side portion 22 and first end portion 148a and a mechanical lock between second side portion 28 and second end portion 148b as a result of reducing the diameter of side portions 22, 28. As such, inner tube 140 is secured to outer tube 24 without any welds.<br>
It is to be understood that, as used herein, terms such as "tube," "tubular," "diameter," "cylindrical," and the like implicate a variety of cross-sectional shapes. Such cross-sectional shapes include, for example, a circular cross-sectional shape, an oval cross-sectional shape, a rectangular cross-sectional shape, and other closed curve cross-sectional shapes.<br>
While the concepts of the present disclosure have been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, such an illustration and description is to be considered as exemplary and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only the illustrative embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the disclosure are desired to be protected.<br>
