				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The field of the invention relates to the preparation of highly pure Donepezil or its salts in high yields.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Donepezil of Formula I, is a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of mild to moderate cases of Alzheimer's diseases and is chemically known as l-benzyl-4-[(5,6-dimethoxy-1 -indanon)-2-ylidenyl] methylpiperidine.<br>
(Figure-Removed) <br>
MeO<br>
Donepezil was first disclosed in US Patent 4,895,841. Thereafter, several processes for the preparation of Donepezil and its salts have published. In US patent 4,895,841, 5,6-dimethoxy-l-indanone is condensed with l-benzylpiperidine-4-carboxaldehyde in the presence of strong base, such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) to prepare a indanonylidenyl compound of Formula II, which on reduction in the presence of palladium on carbon in tetrahydrofuran yield Donepezil.<br>
There are significant drawbacks to this method as the catalytic hydrogenation of the indanonylidenyl compound of Formula II<br><br>
(Figure-Removed) <br>
to the corresponding compound of Formula I, results in the debenzylation leading in the formation of following impurity of Formula III, in substantial amounts,<br><br>
(Figure-Removed)  <br>
which is difficult to remove. This above impurity is further carried into Donepezil hydrochloride. The generation of significant quantity of debenzylated product during hydrogenation makes the process uneconomical. In the exemplified process given in US Patent 4,895,841, column chromatography is utilized to purify the product which is not amenable on industrial scale.<br>
Japanese Patent Application No.JP-A-H11-171861 discloses the preparation of indanoylidenyl compound of formula II by the aldol condensation of 5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone with l-benzylpiperidine-4-carboxaldehyde in the presence of alkali-metal alkoxide such as sodium methoxide.<br>
PCT Publication WO 97/22584 discloses preparation of Donepezil hydrochloride by reacting pyridine-4-aldehyde with malonic acid. The resulting 3-(pyridin-4-yl)-2-propionic acid was reduced with rhodium on carbon under hydrogen atmosphere to give 3-(piperidin-4-yl)-2-propionic acid which on reaction with methyl chlorocarbonate gave 3-[N-(methoxycarbonyl)piperidin-4-yl]propionic acid. On reacting 3-[N-(methoxycarbonyl) piperidin-4-yl] propionic acid with oxalyl chloride, methyl 4-(2-chlorocarbonylethyl) piperidin-1-carboxylate is obtained which on reaction with 1,2-dimethoxy benzene in the presence of aluminum chloride afforded 4-[3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-oxopropyl]piperidin-l-carboxylate. On reacting 4-[3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-oxopropyl] piperidin-1-carboxylate with tetramethyl diamino methane, 4-[2-(3,4-dimethoxy benzoyl) allyl] piperidin-1-carboxylate is<br>
obtained which on treatment with sulphuric acid gave methyl 4-(5,6-dimethoxy-l-indanon-2-yl methyl )piperidin-l-carboxylate. On decarboxylation of 4-(5,6-dimethoxy-l-indanon-2-yl methyl) piperidin-1-carboxylate gave 5,6-dimethoxy-2-(piperidin-4-yl methyl)-1-indanone which on treatment with benzyl bromide afforded Donepezil hydrochloride.<br>
US Patent 5,606,064 discloses another process for the preparation of Donepezil, which involves reacting 5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone and pyridine-4-carboxaldehyde to yield 5,6 dimethoxy-2-(pyridin-4-yl)-methylene-indan-l-one, which upon treatment with benzyl bromide followed by reduction yields the required compound. US Patent 6,492,522 discloses an alternative process for the preparation of Donepezil hydrochloride which comprises the steps of carrying out the intramolecular cyclization of N-benzyl-2-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-3-(4-piperidine)propionic acid of Formula IV,<br>
(Figure-Removed) <br><br>
to yield crude Donepezil and isolating the pure Donepezil by chromatography or crystallization.<br>
US Patent 6,252,081 discloses an additional process for production of Donepezil hydrochloride which involves the reaction of Donepezil intermediate of Formula V,<br>
(Figure-Removed) <br>
with halogenated benzyl to obtain a quaternary ammonium salt, hydrogenation of the quaternary ammonium salt to produce Donepezil base, followed by hydrohalogenation to produce Donepezil hydrochloride.<br><br>
The prior art processes employs reaction of l-benzylpiperidine-4-carboxaldehyde with 5,6-dimethoxy-l-indanone involves use of lithium diisopropylamide. Lithium diisopropylamide is toxic and needs to be carefully handled. Use of oxalyl chloride chemistry is difficult for scale up. Besides the oxalyl reaction also involves many protection deprotection chemistry and the overall yield is very low. Raw materials like methyl chlorocarbonate or tetramethyl diaminomethyl are expensive and difficult to source commercially.<br>
In view of the above, the prior art processes are time consuming and difficult to carry out as they involve many steps. Most of the prior art approaches are not suitable from commercial point of view because the desired product is not obtained in high purity and requires purification by tedious and cumbersome purification processes.The inventors have observed that during the condensation reaction of 5,6-dimethoxy-l-indanone of Formula-VI,<br>
(Figure-Removed) <br><br>
with l-benzylpiperidine-4-carboxaldehyde of Formula-VII,<br>
(Figure-Removed) <br>
for the preparation of indanonylidenyl compound of Formula II<br><br>
(Figure-Removed)  <br>
formation of a hydroxyl impurity of compound of Formula VIII,<br>
(Figure-Removed)  <br><br><br>
occurs upto 20%. The amount of impurity formation varies depending upon reaction conditions, amount of solvent, nature of solvent used. It is advantageous to remove hydroxyl impurity at this stage; otherwise it converts to indanonylidenyl compound of Formula II during preparation of Donepezil hydrochloride in the presence of hydrochloric acid, hence difficult to remove. An additional step of hydrogenation is required. Further hydrogenation is required to reduce the double bond, which is an additional step leading to increase in cost As discussed above, the inventors have further found that during hydrogenation of indanonylidenyl compound of Formula II in the presence of palladium catalyst debenzylation occurs to the extent of 10%.. Once the debenzylated product is formed in reaction mixture it is difficult to remove. An additional step of benzylation is required to convert the debenzylated product to desired compound. To achieve a high efficiency of the reaction for industrial<br><br>
synthesis of Donepezil, it is necessary to minimize the formation of the impurities and improve the yields.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides an efficient and industrially advantageous process for the preparation of highly pure Donepezil hydrochloride in high yields.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The instant invention relates to an improved, efficient and industrially advantageous process for the preparation of highly pure Donepezil of Formula-1 or salt thereof.<br>
According to an embodiment, there is provided a process for the preparation of indanonylidenyl compound of Formula-II in high purity and better yields by the condensation of 5,6-dimethoxy-l-indanone of Formula-VI,<br><br>
(Figure-Removed) <br>
and l-benzylpiperidine-4-carboxaldehyde of Formula-VII,<br>
(Figure-Removed)<br>
in the presence of alkali metal alkoxide in a solvent. Specifically the reaction is conducted at 30 -65°C in methanol and it takes about 2-7 hours for completion of<br>
reaction. The indanonylidenyl compound of Formula-II may be further purified by several ways such as by using acid base treatment; by protecting deprotecting hydroxyl group, to remove the hydroxyl impurity of Formula VIII, by converting<br><br>
(Figure-Removed) <br>
compound of formula VIII into indanonylidenyl compound of Formula II.<br>
Generally, the crude indanonylidenyl compound of Formula-II, having hydroxy impurity is treated with organic or inorganic acid in the presence of solvent such as ethers, alcohols, ketones, hydrocarbons, polar aprotic solvents. Specifically the compound of Formula-II is treated with methanolic-hydrochloric acid in methanol. After work up, pure hydrochloride of indanonylidenyl compound of Formula-II is isolated, which is then basified to get pure indanonylideny compound of Formula II. Alternatively the hydroxy impurity of Formula VIII can be removed by converting hydroxy compound of formula VIII to compound of Formula IX by protecting the hydroxyl group with suitable hydroxyl protecting group, and in situ converting compound of Formula IX to compound of Formula II by dehydration using conventional methods. The protecting hydroxy group for the compound of Formula-IX can be selected from acetates, benzoates, sulfonates and the like which are prepared by using suitable reagents known in prior art.<br><br><br>
In one specific embodiment of the present invention sulfonates derivatives of Formula IX are prepared. Sufonates can be methanesulfonate, 4-toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate and the like. The compound of Formula VIII may be treated with sulfonyl chloride in the presence of an organic base and a solvent. The solvent comprises one or more of ethers, alcohols, chlorinated hydrocarbons, esters, ketones, hydrocarbons, polar aprotic solvents. It is advantageous to remove impurity of Formula VIII before carrying out hydrogenation; otherwise it would carry forward. During hydrochloride preparation of Donepezil it is converting to compound of Formula II on dehydration, in the presence of hydrochloric acid. It is very difficult to remove indanonylidenyl compound of Formula-II from Donepezil hydrochloride and further hydrogenation is required to reduce the double bond, which is an additional step leading to increase in cost.<br>
After purification, the indanonylidenyl compound of Formula II is isolated in high purity greater than 98.5% preferably greater than 99.8%.<br>
According to another embodiment, there is provided a process for the preparation of Donepezil of Formula I which includes hydrogenating indanonylidenyl compound of<br>
Formula-II, in the presence of platinum catalyst to produce and isolating the substantially pure Donepezil or a salt thereof. Specifically hydrogenation of indanonylidenyl compound of Formula II is carried out using platinum catalyst in an organic solvent at 0-50°C preferably at 25-40°C under 1-5 atmospheric pressure preferably at 4 atmospheric pressure. The organic solvent can be selected from solvent comprises one or more of ethers, alcohols, chlorinated hydrocarbons, esters, ketones, hydrocarbons, polar aprotic solvents, water and mixtures thereof and preferably ethyl acetate is used. We have carried out same reactions using palladium catalyst also and found that using palladium catalyst, impurity of Formula III is formed in substantial amount depending upon reaction time. The examples have been provided as comparative examples. Platinum catalysts are mild in nature therefore debenzylation is not observed using platinum catalysts. Platinum catalyst can be selected from platinum oxide, platinum on carbon and preferably platinum on carbon is used. The reaction can be accomplished at 0-50°C and preferably at 25-35°C. The progress of the reaction is monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the reaction is stirred till the starting material i.e. compound of Formula II remains less than 0.15%, the reaction mixture is filtered to recover the catalyst. The filtrate is concentrated and crude Donepezil is dissolved in organic solvent. The organic solvent is selected from methylene chloride, ethyl acetate and preferably methylene chloride is used. The reaction mixture is treated with a solution of hydrochloric acid in ethyl acetate to obtain Donepezil hydrochloride.<br>
The resulting mixture is concentrated and the product obtained is recrystallized from methanol and isopropyl ether to obtain highly pure Donepezil hydrochloride having purity greater than 99.5% preferably greater than 99.8%.<br>
Major advantages realized in the present invention are high purity and high yields. The formation of impurity of Formula-Ill has been restricted by making use of<br>
platinum catalyst This avoids the use of tedious and cumbersome technique i.e. chromatographic purification, and additional step of benzylation of compound of Formula-Ill. The hydroxy impurity of Formula VIII is removed by acid base treatment or protection/ deprotection technique.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples which are provided merely to be exemplary of the inventions and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Certain modifications and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
