				<td>AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROLLER AND AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL METHOD,<br>
AND RADIO COMMUNICATIONS APPARATUS<br>
EQUIPPED WITH AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL FUNCTION<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to automatic gain contrni that makes const&amp;nt the output signal level via gain control using the closed loop, and in particular to an autonarig gain controller end an automatic gain control mathod wherein autoiT-atic gain concrol of a plurality or input signals is performed and to radio communications apparatus equipped with the automatic gain control function.<br>
Conventionally, in some types of signal processors, for exanple radio coirjtiunicetions apparatus, autoir.atic gain control is performed in order to make constant che variation in the signal level of a received signal caused by variation of receiving field strength in a radio propagation path such as a radio circuit and to reduce demodulation errors. As such gain control signal systems are known an open loop control signal hereby the gain of a variable gain amplifier in the subsequent: stage is controlled via an aurtomatic gain control signal generated by detecting the Level variation in an input signal, and a clcsec loop control system whereby the gain of a variable jain amplifier in the preceding stage is controlled via the automatic gair. control sianal.<br><br>
Fig. 11 shows an exanple of configuration cf an autorriatic gain controller according to the related ^rt applied.to rhe receiving system of radio communications apparatus. The "autonatic gain controller is composed of a variable gain ) amplifier 111, a demodulator 112, an A/D converter 113, a level detector 114, a gain control signal generator 115, and a D/A Converter 116.<br>
In the automatic gain controller according to the relatea art, a received signal.input Ri is amplified by the variable gain amplifier 111, demodulated by the demodulator 112, and converted to a digital value by the A/D converter 113, then output as a demodula-ed oucput Rd- Part of the demodulated output P.d is level-detected by the level detector 114 and captured by an automatic gain control loop, to generate an gain control signal via the gain control signal generator 115 based on the value of the demodulated output Rd. This automatic gain control signal is converted to an analoij voltage by the 0/A converter 116 and fed back to the control input end of the variable gain amplifier 111 as a gain control voltage and undergoes automatic gain control via the closed loop.<br>
In the gain ccn-rol sig;^al generator 115, the value of the demodulated output Rd (ouEput value) level-detected by the level detector 114 is averaged by an averaging section 121 for a certain lime, and the difference from a predetermined rarcet value A is calculated in a convergence difference calcuiiting<br><br>
auuer ^z^. in a ±oop gam control multiplier 123, the loop gain, control valu^ 3 in the automatic g5j.n contrailer is multiplied in a loop gain control multiplier 123 and se.it to .en adder iZ*;. In the adder 124, the previ&amp;us value latched by a latch circuit 125 is added to the variation amount output from the loop gain control multiplier 123 and the resulting value is sent to an operating section 126 via the latch circuit 12 5. The adder 124 and the latch circuit 125 composes an integration circuit and an integration value is latched by the Istch circuit with the tirr.ing of a latch timing centre! value D. In the operating section 126, the integrating value is converted to data corresponding to the control voltage of the variable gain am.plifier 111 and fed back to the control input end of the variable gain amplifier 111 as a gain control vol "cage. This realises automatic gain control so that the output level of the variable gain amplifier ill (output value of the level detector 114) may converge to a target value A.<br>
Some types of radio communications apparatus that performs automatic gain control as mentioned earlier have receivers oi a plurality of systems. In the related err, automatic gain ccntjroHers were provided as many as the number of receiving systems to correspond to receivers. That is, automatic gain controllers as shown in Fig. 11 wers provided as many as the number of receiving systems and auromaric gain control was individually performed In each receiver*" In<br><br>
particular, it was necessary to provide an automatic gain controller for each receiver in order to obtain the optimum automatic gain control performance depending on the operating status in each receiving system.<br>
In radio communications apparatus according to the related art having aforementicnsd receivers cf a plurality of systems, as many automatic gain controllers as the number of receiving systems are provided. Thus, a plurality of automatic gein controllers were always operating, which causes a problem that t.he circuit scale and power consumoticn were increased.<br>
1<br>
Power consumption of a circuit increases in proportion to the number of systems even if the automatic gain controller is^ configured by way of software design . Even if a single automatic gain control loop was used in comnon among a plurali-y of receiving Systems in order tc reduce power consumption, it was impossible to fully correct variations in the circuit characEeristics such as che temperature characteristics and. frequency characteristics of a variable gain amplifier of each system, thus the optimum automatic gain control performance was not obtained. In particular, in an unstable system state such as "he nower en or intermitiient data reception, or in a bad receiving state, i.e., when variation in the receiving level is large or fading has taken place, high-accuracy automauic gain conurol IS required. In the configuration according to the relared art, a proper gain ccn-rol signal is not obtc*ined<br><br>
and desired automatic gain control cannon "oe  perforzied.<br>

Functional configuration inside the control secrion 19 is shown in Fig. 2 . The control section 19 comprises a variation amount decision circuit 51 for determining whether the variation amount Vad* vbd in the detected output detected by the variation amount detector 20 has reached a predeterminea value and a control circuit SO for generating an on/off signal for performing on/off switching of the gain control signal generator 15a, 15b-tha inter-control-loop correction sections 17o, l7b and a comparator 27, based on the decision results of the variation amount decision circuit 51 and the comparison result output cf the comparator 27,<br>
Next, Operation of the automatic gain controller according to the first embodiment will be described wich reference tc. Figs. 1-3. Input.signals ?.II, Rr2 to the systems are respectively amplified by the variable gain am.pii tiers 11a, lib, demodulated by the dem-odulators 12a, 12b, converted tc digital signals by the A/D-converters 13a, 13b, and output as demodulated outputs RDl, RD2 ,  The dem.odulaced outputs rlDi,<br><br>
RD2 are respectively detected by the level detectors I4a, 14b and the detected outputs Va, Vb are sent to the variation amount detecror 20. The variation amount detector 20 detects the variation anounts V&amp;d, Vbd in the detected outputs Va, vb, and -he detection results are output to the control section IS as the variation amounts Vad, Vbd in the detected output.<br>
According to Fig. 3, the control section 19 compares the variation am.ounts Vad, Vbd in the detected output with a pcedeteriviined thresholdKl u^ed in the variation amount decision circuit 51 in step 511. In step 311, m case the variation amount in the input signals RIl, RI2 is small and either the variation amount Vad or vbd in the detected output is smaller than the preset threshold Kl (Vad or Vbd 
Next, the comparator 21 compares between the detected outputs Va, Vb of the level detectors 145, 14b in step S13. The control section 19 per forms operation switching as mentioned below when the comparison result shows that Vb is larger than Va IVa 
 <br>
system b as tha highest level control loop and places in the ON state (operating state) the gain control signal generator 15b and ths inter-cont^roL-loop correction section 17b of system b, and sets the control signs! selector switch 18b in the contact fB position. This allovfs the gain-control signal generated by the gain control signal generator 15b to be supplied to the control input end of the variable gain amplifier lib via the D/A converter 15b and the control loop of system b undergoes the optimunn automatic gain control via this gain control signal. The control section 19 deterraines systema as a ncn-highesr level control loop and places in the OFF state (non-operating state] the gain control signal generator 15a and the inter-control-loop correction section 17a of systera a, and sets the control signal selector switch ISa in the contact a position. This allows the correction gain control signal generated by the inter-control-loop correction section 17b to be suppliea to the control input end of the variable gain amplifier lis via the D/A converter 1.6a and the control loop of system a undergoes autorr.atic gain control via this correction gain control signal, for system a as the non-highest level control loop, Che variable gain amplifier 11a is controlled by a correction gain control signal with variations in the circuit characteristics such as the teir.perature characteristics and frequency characteri-stics of the circuit of systerr. a corrected by zhe  inter-control-loop correction section 17b, based om-tha<br><br>
gain control signal genexared by the gain control signal generator 15b of system b selected as.the hig"hest level control loop. This allows the optinaum automatic gain control to be performed.<br>
In seep S13, the control section 19 performs operation switching as mentioned below when the comparison result in step S13 shows that Va is larger than or equal to Vb (Va ^ Vb"i . That is, the control section selects system a as che highest level control loop and places in the ON state (operating state) the gain control signal generator l5a and the inter-contrcl-loop corrsction section 17a of system a, and sets the coniirol signal selector switch 19a in the contact [i position. This allows the gain control signal generated by the gain control signal generator 15a to be supplied to the control input end of zhB variable gain amplifier 11a via the D/A converter 16a and the contrcl loop of system a undergoes the optimum automatic gain control via this gain control signal-<br>
Thecon:;rol section 19 determines syscerc.b as a non-highest level control loop and places in the OFF state (non-operating stace) the gain control signal generator 15b and Che inter-control-loop correcLion section 17b of systemb, and sens rhe control signal selector switch 13b in the contact a position. This allows uhe correction gain control signal generated by che Lncer-ccr.trol-Loop correction section 17a tc be supcl-ied to the control input enc or the variable gam amplifier lib<br><br>
via t^e D/A converter 16h. For the cantrol loop of system, b, Che veriabls gain a^-nplifisr lib is controlled by a correction gain control signal with variations in the circuit; characteristics such as the temperature characteristics and frequency characteristics of the circuit of systen b corrected by the inter-control-ioop correction section 17a/ based on the gain contrcl signal generated by the gain control, signal generator 15a of systeiti a selected as the highest level control loop. This allows the cptimun automatic gain control to be performed-<br>
In step Sll/ in case the variation amount in the input<br>
signals RIl, R12 is large and both of the variation amount Vad<br>
and Vbd in the detected output are larger than or equal to the<br>
preset threshold Kl (Vad and Vbd 5. Kll, operation switching<br>
is made in the following way in step 516. The control section<br>
turns ON the gain control signal generators 15a, 15b and turns<br>
OFF the comparator 27 and the inter-control-loop correction<br>
sections 17a, I7b as well as sets the control signal selector<br>
switches 18a, iSb in the contact [3 position. This is for example<br>
a case where the tecsiving field strength is siaall or variation<br>
is large and the receiving state is unstable.^ In such a case,<br>
the variation arr,oL:ncs Vad, Vbd in the detected output are large .<br>
Autoraatic gain control is performed individually in aach control<br>
loop ana the opti?nuri -: torr.atic gain control is executed in each<br>
svstem.	*•<br><br>
As mentioned earlier, in che first emiDodime_it, in cass the variation amount in the detected, output"/ that is, in case Tihe input signal level is sff.all and the level is stable and automatic gain control characteristics are-nor impaired by the use of an approximate gain control signal, a control loop where the output signal level is the highest is selected and autcraatic gain control is performed using the gain control signal in the highesr-levei control loop. For the other control loops, a correction gain control signal containing correcz:ion of variations in circuit characteristics in each con-rol loop is generated based on the gam control signal to perform automatic gain control. This allows each control system to performproper automatic gain control via a gain control signal that supports variations in the circuit characteristics such as the temperature characteristics and frequency characteristics of the variable gain amplifier. In this case, operation of the gain control signal generators in the control loops other than the highest level control loop is turned OFF so than power consumption can be reduced if the control loop circuit is configured via hardware electronics. In case the control loop circuit is configured via the MPU (microprocessor unit) or DSP (digital signal processor) and operated via software programning, both the processing nime and the power cons"umption are reduced.<br>
In case automatic cam control is oarformed with the<br><br>
control loop where the input signal level is the highest is selected, no excessive signals are input to-the other control loops that are not selected. This avoids the disadvantage that the A/D converter ir. the subsequent stage of the variable gain amplifier is saturated.<br>
On the other hand, in case variation amount in the detected output, that is, in ca.se the input signal level is large and the level is unstable thus high-accuracy automatic gain control IS required, a gain comirol signal is generated in each control loop and automatic gain control is performed individually. This executes the opti^num high-accuracy automatic gain control in each control system.<br>
In the second to fifth einoodiiuents that follow, examples are shown where operation of the control section 19 according to the first errLbodiment is modified, since the configuration of the automatic gain controller is the same as that of the first enLOodiir.ent, the corresponding description is not given.

&gt;7Gxt, operation of the automatic gain controller according to tr-e second embodiment will be described. In the second embodinent, inter-loop correction of the gain control signal is not laade but a gain, control signal is generated in each control loop to perform individual automatic gain control in the state w"nere the automatic gain controller is powered (initial state!, that is, in a certain period during systGm startup from -he non-operating state to the operating state, and control m the first embodiment is performed when the certain period has elapsed.<br>
when the automatic gain centroiJ.er is powered and started, automatic gain control is started via a gain control signal so that the presec initial valua or conversion value is approached while counting of the predetermined time tl (sec.) is soar"ed via che timer circuit 52.  The concroi secnc^n 19<br><br>
determxries whether the predeterained time tl (sec.) has elapsed fro:ti when the power is turned on, based on the outpu- from the timer circuit 52 ir. step 521.<br>
when the predetsrr.inad time tl (sec. ) has not yet elapsed frora when the power" Is turned on in step S21, the auoomatic gain controller places in the ON state (operating sta"e; the gain control signal generators 15a, 15b and places in the OFF state (non-operating state) the inter-control-loop correction sections 17a, i7b end the comparator 27 as well es sets the concrol signal selector switches ISa^ 18b in the contact p posinion, in step S22 . This allows each control loop to perform individual automatic gain control and proper automatic gain control is ei".ecuted in each control system.<br>
When ths predetermined time tl (sec.) has elapsed froiTi when the power is turned on, the autom.atic gain controller perfor^is automatic gain control operation in the steady state, that is, automatic gain control operation in the first embodiment in step S23 . In this case, switching is made between the control vie the gain control signal in each control loop and the control via the gain control signal in the highest level control loop and jhe correction gala control signal in the non-highest leve L control loops, depending on the raagnitude of the variation amounts Vad, Vbd in the detected output.<br>
The entire control section 19 may be configured via the M?U [microprocessor unit) or DSP (digital signal processor]<br><br>

This executes the optimum high-accuracy automatic gain control in each control system. [Third eiRbodiment]<br>

Next, operation of the automatic gain controller according to the third eiubodiment will be described. In the third embodiment;, inter-loop correction of the gain control signal is not made but a gain control signal is generated ::.n each control loop to perform individual automatic gain control ir. case variation amount in the detected output is large in the state where the automatic gain controller Is powered (initial state), that is, during system startup from the non-operating state to the operating state, and control in the first enitaodiaent is performed when the variation amount in the detected output has fallen within a predeter.T.ined level.<br>
When the automatic gain contro Her is powered and started, automatic gain control is started via a gain con-rol Siignal<br><br>
so thar the preset iniriai value or conversion value is approached and the operation start variation amoant decision circuit 53 determines whether the variation amounts Vad. Vbd have converged to a ,pr"Sds4;e"rmined level K2 (for example K2 &gt; Kl) in step S31.<br>
In case the variation amouncs Vad, vbd in the detected output are equal to or larger than the predetermined level K2 (Vad or Vbd ^ K2) in step S3l, the automatic gain controller places in the ON state (operating state) the-gain control signal generators 15a, 15b and places in the OFF state (non-operating state) the inter-control-loop correction sections 17a, l7b and the comparator 27 as well as sets the control signal selector switches 18a/ 18i&gt; in the contact (3 pcsiTiion, in step S32. This allows each control loop tc perform individual automatic gain control and proper automatic gain control is executed in each control syste^L.<br>
In case the variation amounts Vad, Vbd in the deuected output are smaller than the predetermined level K2 {Vad and Vbd 
 <br>
control loops, depending on cheir.agnitude of the variation amou:;^ Vsd, Vbd in zhe detected output.<br>

Fig. S is-"a ■■f-iowdi^.art-showing tiie processing procedure concerning automatic gain control according to Lhe fourth embodimenr. The fourth embodiment is an example of the case where the automatic gain controller performs intermitrent operation . This embodiment is preferable for a case where radio communications apparatus performs intermittent reception. Since the functional configuration of the control section 19 is alrr.ost the same as Chat of the second embodiment shown in Fig. 4, the corresponding description is not given.<br>
In the fourth em}?odiment, Intsr-loop correction of the gain control signal is not made but a gain control signal is generated in each control loop to perform individual automatic gain control ar the start of each, intermittent operation, that is, in a certain period during system, starrup from the non-operating state to the operating state for intermittent operation, and control in the first embodiment is perforned when the ceri:ain period has elapsed.<br>
When "he automatic gain controller starts intermittenc operation, automatic gain control is started via a gain concrol signal so rhat the preset initial value or conversion value is approached while counting of the predetermined rime t2 (sec . ) ifor e-xamole t2 
 <br>
control section 19 determines whether the predetermined tirne t2 (^p-c.) has elapsed fron when ths intermittent operatic^- "-^as started, based or, the output from the timer circuit 52 in step 341.<br>
Knen thd predetermined time t2 (sec.) has riot yet elapsed from when intermittent operation was started in step 41, the automatic gain controller places in the ON state (operating state) the gain control signal generators 15a, 15b and places in the OFF state (non-operating state) the inter-concrol-loop correction sections 17a, I7b and the comparator 27 as well as sets the control signal selector switches 18a, 13b in the contact (3position, instep 34 2 . This allows each control loop ^Qperform individual automatic gain control and proper automatic gain control is executed in each control system.<br>
When the predetermined time t2 (sec.) has elapsed from when the internitten:: operation was started, the automatic gain controller performs autom.atic gain control operation in the steady state, that is, automatic gain control operation in the first embodiment in step S4. In uhis case, switching is nade between the control via the gain control signal in each control loop and the control via the gain control signal in the highest level control loop and the correcrion gain control signal in the non-highesc level control loops, depending on the magnitude of the variation amounts Vad, Vbd in the detected output.<br>
The time when the system, is unstable is generally shcrter<br><br>
in t!ie internittent operation tnan at power-on. By setting the timer se- value t2 for intermittent operation so tha-t t2-. is smaller than the ti~er set value tl of the tinier s-arred at power-on, it is possible to quickly shift to automatic gair-control in the steady state.<br>
In this way, in the fourth embodixenc, in a certain period during systen startup from the non-operating state to the operating stata for intarmitcent operation by the automatic gain controller, that is, in an unstable state where a large variation amount in the input signal level for incer-Tiittent operation is expected and high-accuracy automatic gain control is required, selective control is not made where operation of the control loops other than the control loop that obtains the maximum detected output is turnad OfF to perforra inter-control-loop correction but a gain control signal is generated in each control loop in a fixed way to perform individual automatic gain controi . This executes the optimu.^ high-sccuracy automatic gain control m each control system. [Fifth embodiment]<br>

The fifth embodiment is an example of the case "where the automatic gain ccnuroller performs intermitteni; operation. This embodiment; is preferable for a case where radio comnunicaticns apparatus performs intarmittent reception.<br><br>
Since the functional configuration of the control section 19 is almost the same as that of the third esabodinent shown in Fig. 5, the corresponding description is not given.<br>
In the fifth erritaodiment, inter-loop correction o^ the gsin control signal is not ir.ade but a gsin control signal is generated in e^ch control loop to perform individual automatic gain control at the start of each intermittent operation, that is, during system startup from the non-operating state to rhe operating si;ate for antermitten^ operation, and control in the first en±iodiir_ent is performed when the variation smounc in the detected output has fallen within a predetermined level.<br>
When the automatic gain controller starts intermittent operation, a^Jton-Latic gain control is started via a gain control signal so that the preset initial value or conversion value is approached and the operation start variation amount decision circuit 53 determines whether the variation amounts Vad, Vod have converged to a predetermined level K3 (for exanple K3 &gt; Kl) in step S51.<br>
In case the variation amounts Vad, Vt&gt;d in the detected output are equal to or larger than the predetermined level K3 (Vad or Vbd ^ K3) in step 351, the automatic gain controller places in the OX state (operating state) the gain control signal generators 15a, 15b and places in the OFF state (non-operating state) the inter-control-loop correction sections 17a, 17b and the comparator 27 as well as sets the control signal selkector<br><br>

the radio cormnunications apparatus is composed of receivers of aplurality of systems (two systems in this ex^i^plel . The radio communications apparatus comprises antennas 71s, lib, an antenna multiplexer 72, bar.d-pass filter (BPTj used in the RF band (radio frequency band) 73a, 73b, low-noise aziplifiars 74a, 74b, down-mixers for frequency-converting signals in the KT band to signals in the IF [interrriediate frequency) band, band-pass filters (EPr"s) 763, 76b used in the IF band, an autorr.atic gain control circuit (AGC) 77, a frequency synthesizer 78, a receiver (RFC) 79 for outputting received signals in the form of voice data, a transceiver controller 80 for perfarming control of each section, a transmitter circuit 31 for processing send signals, a key input section [KEY) 82 for performing a variety of operations, amicrophone (MIC) 83 for inputting \"oice data as a send signal, and a battery (BATT) 84 for supplying power to each section. The automatic gain control circuit 77 formed control loops at the receivers of the systems used, as shown in the first embodiment in Fig. 1.<br>
Operation of the radio communications apparatus will be described. When radio signals (assume for example signals in the 2-GHz band) are received via antennas 7ia, 7ib, the receivec<br>

The received signals that passed throi:gh the band-pass filters V3a, 73b are respectively arr.pli^ied by the low~noise amplifiers 74a, 74b and frequency-converted by to signals in the IF band (for example 330 [MHz] band) by the down.-tTiiy.ers 75a, 75b, then input to the automatic gain control circuit 77 via the band-pass filters "^69, 76b, iri one system<br>
The received signals are demodulated by a demodulator provided in the automatic gain, con-crol circuit 77 aad output to the transceiver controller 80 as baseband signals anduridergo signal processing, "n this practice, processing explained in the aforem.entioned first through fifth embodinients is performed in the control loops of the systems in the aiitoiri.atic gain concrol circuit 77 . A generated gain control signal or correction gain control signal is supplied to a variable gain amplifisr for preferable automatic gain control.<br>
In case the receiving field strength is stable and variation in the received signal level is small thus receiving characteristics are not impaired by the use of an approximate gain control signal, a control loop where the output signal level is The highest is selected and auromatic gain control is performed using the gain control signal ir. the highest-level control loop. For the other control loops, a correctiomgain<br><br>

This allows each control system to perform proper automatic gain control via a gain control signal that supports variations in the circuit characteristics such as the temperature characteristics and frequency characteristics of the variable gain ampllfiej:. In this case, operation of th.§ gain control signal generators in the control loops other than rhe highest level control loop is turned OFF so that power cons"omption can be reduced. In this case, control is always raade by selecting a control loop where the received signal level is the highest, no excessive signals are input to the other control loops that are not selected, This avoids the disadvantage that the A/E converter in the subsequent stage of the variable gain ajnplif ier is saturated.<br>

a variation aimount deteccor which detects the variation amount of the output signal level;<br>
a level comparator which compares the output signal levels of the pluraliity of system with each other;<br>
a inter-control-loop correction section which generates a correction gain control signal that corrects variations in the circuit characteristics of the other control loops and that is based on a gain control signal in the control loop where the output signal level is the highest in order to perform gain control; and<br>
a operation controller which selects the control loop where the output signal level is the highest, places the gain control signal generator for the other control loops in the non-operatir.g state, end performs gain control of the variable gain amplitiers of the plurality of systems via the gain control signal in the control loop where the output signal level is the highest and correction gain control signals in the other control loops, in case the variation ancunt in the output signal<br><br>
level is smaller than a predetermined value.<br>
