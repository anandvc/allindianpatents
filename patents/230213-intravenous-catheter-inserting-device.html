				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an intravenous catheter inserting<br>
device, more particularly to an intravenous catheter inserting<br>
device which enables a needle cannula to be retracted within a<br>
plunger cavity having a reduced pressure therein.<br>
Intravenous catheter inserting devices are generally used to<br>
administer medication fluid into or draw blood from a patient's<br>
vein. Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a conventional intravenous<br>
catheter inserting device 1 is shown to include a tubular needle<br>
seat 11 with a hub end 111, a needle cannula 12 secured to the<br>
hub end 111, a catheter hub 13 sleeved on the needle seat 11,<br>
and a flexible tubular catheter 14 secured to the catheter hub<br>
13 . In use, the catheter 14 and the needle cannula 12 are inserted<br>
into the patient's vein by a health care worker by piercing the<br>
patient's vein with a sharp tip of the needle cannula 12 which<br>
projects outwardly of the catheter 14. The health care worker<br>
then withdraws the needle cannula 12 from the catheter 14 with<br>
one hand and, at the same time, applies pressure to the patient' s<br>
skin with the other hand, thereby leaving the catheter 14 in the<br>
patient's vein. Subsequently, a transfusion member (not shown)<br>
with medication fluid or an empty barrel is connected to the<br>
catheter hub 13 for administering the medication fluid into the<br>
patient's vein or for drawing blood. At this time, as the health<br>
care worker must place the used needle cannula 12 and the needle<br>
seat 11 on a tray (not shown) nearby, the exposed sharp tip of<br>
the used needle cannula 12 may create a danger of an accidental<br>
needle stick. Moreover, blood contamination may occur during<br><br>
connection of the catheter hub 13 to the transfusion member or<br>
the empty barrel.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, during the insertion procedure, the flow<br>
of blood into the catheter 14 through a notch 121 in the needle<br>
cannula 12 can be observed through the translucent catheter 14.<br>
However, due to the presence of the notch 121, the needle cannula<br>
12 tends to be bent during passage of the catheter 14 into the<br>
patient's vein. In addition, the blood in the catheter 14 is not<br>
visible when the portion of the needle cannula 12 with the notch<br>
121 is inserted into the patient's vein.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
intravenous catheter inserting device which can prevent<br>
accidental, inadvertent contact with a needle cannula after use,<br>
and which can prevent contamination of that was drawn with the<br>
use of the same.<br>
According to this invention, the intravenous catheter<br>
inserting device includes a catheter hub, a tubular catheter,<br>
a barrel, a needle cannula, a tubular needle seat, and a plunger.<br>
The catheter hub includes a surrounding tip wall which<br>
surrounds a first axis and which confines a through hole, a sleeve<br>
wall which has an inner sleeve wall surface that confines an insert<br>
hole larger than the through hole, and an intermediate tubular<br>
wall which is interposed between the surrounding tip wall and<br>
the sleeve wall, which confines a duct communicating the insert<br>
hole with the through hole, and which has a communicating port<br>
to communicate the duct with ambient air.<br>
The tubular catheter includes a proximate segment which is<br><br>
disposed in the through hole and which extends along the first<br>
axis to communicate with the duct, and a distal segment which<br>
extends from the proximate segment along the first axis to project<br>
outwardly of the surrounding tip wall.<br>
The barrel has outer and inner surrounding barrel wall surfaces<br>
opposite to each other and surrounding a second axis. The inner<br>
surrounding barrel wall surface confines a passage which has<br>
opposite open forward and rearward ends, and includes a<br>
larger-diameter segment and a smaller-diameter segment that<br>
confine rear and front passageways, respectively, and that are<br>
disposed proximate to the open rearward and forward ends,<br>
respectively, to form a surrounding shoulder portion. The outer<br>
surrounding barrel wall surface has a front surrounding region<br>
which is secured relative to the inner sleeve wall surface,<br>
thereby resulting in coincidence of the first axis with the second<br>
axis.<br>
The needle cannula includes opposite tip and fixed ends and<br>
a middle segment interposed therebetween.<br>
The tubular needle seat is received in the passage, and extends<br>
along the second axis. The tubular needle seat includes a hub<br>
end which is disposed to secure the fixed end, a surrounding<br>
engaged wall which extends from the hub end along the second axis<br>
and which confines an axial path to accommodate or communicate<br>
with the fixed end, and an anchoring segment which confines an<br>
axial through hole to communicate with the passage and which<br>
extends outwardly of the front passageway from the surrounding<br>
engaged wall. The surrounding engaged wall has an outer engaged<br><br>
wall surface which engages the smaller-diameter segment and which<br>
is rotatable relative to the smaller-diameter segment about the<br>
second axis between interengaged and released positions, where<br>
the surrounding engaged wall is respectively immovable and<br>
movable relative to the smaller-diameter segment along the second<br>
axis, respectively. The anchoring segment terminates at an<br>
anchoring end which is rotated with the surrounding engaged wall.<br>
As such, when the surrounding engaged wall is turned in a clockwise<br>
direction from the interengaged position to the released position,<br>
the anchoring end can move from a hook-up position that is closer<br>
to the surrounding shoulder portion, to a depressed position that<br>
is remote from the surrounding shoulder portion.<br>
The plunger is received in the passage such that in a use<br>
position, the plunger is movable along the larger-diameter<br>
segment, and such that in a disposal position, the plunger is<br>
unmovable along but is rotatable relative to the larger-diameter<br>
segment. The plunger includes a plunger body and a seal member.<br>
The plunger body includes a top end wall disposed to confront<br>
the surrounding shoulder portion, and a bottom end wall extending<br>
outwardly of the open rearward end to permit movement and rotation<br>
of the plunger. The top end wall has an inner peripheral edge<br>
portion which surrounds the second axis, and which defines a<br>
cavity therein. The cavity extends along the second axis and<br>
towards the bottom end wall, and contains fluid at a reduced<br>
pressure.<br>
The seal member includes an anchored portion and a sealing<br>
portion. The anchored portion is disposed to be engageable with<br><br>
the anchoring end such that when the plunger is in the disposal<br>
position, and when the surrounding engaged wall is in the<br>
interengaged position, rotation of the plunger body in a clockwise<br>
direction relative to the larger-diameter segment brings the<br>
surrounding engaged wall to turn from the interengaged position<br>
to the released position, thereby moving the anchoring end from<br>
the hook-up position to the depressed position. The sealing<br>
portion is sealingly attached to the inner peripheral edge portion<br>
along a sealing line so as to trap the fluid in the cavity. Movement<br>
of the anchoring end from the hook-up position to the depressed<br>
position results in depression of the anchored portion so as to<br>
rip the sealing line, thereby releasing the seal member from the<br>
plunger body. Hence, the tubular needle seat together with the<br>
needle cannula can be pulled by the seal member which is suctioned<br>
into the cavity due to a pressure difference between the reduced<br>
pressure and the ambient air that is introduced through the<br>
communicating port, thereby permitting retraction of the needle<br>
cannula from the tubular catheter into the cavity.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention will<br>

it should be noted that same reference numerals have been used<br>
to denote like elements throughout the specification.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, the first preferred embodiment<br>
of an intravenous catheter inserting device according to the<br>
present invention is shown to comprise a catheter hub 5, a tubular<br>
catheter 6, a barrel 2, a needle assembly 3, and a plunger 4.<br>
The catheter hub 5 includes a surrounding tip wall 512, a<br>
sleeve wall 511 which is opposite to the surrounding tip wall<br>
512 along a first axis, and an intermediate tubular wall 51 which<br>
is interposed between the surrounding tip wall 512 and the sleeve<br>
wall 511.<br>
The surrounding tip wall 512 surrounds the first axis, and<br>
confines a through hole 516 which extends along the first axis.<br>
The sleeve wall 511 has an inner sleeve wall surface which<br>
surrounds the first axis and which confines an insert hole 517<br>
larger than the through hole 516. The intermediate tubular wall<br>
51 has an inner tubular wall surface that confines a duct 513<br>
which communicates the insert hole 517 with the through hole 516,<br>
and an outer tubular wall surface opposite to the inner tubular<br>
wall surface in radial directions. In addition, the intermediate<br>
tubular wall 51 has a communicating port 514 which extends<br>
radially through the inner and outer tubular wall surfaces to<br>
communicate the duct 513 with ambient air. A plug 52 is disposed<br>
to close the communicating port 514, as shown in Fig. 4 . The inner<br><br>
tubular wall surface of the intermediate tubular wall 51 forms<br>
a retaining shoulder 518 with the surrounding tip wall 512. The<br>
retaining shoulder 518 confronts the duct 513 along the first<br>
axis.<br>
The tubular catheter 6 includes a proximate segment 61 which<br>
is disposed in the through hole 516 and which extends along the<br>
first axis to communicate with the duct 517 and to project<br>
outwardly of the through hole 516, and a distal segment 62 which<br>
extends from the proximate segment 61 along the first axis to<br>
project outwardly of the surrounding tip wall 512. The proximate<br>
segment 61 terminates at a flange portion 611 which abuts against<br>
and which is retained at the retaining shoulder 518.<br>
The barrel 2 has outer and inner surrounding barrel wall<br>
surfaces 221,222 opposite to each other and surrounding a second<br>
axis. The inner surrounding barrel wall surface 222 confines a<br>
passage 21 which has open forward and rearward ends 223,224 that<br>
are disposed opposite to each other in a longitudinal direction<br>
parallel to the second axis, and includes a larger-diameter<br>
segment 212 and a smaller-diameter segment 211 which confine rear<br>
and front passageways, respectively, and which are disposed<br>
proximate to the open rearward and forward ends 224,223,<br>
respectively, to form a surrounding shoulder portion 213 between<br>
the larger-diameter segment 212 and the smaller-diameter segment<br>
211. The outer surrounding barrel wall surface 221 has a front<br>
surrounding region 2211 which is proximate to the open forward<br>
end 223, and which is insertable into the insert hole 517 so as<br>
to abut against the inner sleeve wall surface of the sleeve wall<br><br>
511, thereby resulting in coincidence of the first axis with the<br>
second axis. A first female screw thread segment 225 includes<br>
a plurality of angularly displaced ribs, and is disposed on the<br>
larger-diameter segment 212 adjacent to the open rearward end<br>
224. A second female screw thread segment 226 in the form of a<br>
spiral groove is disposed on the smaller-diameter segment 211<br>
adjacent to the surrounding shoulder portion 213.<br>
The needle assembly 3 includes a needle cannula 32 and a tubular<br>
needle seat 31.<br>
The needle cannula 32 includes tip and fixed ends 321,322<br>
opposite to each other, and a middle segment 323 interposed<br>
between the tip and fixed ends 321,322.<br>
The tubular needle seat 31 is made of a light transmissible<br>
material, is received in the passage 21, and extends along the<br>
second axis. The tubular needle seat 31 includes a hub end 313<br>
which is disposed to secure the fixed end 322 of the needle cannula<br>
32, and a surrounding engaged wall 311 which extends from the<br>
hub end 313 along the second axis, and which confines an axial<br>
path to accommodate or communicate with the fixed end 322 of the<br>
needle cannula 32. The surrounding engaged wall 311 has an outer<br>
engaged wall surface which is provided with a (second) male screw<br>
thread segment 314 that includes a plurality of angularly<br>
displaced ribs and that surrounds the second axis to threadedly<br>
engage the second female screw thread segment 226 in an<br>
interengaged position, whereby the surrounding engaged wall 311<br>
of the tubular needle seat 31 is unmovable relative to the<br>
smaller-diameter segment 211 along the second axis.<br><br>
The tubular needle seat 31 further includes an anchoring<br>
segment 312 which confines an axial through hole 3121 to<br>
communicate with the passage 21, and which extends outwardly of<br>
the front passageway of the smaller-diameter segment 211 from<br>
the surrounding engaged wall 311 to terminate at an anchoring<br>
end 3122. A (third) male screw thread segment 315 includes a<br>
plurality of ribs and is disposed on the anchoring end 3122.<br>
The plunger 4 is received in the passage 21 such that in a use<br>
position, as shown in Fig. 4, the plunger 4 is movable along the<br>
larger-diameter segment 212 in the longitudinal direction, and<br>
such that in a disposal position, as shown in Fig. 5, the plunger<br>
4 is immovable along, but is rotatable relative to the<br>
larger-diameter segment 212. The plunger 4 includes a plunger<br>
body 42 and a seal member 43.<br>
The plunger body 42 includes a top end wall 421 which is disposed<br>
to confront the surrounding shoulder portion 213, and a bottom<br>
end wall 422 opposite to the top end wall 421 in the longitudinal<br>
direction. The bottom end wall 422 extends outwardly of the open<br>
rearward end 224 to permit movement and rotation of the plunger<br>
4. The top end wall 421 has an inner peripheral edge portion 424<br>
which surrounds the second axis, and which defines a cavity 41<br>
therein. The cavity 41 extends along the second axis and towards<br>
the bottom end wall 422, and contains fluid at a reduced pressure.<br>
In addition, the plunger body 42 has an outer plunger wall surface<br>
423 which surrounds the second axis. A first male screw thread<br>
segment 425 includes a plurality of ribs, and is disposed on the<br>
outer plunger wall surface 423 . A catcher portion 426 is disposed<br><br>
on the inner peripheral edge portion 424 proximate to the bottom<br>
end wall 422.<br>
The seal member 43 is formed from an elastomeric material, and<br>
includes an anchored portion 432 and a sealing portion 434. The<br>
anchored portion 432 has an inner surrounding wall which extends<br>
along the second axis to confine a recess 431 that is configured<br>
to accommodate and to be engageable with the anchoring end 3122<br>
of the anchoring segment 312 . The inner surrounding wall is formed<br>
with a third female screw thread segment 433 that is in the form<br>
of a spiral groove. Referring to Fig. 4, a surrounding protrusion<br>
4241 is disposed to extend from the inner peripheral edge portion<br>
424 in a radial direction and towards the second axis so as to<br>
be in frictional contact with the sealing portion 434, thereby-<br>
establishing a sealing line to trap the fluid in the cavity 41.<br>
In use, as shown in Fig. 4, a health care worker holds the barrel<br>
2 with one hand to insert the tip end 321 of the needle cannula<br>
32 and the distal segment 62 of the tubular catheter 6 into the<br>
patient's vein. The anchoring segment 312 of the tubular needle<br>
seat 31 is light transmissible and has a convex surface 316 to<br>
provide a magnified view of the blood flowing through the axial<br>
through hole 3121. Once the health care worker notes that the<br>
blood does not flow into the anchoring segment 312, he/she can<br>
pull the plunger 4 slightly rearward to draw the blood until the<br>
blood is visible through the anchoring segment 312 so as to confirm<br>
correct insertion of the tubular catheter 6 into the patient's<br>
vein.<br>
Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, the plug 52 shown in Fig. 4 is removed<br><br>
from the communicating port 514 so as to communicate the duct<br>
513 with the ambient air. The plunger 4 is pressed forwardly to<br>
contact the tubular needle seat 31 (see Fig. 5) . By means of the<br>
first male and female screw thread segments 425, 225, displacement<br>
of the plunger 4 along the larger-diameter segment 212 is<br>
restrained, whereas rotation of the plunger 4 in a clockwise<br>
direction relative to the larger-diameter segment 212 is<br>
permitted. The plunger 4 is screwed toward the open forward end<br>
223. By the screw movement of the plunger 4, the seal member 43<br>
is rotated relative to the tubular needle seat 31, and the anchored<br>
portion 432 of the seal member 43 is brought to engage the<br>
anchoring end 3122 by virtue of the engagement of the third male<br>
and female screw thread segments 315,433, as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Thus, the tubular needle seat 31 is rotatable together with the<br>
seal member 43.<br>
Subsequently, as shown in Fig. 7, when the plunger 4 is further<br>
rotated in the clockwise direction relative to the larger-<br>
diameter segment 212 such that the tubular needle seat 31 is<br>
rotated to turn the second male screw thread segment 314 about<br>
the second axis to a released position for removal from the second<br>
female screw thread segment 226, the surrounding engaged wall<br>
311 of the tubular needle seat 31 is moved relative to the<br>
smaller-diameter segment 211 along the second axis towards the<br>
open rearward end 224. The anchoring end 3122 is also rotated<br>
to move from a hook-up position that is closer to the surrounding<br>
shoulder portion 213 to a depressed position that is remote from<br>
the surrounding shoulder portion 213. At the same time, movement<br><br>
of the anchoring end 3122 from the hook-up position to the<br>
depressed position will result in depression of the anchored<br>
portion 432 so as to rip the sealing line, thereby releasing the<br>
seal member 43 from the plunger body 42. As such, the tubular<br>
needle seat 31 together with the needle cannula 32 can be pulled<br>
by the seal member 43 that is suctioned into the cavity 41 due<br>
to the pressure difference between the reduced pressure and the<br>
ambient air that is introduced through the communicating port<br>
514, thereby permitting retraction of the needle cannula 32 from<br>
the tubular catheter 6 into the cavity 41, as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
Furthermore, by means of the catcher portion 426, the tubular<br>
needle seat 31 as well as the needle cannula 32 can be prevented<br>
from impinging upon the bottom end wall 422.<br>
Therefore, in use, the health care worker can close the<br>
communicating port 514 with the plug 52, and then pull the plunger<br>
body 42, in which the seal member 43 and the needle assembly 3<br>
are left, towards the open rearward end 224 so as to draw a smaller<br>
amount of blood into the passage 21 of the barrel 2 through the<br>
tubular catheter 6. Referring to Fig. 9, when the health care<br>
worker needs to draw a larger amount of blood, a blood collecting<br>
member 7 is connected to the catheter hub 5. The blood collecting<br>
member 7 includes a surrounding wall 72 which confines a receiving<br>
space 71 and which has an introduced port 73 communicating with<br>
the receiving space 71. A first connecting flexible tube 81 is<br>
disposed to interconnect the introduced port 73 and the<br>
communicating port 514. The blood can flow into the blood<br>
collecting member 7 through the tubular catheter 6, the duct 513,<br><br>
and the first connecting flexible tube 81 without the need to<br>
pull the plunger body 42, thereby preventing the health care<br>
worker from coming into contact with the blood.<br>
Alternatively, referring to Fig. 10, the second preferred<br>
embodiment of the intravenous catheter inserting device<br>
according to this invention is shown to be similar to the previous<br>
embodiment in construction. In addition to the component parts<br>
of the previous embodiment, the inner sleeve wall surface of the<br>
sleeve wall 511 of the catheter hub 5 has a reentry port 515 which<br>
extends radially through the sleeve wall 511 to communicate with<br>
the insert hole 517, and which is opposite to the communicating<br>
port 514 relative to a boundary area 519. Moreover, the<br>
intravenous catheter inserting device of this embodiment further<br>
includes a barrier member 54 and a tubular insert 53 . The barrier<br>
member 54 is formed from an elastomeric material, such as a rubber.<br>
The tubular insert 53 has a front neck end 534 which is connected<br>
to the barrier member 54 and which confines a through way 531<br>
along the first axis, and a rear flared end 532 which extends<br>
from the front neck end 534 along the first axis, and which has<br>
an inner abutted surface 536. The inner abutted surface 536<br>
surrounds the first axis, and confines a fluid path 535 which<br>
extends to communicate with the reentry port 515. Furthermore,<br>
the blood collecting member 7 has an air outlet 74 spaced apart<br>
from the introduced port 73 . A second connecting flexible tube<br>
82 is disposed to interconnect the air outlet 74 and the reentry<br>
port 515. In assembly, the barrier member 54, on which the front<br>
neck end 534 is connected, is engaged with the inner sleeve wall<br><br>
surface of the sleeve wall 511 of the catheter hub 5 at the boundary-<br>
area 519. The front surrounding region 2211 of the barrel 2 is<br>
engaged with the inner abutted surface 536 of the tubular insert<br>
53, thereby aligning the through way 531 with the passage 21 of<br>
the barrel 2. The needle cannula 32 (not shown in Fig. 10) extends<br>
through the through way 531, a slit in the barrier member 54,<br>
the duct 513, and the tubular catheter 6. After the used needle<br>
assembly 3 (not shown in Fig. 10) has been retracted into the<br>
plunger body (not shown in Fig. 10) in the same manner as described<br>
above, the slit in the barrier member 54 is closed by means of<br>
its elastomeric material property.<br>
As such, due to the arrangement of the barrier member 54, once<br>
it is noted that blood cannot flow into the blood collecting member<br>
7, the health care worker can pull the plunger body 42 rearwardly<br>
so as to introduce an air flow from the air outlet 74 through<br>
the second connecting flexible tube 82, the reentry port 515,<br>
and the fluid path 535 to the passage 21 of the barrel 2, thereby<br>
facilitating blood flow into the blood collecting member 7.<br>
Alternatively, referring to Fig. 11, the third preferred<br>
embodiment of the intravenous catheter inserting device<br>
according to this invention is shown to be similar to the first<br>
preferred embodiment in construction. The duct 513 of the catheter<br>
hub 5 is communicated with the passage 21 of the barrel 2 through<br>
a tubular insert 55. The tubular insert 55 has a front neck end<br>
554 which is connected to a barrier member 54 and which confines<br>
a through way along the axis, and a rear flared end 552 which<br>
extends from the front neck end 554 along the first axis. The<br><br>
rear flared end 552 has an inner abutted surface which surrounds<br>
the first axis and which confines a fluid path 551, and a reentry<br>
port 555 which extends radially therethrough to communicate with<br>
the fluid path 551. The front surrounding region 2211 of the barrel<br>
2 engages the inner abutted surface of the tubular insert 55.<br>
As such, in the same manner as that of the second preferred<br>
embodiment, after the used needle assembly 3 has been retracted<br>
into the plunger body 42, the slit in the barrier member 54 is<br>
closed by means of its elastomeric material property.<br>
Referring to Figs. 12 and 13, the fourth preferred embodiment<br>
of the intravenous catheter inserting device according to this<br>
invention is shown to include a barrel 9 which is shorter than<br>
that of the previous embodiments. The barrel 9 also has an inner<br>
surrounding barrel wall surface 936 which includes smaller-<br>
diameter and larger-diameter segments 91,92 and which confines<br>
a passage having open forward and rearward ends 931,932. The<br>
sleeve wall 511 of the catheter hub 5 is brought to engage the<br>
open forward end 931. The larger-diameter segment 92 has a male<br>
screw thread segment 935 so as to threadedly engage the female<br>
screw thread segment 425 formed on the outer plunger wall surface<br>
of the plunger 4. As such, in use, the health care worker can<br>
grasp the outer surrounding barrel wall surface 934 and insert<br>
the needle cannula 32, as well as the tubular catheter 6, into<br>
the patient's vein such that blood can flow into the barrel 9.<br>
Then, in the same manner described hereinabove, the needle cannula<br>
32 can be retracted into the cavity 41 of the plunger 4 for safe<br>
disposal.<br><br>
Furthermore, a tip protector 33 is disposed to shield the needle<br>
cannula 32 and the catheter hub 5, and has a larger open end 331<br>
for insertion of a front half portion of the barrel 9. A sleeve<br>
tube 34 is disposed to shield the plunger 4, and has an open end<br>
341 for insertion of a rear half portion of the barrel 9. Thus,<br>
the needle cannula 32 and the plunger 4 can be completely shielded<br>
by the tip protector 33 and the sleeve tube 34 so as to prevent<br>
the health care worker from coming into contact therewith.<br>
As illustrated, the intravenous catheter inserting device of<br>
this invention has the following advantages:<br>
1.	After insertion of the needle cannula 32, by rotating the<br>
plunger body 42 in the clockwise direction relative to the<br>
larger-diameter segment 212, the used needle assembly 3 can be<br>
retracted into the cavity 41 of the plunger body 42, thereby<br>
facilitating safe disposal of the intravenous catheter inserting<br>
device.<br>
2.	Since the anchoring segment 312 of the tubular needle seat<br>
31 is light-transmissible and has the convex surface 316, blood<br>
flowing through the axial through hole 3121 is visible to the<br>
health care worker in a magnified state.<br>
3.	After the used needle assembly 3 has been retracted into<br>
the cavity 41, the health care worker can directly pull the plunger<br>
body 42 for drawing blood into the passage 21 or the blood<br>
collecting member 7 without the need to remove the barrel 2 and<br>
the catheter hub 5, thereby reducing the possibility of the health<br>
care worker coming into contact with blood.<br><br>
