SCRATCH RESISTANT PROPYLENE POLYMER COMPOSITION<br>
This invention relates to propylene polymer compositions comprising a propylene polymer, a polyolefin elastomer and a low molecular weight polymer. This invention relates particularly to a propylene polymer composition comprising a propylene polymer, a substantially linear ethylene polymer or a linear ethylene polymer, and a low molecular weight polymer having improved processability with a<br>
good balance of stiffness and toughness which demonstrates improved scratch<br><br>
resistance in injection molded articles.<br>
Propylene polymers have been used in many applications in the form of molded articles, film, sheet, etc., because it is excellent in molding processability, toughness, moisture resistance, gasoline resistance, chemical resistance, has a low specific gravity, and is inexpensive. The use of propylene polymers is expanding at an increasing rate in the fields of exterior and interior automotive trims, in electrical and electrical equipment device housing and covers as well as other household and personal articles.<br>
However, polypropylene is poor or inadequate in heat resistance, stiffness, scratch resistance and impact resistance. These deficiencies are obstacles to opening up new applications for polypropylene, particularly applications which have traditionally been injection molded. In order to overcome these shortcomings, especially inadequate impact resistance, polypropylene has been blended with a rubbery elastic material such as ethylene-propylene copolymer rubber, ethylene-propylene-diene copolymer rubber or ethylene-butene copolymer rubber. For examples, see USP 5,391,618 which discloses low crystalline polypropylene polymer compositions comprising an ethylene alpha-olefin copolymer, USP 5,576,374 which discloses polypropylene polymer compositions comprising a substantially linear ethylene polymer and USP 5,639,829 which discloses propylene polymer compositions comprising an ethylene and 1-butene random copolymer. However, while impact properties are improved these propylene polymer compositions do not achieve a good balance of stiffness and toughness. USP 6,300,419 discloses blends of high crystalline propylene polymers with high levels of a substantially linear ethylene polymer or a linear ethylene polymer to achieve good scratch resistance.<br><br>
In view of the conventional propylene polymers and blends thereof, it would be highly desirable to provide a cost effective propylene polymer composition which exhibits improved processability with a good balance of stiffness and toughness which demonstrates improved scratch resistance in injection molded articles.<br>
The present invention is such a desirable propylene polymer composition. The composition possesses a desirable balance of good processability with a good balance of stiffness and impact strength and improved scratch resistance in injection molded articles.<br>

Component (a) in the propylene polymer composition of the present invention is a propylene polymer, preferably a high crystalline propylene polymer. The propylene polymer suitable for use in this invention is well known in the literature and can be prepared by known techniques. In general, the propylene polymer is in the isotactic form, although other forms can also be used (for example, syndiotactic or atactic). The propylene polymer used for the present invention is preferably a homopolymer of polypropylene or more preferably a copolymer, for example, a random or block copolymer, of propylene and an alpha-olefin, preferably a C2 or C4 to C2oalpha-olefin. The alpha-olefin is present in the propylene copolymer of the present invention in an amount of not more than 20 percent by mole, preferably not more than 15 percent, even more preferably not more than 10 percent and most preferably not more than 5 percent by mole.<br>
Examples of the C2 and C4 to C20 alpha-olefins for constituting the propylene and alpha-olefin copolymer include ethylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1-hexadodecene, 4-rnethy!-1 -pentene, 2-methyM-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 3,3-dimethyM-butene, diethyl-1-butene, trimethyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1 -pentene, ethyl-1 -pentene, propyl-1-pentene, dimethyl-1-pentene, methylethyl-1-pentene, diethyl-1-hexene, trimethyl-1-pentene, 3-methyl-1-hexene, dimethyl-1 -hexene, 3,5,5-trimethyM-hexene, methylethyl-1 -heptene, trimethyl-1-heptene, dimethyloctene, ethyl-1 -octene, methyl-1-nonene, vinylcyclopentene, vinylcyclohexene and vinylnorbornene, where alkyl branching position is not specified it is generally on position 3 or higher of the alkene.<br>
The propylene polymer of the present invention can be prepared by various processes, for example, in a single stage or multiple stages, by such polymerization method as slurry polymerization, gas phase polymerization, bulk polymerization,<br><br>
solution polymerization or a combination thereof using a metallocene catalyst or a so-called Ziegier-Natta catalyst, which usually is one comprising a solid transition metal component comprising titanium. Particularly a catalyst consisting of, as a transition metal/solid component, a solid composition of titanium trichcride which contains as essential components titanium, magnesium and a halogen; as an organometalic component an organoaluminum compound; and if desired an electron donor. Preferred electron donors are organic compounds containing a nitrogen atom, a phosphorous atom, a sulfur atom, a silicon atom or a boron atom, and preferred are silicon compounds, ester compounds or ether compounds containing these atoms.<br>
High crystallinity polypropylene is commonly made by catalytically reacting propylene in a polymerization reactor with appropriate molecular weight control agents. Nucleating agent is added after the reaction is completed in order to promote crystal formation. The polymerization catalyst should have high activity and be capable of generating highly tactic polymer. The reactor system must be capable of removing the heat of polymerization from the reaction mas:;, so the temperature and pressure of the reaction can be controlled appropriately.<br>
A good discussion of various polypropylene polymers is contained in Modern Plastics Encyclopedia/89, mid October 1988 Issue, Volume 65, Number 11, pp. 86-92. The molecular weight of the propylene polymer for use in the present invention is conveniently indicated using a melt flow measurement, sometimes referred to as melt flow rate (MFR) or melt index (Ml), according to ASTM D 1238 ai: 230°C and an applied load of 2.16 kilogram (kg). Melt flow rate is inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the polymer. Thus, the higher the molecular weight, the lower the melt flow rate, although the relationship is not linear. The melt flow rate for the propylene polymer useful herein is generally greater than 0.1 grams/10 minutes (g/10 min.), preferably greater than 0.5 g/10 min., more preferably greater than 1 g/10 min., and even more preferably greater than 10 g/10 min. The melt flow rate for the propylene polymer useful herein is generally less than 200 g/10 minM preferably less than 100 g/10 min., more preferably less than 75 g/10 min., and more preferably less than 50 g/10 min.<br>
The propylene polymer as component (a) may be characterized also by its crystalline structure.<br><br><br>
6<br><br><br>
related to the degree of crystallinity in weight percent based on the weight of the polypropylene sample by the following equation:<br><br>
where the heat of fusion for isotactic polypropylene (AHjSOtacticpp), as reported in B. Wunderlich, Macromolecular Physics, Volume 3, Crystal Melting, Academic Press, New Your, 1980, p 48, is 165 Joules per gram (J/g) of polymer.<br>
The degree of crystallinity for a high crystalline propylene polymer as determined by DSC is at least 54 weight percent, preferably at least 58 weight percent, more preferably at least 64 weight percent, even more preferably at least 68 weight percent and most preferably at least 70 weight percent based on the weight of the high crystalline propylene polymer. The degree of crystallinity for a high crystalline propylene polymer as determined by DSC is less than or equal to 100 weight percent, preferably less than or equal to 90 weight percent, more preferably less than or eqtial to 80 weight percent, and most preferably less than or equal to 75 weight percerit based on the weight of the high crystalline propylene polymer.<br>
Part or all of the pfepylene polymer of the present invention may be graft modified. A preferred grafft modification of the polypropylene is achieved with any unsaturated organic comjfdund containing, in addition to at least one ethylenic unsaturation (for example; at least one double bond), at least one carbonyl group (-C=0) and that will graft to a polypropylene as described above. Representative of unsaturated organic compounds that contain at least one carbonyl group are the carboxylic acids, anhydrides, esters and their salts, both metallic and nonmetallic. Preferably, the organic compound contains ethylenic unsaturation conjugated with a carbonyl group. Representative compounds include maleic, fumaric, acrylic, methacrylic, itaconic, crotonic, -methyl crotonic, and cinnamic acid and their anhydride, ester and salt derivatives, if any. Maleic anhydride is the preferred unsaturated organic compound containing at least one ethylenic unsaturation and at least one carbonyl group.<br>
The unsaturated organic compound containing at least one carbonyl group can be grafted to the polypropylene by any known technique, such as those taught<br><br>
in USP 3,236,917 and USP 5,194,509. For example, polymer is introduced into a two-roll mixer and mixed at a temperature of 60°C. The unsaturated organic compound is then added along with a free radical initiator, such as, for example, benzoyl peroxide, and the components are mixed at 30°C until the grafting is completed. Alternatively, the reaction temperature is higher, for example, 210°C to 300°C, and a free radical initiator is not used or is used at a reduced concentration. An alternative and preferred method of grafting is taught in USP 4,905,541 by using a twin-screw devolatilizing extruder as the mixing apparatus. The polypropylene and unsaturated organic compound are mixed and reacted within the extruder at temperatures at which the reactors are molten and in the presence of a free radical initiator. Preferably, the unsaturated organic compound is injected into a zone maintained under pressure in the extruder.<br>
The unsaturated organic compound content of the grafted polypropylene is at least 0.01 weight percent, preferably at least 0.1 weight percent, more preferably at least 0.5 weight percent, and most preferably at least 1 weight percent based on the combined weight of the polypropylene and organic compound. The maximum amount of unsaturated organic compound content can vary to convenience, but typically it does not exceed 10 weight percent, preferably it does not exceed 5 weight percent, more preferably it does not exceed 2 weight percent and most preferably it does not exceed 1 weight percent based on the combined weight of the polypropylene and the organic compound.<br>
The propylene polymer or graft-modified propylene polymer is employed in the propylene polymer blend compositions of the present invention in amounts sufficient to provide the desired processability and good balance of stiffness and toughness. If present, the graft-modified propylene polymer can be employed in an amount equal to 100 weight percent of the total weight of the propylene polymer, preferably in an amount up to or equal to 50 weight percent, more preferably up to or equal to 30 weight percent, even more preferably up to or equal to 20 weight percent and most preferably up to or equal to 10 weight percent of the weight of the propylene polymer. In general, the propylene polymer, graft-modified propylene polymer or mixture thereof is employed in an amount of at least 40 parts by weight, preferably at least 45 parts by weight, more preferably at least 50 parts by weight, even more preferably at least 55 parts by weight, and most preferably at least 60 parts by weight based on the weight of the total composition. In general, the<br><br>
propylene polymer, graft-modified propylene polymer or mixture thereof is used in amounts less than or equal to 95 parts by weight, preferably less than or equal to 90 parts by weight, more preferably less than or equal to 85 parts by weight, even more preferably less than or equal to 80 parts by weight, and most preferably less than or equal to 75 parts by weight based on the weight of the total composition.<br>
Component (b) in the compositions of this invention is a polyolefin elastomer. Suitable polyolefin elastomers comprises one or more C2to C2o alpha-olefins in polymerized form, having a glass transition temperature (Tg) less than 25°C, preferably less than 0°C, most preferably less than -25°C. Tg is the temperature or temperature range at which a polymeric material shows an abrupt change in its physical properties, including, for example, mechanical strength. Tg can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Examples of the types of polymers from which the present polyolefin elastomers are selected include copolymers of alpha-olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, ethylene and 1-butene, ethylene and 1-hexene or ethylene and 1-octene copolymers, and terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and a diene comonomer such as hexadiene or ethylidene norbornene.<br>
Preferably, the polyolefin elastomer is one or more substantially linear ethylene polymer or one or more linear ethylene polymer (S/LEP), or a mixture of one or more of each. Both substantially linear ethylene polymers and linear ethylene polymers are known. Substantially linear ethylene polymers and their method of preparation are fully described in USP 5,272,236 and USP 5,278,272. Linear ethylene polymers and their method of preparation are fully disclosed in USP 3,645,992; USP 4,937,299; USP 4,701,432; USP 4,937,301; USP 4,935,397; USP 5,055,438; EP 129,368; EP 260,999; and WO 90/07526.<br>
As used here, "a linear ethylene polymer" means a homopolymer of ethylene or a copolymer of ethylene and one or more alpha-olefin comonomers having a linear backbone (that is, no cross linking), no long-chain branching, a narrow molecular weight distribution and, for alpha-olefin copolymers, a narrow composition distribution. Further, as used here, "a substantially linear ethylene polymer" means a homopolymer of ethylene or a copolymer of ethylene and of one or more alpha-olefin comonomers having a linear backbone, a specific and limited amount of long-chain branching, a narrow molecular weight distribution and, for alpha-olefin copolymers, a narrow composition distribution.<br><br>
Short-chain branches in a linear copolymer arise from the pendent alkyl group resulting upon polymerization of intentionally added C3 to C20 alpha-olefin comonomers. Narrow composition distribution is also sometimes referred to as homogeneous short-chain branching. Narrow composition distribution and homogeneous short-chain branching refer to the fact that the alpha-olefin comonomer is randomly distributed within a given copolymer of ethylene and an alpha-olefin comonomer and virtually all of the copolymer molecules have the same ethylene to comonomer ratio. The narrowness of the composition distribution is indicated by the value of the Composition Distribution Branch Index (CDBI) or sometimes referred to as Short Chain Branch Distribution Index. CDBI is defined as the weight percent of the polymer molecules having a comonomer content within 50 percent of the median molar comonomer content. The CDBI is readily calculated, for example, by employing temperature rising elution fractionation, as described in Wild, Journal of Polymer Science, Polymer Physics Edition, Volume 20, page 441 (1982), or USP 4,798,081. The CDBI for the substantially linear ethylene copolymers and the linear ethylene copolymers in the present invention is greater than 30 percent, preferably greater than 50 percent, and more preferably greater than 90 percent.<br>
Long-chain branches in substantially linear ethylene polymers are polymer branches other than short chain branches. Typically, long chain branches are formed by insitu generation of an oligomejic alpha-olefin via beta-hydride elimination in a growing polymer chain. The resulting species is a relatively high molecular weight vinyl terminated hydrocarbon which upon polymerization yields a large pendent alkyl group. Long-chain branching may be further defined as hydrocarbon branches to a polymer backbone having a chain length greater than n minus 2 ("n-2") carbons, where n is the number of carbons of the largest alpha-olefin comonomer intentionally added to the reactor. Preferred long-chain branches in homopolymers of ethylene or copolymers of ethylene and one or more C3 to C2o alpha-olefin comonomers have at least from 20 carbons up to more preferably the number of carbons in the polymer backbone from which the branch is pendant. Long-chain branching may be distinguished using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy alone, or with gel permeation chromatography-laser light scattering (GPC-LALS) or a similar analytical technique. Substantially linear ethylene polymers contain at least 0.01 long-chain branches/1000 carbons and<br><br>
preferably 0.05 long-chain branches/1000 carbons. In general, substantially linear ethylene polymers contain less than or equal to 3 long-chain branches/1000 carbons and preferably less than or equal to 1 long-chain branch/1000 carbons.<br>
Preferred substantially linear ethylene polymers are prepared by using metallocene based catalysts capable of readily polymerizing high molecular weight alpha-olefin copolymers under the process conditions. As used here, copolymer means a polymer of two or more intentionally added comonomers, for example, such as might be prepared by polymerizing ethylene with at least one other C3 to C2o comonomer. Preferred linear ethylene polymers may be prepared in a similar manner using, for instance, metallocene or vanadium based catalyst under conditions that do not permit polymerization of monomers other than those intentionally added to the reactor. Other basic characteristics of substantially linear ethylene polymers or linear ethylene polymers include a low residuals content (th.?rt is, a low concentration therein of the catalyst used to prepare the polymer, unreacted comonomers and low molecular weight oligomers made during the course of the polymerization), and a controlled molecular architecture which provides good processability even though the molecular weight distribution is narrow relative to conventional olefin polymers.<br>
While the substantially linear ethylene polymers or the linear ethylene polymers used in the practice of this invention include substantially linear ethylene homopolymers or linear ethylene homopolymers, preferably the substantially linear ethylene polymers or the linear ethylene polymers comprise between 50 to 95 weight percent ethylene and 5 to 50, and preferably 10 to 25 weight percent of at least one alpha-olefin comonomer. The comonomer content in the substantially linear ethylene polymers or the linear ethylene polymers is generally calculated based on the amount added to the reactor and as can be measured using infrared spectroscopy according to ASTM D-2238, Method B. Typically, the substantially linear ethylene polymers or the linear ethylene polymers are copolymers of ethylene and one or more C3 to C2o alpha-olefins, preferably copolymers of ethylene and one or more C3 to C10, alpha-olefin comonomers and more preferably copolymers of ethylene and one or more comonomers selected from the group consisting of propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentane, and 1-octene. Most preferably the copolymers are ethylene and 1-octene copolymers.<br><br><br><br>
The substantially linear ethylene polymer or linear ethylene polymer is employed in the blend of the present invention in amounts sufficient to provide the desired balance of processability and impact resistance. In general, the substantially linear ethylene polymer or linear ethylene polymer is employed in amounts of at least 1 part by weight, preferably at least 2 parts by weight, more preferably at least 3 parts by weight, even more preferably at least 4 parts by weight and most preferably at least 5J parts by weight based on the weight of the total composition. In general, the substantially linear ethylene polymer or linear ethylene polymer is used in amounts less than or equal to 20 parts by weight, preferably less than or equal to 17 parts by weight, more preferably less than or equal to 15 parts by weight, even more preferably less than or equal to 12 parts by weight and most preferably less than or equal to 10 parts by weight based on the weight of the total composition.<br>
Component (c) of the present invention is a low molecular weight polymer (LMP). The low molecular weight polymer is not particularly limited, and any of known low molecular weight polymer can selectively be used. Preferable examples of low molecular weight polymers include animal and plant waxes, carnauba wax, candelilla wax, Japan wax, beeswax^mineral wax, petroleum wax, paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax, petrolactam wax, polyolefin wax, oxidized polyolefin wax, higher fatty acid wax, and higher fatty acid ester wax. Further, as a resin having the same properties as wax, a styrene oligomer, and an amorphous pciy-alpha-olefin are preferably used. These low molecular weight polymers may be used either singly or in combination.<br>
Preferred low molecular weight polyolefins, sometimes referred to as polyolefin waxes, comprise polyethylene wax or polypropylene wax or copolymers thereof such as polyethylene-propylerie wax, polyethylene-butylene wax, polyethylene-hexylene wax, and polyethylene-octylene wax. A particularly suitable polyolefinic wax is polyethylene wax. As used herein, the term polyolefin wax means a low molecular weight polyolefin having a molecular weight of from 500 to 70,000. These polyolefin waxes are well known to those skilled in the art and are available commercially.
