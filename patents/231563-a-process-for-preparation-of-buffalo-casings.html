				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of buffalo casings.<br>
India has nearly 50% of the world's buffalo population. It is a multipurpose animal and gives milk, meat and draught power. Various by-products are produced during buffalo slaughter. Intestine is one of the important by-products. Intestines can be converted into casings which are used as sausage containers. Casings prepared from the intestines of sheep, goat and cattle are exported from India to Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Germany etc. Buffalo intestines have no food value. At present, they are not properly utilized. Conversion of buffalo intestines into casings is a good approach for value addition and for earning foreign exchange revenues. The main problem with buffalo intestines is that there is a thick fatty layer (encapsulated in collagenous sheeth) adherent to one side of the intestine. There is no published information on the preparation and preservation of buffalo casings. The objective is to develop a process for preparation and preservation of buffalo casings at ambient temperature.<br>
Buffalo casings will have good potential in export market.<br>
Reference may be made to Kondaiah et al 1979 (Indian Food Packer, July-August, 1979, P.36-39) wherein the studies on the manufacturing techniques for sheep casings revealed that casings were cured with common salt (added upto saturation of the casings) for 3 days and further treatment of casings with 40% salt was found optimum for effective preservation of casings in plastic containers upto 120 days at room temperature. The draw backs in this are shorter shelf-life and possibilities for the growth of yeasts and moulds during storage period.<br>
Reference may be made to Madhwaraj et al 1980 (J.Food Science, 17, 273-275) wherein sheep casings were kept for 24 hrs in saturated salt solution containing lactic acid and sodium sorbate/benzoate and the shelf-life of casings packed in<br><br>
polyethelene bags and kept in plastic jars for 9 months at room temperature (25-30°C). The drawback in this technique is that the process is intended for sheep casings.<br>
Reference may be made to Manter, 1951 (Bulletin No.11, February, American Meat Institute Foundation, USA) wherein studies were conducted on the removal of excess fat from beef casings by the application of enzymes, surface active enzymes and solvent extraction. No satisfactory method was suggested for the removal of fat from beef casings.<br>
Reference may be made to Ockerman, 1996 (Animal Sciences Research Reviews, Special Circular 156, Natural Casings, Ohio State University, USA) wherein casings were prepared from beef intestines by curing with saturated salt solution and preserving with 40% salt. The draw back is that the technique was lengthy and laborious.<br>
However, no information is available in the literature on the preparation and preservation of buffalo casings at ambient temperature (26±2C°).<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation and preservation of buffalo casings.<br>
Another objective is to find a treatment to remove the adherent fat present on one side of the intestine.<br>
Yet another objective is to prevent spoilage for preserving the casings. Yet another objective is to improve the shelf-life of casings by lowering pH.<br>
Yet another objective is to inhibit the growth of yeasts and moulds during storage period.<br><br>
Yet another objective is to facilitate the use of buffalo casings for the preparation of sausage.<br>

excess water,<br>
h.       treating casings with a mixture containing common salt, vinegar and<br>
potassium sorbate (To 1 kg of casing 400 g of salt, 210 ml of vinegar<br>
and 15.9 g of potassium sorbate), i.         transferring the treated casings to a rigid plastic container (PVC) and<br>
stored at temperature (20-30°C) for 2-3 days, j.         packing and storing the treated casings    in polyethylene (high<br>
density) bags, at temperature (20-30°C) for 6-12 months.<br>

(Diagram Removed)<br>
The novelty of invention is (1) treatment with lime powder for facilitating the removal of fatty layer adherent to one side of the casing, (2) use of a combination of common salt (sodium chloride), vinegar and potassium sorbate for effective preservation of casings for longer periods at ambient temperature.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
De-fattening of buffalo intestines<br>
The approaches were adopted for of buffalo intestines. These are (1)physical and (2) chemical.<br>
1.	Physical treatment<br>
Physical technique involves the removal of fat layer manually by a blunt knife. (Fig.1) Two types of experiments were conducted. In one, the fat layer was removed from the intestine manually by blunt knife. In the second experiment, the intestines (after removal of ingesta) were kept in refrigerator (4 ± 1°C) over night and then, the fat layer was removed manually by a blunt knife. Time taken for the removal of fat was recorded (Table 1). Time taken for removal of fat from the unrefrigerated intestines varied from 55 to 70 minutes per intestine while it has taken 45 minutes in the case of refrigerated intestine. It was observed that during storage at low temperatures, fat became firm and could be removed easily from the intestine. However, refrigeration of intestines is expensive.<br>
2.	Chemical treatment<br>
Lime (Calcium oxide) has been selected to know whether it facilitates of buffalo intestine. In fact, Ca o is not a fat solvent per se. It is observed that fat is embedded in collagenous matrix (connective tissue) on the buffalo intestine surface. It may be mentioned that lime is used as a processing agent for skin and hide in order to remove the hairs. (Since the collagenous material is<br>
proteinceous in nature which encompasses fat, it was reasoned that Cao (lime) could loosen the collagenous tissue and facilitate easy removal of fat.<br>
The cleaned intestines were treated with lime powder. (Calcium oxide) using different concentrations (2%, 5% and 10%) on weight basis and mixed for uniform distribution of lime and then kept at ambient temperature (26 ± 2°C). Observations were made on the effect of different concentrations of lime on buffalo intestine (Table 2), Intestines treated with 10% lime were torn. Intestines treated with 2% lime took longer time (5 hours) for defattening than the time taken (3 hours) for defattening the intestines treated with 5% lime. Further studies were continued with 5% lime treatment. As intestine is highly perishable, it is essential to prefer to keep exposure time shorter. Experiments were conducted with 5% lime to look into the possibilities of facilitating the removal of adherent fat from buffalo intestines. Buffalo intestines were treated with 5% lime and kept at ambient temperature for 3 hours followed by manually by a blunt knife. It can be seen from the table 1 that it took 20-25 minutes for the removal of fat from one intestine. There results revealed that the treatment with 5% lime facilitated markedly the easy removal of fat layer from buffalo intestine and showed desired effect. Chemical composition presented in table 3 clearly indicates that 5% lime treatment for 3 hours helped very efficiently in removing the fat from the intestine.<br>

Example 2. Salting, Curing and Storage of Casing<br>
Dry Salting method was followed. Standardisation of salt level is important to determine the optimum level for preserving the casings at ambient temperature. Initially casings were treated with 30% and 40% common salt (sodium chloride), allowed for 3 days at (26 ± 2°C) and analysed for salt uptake (Tables4&amp;5). The salt uptake varied from 14.0 to 16.7% in casings treated with 30% salt while the salt uptake ranged from 22.6 to 23.0% in casings treated with 40% salt. These salted casings were preserved at (26 ± 2°C) and observed for off-odour development and discolorations. Off-odour development and discoloration were noticed during the 2nd month in casings treated with 30% salt indicating a shelf-life of 1 month. Casings treated with 40% salt were spoiled during 4th month and showed a shelf-life of 3 months. Subsequently, detailed studies were conducted on buffalo casings treated with 40% salt alone in dry form directly or salt with additives.<br>
pH is an important factor that has bearing on microbial growth and shelf-life of buffalo casings. pH profile of buffalo casings when treated with salt and in combination with vinegar and potassium sorbate and held for 3 days at ambient temperature is shown in tables6, 7 &amp; 8. In buffalo casings treated with salt, pH ranged from 6.3 to 6.9 before treatment and from 5.9 to 6.1 after treatment. In casings treated with salt and vinegar, pH ranged from 6.0 to 6.5 before treatment and from 3.5 to 4.0 after treatment. In casings treated with salt, vinegar and potassium sorbate, pH ranged from 6.2 to 6.6 before treatment and from 3.9 to 4.0 after treatment.<br><br>
Microbial quality of casings before and after salting (40%) and holding for 3 days at ambient temperature (26 ± 2°C) is shown in table 9. Total plate counts were reduced by 2.37 log/g; coliforms were eliminated; staphaureus was reduced by 1.24 log/g; halophilic count increased by 0.80 log/g; mesophilic anaerobic count reduced by 0.14 log/g and yeast and mould reduced by 0.55 log/g. These findings revealed low microbial profile and substantial reductions in salted casings held for 3 days at (26 ± 2°C). Treatments with (a) salt and vinegar and (b) salt, vinegar and potassium sorbate has further reduced the microbial counts (TableslO &amp; 11). This is mainly because of combined effect of salt and low pH. Storage studies were conducted on buffalo casings treated with (1) 40% salt, (2) 40% salt and vinegar (3) 40% salt, vinegar and potassium sorbate. Casings were evaluated at periodical intervals for pH, microbial and sensory profiles during storage at (26 ± 2°C).<br>
2. Casings treated with 40% salt<br>
pH decreased from 6.1 to 5.8 during the first month and then it was maintained upto 3rd month (Table 12). There was a sharp increase in pH from 5.9 to 6.5-7.0 in the 4th month. Microbial counts (log cfu/g) recorded during storage period are shown in Table 13. As indicated by mean ± S.D values, standard plate count decreased from 3.9 ± 0.56 to 3.1± 0.38; Staphylococcus aureus was not detected from 1st month; halophilic count increased from 4.0 ± 0.44 to 6.5 ±0.17; mesophilic anaerobic count remained constant; yeast and mould count decreased from 1.7 + 0.18 to 1.1 ± 0.11. Coliforms, Staphylococcus and salmonella were not detected. Spoilage of casings as evidenced by off-odour development was noticed during 4th month. Shelf-life of casing is 3 months. 2. Casings treated with salt (40%) and Vinegar.<br>
pH profile of treated casings during storage period is presented in Table 14. pH remained stable during storage period. At the end of 10th month, pH ranged from 3.5 to 3.9. This is a desirable pH for inhibiting microbial growth during storage period. Microbial profile (log cfu/g) recorded during storage period is shown in table 15. Mean ± S.D values revealed substantial reduction in microbial counts (log cfu/g) during storage period standard plate count decreased from 4.30 ± 0.79 to 2.70 ± 0.56; halophilic count decreased from 3.60 ± 0.51 to 2.30 ± 0.33;<br>
mesophilic anaerobic count decreased from 4.10 ± 0.65 to 2.60 ± 0.36; yeast<br><br>
and mould count decreased from 1.7 ± 0.31 to 1.0 + 0.27. Conforms, staphylococcus and salmonella were not detected. The decrease in microbial counts is mainly due to combined effect of salt and low pH. Thus combination of salt and vinegar stabilised the casings and extended the shelf-life upto 10 months. Signs of rupture of casings were observed during 11th month (Table 16).<br>
3.   Casings treated with salt, vinegar and potassium sorbate<br>
pH profile is presented in Table 17. Low pH profile was maintained even upto 10 months. At the end of 10th mongth, pH of casings ranged from 3.80 - 4.00. Microbial profile (log cfu/g) during storage period is presented in Table 18. Mean ± S.D. values revealed that standard plate count decreased from 3.8 ± 0.62 to 2.6 ± 0.35; halophilic count decreased from 3.7 ± 0.42 to 2.7 ± 0.35; mesophilic anaerobic count decreased from 3.7 ± 0.46 to 2.5 ± 0.45; yeast and mould count decreased from 1.21 ± to non-detectable levels. These results demonstrate that low pH brought out the substantial reductions in microbial counts and thus microbial stability of buffalo casings during storage period. The presence of potassium sorbate assisted in the inhibition or elimination of yeast and moulds in the casings during the storage period. The treatment extended the shelf-life of casings upto 10 months. Signs of rupture of casings were observed during 11th month (Table 19).<br>
