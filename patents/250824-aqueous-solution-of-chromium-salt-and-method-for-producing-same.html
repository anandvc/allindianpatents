				<td>AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF CHROMIUM SALT AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING<br>
SAME Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an aqueous solution of a chromium salt and a method for producing the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Among various aqueous solutions of chromium salts, aqueous solutions of chromium nitrate are known to be used as surface treatment agents for metals. Aqueous solutions of chromium phosphate are used as treatment solutions for forming chemical conversion coatings on zinc-plated surfaces of various metals, such as iron, nickel, and copper (refer to Patent Document 1).<br>
In a known method for producing a chromium salt, such as chromium nitrate, chromium phosphate, or chromium chloride, ore is subjected to alkali oxidizing roasting to prepare a sodium dichromate solution, sulfuric acid is added to the sodium dichromate solution, which is then subsequently-reduced with an organic substance to produce a chromium sulfate solution, caustic soda or soda ash is added thereto to form a precipitate of chromium hydroxide or chromium carbonate, which is subsequently subjected to filtration and water washing, and then nitric acid, phosphoric acid, or hydrochloric acid is added thereto for dissolution. In another known method, chromium ore is reduced in an electric furnace using a carbon reductant to produce high-carbon ferrochromium, the high-carbon ferrochromium is extracted<br><br>
with sulfuric acid, the resulting solution is electrolyzed to obtain metallic chromium, and nitric acid or hydrochloric acid is added to the metallic chromium to produce chromium nitrate or chromium chloride.<br>
Furthermore, with respect to chromium nitrate, a production method is also known, which includes the steps of preparing a mixed solution of chromium trioxide and nitric acid by mixing nitric acid with chromium trioxide in a stoichiometric amount required to produce chromium nitrate or more, and adding an excessive amount of an organic reducing agent composed of an alcohol, an aldehyde, or a carboxylic acid, which is derived from a carbohydrate selected from monosaccharides, disaccharides, and starches, or a mixture of these, to the mixed solution of chromium trioxide and nitric acid prepared in the previous step to reduce chromium trioxide, thereby producing chromium nitrate (for example, refer to Patent Document 2).<br>
With respect to chromium chloride, the present applicant has proposed a method in which an aqueous solution of chromic acid is allowed’ to react with an organic reducing agent capable of substantially completely decomposing into carbon dioxide gas and water by reaction with hydrochloric acid and chromic acid, thereby producing a high-purity aqueous solution of chromium chloride (for example, refer to Patent Document 3).<br>
Among known methods, in the method in which chromium hydroxide is dissolved in nitric acid, it is very difficult<br><br>
to perform water washing of the precipitate of chromium hydroxide produced by adding caustic soda or soda ash to chromium sulfate, and it is not possible to remove impurities, such as sodium and sulfate salts, in chromium hydroxide. This problem remains to be solved.<br>
In the method according to Patent Document 2, for example, mixing of nitric acid with chromium trioxide in a stoichiometric amount required to produce chromium nitrate or more is effective in decreasing the amount of hexavalent chromium. However, depending on the conditions, the added reducing agent may react with nitric acid instead of chromium trioxide, resulting in generation of NOx. Consequently, not only a de-NOx system may be required, but also sudden reaction may cause dangerous conditions.

Objects of the invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an aqueous solution of a chromium salt and a method for producing the same, which can overcome the various disadvantages associated with the known techniques described above. In the present invention, the object described above is<br><br>
achieved by providing an aqueous solution of a chromium salt which is characterized in that the oxalic acid content is 8% by weight or less relative to chromium.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention will be described below by way of its preferred embodiments. An aqueous solution of a chromium salt of the present invention is characterized in that the level of oxalic acid, which is an organic substance, is low. More particularly, if the level of oxalic acid is low, it has been found that when an aqueous solution of a chromium salt of the present invention is used for surface treatment of metal, a product with a highly glossy finish can be obtained. In the technique according to Patent Document 2 described above, in order to reduce hexavalent chromium, an organic reducing agent having a large number of carbon atoms, such as starch or glucose, is used, and as a result, the level of oxalic acid present in the aqueous solution is higher than that of the present invention.<br>
The oxalic acid content in an aqueous solution of a chromium salt of the present invention is 8% by weight or less, preferably 6% by weight or less, and more preferably 4% by weight or less, relative to chromium. Furthermore, preferably, oxalic acid is not substantially contained in the aqueous solution of the chromium salt. The oxalic acid content can be measured, for example, by ion chromatography. The lower limit of the oxalic acid content in the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is<br><br>
not particularly limited. An extremely low level, i.e., substantially no content, of oxalic acid can be achieved using a production method that will be described below. The aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is also characterized in that the level of total organic carbon (hereinafter also referred to as “TOC”) is low. As a result of research by the present inventors, it has been found that if the TOC level is low in addition to the low level of oxalic acid described above, when the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is used as a surface treatment agent for metal, a product with a more highly glossy finish can be obtained. The term “TOC” refers to the total amount of C remaining as organic substances in the solution. In the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention, the TOC level is low preferably at 4% by weight or less, and more preferably at 2% by weight or less, relative to chromium. Patent Document 2 describes that 0.3% by weight or more of TOC is required in an aqueous solution of chromium nitrate in order to ensure that hexavalent chromium is reduced to trivalent chromium. However, as a result of detailed research on the TOC conducted by the present inventors, it has been found that if the TOC content is increased, when the aqueous solution of the chromium salt is used as a surface treatment agent for metal, a satisfactory glossy finish cannot be obtained. If an aqueous solution of a chromium salt of the present invention is produced by the<br><br>
■^1<br>
method that will be described below, even if the TOC level is low, hexavalent chromium can be reliably eliminated. The lower limit of the TOC level in the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is not particularly limited. If the production method described below is used, extremely low levels can be achieved, for example, 0.5% by weight in the case of chromium chloride, 0.5% by weight in the case of chromium phosphate, and 0.1% by weight in the case of chromium nitrate.<br>
The TOC in the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention can be measured, for example, with a total organic carbon analyzer Model TOC 500 manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation.<br>
In the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention, in spite of the fact that the oxalic acid content is low and the TOC level is preferably low, substantially no hexavalent chromium is present in the aqueous solution. Consequently, the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is advantageous in that the environmental load is low. Such an aqueous solution is suitably produced by the production method described below. Typical examples of the chromium salt of the present invention include, but are not limited to, a chromium chloride, a chromium nitrate, and a chromium phosphate. When the chromium salt of the present invention is a chromium chloride, an aqueous solution of chromium chloride includes a compound represented by the composition formula:<br><br>
Cr’(OH)xCly (wherein 0 
On the other hand, when the chromium chloride aqueous solution of the present invention is an aqueous solution of basic chromium chloride, the specific gravity at 2 0°C of the aqueous solution is preferably 1.35 to 1.44, and more preferably 1.40 to 1.44. If the specific gravity of the aqueous solution is in this range, disproportionation does not occur in the liquid even if stored for a long period of time, and crystals of chromium chloride are not easily precipitated, thus being preferable. In order to set the specific gravity in the range described above, for example, as will be described below, the molar ratio (Cl/Cr) of chlorine to chromium may be set to be 1 or more and less than 3.<br>
In the aqueous solution of basic chromium chloride, the molar ratio (Cl/Cr) of chlorine to chromium in the basic chromium chloride is preferably 1 or more and less than 3. If the molar ratio is in this range, crystals of chromium chloride do not easily occur. In the present invention, the specific gravity and the molar ratio of chlorine to chromium are important factors in preventing crystallization of chromium chloride more effectively.<br>
In order to set the molar ratio of chlorine to chromium in the basic chromium chloride in the range described above, for example, the production method that will be described below may be used.<br>
The concentration of basic chromium chloride in the aqueous solution of basic chromium chloride is appropriately<br><br>
adjusted in accordance with the intended specific application. In general, the concentration in terms of Cr is preferably 8.2% by weight or more, and particularly preferably 11.4% by weight or more. The upper limit of the concentration is not particularly limited, but is preferably 14% by weight, and particularly preferably about 13.5%. The concentration of basic chromium chloride can be easily adjusted by addition of dilution water, such as ion-exchanged water or pure water. Consequently, the aqueous solution of basic chromium chloride of the present invention is advantageous in that the concentration of chromium chloride can be freely adjusted depending on the intended use.<br>
When the chromium salt of the present invention is a chromium nitrate, an aqueous solution of chromium nitrate includes a compound represented by the composition formula: Cr(OH)x(NO3)y (wherein 0 
 <br>
of the basic chromium nitrate include Cr(OH)05 (N03)2.s&gt; Cr(OH) (NO3)2/ and Cr (OH) 2 (NO3) .<br>
The compounds represented by the above-mentioned composition formula may be present alone or in any combination of two or more in the aqueous solution of chromium nitrate of the prefeent invention. By combining two or more, solutions that are suitable in specific applications can be prepared. When the chromium salt of the present invention is a chromium phosphate, an aqueous solution of chromium phosphate includes a chromium phosphate (e.g., chromium biphosphate) represented by the composition formula: Cr (H3_3/nPO4) n (wherein n is a number satisfying 2 
The compounds represented by the above-mentioned composition formula may be present alone or in any combination of two or more in the aqueous solution of chromium phosphate of the present invention. By combining two or more, solutions that are suitable in specific applications can be prepared. Hexavalent chromium compounds are corrosive and oxidizing, and therefore, in aqueous solutions of chromium salts prepared using these compounds as starting materials, large amounts of impurity metal ions, in particular, Na and Fe, are inevitably mixed. In contrast, the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is characterized in that the content of these ions is extremely low. When<br><br>
such a high-purity aqueous solution of a chromium salt is used, in particular, as a starting material for a chromium catalyst in the production of chromium hydroxide, high-purity chromium hydroxide is advantageously obtained, which is preferable. The concentration of impurity metal ions is measured, for example, using ICP-AES.<br>
With respect to the concentration of impurity metal ions in the aqueous solution of the chromium salt, the Na level is low preferably at 30 ppm or less, and more preferably at 20 ppm or less. The Fe concentration is preferably 20 ppm or less, and more preferably 10 ppm or less. Note that when the chromium salt is a chromium chloride, the concentration is calculated on the basis of 40% by weight in terms of CrCl3. When the chromium salt is a chromium nitrate, the concentration is calculated on the basis of 40% by weight in terms of Cr(NO3)3. When the chromium salt is a chromium phosphate, the concentration is calculated on the basis of 40% by weight in terms of Cr(H2PO4)3.<br>
In addition to the extremely low content of impurity metal ions, the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is also characterized in that the content of impurity anions, in particular, chloride ions and sulfate ions, is extremely low. Above all, with respect to the aqueous solution of chromium phosphate, the level of impurity anions in the aqueous solution is low. Namely, the Cl content is preferably 10 ppm or less, and more preferably 5 ppm or less. The S04 content is preferably 10 0 ppm or<br><br>
leds, and more preferably 50 ppm or less.<br>
The aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention is also characterized in that the solution contains substantially no free counter-ions not bonded with Cr, for example, chlorine ions and nitrate ions. The fact that substantially no free counter-ions are contained is preferable because precipitation of crystals can be advantageously suppressed when the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention in high concentration is stored for a long period of time. The term “high concentration” refers to the concentration of 40% of Cr(NO3)3, for example, when the chromium salt is a chromium nitrate. The aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention can be preferably used, for example, in applications of surface treatment of metal and catalysts. In particular, when used for surface treatment of metal, a product with a highly glossy finish is advantageously obtained.<br>
Preferred methods for producing an aqueous solution of a chromium salt according to the present invention will now be described. First, a preferred method for producing an aqueous solution of chromium chloride, as an example of the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention, will be described. The production method includes adding an organic reducing agent to an aqueous solution of chromic acid to reduce part of the chromic acid in advance in the first stage of reaction, and then mixing<br><br>
hydrochloric acid and the organic reducing agent and adding the mixture to the reaction solution to complete the reaction.<br>
First, the aqueous solution of chromic acid, which is a raw material, is prepared, for example, by a process in which sodium chromate obtained by alkali oxidizing roasting of chromium ore is used as a starting material and subjected to various purification steps to produce chromium trioxide, and the resulting chromium trioxide is dissolved in water. In the aqueous solution of chromic acid thus prepared, the content of impurities, such as Fe, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Ni, Mo, and W, is extremely low compared with that of an aqueous solution of chromic acid prepared using, as a raw material, chromium hydroxide or chromium carbonate obtained by adding caustic soda or soda ash to chromium sulfate, or an aqueous solution of chromic acid prepared by dissolving high-carbon ferrochromium in nitric acid or hydrochloric acid. The aqueous solution of chromic acid must be a solution in the reaction system, and at the initial stage of reaction, chromium trioxide may be used. However, in many cases, water is added thereto for dissolution, and the resulting aqueous solution is used. The concentration of the aqueous solution of chromic acid is not particularly limited, but is preferably in a general range of 20% to 60% by weight. The organic reducing agent to be added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid is not particularly limited as long as it substantially completely decomposes into carbon<br><br>
dioxide gas and water in the reduction reaction, which will be described below. Examples of the organic reducing agent that may be suitably used include monohydric alcohols, such as rttiethanol; and dihydric alcohols, such as ethylene glycol and trimethylene glycol. Other examples of the organic reducing agent include monosaccharides, such as glucose; disaccharides, such as maltose; and polysaccharides, such as starch. However, if saccharides having a large number of carbon atoms are used, organic decomposition products tend to remain, and it is not easy to decrease the oxalic acid content. It is also not easy to decrease the level of TOC containing oxalic acid. Therefore, in this production method, a monohydric or dihydric alcohol, which is a reducing agent capable of easily suppressing generation of oxalic acid and decreasing the TOC level, is preferably used Use of a monohydric or dihydric alcohol is also advantageous in that a substantially stoichiometric reduction reaction is easily carried out. From these standpoints, a lower alcohol (e.g., an alcohol having 4’ or less carbon atoms), in particular, methanol, ethylene glycol, or trimethylene glycol, is preferably used, and in particular, methanol is preferably used.<br>
The organic reducing agent may be directly added without dilution to the aqueous solution of chromic acid, or may be diluted with water before addition. When the organic reducing agent is diluted with water, preferably, the concentration of the organic reducing agent is set at about<br><br>
10% to 3 0% by weight in view of operationality and controllability of reaction.<br>
As the hydrochloric acid to be added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid together with the organic reducing agent, hydrochloric acid for industrial use can be used, and either synthetic hydrochloric acid or by-product hydrochloric acid may be used. Hydrochloric acid with a concentration of 35% by Weight and a specific gravity of 1.15 is usually used, although not limited thereto. For the purpose of the present invention, these various starting materials are preferably used in concentrations as high as possible. In the first stage of reaction, the organic reducing agent is added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid to reduce part of the chromic acid in advance, and then hydrochloric acid and the organic reducing agent are mixed and added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid. The rate of addition in each step is not particularly limited. In a method in which an acid and an aqueous solution of chromic acid are mixed in advance and then an organic reducing agent is added thereto, such as the method described in Patent Document 2, during the production of chromium chloride, as the temperature increases due to reaction heat of oxidation-reduction reaction, chromyl chloride is generated, which is methanol is for example used as the organic reducing dangerous. When<br>
agent, the reaction formula in this production method is as follows:<br><br>
2H2Cr04 + 2xHCl3 + CH3OH ™&gt; 2Cr (OH) 3_XC1X + CO2 + (2x+l)H2O (wherein x is a number in the range of 0 to 3). As shown in the reaction formula, on the assumption that a is the theoretical amount (stoichiometric amount) of hydirochloric acid required for converting chromic acid to chrdmium chloride and b is the theoretical amount (stoichiometric amount) of the organic reducing agent required for reducing chromic acid7 preferably, the relationship a 
Addition of the organic reducing agent to the aqueous solution of chromic acid initiates oxidation-reduction reaction. The reaction rapidly proceeds accompanied by generation of a considerable amount of heat. The reaction temperature is usually 90°C to 110°C. The generated steam is cooled and refluxed to the reaction system by a condenser.<br><br>
When an aqueous solution of basic chromium chloride is produced, hydrochloric acid is added in an amount of 1 mole equivalent to less than 3 mole equivalents based on the chromic acid.<br>
After the reaction is completed, aging is performed for a short period of time, and the resulting product can be used as a finished product. Preferably, the aging is performed for 30 minutes or more and at 90°C to 110°C. The main purposes of the aging process are to decrease Cr6+ present in the solution to substantially zero and to set the oxalic acid content at 8% by weight or less relative to chromium. As necessary, the organic reducing agent is further added to completely reduce remaining Cr6+. Furthermore, hydrochloric acid may be added as necessary to fine-adjust the molar ratio of chromium ions to chlorine ions.<br>
A preferred method for producing an aqueous solution of chromium phosphate, as another example of the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention, will now be described. With respect to the items not particularly mentioned in this production method, those described regarding the production method of chromium chloride are appropriately applied. This production method is characterized in that phosphoric acid and at least one organic reducing agent selected from monohydric alcohols and dihydric alcohols are added to an aqueous solution of chromic acid. The order of addition of phosphoric acid (orthophosphoric<br><br>
acid) and the organic reducing agent to the aqueous solution of chromic acid is not particularly limited. For example, phosphoric acid and the organic reducing agent may be added simultaneously and separately. Alternatively, phosphoric acid may be mixed with the organic reducing agent, and the mixture may be added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid Preferably, phosphoric acid is mixed with the aqueous solution of chromic acid in advance to increase the acidity in the reaction system, and then the organic reducing agent is added. Thereby, generation of oxalic acid can be further suppressed. As the phosphoric acid (orthophosphoric acid), phosphoric acid for industrial use can be used. Phosphoric acid with a concentration of 75% by weight or more is usually used, although not limited thereto. For the purpose of the present invention, these various starting materials are preferably used in concentrations as high as possible. When ethylene glycol is for example used as the organic reducing agent, the reaction formula in this production method is as follows:<br>
10H2CrO4 + IOXH3PO4 + 3(CH2OH)2 → l0Cr(H3-3/XPO4)x + 6CO2 + 34H2O (wherein x is a number satisfying 2 
Addition of the organic reducing agent to the mixed aqueous solution of chromic acid and phosphoric acid initiates oxidation-reduction reaction. The reaction rapidly proceeds accompanied by generation of a considerable amount of heat. The reaction temperature is usually 90°C to 110°C. The generated steam is cooled and refluxed to the reaction<br><br>
system by a condenser.<br>
After the reaction is completed, aging is performed for a short period of time, and the resulting product can be used as a finished product. Preferably, the aging is performed for 30 minutes or more and at 90°C to 110°C. The main purposes of the aging process are to decrease Cr6+ present in the solution to substantially zero and to set the oxalic acid content at 8% by weight or less relative to chromium. As necessary, the organic reducing agent is further added to completely reduce remaining Cr6+. Furthermore, phosphoric acid may be added as necessary to fine-adjust the molar ratio of chromium ions to phosphate ions.<br>
A preferred method for producing an aqueous solution of chromium nitrate, as another example of the aqueous solution of the chromium salt of the present invention, will now be described. With respect to the items not particularly mentioned in this production method, those described regarding the production methods of chromium chloride and chromium phosphate are appropriately applied. This production method is characterized in that nitric acid and an organic reducing agent are separately and simultaneously added to an aqueous solution of chromic acid.<br>
As the nitric acid to be added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid together with the organic reducing agent, nitric acid for industrial use can be used, and either synthetic nitric acid or by-product nitric acid may be used. Nitric acid with a concentration of 67.5% by weight and a<br><br>
specific gravity of 1.4 is usually used, although not limited thereto. For the purpose of the present invention, these various starting materials are preferably used in concentrations as high as possible.<br>
Nitric acid and an organic reducing agent are simultaneously and separately added to an aqueous solution of chromic acid. The rate of addition of each of nitric acid and the organic reducing agent is not particularly limited. The term “separately” means that nitric acid and the organic reducing agent are added not in a mixed state. When the organic reducing agent and nitric acid are mixed, both react with each other to generate NOx, thus being dangerous. Furthermore, as in the method according to Patent Document 2, if a reducing agent is added to a mixed solution of nitric acid and chromic acid, depending on the conditions, the added reducing agent may react with nitric acid instead of chromic acid, resulting in generation of NOx. Consequently, not only a de-NOx system may be required, but also sudden reaction may cause dangerous conditions. When methanol is for example used as the organic reducing agent, the reaction formula in this production method is as follows:<br>
2H2Cr04 + 2xHNO3 + CH3OH -^ 2Cr (OH) 3_x (N03) x + C02 + (2x+l)H2O (wherein x is a number in the range of 0 to 3). As shown in the reaction formula, on the assumption that a is the theoretical amount (stoichiometric amount) of nitric acid required for converting chromic acid to chromium<br><br>
nitrate and b is the theoretical amount (stoichiometric amount) of the organic reducing agent required for reducing chromic acid, preferably, the relationship a 
Addition of nitric acid and the organic reducing agent to the aqueous solution of chromic acid initiates oxidation-reduction reaction. The reaction rapidly proceeds accompanied by generation of a considerable amount of heat. The reaction temperature is usually 90°C to 110°C. The generated steam is cooled and refluxed to the reaction system by a condenser.<br>
In this method, prior to the simultaneous and separate addition of nitric acid and the organic reducing agent, preferably, only the organic reducing agent is added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid. The reason for this is that by allowing the addition of the organic reducing agent to precede and completing the addition of nitric acid after the addition of the organic reducing agent is completed, the ratio a/b in the reaction system can always be set in the range described above.<br><br>
Under the condition in which the organic reducing agent is being added to the aqueous solution of chromic acid first, nitric acid is also added. Thus, both are simultaneously and separately added.<br>
Aft$r the reaction is completed, aging is performed for a short period of time, and the resulting product can be used as a finished product. Preferably, the aging is performed for 30 minutes or more and at 90°C to 110°C. The main purposes of the aging process are to decrease Cr6+ present in the solution to substantially zero and to set the oxalic acid content at 8% by weight or less relative to chromium. As necessary, the organic reducing agent is further added to completely reduce remaining Cr6+. Furthermore, nitric acid may be added as necessary to fine-adjust the molar ratio of chromium ions to nitrate ions.<br>
In the various aqueous solutions of chromium salts produced by the respective production methods described above, the oxalic acid level is low, and substantially no hexavalent chrotlnium is present. As necessary, the resulting aqueous solutions of chromium salts are subjected to heat concentration, and then are cooled to obtain crystals of chromium salts. In the resulting chromium salts, the oxalic acid content is low at 2% by weight or less relative to chromium, and preferably substantially no oxalic acid is contained. Furthermore, hexavalent chromium is not substantially contained. In the heat concentration, water in the aqueous solutions of<br><br>
chromium salts is removed. The heat concentration may be performed after the reaction is completed or during the reaction. When the heat concentration is performed during the reaction, a process may be employed in which the steam generated is condensed by a condenser, and the resulting water is extracted from the reaction system. This process is efficient and industrially advantageous.<br>
