				<td>Field of invention<br>
The invention relates to a method and a node for a call setup in a telecommunication network in that call control signalling and bearer connectivity are separated.<br>
Description of prior art<br>
Recently the evolution of telecommunication networks has brought up a concept in that call control and bearer connectivity are separated, i.e. the task of call control signaling and the task of providing bearer connectivity are performed by different kinds of nodes. Said concept is described in the Technical Specification TS 23.002 of the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) and sometimes referred to as split architecture. According to the new concept call control nodes termed MSC (Mobile Services Switching Centre) Server or MGCs (Media Gateway Controllers) are introduced in a telecommunication network that are responsible for performing call control signaling and for the reservation of resources such as codecs and bearers that are used for the call that is set up. The resources are provided by network nodes providing bearer connectivity termed MGWs (Media GateWays). To control a MGW by a MSC Server or an MGC a GCP (Gateway Control Protocol) has been developed and standardized as H.248 protocol of the ITU (International Telecommunication Union).<br>
According to the state of the art at connection set up resources are reserved independently on a node providing bearer connectivity within the telecommunication network. If resources have to be connected this is an inefficient use of resources as it is likely that connections to external nodes are used for connecting resources in a network node and resources are used inefficiently.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
Therefore it is object of the invention to provide an efficient method for establishing a connection in a telecommunication network in that call control signaling and bearer connectivity are separated.<br>
2<br><br>

further embodiment of the invention.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts a call control node according to the invention<br>
Detailed description of the embodiments<br>
Figure 1 depicts a network node NN1 for providing bearer connectivity within a telecommunication network in that call control and bearer connectivity are separated. One or more logical nodes are implemented on the network node NN1. Hardware resources or software resources are dedicated to a particular of the one or more logical nodes or hardware or software resources are used commonly by the one or more logical nodes. In particular the hardware resources comprise a first physical board PB1 comprising a first digital signal processor DSP1 and a second physical board PB2 comprising a second digital signal processor DSP2. The first and the second digital signal processor DSP1 and DSP2 are connected to each other using an internal connection Cl.<br>
The first digital signal processor DSP1 is connected using a second connection C2 to an external interface bus EIB providing connectivity to external nodes within the telecommunication network. Accordingly the second digital signal processor DSP2 is connected using a third connection C3 to an external interface bus EIB providing connectivity to external nodes within the telecommunication network.<br>
If a bearer is set up to an external node within the telecommunication network, the second or the third connection C2 or C3 to the external interface bus EIB are used.<br>
7<br><br>
The network node comprises a first interface 11 for receiving call control messages and a second interface 12 for receiving call control messages. The first interface 11 may be used by a first of the one or more logical nodes and the second interface 12 may be used by a second of the one or more logical nodes. During a connection set up a first message requesting a creation or a reservation of a resource up is received via the first interface 11 and a second message requesting a creation or a reservation of a resource is received via the second interface 12.<br>
According to the reception of the first message resources are created or reserved for the connection to be set up. Such resources are e.g. a bearer termination or a context for one or more bearer terminations comprising the created or reserved bearer termination. Advantageously the reception of the first message and/or the creation and the reservation of the resources are acknowledged. Furthermore an indication of the one or more created resources is advantageously returned towards the node issuing the first message. The first message comprises an indication of a connection or the bearer that is to be set up. Advantageously the indication for the connection or the bearer is stored related to the resources that are created or reserved for the bearer.<br>
Similarly resources are created or reserved according to the reception of the second message. The reception of the second message and/or the creation or the reservation of the resources are advantageously acknowledged towards the network node issuing the second message. Furthermore the second logical node advantageously returns an indication of the created or reserved resources towards the node issuing the second message. The second message comprises an indication of a connection or the bearer that is to be set up. Advantageously the indication for the connection or the bearer are stored related to the created or reserved resources.<br>
According to the invention the first and the second processor board PB 1 and PB2 are adapted to exchange the indication for the connection and to compare the indication for the connection received in the first message with the indication received in the second message. If the<br>
8<br><br>
indications match the internal connection Cl is used to connect the first and the second processor board PB1 and PB2. In the case that the first message is for the first logical node and the second message is for the second logical node , said connecting may comprise creating a bearer between the first and the second logical node and to use the connection Cl for the bearer.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a further network node PN2 providing bearer connectivity within a telecommunications network in that call control and bearer connectivity are separated. The further network node PN2 can be for example a Media Gateway. Furthermore figure 2 depicts a first and second call control node MGC1 and MGC2 that are adapted to control the further network node and to reserve resources in the further network node PN2. The first and the second call control node MGC1 and MGC2 can be e.g. a Media Gateway Controller or an MSC Server.<br>
The further network node PN2 is implemented as a distributed system comprising a first, a second, a third, and a fourth processing device MSP1, MSP2, MSP3, and MSP4. The processing devices can be e.g. processor boards or processing units adapted to create or reserve resources for bearers. Furthermore the further network node PN2 comprises a distribution unit PTP that is adapted to distribute the reservation or creation of resources between the first, the second, the third, and the fourth processing device MSP1, MSP2, MSP3, and MSP4.<br>
The further network node PN2 is connected to the first and to the second call control node MGC1 and MGC2 via an interface STC.<br>
The further network node may host a first and a second logical node LN1 and LN2 that are utilizing the software resources of the further network node PN2 and the hardware resources of the further network node PN2 such as the distribution unit PTP and the first, the second, the third, and the fourth processing device MSP1, MSP2, MSP3, and MSP4.<br>
9<br><br>
The further network node PN2 is adapted to receive via the interface PTP a message requesting creating or reserving resources e.g. resources used when setting up a bearer. In the case of the first and the second logical network node said resources may be resources dedicated to said first or the second logical node LN2. According to the reception of a first message requesting creating or reserving one or more first resources, the requested resources are created or reserved, e.g. for the first logical node LN1. Said resources are e.g. a bearer termination or a context for one or more bearer terminations containing a created bearer termination. For that the processing device on that the resources are physically created or reserved is selected by the distribution unit PTP.<br>
In the depicted example the first processing device MSP1 is chosen for the creation or reservation of the one or more first resources e.g. for the first logical node LN1. The one or more first resources, in the depicted example a first bearer termination Tl and a first context Cl containing the first bearer termination Tl, are created on the first processing device MSP1. The message requesting the creation or reservation of the one or more first resources comprises an indication of a connection or the bearer to be set up. The distribution unit PTP stores an identification of the created or reserved resources such that they are accessible via the identification of the connection or the bearer to be set up.<br>
Similarly, according to the reception of a second message requesting a creation or a reservation of one or more second resources, the requested one or more second resources are created or reserved, and in the case of the multiple logical nodes the one or more second resources are assigned to the second logical node LN2. Said resources are e.g. a bearer termination or a context for one or more bearer terminations containing the created bearer termination. The second call control message comprises the identification of the bearer or the connection to be set up. The processing device on that the one or more second resources are physically created or reserved is selected by the distribution unit PTP. To that end already stored identification for connections or bearers are looked up by the distribution unit PTP and, if a matching identification for a connection or a bearer is found, the respective processing device on that resources have been reserved or created is determined, in the depicted example the first processing device MSP1. The determined processing device is chosen for the<br>
10<br><br>
reservation or the creation of the one or more second resources. The one or more second resources, in the depicted example a second bearer termination T2 and a second context C2 containing the second bearer termination, are created on the first processing device MSP1. Upon creation of the first and the second bearer termination Tl and T2 on the first processing device MSP1, the first and the second bearer termination Tl and T2 are connected using an internal connection of the first processing device MSP1. In the case of the multiple logical nodes this may comprise connecting the first and the second logical node LN2 using a bearer, where in fact only resources internal to the first processing device are used for that bearer.<br>
Figure 3 depicts a call control node SNN for controlling establishing a connection in a telecommunications network in that call control and bearer connectivity are separated. The call control node SNN comprises a processing device PS for processing and generating messages and one or more signaling interfaces SI towards one or more network nodes for providing bearer connectivity within the telecommunications network. The processing device PS is adapted to determine during a connection set up an identification of the connection and to send via the signaling interface a first message requesting a creation or a reservation of a first resource, e.g. a bearer termination, and a second message requesting a creation or a reservation of a second resource, e.g. a second bearer termination, towards the one or more network nodes, the first and the second message comprising the identification of the connection.<br>

processing devices (MSP1; MSP2; MSP3; MSP4) capable of creating or reserving<br>
resources and a selection unit (PTP) for selecting a processing device (MSP1) on that a<br>
requested resource (CN1; CN2; Tl; T2) is created or reserved, wherein the selection unit<br>
(PTP) is adapted to select according to the result of the comparison a common processing<br>
device (MSP1) on that first (CN1; Tl) and the second resource (CN2; T2) are created or<br>
reserved.<br>
15<br><br>
13. Network node (NN1; PN2) according to any of the claims 10 to 12, wherein the first (Tl; CN1) and the second resource (T2; CN2) are a first (CN1) and a second context (CN2) or a first (Tl) and a second bearer termination (T2).<br>
Dated this 13th day of October 2006.<br><br>

According to the present invention a method is provided for establishing a connection in a telecommunications network in that call control and bearer connectivity are separated. The telecommunications network comprises one or more logical nodes providing bearer connectivity within the telecommunication network, the one or more logical nodes are implemented on a common physical node (NN1; PN2), and the invented method comprises the steps of:<br>
-	determining an identification of the connection,<br>
-	sending a first message requesting a creation or a reservation of a first resource (Cl; Tl),<br>
e.g. a bearer termination or a context and a second message requesting a creation or a<br>
reservation of a second resource (C2; T2) to the one or more logical nodes, the first and the<br>
second message comprising the identification of the connection,<br>
-	creating or reserving the first (Cl; Tl) and the second resource (C2; T2),<br>
-	comparing the identification received in the first message with the identification received in<br>
the second message, and<br>
-	according to the result of the comparison connecting the first and the second resource using<br>
a connection (Cl) internal to the common physical node.<br></td>
