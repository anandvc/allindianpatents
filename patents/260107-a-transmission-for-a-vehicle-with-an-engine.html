HYBRID ELECTRICALLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION WITH DUAL POWER<br>
PATHS AND SELECTIVE MOTOR CONNECTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to a hybrid electrically variable transmission<br>
having two motor/generators, one of which is selectively connectable to two different<br>
gear elements of a five node compound differential gear set, and the other of which is<br>
connectable to yet a different gear element, and that provides an electrically variable<br>
input-split operating mode.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Hybrid electrically variable powertrains include an engine and a<br>
transmission that receives power flow from the engine and from one or more<br>
motor/generators. Hybrid electrically variable transmissions have a differential gear<br>
set, with power from the engine and power from the motor/generator flowing through<br>
different members of the differential gear set. Hybrid electrically variable<br>
transmissions may include torque-transmitting mechanisms engagable according to<br>
various engagement schedules to offer a combination of operating modes, including<br>
both electrically variable ranges and fixed gear ratios. The electrically variable ranges<br>
typically provide optimum engine speed with smooth operation while the fixed gear<br>
ratios provide maximum torque performance and maximum fuel economy under<br>
certain conditions such as continuous highway cruising. The electrically variable<br>
range is established via an electromechanical power path, wherein a fraction of the<br>
power transmitted from the engine to the output is converted into electricity by a<br>
motor/generator then back into mechanical power by a motor/generator. Fixed gear<br>
ratios typically provide excellent transmission output torque and vehicle acceleration<br>
by coupling the motor/generators and the engine directly together. In a fixed gear<br>
ratio, the power flow path from the transmission input member to the transmission<br>
output member is considered to be entirely through a mechanical power path, as speed<br>
is not varied by the motor/generator.<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	An electrically variable transmission having two motor/generators<br>
provides power-split, electrically variable power flow along dual power paths and<br>
provides multiple operating modes, including an electrically variable input-split<br>
mode. The transmission also includes a differential gear set having five gear<br>
elements (i.e., a compound differential gear set representable by a five node lever<br>
diagram). A first of the motor/generators is continuously connected to one of the<br>
gear elements and a second of the motor/generators is separately selectively<br>
connectable to two of the other gear elements. When the second motor/generator is<br>
connected to both of the gear elements, a fixed speed ratio can be established; thus,<br>
no lock-up clutch is necessary to achieve a fixed speed ratio through the differential<br>
gear set.<br>
[0004]	As used herein, a "gear element" is an element of a differential gear<br>
set that can be represented by a node on a lever diagram. For instance, in a<br>
planetary gear set, a carrier member, a sun gear member and a ring gear member<br>
are all represented as nodes on a lever diagram, but pinion gears supported by the<br>
carrier member are not represented as nodes. Also, in a compound planetary gear<br>
set, those gear elements that are continuously interconnected with one another are<br>
represented by a single node. Those skilled in the art readily understand the<br>
representation of compound differential gear sets as lever diagrams.<br>
[0005]	As used herein, a "mode" is a particular operating state, whether<br>
encompassing a continuous range of speed ratios or only a fixed speed ratio,<br>
achieved by engagement of a particular torque-transmitting mechanism or<br>
combination of torque-transmitting mechanisms.<br>
[0006]	The transmission includes an input member adapted to receive power<br>
from an engine, and an output member. The input member is connected for<br>
common rotation with the first gear element and the first motor/generator is<br>
connected for common rotation with the second gear element. The transmission<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
3<br>
further includes intermeshing gears, at least one of which is connectable for rotation<br>
with the output member. A first motor clutch selectively engages the second<br>
motor/generator with the third gear element. A second motor clutch selectively<br>
engages the second motor/generator with the fourth gear element. First and second<br>
transfer members, which are preferably shafts, are connected for common rotation<br>
with the fourth and fifth gear elements, respectively, and are separately operatively<br>
connectable with the output member via different ones of the intermeshing gears by<br>
engagement of different output torque-transmitting mechanisms. Thus, the first and<br>
second transfer members partially form first and second power paths between the<br>
input member and the output member.<br>
[0007]	Multiple operating modes are possible by engagement of different<br>
combinations of the motor clutches and the output torque-transmitting mechanisms.<br>
For example, an electrically variable input-split mode is established by engagement<br>
of the second motor clutch and one of the output torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
that connects the fourth gear element to the output member. A compound-split<br>
operating mode is established by engagement of the first motor clutch and the same<br>
output torque-transmitting mechanism that was engaged in the electrically variable<br>
input-split operating mode. A fixed ratio mode is established if both of the motor<br>
clutches and that same output torque-transmitting mechanism are engaged, because<br>
engagement of both of the motor clutches locks up the differential gear set so that all<br>
gear elements rotate at the same speed.<br>
[0008]	In one embodiment, the intermeshing gears include multiple gear sets<br>
that transfer torque from the transfer members to the output member via a<br>
countershaft. One of the gear sets may be a reversing gear set with a gear<br>
connected for common rotation with the output member, a gear connectable for<br>
rotation with the countershaft, and a reversing or idler gear intermeshing with both<br>
of the other gears. Engagement of the second motor clutch and of a reverse output<br>
clutch connects the gear for common rotation with the output shaft to enable an<br>
input-split, electrically variable mode. If there are three other gear sets with three<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
4<br>
additional output torque-transmitting mechanisms selectively engagable to transfer<br>
torque from the countershaft alone each of these sets, respectively, then this<br>
embodiment achieves one electrically variable input-split forward mode, three<br>
electrically variable compound-split modes and five fixed forward ratio modes in<br>
addition to the electrically variable input-split reverse mode.<br>
[0009]	In another embodiment, the intermeshing gears are a simple planetary<br>
gear set having a first member connected for rotation with the first transfer member,<br>
a second member connected for rotation with the output member and a third<br>
member selectively grounded to the stationary member via one of the output torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms. The output torque-transmitting mechanisms also include a<br>
clutch that selectively connects the fifth gear element to the output member. This<br>
embodiment achieves one electrically variable input-split mode, two electrically<br>
variable input split modes and three fixed ratio modes.<br>
[0010]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0011]	FIGURE 1 is a schematic illustration of a first powertrain including a<br>
first transmission within the scope of the invention; and<br>
[0012]	FIGURE 2 is a schematic illustration of a second powertrain including<br>
a second transmission within the scope of the invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
First Embodiment<br>
[0013]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, Figure 1 shows a powertrain 10 for a vehicle 11 (shown schematically).<br>
The powertrain 10 includes an engine 12 connected to one embodiment of an<br>
electrically variable transmission (EVT) designated generally by the numeral 14. The<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
transmission 14 is designed to receive at least a portion of its driving power from the<br>
engine 12. The engine 12 has an output shaft connected with an input member 16 of<br>
the transmission 14. A final drive unit 17 is operatively connected to an output<br>
member 19 of the transmission 14.<br>
[0014]	The transmission 14 includes a compound differential gear set 20. The<br>
differential gear set 20 is a Ravigneaux type gear set, although other types of<br>
differential gear sets may be used within the scope of the invention. Specifically, the<br>
differential gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 22, a ring gear member 24 and a<br>
carrier member 26 that rotatably supports a first set of pinion gears 27 that intermesh<br>
with the sun gear member 22 and the ring gear member 24 and with a second set of<br>
pinion gears 28. The carrier member 26 also rotatably supports the second set of<br>
pinion gears 28 that intermesh with a sun gear member 32 and a ring gear member 34<br>
and with the first set of pinion gears 27. Those skilled in the art will recognize that<br>
the differential gear set 20 may be represented as a five node lever diagram, each node<br>
of the lever diagram representing the following gear elements: sun gear member 22,<br>
sun gear member 32, carrier member 26, ring gear member 24 and ring gear member<br>
34. In the claims, the carrier member 26 is referred to as the first gear element, the<br>
sun gear member 22 is referred to as the second gear element, the sun gear member 32<br>
is referred to as the third gear element, the ring gear member 34 is referred to as the<br>
fourth gear element and the ring gear member 24 is referred to as the fifth gear<br>
element.<br>
[0015]	The input member 16 is continuously connected with the carrier<br>
member 26. A first motor/generator 40A is continuously connected to the sun gear<br>
member 22. The ring gear members 24 and 34 function as two separate output<br>
elements of the differential gear set, partially forming two separate power paths<br>
through the transmission 14, as discussed below.<br>
[0016]	The motor generator 40A includes a stator portion 42A grounded to a<br>
stationary member 44, such as the transmission housing. A rotor portion 46A of the<br>
motor/generator 40A is continuously connected to the sun gear member 22 via a<br>
sleeve shaft 47. The stator 42A may receive electrical power from or provide<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
electrical power to an energy storage device 48 such as a battery. An electronic<br>
controller 50 is in signal communication with the battery 48 and with a power inverter<br>
52 that is also in electrical communication with the stator portion 42A. The controller<br>
50 responds to a variety of input signals including vehicle speed, operator demand,<br>
the level at which the battery 48 is charged and the power being provided by the<br>
engine 12 to regulate the flow of power between the motor/generator 40A and the<br>
battery 48 via the inverter 52, which converts between direct current provided or<br>
utilized by the battery 48 and alternating current provided or utilized by the stator<br>
portion 42A.<br>
[0017]	A second motor/generator 40B includes a stator portion 42B grounded<br>
to the stationary member 44. A rotor portion 46B of the motor/generator 40B is<br>
selectively connectable to the sun gear member 32 via engagement of a first motor<br>
clutch MC1. The rotor portion 46B is also selectively connectable with the ring gear<br>
member 34 via engagement of a second motor clutch MC2. The battery 48, controller<br>
50 and inverter 52 are operatively connected with the stator portion 42B in the same<br>
manner as explained above with respect to the stator portion 42A.<br>
[0018]	The transmission 14 further includes transfer members 56, 58,<br>
countershaft 60 and a plurality of intermeshing gears selectively connecting the<br>
transfer members 56, 58 with the output member via the countershaft 60, as described<br>
below. Ring gear member 24 is continuously connected with transfer member 58.<br>
Ring gear member 34 is continuously connected with transfer member 56.<br>
[0019]	The intermeshing gears include an intermeshing gear set consisting of<br>
gear 62 and gear 64. Gear 62 is connected for common rotation with the transfer<br>
member 56 and intermeshes with gear 64, which is connected for common rotation<br>
with the countershaft 60. The intermeshing gears further include a reversing gear set<br>
consisting of intermeshing gears 66, 68 and 70. Gear 66 rotates concentrically about<br>
countershaft 60 and is selectively connectable for common rotation therewith by<br>
selective engagement of output clutch OCR. Gear 68 rotates with output member 19.<br>
Reversing gear 70 intermeshes with both gears 66 and 68 so that gears 66 and 68<br>
rotate in the same direction. The reversing gear 70 is supported on a separate shaft or<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
support structure (not shown) and rotates about an axis parallel to the transfer<br>
members 56, 58 and the countershaft 60. The intermeshing gears further include a<br>
gear set consisting of intermeshing gears 72 and 74. Gear 72 rotates with output<br>
member 19. Gear 74 intermeshes with gear 72 and is selectively connectable for<br>
common rotation therewith by selective engagement of output clutch OC3. The<br>
intermeshing gears further include a gear set consisting of intermeshing gears 76 and<br>
78. Gear 76 rotates with output member 19. Gear 78 intermeshes with gear 76 and is<br>
selectively connectable for common rotation therewith by selective engagement of<br>
output clutch OC1.<br>
[0020]	In addition to the output clutches OC1, OC3 and OCR, an output<br>
clutch OC2 is selectively engagable to connect transfer member 58 and ring gear<br>
member 24 for common rotation with output member 19. Thus, the transmission 14<br>
includes four output clutches (OC1, OC2, OC3 and OCR) and four countershaft gear<br>
sets (gear set 62, 62; gear set 68, 70, 66; gear set 72, 74; and gear set 76,78).<br>
[0021]	The torque-transmitting mechanisms MC1, MC2, OC1, OC2, OC3 and<br>
OCR are operatively connected to controller 50 (connected by transfer conductors, not<br>
shown for simplicity) that controls engagement thereof to provide multiple operating<br>
modes, including an electrically variable input-split (forward) mode, three electrically<br>
variable compound-split forward modes, an electrically-variable input-split reverse<br>
mode and five fixed forward ratios, as described below.<br>
[0022]	The transmission 14 can operate in an electrically-variable input-split<br>
mode for low output speeds by engaging motor clutch MC2 and output clutch OC1.<br>
Motor/generator 40B is connected with transfer member 56 and ring gear member 34<br>
(by engagement of MC2), which in turn are operatively connected with the output<br>
member 19 via the gear set 62, 64 and gear set 76, 78 (by engagement of output clutch<br>
OC1). Torque is also provided by the engine 12 through the differential gear set 20 to<br>
the transfer member 56. As the speed of the output member 19 increases from zero<br>
with the speed of engine 12 constant and non-zero, that is as the transmission speed<br>
ratio falls, the speed of the ring gear member 34 increases from zero, the speed of the<br>
sun gear member 22 falls toward and then through zero, and the speed of the sun gear<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
member 32 rises, considering positive speed to be in the same direction as positive<br>
rotation of the output member 19.<br>
[0023]	At some point during the electrically variable input-split forward<br>
mode, the motor/generator 40B can be connected to sun gear member 32 by<br>
engagement of motor clutch MC1 and disconnected from ring gear member 34 by<br>
disengagement of motor clutch MC2. With the motor/generator 40B connected to the<br>
sun gear member 32, the transmission 14 can operate in three different electrically<br>
variable compound-split (forward) modes, by engagement of the each one of output<br>
clutches OC1, OC2 and OC3, respectively. That is, a first electrically variable<br>
compound-split (forward) mode is established by engagement of MC1 and output<br>
clutch OC1, a second electrically variable compound-split (forward) mode is<br>
established by engagement of motor clutch MC1 and output clutch OC2, and a third<br>
electrically variable compound-split (forward) mode is established by engagement of<br>
motor clutch MC1 and output clutch OC3.<br>
[0024]	In the electrically-variable input split or compound split modes, the<br>
motor/generator 40A or 40B may act as a motor to add torque to the transmission 14.<br>
If braking occurs during these modes, the motor/generator 40A or 40B is controlled as<br>
a generator to convert rotational speed of one of the sun gear members 22 or 32 (in<br>
compound-split modes), respectively, into stored electrical power in the battery 48<br>
with the motor rotor 46A or 46B, respectively, absorbing torque as it does so to help<br>
slow the output member 19 and brake the vehicle 11. Similarly, the motor/generators<br>
40A and 40B may be controlled to operate as generators to recharge the battery 48.<br>
[0025]	An electrically variable input-split reverse mode is established by<br>
engagement of motor clutch MC2 and output clutch OCR. Motor/generator 40B is<br>
connected with transfer member 56 and ring gear member 34 (by engagement of<br>
MC2), which in turn are operatively connected with the output member 19 via the<br>
gear set 62, 64 and reverse gear set 66, 70, 68 (by engagement of output clutch OCR).<br>
Torque is also provided by the engine 12 through the differential gear set 20 to the<br>
transfer member 56.<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
[0026]	The transmission 14 can operate at five different fixed ratios. For<br>
example, in the shift from the electrically variable input-split mode in which motor<br>
clutch MC2 and output clutch OC1 are engaged to the electrically variable compound-<br>
split mode in which motor clutch MC1 and output clutch OC1 are engaged, both<br>
described above, if both motor clutches MC1 and MC2 are engaged while output<br>
clutch OC1 is engaged, a fixed gear ratio will be achieved, as the differential gear set<br>
20 will be locked with all components rotating at one speed. Thus, the motor clutches<br>
MC1 and MC2 can be operated to take the place of a separate lockup clutch for the<br>
planetary gear set 20. A second fixed ratio is achieved with both motor clutches MC1<br>
and MC2 engaged and output clutch OC2 engaged. A third fixed ratio is achieved<br>
with both motor clutches MC1 and MC2 engaged and output clutch OC3 engaged. A<br>
fourth fixed ratio is achieved during compound split operation with motor clutch MC1<br>
engaged by engaging two output clutches OC1 and OC2 as these will cause the<br>
different transfer members 56 and 58, and thus the ring gear elements 24 and 34 to<br>
rotate at the same speed. Similarly, a fifth fixed ratio is achieved by engaging output<br>
clutches OC2 and OC3 while motor clutch MC1 is engaged.<br>
[0027]	The powertrain 10 provides several electric-only operating modes<br>
wherein power is provided only by the motor/generators 40A, 40B, such as key-on<br>
engine starting, engine-off reverse driving, and engine-off forward driving. A key-on<br>
engine starting and idle operating mode is achieved by engaging both of the motor<br>
clutches MC1 and MC2. Electrical energy is supplied from the battery 48 to the<br>
motor/generators 40A and 40B, which act as motors to turn both of the sun gear<br>
members 22, 32 in the same direction. The transfer members 56 and 58 rotate<br>
relatively freely, as none of the output clutches OC1, OC2, OC3 and OCR are<br>
engaged, so the output member 19 does not rotate. The pinions gears 27, 28 rotate<br>
due to the sun gear members 22, 32, and cause the carrier member 26, and thus the<br>
input member 16, to rotate. This in turn causes rotation of the engine output member<br>
(connected to the transmission input member 16), turning the engine over to start the<br>
engine 12<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
[0028]	A fixed reverse speed ratio is achieved by engaging both motor<br>
clutches MC1, MC2 and output clutch OCR. In this arrangement, all members of the<br>
planetary gear set 20 as well as the input member 16 and the motor/generators 40A<br>
and 40B rotate at the same speed. Torque is transferred to the output member 19 via<br>
gear set 62, 62, the reverse gear set (gear 66, reversing gear 70 and gear 68), and<br>
countershaft 60.<br>
[0029]	An electric-only reverse mode is achieved, for example, by engaging<br>
only output clutch OCR while the motor/generator 40A supplies mechanical power to<br>
the sun gear member 22. Pinion gears 27, 28, respectively, supply mechanical power<br>
to the ring gear members 24 and 34. Ring gear member 34 provides rotational speed<br>
to the countershaft 60 and the reverse gear set (gear 66, reversing gear 70 and gear<br>
68). The reversing gear 70 reverses the direction of rotation so that gear 68 rotates at<br>
the same speed and in the same direction as gear 66.<br>
[0030]	First and second power paths (ring gear member 34 and transfer<br>
member 56 being the first power path, ring gear member 24 and transfer member 58<br>
being the second power path) are provided in the transmission 14. The second power<br>
path is used when output clutch OC2 is engaged. The first power path is used when<br>
any of clutches OCR, OC1 or OC3 are engaged.<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
[0031]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, Figure 2 shows a powertrain 110 for a vehicle 111 (shown<br>
schematically). The powertrain 110 includes an engine 112 connected to one<br>
embodiment of an electrically variable transmission (EVT) designated generally by<br>
the numeral 114. The transmission 114 is designed to receive at least a portion of its<br>
driving power from the engine 112. The engine 112 has an output shaft connected<br>
with an input member 116 of the transmission 114. A final drive unit 117 is<br>
operatively connected to an output member 119 of the transmission 114.<br>
[0032]	The transmission 114 includes a compound differential gear set 120.<br>
The differential gear set 120 is a Ravigneaux type gear set, although other types of<br>
differential gear sets may be used within the scope of the invention. Specifically, the<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
differential gear set 120 includes a sun gear member 122, a ring gear member 124 and<br>
a carrier member 126 that rotatably supports a first set of pinion gears 127 that<br>
intermesh with the sun gear member 122 and the ring gear member 124 and with a<br>
second set of pinion gears 128. The carrier member 126 also rotatably supports the<br>
second set of pinion gears 128 that intermesh with a sun gear member 132 and a ring<br>
gear member 134 and with the first set of pinion gears 127. Those skilled in the art<br>
will recognize that the differential gear set 120 may be represented as a five node<br>
lever diagram, each node of the lever diagram representing the following gear<br>
elements: sun gear member 122, sun gear member 132, carrier member 126, ring gear<br>
member 124 and ring gear member 134. In the claims, the carrier member 126 is<br>
referred to as the first gear element, the sun gear member 122 is referred to as the<br>
second gear element, the sun gear member 132 is referred to as the third gear element,<br>
the ring gear member 134 is referred to as the fourth gear element and the ring gear<br>
member 124 is referred to as the fifth gear element.<br>
[0033]	The input member 116 is continuously connected with the carrier<br>
member 126. A first motor/generator 140A is continuously connected to the sun gear<br>
member 122. The ring gear members 124 and 134 function as two separate output<br>
elements of the differential gear set, partially forming two separate power paths<br>
through the transmission 114, as discussed below.<br>
[0034]	The motor generator 140A includes a stator portion 142A grounded to<br>
a stationary member 144, such as the transmission housing. A rotor portion 146A of<br>
the motor/generator 140A is continuously connected to the sun gear member 122 via a<br>
sleeve shaft 147. The stator 142A may receive electrical power from or provide<br>
electrical power to an energy storage device 148 such as a battery. An electronic<br>
controller 150 is in signal communication with the battery 148 and with a power<br>
inverter 152 that is also in electrical communication with the stator portion 142A.<br>
The controller 150 responds to a variety of input signals including vehicle speed.<br>
operator demand, the level at which the battery 148 is charged and the power being<br>
provided by the engine 112 to regulate the flow of power between the motor/generator<br>
140A and the battery 148 via the inverter 152, which converts between direct current<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
provided or utilized by the battery 148 and alternating current provided or utilized by<br>
the stator portion 142A.<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
13<br>
[0035]	A second motor/generator MOB includes a stator portion 142B<br>
grounded to the stationary member 144. A rotor portion 146B of the motor/generator<br>
140B is selectively connectable to the sun gear member 132 via engagement of first<br>
motor clutch MC1. The rotor portion 146B is also selectively connectable with the<br>
ring gear member 134 via engagement of second motor clutch MC2. The battery 148.<br>
controller 150 and inverter 152 are operatively connected with the stator portion 142B<br>
in the same manner as explained above with respect to the stator portion 142A.<br>
[0036]	The transmission 114 further includes transfer members 156, 158 and a<br>
plurality of intermeshing gears selectively connecting the transfer members 156, 158<br>
with the output member 119 as described below. Ring gear member 124 is<br>
continuously connected with transfer member 158. Ring gear member 134 is<br>
continuously connected with transfer member 156.<br>
[0037]	The intermeshing gears are a planetary gear set having a sun gear<br>
member 162, a carrier member 165 and a ring gear member 169. The carrier member<br>
165 rotatably supports a set of pinion gears 167 which mesh with both the sun gear<br>
member 162 and the ring gear member 169. The sun gear member 162 is<br>
continuously connected for common rotation with the ring gear member 134 via the<br>
transfer member or shaft 156. The carrier member 165 is continuously connected<br>
with the output member 119.<br>
[0038]	The transmission 114 includes output torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
including an output clutch OC and an output brake OB. The output clutch OC is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the ring gear member 124 via the transfer member<br>
158 to both the carrier member 165 and the output member 119. The output brake<br>
OB is selectively engageable to ground the ring gear member 169 to the transmission<br>
housing 144.<br>
[0039]	The torque-transmitting mechanisms MC1, MC2, OC and OB are<br>
operatively connected to the controller 150 (connected by transfer conductors, not<br>
shown for simplicity) that controls engagement thereof to provide multiple operating<br>
modes, including an electrically variable input-split (forward mode), two electrically<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
variable compound-split forward modes and three fixed forward ratio modes, as<br>
described below.<br>
[0040]	The transmission 114 can operate in an electrically variable input-split<br>
mode for low output speeds by engaging motor clutch MC2. Motor/generator 140B is<br>
thereby connected with transfer member 156 and ring gear member 134, which in turn<br>
are operatively connected with the output member 119 through the sun gear member<br>
162, pinion gears 127 and carrier member 165. Torque is also provided by the engine<br>
112 through differential gear set 120 to the transfer member 156.<br>
[0041]	At some point during the electrically variable input-split forward<br>
mode, the motor/generator 140B can be connected to the sun gear member 132 by<br>
engaging motor clutch MC1 and disconnected from ring gear member 134 by<br>
disengagement of motor clutch MC2. With motor/generator 140B connected to the<br>
sun gear member 132, the transmission 114 can operate in two different electrically<br>
variable compound-split (forward) modes, by engagement of the output clutch OC<br>
and the output brake OB, respectively. A first electrically variable compound-split<br>
(forward) mode is established by engagement of motor clutch MC1 and output clutch<br>
OC and a second electrically variable compound-split (forward) mode is established<br>
by engagement of motor clutch MC1 and output brake OB.<br>
[0042]	In the electrically variable input-split or in the electrically variable<br>
compound-split mode, the motor/generator 140A or HOB acts as a motor to add<br>
torque to the transmission 114. If braking occurs during these modes, the<br>
motor/generator 140A or 140 B is controlled as a generator to convert rotational speed<br>
of one of the sun gear members 122 or 132 (in compound-split mode), respectively,<br>
and to store electrical power in the battery 148 with the motor rotor 146A or 146 B,<br>
respectively, absorbing torque as it does so to help slow the output member 119 and<br>
brake the vehicle 111. Similarly, the motor/generator 140 A or 140B may be<br>
controlled to operate as a generator to recharge the battery 148.<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
15<br>
[0043]	The transmission 114 can operate in three different fixed ratio modes.<br>
For example, in the shift from the electrically variable input-split mode in which<br>
motor clutch MC2 and output clutch OC are engaged to the electrically variable<br>
compound-split mode in which motor clutch MC1 and output clutch OC are engaged<br>
(both described above), if both motor clutches MC1 and MC2 are engaged while<br>
output clutch OC is engaged, a fixed gear ratio mode will be achieved, as differential<br>
gear set 120 will be locked with all components rotating at one speed. Thus, the<br>
motor clutches MC1 and MC2 can be operated to take the place of a separate lock-up<br>
clutch for the planetary gear set 120.<br>
[0044]	A second fixed ratio mode is achieved with both motor clutches MC1<br>
and MC2 engaged and output brake OB engaged. A third fixed ratio mode is<br>
achieved during compound-split operation with motor clutch MC1 engaged by<br>
engaging the output clutch OC as well as the output brake OB, as this will cause the<br>
transfer members 156 and 158, and thus the ring gear elements 124 and 134 to rotate<br>
at the same speed.<br>
[0045]	The powertrain 110 provides electric-only operating modes where<br>
power is provided only by the motor/generators 140A, HOB such as key-on engine<br>
starting and engine-only forward driving. A key-on engine starting in idle operating<br>
mode is achieved by engaging both of the motor clutches MC1 and MC2. Electrical<br>
energy supplied from the battery 148 to the motor/generators 140A, HOB which act<br>
as motors to turn both of the sun gear members 122, 132 in the same direction. The<br>
transfer members 156, 158 rotate relatively freely, as none of the output torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms OC and OB are engaged, so that the output member 119<br>
does not rotate. The pinion gears 127 and 128 rotate due to sun gear members 122 and<br>
132, and cause the carrier member 126, and thus input member 116 to rotate. This in<br>
turn causes rotation of the engine output member (connected to the transmission input<br>
member 116), turning the engine 112 over to start the engine 112.<br><br>
GP- 307760-PTH-CD<br>
16<br>
[0046]	An electric-only forward mode is achieved, for example, by operating<br>
motor/generator 140A as a motor to supply torque to ring gear member 134 via sun<br>
gear member 122 and pinion gears 127, 128. Ring gear member 134 provides torque<br>
to output member 119 via transfer member 156, sun gear member 162, and carrier<br>
member 165.<br>
[0047]	First and second power paths (ring gear member 124 and transfer<br>
member 158 being the first power path, ring gear member 134 and transfer member<br>
156 being the second power path) are provided in the transmission 114. The first<br>
power path is used whenever the output clutch OC is engaged. The second power path<br>
is used whenever output brake OB is engaged.<br>
[0048]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been<br>
described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will<br>
