				<td>AN APPARATUS TO BETTER DISTRIBUTE AN INSECT REPELLANT OR<br>
FRAGRANCE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to an apparatus (typically in the form of<br>
a small box) which can better distribute the smoke from a mosquito<br>
coil/candle etc or which can better distribute the vapour from a vaporiser. In a<br>
broad form, the invention is directed to a fan containing apparatus which can<br>
better distribute any type of beneficial vapour/smoke/gas etc. The beneficial<br>
action may comprise an insect repellent, a fragrance, a deodorizing agent and<br>
the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A very common way to deter or repel mosquitoes and biting<br>
insects is to place a mosquito coil or a mosquito candle in the area where the<br>
deterrent effect is required. The smoke from the mosquito coil and the<br>
vapour from the mosquito candle provides a deterrent to biting insects. A<br>
disadvantage with these coils and candles is that the effective deterrent area<br>
is not very large. If the mosquito coil or candle is placed in a closed room, it<br>
is found that the greatest deterrent occurs above the coil or candle as the<br>
smoke/vapours tend to move upwardly. Conversely, if the mosquito coil or<br>
candle is placed outside, a breeze will tend to blow the smoke/vapour away<br>
from the deterrent area.<br>
With mosquitoes, it is noticed that mosquitoes tend to<br>
congregate in certain areas. In a room, it is noticed that mosquitoes tend to<br>
congregate about the corners of the room. However, the smoke from the<br>
mosquito coil or the vapour from a mosquito candle does not effectively<br>
extend into this area.<br>
Many types of vaporising devices are known. One common type<br>
of vaporising device is electrically operated and can be plugged into a power<br>
socket. The device contains a small reservoir of liquid repellent/fragrance/<br>
deodorizing agent etc and contains a small heating device which heats the<br>
liquid or a proportion of liquid. Again, a disadvantage with this device is that<br>
the treatment area is not very large. To properly deodorise an entire room, or<br>
to provide a repelling action in an entire room, it takes a long time before the<br>
vapours/smoke extend throughout the room.<br>
It will be clearly understood that, if a prior art publication is<br>
referred to herein, this reference does not constitute an admission that the<br>
publication forms part of the common general knowledge in the art in<br>
Australia or in any other country.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a simple yet extremely<br>
useful device or apparatus which can assist in dispersing the smoke from a<br>
mosquito coil, the vapour from a mosquito candle, the vapour from a<br>
vaporiser etc in a more efficient manner.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus which<br>
may overcome at least some of the above-mentioned disadvantages and/or<br>
provide the public with a useful or commercial choice.<br>
In one form, the invention resides in an apparatus to dispense a<br>
beneficial gas/smoke/vapour, the apparatus having an enclosure, the<br>
enclosure adapted to contain a gas/smoke/vapour generating device, a fan to<br>
pass air at least partially through the enclosure and to entrain at least some of<br>
the gas/smoke/vapour, an outlet through which the gas/smoke/vapour can<br>
pass.<br>
The term "beneficial gas/smoke vapour" includes the smoke<br>
from a mosquito coil, vapours from a vapourising device such as a candle, an<br>
electrically operated vapouriser, and other devices that generate a<br>
smoke/gas/vapour that repels, kills or otherwise deters insects, moths and<br>
other undesirable creatures.<br>
It is preferred that an elongate tube is provided, and that the<br>
tube has at least one opening which is operatively associated with the outlet<br>
such that gas/smoke/vapour passing through the outlet passes at least<br>
partially through the tube. The tube may have a length of between 1-10 m or<br>
even more, and may have a diameter of between 5-50 mm or even more.<br>
The tube may be perforated at least partially along its length and therefore<br>
make comprise a perforated ducting. Preferably, the tube is perforated along<br>
its length which allows the smoke/gas/vapour to pass out of the perforations.<br>
The tube may comprise a tube having sections which are not perforated and<br>
sections which are perforated. The smoke/gas/vapour will pass along the non<br>
perforated section of the tube and through the openings in the perforated<br>
section of the tube. This allows the tube to be laid in such a manner that the<br>
smoke/gas/vapour only passes into a desired area. This can be achieved, if<br>
necessary, by providing separate tubes which can be fitted together with one<br>
tube not been perforated and another tube being perforated. This concept<br>
can be extended to include tube lengths having different types, sizes and<br>
numbers of perforations to control the volume of smoke/gas/vapour passing<br>
out of the tube at any particular place.<br>
The tube, or perforated ducting, can be made of any suitable<br>
material which may include plastics. The tube is preferably sufficiently flexible<br>
to allow it to be placed in desired areas.<br>
The tube may have closeable openings to provide versatility to<br>
the device. This can be in the form of a collar which is slideable over the tube<br>
and which can close off some openings. Valves, taps and the like can also be<br>
present to direct the smoke to desired parts of the tube.<br>
The tube may be substantially circular if desired although this is<br>
not necessary. Alternatively, the tube may be rectangular, oval, or have other<br>
shapes. It is considered that the tube may have a discreet or "low-profile"<br>
and this can be achieved by giving the tube a flattened oval shape, or giving<br>
the tube a rectangular shape having a low-profile.<br>
The tube may be positioned along the ground to enable the<br>
smoke etc to be directed into a suitable region. In one form, the tube may be<br>
simply laid along the ground. However, the tube may also be suspended<br>
from a wall, post, or anchored to the ground or otherwise placed in position.<br>
Thus, the invention may also comprise fasteners, attachment, clips, or other<br>
types of accessories to enable the tube to be placed in a desired position.<br>
These fasteners etc may be separate and the tube may be attached to the<br>
fasteners; alternatively, the fasteners make comprise part of the tube or may<br>
be otherwise attached to the tube.<br>
Suitably, the fan passes air from outside the enclosure and into<br>
the enclosure. In this manner, the smoke laden air does not pass through the<br>
fan. However, in another form, the fan may form part of a fan enclosure<br>
which has an inlet and an outlet, the inlet of the fan enclosure being in<br>
communication with the enclosure, and the outlet of the fan enclosure being<br>
in communication with the outside of the apparatus. In this version of the<br>
invention, the smoke laden air does pass through the fan.<br>
In another form, the invention resides in an apparatus, the<br>
apparatus having a first enclosure adapted to contain a mosquito<br>
coil/candle/vaporising device, an inlet to allow air to pass into the first<br>
enclosure, a fan enclosure which has an inlet and an outlet, a fan, the inlet of<br>
the fan enclosure being in communication with the first enclosure, and the<br>
outlet of the fan enclosure being in communication with the outside of the<br>
apparatus.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the invention, a commercially available<br>
mosquito coil or mosquito candle can be lit and placed in the enclosure. The<br>
fan can then be started which will blow the smoke containing air more<br>
vigorously into a room/outside area etc.. There is no need to provide a<br>
complicated system to produce the smoke/vapour as the apparatus allows a<br>
conventional mosquito coil, mosquito candle etc to be used.<br>
In an extremely broad form, the invention can comprise an<br>
apparatus having a single enclosure in which the mosquito coil etc can be<br>
placed. A fan can blow air through the enclosure and through an outlet to<br>
direct smoke laden air to a desired area. The fan can be placed in the<br>
enclosure, next to the enclosure etc. The fan can be reversed such that the<br>
air can be sucked through the enclosure from the outlet and through the inlet.<br>
Other changes and modifications are envisaged.<br>
The apparatus is typically box shaped in configuration and small<br>
enough to be placed on the ground, on a shelf, on a stand etc. However,<br>
there is no need for the apparatus to be box shaped and other types of<br>
shapes are envisaged. However, the apparatus will typically have a top wall,<br>
a bottom wall, a rear-wall, sidewalls and a front wall. The enclosure should<br>
be large enough to accommodate the mosquito coil etc which is to be placed<br>
in the enclosure. The size of this can vary to suit.<br>
The enclosure typically has an air inlet to allow air to pass into<br>
the enclosure. The air inlet may comprise a series of perforations in one or<br>
more walls of the enclosure, although other arrangements are envisaged.<br>
The enclosure is typically provided with some form of door/flap<br>
or other type of access means to allow the mosquito coil etc to be placed into<br>
the first enclosure. Typically, a side wall of the apparatus is hinged to provide<br>
 a door. It is preferred that one side wall is hinged by a top horizontal hinge<br>
which means that the door will naturally fall to a closed position. This allows<br>
the apparatus to be simple in design.<br>
It is preferred that the air inlet comprises one or more apertures<br>
in the door. Thus, the door can be seen as a vented door. However, the air<br>
inlet may be another part of the apparatus. For instance, if the fan draws air<br>
from the outside of the enclosure, the air inlet may comprise the inlet of the<br>
fan.<br>
It is preferred that the enclosure is made of heat resistant<br>
material. This minimises any chance of damage to the first enclosure by<br>
virtue of a mosquito candle, a lit mosquito coil etc.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the apparatus may<br>
comprise a pressurised unit. In this version, the fan may have an inlet<br>
communicating with the outside of the enclosure, and an outlet<br>
communicating with the inside of the enclosure. Thus, air is blown into the<br>
inside of the enclosure causing a degree of pressurisation. The enclosure<br>
may comprise an outlet through which the pressurised air can pass. The<br>
outlet may be attached to or otherwise in communication with a perforated<br>
ducting as described above. Suitably, the mosquito coil/candle/vaporising<br>
device etc is positioned in the enclosure.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the apparatus is<br>
provided with a venturi. The venturi may comprise a tube in the enclosure.<br>
One end of the tube is associated with the fan outlet such that pressurised air<br>
blows from the fan outlet and into the venturi. The other end of the venturi<br>
can be associated with the outlet. As the air blows into the venturi, it provides<br>
a region of low-pressure which sucks in adjacent air. The adjacent air<br>
comprises the smoke/gas/vapour laden air in the enclosure. An advantage of<br>
this arrangement is that smoke does not pass through the fan.<br>
The apparatus may have a fan enclosure. The fan enclosure<br>
typically comprises a shroud about a fan, the shroud having an inlet and an<br>
outlet. Other types of arrangements are envisaged however it is preferred<br>
that the design of the fan and fan enclosure is such that there is little mixing<br>
of incoming air and exiting air as the function of the fan is to blow the<br>
smoke/vapour laden air out of the apparatus. The fan enclosure may be<br>
formed in a second enclosure of the apparatus. The second enclosure may<br>
be separated from the first enclosure and this can be achieved using a<br>
partition wall and the like. This arrangement can prevent damage to the fan.<br>
The inlet of the fan enclosure may be in communication with the first<br>
enclosure. Typically, the fan enclosure is attached to one wall of the first<br>
enclosure, and an opening is provided in the wall to allow air to pass into the<br>
inlet of the fan enclosure. If desired, a screen, filter etc may be provided. The<br>
outlet of the fan enclosure can communicate with the outside of the<br>
apparatus. In a simple form the outlet may communicate with or be part of a<br>
tube, conduit, or other type of enclosure which funnels the air passing through<br>
the outlet towards an outlet in the apparatus.<br>
The outlet in the apparatus may comprise a valve or other type<br>
of opening. The advantage of this arrangement is that a flexible hose can be<br>
attached to the outlet. The hose may be perforated and blocked at the end to<br>
force the mosquito coil smoke etc to pass through the perforations in the<br>
hose. The hose may be several metres long and may be placed wherever<br>
necessary in a room or an outdoor area to provide a much greater repellent<br>
action than would be possible with a single mosquito coil or even a number of<br>
mosquito coils. Thus, one advantage of the apparatus is that a single<br>
mosquito coil/mosquito candle can be as effective in a larger area which<br>
previously would require a large number of candles/coils etc. Moreover, by<br>
using the flexible hose the repellent smoke/vapour etc can be channelled to<br>
precisely where needed.<br>
Alternatively, the apparatus may be provided with a second<br>
enclosure/third enclosure and like which may be provided with an open top,<br>
an elongate slot etc to allow smoke/vapour to pass from the apparatus. While<br>
this arrangement does not contain a flexible hose, it will still disperse the<br>
smoke/vapour more efficiently.<br>
The fan may be electrically powered. In one form of the<br>
invention, the fan may be powered by a battery. In another form of the<br>
invention, the fan may be powered by a rechargeable battery and the battery<br>
can be recharged from a power source using conventional techniques. In<br>
another form, the fan may be powered from a vehicle cigarette lighter socket,<br>
or mains power. It is envisaged that the fan may also be solar powered. It is<br>
envisaged that the fan may be a variable speed fan and some form of control<br>
knob etc can be provided to adjust the rotational speed of the fan. The fan<br>
may be controlled by an on/off switch or by any other suitable means.<br>
The apparatus need not be limited to use with a mosquito coil,<br>
mosquito candle, an oil or any other product which is lit or burnt to provide the<br>
repellent action. For instance, the apparatus is sufficiently versatile to enable<br>
it to be used with a vaporising device. A typical well-known vaporising device<br>
plugs into a power socket. Therefore, the apparatus may be provided with a<br>
power socket in the first enclosure to enable a conventional vaporising device<br>
to be simply plugged into the socket in the first enclosure.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to<br>
the following drawings in which :<br>

candle etc.<br>

a pressurised unit.<br>
Figure 4. Illustrates a further embodiment of the apparatus containing a<br>
venturi.<br>
BEST MODE<br>
Referring to the drawings and initially to figure 1 there is<br>
illustrated an apparatus 10 which can better disperse a<br>
repellent/fragrance/deodorising composition etc in a particular area. The<br>
apparatus 10 is substantially box like and can have a length of between 20-60<br>
cm, a width of between 10-40 cm and a height of between 10-30 cm. These<br>
dimensions can of course vary to suit. The apparatus can be made of any<br>
suitable material but it is preferred that the material is substantially waterproof<br>
(to allow the apparatus to be used outdoors) and fireproof (to allow a<br>
mosquito candle etc. to be placed in the apparatus). Thus, the material may<br>
comprise metal, fibre cement and the like.<br>
The apparatus has a top wall, a bottom wall, a rear wall, a pair<br>
of closed sidewalls, and a front wall, these walls being substantially<br>
continuous and attached to form a substantially enclosed container.<br>
However, the front wall comprises a door 11. Door 11 is hinged at the top by<br>
a horizontal hinge 12 which allows the door to naturally fall into a closed<br>
position allowing the door to have a very simple yet effective design.<br>
However, the door can also be hinged by a bottom hinge, a side hinge, can<br>
be a sliding door, a clip on door or any other type of door.<br>
The door forms one side of a first enclosure 13. The first<br>
enclosure 13 is large enough to hold a mosquito coil/mosquito candle or any<br>
other device which is to be placed within the first enclosure. The first<br>
enclosure is defined by part of the top wail, part of the bottom wall, and part of<br>
each side wall as well as the door 11. In the particular embodiment, the rear<br>
wall does not form part of the first enclosure. Door 11 is provided with an<br>
array of vent openings 14 to allow air to pass into the first enclosure. While<br>
this is a simple arrangement, the invention is not to be limited to this particular<br>
type of air inlet to the first enclosure.<br>
The first enclosure 13 is also defined by an intermediate<br>
partition wall 15. Wall 15 is provided with an opening which forms part of the<br>
inlet to the fan enclosure 16. The partition wall 15 is spaced from rear wall 17<br>
to form a second area 18 which is separated from the first enclosure 13.<br>
The second area 18 contains the fan enclosure 16. The fan<br>
enclosure 16 is a cylindrical shroud which passes about the fan. The<br>
enclosure 16 has a fan inlet which extends into the first enclosure 13, and a<br>
fan outlet which comprises a tapering tube 19 which tapers to an outlet 20<br>
passing through a side wall of the container. The outlet 20 allows a flexible<br>
perforated hose 21 to be attached to the outlet. The hose 21 can have any<br>
suitable length and diameter and allows the exhaust from the fan (containing<br>
the mosquito smoke etc) to be dispersed to any suitable area simply by<br>
positioning the perforated hose in that area. This provides a<br>
real and substantial advantage over other devices.<br>
The fan can be powered either by a 12 volt power source<br>
(typically a vehicle cigarette lighter) or by a transformer to<br>
transform mains power into a lower voltage. In the embodiment, a<br>
power socket 22 is provided on one side wall into which the<br>
cigarette lighter attachment can plug or into which the<br>
transformer can plug, providing versatility to the apparatus.<br>
When camping, the apparatus can be placed next to a campsite<br>
and can be powered by the cigarette lighter attachment in a<br>
vehicle. The flexible hose 21 can be positioned around the area<br>
which is to be protected. In a house, the apparatus can be placed<br>
on the ground or anywhere else and the flexible hose can be<br>
placed against the wall of the room as an extremely efficient and<br>
effective deterrent. It is also found that use of the fan<br>
provides better burning of a mosquito coil by providing a<br>
continual draft of air to assist in the burning action. This<br>
again adds to the efficiency of the apparatus.<br>
Referring to figure 2, there is described an apparatus which<br>
is similar to the apparatus of figure 1 except that one wall of<br>
the first enclosure 13 is provided with a socket 29 to enable a<br>
plug in vaporiser 26 to be simply plugged into the socket 26<br>
inside enclosure 13. A fan 27 can then be operated to suck air<br>
through the first enclosure in a manner similar to that described<br>
above. In this arrangement and other compartment 28 is provided.<br>
This compartment can contain the rear portion of socket 29 and<br>
can be electrically insulated from the remainder of the<br>
container.<br>
Referring to figure 3, there is illustrated a pressurised<br>
unit. One advantage of this unit is that the smoke laden air does<br>
not pass through the fan. The unit comprises a box like housing<br>
3O. At the bottom of the housing is a fan 31. The fan 31 draws<br>
air into housing 30 through a number of air inlet openings 32.<br>
The openings 32 communicate with the outside of housing 30.<br>
A mosquito coi1/candle/repellent 33 is positioned<br>
above fan 31. This material is placed in a tray 34. The tray is<br>
made of solid material and is positioned above fan 31. As the<br>
fan blows air against the bottom of tray 34, the air passes<br>
around the sides of the tray and towards outlet 39. During this<br>
process, the smoke from the mosquito coil etc will be mixed with<br>
the air such that smoke laden air will pass through outlet 39.Tray<br>
34 prevents the coil etc from burning to quickly by preventing air<br>
from blowing directly against the coil. The unit can also contain<br>
a vaporising device (not illustrated) which can be plugged into<br>
plug 36 and this can be connected to a source of electrical<br>
power in a manner already described above which may include<br>
mains power via a transformer 37 or battery power via a cigarette<br>
lighter socket 38. Ofcourse, other types of power sources are<br>
envisaged such as solar power etc. The outlet 35 communicates<br>
with the perforated ducting 39 already described above which<br>
allows the smoke laden air to be dispensed in any desirable<br>
place.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates another variation which again has the<br>
benefit of preventing smoke laden passing through the fan. This<br>
variation can be seen as the "venturi variation". In this<br>
variation, a venturi pipe 4O is provided, one end of which forms<br>
the outlet 41. The perforated ducting 39 is connected to outlet<br>
41 in a manner similar to that described above. The outher end of<br>
the venturi has a flared opening 42. The fan 43 draws air in from<br>
the outside of the unit through a fan housing 44 which has a<br>
nozzle like outlet 45 which blows pressurized air into the flared<br>
opening 42. By doing so* an area of low—pressure is created which<br>
sucks adjacent air through venturi 4O. The adjacent air is the<br>
smoke/vapor laden air inside the unit. The unit contains the<br>
mosquito coil/candle or a vaporising device similar to that<br>
described above. An advantage of this arrangement is that the<br>
unit is not pressurized. Further inlet openings 43 are provided<br>
in the vented door 46 to replace air which passes through the<br>
venturi by virtue of the "venturi effect".<br>
It should be appreciated that various other changes and<br>
modifications can be made to any embodiment described without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
