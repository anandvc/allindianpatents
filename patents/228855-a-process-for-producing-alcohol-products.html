ALCOHOL PRODUCT PROCESSES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to processes for production of an alcohol product from granular starch comprising a pre-treatment at an elevated temperature below the initial gelatinization temperature of the granular starch followed by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Granular starch is found in grains, cereals or tubers of plants. The granular starch is in the form of microscopic granules, which are insoluble in water at room temperature. When an aqueous starch slurry is heated, the granules swell and eventually burst, dispersing the starch molecules into the solution. During this "gelatinization" process, there is a dramatic increase in viscosity. Because the solids level is 30-40% in a typical industrial process, the starch has to be thinned or "liquefied" so that it can be handled. This reduction in viscosity is generally accomplished by enzymatic degradation in a process referred to as liquefaction. During liquefaction, the long-chained starch is degraded into smaller branched and linear chains of glucose units (dextrins) by an alpha-amylase.<br>
A conventional enzymatic liquefaction process may be carried out as a three-step hot slurry process. The slurry is heated to between 80-85° and thermostable alpha-amylase added to initiate liquefaction. The slurry is then jet-cooked at a temperature between 105-125°C to complete gelatinization of the slurry, cooled to 60-95°C and, generally, additional alpha-amylase is added to finalize hydrolysis. The liquefaction process is generally carried out at pH between 5 and 6. Milled and liquefied whole grains are known as mash.<br>
During saccharification, the dextrins from the liquefaction are further hydrolyzed to produce low molecular sugars DP1-3 that can be metabolized by yeast. The hydrolysis is typically accomplished using glucoamylases, alternatively or in addition to glucoamylases, alpha-glucosidases and/or acid alpha-amylases can be used. A full saccharification step typically last up to 72 hours, however, it is common only to do a pre*saccharification of, e.g., 40-90 minutes at a temperature above 50°C, followed by a complete saccharification during fermentation in a process known as simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF).<br>
Fermentation, may be performed using a yeast, e.g., from Saccharomyces spp.t which added to the mash. When the alcohol product is recovered ethanol, e.g. fuel, potable, or industrial ethanol, the fermentation is carried out, for typically 35-60 hours at a temperature of typically around 32°C. When the alcohol product is beer, the fermentation is carried out, for<br><br>
typically up to 8 days at a temperature of typically around 14°C<br>
Following fermentation, the mash may be used, e.g. as a beer, or distilled to recover ethanol. The ethanol may be used as, e.g., fuel ethanol, drinking ethanol, and/or industrial ethanol.<br>
It will be apparent from the above discussion that the starch hydrolysis in a conventional alcohol product process is very energy consuming due to the different temperature requirements during the various steps. US Patent No, 4,316,956 provides a fermentation process for conversion of granular starch into ethanol. The European Patent EP0140410B2 provides an enzyme composition for starch hydrolysis. The object of the present invention is to provide improved processes for conversion of granular starch into alcohol products.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods for producing an alcohol product from granular starch without prior gelatinization of said starch. Accordingly in a first aspect, the invention provides a process for production of an alcohol product comprising the sequential steps of: (a) providing a slurry comprising water and granular starch, (b) holding said slurry in the presence of an acid alpha-amylase and a glucoamylase at a temperature of 0°C to 20°C below the initial gelatinization temperature of said granular starch for a period of 5 minutes to 12 hours, (c) holding said slurry in the presence of an acid alpha-amylase, and a glucoamylase, and a yeast at a temperature of between 10°C and 35°C for a period of 20 to 250 hours to produce ethanol and, (d) optionally recovering the ethanol.<br>
Although not limited to any one theory of operation, the present invention, in particular, process step (b), is believed to result in swelling of starch granules enclosed in the plant cells resulting in the disruption of cell walls and release of the starch granules thereby rendering the starch granules more accessible to further hydration and the action of the enzymes. As hydration progresses through step (b), the acid alpha-amylase degrades the starch granules to produce dextrins, which are degraded by the glucoamylase into glucose. This process continues during step (c) in which the glucose is continuously fermented to ethanol by the yeast, thereby maintaining the concentration of fermentable sugar at a relatively low concentration throughout the fermentation. Without being limited to any one theory of operation, it is believed that due to the low concentration of sugars present during fermentation, the production of glycerol by the yeast is decreased as there is a limited need for glycerol for osmoregulation. In this regard, the present invention may be used to produce an alcohol product which has a reduced glycerol and/or methanol content compared to conventional processes.<br>
The present invention provides a less energy consuming alternative to conventional processes which must employ significant amounts of energy to gelatinize the starch slurry.<br><br>
Other advantages of the present invention include, without limitation, the ability to employ a low pH throughout the process, thus reducing the risk of unwanted microbial growth, and reducing or eliminating the need for expensive equipment to gelatinize the starch, such as, jetting installations and steam plant equipment.<br>
In a second aspect the present invention relates to an enzyme composition comprising an acid alpha-amylase and a glucoamylase, wherein the ratio between the acid alpha-amylase activity and glucoamylase activity is from 0.30 to 5.00 AFAU/AGU wherein an additional enzyme activity is present; said enzyme activity is selected from the list consisting of cellulase, xylanase and phytase.<br>
In a third aspect the present invention relates to a use of the enzyme composition of the second aspect in an alcohol product process or a starch hydrolysis process.<br>
In a fourth aspect the present invention relates to a use of an enzyme composition comprising an acid alpha-amylase and a glucoamylase, wherein the ratio between the acid alpha-amylase activity and glucoamylase activity is from 0.30 to 5.00 AFAU/AGU, in an alcohol product process comprising hydrolysis of granular starch.<br>
In a sixth aspect the present invention relates to a mashing process comprising application of an acid alpha-amylase.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The term "alcohol product" means a product comprising ethanol, e.g. fuel ethanol, potable and industrial ethanol. However, the alcohol product may also be a beer, which beer may be any type of beer. Preferred beer types comprise ales, stouts, porters, lagers, bitters, malt liquors, happoushu, high-alcohol beer, low-alcohol beer, low-calorie beer or light beer.<br>
The term "granular starch" means raw uncooked starch, i.e. starch in its natural form found in cereal, tubers or grains. Starch is formed within plant cells as tiny granules insoluble in water. When put in cold water, the starch granules may absorb a small amount of the liquid and swell. At temperatures up to 50°C to 75°C the swelling may be reversible. However, with higher temperatures an irreversible swelling called gelatinization begins.<br>
The term "initial gelatinization temperature" means the lowest temperature at which gelatinization of the starch commences. Starch heated in water begins to gelatinize between 50*C and 75*C; the exact temperature of gelatinization depends on the specific starch, and can readily be determined by the skilled artisan. Thus, the initial gelatinization temperature may vary according to the plant species, to the particular variety of the plant species as well as with the growth conditions. In the context of this invention the initial gelatinization temperature of a given starch is the temperature at which birefringence is lost in 5% of the starch granules using the method described by Gorinstein. S. and LB. C, Starch/StSrke, Vol. 44 (12) pp. 461-466 (1992).<br><br>

The following settings for polypeptide sequence comparison are used: GAP creation penalty of 3.0 and GAP extension penalty of 0.1.<br>
The term "acid alpha-amylase" means an alpha-amylase (E.C. 3.2.1.1) which added in an effective amount has activity at a pH in the range of 3.0 to 7.0, preferably from 3.5 to 6.0, or more preferably from 4.0-5.0. Any suitable acid alpha-amylase may be used in the present invention.<br>

ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS<br>
In a sixth aspect of the invention an acid alpha-amylase, such as an acid alpha-amylase derived from a fungus, preferably of the genus Aspergillus, preferably from the species A niger, and most preferably having at least 50 %, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or even at least 90% homology to the sequence shown in SEQ ID No:1 is used in a brewing process.<br>
Brewing processes are well-known in the art, and generally involve the steps of malting, mashing, and fermentation. In the traditional brewing process the malting serves the purpose of<br><br>
converting insoluble starch to soluble starch, reducing complex proteins, generating color and flavor compounds, generating nutrients for yeast development, and the development of enzymes. The three main steps of the malting process are steeping, germination, and kilning.<br>
Steeping includes mixing the barley kernels with water to raise the moisture level and activate the metabolic processes of the dormant kernel. In the next step, the wet barley is germinated by maintaining it at a suitable temperature and humidity level until adequate modification, i.e. such as degradation of starch and activation of enzymes, has been achieved. The final step is to dry the green malt in the kiln.<br>
Mashing is the process of converting starch from the milled barley malt and solid adjuncts into fermentable and unfermentable sugars to produce wort of the desired composition. Traditional mashing involves mixing milled barley malt and adjuncts with water at a set temperature and volume to continue the biochemical changes initiated during the malting process. The mashing process is conducted over a period of time at various temperatures in order to activate the endogenous enzymes responsible for the degradation of proteins and carbohydrates. By far the most important change brought about in mashing is the conversion of starch molecules into fermentable sugars. The principal enzymes responsible for starch conversion in a traditional mashing process are alpha- and beta-amylases. Alpha-amyiase very rapidly reduces insoluble and soluble starch by splitting starch molecules into many shorter chains that can be attacked by beta-amylase. The disaccharide produced is maltose.<br>
To day the double-mash infusion system is the most widely used system for industrial production of beer, especially lager type beer. This system prepares two separate mashes. It utilizes a cereal cooker for boiling adjuncts and a mash tun for well-modified, highly enzymatically active malts. As the traditionally mashing processes utilize the endogenous enzymes of the barley malt the temperature is maintained below 70°C as inactivation of the enzymes would otherwise occur.<br>
After mashing, when all the starch has been broken down, it is necessary to separate the liquid extract (the wort) from the solids (spent grains). Wort separation is important because the solids contain large amounts of protein, poorly modified starch, fatty material, silicates, and polyphenols (tannins). The objectives of wort separation include the following:<br>
•	to produce clear wort,<br>
•	to obtain good extract recovery, and<br>
•	to operate within the acceptable cycle time.<br>
Wort clarity, extraction recovery, and overall cycle times is greatly affected by the standard of the grist, e.g. the barley malt and the types of adjunct, as well as the applied mashing procedure.<br>
Following the separation of the wort from the spent grains the wort may be fermented<br><br>
with brewers yeast to produce a beer.<br>
Further information on conventional brewing processes may be found in 'Technology Brewing and Malting" by Wolfgang Kunze of the Research and Teaching Institute of Brewing, Berlin (VLB), 2nd revised Edition 1999, ISBN 3-921690-39-0.<br>
An acid alpha-amylase, such as an acid alpha-amyiase derived from a fungus, preferably of the genus Aspergillus, preferably from the species A niger, and most preferably having at least 50 %, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or even at least 90% homology to the sequence shown in SEQ ID No:1 be applied in any brewing process as a supplement to the enzymes comprised in the malted and/or unmalted grain or in a higher temperature mashing (HTM) process such as the one disclosed in WO 2004/011591.<br>
In the HTM process the temperature regime applied in the initial mashing phase ensures that the activity of the various endogenous enzymes of the barley malt or of the adjunct is significantly reduced or even eliminated. The high temperature process preferably comprises, forming a mash comprising between 5% and 100% barley malt, adding prior to, during or after forming the mash a mashing enzyme composition, attaining within 15 minutes of forming the mash an initial incubation temperature of at least 70°C, followed by incubation of the mash at a temperature of at least 70°C for a period of time, and separating the wort from the spent grains. Preferably the period of time of mashing is sufficient to achieve an extract recovery of at least 80%. The term "initial incubation temperature" is understood as the temperature regime during the initial part of the incubation in question.<br>
Thus at temperatures in the interval 70°C to 78°C only the barley malt alpha- and beta-amylases will exhibit notable activity, and at temperatures above 78°C the endogenous enzymes activity will be negligible. In such a mashing process the added mashing enzymes will thus constitute a very essential part of or all enzyme activity. According to one embodiment of the sixth aspect of the invention enzyme activities needed for the mashing process to proceed are exogenously supplied and may be added to the mash ingredients, e.g. the water or the grist before forming the mash, or it may be added during or after forming the mash.
