This invention relates to a process of producing a sustained release   glipizide composition.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
Glipizide is an oral blood-glucose lowering drug that is used to manage hyperglycemia in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Glipizide stimulates insulin secretion from the beta cells of pancreatic-islet tissue, increases the concentration of insulin in the pancreatic vein and may increase the number of insulin receptors.<br>
Glipizide (l-cyclohexyl-3-[ [ p-[2-(5-methylpyrazinecarboxamido) ethyl] phenyl] sulfonyl] urea), is an oral blood glucose lowering drug within the sulfonylurea class. Glipizide  is generally a white, odorless   compound. It is insoluble in water and alcohol, has a molecular weight of 445.55   and a pKa of 5.9.<br>
Monolithic systems (e.g. tablets) composed of hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic polymers and other excipients are commonly used for manufacturing sustained release dosage compositions of glipizide. Such systems, however, often result in a first order (non-linear) kinetic<br>
2<br><br>
release of glipizide. Glipizide is disproportionately released quickly after a patient ingests the sustained release glipizide composition which results in a spike in the level of medication present in the patient"s blood stream. This results in an uneven and inconsistent dosage of glipizide during the beginning of the prolonged period of time as compared to the latter portion of the prolonged period and this presents a significant drawback because diabetic patients can suffer various side effects from experiencing sudden spikes of glipizide.<br>
United States Patent No 5,945,125 (the ""125 patent") naming Kim Cherng-ju as inventor, describes a process of manufacturing a controlled release tablet with a water swellable polymer, non-crosslinked polyethylene oxide, with an average molecular weight in the range of 900,000 to 5,000,000. The water swellable polymer is chosen such that the swelling rate of the polymer is equal to the dissolution rate of the swollen polymer. The "125 patent is generally directed to controlled release compositions. Although the "125 patent mentions glipizide as one of several drugs that may be used therewith, it does not particularize the formulation and in vivo release   profile for glipizide.  Yet, the  "125<br>
3<br><br>
patent     does     discuss   release   profiles, in     greater   detail, for other pharmaceutical  drugs mentioned above.<br>
Glucotrol-XL® is a registered trade mark of Pfizer Inc., for glipizide-GITS (Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System). Glucotrol-XL® extended release tablets containing 2.5 to 20 mg glipizide, are commercially available to the public by prescription. The extended release of Glucotrol-XL® tablets is based on the osmotic and hydrostatic pressure system for drug release. However, these tablets typically possess lag times of 1 to 2 hours before the drug is released into the circulatory or endocrine system of the patient. The lag times may vary depending on the volume of gluids available in the patient"s gastrointestinal (G.I.) tract at the time of administration of the drug. This is because the release of the drug is dependent upon hydration and osmotic pressure generation. As water from the G.I. tract enters the glipizide-GITS tablet, pressure increases in the osmotic layer of the tablet and pushes against the drug layer of the tablet, thereby releasing glipizide into the gastrointestinal lumen.<br>
4<br><br>
The technology to commercially manufacture Glucotrol-XL® is complicated and costly. It is complicated because the process requires manufacturing a bilayer tablet with a drug compartment (an active layer) and an osmotic compartment (pharmacologically inert). The tablet is then coated with a semipermeable membrane polymer and an aperture is laser drilled on the drug compartment side for drug release. A further film coating is then applied. This process is costly because each of the steps of manufacture required specialized manufacturing equipment whose cost can exceed one million dollars. In addition, a great number of time and precision is required to produce the Glucotrol-XL® tablets.<br>
Studies	by   Berelowitz    M   Fischette   C    Cefalu   W<br>
Schade DS (Diabetes Care 1994 Dec; 17 (12); 1460-4), show that sustained release glipizide taken once a day by diabetic patients provides an effective mean glipizide concentration (&gt;50 ng/nl) twenty-four (24) hours after dosing, even at the lowest dosage level of 5 mg. Extended release glipizide was significantly more effective than immediate release glipizide in reducing fasting plasma glipizide (FPL) levels. Both the immediate release and sustained formations of glipizide<br>
5<br><br>
equally  reduced postprandial plasma glipizide levels. Glipizide-GITS, however, exerted its control in the presence of lower plasma glipizide concentration in comparison to the concentration of plasma glipizide in patients who ingested the immediate release glipizide. The sustained release glipizide also showed significantly lower insulin and C-peptidc levels.   This suggests that Glipizide-GITS improves   insulin sensitivity.<br>
What is needed is a pharmaceutical composition for the sustained release of glipizide that is relatively simple to manufacture on a commercial level and is also relatively inexpensive.<br>
What is also need is an efficient delivery system for sustained  release glipizide.<br>
What is also needed is a pharmaceutical composition for the sustained release glipizide that releases glipizide in conformity to a zero order kinetics.<br>
6<br><br>
What is further need is a pharmaceutical composition for the sustained release of glipizide that is effective at low plasma glipizide levels.<br>
What is further needed is a pharmaceutical composition for the sustained release of glipizide that is effective at low insulin and C-peptide levels.<br>
What is further needed is a pharmaceutical composition for the sustained release of glipizide that tends to increase insulin sensitivity.<br>
What is further needed is a pharmaceutical composition for the sustained release of glipizide that may be produced in granulated, powder,  tablet, slug  and/or capsule (including caplet) form.<br>
What is further needed is a method to manufacture a sustained release glipizide composition that results in a composition that meets one or more of the above described characteristics.<br>

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a simple, cost effective and efficient delivery system for sustained release glipizide on a commercial scale which results in a pharmaceutical composition that exhibits substantially the same therapeutic effect as presently available glipizide   compositions.<br>
The present invention provides a glipizide composition using hydrocolloid forming agents. The hydrocolloid forming agent is at least about 50% of the weight of the glipizide matrix. Glipizide is insoluble in water and when fabricated into matrix sustained release preparations, results in a release rate that is mainly dependent on the dissolution rate of the matrix rather than dependent on the diffusion through the matrix. In order to achieve an approximately zero order release rate (a linear constant release rate) over a prolonged period of time, a slow swelling composition with simultaneous erosion of the matrix of the composition is necessary. In the present invention selection of the proper molecular weight of the hydrophilic polymer and degree of substitution and combinations   thereof is important for attaining     an<br>
8<br><br>
approximately zero order release rate of glipizide through the matrix. The hydrophilic polymers and their combinations are chosen to equate the swelling rate of the polymer matrix to the dissolution rate of the polymer, thereby causing the release of glipizide predominantly by erosion and dissolution. The process of producing the sustained release composition, in one embodiment, comprises granulating glipizide, hydrophylic polymer and a diluent, drying the product and then lubricating it with a flow regulating   agent and lubricant.<br>
For a better understanding of the present invention, reference is made to the following description and accompanying figures, while the scope of the invention is   set forth in the appended claims.<br>

An in vivo bioavailability study conducted on 12 healthy volunteers with sustained release tablets of the present invention containing 5 mg glipizide, shows well sustained release plasma levels of glipizide over 24 hours with 50 to 60 ng / ml plasma concentration of glipizide after 24   hours.   As   suggested     in the literature, the commercially available<br>
17<br><br>
Glipizide-GITS system, is able to offer a sustained plasma levels of glipizide over 24 hours with the above referenced plasma glipizide and C-peptide levels. The present invention achieves plasma glipizide levels similar to those achieved by Glipizide-GITS 5 mg tablets and provides a much simpler way of formulating the same preparation in yet a relatively more economical and viable manner. This preparation can be made easily by utilizing known polymers and available equipment, proving its efficiencies over the costly and more difficult to make preparations of Glipizide-GITS. A discussion of several example employing the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention follows:<br>
Example 1:<br>
50 gm glipizide was mixed with 760 gm of Methocel® K 100 LV, 200 gm of Methocel® K-4M and 310 gmof lactose monohydrate. Each of these substances is readily available. The resulting mixture was granulated with a solution of 50 gm polyvinyl pyrrolidone in 800 gm isopropyl alcohol. The resulting dough mass was dried at 45°C for two hours and then sized through 2.4 mm screen to break the agglomerates.    These sized granules (1370 gm) were blended  with 10<br>
IS<br><br>
gm of colloidal silicone dioxide, l0 gm of talc and 20 gm of magnesium stearate and compressed into round tablets of each containing 5 mg of glipizide.<br>
The in vitro release of glipizide from these tablets was tested in hydrochloric acid solution at pH 1.2 for the first hour and then continued in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 USP. The results shown in Fig 1 show a substantially zero order kinetics release of glipizide throughout a twelve  hour period.<br>
In vivo bioavailability studies were performed on twelve (12) healthy human volunteers after oral administration of Glipizide SR tablet of Example 1 containing 5 mg of glipizide as per the present invention. The plasma glipizide concentration versus time over twenty-four hours from a single oral dose is shown in following Table 1.<br>
