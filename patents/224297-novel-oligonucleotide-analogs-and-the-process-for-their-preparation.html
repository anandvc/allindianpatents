The present invention relates to novel oligonucleotide analogs having useful physical, biological and pharmaco¬logical properties, and to a process for their prepara¬tion. Their application relates to use as inhibitors of gene expression (antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymee, sense oligonucleotides and triplex-forming oligonucleo¬tides) , as probes for the detection of nucleic acids and as auxiliaries in molecular biology.<br>
Oligonucleotides are applied to a growing extent as inhibitors of gene expression (J. F. Hilligan, H. D. Hatteucci and J. C. Martin, J. Med. Chem. 36 (1993) 1923; E. Uhlmann and A. Peyman, Chemical Reviews 90 (1990) 543; S. T. Crooks, Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32 (1992) 329) .<br>
Antisense oligonucleotides are nucleic acid fragments whose base sequence is complementary to an mRNA to be inhibited. This target mRNA can be of cellular, viral or other pathogenic origin. Possible cellular target sequences are, for example, those of receptors, enzymes, growth factors, ixnmunomodulators, ion channels or oncogenes. The inhibition of virus replication with the aid of antisense oligonucleotides was described, for example, for RSV (rous sarcoma virus), HSV-1 and -2 (herpes simplex virus type I and XI), HIV (human immuno¬deficiency virus) and influenza viruses. In this case, oligonucleotides are employed which are complementary to the viral nucleic acid.<br>
The sequence of sense oligonucleotides is designed, however, such that they bind ("capture"), for example, nucleic acid-binding proteins or nucleic acid-processing enzymes and  thus  inhibit  their biological activity<br><br>
(C. Helena and J. J. Toulme, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1049 (1990) 99) . Viral targets which may be mentioned here are, for example, reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase and transactivator proteins, in general, triplex-forming oligonucleotides have DNA as a target and, after binding to this, form a triple helical structure.<br>
Whereas with the aid of the antisense oligonucleotides, the processing (splicing etc.) of the mRNA or its trans¬lation into the protein are in general inhibited, triplex-forming oligonucleotides inhibit the tran¬scription or replication of the DNA (N. T. Thuong, and C. Helene, Angew. Chem. 105 (1993) 697; Uhlmann and Peyman, Chemical Reviews 90 (1990) 543). However, it is also possible to bind single-stranded nucleic acids with an antisense oligonucleotide in a first hybridization with formation of a double strand, which then forms a triplex structure in a second hybridization with a triplex-forming oligonucleotide. The antisense and triplex-binding regions can in this case either be accommodated in two separate oligonucleotides or else in one oligonucleotide.<br>
A further application of synthetic oligonucleotides are the so-called ribozymes, which destroy the target RHA as a result of their ribonuclease activity (D. Castanotto, J. J. Rossi, J. O. Deshler, Critical Rev. Eukar. Gene Expr. 2 (1992) 331).<br>
In DNA diagnosis, nucleic acid fragments with suitable labelling are employed as so-called DNA probes for the specific hybridization of a nucleic acid to be detected. The specific formation of the new double strand is in this case monitored with the aid of the labelling, which is preferably not radioactive. In this manner, genetic, malignant, viral or other pathogen-caused diseases can be detected.<br>
For most applications mentioned,  oligonucleotides in<br><br>
their naturally occurring form are not very suitable or completely unsuitable. They must be chemically modified such that they meet the specific requirements. In order that oligonucleotides can be employed in biological systems, for example for the inhibition of virus repli¬cation, they must fulfill the following requirements:<br>
1.	They must have a sufficiently high stability under in vivo conditions, i.e. both in serum and intracellularly.<br>
2.	They must be constituted such that they can pass through the cell and nucleus membrane.<br>
3.	They must bind to their target nucleic acid in base-specific manner under physiological conditions in order to display the inhibitory effect.<br>
These requirements are not indispensable for DNA probes; however, these oligonucleotides must be derivatized such that detection is possible, for example by means of fluorescence, chemiluminescence, colorimetry or specific staining (Beck and Roster, Anal. Cheat. 62 (1990) 2258).<br>
A multiplicity of chemical variations of oligonucleotides are known which have been synthesized with the aim of fulfilling the abovementioned requirements better than the unmodified oligonucleotides. The chemical modifica¬tion of the oligonucleotides is usually carried out by appropriately modifying the phosphate backbone, ribose unit or the nucleobases (Uhlmann and Peyman, Chemical Review 90 (1990) 543). The modifications also include those in which both the phosphate bridge and the sugar unit have been replaced by other groups, for example by "morpholinonucleoside" oligomers (E. P. Stirchak et al.. Nucleic Acids Res. 17 (1989) 6129) or "PNAs" (P. E. Nielsen et al, Bioconj. Chem. 5 (1994) 3). PNAs, in particular, are distinguished by unusually high affinities for target RNA, but suffer from other unfavorable properties such as lack of solubility or deficient cell penetration (W. Wang et al., Tetrahedron<br><br>
Letters 36 (1995) 1181; M. Egholm et al., in "Innovation and Perspectives in Solid Phase Synthesis, Peptides, Proteins, Nucleic Acids", Roger Epton, Ed. Mayflower Worldwide Limited, Birmingham, 1994, 145-148).<br>
It is therefore an object to find novel oligonucleotide analogs having favorable properties.<br>

Q and Q' can also be conjugates which favorably affect<br><br>
the properties of antisense oligonucleotides or of triple helix-forming oligonucleotides (such as, for example, cell penetration, nuclease degradation, affinity for the target RNA/DNA, pharmacokinetics) or serve as a label of a DNA probe or in the hybridization of the oligonucleo¬tide analog to the target nucleic acid attacks this with binding or crosslinking. Examples of these are conjugates with poly lysine, with intercalators such as pyrene, acridine, phenazine, phenanthridine, with fluorescent compounds such as fluorescein, with crosslinkers such as psoralen, azidoproflavine, with lipophilic molecules such as (C12-C20&gt;-alkyl, with lipids such as 1,2-dihexadecyl-rac-glycerol, with steroids such as cholesterol or testosterone, with vitamins such as vitamin E, with poly-or oligoathylene glycol, with (C12-Cia)-alkyl phosphate diesters, with -0-CH2-CH(OH)-0-(C12-C18)-alkyl.

Hanoharan in "Antisense Research and Applications", Crooke and Lebleu, Eds., CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993, Chapter 17, p.303ff and EP-A 0 552 766).

The invention further relates to compounds of the formula I in which Q and Q' are linked, i.e. form a cyclic molecule, where the possibility should still apply that Q and Q' together afford a single bond.

The invention further relates to oligonucleotides or modified oligonucleotides, for example PNAs, in which compounds of the formula I are incorporated at the 3'-end or at the 5'- end or at the 5'- and at the 3'-end.<br>
The linkage of the oligonucleotides with the compounds of the formula I is preferably carried out via the 5'- or 3'-hydroxy1 group of the nucleotide units, likewise via a phosphonic acid mono©star bond.

ifQandQ' = H)    with  oligonucleotides  or<br>
modified oligonucleotides, for example PNAs or other modifications, as are described above, will be schemati¬cally illustrated again (OLIGO is unmodified or modified oligonuleotides):<br><br>

5'- PMENA - OLIGO - PMENA<br>
5'- PMENA - (OLIGO - PMENA)a (a - 1-20)<br>
The synthesis of these combined compounds is carried out in such a way that, according to the molecule, the synthesis of the PMENA units, which is described in the following, is begun first, which are then coupled with the oligonucleotide units. In this process, the oligo¬nucleotides are coupled as monomer units or by block condensation by solid-phase synthesis or by solution synthesis by methods known to the person skilled in. the art (Sonveaux, Bioorganic Chemistry 14 (1986) 274ff), The condensations are alternatively carried out by the amidite method, the H-phosphonate method or the phosphorotriester process (Sonveaux, Bioorganic Chemistry 14 (1986) 274ff). If, conversely, PMENA units are coupled to OLIGO units, this is preferably carried out by the method described in f±). Conjugation with PNA units is carried out in the same manner or, if (monomeric or oligomeric) PNA units are coupled to PMENA units, with the methods of peptide synthesis or of ester synthesis known to the person skilled in the art.<br>

The compounds of the formula I are used as inhibitors of gene expression. The invention therefore further relates to the use of therapeutically active compounds according to the invention for the production of a pharmaceutical and to a process for the production of a pharmaceutical which comprises mixing the compounds according to the invention with a physiologically acceptable excipient and also, if appropriate, suitable additives and/or auxiliaries.<br>
Therapeutically active compounds are understood in general as meaning those which, on account of the sequence of the units B which correspond to the nucleobases, carry out a function as analogs of antisense oligonucleotides, triple helix-forming oligonucleotides, aptamers (RHA or DNA molecules which can bind to specific target molecules, e.g. proteins or receptors (e.g. L.C. Bock et al., Nature 1992, 355, 564) or ribozymes (catalytic RNA, s«e for example, Castanet to et al., Critical Rev. Eukar. Gene Expr. 1992, 2, 331), in particular as analogs of antisense oligonucleotides and triple helix-forming oligonucleotides.<br>
Moreover, the present invention further relates to the use of the compounds according to the invention as a diagnostic, for example for the detection of the presence or absence or the amount of a specific double-stranded or single-stranded nucleic acid molecule in a biological sample.<br>
For use according to the invention, the compounds accord¬ing to the invention have a length (n-1) of about 6 -100, preferably of about 10 - 40, in particular of about<br><br>
12 - 31 nucleotides. Otherwise, the preferred ranges, modifications or conjugations described above also apply here.<br>

The pharmaceuticals can be used, for example, in the form of pharmaceutical preparations which can be administered, for example, topically or orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, hard or soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. They can also be administered rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions. For the production of pharmaceutical preparations, these compounds can be processed in therapeutically inert organic and inorganic excipients. Examples of such excipients for tablets, coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules are lactose, maize starch or derivatives there¬of, talc and stearic acid or salts thereof. Suitable excipients for the production of solutions are water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and glucose. Suitable excipients for injection solutions are water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable excipients for suppositories are vegetable and hardened oils, waxes, fats and semiliquid polyols. The pharmaceutical prepara¬tions can also contain preservatives, solvents, stabiliz¬ers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, salts for changing the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating compositions, antioxidants, and also, if appropriate, other therapeutic active compounds. A preferred administration is oral administration. A further preferred form of administration is injection. For this, the antisense oligonucleotides are formulated in a liquid solution, preferably in a physiologically<br><br>
acceptable buffer, such as Hank's solution or Ringer's solution. The therapeutically active compounds according to the invention, however, can also be formulated in solid form and dissolved or suspended before use. The preferred dosages for systemic administration are about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight per day.<br>

The results can be seen in FIG. 2: (dA)9 runs faster than "5'-HO-T-P(OH)-T-P(OH)-T-P(OH)-T-P(0H)-T-P-(OH)-T-P(OH)-T-P-(OH)-T-P(OH)-T-P(OEt)2"and in the 1:1 mixture both can only be seen weakly, instead a slower band is formed which corresponds to a complex between the two components. In the 2:1 mixture, (dA)9 can no longer be seen, instead the new band is all the more distinct. The same applies for the 5:1 or 10:1 mixture, in which additionally the distinct excess of »5'-HO-T-P (OH)-T-P (OH)-T-P(OH)-T-P(OH)-T-P-(OH)-T-P(OH)-T-P-(OH)-T-P(OH)-T-P(OEt)2" can be detected.<br>
