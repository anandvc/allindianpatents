				<td>ELECTRIC MOTOR SYSTEMS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The inventive subject matter generally relates to electric motor<br>
systems, and more particularly relates to electric motor systems for use in a<br>
vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIVE SUBJECT MATTER<br>
[0002] In a DC-driven electric motor system that includes a single motor<br>
and two voltage sources, such as in a traction drive unit, the power of the<br>
system is typically increased by enlarging the motor, adding additional<br>
magnets to the motor, or boosting the available DC voltage with, for example,<br>
a conventional boost DC-DC converter. However, a larger motor requires<br>
additional space, additional magnets provide additional complexity, and<br>
boosting the available DC voltage burdens the motor with a higher current<br>
rating<br>
[0003] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an improved electric motor<br>
system topology capable of obtaining additional power output from a single<br>
motor system without adding complexity to the system or increasing the motor<br>
size. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the inventive<br>
subject matter will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description<br>
and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying<br>
drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIVE SUBJECT MATTER<br>
[0004] Electric motor systems are provided for use in vehicles. In an<br>
embodiment, by way of example only, the system includes a first inverter, a<br>
second inverter, and a motor electrically coupled to the first and the second<br>
inverters. The motor includes a stator including a plurality of slots formed<br>
therein and a plurality of windings. The plurality of windings is disposed at<br>
least partially in the slots and includes a first coil and a second coil. The first<br>
coil has a first number of turns, and the second coil has a second number of<br>
turns that is unequal to the first number of turns. The first coil of each<br>
winding is electrically coupled to the first inverter, and the second coil of each<br>
winding is electrically coupled to the second inverter.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0015] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the inventive subject matter or the application and<br>
uses of the inventive subject matter. Furthermore, there is no intention to be<br>
bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical<br>
field, background, brief summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0016] FIG. 1 depicts an electric motor system 100 for use in a vehicle.<br>
The electric motor system 100 may be implemented in any electric or hybrid-<br>
electric vehicle. In this regard, the electric motor system 100 includes at least<br>
a motor 102, two inverters 104,106, and two voltage sources 108, 110.<br>
[0017] In an embodiment, the motor 102 is a three-phase motor and<br>
includes a stator assembly 111 and a rotor assembly 113. The stator assembly<br>
111 includes three conductive windings 114, 116, 118. Turning to FIG. 2, a<br>
more detailed schematic of the system 100 including the stator assembly is<br>
shown. Each winding 114, 116, 118 has two legs L1 and L2. One leg L1 of<br>
each winding 114, 116, 118 is electrically coupled to the first inverter 104,<br>
while the other leg L2 of each winding 114, 116, 118, is electrically coupled to<br>
the second inverter 106.<br>
[0018] With reference back to FIG. 1, the rotor assembly 113 may be a<br>
conventional rotor (e.g., a PM rotor or an induction machine rotor) for use in a<br>
motor 102 and may have, for example, a stator core. In an embodiment, the<br><br>
motor 102 may additionally include a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant) (not shown)<br>
that circulates therethrough.<br>
[0019] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, each inverter 104, 106 may be<br>
a three-leg inverter connected to the motor 102 across the DC link by<br>
switching elements of the inverters 104, 106. The inverters 104, 106 may each<br>
include a first set of switching elements 120 connected between a high voltage<br>
side 124, 125 and a low voltage side 122 of one of the voltage sources 108 and<br>
a second set of switching elements 128 also connected between the high<br>
voltage side 124, 125 and the low voltage side 122 of the other source 110.<br>
The switching elements are preferably transistors, such as insulated gate<br>
bipolar transistors (IGBTs) or Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect<br>
Transistors (MOSFETs). In an embodiment, protective capacitors (not shown)<br>
may be connected between the high voltage side 124 and the low voltage side<br>
122 of the voltage sources 108, 110.<br>
[0020] Transistors 130, 132, 134 of the first set of switching elements 120<br>
are connected between the high voltage side 124, 125 and corresponding ones<br>
of a first set of nodes 136, 138, 140, each of the nodes 136, 138, 140<br>
connected to a first winding end of one of the plurality of windings 114, 116,<br>
118 of the motor 102. Transistors 131, 133, 135 of the first set of switching<br>
elements 120 are connected between the low voltage side 122 and<br>
corresponding ones of the first set of nodes 136, 138, 140.<br>
[0021] In accordance with the embodiment, transistors 142, 144, 146 of<br>
the second set of switching elements 128 are connected between the high<br>
voltage side 124, 125 and corresponding ones of a second set of nodes 148,<br>
150, 152, each of the nodes 148, 150, 152 connected to a second winding end<br>
of one of the plurality of windings 114, 116, 118 of the motor 102. Transistors<br>
143, 145, 147 are connected between the low voltage side 122 and<br>
corresponding ones of the second set of nodes 148, 150, 152.<br><br>
[0022] As alluded to above, the voltage sources 108, 110 are electrically<br>
coupled to a corresponding inverter 104, 106, respectively, and to the motor<br>
102, and each is configured to deliver DC current to the corresponding<br>
inverter 104, 106. In an embodiment, one voltage source ("first voltage<br>
source") 108 may be a fuel cell and the other voltage source ("second voltage<br>
source") 110 may be a battery. In such case, the fuel cell or first voltage<br>
source 108 may feed power or discharge power to the motor 102 and to the<br>
battery or second voltage source 110, while the second voltage source 110<br>
may discharge power to the motor 102 and may be fed power from or charged<br>
by the first voltage source 108. Because the first voltage source 108 can<br>
discharge power and the second voltage source 110 can both discharge power<br>
and be charged, the current rating of the windings 114, 116, 118 electrically<br>
coupling their corresponding inverters 104, 106 to the motor 102 may be<br>
configured such that each has a different maximum current carrying<br>
capability. Consequently, the current ratings of the windings 114, 116, 118<br>
may be unequal, in an embodiment.<br>
[0023] In order to optimize power distribution and usage in the electric<br>
motor system 100 using unequally rated windings 114, 116, 118, each winding<br>
114, 116, 118 is split into two coils, in an embodiment where each coil end is<br>
a leg, either L1 or L2, each coil is configured to be electrically isolated from<br>
each other, and each coil has a different current rating. As briefly mentioned<br>
above, the inverters 104, 106 are electrically coupled to the motor 102 such<br>
that one leg L1 of each winding 114, 116, 118 is electrically coupled to the<br>
first inverter 104, while the other leg L2 of each winding 114, 116, 118, is<br>
electrically coupled to the second inverter 106.<br><br>
[0024] With additional reference to FIGs. 3-5, planar views of the stator<br>
assembly 111 of the motor 102 is provided, according to various<br>
embodiments. It will be appreciated that the planar view is provided for ease<br>
of explanation to show how the unequally rated windings 114, 116, 118 may<br>
be disposed in the stator assembly 111 and that the stator assembly 111 may<br>
be formed as a cylinder. In any event, the stator assembly 111 includes a<br>
stator 115, a plurality of slots 1-12, and windings 114, 116, 118. Although<br>
thirteen slots are shown in the stator 115, it will be appreciated that a different<br>
number of slots may alternatively be included. The windings 114, 116, 118 are<br>
at least partially disposed in the slots 1-12 and are made up of two coils each.<br>
Winding 114 includes coil A1 and coil A2, winding 116 includes coil B1 and<br>
coil B2, and winding 118 includes coil C1 and coil C2. It will be appreciated<br>
that each coil may make one or more turns between the slots.<br>
[0025] In an embodiment, the windings 114, 116, 118 may be disposed in<br>
the stator assembly 111 such that no phase difference exists between two coils<br>
of the same winding. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, coil A1 of winding<br>
114 has a leg L1 that is connected to the first inverter 104 and makes several<br>
turns in a first pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 1 and 7). After making<br>
turns in the first pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 1 and 7), coil Al then<br>
makes turns in a second pair of non-adjacent slots, where a second slot (e.g.,<br>
slot 2) is adjacent a first slot (e.g., slot 1) of the first pair of non-adjacent slots<br>
and a second slot (e.g., slot 8) is adjacent a second slot (e.g., slot 7) of the first<br>
pair of non-adjacent slots. Leg L2 of winding 114 is then connected to the<br>
second inverter 106.<br>
[0026] Coil A2 may be disposed over coil A1. It will be appreciated that<br>
spatial terms or phrases, such as over, under, or on top of, are used simply to<br>
provide a spatial relationship between two components and that the<br>
components are not limited to such relationships. Thus, coil A2 similarly has<br>
a leg L1 that is connected to the first inverter 104 and makes several turns in<br><br>
the first pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 1 and 7). After making turns in<br>
the first pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 1 and 7), coil A2 then makes<br>
turns in the second pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 2 and 8). Leg L2 of<br>
coil A2 is then connected to the second inverter 106.<br>
[0027] Turning to FIG. 4, a planar view of the stator assembly 111 of the<br>
motor 102 is provided, according to another embodiment. The stator assembly<br>
111 includes both windings 114 and 116. As shown in FIG. 4, coil B1 of<br>
winding 116 makes turns in a third pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 3 and<br>
9) that are located such that the second pair of non-adjacent slots are between<br>
the first and the third pairs of non-adjacent slots. After making turns in the<br>
third pair of non-adjacent slots, coil B1 makes turns in a fourth pair of non-<br>
adjacent slots (e.g., slots 4 and 10) that are located such that the third pair of<br>
non-adjacent slots are between the second and fourth pairs of non-adjacent<br>
slots. Leg L1 of coils B1 is connected to the first inverter 104 and leg L2 of<br>
coil Bl is connected to the second inverter 106. Coil B2 is disposed over coil<br>
Bl. Thus, coil B2 similarly has a leg L1 that is connected to the first inverter<br>
104 and makes several turns in the third pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 3<br>
and 9). After making turns in the third pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 3<br>
and 9), coil B2 then makes turns in the fourth pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g.,<br>
slots 4 and 10). Leg L2 of coil B2 is then connected to the second inverter<br>
106.<br>
[0028] FIG. 5 is another planar view of the stator assembly 111 of the<br>
motor 102 is provided, according to an embodiment. Here, windings 114,<br>
116, 118 are shown. Coil C1 of winding 118 makes turns in a fifth pair of<br>
non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 5 and 11) that are located such that the fourth<br>
pair of non-adjacent slots are between the third and the fifth pairs of non-<br>
adjacent slots. After making turns in the fifth pair of non-adjacent slots, coil<br>
Cl makes turns in a sixth pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 6 and 12) that<br>
are located such that the fourth pair of non-adjacent slots are between the third<br><br>
and sixth pairs of non-adjacent slots. Leg L1 of coil C1 is connected to the<br>
first inverter 104 and leg L2 of coils Cl is connected to the second inverter<br>
106. Coil C2 is disposed over coil C1. Thus, coil C2 has a leg L1 that is<br>
connected to the first inverter 104 and makes several turns in the fifth pair of<br>
non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 5 and 11). After making turns in the fifth pair of<br>
non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 5 and 11), coil C2 then makes turns in the sixth<br>
pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 6 and 12). Leg L2 of coil C2 is then<br>
connected to the second inverter 106.<br>
[0029] In other embodiments shown in FIGs. 6-8, the windings 114, 116,<br>
118 may be disposed in the stator assembly 111 where a phase difference<br>
equivalent to one slot exists between two coils of the same winding. FIG. 6 is<br>
a planar view of the stator assembly of the motor, according to still another<br>
embodiment. In this embodiment, the stator assembly 111 includes a plurality<br>
of slots 1-13 and windings 114 is shown herein. Coil A1 of winding 114 has a<br>
leg L1 that is connected to the first inverter 104 and makes several turns in a<br>
first pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 1 and 7). After making turns in the<br>
first pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 1 and 7), coil Al makes turns in the<br>
second pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 2 and 8), where a first slot (e.g.,<br>
slot 2) is adjacent a first slot (e.g., slot 1) of the first pair of non-adjacent slots<br>
and a second slot (e.g., slot 8) is adjacent a second slot (e.g., slot 7) of the first<br>
pair of non-adjacent slots. Leg L2 of coil Al is then connected to the second<br>
inverter 106. Coil A2 of winding 114 makes turns in the second pair of non-<br>
adjacent slots (e.g., slots 2 and 8), and has a leg L1 that is connected to the<br>
first inverter 104. Coil A2 then makes turns in the third pair of non-adjacent<br>
slots (e.g., slots 3 and 9), where the third pair of non-adjacent slots is located<br>
such that the second pair of non-adjacent slots are between the first and the<br>
third pairs of non-adjacent slots. Leg L2 of coil A2 is connected to the second<br>
inverter 106.<br><br>
[0030] FIG. 7 is a planar view of the stator assembly of the motor,<br>
according to still another embodiment. Here, windings 114 and 116 are<br>
shown. Leg L1 of coil B1 is connected to the first inverter 104 and makes<br>
turns in the third pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 3 and 9). Coil Bl then<br>
continues on to make turns in a fourth pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 4<br>
and 10) that are located such that the third pair of non-adjacent slots are<br>
between the second and fourth pairs of non-adjacent slots. Leg of coil Bl is<br>
connected to the second inverter 106. Coil B2 of winding 116 makes turns in<br>
the fourth pair of non-adjacent slots, and has a leg L1 that is connected to the<br>
first inverter 104. Coil B2 then makes turns in a fifth pair of non-adjacent<br>
slots (e.g., slots 5 and 11), where the fifth pair of non-adjacent slots are located<br>
such that the fourth pair of non-adjacent slots are between the third and the<br>
fifth pairs of non-adjacent slots. Leg L2 of coil B2 is connected to the second<br>
inverter 106.<br>
[0031] FIG. 8 is a planar view of the stator assembly of the motor,<br>
according to still yet another embodiment. Here, windings 114, 116, 118 are<br>
shown. Leg L1 of coil C1 of winding 118 is connected to the first inverter 104<br>
and makes turns in the fifth pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 5 and 11).<br>
Coil Cl then continues on to make turns in a sixth pair of non-adjacent slots<br>
(e.g., slots 6 and 12) that are located such that the fifth pair of non-adjacent<br>
slots are between the fourth and sixth pairs of non-adjacent slots. Leg of coil<br>
C1 is connected to the second inverter 106. Coil C2 of winding 118 makes<br>
turns in the sixth pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 5 and 11), and has a leg<br>
 L1 that is connected to the first inverter 104. Coil C2 then makes turns in a<br>
seventh pair of non-adjacent slots (e.g., slots 6 and 12), where the seventh pair<br>
of non-adjacent slots are located such that the sixth pair of non-adjacent slots<br>
are between the fifth and the seventh pairs of non-adjacent slots. Leg L2 of<br>
coil C2 is connected to the second inverter 106.<br><br>
[0032] Regardless of the embodiment, because the windings 114, 116, 118<br>
are configured to have different current rating, the number of turns made by<br>
each coil A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2 may vary. Specifically, the stator assembly<br>
111 is configured such that the first coils A1, B1, C1 make a first number of<br>
turns in the slots 1-12, and the second coils A2, B2, C2 make a second number<br>
of turns in the slots 1-12 that is unequal to the first number of turns. In an<br>
embodiment illustrated in FIG. 9, a cross-section view of a slot 900 is<br>
provided. The slot 900 includes a first layer 902 made up of coil A1 and a<br>
second layer 904 made up of A2. As can be seen, coil Al is wound such that<br>
it has three turns in the slot 900. Coil A2 is wound such that it has nine turns<br>
in the slot 900. It will be appreciated that although coil A2 is depicted as<br>
being disposed over coil A1, this may not always be the case. Moreover, coil<br>
B1 may be disposed over or under coil B2, and coil Cl may be disposed over<br>
or under coil C2. Additionally, the number of turns may be different than<br>
shown.<br>
[0033] An electric motor system topology has now been provided that<br>
may be capable of obtaining additional power output from a single motor<br>
system without adding complexity to the system. Additionally, the system<br>
topology may be implemented in a vehicle and may not increase the motor<br>
size. The topology may also provide capabilities similar to those of a<br>
