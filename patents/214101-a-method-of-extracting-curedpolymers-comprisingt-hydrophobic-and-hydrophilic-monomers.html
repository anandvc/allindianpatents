This patent application claims priority from a provisional patent application<br>
U.S. Serial No.60/245,518 which was filed on November 3, 2000.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to solvents which may be used to extract polymers<br>
that are made of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Silicone hydrogels are polymers that contain both hydrophilic and<br>
hydrophobic monomers. When these polymers are used to produce contact<br>
lenses, these lenses have high oxygen permeability, good wettability, and good<br>
comfort.<br>
Contact lenses produced from silicone hydrogels are typically made by the<br>
following procedure. A mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers, as well<br>
as other components is placed in a lens mold and cured with light. After curing,<br>
the lenses, which remain attached to either the front curve or the back curve of<br>
the mold, are removed by releasing with a suitable solvent. Typically isopropanol,<br>
water or combinations thereof are used. After release, the lenses are extracted<br>
with alcohols and/or other organic solvents to remove unreacted hydrophobic<br>
monomers. Typically these lenses are extracted with hexane, methylene<br>
chloride, isopropanol, or ethanol. For water immiscible solvents, those solvents<br>
are removed by evaporation/drying prior to equilibration into aqueous solutions.<br>
For water miscible solvents, the lenses are equilibrated into aqueous solutions.<br>
Equilibration into aqueous solution will remove any remaining solvent, unreacted<br>
hydrophilic monomers, and hydrate the lenses. However, there are problems with<br>
this procedure.<br>
First, when the lenses are released using alcohol or alcohol/water<br>
mixtures, the lenses swell to a level where a fragile lens, that damages easily, is<br>
produced. Second, hydrophobic monomers have limited solubility in mixtures of<br>
alcohol and water, as well as some organic solvents. Therefore to<br>
extract those monomers lenses must be extracted with large volumes of these<br>
solvents and often the solvents must be heated. This presents problems when<br>
preparing lenses on a production scale due to the environmental concerns of<br>
disposing of large quantities of used solvents. In addition, due to the low flash<br>
points of the solvents which are currently used, heating those solvents<br>
presents additional hazards. Finally, the final hydration/equilibrium steps<br>
require the use of 100% aqueous solvents, such as deionized water, buffer<br>
solutions, saline solutions, or other packing solutions. When tenses that have<br>
been extracted with alcohols and/or many organic solvents are directly<br>
transferred to 100% aqueous solutions, there is an additional risk of damaging<br>
the lens due to the variability of swell of the polymer as well as the fragility of<br>
the resulting polymer.<br>
Therefore, there remains an unmet need for a method of processing<br>
cured polymers that addresses one or more of the problems described above.<br>
The invention described herein meets that need.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention includes a method of extracting cured polymers<br>
comprising hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers, where the method<br>
comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of the steps of treating the cured<br>
polymer with an extracting solvent, wherein said extracting solvent when<br>
measured at 25 °C<br>
(a) swells the cured polymer from about 0% to about 50% and<br>
(b) has Hansen Solubility Parameters within the ranges of<br>
As used herein, "cured polymers" include but are not limited to polymers<br>
containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers, hydrogels and silicone<br>
hydrogels where silicone hydrogels are the preferred polymers, The particularly<br>
preferred polymers are acquafilcon A, lotrafilcon and balafilcon A. The<br>
compositions of representative polymers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Ncs.<br>
5.260,000; 5,998,498; 6,087,415; 5,760,100; 5,776.999; 5,789, 461 5,849,811;<br>
5,965,631; US Pat. App. Serial Nos. 09/532,943; 09/652/817; and 09/957,299.<br>
These patents and patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference<br>
for the composition preparation, and treatment of the polymers contained<br>
therein. In addition, cured polymers includes polymers that are coated with<br>
hydrophilic coating such as polyacrylic acid, HEMA and the like. Methods of<br>
coating such polymers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. 6,087,415 and U.S. Pat. App.<br>
Ser. No. 09/921,192 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. All cured<br>
polymers of the invention may be formed into a number of useful devices which<br>
include but are not limited to contact lenses and intraocular lenses. Methods of<br>
forming said devices are known and include but are not limited to molding,<br>
cutting, or lathing.<br>
The term "monomer" refers to the building units (backbones, pendant<br>
groups and crosslinkers) that are covalentiy bound to one another within the<br>
structure of the cured polymer. Typical hydrophobic monomers include but are<br>
not limited to methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane ("TRIS").<br>
monomethacryloxypropyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane ("mPDMS"), and<br>
silicone macromers as described in U.S. Pats. 5,998,498; 6,087.415; US Pat.<br>
App. Serial Nos. 09/532,943; 09/652/817; and 09/957,299. Hydrophilic<br>
monomers include but are not limited to n-vinylpyrrolidone ("NVP"),<br>
N,N-dimethylacrylamide ("DMA"), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate ("HEMA"),<br>
methacrylic and acrylic acids, vinyl lactams, acrylamides, methacrylamide, vinyl<br>
carbonate and vinyl carbamate monomers which are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,070,215, and oxazolone monomers which are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No<br>
4,910,277. All aforementioned patents are hereby incorporated by reference in<br>
their entirety. The cured polymers may contain other hydrophobic and<br>
hydrophilic components, which include but are not limited to wetting agents and<br>
the like. Although those components may be extracted by the extracting<br>
solvents of the invention, it is preferred that those agents are not extracted by<br>
the extracting solvents of the invention.<br>
When the cured polymers are hydrogels those polymers have the<br>
property that they can absorb water into the matrix of the polymer. Typically<br>
cured polymers are treated with a solvent to remove any unreacted<br>
components (ca. monomers, macromers. crosslinkers), and subsequently the<br>
polymer is treated with an aqueous solution in order to hydrate the hydrogel.<br>
However, depending upon the solvent that was used to remove the unreacted<br>
components, the final hydration step cannot be carried out directly after<br>
treatment with the extracting solvent. For example, a cured polymer that was<br>
extracted with hexane can not be directly equilibrated in water without<br>
distorting the final polymer. Typically this problem is solved by treating the<br>
extracted polymer with a series of different solvents before the final aqueous<br>
equilibration step. One of the benefits of this invention is that when cured<br>
polymers are extracted using some of the extracting solvents of this invention,<br>
the polymers may be directly equilibrated into aqueous media immediately after<br>
extraction without using the step down procedure described above. Extracting<br>
solutions of the invention that have this advantage include but are not limited to<br>
85-90%-DPM/DI and 85-90% TPM. This presents a distinct advantage over<br>
the known extracting solutions, because it saves time and the cost of the extra<br>
steps.<br>
As used herein the swell of a cured polymer in a solvent is the<br>
percentage increase in diameter of a cured polymer and may be calculated by<br>
the either of the following formula<br>
%swell = 100 x [(lens diameter in extracting solvent - lens<br>
diameter in aqueous solution) / lens diameter in<br>
aqueous solution]<br>
The percentage of swell is greater than about 0 to about 50%, preferably,<br>
about 20 to about 40% and more preferably, about 25 to about 35%.<br>
In addition, the extracting solvents of the invention must have certain<br>
Hansen Solubility Parameters, namely 8H, SP, and 6D. Those parameters are<br>
within the following ranges<br>
method substantially as described in Charles M. Hansen, Hansen Solubility<br>
Parameters; A Users Handbook, 43-53 CRC Press 2000. and CMH"s<br>
SPHERE computer program for the calculations.<br>
The preferred extraction solvents include but are not limited to solver<br>
of Formula I<br>
wherein<br>
R1 is hydrogen, C1-6alkyl, C1-6alkylcarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, -SO3H,<br>
phenyl, or substituted phenyi where the phenyl substituents are C1-6alkyl,<br>
C1-6alkoxy, amino, nitro, or halogen;<br>
R2 is hydrogen, C1-6alkyl, C1-6alkylcarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, -SO3H<br>
phenyl, or substituted phenyl where the phenyl substituents are C1-6alkyl,<br>
C1-6alkoxy, amino, nitro, or halogen;<br>
R3 is hydrogen, C1-6alkyl phenyl, C1-6alkylcarbonyl, aminocarbonyl,<br>
-SO3H, phenyl, or substituted phenyl where the phenyl substituents are<br>
C1-6alkyl. C1-6alkoxy, amino, nitro, or halogen; and<br>
nis 1-10.<br>
The preferred R1 is selected from the group consisting of C1-6lkyl and<br>
C1-6alkylcarbonyl, where the more preferred R1 is selected from the group<br>
consisting of C1-6alkyl, and the particularly preferred R1 is methyl. The<br>
preferred R2 is selected from the group consisting of C1-6alkyl and<br>
C1-6alkylcarbonyl, where the more preferred R2 is selected from the group<br>
consisting of C1-6alkylcarbonyl, and the particularly preferred R2is acetyl or<br>
hydrogen. The preferred Rs is selected from the group consisting of C1-6alkyl<br>
and C1-6alkylcarbonyl where the more preferred R3 is C1-6alkyl, and the<br>
particularly preferred R3 is hydrogen. The preferred n is 1-5.<br>
Examples of extracting solvents include but are not limited to ethylene<br>
glycol-n-butyl ether, diethylene glycol-n-butyl ether, diethylene glycol methyl<br>
ether, ethylene glycol phenyl ether, propylene glycol methyl ether, dipropylene<br>
glycol methyl ether, tripropylene glycol methyl ether, propylene glycol methyl<br>
ether acetate, dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate, propylene<br>
glycol-n-propyl ether, dipropylene glycol-n-propyl ether, tripropylene<br>
glycd-n-butyi ether, propyiene glycol-n-butyl ether, dipropylene glycol-n-butyl<br>
ether, tripropylene glycol-n-butyl ether, tripropylene glycol-n-propyl ether,<br>
propiyene glycol phenyl ether, dipropylene glycol dimethyl ether, propyl<br>
acetate, and methyl isobutyl ketone. The particularly preferred extracting<br>
solvents are butyl acetate, dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate (DPMA).<br>
diproplyeneglycol methyl ether (DPM), dipropyleneglycol dimethyl ether (DMM),<br>
tripropylene glycol methyl ether (TPM), and mixtures thereof. In addition the<br>
particularly preferred solvents mixtures of DPMA, DMM, DPM, or TPM with<br>
water or propylene glycol. The most preferred solvent for a cured polymer<br>
16.5 MPa1/2 is dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate.<br>
As stated above, the choice of extracting solvent is driven by the<br>
physical properties of the cured polymer. More than one component can used<br>
in the extracting solvent, where, depending upon the physical properties of the<br>
cured polymer, it Is preferable that the extracting solvent contain two or more<br>
components. For example if the cured polymer is a silicone hydrogel where<br>
the majority of its surface is hydrophobic, it would be preferred to use a<br>
combination of a hydrophobic solvent having relatively low hydrogen bonding<br>
affinity with a hydrophilic solvent having tow molecular weight and high<br>
hydrogen bonding affinity. The majority of said extracting solvent contains the<br>
hydrophobic solvent where the percentage of hydrophobic solvent is about 20<br>
to about 98 % (percent by weight), more preferably about 70 to about 98 %,<br>
most preferably about 80 to about 90%. The molecular weight of the<br>
hydrophilic solvent of this extracting solvent is about 15 to about 200 Daltons,<br>
more preferably about 15 to about 100 Daltons. Examples of such solvents<br>
include 90:10 (parts by weight), DPMA:DI, 90:10 DMM:DI, 90:10<br>
DPMArpropylene glycol, 90:10 DMM.propylene glycol. In these examples<br>
DPMA and DMM are the hydrophobic solvents having low hydrogen bonding<br>
affinity, while propylene glycol and Dl are the hydrophilic solvents having high<br>
hydrogen bonding affinity and low molecular weights.<br>
If the cured polymer is a silicone hydrogel where its hydrophobic surface<br>
is coated with a hydrophilic polymer such as polyacrylic acid or poly HEMA, it<br>
would be preferred to use solvent mixtures that contain hydrophobic solvents<br>
that have moderately high hydrogen bonding affinity and hydrophilic solvents<br>
having low molecular weight and relatively high hydrogen bonding affinity. The<br>
majority of said extracting solvent contains the hydrophobic solvent where the<br>
percentage of hydrophobic solvent is about 20 to about 98 % (percent by<br>
weight), more preferably about 70 to about 98 %. most preferably about 80 to<br>
about 90%70 to about 98 % (percent by weight), more preferably about 80 to<br>
about 90%. The molecular weight of the hydrophilic solvent of this extracting<br>
solvent is about 15 to about 200 Dattons, more preferably about 15 to about<br>
100 Daltons. Examples of such solvents include 90:10, TPM:DI, 90:10<br>
DPM:DI, 90:10 TPM:propylene glycol, 90:10 DPMrpropylene glycol. In these<br>
examples TPM and DPM are hydrophobic solvents and propylene glycol and<br>
DI are the low molecular weight solvents having relatively high hydrogen<br>
bonding affinity.<br>
Although the choice of extracting solvent is critical to this invention, the<br>
method may be improved by adjusting certain physical parameters. For<br>
example, a greater percentage of unreacted hydrophobic monomers can be<br>
removed by raising the temperature of the solvent, agitating said solvent,<br>
increasing the time of the extraction procedure and any combination thereof.<br>
Further the invention includes a method of releasing and extracting<br>
cured polymers comprising hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers, where the<br>
method comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of the steps of treating<br>
the cured polymer with an extracting solvent, wherein said extracting solvent<br>
when measured at 25 °C<br>
(a) swells the cured polymer to at least 15%, and<br>
(b) has Hansen Solubility Parameters within the ranges of<br>
The terms hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomer and extracting solvent have<br>
their aforementioned definitions and preferred ranges. The preferred polymers<br>
are contact lenses and intraocular tenses.<br>
Still further the invention includes a polymer that is made by a method of<br>
extracting cured polymers comprising hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers,<br>
where the method comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of the steps of<br>
treating the cured polymer with an extracting solvent, wherein said extracting<br>
solvent when measured at 25 ºC<br>
(a) swells the cured polymer from about 0% to about 50%, and<br>
(b) has Hansen Solubility Parameters within the ranges of<br>
In order to illustrate the invention the following examples are included.<br>
These examples do not limit the invention. They are meant only to suggest a<br>

as other specialties may find other methods of practicing the invention.<br>
However, those methods are deemed to be within the scope of this invention.<br>

DPMA = dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate<br>

Example 1<br>
Evaluation of DPMa and I PA as Extracting Solvents<br>
The ability of DPMA to serve as an effective extracting solvent was<br>
evaluated by examining levels of unreacted hydrophobic monomers from cured<br>
lenses. A residual level is defined as the amount of monomer(s) that remain<br>
unreacted or unpolymerized after a iens is adequately cured.<br>
The monomer mixture that comprises acquafilcon A was loaded to 7 frames<br>
(56 lenses) and cured for 8 minutes to 60 minutes, at 55-70ºC, using dimethyt-<br>
3-octanol as a diluent and visible fight (visible light wavelength: 380-460 nm<br>
with a peak maximum at 425 nm, dose: approx. 2,5 J/cm2). The resulting<br>
lenses were de-molded (lenses on front curve), and removed from the frames<br>
using tweezers.<br>
Five lenses were accurately weighed into five individual glass<br>
scintillation vials and 5 mL of DPMA (DOWANOL®) was pipetted into each vial.<br>
Vials 1 though 5 were sonicated for 1 hr at 25, 35, 50, 60, and 70 °C,<br>
respectively Concurrent experiments were set up using iPA as the extracting<br>
solvent. The resulting extracts were analyzed for macromer and mPDMS and<br>
the levels (weight percent) obtained are tabulated in Tables 1 and 2. The<br>
samples were analyzed for these monomers because they are the most<br>
hydrophobic components in the final polymer. These figures show that DPMA<br>
extracts these hydrophobic monomers at a level which is comparable to IPA<br>
over a range of temperatures, where the levels are most comparable at 60°C<br>
and 70ºC.<br>
Example 2<br>
Temperature Effect on Leachable Levels of Hydrophobic Monomers from<br>
Cured Polymers with DPMA<br>
This experiment determines the level of leachable hydrophobic<br>
monomers which can be obtained from cured polymers that were extracted<br>
with DPMA. A leachable level is defined as the amount of a monomer (or<br>
monomers) obtained after a polymer has been cured, extracted and hydrated<br>
and then, subsequently extracted with another solvent. Typically the<br>
subsequent extraction solvent is iPA. The monomer mixture that comprises<br>
acquafilcon A was loaded to frames and cured for 8 minutes to 60 minutes, at<br>
55-70°C, using dimethyl-3-octanol, as a diluent and visible light (visible light<br>
(wavelength: 380-460 nm with a peak maximum at 425 nm, dose: approx. 2.5<br>
J/cm2). The resulting lenses, 3 frames (24 lenses) were de-molded (lenses on<br>
front curve), strapped to cyclic olefin copolymer (TOPAS®) leaching/hydration<br>
vehicles and placed in a jacketed 1 L beaker, controlled by a circulating water<br>
heater/cooler. The extracting solvent. DPMA (850 mL) was added (-35<br>
mL/lens) and agitated by a magnetic stlrrer for 90 min at 25 °C. At the end of<br>
the extraction, the vehicles (with frames and lenses) were placed in de-ionized<br>
water at 15°C, controlled by a circulating water heater/cooler. The water was<br>
agitated by circulation at high speed using an immersion water circulator. After<br>
1 hr, 10 lenses were withdrawn, blotted dry and accurately weighed into a<br>
scintillation vial. Five mL of iPA was added to the vial and the vial was<br>
sonicated for 1 hr. Samples were prepared in duplicate and analyzed for<br>
teachable mPDMS 1000 and macromer. Concurrent experiments were run<br>
using DPMA as the extracting solvent at temperature of 35, 50. 60, and 70 °C,<br>
respectively. The results of these experiments are tabulated in Table 3. The<br>
result show that at all temperatures, the leachable level for rnPDMS is less<br>
than 175 ppm (mg/Kg on a lens wL basis). Typically levels of 600-1000 ppm<br>
are obtained when iPA is used as the initial extracting solvent. The leve! of<br>
leachable macromer decreases with increasing extraction temperature and<br>
leachable levels at 60°C and 70°C are comparable with levels observed for IPA<br>
(600-1000 ppm). This finding demonstrates that there is a significant<br>
advantage in using DPMA as an extraction solvent rather than IPA. In a<br>
production environment, due to IPA"s low flash point (12 °C) and high vapor<br>
pressure (45.8 mmHg @ 25 6C). However, due to DPMA"s high flash point<br>
(187 °C) and low vapor pressure (0.08 mmHg @ 20 °C) this solvent may be<br>
used at elevated temperatures without the accompanying safety hazards.<br>
Example 3<br>
Analysis of Leachable Levels of Hvdrophobic Monomers from Cured Polymers<br>
With DMM<br>
This experiment determines the level of leachable hydrophobic<br>
monomers which can be obtained from cured polymers, initially processed or<br>
extracted with DMM. In example 2, extraction was accomplished in a cyclic<br>
olefin copolymer (TOPAS®) leaching/hydration vehicles, whereas in this<br>
example extraction was done in scintillation vials. The monomer mixture that<br>
comprises acquafitcon A was loaded to the frames and cured for 8 minutes to<br>
60 minutes, at 55-70ºC, using dimethyl-3-octanol, as a diluent and visible light<br>
(visible light (wavelength: 380-460 nm with a peak maximum at 425 nm, dose;<br>
approx. 2.5 J/cm2).<br>
Ten lenses were removed from frames and placed into each of 6<br>
scintillation vials. 10 ml DMM (1 mL per lens, PROGLYDE®) was added to<br>
each vial and shaken for 30 minutes at 175 rpm on a Thermolyne Type 50000<br>
Maxi-mix 111. At the end of this period, lenses from vial 1 were equilibrated in<br>
250 mL Dl water, by shaking for 1 hr at 175 rpm. After equilibration, the 10<br>
lenses were harvested, blotted dry and accurately weighed into a scintillation<br>
vial. Five mL of isopropanol was added to the vial and the vial was sonicated<br>
for 1 hr. The iPA extract was analyzed for leachable mPDMS and macromer.<br>
The DMM from the remaining vials were decanted, and 10 mL aliquot of fresh<br>
DMM was added to each vial. The vials were shaken for 10 minutes, which<br>
constituted "1 cycle". The procedure was repeated to generate samples after 5<br>
cycles, with fresh DMM replacing the extract at the start of each cycle.<br>
Following each cycle, lenses were equilibrated in Dl water and subsequently<br>
extracted with iPA as described above. The iPA extracts were analyzed for<br>
teachable mPDMS and macromer. The data is tabulated in Table 4.<br>
Example 4<br>
Comparison of % Swell of Cured Polymer in a Variety of Solvents<br>
The procedure for testing the swell of a polymer in a number of testing<br>
solvents is described in this example. The monomer mixture of acquafilcon A<br>
was dosed into molds and cured for 8 minutes to 60 minutes, at 55-70°C. using<br>
dimethyl-3-octanol, as a diluent and visible fight (visible light (wavelength: 380-<br>
460 nm with a peak maximum at 425 nm, dose: approx. 2.5 J/cm2). The<br>
resulting discs, (thickness range of 70-110 µm) were fully hydrated by releasing<br>
from the molds in 60:40 isopropanol (IPA) / deionized (Dl) water, extracting<br>
additional residual monomers using five aliquots of 100% IPA over a period of<br>
ten hours (two hours / aliquot) and then equilibrated in deionized water. These<br>
lenses were then equilibrated in the various testing solvents as well as<br>
physiological saline. Measurements of lens" diameters were made and a<br>
comparison of % swell made. The % swell was calculated using the following<br>
equation:<br>
%swell = 100 x [(lens diameter in extracting solvent - lens<br>
diameter in physiological saline) / lens diameter in<br>
physiological saline]<br>
The data for % swell at 25°C is tabulated in Table 5. In addition, since the<br>
volatility and flammability for DPMA is relatively low, this particular solvent<br>
could be utilized at higher processing temperatures. The matrix swell of the<br>
polymer in DPMA, over the temperature range investigated (25-70°C), was<br>
determined and found to be linear.<br>
Example 5<br>
Comparison of % Swell of Coated Cured Polymer in a Variety of Solvents<br>
Contact lenses coated with poly HEMA were prepared as described in<br>
Example 14 of U.S. Pat. App. No. 09/921,192. Using the method of Example<br>
4, the lenses were released and equilibrated in three different solvent mixtures.<br>
For this example only, the swell was calculated using the following formula,<br>
where the diameter of the lens mold is the diameter of the mold that forms the<br>
cured article<br>
%swellterms mold method = 100 x [(lens diameter in extracting solvent - diameter<br>
lens mold) / diameter lens mold]<br>
Calculating the swell by this method results in a percentage swellions mold method<br>
that is from about 1 to about 5%, preferably about 1 to about 2% greater than<br>
calculating the percent swell using the diameter of the polymer in an aqueous<br>
solution. 100% DPM, 100% TPM, 90:10 DPM:DI, 90:10 TPM:DI, and 90:10<br>
IPA:DI were tested at 60 ºC and the percentage swellslens mold method was 49.3%,<br>
46.5%," 26.5%, 17.3%. and 51% respectively. A summary of the data collected<br>
for the percentage of swell in different solvent systems is presented in Tables<br>
6, 7, and 8 below. This data shows that aqueous mixtures cf TPM and DPM<br>
are the preferred solvents for extracting a poly HEM A coated lens.<br>
Example 6<br>
Hydration of Lenses<br>
This procedure demonstrates that lenses extracted using a solvent with<br>
limited solubility in aqueous solutions, such as DPMA may be equilibrated<br>
directly to aqueous solution without inducing internal stresses. Use of IPA as<br>
an extraction solvent yielded lenses with a large variation in final lens" diameter<br>
uniformity even with a step-down gradient. A longer, slower step-down<br>
gradient from 1PA to aqueous solution was examined and the lenses found to<br>
have a tighter statistical distribution for lens" diameter. Lenses extracted in<br>
DPMA and equilibrated directly to aqueous solution also demonstrated a tighter<br>
distribution, removing the necessity of the additional processing step.<br>
The monomer mixture of acquafilcon A was dosed into molds and cured<br>
for 8 minutes to 60 minutes, at 55-70°C, using dimethyI-3-octanoI, as a diluent<br>
and visible light (visible light (wavelength: 380-460 nm with a peak maximum at<br>
425 nm, dose: approx. 2.5 J/cm2):<br>
• 60:40, IPA/DI water release from molds, extraction in 100% IPA and a step-<br>
down gradient to aqueous solution equilibration in increments of 30. 60,<br>
100%.<br>
• 60:40, IPA/Dl vypter release from molds, extraction in 100% IPA and a step-<br>
down gradient to aqueous solution equilibration in increments of 10, 20, 30,<br>
40, 50, 75,100%.<br>
• 100% DPMA release and extraction and direct aqueous equilibration.<br>
Measurement of lens" diameters on 10 lenses were made in both x and y<br>
direction (to pick up any lenses that might be out-of-round) for each condition.<br>
The diameter data is presented in Table 9.<br>
Example 7<br>
Release of Lenses Using a Variety of Extraction Solvents<br>
The monomer mixture of acquafilcon A was dosed into moids and cured<br>
for 8 minutes to 60 minutes, at 55-70°C, using dimethyl-3-octanol, as a diluent<br>
and visible light (visible light wavelength: 380-460 nm with a peak maximum at<br>
425 nm, dose: approx. 2.6 J/cm2). Subsequently, the lenses were subjected to<br>
a variety of solvents to release the lenses from the molds. The four groups of<br>
solvents utilized were IPA, 60:40 IPA/DI, DMM and DPMA and the release was<br>
conducted at ambient temperature. The time necessary for the lenses to<br>
release from the molds and the physical characteristics during release were<br>
observed and recorded. The data presented in Table 10, shows that both<br>
DMM and DPMA have distinct advantages over iPA or IPA in combination with<br>
Dl (which has an equivalent % swell to DPMA) due to the time of release<br>
and/or the physical manner of release of the lenses.<br>
Example 8<br>
Release_of Coated Lenses Using a Variety of Extraction Solvents<br>
Contact lenses coated with poly HEMA were prepared as described in<br>
Example 14 of U.S. Pat. App. No. 09/921,192. Using the method of Example<br>
7 the lenses were released from the molds and equilibrated in the solution for<br>
about 2 hours. The temperature, release time swell and amount of extracted<br>
residuals were recorded in Table 11. Immediately after release from the mold<br>
materials the lenses exhibited some physical distortion (wrinkled edges).<br>
However lenses in all tested solutions equilibrated within 15-20 minutes after<br>
release to give smooth rounded lenses. This example proves that lenses<br>
released and extracted with the tested solvents swell far less than lenses<br>
released and extracted with IPA. In addition, this demonstrates that lenses<br>
extracted with these extracting solvents may be equilibrated directly into water<br>
without using a step down procedure.<br>
