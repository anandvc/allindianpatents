				<td>ANTIFUNGAL AGENTS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to tetrahydroindolizine compounds and their therapeutic use in prevention or treatment of fungal diseases. It also relates to the use of the compounds as agricultural fungicides.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Invasive fungal infections are well recognised as diseases of the immunocompromised host Over the last twenty years there have been significant rises in the number of recorded instances of fungal infection (Groll et al., 1996. J Infect 33, 23-32). In part this is due to increased awareness and improved diagnosis of fungal infection. However, the primary cause of this increased incidence is the vast rise in the number of susceptible individuals. This is due to a number of factors including new and aggressive immunosuppressive therapies, increased survival in intensive care, increased numbers of transplant procedures and the greater use of antibiotics worldwide.<br>
hi certain patient groups, fungal infection occurs at high frequency; lung transplant recipients have a frequency of up to 20% colonisation and infection with a fungal organism and fungal infection in allogenic haemopoetic stem cell transplant recipients is as high as 15% (Ribaud et al., 1999, Clin Infect Dis. 28:322-30).<br>
Currently only four classes of antifungal drug are available to treat systemic fungal infections. These are the polyenes (e.g., amphotericin B), the azoles (e.g., ketoconazole or itraconazole), the echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin) and flucytosine.<br>
The polyenes are the oldest class of antifungal agent being first introduced in the 1950's. The exact mode of action remains unclear but polyenes are only effective against organisms that contain sterols in their outer membranes. It has been proposed that amphotericin B interacts with membrane sterols to produce pores allowing leakage of cytoplasmic components and subsequent cell death.<br>
Azoles work by inhibition of the 14Î±-demethylase via a cytochrome P450-dependent mechanism. This leads to a depletion of the membrane sterol ergosterol and the accumulation of sterol precursors resulting in a plasma membrane with altered fluidity and structure.<br>
Echinocandins work by the inhibition of the cell wall synthetic enzyme p-glucan synthase. This leads to abnormal cell wall formation, osmotic sensitivity and cell lysis.<br>
Flucytosine is a pyrirnidine analogue interfering with cellular pyrimidine metabolism as well DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. However widespread resistance to flucyotosine limits its therapeutic use.<br>
It can be seen that to date the currently available antifungal agents act primarily against only two cellular targets; membrane sterols (polyenes and azoles) and p-glucan synthase (echinocandins).<br>
Resistance to both azoles and polyenes has been widely reported leaving only the recently introduced echinocandins to combat invasive fungal infections. As the use of echinocandins increases, resistance by fungi will inevitably occur.<br>
The identification of new classes of antifungal agent is required to give the promise of positive therapeutic outcomes to patients.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>

The present invention includes a composition comprising a compound of the invention, or an agriculturally acceptable salt thereof, and an agriculturally acceptable carrier or diluent. Said agricultural composition typically contains up to 85 wt% of a compound of the invention. More typically, it contains up to 50 wt% of a compound of the invention.<br>
Suitable agriculturally acceptable salts include salts with agriculturally acceptable acids, both inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, sulphuric, phosphoric, diphosphoric, hydrobromic or nitric acid and organic acids such as citric, fumaric, maleic, malic, ascorbic, succinic, tartaric, benzoic, acetic, methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, benzenesulphonic or p-toluenesulphonic acid. Salts may also be formed with agriculturally acceptable bases such as alkali metal (e.g. sodium or potassium) and alkaline earth metal (e.g. calcium or magnesium) hydroxides and organic bases such as alkyl amines, aralkyl amines or heterocyclic amines. A preferred agriculturally acceptable salt is the hydrochloride salt.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be applied in combination with inert carriers or diluents, as in aqueous sprays, granules and dust formulations in accordance with established practice in the art An aqueous spray is usually prepared by mixing a wettable powder or emulsifiable concentrate formulation of a compound of the invention with a relatively large amount of water to form a dispersion.<br>
Wettable powders may comprise an intimate, finely divided mixture of a compound of the invention, an inert solid carrier and a surface-active agent. The inert<br>
solid carrier is usually chosen from among the attapulgite clays, the kaolin clays, the montmorillonite clays, the diatomaceous earths, finely divided silica and purified silicates. Effective surfactants, which have wetting, penetrating and dispersing ability are usually present in a wettable powder formulation in proportions of from 0.5 to 10 percent by weight. Among the surface active agents commonly used for this purpose are the sulfonated lignins, naphthalenesulfonates and condensed naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkyl sulfates and non-ionic surfactants such as products of condensation of ethylene oxide with alkylphenols.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates may comprise a solution of a compound of the invention in a liquid carrier which is a mixture of a water-immiscible solvent and a surfactant, including an emulsifier. Useful solvents include aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as the xylenes, alkylnaphthalenes, petroleum distillates, terpene solvents, ether-alcohols and organic ester solvents. Suitable emulsifiers, dispersing and wetting agents may be selected from the same classes of products which are employed in formulating wettable powders.<br>
The fungicide formulations desirably contain from 0.1 percent to 95 percent by weight of the compound of the invention and from 0.1 to 75 percent of an inert carrier or surfactant The direct application to plant seeds prior to planting may be accomplished in some instances by mixing either a powdered solid compound of the invention or a dust formulation with seed to obtain a substantially uniform coating which is very thin and represents only one or two percent by weight or less, based on the weight of the seed. In some instances, however, a non-phytotoxic solvent such as methanol is conveniently employed as a carrier to facilitate the uniform distribution of the compound of the invention on the surface of the seed.<br>
When a compound of the invention is to be applied to the soil, as for pre-emergence protection, granular formulations or dusts are sometimes more convenient than sprays. A typical granular formulation comprises a compound of the invention dispersed on an inert carrier such as coarsely ground clay, or clay which has been converted to granules by treatment of a rolling bed of the powdered material with a small amount of liquid in a granulating drum. In the usual process for preparing granular formulations, a solution of the active compound is sprayed on the granules while they are being agitated in a suitable mixing apparatus, after which the granules are<br>
dried with a current of air during continued agitation. Dust formulations customarily employ essentially the same inert diluents as wettable powders and granules, but are well-mixed in powder form and do not usually contain emulsifiers. Dusts may contain some surface active agents to facilitate uniform distribution of the active ingredient in the formulation and to improve the uniformity and adhesion of the dust coating on seeds and plants. The colloidal dispersion of dust formulations in the air is usually prevented by incorporation of a minor amount of an oily or waxy material in the formulation to cause agglomeration of colloidal size particles. In this way the dust may be applied to seeds or plants without generation of an air-polluting aerosol.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention but are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. In this regard, it is important to understand that the particular assays used in the Examples section are designed only to provide an indication of antifungal activity. There are many assays available to determine such activity, and a negative result in any one particular assay is therefore not determinative.<br>

This produced MIC plates with a drug range 50-O.05 mg/L and organism inocula of l-2xl04 cfu/mL for Aspergillus spp.. All plates were incubated for 24 hrs at 35 Â°C. Growth was assessed by monitoring the optical density at 485 nm for each well. The MIC of a compound is the lowest drug concentration that inhibits growth of an organism by &gt;70% compared with a drug free control. MICs are recorded as mg/L. In cases where the MIC of an organism is &gt;=O.05 mg/L the MIC is repeated using a concentration range of 0.5 - 0.0005 mg/L. Other growth media can be used for susceptibility testing, and the activity of the described compounds was also assessed in RPMI medium containing 2% glucose, and 0.135M MOPS buffer.
