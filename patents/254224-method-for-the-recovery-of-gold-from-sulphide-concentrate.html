				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for recovering gold hydrometallurgically<br>
from a sulphidic concentrate, particularly one containing arsenopyrite and/or<br>
pyrite. The concentrate is first subjected to leaching with a concentrated<br>
solution of alkali chloride and copper (II) chloride, by means of which the<br>
copper minerals and some of the gold in the concentrate are made to<br>
dissolve. Elemental sulphur and precipitated iron and arsenic compounds are<br>
separated from the leaching residue using physical separation methods,<br>
whereby the first intermediate is obtained, which contains gold-bearing<br>
sulphide minerals and gangue minerals as well as the gold that remains<br>
undissolved. The free gold that remains undissolved is separated by means<br>
of gravity separation methods. After gravity separation, additional<br>
comminution is carried out, after which the sulphide minerals are broken<br>
down and the gold-containing solution or residue is routed to the concentrate<br>
leaching circuit.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Copper concentrates contain variable amounts of gold. In smelting plant<br>
processes gold is generally recovered with a high yield via anodic sludge<br>
treatment processes. In hydrometallurgical copper processes the recovery of<br>
gold from concentrates causes a specific problem. Gold recovery in process<br>
alternatives using sulphate-based leaching is usually based on cyanide<br>
leaching of leach residue, whereby however the elemental sulphur formed in<br>
copper leaching disrupts the cyanide leaching of gold. In chloride-based<br>
copper processes, both the gold bound to copper minerals and the free gold<br>
dissolve to a large extent, but the gold bound to pyrites and silicates as fine<br>
inclusions or to sulphide minerals as what is termed invisible gold, remains<br>
mainly undissolved. Invisible (submicroscopic) gold is inside the mineral<br>
particles as very fine inclusions or in the mineral lattice. Some of the coarse<br><br>
free gold contained in the concentrate also remains undissolved due to too<br>
short a retention time.<br>
In refractory gold concentrates, the proportion of copper and other base<br>
metals is usually small. The recovery of gold by cyanide leaching alone does<br>
not succeed with concentrates in which the gold is refractory or<br>
submicroscopic. One example of this kind of concentrate is a concentrate<br>
containing arsenopyrite and/or pyrite. Gold recovery from such concentrates<br>
requires the almost total decomposition of the minerals containing the gold.<br>
If cyanide leaching is used, the concentrate requires pretreatment, such as<br>
roasting, bioleaching or oxidising pressure leaching.<br>
Outokumpu Oyj has developed a hydrometallurgical copper recovery<br>
process, the HydroCopper™ process, which is described for example in US<br>
patent 6,007,600. According to this, the copper concentrate is leached in<br>
atmospheric conditions into a concentrated alkali chloride solution using<br>
divalent copper as oxidant. The leaching of gold in connection with the<br>
HydroCopper process is described in for example WO patent application<br>
03/091463. According to this, gold dissolves during copper concentrate<br>
leaching as a chloride complex and is recovered from the solution using<br>
activated carbon. However, if gold appears in a difficult form e.g. in pyrite<br>
and/or in silicate minerals, it cannot be leached with the method described in<br>
the above-mentioned WO application.<br>
Patent application WO 2004/059018 describes a gold recovery process, in<br>
which refractory gold-containing concentrate such as arsenopyrite or pyrite is<br>
treated in a halide environment in atmospheric conditions. The arsenopyrite<br>
and pyrite lattice is broken down using chemical oxidation. Oxygen is used to<br>
form a soluble oxidant in the form of divalent copper or trivalent iron. With<br>
divalent copper, arsenopyrite decomposes and forms arsenic acid, divalent<br>
iron, sulphur and monovalent copper. Iron and copper are oxidised with<br>
oxygen to a higher valence. The trivalent iron thus formed reacts further with<br><br>
the arsenic acid forming ferric arsenate (FeAsO4). The decomposition of<br>
pyrite occurs in the same way by means of divalent copper, so that sulphuric<br>
acid and divalent iron (Fe2+) are formed. Divalent iron is oxidised to trivalent<br>
and monovalent copper to divalent by means of oxygen. Iron is precipitated<br>
as hematite and the solution is neutralised by feeding limestone into it, so<br>
that gypsum (CaSO4) is precipitated out. If carbon is included, the<br>
concentrate is roasted after the leaching stages. Gold dissolves from the<br>
pyrite as a chloride complex and is recovered using activated carbon.<br>
Refractory gold ores can be treated with the method according to WO patent<br>
application 2004/059018, but the disadvantage is that all the sulphur<br>
generated from both arsenopyrite leaching and copper minerals leaching has<br>
to be oxidised to sulphate. Arsenic first enters the solution from which it is<br>
precipitated as ferric arsenate, but the sulphur generated in arsenopyrite<br>
leaching proceeds with the solids to the subsequent leaching stage, where it<br>
is oxidised to sulphate. In this case there is a great need for oxidation and<br>
likewise the need for neutralisation increases considerably, which weakens<br>
the economy of the process significantly. The entire amount of concentrate in<br>
the process is ground very fine, up to 80% smaller than 6-10 µrn, so that the<br>
demand for grinding capacity is large, and the grinding energy consumption<br>
is high while at the same time sludging problems increase and both solids<br>
and liquid separation stages become more complicated.<br>
US patent 6,315,812 describes the Platsol™ process, in which sulphide<br>
minerals or smelting matte are treated with oxidising pressure leaching in a<br>
solution containing chloride and sulphate.<br>
In the Platsol process all the sulphur in the sulphide phase is oxidised to<br>
sulphate, whereupon the need for neutralisation increases greatly, reducing<br>
the process economy. The use of chloride in autoclave conditions leads to<br>
expensive investments due to the corrosion question etc.<br><br>
US patent 6,461,577 describes a two-stage bioleaching method for leaching<br>
sulphides that contain arsenic. Gold is recovered from the resulting solution<br>
by cyanide leaching.<br>
Bioleaching as the only leaching method for the total amount of concentrate<br>
is fairly slow. The disadvantages of the bioleaching method are the difficult<br>
solubility of chalcopyrite and the oxidation of the entire amount of<br>
concentrate to sulphate, where the need for neutralisation is large. In<br>
addition, cyanide is used to leach gold, which poses a risk for the<br>
environment.<br>
PURPOSE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Using the method of the invention, gold can be recovered in connection with<br>
a chloride leaching process from refractory concentrates, particularly from<br>
those containing arsenopyrite and/or pyrite such as copper concentrates,<br>
where the gold is bound to iron pyrite and silicate minerals, or preferably<br>
from a mixture of different copper concentrates and refractory concentrates.<br>
In addition, the gold yield from coarse gold and gold bound to silicate<br>
minerals can be improved immensely. The oxidation of sulphur to sulphate is<br>
minimised, so that the amount of sulphuric acid to be neutralised is<br>
significantly lower.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The essential features of the method according to the invention will be made<br>
apparent in the claims.<br>
The invention relates to a method for the recovery of gold from sulphidic<br>
concentrates, which are copper concentrates, refractory, particularly those<br>
containing arsenopyrite and/or pyrite and mixtures of the above. The<br>
leaching of the copper sulphide minerals and partially gold from the<br>
concentrate takes place in a concentrated aqueous solution of alkali chloride<br>
and copper (II) chloride in atmospheric conditions. Some of the gold<br><br>
dissolves and is recovered from the solution by known methods such as<br>
activated carbon or ion-exchange resins. The majority of elemental sulphur<br>
and iron oxides (also including precipitated arsenic compounds) are<br>
separated from the leaching residue using physical or equivalent separation<br>
methods, so that what remains is mainly a gold-containing product containing<br>
pyrites and gangue minerals. The gangue minerals are mostly silicates.<br>
Coarse, undissolved gold is separated from this first intermediate product by<br>
means of gravity separation. Then the intermediate is ground to a sufficient<br>
fineness and leaching of the second intermediate thus formed and the pyrite<br>
and remaining arsenopyrite in it is performed by known methods. Known<br>
leaching techniques that are applicable to the method include especially<br>
sulphate-based pressure leaching and atmospheric and bacteria-assisted<br>
sulphate leaching as well as atmospheric chloride leaching. The gold-<br>
containing stream that exits leaching, which depending on the leaching<br>
method chosen is a solution or precipitate, is returned to the concentrate<br>
chloride leaching circuit.<br>
Sulphidic copper concentrates such as chalcopyrite may contain gold, which<br>
is difficult to leach in chloride-based leaching. Gold may bind itself in this<br>
case to insoluble sulphide minerals such as pyrite. In addition gold is often<br>
bound to the gangue minerals of the concentrate such as silicates. If the gold<br>
is coarse, some of the gold typically remains undissolved due to too short a<br>
retention time. In most sulphidic concentrates that are difficult to process<br>
(known as refractory concentrates) pyrite and arsenopyrite are the major<br>
gold bearers.<br>
A certain copper level is maintained in the chloride-based concentrate<br>
leaching stage solution, which is preferably around 20-60 g/l. If there is no<br>
copper in the concentrate, it is brought to the process. Some of the copper<br>
may be obtained from the process circuit as precipitate, which comes from<br>
later stages of the process. The copper is oxidised in the solution to divalent<br>
(Cu2+) using an oxidising gas. Oxygen-containing gases and chlorine are<br><br>
used as the oxidising gas. The quantity of alkali chloride in the solution is<br>
200-330 g/l. The leaching stage always includes several reactors, which are<br>
equipped with a mixer. Leaching occurs in atmospheric conditions, at a<br>
temperature of 80°C - the boiling point of the solution. The oxidation-<br>
reduction potential of the solution should be high enough, at least at the end<br>
of the leaching, i.e. a minimum of 600 mV vs. Ag/AgCI electrode, so that the<br>
copper pyrite and at least part of the arsenopyrite decompose. The<br>
dissolving of gold requires a sufficiently high redox potential. Using an<br>
oxygen-containing gas and chlorine gas the redox potential of the solution<br>
can be raised to a value of 600-650 mV, whereupon gold dissolves<br>
effectively.<br><br>
As the above reactions show, copper (II) chloride dissolves the arsenopyrite,<br>
so that as a result of the reaction arsenic acid, iron (II) chloride, elemental<br>
sulphur, hydrochloric acid and copper (I) chloride are generated. If the<br>
potential is raised high enough, the elemental sulphur will react further to<br>
form sulphuric acid. The iron (II) chloride that is generated reacts with the<br><br>
copper (II) chloride to form iron (III) chloride, which further reacts with arsenic<br>
acid, so that poorly soluble ferric arsenate and hydrochloric acid are<br>
generated. Gold dissolves effectively at a leaching stage redox potential of<br>
600-650 mV vs. Ag/AgCI electrode, when chlorine gas is fed to the stage.<br>
Chlorine gas, like the oxygen fed into the solution, simultaneously oxidises<br>
the cuprous chloride generated in the reactions to cupric chloride, as shown<br>
in reactions (5) and (6). It is known that arsenopyrite also dissolves either<br>
partially or totally in these conditions. It is advantageous to keep the pH of<br>
the leaching stage at a value of 1-2.5, so that the copper is not precipitated,<br>
but the iron and sulphur are precipitated as secondary phases such as ferric<br>
hydroxide or ferric arsenate. When concentrate leaching is performed<br>
preferably according to the HydroCopper™ process described in the prior art,<br>
the process includes chlor-alkali electrolysis, in which the chlorine and at<br>
least part of the alkali to be used in neutralisation can be exploited in this<br>
leaching stage. If another chloride process is used for leaching, the chlorine<br>
and alkali are formed in some other equivalent electrolytic process stage or<br>
ready-made industrial chemicals are used.<br>
The leaching residue formed in concentrate leaching includes mainly iron<br>
oxides (Fe2O3) and hydroxides (FeOOH), sulphur and ferric arsenate. In<br>
addition, the leaching residue includes pyrite contained in the concentrate,<br>
some of the arsenopyrite and silicate minerals, which did not dissolve in the<br>
chloride leaching stage. The leaching residue also contains the gold bound<br>
to the sulphide minerals remaining undissolved as well as free coarse gold,<br>
which has not had time to dissolve completely in the concentrate leaching<br>
stage. Secondary phases, such as elemental sulphur, hematite and ferric<br>
arsenate appear in the leaching residue as extremely fine inclusions (
µm), whereas the pyrite, arsenopyrite and silicates clearly represent a<br>
coarser primary concentrate particle size range (20-150 µm). The leaching<br>
residue may also include fine silicates, which have accumulated in the<br>
chloride leaching from previous process stages.<br><br>
The leaching residue is taken to the separation stage, where elemental<br>
sulphur and other secondary substances such as hematite and ferric<br>
arsenate are separated using physical separation methods. Fine silicate is<br>
also removed with the secondary substances. In this way the first<br>
intermediate product formed in the separation stage is composed mainly of<br>
the coarser pyrite, coarse-grained silicates, the rest of the arsenopyrite and<br>
gold. Physical separation methods used can be cyclone separation,<br>
elutriation, retarded settling, thickening, vibration, spiral separation or<br>
another equivalent method in which separation principles related to density<br>
and/or particle size are applied. Sulphur and other substances can also be<br>
removed by means of flotation. Physicochemical methods can also be used,<br>
whereby sulphur can be dissolved with a suitable solvent or separated in<br>
molten form using heat.<br>
The free gold contained in the first intermediate product obtained from the<br>
separation stages of sulphur and fines is recovered with a method based on<br>
gravity difference i.e. difference in specific weight. In this way centrifugal<br>
separation (Knelson or Falcon separators), spiral separation, shaking,<br>
vibration or another corresponding method can be used, where the gold<br>
particles of higher density are separated from the other mineral substances.<br>
The gold content of the first intermediate is still low, because it is mixed with<br>
other substances (pyrite, silicates). The purpose of gravity separation is to<br>
make a product with a high gold content, so that it is possible to sell the<br>
product separately or return it to concentrate chloride leaching. If it is known<br>
in advance that the amount of metallic gold in the first intermediate is small,<br>
gravity separation can be omitted, so that the intermediate goes directly to<br>
the next stages and the gold is recovered later.<br>
The remainder of the first intermediate, remaining from the free gold<br>
separation stage, is routed to a comminution stage, where it is ground<br>
sufficiently fine that the leaching rate of the hitherto undissolved sulphide<br>
minerals is raised significantly. The required particle size is d80 5-45 µm,<br><br>
preferably d80 5-15 µm. d80 means that 80% of the product is below the<br>
particle size mentioned. At the same time, the gold that is present as<br>
inclusions inside the gangue minerals with the concentrate is released. It is<br>
to be noted that this comminution is carried out on only a very small part of<br>
the total amount of concentrate, in order to avoid sludging problems affecting<br>
the entire process and to achieve substantial savings in grinding energy and<br>
comminution plant investments. The second intermediate thus generated is<br>
routed to leaching, by means of which the rest of the gold contained in the<br>
concentrate is obtained in such a form from which it can be recovered in the<br>
concentrate leaching circuit.<br>
When the treatment of the second intermediate is leaching, it is total<br>
leaching, i.e. the aim is to solubilise ail the sulphides. Treatment can also be<br>
roasting, in which pyrite is oxidised to iron oxide (hematite).<br>
One preferred method to perform leaching of the second intermediate<br>
product is pressure leaching. In this case it is preferable to operate with a<br>
sulphate base, to avoid the corrosion problems that may be caused in these<br>
conditions by chloride. In pressure leaching the second intermediate is put<br>
into an autoclave, where it is leached at a temperature between 160 -<br>
220°C. Oxygen-containing gas is also fed into the autoclave. The pyrite and<br>
rest of the arsenopyrite dissolve in pressure leaching, but the gold does not<br>
dissolve, it remains in the leaching residue. The leaching residue, which as<br>
well as gold contains hematite and fine gangue minerals, is routed to the<br>
concentrate leaching stage, where the gold dissolves at the end of leaching<br>
where high redox potential conditions prevail. The mass of the leaching<br>
residue is about 40% of the original feed. Gold is recovered from the solution<br>
by known methods, such as by means of activated carbon or ion-exchange<br>
resins. With respect to the hematite and fine silicates, from which gold has<br>
already been separated and leached, they are routed after chloride leaching<br>
to fines separation, where they are removed with sulphur and the rest of the<br>
precipitate.<br><br>
In pressure leaching pyrite breaks down according to the following formula:<br><br>
The solution is routed to neutralisation, where some advantageous<br>
neutralising agent such as limestone is used. The precipitate containing<br>
gypsum and iron oxides, iron hydroxides and ferric arsenate is removed from<br>
the circuit. The amount of gypsum-containing precipitate generated in<br>
neutralisation is about double that of the autoclave feed.<br>
Another way to leach the second intermediate is to use bacteria-assisted<br>
oxidation (bioleaching), preferably in a sulphate environment. The nutrients<br>
and air needed by the bacteria are fed to the leaching stage; leaching<br>
provides sufficient sulphates. In bioleaching the temperature range is 30-<br>
60°C. As a result of leaching, pyrite dissolves but gold remains in insoluble<br>
form in the leaching residue, from where gold is recovered by routing the<br>
leaching residue to the concentrate leaching stage. Gold dissolves in the<br>
conditions of high redox potential that prevail at the end of concentrate<br>
leaching and it is recovered by means of activated carbon or ion-exchange<br>
resins. The solution formed in leaching is routed to neutralisation, where<br>
some advantageous neutralising agent such as limestone is used. The<br>
gypsum and iron precipitate formed are removed from the circuit.<br>
The advantage of bioleaching is often the lower investment and operating<br>
costs than in the pressure leaching, and the fact that bioleaching is<br>
performed on only a small part of the concentrate fed into the process.<br>
The leaching residue from both pressure and bioleaching can also be treated<br>
if necessary in a separate chloride leaching circuit, so that the leaching<br>
residue is not mixed into the main stream.<br><br>
When leaching is carried out as chloride leaching, pyrite and the thus far<br>
undissolved arsenopyrite break down and the gold enters the solution as a<br>
chloro complex in the same stage. At the same time some of the gold bound<br>
to the gangue minerals dissolves. The copper-containing solution used in<br>
leaching is routed to the stage from some suitable stage of concentrate<br>
leaching, e.g. as atacamite or basic copper (II) chloride. An oxidising gas,<br>
which is an oxygen-containing gas and/or chlorine, is routed to leaching.<br>
When concentrate leaching is carried out according to the HydroCopper<br>
process described in the prior art, the process includes chlor-alkali<br>
electrolysis, where the chlorine formed can be exploited in this leaching<br>
stage. Either oxygen or oxygen-enriched air can be used as the oxygen-<br>
containing gas. The oxidation-reduction potential of the solution can be<br>
regulated by means of the oxidising gas to be at least 600 mV Ag/AgCI,<br>
preferably between 620 - 750 mV Ag/AgCI, so that the gold bound to pyrite<br>
also dissolves. The leaching kinetics of the fine pyrite in the leaching stage of<br>
the second intermediate are better than in the first leaching, which is due to<br>
the smaller particle size, the breaking down of the lattice and the reduction in<br>
passivation effects. Pyrite dissolves according to the following formula:<br><br>
The final result of leaching is that all the minerals of the second intermediate<br>
are leached except the fine gangue minerals. The solution is neutralised with<br>
some suitable neutralising agent like limestone. Neutralisation results in a<br>
leaching residue that contains gypsum, iron oxides, iron hydroxides and<br>
gangue minerals such as silicates, which are removed from the circuit. The<br>
gold-containing solution is routed to the gold recovery stage of concentrate<br>
leaching, where gold is recovered with e.g. activated carbon.<br>
The selection of method used for leaching the second intermediate depends<br>
on the metallurgical results obtained with each concentrate.<br><br><br>
LIST OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 presents a flow chart of one embodiment of the invention, where<br>
leaching is performed as sulphate based pressure leaching,<br>
the flow chart in Figure 2 is of another embodiment of the invention, where<br>
leaching is performed as pressure leaching, and<br>
Figure 3 presents a flow chart of yet another embodiment of the invention,<br>
where leaching is performed as chloride leaching.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The flow charts in Figures 1-3 are referred to in the description of the method<br>
according to the invention, all of which are based on the HydroCopper<br>
process, which is marked in the drawings with a broken line and reference<br>
number 1. According to the invention, it is beneficial to combine the gold<br>
recovery method with the HydroCopper process and the method is in fact<br>
depicted as connected to it. The method and its applications can however<br>
also be connected to other chloride leaching processes.<br>
The gold-containing copper concentrate is routed to leaching stage 2, where<br>
the concentrate is leached with a concentrated solution of alkali chloride. The<br>
copper in solution is oxidised to divalent (Cu2+) using oxidising gas. Both<br>
oxygen-containing gas and chlorine are used as this gas. To simplify<br>
matters, the oxygen-containing gas is marked in the drawing as air, but it can<br>
also be oxygen or oxygen-enriched air. Henceforward in the description of<br>
the invention we will speak of sodium instead of alkali, but sodium can be<br>
replaced as necessary by some other alkali such as potassium.<br>
The copper (I) chloride solution generated in leaching is routed to solution<br>
purification stage 3. The purified solution is routed to precipitation stage 4,<br>
where the copper is precipitated from the solution as copper (I) oxide by<br>
means of sodium hydroxide. The sodium chloride formed is routed to chior-<br>
alkali electrolysis 5, whence the caustic alkali, chlorine and hydrogen<br>
obtained are used in various stages of the process. Copper (I) oxide is<br><br>
reduced using the hydrogen generated in electrolysis into elemental copper<br>
in stage 6. If necessary the product can be smelted and cast. In the leaching<br>
stage of the HydroCopper process some of the gold contained in the<br>
concentrate dissolves and is recovered in stage 7, where gold is recovered<br>
using e.g. activated carbon or ion-exchange resins. The iron and arsenic that<br>
dissolved in chloride leaching are precipitated from the solution by<br>
neutralising it with a suitable alkali before gold recovery (not shown in detail<br>
in the drawing). The alkali needed for neutralisation is obtained from the<br>
electrolysis of the HydroCopper process.<br>
The leaching residue formed in concentrate leaching is routed to separation<br>
stage 8, where elemental sulphur and other secondary substances such as<br>
hematite, ferric arsenate and fine silicate material are separated using<br>
physical separation methods. Fine silicate material is formed if pressure or<br>
bioleaching is used for the final leaching of pyrite. After the separation stage,<br>
the first intermediate product 9 is left, composed mainly of pyrite, the coarser<br>
silicates, arsenopyrite and gold. At least one of the following separation<br>
methods can be used as the physical separation method: flotation, cycloning,<br>
elutriation, retarded settling, thickening, vibration, spiral separation or<br>
another equivalent method, which is applicable to differences in density,<br>
particle size or particle surface characteristics.<br>
Gold is recovered from the first intermediate 9 obtained from the sulphur and<br>
fines separation stage 8 in stage 10 with a method based on gravity<br>
separation 10. The aim is to obtain a gold product with a significantly higher<br>
gold content that the first intermediate. If the gold content of the intermediate<br>
is for instance 30 g/t, the gold content of the product obtained from specific<br>
weight separation may be 1000 - 100 000 g/t. Methods can be used for<br>
separation which separate the gold particles with their high density from<br>
other mineral substances. These methods are e.g. centrifugal separation<br>
(Knelson and Falcon separators), spiral separation, shaking, vibration or<br>
another corresponding method. The gold-rich fraction obtained is returned to<br><br>
the HydroCopper process leaching, shown in the drawing with a broken line,<br>
or if the gold content of the concentrate is high enough, it Is possible to treat<br>
it as a separate product.<br>
The remainder of the first intermediate from the separation of free gold by<br>
gravity separation 10 is routed to the comminution stage 11, where it is<br>
ground to a sufficient fineness that the leaching rate of the sulphide minerals,<br>
which were insoluble thus far, is made to rise substantially. At the same time<br>
the gold, which is in inclusions in the gangue minerals coming with the<br>
concentrate, is released.<br>
Figure 1 presents one preferred leaching method for sulphides. In<br>
accordance with this alternative, the second intermediate 12 is treated in a<br>
sulphate environment in pressure leaching 13, whereby the sulphide<br>
minerals decompose. The temperature in the autoclave is 160-220°C and the<br>
retention time depending on the case between 1-3 hours. The autoclave<br>
waste i.e. the leaching residue contains in this case mainly gold and<br>
undissolved gangue minerals as well as hematite. This fine waste 14 is<br>
routed onwards to the chloride leaching circuit 2 of the main process, where<br>
gold dissolves as a chloride complex and is recovered in the way described<br>
above. As stated earlier, fine gangue minerals go with the leaching residue<br>
from chloride leaching to the physical separation stage 8, where they are<br>
separated from the coarser material. After pressure leaching the solution is<br>
routed to neutralisation stage 15, into which some beneficial neutralising<br>
agent such as limestone is fed. In this case neutralisation mainly gives rise to<br>
precipitate containing gypsum and iron compounds and arsenic, which is<br>
removed from the circuit. The chloride leaching of gold can also be done in a<br>
separate chloride leaching circuit, whereby joint gold recovery 7 can be<br>
utilised. In this case the leaching residue goes directly into the final waste<br>
and does not get mixed with the leaching residue from the main leaching<br>
circuit.<br><br>
The flow chart shown in Figure 2 is like that of Figure 1, except that it shows<br>
yet another way to treat the second intermediate 12 formed in the grinding<br>
stage 11. In this case the intermediate 12 generated in grinding is subjected<br>
to bioleaching 16. In bioleaching the product concerned is treated in a<br>
sulphate solution with bacteria using air for oxidation. The temperature is 30-<br>
60°C and the retention time is typically 3-5 days. The gold-containing waste<br>
17 from bioleaching is routed to the chloride leaching circuit 1 of the<br>
HydroCopper process, in which gold dissolves as a chloride complex and is<br>
recovered in the method described above. The fine gangue minerals in the<br>
waste 17 are separated in the physical separation stage 8. The bioleaching<br>
solution is routed to the neutralisation stage 18, where the acid is neutralised<br>
with some beneficial neutralising agent such as limestone, and iron, arsenic<br>
and gypsum are precipitated. In this case too, chloride leaching of gold may<br>
also be done in a separate chloride leaching circuit, whereby joint gold<br>
recovery 7 can be utilised. In this case the leaching residue goes directly into<br>
the final waste and does not get mixed with the leaching residue from the<br>
main leaching circuit.<br>
The flow chart shown in Figure 3 is like that of Figures 1 and 2, except that it<br>
shows yet another way to treat the second intermediate 12 formed in the<br>
grinding stage 11. The second intermediate 12 is subjected to leaching<br>
treatment 19 in an alkali chloride solution, where a suitable cupric content<br>
and/or ferric ion content are adjusted. The alkali chloride solution is obtained<br>
from a suitable stage of the HydroCopper process (not shown in the<br>
drawing). The oxidising gas used is air, oxygen and/or preferably chlorine<br>
obtained from the HydroCopper process chlorine-alkali electrolysis. The<br>
temperature in leaching is 80-105°C. After leaching the gold-containing<br>
solution 20 is routed to the gold recovery stage 7 of the HydroCopper<br>
process. The leaching residue contains gypsum, iron oxides, ferric arsenate<br>
and gangue minerals such as silicates, which are removed from the circuit.<br><br>
The advantage of the gold recovery method developed here is that the great<br>
majority of gold is recovered in connection with copper recovery and that first<br>
the sulphur and the majority of iron is removed from the precipitate<br>
generated in this connection. Then separation of metallic gold is performed,<br>
after which the final leaching stage is carried out on only a small amount of<br>
the intermediate, which still contains the gold that is difficult to dissolve and is<br>
bound inside the minerals. The residue or solution formed in the final<br>
leaching stage, depending on the leaching method, is routed to the chloride<br>
leaching circuit of the total amount of concentrate, where gold dissolves as a<br>
chloride complex and is recovered in the gold recovery stage of the main<br>
stream.<br>
Example 1<br>
A mixture was made, which was 50% copper concentrate and 50% gold<br>
concentrate. The gold concentrate represented a difficult type and the yield<br>
of gold from it in a 24-hour cyanide leaching test was 3%. Mineralogical<br>
studies showed that the majority of the undissolved gold of the gold<br>
concentrate was bound to pyrite and arsenopyrlte as "invisible gold". The<br>
gold was divided between pyrite and arsenopyrite in roughly a 50:50 ratio.<br>
The chemical composition of the concentrates is shown in Table 1 and the<br>
mineral composition of the main minerals in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
Laboratory-scale chloride leaching was carried out on the combined<br>
concentrate in a 10-litre titanium reactor using HydroCopper process<br>
conditions:<br><br>
Leaching produced a yield of 97.5 % copper and 50.1 % gold. During<br>
leaching, elemental sulphur, goethite and ferric arsenate were formed. A<br>
small amount of sulphide sulphur changed into sulphate form. 74% of the<br><br>
arsenopyrite dissolved, but the degree of dissolution of the pyrite was only<br>
about 4 %. The majority of undissolved gold appeared in the pyrite.<br>
The leaching residue was subjected to treatment based on physical<br>
separation methods, where the aim was mainly to separate elemental<br>
sulphur, iron oxides, ferric arsenate and fine silicate material from the pyrite,<br>
arsenopyrite and coarse silicates. A combination of flotation and elutriation<br>
was used in physical separation. At first flotation of elemental sulphur was<br>
carried out in a flotation cell, where the frother was MIBC (methyl-isobutyl-<br>
carbinol). The pyrite and other coarse material was removed from the<br>
flotation concentrate by mixing it in an elutriation cell, to which at the same<br>
time water was added at a constant rate so that the desired separation limit<br>
was reached. The flotation residue was also treated using the elutriation<br>
method mentioned above, whereby the majority of fine material (fine<br>
silicates, goethite, hematite, ferric arsenate and the remaining sulphur were<br>
separated out. Clean separation was made on the separation overflow,<br>
whereby pyrites and other coarse material were recovered. The coarse<br>
fractions were combined into one product (underflow) and the fine material<br>
into another product (overflow).<br><br>
According to mineralogical examination, the separation product (underflow)<br>
contained about 65% pyrites and 13% gangue minerals. The yield of<br>
In physical separation, solids with a mass of 56.1% of that of the separation<br>
stage feed remained as underflow. The composition of the solids after<br>
treatment was as follows:<br><br>
elemental sulphur in the overflow was about 80% and the yield of pyrite in<br>
the underflow about 90%. The yield of gold in the underflow was 94 %.<br>
The product obtained was pulverised for 25 minutes in a 1-litre attrition mill,<br>
resulting in a particle size of 80 % -12 µm. The product obtained<br>
(=underflow) underwent a chloride leaching test in a 3-litre titanium reactor in<br>
the following conditions:<br><br>
The gold yield in chloride leaching was 85.2 %. The overall yield of gold<br>
from the concentrate (see Table 2) was 92.8%.<br><br>
Example 2.<br>
The product from chloride leaching and physical separation presented in<br>
Example 1 (underflow) was pressure leached in a 1.5-litre titanium autoclave<br>
in the following conditions:<br>
Solids mass: 200 g<br>
Volume of solution: 1.2 litres<br>
Oxygen flow: 1.01/min<br>
Temperature 200°C<br>
Retention time 2 h<br>
Overpressure of oxygen 7 bar<br>
After treatment the solids content was as follows:<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Chloride leaching was carried out on the residue obtained from the pressure<br>
leaching of Example 2 in HydroCopper process conditions.<br>
Volume of solution: 1.2 litres<br>
Mass of solids 0.12 kg<br>
Temperature 95°C<br>
Retention time 24 h<br>
Oxidant: Chlorine gas, air<br>
NaCI 280 g/l<br><br><br>
The gold yield in chloride leaching of the autoclave residue was 93.9%.<br>
When the whole chain is calculated from the original concentrate (Table 2),<br>
the gold yield was 93.8%.<br><br>
