				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of dextrin based<br>
biodegradable adhesive composition useful for bottle labeling (Glass/<br>
aluminium ).<br>
The present invention also relates to a dextrin based  biodegradable<br>
adhesive composition useful for bottle labeling (Glass/ aluminium).<br>
The adhesive produced by this process is useful as a Biodegradable adhesive<br>
for bottle labeling (glass /aluminum etc)<br>
This adhesive has increased the efficiency in the packaging of medicines,<br>
food, pesticide etc. Labeling otherwise would consume a good time. But<br>
with this adhesive, heavy-duty m/c with speeds of up to 60,000 bottles /hr.is<br>
obtained.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
The adhesive available so far in the prior art are based on starch which is<br>
very messy in nature and consequently it slows down the labeling of the<br>
bottles during automatic process.<br>
Summary:<br>
In order to obviate the above drawbacks the inventor has prepared the<br>
adhesive of the present invention.<br><br>
This adhesive of the present invention is Dextrin based. Dextrin are the polysaccharides and may be produced as intermediate products during hydrolysis of starch by heating in the presence of acids and enzymes. The nature and their chemical behavior of Dextrin depend to a great extent on the kind of starch from which they are derived. For example, some react with iodine to give a reddish-brown color, others a blue, and still others yield no color at all.<br>
Dextrin is prepared by heating dry starch or starch treated with acids to produce a colorless or yellowish, tasteless, odorless powder. Both the dextrins i.e. yellow and white are used to produce the adhesive of the present invention. The dextrin is reacted with Borax and or Boric acid at a specific ph range, temperature, and stirring rate and Concentration of the ingredients. Statement of the Invention:<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of dextrin based biodegradable adhesive composition useful for bottle labeling (Glass/ aluminum), the steps comprising of:-<br>
(i)      Mixing dextrin in water in a stirring device at a temperature from 75 to 95° C;<br><br>
(ii)     Mixing borax and /or boric acid to the dextrin solution of<br>
step (i);<br>
(iii)    Mixing glycerol to the mixture of step (ii) at a temperature from 20 to 40° C at the pH from 5   to 9   at the stirring rate of from 50   to 100 rpm; (iv)    Ripening of the mixture obtained in step (iii) for days from 7<br>
to 15   to obtain the desired adhesive.<br>
The invention also provides a dextrin based biodegradable adhesive composition useful for bottle labeling (Glass/ aluminum) , comprising of:-<br>
a.	50 to 70 % dextrin dispersed in water<br>
b.	1 to 3 % borax and /or boric acid to the dextrin solution<br>
c.	0.25 to 0.75 % glycerol<br>
d.	pH of composition is from 5   to 9<br>
Preferred embodiments:<br>
In the process for preparation of dextrin based biodegradable adhesive composition dextrin is mixed preferably at a temperature of 85 to 90° C. In the process for preparation of dextrin based biodegradable adhesive composition preferably borax is added to the solution of dextrin. In the process for preparation of dextrin based biodegradable adhesive composition preferably boric acid is added to the solution of dextrin.<br><br>
In the process for preparation of dextrin based biodegradable adhesive<br>
composition preferably mixture of boric acid and borax is added to the<br>
solution of dextrin.<br>
In the process for preparation of dextrin based biodegradable adhesive<br>
composition glycerol is mixed preferably at a temperature of 35°C.<br>
In the process for preparation of dextrin based biodegradable adhesive<br>
composition  glycerol is mixed at a Ph preferably from 6.0 to 6.5.<br>
In the process for preparation dextrin based biodegradable adhesive<br>
composition wherein glycerol is mixed at a stirring rate preferably in the<br>
range of 60 to 80 rpm.<br>
In the process for preparation of dextrin based biodegradable adhesive<br>
composition ripening of the mixture obtained is   carried out for 8 days.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The reaction of dextrin with glycerin/ glycerol plays a major role. For this<br>
reaction the concentration of glycerin and dextrin at a particular temperature and PH is important. Even the stirring rate of the churner is important. The yellow and or white dextrin was added in water, in a stirring device having a high degree of mechanical efficiency with heating. Borax and or Boric acid added. This gives tack. Add glycerol (natural or synthetic)<br><br>
During the ripening period of few days the viscosity of the adhesive thus produced increased by 10,000 to 30,000 cps. Measured in a Brookfield viscosity.<br>
For the preparation of dextrin based biodegradable adhesive composition dextrin (Yellow or White) is mixed in water in a stirring device at a temperature from 75 to 95° C, then either borax or boric acid or both in mixed form is mixed with the dextrin solution, then glycerol is mixed to the obtained solution at a temperature from 20 to 40° C and pH from 5 to 9 at a stirring rate of from 50 to 100 rpm, then the composition is subjected to the ripening 7 to 15 days and the desired adhesive thus is obtained. The composition thus obtained has the following constitution :-<br>
A 50 to 70 % dextrin dispersed in water<br>
B   1 to 3 % borax and /or boric acid to the dextrin solution<br>
C 0.25 to 0.75 % glycerol<br>
and the pH of composition is kept from 5   to 9.<br>
The composition of the present invention is not a mere admixture but is a synergistic composition resulting in unexpected properties as compared to it's ingredients. No chemical reaction is involved in the formation of the composition.<br><br><br><br>
