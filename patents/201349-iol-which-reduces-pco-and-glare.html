BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to intraocular lenses (IOLs) and, more particularly, to IOLs which inhibit migration or growth of cells from the eye onto the IOL and reduce glare in the eye.<br>
Intraocular lenses (IOLs) are optical devices designed for the replacement of human crystalline lens in the visual correction of aphakia in patients 5 years of age or older. To allow the surgeons flexibility in meeting individual patient requirements, several distinct types of lenses are available from +3 to +30 diopters in 0.5 increments.<br>
A common problem that is experienced with many IOLs following implantation is that cells from the eye, particularly epithelial cells from the capsular bag, tend to grow in front of and/or in back of the optic of the IOL, which is called as secondary opacification. Secondary opacification occurs mainly due to implantation in an aphakic eye where the natural lens has been removed due to damage or disease (e.g., a cataractous lens). This tends to block the optic of the IOL and to impair vision.<br>
The current invention is about the IOL designed to reduce the unwanted accumulation of lens epithelial cells (LECs) between the posterior surface of IOL and posterior capsular bag, known as posterior capsule opacification or "PCO" to those skilled in the art.<br>
Posterior capsule opacification is occurred due to the chronic migration of lens epithelial cells under the IOL posterior surface. Er:YAG laser capsulotomy, is the only option used to make perforations over the posterior capsule which let the light transmit. Posterior capsule physically separates the vitreous humor and aqueous humor. The perforation made on the posterior capsule may trigger the contact / mix up of aqueous and vitreous humour, which in turn lead to unwanted complications. Hence it highly desired to avoid posterior capsule opacification in the first place itself<br>
Several methods have been practiced to mitigate the PCO. Few of them are explained below.<br>
Dr. Nishi et al clinically proved that a sharp, discontinuous bend in the posterior capsule wall sharply minimizes the PCO, which is published in Journal of Cataract &amp; Refractive Surgery, Vol. 25, January 1999. This discontinuous bend in the posterior capsule wall can be created using an IOL having a posterior edge which forms a sharp edge.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,620,013 to Bretton entitled "Method For Destroying Residual Lens Epithelial Cells" disclosed the method of using ophthalmic agents, which will destroy the Lens Epithelial Cells. However this method was not much appreciated by the surgeons as the usage of these chemical agents leads to some other complications.<br>
Designing the IOL as to have a sharp peripheral edge specifically at the posterior surface—peripheral edge juncture to create a discontinuous bend in the posterior capsule wall is considered as the best option.<br>
Since published report of Nishi et al, the entire IOL industry dived into creating IOLs with sharp posterior edges so as to create a sharp, discontinuous bend in the posterior capsule wall. Though the square edge IOLs prevent the PCO compared to IOLs having rounded edges, as the surgeons look for some better IOL designs because of the following the reasons.<br>
1)	Edge glare in the square edge IOLs<br>
2)	PCO incase of IOL movement within the capsular bag<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invented lOLs are effectively reduces PCO and edge glare, in the eye resulting from the presence of the 10L. The invented IOL is unique in design and construction and produces substantial benefits in use in the eye.<br>
Irk the broad aspect, the present [invented IOL is an eye implant and comprises an optic having a central optical axis, an anterior surface, a posterior surface and a peripheral edge. The optic, which acts as visual zone converges the light rays into the retina. In a very useful embodiment, the IOLs further comprise at least one anchorage, preferably two anchorages, and more preferably two elongated anchorages, coupled to the optic for easy implantation.<br>
Ill a chosen aspect, the present invention provides a reduced-glare intraocular lens including an optic acts as a visual zone for converging the light rays on the retina of the eye. The optic comprises central optical axis, an anterior surface, a posterior surface, and a peripheral edge. The peripheral edge consists one more surface which is linear in cross-sectional pattern. This surface is oriented other than parallel to the central optical axis and a rounded transition surface.<br>
The peripheral edge and the anterior or posterior surface intersect to form at least one peripheral edge corner. This edge corner acts as a discontinuity between the peripheral edge and the intersecting anterior or posterior surface.<br>
The second part of present invention, a reduced-glare intraocular lens implantable in an eye comprises optic acts as a visual zone for converging the light rays on the retina of the eye. The optic comprises central optical axis, an anterior surface, a posterior surface, and a peripheral edge. The peripheral edge comprises one surface with a linear cross-sectional pattern that is oriented other than parallel to the central optical axis and a rounded transition surface. Advantageously, the ACO and PCO more inhibited relative to a identical intraocular lens without the posterior corner, and reduced glare is obtained in the eye relative to a identical intraocular lens having a peripheral limear surface that is parallel to the central optical axis. The optic may include a convex surface on the peripheral edge defining a transition surface between the anterior face and the linear surface. A second linear surface that is parallel with respect to the optical axis may also be provided. In addition, the optic may include first and second linear surfaces, wherein the first linear surface is anteriorly-facing and second linear surface is parallel with respect to the optical axis.<br>
Further the present invention, is an eye implant includes an optic converge the light rays into the retina and occupies the capsular bag. The optic includes a peripheral edge lies between an anterior surface and a posterior surface which imitates a conical form. The conical surface can either be posteriorly-facing or anteriorly facing. The conical surface enhance light transmission from the optic comparatively to a identical intraocular lens with a peripheral edge surface parallel to the optical axis.<br>
The third aspect of present invention is an intraocular lens contains an optic which inturn have a central optical axis, an anterior surface, and a posterior surface. A peripheral edge lies between the anterior surface and the posterior surface includes, in cross-section, a linear edge surface terminating at its anterior side in an anterior edge corner. An anterior land adjacent the anterior edge corner, wherein the linear edge surface arid the anterior land define an acute included angle so as: to increase transmission of light from the optic through the conical surface relative to a substantially identical intraocular lens with a linear edge surface and anterior land that define an included angle of 90.degree, or more.<br><br>
The fourth aspect of the present invention provides an intraocular lens optic consisting optical axis, an anterior surface, and a posterior surface. Two linear edge surfaces that are not parallel to the optical axis but angled radially inwardly toward each other to meet an apex forms the peripheral edge of the optic.<br>
In the fifth aspect, the peripheral edge of the present IOLs is formed by two surfaces. Out of these two surfaces one will be a flat surface that is either parallel to the optical axis or not. The other surface will surely be not parallel to the optical axis and in the direction between the anterior and posterior faces of the optic.<br>
The present 10L achieves the reduced glare in the eye relative to the glare obtained with a identical IOL having a peripheral edge parallel to the central optical axis in the direction between the faces of the optic. Part of the peripheral edge, a portion of the anterior surface close to the peripheral edge and a portion posterior surface close to peripheral edge may be at least partially opaque. This opacity is effective in reducing glare and the opacity can be created by means of physical or chemical roughening.<br>
In the sixth aspect the peripheral edge and one or both of the anterior surface and the posterior surface intersect to forge a corner edge located at a discontinuity between the peripheral edge and the intersecting face. All those faces meet exactly at 90 degree to form a very sharp and abrupt edge corner. This abrupt corner is effective in inhibiting migration of cells from the capsular bag onto the IOL optic.<br>
The peripheral edge and the intersecting surface or surfaces intersect at an angle or angles preferably in a range of about 30 degree to about 130 degree, more preferably in a range of about 50,degree. to about 110.degree. This angular intersection effectively inhibits endothelial cell migration over the anterior surface and/or posterior face of the optic of the present IOL.<br>
In one very useful embodiment, either the anterior face or the posterior face has a peripheral region lyijng between the peripheral edge and peripheral regions. The peripheral region or regions are substantially planar, and may or may not be substantially perpendicular to the central optical axis. However, only the anterior surface with peripheral region, which is planar and perpendicular to the central optical axis is preferred. The peripheral region preferably has a radial dimension of at least about 0.05 mm, and more preferably no greater than about 1.8 mm. The dimension of the optic edge is thinner compared to central optical axis.<br>
Normally, the peripheral edge and/or the peripheral region or regions circumscribe the central optical axis. The anterior surface and the posterior surface are generally circular in configuration. However oval, elliptical and the like configurations may be employed. At least one of the anterior and posterior surfaces has an additional region, located radially inwardly of the peripheral region, which is other than substantially planar.<br>
The scope of the present invention covers the each and every combination of two or more features described herein.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIG. 1 shows an IOL 5 which generally comprises an optic 4 and fixation members 2 and 6. In this embodiment, the optic 4 may be considered as effective for focusing light on or near the retina of the eye. Optical axis 3 passes through the center of optic 4 in a direction generally transverse to the plane of the optic.<br>
In this embodiment, the optic 4 is circular in plan and bi-convex approaching the optical axis 3. However, this configuration is clearly illustrative as other configurations and shapes may be employed. The optic 4 may be constructed of any of the commonly employed materials used for rigid optics, such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), or commonly employed materials used for resiliency deformable optics, such as silicone polymeric materials, acrylic polymeric materials, hydrogel-forming polymeric materials, mixtures thereof and the like.<br><br>
The fixation members 2 and 6 in this embodiment are generally C-shaped and are integral with the optic 4. However, this is purely illustrative of the fixation members 2 and 6 as the fixation members may be of other configurations and/or may be separate members affixed to the optic 4 in any of a variety of conventional ways.<br>
With particular reference to FIG. 3, the optic 9 has an anterior face 11, a posterior face 12, an anterior peripheral region 2, a posterior peripheral region 6 and a peripheral edge surface 4. The peripheral edge surface 4 has a continuously curved, concave configuration, for example, in cross-section. The peripheral edge surface 4 intersects anterior peripheral region 2 at anterior peripheral corner edge 3 at an angle of about 70.degree. Corner edge 3 is at a discontinuity between anterior face 11 (anterior peripheral region 3) and peripheral edge surface 4, and circumscribes optical axis 10. Peripheral edge surface 4 intersects posterior peripheral region 6 at posterior peripheral corner edge 5 at an angle of about 70.degree.. Corner edge 5 is at a discontinuity between posterior face 12 (posterior peripheral region 6) and peripheral edge surface 4, and circumscribes optical axis 10.<br>
The anterior and posterior peripheral regions 2 and 6 extend radially inwardly, for example, for a distance of about 0.1 mm to about 1.0 mm or more (about 0.5 mm as shown in FIG. 3), from the peripheral edge surface 4, and peripheral corner edge 3 and 5 respectively, and are substantially planar, more particularly, substantially perpendicular to the optical axis 10 of optic 9. Anterior face 11 includes an additional anterior region 8 which is convex, not planar. Posterior face 12 includes an additional posterior region 7 which also is convex, not planar. The dimension of optic 9 between anterior face 11 and posterior face 12 at the peripheral regions 2 and 6 is smaller than the same dimension at the optical axis 10.<br>
It is found that implanting IOL 1 in the capsular bag of an eye effectively inhibits or retards cell migration or growth, for example, epithelial cell migration or growth, from the eye onto and/or over the anterior and posterior faces 11 and 12 of optic 9. In addition, it is found that a reduced amount of edge glare is obtained with the IOL 1 implanted in the capsular bag of the eye.<br>
Without wishing to limit the invention to any particular theory of operation, it is believed that the present IOL 1 provides for inhibition of cell migration or growth onto and/or over the optic 9 because of the sharp or abrupt peripheral corner edges 3 and 5. Thus, it is believed that the cells from the eye have a reduced tendency to grow onto and/or over the anterior face 11 and posterior face 12 relative to a substantially identical IOL without such peripheral corner edge. In addition, it is believed that the reduced glare obtained using the present IOL 1 results from the curved configuration of the peripheral edge surface 4. Thus, IOL 1 including the substantially continuously curved peripheral edge surface 4 provides reduced glare relative to a substantially similar IOL having a peripheral edge surface which is substantially parallel, for example, in cross-section, to the optical axis of the IOL.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a prior art IOL 1 which has planar peripheral regions 2 and 3 and sharp<br><br>
peripheral corner edges 4 and 5 on the anterior and posterior faces 6 and 7, respectively, but has a peripheral edge surface 8 which is parallel, rather than substantially continuously curved, to the optical axis 9. Although the prior art IOL 1 does provide some degree of inhibition of cell growth, it does not provide reduced edge glare as do the IOLs in accordance with the present invention.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates an alternate embodiment of an IOL in accordance with the present invention. This IOL is shown generally at 1 of FIG 1. Except as expressly described herein, IOL 7 is structured and functions similarly to IOL 7. Components of IOL 7 which correspond to components of IOL 1 of FIG 1 are indicated by the same reference numeral increased by 100.<br>
The principal difference between IOL 7 of FIG 4 and IOL 1 of FIG 1 relates to the shape of the anterior face 1 of FIG 4 and the shape of posterior face 6 of FIG 4. Specifically, anterior face 1 is convex throughout, and IOL 7 does not include a substantially planar anterior peripheral region. This convex anterior face 1 intersects peripheral edge surface 3 at sharp anterior peripheral corner edge 2. Similarly, posterior face 6 is convex throughout, and IOL 7 does not include a substantially planar posterior peripheral region. This convex posterior face 6 intersects peripheral edge surface 3 at sharp posterior peripheral corner edge 4. The specific configuration of anterior face 1 and posterior face 6 can be independently provided to address the needs of any given specific application including the following factors; the vision correction or corrections desired, the size of optic 5, the size of the eye in which IOL 7 is to be placed and the like factors. IOL 7 inhibits or retards cell migration or growth and provides a reduced amount of edge glare as does IOL 5 of FIG 1, described above.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a further embodiment of an IOL in accordance with the present invention. This IOL is shown generally at 1. Except as expressly described herein, IOL 1 is structured and functions similarly to IOL 7 of FIG 4. Components of IOL 1 which correspond to components of IOL 7 of FIG 4 are indicated by the same reference numeral increased by 100.<br>
The principal difference between IOL 1 and IOL 7 of FIG 4 relates to the shape of peripheral edge surface 4. Specifically, the curvature of peripheral edge surface 4 is more complex relative to the curvature of peripheral edge surface 3 of FIG 4. In particular, the curvature of edge surface 4 varies substantially continuously while the curvature of edge surface 3 of FIG 4 is a substantially constant concave arc (in cross-section). Peripheral edge surface 4 is configured to reduce the amount of edge glare obtained with IOL 1 in the eye relative to, for example, IOL 1 of FIG 2. The specific configuration or curvature of peripheral edge surface 4 is provided to address the needs of a specific application, including the following factors: the size of the optic 2, the size of the eye in which the IOL 7 of FIG 4 is to be placed and the like factors.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates an additional embodiment of the present invention. The IOL illustrated in FIG. 6 is shown generally at 1 of FIG 1. Except as expressly described herein, IOL 1 of FIG 4 is structured and functions similarly to IOL 7 of FIG 4. Components of IOL 1 pf<br><br>
FIG 6 which correspond to components of IOL 7 of FIG 4 are indicated by the same reference numeral increased by 200.<br>
The primary difference between IOL 1 of FIG 6 and IOL 7 of FIG 4 relates to the configuration of peripheral edge surface 2. Specifically, the curvature of peripheral edge surface 2 varies substantially continuously (in a manner which is substantially the reverse of the curvature of peripheral edge surface 4 of FIG 5 while the curvature of edge 3 of FIG 4 is a substantially constant concave arc (in cross-section). The peripheral edge surface 2 of FIG 6 is effective in reducing the glare caused by the presence of IOL 1 of FIG 6 in the eye relative to the glare obtained with IOL 1 of FIG 2 in the eye.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates an additional embodiment of an IOL in accordance with the present invention. Except as expressly described herein, this IOL, shown generally at 1 of FIG 7 is structured and functions similarly to IOL 7 of FIG 4. Components of IOL 1 of FIG 7 which correspond to components of IOL 7 of FIG 4 are indicated by the same reference numeral increased by 300.<br>
The primary difference between IOL 1 of FIG 7 and IOL 7 of FIG 4relates to the configuration of the peripheral edge surface 5. Specifically, peripheral edge surface 5 includes a first portion 4 which is concave relative to the optical axis 9 of IOL 1 of FIG 7. Peripheral edge surface 5 also includes a second portion 6 which is convex relative to the optical axis 9 of IOL 1 of FIG 1. Thus, the curvature of the peripheral edge surface of the present IOLs, for example, peripheral edge surface 5 of IOL 1 of FIG 7, can be relatively complex. Peripheral edge surface 5 is effective to provide reduced glare in the eye relative to IOL 1 of FIG 2. In addition, it should be noted that the peripheral edge surface 5 intersects anterior face 2, at anterior peripheral corner edge 3 at an angle of about 90.degree.. Similarly, the peripheral edge surface 5 intersects posterior peripheral region 5 at posterior peripheral corner edge 7 at an angle of about 90.degree..<br>
IOL 1 of FIG 7, as with all of the IOLs in accordance with the present invention, is effective in inhibiting or retarding cell migration or growth from the eye onto or over the optic 8.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a further alternate embodiment of an IOL in accordance with the present invention. This IOL is shown generally at 1 of FIG 6. Except as expressly described herein, IOL 1 of FIG 6 is structured and functions substantially similarly to IOL 1 of FIG 2. Components of IOL 1 of FIG 5 which correspond to components of IOL 1 of FIG 2 are indicated by the same reference numeral increased by 400.<br>
The primary differences between IOL 1 of FIG 6 and IOL 1 of FIG 2 relate to the configuration of peripheral edge surface 3 and the configuration of the intersection between anterior face 2 and peripheral edge surface 3 of optic 1. Specifically, peripheral edge surface 3 has a continuously curved configuration somewhat similar to peripheral edge surface 5 of FIG 7 of IOL 1 of FIG 7. Also, the anterior face 2 intersects peripheral edge surface 3 on a curve (that is on a continuity not at a discontinuity). In other words, the intersection of anterior face 2 and peripheral edge surface 3 is smooth or continuous,<br><br>
not sharp or discontinuous.<br>
IOL 1 of FIG 8 is effective in reducing the amount of glare obtained with IOL 1 of FIG 8 in the eye relative to IOL 1 of FIG 2 in the eye. Also, IOL 1 of FIG 7 is effective in retarding or inhibiting migration from the eye onto and/or over cell growth or migration from the eye onto and/or over the posterior face 5 of IOL 1 of FIG 8.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a still further embodiment of an IOL in accordance with the present invention. Except as expressly described herein, this IOL, shown generally at 1 of FIG 9 is structured and functions similarly to IOL 1 of FIG 2. Components of IOL 1 of FIG 9 which correspond to components of IOL 1 of FIG 4 are indicated by the same reference numeral increased by 500.<br>
The primary difference between IOL 1 of FIG 9 and IOL 1 of FIG 2 relates to the configuration of the peripheral edge surface 4 and to the configuration of posterior face 7. Specifically, peripheral edge surface 4 is convex relative to the optical axis 8 of IOL 1 of FIG 9. Peripheral edge surface 4 does not intersect anterior face 2 at a sharp or discontinuous corner edge, but does intersect posterior face 7 at an obtuse angle at posterior peripheral corner 5. Posterior face 7 includes a peripheral region 6 which is substantially perpendicular to optical axis 8. Anterior face 2 includes a peripheral region 3 which is roughened so that region 3 is at least partially opaque to the transmission of light. The combination of the convex peripheral edge surface 4 and the at least partially opaque peripheral region 3 of FIG 8 is particularly effective in reducing glare, for example, from corner 5, obtained with IOL 8 in the eye.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates still another embodiment of an IOL in accordance with the present invention. This IOL is shown generally at 1 of FIG 10. Except as expressly described herein, IOL 1 of FIG 10 is structured and functions substantially similarly to IOL 1 of FIG 2. Components of IOL 1 of FIG 10 which correspond to components of IOL 1 of FIG 2 arc indicated by the same reference numeral increased by 600.<br>
The primary differences between IOL 1 of FIG 10 and IOL 1 of 2 relate to the configuration of peripheral edge surface 2, the configuration of the intersection between anterior face 2 and peripheral edge surface 5 of optic 1 of FIG 10 and the configuration of posterior face 11. Peripheral edge surface 5 includes a first portion 4 which is convex relative to optic axis 12 of IOL 1 of FIG 10. Peripheral edge surface 5 also includes a second portion 7 which transitions from first portion 4 and intersects posterior 11 at corner 8. Peripheral edge surface 5 does not intersect anterior face 2 at a sharp or discontinuance corner edge. Posterior face 11 includes a peripheral region 7 which is substantially perpendicular to optical axis 12. Anterior face 2 includes the peripheral region 3 which is roughened so that region 3 is at least partially opaque to the transmission of light. Region 59 of peripheral edge surface 5 and region 9 of posterior face 11 are also roughened to be at least partially opaque to the transmission of light. The combination of the peripheral edge surface 5 and the at least partially opaque regions 4, 6 and 8 is particularly effective in reducing glare, for example, from corner edge 9, obtained with IOL 10 in the eye.<br><br><br><br><br>
