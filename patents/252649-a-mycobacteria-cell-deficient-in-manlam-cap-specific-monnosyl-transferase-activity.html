				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan cap-specific mannosyl transferases and nucleic acid encoding such transferases. The invention further relates to Mycobacteria that are deficient in lipoarabinomannan cap-specific mannosyl transferases and that express mannose cap-deficient lipoarabinomannans.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Tuberculosis (TB) kills approximately 2 million persons each year. The disease is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The vaccine that currently is in use is, however, not considered to be adequate. This vaccine is referred to as BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin, after the two French scientists who developed it) and it consists of an attenuated strain of M. bovis (a close relative of M. tuberculosis). The BCG vaccine was developed more than 80 years ago, and protects mainly against childhood TB, and not against pulmonary disease later in life. Moreover, protective efficacy varies widely and in some studies efficacy in fact was found to be zero.<br>
Recent data suggest that the ability of BCG to cause immunosuppression is a major factor hindering adequate protective immunity. This ability to immunosuppress is also found in TB itself: while more than one third of the world's population is infected, "only" 10% actually develops active TB, while in the other 90% the bacterium resides in an inactive (dormant) state inside macrophages in the form of so-called granuloma's, i.e. fused macrophages with intracellular mycobacteria, surrounded by immune cells (B- and T-cells) and an outermost layer of fibroblast thus "encapsulating" the infected foci. In this form M. tuberculosis persists in a lifelong truce with the host.<br>
Mycobacteria express a surface glycolipid called lipoarabinomannan (LAM; 1) and there is ample in vitro evidence that LAM contributes to bacterial persistence by alternatively activating macrophages and/or dendritic cells (DC) such that the host immune response is crippled, which results in immunosuppression (4,11,15). LAM of certain mycobacterial species, including M. tuberculosis, is biosynthesized with a so-called mannose cap. This mannose cap is a short mannan chain (of one, two or three mannoses) on the non-reducing end of the arabinan domain. Mannose-capped LAM is<br>
also referred to as manLAM. The non-pathogenic mycobacterium M. smegmatis expresses a LAM that naturally lacks a mannose cap (also referred to as araLAM).<br>
Apart form the diverse effects that manLAM has versus araLAM on cytokine profiles of DC, two research groups have found that manLAM but not araLAM inhibits fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes (12, 13). Inhibition of phago-lysososome fusion is seen as one of the hallmarks of infection with pathogenic mycobacteria. Thus, two lines of evidence suggest an important role of LAM in mycobacterial pathogenesis. However, until now all studies have been done with purified manLAM (from M. tuberculosis or M. bovis) and araLAM (from M. smegmatis), and these LAMs cannot be considered to be isogenic. In particular araLAM from M. smegmatis and manLAM from M. tuberculosis or M. bovis structurally differ in more than only the absence or presence of a mannose cap. Therefore it cannot be excluded that the observed differences in biological effects between of manLAM and araLAM are caused by other differences in LAM structure than the mannose cap.<br>
Apart from playing a role in bacterial persistence, the presence of a mannose cap may be of relevance to the inability of current TB vaccines tot elicit an effective immune response. There is ample evidence that the ability of the BCG vaccine to cause immunosuppression is a major factor hindering adequate protective immunity (6, 3, 9, 7). There is thus a need to investigate whether a capless BCG mutant would cause less immunosuppression and hence would serve as a more effective vaccine against TB.<br>
However, at present it is not known which mycobacterial genes and gene products (enzymes) are involved in the biosynthesis of the manLAM mannose cap. Let alone that it is known that viable capless mutants can be obtained.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide for nucleotide and amino acid sequences involved in the biosynthesis of mycobacterial manLAM mannose caps. It is a further object of the invention to provide for novel mycobacterial mutants that are deficient in the biosynthesis of manLAM mannose caps and to provide for effective vaccines that comprises such mutants or components thereof as well as methods for their production.<br>
Description of the invention Definitions:<br>
The term "gene" means a DNA fragment comprising a region (transcribed region), which is transcribed into an RNA molecule (e.g. an mRNA) in a cell, operably linked to suitable regulatory regions (e.g. a promoter). A gene may thus comprise several operably linked fragments, such as a promoter, a 5' leader sequence, a coding region and a 3'nontranslated sequence (3'end) comprising e.g. transcription termination sequences. "Expression of a gene" refers to the process wherein a DNA region which is operably linked to appropriate regulatory regions, particularly a promoter, is transcribed into an RNA, which is biologically active, i.e. which is capable of being translated into a biologically active protein or peptide or which is active itself (e.g. in post-transcriptional gene silencing or RNAi). The 5'-end of the coding sequence may encode a (homologous or heterologous) secretion signal, so that the encoded protein or peptide is secreted out of the cell. The coding sequence is preferably in sense-orientation and encodes a desired, biologically active protein or protein fragment.<br>
A "chimeric" or "recombinant" gene refers to any gene, which is not normally found in nature in a species, in particular a gene in which different parts of the nucleic acid region are not associated in nature with each other. For example the promoter is not associated in nature with part or all of the transcribed region or with another regulatory region. The term "chimeric gene" is understood to include expression constructs in which a promoter or transcription regulatory sequence is operably linked to one or more coding sequences.<br>
The term "nucleic acid sequence" (or nucleic acid molecule) refers to a DNA or RNA molecule in single or double stranded form, particularly a DNA encoding a protein or protein fragment according to the invention. An "isolated nucleic acid sequence" refers to a nucleic acid sequence which is no longer in the natural environment from which it was isolated, e.g. the nucleic acid sequence in a bacterial host cell or in the plant nuclear or plastid genome.<br>
A "nucleic acid construct" or "nucleic acid vector" is herein understood to mean a man-made nucleic acid molecule resulting from the use of recombinant DNA technology. The term "nucleic acid construct" therefore does not include naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules although a nucleic acid construct may comprise (parts of) naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules.<br>
The term peptide herein refers to any molecule comprising a chain of amino acids that are linked in peptide bonds. The term peptide thus includes oligopeptides, polypeptides and proteins, including multimeric proteins, without reference to a specific mode of action, size, 3-dimensional structure or origin. A "fragment" or "portion" of a protein may thus still be referred to as a "protein". An "isolated protein" is used to refer to a protein which is no longer in its natural environment, for example in vitro or in a recombinant host cell. The term peptide also includes post-expression modifications of peptides, e.g. glycosylations, acetylations, phosphorylations, and the like. A "truncated protein" refers herein to a protein which is reduced in amino acid length compared to the wild type protein.<br>
A "chimeric protein" or "hybrid protein" is a protein composed of various protein "domains" (or motifs) which is not found as such in nature but which a joined to form a functional protein, which displays the functionality of the joined domains (for example receptor binding). A chimeric protein may also be a fusion protein of two or more proteins occurring in nature. The term "domain" as used herein means any part(s) or domain(s) of the protein with a specific structure or function that can be transferred to another protein for providing a new hybrid protein with at least the functional characteristic of the domain.<br>
The term "expression vector" refers to nucleotide sequences that are capable of affecting expression of a gene in host cells or host organisms compatible with such sequences. These expression vectors typically include at least suitable transcription and translation regulatory sequences and optionally, 3' transcription termination signals. DNA encoding the polypeptides of the present invention will typically be incorporated into the expression vector. The expression vector will be introduced into a suitable host cell and be able to effect expression of the coding sequence in an in vitro cell culture of the host cell. The expression vector preferably is suitable for replication in a prokaryotic host.<br>
As used herein, the term "promoter" or "transcription regulatory sequence" refers to a nucleic acid fragment that functions to control the transcription of one or more coding sequences, and is located upstream with respect to the direction of transcription of the transcription initiation site of the coding sequence, and is structurally identified by the presence of a binding site for DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, transcription initiation sites and any other DNA sequences, including, but not limited to transcription<br>
factor binding sites, represser and activator protein binding sites, and any other sequences of nucleotides known to one of skill in the art to act directly or indirectly to regulate the amount of transcription from the promoter. A "constitutive" promoter is a promoter that is active in most tissues under most physiological and developmental conditions. An "inducible" promoter is a promoter that is physiologically regulated, e.g. by the application of a chemical inducer.<br>
The term "selectable marker" is a term familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art and is used herein to describe any genetic entity which, when expressed, can be used to select for a cell or cells containing the selectable marker. Selectable markers may be dominant or recessive or bidirectional. The selectable marker may be a gene coding for a product which confers antibiotic resistance to a cell expressing the gene or a non-antibiotic marker gene, such as a gene relieving other types of growth inhibition, i.e. a marker gene which allow cells containing the gene to grow under otherwise growth-inhibitory conditions. Examples of such genes include a gene which confers prototrophy to an auxotrophic strain, e.g. dal genes introduced in a dal" strain (cf. B. Diderichsen in Bacillus: Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology Applications, A. T. Ganesan and J. A. Hoch, Eds., Academic Press, 1986, pp. 35-46) or a thy gene introduced in a thy'-cell (cf. Gryczan and Dubnau (1982), Gene, 20, 459-469) or a gene which enables a cell harbouring the gene to grow under specific conditions such as an amdS gene, the expression of which enables a cell harbouring the gene to grow on acetamide as the only nitrogen or carbon source (e.g. as described in EP 635 574), or a gene which confers resistance towards a heavy metal (e.g. arsenite, arsenate, antimony, cadmium or organo-mercurial compounds) to a cell expressing the gene. Cells surviving under these conditions will either be cells containing the introduced DNA construct in an extrachromosomal state or cells in which the above structure has been integrated. Alternatively, the selectable marker gene may be one conferring immunity to a cell expressing the gene. The term "reporter" may be used interchangeably with marker, although it is mainly used to refer to visible markers, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP).<br>
As used herein, the term "operably linked" refers to a linkage of polynucleotide elements in a functional relationship. A nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a transcription regulatory sequence is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects<br>
the transcription of the coding sequence. Operably linked means that the DNA sequences being linked are typically contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein encoding regions, contiguous and in reading frame.<br>
The term "ortholog" of a gene or protein refers herein to the homologous gene or protein found in another species, which has the same function as the gene or protein, but is (usually) diverged in sequence from the time point on when the species harbouring the genes diverged (i.e. the genes evolved from a common ancestor by speciation).<br>
The term "homologous" when used to indicate the relation between a given (recombinant) nucleic acid or polypeptide molecule and a given host organism or host cell, is understood to mean that in nature the nucleic acid or polypeptide molecule is produced by a host cell or organisms of the same species, preferably of the same variety or strain. If homologous to a host cell, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide will typically (but not necessarily) be operably linked to another (heterologous) promoter sequence and, if applicable, another (heterologous) secretory signal sequence and/or terminator sequence than in its natural environment. It is understood that the regulatory sequences, signal sequences, terminator sequences, etc. may also be homologous to the host cell. In this context, the use of only "homologous" sequence elements allows the construction of "self-cloned" genetically modified organisms (GMO's).<br>
"Self-cloning" is defined herein as in European Directive 98/81/EC Annex II: Self-cloning consists in the removal of nucleic acid sequences from a cell of an organism which may or may not be followed by reinsertion of all or part of that nucleic acid (or a synthetic equivalent) with or without prior enzymic or mechanical steps, into cells of the same species or into cells of phylogenetically closely related species which can exchange genetic material by natural physiological processes where the resulting micro-organism is unlikely to cause disease to humans, animals or plants. Self-cloning may include the use of recombinant vectors with an extended history of safe use in the particular micro-organisms.<br>
When used to indicate the relatedness of two nucleic acid sequences the term "homologous" means that one single-stranded nucleic acid sequence may hybridise to a complementary single-stranded nucleic acid sequence. The degree of hybridisation may depend on a number of factors including the amount of identity between the sequences<br>
and the hybridisation conditions such as temperature and salt concentration as discussed later.<br>
The term "substantially identical", "substantial identity" or "essentially similar" or "essential similarity" means that two peptide or two nucleotide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default parameters, share at least a certain percentage of sequence identity as defined elsewhere herein. GAP uses the Needleman and Wunsch global alignment algorithm to align two sequences over their entire length, maximizing the number of matches and minimizes the number of gaps. Generally, the GAP default parameters are used, with a gap creation penalty = 50 (nucleotides) / 8 (proteins) and gap extension penalty = 3 (nucleotides) / 2 (proteins). For nucleotides the default scoring matrix used is nwsgapdna and for proteins the default scoring matrix is Blosum62 (Henikoff &amp; Henikoff, 1992, PNAS 89, 915-919). It is clear than when RNA sequences are said to be essentially similar or have a certain degree of sequence identity with DNA sequences, thymine (T) in the DNA sequence is considered equal to uracil (U) in the RNA sequence.<br>
Sequence alignments and scores for percentage sequence identity may be determined using computer programs, such as the GCG Wisconsin Package, Version 10.3, available from Accelrys Inc., 9685 Scranton Road, San Diego, CA 92121-3752 USA or the open-source software Emboss for Windows (current version 2.7.1-07). Alternatively percent similarity or identity may be determined by searching against databases such as FASTA, BLAST, etc.<br>
Optionally, in determining the degree of "amino acid similarity", the skilled person may also take into account so-called "conservative" amino acid substitutions, as will be clear to the skilled person. Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulphur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution<br>
groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, and asparagine-glutamine. Substitutional variants of the amino acid sequence disclosed herein are those in which at least one residue in the disclosed sequences has been removed and a different residue inserted in its place. Preferably, the amino acid change is conservative. Preferred conservative substitutions for each of the naturally occurring amino acids are as follows: Ala to ser; Arg to lys; Asn to gin or his; Asp to glu; Cys to ser or ala; Gin to asn; Glu to asp; Gly to pro; His to asn or gin; He to leu or val; Leu to ile or val; Lys to arg; gin or glu; Met to leu or ile; Phe to met, leu or tyr; Ser to thr; Thr to ser; Trp to tyr; Tyr to trp or phe; and, Val to ile or leu.<br>
Nucleotide sequences encoding mannosyl transferases of the invention may also be defined by their capability to "hybridise" with the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO. 7 or SEQ ID NO. 8, under moderate, or preferably under stringent hybridisation conditions. "Stringent hybridisation" conditions are herein defined as conditions that allow a nucleic acid sequence of at least about 25, preferably about 50 nucleotides, 75 or 100 and most preferably of about 200 or more nucleotides, to hybridise at a temperature of about 65 °C in a solution comprising about 1 M salt, preferably 6 x SSC or any other solution having a comparable ionic strength, and washing at 65°C in a solution comprising about 0.1 M salt, or less, preferably 0.2 x SSC or any other solution having a comparable ionic strength. Preferably, the hybridisation is performed overnight, i.e. at least for 10 hours and preferably washing is performed for at least one hour with at least two changes of the washing solution. These conditions will usually allow the specific hybridisation of sequences having about 90% or more sequence identity.<br>
"Moderate conditions" are herein defined as conditions that allow a nucleic acid sequences of at least 50 nucleotides, preferably of about 200 or more nucleotides, to hybridise at a temperature of about 45°C in a solution comprising about 1 M salt, preferably 6 x SSC or any other solution having a comparable ionic strength, and washing at room temperature in a solution comprising about 1 M salt, preferably 6 x SSC or any other solution having a comparable ionic strength. Preferably, the hybridisation is performed overnight, i.e. at least for 10 hours, and preferably washing is performed for at least one hour with at least two changes of the washing solution. These conditions will usually allow the specific hybridisation of sequences having up to 50% sequence identity. The person skilled in the art will be able to modify these<br>
hybridisation conditions in order to specifically identify sequences varying in identity between 50% and 90%.<br>
"Adjuvants" are herein defined to include any substance or compound that, when used in combination with an antigen, to immunise a mammal, preferably a human, stimulates the immune system, thereby provoking, enhancing or facilitating the immune response against the antigen, preferably without generating a specific immune response to the adjuvant itself. Preferred adjuvants enhance the immune response against a given antigen by at least a factor of 1.5, 2, 2.5, 5, 10 or 20, as compared to the immune response generated against the antigen under the same conditions but in the absence of the adjuvant. Tests for determining the statistical average enhancement of the immune response against a given antigen as produced by an adjuvant in a group of animals or humans over a corresponding control group are available in the art. The adjuvant preferably is capable of enhancing the immune response against at least two different antigens. The adjuvant of the invention will usually be a compound that is foreign to a mammal, thereby excluding immunostimulatory compounds that are endogenous to mammals, such as e.g. interleukins, interferons and other hormones.<br>
Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) as well as its related precursors, lipomannan (LM) and phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs), are glycolipids that are found interspersed in the mycobacterial cell wall. PIMs, LM and LAM are major lipoglycans that are non-covalently attached to the plasma membrane through their phosphatidyl-myo-inositol anchor and extend to the exterior of the cell wall. In LAM (and in LM), an al,6-linked Manp backbone substituted at C-2 by single Manp units constitutes the mannan domain. The arabinan polymer is a linear a(l→5)-linked arabinofuranosyl backbone punctuated with branched hexa-arabinofuranosides: p-D-Araf-(l→2)-α-D-Araf-(l-]2→3 and →5)-α-D-Araf-(l→5)-α-D-Araf→ and linear tetra-arabinofuranosides: p-D-Araf-( 1→2)-α-D-Ara/-( 1→5)-α-D-Araf-( 1→5)-α-D-Araf→. The mannose caps, which terminate the arabinan domain, consist of a single Manp residue, a dimannoside (α-D-Manp(l→2)-α-D-Manp→) or a trimannoside (α-D-Manp-(1→2)-α-D-Manp-(l→2)-α-D-Manp→). Mannose-capped LAM (manLAM) thus contains mono-, di-, or trimeric mannose residues at the non-reducing end of the arabinan domains of the LAM, whereas in contrast, araLAM lacks these terminal mannose caps.<br>
In this document and in its claims, the verb "to comprise" and its conjugations is used in its non-limiting sense to mean that items following the word are included, but items not specifically mentioned are not excluded. In addition, reference to an element by the indefinite article "a" or "an" does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the element is present, unless the context clearly requires that there be one and only one of the elements. The indefinite article "a" or "an" thus usually means "at least one".<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
In a first aspect the present invention relates to polypeptides that comprise an amino acid sequence of a lipoarabinomannan (LAM) cap-specific mannosyl transferase. The amino acid sequences are preferably mycobacterial amino acid sequences. Preferably the polypeptides of the invention comprise an amino acid sequence that has at least 35, 40, 42, 43, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 71, 72, 75, 80, 90, or 95% amino acid identity with at least one of SEQ ID NO. 1 - 6, which comprise the amino acid sequences of lipoarabinomannan cap-specific mannosyl transferase from various Mycobacteria.<br>
A preferred polypeptide according to the invention has mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity. The mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity is a novel mannosyl transferase having arabinose as acceptor of the transferred mannose residue. The mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity of the polypeptide may be assayed in a complementation assay by expression of a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide in a Mycobacterium that does not express manLAM but araLAM. Examples of suitable Mycobacteria that do not express manLAM include e.g. the M. marinum capless 2 mutant described herein or strains of M. smegmatis. A polypeptide that has mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity is a polypeptide that has the ability to restore (or induce) biosynthesis of the manLAM mannose cap upon expression of a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide in a Mycobacterium that does not express manLAM, whereby such nucleotide sequences are preferably as herein defined below. Successful complementation by the polypeptide (or encoding nucleotide sequence), i.e. restoration of the manLAM mannose cap, may be determined using mannose cap-specific monoclonal antibodies as may be obtained as described in Example 1 herein. Suitable examples of such monoclonal antibodies are<br>
e.g. the 56.49.1 A and 55.92.1A1 monoclonal antibodies as well as those described by Chatterjee et al. (1992, J Biol Chem. 267: 6234-9). Alternatively, restoration of the manLAM mannose cap may be determined by various methods that can detect the presence or absence of mannose caps on LAM such as e.g. mass-spectrometry and/or chromatography (Chatterjee et al., 1993 Glycobiology 3: 497-506; Prinzis et al., 1993, J Gen Microbiol. 139:2649-58; Khoo et al., 2001, J Biol Chem. 276:3863-71), NMR (Lee et al., 2005, Glycobiology 15:139-51), and capillary electrophoresis (16). Alternatively, the mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity of the polypeptide may be assayed by using synthetic acceptors that may be synthesised as described by Gadikota et al. (2). Such synthetic mannose-acceptor may e.g. be the non-reducing ends of the arabinan domain in 8-Aminooctyl (3-D-arabinofuranoside (referred to as "ara") or 8-Aminooctyl 5-0-{3,5-di-O-(2-O-[ß-D-arabinofuranosyl]-a-D-arabinofuranosyl)-α-D-arabinofuranosyl}-α-D-arabinofuranoside (referred to as (ara)6). The presence of a mannose-cap on these synthetic acceptors may be detected as described above.<br>
A preferred polypeptide of the invention comprising an immunogenic fragment from an amino acid sequence as defined above. The immunogenic fragment preferably comprises at least 4, 6, 9, 12, 15 or 20 contiguous amino acids from the amino acid sequence.<br>
A polypeptide according to the invention preferably is a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence from a Mycobacterium selected from M. bovis, M. tuberculosis, M. avium, M. paratuberculosis, M. leprae, M. ulcerans and M. marimum and/or other mycobacterial species that expresses mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity as defined above. It is understood that an amino acid sequence that is from a particular Mycobacterium is an amino acid sequence as it naturally occurs in the Mycobacterium. However, the invention does not exclude amino acid sequences that do not occur in nature, e.g. those that comprise substitutions, deletions and/or insertion of one or more amino acids compared to a naturally occurring amino acid sequence. Preferably the polypeptide of the invention is an isolated polypeptide, i.e. isolated from the environment in which it naturally occurs.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence selected from: (a) nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide as defined in above; (b) a nucleotide sequence that has at least 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60,<br>
65, 70, 75, 80, 90, or 95% nucleotide identity with SEQ ID NO. 7 or 8; (c) a nucleotide sequence the complementary strand of which hybridises to a nucleotide sequence of (a) or (b); and, (d) a nucleotide sequence the sequence of which differs from the sequence of a nucleotide sequence of (c) due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. A preferred nucleotide sequence encodes a polypeptide having mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity as defined above. Preferably the nucleotide sequence is from a Mycobacterium selected from M. bovis, M. tuberculosis, M. avium, M. paratuberculosis, M. leprae, M. ulcerans and M. marimum and/or other mycobacterial species that expresses mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity as defined above. It is understood that a nucleotide sequence that is from a particular Mycobacterium is a nucleotide sequence as it naturally occurs in the Mycobacterium. However, the invention does not exclude nucleotide sequences that do not occur in nature, e.g. those that comprise substitutions, deletions and/or insertion of one or more nucleotides compared to a naturally occurring nucleotide sequence.<br>
A preferred nucleic acid molecule of the invention comprises a fragment of at least 10 contiguous nucleotides from a nucleotide sequence as defined above. Such (oligo)nucleotides may be used as primers for amplification reactions and/or hybridisation probes. Such probes and primers may e.g. be useful in diagnostics methods and/or e.g. in a method for determining whether a nucleotide sequence as defined above (naturally) occurs in a Mycobacterium. Preferably the nucleic acid molecule of the invention is an isolated nucleic acid molecule, i.e. isolated from the environment in which it naturally occurs.<br>
The nucleic acid molecule of the invention may be a vector. A preferred vector is a mycobacterial vector such as e.g. a vector as used in the Examples herein (pSMTS; Golanska et al., 1998, Acta Microbiol Pol. 47: 335-43) or (shuttle) vectors as described in WO 91/13157, WO 90/10701, WO 90/00594, US 6,472,213, Jacobs et al. (1987, Nature, 327: 532-535), Snapper et al. (1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 85: 6987-6991) and Ranes et al. (J. Bacteriol. 1990, 172: 2793-2797). Preferably in the vector the nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide as defined above is operably linked to a promoter. Preferably the promoter is capable of driving transcription of the nucleotide sequence in a suitable host cell. In one embodiment, the invention relates to a host cell comprising a vector as just defined herein.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention relates to a mycobacterial cell that is deficient in manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity, whereas the cell is of a Mycobacterium species that naturally expresses manLAM. Preferably, the cell entirely lacks manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity, although cells that still contain residual transferase activity (e.g. 
In a preferred mycobacterial cell according to the invention, the deficiency in manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity is caused by the inactivation of a cellular gene encoding a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence having manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity as defined above. The cellular gene preferably is a gene as in naturally occurs in the cell. Usually the cellular gene will be a chromosomal gene although plasmid borne genes or other episomal genes are not excluded from the invention as they may occur. The gene may be inactivated by a variety of methods known to the skilled person (see below). Preferably the cellular gene is inactivated by deletion of at least a part of the sequence coding for the manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity and/or deletion of at least a part of the upstream regulatory sequences of a nucleotide sequence coding for the manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity as defined above.<br>
A preferred mycobacterial cell of the invention is a cell of a pathogenic Mycobacterium. Preferably the mycobacterial cell is a cell of a slow growing Mycobacterium, more preferably a slow growing virulent Mycobacterium. Slow growing mycobacteria comprising the virulent mycobacteria are generally found to express manLAM as opposed to fast growing atypical mycobacteria that express araLAM. Preferably the mycobacterial cell of the invention is of a mycobacterial species selected from the group consisting of M. bovis, M. tuberculosis, M. avium, M. paratuberculosis, M. leprae, M. ulcerans and M. marimum and/or other mycobacterial species that expresses mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity as defined above. The preferred mycobacterial species include any mycobacterial pathogens of man and animals. A further preferred mycobacterial cell of<br>
the invention is a cell of an attenuated Mycobacterium or attenuated mycobacterial strain, whereby an attenuated mycobacterial strains is understood to mean a strain having a reduced ability to invade and infect cells. One method for producing attenuated mycobacteria is e.g. described in US 6,548,070. This attenuation permits the novel strains provided herein to be used in immunogenic compositions for administration to a host to generate an immune response. A preferred example of an attenuated Mycobacterium for use in the present invention is the vaccine strain M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin.<br>
In yet another aspect the invention pertains to a method for producing a mycobacterial cell of the invention as defined above. Preferably the method comprising the steps of: (a) transforming a Mycobacterium with a nucleic acid construct that comprises: (i) a part of a nucleotide sequence that has at least 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 90, or 95% nucleotide identity with SEQ ID NO. 7 or 8 or, (ii) a nucleotide sequence that is present in the genome of the Mycobacterium within 2 kb of the nucleotide sequence that has at least 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 90, or 95% nucleotide identity with SEQ ID NO. 7 or 8 and, (b) selecting a transformant that is deficient in manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity. The nucleic acid construct is a construct for inactivation of the cellular gene encoding a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence having manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity as defined above. The nucleic acid construct may e.g. be a construct for inactivation of the transferase gene through an insertional mutation of the gene (see e.g. US 6,752,994). The insertional mutation of the transferase gene may be effected through illegitimate recombination of DNA into the mycobacterial chromosome, or by homologous recombination, or by the insertion of a mycobacterial transposon into a mycobacterial gene, or by the transfection of a mycobacterium with a vector which includes a pair of inverted repeat sequences and DNA encoding a transposase. More preferably, however, the nucleic acid construct is a construct that inactivates the transferase gene by allelic exchange as described e.g. in US 5,972,700, US 6,096,549 and US 6,271,034. Even more preferably the nucleic acid construct is a construct as described in US 6,423,545 that inactivates the transferase gene by unmarked allelic exchange, creating a deletion in the mycobacterial genome with leaving (a trace of) a selectable marker gene. Another method for generating an unmarked mycobacterial knock-out mutant is described by Parish and Stoker (2000, Microbiology. 146: 1969-<br>
75). Transformation of the nucleic acid constructs may be accomplished by any means known to those skilled in the art, such as e.g. electroporation, or by the generation of protoplasts into which the transforming DNA is inserted, followed by regeneration of the cell wall, as described in Jacobs (1987, supra) and Snapper (1988, supra). Selection of transformants that are deficient in manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity may be performed in the same manner as described in Example 2 herein.<br>
In a further aspect the invention relates to a method for producing a mycobacterial manLAM that lacks a mannose cap. The manLAM that lacks a mannose cap is in fact an araLAM. However, the method is particularly aimed at producing an araLAM (or manLAM that lacks a mannose cap) that except for the absence of the mannose cap(s) is identical to a manLAM. Preferably the araLAM produced in the method is identical to a manLAM of a slow growing and/or pathogenic Mycobacterium as defined above. The method comprising culturing a mycobacterial cell as defined in above or as obtained in a method as defined above, recovery and optionally purification of the mycobacterial manLAM that lacks a mannose cap. The invention thus also relates to a mycobacterial manLAM that lacks a mannose cap and that is obtainable in a method as just described herein. In one particular embodiment of the invention, the mycobacterial manLAM that lacks a mannose cap of the invention is used as an adjuvant or is used for the manufacture of a medicament in addition to an antigen for immunisation against the antigen.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one of: (a) a mycobacterial cell as defined herein above; (b) a mycobacterial cell as obtainable in a method as defined herein above; and, (c) a mycobacterial manLAM that lacks a mannose cap and that is obtainable in a method as defined herein above; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical carrier can be any compatible, non-toxic substance suitable to deliver the active ingredients, i.e. the mycobacterial cells or LAM of the invention, to a patient. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for intranasal delivery are exemplified by water, buffered saline solutions, glycerin, polysorbate 20, cremophor EL, and an aqueous mixture of caprylic/capric glyceride, and may be buffered to provide a neutral pH environment. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for parenteral delivery are exemplified by sterile buffered 0.9% NaCl or 5% glucose optionally supplemented with a 20% albumin. Preparations for parental administration must be sterile. The parental<br>
route for administration of the active ingredients is in accord with known methods, e.g. injection or infusion by subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intra-arterial or intralesional routes. The compositions of the invention are preferably administered by bolus injection. For oral administration, the active ingredient can be administered in liquid dosage forms, such as elixirs, syrups, and suspensions. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance. Methods for preparing parenterally, orally or intranasally administrable compositions are well known in the art and described in more detail in various sources, including, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Science (18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton, PA, 1990) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes).<br>
A preferred pharmaceutical composition further comprises an adjuvant. A number of adjuvants are well known to one skilled in the art. Suitable adjuvants include incomplete Freund's adjuvant, alum, aluminium phosphate, aluminium hydroxide, N-acetyl-muramyl-L-threonyl-D-isoglutamine (thr-MDP), N-acetyl-nor-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (CGP 11637, referred to as nor-MDP), N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanine-2-(r-2'-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-hydroxy-phosphoryloxy)-ethylamine (CGP 19835A, referred to as MTP-PE), DDA (2 dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide), polylC, Poly-A-poly-U, RIBI™, GERBU™, Pam3™, Carbopol™, Specol™, Titermax™, tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, meningococcal outer membrane proteins, diphtheria protein CRMw Preferred adjuvants comprises a ligand that is recognised by a Toll-like-receptor (TLR) present on antigen presenting cells. Various ligands recognised by TLR's are known in the art and include e.g. lipopeptides (see e.g. WO 04/110486), lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, liopteichoic acids, lipoarabinomannans of the invention, lipoproteins (from mycoplasma or spirochetes), double-stranded RNA (poly I:C), unmethylated DNA, flagellin, CpG-containing DNA, and imidazoquinolines. In addition, if desired, the pharmaceutical composition may contain auxiliary substances such as e.g. wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, which enhance the effectiveness of the compositions as immunogens, adjuvants and/or vaccines.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention relates to a method for immunising (vaccinating) a mammal against a Mycobacterium, the method comprising administration of a pharmaceutical composition as defined above in an amount effective to raise an<br>
immune response against the Mycobacterium. The Mycobacterium preferably is a pathogenic Mycobacterium as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in such amount as will be therapeutically effective and immunogenic. The quantity to be administered depends on the subject to be treated including, e.g., the capacity of the individual's immune system to induce an immune response. Suitable dosage ranges are of the order of 104 to 106 cfu (colony forming units) at mycobacterial concentration of about 106 cfu/mg. Most preferably, the effective dose is about 105 cfu. The dosage of the composition will depend on the route of administration and will vary according to the age of the patient to be immunised and, to a lesser degree, the size of the person to be immunised. Most preferably, the composition according to the invention is administered via an intradermal route and in a single boost. In the case of patients affected with immunological disorders such as, for example, immunosupressed/deficient patients, each injected dose preferably contains half the weight quantity of the mycobacteria contained in a dose for a healthy patient. In the case of neonates, the dose will be approximately four times less than for an adult, and in the case of young children (4-6 years old), the dose will be approximately half the dose used for an adult healthy patient. In some instances, it will be necessary to proceed with multiple administrations of the composition of the invention, usually not exceeding six administrations, more usually not exceeding four administrations, and preferably one or more, usually at least about three administrations. The administrations will normally be at from two to twelve week intervals, more usually from three to five week intervals. Periodic boosters at intervals of 1-5 years, usually three years, will be desirable to maintain the desired levels of protective immunity.<br>
In a further aspect the invention relates to a mycobacterial cell as defined above and/or mycobacterial manLAM that lacks a mannose cap as defined above, for use as a medicament, e.g. in a method of immunisation as described above. Alternatively, the mycobacterial cell as defined above and/or mycobacterial manLAM that lacks a mannose cap as defined above may be used for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of a mycobacterial infection.<br>
In yet a further aspect the invention relates to the use of a polypeptide according to the invention that has mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity, a nucleotide sequence according to the invention that encodes the<br>
mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase, and/or a host cell that expresses the polypeptide (or the nucleotide sequence) in a method for screening or identification of a compound that inhibits (or at least reduces the activity of) a mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase. The method usually comprises contacting the mannosyl transferase and/or a host cell expressing the same and determining the activity of the transferase or determining the binding of the compound to the transferase. A reduced activity as compared to a control sample that does not comprise the compound indicates that the compound inhibits (or at least reduces the activity of) a mycobacterial manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase. Preferably a plurality of different compounds is tested, preferably in a high through-put system.<br>
Description of the Figure<br>
Figure 1 Disrupted cells of M. marium Ell, capless 2, M. smegmatis and complementants of capless 2 and M. smegmatis were immunostained with anti-ara (panel A) and anti-cap monoclonal antibodies (panel B), respectively. Ms+ = complementant of M. smegmatis; Ms=M smegmatis; E11=M marinum parent strain; C2 = capless 2; C2+ = complementant of capless 2. Clear is that capless 2 has lost its cap and that complementation restores cap synthesis. Also is shown that complementation of M smegmatis induces expression of a capped manLAM.<br>
Figure 2 The binding of wild type M. bovis BCG and a M. bovis BCG capless 2 knock-out mutant (in which the homologue of Rcl653c has been disrupted) to CHO-cells expressing DC-SIGN. Dl is an inhibitory monoclonal directed against DC-SIGN, addition of which abolishes DC-SIGN specific binding. Addition of the calcium-gelator EGTA demonstrates the involvement of a C-type lectin.<br>
Figure 3 The binding of wild type M. bovis BCG and a M. bovis BCG capless 2 knock-out mutant (in which the homologue of Rcl653c has been disrupted) to isolated dendritic cells (DCs). Dl and EGTA are as described in Figure 2.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for the manLAM mannose cap<br>
To allow characterization of anti-LAM monoclonal antibodies, synthetic oligosaccharides (including (man)1-ara, (man)2-ara, and (man)3-ara) representing the non-reducing terminus of manLAM were prepared (2) and coupled to a protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) or polyacrylamide carrier (14). These neoglycoconjugates were used tot screen a large library (n&gt;200) of monoclonal antibodies directed to M. paratuberculosis (Mabs were made available by P.T.J. Willemsen, Research Institute of Animal Husbandry, Lelystad). Cap specific Mabs (56.49.1A and 55.92.1A1) were thus obtained. Additional Elisa tests showed that these Mabs react with manLAM but not with araLAM. These Mabs are thus specific for the mannose cap and have the ability to detect mannose caps in dot-blot immunoassays. In this type of assay mycobacteria (M. marinum-a close relative of M. tuberculosis, and M. smegmatis) are spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, baked, washed, incubated with Mab, washed, incubated with conjugate (goat-anti-mouse IgM-peroxydase) and immunostained. As expected only spots of M. marinum (expressing manLAM) were stained and not the spots of M. smegmatis (expressing araLAM). Further confirmation that these Mabs detect only the mannose cap was obtained by Western blotting, where it was found that the Moabs react with a heterogeneous band of the MW expected for manLAM. These Mabs were subsequently used to screen a transposon library of M marinum strain Ell. Example 2: Screening a M. marinum transposon library with anti-cap Moabs<br>
The mycobacteriophage mycomarT7 was obtained from Dr. E.J. Rubin. This phage is non-lytic for M. marinum and contains a mariner transposon with a kanamycin cassette. Phage and bacterial cells of M marinum strain Ell were incubated and plated on 7H9 plates with kanamycin (25|o,g/ml). Transposants were grown and transferred individually to a novel plate in a grid-like pattern and subsequently spotted onto nitrocellulose. After testing 1000 transposants a single negative colony was isolated. Example 3: Phenotypic characterization of the capless mutant ("capless 2")<br>
Bacterial cells of this mutant (designated capless 2) and the Ell parent were disrupted in the beadbeater with 0.1 mm beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted and immunostained with the anti-cap Mab, as well as a Mab specific for the arabinan domain of LAM (Mab F30-6, obtained from A. Kolk, KIT Amsterdam). The anti-ara<br>
Mab stained both the capless mutant and the El 1 parent whereas the anti-cap Mab only stained the Ell parent cells. In addition, gels were stained with Coomassie and these data indicated that parent and mutant have very similar overall banding patterns suggesting that no major rearrangement in the bacterial cell wall have taken place after inactivation of the gene responsible for cap synthesis. A growth curve showed that the mutant grows at approximately the same rate as the parent strain. An alternative way of investigating the presence of the mannose cap has been described in the literature and consists of chemical analysis of purified LAM (e.g. by capillary electrophoresis; 16). Example 4: Identifying the gene responsible for cap synthesis<br>
DNA was isolated from the capless 2 mutant and ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) was performed to identify the gene where the transposon insertion had taken place. First, genomic DNA was digested with Sail and subsequently, the digest was ligated with the adaptors (i.e. a partial hybrid of the following DNA primers Salgd: TAGCTTATTCCTCAAGGCACGAGC and Salpt: TCGAGCTGTGC); finally, PCR was performed with a primer inside the transposon (MycoMarT7 pr-1: CCCGAAAAGTGCCACCTAAATTGTAAGCG or MycoMarT? pr-2: CGCTTCCTCGTGCTTTACGGTATCG); the other primer was Salgd. Indeed a PCR product was formed. Subsequently, the PCR product was sequenced in an ABI sequencer. The obtained DNAsequence was Blasted (BLASTN) at NCBI. Hits were found for the mycomarT7 mariner transposon, ending in TA as expected for transposants with this mariner. Hence, the mariner sequence was removed from the ABI sequence and the "cleaned" data was Blasted against the contigs of M marinum at the Sanger website (no ORF numbers are available at the time of writing) (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/M_marinum/). The sequence was found to be identical to a part of the M. marinum sequence identified. A DNA sequence was put together consisting of the M. marinum sequence identified (SEQ ID NO. 7) plus 1000 bp upstream from the 5'end and downstream from the 3'end. This sequence was Blasted (tblastx ) against M. tuberculosis Rv37. The homologue of the putative mannosyltransferase was Rvl635c. Blasting of the gene showed (Table 1) that orthologues were present in the second sequenced strain of M tuberculosis CDC 1551 (MT1671); M. paratuberculosis/avium (ORFS MAP 1338c and 3805c), M. bovis (MB1661c) and M. leprae (ML 1389); no significant hits were found in the genome of<br><br>
M. smegmatis. As Table 1 shows, identities at the amino acid level were between 70% (with the M. tuberculosis homologs) and 42% (with MAP3805c).<br>
Likwise,	via	TBLASTX	at	http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-<br>
bin/blast/submitblast/m_bovis in M. bovis BCG (consisting of assembled contigs, no completed full genome sequence available yet and no ORF numbers assigned yet) an ORF was identified with high identity (&gt;70%) to the M .marinum sequence. On the DNA level, the sequence of the M. bovis BCG homologue was virtually identical (&gt;98%) to that of M bovis wildtype (SEQ ID NO. 8).<br>
Table 1. Amino acid sequence identities and similarities between the M. marinum cap-specific mannosyltransferase and orthologs.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 5: Cap-expressing complementants of capless 2 and M. smesmatis<br>
The capless 2 gene was amplified (using genomic DNA of M. marinum) with primers TTGGAATTTCAAGCAGCACA and ACATTGCAGTTGGTCTCG and Expand polymerase. The PCR product was cloned into Smal -digested pUC18, cut out with Pstl and EcoRV and cloned into shuttle vector pSMT3-eGFP (digested with Pstl and EcoRV), and electroporated into capless 2 and M. smegmatis mc2155. SDS-PAGE-immunoblots (Figure 1) indeed showed that complementation restored cap synthesis in capless 2 and moreover, also induced cap expression in M. smegmatis; these data demonstrate that the Rvl635c homologue of M. marinum is able to restore cap synthesis both in the M. marinum capless 2 mutant and M. smegmatis. We therefore conclude that this gene is both necessary and sufficient for cap synthesis in mycobacteria.<br>
Example 6: Construction of an unmarked capless M. bovis BCG<br>
Using the pNIL/pGOAL-procedure developed by Parish and Stoker (17), an unmarked knock-out mutant of the Rcl653c homologue in M bovis BCG was prepared. Bacterial cells of this BCGcapless mutant and the BCG parent were disrupted in the beadbeater with 0.1 mm beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted and immunostained with the anti-cap Mab, as well as a Mab specific for the arabinan domain of LAM as described in Example 3. The anti-ara Mab stained both the BCGcapless mutant and the BCG parent whereas the anti-cap Mab only stained the BCG parent cells (data not shown). In addition, gels were stained with Coomassie and these data indicated that parent and mutant have very similar overall banding patterns suggesting that no major rearrangement in the bacterial cell wall have taken place after inactivation of the gene responsible for cap synthesis (data not shown).<br>
A growth curve showed that the mutant grows at approximately the same rate as the parent strain from which we conclude that an intact Rcl653c homologue in M. bovis BCG is not essential for growth in vitro (data not shown).<br>
Example 7: The capless M. bovis BCG mutant does not bind to DC-SIGN<br>
Binding of mycobacteria to eukaryotic cells was evaluated as described in ref. 4. In short, bacteria were grown, washed and labelled with FICT. Cells that express DC-SIGN on their surface were: human dendritic cells, K562 and CHO-cells transfected with a DC-SIGN DNA construct; the isolation of these cells was desribed before (Ref. 4). Bacteria and eukaryotic cells were mixed (in varying proportions) and binding evaluated by FACS analysis and data expressed as MFI (mean fluorescence intensity). As control for the specificity of binding to DC-SIGN, an inhibitory monoclonal directed against DC-SIGN (Dl) was included, or the calcium-gelator EGTA was added to demonstrate the involvement of a C-type lectin. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, as compared to parent strain the capless BCG binds much less to either transfected cells and to human DC as compared to wild type BCG. Together these data prove that the interaction between the mannose cap of LAM and DC-SIGN determine the interaction between mycobacteria and human DC, a prerequisite for a changed immunological signalling.<br>

We claim<br>
1.	A mutant cell of a Mycobacterium species that naturally expresses manLAM, which mutant cell is deficient in manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity, wherein the deficiency is caused by a mutation inactivating a cellular gene encoding a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that has a minimum of 40% amino acid identity with at least one of SEQ ID NO. 1-6.<br>
2.	The mycobacterial cell as claimed in claim 1, wherein the mutation inactivating the cellular gene is a deletion of at least a part of the coding sequence and/or upstream regulatory sequences of the cellular gene.<br>
3.	The mycobacterial cell as claimed in any one of claims 1-2, wherein the cell is a cell of a slow growing virulent Mycobacterium.<br>
4.	The mycobacterial cell as claimed in claim 3, wherein the Mycobacterium is selected from a group consisting of M. bovis, M. tuberculosis, M. avium, M. paratuberculosis, M. leprae, M. ulcerans and M. marimum.<br>
5.	The mycobacterial cell as claimed in claims 3 or 4, wherein the Mycobacterium is attenuated.<br>
6.	The mycobacterial cell as claimed in claim 5, wherein the Mycobacterium is the vaccine strain M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin.<br>
7.	A method for producing a mycobacterial cell as defined in any one of the preceding claims, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
a) transforming a Mycobacterium with a nucleic acid construct that comprises<br>
i) part of cellular gene encoding a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that has a minimum of 40% amino acid identity with at least one of SEQ ID NO. 1 -6,<br>
ii)   a   nucleotide   sequence   that   is   present   in   the   genome   of  the Mycobacterium within 2 kb of the cellular gene encoding a polypeptide<br><br>
comprising an amino acid sequence that has a minimum of 40% amino acid identity with at least one of SEQ ID NO. 1 - 6; and, b)selecting a transformant that is deficient in manLAM cap-specific mannosyl transferase activity.<br>
8.	A method for producing a mycobacterial manLAM that lacks a mannose cap, the method comprising culturing a mycobacterial cell as claimed in any one of claims 1 - 6 or as obtained in a method as claimed in claim 7, followed by recovery and purification of the mycobacterial manLAM that lacks a mannose cap.<br>
9.	A pharmaceutical composition comprising 104 to 106 cfu/mg of a mycobacterial cell as defined in any one of claims 1 - 6 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
10.	The pharmaceutical composition as claimed in claim 9, optionally comprising an adjuvant.<br>
11.	The mycobacterial cell as claimed in any one of claims 1 - 6, for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of a mycobacterial infection.</td>
