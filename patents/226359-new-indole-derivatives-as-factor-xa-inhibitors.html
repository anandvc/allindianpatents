in which R*'; R""; R1; R1; R'*; R1; RS; R1; Q; V, Gand M have the meanings indicated below. The compounds of the formula I are valuable pharmacologically active compounds. They exhibit a strong antithrombotic effect and are suitable, for example, for the therapy and<br>
10 prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders like thromboembolic diseases or restenoses. They are reversible inhibitors of the blood dotting enzymes factor Xa (FXa) and/or factor Vila (FVIIa). and can in general be applied in conditions in which an undesired activity of faaor Xa and/or factor Vila is present or for the cure or prevention of which an inhibition of factor Xa and/or factor Vila is Intended. The invention furthermore relates to processes for the preparation of<br>
15 compounds of the formula I, their use, in particular as active ingredients in pharmaceuticals, and pharmaceutical preparations comprising them.<br>
Normal haemeostasis is the result of a complex balance between the processes of clot initiation, formation and clot dissolution. The complex interactions between blood ceils,<br>
20 specific plasma proteins and the vascular surface, maintain the fluidity of blood unless injury and blood loss occurs (EP-A-987274). Many significant disease states are related to abnormal haemeostasis. For example, local thrombus formation due to rupture of atheroslerotic plaque is a major cause of acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Treatment of an occlusive coronary thrombus by either thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous angioplasty may be<br>
25 accompanied by acute thrombolytic reclosure of the affected vessel.<br><br>
There continues to be a need for safe and effective therapeutic anticoagulants to limit or prevent thrombus formation. It is most desirable to develop agents that inhibit coagulation without directly inhibiting thrombin but by inhibiting other steps in the coagulation cascade lice factor Xa and/or factor Vila activity. It is now believed that inhibitors of factor Xa carry a 5 lower bleeding risk than thrombin inhibitors (A. E, P. Adding. B. M. Reline, Drugs of the future 2000, 25,369-383} <br>
Low molecular weight, factor Xa-specific blood clotting inhibitors that are effective but do not cause unwanted side effects have been described, for example, in WO-A-95/29189. However, besides being an effective factor Xa-specific blood clotting inhibitor, it is desirable 10 that such inhibitors also have further advantageous properties, for instance stability in plasma and liver and selectivity versus other serine proteases whose inhibition is not intended, such as thrombin. There is an ongoing need for further low molecular weight factor Xa specific blood clotting inhibitors, which are effective and have the above advantages as well.<br>
15 Specific inhibition of the factor Vila/tissue factor catalytic complex using monoclonal<br>
antibodies (WO-A-92/06711) or a protein such as chloromethyl ketone inactivated factor Vila (WO-A-96/12800, WO-A-97/47651) is an extremely effective means of controlling thrombus formation caused by acute arterial injury or the thrombotic complications related to bacterial septicemia. There is also experimental evidence suggesting that inhibition of factor Vila/tissue<br>
20 factor activity inhibits restenosis following balloon angioplasty. Bleeding studies have been conducted in baboons and indicate that inhibition of the factor Vlia/tissue factor complex has "' the widest safety window with respect to therapeutic effectiveness and bleeding risk of any anticoagulant approach tested including thrombin, platelet and factor Xa inhibition. Certain inhibitors of factor Vila have already been described. EP-A-987274, for example discloses<br>
25 compounds containing a tripeptide unit, which inhibit factor Vila. However, the property profile of these compounds is still not ideal, and there is an ongoing need for further low molecular weight factor Vila inhibitory blood clotting inhibitors. WO-A-99/33S0Q discloses indole derivatives, which inhibit factor Xa activity.<br>
30 The present invention satisfies the above needs by providing novel compounds of the formula I which exhibit better factor Xa and/or factor Vila inhibitory activity and are favorable agents with high bioavailability.

In general, the meaning of any group, residue, heteroatom, number etc., which can occur 30 more than once in the compounds of the formula 1, is independent of the meaning of this group, residue, heteroatom, number etc. in any other occurrence. All groups, residues, heteroatoms, numbers etc, which can occur more than once in the compounds of the formula I can be identical or different.<br><br>
As used herein, the term alkyl is to be understood in the broadest sense to mean hydrocarbon residues which can be linear, i. e. straight-chain, or branched and which can be acyclic or cyclic residues or comprise any combination of acyclic and cyclic subunits. Further, the term 5 alkyl as used herein expressly includes saturated groups as well as unsaturated groups which latter groups contain one or more, for example one, two or three, double bonds and/or triple bonds, provided that the double bonds are not located within a cyclic alkyl group in such a manner that an aromatic system results. All these statements also apply if an alkyl group occurs as a substituent on another residue, for example in an alkyloxy residue, an<br>
10 alkyloxycarbonyl residue or an arylalkyl residue. Examples of alkyl residues containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 or Scarbon atoms are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl or octyl, the n-isomers of ail these residues, isopropyl, isobutyl, 1-methylbutyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, 2,2-dimethyibutyi, 2-m ethyl pentyl, 3-methylpentyl, isohexyl, sec-butyl, tBu, tert-pentyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl or tert-pentyl.<br>
15<br>
Unsaturated alkyl residues are, for example, alkenyl residues such as vinyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl (= allyl), 2-butenyl, 3-butenyl, 2-methyl-2-butenyl, 3-methyl-2-butenyl, 5-hexenyl or 1,3-pentadienyl, or alkynyl residues such as ethynyl, l-propynyl, 2-propynyl (= propargyl) or 2-butynyl. Alkyl residues can also be unsaturated when they are substituted.<br>
20<br>
Examples of cyclic alkyl residues are cycloalkyi residues containing 3, 4, 5 or 6 ring carbon atoms like cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopenty! or cyclohexyl, which can also be substituted and/or unsaturated. Unsaturated cyclic alkyl groups and unsaturated cycloalkyi groups like, for example, cyclopentenyl or cyclohexenyl can be bonded via any carbon atom.<br>
25<br>
Of course, a cyclic alkyl group has to contain at least three carbon atoms, and an unsaturated alkyl group has to contain at least two carbon atoms. Thus, a group like (Ci-C8)-aiky! isto be understood as comprising, among others, saturated acyclic (d-Csl-alkyl, (Cj-CG)-cycloalkyl, and unsaturated (C2-G)-alkyl like (C2-C8)-alkenYl or (CrG)-alkynyl. Similarly, a<br>
30 group like (Ci-C4)-alkyl is to be understood as comprising, among others, saturated acyclic (d-C4)-alkyl, and unsaturated (C2-C4)-alkyl like {Cz-C4)-alkenYl or (Cz-Gj-alkynyl.<br><br>
Unless stated otherwise, the term alky! preferably comprises acyclic saturated hydro-carbon residues which have from one to six carbon atoms and which can be linear or branched. A particular group of saturated acyclic alkyl residues is formed by {Ci-C4)-alkyl residues like methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobuty!, sec-butyl and tBu. 5 Unless stated otherwise, and irrespective of any specific substrtuents bonded to alkyl groups which are indicated in the definition of the compounds of the formula 1, alkyl groups can in general be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more, for example one, two or three, identical or different substituents. Any kind of substituents present in substituted alkyl 10 residues can be present in any desired position provided that the substitution does not lead to an unstable molecule. Examples of substituted alkyl residues are alkyl residues in which one or more, for example 1, 2 or 3, hydrogen atoms are replaced with halogen atoms, in particular fluorine atoms.<br>
15 The term "mono- or bicyclic 4-to 14-membered heteroaryl" refers to (C4-Ci4}-aryl in which one or more of the 5 to 14 ring carbon atoms are replaced by heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur.

The fact that many of the before-listed names of heterocycles are the chemical names of<br>
5 unsaturated or aromatic ring systems does not imply that the , the 4-15 membered mono-or polycyclic group could only be derived from the respective unsaturated ring system. The names here only serve to describe the ring system with respect to ring size and the number of the heteroatoms and their relative positions. As explained above, the 4-15 membered mono-or polycyclic group can be saturated or partially unsaturated or aromatic, and can thus be<br>
10 derived not only from the before-listed heterocycles themselves but also from all their partially or completely hydrogenated analogues and also from their more highly unsaturated analogues if applicable. As examples of completely or partially hydrogenated analogues of the before-listed heterocycles from which this group may be derived the following may be mentioned: pyrroline, pyrrolidine, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydrothJophene, dihydropyridine,<br>
15 tetrahydropyridine, piperidine, 13-dioxolane, 2-imidazoline, imidazoiidine, 4,5-dihydro-l,3-oxazol, 1,3-oxazolidine, 4,5-dlhydro-l,3-thiazole, 1,3-thiazolidine, perhydro-1,4-dioxane, piperazine, perhydro-1,4-oxazine (= morpholine), perhydro-1,4-thiazine (= thiomorpholine), perhydroazepine, indoline, Isoindoline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, etc.<br>

The 4-15 membered mono- or polycyclic group may be bonded via any ring carbon atom, and in the case of nitrogen heterocycles via any suitable ring nitrogen atom. Thus, for example, a pyrrolyl residue can be l-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl or 3-pyrrolyI, a pyrrolidinyl residue can be pyrrolidin-1-yl (= pyrrolidino), pyrrolidin-2-yl or pyrrolidin-3-yl, a pyridinyl residue can be<br>

Unless stated otherwise, and irrespective of any specific substltuents bonded to the 4-15 membered mono- or polycyclic group or any other heterocyclic groups which are indicated In the definition of the compounds of the formula I, the 4-15 membered mono-or polycyclic<br>

Of course an oxo group<br>
20 cannot be present in an aromatic ring. Each suitable ring nitrogen atom in the 4-15<br>
membered mono- or polycyclic group can independently of each other be unsubstituted, i. e. carry a hydrogen atom, or can be substituted, i. e. carry a substituent like (Ci-Caj-alky!, for example (CrC4)-alkyl such as methyl or ethyl, optionally substituted phenyl, phenyl-(Ci-C4}-alkyl, for example benzyl, optionally substituted in the phenyl group, hydroxv-(C2-C4)-alkYl such<br>

Ring sulfur atoms can be oxidized to the sulfoxide or to the sulfone. Thus, for example a tetrahydrothienyi residue may be present as S,S-dioxotetrahydro-thienyl residue or a<br>
30 thiomorpholinyl residue like thiomorphoiin-4-yl may be present as 1-oxo-thiomorpholin-4-yl or l,1-dioxo-thiomorpholin-4-yl. A substituted 4-15 membered mono-or polycyclic group that can be present in a specific position of the compounds of formula i can independently of other<br><br>
groups be substituted by substituents selected from any desired subgroup of the substituents listed before and/or in the definition of that group.<br>
The 3-7 membered monocyclic group may be bonded via any ring carbon atom, and in the<br>
5 case of nitrogen heterocycles via any suitable ring nitrogen atom.

Unless stated otherwise, and irrespective of any<br>
15 specific substituents bonded to the 3-7 membered monocyclic group or any other heterocyclic groups which are indicated in the definition of the compounds of the formula 1, can be unsubstituted or substituted on ring carbon atoms with one or more, for example one, two, three, four or five, identical or different substituents like (CrCs)-alkyl, in particular (CrC4)-aikyI, (CrG)-alkyloxY, in particular (CrOj-alkyloxy, (Ci-Qj-alkylthio, halogen, nltro, amino, ({C1-C4)-<br>
20 alkyl)carbonyiamino like acetylamino, trifluoromethyl, trlfluoromethoxy, hydroxy, 0x0,<br>

25 optionally substituted in the phenyl group, etc. The substituents can be present in any desired position provided that a stable molecule results. Of course an 0x0 group cannot be present in an aromatic ring. Each suitable ring nitrogen atom in the 3-7 membered monocyclic group can independently of each other be unsubstituted, i. e. carry a hydrogen atom, or can be substituted, i. e. carry a substituent like (d-Csl-alkyl, for example (Ci-C4)-alkyl such as methyl or<br>

also be present as N-oxides or as quaternary salts. Ring sulfur atoms can be oxidized to the sulfoxide or to the sulfone.

A substituted 3-7 5 membered monocyclic group that can be present in a specific position of the compounds of formula I can independently of other groups be substituted by substituents selected from any desired subgroup of the substituents listed before and/or in the definition of that group.<br>
Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine, 10 particularly preferably chlorine or bromine.<br>
Optically active carbon atoms present in the compounds of the formula I can independently of each other have R configuration or S configuration. The compounds of the formula I can be present in the form of pure enantiomers or pure diastereomers or in the form of mixtures of<br>
15 enantiomers and/or diastereomers, for example in the form of racemates. The present invention relates to pure enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers as well as to pure diastereomers and mixtures of diastereomers. The invention comprises mixtures of two or of more than two stereoisomers of the formula I, and it comprises all ratios of the stereoisomers in the mixtures. In case the compounds of the formula I can be present as E isomers or Z<br>
20 isomers {or cis isomers or trans isomers) the invention relates both to pure Â£ isomers and pure Z isomers and to E/Z mixtures in all ratios. The invention also comprises all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula 1.<br>
Diastereomers, including E/Z isomers, can be separated into the individual isomers, for 25 example, by chromatography. Racemates can be separated into the two enantiomers by customary methods, for example by chromatography on chiral phases or by resolution, for example by crystallization of diastereomeric salts obtained with optically active acids or bases. Stereochemically uniform compounds of the formula I can also be obtained by employing stereochemically uniform starting materials or by using stereoselective reactions. 30<br>
Physiologically tolerable salts of the compounds of formula I are nontoxic salts that are physiologically acceptable, in particular pharmaceutically utilizable salts. Such salts of compounds of the formula I containing acidic groups, for example a carboxyl group COOH, are<br><br>
for example alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts such as sodium sails, potassium salts, magnesium salts and calcium salts, and also salts with physiologically tolerable quaternary ammonium ions such as tetramethylammonium or tetraethylammonium, and acid addition salts with ammonia and physiologically tolerable organic amines, such as 5 methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, ethylamine, triethylamine, ethanolamine or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine. Basic groups contained in the compounds of the formula I, for example amino groups or guanidino groups, form acid addition salts, for example with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid or phosphoric acid, or with organic carboxyiic adds and sulfonic acids such as formic acid, acetic<br>
10 acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, benzoic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid. Compounds of the formula 1 which simultaneously contain a basic group and an acidic group, for example a guanidino group and a carboxyl group, can also be present as zwitterions (betaines) which are likewise included in the present invention.<br>
15<br>
Salts of compounds of the formula 1 can be obtained by customary methods known to those skilled in the art, for example by combining a compound of the formula I with an inorganic or organic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant, or from other salts by cation exchange or anion exchange. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of the formula !<br>
20 which, becauseof low physiologically tolerabilrty, are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but are suitable, for example, as intermediates for carrying out further chemical modifications of the compounds of the formula 1 or as starting materials for the preparation of physiologically tolerable salts. The present invention furthermore includes all solvates of compounds of the formula I, for<br>
25 example hydrates or adducts with alcohols.<br>
The invention also includes derivatives and modifications of the compounds of the<br>
formula 1, for example prodrugs, protected forms and other physiologically tolerable 30 derivatives, as well as active metabolites of the compounds of the formula I. The invention relates in particular to prodrugs and protected forms of the compounds of the formula I which can be converted into compounds of the formula I under physiological conditions. Suitable prodrugs for the compounds of the formula I, i. e. chemically modified derivatives of the<br><br>
compounds of the formula I having properties which are improved in a desired manner, for example with respect to solubility, bioavailability or duration of action, are known to those skilled in the art. More detailed information relating to prodrugs is found in standard literature like, for example. Design of Prodrugs, H. Bundgaard (ed.), Elsevier, 1985,, Fleisheret 5 al.. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 19 (1996) 115-130; orH. Bundgaard, Drugs of the Future 16 [1991) 443 which are all incorporated herein by reference. Suitable prodrugs for the compounds of the formula I are especially acyl prodrugs and carbamate prodrugs of acylatable nitrogen-containing groups such as amino groups and the guanidino group and also ester prodrugs and amide prodrugs of carboxylic acid groups which may be present in compounds of 10 the formula I. In the acyl prodrugs and carbamate prodrugs one or more, for example one or two, hydrogen atoms on nitrogen atoms in such groups are replaced with an acyl group or a carbamate, preferably a (CT-C1-alkyloxycarbonyl group. Suitable acyl groups and carbamate<br>
groups for acyl prodrugs and carbamate prodrugs are, for example, the groups RP1-CO- and Rp1o-CO-, in which RP1 is hydrogen, (Ci-Cisj-alkyI, (Ca-Gj-cydoalkyl, (C3-Ca)-cycloalkyl-{CrC,}-15 alkyl-, (G-Ci4)-aryl, Het-, (C6-CK)-aryl-(CrCt)-alkyl- or Het-[CrC4)-aIkyl- and in which RP1 has the meanings indicated for RP1 with the exception of hydrogen.<br>
Especially preferred compounds of the formula I are those wherein two or more residues are defined as indicated before for preferred compounds of the formula I, or residues can have 20 one or some of the specific denotations of the residues given in their general definitions or in the definitions of preferred compounds before. Ail possible combinations of definitions given for preferred definitions and of specific denotations of residues explicitly are a subject of the present invention.<br>
25 Also with respect to all preferred compoundsof the formula 1 all their stereoisomeric forms and mixtures thereof in any ratio and their physiologically acceptable salts explicitly are a subject of the present invention, as well as are their prodrugs. Similarly, also in all preferred compounds of the formula I all residues that are present more than one time in the molecule are independent of each other and can be identical or different.<br>
30<br>
The compounds of the formula 1 can be prepared by utilizing procedures and techniques, which per se are well known and appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. Starting<br><br>
materials or building blocks for use in the general synthetic procedures that can be applied in the preparation of the compounds of formula I are readily available to one of ordinary skill in the art. In many cases they are commercially available or have been described in the literature. Otherwise they can be prepared from readily available precursor compounds 5 analogously to procedures described in the literature, or by procedures or analogously to procedures described in this application.<br>
In general, compounds of the formula I can be prepared, for example in the course of a convergent synthesis, by linking two or more fragments which can be derived retrosynthetically<br>
10 from the formula I. More specifically, suitably substituted starting indole derivatives are employed as building blocks in the preparation of the compounds of formula I. if not commercially available, such indole derivatives can be prepared according to the well-known standard procedures for the formation of the indole ring system such as, for example, the Fischer indole synthesis, the Madelung indole synthesis, the indole synthesis starting from N-<br>
15 chloroanilines and B-ketosuIfides described by Gassman et al., the Bischier indole synthesis, the Reissert indole synthesis, or the Nenitzescu indole synthesis. By choosing suitable precursor molecules, these indole syntheses allow the introduction of a variety of substituents into the various positions of the indole system which can then be chemically modified in order to finally arrive at the molecule of the formula I having the desired substituent pattern. As one of<br>
20 the comprehensive reviews in which numerous details and literature references on the chemistry of indoles and on synthetic procedures for their preparation can be found, W. J. Houlihan (ed.),"Indoles, Part One", volume 25,1972, out of the series "The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds", A. Weissberger and E. C Taylor (ed.), John Wiley &amp; Sons, is referred to.<br>

If starting indole derivatives are to be synthesized this can be done, for example, according to the well known indole syntheses mentioned above. In the following they are explained briefly, however, they are standard procedures comprehensively discussed in the literature, and are well known to one skilled in the art.<br>

R11<br>
which can be obtained by various methods and in which R1', R1"" and R11and n can have a wide 20 variety of denotations. Besides hydrogen and alkyl, R11 and R11can especially denote ester groups or methyl or ethyl groups or 2,2,2- trifluoroethyl groups carrying an ester group as substituent thus allowing the introduction into the indole molecule of the (CHajp-CO moiety occurring in the groups R- and/or R1 in the compounds of the formula I. As examples of the many literature references describing the synthesis of indole derivatives according to the 25 Fischer synthesis, besides the above-mentioned book edited by Houlihan, the following articles are mentioned: F.G.

The Reissert indole synthesis leads to derivatives of indoIe-2-carboxylic acids. The pyruvic acid derivatives of the formula 3 can be obtained by condensation of oxalic acid esters with substituted o-nitrotoluenes. As literature references, besides the above-mentioned book edited by Houlihan and the literature articles mentioned<br>

Another method to gain regioselective access to the indole structure involves palladium catalysis, for example o-haloanilines(X= CI, Br, I) or o-trlfluoromethanesufonyloxyanilines (X =<br>

A further route to specifically substituted indole derivatives proceeds via 2,3-dihydroindoles (indolines) v/hich can be easily obtained by reduction of indoles, for example by hydrogenation, or by cyclization of suitable phenylethylamine derivatives. Indolines can<br>
15 undergo a variety of electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction allovifjng the introduction of various substituents into the benzene nucleus which cannot directly be introduced by such reactions into the benzene nucleus of the indole molecule. The indolines can then be dehydrogenated to the corresponding indoles, for example with reagents like chloranil, or palladium together with a hydrogen acceptor.

Moreover 2-H-indoies can be converted into the corresponding carboxylic acids or carboxylic esters by lithiation of the 2-posltion of the indoles of the general formula 13 and subsequent reaction with carton dioxide or alkytchioroformate according to I. Hasan, E. Mannelli, L Lin, F. 5 Fowler, A. Levy, ]. Org. Chem. 46 (1981) 157; T. Kline J. Heterocycl. Chem. 22 (1985} 505; J.-R. Dormoy, A. Heymes, Tetrahedron 49, (1993) 2885; E. Desarbre, S. Coudret, C. Meheust, J.-Y. Merour, Tetrahedron 53 (1997) 3637 as indicated below:<br>
R'1s denotes for Hydrogen or a protecting group like for example benzenesulfonyl or tert-10 butoxycarbonyl.<br>
Depending on the substituents In the starting materials, in certain indole syntheses mixtures of positional Isomers may be obtained which, however, can be separated by modern separation techniques like, for example, preparative HPLC<br>
15 Further, in order to obtain the desired substituents in the benzene nucleus and in the heterocyclic nucleus of the indole ring system in the formula I, the functional groups introduced into the ring system during the indole synthesis can be chemically modified. For example, indoles carrying a hydrogen atom in the 2-po5ition or the 3-position can also be obtained by saponifiiiation and subsequent decarboxylation of indoles carrying an ester group<br>
20 in the respective position. Carboxylic acid groups and acetic acid groups in the 2-position and the 3-position can be converted into their homologues by usual reactions for chain elongation of carboxylic acids. Halogen atoms can be introduced into the 2-position or the 3-position, for example by reacting the respeaive indolinone with a halogenating agent such as phosphorus pentachlorideanalogously to the method described by J. C. Powers,]. Org. Chem. 31 (1966)<br>
25 2627. The starting Indolinones for such a synthesis can be obtained from 2-amtnophenyl acetic acids. Starting indole derivatives for the preparation of compounds of the formula I carrying a halogen substituent In the 3-position can also be obtained according to procedures described in the literature like the following. For the fluorination of 1 H-indole-2-carboxylic add ethyl<br><br>
ester derivatives in the 3-position N-fluoro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium triflate is the reagent of choice [T. Umemoto, S. Fukami, G. Tomizawa, K. Harasawa, K. Kawada, K. Tomita J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112(1990) 8563). Gilorination of IH-indole-Z-carboxylicacid ethyl ester derivatives in the 3-position by reaction with sulfuryf chloride in benzene yields 3-ch(oro-1 H-lndole-Z-carfaoxyfic 5 acid ethyl ester (Oiem. Abstr. 1%2, 3441i - 3442b); the same result can obtained by means of NCS (D. Comins, M. Killpack, Tetrahedron Lett. 33 (1989) 4337; M. Brennan, K. Erickson, F. Szmlac, M. Tansey, J. Thornton, Heterocycles 24 (1986) 2879). Bromination of 1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester derivatives in the 3-position can be achieved by reaction with NBS (M. Tani, H. Ikegami, M. Tashiro, T. Hiura, H. Tsukioka, Heterocycles 34 (1992) 2349).<br>
10 Analogously to the procedures described above NIS can be used efficiently for the iodination in the of 1 H-indole-2-carboxYlic acid ethyl ester derivatives in the 3-position. Furthermore the iodination of 1 H-indole-2-carboxyiic acid ethyl ester derivatives in the 3-pQSition the use of iodine is efficient fT. Sakamoto, T. Nagano, Y. Kondo, H. Yamanaka Chem. Pharm. Bull. 36 (1988)2248).<br>
15 Especially the groups present in the indole ring system can be modified by a variety of reactions and thus the desired residues R""1, R11 R1S R11 and Ri=be obtained. For example, nitro groups can be reduced to amino group with various reducing agents, such as sulfides, dithionites, complex hydrides or by catalytic hydrogenation. A reduction of a nitro group may also be carried out at a laterstageof the synthesis of a compound of the formula I, and a<br>
20 reduction of a nitro group to an amino group may also occur simultaneously with a reaction performed on another functional group, for example when reacting a group like a cyano group 1-with hydrogen sulfide or when hydrogenating a group. In order to introduce or derive the residues R11"*, amino groups can then be modified according to standard procedures for alkylation, for example by reaction with (substituted) alkyl halogenides or by reductive<br>
25 amination of carbonyl compounds, according to standard procedures for acylation, for example by reaction with activated carboxylic acid derivatives such as acid chlorides, anhydrides, activated esters or others or by reaction with carboxyfic acids in the presence of an activating agent, or according to standard procedures forsulfonylation, for example by reaction with sulfonyl chlorides. Carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid chlorides or carboxylic acid<br>
30 esters can be introduced by procedures described by F. Santangelo, C Casagrande, G. Norcini, F. Gerli, Synth. Commun. 23 (1993)2717; P. Beswick, C. Greenwood, T. Mowlem, G. Nechvatal, D. Widdowson, Tetrahedron 44 (1988) 7325; V. Collot, M. Schmitt, P. Marwah, J. Bourguignon, Heterocylces 51 (1999) 2823. Halogens or hydroxy groups-via the triflate or nonaflate-or<br><br>
primary amines - via its diazonium salt - or after interconversion to the corresponding stannane, or boronic acid - present in the indole structure can be converted into a variety of other functional groups like for example -CN, -CFs, Ethers, adds, esters, amides, amines, alkyl-or aryl groups mediated by means of transition metals, namely palladium or nickel catalysts or 5 copper salts and reagents for example referred to below (F. Diederich, P. Stang, Metal-catalyzed Cross-coupling Reactions, Wiley-VCH, 1998; or M. Beller, C Bolm, Transition Metals for Organic Synthesis, Wiley-VCH, 1998; J.

Ester groups present in the benzene nucleus can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acids, which after activation can then be reacted with amines or alcohols under standard conditions. Ether groups present at the benzene nucleus, for example benzyloxy groups or 20 other easily cleavable ether groups, can be cleaved to give hydroxy groups which then can be reaaed with a variety of agents, for example etherification agents or activating agents allowing replacement of the hydroxy group by other groups. Sulfur-containing groups can be reacted analogously.<br>
25 During the course of the synthesis in order to modify the groups R1 or R1'attached to the indole ring system by application of parallel synthesis methodology, beside a variety of reactions, palladium or copper salt catalysis can be extremely useful: Such reaaions are described for example in F. Diederich, P. Stang, Metal-catalyzed Cross-coupling Reactions, Wiley-VCH, 1998; or M. Beller, C. Bolm, Transition Metals for Organic Synthesis, Wiley-VCH,<br>

Buchwald, 4 (2002) 973). 5 The previously-mentioned reactions for the conversion of functional groups are furthermore, in general, extensively described in textbooks of organic chemistry like M. Smith, j, March, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2001 and in treatises like Houben-Weyl, "Methoden der Organischen Chemie" (Methods of Organic Chemistry), Georg Thieme Verlag,<br>
10 Stuttgart, Germany, or "Organic Reactions", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, or R. C Larock," Comprehensive Organic Transformations", Wiley-VCH, 2"'1 ed (1999), B. Trost, I. Fleming (eds.) Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, Pergamon,1991; A. Katritzky, C Rees, E. Scriven Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry 11, Elsevier Science, 1996) in which details on the reactions and primary source literature can be found. Due to the fact that in the present case<br>
15 the functional groups are attached to an indole ring It may in certain cases become necessary to specifically adapt reaction conditions or to choose specific reagents from a variety of reagents that can in principle be employed into a conversion reaaion, or otherwise to take specific measures for achieving a desired conversion, for example to use protection group techniques. However, finding out suitable reaction variants and reaction conditions in such<br>
20 cases does not cause any problems for one skilled in the art.<br>
The structural elements present in the residues in the 1-position of the indole ring in the compounds of the formula 1 and in the COR1 group present in the 2-position and/or in the 3-positionof the indole ring can be introduced into the starting indole derivative obtainable as outlined above by consecutive reaction steps using parallel synthesis methodologies like those<br>
25 outlines below using procedures which per se are well known to one skilled in the art.<br>
The residues R1" that can be introduced in formula 14, for example, by condensing a<br>
corresponding carboxylic acid of the formula 14 with a compound of the formula HR ,<br>
i. e. with an annine of the formula HN(R1')R1'-V-G-M to give a compound of the formula 15. The 30 compound of the formula 15 thus obtained can already contain the desired final groups, i. e.<br>
the groups R1 and R1 can be the groups--N(R1)R1~V-G-M and R1-Q-as defined in the formula (, or optionally in the compound of the formula 15 thus obtained subsequently the residue or<br><br>
the residues R1 and the residue R1 are converted into the residues-N(R1)R1-V-G-M and RÂ°-Q-, respectively, to give the desired compound of the formula I.<br><br><br>
R49<br>
HRS'<br><br>
14<br><br><br>
formula I<br><br>
15 Thus, the residues R1' and the residues R""' and R1'-V-G-M contained therein can have the<br>
5 denotations of R"" and R1-V-G-M, respectively, given above or in addition in the residues R1' and<br>
R2'-V-G-M functional groups can also be present in the form of groups that can subsequently<br>
be transformed into the final groups R' and R1V-G-M, i. .e. functional groups can be present in<br>
the form of precursor groups or of derivatives, for example in protected form. In the course of<br>
the preparation of the compounds of the formula I it can generally be advantageous or<br>
10 necessary to introduce functional groups which reduce or prevent undesired reactions or side reactions in the respective synthesis step, in the form of precursor groups which are later converted into the desired functional groups, or to temporarily block functional groups by a protective group strategy suited to the synthesis problem. Such strategies are well known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic<br>
15 Synthesis, Wiley, 1991, or P. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, Thieme 1994). As examples of precursor groups nitro groups and cyano groups may be mentioned which can in a later step be transformed into carboxylic acid derivatives or by reduction into aminomethy! groups, or nitro groups which may be transformed by reduction like catalytic hydrogenation into amino groups by redurtion. Protective groups can also have the meaning of a solid phase, and<br><br>
cleavage from the solid phase stands for the removal of the protective group. The use of such techniques is known to those skilled in the art [Burgess K (Ed.) Solid Phase Organic Synthesis ,New York: Wiley, 2000). For example, a phenolic hydroxy group can be attached to a trityl-poiystyrene resin, which serves as a protecting group, and the molecule is cleaved from this 5 resin by treatment with TFA at a later stage of the synthesis.<br>
The residue Râ„¢ in the compounds of the formulae 14 and 15 can denote the group -Q-R"as defined above which finally is to be present in the desired target molecule of the formula I, or it can denote a group which can subsequently be transformed into the group -Q-RÂ°, for<br>
10 example a precursor group or a derivative of the group -Q-R" in which functional groups are present in protected form, or R1o can denote a hydrogen atom or a protective group for the nitrogen atom of the Indole ring. Similarly, the residues Rl1 R11, Rl1 R1'1 and R1"* in the formulae 14 and 15 have the corresponding definitions of R1, R1, R1, R', and R1 in formula I as defined above, however, for the synthesis of the compounds of the formula I these residues,<br>
15 too, can in principle be present at the stage of the condensation of a compound of the formula 14 with a compound of the formula HR1'giving a compound of the formula 15 in the form of precursor groups or in protected form.<br>
The residues R**1 in the compounds of the formula 14 which can be identical or different, can 20 be, for example, hydroxy or [G-C4)-alkoxy, i. e., the groups COR11 present in the compounds of the formula 14 can be, for example, the free carboxylic acids or esters thereof like alky! esters as can be the groups COR1 in the compounds of the formula I. The groups COR'1 can also be any other activated derivative of a carboxylic acid which allows amide formation, ester formation or thioester formation with a compound of the formula HR1'. The group COR'1 can 25 be, for example, an acid chloride, an activated ester like a substituted phenyl ester, an azolide like an imidazolide, an azide or a mixed anhydride, for example a mixed anhydride with a carbonic acid ester or with a sulfonic acid, which derivatives can all be prepared from the carboxylic acid by standard procedures and can be reacted with an amine, an alcohol or a mercaptan of the formula HRS' under standard conditions. A carboxylic acid group COOH 30 representing COR'*1 in a compound of the formula 14 can be obtained, for example, from an ester group introduced into the indole system during an indole synthesis by standard hydrolysis procedures.<br><br>
Compounds of the formula I in which a group COR1 is an ester group can also be prepared from compounds of the formula 14 in which COR't1 is a carboxylic acid group by common esterification reactions like, for example, reacting the acid with an alcohol under add catalysis, or alkyiation of a salt of the carboxyiic acid with an electrophile like an alkyl halogenide, or by 5 transesterifi cation from another ester. Compounds of the formula I in which a group COR1 is an amide group can be prepared from amines and compounds of the formula 14 in which COR'1 is a carboxylic acid group or an ester thereof by common amination reactions. Especially for the preparation of amides the compounds of the formula 14 in which COR11 is a carboxylic acid group can be condensed under standard conditions with compounds of the formula HR1'<br>
10 which are amines by means of common coupling reagents used in peptide synthesis. Such coupling reagents are, for example, carbodiimides like dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or diisopropylcarbodiimide, carbonyldiazoles like carbonyldiimldazole (CDI) and similar reagents, propylphosphonic anhydride, 0-((cyano-(ethoxycarbonyl)-methylene)amino)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU), diethylphosphoryl cyanide (DEPC) or bis-(2-oxo-<br>
15 3-oxa2olidinyl)-phosphoryl chloride (BOP-Cl) and many others.<br>
If the residue -Q-RÂ° present in an indole of the formula I or the residue R1 present in an indole of the formula 14, or a residue in which functional groups within the residue-Q-R** or R1are present in protected form or in the form of a precursor group, have not already been<br>
20 introduced during a preceding step, for example during a synthesis of the indole nucleus, these residues can, tor example, be introduced into the 1-position of the indole system by conventional literature procedures well known to one skilled in the art for N-alkyiation, reductive amination, N-aryiation, N-acylation or N-sulfony!ation of ring nitrogen atoms of heterocycles. The starting indole derivative that is to be employed in such a reaction carries a<br>
25 hydrogen atom in the 1-position. N-Alkyiation of a ring nitrogen atom can, for example, be performed under standard conditions, preferably in the presence of a base, using an alkylating compound of the formula LG-Q-R1of of the formula R11-LG, wherein the atom in the group Q or in the group R1 bonded to the group LG in this case is an aliphatic carbon atom of an alkyl moiety and LG is a leaving group, for example halogen like chlorine, bromine or iodine, or a<br>
30 sulfonyloxy group like tosyloxy, mesyloxy or trifluormethylsulfonyloxy. LG may, for example, also be a hydroxy group which, in order to achieve the alkyiation reaction, is activated by a conventional activating agent. For the preparation of compounds in which A is a direct linkage and an aromatic group is directly bonded to the 1-position of the indole system, conventional<br><br>
aryjation procedures can be used. For example aryl fluorides like alky! fluorobonzoates or 4-fluorophenyl methyl sulfones can be employed as arytating agents. Such processes are described, for example, By S. Stabler, Jahangir, Synth. Commun. 24 (1994) 123; 1. Khanna, R. Weier, Y. Yu, X. Xu. F. Koszyk, J. Med. Chem. 40 (1997) 1634. Alternatively a wide variety of substituted aryl iodides, aryl bromides or aryl triflates can serve as arylating agents at the 1-posttion of the indole system in a copper salt or palladium mediated reaction according to R. Sarges, H. Howard, tC Koe, A. Weissmann, J. Med. Chem, 32 (1989) 437; P. Unangst, D. Connor, R. Stabler, R- Weikert, J. Heterocyd. Chem, 24 (1987) 811; G. Tokmakov, I.

Moreover such arylations can also be accomplished by reaction of a wide range of substituted aryl faoronic acids as demonstrated for example by W. Mederski, M. Lefort, M. Germann, D. Kux, Tetrahedron 55 (1999) 12757.<br>
I In the course of the synthesis the employment of microwave assistance for speeding-up, facilitating or enabling reactions may be beneficial or even required in many cases. Some reactions are for example described by J. L. Krstenansky, I. Cotteril, Curr. Opin. Drug. Disc. &amp; Development., 4(2000), 454; P. Lidstrom, J. Tierney, B. Wathey, j. Westman, Tetrahedron,<br>

Preferred methods include, but are not limited to those described in the examples.<br>
5 The compounds of the present invention are serine protease inhibitors, which Inhibit the artivity of the blood coagulation enzyme factors Xa and/or factor Vila. In particular, they are highly active inhibitors of factor Xa. They are specific serine protease inhibitors inasmuch as they do not substantially inhibit the activity of other proteases whose inhibition is not desired. The activity of the compounds of the formula I can be determined, for example, in the assays<br>
0 described below or in other assays known to those skilled in the art. With respen to factor Xa inhibition, a preferred embodiment of the invention comprises compounds which have a Ki Q 1 for factor Xa inhibition as determined in the assay described below, with or without concomitant factor Vila inhibition, and which preferably do not substantially inhibit the<br><br>
activity of other proteases involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis whose inhibition is not desired (using the same concentration of the inhibitor). The compounds of the invention inhibit factor Xa catalytic activity either directly, within the prothrombinasecomplexorasa soluble subunit, or indirectly,.by inhibiting the assembly of factor Xa into the prothrombinase 5 complex.<br>

10 tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs for the production of pharmaceuticals for inhibition of factor Xa and/or factor Vila or for influencing blood coagulation, inflammatory response or fibrinolysis or for the therapy or prophylaxis of the diseases mentioned above or below, for example for the production of pharmaceuticals for the therapy and prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or restenoses. The invention also relates to<br>
15 the use of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs for the inhibition of factor Xa and/or factor Vila or for influencing blood coagulation or fibrinolysis or for the therapy or prophylaxis of the diseases mentioned above or below, for example for use in the therapy and prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or restenoses, and to methods of treatment aiming at such purposes<br>
20 including methods for said therapies and prophylaxis. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical preparations (or pharmaceutical compositions) which contain an effective amount of at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs in addition to a customary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i. e. one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substances or excipients and/or auxiliary substances<br>
25 or additives.<br>
The invention also relates to the treatment of disease states such as abnormal thrombus formation, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, thromboembolism, acute vessel closure associated with thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous transluminal coronary 30 angioplasty, transient ischemic attacks, stroke, pathologic thrombus formation occurring in the veins of the lower extremities following abdominal, knee and hip surgery, a risk of pulmonary thromboembolism, or disseminated systemic intravascular coagulatopathy occurring in vascular systems during septic shock, certain viral infections creancer.<br><br>
The compounds of the formula 1 and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs can be administered to animals, preferably to mammals, and in particular to humans as pharmaceuticals for therapy or prophylaxis. They can be administered on their own, or in 5 mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations which permit entera or parenteral administration.<br>
The pharmaceuticals can be administered orally, for example in the form of pills, tablets, lacquered tablets, coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, syrups,<br>
10 emulsions, suspensions or aerosol mixtures. Administration, however, can also be carried out rectally, for example in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, for example intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, microcapsules, implants or rods, or percutaneously or topically, for example in the form of ointments, solutions or tinctures, or in other ways, for example In the form of aerosols or nasal<br>
15 sprays.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention are prepared in a manner known perse and familiar to one skilled in the art, pharmaceutically acceptable inert inorganic and/or organic carriers being used in addition to the compound(s) of the formula I and/or its (their) physiologically tolerable salts and/or its (their) prodrugs. Forthe production of pills,<br>
20 tablets, coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules it is possible to use, for example, lactose, cornstarch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Carriers for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are, for example, fats, waxes, semisolid and liquid polyols, natural or hardened oils, etc. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions, for example injection solutions, or of emulsions or syrups are, for example, water, saline, alcohols, glycerol, polyols,<br>
25 sucrose, invert sugar, glucose, vegetable oils, etc. Suitable carriers for microcapsules, implants or rods are, for example, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain about 0.5 % to 90 % by weight of the compounds of the formula \ andiof their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs. The amount di the active ingredient of the formula 1 and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs in the<br>
30 pharmaceutical preparations normally is from about 0.5 mg to about 1000 mg, preferably from about 1 mg to about 500 mg.<br><br>
in addition to the active ingredients of the formula I and/or their physiologically acceptable salts and/or prodrugs and to carrier substances, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain additives such as, for example, fillers, disintegrants, binders, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, 5 thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents, solubiiizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain two or more compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs. In case a pharmaceutical preparation contains two or more compounds of the formula t the selection of the individual compounds can aim at a specific overall<br>
10 pharmacological profile of the pharmaceutical preparation. For example, a highly potent compound with a shorter duration of action may be combined with a long-acting compound of lower potency. The flexibility permitted with respect to the choice of substituents in the compounds of the formula I allows a great deal of control over the biological and physico-chemical properties of the compounds and thus allows the selection of such desired<br>
15 compounds. Furthermore, in addition to at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain one or more other therapeutically or prophylactically active ingredients.<br>
As inhibitors of factor Xa and/or factor Vita the compounds of the formula I and their 20 physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs are generally suitable for the therapy and prophylaxis of conditions in which the activity of factor Xa and/or factor Vila plays a role or has an undesired extent, or which can favorably be influenced by inhibiting factor Xa and/or factor Vila or decreasing their activities, or for the prevention, alleviation or cure of which an inhibition of factor Xa and/or factor Vila or a decrease in their activity is desired by the 25 physician. As inhibition of factor Xa and/or factor VI la influences blood coagulation and ,   fibrinolysis, the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs are generally suitable for reducing blood clotting, or for the therapy and prophylaxis of conditions in which the activity of the blood coagulation system plays a role or has an undesired extent, or which can favorably be influenced by reducing blood clotting, or for the 30 prevention, alleviation or cure of which a decreased activity of the blood coagulation system is desired by the physician. A specific subject of the present invention thus are the reduction or inhibition of unwanted blood clotting, in particular in an individual, by administering an<br><br>
effective amount of a compound I or a physiologically tolerable salt or a prodrug thereof, as well as pharmaceutical preparations therefor.<br>
Conditions in which a compound of the formula I can be favorably used include, for example, 5 cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or complications associated, for example, with infection or surgery. The compounds of the present invention can also be used to reduce an inflammatory response. Examples of specific disorders for the treatment or prophylaxis of which the compounds of the formula I can be used are coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, vascular restenosis, for example restenosis following angioplasty<br>
10 like PICA, adult respiratory distress syndrome, multinargan failure, stroke and disseminated intravascular clotting disorder. Examples of related complications associated with surgery are thromboses like deep vein and proximal vein thrombosis, which can occur following surgery. In view of their pharmacological activity the compounds of the invention can replace or supplement other anticoagulant agents such as heparin. The use of a compound of the<br>
15 invention can result, for example, in a cost saving as compared to other anticoagulants. When using the compounds of the formula I the dose can vary within wide limits and, as is customary and is known to the physician, is to be suited to the individual conditions in each individual case. It depends, for example, on the specific compound employed, on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, on the mode and the schedule of administration, or<br>
20 on whether an acute or chronic condition is treated or whether prophylaxis is carried out. An appropriate dosage can be established using clinical approaches well known in the medical art. in general, the daily dose for achieving the desired results in an adult weighing about 75 kg is from 0.01 mg/kgtolOO mg/kg. preferably from 0.1 mg/kgto 50 mg/kg, in particular from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, (in each case in mg per kg of body weight). The daily dose can be<br>
25 divided, in particular in the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, into several, for example 2, 3 or 4, part administrations. As usual, depending on individual behavior it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the daily dose indicated.<br>
A compound of the formula I can also advantageously be used as an anticoagulant outside an 30 individual. For example, an effective amount of a compound of the invention can be contacted with a freshly drawn blood sample to prevent coagulation of the blood sample. Further, a compound of the formula t and its salts can be used for diagnostic purposes, for example in in vitro diagnoses, and as an auxiliary in biochemical investigations. For example, a compound of<br><br>
the formula I can be used in an assay to identify the presence of factor Xa and/or factor Vila or to isolate factor Xa and/or factor Vila in a substantially purified form. A compound of the invention can be labeled with, for example, a radioisotope, and the labeled compound bound to factor Xa and/or factor Vila is then detected using a routine method useful for detecting the 5 particular label. Thus, a compound of the formula I or a salt thereof can be used as a probe to detect the location or amount of factor Xa and/or factor Vila activity in vivo, in vitro or ex vivo.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the formula I can be used as synthesis intermediates for the preparation of other compounds, in particular of other pharmaceutical active ingredients, 10 which are obtainable from the compounds of the formula I, for example by introduction of substituents or modification of functional groups.<br>

Pharmacological testing<br>
T^ie ability of the compounds of the formula 1 to inhibit factor Xa or factor Vila or other enzymes like thrombin, plasmin, or trypsin can be assessed by determining the concenb^tion of the compound of the formula I that inhibits enzyme activity by 50 %, i. e. the ICso value, 5 which was related to the inhibition constant Ki. Purified enzymes were used in chromogenic assays- The concentration of inhibitor that causes a 50 % decrease in the rate of substrate hydrolysis was determined by linear regrsston after plotting the relative rates of hydrolysis (compared to the uninhibited control) versus the log of the concentration of the compound of, formula I. For calculating the inhibition constant Ki, the iCso value was corrected for<br>
10 competition with substrate using the formula<br>
Ki = ICso / {1 + {substrate concentration / Km)} wherein Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant (Chen and Prusoff, Biochem. Pharmacol. 22 (1973), 3099-3108; I. H. Segal, Enzyme Kinetics, 1975, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 100-125; which were incorporated herein by reference).<br>
15 a) Factor Xa Assay<br>
In the assay for determining the inhibition of factor Xa activity TBS-PEG buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 200 mM Naa, 0.05 % (w/v) PEG-8000, 0-02 % (w/v) NaNa) was used. The ICso was determinedby combining in appropriate wells of a Costar half-area microtiter plate 25 M' human factor Xa {Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc.; South Bend, Indiana) in TBS-PEG; 40 pi<br>
20 I0%(v/v) DUSO inTBS-PEG(uninhlbitedcontrol)orvariousconcentrationsof the compound to<br>

The assay was performed by pre-incubatingthe compound of formula I plus enzyme for 10 min. Then the assay was initiated by adding substrate to obtain a final volume of TOO pi. The<br>
25 Initial velocity of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis was measured by the change in absorbance at 405 nm using a Bio-tek Instruments kinetic plate reader (Ceres UV900HDi) at 25 Â°C during the linear portion of the time course (usually 1.5 min after addition of substrate). The enzyme concentration was 0.5 nM and substrate concentration was 140 pM. b) Factor Vila Assay<br>
30 The inhibitory activity towards factor Vila/tissue factor activity was determined using a chromogenic assay essentially as described previously (j. A. Ostrem et at., Biochemistry 37 (1998) 1053-1059 which Was incorporated herein by reference). Kinetic assays were conducted<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
