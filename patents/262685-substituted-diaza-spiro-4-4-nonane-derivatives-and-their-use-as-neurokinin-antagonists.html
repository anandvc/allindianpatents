				<td>DIAZA~SPIRO-[4.4]-NONANE DERIVATIVES AS NEUROKININ (NKI) ANTAGONISTS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention concerns substituted diaza-spiro-[4.4]-nonane derivatives having neurokinin antagonistic activity, in particular NK1 antagonistic activity, their preparation, compositions comprising them and their use as a medicine, in particular for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of schizophrenia, emesis, anxiety and depression, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), circadian rhythm disturbances, pre-eclampsia, nociception, pain, in particular visceral and neuropathic pain, pancreatitis, neurogenic inflammation, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and micturition disorders such as urinary incontinence.<br>
Background of The Invention<br>
Tachykinins belong to a family of short peptides that are widely distributed in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous system (Bertrand 'and Geppetti, Trends Pharmacol Sci. 17:255-259 (1996) ; Lundberg, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 73:908-914 (1995) ; Maggi, Gen. Pharmacol. 26:911-944 (1995) ; Regoli et al., Pharmacol. Rev. 46 (1994)). They share the common C-terminal sequence Phe-Xaa-Gly-Leu-Met-NHi. Tachykinins released from peripheral sensory nerve endings are believed to be involved in neurogenic inflammation. In the spinal cord/central nervous system, tachykinins may play a role in pain transmission/perception and in some autonomic reflexes and behaviors. The three major tachykinins are Substance P (SP), Neurokinin A (NKA) and Neurokinin B (NKB) with preferential affinity for three distinct neurokinin receptor subtypes, termed NK1, NK2, and NK3, respectively. However, functional studies on cloned receptors suggest strong functional cross-interaction between the 3 tachykinins and their corresponding neurokinin receptors (Maggi and Schwartz, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 18:351-355 (1997)).<br>
Species differences in structure of NK1 receptors are responsible for species-related potency differences of NK1 antagonists (Maggi, Gen. Pharmacol. 26:911-944<br>
(1995) ; Regoli et al, Pharmacol. Rev. 46(4):551-599 (1994)). The human NK, receptor closely resembles the NK1 receptor of guinea-pigs and gerbils but differs markedly from the NK1 receptor of rodents. The development of neurokinin antagonists has led to date to a series of peptide compounds of which might be anticipated that they are metabolically too labile to be employed as pharmaceutically active substances (Longmore J. et al., DN&amp;P 8(l):5-23 (1995)).<br>
The tachykinins are involved in schizophrenia, depression, (stress-related) anxiety states, emesis, inflammatory responses, smooth muscle contraction and pain perception. Neurokinin antagonists are in development for indications such as emesis, anxiety and depression, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), circadian rhythm disturbances, visceral pain, neurogenic inflammation, asthma, micturition disorders, and nociceptkm. In particular, NK1 antagonists have a high therapeutic potential in emesis and depression and NK2 antagonists have a high therapeutic potential in asthma treatments. NKj antagonists seem to play a role in the treatment of pain/inflammation (Giardina, G. et al. Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 10(6):939-960 (2000)) and schizophrenia.<br>
Schizophrenia<br>
The NK3 antagonist SR142801 (Sanofi) was recently shown to have antipsychotic activity in schizophrenic patients without affecting negative symptoms (Arvantis, L. ACNP Meeting, December 2001). Activation of NKi receptors causes anxiety, stressful! events evoke elevated substance P (SP) plasma levels and NKi antagonists are reported to be anxiolytic in several animal models. The NKi antagonist from Merck, MK-869 shows antidepressant effects in major depression, but data were not conclusive due to a high placebo response rate. Moreover, the NK] antagonist from Glaxo-Welcome (S)-GR205,171 was shown to enhance dopamine release in the frontal cortex but not in the striatum (Lejeune et al. Soc. Neurosci., November 2001). It is therefore hypothesized that NK} antagonism in combination with NKi antagonism would be beneficial against both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.<br>
Anxiety and depression<br>
Depression is one of the most common affective disorders of modem society with a high and still increasing prevalence, particularly in the younger members of the population. The life time prevalence rates of Major depression (MOD, DSM-IV) is currently estimated to be 10-25 % for women and 5-12 % for men, whereby in about 25 % of patients the life time MOD is recurrent, without full inter-episode recovery and superimposed on dysthymic disorder. There is a high co-morbidity of depression with other mental disorders and, particularly in younger population high association with drug and alcohol abuse. In the view of the fact that depression primarily affects the population between 18-44 years of age e.g. the most productive population, it is obvious that it imposes a high burden on individuals, families and the whole society.<br>
Among all therapeutic possibilities, the therapy with antidepressants is incontestably the most effective. A large number of antidepressants have been developed and introduced to the market in the course of the last 40 years. Nevertheless, none of the current antidepressants fulfill all criteria of an ideal drug (high therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy, rapid onset of action, completely satisfactory short- and long-term safety, simple and favourable pharmacokinetics) or is without side effects which in one or the other way limits their use in all groups and subgroups of depressed patients.<br>
Since no treatment of the cause of depression exists at present, nor appears imminent, and no antidepressant is effective in more than 60-70 % of patients; the development of a new antidepressant which may circumvent any of the disadvantages of the available drugs is justified.<br>
Several findings indicate involvement of SP in stress-related anxiety states. Central injection of SP induces a cardiovascular response resembling the classical "fight or flight" reaction characterised physiologically by vascular dilatation in skeletal muscles and decrease of mesenteric and renal blood flow. This cardiovascular reaction is accompanied by a behavioural response observed in rodents after noxious stimuli or stress (Culman and Unger, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 73:885-891 (1995)). In mice, centrally administered NK] agonists and antagonists are anxiogenic and anxiolytic, respectively (Teixeira et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 311:7-14 (1996)). The ability of NK1 antagonists to inhibit thumping induced by SP (or by electric shock; Ballard et al.,<br>
Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 17:255-259 (2001)) might correspond to this antidepressant / anxiolytic activity, since in gerbils thumping plays a role as an alerting or warning signal to conspecifics.<br>
The NK1 receptor is widely distributed throughout the litnbic system and fear-processing pathways of the brain, including the amygdala, hippocampus, septum, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal grey. Additionally, substance P is released centrally in response to traumatic or noxious stimuli and substance P-associated neuro-transmission may contribute to or be involved in anxiety, fear, and the emotional disturbances that accompany affective disorders such as depression and anxiety. In support of this view, changes in substance P content in discrete brain regions can be observed in response to stressful stimuli (Brodin et al., Neuropeptides 26:253-260 (1994)).<br>
Central injection of substance P mimetics (agonists) induces a range of defensive behavioural and cardiovascular alterations including conditioned place aversion (Elliott, Exp. Brain. Res. 73:354-356 (1988)), potentiated acoustic startle response (Krase et al., Behav. Brain. Res. 63:81-88 (1994)), distress vocalisations, escape behaviour (Kramer et al, Science 281:1640-1645 (1998)) and anxiety on the elevated plus maze (Aguiar and Brandao, Physiol. Behav. 60:1183-1186 (1996)). These compounds did not modify motor performance and co-ordination on the rotarod apparatus or ambulation in an activity cage. Down-regulation of substance P biosynthesis occurs in response to the administration of known anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs (Brodin et al., Neuropeptides 26:253-260 (1994) ; Shirayama et al., Brain. Res. 739:70-78 (1996)). Similarly, a centrally administered NK1 agonist-induced vocalisation response hi guinea-pigs can be antagonised by antidepressants such as imipramine and fluoxetine as well as L-733,060, an NKi antagonist. These studies provide evidence suggesting that blockade of central NK1 receptors may inhibit psychological stress in a manner resembling antidepressants and anxiolytics (Rupniak and Kramer, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 20:1-12 (1999)), but without the side effects of present medications.<br>
Emesis<br>
Nausea and vomiting are among the most distressing side effects of cancer chemotherapy. These reduce the quality of life and may cause patients to delay or refuse, potentially curative drugs (Kris et al, J. Clin. Oncol, 3:1379-1384 (1985)). The incidence, intensity and pattern of emesis is determined by different factors, such as the chemotherapeutic agent, dosage and route of administration. Typically, early or acute emesis starts within the first 4 h after chemotherapy administration, reaching a peak between 4 h and 10 h, and decreases by 12 to 24 h. Delayed emesis (developing after 24 h and continuing until 3-5 days post chemotherapy) is observed with most 'high-emetogenic' chemotherapeutic drugs (level 4 and 5 according to Hesketh et al., J. Clin. Oncol 15:103 (1997)). In humans, these 'high-emetogenic' anti-cancer treatments, including cis-platinum, induce acute emesis in &gt; 98% and delayed emesis in 60-90% of cancer patients.<br>
Animal models of chemotherapy such as cisplatin-induced emesis in ferrets (Rudd and Naylor, Neuropharmacology 33:1607-1608 (1994) ; Naylor and Rudd, Cancer. Surv. 21:117-135 (1996)) have successfully predicted the clinical efficacy of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Although this discovery led to a successful therapy for the treatment of chemotherapy- and radiation-induced sickness in cancer patients, 5-HTs antagonists such as ondansetron and granisetron (either or not associated with dexamethasone) are effective in the control of the acute emetic phase (the first 24 h) but can only reduce the development of delayed emesis (&gt; 24 h) with poor efficacy (De Mulder et al, Annuals of Internal Medicine 113:834-840 (1990) ; Roila, Oncology 50:163-167 (1993)). Despite these currently most effective treatments for the prevention of both acute and delayed emesis, still 50% of patients suffer from delayed vomiting and/or nausea (Antiemetic Subcommittee, Annals Oncol 9:811-819 (1998)).<br>
In contrast to 5-HT3 antagonists, NK1 antagonists such as CP-99,994 (Piedimonte et al, L. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 266:270-273 (1993)) and aprepitant (also known as MK-869 or L-754,030 ; Kramer et al, Science 281:1640-1645 (1998) ; Rupniak and Kramer, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 20:1-12 (1999)) have now been shown to inhibit not only the acute but also the delayed phase of cisplatin-induced emesis in animals (Rudd et al, Br. J. Pharmacol. 119:931-936 (1996) ; Tattersall et al, Neuropharmacology 39:652-663 (2000)). NKi antagonists have also been demonstrated to reduce 'delayed'<br>
emesis in man in the absence of concomitant therapy (Cocquyt et al., Eur. J. Cancer 37:835-842 (2001) ; Navari et al, N. Engl. L Med. 340:190-195 (1999)). When administered together with dexamethasone and 5-HT3 antagonists, moreover, NKi antagonists (such as MK-869 and CJ-11,974, also known as Ezlopitant) have been shown to produce additional effects in the prevention of acute emesis (Campos et al., J. Clin. Oncol 19:1759-1767 (2001); Hesketh et al., Clin. Oncol. 17:338-343 (1999)). Central neurokinin NKi receptors play a major role in the regulation of emesis. NKi antagonists are active against a wide variety of emetic stimuli (Watson et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 115:84-94 (1995) ; Tattersall et al., Neuropharmacol. 35:1121-1129 (1996); Megens et al, J. Pharmacol Exp- Ther. 302:696-709 (2002)). The compounds are suggested to act by blocking central NKi-receptors in the nucleus tractus solitarius. Apart from NKi antagonism, CNS penetration is thus a prerequisite for the antiemetic activity of these compounds. Loperamide-induced emesis in ferrets can be used as a last and reliable screening model for the antiemetic activity of NKi antagonists. Further evaluation of their therapeutic value in the treatment of both the acute and the delayed phases of cisplatin-induced emesis has been demonstrated in the established ferret model (Rudd et al, Br. J. Pharmacol. 119:931-936 (1994)). This model studies both 'acute' and 'delayed' emesis after cisplatin and has been validated in terms of its sensitivity to 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, glucocorticoids (Sam et al, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 417:231-237 (2001)) and other pharmacological challenges. It is unlikely that any future anti-emetic would find clinical acceptance unless successfully treating both the 'acute' and 'delayed' phases of emesis.<br>
Viceral pain and Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)<br>
Visceral sensation refers to all sensory information that originates in the viscera (heart, lungs, GI tract, hepatobiliary tract and urogenital tract), and is transmitted to the central nervous system resulting in conscious perception. Both the vagal nerve via the nodose ganglion and the primary sympathetic afferent nerves via dorsal root ganglias (DUG) and second order neurons in the dorsal hom serve as the initial pathways along which visceral sensory information is conveyed to the brain stem and to the viscero-somatic cortex. Visceral pain may be caused by neoplastic processes (e.g. pancreas<br>
cancer),  inflammation  (e.g.   cholecystitis,  peritonitis),  ischemia  and  mechanical obstruction (e.g. urether stone).<br>
The mainstay of medical treatment for visceral pain linked to organic disorders (in casu cancer of the viscera) still focuses on opiates.<br>
Recent evidence suggests that non-organic visceral disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) and chronic pelvic pain may originate from a state of "visceral hyperalgia". The latter is defined as a condition in which physiological, non-painful visceral stimuli (e.g. gut distension) lead to conscious perception of pain due to a decreased threshold for pain. Visceral hyperalgesia may reflect a state of a permanent, post-inflammatory resetting of the threshold for membrane depolarization at neuronal synapses within visceral sensory pathways. The initial inflammation may occur at the periphery (e.g. infectuous gastroenteritis) or at the site of visceral sensory information integration (neurogenic inflammation in the dorsal horn). Both SP and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) have been shown to act as pro-inflammatory neuropeptides in neurogenic inflammation.<br>
Visceral hyperalgesia is currently considered as one of the prime targets for drug development aimed at treating functional bowel diseases, which occur in 15 to 25% of the western population. They constitute an enormous socio-economic problem in terms of medical care costs, prescription costs and absenteism. Current treatment options include anti-spasmodics (IBS and NCCP), promotility agents (e.g. tegasorod in constipation-IBS), laxatives (constipation-IBS), and loperamide (diarrhea-IBS), amongst others. None of these approaches has been shown to be very effective, particularly hi treating pain. Low dose tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs are used to treat visceral hyperalgesia in pain-predominant IBS, but both classes of compounds may have considerable effects on colonic transit. Ongoing research in this field has identified a considerable number of molecular targets that could serve for drug development in visceral hyperalgesia. These include NK receptors, the CGRP receptor, 5-HT3 receptors, glutamate receptors, and the kappa opioid receptor. Ideally, a "visceral analgesic compound" should block heightened sensory transfer from the viscera to the CNS without affecting the normal physiological homeostasis of the GI tract with regards to propulsive motor activity, absorption and secretion, and sensation.<br>
There is compelling evidence linking tachykinin to visceral nociceptive signalling. A number of pre-clinical publications on the role of NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptors in visceral pain and visceral hyperalgesia indicate a discrepancy between the implication of NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptors in the different inflammation hypersensitivity rodent models. Recently, Kamp et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 299:105-113 (2001) suggested that a combined neurokinin receptor antagonist could be more active than a selective neurokinin receptor antagonist. Substance P and NK], NK2 and NK3 receptors are elevated in clinical pain states, including visceral pain states (Lee et al., Gastroenterol. 118:A846 (2000)). Given the recent failures of NKi receptor antagonists as an analgesic in human pain trials (Goldstein et al., Clin. Pharm. Ther. 67:419-426 (2000)), combinations of antagonists may be necessary to have a significant clinical effect. NK3 receptor antagonists are anti-hyperalgesic (Julia et al., Gastroenterol. 116:1124-1131 (1999)) ; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 299:105-113 (2001)). Recently, the involvement of NKi and NKs receptors but not NKi receptors at spinal level was demonstrated in visceral hypersensitivity mediated by nociceptive and non-nociceptive afferent inputs (Gaudreau &amp; Ploudre, Neurosci. Lett. 351:59-62 (2003). Combining the NKi .2.3 antagonistic activity could therefore represent an interesting therapeutic target for the development of novel treatments for visceral hyperalgesia.<br>
A reasonable number of pre-clinical publications over the role of NKi receptors in visceral pain has been published. Using NKi receptor knockout mice and NKi antagonists in animal models, different groups have demonstrated the important role played by the NK] receptor in hyperalgesia and visceral pain. The distribution of NKi receptors and substance P favours a major role in visceral rather than in somatic pain. Indeed more than 80% of visceral primary afferent contain substance P compared with only 25% skin afferents. NKi receptors are also involved in gastrointestinal motility (Tonini et al, Gastroenterol. 120:938-945 (2001) ; Okano et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 298:559-564 (2001)). Because of this dual role in both gastrointestinal motility and in nociceptkm, NKi antagonists are considered to have potential to ameliorate symptoms in IBS patients.<br>
Urinary incontinence<br>
Urge urinary incontinence is caused by urinary bladder or detrusor hyperreflexia ("irritable bladder"). This hyperreflexia relates to hyperexcitability of bladder sensory afferent C-fibers projecting to tbe spinal cord. The origin of C-fiber hyperexcitability is multifactorial but occurs for example after bladder infection and chronic distention of the bladder wall (eg. benign prostate hypertrophy, BPH). Hence, treatment should be aimed at decreasing neuronal hyperexcitability. Intravesical instillation of vanilloids (eg. capsaicin) results in a long-term beneficial effect on detrusor hyperreflexia refractory to conventional treatment with anticholinergic drugs. Analogous to animal studies, the effect of vanilloids is mediated through a neurotoxic effect on sensory nerve terminals. In human bladder, subendothelial sensory nerves contain tachykinins, which drive detrusor hyperexcitability. The NK receptors involved in this effect are peripheral NKa receptors and to a lesser extent, also NKi receptors. The latter are claimed to play a role in bladder hyperreflexia at the level of the spinal cord. As a consequence, a centrally acting NKi/peripherally acting NKa antagonist is preferred for the treatment of detrusor hyperexcitability. Interestingly, activation of NK2 receptors increases aromatase activity in Sertoli cells. NK2 receptor antagonists reduce serum testosterone levels in mice, and this may be of therapeutic importance in BPH.<br>
Background prior art<br>
Compounds containing a piperidinyl-moiety, substituted by a piperidinyl or pyrrolidinyl-moiety were published in WO97/24324 (July 10, 1997), WO 97/24350 (July 10, 1997) and WO97/24356 (July 10, 1997), all by Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. for use as substance P (neurokinin) antagonists. Compounds comprising a substituted diaza-spiro[4.5]decanyl-moiety were published in WO01/94346 (December 13, 2001) by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG for use as neurokinin receptor antagonists.<br>
The compounds of the present invention differ structurally from the compounds of the prior art in that the compounds of the present invention all comprise a piperidinyl-moiety substituted with a diaza-spiro[4.4]nonyl moiety as well as in their unproved ability as potent, orally and centrally active neurokinin antagonists with therapeutic value, especially for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of schizophrenia,<br>
emesis, anxiety and depression, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), circadian rhythm disturbances, pre-eclampsia, nociception, pain, in particular visceral and neuropathic pain, pancreatitis, neurogenic inflammation, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and micturition disorders such as urinary incontinence.<br>

stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the N-oxide form thereof and a prodrug thereof, wherein the compound is a compound with compound number 2-5 and 2-8, as described in this application, in particular in any one of the tables, in particular in any one of Tables 1-2.<br>
In the framework of this application, alkyl is defined as a monovalent straight or branched saturated hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, 1-methylpropyl, 1,1-dimethylethyl, pentyl, hexyl ; alkyl further defines a monovalent cyclic saturated hydrocarbon radical having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, for example cyclopropyl, methylcyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. The definition of alkyl also comprises an alkyl radical that is optionally substituted on one or more carbon atoms with one or more phenyl, halo, cyano, oxo, hydroxy, fbrmyl and amino radicals, for example hydroxyalkyl, in particular hydroxymethyl and hydroxyethyl and polyhaloalkyl, in particular difJuoromethyl and trifluoromethyl.<br>
In the framework of this application, halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.<br>
In the framework of this application, with "compounds according to the invention" is meant a compound according to the general Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the N-oxide form thereof and a prodrug thereof.<br>
In the framework of this application, especially in the moiety Alk"-Y-Alkb in Formula (I), when two or more consecutive elements of said moiety denote a covalent bond, then a single covalent bond is denoted. For example, when Alk* and Y denote both a covalent bond and Alkb is -CH2-, then the moiety Alk"-Y-Alkb denotes -CH2-. Similary, if Alk", Y and Alkb each denote a covalent bond and L denotes H, then the moiety Alka-Y-Alkb-L denotes -H.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are defined to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salts forms that the compounds according to Formula (I) are able to form. Said salts can be obtained by treating the base form of the compounds according to Formula (I) with appropriate acids, for example inorganic acids, for example hydrohalic acid, hi particular hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid ; organic acids, for example acetic acid,<br>
hydroxyacetic acid, propanoic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-tohienesulfbnic acid, cyclamic acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid and pamoic acid.<br>
The compounds according to Formula (I) containing acidic protons may also be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salts forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salts forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkaline and earth alkaline metal salts, in particular lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium salts, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, AT-methyl-D-glucamine, hybramine salts, and salts with amino acids, for example arginine and lysine.<br>
Conversely, said salts forms can be converted into the free forms by treatment with an appropriate base or acid.<br>
The term addition salt as used in the framework of this application also comprises the solvates that the compounds according to Formula (I) as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are, for example, hydrates and alcoholates.<br>
The .N-oxide forms of the compounds according to Formula (I) are meant to comprise those compounds of Formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide, particularly, those N-oxides wherein one or more tertiary nitrogens (e.g of the piperazinyl or pyrrolidinyl radical) are N-oxidized. Such N-oxides can easily be obtained by a skilled person without any inventive skills and they are obvious alternatives for the compounds according to Formula (I) since these compounds are metabolites, which are formed by oxidation in the human body upon uptake . As is generally known, oxidation is normally the first step involved in drug metabolism ( Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, 1977, pages 70- 75). As is also generally known, the metabolite form of a compound can also be administered to a human instead of the compound per se, with possibly the same effects.<br>
The compounds according to the invention possess at least 2 oxydizable nitrogens (tertiary amines moieties). It is therefore highly likely that TV-oxides will form in the human metabolism.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) may be converted to the corresponding TV-oxide<br>
forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide form. Said N-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of Formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, aflcylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, bwer alkanols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the possible isomeric forms that the compounds of Formula (I) may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms having that designation, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. More in particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E or Z-stereochemistry at said double bond. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
Following CAS nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the reference center. R* and S* each indicate optically pure stereogenic centers with undetermined absolute configuration. If "a" and "P" are used :the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system (hydrogen atom in compounds<br>
according to Formula (I)) relative to the position of the highest priority substituent on the reference atom is denominated "a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or "P", if it is on the other side of the mean plane determined by the ring system.<br>
Compounds according to Formula (I) and some of the intermediate compounds have at least two stereogenic centers in their structure.<br>
The invention also comprises derivative compounds (usually called "pro-drugs") of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention, which are degraded in vivo to yield the compounds according to the invention. Pro-drugs are usually (but not always) of lower potency at the target receptor than the compounds to which they are degraded. Pro-drugs are particularly useful when the desired compound has chemical or physical properties that make its administration difficult or inefficient. For example, the desired compound may be only poorly soluble, it may be poorly transported across the mucosal epithelium, or it may have an undesirably short plasma half-life. Further discussion on pro-drugs may be found in Stella, V. J. et al., "Prodrugs", Drug Delivery Systems, 1985, pp. 112-176, and Drugs, 1985, 29, pp. 455-473.<br>
Pro-drugs forms of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention will generally be compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof and the N-oxide form thereof, having an acid group which is esterified or amidated. Included in such esterified acid groups are groups of the formula -COORX, where R" is a C1-6alkyl, phenyl, benzyl or one of the following groups :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Amidated groups include groups of the formula - CONRHl7, wherein Ry is H, Ci-salkyl, phenyl or benzyl and Rz is -OH, H, Ci-galkyl, phenyl or benzyl. Compounds according to the invention having an amino group may be derivatised with a ketone or<br>
an aldehyde such as formaldehyde to form a Mannich base. This base will hydrolyze with first order kinetics in aqueous solution.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) as prepared in the processes described below may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers that can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of Formula (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound would be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
Pharmacology<br>
Substance P and other tachykinins are involved in a variety of biological actions such as pain transmission (nociception), neurogenic inflammation, smooth muscle contraction, plasma protein extravasation, vasodilation, secretion, mast cell degranulation, and also in activation of the immune system. A number of diseases are deemed to be engendered by activation of neurokinin receptors, in particular the NK] receptor, by excessive release of substance P and other neurokinins in particular cells such as cells in the neuronal plexi of the gastrointestinal tract, unmyelinated primary sensory afferent neurons, sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons and nonneuronal cell types (DN&amp;P 8(l):5-23 (1995) and Longmore J. et a/.,"Neurokinin Receptors" Pharmacological Reviews 46(4):551-599 (1994)).<br>

coronary arteries. The binding affinity of the present compounds for the human, guinea-pig and gerbil neurokinin receptors may also be determined in vitro in a receptor binding test using 3H-substance-P as radioligand. The subject compounds also show substance-P antagonistic activity in vivo as may be evidenced by, for instance, the antagonism of substance P-induced plasma extravasation in guinea-pigs, or the antagonism of drug-induced emesis in ferrets (Watson et al, Br. J. Pharmacol. 115:84-94 (1995)).<br>

The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention, in particular a compound according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the N-oxide form thereof and a prodrug thereof.<br>
The compounds according to the invention, in particular the compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the N-oxide form thereof and the prodrugs thereof, or any subgroup or combination thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, in particular, for administration orally,<br>
rectally, percutaneously, by parenteral injection or by inhalation. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
Since the compounds according to the invention are potent orally, mainly centrally active NX-antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said<br>
compounds for administration orally are especially advantageous.<br>

D. Pharmacological example<br>
Example D.I : Binding experiment for h-NKu h-NK2 and h-NK3 receptors The compounds according to the invention were investigated for interaction with various neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels and transporter binding sites using the radioligand binding technique. Membranes from tissue homogenates or from cells, expressing the receptor or transporter of interests, were incubated with a radioactively labelled substance ([3H]- or [125I] ligand) to label a particular receptor. Specific receptor binding of the radioligand was distinguished from the non-specific membrane labelling by selectively inhibiting the receptor labelling with an unlabelled drug (the blank), known to compete with the radioligand for binding to the receptor sites. Following incubation, labelled membranes were harvested and rinsed with excessive cold buffer to remove non-bound radioactivity by rapid filtration under suction. Membrane bound radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter and results were expressed in counts per minute (cpm).<br>
The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and tested at 10 concentrations ranging from 10-10 to 10-5 M.<br>
