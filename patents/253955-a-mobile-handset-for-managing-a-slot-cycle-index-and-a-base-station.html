				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile handset for managing a slot cycle index and a<br>
base station and generally to communications devices, and more particularly to mobile hand held<br>
communications networks.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Many people are familiar with mobile handsets. Mobile handsets are typically small<br>
electronic devices that communicate with a base station to place mobile calls. Many mobile<br>
handsets also perform other features in addition to placing mobile calls. For example, some<br>
mobile handsets are capable of transmitting data in addition to voice.<br>
A popular feature on many mobile handsets is push-to-talk. With push-to-talk a mobile<br>
handset user is able to push a single button to complete a call to a specific mobile handset, or<br>
some small number of mobile handsets. The mobile handset acts like a "walkie-talkie."<br>
However, generally, instead of communicating directly to another "walkie-talkie" a mobile<br>
handset with push-to-talk typically communicates through a base station to another mobile<br>
handset using a single button push to initiate the connection. Additionally, like a "walkie-talkie"<br>
when using a mobile handset with push-to-talk, after a user pushes the button they are able to<br>
speak without having to wait for the other mobile handset to ring and the other user to answer.<br>
However, some delay between pushing the button and connecting to the other mobile<br>
handset may exist. It would be advantageous to try to lower that delay as much as possible.<br>
Additionally, while this delay may typically be more noticeable to a user using push-to-talk, or<br>
other single button push services, the delay may exist with other mobile handset services<br>
including, but not limited to mobile telephone calls and mobile data calls. It would also be<br>
advantageous to try to lower the delay as much as possible when using any other<br>
communications services that exhibit a delay when communicating with a base station or other<br>
transceiver.<br>
One cause of delay when beginning a mobile call, including push-to-talk, and data calls is<br>
related to how often a mobile communicates with a base station. Many current mobile handsets<br>
are designed to communicate with a base station at specific time intervals. These time intervals<br><br><br><br>
are the only time that the mobile handset can begin a mobile call. The longer the delay between<br>
intervals, the longer it is likely to take to set up a mobile call. It will be understood by those of<br>
skill in the art that the delay will be variable and somewhat random. Depending on when a user<br>
initiates a call relative to the next slot cycle. Slot cycle is the time when the mobile handset<br>
communicates with the base station. If the user attempts a call close to the next slot cycle, the<br>
delay may be relatively short, however, if the user attempts a call just after a slot cycle, the delay<br>
may be relatively long.<br>
As stated above one aspect to consider regarding mobile handsets is how often and when<br>
the mobile handset should communicate with the base station. Typically, the more often the<br>
mobile handset communicates with the base station the faster the mobile handset will be able to<br>
respond when the person using the mobile handset attempts to make a call. For example, if the<br>
mobile handset communicates with the base station every second, when a user attempts to make<br>
a call it will only be one second, at most before the mobile handset is able to communicate with<br>
the base station and start the process of placing the call. However, if the mobile handset only<br>
communicates with the base station every two seconds, then it could be as long as two seconds<br>
before the process of placing the call begins.<br>
So, to speed up placing a mobile call, the mobile handset should communicate with the<br>
base station as often as possible. However, communicating with the base station as often as<br>
possible has many drawbacks. Transmitting to the base station typically takes power. On a<br>
battery-operated device, this can be a critical consideration. Additionally, in many cases the<br>
more often a mobile handset communicates with a base station, the fewer mobile handsets that<br>
are able to use the base station. This is due to the fact that the base station typically has a limited<br>
number of transceivers to communicate with mobile stations. For this reason, each mobile<br>
station is given a time when it can communicate with the base station. Multiple mobile handsets<br>
are able to communicate with the base station by time-sharing. The more often a mobile handset<br>
communicates with the base station, the fewer other mobile handsets can communicate with the<br>
base station. For these reasons, and possibly others, the delay between communications between<br>
mobile handsets and base stations is not typically made arbitrarily short.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12 more details of communication between mobile handsets and base<br>
stations will be discussed. The diagram 700 includes a graph 704. The graph 704 shows when a<br><br><br>
mobile handset 724 communicates with a base station 722. The communication is shown as<br>
electromagnetic signals 720. Communications occur at 707, 709, and 712. It should be noted<br>
that this is only one possible example. The time between communications between base station<br>
and mobile handset may not always the same.<br>
Typically the slot cycle index is initially negotiated between the base station and the<br>
mobile handset, by the manufacturer. The number of clock cycles is known as slot cycle index.<br>
Slot cycle index is not a linear. Slot cycle index 0 indicates that communication occurs every<br>
cycle. Slot cycle index 1 indicates that a communication occurs every cycle. Referring back to<br>
FIG. 12 a slot cycle index 3 indicates that a communication occurs every four cycle. Slot cycle<br>
index above slot cycle index 3 are also possible. Slot cycle index timing can be summarized as<br>
follows, where x is the slot cycle index:<br>
TIME BETWEEN COMMUNICATION = 1.28 x (2n)<br>
For example, for slot cycle index 0 a communication occurs every 1.28 seconds, slot<br>
cycle index 1 is a communication every 2.56 seconds, and for slot cycle 2 a communication<br>
occurs every 5.12 seconds. Other slot cycle indexes are possible. Additionally, "negative" slot<br>
cycles are possible. In one possible implementation of "negative" slot cycles the number "n" in<br>
the equation above is a negative number. The use of "negative" slot cycles allows<br>
communication to occur more often than every 1.28 seconds.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Many people use mobile handsets. As many users may have noticed, sometimes it can<br>
take a while to complete a mobile call. One thing that may affect is known as slot cycle index.<br>
The slot cycle index is the amount of time that the mobile handset must wait before<br>
communicating with the base station. The higher the slot cycle index the longer the mobile<br>
handset must wait before communicating with the base station. The lower the slot cycle index<br>
the shorter the delay. However shorter slot cycle priorities limit the number of mobile handsets<br>
that can communicate with a base station. Additionally, shorter slot cycle index typically<br>
increase the amount of battery power used by the mobile handset, commonly lowering standby<br>
and talk time.<br><br><br>
The slot cycle index is currently negotiated by a mobile handset and a base station.<br>
However, if the slot cycle index could be selected dynamically a mobile handset that operates<br>
more efficiently for the user would result. Talk time could be maximized when the battery, or<br>
other mobile power source is low, while connect time for a mobile call could be minimized when<br>
the battery is near fully charged or at times when the user is likely to make a mobile call.<br>
Additionally, location could be used to determine the likelihood that the user will make a mobile<br>
call. However, current network usage would typically need to be considered when determining<br>
if the slot cycle index should be changed. Mobile handset users could also charged for quicker<br>
response times, or mobile handset users on more expensive plans could be given typically faster<br>
response times. Many different things can be considered in determining when to adjust slot<br>
cycle index. More examples will be given below.<br>
Dynamically adjusting slot cycle index allows a mobile handset to, in some cases, operate<br>
more efficiently. In some cases the mobile handset may exhibit faster response time due to<br>
lower slot cycle index, while in other cases the mobile handset may use less battery power due to<br>
the higher slot cycle index. In addition, the service provider will be able to dynamically change<br>
slot cycle index to allow more users access to a base station.<br>
A method and mobile station for enabling a preferred slot cycle is disclosed in WO<br>
03/053093.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Several methods of dynamically changing slot cycle index are possible. Referring now to<br>
FIG. 1 a flowchart 100 that illustrates one possible example will be discussed. The flowchart<br>
100 shows one example of a method of dynamically changing slot cycle index. The flowchart<br>
100 begins at 103. In step 106 a request from a mobile handset to operate at a higher slot cycle<br>
index is received. The mobile handset may send a request to operate in a higher slot cycle index<br>
for several reasons. Typically, the occurrence of a trigger event will cause the mobile handset to<br>
send the request. Trigger events at the mobile handset can include the battery power available at<br>
the mobile handset, the time of day, or feature availability at the mobile handset. More details<br>
regarding trigger events will be discussed with respect to FIG. 3. Additionally, trigger events<br>
that are generally related to specific devices, such as the mobile handset or the base station, as<br>
well as groups of devices such as the network will be discussed with respect to FIG. 10.<br><br><br>
It is determined if the current system loading will allow an increase in slot cycle index for<br>
the mobile handset in step 109. If the current system loading will allow, the mobile handset is<br>
set at a higher slot cycle index in step 113. As can be seen in this example, typically, the base<br>
station and the mobile station negotiate to determine if the mobile handset should operate in a<br>
higher slot cycle index.<br>
The flowchart 100 is one possible example of a method of dynamically changing slot<br>
cycle index. Other examples are possible. For example, a request may come from a base station<br>
instead of a mobile handset. In this example, the base station sends a request to the mobile<br>
handset to operate at a higher slot cycle index. For this example, as discussed with respect to<br>
FIG. 1 above, typically, the base station and the mobile handset negotiate to determine if the<br>
mobile handset slot cycle index should be changed. Additionally, slot cycle index may be<br>
increased, as shown, decreased, or kept the same based on different trigger events.<br>
Several examples of trigger events will be discussed below with respect to FIG. 3 below.<br>
FIG. 3 includes discussions of trigger events that may increase or decrease slot cycle index. In<br>
some cases different trigger events may be considered at the same time to determine if slot cycle<br>
index should be changed. The term trigger event is used throughout to describe an event that<br>
causes the method to change slot cycle index. However, in some cases the term trigger state may<br>
be better. For example, if several factors are considered at one time, it is the state of each factor<br>
that determines the outcome. Additionally, it may be the change of a single factor that causes the<br>
determination to occur. Alternately, several states changing could cause a determination to<br>
occur. In this application, the term trigger event will be used to describe a state, or change in<br>
state that causes a request to operate at a different slot cycle index to be transmitted. In FIG. 2<br>
an example of a specific mobile handset user will be discussed.<br>
Some advantages include the ability to conserve battery power when the battery is low by<br>
raising slot cycle index. However, in some cases it may be determined that slot cycle index<br>
should be increased even though the battery is low. Additionally, system loading can typically,<br>
in some cases, be lowered if necessary during times users are using up network capacity.<br><br><br>
Referring now to FIG. 2 an example will be discussed with respect to a diagram 125.<br>
The diagram 125 includes a sports stadium 127, an office building 130, and a road 131.<br>
Additionally, the diagram 125 includes a car 133 and a house 135. In the example of FIG. 2 a<br>
mobile handset user, Mary, begins her day at the house 135. When at home, Mary does not tend<br>
to user her mobile handset. However, during her drive to work Mary tends to make many calls<br>
using her mobile handset. Mary's mobile handset requests a higher slot cycle index during times<br>
of day that the mobile handset is typically used.<br>
Typically, on her way to work Mary's mobile handset is set at a higher slot cycle index.<br>
When Mary arrives at work in her building 130 she continues to use her mobile handset<br>
throughout the day. The mobile handset typically operates in a higher slot cycle index. This<br>
enables Mary to complete calls more quickly typically. However, Mary's building is close to the<br>
sports stadium 127. On days that sports events occur at the stadium 127 many people normally<br>
attend, and typically carry mobile handsets. The large number of people at the stadium 127 put a<br>
large load on the base station 140 that is near the stadium 127. When the loading at the base<br>
station 140 is high, Mary's mobile handset is not allowed to operate at a higher slot cycle index.<br>
The base station 140 is able to communicate with more mobile handsets when the slot cycle<br>
index is decreased.<br>
It should be pointed out that the discussion of FIG. 2 is only one possible<br>
example. Dynamically modifying slot cycle index could occur for a variety of reasons.<br>
Additionally, not allowing slot cycle index to be changed could happen for a variety of reasons.<br>
Slot cycle index can be increased when a trigger event occurs, as will be discussed with respect<br>
to FIG. 3 or slot cycle index can be decreased when a trigger event occurs as discussed with<br>
respect to FIG. 4.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, a flowchart 200 will be discussed. The flowchart 200 begins at<br>
step 202. At step 204 it is determined that a trigger event has occurred. The trigger event is<br>
evaluated in step 206 and a determination is made to request a higher priority slot cycle in step<br>
209. The request for a higher priority slot cycle is made in step 212. In the flowchart 200 of<br>
FIG. 3 a trigger event occurs that causes a request for a higher slot cycle index. However, a<br>
trigger event can also occur that would cause a request for a lower slot cycle index, as will be<br>
discussed with respect to FIG. 4.<br><br><br>
Many events can be considered trigger events. Several examples will be discussed<br>
below, however, other examples are possible. One example of a trigger event is battery power.<br>
Operating a mobile handset in a high slot cycle index state usually increases the amount of<br>
battery power consumed for a given period of time. High battery power may be a trigger event<br>
to operate in a higher slot cycle index. Conversely, low battery power may be a trigger event to<br>
operate in a lower slot cycle index.<br>
Another example of a trigger event is time of day. If the current time of day is one that a<br>
mobile handset user tends to make many calls, or one that the service providers expect many<br>
calls to be made, a request to operate in a higher slot cycle index may occur. Again, as with the<br>
battery power example, the converse is also true. If it is a time of day when it is unlikely that a<br>
call will occur, this may be a trigger event to operate in a lower slot cycle index.<br>
A third example of possible trigger events is system loading. Higher slot cycle<br>
index places increased demands on system resources. When system loading is low, slot cycle<br>
index may typically be increased without placing a burden on the base station that the based<br>
station is unable to meet. However, when system loading is high, one possible way to decrease<br>
these demands is to lower the slot cycle index on some mobile handsets. It is important to note<br>
that these are only examples.<br>
The examples discussed above and other examples discussed below will be factors<br>
considered when deciding to increase or decrease slot cycle index. In some cases several<br>
different trigger events will be considered before an increase or a decrease of slot cycle index is<br>
made. For example, if battery power is low, the time of day is one that a call is likely to occur,<br>
and the system loading would allow for an increase slot cycle index, the slot cycle index may be<br>
decreased to save battery power, even though two other factors would allow for an increase in<br>
slot cycle index.<br>
Another trigger event is location. The mobile handset may be in a location where the<br>
user has made one or more, possibly many, mobile calls in the past. In this case it may be<br>
advantageous to increase the slot cycle index of the mobile handset. However, typically, other<br>
trigger events will be considered. For example, as discussed with respect to FIG. 2 when Mary<br><br><br>
is at work but a sporting event is occurring near by, even though she usually makes many calls<br>
using her mobile handset, it may not be possible to increase the slot cycle index of her mobile<br>
handset because system loading is to large.<br>
Location may effect the decision to increase or decrease slot cycle index in another way.<br>
Location tends to effect the amount of transmit power needed to communicate with a base<br>
station. In locations where transmit power is high it may be advantageous to decrease slot cycle<br>
index. In locations where transmit power is low, it may be advantageous to increase slot cycle<br>
index. As with examples discussed above, transmit power can be considered in conjunction with<br>
other factors.<br>
In another example, battery power may be high, while system loading is low and time of<br>
day is one that a call is likely to occur, however, the mobile handset may be located at a location<br>
where a large amount of transmit power is needed to communicate with the base station. In that<br>
case it may be advantageous to operate in a lower slot cycle index.<br>
In some cases mobile handset users may pay for higher performance service. For<br>
example, users may be more to have higher slot cycle index. In some cases, higher slot cycle<br>
index may be included on higher priced plans as part of a package of services provided.<br>
In some cases it may be likely that when a call occurs another call may occur soon after.<br>
The fact that a call has recently occurred may be used as a trigger event to increase slot cycle<br>
index. One case where several calls in rapid succession tend to be likely is one button push<br>
services, such as push-to-talk.<br>
Additionally, in some cases a feature may exist that requires higher slot cycle index. Or,<br>
in some cases the carrier or the mobile handset may desires higher slot cycle performance.<br>
Feature availability may be a trigger event. When a feature is available, for example, due to<br>
mobile handset proximity to a base station that supports the feature, the availability of the feature<br>
may trigger an increase, or decrease in slot cycle index, depending on the requirements of the<br>
feature. As with other trigger events, several trigger events can be combined to determine if slot<br>
cycle index should be increased or decreased.<br><br><br>
As was discussed above, with respect to FIG. 3, a trigger event may trigger an increase in<br>
slot cycle index, while another trigger event may cause a decrease in slot cycle index. As shown<br>
in FIG. 4, a trigger event may cause a request for a lower slot cycle. FIG. 4 is a flowchart 225.<br>
The flowchart 225 begins at step 227. At step 229 it is determined that a trigger event has<br>
occurred. In step 232 the trigger event is evaluated and it is determined that triggers a lower slot<br>
cycle has occurred. In step 234 it is determined that a request for a lower slot cycle should<br>
occur. A lower priority slot cycle is requested at step 240. Summarizing FIGS. 3 and 4, a<br>
trigger event occurs and depending on the type of trigger event a request for a lower or higher<br>
slot cycle occurs. In some cases a combination of trigger events or current states may be<br>
considered when deciding to request a higher or lower slot cycle. Additionally, trigger events or<br>
states may occur in a mobile handset, at a base station, or they may be inherent in the service that<br>
a user has purchased. For examples, see FIG. 10 below. The combination of trigger events<br>
discussed above could occur in a combination of the mobile handset, and base station and could<br>
also be based on the service purchase. Advantages may include the ability to increase<br>
performance of a mobile handset during periods of time or in locations where a mobile handset<br>
user is likely to make a mobile call.<br>
It will be clear to those of skill in the art that the converse is also true. The lack of some<br>
trigger events may cause slot cycle index to be increased.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, a flowchart 250 will be discussed. The flowchart 250 is similar<br>
to the flowchart 200 of FIG. 3. The flowchart 250 includes the addition of several possible<br>
trigger events, listed at step 255. Beginning at 252, the flowchart 250 determines that a trigger<br>
event has occurred at step 255. Step 255 is the same or similar to step 205 of FIG. 3. Possible<br>
trigger events include, but are not limited to: available battery power, time of day, location,<br>
transmit power needed, system loading, priority, occurrence of a call, and feature availability.<br>
As stated above, several trigger events can be considered when determining if slot cycle index<br>
should be increased, decreased, or kept the same. Additionally, each trigger event may be given<br>
a different weight when determining slot cycle index. At step 260 a request for a slot cycle index<br>
change occurs. Step 260 of FIG. 5 is the same or similar to a combination of 212 of FIG. 3 and<br>
step 240 of FIG. 4.<br><br><br>
Referring back to step 255, low battery power would typically be considered a trigger<br>
event for a lower priority slot cycle because higher priority slot cycles typically consume more<br>
battery power. The converse is also true. A high battery power would typically be considered a<br>
trigger event for a higher priority slot cycle. It should be noted that this is only one example. It<br>
will be understood by those of skill in the art that "low" battery power and "high" battery power<br>
are not precisely defined here and may vary widely from one specific implementation to another.<br>
In some cases battery power may be considered with other trigger events. Additionally,<br>
in some examples, battery power may not be considered at all. Specific trigger events used in<br>
any particular application can be customized depending on the needs of that particular<br>
application. Some trigger events will be discussed further with respect to FIG. 10. Advantages<br>
may include the ability to change slot cycle index to conserve battery power when battery power<br>
is low.<br>
When placing a call, especially a push to talk call, it may be likely that several calls will<br>
be placed in rapid succession. Generally increasing slot cycle index when a call has recently<br>
been placed will tend to have the advantage of increasing the ability of the mobile handset to<br>
place calls rapidly.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6, a mobile handset 280 will be discussed. The mobile handset<br>
280 includes an antenna 284. The antenna 284 is a transducer for coupling radio frequency<br>
signals to a transceiver 282. The transceiver 282 includes a transmitter and a receiver for<br>
sending and receiving radio frequency signals. The transceiver 282 is coupled to a processor<br>
295. The processor 295 is used to perform processing function necessary for the mobile handset.<br>
It will be understood by those of skill in the art that the processor could be a single processor or<br>
multiple processors. Additionally, the processor could be a microprocessor, a microcontroller, or<br>
multiple micorprocessors or microcontrolers, or similar devices. The processor could be a digital<br>
signal processor or multiple digital signal processors. The processor could be a combination of<br>
different types of processors, including, but not limited to microprocessors, microcontrollers, and<br>
digital signal processors. The processor could also be stand alone digital logic, programmable<br>
logic, such as field programmable gate arrays, complex programmable logic devices, or other<br>
forms of programmable logic. The processor could be any circuit capable of performing the<br><br><br>
' steps included in the claims. The processor 295 is coupled to a memory 293. The memory 293<br>
is used to store information used by the processor 293.<br>
A mobile power source in the form of a battery, 298 is coupled to the processor to<br>
provide power to the processor. It will be clear to those of skill in the art that the battery 298<br>
may provide power to other circuits in the mobile handset. Additionally, the battery 298 may be<br>
other types of mobile power sources, for example, the battery 298 may actually be a fuel cell, or<br>
other mobile power source. Additionally, the mobile handset is enclosed by a case 288. In many<br>
cases lowering the slot cycle index will tend to conserve battery power at the mobile handset.<br>
Advantages may also include the ability to increase a mobile handsets performance when placing<br>
a push-to-talk call. In some cases the push-to-talk call may connect more quickly.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 7, a base station 330 will be discussed. The base station 330<br>
includes an antenna 332. The antenna couples radio frequency signals to a transceiver 337. The<br>
transceiver 337 is coupled to a processor 349. Additionally, the processor 349 typically<br>
communicates with a terrestrial communications network. The processor 349 is coupled to a<br>
memory 343. The base station 330 is enclosed by a case 334. Allowing the base station to<br>
dynamically change the slot cycle index used by a mobile station will tend to have the advantage<br>
of allowing the base station to manage system loading. When system loading is high, slot cycle<br>
index may be decreased. Decreased slot cycle index decreases how often mobile handsets<br>
communicate with the base station.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 8 a diagram 375 will be discussed. The diagram 375 includes a<br>
mobile handset 280. The mobile handset 280 is the same or similar to the mobile handset 280 of<br>
FIG. 6. Additionally, the diagram 375 of FIG. 8 includes a base station 330. The base station<br>
330 is the same or similar to the base station 330 of FIG. 6. The mobile handset 280 and the<br>
base station 330 transmit electromagnetic signals to allow information to be communicated<br>
between the two devices. It will be clear to those of skill in the art that the base station may<br>
communicate with multiple mobile handsets, including the mobile handset 280. In some cases<br>
not all mobile handsets will have dynamically adjustable slot cycle index. In other cases, it is<br>
possible that all mobile handsets will have adjustable slot cycle index. Additionally, it is<br>
important to note that typically the base station 330 and the mobile handset 280 will negotiate to<br>
determine slot cycle index setting. Many different ways to negotiate slot cycle index setting will<br><br><br>
be apparent to those of skill in the art. For example, the multiple trigger events, as discussed<br>
above, can be combined. Different trigger events can have different "weights" associated with<br>
them when trying determine what course of action to take.<br>
Additionally, in some cases it may be advantageous to have some trigger events cause<br>
slot cycle index to change independent of any other trigger event. For example, when the battery<br>
is low, it may be advantageous to always lower slot cycle index regardless of the other trigger<br>
events. Similarly, when system loading is high, it may be advantageous to always lower slot<br>
cycle index. However, it is important to note that these are only possible examples. In other<br>
cases these examples may not apply. In some cases slot cycle index may be increased or kept the<br>
same when the battery is low or system loading is high.<br>
In another example, in some cases it may be advantageous to allow one device to dictate<br>
slot cycle index to another. For example, perhaps it would be advantageous to not allow a<br>
mobile handset to refuse a request to lower slot cycle index. In this example, assume that system<br>
loading is high. A base station that is communicating with a mobile station sends a request, or in<br>
this case, perhaps it can be considered a command, to operate in a lower slot cycle index. In this<br>
example, the mobile handset is required to operate in the lower slot cycle index. It again should<br>
be stressed that these are only examples. Other examples are possible. It will be clear to those<br>
of skill in the art that specific trigger events, specific "weightings" for trigger events, specific<br>
combinations of trigger events, and specific ways to negotiate dynamic slot cycle index can be<br>
determined based on the needs of a particular implementation. Many different possibilities will<br>
be clear to those of skill in the art. For brevity, only a few examples are shown here.<br>
Advantages may include the ability to lower power used to transmit between the mobile handset<br>
280 and the base station 330. This may be especially important when the battery on the mobile<br>
handset 280 is low.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 9, a diagram 400 will be discussed. The diagram 400 includes a<br>
graph of a clock signal 402. The clock signal 402 is a reference for timing of transmissions<br>
between a base station 330 and a mobile handset 280. For example, the base station 330 and the<br>
mobile handset 280 of FIG. 8. A graph 404 of a dynamic slot cycle is also shown on the diagram<br>
400. The graph includes a period of time when the handset 280 operates in slot cycle 1 406.<br><br><br>
c<br>
After a trigger event 412 the mobile handset 280 operates in slot cycle 0 for a period of time.<br>
Another trigger event occurs at 419. The trigger event 419 is a trigger event that causes a<br>
decrease in slot cycle index. After 419 the mobile handset returns to slot cycle 1. FIG. 9 is only<br>
one possible example, other examples are possible. Changes in slot cycle can occur other than<br>
just changing from slot cycle 0 to slot cycle 1. For example mobile handset could change from<br>
slot cycle 2 to slot cycle 4. Slot cycle could be changed by multiple slot cycles in a single<br>
change, for example, as stated above, from slot cycle 2 to slot cycle 4.<br>
As stated above changes in slot cycle could be based a combination of trigger events. For<br>
example, the trigger events could be combined in the form of a function. Additionally, the<br>
combination of trigger events could be weighted differently. Some trigger events could be<br>
considered more important than others. The trigger events could be combined in the form of a<br>
function. For example, slot cycle change could be a function of battery power available, system<br>
loading, and location.<br>
In one example battery power could be considered more important than the other two<br>
trigger events. In this example battery power could be given more weight in a function the<br>
determines if a trigger event should occur.<br>
Additionally, these trigger events could be continuously monitored. In another example<br>
the trigger events can be monitored continually. In yet another example, the trigger events could<br>
be monitored only when one or more trigger events change. It will be clear to those of skill in<br>
the art that this is only an example, other examples, using other trigger events, or other<br>
combinations of trigger events are possible. Advantages include the ability to change slot cycle<br>
based on the conditions during a specific time period.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 10 a diagram 475 is shown. The diagram 475 generally shows the<br>
relationship between a network 480, a base station 482, a mobile handset 485, and services 489.<br>
On the diagram under base station 482 location, system load, and feature availability are listed.<br>
These trigger events are typically associated with the base station 482, however, other groupings<br>
are possible. For example, feature availability is listed under both base station 482 and handset<br>
485. Additionally, if the handset could determine system loading, then system loading could be<br>
listed under handset 485. However, handsets do not typically have access to system loading<br><br><br>
i<br>
' information, so system loading information , so system loading has not been included under<br>
handset 485. The diagram is meant to be general and to show typical groups of trigger events<br>
and what devices tend to monitor for those trigger events. But, as can be seen above, the lists are<br>
not exhaustive.<br>
The section for handset 485 includes a list of trigger events such as power, time of day,<br>
and feature availability. As stated above, the list is intended to be an example. The list is not<br>
intended to be exhaustive. Other trigger events are possible. Additionally, trigger events could<br>
occur related to headings such as base station 482, handset 485, and service 489 in ways not<br>
shown on FIG. 10. For example, if a base station 482 is able to determine battery power<br>
available then power could be listed under base station 482 above. However, since typically, the<br>
base station 482 does not know the battery power available to a mobile handset 485, power is not<br>
listed under base station 482.<br>
As stated above, FIG. 10 also includes service 489. Service 489 includes priority service.<br>
In some cases a customer may pay extra for faster call completion typically brought about by<br>
higher slot cycle index. In other cases the service may be a part of other prepackaged services.<br>
Advantages may include the increased revenue due to the ability to charge some customers for<br>
typically faster call completion. However, in some cases the service may be included with<br>
specific calling plans.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 11 a diagram 550 is shown. The diagram 550 is similar to the<br>
diagram 400 of FIG. 9. However, the diagram 550 shows several possible slot cycle priorities<br>
559, 562, 568, 571 and indicates that a mobile handset can switch between the different<br>
priorities. Using the diagram 550, the different slot cycle priorities 559, 562, 568, 571 can easily<br>
be compared. It can be seen from the diagram 550 that the higher the slot cycle index, the more<br>
often the mobile station communicates with the base station. It should be noted that higher slot<br>
cycle index is indicated by a lower slot cycle number. For example slot cycle 0 is a higher slot<br>
cycle index than slot cycle 1. The ability to dynamically change between slot cycle priorities has<br>
many advantages, as discussed above. Dynamically changing slot cycle index typically allows a<br>
mobile handset to operate more efficiently and in some cases adapt to the current state of the<br>
handset, the network, or the service purchased.<br><br><br><br>
Many examples are discussed above. However, these are only examples. Other<br>
examples are possible. Additionally, many advantages are discussed above. However, these are<br>
only possible advantages. Advantages may vary from one specific implementation to the next.<br>
Additionally, some advantages may be an important aspect of one implementation while<br>
unimportant or possibly not included in another. Embodiments should only be limited by the<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
A MOBILE HANDSET FOR MANAGING A SLOT<br>
CYCLE INDEX AND A BASE STATION<br>
A slot cycle index in a mobile wireless network (375) is managed by a mobile handset<br>
(280) and a base station (330). The mobile handset (280) determines (204, 229) that a mobile<br>
handset trigger event has occurred, and evaluates (206, 232) the mobile handset trigger event.<br>
Next the mobile handset (280) determines (209, 234) that a request for a slot cycle index change<br>
should occur based on the evaluation of the mobile handset trigger event. The mobile handset<br>
(280) requests (212, 240) the slot cycle index change from a base station (330) of the mobile<br>
wireless network in response to the evaluation of the mobile handset trigger event and the<br>
determination that the request should occur. The base station (330) receives (106) the request<br>
and negotiates (109) the slot cycle index based upon the mobile handset trigger event and a<br>
current trigger event of the base station. The base station (330) sends (113) the negotiated<br>
different slot cycle index to the mobile handset (280).</td>
