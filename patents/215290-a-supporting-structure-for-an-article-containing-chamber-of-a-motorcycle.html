				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an article containing chamber supporting structure for a motorcycle provided with an article containing chamber under a seat.<br>
[Related Art]<br>
A structure provided with an article containing chamber such as a helmet containing box under a seat has been exemplified by a number of motorcycles of a swing unit type in which an internal combustion engine and a rear wheel are unified by means of a power transmission case and the integral unit is swingably supported by a vehicular body.<br>
On example of such a structure disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 2-6284, in which the structure is applied to a motorcycle 01, is shown in Fig. 6.<br>
A body frame 02 of the motorcycle 01 includes one main frame 04 composed of a round pipe having a relatively large diameter, the main frame 04 extending rearward,<br>
obliquely downward from a head pipe 03; and one rear frame 05 composed of a rectangular pipe, the rear frame 05 extending obliquely upward along a gentle curve from a rear end of the main frame 04.<br>
A swing unit case 06 vertically swingably disposed under the body frame 02 is configured such that an internal combustion engine 07 on the front side of the case 06 is integrated with a rear wheel 09 rotatably supported at a rear end of the case 06 via a power transmission portion 08 at a central portion of the case 06.  An upper portion of a crank case of the internal combustion engine 07 is pivotably supported by a pivot 010 provided near the rear end of the main frame 04.  A rear cushion Oil is interposed between the rear end of the case 06 at which the rear wheel 09 is rotatably supported and the rear frame 05 positioned over the rear end of the case 06.<br>
A helmet containing chamber 012 is supported on both a rear portion of the main frame 04 and the rear frame 05.  A seat 013 is provided on the helmet containing chamber 012 with its front end pivotably supported to openably cover an upper opening of the helmet containing chamber 012.<br>
The helmet containing chamber 012 is mounted such that a front portion of a bottom wall thereof is mounted via a rubber mount 015 on the rear portion of the main frame 04 and an upper portion of a rear wall thereof is mounted via a rubber mount 016 on a bracket 05a provided on an upper end portion of the rear frame 05.<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Since the body frame 02 for supporting the helmet containing chamber 012 has a structure in which the front end of one rear frame 05 is connected at approximately right angles to the rear end of one main frame 04, it is difficult to ensure a sufficient rigidity of the entire body frame.<br>
Since the helmet containing chamber 012 is supported on both the main frame 04 and the rear frame 05, it is difficult to obtain a high supporting rigidity of the helmet containing chamber 012.<br>
On the lower side from the central portion of the body frame 02 at which the helmet containing chamber 012 is supported, the pivotably supporting portion (pivot 010) and<br>
the power transmission portion 08 of the swing unit case 06 are vertically swung. Accordingly, the rear portion of the main frame 04 is located at a relatively high position for preventing interference with the swing motion of the pivot 010 and the power transmission portion 08, and correspondingly the helmet containing chamber 012 with its bottom wall mounted on the rear portion of the main frame 04 is located at a high position.<br>
Since the helmet containing chamber 012 requires a large volume enough to contain a helmet and such a large sized helmet containing chamber 012 is located at a high position of the body, the seat 013 supported thereon is correspondingly located at a high position.  As a result, it is difficult to locate the seat 013 at a suitable height of the body.<br>
In view of the foregoing, the present invention has been made, and an object of the present invention is to provide an article containing chamber supporting structure for a motorcycle, which is capable of improving a rigidity of the entire body frame as well as a supporting rigidity of the article containing chamber, ensuring a sufficient volume of the article containing chamber, and easily<br>
setting a seat at a suitable height.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem, and Function and Effect]<br>
To achieve the above object, according to an invention described in claim 1 , there is provided an article containing chamber supporting structure for a motorcycle provided with an article containing chamber under a seat, characterized in that a body frame is provided, the body frame including a main frame extending rearward, obliquely downward from a head pipe; and a pair of right and left rear frames branching rightward and leftward from an intermediate portion of the main frame, extending rearward substantially in the horizontal direction, and rising obliquely upward; an internal combustion engine is suspendedly provided under the main frame; and the article containing chamber is supported on the rear frames.<br>
Since the body frame is configured such that at least one main frame extends rearward, obliquely downward from a head pipe, and the pair of right and left rear frames branch rightward and leftward from an intermediate portion of the main frame and extend rearward substantially in the horizontal direction, the rigidity of the entire<br>
body frame can be improved .<br>
Since the article containing chamber is supported on the pair of rear frames, the supporting rigidity of the article containing chamber can be sufficiently ensured.<br>
The motorcycle described in this invention, which is configured such that the internal combustion engine is suspendedly provided under the main frame and is separated from the power transmission system and is not swung, is different from a so-called swing unit type.  Accordingly, since the lower side from the central portion of the body frame at which the article containing chamber is supported is not required to avoid interference with the swing motion of the swing unit case, the article containing chamber can be supported at a relatively low position.<br>
As a result, it is possible to sufficiently ensure the volume of the article containing chamber and to set the seat supported thereon at a suitable height.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 2 , in addition to the configuration of the article containing chamber supporting structure for a motorcycle described in claim 1, a rear end of the main frame is connected to rear ends of substantially horizontally extending portions of<br>
the rear frames by a connecting member.<br>
With the simple structure provided with only the connecting member, the rear portion of the main frame, the horizontal portion of each rear frame, and the connecting member form three sides of a triangle in a side view, to further improve the rigidity of the entire body frame.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 3, in addition to the configuration of the article containing chamber supporting structure for a motorcycle described in claim 1 or 2, a rear fork pivot for pivotably supporting a front end of a rear fork is provided at a lower portion of the rear end of the main frame; and a recess with the rear portion of the main frame taken as a bottom side thereof is formed between the horizontal portions of the pair of right and left rear frames.<br>
The recess, which is formed between the horizontal portions of the pair of right and left rear frames with the rear portion of the main frame taken as the tilting bottom side of the recess, is allowed to ensure a sufficient space even excluding a portion interfering with a swing motion of the rear fork pivotably supported by the lower portion of<br>
he rear end of the main frame.  Such a recess can be used as a space in which an article storing chamber is to be arranged.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 4, in addition to the configuration of the article containing chamber supporting structure for a motorcycle described in claim 3, a lower portion of the article containing chamber is swelled in the recess.<br>
The article containing chamber can be set at a low position with the volume of the article containing chamber sufficiently ensured, and the seat supported thereon can be set at a suitable height.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 5, in addition to the configuration of the article containing chamber supporting structure for a motorcycle described in any one of claims 1 to 4, the seat pivotably mounted at a front edge of the article containing chamber is supported by the article containing chamber in such a manner as to openably cover the article containing chamber; and the article containing chamber is elastically supported, at front and rear portions of its bottom wall and an upper portion of its rear wall, by the body frame.<br>
Since the article containing chamber for supporting the seat is elastically supported, at the front and rear portions of its bottom wall and the upper portion of its rear wall, by the body frame, it is possible to certainly support the article containing chamber and also to suppress vibration of the body from being transmitted to the article containing chamber and the seat.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 6, in addition to the configuration of the article containing chamber supporting structure for a motorcycle described in any one of claims 1 to 5, the article containing chamber is a helmet containing box.<br>
The helmet containing box having a large volume enough to contain a helmet can be supported on the rear frames with a high supporting rigidity and also the seat supported therein can be set at a suitable height.<br>
The present invention relates to an arotherall casbvl and by<br>
chaainber of supporting   structure   for   a   motorcycle   provided   with   an article<br><br>
containing chamber under a seat, characterized in that a body frame is provided, said body frame comprising a main frame extending rearward, obliquely downward from a head pipe; and a pair of right and left rear frames branching rightward and leftward from an intermediate portion of said main frame, extending rearward in the horizontal direction, and rising obliquely upward; an internal combustion engine is suspendedly provided under said main frame; and said article containing chamber is supported on said rear frames.<br>

[Embodiment of the Invention]  <br>
Hereinafter, one embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 5, Fig. 1 is a general side view of a motorcycle 1<br><br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention; Fig. 2 is a general side view of a body frame 2; and Fig. 3 is a plan view of the body frame 2.<br>
One round pipe shaped main frame 4 extends rearward, obliquely downward from a head pipe 3. A pair of right and left rear frames 5 branch from an intermediate portion of the main frame 4 in such a manner as to be symmetric on the right and left sides with respect to the main frame 4, extending rearward substantially in the horizontal direction, and rise obliquely upward.  The main frame 4 and the rear frames 5 constitute the body frame 2.<br>
Accordingly, as shown by the side view of Fig. 2, the body frame 2 is configured such that a main frame front portion 4a tilting downward is continuous, via each rear frame horizontal portion 5a extending substantially in the horizontal direction, to each rear frame tilting portion 5b tilting upward.  That is to say, the body frame 2 is formed into such a shape that an approximately central portion thereof is curved downward in a side view, so that the rigidity of the entire body frame becomes high.<br>
A main frame rear portion 4b projects downward from the rear frame horizontal portions 5a.<br>
A connecting corner between the head pipe 3 and the main pipe 4 is reinforced by a gusset 6.  A cross-plate 7, formed into a triangular shape in a plan view, is mounted across front end portions, branched from the main frame 4, of the pair of right and left rear frames 5. A cross-pipe 8 is mounted across boundaries between the rear frame horizontal portions 5a and the rear frame tilting portions 5b.  A cross-pipe 9 is mounted across rear ends of the rear frame tilting portions 5b.  A rear sub-frame 10, U-shaped in a plan view, is connected between the rear ends of the right and left rear frame tilting portions 5b in such a manner as to extend rearward in a horizontal posture.<br>
A connecting corner between each rear frame tilting portion 5b and each end of the rear sub-frame 10 is reinforced by a gusset 11.<br>
A pair of pivot plates 12, symmetric on the right and left sides with respect to the main frame rear portion 4b, are welded at upper edges thereof to the main frame rear portion 4b in such a manner as to extend downward while slightly spreading right and left.  Rear portions of the upper edges of the pivot plates 12, welded to the main frame rear portion 4b, curve obliquely upward to be<br>
continuous to connecting portions 13 which are U-shaped in cross-section. Upper ends of the connecting portions 13 are welded to the above-described cross-pipe 8, to thus reinforcingly connect the rear end of the main pipe 4 to the cross-pipe 8 mounted across the right and left rear frames 5.<br>
Accordingly, as shown by the side view of Fig. 2, each of the rear frame horizontal portions 5a, the main frame rear portion 4b, and each of the connecting portions 13 form three sides of a triangle, to improve the rigidity of the entire body frame 2.<br>
Between the right and left rear frame horizontal portions 5a is formed a recess 15 having a doglegged bottom face in a side view.  To be more specific, as shown in Fig. 2, the portions, tilted downward along the main frame rear portion 4b, of the pivot plates 12 are taken as one side (front side in Fig. 2) of the doglegged bottom face of the recess 15; and the upper surfaces, tilted upward, that is, reversely to the downward tilting of the above portions of the pivot plates 12, of the connecting portions 13 are taken as the other side (rear side in Fig. 2) of the doglegged bottom face of the recess 15.<br>
The body frame 2 having the above configuration is provided with various brackets and gussets: engine mount brackets 16 are suspended from front sides of the rear frame horizontal portions 5a; gussets 17 are fixed at corners between the rear frame horizontal portions 5a and the rear frame tilting portions 5b; supporting brackets 18 are projectingly provided on the right and left sides of the cross-pipe 8; supporting brackets 19, extending longer horizontally in the longitudinal direction, are mounted on the connecting portions between the upper ends of the rear frame tilting portions 5b and both the ends of the rear sub-frame 10; a supporting bracket 20, extending right and left, is projectingly provided at a rear central portion of the rear sub-frame 10; and a pair of supporting brackets 21 are projectingly provided on the right and the left sides from the supporting bracket 20.<br>
A front wheel 26 is rotatably supported at a lower end of a front fork 25 turnably supported by the front head pipe 3 of the body frame 2.  A handlebar 27 extending right and left is mounted at an upper portion of the upward extension of the front fork 25.<br>
A bearing 12a is mounted across the pair of right<br>
nd left pivot plates 12 suspended from the main frame rear portion 4b at a position near the lower portion of the rear end of the main frame rear portion 4b.  Rear forks 29 extend rearward with front ends thereof pivotably supported by right and left ends of a pivot 28 passing through the bearing 12a.  The rear forks 29 allow a rear wheel 30 rotatably supported at rear ends of the rear forks 29 to be vertically swingable.  A rear cushion 31 is interposed between the rear end of the rear fork 29 and the gusset 11 provided on the upper end of the rear frame tilting portion 5b positioned over the rear end of the rear fork 29.<br>
An internal combustion engine 34 is provided under the main frame rear portion 4b in such a manner as to be suspended from both a supporting shaft 32 passing through the engine mount brackets 16 hung from the rear frame horizontal portions 5a and a supporting shaft 33 passing through the pivot plates 12 hung from the main frame rear portion 4b.<br>
The internal combustion engine 34 is of a four¬cycle/one-cylinder type in which a cylinder 34b projects from a crank case 34a in such a manner as to be tilted forward up to an approximately horizontal posture.<br>
A carburetor 35 is disposed over a cylinder head 34c of the internal combustion engine 34, and an intake pipe 36 extending from an upper portion of the cylinder head 34c is connected to the carburetor 35.  An air cleaner 37 extending right and left across the main frame 4 is disposed over the carburetor 35, and is connected to the carburetor 35 through a connecting pipe 38.<br>
A battery 39 is disposed over the air cleaner 37 and on the right side from the head pipe 3.<br>
An exhaust pipe 45 extends from a lower portion of the cylinder head 34c.  The exhaust pipe 45 curves downward, extending rearward substantially in the horizontal direction on the right side of the vehicular body, and is connected to a muffler 46 disposed on the right side from the rear wheel 30.<br>
A fuel tank 40, formed into an approximately rectangular parallelepiped shape, is supported in the U-shaped rear sub-frame 10 connected to the rear ends of the rear frames 5.<br>
The fuel tank 40 is composed of upper and lower box-like halves which are integrated with each other at a seam portion 40a taken as a mating face.  The seam portion<br>
40a projects from outer peripheries of four side walls on the front, rear, right, and left sides.<br>
An oil filler port 40b projects from a rear central portion of an upper wall of the fuel tank 40, and is closed by a lid 41.  A fuel level gauge 42 projects slightly upward from a front portion of the upper wall of the fuel tank 40.<br>
The lower half of the fuel tank 40 is inserted from the upper side into the U-shaped rear sub-frame 10.  At this time, front sections of the right and left seam portions 40a are brought in contact with and supported by the right and left supporting brackets 19, and a central section of the rear seam portion 40a is brought in contact with and supported by the supporting bracket 20.<br>
The rear seam portion 40a is directly rigidly fastened to the supporting bracket 20 with a bolt 43 and a nut 44.<br>
A helmet containing box 50 is supported on the rear frames 5.<br>
The helmet containing box 50 has an approximately rectangular upper opening; four side walls 50a on the front, rear, right, and left sides; and a bottom wall<br>
extending downward from the side walls 50a.  The bottom wall, composed of a front side tilting bottom wall 50b and a rear side tilting bottom wall 50c, is taperingly swelled in a side view. An upper end of the rear side wall 50a extends rearward to form a hood 51.<br>
The hood 51 has a central portion 51a and right and left side walls.  The central portion 51a is swelled upward in an approximately rectangular shape to cover the front portion of the fuel tank 40 from the upper side and is opened on the lower and rear sides.  Lower ends of the right and left side walls of the hood 51 extend outward to form horizontal flanges 51b.<br>
The hood 51, which covers the front portion of the fuel tank 40, prevents permeation of fuel leaked upon fueling or the like into the helmet containing box 50.<br>
An upper central portion of the front side wall 50a of the helmet containing box 50 extends forward, and has a bearing 52 formed at its front end.<br>
The taperingly swelled bottom wall of the helmet containing box 50 has mounting portions 53 and 54 each of which is recessed downward.  Specifically, the mounting<br>
portions 53 are formed on the right and left sides of a front portion of the front side tilting bottom wall 50b, and the mounting portions 54 are formed on the right and left sides of a central portion of the rear side tilting bottom wall 50c.  A shallow recess 55 for containing a tool is formed over the mounting portions 54.<br>
A helmet 80 of a full face type is inserted in the helmet containing box 50.  At this time, a jaw portion 80a is put at the leading edge, and an opening portion 80b through which the helmet 80 is to be put on or taken off from a head is tilted along the rear side tilting bottom wall 50c.  Thus, as shown in Fig. 4, the helmet 80 is contained in the helmet containing portion 50 in such a state that the jaw portion 80a directed downward is inserted in the taperingly swelled recess of the bottom wall.<br>
The helmet containing box 50 is mounted on the rear frames 5 in the following manner.  The taperingly swelled bottom wall is inserted in the recess 15 formed between the right and left rear frame horizontal portions 5a in such a manner that the hood 51 covers the front portion of the fuel tank 40 (note: a central portion of the hood 51 has an<br>
opening through which the upper portion of the fuel level gauge 42 projects).  The right and left recessed mounting portions 53 of the front side tilting bottom wall 50b are placed via mount rubbers 56 on specific mounting portions of the cross-plate 7; the right and left recessed mounting portions 54 of the rear side tilting bottom wall 50c are placed via mount rubbers 57 on the supporting brackets 18 projectingly provided on the cross-pipe 8; and the right and left flanges 51b of the hood 51 are placed via mount rubbers 58 on the seam portions 40a of the fuel tank 40 supported by the right and left supporting brackets 19.<br>
Cylindrical collars 60, 61, and 62 pass through the mounting portions 53 and 54 and flanges 51b and also through the mount rubbers 56, 57 and 58, and lower ends of the collars 60, 61 and 62 are brought in contact with the cross-plate 7, supporting brackets 18, and seam portions 40a of the fuel tank 40 via washers, respectively.  Bolts 63, 64 and 65 are inserted from the upper side into the collars 60, 61 and 62 via washers, and leading ends of the bolts 63, 64 and 65 having passed through the cross-plate 7, supporting brackets 18, and seam portions 40a and supporting brackets 19 are screwed with nuts 66, 67 and 68, respectively.<br>
In this way, the helmet containing box 50 is mounted on the rear frames 5 with the bolts 63, 64 and 65 and nuts 66, 67 and 68 in such a manner that the right and left sides of the front portion of the bottom wall 50b, the right and left sides of the central portion of the bottom wall 50c, and the right and left sides of the hood 51 are elastically supported on the rear frames 5 via the mount rubbers 56, 57 and 58, respectively.<br>
The right and left flanges 51b of the hood 51 of the helmet containing box 50 are co-fastened, by means of the bolts 65 and nuts 68, via the collars 62 to the supporting brackets 19 together with the seam portions 40a of the fuel tank 40.<br>
This is effective to reduce the number of parts and to make easy the assembly of the helmet containing box 50.<br>
A tandem seat 70 extending longer in the<br>
longitudinal direction is provided to cover upper sides of the helmet containing box 50 and the fuel tank 40.<br>
The tandem seat 70 has a bottom plate 71 on which a cushion material 72 is provided.  The bottom plate 71 is composed of a driver's seat side front half 71a functioning<br><br>
as a lid for closing an opening of the helmet containing box 50, and a passenger's seat side rear half 71b for covering the upper side of the fuel tank 40.<br>
A bracket 73 projectingly provided on a front portion of the bottom plate 71 is pivotably supported, via a supporting shaft 74, by a bearing 52 projecting from an upper central portion of the front side wall 50a of the helmet containing box 50, so that the tandem seat 70 is vertically swingable to open/close the helmet containing box 50.<br>
Two supporting rubbers 75 are fixed on a lower surface of the rear half 71b of the bottom plate 71 at positions slightly offset rearward from the center of the rear half 71b in such a manner as to be spaced right and left for preventing interference with the lid 41 of the oil filler port of the fuel tank 40.  When the tandem seat 70 is swung downward to close the helmet containing box 50, the supporting rubbers 75 is in contact with the upper surface of the fuel tank 40 to elastically support the rear portion of the tandem seat 70.<br>
As described above, the tandem seat 70 is<br><br>
configured such that the front end thereof is pivotably supported by the front end of the helmet containing box 50 via the supporting shaft 74, and the rear portion thereof is elastically supported on the fuel tank 40 via the supporting rubbers 75.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a seat locking device 77 is mounted on the pair of right and left supporting brackets 21 projectingly provided on the rear portion of the rear sub-frame 10 to be locked with a U-shaped lock pin 76 suspended from a rear end portion of the bottom plate 71 of the tandem seat 70.<br>
Since the helmet containing box 50 is elastically supported on the rear frames 5 via the mount rubbers 56, 57 and 58, vibration of the body frame 2 is absorbed by the mount rubbers 56, 57 and 58 and the supporting rubbers 75, and consequently, transmission of vibration from the body frame 2 to the tandem seat 70 supported on the helmet containing box 50 is suppressed, to thereby improve the riding comfort.<br>
The helmet containing box 50 is, as described above, supported by the pair of rear frames 5 such that the right and left sides of the front portion of the bottom<br>
wall 50b, the right and left of the central portion of the bottom wall 50c, and the right and left sides of the hood extending rearward are mounted on the pair of rear frames 5, so that the supporting rigidity of the helmet containing box 50 becomes high.<br>
Since the internal combustion engine 34 is suspendedly mounted under the main frame 4 and the rear fork 29 for supporting the rear wheel 30 is pivotably supported by the pivot 28 mounted to the pivot plates 12 provided at the lower end of the main frame 4, it is possible to ensure a space to form the recess 15 under and between the right and left rear frame horizontal portions 5a, and hence to set the large-sized helmet containing box 50 having a large volume at a relatively low position by inserting the taperingly swelled bottom portion of the helmet containing box 50 in the recess 15.<br>
Further, since the helmet containing box 50 can be set at a low position with the volume thereof sufficiently ensured, the tandem seat 70 supported on the helmet containing box 50 can be set at a suitable height.<br>
In addition, when the helmet 80 is contained in the<br><br>
helmet containing box 50 as described above and the helmet containing box 50 is covered with the tandem seat 70, the cushion material 72 swelled through an opening provided in the front half 7la functioning as the lid of the bottom plate 71 presses down a rear head portion of the helmet 80, to thus fix the helmet 80.<br>
