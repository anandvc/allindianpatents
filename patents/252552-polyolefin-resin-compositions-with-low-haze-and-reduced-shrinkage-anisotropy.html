PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Field of invention<br>
The invention relates to a polyolefin resin composition having low haze and reduced shrinkage anisotropy. The invention also relates to a method for preparing the composition and to the articles prepared thereof.<br>
Background<br>
Polyolefins are used in a variety of applications that require enhanced physical and optical properties. In many such applications, the polyolefin is required to be resistant to warpage and need to have high clarity. Resistance to warpage is largely determined by the shrinkage anisotropy values (measured as the ratio of shrinkage in the machine direction to the shrinkage in the transverse direction) of the polyolefin while the clarity of the polyolefin is determined by the values of percentage haze. Conventionally, nucleating agents are used to reduce the haze or the shrinkage anisotropy. However, the conventional nucleating agents, especially, those nucleating agents which are used for reducing shrinkage anisotropy, are expensive. In comparison, nanoclays are less expensive and are also known to act as nucleating agents in polyolefin compositions at loadings higher than 50000 ppm. At such loadings of nanoclay, however, the haze of polyolefin compositions tend to increase. There is a need for polyolefin resin compositions having a combination of low haze and shrinkage anisotropy.<br>
Detailed description<br>

6<br><br>
The examples of polyolefins used to prepare the compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to, homo polymers and random copolymers of olefins. The nanoclays suitable for preparing composition of the invention include, but are not limited to montmorillonite, bentonite, kaolinite, hectorite, fluorohectorite, saponite, beidelite, nontronite, stevensite, vermiculite, hallosite, volkonskoite, suconite, magadite, and kenyalite. The nanoclay used for preparing the compositions of the invention is usually organically modified. The examples of organic modifiers include, but are not limited modifiers having the formula: +N*R1R2R3R4 wherein:<br>
R1, R2, R3 and R4 are independently selected from a group consisting of a saturated or unsaturated C1 to C22 hydrocarbon, substituted hydrocarbon and branched hydrocarbon. Examples of groups represented by R1, R2, R3 and R4 include saturated or unsaturated alkyls, including alkylenes; substituted alkyls such as hydroxyalkyls, alkoxyalkyl, alkoxys, amino alkyls, acid alkyls, halogenated alkyls, sulfonated alkyls, nitrated alkyls and the like; branched alkyls; aryls and substituted aryls, such as alkylaryls, alkoxyaryls, alkylhydroxyaryls, alkylalkoxyaryls and the like. Optionally, one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is hydrogen.<br>
The nucleating agents used for preparing the compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to organic clarifying agents and inorganic salts of organic acids. The examples of organic clarifying agents include, but are not limited to amides, acetals, alcohols, polynuclear aromatics and organic gelator molecules. The examples of salts of organic acids used as nucleating agents in the composition of the invention include<br>
7<br><br>
carboxylic acid salts, sulphonic acid salts, phosphoric acid salts, sulphinic acid salts, phosphinic acid salts and the like. When an inorganic salt of an organic acid is used as the nucleating agent, polyolefin compositions having a haze less than 16% measured using a polyolefin plaque having a thickness of 1mm and a haze less than 34% measured using a polyolefin plaque having a thickness of 2mm are formed. When an organic clarifying agent is used as the nucleating agent polyolefin compositions having haze less than 10% measured using a polyolefin plaque having a thickness of 1mm and a haze less than 24% measured using a polyolefin plaque having a thickness of 2 mm are formed.<br>
The invention provides polyolefin resin compositions comprising minimal amount of conventional nucleating agent and selected amount of organically modified nanoclay. It is surprisingly observed that at low loadings of nanoclay and nucleating agent, the properties of polyolefin are synergistically improved. Particularly, the polyolefin haze is kept low and the shrinkage anisotropy is reduced to the desirable range. Thus the compositions of the invention enable to provide clarified polyolefins having reduced warpage at significantly low cost.<br>
In the experiment/results that follow, the percentage haze was determined by standard ASTM D1003  method.  Glass transition temperature was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Flexural modulus is measured by standard ASTM D790 method. Shrinkage anisotropy was determined from injection molded ISO D2 plaques. Melt flow index (MFI) was determined by standard ASTM D1238 method.<br>
8<br><br>
The invention is further illustrated by way of the following example.<br>
Example 1 Calculated amount of tetra alkyl ammonium modified montmorillonite and the conventional nucleating / clarifying agents are added separately to a stock of PPRCP (polypropylene random copolymer with 3% ethylene content in the backbone), fluff (powder from the reactor) of MFI 12.00 dg/min stabilized with the appropriate commercial stabilizer package. Whenever required, appropriate amounts of maleic anhydride-grafted PP (compatibilizer between PP and nanoclay) are added optionally to the formulations. The powder formulations as described above are tumbled for 15 - 30 min for uniform physical mixing followed by compounding and molding like PPRCP with a conventional nucleating or clarifying agent. The compositions prepared as above are injection molded into plaques of desired thickness in order to measure the various parameters. The properties of the different polypropylene compositions comprising varying amounts of nucleating agents and nanoclay are displayed in table 1.<br>

From table 1, it is clear that polypropylene compositions of the invention have a low haze value, the haze value being comparable to that of the polypropylene composition having 2000 ppm of nucleating agent alone. Therefore, in the compositions of the invention the<br>
10<br><br>
organically modified nano-clay replaces the nucleating agent retaining the haze (as evident from column 3 of table 1). Such retention of the haze value on addition of the nano-clay, is indicative of the synergy displayed by the nanoclay and the nucleating agent in the compositions of the invention. Nanoclay is known to deteriorate the haze and consequently an increase in the haze value was expected upon removal of nucleating agent and compensating the removal by the addition of an organically modified nano-clay. The synergy is further illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 show the variation of haze value with addition of NA-21 as the nucleating agent independently (represented by the variation described as NA-21 alone) as well as by replacing the nano-clay (represented by the variation described as NA-21 with (2000-x) ppm of NC). Figure 2 show the variation of haze value with addition of M3988 as the nucleating agent independently (represented by the variation described as M3988 alone) as well as by replacing the nano-clay (represented by the variation described as M3988 with (2000-x) ppm of NC). A steep decrease in haze value is observed by the independent addition of nucleating agent from an amount of 500 ppm to 2000 ppm to the polypropylene resin. Therefore a steep increase of haze was expected for a composition where the nucleating agent is replaced by the nano-clay (NC). However, in the case of both the nucleating agents , namely, NA-21 and M3988, the haze value is retained when the nucleating agent is replaced, in the same quantity, by a nano-clay. The observed retention of haze value of polypropylene containing nano-clay as well as the nucleating agent (in amounts ranging from 500 to 1500 ppm) compared to the polypropylene containing the nucleating agent alone, is advantageous and renders the polyolefin compositions cost efficient. Further, the compositions of the invention provide<br>
11<br><br>
polyolefin having reduction in shrinkage anisotropy, the shrinkage anisotropy values being close to unity. The reduction in shrinkage anisotropy measures reduction in warpage and the reduction in warpage results in lesser rejects in the molded parts at a molder's site. Consequently, efficiency of molding operations as well as quality of the polyoefin products are improved. Further, the reduced Tm - Tc values for the composition of the invention suggests efficient nucleation that results in faster crystallization which in turn increases the productivity of the polyolefin product. Furthermore, from table 1 it is clear that the MFI, flexural modulus, melting point and crystallization temperature of the polyolefin is not significantly affected indicating that no significant structural or chemical changes have occurred and that the rheological and mechanical properties of the polyolefin are not affected by the addition of nucleating agent and nanoclay.<br>
