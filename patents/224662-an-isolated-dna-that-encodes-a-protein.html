The present invention relates to an isolated DNA that encodes a protein participating in fungal cell wall synthesis, proteins encoded by the DNAs.<br>
In recent years, management of opportunistic infections are gaining importance more than ever due to an increase in the number of elderly people and immunocompromised patients as a result of advanced chemotherapies, etc. Deep-seated mycosis due to Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptocoqcus, and such, account for a portion of such opportunistic infections, and the proportion is increasing year after year. The fact that opportunistic infections by many avirulent bacteria occur one after another, shows that the problem of infectious diseases will not end as long as there are underlying diseases that diminish the immune functions of patients. Although new strategies for infectious diseases control, including the problem of resistant bacteria, will be one of the crucial issues in the soon-to-come aged society, extremely few effective therapeutic agents exist at present.<br>
Up to now, therapeutic agents for fungal infections were developed based mainly on the strategy of creating novel compounds by chemically modifying known structure. However, due to problems such as the emergence of resistant bacteria, the development of new drugs based on new mechanisms is eagerly anticipated.<br>
Considering such circumstances, the inventors focused on a novel approach in the area of antifungal agents in which the variety of therapeutic agents is still insufficient. Namely, the present inventors concentrated on influencing the onset, progress, and<br><br>
persistence of infections by preventing pathogens from showing pathogenicity. In order to avoid the establishment and progress of infection, the inventors thought that the most effective way would be to inhibit the adhesion onto the host, which is the first step in the establishment of infection, and the subsequent progression of colonization. In addition, a new unprecedented approach, namely, the inhibition of the expression of adhesion factors themselves, was also carried out.<br>
In order to inhibit the expression of adhesion factors, the present inventors directed their attention to the hypothesis that cell wall glycoproteins such as adhesion factors are first GPI (Glycosylphosphatidylinositol)-anchored to the cell membrane, and then transported to the cell wall (Fig. 1) . To date, 30 or more cell wall glycoproteins including adhesion ligands have been found to be transported via GPI-anchoring (referred to as GPI-anchored proteins) . Hence, it was thought that if this transport step is inhibited, it may be quite possible to inhibit the expression of adhesion factors and major cell wall-constituting proteins at the cell wall (Hamada Ketal, Mol. Gen. Genet., 258: 53-59, 1998). GPI-anchored proteins have been reported to be present in Candida, which is a pathogenic fungi (Kapteyn JC et al, Eur. J. Cell Biol., 65:402-407, 1994).<br>
The inventors initiated their research believing that novel antifungal agents that inhibit cell wall synthesis can be produced by inhibiting the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins existing in the cell membrane of a fungus to the cell wall.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An objective of this invention is to develop antifungal agents showing effects against the onset, progress, and persistence of infections by inhibiting the expression of cell wall glycoproteins, inhibiting the cell wall assembly and also adhesion onto cells, and preventing pathogens from showing pathogenicity.<br>
In order to screen for compounds that inhibit the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall, the present inventors produced a reporter system that uses a fusion protein comprising a reporter enzyme and a transport signal existing in the<br><br>
C-terminus of one of the GPI-anchored proteins, CWP2 (Van Der Vaat JM et al, J. Bacteriol., 177:3104-3110,1995).<br>
When a DNA comprising a secretion signal gene + reporter enzyme gene -f CWP2 C-terminus gene (present or absent) was constructed, and the fusion protein was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevislae (hereinafter, referred to as S. cerevislae) , it was demonstrated that activity of the reporter enzyme is detected in the cell wall when the CWP2 C-terminus is present, and in the culture supernatant when the CWP2 C-terminus is absent. Accordingly, it was predicted that if the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall is inhibited by a test sample, the activity of the reporter enzyme in the cell wall will be diminished, or the activity of the reporter enzyme will be found in the culture supernatant. Thus was initiated the screening for compounds that inhibit the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall using this reporter system.<br>
From the screening using this reporter system, several compounds that inhibit the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall were discovered. A representative example is the compound shown in formula (la).<br><br>
The compound shown in the aforementioned formula (la) (hereinafter abbreviated as "compound (la)") inhibits the growth of S. cerevislae and Candida albicans (hereinafter, referred to as C. albicans) , and C. albicans cultured in the presence of the aforementioned compound (la) shows a weak ability to adhere onto cells. Thus, the aforementioned compound (la) was confirmed to suit the initial objectives of the invention, which was to find a compound that inhibits the adhesion of fungi, due to suppressing the expression of the fungal adhesins, based on the inhibition of transport system of GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall. Furthermore, observations using a transmission electron microscope confirmed that C. aijbicans cultured in the presence of the aforementioned compound (la) has an<br><br>
abnormality in its cell wall synthesis.<br>
Using the aforementioned compound (la) , the present inventors proved that antifungal agents based on the mechanism that inhibits the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall, could be achieved.<br>
Furthermore, to specify the target protein on which the aforementioned compound (la) acts, the present inventors searched for genes that confer resistance to the aforementioned compound (la) .<br>
A plasmid library of the S. cerevisiae gene was introduced into S. cerevisiae, and by overexpression, plasmids were collected that showed resistance to the abovementioned compound (la) . The resistant gene was then cloned, the nucleotide sequence was determined, and the gene was named GWTl (SEQ ID NO: 1) . In S. cerevisiae overexpressing the GWTl gene product, the aforementioned reporter enzyme that has the C-terminus of a GPI-anchored protein was transported to the cell wall, even in the presence of the aforementioned compound (la). Furthermore, observations under a transmission electron microscope confirmed that the cell wall is normal even in the presence of the aforementioned compound (la).<br>
Moreover, when point mutations were randomly introduced to the genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae,   and mutant strains Rl and R5 showing specific resistance to the aforementioned compound (la) were isolated, point mutations involving changes of the 405th codon of the GWTl gene from GTC to ATC in the Rl mutant strain, and the 140th codon from GGG to AGG in the R5 mutant strain were discovered.  Since resistance to the aforementioned compound (la) was seen when these mutant GWTl genes were introduced to a GWTl gene-disrupted strain, resistance to this compound was found to be explainable by the GWTl gene alone. Therefore, this suggested that the aforementioned compound (la) directly acts on the GWTl gene product to inhibit the function of the GWTl protein.<br>
By similar methods, the resistant genes of C. albicans (SEQ ID NOS: 3 and 5) were cloned, the nucleotide sequences were determined, and the genes were named CaGWTl.<br>
Furthermore, a database homology search using GWTl, revealed a homologue (SEQ ID NO: 27) of Scbizosaccharomyces pombe  (hereinafter.<br><br>
referred to as S. pombe) . Furthermore, PCR with primers based on the sequence of the highly conserved region in the proteins encoded by the GWTl genes of S, cerevisiae, S. po/ribe, and C. aljbicans, yielded homologues (SEQ ID NOS: 39 and 41) of Aspergillus fumigatus (hereinafter, referred to as A. fumigatus) . Furthermore, by performing PCR based on the sequence discovered from a database homology search with GWTl, revealed homologues (SEQ ID NOS: 54 and 58) of Cryptococcus neoformans (hereinafter, referred to as C, neoformans) .<br>

(1) . A method for obtaining a DNA encoding a protein for acquiring resistance to the aforementioned compound (la) by overexpression of the DNA in a fungus<br>
Herein, "fungus" means a fungus belonging to Division Zygomycota,   Ascomycota,   Basidiomycota,   and  Deuteromycota.<br>
Preferable is a pathogenic fungus, Mucor, Saccharomyces, Candida, Cryptococcus, Trichosporon, Malassezia, Aspergillus, Trichophyton, Microsporum, Sporothrix, Blastmyces, Coccidioides, Paracoccidioides,<br><br>
Penicillinium, or Fusarium, and more preferable is C. albicans, C. glabrata, C, neoformans, or A. fumlgatus. S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, for which genetic analyses are easy, are also preferred strains.<br>
A plasmid library of a fungal gene is introduced into a fungus. The plasmid library of S. cerevlsiae and S. pombe can be obtained from ATCC (Information for ATCC Number: 37323), and the plasmid library of C. albicans can be produced by the method according to Navaro-Garcia, F, etal, Mol. Cell.. Biol., 15: 2197-2206, 1995. The obtained plasmid library is introduced to the fungi by the method according to Gietz, D. et al, Nucl. Acids Res. 20: 1425, 1992. Alternatively, a kit such as YEASTMAKERTM Yeast Transformation System<br>
(Clontech) may be used.<br>
The Fungus to which the plasmid library is introduced is cultured in the presence of the aforementioned compound (la) . Specifically, an agar medium containing the aforementioned compound<br>
(la) at a concentration of 1.56 to 25 |ig/ml, preferably 1.56 to 6.25<br>
|i-g/ml, and more preferably 3.125 |ig/ml is inoculated with the fungus into which a plasmid library has been introduced, is cultured for an appropriate length of time, at 30°C to 42°C for 2 to 5 days, or preferably at 37 °C for 3 days. The colony formed upon proliferation is further cultured in a medium containing the aforementioned compound<br>
(la) , and the plasmid is purified from the proliferated fungal cells. Purification of the plasmid can be performed by the method according to METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY, Vol. 194: 169-182 (1991), for example.<br>
Preferably, the nucleotide sequence of the obtained plasmid is determined directly, but if necessary, cloning into an appropriate vector, for example pBluescript II, and pUC19 suitable for nucleotide sequence determination, is done to determine the nucleotide sequence. A nucleotide sequence can be determined for example by the method accompanying the ABI377 System (PE applied Biosystems) manual.<br>
In the Examples of the present invention, all 27 of the independently obtained colonies of S. cerevisiae, and 28 colonies out of 30 colonies of C. albicans contained the DNAs of this invention. Only one gene that confers resistance to the aforementioned compound<br>
(la) exists in these fungi and this can be obtained by the abovementioned method.<br><br>
(2) . A method for obtaining a DNA that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the DNA of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, or SEQ ID NO: 5<br>
1   <br>
An example of a method for obtaining a DNA encoding a protein<br>
participating in fungal cell wall synthesis according to the present invention comprises designing a primer from the information of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 using the genomic DNA of 5. cerevlslae as a template, or designing a primer from the information of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5 using the genomic DNA of C. albicans as the template, then performing PCR, and cloning the amplified DNA into an appropriate vector, such as pBlueScript. The primer is designed as necessary according to the region to be amplified, and the length is preferably 15 bp or more, more preferably 20 bp or more, and in some cases sequences necessary for subsequent DNA construction, such as restriction enzyme sites, may be added. The conditions for PCR can be determined appropriately according to factors such as the length of primer, the length of the region to be amplified, and the amount of template DNA to be used. For example, a DNA encoding a protein participating in cell wall synthesis in a fungus can be obtained using 200 ng of the genomic DNA of C. albicans as a template, and SEQ ID NO: 21 and SEQ. ID NO: 22 as primers under conditions of 94'C for 4 minutes —&gt; (94*'C for 30 seconds -&gt; 68 °C for 5 minutes) x 35 cycles -&gt; 72 °C for 4 minutes.<br>
The DNA obtained by PCR may be used as a probe for obtaining other types of fungal DNA showing homology to the DNA encoding the protein participating in cell wall synthesis. Specifically, for example, to obtain a homologous gene of C. albicans encoding the protein participating in S. cerevlslae cell wall synthesis, DNA that hybridizes under stringent conditions can be cloned from the genomic library or cDNA library of C. albicans, using the genomic DNA of S. cerevlslae as a template, and using DNA that is obtained by PCR as a probe. Herein, stringent conditions refer to hybridization in 4x SSC at 65°C, then washing in 0 . Ix SSC at 65oC for 1 hour, for example. Furthermore, in another the stringent conditions are 4x SSC at 42 °C in 50% formamide. Alternatively, conditions such as hybridization in the PerfectHyb™ (TOYOBO) solution at 65oC for 2.5 hours, then<br><br>
washing in 1) . 2x SSC, 0.05% SDS solution at 25°C for 5 minutes, 2) . 2x SSC, 0.05% SDS solution at 25°C for 15 minutes, and 3) . 0 . Ix SSC, 0.1% SDS solution at SOoCfor 20 minutes, are also allowed.<br>
The Examples of this invention demonstrate from Southern Blot analysis that there is only one gene in C. albicans that hybridizes with the DNA of SEQ ID NO: 1, and shows the cloning of this gene. From the above-mentioned method, DNA that hybridizes with SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3 can be obtained.<br>
(3) . A method for obtaining a DNA that encodes a protein that participates in fungal cell wall synthesis, based on a homology search<br>
The present invention revealed the GWTl homologues of S. cerevlslae, C. albicans, S. pombe, A. fumlgatus, and C. neoformans, The region conserved among these genes is considered to be important for GWTl gene products to exhibit their function, and may very well be conserved in other fungi.<br>
Therefore, a DNA encoding a protein participating in fungal cell wall synthesis can be obtained by either carrying out hybridization upon constructing a probe based on the amino acid sequence of the conserved region, or by performing PCR by designing primers based on the sequence. The PCR primer may be of any sequence as long as it is designed to encode the conserved region, but is preferably SEQ ID NOS: 29 and 31 or preferably SEQ ID NOS: 29 and 30.<br>
Furthermore, as another method, a DNA encoding a protein participating in fungal cell wall synthesis can be obtained by carrying out PCR with cDNA or genomic DNA upon finding a nucleotide sequence showing homology to GWTl from gene fragments registered in databases, and then designing primers based on that nucleotide sequence.<br>
Examples of PCR methods for obtaining a full-length gene based on the obtained sequence are techniques such as 3'-RACE, 5'-RACE, and inverse PCR, and it is also possible to select by hybridization a clone containing neighboring sequences. A full-length gene can be obtained by combining these techniques.<br>
(4). a method for obtaining a fungus that overexpresses or lacks a<br><br>
protein for acquiring resistance to the aforementioned compound (la)<br>
A Fungus, preferably S. cerevisiae, that overexpresses a protein for acquiring resistance to the aforementioned compound (la) of this invention can be obtained by the method of inserting an expression vector expressing the protein into a particular position on the fungal chromosome, for example an expression vector in which the DNA of SEQ ID NO: 1 is connected downstream of a promoter, which can forcibly express the protein in fungi, preferably the promoter of budding yeast enolase gene (ENOl). The insertion method can be performed, for example, by the steps of, inserting a desired sequence into the multicloning site of pRS304 (Sikorski RS et al. Genetics. 122(1): 19-27, 1989), constructing a vector for integration^ and introducing the vector into the fungus. One can refer to METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY Vol.194: 281-301 (1991) for details.<br>
Furthermore, an overexpressed strain of C. albicans can be obtained by incorporating the gene of SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5 into an expression vector for C. albicans, such as pCARSl and pRMl (Pla Jetal, Yeast 12: 1677-1702, 1996), and then transforming C. albicans (Sanglard D et al, Antimicrobiol. Agents Chemother. 40: 2300-2305, 1996).<br>
Fungi of this invention lacking a gene for acquiring resistance against the aforementioned compound (la) , preferably S. cerevlslae, can be obtained by the following methods, but is not to be construed as being limited thereto.<br>
PCR amplification is carried out using a marker gene, preferably his5 gene of S. pombe, as a template, and using primers that are designed so that PCR products that contain the gene to be deleted (30 bp or more, or preferably 40 bp or more). In the case of S. cerevlslae, the genetic sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, positioned on both ends can be obtained. The PCR products can be purified and introduced into fungi, then cultured in a selection medium corresponding to the marker gene, for example, his~forhis5, to obtain the deletion strain.<br>
Furthermore, the deletion strain of C. albicans is obtained by the usual method using a hisG-URA3-hisG cassette (Fonzi WA et al. Genetics 134: 717-728,1993) based on the nucleotide sequence information of SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 5.<br><br>
2 . A method for examining whether or not the test sample influences the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall<br>
Whether or not the test sample inhibits the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall, or whether or not the test sample inhibits the expression of the GPI-anchored protein in the fungal surface can be examined by (1) a method using a reporter enzyme, (2) a method using an antibody that reacts with the surface glycoprotein of the fungal cell wall, (3) a method for examining the adhesion ability towards animal cells, and (4) a method for observing fungi using an optical microscope or an electron microscope.<br>
By using the methods of (1) to (4) described below, preferably the methods of (1) to (4) in combination, the test sample is judged to inhibit the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall, or the expression of the GPI-anchored proteins at the fungal surface. Furthermore, it is judged that the test sample influences the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall when the degree of inhibition diminishes or the inhibition is no longer seen when the protein encoded by the DNA of the present invention is overexpressed in fungi.<br>
Hereinafter, the methods of (1) to (4) will be described. (1). A method using a reporter enzyme<br>
The process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall can be quantified by a tracer experiment such as labeling a GPI-anchored protein with a radioactive isotope, then upon fractionation of the fungal cell wall fraction, immunoprecipitating with an antibody against a GPI-anchored protein. Alternatively, the quantification can be more readily done by expressing the C-terminal sequence considered to function as a transport signal, which is commonly observed among GPI-anchored proteins, as a fusion protein with an easily measurable enzyme (reporter enzyme), fractionating the fungal cell wall fraction, and then using a reporter system that measures the enzyme activity of each fraction (Van Berkel MAA et al, FEES Letters, 349: 135-138, 1994). Hereinafter, a method using the reporter enzyme will be explained, but the present invention is not to be construed as being limited thereto.<br><br>
First, the reporter gene is constructed and is introduced into a fungus. The reporter gene is constructed by linking a promoter sequence that functions in fungi, followed by DNAs that respectively encode a signal sequence, a reporter enzyme, and a GPI-anchored protein C-terminal sequence so that the reading frames match. Examples of the promoter sequences are those of promoters such as<br>
GALIO, and ENOl. Examples of signal sequences are those of OC-factor, invertase, lysozyme, and such.  Examples of reporter enzymes are<br>
P-lactamase, lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, |3-galactosidase, and such.  Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) , which can be detected easily, can be used, even though it does not have enzyme activity. Examples<br>
of GPI-anchored protein C-terminal sequences are a-agglutinin C-terminal sequence, CWP2 C-terminal sequence, and such. Furthermore, it is preferable to insert an appropriate selection marker such as LEU2, and URA3 into the vector containing the constructed reporter gene.<br>
The constructed reporter gene is inserted into a fungus by an appropriate method, such as the lithium acetate method (Gietz D et al, Nucl. Acids Res. 20: 1425, 1992), and cultured, if necessary by a method suitable for the selection marker, such as Leu" medium for LEU2, and Ura" medium for URA3, and then fungi into which the DNA has been introduced are selected.<br>
Whether or not a test sample influences the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall is examined by the following method.<br>
The reporter gene-introduced fungi are cultured under appropriate conditions, for example at 30°C for 48 hours, in the presence of a test sample. After culturing, the culture supernatant is centrifuged, and the reporter enzyme activity of the culture supernatant fraction is measured. The remaining cell fraction is washed, then the cell wall components are separated by an appropriate method, such as degrading the cell wall glucan with glucanase, and then measuring the reporter enzyme activity of the cell wall fraction and the cytoplasmic fraction. The assay can be simply carried out by determining the amount of reporter enzyme in the cell fraction by centrifuging, then without washing the cells, determining the<br><br>
amount of reporter enzyme derived from the culture supernatant fraction that remains in the cell fraction by proportional calculation, and subtracting this from the amount of reporter enzyme of the cell fraction.<br>
If an activity to increase the reporter enzyme activity within the culture supernatant fraction (activity per cell), or an activity to decrease the reporter enzyme activity in the cell wall fraction (activity per cell) is confirmed in the test sample, the test sample is judged to have influenced the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall.<br>
(2) . A method using an antibody that reacts with the surface glycoprotein of a fungal cell wall<br>
Whether or not the test sample influences the expression of the GPI-anchored protein at the fungal surface layer can be detected by quantifying a GPI-anchored protein in the fungal cell wall using an antibody that reacts with the protein.<br>
For example, as the antibody, the antigenic determinant is predicted from the amino acid sequence of a GPI-anchored protein ,<br>
for example, OC-agglutinin, Cwp2p, and Alslp (Chen MH et al, J. Biol. Chem., 270:26168-26177, 1995; Van Der Vaat JM et al, J. Bacteriol., 177:3104-3110,1995; Hoyer LL et al, Mol. Microbiol. , 15:39-54, 1995) , the peptide of that region is synthesized, this is bound to an antigenic substance, such as a carrier protein, and then polyclonal antibodies can be obtained by immunizing a rabbit and such, or a monoclonal antibody can be obtained by immunizing a mouse and such. Furthermore, a house rabbit polyclonal antibody against the Alslp peptide is preferable.<br>
In an alternative method, a monoclonal antibody against a GPI-anchored protein may be obtained by immunizing a mouse and such with a fungus, preferably a fungus overexpressing the GPI-anchored<br>
protein, such as CX-agglutinin, Cwp2p, and Alslp, and in some cases, by immunizing with the partially purified GPI-anchored protein , and selecting the clone yielded as a result of the fusion by ELISA, Western blot analysis, and such.<br>
Whether or not the test sample influences the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall, and diminishes<br><br>
the amount of the protein derived from the GPI-anchored protein in the cell wall can be examined by the following method.<br>
A fungus is cultured in the presence of a test sample under appropriate conditions, such as 30 ° C, for 48 hours. The cultured fungus is collected by centrifugation and the cells are disrupted, preferably using glass beads. The washed, disrupted cells are preferably subjected to centrifugal extraction with SDS, then the precipitate is washed. After the extraction, the disrupted cells are treated with an enzyme that degrades glucan, preferably glucanase, and the centrifuged supernatant thereof is the GPI-anchored protein sample.<br>
The anti-Alslp peptide antibody is coated onto a 96-well plate by incubating at 4°C overnight. After washing with a washing solution, preferably PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), blocking is carried out with a reagent that blocks the non-specific adsorption sites of the 9 6-well plate, preferably a protein such as BSA, and gelatin, more preferably BlockAce. After washing again with a washing solution, preferably PBST, in some cases, after adding an appropriately diluted GPI-anchored protein sample, the reaction is carried out for an appropriate length of time, such as 2 hours at room temperature. After washing with a washing solution, preferably with PBST, an antibody against the enzyme-labeled C. aijbicans, preferably HRP-labeled anti-Candida antibody, is reacted for an appropriate length of time, such as 2 hours at room temperature. The method for labeling may be enzyme labeling or radioactive isotope labeling. After washing with a washing solution, preferably PBST, the amount of Alslp in the GPI-anchored protein sample is calculated by a method appropriate for the type of label, i.e. for an enzyme label, adding a substrate solution, and then upon stopping the reaction, measuring the absorbance at 490 nm. (3) . A method for examining the adhesion ability towards animal cells<br>
Whether or not the test sample influences expression of a GPI-anchored protein on the fungal surface can be examined by measuring the activity of the GPI-anchored protein in the fungal cell wall, preferably by measuring the adhesion ability of fungi to animal cells, and such.  Besides Alslp, Hwplp, and such participating in<br><br>
adhesion to animal cells , a-agglutinin participating in mating, Flolp participating in yeast aggregation, and such are known as GPI-anchored proteins. Hereinafter, examination methods that use the adhesion ability of fungi to animal cells will be explained in detail, but this invention is not to be construed as being limited thereto.<br>
As the fungus, a fungus having an adhesion ability towards cells is used, and preferably, the fungus is C. albicans. For mammalian cells, cells that adhere to the fungus are used, and preferably, are intestinal epithelial cells. The mammalian cells are cultured and are immobilized by an appropriate method such as ethanol immobilization. The test sample and the fungi, which have been incubated for an appropriate length of time, such as 48 hours at 30 °C, are inoculated, then after culturing for a certain length of time, for example 1 hour at 30 °C, the culture supernatant is removed, washed with a buffer, and is superposed onto an agar media, such as Sabouraud Dextrose Agar Medium (Difco) . After culturing at 30°C overnight, the number of colonies is counted, and the adhesion rate is calculated.<br>
If activity to lower the number of colonies formed by adhesion of fungi to cells is observed in a test sample compared to that of fungi that are not treated with the compound, the test sample is judged to have influenced the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall.<br>
(4). A method for observing fungi using an electron microscope or an optical microscope<br>
Whether or not a test sample influences the expression of the GPI-anchored proteins in the fungal surface can be examined by observing the structure of the fungal cell wall using an electron microscope.<br>
In the presence of a test sample, a fungus such as C, albicans is cultured for a certain length of time, for example, 48 hours at 30°C, and the ultrafine morphological structure is observed with a transmission electron microscope. Herein, observation with a transmission electron microscope can be carried out, for example by the method according to the Electron Microscope Chart Manual (Medical Publishing Center). The flocculent fibrous structure of the outermost layer of the fungal cell that has a high electron density<br><br>
and is observable by transmission electron microscope image, is considered to be a surface glycoprotein layer having GPI-anchored proteins as its constituents, and is not influenced by other existing antifungal agents. When this flocculent fibrous structure of the outermost layer of a fungal cell, which has a high electron density, disappears leaving a slight layer with a high electron density, compared to that in the untreated cells, the test sample is judged to have influenced the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall.<br>
When images, in which fungal cells are largely swollen and budding (division) is inhibited, are observed under a transmission electron microscope in addition to an optical microscope, the test sample is judged to have an influence on the cell wall.<br>

The present invention is specifically illustrated below with reference to Examples, but it is not to be construed as being limited thereto.<br>
Example Al  Construction of the reporter gene and introduction thereof into S. cerevisiae<br>
(1) . Construction of the reporter gene where lysozyme is the reporter enzyme<br>
A lysozyme gene comprising a promoter sequence was amplified by PCR using pESH plasmid comprising the ENOl promoter + secretion signal + the lysozyme gene (Ichikawa K et al, Biosci . Biotech. Biochem. , 57(10), 1686-1690, 1993) as template, and the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 8 and SEQ ID NO: 9 as primers, and this was subcloned into the SalI-£:coRI site of pCR-Script SK( + ) (a) . Furthermore, a CWP2 gene was amplified by PCR using S. cerevisiae chromosomal DNA as template, and the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 10 and SEQ ID NO: 11 as primers, and this was subcloned into the EcoRI-Hindlll site of pUC19 (b). Similarly,  CYCl terminator was amplified by PCR using pYES2<br>
(INVITROGEN) as a template, and the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 12 and SEQ ID NO: 13 as primers, and this was subcloned into the newly introduced Notl-Kpnl   site of pUC19 (c).<br>
Next, the lysozyme gene excised with Sall-EcoRI (a), and the CWP2 gene excised with EcoRl-Hindlll (b) were inserted into the Sall-Hindlll cleavage site of pESH. Finally, pRLW63T was produced by excising a gene comprising the ENOl promoter + secretion signal + lysozyme gene + CWP2 gene using Ba/nHI-Hindlll, inserting this into a pRS306 integration vector (Sikorski RS et al, Genetics. 122(1) : 19-27, 1989) ,  and then inserting the CYCl  terminator excised with<br><br>
Hindlll-Kpnl   (c) into the Hlndlll-Kpnl   cleavage site.<br>
(2)	.  Construction of the reporter gene where cephalosporinase is the<br>
reporter enzyme<br><br>
and this was subcloned into the BamRl-Notl site newly introduced into pUC19 (d) . Furthermore, a cephalosporinase gene was amplified by PCR using Citrohacter freundli chromosomal DNA as template, and the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 16 and SEQ ID NO: 17 as primers, and this was subcloned into the NspV-Xbal site newly introduced into pUC19 (e) . Similarly, the CWP2 gene was amplified by PCR using the S. cerevisiae chromosomal DNA as template, and the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 18 and SEQ ID NO: 19 as primers, and this was subcloned into the Xbal-Hlndlll site of pUC19 (f),<br>
After producing the full length ENOl promoter + secretion signal portion by inserting the BamRI-Sall fragment of pESH into the Sa/nHI-Sail cleavage site of a plasmid into which (d) has been inserted, the cephalosporinase gene excised with NspV-XJbal, and the CWP2 gene excised with Xbal-Hindlll were inserted into the NspV-Hlndlll cleavage site. Next, pRCW63T was produced by excising with EcoRI-Hlndlll, inserting this fragment into the abovementioned pRS306 , and then inserting the CYCl terminator into the Hindlll-Kpnl cleavage site.<br>

After washing with sterilized water, the above mentioned pRLW63T and pRCW63T were introduced by lithium acetate method that uses YEASTMAKER™ Yeast Transformation System (Clontech) (according to the YEASTMAKER™ Yeast Transformation System User Manual) . pRLW63T and pRCW63T in which the URA3 gene was cleaved with EcoRV and Apal, respectively, were used. After culturing in SD(Ura~) medium at 30 "C for 3 days, the grown colonies were cultured in YPD medium.<br><br>
When the localizations of, lysozyme and cephalosporinase activities were confirmed, both activities were mainly localized in the cell wall, and the C-terminal sequence of CWP2 was confirmed to function as a transport signal to the cell wall.<br>
Example A2 Screening of pharmaceutical agents by the S. cerevisiaB reporter system<br>
Since sensitivity of the enzyme reaction is better with cephalosporinase compared to lysozyme, S. cerevisiae introduced with pRCW63T (S. cerevisiae CW63 strain) was used for the screening of compounds.<br>
After stationary cultivation in YPD liquid medium at 30 "C for 48 hours, the yeast cell culture was diluted 100 times with YPD liquid medium (3-5x 10 eel Is/ml) and 7 5 |ll/well aliquots thereof were inoculated into a V-bottomed 96-well plate containing 25 μl/well of a diluted test sample, and this was subj ected to stationary cultivation at 30°C for 48 hours. After centrifuging the plate, 25<br>
III of the supernatant was sampled and placed in a flat-bottomed 96-well plate, and this was used as the culture supernatant fraction.<br>
The precipitated cells were suspended, and 75 μl/well aliquots of Zymolyase (Seikagaku Corporation) solution prepared with 2.4 M sorbitol were added and were allowed to react at 30 ° C for 1 hour. After centrifuging the plate, 10 \il  of the supernatant was sampled<br>
and placed in a flat-bottomed 96-well plate, 15 |il of phosphate buffer was added, and this was used as the cell wall fraction.<br>
The cephalosporinase activities in the medium and in the cell<br>
wall fraction were measured by adding 200 μM of nitrocefin solution to a pooled sample, and after a certain period of time, stopping the reaction with citric acid buffer, and then measuring the absorbance at 490 nm.<br>
Furthermore, fungal growth in the presence of the test sample was determined by visual observation.<br>
Fig. 2 showed that in the presence of the aforementioned<br>
compound (la) at a concentration of 0.39 to 1.56μg/ml, cephalosporinase activity increases in the culture supernatant<br>
fraction, and the activity decreases in the cell wall fraction.  In<br><br>
this manner, a compound that increases the cephalosporinase activity in the culture supernatant fraction, and in addition decreases the cephalosporinase activity in the cell wall fraction was considered to be a compound that inhibits the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall.<br>
Example A3: Screening of pharmaceutical agents using the adhesion of Candida  to animal cells<br>
Three-milliliter aliguots of IEC-18 cells (Ix 10 cells/ml in D-MEM medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical)containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine) were placed in each well of a 6-well multi-well plate. The plate was incubated in a carbon dioxide gas incubator at 37 °C for 3 days, the culture supernatant was removed, and ethanol immobilization was carried out.<br>
C. albicans cultured in Sabouraud Dextrose Liquid Medium containing various concentrations of the test sample at 30 °C for 48 hours was adjusted to 4x 10 cells/ml, and 1 ml was inoculated into each well of the plate in which the immobilized IEC-18 cells were cultured. After cultivation at 30°C for 1 hour, the culture supernatant was removed, washed with PBS, and then 2 ml of Sabouraud Dextrose Agar Medium (Difco) was superposed. After cultivation at 30 °C overnight, the number of colonies (CPU) that had grown was counted and the adhesion rate was calculated.<br>
Fig. 3 shows that even at a concentration of 1.56 |lg/ml of the aforementioned compound (la) , in which growth inhibition cannot be observed, adhesion of C. albicans to animal cells was inhibited to about a half. Compared to untreated C. albicans, a test sample that diminished CPU that adhered to cells was considered as a compound that inhibits the adhesion of C. albicans  to animal cells.<br>

(5 ml) containing various concentrations of the test sample at 30 °C for 48 hours, and the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed,<br>
and then suspended in 300 |il of Tris-HCl buffer. The suspended cells were transferred to a microtube containing glass beads, and were disrupted by repeating 10 cycles of stirring for 1 minute and cooling on ice for 1 minute. The disrupted cells that were washed were extracted with 2% SDS at 95oC for 10 minutes, centrifuged, and then the precipitate was washed 5 times with phosphate buffer.  To this<br>
precipitate, 0.5 ml of 5 μg/ml Zymolyase solution was added, reacted at 37 °C for 1 hour, and the centrifuged supernatant was used as the<br>
GPI-anchored protein sample.<br>
A 96-well plate was coated with 50 M-l of anti-Alslp peptide antibody (40 μg/ml) at 4oC overnight. After washing 5 times with PBS containing 0,05% Tween 20 (PBST) , blocking was carried out with 25% BlockAce at room temperature for 2 hours.  After washing 3 times with<br>
PBST, 50 |J.l of the 2-fold serially diluted GPI-anchored protein sample was reacted at room temperature for 2 hours .  After washing 5 times<br>
with PBST, 100 111 of 1000-fold diluted HRP-labeled anti-Candida antibody (ViroStat) was reacted at room temperature for 2 hours, then<br>
upon washing 5 times with PBST, 75μl of substrate solution was added.<br>
After the reaction was stopped, absorbance at 490 nm was measured.<br>
Fig. 4 shows that in the presence of the aforementioned compound<br>
(la) at a concentration of 0.1 to 0.39μg/ml, the amount of Alslp antigen increases in the culture supernatant fraction, and the amount<br>
of antigen decreases in the cell wall fraction. In this manner, a compound that increased the amount of Alslp in the culture supernatant, or decreased the amount of Alslp in the cell wall fraction, as quantified by ELISA, compared to the amount of Alslp in C. albicans untreated with the compound, was considered to be a compound that inhibits the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall in C. albicans,<br><br>
Example A5 Observation of the cell wall of C. albicans cultured in the presence of a test sample by an electron microscope<br>
C. albicans which was cultured in Sabouraud Dextrose Liquid Medium (5 ml) containing various concentrations of the test agent at 30°C for 48 hours, then centrifuged, and collected, was immobilized by potassium permanganate immobilization method, and the transmission electron microscope image thereof was observed.<br>
The flocculent fibrous structure with high electron density was observed in the outermost layer of the cell, and was considered to be the surface layer glycoprotein layer having the GPI-anchored protein as its constituent. This flocculent fibrous structure was not influenced by other existing antifungal agents.<br>
In C. albicans cultured in the presence of the aforementioned compound (la) , the flocculent fibrous structure of the outermost layer of the cell having high electron density disappeared leaving a small amount of the layer with high electron density, compared to that in untreated cells. In this manner, when the flocculent fibrous structure of the outermost layer of the fungal cell having high electron density disappeared, the test sample was considered to be the compound influencing the process that transports GPI-anchored proteins to the cell wall.<br>

Example A16 Cloning of the C. albicans homologue of the S. cerevisiae GWTl gene<br>
The C. albicans   genomic DNA (25 μg) treated with Hindlll<br>
(TaKaRa)  for  16  hours  was  separated  by  0.75%  agarose  gel<br>
electrophoresis method, and the DNA fragments ranging in size from<br>
approximately 3 . 5 to 4 . 5 kb were recovered from the gel. The recovered<br>
DNA fragments were inserted into the Hindlll  site of the pKF3 vector<br>
(TaKaRa), and a Candida  genomic library was produced.<br>
Using the produced library, approximately 10,000 colonies were displayed on an LB/Ampicillin plate, colony lifting was performed using a Colony/Plaque Screen (NEN) membrane, and then this was subjected to hybridization. A probe was produced by labeling 20 ng of the approximately 1.5 kb DNA fragment of SEQ ID NO: 1 with alpha 33P-dCTP by the random primer method, and purifying using a GeneQuant column (Amersham-Pharmacia).<br>
Hybridization was carried out by pre-incubating the membrane<br><br>
in a PerfectHybTM (TOYOBO) solution at 65°C for 1 hour, then adding the labeled pYobe mentioned above, and incubating further at 65°C for 2.5 hours. Washing was carried out with (i) 2x SSC, 0.05% SDS solution at 25°C for 5 minutes, (ii) 2x SSC, 0.05% SDS solution at 25°C for 15 minutes, and (iii) 0. Ix SSC, 0.1% SDS solution at 50°C for 20 minutes. The washed membrane was wrapped with Saran Wrap, contacted with an X-RAY FILM (KONICA) for 24 hours at room temperature, and then developed. The E, coli colonies corresponding to the exposed spots were isolated, and were subjected to secondary screening. Approximately 200 of the isolated colonies were displayed on each LB/Ampicillin plate, colony lifting was performed in a similar manner to primary screening, which was followed by hybridization. The conditions for hybridization were the same as the conditions for primary screening.<br>
As a result, a single colony of E, coli that reacts strongly with the probe was isolated. Plasmids were collected from this colony, and when the contained sequence was determined, a novel sequence having the same sequence as that revealed in Example A9 (SEQ ID NO: 5) was found (the sequence of Candida GWTl) , and was presumed to be a C. albicans  homologue.<br>
Example A17:  The S. Pombe  homologue of the S. cerevisiae  GWTl gene<br>
S. Pombe genes that show homology to the S. cerevisiae GWTl gene<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 27 , and the amino acid sequence of the gene product thereof:<br>
SEQ ID NO: 28) were found from a database search, and were considered<br>
to be the S. Pombe  homologues of GWTl.<br>
Example A18: Cloning of the Aspergillus fumigatus  homologue of the S. cerevisiae  GWTl gene<br>
By genetic sequence analysis, the inventors discovered two highly conserved regions in the protein encoded by the GWTl genes of S. cerevisiae, S, pombe, and C. albicans (Fig. 7) . Based on the presumed DNA that encodes the amino acid sequence of this conserved region, primers of SEQ ID NO: 29, SEQ ID NO: 30, and.SEQ ID NO: 31<br>
were designed.  PCR amplification was carried out using 1 |-ll of the library purchased from STRATAGENE (Aspergillus    fumigatus    cDNA<br><br>
library: #937053) as a template, and using primers of SEQ ID NO: 29 and SEQ ID NO: 31.  Furthermore, as a result of carrying out nested-PCR<br>
using 1 |lg of this amplified sample as a template, and using primers of SEQ ID NO: 29 and SEQ ID NO: 30, amplification of a single fragment of approximately 250 bp was confirmed. When the sequence of this fragment was determined, a novel sequence having homology to the GWTl gene of S. cerevisiae, shown in SEQ ID NO: 32, was obtained, and this was presumed to be the homologue of A. fumigatus.<br>
To obtain a full length cDNA, primers of SEQ ID NO: 33 and SEQ ID NO: 34 were designed based on the sequence of the amplified fragment Furthermore, primers outside the gene insertion site of the library, SEQ ID NO: 35 and SEQ ID NO: 36, were designed. As a result of performing PCR using the A. fumigatus cDNA library as a template, and the primer set of SEQ ID NO: 33 and SEQ ID NO: 35, or the primer set of SEQ ID NO: 34 and SEQ ID NO: 36, amplification of a DNA fragment of approximately 1 kb was confirmed (by both primer sets) . As a result of determining the nucleotide sequences of these fragments, a novel sequence that is highly homologous to the GWTl genes of S. cerevisiae shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 was obtained. Since the sequence is highly homologous to the GWTl genes of S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, and C. aihicans throughout the entire gene, this sequence was strongly suggested to be a homologue of A. fumigatus.<br>
To clone the entire homologue of A. fumigatus, the primer shown in SEQ ID NO: 37 that corresponds to the sequence upstream of the initiation codon, and the primer of SEQ ID NO: 38 that corresponds to the sequence downstream of the stop codon were newly designed based on the obtained sequence. As a result of performing 35 cycles of PCR using the A. fumigatus cDNA library (STRATAGENE) and the A, fumigatus genomic library (STRATAGENE) as templates, and primers of SEQ ID NO: 37 and SEQ ID NO: 38, a single amplified fragment of approximately 1. 6 kb was detected from both templates. As a result of determining the nucleotide sequence of this fragment by Direct-Sequencing, the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 39 was found from the cDNA library, and was suggested to encode a protein comprising 501 amino acids shown in SEQ ID NO: 40. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 41 was found from the genomic library, and was found<br><br>
to have an intron comprising 77 base pairs in one position.<br>
Example A19:  Cloning of the Cryptococcus   homologue of the S. cerevisiae  GWTl gene<br>
1)	.  Database search<br>
As a result of database searching for genes showing homology to the S. cerevisiae GWTl gene, the sequence of 502042C05 . xl was found from the server of the Genome Center at Stanford University (http://baggage.Stanford.edu/cgi-misc/cneoformans/). Furthermore, the sequence of b6e06cn.f1 was found from the server at Oklahoma University, U.S.A (http://www.genome.ou.edu/cneo_blast.html).<br>
2)	.  PCR using genomic DNA as template<br>
The primer of SEQ ID NO: 42 was constructed based on the sequence of 502042C05 .xl, and the primer of SEQ ID NO: 43 was constructed based on the sequence of b6e06cn.fl. When PCR amplification was carried out using the genomic DNA of Cryptococcus (Cryptococcus neoformans) as a template, and using the primer of SEQ ID NO: 42, and the primer of SEQ ID NO: 43, an amplified fragment of approximately 2 kb was detected. When the nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined, a novel sequence showing homology to the GWTl gene of S. cerevisiae,   shown in SEQ ID NO: 44, was obtained.<br>
In order to obtain the sequence upstream of the initiation codon of the Cryptococcus GWTl gene, the primer of SEQ ID NO: 45 was designed based on the sequence of 502042C05 .xl, and the primer of SEQ ID NO: 46 was designed based on the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 44. When PCR amplification was carried out using the genomic DNA of Cryptococcus as a template, and using the primer of SEQ ID NO: 45, and the primer of SEQ ID NO: 46, an amplified fragment of approximately 500 bp was detected. When the nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined, the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 47 was obtained, and this was found to overlap with SEQ ID NO: 44.<br>
3)	.  3'-RACE<br>
To obtain the 3' -terminal sequence of the Cryptococcus GWTl gene, 3'-RACE was carried out. Reverse transcription was carried out by priming with the adaptor-primer of SEQ ID NO: 48, which is based on<br>
16 )lg of total RNA extracted from Cryptococcus,    and by using<br><br>
Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (GIBCO/BRL), and a single stranded cDNA, which is to become the template for the RT-PCR that follows, was produced. As a result of performing 35 cycles of PCR using the single stranded cDNA as a template, and the primers of SEQ ID NO: 49 and SEQ ID NO: 50, an amplified fragment of approximately 1.2 kb was detected. When the nucleotide sequence of this fragment was analyzed by the Direct-Sequencing method, the novel sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 51 showing homology to the S. cerevisiae GWTl gene was obtained.<br>
4)	.  PCR of a full length genomic DNA<br>
Using the primer of SEQ ID NO: 52 that was designed based on SEQ ID NO: 47, and the primer of SEQ ID NO: 53 that was designed based on SEQ ID NO: 51, 35 cycles of PCR was carried out on three independent preparations with the genomic DNA of Cryptococcus as template. As a result, an amplified fragment of approximately 2 kb was detected from all three of the independent tubes, and therefore, each of them were individually subjected to Direct-Sequencing, and their entire nucleotide sequences were determined. As a result, the three independent sequences completely matched, and a sequence comprising the full length GWTl gene homologue of Cryptococcus shown in SEQ ID NO: 54 was obtained.<br>
5)	.  Determination of the cDNA sequence<br>
Comparison of the sequence of the Cryptococcus GWTl gene derived from the genome shown in SEQ ID NO: 54 with cDNA sequence 51 obtained by 3'-RACE suggested the presence introns at two positions. Furthermore, since the open reading frame following the ATG initiation codon is not continuous , the presence of another intron was suggested. Therefore, the cDNA structure was predicted from the presumed amino acid sequence and the splicing donor/acceptor sequence, and the primers of SEQ ID NO: 55.and SEQ ID NO: 56 were designed at the position predicted to be the junction between exons , As a result of performing 35 cycles of PCR using the single stranded cDNA derived from Cryptococcus as template with the above-mentioned primers, an amplified fragment of approximately 1. 4 kb was confirmed. As a result of determining the nucleotide sequence by subjecting the fragment to Direct-Sequencing, the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 57 was obtained,<br><br>
and by comparing with SEQ ID NO: 54, the cDNA sequence of the GWTl gene of Cryptococcus was suggested to have the structure of SEQ ID NO: 58, Since the sequence shows high homology at certain regions with the GWTl genes of S. cerevisiae, S, pombe, C. albicans, and A. fumigatus, this sequence was strongly suggested to be a homologue of Cryptococcus.<br>
Example A20: Genetic mutation that confers resistance to the aforementioned compound of the formula (la)<br>
S. cerevisiae LW63 strain having a lysozyme gene as the reporter gene due to introduction of pRLW63T was treated with ethyl methanesulfonate, then by culturing in a SD medium containing the aforementioned compound of the formula (la) at concentrations of 1. 56 ,<br>
3.13, and 6 .25 |ig/ml at 37 °C for 3 days, five resistant mutant strains (Rl to. R5) were obtained. Among them, the Rl mutant strain and the R5 mutant strain were found to have acquired a specific resistant characteristic to the aforementioned compound of the formula (la) due to a mutation of a single gene. To confirm whether or not these two mutant strains have mutations on the GWTl gene, genomic DNAs were extracted from both mutant strains, and the nucleotide sequence of the GWTl gene portion was determined. As a result, in the Rl mutant strain, guanine at position 1213 had been mutated to adenine. Furthermore, in the R5 mutant strain, guanine at position 418 had been mutated to adenine. Therefore, it was elucidated that in the Rl mutant strain, the 405th amino acid, isoleucine, had been changed to valine, and in the R5 mutant strain, the 140th amino acid, glycine, had been changed to arginine.<br>
Next, to confirm whether or not these mutations are the cause of the acquisition of the specific resistant characteristic to the aforementioned compound of the formula (la), the mutant GWTl gene (Rl or R5) was isolated using the genomic DNAs derived from both mutant strains as templates and the primers of SEQ ID NOS: 60 and 61. Simultaneously, the GWTl promoter region (SEQ ID NO: 62) and the terminator region (SEQ ID NO: 63) were isolated, the GWTl gene promoter, mutant GWTl gene ORF, and the GWTl gene terminator were inserted into the pRS316 vector, and plasmids that express a single copy of the<br><br>
mutant GWTl gene were constructed (pRS316GWTl-Rl, pRS316GWTl-R5). This was introduced to a diploid strain (WDGl) in which only a single copy of the GWTl gene is disrupted. Spores were formed by culturing the colonies on a sporulation medium, and a clone in which the GWTl gene on the chromosome is disrupted and also harbors the abovementioned plasmid was obtained by performing a tetrad analysis. When this was cultured in a medium containing the aforementioned compound of the formula (la), resistance to the aforementioned compound of the formula (la) was seen, similarly to the original Rl mutant strain and R5 mutant strain . From the above, it was elucidated that the specific resistant characteristic to the aforementioned compound of the formula (la) is conferred by a point mutation accompanying an amino acid mutation, that occurred on the GWTl gene, and this compound was strongly suggested to inhibit the function of the GWTl protein by directly binding to the protein.<br>
