MULTIMEDIA CLIENT/SERVER SYSTEM WITH ADJUSTABLE PACKET<br>
SIZE AND METHODS FOR USE THEREWITH<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to wireless communication systems and more<br>
particularly to in-home local area networking for content such as multimedia.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
With the number of households having multiple television sets increasing, and<br>
many users wanting the latest and greatest video viewing services, many households have<br>
multiple satellite receivers, cable set-top boxes, modems, et cetera. For in-home Internet<br>
access, each computer or Internet device has its own Internet connection. As such, each<br>
computer or Internet device includes a modem.<br>
As an alternative, an in-home wireless local area network (LAN) may be used to<br>
provide Internet access and to communicate multimedia information to multiple devices<br>
within the home. In such an in-home local area network, each computer or Internet<br>
device includes a network card to access a server. The server provides the coupling to<br>
the Internet. The in-home wireless local area network can also be used to facilitate an in-<br>
home computer network that couples a plurality of computers with one or more printers,<br>
facsimile machines, as well as to multimedia content from a digital video recorder, set-<br>
top box, broadband video system, etc.<br>
When transmitting realtime signals such as video or audio signals, quality of<br>
service must be maintained between transmitting and receiving stations to avoid drop-<br>
outs or other artifacts that detract from a users enjoyment when these signals are<br><br>
2<br>
rendered. Maintaining quality of service can be a challenge in the face of changing<br>
channel conditions.<br>

DETAILED DISCUSSION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
FIG. 1 presents a pictorial representation of a multimedia client server system in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The multimedia client server<br>
system includes multimedia server module 12, client modules 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42 that<br>
are coupled to clients 25, 26, 28, 30, and 32 and a plurality of multimedia sources. The<br>
multimedia sources include video cassette recorder (VCR) 86, digital video disk (DVD)<br>
player 82, digital video recorder (DVR) 102, digital audio storage device 104, DVD<br>
audio 106, radio receiver 108, CD player 110, public switch telephone network 66, wide<br>
area network 44 (such as a private network, public network, satellite network, cable<br>
network and/or the Internet) for accessing broadcast, stored or streaming audio, video<br><br>
3<br>
and/or other multimedia content and/or any other type of audio, video and/or multimedia<br>
source 24.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the clients 25, 26, 28, 30 and 32 may<br>
select playback from, and/or connection to, any one of the multimedia sources. The<br>
selection request from each client module would identify the desired multimedia source,<br>
the client, the desired service and any other information to assist the multimedia server<br>
module 12 in processing the request. As such, one client may be accessing the Internet,<br>
while another client is watching a satellite broadcast channel, while another is listening to<br>
a CD playback, while another is talking on the telephone, and yet another is watching a<br>
DVD playback. This is all done via the multimedia server module 12 without requiring<br>
the clients to have direct access to the multimedia sources and without the requirement<br>
that each client have its own multimedia source and/or multimedia source connection.<br>
The multimedia server module 12 and one or more of the client modules 34, 36,<br>
38, 40 and 42 include one or more features for increasing the reliability and quality of<br>
wireless transmission in accordance with the present invention, as will be described in<br>
greater detail in the figures that follow, and in particular, with reference to FIGs. 2-7.<br>
FIG. 2 presents a pictorial representation of a multimedia client/server system in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, a multimedia<br>
client/server system includes a multimedia server module 12, a plurality of client<br>
modules 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42 that are operably coupled to a plurality of clients 25, 26,<br>
28, 30, and 32. The multimedia server module 12 is operably coupled to receive a<br>
plurality of channels 46 from a multimedia source 23. The multimedia source 23 can be<br>
a broadcast, stored or steaming multimedia signal, from a video cassette recorder (VCR)<br>
86, digital video disk (DVD) player 82, digital video recorder (DVR) 102 digital audio<br>
storage device 104, DVD audio 106, radio receiver 108, CD player 110, public switch<br>
telephone network 66, wide area network 44 (such as a private network, public network,<br>
satellite network, cable network and/or the Internet for accessing broadcast, stored or<br>
streaming audio, video and/or other multimedia content) and/or any other type of audio,<br><br>
4<br>
video and/or multimedia source 24. As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the<br>
multimedia server module 12 may be a stand-alone device, may be incorporated in a<br>
satellite receiver, set-top box, cable box, HDTV tuner, home entertainment receiver, et<br>
cetera. In addition, the multimedia server module 12 may be implemented using discrete<br>
components, integrated circuits, and/or a combination thereof.<br>
The multimedia server module 12 communicates with the plurality of client<br>
modules 34, 36, 38, 40, and 42 via a radio frequency communication path. As such, the<br>
multimedia server module 12 and each of the client modules 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42 each<br>
include a transceiver that operates to send and receive data via the communication path.<br>
As shown, each client module is operably coupled to one of the clients. For<br>
example, client module 34 is operably coupled to client 26, which is representative of a<br>
personal digital assistant. Client module 36 is operably coupled to client 28, which is<br>
representative of a personal computer. Client module 38 is operably coupled to client 30,<br>
which is representative of a monitor (e.g., LCD monitor, flat panel monitor, CRT<br>
monitor, et cetera). Such a monitor may include speakers, or a speaker connection,<br>
control functions including channel select, volume control, picture quality, et cetera.<br>
Client module 40 is operably coupled to client 32, which may be a television set, high<br>
definition television (HDTV), standard definition television (SDTV), a home theatre<br>
system, et cetera. Client module 42 is operably coupled to client 25, which is<br>
representative of a laptop computer.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, each client module may be a<br>
separate device from its associated client or embedded within the client. In addition, one<br>
of average skill in the art will further appreciate that the client modules 34, 36, 38, 40 and<br>
42 may be implemented utilizing discrete components and/or integrated circuits.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, each of the clients, via its associated<br>
client module, selects one or more channels from the plurality of channels 46. As shown,<br>
client 26 has selected channel 3 of the plurality of channels for viewing. Accordingly,<br><br>
5<br>
client module 34 relays the channel selection of channel 3 to the multimedia server<br>
module 12. The multimedia server module 12 selects channel 3 from the plurality of<br>
channels 46. The data corresponding to channel 3 is then time multiplexed with the data<br>
for the other channels and transmitted from the multimedia server module 12 to each of<br>
the client modules 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42. Client module 34 monitors the transmission<br>
from the multimedia server module 12 and extracts the data corresponding to channel 3.<br>
The extracted data for channel 3 is then provided to the client 26 for display.<br>
Client module 36, 38, 40 and 42 perform a similar function for their associated<br>
clients 28, 30, 32 and 25, respectively. As shown, client 28 has selected channel 505,<br>
client 30 has selected channel 106, client 32 has selected channel 206 and client 25 has<br>
selected channel 9. The client modules 36, 38,40 and 42 provide the channel selection of<br>
its respective client to the multimedia server module 12. Multimedia server module 12<br>
extracts the selected channels from the plurality of channels for each selection request,<br>
multiplexes the data for each of the selected channels (for this example channel 3, 9,106,<br>
206 and 505) into a stream of data. The stream of data is then transmitted to each of the<br>
client modules. Each client module extracts the appropriate data of the selected channel<br>
for its respective client. For example, client module 36 monitors the transmitted data for<br>
data related to channel 505, client module 38 monitors for data related to channel 106,<br>
client module 40 monitors the transmission for data related to channel 206 and client<br>
module 42 monitors the transmission for data related to channel 9.<br>
From each client's prospective, the client 25, 26, 28, 30 and 32 has independent<br>
access to the multimedia source 23. Accordingly, client 26 may at any time change its<br>
channel selection from, for example, channel 3 to channel 120. The client module 34<br>
provides the channel selection request which may be the absence of acknowledgements to<br>
the multimedia server module 12, which now retrieves data related to channel 120 for<br>
client 36 as opposed to channel 3. As an alternate embodiment, the functionality of client<br>
modules 34, 36, 38,40 and 42 may vary. For example, client module 34 may not provide<br>
all the independent functionality that client module 36 does. For example, client module<br>
34 may not have independent channel selection capabilities but only selecting channels<br><br>
6<br>
that one of the other clients have selected. Alternatively, one client module may service a<br>
plurality of clients.<br>
FIG. 3 presents a block diagram representation of a multimedia client/server<br>
system 10 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, the<br>
multimedia client/server system 10 includes multimedia server module 12 that transmits a<br>
multimedia signal 214, such as a broadcast, stored or streaming signal from multimedia<br>
source 23. Multimedia server module 12 transmits, via antenna 206, a radio frequency<br>
(RF) signal that contain the multimedia content from multimedia signal 214. This RF<br>
signal is transmitted at a carrier frequency corresponding to a channel such as channel A<br>
of an RF spectrum over a wireless communication path to one or more client modules<br>
such as client module 200. Client module 200, (such as client modules 34, 36, 38, 40 and<br>
42) receives the RF signal via antenna 210 and produces a decoded output signal 216.<br>
It should be noted that channel A represents a channel of an RF spectrum<br>
corresponding to one or more carrier frequencies. This is as opposed to channels 3, 9,<br>
106, 206 and 505 discussed in association with FIG. 2 where "channel", is this context,<br>
was used primarily to denote different streams of multimedia content such as "The<br>
Weather Channel", "The Discovery Channel" or "Gone with the Wind". In the event<br>
that noise, interference or fading hamper the performance of one of the channels, the<br>
multimedia server module 12 can switch to a different channel.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the transmitted multimedia content<br>
can further be encrypted in the encoding process and decrypted in the decoding process,<br>
such as by RSA encryption, WEP, or protected using other secure access protocols such<br>
as MAC address filtering, so that if the content is wirelessly received by an authorized<br>
client device, the multimedia content can be otherwise protected. Multimedia server<br>
module 12 and client module 200 share secure access data during an initialization<br>
procedure in order to secure the wireless communications between these two devices.<br><br>
7<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the multimedia server module 12 adjusts<br>
the packet size, link data rate of the communication path and/or the range of the link data<br>
rate based on RF performance signal parameters that are measured or otherwise assessed<br>
by the multimedia server module 12 or that are received from a remote device such as<br>
one or more client modules 200. Further functions and features of the multimedia server<br>
module 12 and client module 200 including several alternative embodiments are<br>
presented in conjunction with FIGs. 4-7 that follow.<br>
FIG. 4 presents a block diagram representation of a circuit 125 for use in<br>
multimedia server module 12 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In particular, circuit 175 includes an encoder module 230 for producing an encoded<br>
signal 232 from an unencoded or encoded multimedia input signal 214. In an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the encoding scheme may be one or more of<br>
multilevel, multiphase and multifrequency encoding, orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiplexing OFDM, binary phase shift keying BPSK, quadrature phase shift keying<br>
QPSK, quadrature amplitude modulation such as 16 QAM, 64 QAM, 128 QAM, etc.,<br>
non-return to zero encoding, Manchester encoding, block encoding including reed<br>
soloman coding and other error correcting codes, convolutional coding, LDPC coding<br>
and/or nB/mB encoding wherein n &gt; m. For example, the nB/mB may be 4B/5B<br>
encoding where 4 bits of actual data are converted into 5 bits of encoded data.<br>
Encoding may further include compression, transrate and transcode encoding of<br>
the multimedia signal based on the content and format of multimedia signal 214 and the<br>
bandwidth and performance of channel A. In an embodiment, the multimedia signal 214<br>
includes an analog composite video signal that is formatted in any of a number of video<br>
formats including National Television Systems Committee (NTSC), Phase Alternating<br>
Line (PAL) or Sequentiel Couleur Avec Memoire (SECAM). The encoded signal 232<br>
may be digitized, compressed, and channel coded for transmission at low data rates in<br>
weak channel conditions or higher data rates in stronger channel conditions.<br>
Alternatively, multimedia signal 214 can be already in a digital format such as a Motion<br>
Picture Experts Group (MPEG) format (such as MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG4), a Society of<br><br>
8<br>
Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) standard such as VC1, H.264,<br>
Quicktime format, Real Media format, Windows Media Video (WMV) or Audio Video<br>
Interleave (AVI), or another digital video format, either standard or proprietary. In this<br>
case, the encoding performed by encoder module 230 may be limited to encoding of the<br>
data for the channel, based on the strength or quality of the channel conditions, with or<br>
without further compression.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, encoder module 230 generates an<br>
encoded signal 232 from the multimedia signal 214 that is in a digital format such as an<br>
MPEG, a Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) standard such as<br>
VC1, H.264, Quicktime format, Real Media format, Windows Media Video (WMV) or<br>
Audio Video Interleave (AVI), or another digital video format, either standard or<br>
proprietary. Transceiver module 234, in turn, produces RF signal 236 that includes the<br>
encoded signal 232, and wirelessly transmits the RF signal 236 to a client device, such as<br>
through client module 200. In an embodiment of the present invention, encoder module<br>
230 can operate as a transcoder to receive a multimedia signal 214 in a first digital<br>
format, decode this signal and re-encode it into a second digital format for transmission.<br>
For example, multimedia input 214 can include a compressed MPEG2/4 input. The<br>
encoder module 230 operates to decompress the signal and re-encode it in another format,<br>
such as H.264. In addition, encoder module 230 can receive a multimedia input signal<br>
that is in a digital format such as High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI). The<br>
encoder module 230 can compress and encode the digital signal into a compressed digital<br>
format.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the non-RF portions of the transceiver<br>
module 234 and the encoder module 230 can be implemented using a single processing<br>
device or a plurality of processing devices. Such a processing device may be a<br>
microprocessor, co-processors, a micro-controller, digital signal processor,<br>
microcomputer, central processing unit, field programmable gate array, programmable<br>
logic device, state machine, logic circuitry, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or any<br>
device that manipulates signals (analog and/or digital), optionally based on operational<br><br>
9<br>
instructions that are stored in a memory that may be a single memory device or a plurality<br>
of memory devices. Such a memory device can include a hard disk drive or other disk<br>
drive, read-only memory, random access memory, volatile memory, non-volatile<br>
memory, static memory, dynamic memory, flash memory, cache memory, and/or any<br>
device that stores digital information. Note that when the transceiver module 234 and/or<br>
encoder module 230 implement one or more of its functions via a state machine, analog<br>
circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry based on operational instructions, the<br>
memory storing the corresponding operational instructions may be embedded within, or<br>
external to, the circuitry comprising the state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry,<br>
and/or logic circuitry.<br>
Transceiver module 234 modulates the encoded signal 232 to produce a RF signal<br>
236 that includes multimedia content such as a packetized video signal at a first carrier<br>
frequency having a sequence of packets of an adjustable packet size. The transceiver<br>
module 234 transmits the RF signal 236 over channel A using antenna 206. In addition,<br>
transceiver module 234 produces back channel output 310 based on an RF signal<br>
received from the client module 200 over channel A. While not expressly shown,<br>
multimedia server module 12 includes a decoder module, such as decoder module 254<br>
that will be discussed in conjunction with FIG. 5, for operating the back channel in a<br>
reciprocal fashion.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, transceiver module 234 is selectively<br>
tunable to a plurality of other carrier frequencies in response to channel selection signal<br>
220. For instance, in an implementation of the multimedia server module 12 and client<br>
module 200 using wireless transmission link in the United States that conforms with the<br>
IEEE 802.1 lg standard, channel A can be selected as any of the 11 allocated channels. In<br>
an embodiment of the present invention, the channel selection signals can be<br>
preprogrammed into multimedia server module 12, "'dynamically chosen based on a site<br>
survey that scans the available channels to determine a suitable channel for use, received<br>
from the client module 200 or arbitrated between the client module 200 and multimedia<br>
server module 12, or selected under user control. Similarly, channel A can be<br><br>
10<br>
implemented as a channel of a broadband wireless access network that conforms to at<br>
least one of the following standards: 802.11a, b, g n or other 802.11 standard, Ultra<br>
Wideband (UWB), or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX).<br>
Transceiver module 234 includes secure access module 231 for securing the-RF<br>
communication link by optionally encrypting the encoded signal 232, password<br>
protecting the data or through other secure access protocol or methodology. While<br>
shown as part of transceiver module 234, quality of service module 231 and monitor<br>
module 233 can optionally be implemented as a stand alone module.<br>
In operation, monitor module 233 generates RF performance signals that are<br>
based on the performance of the wireless communication path. Such signals include<br>
measurements or other indications such as transmit power level; coding error rate, such as<br>
the rate of coding error generated by a cyclic redundency check (CRC), by other block<br>
codes that are either error detecting or error correcting codes and/or by other codes, such<br>
as convolutional codes, etc.; an air busy rate that indicates the frequency and/or<br>
occurrence of conditions when the transmitter desires to send data but determines that the<br>
channel is in use by another station; a received signal strength indication such as RSSI,<br>
signal to noise ratio, signal to interference ratio, signal power or other signal strength<br>
indication; a re-transmit rate, that indicates the frequency or occurrence of data<br>
retransmissions in response to either the lack of an acknowledgement or request for<br>
retransmission; and or other parameters indicative of the performance of the wireless<br>
communication path. Monitor module 233, monitors the conditions of transceiver<br>
module 234 and generates the RF performance signals that are passed to quality of<br>
service module 231.<br>
Quality of service module 231 receives the RF performance signals from monitor<br>
module 233 and/or from similar monitor modules of other devices such as client module<br>
200, x&gt;r other terminals in communication with multimedia server module 12 over the<br>
wireless channel and adjusts the link data rate, maximum data rate and/or packet size<br>
based on these RF performance signals, and optionally, based on adjustments made to the<br>
data rate based on these RF performance signals or other performance parameters of local<br><br>
11<br>
and remote transceivers such as streaming factors such as rending and receiving buffer<br>
levels, and decoding factors such as decoding buffer levels.<br>
In operation, quality of service module 231 operates to adjust the link data rate to<br>
maintain an acceptable level of quality for the transmission of video signals, audio<br>
signals, or other real-time multimedia communications between multimedia server<br>
module 12 and client module 200. For instance, if the coding error rate is rising, this may<br>
indicate the presence of an interfering station or other weak channel conditions and the<br>
quality of service module can lower the link data rate in response to these conditions and<br>
for the duration of these conditions. Similarly, a high air busy rate or re-transmit rate can<br>
lead to video interruptions and can require an adjustment to the link data rate. In<br>
addition, one or more RF performance signals can be used in setting the range of the link<br>
data rate, such as the maximum link data rate. In this fashion, a lower than normal RSSI<br>
can establish a lower maximum link data rate that serves to limit the rise of the link data<br>
rate, under high or rising conditions of the other RF performance signals, streaming<br>
signals, decoding signals, etc.<br>
Quality of service module 231 also operates to adjust the packet size used for<br>
transmission to one or more of the client modules in communication with multimedia<br>
server module 12, based on the local RF parameters, the RF parameters received from the<br>
corresponding client module and/or based on the data rate used for that particular client<br>
module. In this fashion, for lower data rates, or generally lower link performance caused<br>
by low signal to noise ratio, interference or other link parameters, the packet size can be<br>
shortened to increase the probability of correct reception of the packet and to potentially<br>
increase the throughput of the transmission under these conditions. For instance, in the<br>
presence of favorable channel conditions or as a default condition, a 2Kbyte packet size<br>
can be employed as a nominal packet size. However, certain conditions can be used by<br>
quality of service module 231 to reduce the packet size such as BERs, PERs and/or<br>
retransmit rates greater than 10% or greater than some other threshold indicating higher<br>
than desired error rates, a signal to noise ratio, signal to interference ratio, signal power or<br>
other signal strength indication that is below a threshold that corresponds to reliable<br><br>
12<br>
communication, and/or an high air busy rate can trigger a drop of the packet size, or a<br>
series of successive drops of the packet size if the these undesirable conditions persist, to<br>
lower sizes, such as 1600 bytes, 1200 bytes, 800 bytes, etc.<br>
Further, in the event that the undesirable conditions are eliminated, or are reduced<br>
to a level that corresponds to good performance threshold, the packet size can likewise be<br>
increased or increased in succession up to the largest packet size, if favorable conditions<br>
persist for a period of time. It should be noted that the thresholds used to increase and<br>
decrease the data rates can be implemented with hysteresis to avoid unnecessary toggling<br>
of the packet size in conditions that hover near a threshold.<br>
In a further mode of operation, adjustments of the data rate can be used either<br>
alone or in combination with other parameters to trigger adjustments to the packet size.<br>
For instance, a packet size of 2Kbytes can be used for data rates of 54 Mbps, with<br>
decreases in data rate being used to trigger lower packet rates. In another example,<br>
decreases in data rates coupled with a high air busy rate can be used to trigger a decrease<br>
in packet size. It should be note that the examples above represent only a few of the<br>
many possible combinations of these factors that can be employed by quality of service<br>
module 231 to select an appropriate data rate, packet size and/or data rate limit within the<br>
broad scope of the present invention.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the quality of service module 231<br>
includes a look-up table that stores link data rates, maximum link data rates and [packet<br>
sizes that are indexed by possible values of the RF performance signals for each of the<br>
client modules in communication with the multimedia server module 12. In this fashion,<br>
the maximum link data rate can be found based on the RF performance signals, such as<br>
RSSI, used to impact this parameter for each client module. Similarly, the packet size<br>
and/or link data rate can be determined by looking up these parameters in the table based -<br>
on the prevailing conditions of the remaining RF performance signals, streaming and/or<br>
decoding conditions. Further, one parameters such as the packet size can be tied to<br>
changes in one or another of the other parameters such as the link data rate or maximum<br><br>
13<br>
link data rate and determined based on one or more of these values alone or in<br>
combination with one or more of the RF parameters. The values of this look-up table can<br>
be determined by multiple measurements between a multimedia server module 12 and<br>
one or more client modules 200 at varying distances and under a range of difference<br>
channel conditions in a fashion that is determined to optimize actual quality or service<br>
during these particular operating conditions for each client module.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the quality of service module 231<br>
adjusts the link data rate and/or packet size based on the then current conditions on a<br>
packet-by-packet basis. In this fashion, rapid changes in channel conditions can be<br>
handled quickly on a near simultaneous basis. However, other schemes can also be<br>
employed by aggregating, averaging or filtering of either the RF performance signals or<br>
the link data rate and/or the packet size to adapt to changing conditions or implement<br>
changes more slowly or on a more limited basis.<br>
Quality of service module generates a packet size signal 235 that is sent to<br>
encoder module 230. Encoder module 230, in turn generates encoded signal 232 based<br>
on the selected packet size. In an embodiment of the present invention the encoder<br>
module encodes the multimedia signal 214 at a nominal packet size, such as the largest<br>
packet size and fragments the packets into smaller packet sizes if the packet size is<br>
reduced in response to the packet size signal 235. In this fashion, the fragmented packets<br>
received by the client module, such as client module 200 can be defragmented in the<br>
decoding process. In another embodiment, encoder module 230 can encode the encoded<br>
signal into a stream of packets of a size selected by the packet size signal 235, without<br>
first encoding into packets of nominal size.<br>
FIG. 5 presents a block diagram representation of a circuit 175 for use in client<br>
module" 200 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular,<br>
circuit 175 includes transceiver module 244 for receiving RF signal 246 over channel A<br>
or an alternate channel selected by multimedia server module 12 and for converting the<br>
RF signal 246 into a received encoded signal 248. In addition, transceiver module 244 is<br><br>
14<br>
operable to modulate back channel input 272 to produce RF signals sent to multimedia<br>
server module 12 over channel A. While not expressly shown, client module 200<br>
includes an encoder module, such as encoder module 230 for operating the back channel<br>
in a reciprocal fashion.<br>
As discussed in conjunction with FIG. 4, monitor module 233 generates RF<br>
performance signals that are based on the performance of the wireless communication<br>
path that are shared with transceiver module 244 for transmission to the multimedia<br>
server module 12. Further, quality of service module 231 is optionally operable to adjust<br>
the packet size, range of the link data rate and/or the link data rate, based on the RF<br>
performance parameters transmitted from this remote device for transmissions by client<br>
module 200.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, multimedia server module 12 and<br>
client module 200 use a wireless transmission link that conforms with the IEEE 802.1 lg<br>
standard that uses a 52-subcarrier orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)<br>
with a maximum data rate of 54 Mbits/sec. The data rate is reduced in increments in<br>
response to adverse channel conditions from 48 mbits/sec, down to as low as 6 Mbits/sec<br>
by modifying the modulation and effective coding rate from 64-quadrature amplitude<br>
modulation (64-QAM) to binary phase shift keying (BPSK). The 52 subcarriers of a<br>
channel are spaced 312.5 kHz apart, where 48 of the subcarriers carry data, and 4<br>
subcarriers carry pilot tones. Received encoded signal 248 can be a baseband signal or a<br>
low intermediate frequency (IF) signal.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, received encoded signal 248 can<br>
optionally be sent to decoder module 254 through a physical electronic connection such<br>
as Universal Serial Bus (USB), Personal Computer Interface (PCI), Firewire, or small<br>
computer service interface (SCSI), ASF (Asynchronous Serial Interface), or SPI(Serial<br>
Peripheral Interface). However, other physical electronic connections, either standard or<br>
proprietary may likewise be implemented or used within the broad scope of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
15<br>
Client module 200 further includes decoder module 254 for decoding the received<br>
encoded signal 248 into a decoded output signal 216, such as in a format used by the<br>
attached client. In particular, further decoding of the data can include defragmenting of<br>
received packets, decompression of a compressed digital signal, formatting of a video<br>
signal as in NTSC, PAL, SECAM, etc., and other formatting to match the input format of<br>
the client device. As discussed above, transceiver module 244 receives and demodulates<br>
RF signal 246 to produce a received encoded signal 248.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the non-RF portions of transceiver<br>
module 244 and the decoder module 254 can be implemented using a single processing<br>
device or a plurality of processing devices. Such a processing device may be a<br>
microprocessor, co-processors, a micro-controller, digital signal processor,<br>
microcomputer, central processing unit, field programmable gate array, programmable<br>
logic device, state machine, logic circuitry, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or any<br>
device that manipulates signals (analog and/or digital), optionally based on operational<br>
instructions that are stored in a memory that may be a single memory device or a plurality<br>
of memory devices. Such a memory device can include a hard disk drive or other disk<br>
drive, read-only memory, random access memory, volatile memory, non-volatile<br>
memory, static memory, dynamic memory, flash memory, cache memory, and/or any<br>
device that stores digital information. Note that when the transceiver module 244 and or<br>
decoder module 254 implement one or more of its functions via a state machine, analog<br>
circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry based on operational instructions, the<br>
memory storing the corresponding operational instructions may be embedded within, or<br>
external to, the circuitry comprising the state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry,<br>
and/or logic circuitry.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, transceiver module 244 is selectively<br>
tunable to a plurality of other carrier frequencies in response to channel selection signals<br>
224. For instance, in an implementation of the multimedia server module 12 and client<br>
module 200 using wireless transmission link in the United States that conforms with the<br><br>
16<br>
IEEE 802.1 lg standard, channel A can be selected as any two of the 11 allocated<br>
channels. In an embodiment of the present invention, the channel selection signals can be<br>
preprogrammed into client module 200, dynamically chosen based on a site survey that<br>
scans the available channels to determine two suitable channels for use, received from the<br>
multimedia server module 12 or arbitrated between the client module 200 and multimedia<br>
server module 12, or selected under user control.<br>

invention, other spectrum and other wireless links including Ultra Wideband (UWB),<br>

other circuit technologies, both integrated or non-integrated, may be used within the<br>
broad scope of the present invention.<br>
As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, the term "substantially" or<br>
"approximately", as may be used herein, provides an industry-accepted tolerance to its<br>
corresponding term and/or relativity between items. Such an industry-accepted tolerance<br>

and fall times, and/or thermal noise. Such relativity between items ranges from a<br>
difference of a few percent to order of magnitude differences. As one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will further appreciate, the term "coupled", as may be used herein, includes direct<br>
coupling and indirect coupling via another component, element, circuit, or module where,<br>

present invention, a module includes a functional block that is implemented in hardware,<br>
software, and/or firmware that performs one or more module functions such as the<br>

implements one or more of its functions via a state machine, analog circuitry, digital<br>
circuitry, and/or logic circuitry, the memory storing the corresponding operational<br>
