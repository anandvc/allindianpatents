				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the production of an olefin polymer,<br>
in particular a bimodal polymer of ethylene, using two different new single site<br>
catalyst components. It also relates to polymers produced by the process. The<br>
invention also relates to use of a catalyst to form polymers of the present<br>
invention. The catalyst is advantageous, since it facilitates performance of the<br>
process in a single reactor, producing a multimodal product having a highly<br>
crystalline, low molecular weight component, and a further component having low<br>
density. The catalyst system of the present invention can be used in gas phase,<br>
slurry, multizone circulating reactors (MZCR) and solution processes<br>
In many applications in which polyolefins are employed, it is desirable that the<br>
polyolefin used has good mechanical properties. It is known that, in general, high<br>
molecular weight polyolefins have good melt strength and good mechanical<br>
properties. Additionally, since the polyolefin must usually undergo some form of<br>
processing, such as injection or blow moulding processes, and extrusion<br>
processes and the like, to form the final product, it is also desirable that the<br>
polyolefin used has easy processing properties. However, unlike the mechanical<br>
properties of the polyolefin, its processing properties tend to improve as its<br>
molecular weight decreases, particularly in the absence of any long chain<br>
branching.<br>
Imparting potentially antagonistic properties such as easy processing and high<br>
melt strength, rigidity and toughness to high performance polyolefin resins has<br>
always posed serious challenges to scientists and engineers. It requires quite<br>
ingenious catalyst formulations and process-engineering design. Modern multi<br>
reactor, cascade process technologies employing state of the art catalysts have<br><br>
been used in an attempt to overcome the challenge. By judiciously controlling the<br>
conditions in each reactor, such as precise control of reactant concentrations,<br>
catalyst's residence time, and polymer block ratios, they enable sequential and<br>
in-situ production of polymer blends with intermingled chains of distinctly different<br>
lengths and compositions. In these so-called bimodal resins a compromise of<br>
counteracting properties may be reached.<br>
Cascade reactor technologies comprise in majority two stirred tank slurry reactors,<br>
two slurry loop reactors or two gas phase reactors in series. Processes also exist<br>
wherein a combination of a loop and a fluidised bed gas phase reactor is employed.<br>
Reactor design, configuration, and conditions governing different cascade processes<br>
are quite different and may vary substantially from process to process. They all have<br>
however one distinct feature: they ensure, in one of the in series configured reactors,<br>
the production of a high density low molecular mass polymer component and in the<br>
other reactor, the production of a high molecular mass low density polymer fraction.<br>
Major challenges in all varieties of cascade technologies are:<br>
1.	Frictionless, unidirectional transfer of monomer, diluents and product from the<br>
first reactor to the second reactor, to avoid reactors cross contamination.<br>
2.	Perfectly synchronized catalysts life and residence times to ensure intimate<br>
polymer intermixing and homogenisation.<br>
Additionally it is desired that the final bimodal exhibit well defined melt flow and<br>
density.<br>
Each cascade technology has its own specificity.<br>
- The stirred tank slurry process employs gaseous monomer, ethylene with<br>
hexane as the preferred solvent as disclosed for example in Boehm (J. Appl.<br>
Polym. Sci., 22, 279, 1984). Along with catalysts and co-catalyst hydrogen is<br>
fed into the first reactor to reduce the molecular mass in the first stage and<br>
butene is introduced into the second reactor to lower the density. The stirred<br>
tank technologies have simplified reactor design and are easy to operate. The<br><br>
low monomer partial pressure and long residence times require, however,<br>
very high catalysts activities and life times.<br>
-	In two slurry loop cascade processes, ethylene with a combination of<br>
butene/hexane or hexene/isobutane as co-monomer/solvent pair can be used.<br>
The reactors residence times are shorter and catalysts with moderate<br>
activities are tolerated. The major challenge in this type of processes is to<br>
prevent excess H2 or co-monomer to enter into the next reactor.<br>
-	A slurry loop reactor may be combined with a fluidised bed gas phase reactor<br>
as disclosed by Borealis. The first stage, loop reactor, insures rapid start up of<br>
the production. It uses propane in supercritical phase as diluent with the<br>
advantage of introducing a large quantity of hydrogen for the production of low<br>
molecular mass fraction without the risk of H2 bubble formation and reactor<br>
pressure instability. Additionally, polymer dissolution and reactor fouling<br>
issues are eliminated due to low solubility in propane whose critical<br>
temperature remains below polymer's melting point. The second stage, the<br>
gas phase reactor provides good density regulation and excellent product<br>
flexibility.<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalysts are predominantly used in cascade technologies. They fulfil<br>
conditions, such as moderate to high activities, good hydrogen response and co-<br>
monomer incorporation capability imposed by the cascade process. Their good<br>
thermal and chemical stability guarantees that they survive the relatively long overall<br>
residence times of the reactors. They produce however short polymer chains in the<br>
high molecular weight low-density fraction that remain in the amorphous phase, and<br>
do not contribute to tie molecules formation. Additionally, the branch rich, non-<br>
crystallisable low molecular weight material generally leads to de-mixing and phase<br>
separation and is not favourable to mechanical properties.<br>
Single site catalysts in general and metallocenes in particular are ideally suited to be<br>
used in cascade technologies for the production of both fractions of bimodal<br>
polyethylene. Selected bridged metallocene catalysts with excellent hydrogen<br>
response and co-monomer incorporation capabilities allow the easier production of<br><br>
the bimodal polyethylene without excessive use of hydrogen and co-monomer, and<br>
therefore with little or no risk of the second reactor contamination. Their application is<br>
particularly advantageous since their narrow disperse polymers, permit precise<br>
design of the composition of each fraction particularly that of the low density, high<br>
molecular mass fraction. In metallocene based copolymer the branches are<br>
statistically distributed and are very effective in assisting tie molecule formation and<br>
preventing chains longitudinal diffusion and lateral slippage.<br>
In cascade processes, polymer particle formation starts with catalyst particles being<br>
gradually fragmented by infused layers of high density and low-density polymer<br>
fractions in tandem reactors to finally become polymer particles. The solid-state<br>
morphology of the resulting polyethylene is that of a biphasic polymer alloy, in which<br>
the high-density, homo-polymer component acts as the matrix for the low-density<br>
copolymer part as can be seen in Figure 1. The high molecular mass copolymer<br>
chains traverse several crystalline and amorphous layers and interconnect adjacent<br>
crystalline lamellae as tie molecules. Tie molecules density is directly related to the<br>
chain length, molecular weight distribution (MWD), number and type of the side<br>
branches and the semi-crystalline morphology for a given lamellar thickness. They<br>
determine material's long- and short-term resistance to environmental and/or<br>
mechanical stress. In bimodal systems, the crystalline domain defines low strain rate<br>
of semi-crystalline polymers such as modulus, yield stress and slow crack growth<br>
properties whereas the amorphous region determines the high strain properties such<br>
as impact, tear and fracture resistance. The concentration of the tie molecules<br>
determines both the low and high strain rate behaviour. A high concentration of tie<br>
molecules can prevent or stop for example the brittle failure that is occasionally<br>
initiated, even at low stress, by a small crack and formation of a crazing zone. The<br>
crazing zone is formed by highly oriented fibrils under the applied stress<br>
concentration and is postulated to be due to disentanglement of tie molecules<br>
connecting the micro crystallites and fracture of the fibril. The resistance to fracture is<br>
thought to improve by incorporation of various types of branches the long branches<br>
being more effective. Branches are predominantly concentrated on tie-molecules<br>
that resist the chain pull out through the formation of micro-fibrils: they impede slow<br><br>
crack growth by reducing lamellar thickness and by decreasing the susceptibility to<br>
craze initiation and development. Branches also serve to pin-down tie molecules,<br>
which are a priori less mobile than their linear counterparts. The pinning of branches<br>
at the crystal fold surface and represented in Figure 2 is thought to be responsible<br>
for the very high fracture toughness of low density polyethylene (LDPE). High<br>
fracture toughness is achieved in the longest branched chains that form tie-<br>
molecules. It is also equally important to optimise fracture toughness by regularly<br>
spacing the branches, as for example in low-density polyethylene produced with<br>
metallocene. The inter branch spacing sets the upper boundary to the effective<br>
molecular weight for tie-molecules.<br>
The only disadvantage of using single site catalysts in cascade processes to<br>
produce bimodal polyolefin is the difficult homogenised extrusion due to very narrow<br>
molecular weight distribution of the two polymer fractions and to the lack of<br>
overlapping consisting of chains with intermediate molecular weight distribution. This<br>
is caused by non-ideal residence time distribution which isindependent of the<br>
catalytic system in use, and cause some catalyst grains to leave the firtst reactor<br>
without any polymerisation and some catalyst grains to stay too long to be solely<br>
covered with a single fraction. The only remedy for this problem is the use of dual<br>
(or multiple) site catalysts in a single reactor. In this case each catalyst particle will<br>
have the compositional ratio of the low and high molecular weight fraction which was<br>
pre-designed by the composition of its individual active sites. The close proximity of<br>
the two fractions makes the homogeneous extrusion possible.<br>
Production of polyolefm with a bimodal MWD in a single reactor has long been a goal<br>
of the polyolefin industry because single reactor configurations are significantly<br>
cheaper to build, have improved operability, and enable quicker product transitions<br>
than multi-reactor configurations. A single reactor can also be used to produce a<br>
broader range of products than can a set of cascaded reactors. Producing a resin<br>
having a bimodal MWD in a single reactor requires however highly sophisticated<br>
catalytic systems with at least two very different active site populations. It was<br>
thought that metallocenes, with their vast structural diversity, could provide highly<br><br>
chemo-selective active site structures with distinctly different hydrogen and co-<br>
monomer response and thereby provide a facile route to dual site catalysts. The area<br>
of dual site single reactor systems has been the object of a lot of efforts by the<br>
present applicant such as disclosed for example in US-A-6255428, EP-A-0790259,<br>
US-A-6410476, WO/03029302, US-A-6380311, US-A-5914289, EP-A-830395, or<br>
US-a-5719241. The method however still needs much improvement.<br>
List of Figures.<br>
Figure 1 represents the molecular weight distribution of a bimodal polyethylene resin<br>
and its relation to the dispersion of the low density fraction, represented by the dark<br>
areas, in the high density matrix, represented by the light areas.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic representation of semi-crystalline polyethylene.<br>
Figure 3 represents the log/log curve of stress as a function of time for a bimodal<br>
polyethylene, showing the transition between ductile and brittle behaviours.<br>
Many applications still require improved polyolefins and there is still a need to<br>
control the molecular weight distribution of the polyolefin products more closely,<br>
so that the miscibility of the polyolefin components can be improved, and thus<br>
the mechanical and processing properties of the polyolefins. In particular it is<br>
desirable to improve the catalyst system employed in the manufacture of<br>
multimodal polyolefins, in order to achieve these improvements in the polymers<br>
themselves.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to solve the problems associated with the<br>
above prior art by providing an improved catalyst system.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide an improved method for the<br>
formation of olefin polymers, employing new catalyst systems.<br><br>
It is a further object of the present invention to develop a method that is capable<br>
of forming multimodal, particularly bimodal, olefin polymers, preferably in a single<br>
reactor.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a catalyst composition for the<br>
production of a multimodal olefin polymer, that comprises:<br>
a) metallocene catalyst components of general formula (I):<br><br>
wherein Cp is a substituted or unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ring; C'p is a<br>
substituted fluorenyl ring; R" is a structural bridge between Cp and C'p imparting<br>
stereorigidity to the component; each R or R' is the same or different and is<br>
selected from a hydrocarbyl group having from 1-20 carbon atoms, a halogen,<br>
and two neighbouring substituents can be linked to form a cycle; M is a metal<br>
atom from group 4 of the Periodic Table; and each Q is a hydrocarbon having<br>
from 1-20 carbon atoms or is a halogen; m is an integer from 1 to 4 and n is an<br>
integer from 1 to 8<br>
or of formula (I')<br><br>
Wherein R", M, Q and R are as described above, Ind is an indenyl group and q is<br>
an integer from 1 to 6;<br>
b)) a single site polymerisation catalyst component of formula<br><br><br>
wherein R are the same and are alkyl groups having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R'<br>
and R" are the same or different and are selected from alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms or are substituted aryl, wherein the aryl can themselves be substituted with<br>
alkyls having 2 and from 4 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
An active catalyst system is prepared by adding an appropriate activating agent.<br>
The catalyst system of the present invention is used in the homo - or co-<br>
polymerisation of alpha-olefins. The polymers obtained with the catalyst system<br>
of the present invention have a bimodal or multimodal molecular weight<br>
distribution. The molecular weight distribution is defined by the polydispersity<br>
index that is the ratio Mw/Mn of the weight average molecular weight Mw over the<br>
number average molecular weight Mn.<br>
In a preferred embodiment according to the present invention, (CpRm) is a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl and (CpR'n) is a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted fluorenyl.<br>
In another more preferred embodiment according to the present invention, the<br>
metallocene component has Cs symmetry. More preferably, (CpRm) is an<br>
unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl and (CpR'n) is a fluorenyl substituted in positions<br>
3 and 6. Preferably, the substituents on the fluorenyl are the same and they are<br>
tert-butyl.<br>
In a further more preferred embodiment according to the present invention, the<br>
metallocene component(s) is (are) bridged bis-indenyl structure(s), preferably<br>
substituted in positions 2 and/or 4, or it is a bis-benzindenyl component and the<br>
cyclopentadienyl can be substituted at the distal and/or proximal positions.<br>
Bis-cyclopentadienyl catalyst components can also be used.<br><br>
The preferred metal M is hafnium.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, the metallocene component is a<br>
constrained geometry zirconocene or titanocene, more preferably it is a<br>
constrained geometry titanocene.<br>
The metallocene component is responsible for the high molecular weight<br>
component of the polyolefin, and hafnium is the preferred metal because it has<br>
excellent comonomer incorporation and inherently produces high molecular<br>
weight chains. The constrained geometry titanocene also produces high<br>
molecular weight chains.<br>
Any activating agent having an ionising action known in the art may be used for<br>
activating the metallocene component. For example, it can be selected from<br>
aluminium-containing or boron-containing compounds. The aluminium-containing<br>
compounds comprise aluminoxane, alkyl aluminium and/or Lewis acid.<br>
The aluminoxanes are well known and preferably comprise oligomeric linear<br>
and/or cyclic alkyl aluminoxanes represented by the formula:<br><br>
for oligomeric, linear aluminoxanes and<br><br><br>
for oligomeric, cyclic aluminoxane,<br>
wherein n is 1-40, preferably 10-20, m is 3-40, preferably 3-20 and R is a C1-C8<br>
alkyl group and preferably methyl.<br>
Suitable boron-containing activating agents that can be used comprise a<br>
triphenylcarbenium boronate such as tetrakis-pentafluorophenyl-borato-<br>
triphenylcarbenium as described in EP-A-0427696, or those of the general<br>
formula [L'-H] + [B An Ar2 X3 X4]- as described in EP-A-0277004 (page 6, line 30<br>
to page 7, line 7).<br>
Aluminoxane activating agents are known to have a detrimental action when the<br>
metal used in the metallocene component is hafnium. It is believed that the<br>
presence of trimethylaluminium (TMA) in methylaluminoxane (MAO) is<br>
responsible for the low activity of the hafnium-based metallocene catalyst<br>
systems by producing a non-active bimetallic stable intermediate. TMA free<br>
modified MAO should be used (MMAO).<br>
If a sterically hindered Lewis base is added to MAO, TMA can be trapped and<br>
thus be prevented from interacting with the cationic species. A sterically hindered<br>
organic Lewis base is an organic compound containing at least one atom having<br>
at least one free electron pair and in which this atom or these atoms has or have<br>
at least one directly adjacent group which largely shields it and which can cause<br>
steric hindrance. The most preferred sterically hindered Lewis base is a bulky<br>
phenol.<br>
The aluminoxane and Lewis base are mixed together and left to react for a period<br>
of time of from 30 minutes to 2 hours, preferably about one hour in order to reach<br>
equilibrium.<br><br>
Alternatively an activating agent based on borate can be used when metal M is<br>
hafnium.<br>
In a preferred embodiment according to the present invention, metal Me in the<br>
single site component (L)nMe(Q')p is preferably Fe.<br>
The preferred single site component according to the present invention is a<br>
compound of formula V<br><br>
wherein R are the same and are alkyl groups having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms,<br>
preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms and more preferably methyl groups, R' and R" are<br>
the same or different and are alkyl groups having from 1 a 20 cabon atoms<br>
substituted or unsubstituted or aryl groups having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms<br>
substituted ou unsubstituted.<br>
Preferably, R' and R" are the same or different and are selected from a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or are a<br>
unsubstituted or substituted aryl. The aryls group can themselves be substituted<br>
with alkyls having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or with substituted or unsubstituted<br>
aryls having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. More preferably, R' and R" are different<br>
and comprise substituted phenyls. Most preferably, R' is a phenyl substituted with<br><br>
methyls in positions 2 and 6 and R" is an anyline substituted by two phenyls,<br>
each being substituted by a tert-butyl.<br>
The steric environment of the iron-based complex(es) is determined by the<br>
substituents at positions 2 and 6 and optionally at positions 3, 4 and 5 on the<br>
phenyls.<br>
For the steric effect, the preferred substituents on the phenyls, if present, can be<br>
selected from tert-butyl, isopropyl, methyl or phenyl. The most preferred substituents<br>
are methyls respectively at positions 2 and 6 for R' and phenyls respectively a<br>
positions 2 and 6 for R", each phenyl being substituted with a tert-butyl.<br>
Preferably, the monomer used in the polymerisation reaction is ethylene.<br>
When iron-based single site complex(es) are used in the copolymerisation of<br>
ethylene with a comonomer, it is observed that the comonomer is not incorporated in<br>
the backbone of the polymer chain. A highly crystalline ethylene polymer without<br>
branches is obtained. The molecular weight of the polymer is however reduced and it<br>
is believed that the comonomer acts as a chain transfer agent. The comonomer is an<br>
alpha-olefin having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably it is hexene and is used<br>
both for molecular weight regulation for high density polymer fraction and density<br>
regulation of the high molecular weight polymer fraction.<br>
The combination of a hafnium-based metallocene catalyst component and of an iron-<br>
based new single site catalyst component is thus particularly beneficial in the<br>
production of bimodal polyethylene.<br>
-	The hafnium-based component(s), responsible for the high molecular weight<br>
fraction of the polymer, is very efficient in comonomer incorporation and<br>
produces a low density high molecular weight component.<br>
-	The iron-based single site component(s), responsible for the low molecular<br>
weight fraction of the polymer in the presence of a comonomer does not<br>
require the presence of hydrogen to terminate the chains.<br><br>
The hafnium-based component can be replaced by a constrained geometry<br>
titanocene.<br>
Increasing the comonmer concentration thus simultaneously reduces the density of<br>
the high molecular weight fraction and reduces the molecular weight of the low<br>
molecular weight fraction.<br>
Instead of introducing the comonomer in the reaction zone, an oligomerisation<br>
catalyst system may be added for preparing the comonomer in situ. Oligomerisation<br>
catalysts systems are known by the man skilled in the art. Among the preferred<br>
oligomerisation catalyst system, one can cite for example the octanuclear nickel<br>
complex disclosed in international patent application PCT/EP2004/002145.<br>
The invention also discloses a method for preparing a catalyst system that<br>
comprises the steps of:<br>
a) providing first metallocene-based catalyst component(s) of formula I<br><br>
wherein Cp is a substituted or unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ring; C'p is a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ring R" is a structural bridge<br>
between Cp and C'p imparting stereorigidity to the component; each R or R' is<br>
the same or different and is selected from a hydrocarbyl group having from 1-20<br>
carbon atoms, a halogen, an alkoxy group, an alkoxyalkyl group, an alkylamino<br>
group or an alkylsilylo group and two neighbouring substituents can be linked to<br>
form a cycle; M is a metal atom from group 4 of the Periodic Table; and each Q is<br>
a hydrocarbon having from 1-20 carbon atoms or is a halogen<br>
or of formula (I')<br><br><br>
wherein R", Cp, M, Q and Rm are as defined previously and X is an heteroatom,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted and selected from Group 15 or 16 of the periodic<br>
table, preferably, N, P or O<br>
b)	and providing single site catalyst component(s) of formula (II):<br><br>
wherein L is an heteroatom-containing ligand; n is an integer of 1, 2, or 3; Me is<br>

d)	providing an activating agent;<br>

f)	optionally providing a support;<br>
g)	retrieving an active catalyst system.<br>
The catalyst components are preferably supported on the same or different<br>
supports.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for producing a polyolefin having a<br>
multimodal molecular weight distribution, the process generally comprising the<br>
steps of:<br>
(a)	polymerising an olefin monomer and optional comonomer in the<br>
presence of a first catalyst, to form a first polyolefin component; and<br>
(b)	polymerising the same olefin monomer and optional comonomer in<br>
the presence of a second catalyst to form a second polyolefin<br>
component.<br><br>
In the method of the invention, the molecular weight distribution of the first<br>
polyolefin component overlaps with the molecular weight distribution of the<br>
second polyolefin component, thus forming a polymer product that has at least a<br>
bimobal molecular weight distribution.<br>
Thus, the present invention utilises at least two catalyst components (or two<br>
population of active sites) for producing at least two polymer components, each<br>
component forming part of the multimodal polymeric product. It is preferred that<br>
at least two catalyst systems are employed, and a bimodal or broad molecular<br>
weight distribution polymer product is produced. However, the invention is not<br>
limited to bimodal products only, and multimodal polymers may be produced if<br>
desired.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present method, the polymerising<br>
steps (a) and (b) take place in a single reaction zone, under polymerising<br>
conditions in which the catalysts producing the polymer components are<br>
simultaneously active.<br>
Many known procedures for forming multimodal polyolefins have employed a<br>
different reactor for forming each component. The methods of the present<br>
invention are particularly advantageous, since they allow for the production of<br>
improved olefin polymers from a single reactor. This is because the catalysts<br>
employed in the present invention are more effective than known catalysts,<br>
particularly when utilised simultaneously in the same reactor. This has two<br>
distinct advantages. Firstly, since only a single reactor is required, production<br>
costs are reduced. Secondly, since the components are all formed<br>
simultaneously, they are much more homogeneously blended than when<br>
produced separately.<br>
Although polymerisation in a single reactor is particularly preferred, the catalysts<br>
employed in the present invention are still particularly effective in producing the<br><br>
Preferred solvents include mineral oils and the various hydrocarbons which are<br>
liquid at reaction temperature and which do not react with the individual<br>
ingredients. Preferably, the support material is slurried in toluene and the<br>
catalyst components and activating agent are dissolved in toluene prior to<br>
addition to the support material.<br>
The present invention also provides an olefin polymer, obtainable according to a<br>
method as defined above. The most preferred polymer obtainable according to<br>
the present invention is high density polyethylene (HDPE).<br>
Also provided is the use of a dual catalyst system for producing an olefin<br>
polymer.<br>
Resins having a bimodal molecular weight distribution can be used in high density,<br>
blown film, application where they offer an attractive combination of Theological<br>
properties in terms of shear response, low die swell, and high melt strength and of<br>
physico- mechanical properties such as clarity/low gel, tear strength, Environmental<br>
Stress Crack Resistance (ESCR). They further offer a good compromise of stiffness<br>
and impact resistance. These high-density polyethylene (HDPE) films are easy to<br>
process and allow down gauging and cost saving measures.<br>
Blow moulding grades have excellent processing capabilities because of their low<br>
die swell and high melt strength. They also have good mechanical properties in<br>
terms of stiffness and ESCR. The containers prepared with the resins of the present<br>
invention can thus have thin walls, thereby requiring less material, and yet evince the<br>
resins having the best combination of top-load and ESCR.<br>
Pressure pipe for natural gas and drinking water distribution, is another fast growing<br>
application for bimodal HDPE. The performance criteria for pressure pipes are<br>
processability during the extrusion through annular dies as well as short and long<br>
term performance properties requiring resistance to environmental (chemical and<br><br>
required polyolefin components of a multimodal product even when these<br>
components are produced in separate reactors. Accordingly, in some<br>
embodiments, separate reactors may be employed for forming some or all of the<br>
components, if desired.<br>
Although the invention may be applied to any olefin polymerisation, the olefin<br>
monomer employed typically comprises ethylene and/or propylene. Bimodal or<br>
multimodal polyethylene is the most preferred product.<br>
The catalyst systems employed in the present invention may be employed in any<br>
type of co-polymerisation method, provided that the required catalytic activity is<br>
not impaired. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the catalyst<br>
system is employed in a slurry process, which is heterogeneous. Preferred<br>
supports include a porous solid support such as talc, inorganic oxides and<br>
resinous support materials such as polyolefin. Preferably, the support material is<br>
an inorganic oxide in its finely divided form.<br>
Suitable inorganic oxide materials are well known in the art. Preferably, the<br>
support is a silica support having a surface area of from 200-700 m2/g and a pore<br>
volume of from 0.5-3 ml/g.<br>
The amount of activating agent and metallocene usefully employed in the<br>
preparation of the solid support catalyst can vary over a wide range and depend<br>
upon the nature of the activating agent.<br>
The order of addition of the catalyst components and activating agent to the<br>
support material can vary. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention activating agent dissolved in a suitable inert hydrocarbon<br>
solvent is added to the support material slurried in the same or other suitable<br>
hydrocarbon liquid and thereafter a mixture of the catalyst components is added<br>
to the slurry.<br><br>
mechanical) stress ESCR, Slow Crack Growth (SCG), and Rapid Crack Propagation<br>
(RCP). They must compete with incumbent materials such as concrete and steel<br>
having long service lives of over 50 years.<br>
High performance pipes produced with the bimcdal resin according to the present<br>
invention have the ability to resist short and long term failure mechanism such as<br>
growth of an incidental crack in the pipe over Iong periods of time under constant<br>
pressure (SCG), and resistance to RCP as a results of impact of a sharp object<br>
(impact failure). Additionally and most importantly, they exhibit high creep rupture<br>
strength (high modulus, high stiffness). The service lifetime is estimated via Long-<br>
Term Hydrostatic Strength (LTHS) that is determined by Minimum Required Stress<br>
(MRS) tests. These tests require a series of pressure/failure time curves established<br>
at different temperatures with a number of pipes having prescribed length, diameter<br>
and wall thickness. Calculations and extrapolations are then carried out following the<br>
method developed by Schulte (U. Schulte in 100 Jahre Lebensdauer; Kunststoffe,<br>
87, p. 203, 1997.), and a Hooks stress/ service ;ime curve of well over 50 years at<br>
20°C is obtained. The curve, represented in Figure 3, exhibits three distinct regions.<br>
After a short experiment time, a flat region in which at high stress the tested pipes<br>
failed in a ductile mode. After a very long experiment time, another region<br>
characterised by a very steep descent, during which the tested pipes, via a thermo-<br>
oxidative initiated change, failed in brittle mode. In between, there is a less<br>
pronounced intermediate region characterized by a ductile/ brittle transition "knee".<br>
According to current results, metallocene based PE100 resin with ideal balance in<br>
fractional polymer properties has service life times of over a century. The<br>
classification PE100 is based on MRS at a temperature of 80°C, a pressure of 5 Mpa<br>
for a period of time of 1000h according to the method of the ISO norm TR 9080.<br><br><br>
