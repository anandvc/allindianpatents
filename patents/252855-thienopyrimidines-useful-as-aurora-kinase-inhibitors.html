THIENOPYRIMIDINES USEFUL AS A URORA KINASE INHIBITORs<br>
PRIORITY<br>
[0001]	The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application Nos.: 60/632,568 filed December 1, 2004 and 60/588,718 filed July 16, 2004; The entire contents of each of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by a better understanding of the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules associated with diseases. One important class of enzymes that has been the subject of extensive study is protein kinases.<br>
[0003]	Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related<br>
enzymes that are responsible for the control of a variety of signal transduction processes within the cell. (See, Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. Tlie Protein Kinase Facts Book, I and II, Academic Press, San Diego, CA: 1995). Protein kinases are thought to have evolved from a common ancestral gene due to the conservation of their structure and catalytic function. Almost all kinases contain a similar 250-300 amino acid catalytic domain. The kinases may be categorized, into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families (See, for example, Hanks, S.K., Hunter, T., FASEB J. 1995, 9, 576-596; Rnighton et al., Science 1991, 253, 407-414; Hiles et al, Cell 1992, 70, 419-429; Kunz et al, Cell 1993, 73, 585-596; Garcia-Bustos et al, EMBO J. 1994, 13, 2352-2361).<br>
[0004] In general, protein kinases mediate intracellular signaling by effecting a phosphoryl transfer from a nucleoside triphosphate to a protein acceptor that is involved in a signaling pathway. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches that can modulate or regulate the target protein biological function. These phosphorylation events are ultimately triggered in response to a variety of extracellular and other stimuli. Examples of such stimuli include environmental and chemical stress signals (e.g., osmotic shock, heat shock, ultraviolet radiation, bacterial endotoxin, and H2O2), cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-#a)), and growth factors (e.g., granulocyte naacrophage-colony-stimulating<br><br>
WO 2006/036266	PCT/US2005/025340 .<br>
factor (GM-CSF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)). An extracellular stimulus may affect one or more cellular responses related to cell growth, migration, differentiation, secretion of hormones, activation of transcription factors, muscle contraction, glucose metabolism, control of protein synthesis, and regulation of the cell cycle.<br>
[0005] Many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events as described above. These diseases include, but are not limited to, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma, Alzheimer's disease, and hormone-related diseases. Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective as therapeutic agents. [0006] The Aurora family of serine/threonine kinases plays an important role in cell proliferation. The three known mammalian family members, Aurora-A ("1"), B ("2") and C ("3"), are highly homologous proteins responsible for chromosome segregation, mitotic spindle function and cytokinesis. Aurora expression is low or undetectable in resting cells, with expression and activity peaking during the G2 and mitotic phases in cycling cells. Elevated levels of all Aurora family members are observed in a wide variety of tumor cell lines. For example, the Aurora-2 protein has been found to be overexpressed in human colon cancer tissue [Bischoff et al, EMBO J. 1998, 17, 3052-3065; Schumacher et al, J. Cell Biol. 1998, 143, 1635-1646; Kimura et al, J. Biol. Chem. 1997,272,13766-13771]. Aurora-2 has teen implicated in human cancer, such as colon, breast and other solid tumors. This kinase is involved in protein phosphorylation events that regulate the cell cycle. Specifically, Aurora-2 plays a role in controlling the accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. Thus, Aurora inhibitors have an important role in the treatment of Aurora-mediated diseases.<br>
[0007] Accordingly, there is a great need to develop compounds useful as inhibitors of protein kinases. In particular, it would be desirable to develop compounds that are useful as inhibitors of Aurora, particularly given the inadequate treatments currently available for the majority of the disorders implicated in their activation.<br>

WO 2006/036266		PCT/US2005/025340 <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] As discussed above, there remains a need for the development of novel therapeutic agents and agents useful for treating disorders mediated by Aurora. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides novel compounds having the structure:<br>

[0009] In certain other embodiments, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an inventive compound, wherein the compound is present in an amount effective to inhibit Aurora activity. In certain other embodiments, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an inventive compound and optionally further comprising an additional therapeutic agent. In yet other embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is an agent for the treatment of cancer. [0010] In yet another aspect, the present invention provides methods for inhibiting kinase activity {e.g., Aurora) activity in a patient or a biological sample, comprising administering to said patient, or contacting said biological sample with an effective inhibitory amount of a compound of the invention. In still another aspect, the present invention provides methods for treating any disorder involving Aurora activity, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention.<br>

[0293] In yet another aspect, a method for the treatment or lessening the severity of an Aurora-mediated disease or condition is provided comprising administering an effective amount of a compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a compound to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments of the present invention an "effective amount" of the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable composition is that amount effective for treating or lessening the severity of an Aurora-mediated disease or condition. The compounds and compositions, according to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for treating or lessening the severity of an Aurora-mediated disease or condition. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression "dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety<br>
86<br><br>
WO 2006/036266	PCT/US2005/025340<br>
of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts. The term "patient", as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human.<br>
[0294] The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. [0295] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. [0296] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition,<br>
87<br><br>
WO 2006/036266	PCT/US2005/025340<br>
sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
[0297] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.<br>
[0298] In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. [0299] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
[0300] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalrium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and<br>
88<br><br>
WO 2006/036266		PCT/US2005/025340<br>
acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disinte,grating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixture,s thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. [0301] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like. [0302] The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredients) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.<br>

[0303] Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a phannaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
[0304] As described generally above, the compounds of the invention are useful as inhibitors of protein kinases. In one embodiment, the compounds and compositions of the invention are Aurora kinase inhibitors, and thus, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the compounds and compositions are particularly useful for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where activation of Aurora lcinase is implicated in the disease, condition, or disorder. When activation of Aurora kinase is implicated in a particular disease, condition, or disorder, the disease, condition, or disorder may also be referred to as "Aurora-mediated disease" or disease symptom. Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where activation of Aurora lcinase is implicated in the disease state.<br>
[0305] The activity of a compound utilized in this invention as an Aurora kinase inhibitor, may be assayed in vitro, in vivo or in a cell line. In vitro assays include assays that determine inhibition of either the phosphorylation activity or ATPase activity of activated Aurora A, B and/or C. Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the inhibitor to bind to Aurora A, B and/or C. Inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabelling the inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/Aurora A, B and/or C, complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound. Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be determined by running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are incubated with Aurora A, B and/or C bound to known radioligands.<br>

[0306] The term "measurably inhibit", as used herein means a measurable change in Aurora A, B and/or C activity between a sample comprising said composition and a Aurora A, B and/or C kinase and an equivalent sample comprising Aurora A, B and/or C kinase in the absence of said composition.<br>
[0307] The term "Aurora-mediated disease" or "Aurora-mediated condition", as used herein, means any disease or other deleterious condition in which Aurora is known to play a role. The terms "Aurora-mediated disease" or "Aurora-mediated condition" also mean those diseases or conditions that are alleviated by treatment with an Aurora inhibitor. Such conditions include, without limitation, colon, breast, stomach, and ovarian cancer. The term "Aurora-mediated disease", as used herein, means any disease or other deleterious, condition or disease in which Aurora is known to play a role. Such diseases or conditions include, without limitation, cancers such as colon and breast cancer.<br>
[0308] It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another agent used to treat the same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects). As used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to treat or prevent a particular disease, or condition, are known as "appropriate for the disease, or condition, being treated".<br>
[0309] For example, other therapies, chemotherapeutic agents or other anti-proliferative agents may be combined with the compounds of this invention to treat proliferative diseases and cancer. Examples of therapies or anticancer agents that may be used in combination with th.e inventive anticancer agents of the present invention include surgery, radiotherapy (in but a few examples, gamma-radiation, neutron beam radiotherapy, electron beam radiotherapy, proton therapy, brachytherapy, and systemic radioactive isotopes, to name a few), endocrine therapy,<br>

blood disorders such as corticosteroids, anti-leukemic agents, and growth factors; and agents for treating immunodeficiency disorders such as gamma globulin. [0311] The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that agent as the only therapeutically active agent. [0312] The compounds of this invention or pharmaceuticalry acceptable compositions thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating implantable medical devices, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Accordingly, the present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an implantable device comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. In still another aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated with a composition comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. [0313] Vascular stents, for example, have been used to overcome restenosis (re-narrowing of the vessel wall after injury). However, patients using stents or other implantable devices risk clot formation or platelet activation. These unwanted effects may be prevented or mitigated by pre-coating the device with a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a kinase inhibitor. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are described in US Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polynaethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of fiuorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to impart controlled release characteristics in the composition. [0314] Another aspect of the invention relates to inhibiting Aurora A, B and/or C activity in a biological sample or a patient, which method comprises administering to the patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound of formula I or a ' composition comprising said compound. The term "biological sample", as used<br>

The pH of these formulations can also also be varied to identify a range for optimal solubility. [0648] Target Modulation studies.<br>
[0649] Nu/nu mice were subcuntaneously injected into their hind flank with human HCT-116 cells and 50% Matrigel (Becton-Dickinson). Human HCT-116 tumors were then allowed to grow to 400 mm3. The tumor bearing mice were then either given an administration of SPD or vehicle (Sigma-Aldrich) (orally, intravenously or intraperitoneally). At prescribed time points post dose, mice were anesthetized and blood taken via terminal cardiac piuncture, and sacrificed. The HCT-116 tumors were excised from the mice, pulverized using liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar and pestle, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tumor lysates were made from the pulverized samples by addition of lysis buffer.<br>
[0650] For detection of response markers by Western blotting, the protein concentration of the lysates was determined by colorimetric detection. Twenty-five micrograms of protein was loaded per lane on an SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed using anti-Histone H3 and anti-phosphorylated Histone H3 antibodies, (both from Cell Signaling Technology) [0651] Maximum Tolerated Dose studies.<br>
[0652] Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which the mouse is no longer able to function normally and is determined by either significant toxicity (eg. body weight loss) or mortality. Mice (nu/nu) were sorted according to weight and randomized into groups prior to being dosed with a test compound, by oral, intravenous or intraperitoneal routes. Escalating doses of a test cmpound were used. Animal weights were measured daily for 5 days and about every 3 days after that until the animal was removed from the study due to body weight loss of &gt; 20% or any alterations in physiological function that would affect normal function. Clinical observations were performed throughout the study to note any toxicity and mice were monitored until the end of the study. [0653] Efficacy studies.<br>

WO 2006/036266	PCT/US2005/025340<br>
[0654] Nu/nu mice were subcuntaneously injected into their hind flank with human HCT-116 cells and 50% Matrigel (Becton-Dickinson). Human HCT-116 tumors were allowed to grow to 150-200 mm3. The tumor bearing mice were then either given an administration of a test compound or a vehicle control. The tumor dimensions (length [1 mm] and width [w mm]) were measured by electronic calipers and the tumor volume (mm3) determined from the equation ([w2 X1] -+-2). Weights of the mice and their respective tumor volumes were measured twice weekly until the animal was removed from the study, either because there was a body weight loss of greater than 20% or a tumor volume greater than 2000 mm3. Clinical observations were performed throughout the study, which usually lasted for up to 70 days after the initial implantation of the tumor cells. Tumor volume increases were compared to negative (vehicle) and positive controls. Percentage tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated from the equation [(tumor volume T - tumor volume)-+-tumor volume C] x 100, where T = treatment group and C = control or vehicle group. The tumor volume for both groups was usually determined at defined times after the administration of the last dose of compound. Survival plots (Kaplan-Maier) were also performed to examine the pattern of survival.<br>
