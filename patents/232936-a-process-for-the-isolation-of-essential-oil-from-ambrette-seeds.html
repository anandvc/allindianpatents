				<td>This invention relates to a process for isolation of essential oil from ambrette seeds. This invention leads to the production of ambrette essential oil in higher yields and as close to the composition as its natural occurrence with little or minimum production of side products and with a superior flavour value.<br>
Abelmoschus moschatus Linn Syn. Hybiscus Abelmoschus of family Malvaceae, popularly known as ambrette is native to India. It is cultivated in tropical regions of Asia, Africa and South America mainly for seeds, which have a characteristic musk odour. The essential oil is widely used as a fixative in fragrance formulations. The liquid oil is a valuable adjunct to high grade perfume compositions to which it imparts a strong and characteristic musk note. It possesses a much smoother note than synthetic musk compounds. The liquid oil of commerce is noted for its rich, sweet floral-musky distinctly wine like odor with a bouquet and 'roundness' rarely found in any other perfumery material and a tenacity of odour that is almost incredible. While the synthetic musk compounds have been shown to cause photo sensitivity and dermatitis in sensitive individuals, the extracts of ambrette seeds have been classified as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) for use in baked foods, candies and alcoholic beverages. Abrettolide and farnesyl acetate are reported to be non-toxic.<br>
The product of commerce presently available is the essential oil obtained by steam distillation of crushed or uncrushed seeds, which immediately after distillation possesses a disagreeable note. It needs to be stored for several months before it matures and becomes suitable for use in blending.<br>
Another procedure described in the literature are extraction of crushed seeds with halogenated solvents CH2CC12 or forane and hydro distillation of the oleoresin. A third<br><br>
procedure comprises of extraction of coarsely broken seeds with rectified spirit and partial separation of lipids by chilling at 0° C.<br>
In the hitherto known processes, especially the first two, the essential oil is obtained by direct hydro distillation of seeds or its oleoresin involving direct contact with steam. They produce essential oils containing high amounts of farnesol obtained by hydrolysis of the major constituent farnesyl acetate. Abrettolide(s) responsible for the characteristic musk odour also gets partly hydrolysed. These data is presented in the following table.<br>
 Recovery of Essential oil of Ambrette seeds by different methods:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a cold process for the<br>
extraction of fragrance components in ambrette seeds and their isolation as<br>
close to the nature as possible and in improved yields.<br>
The novelty in the present invention resides in the production of fragrant<br>
essential oil from ambrette seeds, in higher yields and in superior quality close<br>
to its natural occurrence, and suitability of the extracted seeds for recovery of<br>
fatty oil.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the isolation of<br>
essential oil from ambrette seeds which comprises:<br>
extracting the ambrette seeds with a low molecular weight C-i - C4 alcoholic<br>
solvent in a solid to liquid ratio ranging from 1:2 to 1:7 in a reactor under<br>
stirring for a period of 1 to 8 hrs at a temperature ranging between 20° - 30°C,<br>
removing the solvent from the above said alcoholic extract under vacuo to<br>
obtain the oleoresin followed by liquid-liquid extraction of the said oleoresin<br>
with a hydrocarbon or a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent as herein described<br>
to isolate the essential oil from the polar glycosides and pectins, purifying the<br>
above said essential oil by treating it with a suitable adsorbent   as defined<br>
herein and further removing the solvent under vacuo to obtain the desired<br>
essential oil with a superior odour profile.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the alcoholic solvent used is<br>
selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, propanols and<br>
butanols.i <br>
In yet another embodiment wherein the extraction is carried out using a co current or a counter current flow.<br>
In yet another embodiment the solvent used for liquid-liquid extraction of the oleoresin is selected from the group consisting of pentane, hexane, heptane, dichloro methane and carbon tetrachloride.<br>
In yet another embodiment the adsorbent used is selected from the group consisting of active charcoal, Fuller's earth, silica gel and alumina.<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
A mixture of 1 kg of air dried ambrette seeds and 3 litres of methanol are stirred in a reactor for 6 hours at 25°C. The methanolic extract and raffinate seeds are separated by filtration and the methanol is recovered by distillation under vacuo. The oleo resin thus obtained weighed 12g. Liquid-liquid extraction of the residue with 60 ml of dichloromethane gave a predominantly non-polar fraction. The solution thus obtained is treated with 5 grams of silica gel and the solution separated from the adsorbent. Complete removal of the dichloromethane solvent afforded 2.9 g. of a colourless to pale yellow oil with a sweet pleasant odour, completely devoid of unpleasant odours. The oil can be used immediately in blending and needs no maturing.<br><br>
Example-2<br>
A mixture of 1 kg of air dried ambrette seeds and 3 litres of methanol are stirred in a reactor for 4 hours at 300C,  The methanolic extract and raffmate seeds are separated by filtration and the methanol is recovered by distillation under vacuo. The oleo resin thus obtained weighed 1 Ig. Liquid-liquid extraction of the residue with 60 ml of hexane gave a predominantly non-polar fraction. The solution thus obtained is treated with 5 grams of silica gel and the solution separated from the adsorbent. Complete removal of the hexane solvent afforded 2.8 g. of a colourless to pale yellow oil with a sweet pleasant odour, completely devoid of unpleasant odours. The oil can be used immediately in blending and needs no maturing.<br>
