COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10; rule 13)<br><br><br>
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF POLYPROPYLENE"<br><br>
BOREALIS TECHNOLOGY OY of the address: P.O. Box 330, FIN-06101 Porvoo, Finland.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it has to be performed:<br><br><br>
Process for the Preparation of polypropylene<br>
The  present invention relates to a  process for the preparation of polypropylene.<br>
Well-known polypropylenes of commerce are particularly isotactic, semi-crystalline, thermoplastic polymer mixtures. Although the poly-propylenes of commerce have many desirable and beneficial proper-ties, they also possess some important drawbacks such as low melt strength making them unsuitable for many applications, such as for blown films, extrusion coating, foam extrusion and blow-molding. These shortcomings have partially been overcome by introduction of branchings in the linear polymer backbone. This can be achieved through post-reactor treatment, copoiymerization with dienes, and through polymerization with specific catalysts at high temperatures. However, the processes presently available still do not result in poly¬propylene having a high melt stability which is of particular relevance in extrusion processes under extensional flow".<br>
To overcome this drawback and to develop a polypropylene which is suitable for advanced polypropylene applications, there is still the desire to provide a process resulting in polypropylene with improved rheological properties such as high melt strength.<br>
The finding of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a polypropylene using a catalyst system of low poros¬ity comprising an asymmetric catalyst.<br>
According to the present invention, a process for the preparation of a polypropylene is provided which uses a catalyst system of low poros¬ity, the catalyst system comprising an asymmetric catalyst, wherein the catalyst system has a porosity of less than 1-40 mi/g.<br><br>

Preferably the asymetric catalyst, more preferably the asymmetric metallocene compound, comprises only two different organic ligands, still more preferably comprises only two organic ligands which are different and linked via a bridge. Due to the use of the catalyst system with a very low porosity in combination with an asymmetric catalyst, the process defined above results in polypropylene with improved rheological properties such as high melt strength.<br>

In a  preferred  embodiment the  asymmetric catalyst is dimethylsi-landiyl [(2-methyl-(4'-tert.butyl)-4-phenyl-indenyl)(2-isopropyl-(4'-tert.butyl)-4-phenyl-indenyl)]zirkonium    dichloride.    More    preferred said asymmetric catalyst is not silica supported.<br>
It is in particular preferred that the asymmetric catalyst is obtainable by the emulsion solidification technology as described in WO 03/051934. This document is herewith included entirely by refer-ence. Hence the asymmetric catalyst is preferably in the form of solid catalyst particles, obtainable by a process comprising the steps of<br>
a)      preparing a solution of one or more asymmetric cata¬lyst components;<br><br>
b)	dispersing said solution in a solvent immiscible therewith to form an emulsion in which said one or more catalyst components are present in the droplets of the dispersed phase,<br>
c)	solidifying said dispersed phase to convert said drop-lets to solid particles and optionally recovering said particles to obtain said catalyst.<br>
Preferably a solvent, more preferably an organic solvent, is used to form said solution. Still more preferably the organic solvent is se¬lected from the group consisting of a linear alkane, cyclic alkane, lin¬ear alkene, cyclic alkene, aromatic hydrocarbon and halogen-containing hydrocarbon.<br>
Moreover the immiscible solvent forming the continuous phase is an inert solvent, more preferably the inmiscible solvent comprises a fiuorinated organic solvent and/or a functionalized derivative thereof, still more preferably the inmiscible solvent comprises a semi-, highly-or perfluorinated hydrocarbon and/or a functionalized derivative thereof. It is in particular preferred, that said immiscible solvent com-prises a perfluorohydrocarbon or a functionaiised derivative thereof, pref-erably perfluoroalkanes, -alkenes or -cycloalkanes, more preferred   perfiuoro-alkanes, -alkenes or-cycloalkanes, particularly preferred perfluorohexane, perfluoroheptane, perfluorooctane or perfluoro (methyl-cyciohexane) or a mixture thereof.<br>
Furthermore it is preferred that the emulsion comprising said continuous phase and said dispersed phase is a bi-or multiphasic system as known in the art. An emulsifier may be used for forming the emulsion. After the formation of the emulsion system, said catalyst is formed in situ from catalyst components in said solution.<br><br>
In principle, the emulsifying agent may be any suitable agent which contributes to the formation and/or stabilization of the emulsion and which does not have any adverse effect on the catalytic activity of the catalyst. The emulsifying agent may e.g. be a surfactant based on hydrocarbons optionally interrupted with (a) heteroatom(s), pref¬erably halogenated hydrocarbons optionally having a functional group, preferably semi-, highly- or perfluorinated hydrocarbons as known in the art. Alternatively, the emulsifying agent may be pre¬pared during the emulsion preparation, e.g. by reacting a surfactant precursor with a compound of the catalyst solution. Said surfactant precursor may be a halogenated hydrocarbon with at least one func¬tional group, e.g. a highly fluorinated to alcohol, which reacts e.g. with a cocatalyst component, such as aluminoxane.<br>
In principle any solidification method can be used for forming the solid particles from the dispersed droplets. According to one preferable em¬bodiment the solidification is effected by a temperature change treatment. Hence the emulsion subjected to gradual temperature change of up to 10 °C/min, preferably 0.5 to 6 °C/min and more preferably 1 to 5 °C/min. Even more preferred the emulsion is subjected to a temperature change of more than 40 °C, preferably more than 50 °C within less than 10 sec¬onds, preferably less than 6 seconds.<br>
The recovered particles have preferably an average size range of 5 to 200 urn, more preferably 10 to 100 urn.<br>
Moreover, the form of solidified particles have preferably a spherical shape, a predetermined particles size distribution and a surface area as mentioned above of preferably less than 25 m2/g, still more preferably less than 20 m2/g, yet more preferably less than 15 m2/g, yet still more<br><br>
preferably less than 10m2/g and most preferably less than 5 m2/g, wherein said particles are obtained by the process as described above.<br>
For further details, embodiments and examples of the continuous and dispersed phase system, emulsion formation method, emulsifying agent and solidification methods reference is made e.g. to the above cited inter¬national patent application WO 03/051934.<br>
The catalyst system may further comprise an activator as a cocata-lyst, as described in WO 03/051934, which is enclosed hereby with reference.<br>
Preferred as cocatalysts for metallocenes and non-metallocenes, if desired, are the aluminoxanes, in particular the  alkylaluminoxanes, most particularly methylaluminoxane (MAO). Such aluminoxanes can be used as the sole cocataiyst or together with other cocatalyst(s). Thus besides or in addition to aluminoxanes, other cation complex forming catalysts activators can be used. Said activators are commercially available or can be prepared according to the prior art literature.<br>
Further aluminoxane cocatalysts are described i.a. in WO 94/28034 which is incorporated herein by reference. These are linear or cyclic oligomers of having up to 40, preferably 3 to 20, repeat<br>
units (wherein R"' is hydrogen, alkyl (preferably methyl) or C6-<br>
C18-aryl or mixtures thereof).<br>
The use and amounts of such activators are within the skills of an expert in the field. As an example, with the boron activators, 5:1 to 1:5, preferably 2:1 to 1:2, such as 1:1, ratio of the transition metal to boron activator may be used. In case of preferred aluminoxanes, such as methylaluminumoxane (MAO), the amount of Al, provided by<br><br>
aluminoxane, can be chosen to provide a molar ratio of transition metal e.g. in the range of 1 to 10 000, suitably 5 to 8000, preferably 10 to 7000, e.g. 100 to 4000, such as 1000 to 3000. Typically in case of solid (heterogeneous) catalyst the ratio is preferably below 500.<br>
The quantity of cocataiyst to be employed in the catalyst of the in-vention is thus variable, and depends on the conditions and the par-ticular transition metal compound chosen in a manner well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Any additional components to be contained in the solution compris-ing the organotransition compound may be added to said solution before or, alternatively, after the dispersing step.<br>
Preferably, the process of the present invention is a multi-stage process to obtain multimodal polypropylene.<br>
Multistage processes also include bulk/gas phase reactors known as multizone gas phase reactors for producing multimodal polypropyl-ene.<br>
A preferred multistage process is a "loop-gas phase"-process, such as developed by Borealis A/S (known as BORSTAR® technology) described e.g. in EP 0 887 379 or WO 92/12182.<br>
Multimodal polymers can be produced according to several proc-esses which are described, e.g. in WO 92/12182, EP 0 887 379 and WO 97/22633.<br>
A multimodal polypropylene according to this invention is produced preferably in a multi-stage process in a multi-stage reaction se-quence as described in WO 92/12182. The contents of this document are included herein by reference.<br><br>
It has previously been known to produce multimodal, in particular bimodal, polypropylene in two or more reactors connected in series, i.e. in different steps (a) and (b).<br>
Preferably the process as defined above and further defined below is a slurry polymerization, even more preferred a bulk polymerization.<br>
According to the present invention, the main polymerization stages are preferably carried out as a combination of a slurry polymeriza-tion/gas phase polymerization, more preferred the main polymeriza-tion stages are preferably carried out as a combination of bulk po-lymerization/gas phase polymerization.<br>
The bulk polymerization is preferably performed in a so-called loop reactor.<br>
As used herein, the term "slurry polymerization" means a polymerization process that involves at least two phases, e.g. in which particulate, solid polymer (e.g. granular) is formed in a liquid or polymerization medium, or in a liquid/vapour polymerization medium. Certain embodiments of the processes described herein are slurry polymerizations, e.g. processes in which the products of polymerization are solid. The polymerization prod-ucts (e.g. polypropylenes) in those processes preferably have melting points sufficiently high to avoid melting during polymerization, so that they can in many cases be recovered as granular polymer. A slurry polymeri-zation may include solvent (i.e. which is also referred to as diluent), or it may be a bulk process, discussed below.<br>
As used herein, the term "bulk process" means a polymerization process in which the polymerization medium consists entirely of or consists essen-tially of monomers and any products of polymerization that has taken place, e.g. macromers and polymers, but does not include solvent (i.e.<br><br>
which also means that no diluent is present), or includes minor amounts of solvent, defined as less than 50 volume percent, and preferably much less.<br>
\n order to produce the multimodal polypropylene according to this invention, a flexible mode is preferred. For this reason, it is preferred that the composition be produced in two main polymerization stages in combination of loop reactor/gas phase reactor.<br>
Optionally, and preferably, the process may also comprise a pre-polymerization step in a manner known in the field and which may precede the polymerization step (a).<br>
If desired, a further elastomeric comonomer component, so called ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) component as in this invention, may be incorporated into the obtained propylene polymer to form a propylene copolymer as defined above. The ethylene-propylene rub¬ber (EPR) component may preferably be produced after the gas phase polymerization step (b) in a subsequent second or further gas phase polymerizations using one or more gas phase reactors.<br>
The process is preferably a continuous process.<br>
Preferably, in the process for producing the propylene polymer as defined above the conditions for the bulk reactor of step (a) may be as follows:<br>
the temperature is within the range of 40 °C to 110 °C, pref-erably between 60 °C and 100 °C, 70 to 90 °C,<br>
the pressure is within the range of 20 bar to 80 bar, preferably between 30 bar to 60 bar,<br><br>
hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known per se.<br>
Subsequently, the reaction mixture from the bulk reactor (step a) is transferred to the gas phase reactor, i.e. to step (b), whereby the conditions in step (b) are preferably as follows:<br>
the temperature is within the range of 50 °C to 130 °C, pref-erably between 60 °C and 100 °C,<br>
the pressure Is within the range of 5 bar to 50 bar, preferably between 15 bar to 35 bar,<br>
hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known per se.<br>
The residence time can vary in both reactor zones. In one embodi-ment of the process for producing the propylene polymer the resi-dence time in bulk reactor, e.g. loop is En the range 0.5 to 5 hours, e.g. 0.5 to 2 hours and the residence time in gas phase reactor will generally be 1 to 8 hours.<br>
If desired, the polymerization may be effected in a known manner under supercritical conditions in the bulk, preferably loop reactor, and/or as a condensed mode in the gas phase reactor.<br>
The process of the invention or any embodiments thereof above en-able highly feasible means for producing and further tailoring the propylene polymer composition within the invention, e.g. the proper-ties of the polymer composition can be adjusted or controlled in a known manner e.g. with one or more of the following process pa-rameters: temperature, hydrogen feed, comonomer feed, propylene<br><br>
feed e.g. in the gas phase reactor, catalyst, the type and amount of an external donor (if used), split between components.<br>
The above process enables very feasible means for obtaining the reactor-made propylene polymer as defined below.<br>
With the process defined above, it is possible to obtain polypropyl ene having improved rheological properties such as high melt strength. In particular, it is possible to provide a multi-branched poly-propylene, i.e. not only the polypropylene backbone is furnished with a large number of side chains (branched polypropylene) but also some of the side chains are provided with further side chains. Ac-cordingly the process of the instant invention is in particular suitable to produce a polypropylene as defined in detail below.<br>
Hence, the present invention is also related, in a first embodiment, to a polypropylene having<br>
a.	a branching index g' of less than 1.00 and/or<br>
b.	a strain hardening index (SHI@1s"1) of at least 0.30<br>
measured by a deformation rate ds/dt of 1.00 at a<br>
temperature of 180 °C, wherein the strain hardening in-<br>
dex (SHI) is defined as the slope of the logarithm to the<br>
basis 10 of the tensile stress growth function as<br>
function of the logarithm to the basis 10 of the Hencky<br>
strain (Ig in the range of Hencky strains between 1<br>
and 3.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that polypropylenes with such charac-teristics have superior properties compared to the polypropylenes known in the art. Especially, the melt of the polypropylenes in the extrusion process has a high stability.<br><br>
The new polypropylenes are characterized in particular by exten-sional melt flow properties. The extensional flow, or deformation that involves the stretching of a viscous material, is the dominant type of deformation in converging and squeezing flows that occur in typical polymer processing operations. Extensional melt flow measurements are particularly useful in polymer characterization because they are very sensitive to the molecular structure of the polymeric system be-ing tested. When the true strain rate of extension, also referred to as the Hencky strain rate, is constant, simple extension is said to be a "strong flow" in the sense that it can generate a much higher degree of molecular orientation and stretching than flows in simple shear. As a consequence, extensional flows are very sensitive to crystalfinity and macro-structural effects, such as long-chain branching, and as such can be far more descriptive with regard to polymer characteri-zation than other types of bulk Theological measurement which apply shear flow.<br>
The first characteristic of the polypropylene is that the branching in-dex g' shall be less than 1.00, more preferably less than 0.90, still more preferably less than 0.80. In the preferred embodiment, the branching index g' shall be less than 0.75. The branching index g" defines the degree of branching and correlates with the amount of branches of a polymer. The branching index g' is defined as   in which g' is the branching index, is the intrinsic<br>
viscosity of the branched polypropylene and is the intrinsic vis-<br>
cosity of the linear polypropylene having the same weight average molecular weight (within a range of ±10%) as the branched polypro¬pylene. Thereby, a low g'-value is an Indicator for a high branched polymer. In other words, if the g'-value decreases, the branching of the polypropylene increases. Reference is made in this context to<br><br>
B.H. Zimm and W.H. Stockmeyer, J. Chem. Phys. 17,1301 (1949). This document is herewith included by reference.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity needed for determining the branching index g' is measured according to DIN ISO 1628/1, October 1999 (in Decalin at135°C).<br>
A further requirement and/or an alternative characteristic is that the strain hardening index shall be at least 0.30, more pre-<br>
ferred of at least 0.40, still more preferred of at least 0.50. In a pre-ferred embodiment the strain hardening index (SHI@1s"1) is at least 0.55.<br>
The strain hardening index is a measure for the strain hardening be-havior of the polypropylene melt. In the present invention, the strain hardening index (SHI@1s"1) has been measured by a deformation rate ds/dt of 1.00 at a temperature of 180 °C for determining the strain hardening behavior, wherein the strain hardening index (SHI) is defined as the slope of the tensile stress growth function  as a function of the Hencky strain s on a logarithmic scale between 1.00 and 3.00 (see figure 1). Thereby the Hencky strain s is defined by the formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
the Hencky strain rate is defined by the formula<br>
  with<br>
  is the fixed,  unsupported length of the specimen  sample  being stretched which is equal to the centerline distance between the master and slave drums "R" is the radius of the equi-dimensional windup drums, and<br><br>
  is a constant drive shaft rotation rate.<br>
in turn the tensile stress growth function is defined by the formula   with<br>
  and<br>
  wherein<br>
the Hencky strain rate is defined as for the Hencky strain <br>
"F" is the tangential stretching force<br>
"R" is the radius of the equi-dimensional windup drums<br>
"T" is the measured torque signal, related to the tangential stretching<br>
force"F"<br>
"A"  is the  instantaneous  cross-sectional  area  of a  stretched  molten<br>
specimen<br>
  is the cross-sectional area of the specimen in the solid state (i.e. prior to melting),<br>
"ds" is the solid state density and "dM" the melt density of the polymer.<br>
In addition, it is preferred that the polypropylene shows strain rate thickening which means that the strain hardening increases with ex-tension rates. Similarly to the measurement of SHI@1s-1, a strain hardening index (SHI) can be determined at different strain rates. A strain hardening index (SHI) is defined as the slope of the logarithm to the basis 10 of the   tensile stress growth function  as<br>
function of the logarithm to the basis 10 of the Hencky strain  between Hencky strains 1.00 and 3.00 at a temperature of 180 °C, where a <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d2819a9b92e2fce3">[email&#160;protected]</a> s-1 is determined with a deformation rate   of<br>
0.10 s"1, a <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5a0912131a6a7469">[email&#160;protected]</a> s-1 is determined with a deformation rate of<br><br>
0.30 s-1, a SH)@3 s-1 is determined with a deformation rate of 3.00 s-1, a SH!@10s-1 is determined with a deformation rate of 10.0 s-1. In comparing the strain hardening index (SHI) at those five strain rates of 0.10, 0.30, 1.00, 3.00 and 10.0s-1 the slope of the<br>
strain hardening index (SHI) as function of the logarithm to the basis 10 of  is a characteristic measure for multi-branching.<br>
Therefore, a multi-branching index (MBI) is defined as the slope of SHI as a function oflg.e. the slope of a linear fitting curve of<br><br>
the strain  hardening  index (SHI) versus applying  the  least<br>
square method, preferably the strain hardening index (SHI) is de¬fined at deformation rates between 0.05 s"1 and 20.0 s"1, more preferably between 0.10 s"1 and 10.0 s"1, still more preferably at the deformations rates 0.10, 0.30, 1.00, 3.00 and 10.0 s"1. Yet more preferably the SHI-values determined by the deformations rates 0.10, 0.30, 1.00, 3.00 and 10.0 s"1 are used for the linear fit accord-ing to the least square method when establishing the multi-branching index (MBI).<br>
Hence, a further preferred requirement of the invention is a multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 0.15, more preferably of at least 0.20, and still more preferred of at least 0.25. In a still more pre-ferred embodiment the multi-branching index (MBI) is at least 0.28.<br>
It is in particular preferred that the polypropylene according to this invention has branching index g' of less than 1.00, a strain hardening index (SHI@1s"1) of at least 0.30 and multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 0.15. Still more preferred the polypropylene according to this invention has branching index g' of less than 0.80, a strain hardening index (SHI@1s-1) of at least 0.40 and multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 0.15. In another preferred embodiment the polypropylene<br><br>
according to this invention has branching index g' of less than 1.00, a strain hardening index (SHI@1s"1) of at least 0.30 and multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 0.20. In still another preferred em-bodiment the polypropylene according to this invention has branch-ing index g' of less than 1.00, a strain hardening index (SHI@1s-1) of at least 0.40 and multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 0.20. In yet another preferred embodiment the polypropylene according to this invention has branching index g' of less than 0.80, a strain hardening index (SHi@1s"1) of at least 0.50 and multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 0.30.<br>
Accordingly, the polypropyienes of the present invention, i.e. multi-branched polypropylenes, are characterized by the fact that their strain hardening index (SHI) increases with the deformation rate <br>
i.e. a phenomenon which is not observed in other polypropylenes. Single branched polymer types (so called Y polymers having a back-bone with a single long side-chain and an architecture which resem-bles a or H-branched polymer types (two polymer chains cou-pled with a bridging group and a architecture which resemble an "H") as well as linear or short chain branched polymers do not show such a relationship, i.e. the strain hardening index (SHI) is not Influenced by the deformation rate (see Figures 2 and 3). Accordingly, the strain hardening index (SHI) of known polymers, in particular known poly-propylenes and polyethylenes, does not increase or increases only negligible with increase of the deformation rate  Industrial conversion processes which imply elongational flow operate at very fast extension rates. Hence the advantage of a material which shows more pronounced strain hardening (measured by the strain harden-ing index SHI) at high strain rates becomes obvious. The faster the material is stretched, the higher the strain hardening index (SHI) and<br><br>
hence the more stable the material will be in conversion. Especially in the fast extrusion process, the melt of the multi-branched polypro-pylenes has a high stabifity.<br>

In a second embodiment, the present invention is related to a poly-propylene showing a strain rate thickening which means that the strain hardening increases with extension rates. A strain hardening index (SHI) can be determined at different strain rates. A strain hardening index (SHI) is defined as the slope of the tensile stress growth function as function of the Hencky strain s on a logarith-mic scale between 1.00 and 3.00 at a at a temperature of 180 °C, where a <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="86d5cecfc6b6a8b7f5">[email&#160;protected]</a>"1 is determined with a deformation rate of 0.10 s-1, a <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0a5942434a3a243979">[email&#160;protected]</a>"1 is determined with a deformation rate of 0.30 s-1, a SHI@3s'1 is determined with a deformation rate of 3.00 s-1, a SHI@10s"1 is determined with a deformation rate  of 10.0 s-1. In comparing the strain hardening index at those five strain rates of 0.10, 0.30,  1.0,  3.0 and  10s-1, the slope of the strain<br>
hardening index (SHI) as function of the logarithm to the basis 10 of   is a characteristic measure for multi -branching. There-fore, a multi-branching index (MBI) is defined as the slope of SHI as a function of i.e. the slope of a linear fitting curve of the strain<br>
hardening   index (SHI)     versus   applying   the   least  square<br>
method, preferably the strain hardening index (SHI) is defined at de¬formation  rates between  0.05 s"1  and 20.0 s-1,  more preferably<br><br>
between 0.10 s-1 and 10.0 s-1, still more preferably at the deforma-tions rates 0.10, 0.30, 1.00, 3.00 and 10.0 s-1.Yet more preferably the SHI-values determined by the deformations rates 0.10, 0.30, 1.00, 3.00 and 10.0 s-1 are used for the linear fit according to the least square method when establishing the multi-branching in-dex (MBI).<br>
Hence, in the second embodiment the polypropylene has a multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 0.15.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that polypropylenes with such charac-teristics have superior properties compared to the polypropylenes known in the art. Especially, the melt of the polypropylenes in the extrusion process has a high stability.<br>
The new polypropylenes are characterized in particular by exten-sional melt flow properties. The extensional flow, or deformation that involves the stretching of a viscous material, is the dominant type of deformation in converging and squeezing flows that occur in typical polymer processing operations. Extensional melt flow measurements are particularly useful in polymer characterization because they are very sensitive to the molecular structure of the polymeric system be-ing tested. When the true strain rate of extension, also referred to as the Hencky strain rate, is constant, simple extension is said to be a "strong flow" in the sense that it can generate a much higher degree of molecular orientation and stretching than flows in simple shear.

The first requirement according to the present invention is that the polypropylene has a multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 0.15, more preferably of at least 0.20, and still more preferred of at least 0.30.<br>
As stated above, the multi-branching index (MBI) is defined as the slope of the strain hardening index(SHI) as a function of Ig [d<br><br>
Accordingly, the polypropylenes of the present invention, i.e. multi-branched polypropylenes, are characterized by the fact that their strain hardening index (SHI) increases with the deformation rate <br>
i.e. a phenomenon which is not observed in other polypropylenes.

Accordingly, the strain hardening index (SHI) of known polymers, in particular known poly-propylenes, does not increase or increases only negligible with in-crease of the deformation rate  Industrial conversion proc-esses which imply elongational flow operate at very fast extension rates. Hence the advantage of a material which shows more pro-nounced strain hardening (measured by the strain hardening index (SHI)) at high strain rates becomes obvious. The faster the material is stretched, the higher the strain hardening index and hence the more stable the material will be in conversion. Especially in the fast<br><br>
extrusion process, the melt of the multi-branched polypropylenes has a high stability.<br>
A further requirement is that the strain hardening index (SHI@1s-1) shall be at least 0.30, more preferred of at least 0.40, still more pre¬ferred of at least 0.50.<br>
The strain hardening index (SHI) is a measure for the strain harden¬ing behavior of the polypropylene melt. In the present invention, the strain hardening index (SHI@1s-1) has been measured by a deforma-tion rate of 1.00 s-1at a temperature of 180 °C for determining the strain hardening behavior, wherein the strain hardening in-dex (SHI) is defined as the slope of the tensile stress growth func-tion a function of the Hencky strain s on a logarithmic scale between 1.00 and 3.00 (see figure 1). Thereby the Hencky strain is defined by the formula<br><br>

the Hencky strain rate is defined by the formula<br><br>

"ds" is the solid state density (determined according to ISO 1183) and<br>
"dM" the melt density (determined according to ISO 1133; procedure B) of<br>

In addition, it is preferred that the branching index g' shall be less than 1.00, more preferably less than 0.90, still more preferably less than 0.80. In the preferred embodiment, the branching index g' shall be less than 0.70. The branching index g' defines the degree of branching and correlates with the amount of branches of a polymer. The branching index g' is defined as in which g' is the<br>
branching index, is the intrinsic viscosity of the branched poly-<br>
propylene and  is the intrinsic viscosity of the linear polypropyl-<br>
ene having the same weight average molecular weight (within a range of ±10%) as the branched polypropylene. Thereby, a low g'-value is an indicator for a high branched polymer. In other words, if the g'-value decreases, the branching of the polypropylene in-creases. Reference is made in this context to B.H. Zimm and W.H.<br><br>

It is in particular preferred that the polypropylene according to this invention has branching index g' of less than 1.00, a strain hardening index (SHI@1s"1) of at least 0.30 and multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 0.15. Still more preferred the polypropylene according to this invention has branching index g' of less than 0.80, a strain hardening index (SHI@1s"1) of at least 0.40 and multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 0.15. In another preferred embodiment the polypropylene according to this invention has branching index g' of less than 1.00, a strain hardening index (SHl@1s-1) of at least 0.30 and multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 020. In still another preferred em-bodiment the polypropylene according to this invention has branch-ing index g' of less than 1.00, a strain hardening index (SHI@1s-1) of at least 0.40 and multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 020. In yet another preferred embodiment the polypropylene according to this invention has branching index g' of less than 0.80, a strain hardening index (SHI@1s-1) of at least 0.50 and multi-branching index (MBI) of at least 030.<br><br>
The further features mentioned below apply to both embodiment, i.e. the first and the second embodiment as defined above.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred that the polypropylene has a melt flow rate (MFR) given in a specific range. The melt flow rate mainly de-pends on the average molecular weight. This is due to the fact that long molecules render the material a lower flow tendency than short molecules. An increase in molecular weight means a decrease in the MFR-value. The melt flow rate (MFR) is measured in g/10 min of the polymer discharged through a defined dye under specified tempera-ture and pressure conditions and the measure of viscosity of the polymer which, in turn, for each type of polymer is mainly influenced by its molecular weight but also by its degree of branching. The melt flow rate measured under a load of 2.16 kg at 230 °C (ISO 1133) is denoted as Accordingly, it is preferred that in the present in-<br>
vention   the   polypropylene   has   an   in   a   range   of 0.01   to<br>
1000.00 g/10 min, more preferably of 0.01 to 100.00 g/10 min, still more preferred of 0.05 to 50 g/10 min. In a preferred embodiment, the MFR is in a range of 1.00 to 11.00 g/10 min. In another preferred embodiment, the MFR is in a range of 3.00 to 11.00 g/10 min.<br>
The number average molecular weight (Mn) is an average molecular weight of a polymer expressed as the first moment of a plot of the number of molecules in each molecular weight range against the mo-lecular weight. In effect, this is the total molecular weight of all mole-cules divided by the number of molecules. In turn, the weight aver-age molecular weight (Mw) is the first moment of a plot of the weight of polymer in each molecular weight range against molecular weight.<br>
The number average molecular weight (Mn) and the weight average molecular weight (Mw) as well as the molecular weight distribution<br><br>
are determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Wa-ters Alliance GPCV 2000 instrument with online viscometer. The oven temperature is 140 °C. Trichlorobenzene is used as a solvent.<br>
It is preferred that the polypropylene has a weight average molecular weight (Mw) from 10,000 to 2,000,000 g/mol, more preferably from 20,000 to 1,500,000 g/mol.<br>
More preferably, the polypropylene according to this invention shall have a rather high pentade concentration, i.e. higher than 90 %, more preferably higher than 92 % and most preferably higher than 93 %. In another preferred embodiment the pentade concentration is higher than 95 %. The pentade concentration is an indicator for the narrowness in the regularity distribution of the polypropylene.<br>
tn addition, it is preferred that the polypropylene has a melting tem-perature Tm of higher than 125 °C. It is in particular preferred that the melting temperature is higher than 125 °C if the polypropylene is a polypropylene copolymer as defined below, in turn, in case the polypropylene is a polypropylene homopolymer as defined below, it is preferred, that polypropylene has a melting temperature of higher than 150 °C, more preferred higher than 155 °C.<br>
More preferably, the polypropylene according to this invention is mul-timodal, even more preferred bimodal. "Multimodal" or "multimodal distribution" describes a frequency distribution that has several rela-tive maxima. In particular, the expression "modality of a polymer" re-fers to the form of its molecular weight distribution (MWD) curve, i.e. the appearance of the graph of the polymer weight fraction as a func-tion of its molecular weight. If the polymer is produced in the sequen-tial step process, i.e. by utilizing reactors coupled in series, and us-ing different conditions in each reactor, the different polymer frac-<br><br>
tions produced in the different reactors each have their own molecu¬lar weight distribution which may considerably differ from one an¬other. The molecular weight distribution curve of the resulting final polymer can be seen at a super-imposing of the molecular weight distribution curves of the polymer fraction which will, accordingly, show a more distinct maxima, or at least be distinctively broadened compared with the curves for individual fractions.<br>
A polymer showing such molecular weight distribution curve is called bimodal or multimodal, respectively.<br>
The polypropylene is preferably bimodal.<br>
The polypropylene according to this invention can be homopoiymer or a copolymer. Accordingly, the homopoiymer as well as the co-polymer can be a multimodal polymer composition.<br>
The expression homopoiymer used herein relates to a polypropylene that consists substantially, i.e. of at least 97 wt%, preferably of at least 99 wt%, and most preferably of at least 99.8 wt% of propylene units.<br>
tn case the polypropylene according to this invention is a propylene copolymer, it is preferred that the comonomer is ethylene. However, also other comonomers known in the art are suitable. Preferably, the total amount of comonomer, more preferably ethylene, in the propyl-ene copolymer is up to 30 wt%, more preferably up to 25 wt%.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polypropylene is a propylene co-polymer comprising a polypropylene matrix and an ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR).<br><br>
The polypropylene matrix can be a homopolymer or a copolymer, more preferably multimodal, i.e. birnodal, homopolymer or a multi-modal, i.e. birnodal, copolymer, in case the polypropylene matrix is a propylene copolymer, then it is preferred that the comonomer is eth-ylene or butene. However, also other comonomers known in the art are suitable. The preferred amount of comonomer, more preferably ethylene, in the polypropylene matrix is up to 8.00 Mol%. In case the propylene copolymer matrix has ethylene as the comonomer compo¬nent, it is in particular preferred that the amount of ethylene in the matrix is up to 8.00 Mol%, more preferably less than 6.00 Mol%. In case the propylene copolymer matrix has butene as the comonomer component, it is in particular preferred that the amount of butene in the matrix is up to 6.00 Mol%, more preferably less than 4.00 Mol%.<br>
Preferably, the ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) in the total propyl-ene copolymer is up to 80 wt%. More preferably the amount of ethyl-ene-propylene rubber (EPR) in the total propylene copolymer is in the range of 20 to 80 wt%, still more preferably in the range of 30 to 60 wt%.<br>
In addition, it is preferred that the polypropylene being a copolymer comprising a polypropylene matrix and an ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) has an ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) with an ethylene-content of up to 50 wt%.<br>

For the meso pentad concentration analysis, also referred herein as pentad concentration analysis, the assignment analysis is under-taken according to T Hayashi, Pentad concentration, R. Chujo and T. Asakura, Polymer 29 138-43 (1988) and Chujo R, et al., Polymer 35 339(1994)<br>
B.	Multi-branching Index<br>
1.       Acquiring the experimental data<br>
Polymer is melted at T=180 °C and stretched with the SER Universal Testing Platform as described below at deformation rates of   0.3 1.0 3.0 and 10 s"1 in subsequent experiments. The method to acquire the raw data is described in Sentmanat et al., J. Rheol. 2005, Measuring the Transient Elongational Rheology of Polyethylene Melts Using the SER Universal Testing Platform.<br>
Experimental Setup<br>
A Paar Physica MCR300, equipped with a TC30 temperature control unit and an oven CTT600 (convection and radiation heating) and a SERVP01-<br><br>
025 extensional device with temperature sensor and a software RHEO-PLUS/32 V2.66 is used.<br>
Sample Preparation<br>
Stabilized Pellets are compression moulded at 220°C (gel time 3min, pressure time 3 min, total moulding time 3+3=6min) in a mould at a pres-sure sufficient to avoid bubbles in the specimen, cooled to room tempera-ture. From such prepared plate of 0.7 mm thickness, stripes of a width of 10 mm and a length of 18 mm are cut.<br>
Check of the SER Device<br>
Because of the low forces acting on samples stretched to thin thick-nesses, any essential friction of the device would deteriorate the precision of the results and has to be avoided.<br>
In order to make sure that the friction of the device is less than a thresh¬old of 5x10-3 mNm (Milli-Newtonmeter) which is required for precise and correct measurements, following check procedure is performed prior to each measurement:<br>
•	The  device   is  set  to  test  temperature   (180 °C)  for  minimum 20 minutes without sample in presence of the clamps<br>
•	A standard test with 0.3 s-1 is performed with the device on test temperature (180 °C)<br>
•	The torque (measured in mNm) is recorded and plotted against time<br>
•	The torque must not exceed a value of 5x mNm to make sure that the friction of the device is in an acceptably low range<br><br>
Conducting the experiment<br>
The device is heated for 20 min to the test temperature (180 °C measured with the thermocouple attached to the SER device) with clamps but with¬out sample. Subsequently, the sample (0.7x10x18 mm), prepared as de¬scribed above, is clamped into the hot device. The sample is allowed to melt for 2 minutes +/- 20 seconds before the experiment is started.<br>
During the stretching experiment under inert atmosphere (nitrogen) at constant Hencky strain rate, the torque is recorded as function of time at isothermal conditions (measured and controlled with the thermocouple attached to the SER device).<br>
After stretching, the device is opened and the stretched film (which is winded on the drums) is inspected. Homogenous extension is required. It can be judged visually from the shape of the stretched film on the drums if the sample stretching has been homogenous or not. The tape must me wound up symmetrically on both drums, but also symmetrically in the up-per and lower half of the specimen.<br>
If symmetrical stretching is confirmed hereby, the transient elongational viscosity calculates from the recorded torque as outlined below.<br>
2.       Evaluation<br>
For each of the different strain rates applied, the resulting ten-<br>
sile stress growth function  is plotted against the total<br>
Hencky strain z to determine the strain hardening behaviour of the melt, see Figure 1.<br>
In the range of Hencky strains between 1.0 and 3.0, the tensile stress growth function can be well fitted with a function<br><br>
-37-<br><br>
where c1 and c2 are fitting variables. Such derived c2 is a measure for the strain hardening behavior of the melt and called Strain Hardening Index SHI.<br>
Dependent on the polymer architecture, SHI can<br>
-	be independent of the strain rate (linear materials, <br>
structures)<br>
-	increase with strain rate (short chain-, hyper- or multi-branched<br>
structures).<br>
This is illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
For polyethylene, linear (HDPE), short-chain branched (LLDPE) and hyperbranched structures (LDPE) are well known and hence they are used to illustrate the structural analytics based on the results on ex-tensional viscosity. They are compared with a polypropylene with Y and H-structures with regard to their change of the strain-hardening behavior as function of strain rate, see Figure 2 and Table 1.<br>
To illustrate the determination, of SHI at different strain rates as well as the multi-branching index (MB!) four polymers of known chain  chitecture are examined with the analytical procedure described above.    .<br>
The first polymer is a H- and Y-shaped polypropylene homopoiymer made according to EP 879 830 ("A") example 1 through adjusting the MFR with the amount of butadiene. It has a MFR230/2.16 of 2.0g/10min, a tensile modulus of 1950 MPa and a branching index g'of 0.7..<br><br>
I he second polymer is a commercial hyperbranched LDPE, Borealis "B", made in a high pressure process known in the art. It has a MFR190/2.16 of 4.5 and a density of 923 kg/m3.<br>
The third polymer is a short chain branched LLDPE, Borealis "C, made in a low pressure process known in the art. It has a MFR190/2.16 of 1.2 and a density of 919 kg/m3.<br>
The fourth polymer is a linear HDPE, Borealis "D", made in a low pressure process known in the art. It has a MFR190/2.16 of 4.0 and a density of 954 kg/m3.<br>
The four materials of known chain architecture are investigated by means of measurement of the transient elongationa! viscosity at 180 °C at strain rates of 0.10, 0.30, 1.0, 3.0 and 10 s"1. Obtained data (transient elongational viscosity versus Hencky strain) is fitted with a function<br><br><br>
and c2 is the strain hardening index (SHI) at the particular strain rate.<br>
for each of the mentioned strain rates. The parameters c1 and c2 are found through plotting the logarithm of the transient elongational vis-cosity against the logarithm of the Hencky strain and performing a linear fit of this data applying the least square method. The parame-20 ter c-1 calculates from the intercept of the linear fit of the data  versus fg(s) from<br><br><br>
This procedure is done for a!) five strain rates and hence, <br>
  are determined, see Figure 1 and Table 1.<br>
Table 1:      SHl-values<br><br>
From the strain hardening behaviour measured by the values of the SHi@1s'1 one can already clearly distinguish between two groups of polymers: Linear and short-chain branched have a  signifi-<br>
cantly smaller than 0.30. In contrast, the Y and H-branched as well     as  hyper-branched  materials  have a  significantly  larger<br>
than 0.30.<br>
In comparing the strain hardening index at those five strain rates  of 0.10, 0.30, 1.0, 3.0 and 10s"1, the slope of SHI as function of the logarithm   of   is   a   characteristic   measure   for   multi-<br>
     branching.   Therefore,  a  multi-branching  index (MBI)  is  calculated from the slope of a linear fitting curve of SHI versus <br><br><br>
The  parameters  c3  and  MBI are  found  through  plotting  the  SHI against the logarithm of the Hencky strain rate and performing<br>
a linear fit of this data applying the least square method. Please con¬fer to Figure 2.<br>
Tabie 2:      Multi-branched-index (MBI)<br><br>
The multi-branching index MBI allows now to distinguish between Y or H-branched polymers which show a MBI smaller than 0.05 and hyper-branched polymers which show a MBI larger than 0.15. Fur-ther, it allows to distinguish between short-chain branched polymers with MBI larger than 0.10 and linear materials which have a MBI smaller than 0.10.<br>
Similar results can be observed when comparing different polypro-pylenes, i.e. polypropylenes with rather high branched structures have higher SHI and MBI-values, respectively, compared to their lin-ear counterparts. Similar to the hyper-branched polyethylenes the new developed polypropylenes show a high degree of branching. However the polypropylenes according to the instant invention are clearly distinguished in the SHI and MB[-vaiues when compared to known hyper-branched polyethylenes. Without being bound on this theory, it is believed, that the different SHI and MBI-values are the result of a different branching architecture. For this reason the new<br><br>
found branched polypropylenes according to this invention are des-ignated as multi-branched.<br>
Combining both, strain hardening index (SHI) and multi-branching index (MB!), the chain architecture can be assessed as indicated in Table 3:<br>
Table 3:      Strain Hardening Index (SHI) and Multi-branching Index (MBI) for various chain architectures<br><br><br>
