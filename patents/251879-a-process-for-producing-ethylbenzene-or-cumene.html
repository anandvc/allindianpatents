				<td>A PROCESS OF USING A HIGH ACTIVITY CATALYST FOR THE TRANSALKYLATION OF AROMATICS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a process for the transalkylation of<br>
aromatics, particularly the transalkylation of polyisopropylbenzene(PIPB) with benzene to produce cumene and the transalkylation of polyethylbenzene(PEB) with benzene to produce ethylbenzene. Ethylbenzene is a valuable commodity chemical and is used in the production of styrene monomer. Cumene (isopropylbenzene) is also a valuable commodity chemical and is used in the production of phenol and acetone.<br>
[0002]	Presently,  ethylbenzene is often produced by a liquid phase<br>
alkylation process from benzene and ethylene in the presence of an alkylation catalyst. The liquid phase process operates at a lower temperature than its vapor phase counterpart. One advantage of the liquid phase alkylation is a lower yield of undesired by-products, polyalkylated aromatic compound(s). The alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds employing zeolite catalysts is known and, understood in the art. U.S. Patent 5,334,795 describes the liquid phase alkylation of benzene with ethylene in the presence of MCM-22 to produce ethylbenzene; and U.S. Patent 4,891,458 discloses liquid phase alkylation and transalkylation processes using zeolite beta.<br>
[0003]	Zeolite-based catalysts are used in the alkylation of benzene with<br>
propylene to produce cumene. U.S. Patent 4,992,606 discloses a process for preparing cumene using MCM-22 in liquid phase.<br>
[0004]	Commercial    alkylation    processes    for    the    production    of<br>
ethylbenzene and cumene typically produce certain polyalkylated by-products in addition to ethylbenzene and cumene. The polyalkylated aromatic compound(s) may be transalkylated with benzene or other alkylatable aromatic compound(s) to produce ethylbenzene or cumene. This transalkylation reaction may be accomplished by feeding the polyalkylated aromatic compound(s) through a transalkylation reactor operated under suitable conditions and in the presence of a<br>
transalkylation catalyst. Also, the polyalkylated aromatic compound(s) may be recycled to an alkylation reactor in the presence of an alkylation catalyst that is capable of performing the transalkylation reaction. The polyalkylated aromatic compound(s) typically include bi-alkylated benzenes (e.g., bi-ethylbenzene(s) or bi-isopropylbenzenes) and tri-alkylated benzene(s) (e.g., tri-ethylbenzenes or tri-isopropylbenzenes). Commercial transalkylation catalysts typically have bi-alkylated benzenes conversion of about 50 wt.% to 90 wt.%, but low tri-alkylated benzenes conversion (e.g., less than 20 wt.%) under the same conditions. U.S. Patent No. 5,557,024 discloses a process for preparing short chain alkyl aromatic compounds using MCM-56 and the use of zeolite catalysts such as MCM-22, zeolite X, zeolite Y and zeolite beta for the transalkylation of the polyalkylated aromatic compound(s).<br>
[0005]	However, none of these references contemplate a transalkylation<br>
process with a transalkylation catalyst which is maintained under conditions sufficient to yield a ratio of bi-alkylated aromatic compound(s) conversion over tri-alkylated aromatic compound(s) conversion in a range of from about 0.5 to about 2.5 at a temperature less than 300°C.<br>

"Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types", W.H. Meier, D.H. Olson, C.H. Baerlocher,<br>
Elsevier, 4th Edition, 1996, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.  Particularly suitable molecular sieves include zeolite beta, zeolite Y,<br>
MCM-22, and ZSM-12.<br>
[0023]	The   invention   also   relates   to   a   process   for  producing   a<br>
monoalkylated aromatic compound wherein an alkylation step, carried out under at least partial liquid phase conditions, an alkylatable compound is reacted with an alkylating agent, to produce a monoalkylated aromatic end product as well as a polyalkylated compound, which is separated and fed to a transalkylation process<br>

[0024]	The term "aromatic" when used in reference to the alkylatable<br>
compounds which are useful herein is to be understood in accordance with its art-recognized scope which includes alkyl-substituted and unsubstituted mono- and polynuclear compounds. Compounds of an aromatic character that possess a heteroatom are also useful provided they do not act as catalyst poisons under the reaction conditions selected.<br>
[0025]	Substituted   aromatic   compounds   that   may   be   alkylated   in<br>
accordance with the present invention, such as alkylatable aromatic compounds, must possess at least one hydrogen atom directly bonded to the aromatic nucleus. The aromatic rings can be substituted with one or more alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, cycloalkyl, halide, and/or other groups that do not interfere with the alkylation reaction.<br>
[0026]	Suitable aromatic hydrocarbons include benzene, naphthalene,<br>
anthracene, naphthacene, perylene, coronene, and phenanthrene, with benzene being preferred.<br>
[0027]	Generally the alkyl groups which can be present as substituents on<br>
the aromatic compound contain from 1 to about 22 carbon atoms and usually from<br>
about 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and most usually from about 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
[0028]	Suitable alkyl substituted aromatic compounds, such as alkylating<br>
agents, include toluene, xylene, isopropylbenzene, normal propylbenzene (n-propylbenzene), alpha-methylnaphthalene, ethylbenzene, mesitylene, durene, cymenes, butylbenzene, pseudocumene, o-diethylbenzene, m-diethylbenzene, p-diethylbenzene, isoamyibenzene, isohexylbenzene, pentaethylbenzene,<br>
pentamethylbenzene; 1,2,3,4-tetraethylbenzene; 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,4-triethylbenzne; 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, m-butyltoluene; p-butyltoluene; 3,5-diethyltoluene; o-ethyltoluene; p-ethyltoluene; m-propyltoluene; 4-ehtyl-m-xylene; dimethylnaphthalenes; ethylnaphthalene; 2,3-dimethylanthracene; 9-ethylanthracene; 2-methylanthracene; o-methylanthracene; 9,10-dimethylphenanthrene; and 3-methyl-phenathrene. Higher molecular weight alkylaromatic hydrocarbons can also be used as starting materials and include aromatic hydrocarbons such as are produced by the alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with olefin oligomers. Such products are frequently referred to in the art as alkylate and include hexylbenzene, nonylbenzene, dodecylbenzene, pentadecylbenzene, hexyltoluene, nonyltoluene, dodecyltoluene, pentadecytoluene, etc. Very often alkylate is obtained as a high boiling fraction in which the alky] group attached to the aromatic nucleus varies in size from about C6  to about C12.<br>
[0029]	Reformate containing substantial quantities of benzene, toluene<br>
and/or xylene constitutes a particularly useful feed for the alkylation process of this invention.<br>
[0030]	The alkylating agents that may be useful in the process of this<br>
invention generally include any aliphatic or aromatic organic compounds having one or more available alkylating aliphatic groups capable of reaction with the alkylatable aromatic compound.<br>
[0031]	Preferably, the alkylating agent employed herein has at least one<br>
alkylating aliphatic group possessing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Examples of such<br>
alkylating agents are olefins such as ethylene, propylene, the butenes, and the<br>
pentenes; alcohols (inclusive of monoalcohols, dialcohols and trialcohols) such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, the propanols, the butanols, and the pentanols; aldehydes such<br>
as formaldehyde, acetadehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, and n-<br>
valeraldehyde; and alkyl halides such as methyl chloride, ethyl chloride, the<br>
propyl chlorides, the butyl chlorides and the pentyl chlorides.<br>
[0032]	Mixtures of light olefins are especially useful as alkylating agents<br>
in the alkylation process of this invention. A mixture of concentrate alkene stream having at least 80 mol.% alkene and a dilute alkene stream having about 10 mol.%<br>
to 80 mil.% alkene may be used for this invention. Accordingly, mixtures of ethylene, propylene, butenes, and/or pentenes which are major constituents of a variety of refinery streams, e.g., fuel gas, gas plant off-gas containing ethylene, propylene, etc., naphtha cracker off-gas containing light olefins and refinery FCC propane/propylene streams, are useful are useful alkylating agents herein. For example, a typical FCC light olefin stream possesses the following composition:<br>
Wt.%	Mole %<br>
Ethane	3.3                                    5.1<br>
Ethylene	0.7                                    1.2<br>
Propane	4.5	15.3<br>
Propylene	42.5	46.8<br>
Isobutane	12.9	10.3<br>
n-Butane	3.3	2.6<br>
Butenes	22.1	18.32<br>
Pentanes	0.7	0.4<br>
[0033]	Reaction products which may be obtained from the process of the<br>
invention include ethylbenzene from the reaction of benzene with ethylene, cumene from the reaction of benzene with propylene, ethyltoluene from the reaction of toluene with ethylene, cymenes from the reaction of toluene with propylene, and sec-butylbenzene from the reaction of benzene and n-butenes. Preferably, the process of the invention relates to the production of ethylbenzene by the alkylation of benzene with ethylene followed by the transalkylation of the diethylbenezene by-products with additional benzene; the production of cumene by the alkylation of benzene with propylene followed by the transalkylation of the diispropylbenzene by-products with additional benzene.<br>
[0034]	In one embodiment of the invention, the alkylation process of this<br>
invention is conducted such that the organic reactants, i.e., the alkylatable aromatic compound and the alkylating agent, are brought into contact with an alkylation or transalkylation catalyst in a suitable alkylation or transalkylation reaction zone such as, for example, in a flow reactor containing a fixed bed of the<br>
catalyst composition, under effective alkylation conditions. Such conditions<br>
include a temperature of from about 0°C to about 500°C (32°F to 932°F), and<br>
preferably between about 50°C and about 300°C (122°F to about 572°F), more<br>
preferably, between about 100 to about 285°C (212 to 545°F), a pressure of 689 to<br>
4601 kPa-a (100 to 667 psia), preferably, a pressure of 1500 to 3500 kPa-a (218 to<br>
508 psia), a WHSV based on alkene for overall reactor of 0.1 to 10 hr-1,<br>
preferably, 0.2 to 2 hr-1, more preferably, 0.5 to 1 hr-1, or a WHSV based on both<br>
alkene and benzene for overall reactor of 10 to 100 hr-1, preferably, 20 to SOhr"1, a<br>
molar ratio of alkylatable aromatic compound to alkylating agent of from about<br>
0.1:1 to about 50:1, and preferably can be from about 0.5:1 to about 10:1.<br>
[0035]	The reactants can be in either the vapor phase or partially or<br>
completely in the liquid phase and can be neat, i.e., free from intentional admixture or dilution with other material, or they can be brought into contact with the zeolite catalyst composition with the aid of carrier gases or diluents such as, for example, hydrogen and nitrogen.<br>
[0036]	In another embodiment of the invention, when benzene is alkylated<br>
with ethylene to produce an alkylation reactor effluent that contains ethylbenzene.<br>
The alkylation reaction is preferably carried out in the liquid phase under<br>
conditions including a temperature between 300°F and 600°F (about 150°C to<br>
316°C), more preferably between 400°F and 500°F (about 205°C and 260°C), a<br>

[0038]	The alkylation or transalkylation catalyst that may be useful in this<br>
invention is a crystalline molecular sieve preferably selected from MCM-22 (described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,954,325), MCM-36 (described in detail in U.S. Patent 5,250,277), MCM-49 (described in detail in U.S. Patent 5,236,575), MCM-56 (described in U.S. Patent 5,362,697), and zeolite beta (described in detail in U.S. Patent 3,308,069).<br>
[0039]	One embodiment of this invention is a method of selecting a<br>
transalkylation catalyst based on the selection of the alkylation catalyst or verse visa. By selecting one catalyst of these two interrelated reactions (alkylation and transalkylation), the preferred reaction conditions and corresponding product composition are determined. Based on the selection of one of these two reactions, the selection of the catalyst for another reaction can be determined based on the results to be achieved.<br>
[0040]	In one embodiment, this invention relates to a method for selecting<br>
an alkylation catalyst for a process have an alkylation step and a transalkylation step, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	selecting a transalkylation catalyst having at least one of zeolite having a<br>
zeolite structure type of FAU, *BEA, MWW, MTW, and any combination<br>
thereof,  wherein the  transalkylation  is  maintained  under  conditions<br>
including temperature and pressure to ensure to yield a ratio of a bi-<br>
alkylated aromatic compound(s) conversion over a tri-alkylated aromatic<br>
compound(s) conversion in a range of from about 0.5 to about 2.5; and<br>
(b)	selecting an alkylation catalyst having at least one of MCM-22, MCM-36,<br>
MCM-49, MCM-56, and any combination thereof, wherein the alkylation<br>
catalyst is sufficiently active to maintain at least 90 mol.%, preferably 95<br>
mol.%,   even  more  preferably,   99  mol.%,   alkene  conversion  at  a<br>
temperature range from about 50°C below the temperature of step (a) to<br>
about 100°C above the temperature of step (a).<br>
 [0041]	In yet another embodiment, this invention relates to a method for<br>
selecting a transalkylation catalyst for a process have an alkylation step and a transalkylation step, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	selecting an alkylation catalyst having at least one of MCM-22, MCM-36,<br>
MCM-49, MCM-56, and any combination thereof, wherein the alkylation<br>
catalyst is maintained under conditions including temperature and pressure<br>
to ensure at least 90 mol.%, preferably 95 mol.%, even more preferably,<br>
99 mol.%, alkene conversion; and<br>
(b)	selecting a transalkylation catalyst having at least one of zeolite having a<br>
zeolite structure type of FAU, *BEA, MWW, MTW, and any combination<br>
thereof, wherein the transalkylation is sufficiently active to yield a ratio of a bi-<br>
alkylated   aromatic   compound(s)   conversion   over   a   tri-alkylated   aromatic<br>
compound(s) conversion in a range of from about 0.5 to about 2.5 in a temperature<br>
range from about 100°C below the temperature of step (a) to about 50°C above the<br>
temperature of step (a).<br>
[0042]	The alkylation reactor effluent contains the excess aromatic feed,<br>
monoalkylated aromatic compounds (such as ethylbenzene or cumene),<br>
polyalkylated aromatic compounds (such as polyethylbenzene or<br>
polyisopropylbenzene), and various impurities. The aromatic feed is recovered by<br>
distillation and recycled to the alkylation reactor. Usually a small bleed is taken<br>
from the recycle stream to eliminate unreactive impurities from the loop. The<br>
bottoms from the benzene distillation are further distilled to separate<br>
monoalkylated product from polyalkylated products and other heavies.<br>
[0043]	The term "polyethylbenzene" (PEB) in reference to the<br>
polyalkylated aromatic compounds which are useful herein is to be understood in<br>
accordance with its art-recognized scope which includes, by way of illustration<br>
and not limitation, diethylbenzene (DEB) and triethylbenzene (TEB).<br>
[0044]	The   term   "polyisopropylbenzene"   (PIPB)   in   reference   to<br>
polyalkylated aromatic compounds which are useful herein is to be understood in accordance with its art-recognized scope which includes, by way of illustration and not limitation, diisopropylbenzene (DIPB) and triisopropylbenzene (TIPB).<br>
 [0045]	The polyalkylated products separated from the alkylation reactor<br>
effluent are reacted with alkylatable aromatic feed in a transalkylation reactor, which may or may not be separated from the alkylation reactor, over a suitable transalkylation catalyst. According to the invention, the transalkylation catalyst comprises at least one of MCM-22, MCM-36, MCM-49, MCM-56, zeolite beta, faujasite, mordenite, PSH-3, SSZ-25, ERB-1, ITQ-1, ITQ-2, zeolite Y, Ultrastable Y (USY), Dealuminized Y, rare earth exchanged Y (KEY), ZSM-3, ZSM-4, ZSM-18, ZSM-20, and any combination thereof.<br>
[0046]	The transalkylation reaction of the invention is conducted under at<br>
least partial liquid phase conditions such that the polyalkylated aromatics react with additional alkylatable aromatic compounds to produce additional monoalkylated product. Suitable transalkylation conditions include a temperature of 100°C to 260°C (212°F to 500°F), a pressure of 696 to 5100 kPa-a (101-740 psia), a WHSV based on the weight of the polyalkylated aromatic compounds of about 0.5 to 200 hr-1, and alkylatable aromatic compounds /polyalkylated benzene weight ratio 0.5:1 to 20:1. Preferably, a temperature of 150 to 260°C and a pressure of 696 to 4137 kPa-a (101 to 600 psia), a WHSV based on the weight of the polyalkylated aromatic compounds of about 0.5 to 100 hr-1, a mole ratio of the alkylatable aromatic compound to the polyalkylated aromatic compounds of 1:1 to 10:1<br>
[0047]	In one embodiment of this invention, there is a heat integration<br>
between the alkylation reactor and the transalkylation reactor. For example, the effluent from the alkylation reactor may be used to heat the feed stream of the transalkylation reactor. The effluent from the alkylation reactor may be used to generate steam. In another embodiment of this invention, the heat integration between the alkylation reactor and the transalkylation reactor can be de-coupled. The advantage of de-coupling the heat integration between the alkylation reactor and the transalkylation reactor is that the conditions of the alkylation reactor can be independent determined to the conditions of the transalkylation reactor. Therefore, it is possible to achieve optimum results of these two reactions independently.<br>
 [0048]	Reaction rate-constants were calculated using methods known to<br>
those skilled in the art. See "Principles and Practice of Heterogeneous Catalyst", J.M. Thomas, W.J. Thomas, VCH, 1st Edition, 1997, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Reaction rate constants were calculated for both DEB and TEB under reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, and WHSV) and the ratio of these reaction rate constants was then calculated to examine the relative rates of DEB and TEB conversion. The reactions were assumed to be first order with respect to DEB and TEB and zero order with respect to benzene since it is in excess.<br>
[0049]	In another embodiment of this invention, the process of this<br>
invention can be used to retrofit existing ethylbenzene or cumene plant. In yet another embodiment of this invention, the process of this invention can be used to retrofit existing AlCl3 or BF3 plant. The retrofitting can be done by replacing existing processes and catalysts with the processes and catalysts of this invention. The advantage of retrofitting existing plants is low cost.<br>
[0050]	In one embodiment of this invention, the transalkylation catalyst is<br>
maintained under conditions sufficient to yield a ratio of bi-alkylated aromatic compound(s) rate-constant over tri-alkylated aromatic compound(s) rate-constant in a range of from about 0.5 to about 4, preferably, about 0.5 to 1.5, even more preferably, about 0.5 to about 1, still more preferably about 0.75 to about 1,25, and most preferably, about 0.9 to about 1.2. In another embodiment, the alkylated aromatic compound is cumene, wherein the ratio of bi-alkylated aromatic compound(s) conversion over tri-alkylated aromatic compound(s) conversion in a range of from about 0.5 to about 1, preferably, about 0.5 to 0.9, and most preferably, about 0.6 to about 0.9.<br>
[0051]	When the polyalkylated aromatics are polyisopropylbenzenes and<br>
are contacted with benzene to produce cumene in a transalkylation reactor, the transalkylation conditions preferably include a temperature 50°F to about 100°F (100°C to 200°C), a pressure of 20 to 30 barg (2100-3100 kPa), weight hourly space velocity of 10 to 72 hr-1 on total feed and benzene/PIPB weight ratio 1:1 to 6:1.[0052]	When the polyalkylated aromatics are polyethylbenzenes and are<br>
contacted with benzene to produce ethylbenzene in a transalkylation reactor, the transalkylation conditions preferably include a temperature of 428oF to about 500oF (220 to 260°C), a pressure of 20 to 30 barg (2100 - 3100 kPa-a), weight hourly space velocity of 2 to 6 hr-1 on total feed and benzene/PEB weight ratio 2:1<br>
to 6:1.<br>
[0053]	The effluent from the transalkylation reactor is blended with<br>
alkylation reactor effluent and the combined stream distilled to separate the<br>
desired monoalkylated product<br>
[0054]	The present invention will be described in the following examples.<br>
Example : Transalkylation of PEB to EB<br>
[0055]	The transalkylation feed used in Example was prepared as follows. Chemical<br>
grade benzene and para- and meta-diethylbenzene were purified by percolation over activated alumina. The purified diethylbenzene were mixed 2:1 by weight (parameta). The purified benzene and polyethylbenzenes were mixed 2:1 weight ratio and stored under nitrogen. A gas chromatograph (GC) analysis of the feed provided the composition by weight shown in Table 1.<br>
[0056]	Two   catalysts   were   tested   for   transalkylation   reaction,   a<br>
conventional commercial transalkylation catalyst (low activity catalyst) is made using a zeolite with a structure type of MOR, a Si/Al2 of about 35, a surface area of about 390 m2/g, and extruded to form 1/16" diameter cylindrical extrudates with 20 wt,% alumina. A high activity transalkylation catalyst is made with a zeolite with a structure type of FAU, a Si/Al2 ratio of about 30, a surface area of about 780 m2/g and extruded to form 1/16" diameter cylindrical extrudates with 20 wt% alumina.<br>
[0057]	Liquid feed, which has a composition as shown in table 1, was<br>
introduced with calibrated diaphragm pump. A 12.7 mm (1/2') pipe was used for the reaction vessels and contained 30-35g of catalyst operated in a downflow configuration in isothermal mode. The operating pressure for all experiments was 3204 KPa-a (465 psk). Temperature, Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) and Benzene:Polyethylbenzene (B:PEB) ratio are indicated in the table along with the<br>
corresponding Diethylbenzene (DEB) and triethylbenzene (TEB) conversion and their corresponding first order rate constants (k). The total product was chilled and analyzed with an off-line gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. Results are shown in Table 2.<br>

Table 2:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0058]	The high activity transalkylation catalyst of this invention has a<br>
surprisingly low ratio of DEB conversion over TEB conversion which is in the<br>
range of 0.9 to 1.18, in comparison with conventional transalkylation catalyst<br>
having a ratio of DEB conversion over TEB conversion of 3.<br>
[0059]	The high activity transalkylation catalyst of this invention has a<br>
surprisingly low ratio of DEB rate-constant over TEB rate-constant which is in the<br>
range of 0.875 to 1.2, in comparison with conventional transalkylation catalyst<br>
