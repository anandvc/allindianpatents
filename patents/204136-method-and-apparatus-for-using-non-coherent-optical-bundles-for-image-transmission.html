"METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR USING NON-COHERENT OPTICAL BUNDLES FOR IMAGE TRANSMISSION"<br>
INTEL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation, of 2200 Mission College Boulevard, Santa Clara, California 95052, U.S.A.,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR USING<br>
NON-COHERENT OPTICAL BUNDLES<br>
FOR IMAGE TRANSMISSION<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1.	FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to image transmission systems and, more specifically, to analyzing non-coherent optical bundles for use in image transmission systems.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION<br>
Flexible borescopes, endoscopes, and other optical inspection devices typically use coherent optical bundles to transmit images from one location to another. A coherent optical bundle is a collection of glass fibers wherein the relative position of the fibers within the bundle at each end of the bundle is identical. The glass fibers are used to transmit light from one<br><br>
!<br><br><br>
end to the other end. A coherent optical bundle is often the most expensive part of an optical inspection device. It may contain more than 100,000 individual glass fibers, perfectly arranged in the same matrix position from end to end of a long fiber bundle. In some cases, the length of the bundle is four to five meters. In a coherent optical bundle, it is important that the relative position of the fibers at each end of the bundle be identical in order to transmit an image from one end to the other without scrambling it. In essence, each fiber of the bundle is similar to a pixel in a digital image.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic example of a known, very small coherent optical bundle. It includes only a few fibers in order to simplify the example. The fibers of the bundle may be arranged in a matrix represented as rows and columns. In this example, there are three rows and three columns in the matrix. Each digit shown in Figure 1 represents one glass fiber in the bundle. The fibers (e.g., the digits) are shown in this simple example to represent a rectangular object that may be viewed by a borescope or other optical inspection device. Each fiber transmits a portion of the image representing the object being viewed. If the entire image is to be transmitted correctly along the optical bundle from a sending end to a receiving end, each fiber (e.g., a digit) should be configured in a known relationship in the matrix on both ends of the long optical bundle. Otherwise, the image will be garbled or scrambled when it is received at the receiving end.<br>
Coherent optical bundles work reasonably well in a variety of image transmission devices. However, they are typically quite expensive due to the coherency requirement. In contrast, non-coherent optical bundles are much cheaper. A non-coherent optical bundle is a collection of glass fibers where the position of any fiber at one end of the bundle is not necessarily the same as the position of the fiber at the other end. In fact, the<br><br>
positioning of the fibers within the bundle is typically somewhat random. This does not result in a problem when the bundle is used merely to transmit light from one end to the other for illumination purposes. However, if the non-coherent optical bundle is used for image transmission, the images end up being scrambled at the receiving end, and therefore the transmitted images are of minimal utility. Thus, there is a need in the art to overcome these and other problems by a method of using non-coherent optical bundles for image transmission, in order to reduce the cost of optical inspection devices, for example.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is a method of using a non¬coherent optical bundle having a plurality of fibers for image transmission. The method includes analyzing a configuration of the fibers of the non¬coherent optical bundle to generate a mapping function, obtaining image data at a sending end of the non-coherent optical bundle, transmitting the image data over the non-coherent optical bundle, the image data being scrambled during transmission to produce scrambled image data at a receiving end of the non-coherent optical bundle, and applying the mapping function to the scrambled image data to reproduce the image data.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
An embodiment of the present invention comprises a method and apparatus for analyzing and using a non-coherent optical bundle to simulate<br><br>
a coherent optical bundle so that the non-coherent optical bundle may be used for image transmission.<br>
Reference in the specification to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment" of the present invention means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of the phrase "in one embodiment" appearing in various places throughout the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.<br>
Figure 2 is a simplified schematic diagram of a non-coherent optical bundle as used in an embodiment of the present invention. As in Figure 1, the optical bundle of Figure 2 includes only a few fibers in order to simplify the example. The fibers of the bundle may be arranged in a matrix represented as rows and columns. In this example, there are three rows and three columns in the matrix. Each digit shown in Figure 2 represents one glass fiber in the bundle. Each glass fiber transmits light from one end of the bundle to the other with minimal loss in intensity or color. The fibers (e.g., the digits) are shown in this simple example to represent a rectangular object that may be viewed by a borescope or other optical inspection device. Each fiber transmits a portion of the image representing the object being viewed. Thus, each fiber may be thought of as transmitting a pixel of an image. In contrast to the example of the coherent optical bundle shown in Figure 1, the glass fibers of the non¬coherent bundle shown in Figure 2 are not in the same relative position at the receiving end.<br>
In embodiments of the present invention, the scrambled image data obtained at the receiving end of the non-coherent optical bundle may be processed to effectively reorganize the image data transmitted by the glass fibers to simulate a coherent light bundle. Generally, a reference image or<br><br>
set of reference images may be used to establish individual fiber mapping from the sending end to the receiving end. This mapping is static for each optical bundle so the calibration analysis process only needs to be performed once. The calibration analysis may take place during the system manufacturing process or during system initialization at a user's site. Using the mapping information derived from the calibration process, a computer system such as a personal computer (PC), for example, or other processing element at the receiving end of the optical bundle can re¬arrange the image data transmitted by the glass fibers so that the original image sensed at the sending end of the non-coherent optical bundle may be reconstructed at the receiving end. This image processing may be performed statically on a single image at a time or may be used for continual real-time imaging.<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram of an image transmission system 10 according to an embodiment of the present invention. An image of an object 12 may be sensed by lens 14. The image data may be transmitted over non¬coherent optical bundle 16 to camera 18 or other image handling device (not shown). The image data received by the camera is scrambled due to the non-coherent nature of the non-optical bundle. Camera 16 may forward the scrambled image data to processing system 20. Processing system 20 may be any circuitry capable of performing the calibration and image processing techniques described herein. In one embodiment, it may be a PC, although other general purpose computer systems, special purpose processing systems, and specialized hardware may also be used. The processing system performs image processing methods described below to rearrange the scrambled image data to provide corrected image data. The corrected image data may then be displayed on a display 22.<br>
- Before scrambled Image data may be translated into corrected image data, the non-coherent optical bundle used in the image transmission<br><br>
system must be calibrated. Figure 4 is a diagram of a system for analyzing a configuration of a non-coherent optical bundle according to an embodiment of the present invention. Object lens 30 may be focused on apixel-based raster display 32. Display 32 may be a cathode ray tube (CRT) computer monitor for example, although other displays such as televisions or liquid crystal displays (LCDs) may also be used. The object lens may be coupled to a sending end of a non-coherent optical bundle 34. The light sensed by the object lens from one or more pixels of the display may be transmitted along the glass fibers of the non-coherent optical bundle from the sending end to the receiving end. This light may be applied through imager lens 36 to focus on imager 38. Imager 38 may be a charge coupled device (CCD) image array or analog image sensor. In one embodiment, imager lens 36 and imager may be included in a camera. In another embodiment, a solid state imager may be bonded directly to the end of the non-coherent optical bundle, thereby eliminating the imager lens from the system.<br>
Both display 32 and imager 38 are addressable as an array of pixels. To "calibrate" the non-coherent optical bundle, a test program being executed by a processor (not shown in Figure 4) may be used to selectively illuminate at least one pixel on the display at a predetermined intensity level and position. The resulting image transmitted along the non¬coherent optical bundle may be sensed by the imager. The position and intensity of the light received by the imager may be recorded in a storage device such as a random access memory (RAM), in a file on a hard disk, or on other non-volatile storage (not shown in Figure 4). Next, the process may be repeated for a different set of one or more pixels until all pixels of the display have been illuminated and processed. By obtaining information about which glass fibers are transmitting light from a selected set of one or more pixels of the display on the sending end to the imager at the receiving<br><br>
end over the set of tests, a mapping function may be created by the processor to translate scrambled image data from the glass fibers into corrected image data. Thus, the complete color and intensity of all pixels on the display can be reconstructed back to their proper locations in an image array at the receiving end. Once the mapping function has been determined, the non-coherent optical bundle may be used for imaging in an image transmission system because the computer system may translate the scrambled image data into corrected image data according to the mapping function.<br>
Figure 5 is a diagram of an example of glass fibers of a non-coherent optical bundle being analyzed according to an embodiment of the present invention. A selected pixel may be illuminated on the display. This pixel is represented as a square box for the display end of the bundle in Figure 5. Only a portion of the display end of the bundle is shown in this example. Note that in this example, the pixel is smaller than a single fiber and the light from the pixel may be transmitted along three fibers. Fiber number 3 receives about 50% of the pixel illumination, and fibers 1 and 2 each receive about 15% of the pixel's illumination. In other embodiments and examples, the pixels may be equal to or larger than a fiber, the fibers may not be round, and the pixel's illumination may be transmitted by one or more fibers, and the invention is not limited in scope in these respects. The light is carried along the non-coherent optical bundle to the receiving end. The fibers of the bundle may be randomly positioned within the bundle from the sending end to the receiving end. Thus, the pixels illuminated on the imager may be non-contiguous as shown. The illumination levels of individual imager pixels depend on the percentage of display pixel illumination on the respective fibers and the position of the projected light on the imager pixels by the illuminated fibers. To "calibrate" the non-coherent optical bundle, the illumination levels of all<br><br>
pixels on the imager may be recorded for a given set of one or more pixels being illuminated on the display. For each test set of one or more pixels, a list of illuminated imager pixels may be compiled and their respective percentage illumination levels may be created. This calibration information may be stored in a storage medium for subsequent use.<br>
When focusing the object lens on an object in a scene instead of the display, the calibration information may be used to reconstruct an image of the.scene. In this embodiment, a reconstructed image of the object scene would have the same pixel resolution as the calibration display, resulting in a 1:1 mapping of calibration display pixels to object scene pixels. The list of imager pixels and their illumination levels associated with each display pixel may be used, at least in part, to reconstruct the intensity of the original display pixel. The object scene illumination level of each imager pixel in the list of imager pixels, associated with a display pixel, may be adjusted with the imager pixel's illumination level that was previously recorded during calibration analysis, and summed, resulting in reconstruction of the object scene pixel. By repeating this process for each display pixel, a corrected image of the scene captured by the object lens may be reconstructed.<br>
In other embodiments, different calibration analysis techniques may be used to similar effect in reconstructing the scrambled image. In another embodiment, the calibration analysis technique may be made scaleable by sorting the list of pixels by percentage illumination levels and only processing those entries that contribute the most light to the image first. As more processing power becomes available, then more list entries may be processed for each display pixel.<br>
In one embodiment, calibration analysis and image generation techniques for non-coherent bundles may be implemented in the C programming language as shown below in Table I, although the present<br><br>
invention is not limited in scope in this respect. Alternatively, other programming languages and techniques may be used to implement the present invention.<br>

In the preceding description, various aspects of the present invention have been described. For purposes of explanation, specific numbers, systems and configurations were set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it is apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without the specific details. In other instances, well-known features were omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the present invention.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination of both. However, embodiments of the invention may be implemented as computer programs executing on programmable systems comprising at least one processor, a data storage system (including volatile and non-volatile memory and/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. Program code may be applied to input data to perform the functions described herein and generate output information. The output information may be applied to one or more output devices, in known fashion. For purposes of this application, a processing system 20 of Figure 6 includes any system that has a processor, such as, for example, a digital signal processor (DSP), a microcontroller, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or a microprocessor.<br><br>
The programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a processing system. The programs may also be implemented in very high speed integrated circuit hardware description language (VHDL), assembly or machine language, if desired. In fact, the invention is not limited in scope to any particular programming language. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language.<br>
The calibration and image translation programs may be stored on a storage media or device (e.g., hard disk drive, floppy disk drive, read only memory (ROM), CD-ROM device, flash memory device, digital versatile disk (DVD), or other storage device) readable by a general or special purpose programmable processing system, for configuring and operating the processing system when the storage media or device is read by the processing system to perform the procedures described herein. Embodiments of the invention may also be considered to be implemented as a machine-readable storage medium, configured for use with a processing system, where the storage medium so configured causes the processing system to operate in a specific and predefined manner to perform the functions described herein.<br>
An example of one such type of processing system is shown in FIG. 6. Sample system 400 may be used, for example, to execute the processing for embodiments of a method for using a non-coherent optical bundle in an image transmission system, in accordance with the present invention, such as the embodiment described herein. Sample system 400 is representative of processing systems based on the PENTIUM®II, PENTIUM® III, and CELERON™ microprocessors available from Intel Corporation, although other systems (including personal computers (PCs) having other microprocessors, engineering workstations, set-top boxes and the like) may also be used. In one embodiment, sample system 400 may<br><br>
be executing a version of the WINDOWS™ operating system available from Microsoft Corporation, although other operating systems and graphical user interfaces, for example, may also be used.<br>
Figure 6 is a block diagram of a system 400 of one embodiment of the present invention. The computer system 400 includes a processor 402 that processes data signals. Processor 402 may be coupled to a processor bus 404 that transmits data signals between processor 402 and other components in the system 400.<br>
System 400 includes a memory 406. Memory 406 may be a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device, a static random access memory (SRAM) device, or other memory device. Memory 406 may store instructions and/or data represented by data signals that may be executed by processor 402. The instructions and/or data may comprise code for performing any and/or all of the techniques of the present invention. Memory 406 may also contain additional software and/or data (not shown). A cache memory 408 may reside inside processor 402 that stores data signals stored in memory 406. Cache memory 408 in this embodiment speeds up memory accesses by the processor by taking advantage of its locality of access. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the cache memory may reside external to the processor.<br>
A bridge/memory controller 410 may be coupled to the processor bus 404 and memory 406. The bridge/memory controller 410 directs data signals between processor 402, memory 406, and other components in the system 400 and bridges the data signals between processor bus 404, memory 406, and a first input/output (I/O) bus 412. In some embodiments, the bridge/memory controller provides a graphics port for coupling to a graphics controller 413. In this embodiment, graphics controller 413 interfaces to a display device (not shown) for displaying<br><br>
images rendered or otherwise processed by the graphics controller 413 to a user.<br>
First I/O bus 412 may comprise a single bus or a combination of multiple buses. First I/O bus 412 provides communication links between components in system 400. A network controller 414 may be coupled to the first I/O bus 412. The network controller links system 400 to a network that may include a plurality of processing systems (not shown in Figure 6) and supports communication among various systems. In some embodiments, a display device controller 416 may be coupled to the first I/O bus 412. The display device controller 416 allows coupling of a display device to system 400 and acts as an interface between a display device (not shown) and the system. The display device receives data signals from processor 402 through display device controller 416 and displays information contained in the data signals to a user of system 400.<br>
