SIZED GLASS STRANDS, SIZING COMPOSITION AND<br>
COMPOSITES COMPRISING THE SAID STRANDS<br>
The invention relates to glass strands coated with a<br>

generally has the appearance of a fluid resin.<br>
The materials to be reinforced may incorporate the<br>
glass strands in various forms: continuous or chopped<br>
strands, fabrics, continuous or chopped strand mats,<br>
etc.<br>
The composites intended to be used as translucent<br>
panels for walls and roofs are generally reinforced by<br>
chopped glass strands having a length of about 50 mm,<br>
or more. These panels may especially be obtained by a<br>
process which consists in chopping glass strands coming<br>
from one or more packages above a conveyor belt<br>

required for this type of panel are an attractive<br>
appearance, with as few strands visible as possible (in<br>
particular what are called "white strands"), good<br>
mechanical properties, possibly good weatherability<br>
and, in the case of translucent panels, a high level of<br>
translucency.<br>
The quality of the composites obtained by this process<br>
depend to a great extent on the properties provided by<br>
the glass strands and by the size which coats them. In<br>
particular, sizing compositions are sought which allow<br>
the strand to open up at the time of chopping so that<br>
it can fall onto the conveyor in a uniform manner.<br>
Strands coated with these sizing compositions must also<br>
be able to be easily wetted or impregnated to the core<br>
(that is to say on the surface of the filaments<br>
constituting the strand) by the resin. If impregnation<br>
is imperfect, there is a risk of air bubbles being<br>
trapped in the resin and the strands have a milky white<br>
appearance making them visible through the panel, hence<br>
a less attractive final appearance and a loss of trans-<br>
parency.<br>
It is also desirable for the sizing compositions to<br>
allow rapid processing, in particular for the strands<br>
to be impregnated within a very short space of time, of<br>
about 5 to 15 seconds, this being imposed in order to<br>
produce these composites under industrial conditions.<br>
Finally, it is necessary that the panels possess<br>
mechanical reinforcement properties suitable for the<br>
use to which they are intended, in particular good<br>
tensile strength.<br>
However, although the sizing composition has to allow<br>
the strand to open up, it must allow the strand to<br>
retain sufficient integrity to prevent it from bursting<br>
at the moment of chopping. Bursting of the strand<br>
releases the filaments of which it is made and these<br>
filaments have a tendency to agglomerate and form a<br>
"fuzz". The presence of fuzz has two major drawbacks:<br>
firstly, it disturbs the proper operation of the<br>
chopper and secondly it drops in clusters onto the<br>
blanket, thus impairing the quality of impregnation and<br>
consequently that of the panel.<br>
It may therefore be appreciated that such compositions<br>
are difficult to develop as the intended properties are<br>
often somewhat incompatible with one another and that<br>
it is consequently necessary to search for the best<br>
compromise.<br>
Glass strands that can be used as reinforcements in<br>
polymer-based composites have already been proposed, in<br>
particular for forming translucent panels or profiled<br>
elements. These strands are coated with an aqueous<br>
sizing composition which generally includes at least<br>
one adhesion promoter combined with other agents useful<br>
in sizing, such as lubricants, coupling agents, anti-<br>
static agents, etc.<br>
In US-A-4 752 527, the sizing composition proposed<br>
comprises a polyester based on bisphenol A (called<br>
"polyester of the bisphenol A type") as adhesion<br>
promoter, a coupling agent, a lubricant and an anti-<br>
static agent. The solids content in the composition is<br>
from 1 to 30% by weight.<br>
In US-A-5 219 656 a size is described which comprises,<br>
as adhesion promoter, a polyester of the bisphenol A<br>
type or an epoxy, a coupling agent, a lubricant and an<br>
allyl compound, in particular a triallyl cyanurate. The<br>
presence of the latter compound on the surface of the<br>
glass strands makes it possible to obtain a composite<br>
which retains its translucent character for a longer<br>
time.<br>
In US-A-5 242 958 and US-A-5 604 270, the adhesion<br>
promoter is an epoxy used by itself or in combination<br>
with a polyester of the bisphenol A type, a<br>
polyurethane, a poly(urea-urethane) , a polyester-<br>
urethane or a polyetherurethane. The composition<br>
furthermore includes a coupling agent and a lubricant.<br>
It has also been proposed to use as adhesion promoter<br>
unsaturated compounds having a defined degree of<br>
unsaturation for the purpose of controlling the rate of<br>
impregnation of the glass strands.<br>
Thus, in US-A-4 789 593, the sizing composition<br>
contains an epoxidized polyester or an esterified epoxy<br>
comprising fewer than 1.5 aliphatic double bonds per<br>
mole and having a ratio of the number of aliphatic<br>
unsaturated groups to the number of aromatic<br>
unsaturated groups of less than 0.1, together with a<br>
lubricant and a coupling agent.<br>
In US-A-6 139 958, the adhesion promoter is a polyester<br>
of the bisphenol A type or an epoxy esterified by one<br>
or more fatty acids containing fewer than 1.4 aliphatic<br>
double bonds per mole and possessing a ratio of the<br>
number of aliphatic unsaturated groups to the number of<br>
aromatic unsaturated groups of less than 0.1, and it is<br>
used as a mixture with a poly (vinyl acetate). The<br>
composition also includes a coupling agent, a lubricant<br>
and an antistatic agent.<br>
The role of the polyester in the compositions just<br>
mentioned is to improve the ability of the glass strand<br>
to be wetted or impregnated by the resin. This allows a<br>
panel having a very high degree of translucency to be<br>
obtained. However, the fact remains that the glass<br>
strands coated with these sizes have an ability to open<br>
up during chopping which remains poor and that their<br>
processing is not entirely satisfactory.<br>
The object of the invention is to develop glass strands<br>
coated with a sizing composition which, while allowing<br>
translucent composite panels of attractive appearance<br>
to be obtained, containing few visible strands and<br>
exhibiting good mechanical properties, are easier to<br>
process, especially owing to the improved way in which<br>
they open up during chopping. As indicated above, this<br>
is because it is essential for the chopped strands to<br>
be able to be uniformly distributed on the conveyor and<br>
form a homogeneous blanket, free of any agglomerates of<br>
strands and capable of being rapidly impregnated by the<br>
resin.<br>
These objectives are achieved by the present invention<br>
whose subject is glass strands coated with an<br>
essentially aqueous sizing composition, this<br>
composition being characterized in that it combines at<br>
least one polyurethane (hereafter denoted "A") and at<br>
least one polyester (hereafter denoted "B") in an A/B<br>
weight ratio of less than 5.<br>
In the present invention, the expression "glass strands<br>
coated with a sizing composition" is understood to mean<br>
glass strands "which have been coated with a sizing<br>
composition which comprises...", that is to say not<br>
only glass strands coated with the composition in<br>
question, such as those obtained immediately after the<br>
sizing member(s), but also the same strands after they<br>
have undergone one or more further treatments, for<br>
example one or more drying steps, for the purpose of<br>
removing water or possible solvents present in the<br>
composition, and/or of curing/crosslinking certain<br>
constituents of the said composition.<br>
Again within the context of the invention, the term<br>
"strands" should be understood to mean the base strands<br>
resulting from a multitude of filaments being gathered<br>
beneath the bushing, and the products derived from<br>
these strands, especially the assemblies of these base<br>
strands in the form of rovings. Such assemblies may be<br>
obtained by simultaneously unwinding base strands from<br>
several packages and then by assembling into fibre<br>
bundles which are wound onto a rotating support. They<br>
may also be called "direct" rovings having a linear<br>
density equivalent to that of assembled rovings,<br>
obtained by gathering filaments, directly beneath the<br>
bushing, and winding them onto a rotating support.<br>
Also according to the invention, the expression<br>
"essentially aqueous sizing composition" is understood<br>
to mean a composition which contains at least 90%,<br>
preferably at least 93% and even better 94 to 96% water<br>
by weight, at least one lubricating agent and at least<br>
one coupling agent.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the glass strands are coated with a sizing composition<br>
whose polyurethane has a molecular mass of less than<br>
20,000 and preferably between 4,000 and 14,000.<br>
Preferably, the polyurethane is chosen from<br>
polyurethanes obtained by the reaction of at least one<br>
polyisocyanate with at least one polyol having an<br>
aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic chain.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the<br>
glass strands are coated with a sizing composition<br>
whose polyester is chosen from polyesters obtained by<br>
the reaction of a poly(alkylene glycol) with a<br>
carboxylic acid and/or with a carboxylic anhydride.<br>
Preferably, the polyester results from the reaction of<br>
a poly(alkylene glycol) with phthalic anhydride and<br>
maleic anhydride.<br>
The combination of polyurethane A and polyester B<br>
proves to be advantageous for forming glass strands<br>
having improved opening at chopping. It has been found<br>
that the polyurethane, while still being able to bind<br>
the strands together, possesses sufficient flexibility<br>
for it not to adhesively bond to the filaments too<br>
strongly. Consequently strand opening during chopping<br>
is improved thereby. It has been discovered that a<br>
small amount of polyurethane in the sizing composition<br>
is sufficient to obtain the desired effect.<br>
In general, very satisfactory results are obtained by<br>
combining polyurethane (s) A with polyester (s) B in an<br>
A/B weight ratio of less than or equal to 5, preferably<br>
between 0.05 and 2 and better still between 0.25 and<br>
1.5. An A/B ratio of less than 1 proves to be<br>
particularly advantageous as it allows both easy<br>
processing during manufacture of the panels and<br>
improved properties of the panels obtained, especially<br>
as regards tensile strength.<br>
The glass strands coated with a sizing composition<br>
combining a polyurethane resulting from the reaction of<br>
at least polyisocyanate with at least one polyol having<br>
an aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic chain and a<br>
polyester obtained by the reaction of a poly(alkylene<br>
glycol) with phthalic and maleic anhydrides prove to be<br>
particularly advantageous for the intended manufacture<br>
of translucent composite panels.<br>
According to the definition given above, the sizing<br>
composition coating the glass strands includes at least<br>
one lubricating agent whose function consists<br>
especially in protecting the strands from mechanical<br>
abrasion during their manufacture and in stiffening the<br>
strand. The combination of several lubricants makes it<br>
possible in particular to adapt the rate of<br>
impregnation of the strands by the resin. The<br>
lubricating agent is generally chosen from water-<br>
soluble cationic compounds, such polyalkyleneimides,<br>
and non-ionic compounds, of the type based on fatty<br>
acid esters and on a poly(alkylene glycol) or<br>
poly(oxyalkylene), such as polyethylene glycol<br>
monolaurate, or of the type based on fatty amides and a<br>
poly(oxyalkylene), such as amides of hydrogenated<br>
tallow and polyoxyethylene. Preferably, a<br>
polyethyleneimide is used.<br>
In accordance with the definition given above, the<br>
sizing composition coating the glass strands comprises<br>
at least one coupling agent chosen from compounds<br>
containing one or more functional organic groups, for<br>
example an acryloxy, methacryloxy, glycydoxy or amino<br>
group. Preferably, the coupling agent is a silane, and<br>
better still an alkoxysilane containing at least one of<br>
the aforementioned groups. Methacryloxysilanes, such as<br>
gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, and amino-<br>
silanes, such as N-benzylaminoethylpropylammonium-<br>
trimethoxysilane hydrochloride, are preferred.<br>
Advantageously, the composition includes at least two<br>
coupling agents, at least one of which is a silane<br>
containing at least one acrylic or methacrylic<br>
functional group and the other of which is a silane<br>
containing at least one amine functional group.<br>
The glass strands coated with the sizing composition<br>
according to the invention have a loss on ignition of<br>
less than 1.5%, preferably between 0.45 and 0.8% and<br>
better still between 0.45 and 0.65.<br>
Usually the glass strands according to the invention<br>
are in the form of packages of base strands which are<br>
subjected to a heat treatment. This treatment is<br>
intended essentially to remove the water and the<br>
solvents provided by the sizing composition and, where<br>
appropriate, to crosslink the reactive groups of the<br>
adhesion promoters. The conditions under which the<br>
packages are treated may vary according to the mass of<br>
the package. In general, the drying is carried out at a<br>
temperature of around 110 to 140°C for several hours,<br>
preferably 12 to 18 hours.<br>
As already mentioned, the base strands thus obtained<br>
are generally extracted from the package and joined<br>
with several other base strands into a fibre bundle<br>
which is then wound onto a rotating support in order to<br>
form a roving. It has been found that applying a<br>
composition containing a cationic antistatic agent of<br>
the quaternary ammonium salt type to the strands makes<br>
it possible to remove the electrical charges generated<br>
during chopping. Thus, by depositing the aforementioned<br>
composition on the base strands, after they have been<br>
extracted from the package and assembled to form the<br>
bundle, the distribution of the chopped strands and the<br>
appearance of the final panel are appreciably improved.<br>
Preferably, the strands are coated with an aqueous<br>
composition containing 20 to 35%, preferably around<br>
2 5%, of cocotrimethylammonium chloride by weight. The<br>
amount deposited on the strands is generally from 0.01<br>
to 0.05% and preferably around 0.03%.<br>
The strands coated with the sizing composition<br>
according to the invention, possibly with the<br>
composition described in the previous paragraph, may<br>
consist of glass of any kind provided that it is<br>
capable of being fiberized, for example E, C and AR<br>
glass, and preferably E glass.<br>
These same strands are formed from filaments whose<br>
diameter may vary greatly, for example from 9 to 16 urn<br>
and preferably from 11 to 13 urn.<br>
Advantageously, the strands have a linear density of<br>
between 15 and 60 tex, and better still around 30 tex.<br>
Consequently, even when relatively large diameter<br>
filaments are used, the strand remains capable of being<br>
chopped, forming a uniform blanket, and capable of<br>
being rapidly impregnated by the resin, thereby making<br>
it possible to have excellent reinforcement while<br>
retaining the translucency of the composite panel.<br>
Another subject of the invention is the sizing<br>
composition capable of coating the said glass strands,<br>
which composition is characterized in that it<br>
comprises:<br>
• at least one polyurethane A<br>
• at least one polyester B<br>
• at least one lubricating agent<br>
• at least one coupling agent and<br>
• water,<br>
the A/B weight ratio being less than 5.<br>
Preferably, the sizing composition comprises:<br>
• 2 to 5% by weight of polyurethane A<br>
• 3.65 to 5.85% by weight of polyester B<br>
• 0.02 to 0.04% by weight of lubricating agent<br>
• 0.10 to 0.33% by weight of coupling agent and<br>
• at least 90% water.<br>
Preferably, the sizing composition comprises at least<br>
93%, better still 94%, by weight of water.<br>
Particularly preferably, the composition has an A/B<br>
weight ratio of between 0.05 and 2 and better still<br>
between 0.25 and 1.5.<br>
It is also possible to introduce other constituents as<br>
additives into the sizing composition. As examples of<br>
additives, mention may be made of:<br>
- organic antistatic agents, such as cationic<br>
alkoxylated quaternary ammonium salts, or inorganic<br>
antistatic agents, such as chromium chloride or the<br>
chloride of an alkali or alkaline-earth metal,<br>
especially lithium or magnesium;<br>
- crosslinking agents, such as monomers, dimers,<br>
trimers or oligomers of melamine-formaldehyde and N-<br>
methylole compounds; and<br>
antioxidants, such as sterically hindered<br>
phenols, diarylamines, thioethers, quinones and<br>
phosphates.<br>
In this case, the total content of these additives does<br>
not in general exceed 0.5%, preferably 0.2% by weight<br>
of the composition.<br>
The solids content of the sizing composition is<br>
generally between 2 and 10%, preferably 2 and 5% and<br>
advantageously around 3%.<br>
The subject of the invention is also the composite<br>
panels comprising the glass strands coated with the<br>
sizing composition. Such panels comprise at least one<br>
thermosetting polymer material, preferably a polyester,<br>
a vinyl ester, an acrylic, a phenolic resin or an epoxy<br>
resin, and glass strands, some or all of which consist<br>
of glass strands according to the invention. The glass<br>
content within the composite is generally between 20<br>
and 40%, preferably between 25 and 35%, by weight. The<br>
thickness of the panel may vary widely, for example<br>
from 0.5 to 3 mm and preferably from 1 to 2 mm. In<br>
addition to the low content of visible strands and of<br>
their translucency, the panels according to the<br>
invention are advantageous in that they have a better<br>
tensile strength as indicated in the illustrative<br>
examples which follow and which allow the invention to<br>
be illustrated without however limiting it.<br>
In these examples, the properties relating to the<br>
strand coated with the sizing composition and to the<br>
composite panel incorporating the said strand are<br>
measured as follows:<br>
- the loss on ignition, in %, is measured under<br>
the conditions in the ISO 1887 standard;<br>
- the fuzz and the tension of the strand are<br>
measured by making the strand run over a device<br>
consisting of eight turn rolls at a speed of 50 m/min.<br>
The device is placed in a room conditioned to 20°C and<br>
50% relative humidity. The fuzz is defined by the<br>
amount of fibrils, in mg, obtained after 1 kg of the<br>
strand has been run out. The tension of the strand,<br>
expressed in g, is representative of the behaviour of<br>
the strand during the subsequent processing, especially<br>
its ability to be unwound. A strand having a tension<br>
greater than about 2000 g is not generally satisfactory<br>
as it does not easily lend itself to being chopped and<br>
has a tendency to fray, impairing the quality of the<br>
blanket. This is because such a strand produces a large<br>
quantity of fuzz which builds up at the chopper and<br>
drops in clusters onto the blanket;<br>
- the tensile strength of the strand is measured<br>
under the conditions in the ISO 3341 standard. It is<br>
expressed in g/30 tex;<br>
- the tack (or ability to stick) is determined by<br>
means of a device comprising a system for driving the<br>
strand at a constant speed (6 m/min) and a metal pulley<br>
made of hard chrome steel, connected to a 70 g<br>
counterweight and over which the strand slides. The<br>
tension of the strand on the pulley is continuously<br>
measured over 60 m of strand. The average value of the<br>
tension, expressed in g, corresponds to the tack;<br>
- the electrostatic charge density is obtained by<br>
chopping the strand, freely unwound (no tensioner) by<br>
means of a chopper provided with two blades (chopped<br>
length: 50 mm; pressure on the anvil roll: 5 kg) and<br>
placed in a chamber at 20°C and at a relative humidity<br>
of 20%. The chopped strand is recovered in a metal<br>
container equipped with a Faraday cage. The density of<br>
changes which have built up during chopping is<br>
expressed in nanocoulombs per gram of strand (nC/g);<br>
- the openness at chopping allows the quality of<br>
the chopped strand dispersion to be evaluated. It is<br>
determined by chopping the strand using a chopper<br>
(Schmit and Heinzman; chopping speed: 110 rpm; chopped<br>
strand length: 50 mm) above a conveyor belt running at<br>
a speed of 15 m/min., the chopping being carried out<br>
under controlled temperature and humidity conditions<br>
(20°C; 50% relative humidity). A felt (mass: about<br>
15 g) is obtained in which the number of agglomerated<br>
strands in the form of logs (2400 tex) , sticks (300 to<br>
2400 tex) and clumps (60 to 300 tex) are counted. The<br>
openness at chopping is given by the following<br>
equation:<br>
openness at chopping = 5 x (number of logs) + 2 x<br>
(number of sticks) + 1 x (number of clumps)<br>
in which 5, 2 and 1 are the weighting coefficients<br>
reflecting the size of the strands in the intended<br>
application;<br>
the rate of 50% impregnation and of 100%<br>
impregnation are measured as follows:<br>
A chopped strand preform (200 mm x 200 mm; about<br>
50 g) deposited beforehand on a Mylar® sheet, is<br>
impregnated with the resin consisting of:<br>
- non-thixotropic polyester resin<br>
NORSODINE S 2010 V sold by Cray Valley) 120 g<br>
- accelerator (NL 51 P sold by Akzo<br>
Nobel) 0.12 g<br>
- Catalyst (BUTANOX M 50 sold by Akzo<br>
Nobel) 1.2 g<br>
After having deposited the resin on the preform, a<br>
chequer-board grid, defining squares having sides<br>
of 200 mm separated by 28 mm, is placed on top and<br>
the number of squares impregnated by the resin as<br>
a function of time is counted. The rate of<br>
impregnation is defined by the time needed to<br>
obtain 50% impregnation and 100% impregnation of<br>
the preform;<br>
the translucency of the composite panel<br>
incorporating the strands coated with the sizing<br>
composition and the presence of white strands within<br>
this panel are assessed visually on a panel made in the<br>
following manner:<br>
A chopped strand preform (200 mm x 200 mm; about<br>
33g), deposited beforehand on a Mylar® sheet, is<br>
impregnated with the polyester resin having the<br>
following composition:<br>
- Resin 3080 LA (sold by Cray Valley) 90 g<br>
- styrene 9 g<br>
- LUPEROX K2 catalyst (sold by Elf<br>
Atochem) 1 g<br>
- NL 51 P accelerator (sold by Akzo<br>
Nobel) 0.5 g<br>
The impregnated preform is covered with a Mylar®<br>
sheet and is then outgassed by passing a suitable<br>
roller over the preform before it is cured in an<br>
oven (temperature rise: 85°C to 130°C in 7<br>
minutes).<br>
• for the translucency test, the preform is<br>
obtained from strands taken from a roving. The<br>
translucency is rated on a scale ranging from 1<br>
(not very translucent) to 5 (translucency of<br>
window glass).<br>
• for the white strand test, the preform is<br>
obtained from strands coming from the outer<br>
portion of a package of base strand that has<br>
undergone the heat treatment. The presence of<br>
white strands is rated according to a scale<br>
ranging from 1 (very many strands visible) to 5<br>
(not strand visible);<br>
- the tensile strength of the panel, in MPa, is<br>
measured under the conditions in the ISO 527-4<br>
standard, the panel being manufactured in accordance<br>
with the ISO 1268 standard.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A sizing composition comprising the following (in % by<br>
weight) was prepared:<br>
• nonionic aliphatic/cycloaliphatic<br>
polyurethane(1) (molecular mass: 14 000) 2.00<br>
• nonionic unsaturated polyester(2) 5.85<br>
• lubricant: polyethyleneimide(3) 0.025<br>
• silane(4) 0.23<br>
• aminosilane(5) 0.10<br>
• 90% acidic acid 0.015<br>
• water qsp 100.<br>
The preparation of the sizing composition was carried<br>
out in the following manner:<br>
- the methoxy groups of the silanes(4) and (5) were<br>
hydrolysed by adding acid to an aqueous solution of<br>
these silanes, the solution being kept stirred. Next,<br>
the other constituents of the sizing composition were<br>
introduced, again with stirring, and the pH was<br>
adjusted to a value of 5.0 ± 0.3 if necessary;<br>
the solids content of the composition thus<br>
prepared was 3% by weight;<br>
- the sizing composition was used to coat, in a<br>
known manner, E glass filaments about 12 um in diameter<br>
drawn from streams of molten glass flowing out of 2400<br>
orifices of a bushing, the filaments then being<br>
assembled in the form of a package of base strands<br>
having a linear density of 30 tex;<br>
the package was then dried at 130°C for 12<br>
hours;<br>
an antistatic acqueous solution containing<br>
25 wt % cocotrimethy1 ammonium chloride(6) was applied to<br>
the base strands extracted from the package and<br>
assembled into rovings consisting of 80 base strands<br>
(solids content deposited: 0.03%); and<br>
- the properties of the strand unwound from the<br>
roving and of the panel incorporating this strand are<br>
given in Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The conditions for this example were as in Example 1,<br>
but modified in that the polyurethane and polyester<br>
contents (in % by weight) were the following:<br>
• nonionic aliphatic/cycloaliphatic<br>
polyurethane(1) 3.45<br>
• nonionic unsaturated polyester(2) 4.80<br>
The solids content of the composition was 3% by weight.<br>
The properties of the strand thus obtained and of the<br>
panel incorporating this strand are given in Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The conditions for this example were as in Example 1,<br>
but modified in that the polyurethane and polyester<br>
contents (in % by weight) were the following:<br>
• nonionic aliphatic/cycloaliphatic<br>
polyurethane(1) 5.00<br>
• nonionic unsaturated polyester(2) 3.65<br>
The solids content of the composition was 3% by weight.<br>
The properties of the strand thus obtained and of the<br>
panel incorporating this strand are given in Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 (COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE)<br>
The conditions for this example were as in Example 1,<br>
but modified in that the polyurethane and polyester<br>
contents (in % by weight) were the following:<br>
• nonionic aliphatic/cycloaliphatic<br>
polyurethane(1) 8.00<br>
• nonionic unsaturated polyester(2) 1.45<br>
The solids content of the composition was 3.2% by<br>
weight. The properties of the strand thus obtained and<br>
of the panel incorporating this strand are given in<br>
Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The conditions for this example were as in Example 1,<br>
but modified in that the following constituents were<br>
present in the composition (in % by weight):<br>
• nonionic aliphatic/cycloaliphatic<br>
polyurethane(1) 3.45<br>
• nonionic unsaturated polyester(2&gt; 4.80<br>
• aminosilane(5) 0.20<br>
The solids content of the composition was 3% by weight.<br>
The properties of the strand thus obtained and of the<br>
panel incorporating this strand are given in Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The conditions for this example were as in Example 1,<br>
but modified in that following constituents were<br>
present in the composition (in % by weight):<br>
• nonionic aliphatic/cycloaliphatic<br>
polyurethane(1) 5.00<br>
• nonionic unsaturated polyester(2) 3.65<br>
• aminosilane(5) 0.20<br>
• lubricant: polyethyleneimide(3) 0.040<br>
The solids content of the composition was 3% by weight.<br>
The properties of the strand thus obtained and of the<br>
panel incorporating this strand are given in Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 (COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE)<br>
The conditions for this example were as in Example 1,<br>
but modified in that the composition contained no<br>
nonionic aliphatic/cycloaliphatic polyurethane(1) but<br>
did contain 7.3% by weight of nonionic unsaturated<br>
polyester(2) .<br>
The solids content of the composition was 3.8% by<br>
weight. The properties of the strand thus obtained and<br>
of the panel incorporating this strand are given in<br>
Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 (COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE)<br>
The conditions for this example were as in Example 1,<br>
but modified in that the composition contained no<br>
nonionic unsaturated polyester'2' but did contain 10% by<br>
weight of nonionic aliphatic/cycloaliphatic<br>
polyurethane(1) .<br>
The solids content of the composition was 3.8% by<br>
weight. The properties of the strand thus obtained and<br>
of the panel incorporating this strand are given in<br>
Table 1.<br>
On examining Table 1, it may be seen that the glass<br>
strands of Examples 1 to 3, 5 and 6 according to the<br>
invention exhibit good openness at chopping and allow a<br>
composite panel having both good translucency and few<br>
white strands to be obtained. This level of performance<br>
is superior to that of strands coated with a size<br>
containing a polyester (Example 7), especially in terms<br>
of openness at chopping, or containing only a<br>
polyurethane (Example 8) which results in a large<br>
number of white strands.<br>
The strands according to the invention thus prove to be<br>
easier to process than the strands currently proposed<br>
for the intended application, especially the strands<br>
coated with a size based on a polyester/epoxy mixture<br>
(Example Cl) or on only a polyester (Example C3).<br>
The strands according to the invention thus give the<br>
panel a better appearance, especially as regards the<br>
number of white strands, compared with the strands<br>
which are recommended more particularly for the<br>
manufacture of the intended panels, such as the strands<br>
of Example C2 coated with a poly(vinyl acetate)-based<br>
size. Compared with these same strands, the strands<br>
according to the invention furthermore allow a better<br>
tensile strength to be obtained.<br>
The glass strands coated with the sizing composition<br>
which combines a polyurethane with a polyester in a<br>
weight ratio of less than or equal to 1.5 are<br>
remarkable in that they possess both excellent openness<br>
at chopping (less than 30) and high reinforcement<br>
properties (especially a tensile strength of at least<br>
100 MPa) while maintaining a translucency and a number<br>
of visible strands which are very satisfactory for the<br>
intended application.<br>
