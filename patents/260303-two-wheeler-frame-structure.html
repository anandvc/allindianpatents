DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Typically, a frame structure for a two wheeler comprises a sub-fiame and a main frame. The sub-frame is attached to the main frame using fasteners and holds components like a head tube cover, a front license plate mounting bracket and electrical units like a horn and a regulator. However, this arrangement leads to increased number of loose parts.<br><br>
Furthermore, the main frame comprises a head tube, a main tube having one end attached to the head tube and an engine mounting arrangement attached to the other end of the main tube. One or more swing arms are attached to the engine mounting arrangement with the help of a swing arm pivot tube. The frame structure fmiher comprises one or more upper tubes attached to the main tube. One or more rear shock absorber mounting brackets are attached to the upper tubes. Rear shock absorbers are attached to the rear shock absorber mounting brackets at one end and to the swing arms at the other end. Conventionally, the rear shock absorber mounting brackets are added to provide additional support to the rear shock absorbers.<br>
A pillion handle mounting bracket is attached to the upper tubes. The top of the pillion handle mounting bracket is supported by the upper tubes whereas the bottom is an open shell. Hence no support is provided for the pillion handle mounting bracket of conventional ftame structures, thereby leading to vibrations in the pillion handle mounting bracket.<br>
One or more side tubes are attached to the upper tubes at one end and to the engine mounting arrangement at the other end. The attachment of the side tubes to the engine mounting arrangement defines the stiffness of the frame structure. The side tubes can be attached to the engine mounting arrangement above or below the chain line. However, attaching the side tubes below the chain line may lead to the brushing of the side tube on the left hand side with the chain while driving. Generally, to avoid the contact of the left hand side tube with the chain, the side tubes are attached to the engine mounting arrangement at a location above the chain line. Alternately, the side tubes<br><br>
extend below the chain line via utilization of alternate sleeker raw material in left hand side tube or by bashing the left hand side tube with leinfoTcements.<br>
The subject matter disclosed herein is a two wheeler frame structure which overcomes the foregoing and other drawbacks and possesses improved quality, reduced cost, and enhanced safety.
