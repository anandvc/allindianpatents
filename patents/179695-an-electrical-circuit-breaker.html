The present Invention rolatet to •<br>
electrical circuit breaker having per pole a pair of contacts elastically urged into contact in the closed position of the circuit breaker and capable of separating due to the action of electrodynamic repulsion forces when the current flowing through the contacts exceeds a preset threshold to generatei limitation of said current, said trip device having an overload ahd/or short-circuit fault detector which actuates an automatic opening operating mechanism of the circuit breaker on a fault.<br>
A state-of-the-art trip device (US-A-3,631,369) of the kind mentioned comprises a movable blade, arranged as, a bimetal atrip and subjected to the action of the electromagnetic trip device. An extension of the blade protrudes into the gas outflow duct of the arc extinguishing chamber. When breaking occurs the gas flow moves the blade to the tripping position. In most circuit breakers the gas outflow duct is located, away from the trip device and €he previously mentioned device is therefore not applicable. The blade is subjected to the polluting action of the gases and its correct operation is quickly hindered. Bach pole must be equipped with, a trip device of this kind and selectivity of tripping is not conceivable for the actuator reacting to the gas flow is integrated in the thermal and magnetic trip device.<br>
The object of the present invention is to achieve a trip device providing both limitation and selectivity of tripping by simple, universal and reliable means.<br><br><br>
The trip device is characterized in that said actuating device constitutes a leaktight assembly only in communication with the contact tone, and having a limited actuating travel.<br>
The pressure in the contact zone, notably in the arc<br>
extinguishing chamber, is a direct function of the power of the . arc, and can quickly reach high values, for example from 3 to 10 ; bars. This overpressure acts on a simple membrane or movable . piston device which actuates the circuit breaker tripping i mechanism. The pressure 'rise and transmission of this pressure 1 to the detector take place all the more quickly the higher the |currents are. The device is however not sensitive to weak<br>
currents, and spurious tripping on a simple overload can easily | be avoided by providing a return spring of the piston, or of the<br>
measuring membrane.<br>
The actuator is a leaktight or almost leaktight assembly constituted by the cylinder with the piston or membrane and the connecting duct between the cylinder and the arc extinguishing chamber. This duct of small cross-section can be relatively long and is easily housed in the case. The movement of the piston ionly requires a very small gas flow in the duct and this flow . takes place almost totally before pollution of the gases due to jthe action of the arc. The actuator is thus protected from these polluted gases.<br>
{High-speed opening of a limiting circuit breaker is not easily compatible with selectivity of tripping which requires opening ... of the circuit breaker directly upstream from the fault, whereas the other downstream circuit breakers remain closed to ensure continuity of power supply to the sound part of the mains system. It has been attempted to achieve selectivity conditions between two circuit breakers fitted serially, by coordinating<br><br>
th^ir tripping curve, taut these conditions are difficult to maintain for the times involved are extremely short. Saturation phenomena often mask measurement of the differences of the currents to be broken, and selectivity is not always achieved.<br>
The present invention is based on the observation that a break in a limiting circuit breaker always generates a high arc voltage, and thereby a notable arc energy resulting in a pressure increase in the breaking zone. This pressure increase is very high-speed, and selectivity can be achieved by using a return spring weighted in such a way as to trip at a preset pressure. Indeed, when two circuit breakers of different ratings have the same short-circuit current flowing through them, the pressure in the. upstream circuit breaker is much lower than if it had broken on its own and selectivity is automatically achieved in a particularly simple manner, for only the circuit breaker having the lower rating trips. This selectivity is absolutely independent from the overload and/or short-circuit fault detector, whose design can be adapted to its role of operating on small currents. The action of the fault detector can be slightly delayed in order*to avoid any interference with the overpressure actuator, which provides instantaneous protection as soon as it is required.<br>
According to a development of the invention, each pole of a multipole circuit breaker comprises an overpressure actuator, so as to operate as soon as an overpressure occurs in any one of the poles, and to perform tripping as quickly as possible. The piston of the overpressure actuator can be common to the different poles, the latter being connected to the piston by ducts equipped with an anti-return device. The different arc extinguishing chambers are preferably connected to a common manifold with a check valve interposed, this manifold itself being connected by a duct to the piston or membrane of the overpressure actuator, which acts on the circuit breaker trip<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Other advantages and features will become more clearly apparent from the following description of an illustrative embodiment of the invention, given as a non-restrictive example only and represented in the accompanying drawing*, in which :<br>
Figure  1  is  a  schematic  axial   section  view of   a pole  of  a<br>
circuit breaker equipped vith an overpressure actuator according<br>
to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is an enlarged scale view or the overpressure actuator according to figure lr<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic view of the overpressure actuator associated with o three-pole circuit breaker;<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic sectional view of an overpressure actuator associated with a polarized relay of a solid-state jtrip device';<br>
Figure 5 represents the variation curves- of the tripping characteristics.<br><br><br>
In figure 1/ a pole of a molded case circuit breaker 10 comprises a pair of contacts 11, 12 located in an arc extinguishing chamber 13 equipped with deioni2ation platee 14. The arc extinguishing chamber 13 is bounded by partitions 15 on* of which has passing through it a support arm 16 of the movable contact 12. The arc extinguishing chamber 13 is almost leaktight and communicates by a channel 17 of small cross-section with the outside of the molded case 10. The movable contact arm 16 i». pivotally mounted on a bar. 18 belonging to an operating mechanism 19, having a manual opening and closing handle 20 of the contacts 11/ 12 and a latch 21 controling tripping of the mechanism 1?. The movable contact 12 is biased by a spring,22 to the closed position/ and is capable of pivoting counterclockwise due to the electrodynamic repulsion.force generated by the current flowing in the contact arm 16 and contacts 11, 12. The latch 21 is controled by a trip bar 23 common to the different, poles of the circuit breaker. The circuit breaker comprises a standard trip device with a bimetal strip 24, and electro¬magnetic coil 25, both acting on the trip tbar 23. A circuit breaker of this kind is well-known to those specialized in the art and does not need to be described in greater detail here.'It is sufficient to recall that when a short-circuit occurs, repulsion of the contacts 11, 12 brings about high-speed opening of these contacts, against the force of the spring 22, thI»V. high-speed opening causing limitation of the short-cirouit • current. Opening of the contacts 11, 12 is confirmed by the operation of the electromagnetic trip device 25 acting via the trip bar 23 on the l&amp;tch 21, which opens the circuit breaker mechanism 19.<br>
According to the present invention, the circuit breaker comprises an overpressure actuator comprising a piston 26 and f cylinder 27 assembly cooperating with the trip bar 23. Referring<br><br><br><br>
pole causes tripping by the pressure increase in its arc extinguishing chamber 13, this trip causing all the poles of the circuit breaker to open.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, illustrated by figure 3, three poles PI, P2, P3 of a three-pole circuit breaker communicate via ducts 31 with a manifold 32, itself connected to the chamber 30 of the overpressure actuator 2€&gt; 27. The orifice via which the ducts 31 enter the manifold 32 is capable of being blocked off by a check valve 33, preventing the gases from flowing from one pole to the other; In the example represented in figure 3, the pressure increase in the arc extinguishing chamber of the first pole PI is the quickest, and this pressure is transmitted via the duct 31 and manifold 32 to the overpressure actuator 26, 27, the-valve 33 being open. The other two poles P2, P3 are isolated from the manifold 32 by closing of their corresponding valve 33, and the actuating device remains almost leaktight.<br>
The invention is applicable to circuit breakers with solid-state trip devices using current transformers to detect an overload or short-circuit. These current transformers supply a signal to an electronic processing device which delivers a tripping order to a polarized relay 34 when preset thresholds are exceeded. Referring to figure 4, it can be seen that the polarized relay 34 comprises a plunger core 35 held in the retracted position by a permanent magnet 36, and biased to the operating position-of the trip bar 23, by; means of a push-rod 38, by a spring 37. the tripping order is transmitted to a coil 39 which releases the core 35. The overpressure actuator 26, 27 is adjacent to the polarized relay 34 and the rod 28 is located facing the trip bar . 23 to actuate the latter when an overpressure occurs. The trip bar 23 bears a lug 40, capable of cooperating with the rear face of the head of the push-rod 38, leaving a clearance' "j", sufficient for movement of the trip bar 23 due td the action of<br><br>
the overpressure actuatar 26, 27, without the core 35 of the relay 34 moving. This Tug 40 causes discharging of the polarized relay 34 afte: the mechanism 19'has tripped.<br>
Operation of the circuit breaker with solid-state trip device is naturally identical to that described above with a standard trip device. In both cases, the high-speed operation of the overpressure actuator allows a small time delay of the trip device on a fault, this time delay being able to be obtained by a simple clearance between4 the electromagnetic trip device and the trip bar, or between the polarized relay 34 and this trip bar 23. Any other delay means, for example of the runner type can bt used.<br>
The curves in figure 5 show the mode of action of the trip device according to the invention. Curve "a" shows the separation distance of the contacts 11, 12, on opening on a short-circuit by electrodynamic repulsion of the movable contact 12. Curve "bu shows the variation of the arc voltage corresponding to opening of the contacts 11, 12. Curve "c" illustrates the increase of the presumed short-circuit current, whereas curve "d" corresponds to the current limited by the electrodynamic repulsion of the contacts 11, 12. Curve "e" shows the pressure variation in the arc extinguishing chamber 13. Separation of the contacts 11, 12 takes place at a time "tl" and the overpressure actuator causes opening of the mechanism 19, and thereby that of the three poles of the circuit breaker at a time "t2" confirming ^opening of the contacts by electrodynamic repulsion. A piston 26, with a diameter of 10mm, has enabled amply sufficient forces to be obtained to actuate the trip bar 23. A piston of this size can easily be housed in the molded . case 10, and the duct 31 of small cross-section enables the pressure to be picked up at any point of the arc extinguishing chamber 13. The usual leaktightness of the arc extinguishing chambers 13 is amply sufficient to obtain the necessary<br><br>
overpressures,,, and it is not necessary to provide additional leaktightness means of these chambers. The assembly is particularly simple and selectivity is obtained by using return springs 29 of suitable size.<br><br><br>
