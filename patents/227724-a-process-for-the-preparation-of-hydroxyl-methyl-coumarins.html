				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING SUBSTITUTED COUMARINS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing substituted coumarins.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for preparing substituted<br>
coumarins using polyaniline salts as catalysts.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Coumarins are an important group of naturally occurring compounds, widely<br>
distributed in the plant kingdom and have been produced synthetically for many years<br>
for commercial use. Members of this group display a broad range of applications - as<br>
fragrances, pharmaceuticals, additives to food, cosmetics, agrochemicals. optical<br>
brightening agents, dispersed fluorescent and tunable dye lasers, and biological'<br>
activities like anthelmintic, hypnotic, insecticidal and anticoagulant properties.<br>
Coumarins also act as intermediates for the synthesis of fluorocoumarins, chromones,<br>
coumarones. and 2-acylresorcinol. [See - Boisde et al, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of<br>
Chemical Technology (Ed.. Jacqueline I. Kroschwitz). 4th Edition. Vol.7. Pages 647<br>
658 and references therein]. Coumarin and some of its derivatives have been<br>
identified in plants and many of them have been synthesized and studied for their<br>
physiological activity. 7-hydroxy coumarin, known as umbelliferone, occurs naturally<br>
in gum resins of Umbelliferae and is an important coumarin metabolite. It is readily<br>
manufactured from resorcinol and maleic or fumaric acid. Derivatives of<br>
umbelliferone have attracted interest as sunburn preventives on account of their wide<br>
spectrum of UV absorption.<br>
7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (Î² - methylumbelliferone) is used as<br>
fluorescent brightener, efficient laser dye for pulsed and SW operation, standard for<br>
the flurometric determination of enzyme activity, as a starting material for the<br>
preparation of an insecticide (Hymerocromone), as precursor for furano coumarins<br>
and many other derivatives of substituted coumarins and as analytical reagents. 5,7-<br>
dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin is used in suntan oils as sunscreen, and in wall paints as<br>
whitening agents. Coumarin and its derivatives can be synthesized by various<br>
methods which include Perkin reaction (Donnelly et al, Tetrahedron, 1968, vol 24, p-<br>
2617-2622). Knoevenagel reaction (Franca Bigi et al. J. Org. Chem., 1999. vol 64, p-<br>
1033-1035). Wittig reaction (Yavari et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1998. vol 39. p- 2391-<br>
2392), Pechmann reaction (John et al, J. Org. Chem., 1961, vol 26, p- 240 - 242) and<br>
Reformatsky reaction. Among these methods, Pechmann reaction is the most widely<br>
used method for the preparation of substituted coumarins since it proceeds from very<br>
simple starting materials and gives good yields of various substituted coumarins.<br>
Substituted coumarins have been prepared using various reagents such as<br>
H2SO4. POC13 (Ahmad et al. Proc. Indian Acad. Sci., 1937, vol.5 A, p- 277-284),<br>
AlCh (Das gupta et al, J. Chem. Soc., 1969, p- 29-33), Cation exchange resins (John<br>
et al, J. Org. Chem., 1961, vol 26. p- 240-242), trifluoro acetic acid (Woods et al, J.<br>
Org. Chem.. 1962, vol 27, p- 3703-3705), Montmorillonite clay (Bhattacharyya et al,<br>
Ind. J. Chem.. 1992. vol 3IB. p628). solid acid catalysts (Bekkum et al, J. Chem.<br>
Soc.. Chem. Commun., 1995. p- 225-226), W/ZrO2 solid acid catalyst (Reddy et al,<br>
Synth. Commun., 2001, vol 31 (23), p- 3603-3607), Chloroaluminate ionic liquid<br>
(Khadilkar et al, Synlett. 2002, No 1. p- 152-154) and Nafion-H catalyst (Chaudhari,<br>
Chem. Ind., 1983, p- 569-570).<br>
Condensation is one of the most fundamental and important reactions in<br>
organic synthesis. Conventionally, the processes of making coumarins can be carried<br>
out by:<br>
(a) Liquid-phase reaction utilizing a liquid catalyst: This type of process utilizes liquid<br>
phase acids, such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, or sulfonic acid, as catalysts.<br>
(b) Liquid phase reaction utilizing a solid catalyst: This type of processes typically<br>
utilizes inorganic salts, cation exchange resin and solid acid catalyst etc.<br>
One problem associated with liquid-phase reaction using liquid-catalyst, is that<br>
the acidic catalysts of sulfuric acid or sulfonic acid can cause corrosion problems to<br>
the reactor. These liquid acid catalysts are also discharged along with reaction<br>
products, thus causing severe waste disposal and pollution problems.<br>
The drawbacks of using mineral acids as catalysts are: (i) Catalyst can not be<br>
reused, (ii) Disposal of acid is not environmentally safe and it is not economical, (iii)<br>
Low selectivity is frequently observed, (iv) Corrosion of the reaction vessel and<br>
reactors, (v) Not easy to handle and (vi) High inventory of the catalyst.<br>
The solid-catalyst in liquid-phase reaction, which typically utilizes a cation<br>
exchange resin as catalyst, ameliorates the -osion and waste disposal problems<br>
experienced with the liquid-catalyst in phase processes, and results in<br>
simplified separation procedure required between the reaction product and catalysts.<br>
However, cation exchange resins typically exhibit relatively poor heat-resistance, and<br>
they often lose substantial activity after being subject to heat. Once the catalytic activity of the cation exchange resins is reduced, it is difficult to be regenerated.<br>
Objects o the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of hydroxyl methyl coumarins using polyaniline salts as catalysts, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of hydroxyl methyl coumarins, which comprises reacting a phenol selected from the group consisting of resorcinol, phloroglucinol and pyrogallol with a keto ester selected from the group consisting of methyl acetoacetate, ethyl acetoacetate and phenyl acetoacetate in the presence of a catalyst comprising a polyaniline salt, optionally in presence of solvent at a temperature in the range of 110 to 170Â°C, for a time period in the range of 3 to 24 hrs, separating by known methods the hydroxyl methyl coumarins from the reaction mixture.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention, the keto esters used is selected from methyl acetoacetate, ethyl acetoacetate and phenyl acetoacetate.<br>
In an yet another embodiment of the present invention, the catalysts is a polyaniline salt selected from polyaniline-sulfate, polyaniline-hydrochloride, polyaniline-nitrate, polyaniline-perchlorate, polyaniline-sodium bisulfate, polyaniline-p-toluene sulfonate, polyaniline-trifluoroacetate and polyaniline-sulfosalicylate system.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention, the reaction is carried out for a period of 3 to 24 hrs.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention, the catalyst amount used is 10% to 30% with respect to phenols.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of keto ester used is 1, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 equivalent with respect to one equivalent of phenols.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention, there solvent is selected from toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and p-chloro toluene.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
These embodiments will be apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the present invention.<br>
The process of preparation of substituted coumarins is carried out by reacting<br>
phenols with keto esters in presence of catalyst and then removing the catalyst by<br>
conventional methods. The substituted coumarins can be isolated such as filtration<br>
followed by isolation of product by conventional methods.<br>
The novelty of the invention resides in the use of polyaniline salt as catalyst in<br>
the preparation of substituted coumarins. The use of polyaniline salts as catalysts<br>
provides the following advantages: (i) separation of catalyst from a reaction mixture<br>
is easy, (ii) repeated use of catalyst is possible, (iii) there is no problem for the<br>
disposal of used catalyst as they are environmentally safe and (iv) preparation of the<br>
catalyst is a straight forward synthetic route.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should<br>
not be construed as limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The following example illustrates preparation of polyaniline-sulfate salt using<br>
benzoyl peroxide. 4.85g of benzoyl peroxide was dissolved in 150ml acetone. To this<br>
solution. 1.44g of sodium lauryl sulfate in 25ml distilled water was added. 2.4 ml<br>
aniline in 30 ml aqueous solution containing sulfuric acid (9.0 ml) was introduced<br>
drop wise into the above solution at 35Â°C and stirred the mixture for 8 h. Precipitated<br>
polyaniline salt was filtered off, and then washed with 3 L of distilled water, followed<br>
by methanol. Resulting polymer salt was finally dried at 100Â° C until a constant mass<br>
was reached.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The following example illustrates preparation of different polyaniline salts<br>
from polyaniline base. In a typical experiment, polyaniline-sulfate salt prepared using<br>
example 1 was constantly stirred in 1 M NaOH for 8 h, filtered, washed with water<br>
and finally dried at 100Â°C till a constant mass. Dedoped polyaniline base (0.5 gm) was<br>
introduced into the 50 ml acid solution (1 M) and the mixture left stirring at constant<br>
temperature for 4 h. The polyaniline salt was filtered and then washed with distilled<br>
water until the washing liquid was colorless. Finally, the resulting polymer salt was<br>
washed with acetone and subsequently dried at 100Â°C till a constant mass. Acid used<br>
and the corresponding polyaniline salts are given in Table I.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The following example illustrates the preparation of different grade of<br>
polyaniline-sulfate salts from polyaniline base using different amount of sulfuric acid.<br>
In a typical experiment, polyaniline-sulfate salt prepared using example 1 was<br>
constantly stirred in 1 M NaOH for 8 h, filtered, washed with water and finally dried<br>
at 100Â°C till a constant mass. The dedoped polyaniline base (0.5gm) was introduced<br>
into different concentration of sulfuric acid (0.1. 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0 M) and the mixture<br>
left under stirring at constant temperature for 4h. Polyaniline salt was filtered and then<br>
washed with distilled water until washing liquid was colorless. Finally, resulting<br>
polymer salt was washed with acetone and subsequently dried at 100 C till a constant<br>
mass.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Following example illustrates preparation of polyaniline-sulfate salt using<br>
different oxidizing agents. In a typical experiment, aqueous solution of oxidizing<br>
agent (0.1M) was added very slowly into l.OM H2SO4acid solution containing 0.1M<br>
aniline at a temperature of 0-5Â° C. After all the oxidant was added, the reaction<br>
mixture was stirred at constant temperature for 4 hours. The oxidation of aniline is<br>
highly exothermic and, therefore, the rate of addition of the oxidant was adjusted to<br>
prevent any increase in the temperature of the reaction mixture. Precipitated<br>
polyaniline was filtered and then washed with distilled water until washing liquid was<br>
colorless. In order to remove oligomers and other organic by products, precipitate was<br>
washed with methanol until the methanol solution was colorless. Finally, resulting<br>
polymer salt was washed with acetone and subsequently dried at 100 C till a constant<br>
mass. Oxidizing agents used in reaction are given in Table II.<br>
