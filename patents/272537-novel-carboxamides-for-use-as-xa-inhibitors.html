the tautomers, the enantiomers, the diastereomers, the mixtures thereof and the<br>
salts thereof are particularly preferred.<br>
Within the scope of the present application, where applicable, the "isomer",<br>
"stereoisomer", "diastereomer", "enantiomer", "chiral", "racemate" or "racemic<br>
mixture" are defined as follows. Compounds of the same empirical formula<br>
which differ in the nature or arrangement of the bonding of their atoms or their<br>
connectivity or the spatial arrangement of the atoms in the molecule are known<br>
as "isomers". Isomers which differ in the spatial arrangement of the atoms in<br>
the molecule and are not congruent, while having the same type of connectivity<br>
of their atoms, are known as "stereoisomers". Stereoisomers which do not<br>
behave as image and mirror image to one another are known as<br>
"diastereomers", and stereoisomers which behave as an image and mirror<br>
image to one another are known as "enantiomers". Where an asymmetric<br>
centre or atom is present (also known as a stereocentre or chiral centre), for<br>
example in the case of a carbon atom substituted by four different substituents,<br>
the molecule has the attribute "chiral", and a pair of enantiomers is possible. An<br>
enantiomer may be characterised by the absolute configuration of its<br>
stereocentre. The absolute configuration is described by means of the<br>
descriptors (R) and (S), which are determined by the application of the<br>
sequence rules according to Cahn, Ingold and Prelog , or by describing the<br>
rotation of the plane of polarised light as it interacts with the molecule, which is<br>
referred to as dextrorotatory or laevorotatory (i.e. accordingly with (+) or (-) as<br>
the descriptor). A chiral compound may occur both as an individual enantiomer<br>
or as a mixture of the corresponding enantiomers. A mixture which contains<br>
equal amounts of both enantiomers of a compound is known as a "racemate" or<br>
"racemic mixture".<br>
According to the invention the compounds of general formula I are obtained by<br>
methods known per se, for example by the following methods:<br>
-58-<br>
(a) In order to prepare compounds of general formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R3 to R5 are as hereinbefore defined and Z1 denotes the hydrogen<br>
atom or a protective group and B1 denotes a group of formula<br>
wherein R7 and R8 are as hereinbefore defined:<br>
cyclisation of a compound of general formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
optionally formed in the reaction mixture<br>
wherein<br>
R3 to R5, R7 and R8 are as hereinbefore defined and Z1 denotes the hydrogen<br>
atom or a protective group, after which any protective group used is cleaved.<br>
The cyclisation is conveniently carried out in a solvent or mixture of solvents<br>

example bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(ll)choride, palladium(ll)-[1,1'-bis-<br>
(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]-chlorideortetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)-<br>
palladium(O) in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, AMsopropyldiethylamine,<br>
A/,A/-diisopropyl-ethylamine, potassium-fe/t-butoxide, sodium<br>
carbonate or caesium carbonate, optionally in the presence of ligands such as<br>
triphenylphosphine, tri-o-tolylphosphine, tri-te/t-butylphosphine, 1,3-bis-<br>
(diphenylphosphino)-propane, 2,2'-bis-(diphenylphosphino)-1,1I-dinaphthyl, 1,1'-<br>
bis-(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene, xantphos and optionally in the presence of a<br>
transition metal compound such as a copper halide such as for example<br>
copper(l)iodide and at temperatures between 20 and 120°C, preferably at<br>
temperatures between 20 and 90°C under argon or nitrogen atmosphere (cf.<br>
also K. Sonogashira, Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, Vol. 3, page 52ff.,<br>
Pergamon Press, Oxford 1991).<br>
Any silyl protective group present such as for example trimethylsilyl is preferably<br>
cleaved in a solvent or mixture of solvents such as water, methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, acetone, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide in the<br>
presence of a base such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
carbonate or sodium methoxide. For cleaving in organic solvents such as for<br>
example diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or dichloromethane<br>
it is also possible to use fluoride reagents, such as for example<br>
tetrabutylammonium fluoride, lithium fluoride or potassium fluoride, optionally<br>
with the addition of a complexing agent such as 18-crown-6-ether.<br>
In the reactions described above any reactive groups present such as hydroxy,<br>
carboxy, amino, alkylamino or imino groups may be protected during the<br>
reaction by conventional protecting groups which are cleaved again after the<br>
reaction. For example, a suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group may be<br>
the methoxy, benzyloxy, trimethylsilyl, acetyl, benzoyl, tert.butyl, trityl, benzyl or<br>
tetrahydropyranyl group,<br>
suitable protecting groups for a carboxyl group might be the trimethylsilyl,<br>
methyl, ethyl, tert.butyl, benzyl or tetrahydropyranyl group,<br>
suitable protecting groups for an amino, alkylamino or imino group might be the<br>
acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzoyl, ethoxycarbonyl, tert.butoxycarbonyl,<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl or 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group and<br>
additionally, for the amino group, the phthalyl group.<br>
Other protective groups and their cleaving are described in T.W. Greene,<br>
P.G.M. Wuts, "Protecting Groups in Synthesis", Wiley, 1991 and 1999.<br>
Any protecting group used may optionally subsequently be cleaved for example<br>
by hydrolysis in an aqueous solvent, e.g. in water, isopropanol/water,<br>
tetrahydrofuran/water or dioxane/water, in the presence of an acid such as<br>
trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or in the presence of an<br>
alkali metal base such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium<br>
hydroxide or by ether splitting, e.g. in the presence of iodotrimethylsilane, at<br>
temperatures between 0 and 100°C, preferably at temperatures between 10<br>
and 50°C.<br>
However, a benzyl, methoxybenzyl or benzyloxycarbonyl group is cleaved<br>
hydrogenolytically, for example, e.g. with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst<br>
such as palladium/charcoal in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl<br>
acetate, dimethylformamide, dimethylformamide/acetone or glacial acetic acid,<br>
optionally with the addition of an acid such as hydrochloric acid at temperatures<br>
between 0 and 50°C, but preferably at ambient temperature, and at a hydrogen<br>
pressure of 1 to 7 bar, preferably, however, 1 to 5 bar.<br>
A methoxybenzyl group may also be cleaved in the presence of an oxidising<br>
agent such as cerium(IV)ammonium nitrate in a solvent such as methylene<br>
chloride, acetonitrile or acetonitrile/water at temperatures of between 0 and<br>
50°C, but preferably at ambient temperature.<br>
A methoxy group is expediently cleaved in the presence of boron tribromide in a<br>
solvent such as methylene chloride at temperatures between -35 and -25°C.<br>
A 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group is preferably cleaved in trifluoroacetic acid in the<br>
presence of anisol.<br>
A terf.butyl or te/tbutyloxycarbonyl group is preferably cleaved by treating with<br>
an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid, optionally using a<br>
solvent such as methylene chloride, dioxane or ether.<br>
A phthalyl group is preferably cleaved in the presence of hydrazine or a primary<br>
amine such as methylamine, ethylamine or n-butylamine in a solvent such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, toluene/water or dioxane at temperatures<br>
between 20 and 50°C.<br>
An allyloxycarbonyl group is cleaved by treating with a catalytic amount of<br>
tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0), preferably in a solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran and preferably in the presence of an excess of a base such as<br>
morpholine or 1,3-dimedone at temperatures between 0 and 100°C, preferably<br>
at ambient temperature and under an inert gas, or by treating with a catalytic<br>
amount of tris-(triphenylphosphine)-rhodium(l)chloride in a solvent such as<br>
aqueous ethanol and optionally in the presence of a base such as<br>
1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane at temperatures between 20 and 70°C.<br>
Compounds of general formulae (II), wherein the group B' is represented by a<br>
group of general formula (III), and (IV) may be prepared for example<br>
analogously to K. Maekawa, J. Ohtani, Agr. Biol. Chem. 1976, 40, 791-799.<br>
Moreover the compounds of general formula I obtained may be resolved into<br>
their enantiomers and/or diastereomers.<br>
Thus, for example, the compounds of general formula I obtained which occur<br>
as racemates may be separated by methods known per se (cf. Allinger N. L.<br>
and Eliel E. L. in "Topics in Stereochemistry", Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971)<br>
into their optical antipodes and compounds of general formula I with at least 2<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms may be resolved into their diastereomers on the<br>
basis of their physical-chemical differences using methods known per se, e.g.<br>
by chromatography and/or fractional crystallisation, and, if these compounds<br>
are obtained in racemic form, they may subsequently be resolved into the<br>
enantiomers as mentioned above.<br>
The enantiomers are preferably separated by column separation on chiral<br>
phases or by recrystailisation from an optically active solvent or by reacting with<br>
an optically active substance which forms salts or derivatives such as e.g.<br>
esters or amides with the racemic compound, particularly acids and the<br>
activated derivatives or alcohols thereof, and separating the diastereomeric<br>
mixture of salts or derivatives thus obtained, e.g. on the basis of their<br>
differences in solubility, whilst the free antipodes may be released from the pure<br>
diastereomeric salts or derivatives by the action of suitable agents. Optically<br>
active acids in common use are e.g. the D- and L-forms of tartaric acid or<br>
dibenzoyltartaric acid, di-o-tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid,<br>
camphorsulphonic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid or quinic acid. An optically<br>
active alcohol may be for example (+) or (-)-menthol and an optically active acyl<br>
group in amides may be a (+)- or (-)-menthyloxycarbonyl, for example.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of formula I may be converted into the salts<br>
thereof, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the physiologically acceptable<br>
salts with inorganic or organic acids. Acids which may be used for this purpose<br>
include for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid,<br>
methanesulphonic acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid,<br>
citric acid, tartaric acid or maleic acid.<br>
Moreover, if the new compounds of formula I contain a carboxy group, they may<br>
subsequently, if desired, be converted into the salts thereof with inorganic or<br>
organic bases, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the physiologically<br>
acceptable salts thereof. Suitable bases for this purpose include for example<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cyclohexylamine, ethanolamine,<br>
diethanolamine and triethanolamine.<br>
As already mentioned, the compounds of general formula I as well as the<br>
tautomers, the enantiomers, the diastereomers and the physiologically<br>
acceptable salts thereof have valuable pharmacological properties, particularly<br>
an antithrombotic activity, which is preferably based on an effect on thrombin or<br>
factor Xa, for example on a thrombin-inhibiting or factor Xa-inhibiting activity, on<br>
a prolonging effect on the aPTT time and/or on an inhibiting effect on related<br>
serine proteases such as e.g. urokinase, factor Vila, factor IXa, factor Xla and<br>
factor XI la.<br>
The compounds listed in the experimental section were investigated for their<br>
effect on the inhibition of factor Xa as follows:<br>
Method:<br>
Enzyme-kinetic measurement with chromogenic substrate. The quantity of pnitroaniline<br>
(pNA) released from the colourless chromogenic substrate by<br>
human factor Xa is determined photometrically at 405 nm. It is proportional to<br>
the activity of the enzyme used. The inhibition of the enzyme activity by the test<br>
substance (in relation to the solvent control) is determined at various<br>
concentrations of test substance and from this the ICso is calculated, as the<br>
concentration which inhibits the factor Xa used by 50 %.<br>
Material:<br>
Tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane buffer (100 mMol) and sodium chloride (150<br>
mMol), pH 8.0 plus 1 mg/ml Human Albumin Fraction V, protease-free<br>
Factor Xa (Calbiochem), spec, activity: 217 lU/mg, final concentration: 7 ID/ml<br>
for each reaction mixture<br>
Substrate S 2765 (Chromogenix), final concentration: 0.3 mM/l (1 KM) for each<br>
reaction mixture<br>
Test substance: final concentration 100, 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003,<br>
0.001<br>
Procedure:<br>
10 jj.l of a 23.5-times concentrated starting solution of the test substance or<br>
solvent (control), 175 jal of TRIS/HSA buffer and 25 nl of a 65.8 U/L Factor Xa<br>
working solution are incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C. After the addition of<br>
25 \i\ of S 2765 working solution (2.82 mMol/l) the sample is measured in a<br>
photometer (SpectraMax 250) at 405 nm for 600 seconds at 37°C.<br>
Evaluation:<br>
1. Determining the maximum increase (deltaOD/minutes) over 21 measuring<br>
points.<br>
2. Determining the % inhibition based on the solvent control.<br>
3. Plotting a dosage/activity curve (% inhibition vs substance concentration).<br>
4. Determining the ICso by interpolating the X-value (substance concentration)<br>
of the dosage/activity curve at Y = 50 % inhibition.<br>
All the compounds tested had an IC50 value of less than 100 umol/L<br>
The compounds prepared according to the invention are generally well<br>
tolerated.<br>
In view of their pharmacological properties the new compounds and the<br>
physiologically acceptable salts thereof are suitable for the prevention and<br>
treatment of venous and arterial thrombotic diseases, such as for example the<br>
prevention and treatment of deep leg vein thrombosis, for preventing<br>
reocclusions after bypass operations or angioplasty (PT(C)A), and occlusion in<br>
peripheral arterial diseases, and for preventing and treating pulmonary<br>
embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation and severe sepsis, for<br>
preventing and treating DVT in patients with exacerbation of COPD, for treating<br>
ulcerative colitis, for treating and preventing coronary thrombosis, for<br>
preventing stroke and the occlusion of shunts. In addition, the compounds<br>
according to the invention are suitable for antithrombotic support in thrombolytic<br>
treatment, such as for example with alteplase, reteplase, tenecteplase,<br>
staphylokinase or streptokinase, for preventing long-term restenosis after<br>
PT(C)A, for the prevention and treatment of ischaemic incidents in patients with<br>
all forms of coronary heart disease, for preventing metastasis and the growth of<br>
tumours and inflammatory processes, e.g. in the treatment of pulmonary<br>
fibrosis, for preventing and treating rheumatoid arthritis, for preventing and<br>
treating fibrin-dependent tissue adhesions and/or the formation of scar tissue<br>
and for promoting wound healing processes. The new compounds and the<br>
physiologically acceptable salts thereof may be used therapeutically in<br>
conjunction with acetylsalicylic acid, with inhibitors of platelet aggregation such<br>
as fibrinogen receptor antagonists (e.g. abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban,<br>
roxifiban), with physiological activators and inhibitors of the clotting system and<br>
the recombinant analogues thereof (e.g. Protein C, TFPI, antithrombin), with<br>
inhibitors of ADP-induced aggregation (e.g. clopidogrel, ticlopidine), with PaT<br>
receptor antagonists (e.g. cangrelor) or with combined thromboxane receptor<br>
antagonists/synthetase inhibitors (e.g. terbogrel).<br>
The dosage required to achieve such an effect is appropriately 0.01 to 3 mg/kg,<br>
preferably 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg by intravenous route, and 0.03 to 30 mg/kg,<br>
preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg by oral route, in each case administered 1 to 4 times<br>
a day.<br>
For this purpose, the compounds of formula I prepared according to the<br>
invention may be formulated, optionally together with other active substances,<br>
with one or more inert conventional carriers and/or diluents, e.g. with corn<br>
starch, lactose, glucose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, citric acid, tartaric acid, water, water/ethanol,<br>
water/glycerol, water/sorbitol, water/polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol,<br>
cetylstearyl alcohol, carboxymethylcellulose or fatty substances such as hard fat<br>
or suitable mixtures thereof, to produce conventional galenic preparations such<br>
as plain or coated tablets, capsules, powders, suspensions or suppositories.<br>
The Examples which follow are intended to illustrate the invention without<br>
restricting its scope:<br>

obtained for the compounds prepared. Unless otherwise stated, Rf values were<br>
obtained using ready-made silica gel 60 £254 TLC plates (E. Merck, Darmstadt,<br>
Item no. 1.05714) without chamber saturation. The Rf values obtained under the<br>
name Alox were determined using ready-made aluminium oxide 60 £254 TLC<br>
plates (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Item no. 1.05713) without chamber saturation. The<br>
Rf values obtained under the name Reversed-phase-8 were determined using<br>
ready-made RP-8 Paws TLC plates (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Item no. 1.15684)<br>
without chamber saturation. The ratios given for the eluants refer to units by<br>
volume of the solvent in question. Chromatographic purification was done using<br>
silica gel supplied by Messrs Millipore (MATREX™, 35-70 urn). If the<br>
configuration is not specified in detail, it is unclear whether the compound in<br>
question is a pure stereoisomer or a mixture of enantiomer and diastereomer.<br>
