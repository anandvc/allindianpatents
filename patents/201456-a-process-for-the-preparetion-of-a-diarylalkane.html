				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of diarylalkanes, a class of aromatic compounds having proven industrial importance. The invention particularly relates to a catalytic process of preparing diarylalkanes in general, and benzyltoluene, in particular, from the reaction of ar.o.matic hydrocarbon. and an alcohol in the presence of a transition metal compound as catalyst, and tin (IV) chloride as co-catalyst, without using high dilution condition and avoiding unusually stringent process parameters which would be industrially viable and with possible high yield of the desired product.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diarylalkanes, for example benzylbenzene, benzyltoluene and related aromatic hydrocarbons are constituents of crude oils and have been shown to occur in crude oils from various source types and geological ages (Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds (1996), 9, 137-142). They are also of industrial interest due to their application as components of high-octane fuels for aircraft engines (Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data (1999), 44,  175).<br>
Diarylalkanes for example benzyltoluenes are essential ingredients of electrical insulating oils useful for high-voltage electrical devices (IEEE Trans. Elect, Insul. EI-21 Feb, 1986, 59). These oils have excellent low-temperature properties, and are particularly suited as impregnant for high voltage power capacitors (JP 01228924, Eur. Pat. Appl. (1988), EP 262456,_262454, 259798, JP 621.85907). By virtue of their improved pour point characteristics, increased stability and reduced oxidation rate, formulations containing diarylalkanes are used as dielectric coolant in electrical transformers (PCT Int. Appl. (1997), WO 9722572). Benzyltoluenes has been also used in formulating emulsions of termiticides, which show good penetration, and emulsion stability. For example, emulsions prepared by mixing Chlorpyrifos 40, benzyltoluene 55, water 150, and emulsifier 7 parts showed stability for greater than 1 month (JP 95-197975).<br>
Diarylalkanes of the type mentioned above has been prepared by several known methods that includes reaction of suitable aromatics with either formaldehyde, benzyl   chloride   or   benzyl   alcohol.   Due  to   serious   environmental   hazards<br><br>
2<br>
associated with formaldehyde or benzyl chloride, any processes based on these chemicals are no more industrially viable. Corrosion of reactor while using benzyl chloride is also noteworthy.<br>
In view of the above, several attempts have been made to synthesize diarylalkanes from suitable aromatics and benzyl alcohol in presence of a stoichiometric or catalytic reagent. These reagents are categorized as Bronsted acids, Lewis acids, solid acids, solid superacids, ion-exchange resins, ion-exchanged clays, heterogeneous transition metal oxides or phosphates. Each of the above processes are limited by one or more of the following factors: (a) high arene to alcohol ratio, (b) poor selectivity and by-product formation, (c) poor conversion, (d) use of very costly additives, (e) high catalyst loading, (f) high temperature of reaction, (g) unusually stringent process parameters. Thus, DE-PS 638.756 discloses the reaction of benzyl alcohol with benzene (molar ratio 1:2.77) at 230 degree C in an autoclave using 50% by weight of Tonsil as catalyst. The yield of the desired product diphenylmethane was about 40% of the theoretical yield and byproduct dibenzylbenzenes in about 25% yield. In DE 3836780, the yield is improved by using low catalyst concentration, very high arene:alcohol ratio, and by stringently metering the introduction of benzyl alcohol (under nitrogen flow of 100 L/h) and continuously redistilling water and alcohol. Processes based on metal halide catalysts such as aluminum trichloride, tellurium tetrachloride, and titanium tetrachloride suffer from very high catalyst loading (50 to 120 mol%), high arene:alcohol (nearly 30:1) ratio and the requirement to use reflux temperature (Kogyo Kagaku Zasshi 1967, 70, 2287-91, Kogyo Kagaku Zasshi 1968, 71, 229, Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan, 1986, 59, 3617-20; Nippon Kagaku Kaishi, 1981, 12, 1911-15). Silver perchlorate or silver triflate were used as additive to silicon tetrachloride or stannic chloride to lower the reaction temperature to below 50-degree C, however the silver salts are expensive and/or explosive [Chemistry Letters 1972, 6, 443-4, Tetrahedron Letters 2002, 43, 6391-6394], Scandium triflate (10 mol%) had been used as effective catalyst at 120 degree C at arene:alcohol ratio of 30-45:1 (Synlett, 1996, 557-559, J. Org. Chem., 1997, 62, 6997). Cation-exchanged K10-clay, Filtrol 24 and sulfated zirconia were used as heterogeneous catalysts under reflux condition in the reaction of benzyl alcohol with benzene or toluene (Applied<br><br>
3<br>
Catalysis A: 2001, 209, 229-235, Tetrahedron Letters, 1991, 32, 2903-2904, Tetrahedron Letters, 1991, 32, 1423-1424, Tetrahedron Letters, 1996, 37, 5405-5408). Low turnover frequency or poor conversion and by-product formation had been observed in certain cases. Mineral acid treated resins, and sofid perfluorinated resin sulfonic acids are capable of providing good yield of diarylalkanes at high arene:alcohol ratio (Reactive Polymers, 1995, 25, 55, J. Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 2089-2091). For example, benzyltoluene was obtained in 86 % yield after 2 h, using 10 wt% of Nafion-H, at toluene:benzyl alcohol ratio of 30:1 at 90-95 deg C (J, Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 2089-2091). Although phosphoric acid treated niobium oxide catalyst worked at arene:aicohoi ratio of 10:1, the yield of benzyl toluene was only 32%, along with 57% of dibenzylether after a reaction time of 9h (Catalysis today 1996, 28, 17-21, Applied Catalysis A: 1996, 138, L7-L12, Applied Catalysis A: 2003, 245, 377-382).<br>

It is further observed that reactions also proceed at room temperature in presence of varying amount of co-catalyst. Importantly, it was found that the selective combination effect of both the transition metal catalyst and tin halide co-<br><br>

catalyst in the transformation was essential as no reaction occurred in absence of either of the catalyst and co-catalyst under the same reaction condition.<br>

A solution containing toluene (4 ml, 37.6 mmol), bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)diiridium(l) dichloride (7 mg, 0.01 mmol) and anhydrous tin(IV) chloride (0.012 ml_, 0.1 mmol) was stirred for 15 minutes in a constant temperature bath at 90.0±0.1 degree C under an argon atmosphere. 4-Nitrobenzyl alcohol (0.306 gm, 2 mmol) was added to the above solution at 90 degree C. The reaction was continuously monitored by Gas Chromatographic Analyzer and showed complete conversion of the benzyl alcohol in 180 minutes. The product (4-nitrophenyl)-tolylmethane (0.236 gm, 52%, ortho:para = 38:62) was isolated from the reaction mixture by column chromatography (silica gel 100-200 mesh, petroleum ether eluent) after addition of 5 ml of 2% aqueous ammonium fluoride solution, extracting the organic layer with diethylether (5 times 20 ml), washing with water (3 times 10 ml) and brine (2 times 10 ml) and drying with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. 1H NMR (CDCl3). delta (ppm): 2.13 (s, ortho), 2.25 (s, para), 3.95 (s, para), 4.00 (s, ortho), 7.01-13 (m), 8.04 (d).<br>

As would be clearly apparent from the results in Table III, the above go to confirm the selective advantages in the combination of the catalyst and the co-catalyst in the process of the invention. In the absence of both the catalyst and the co-catalyst, the invention does not proceed as desired and it is only in the presence of both the catalyst and the co-catalyst that the process leads to significantly higher yield in the given operating conditions.<br>
