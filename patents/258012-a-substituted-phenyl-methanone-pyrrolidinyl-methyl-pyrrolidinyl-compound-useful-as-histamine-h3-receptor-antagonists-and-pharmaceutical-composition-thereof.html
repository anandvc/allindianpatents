FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted phenyl-methanone-pyrrolidinyl-<br>
methyl-pyrrolidinyl compounds, and to the use of these compounds as pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, to methods of<br>
treatment employing these compounds and compositions, and to intermediates and<br>
methods for making these compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The histamine H3 receptor is relatively neuron specific and inhibits the release of<br>
a number of monoamines, including histamine. The histamine H3 receptor is a<br>
presynaptic autoreceptor and hetero-receptor located both in the central and the peripheral<br>
nervous system. The histamine H3 receptor regulates the release of histamine and other<br>
neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and acetylcholine. These are examples of histamine<br>
H3 receptor mediated responses. Recent evidence suggests that the H3 receptor shows<br>
intrinsic, constitutive activity, in vitro as well as in vivo (i.e. it is active in the absence of<br>
an agonist). Compounds acting as inverse agonists can inhibit this activity. A histamine<br>
H3 receptor antagonist or inverse agonist would therefore be expected to increase the<br>
release of H3 receptor-regulated neurotransmitters in the brain. A histamine H3 receptor<br>
agonist, on the contrary, leads to an inhibition of the biosynthesis of histamine and an<br>
inhibition of the release of histamine and also of other neurotransmitters such as serotonin<br>
and acetylcholine. These findings suggest that histamine H3 receptor agonists, inverse<br>
agonists, and antagonists could be important mediators of neuronal activity, and the<br>
activities of other cells that may express this receptor. Inverse agonism or selective<br>
antagonism of the histamine H3 receptor raises brain levels of histamine, and other<br>
monoamines, and inhibits activities such, as food consumption while minimizing non-<br>
specific peripheral consequences. By this mechanism, they induce a prolonged<br>
wakefulness, improved cognitive function, reduction in food intake and normalization of<br>
vestibular reflexes. Accordingly, the histamine H3 receptor is an important target for new<br>
therapeutics in Alzheimer disease, mood and attention adjustments, cognitive<br>
deficiencies, obesity, dizziness, schizophrenia, epilepsy, sleeping disorders, narcolepsy<br>
and motion sickness.<br><br>
Histamine mediates its activity via four receptor subtypes, H1R, H2R, H3R and a<br>
newly identified receptor designated GPRv53 [(Oda T., et al, J.BioI.Chem. 225 (47):<br>
36781-6 (2000)], and alternative names for this receptor are PORT3 or H4R. Although<br>
relatively selective ligands have been developed for H1R, H2R and H3R, few specific<br>
ligands have been developed that can distinguish H3R from GPRv53. GPRv53 is a<br>
widely distributed receptor found at high levels in human leukocytes. Activation or<br>
inhibition of this receptor could result in undesirable side effects when targeting<br>
antagonismof the H3R receptor. The identification of the H4R receptor has<br>
fundamentally changed histamine biology and must be considered in the development of<br>
histamine H3 receptor antagonists.<br>
Some histamine H3 receptor antagonists were created which resembled histamine<br>
in possessing an imidazole ring generally substituted in the 4(5) position (Ganellin et alâ€ž<br>
Ars Pharmaceutica, 1995,36:3,455-468). A variety of patents and patent applications<br>
directed to antagonists and agonists having such structures include EP 197840, EP<br>
494010, WO 97/29092, WO 96/38141, and W096/38142. These imidazole-containing<br>
compounds have the disadvantage of poor blood-brain barrier penetration, interaction<br>
with cytochrome P-450 proteins, and hepatic and ocular toxicities. Recently other<br>
imidazole and non-imidazole ligands of the histamine H3 receptor have been described,<br>
such as those in WO2002076925. The compounds of the present invention differ in<br>
structure from the compounds described in the art.<br>
There remains a need for improved treatments using alternative or improved<br>
pharmaceutical agents that act as histamine H3 receptor agonists, inverse agonists, or<br>
antagonists,.to modulate H3 receptor activity, and treat the diseases that could benefit<br>
from H3 receptor modulation. The present invention provides such a contribution to the<br>
art based on the finding that a novel class of substituted phenyl-methanone-pyrrolidinyl-<br>
methyl-pyrrolidinyl compounds has a high affinity, selective, and potent activity at the<br>
histamine H3 receptor. The subject invention is distinct in the particular structures and<br>
their activities.<br><br>

The invention includes tautomers, enantiomers and other stereoisomers of the<br>
compounds also. Thus, as one skilled in the art knows, certain aryls may exist in<br>
tautomeric forms. Such variations are contemplated to be within the scope of the<br>
invention. It will be understood mat, as used herein, references to the compounds of<br>
Formula I or Formula II are meant to also include the pharmaceutical salts, its<br>
enantiomers and racemic mixtures thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "stereoisomer" refers to a compound made up of the<br>
same atoms bonded by the same bonds but having different three-dimensional structures<br>
which are not interchangeable. The three-dimensional structures are called<br>
configurations. As used herein, the term "enantiomer" refers to two stereoisomers whose<br>
molecules are nonsuperimposable mirror images of one another. The term "chiral center"<br>
refers to a carbon atom to which four different groups are attached. As used herein, the<br>
term "diastereomers" refers to stereoisomers which are not enantiomers. In addition, two<br>
diastereomers which have a different configuration at only one chiral center are referred<br>
to herein as "epimers." The terms "racemate," "racemic mixture" or "racemic<br>
modification" refer to a mixture of equal parts of enantiomers.<br>
The term "enantiomeric enrichment" as used herein refers to the increase in the<br>
amount of one enantiomer as compared to the other. A convenient method of expressing<br>
the enantiomeric enrichment achieved is the concept of enantiomeric excess, or "ee,"<br>
which is found using the following equation:<br><br>
wherein E1 is the amount of the first enantiomer and E2 is the amount of the second<br>
enantiomer. Thus, if the initial ratio of the two enantiomers is 50:50, such as is present in<br>
a racemic mixture, and an enantiomeric enrichment sufficient to produce a final ratio of<br>
70:30 is achieved, the ee with respect to the first enantiomer is 40%. However, if the<br>
final ratio is 90:10, the ee with respect to the first enantiomer is 80%. An ee of greater<br>
than 90% is preferred, an ee of greater than 95% is most preferred and an ee of greater<br>
than 99% is most especially preferred. Enantiomeric enrichment is readily determined by<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art using standard techniques and procedures, such as gas or<br>
high performance liquid chromatography with a chiral column. Choice of the appropriate<br>
chiral column, eluent and conditions necessary to effect separation of the enantiomeric<br><br>
pair is well within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. In addition, the<br>
specific stereoisomers and enantiomers of compounds of Formula I or Formula II can be<br>
prepared by one of ordinary skill in the sirt utilizing well known techniques and processes,<br>
such as those disclosed by J. Jacques, etal., "Enantiomers, Racemates. and Resolutions."<br>
John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1981, and E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen," Stereochemistry of<br>
Organic Compounds." (Wiley-Interscience 1994), and European Patent Application No.<br>
EP-A-838448, published April 29,1998. Examples of resolutions include<br>
recrystallization techniques or chiral chromatography.<br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention have one or more chiral centers<br>
and may exist in a variety of stereoisomeric configurations. As a consequence of these<br>
chiral centers, the compounds of the present invention occur as racemates, mixtures of<br>
enantiomers and as individual enantiomers, as well as diastereomers and mixtures of<br>
diastereomers. All such racemates, enantiomers, and diastereomers are within the scope<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The terms "R" and "S" are used herein as commonly used in organic chemistry to<br>
denote specific configuration of a chiral center. The term "R" (rectus) refers to that<br>
configuration of a chiral center with a clockwise relationship of group priorities (highest<br>
to second lowest) when viewed along the bond toward the lowest priority group. The<br>
term "S" (sinister) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a counterclockwise<br>
relationship of group priorities (highest: to second lowest) when viewed along the bond<br>
toward the lowest priority group. The priority of groups is based upon their atomic<br>
"number(hrorderof decreasing atomic number).- Apartial listof priorities anda -<br>
discussion of stereochemistry is contained in "Nomenclature of Organic Compounds:<br>
Principles and Practice", (J.H. Fletcher, et al., eds., 1974) at pages 103-120.<br>
The designation" """â– "â–  " refers; to a bond that protrudes forward out of the plane<br>
of the page. The designation" ""'" " refers to a bond that protrudes backward out of the<br>
plane of the page. The designation" ""^ " refers to a bond wherein the stereochemistry<br>
is not defined.<br>
In general, the term "pharmaceutical" when used as an adjective means<br>
substantially non-toxic to living organisms. For example, the term "pharmaceutical salt"<br>
as used herein, refers to salts of the compounds of Formula I or Formula II which are<br>
substantially non-toxic to living organisms. See, e.g., Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D., and<br><br>
Monkhouse, D.C., "Pharmaceutical Salts," /. Phann. Sci., 66:1,1977. Typical<br>
pharmaceutical salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of<br>
Formula I or Formula II with an inorganic or organic acid or base. Such salts are known<br>
as acid addition or base addition salts respectively. These pharmaceutical salts frequently<br>
have enhanced solubility characteristics compared to the compound from which they are<br>
derived, and thus are often more amenable to formulation as liquids or emulsions. .<br>
The term "acid addition salt" refers to a salt of a compound of Formula I or<br>
Formula Ilprepared by reaction of a compound of Formula I or Formula II with a mineral<br>
or organic acid. For exemplification of pharmaceutical acid addition salts see, e.g.,<br>
Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D., and Monkhouse, D.C., I Pharm. Sci., 66:1,1977. Since<br>
compounds of this invention can be basic in nature, they accordingly react with any of a<br>
number of inorganic and organic acids to form pharmaceutical acid addition salts.<br>
The pharmaceutical acid addition salts of the invention are typically formed by<br>
reacting the compound of Formula I or Formula n with an equimolar or excess amount of<br>
acid. The reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethylether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, benzene, and the like. The salts<br>
normally precipitate out of solution within about one hour to about ten days and can be<br>
isolated by filtration or other conventional methods.<br>
Acids commonly employed to form acid addition salts are inorganic acids such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and<br>
the like, and acids commonly employed to form such salts are inorganic acids such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and<br>
the like, and organic acids, such as/Moluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic<br>
acid, p-bromophenylsulfonic acid, cjirbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid,<br>
acetic acid and the like. Examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus are the<br>
sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate,<br>
dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate,<br>
propionate, decanoate, caprylate, aaylate, formate, isobutyrate, caproate, heptanoate,<br>
propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate,<br>
butyne-l,4-dioate, hexyne-l,6-dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate,<br>
dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, sulfonate,<br>
xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate,<br><br>
P-hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, tartrate, rnethanesulfonate, propanesulfonate,<br>
naphthalene-l.-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, mandelate and the like.<br>
The term "base addition salt" refers to a salt of a compound of Formula I or<br>
Formula II prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula I or Formula II with a mineral<br>
or organic base. For exemplification of pharmaceutical base addition salts see, e.g.,<br>
Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D., and Monkhouse, D.C., J. Pharnu Sci., 66:1,1977. The<br>
present invention also contemplates phJirmaceutical base addition salts of compounds of<br>
Formula I or Formula II. The skilled artisan would appreciate that some compounds of<br>
Formula I or Formula II may be acidic in nature and accordingly react with any of a<br>
number of inorganic and organic bases to form pharmaceutical base addition salts.<br>
Examples-of pharmaceutical base addition salts are the ammonium, lithium, potassium,<br>
sodium, calcium, magnesium, methylamino, diethylamino, ethylene diamino,<br>
cyclohexylamino, and ethanolamino salts, and the like of a compound of Formula I or<br>
Formula II.<br>
The compounds of Formula I or Formula II, when existing as a diastereomeric<br>
mixture, may be separated into diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example,<br>
fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent, for example methanol or ethyl acetate or<br>
a mixture thereof. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into<br>
individual stereoisomers by conventional means, for example by the use of an optically<br>
active acid as a resolving agent. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound of<br>
Formula I or Formula II may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure<br>
"Starting materials'or reagents of known configuration or through-enantioselective<br>
synthesis.<br>
The compounds of Formula I or Formula II can be prepared by one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art following a variety of procedures, some of which are illustrated in the<br>
procedures and schemes set forth below. The particular order of steps required to produce<br>
the compounds of Formula I or Formula II is dependent upon the particular compound to<br>
being synthesized, the starting compound, and the relative liability of the substituted<br>
moieties. The reagents or starting materials are readily identifiable to and available to one<br>
of skill in the art, and to the extent not commercially available, are readily synthesized by<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art following standard procedures commonly employed in the<br>
art, along with the various procedures and schemes set forth below.<br><br>
The following Preparations and Examples are provided to better elucidate the<br>
practice of the present invention and should not be interpreted in any way as to limit the<br>
scope of the same. Those skilled in the art will recognize that various modifications may<br>
be made while not departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. All publications<br>
mentioned in the specification are indicative of the level of those skilled in the art to<br>

In Scheme A, R, and Ra&gt; are each independently but not limited to F, CI, CF3,<br>
alkyl and can include disubstituted compounds; Rb is H, or the corresponding carboxylic<br>
acids salts; RÂ« and Rc- are each independently but not limited to alkyl, hydroxy, and Rd is<br>
an alkyl, branched alkyl group or cycloalkyl group which substituted with other<br>
functional groups not limited to sulfones, trifluoromethyl, halo, methoxy, ester, acid etc.<br>
In Scheme A, Step 1 aryl carboxylic acids or the lithium, sodium or potassium salt of the<br>
acid where Rb can be H, Li, Na or K aire converted to the corresponding amides using a<br>
number of different methods known in the literature. Some of these methods can be found<br>
described in a review of coupling reagents in peptide synthesis by Klausner &amp; Bodansky,<br>
Synthesis, 1972,9,453-463.<br>
For example, 4-hydroxybenzolc acid or the corresponding lithium or sodium salt<br>
is suspended a suitable organic solvent such as dichloromethane, DMF or mixtures<br>
thereof. A suitable amide coupling agent i.e. EDC, DCC, TBTU, etc., is added followed<br>
by HOBt, HATU, etc., at room temperature. Diisopropylethyl amine and suitable amine<br>
in this case, (S)(+)-l-(2-pyrrolidinylmethyl)pyrrolidine are added to the mixture. The<br>
mixture is stirred at room temperature for a period of 8-48 hours. The reaction is<br>
quenched by addition of water. The resulting mixture may be extracted, concentrated and<br>
purified according to techniques well known in the art.<br>
Alternatively the corresponding acid chloride can be formed from the<br>
corresponding acid or salt thereof using thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride and a few<br>
drops DMF, and treated with a suitable amine to give the desired amide.<br><br>

Further embodiments of the invention include the compounds of formulae XI to<br>
X52 in Table 1 below. A further embodiment of the invention are any novel intermediate<br>
preparations described herein which are useful for preparing the histamine H3 receptor<br>
antagonists or inverse agonists of formula I, or II, or XI to X52.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The pharmaceutical salts of the invention are typically formed by reacting a<br>
compound of Formula I or Formula II with an equimolar or excess amount of acid or<br>
base. The reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethylether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, benzene, and the like for acid addition<br>
salts, or water, an alcohol or a chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane for base<br>
addition salts. The salts normally precipitate out of solution within about one hour to<br>
about ten days and can be isolated by filtration or other conventional methods.<br>
Acids commonly employed to form pharmaceutical acid addition salts are<br>
inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric<br>
acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, and organic acids such asp-toluenesulfonic,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, p-bromophenylsulfonic acid,<br><br>
carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid, and the<br>
like. Preferred pharmaceutical acid addition salts are those formed with mineral acids<br>
such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, and sulfuric acid, and those formed with<br>
organic acids such as maleic acid, tartaric acid, and methanesulfonic acid.<br>
Bases commonly employed to form pharmaceutical base addition salts are<br>
inorganic bases, such as ammonium or alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides,<br>
carbonates, bicarbonates, and the like. Such bases useful in preparing the salts of this<br>
invention thus include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide,<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate,<br>
calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and the like. The potassium and sodium salt<br>
forms are particularly preferred.<br>
The optimal time for performing the reactions of the Schemes, Preparations, and<br>
Procedures can be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction via conventional<br>
chromatographic techniques. Furthermore, it is preferred to conduct the reactions of the<br>
invention under an inert atmosphere, such as, for example, argon, or, particularly,<br>
nitrogen. Choice of solvent is generally not critical so long as the solvent employed is<br>
inert to the ongoing reaction and sufficiently solubilizes the reactants to effect the desired<br>
reaction. The compounds are preferably isolated and purified before their use in<br>
subsequent reactions. Some compounds may crystallize out of the reaction solution<br>
during their formation and then collected by filtration, or the reaction solvent may be<br>
removed by extraction, evaporation, or decantation. The intermediates and final products<br>
~of"Formula" Vox Formula"II may"b"e"fuirtherpu"rified,"if desired bylSofnmbn techniques such<br>
as recrystallization or chromatography over solid supports such as silica gel or alumina.<br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that not all substituents are compatible with all<br>
reaction conditions. These compounds may be protected or modified at a convenient point<br>
in the synthesis by methods well known in the art.<br>
The compound of Formula I or Formula D is preferably formulated in a unit<br>
dosage form prior to administration. Therefore, yet another embodiment of the present<br>
invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I or<br>
Formula II and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients.<br>
The present pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by known procedures<br>
using well-known and readily available ingredients. In making the formulations of the<br><br>
present invention, the active ingredient (Formula I or Formula II compound) will usually<br>
be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be<br>
in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the carrier serves as a<br>
diluent, it may be a solid, semisolid or liquid material that acts as a vehicle, excipient, or<br>
medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets,<br>
pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions,<br>
syrups, aerosol (as a solid or in a liquid medium), soft and hard gelatin capsules,<br>
suppositories, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders.<br>
Some examples of suitable carriers, excipients, and diluents include lactose,<br>
dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates,<br>
tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
cellulose, water syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl and propylhydroxybenzoates, talc,<br>
magnesium stearate and mineral oil. The formulations can additionally include<br>
lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents,<br>
sweetening agents or flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention may be<br>
formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient<br>
after administration to the patient.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be formulated in sustained release<br>
form to provide the rate controlled release of any one or more of the components or active<br>
ingredients to optimize the therapeutic effects, i.e., antihistamine activity and the like.<br>
Suitable dosage forms for sustained release include layered tablets containing layers of<br>
varying disintegration rates or controlled release polymeric matrices impregnated with the<br>
active components and shaped in tablet form or capsules containing such impregnated or<br>
encapsulated porous polymeric matrices.<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an<br>
example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral<br>
injections or addition of sweeteners and opacifiers for oral solutions, suspensions and<br>
emulsions. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal<br>
administration.<br><br>
Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in<br>
powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier<br>
such as inert compressed gas, e.g. nitrogen.<br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid<br>
glycerides such as cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed<br>
homogeneously therein by stirring or similar mixing. The molten homogeneous mixture<br>
is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby solidify.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted,<br>
shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration,<br>
Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The<br>
transdermal compositions may take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or<br>
emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as a<br>
re conventional in the art for this purpose.<br>
Preferably the compound is administered orally.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in a unit dosage form. In such form,<br>
the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate<br>
quantities of the active components, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired<br>
purpose.<br>
The quantity of the inventive active composition in a unit dose of preparation may<br>
be generally varied or adjusted from about 0.01 milligrams to about 1,000 milligrams,<br>
preferably from about 0.01 to about 950 milligrams, more preferably from about 0.01 to<br>
about 500 milligrams, and typically from about 1 to about 250 milligrams, according to<br>
the particular application. The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon<br>
the patient's age, sex, weight and severity of the condition being treated. Such techniques<br>
are well known to those skilled in trie art. Generally, the human oral dosage form<br>
containing the active ingredients can be administered 1 or 2 times per day.<br>
Compounds of Formula I or Formula II are effective as antagonists or inverse<br>
agonists of the histamine H3 receptor, and thus inhibit the activity of the H3 receptor.<br>
More particularly, these compound!} are selective antagonists or inverse agonists of the<br><br>
histamine H3 receptor. As selective antagonists or inverse agonists, the compounds of<br>
Formula I or Formula II are useful in the treatment of diseases, disorders, or conditions<br>
responsive to the inactivation of the histamine H3 receptor, including but not limited to<br>
obesity and other eating-related disorders, and cognitive disorders. It is postulated that<br>
selective antagonists or inverse agonists of H3R will raise brain histamine levels and<br>
possibly that of other monoamines resulting in inhibition of food consumption while<br>
minimizing peripheral consequences. Although a number of H3R antagonists are known<br>
in the art, none have proven to be satisfactory obesity or cognitive drugs. There is<br>
increasing evidence that histamine pUiys an important role in energy homeostasis.<br>
Histamine is an almost ubiquitous amine found in many cell types and it binds to a family<br>
of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This family provides a mechanism by which<br>
histamine can elicit distinct cellular responses based on receptor distribution. Both the<br>
H1R and H2R are widely distributed. H3R is primarily expressed in the brain, notably in<br>
the thalamus and caudate nucleus. Hugh density of expression of H3R was found in<br>
feeding center of the brain. A novel histamine receptor GPRv53 has been recently<br>
identified. GPRv53 is found in high levels in peripheral white blood cells; only low<br>
levels have been identified in the brain by some investigators while others cannot detect it<br>
in the brain. However, any drug discovery effort initiated around H3R must consider<br>
GPRv53 as well as the other subtypes.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can readily be evaluated by using a<br>
competitive inhibition Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) based on a H3R binding assay<br>
using [3H] a methylhistamine as ligand. Stable cell lines, including but not limited to<br>
HEK can be transfected with cDNA coding for H3R to prepare membranes used for the<br>
binding assay. The technique is illustrated below (Preparation of Histamine Receptor<br>
Subtype Membranes') for the histamine receptor subtypes.<br>
Membranes isolated as described in (Preparation of Histamine Receptor Subtype<br>
Membranes') are used in a [35S]GTP^S functional assay. Binding of [35S]GTPxS to<br>
membranes indicates agonist activity. Compounds of the invention of Formula I or<br>
Formula II are tested for their ability to inhibit binding in the presence of agonists.<br>
Alternately, the same transfected cell lines are used for a cAMP assay wherein H3R<br>
agonists inhibit forskolin-activated synthesis of cAMP. Compounds of Formula I or<br><br>
Formula II are tested for their ability to permit forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis in<br>
the presence of agonist.<br>
Preparation of Histamine Receptor Subtype Membranes<br>
A. Preparation H1R membranes<br>
cDNA for the human histamine 1 receptor (H1R) is cloned into a mammalian<br>
expression vector containing the CMV promoter (pcDNA3.1(+), Invitogen) and<br>
transfected into HEK293 cells using the FuGENE Transfection Reagent (Roche<br>
Diagnostics Corporation). Transfected cells are selected using G418 (500 n/ml).<br>
Colonies that survived selection are grown and tested for histamine binding to cells<br>
grown in 96-well dishes using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) based radioligand<br>
binding assay. Briefly, cells, representing individual selected clones, are grown as<br>
confluent monolayers in 96-well dishes (Costar Clear Bottom Plates, #3632) by seeding<br>
wells with 25,000 cells and growing for 48 hours (37Â°C, 5% CO2). Growth media is<br>
removed and wells are rinsed two times with PBS (minus Ca2+ or Mg2+). For total<br>
binding, cells are assayed in a SPA reaction containing 50mM Tris-HCL (assay buffer),<br>
