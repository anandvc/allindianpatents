CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The application claims the benefit of US Provisional Application No.60/755,001<br>
filed on December 29, 2005. The disclosure of the above application is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure relates to engine control systems, and more particularly<br>
to an engine control system that determines a fuel efficiency of an internal<br>
combustion based on a power loss of the engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Vehicles include an internal combustion engine that generates drive torque. More<br>
Particularly, the engine draws in air and mixes the air with fuel to form a<br>
combustion mixture. The combustion mixture is compressed within cylinders and<br>
is combusted to drive pistons that are disposed within the cylinders. The pistons<br>
drive a crankshaft that transfers drive torque to a transmission and a drivetrain.<br>
Vehicle manufacturers typically use a dynamometer to evaluate vehicle<br>
performance. For example, a dynamometer may determine optimal engine<br>
torque output for a range of engine speeds. However, actual torque output may<br>
be different than the optimal torque output generated by the vehicle in<br>
controlled conditions. More specifically, the actual torque output may be affected<br>
by external conditions including, but not limited to air temperature himidity<br>
and/or barometric pressure.<br><br>
The document D1 discloses: A preferred input torque for a hybrid power train is<br>
determined within a solution space of feasible input torques in accordance with a<br>
plurality of powertrain system constraints that results in a minimum overall<br>
powertrain system loss. System power losses and battery utilization costs system<br>
loss is converged upon to determine the preferred input torque.<br>
The document D2 discloses:. A two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission utilizes an input member for receiving power from an engine, and<br>
an output member for delivering power from the transmission. First and second<br>
motor/generators are operatively connected to an energy storage device through<br>
a control for interchanging electrical power among the storage device, the first<br>
motor/generator and the second motor/generator. The transmission employs<br>
three planetary gear sets. Each planetary gear arrangement utilizes first, second<br>
and third gear members. At least one of the gear members in the first or second<br>
planetary gear sets is connected to the first motor/generator. One of the gear<br>
members of the first or second planetary gear sets is continuously connected to<br>
one of the gear members in the third planetary gear set. Another gear member<br>
of the first or second planetary gear set is operatively connected to the input<br>
member, and one gear member of the third planetary gear set is selectively<br>
connected to ground. A lock-up clutch selectively locks two of the planetary gear<br>
sets in a 1:1 ratio.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure provides a fuel efficiency estimation system for<br>
determining a fuel efficiency of an internal combustion engine. The system<br>
includes a first module that determines a final air intake value and a second<br>
module that determines a fuel mass rate value based on the final air intake<br>
value. A third module determines the power loss for the internal combustion<br>
engine based on the fuel mass rate value. A fuel efficiency of the engine is<br>
determined based on the power loss.<br>
In other features, the first module includes a first sub-module that generates an<br>
initial air intake value based on at least one of an engine speed value, an engine<br>
torque value and an engine coolant temperature value. The first module further<br>
includes a second sub-module that outputs a current iterative air intake value<br>
based on at least one of the engine speed value, the engine torque value and<br>
the coolant temperature value.<br>
In other features, the first module further includes a third sub-module that<br>
determines a spark advance value, a fourth sub-module that determines an<br>
intake and exhaust cam phaser position value and a fifth sub-module that<br>
determines an air/fuel ratio. The spark advance value, the intake and exhaust<br>
cam phaser positions values and the air/fuel ratio are calculated based on the<br>
current iterative air intake value, the engine speed value and the coolant<br>
temperature value.<br>
In still other features, the second sub-module calculates the current iterative air<br>
intake value based on the spark advance value, the intake and exhaust cam<br>
phaser position values and the air/fuel ratio value.<br><br>
In yet other features, the second sub-module determines a difference between<br>
the current iterative air intake value and a prior iterative air intake value. The<br>
second sub-module outputs a final iterative air intake value when the difference<br>
is less than a predetermined threshold value. The second sub-module updates<br>
the iterative air intake value when the difference is greater than the<br>
predetermined threshold value.<br>
Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided<br>
herein. It should be under. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way<br>
intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. As used herein, the term<br>
module or device refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an<br>
electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that<br>
executes one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic<br>
circuit and/or other suitable components that provides the described<br>
functionality.<br>
According to the present disclosure, a fuel efficiency of an engine is calculated<br>
as a function of a power loss of the engine, which is based on the difference<br>
between an optimal power output value and an estimated power output value.<br>
More specifically, the estimated power is calculated during a stable or steady<br>
state engine condition based on current engine speed, engine torque and coolant<br>
temperature values.<br>
Referring now to figure 1, an engine system 10 includes an engine 12 that-<br>
combusts an air/fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air is drawn into an intake<br>
manifold 14 through a throttle 16. The throttle 16 regulates air flow into the<br>
intake manifold 14. The air is mixed with fuel and is combusted within<br><br>
cylinders 18 to produce drive torque Although four cylinders are illustrated, it<br>
can be appreciated that the engine 12 may include additional or fewer cylinders<br>
18 For example, engines having 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 cylinders are<br>
contemplated	<br>
[0019] A fuel injector (not shown) injects fuel that is combined with air<br>
to form an air/fuel mixture that is combusted within the cylinder 18 A fuel<br>
injection system 20 regulates the fuel injector to provide a desired air-to-fuel ratio<br>
within each cylinder 18 An intake valve 22 selectively opens and closes to<br>
enable the air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder 18 The position of the intake<br>
valve is regulated by an intake cam shaft 24 A piston (not shown) compresses<br>
the air/fuel mixture within the cylinder 18 After the combustion event, an<br>
exhaust valve 28 selectively opens and closes to enable the exhaust gases to<br>
exit the cylinder 18 The position of the exhaust valve is regulated by an exhaust<br>
cam shaft 30 The piston drives a crankshaft (not shown) to produce drive<br>
torque The crankshaft rotatably drives camshafts 24,30 using a timing chain<br>
(not shown) to regulate the timing of intake and exhaust valves 22, 28 Although<br>
dual camshafts are shown, a single camshaft may be used<br>
[0020] The engine 12 may include an intake cam phaser 32 and/or an<br>
exhaust cam phaser 34 that respectively regulate rotational timing of the intake<br>
and exhaust cam shafts 24, 30 relative to a rotational position of the crankshaft<br>
More specifically, a phase angle of the intake and exhaust cam phasers 32, 34<br>
may be retarded or advanced to regulate the rotational timing of the intake and<br>
exhaust cam shafts 24, 30<br><br>
[0021] A coolant temperature sensor 36 is responsive to the<br>
temperature of a coolant circulating through the engine 12 and generates a<br>
coolant temperature signal 37 A barometric pressure sensor 38 is responsive<br>
to atmospheric pressure and generates a barometric pressure signal 39 An<br>
engine speed sensor 42 is responsive to the engine speed and outputs an<br>
engine speed signal 43 A temperature sensor 44 is responsive to ambient<br>
temperature and outputs a temperature signal 45 An oil temperature sensor 46<br>
is responsive to oil temperature and outputs an oil temperature signal 47 A<br>
control module 49 regulates operation of the engine system 10 based on the<br>
various sensor signals The engine control module 49 selectively calculates a<br>
power loss of the engine system 10 and determines a fuel efficiency of the<br>
engine based thereon<br>
[0022] Referring now to FIG 2, an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
control module 49 uses an engine torque value (TORQ), an engine speed value<br>
(RPM), a coolant temperature value (COOL), a barometric pressure value<br>
(BARO), an oil temperature value (OT) and an ambient temperature value<br>
(AMBT) as inputs to calculate power loss More specifically, the TORQ, RPM,<br>
COOL, BARO, OT, and AMBT values may be current values determined based<br>
on, but not limited to, the signals from the sensors 36, 38, 42, 44, 46 In an<br>
alternate configuration, the TORQ, RPM, COOL BARO, OT and AMBT may be<br>
values determined by the control module 49 to calculate a theoretical power loss<br>
[0023] The control module 49 includes an air intake calculation module<br>
50, a fuel mass rate calculation module 52 and a power loss calculation module<br><br>
54 The air intake calculation module 50 determines a final mass of air-per-<br>
cyhnder (APCF) and/or a final mass air flow rate (MAFF) More specifically, APCF<br>
and MAFF are based on the same inputs TORQ, RPM, COOL, BARO, OT and<br>
AMBT The relationship between APCF and MAFF is shown in the following<br>
equation<br><br>
where N, is the number of cylinders 18 of the engine 12 and kCOnv is a constant<br>
determined based on a unit conversion For ease of discussion, APCF is used in<br>
context to further illustrate the present disclosure<br>
[0024] The fuel mass rate calculation module 52 determines a fuel<br>
mass rate (Mf) based on APCF, RPM, and AF|T More specifically, the Mf may be<br>
based on the following equation<br><br>
The constant k is a predetermined value that may vary according to different<br>
engine systems AFrr is a calculated air fuel ratio that is discussed in further<br>
detail below<br>
[0025] The power loss calculation module 54 determines a power loss<br>
value (PL) based on Mf, RPM, and TORQ More specifically, the PL may be<br>
based on the following equation<br><br>
TORQ0pt, RPMopt and Mopt are the optimal engine torque, optimal engine speed,<br>
and optimal fuel mass flow rate values, respectively, and can be selected to<br><br>
represent one operating point for the engine at one reference coolant<br>
temperature and one reference barometric pressure Alternatively, the values of<br>
TORQopt, RPM0pi arid Mopt can be determined from pre-stored look-up tables<br>
based on the current coolant temperature (COOL) and current barometric<br>
pressure (BARO) The power loss can also be evaluated using different TORQopt<br>
and Mopt for each RPM More specifically, RPMopt set equal to RPM and the<br>
values TORQopt and Mopt are determined from a pre-stored look-up based on<br>
RPM<br>
[0026] Various embodiments of the control module 49 may include any<br>
number of modules The modules shown in FIG 2 may be combined and/or<br>
partitioned further without departing from the present disclosure<br>
[0027] Referring now to FIG 3, an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
calculation module 50 including an initial calculation APC sub-module 56, an<br>
iterative APC calculation sub-module 58, a spark advance calculation sub-<br>
module 60, a cam phaser position calculation sub-module 62 and an air/fuel ratio<br>
calculation sub-module 64 The initial APC calculation sub-module 56 outputs an<br>
initial APC (APC|N) based on TORQ, RPM, COOL, BARO, OT, and AMBT For<br>
example, APC|N may be based on the following inverse model torque equation<br><br>
SIN, IIN, EIN, and AF!N are initial values for spark advance, intake cam phaser<br>
position, exhaust cam phaser position and air/fuel ratio, respectively The S|N, l|N,<br>
E|N, and AF,N maybe predetermined lookup table values that are accessed as a<br>
function of TORQ, RPM, COOL, BARO, OT and AMBT<br><br>
[0028] The iterative APC calculation sub-module 58 determines an<br>
iterative APC (APC|T) until the engine is stable and then outputs APCF to the fuel<br>
mass rate calculation module 52 More specifically, APCrr may be based on the<br>
following inverse model torque equation<br><br>
TORQ, RPM, COOL, OT, BARO, and AMBT are the current values as provided<br>
by the respective sensors S|T, I IT, Err, and AF|T are iterative values for spark<br>
advance, intake cam phaser position, exhaust cam phaser position, and air/fuel<br>
ratio, respectively The iterative APC calculation sub-module 58 outputs APCF<br>
when the engine is stable More specifically, engine stability is determined when<br>
a difference between a prior APCrr and the current APCrr is less than a<br>
predetermined value The APCF IS set equal to the current APCrr The spark<br>
advance calculation sub-module 60 outputs Sif based on the current APCIT, RPM<br>
and COOL The cam phaser position calculation sub-module 62 outputs I IT and<br>
Err .based on the current APCIT, RPM and COOL The AF ratio calculation sub-<br>
module 64 outputs AFIT based on the APC,T, RPM, and COOL<br>
[0029] Various embodiments of the calculation module 50 may include<br>
any number of sub-modules The sub-modules shown in FIG 3 may be<br>
combined and/or partitioned further without departing from the present<br>
disclosure<br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG 4, exemplary steps that are executed to<br>
calculate power loss will be described in detail In step 220, control determines<br>
APCIN In step 230, control determines a current APCrr (APC|T(i), where i is a<br><br>
time step) based on APC|N or a prior iterative APC (APCrr(i-l)) More specifically,<br>
the first iterative APC calculation is based on APCiN and subsequent iterative<br>
APC calculations are based on APC|T(i-1)<br>
[0031] In step 240, control determines a difference (DIFF) between<br>
APCIT(I) and APCIT(I-1) In step 250, control determines whether DIFF is less<br>
than a predetermined threshold value (THR) If DIFF is greater than THR, the<br>
iterative solution is deemed to be at an intermediate state and control loops back<br>
to'step 230 If DIFF is less than THR, the iterative solution is considered<br>
complete and control proceeds to output APCF in step 255 More specifically,<br>
APCF IS set equal to or otherwise provided as APC|T(i) In step 260, control<br>
calculates Mf based on APCF, AF|T and RPM values In step 270, control<br>
calculates a power loss (PL) value based on Mf, TORQ and RPM values and<br>
control ends Control can subsequently determine an instantaneous fuel<br>
efficiency of the engine based on PL<br>
[0032] It is also anticipated that the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented using an engine mass air flow (MAF), as opposed to APC In this<br>
case, APC is substituted for using the determined MAF<br>
[0033] It is further anticipated that the present disclosure can be<br>
modified for implementation with diesel engine systems For example, in the<br>
case of a diesel engine system, APC is not determined Instead, an engine<br>
torque model is provided, which is primarily based on a fuel mass flow rate The<br>
inverse torque model, in this case, provides an estimate of the required fuel mass<br>
flow rate<br><br>
[0034] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, specification,<br>

The invention relates to a fuel efficiency estimation system for determining a fuel<br>
efficiency of an internal combustion engine (12) comprising a first module (50)<br>
that determines a current iterative intake air mass value provided to said engine<br>
(12) and compares said current iterative intake air mass value to a previous<br>
iterative intake air mass value, said first module (50) providing said current<br>
iterative intake air mass value as a final intake air mass value when a difference<br>
between said current iterative intake air mass value and said previous iterative<br>
intake air mass value is less than a predetermined threshold value;a second<br>
module (52) that determines a fuel mass rate value based on said final air intake<br>
mass value; and a third module (50) that determines a power loss for the<br>
internal combustion engine (12) based on said fuel mass rate value, wherein a<br>
fuel efficiency of the engine (12) is determined based on said power loss.</td>
