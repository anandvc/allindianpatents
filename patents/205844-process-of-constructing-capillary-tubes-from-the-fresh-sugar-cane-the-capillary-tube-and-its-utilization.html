				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION    :-<br>
This invention is directed to a process for constructing capillary tubes from fresh sugar cane &amp; the capillary tube used as the dietary supplement for human and animals to enhance digestion and increasing the stomach capacity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   :-<br>
The stem of the sugarcane comprises of the skin and the flesh. The flesh part of the sugarcane comprises of many capillary tubes which have a width of approximately 50-300 microns in diameter, depending upon the species and the sizes of the sugarcane. The capillary tubes line relatively in parallel along the stem of the sugarcane. Each comprises of the joint and the segment parts alternately lining along its length. The joints of these paralleling capillary tubes may not appear along the same lines, while each segment is of approximately 150-700 microns in length, depending on the species of the sugarcane. Each segment of the capillary tube contains the sugarcane juice, and the joints block the fluid flows between connecting segments.<br>
The capillary tube composes mainly of substances like cellulose, lignin and hemi-cellulose. (The hemi-cellulose accounts for 30-35% of weight of the whole components of the squeezed sugar flesh). The wall of the capillary tube is flexible enough to absorb the fluid, as well as release it when being squeezed or pressed.<br>
The capillary tubes can yield tremendous benefits to human if only there are ways to separate the capillary tubes from the stem of the sugarcane without being broken or damaged. Each capillary tube moreover, is sliced while each slice contains only a single joint. Then finally, the sugarcane juice and the hemi-cellulose  are  extracted.  This  said  capillary tube  can  be  used  as  medicinal<br>
1<br><br>
containers, enzymes, acid and chemicals, since the lignin and the cellulose found in it are substances, which are, insert to the chemical reactions.<br>
The process of constructing capillary tubes from the fresh sugarcane in order to sere such purpose has never cited before, except the JP1993000346818 which discloses how the sugarcane is crushed, fermented by bacteria, and then brought to feed the livestock. Moreover, no prior art teaches about to separate capillary tubes from the sugarcane. Accordingly, this invention has been tried to develop a process for constructing capillary tubes from fresh sugar cane &amp; the product thereof for the purpose of using as mentioned above.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION   :-<br>
The object of the invention is to provide the process for constructing single-jointed capillary tubes from fresh sugar cane.<br>
The further object of the invention is to use the capillary tube as dietary supplement for human and animals to enhance digestion and increasing the stomach capacity.<br>
The further object of the invention is to solve the problems concerning the sugar and sugarcane industries.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION   :-<br>
According to the invention, the process of constructing a single-joint '2' capillary tube from the fresh sugarcane characterizes peeling sugarcane sliced in the direction perpendicular to its stem by the slice machine in such a length that only one joint '2' is remained in each capillary tube inside and the remaining part is the<br>
2<br><br>
segment '3', then the sugarcane juice be removed while the hemi-cellulose extracted from the capillary tube, being useful as the dietary supplement for human and animals, and become the nutrient distributor in order to enhance the effectiveness of digestion, and increase the stomach capacity to resolve the problem of animal food tablets digestion, medicinal containers, chemicals, enzymes, bacteria and absorbent.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:-<br>
Fig.1        shows the structure of the capillary tube T which comprises of the joint '2' and the segment '3' lining alternate along the length of he tube<br>
Fig. 2    shows the cutting lines on the stem of the sugarcane in order to obtain the single-jointed '2' capillary tube.<br>
Fig. 3     shows the diagram of the present invention showing the processes of constructing capillary tubes.<br>
Fig. 4     shows different types of the single jointed '2' capillary tubes obtained through the process of the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process of constructing a single jointed '2' capillary tube from the fresh sugarcane has its own characteristics; that is, the peeled sugarcane is sliced in the<br>
3<br><br>
direction perpendicular to its stem by the slice machine. The sugarcane must be sliced in such a length that only one joint '2' is remained in each capillary tube inside, and the remaining part is the segment '3'. The sugarcane juice must be removed while the hemi-cellulose is extracted from the capillary tube.<br>
The slicing process is carried out by using the SHREDER machine, or Microtome, razor, or any cutting devices. The sharp instruments slice the sugarcane, for other kinds of cut or slash; it can break or damage the capillary tubes.<br>
While using the slice machines, one has to make sure that the turning direction of the blades is opposite to that of the sugarcane stem. The slicing speed; moreover, must be compatible to the amount of the sugarcane juice, for different slicing speeds result in different degrees of toughness, fragility, hardness and flexibility.<br>
The unpeeled fresh sugarcane is an alternative of the peeled one, while the skin of the sugarcane is separated from its flesh after the sugarcane is sliced or during any of the following processes, and by the commonly known method.<br>
The desired length of each slice is the length of its joint '2' and of the segment '3' combined, which is usually around 150-700 microns, depending upon the species and the sizes of the certain sugarcane. Such length results in a single jointed '2' capillary tube and the remaining part is the segment '3'. Having only one joint '2', the capillary tube is able to excellently absorb the fluid or contain substances, whereas one with no joints '2' fails to do so.  However, if the capillary tube<br><br>
possesses more that one joint '2', its capacity to absorb the fluid or contain substance will be decreased.<br>
In removing the sugarcane juice from the capillary tube, the sugarcane is not squeezed or pressed so hard that the capillary tubes inside are broken or damaged. The remaining sugarcane juice then is rinsed off with water. In this matter, the sugarcane can be squeezed with the pressure of 40-100 kg. / square cm. depending on the density of the mass quantity of each specific sugarcane, no matter with or without a stable pressure. The reason for the sugarcane juice be removed is that its presence can obstruct the hemi-cellulose extracting process.<br>
The process of hemi-cellulose extraction is carried out by boiling the sugarcane juice free capillary tube in the 5% concentrated aqueous NaOH of weight/volume at 100-120X for about 3-10 minutes, preferably 5 minutes After the treatment, the hemi-cellulose will be reduced and finally remains only about 1-2% of the weight of the capillary tube. After that, the capillary tube is squeezed/pressed in order to remove the alkaline solution, rinsed with water, and then be squeezed/pressed once again. Finally, the tube be aired and/or dried by the commonly used method.<br>
This hemi-cellulose extraction process will enable the capillary tube to possess all the qualifications needed; namely, single jointed '2' while the remaining part is the segment '3', inert to the chemical reactions, and become useful as:<br>
5-<br><br>
1)	The dietary supplement for human and animals, by mixing the capillary tube<br>
in the food or adding it in medicinal capsules.<br>
2)	The nutrient distributor in order to enhance the effectiveness of human and<br>
animal digestion.<br>
3)	Substance to increase the stomach capacity.<br>
4)	Substance that helps solve the problem of the ineffective animal food tablets<br>
digestion. The animal food tablets are usually made dry with the purpose to<br>
avoid the fungus and accordingly they are difficult to be digested. However,<br>
when added by the capillary tube, such tablets will become disintegrated<br>
and are therefore more easily digested.<br>
5)	Medicinal containers, chemicals, bacteria, enzymes, one or more of the<br>
above, and as capsules whose site of action can be fixed in the intestinal<br>
tract.<br>
6)	Acid solution or acidic substances absorbent.<br>
Different embodiments of the invention are possible to achieve the best method of performance and to obtain single-jointed capillary tubes from fresh sugarcane of different dimension as stated earlier. It will be understood that skilled persons with many modifications, variations and adaptations may carry out the invention into practice without departing from its sprit or exceeding the scope of claims in describing the invention for the purpose of illustration.<br><br>
