				<td>MACHINE WITH TEMPERATURE-COMPENSATED WORK SPINDLE<br>
The invention relates to a machine for machining a<br>
workpiece with a revolving or rotating tool.<br>
For precision machining of workpieces, such as for<br>
grinding, it is necessary that a grinding tool held on a<br>
work spindle be positioned with a precision equivalent to<br>
the desired precision of the outcome of the work. As a<br>
rule, the work spindle is supported on a machine frame via<br>
one or more positioning devices. The positioning devices<br>
detect the position of the work spindle. To preclude<br>
inaccuracies in the positioning that can be caused by<br>
temperature changes of the machine frame, machine frames<br>
are sometimes provided with temperature sensors, whose<br>
signals are taken into account by a control unit that<br>
serve to trigger the positioning drive mechanisms.<br>
However, this does not make it possible to detect<br>
inaccuracies that result from a temperature change between<br>
the engagement point of the tool, such as the grinding<br>
tool, and the fixed bearing of the work spindle. In those<br>
cases, it is therefore often necessary to approach the<br>
grinding tool with a measuring feeler in order to re-<br>
calibrate the machine. This costs machining time.<br>
Based on the above, it is the object of the<br>
invention to create a machine for machining a workpiece<br>
with a revolving or rotating tool, which makes increased<br>
machining precision and/or improved utilization of time<br>
possible.<br>
 This object is attained with the machine as disclosed herein<br>
The machine according to the invention has a<br>
contactless temperature detecting device, which generates<br>
a signal that characterizes the temperature of the shaft.<br>
The temperature is detected at at least one point along<br>
the shaft. Thus temperature changes in the shaft of the<br>
work spindle that cause a change in its length can be<br>
taken into account by the control unit in positioning the<br>
tool or the workpiece. This is especially significant in<br>
machining operations that lead to alternating shaft<br>
temperatures. That happens for instance when machining<br>
operations with a variable energy cOnversion alternate<br>
with one another. For instance, if a machine is set up<br>
and the grinding operations are relatively brief and are<br>
repeatedly interrupted for measurement purposes, then the<br>
spindle temperature fluctuates relatively greatly and on<br>
average tends to remain low. Conversely, if the machine<br>
is operating at full speed in production, the spindle<br>
temperature can rise. The difference can exceed a value<br>
of 10K. These temperature changes cause changes in shaft<br>
length that are in the micrometer range. The control unit<br>
detects these changes in length and corrects them by<br>
taking the change in length into account in forming the<br>
predetermined values from the control values. For<br>
instance, if a temperature increase is detected that leads<br>
to an increase in the length of the shaft by 1 urn, then<br>
the predetermined values pertaining to the positioning of<br>
the work spindle or to its longitudinal orientation are<br>
corrected by the same amount, namely 1 urn, in opposite<br>
directions. This operation can run continually, being<br>
repeated constantly, / for instance at intervals of a few<br>
tens of milliseconds. In this way, even brief temperature<br>
changes can be detected and precluded before they have an<br>
effect. Thus the compensation of the temperature of the<br>
shaft occurs in the course of a control operation. The<br>
measured temperatures are converted into values for<br>
changes in length, by way of a truth table that is present<br>
in a memory device belonging to the control unit. The<br>
truth table can be varied depending on the tool in order<br>
also to detect changes in length that originate in the<br>
tool. Instead of the truth table, calculation formulas<br>
can also be employed, which from the measured temperature<br>
increase or temperature change calculate an increase or<br>
change in length.<br>
The inventive concept is fundamentally applicable to<br>
any machine for cutting-type machining of a workpiece. It<br>
is especially advantageously applicable in a grinding<br>
machine that is additionally set up for electroerosive<br>
machining. While electroerosive machining takes place at<br>
relatively low rpm, for instance 200 rpm, and generates<br>
only relatively little heat at the tool, a grinding<br>
operation takes place at substantially higher rotary<br>
speeds, for instance of 3000 rpm, and with direct contact<br>
between the tool and the workpiece, and as a result a<br>
relatively large amount of heat is generated. The<br>
detection and compensation of the temperature of the shaft<br>
creates especially high machining precision in this case.<br>
Detecting the temperature at the shaft is preferably<br>
done via a radiation-sensitive temperature sensor in<br>
contactless fashion. Contactless detection makes it<br>
possible to measure the temperature quickly and precisely,<br>
even during machine operation. The sensor is preferably<br>
oriented such that a portion of the shaft completely<br>
occupies its detection region. The radiation-sensitive<br>
sensor thus detects the mean temperature of a cylindrical<br>
portion of the shaft. The shaft portion picked up by the<br>
sensor is preferably located between the work tool and a<br>
bearing device that determines the axial position of the<br>
shaft. As a result, the sensor detects the precise region<br>
of the shaft whose change in length, if not compensated<br>
for, would impair the machining precision.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, at least two<br>
temperature sensors are provided, which detect the<br>
temperature of the shaft on both sides of the axially<br>
fixed bearing device. This embodiment has the advantage<br>
that the shaft can carry at least one tool on both ends,<br>
and both shaft portions, of different lengths, can be<br>
compensated for in terms of their temperature expansion.<br>
There is also the advantage that if both sensors show<br>
different temperatures, the conclusion can be drawn that<br>
there is a distribution of temperature in the shaft,<br>
making it possible to compensate for the change in length<br>
even more precisely. In the simplest case, this can be<br>
done by means of a linear approximation, for instance. If<br>
both sensors show the same temperature, it is assumed that<br>
the entire shaft is at a uniform (elevated) temperature.<br>
Based on this assumption, the measured temperature values<br>
are then used for calculation or other determination of<br>
the increase in length that occurs and that needs to be<br>
compensated for. However, if one sensor for instance<br>
shows a higher temperature while the other sensor shows a<br>
lower temperature, it can be assumed that along the shaft<br>
a temperature drop prevails, which for instance is<br>
constant, and the change in length can then be calculated<br>
or determined on the basis of this temperature drop.<br>
It has been found advantageous to provide at least<br>
one of the shaft portions that are located in the<br>
detection region with a low-reflection surface, for<br>
instance a surface coating. For example, the shaft can be<br>
burnished. This averts interfering light reflections and<br>
makes secure temperature detection possible. It is<br>
possible to burnish either a cylindrical region or the<br>
entire shaft, as well as to provide the shaft with a<br>
matte, blackened, burnished or otherwise-coated surface in<br>
only some regions. For instance, longitudinal strips can<br>
be attached to the shaft that pass through the viewing<br>
field (detection region) of the sensor when the shaft<br>
rotates.<br>
This has the advantage that the sensors output an<br>
alternating signal whose amplitude is a measure for<br>
temperature. Thus direct components and drifting effects,<br>
occurring from aging or temperature change of the sensor<br>
itself, are filtered out in a simple way.<br>
In addition, the machine can be provided with<br>
temperature sensors on the detection region, in order to<br>
detect and compensate for temperature changes in the<br>
detection region. In conjunction with the temperature<br>
compensation of the shaft, especially high precision is<br>
attained.<br>
Further details of the invention can be learned from<br>
the accompanying drawing description, or dependent claims. In the<br>
drawing, one exemplary embodiment of the invention is<br>
shown:<br>

machining a workpiece;<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic sectional view of the work<br>
spindle of the machine of Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic view of a control unit for the<br>
machine of Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a tool to be machined, which in this<br>
case forms the workpiece, on the machine of Fig. 1;<br>
Figs. 5, 6 show the tool of Fig. 4 in various stages<br>
of machining; and<br>
Fig. 7 shows changes in length in the work spindle<br>
over time, during machining with and without temperature<br>
compensation for comparison.<br>
In Fig. 1, a machine 1 embodied as a grinding<br>
machine is shown; it is used to machine tools 2, such as<br>
drills, milling cutters, and the like. Thus in the<br>
present situation, the tools 2 are the workpieces. For<br>
machining them, in the machine shown as an example here, a<br>
combined grinding and erosion head 3 is used, which has a<br>
work spindle 4. A shaft 5, which carries tools 6, 7, 8,<br>
9, belongs to the work spindle. The tools 6, 7, 8, 9 can<br>
be grinding tools, erosion tools, or the like.<br>
The grinding and erosion head 3 is held via a<br>
positioning device 11 on a machine frame 12. By way of<br>
example, a horizontal positioning device 14, which is<br>
formed by a horizontal guide 15, a carriage 16 supported<br>
on it, and an associated drive device, belongs to the<br>
positioning device 11. The horizontal positioning device<br>
14 serves to position the grinding and erosion head 3 in<br>
the Z direction.<br>
The carriage 16 carries a vertical positioning<br>
device 17, to which in turn a guide in a drive mechanism<br>
as well as suitable position sensors belong. It serves to<br>
position the grinding and erosion head 3 in the Y<br>
direction.<br>
A chucking device 18 for the tool 2 is also<br>
supported on the machine frame. The chucking device 18<br>
can be held positionably in the X direction via a further<br>
horizontal positioning device 19. In addition, other<br>
pivoting or rotary positioning devices, not shown, can be<br>
provided to enable positioning the grinding and erosion<br>
head 3 as well as the tool 2 relative to one another in<br>
the three linear axis directions X, Y and Z, as well as in<br>
one, two or three pivoting directions.<br>
The erosion and grinding head 3 is shown separately<br>
and in section in Fig. 2. Its base carrier 21 has two<br>
bearing seats 22, 23, each of which holds one bearing<br>
device 24, 25. The bearing device 24 is a roller bearing<br>
that supports the shaft rotatably but axially non-<br>
displaceably. The bearing device 25 is a roller bearing<br>
that supports the shaft rotatably but at least to a slight<br>
extent axially displaceably. The bearings are sealed off<br>
from the outside by a sealing device, not further shown.<br>
This device may optionally also include a means for<br>
supplying blocking air that generates an outward-oriented<br>
air stream. This can cause the base carrier 21 and the<br>
bearing devices 24, 25 to remain colder than the shaft 5.<br>
During operation, cooling lubricant is as a rule<br>
supplied to the grinding tool, which is intended to<br>
prevent excessive heating of the grinding tool. The<br>
cooling lubricant, whose temperature can vary markedly<br>
over the course of a work day, as a rule generates<br>
relatively major temperature gradients or temperature<br>
differences in the grinding tool and other machine parts.<br>
As a result, the temperature of the shaft 5 can differ<br>
markedly from the temperature of the bearing devices 24,<br>
25 and of the base carrier 21. If a flow of cooling<br>
lubricant that strikes the grinding tool as well as the<br>
shaft is turned on or off or even only changed, this can<br>
cause relatively brief temperature changes in the shaft 5.<br>
The base carrier 21 carries a radiation-sensitive<br>
temperature sensor 26, which has a detection region 27<br>
shown in dashed lines in Fig. 2. The temperature: sensor<br>
26 detects the temperature radiation within its detection<br>
region 27 and thus the thermal radiation emitted by a<br>
shaft portion 28. The temperature sensor 26 is disposed<br>
such that the shaft portion 28 located in the detection<br>
region 27 is located between the bearing device 24 and the<br>
tool 6 or 7. As a result of the direct detection of the<br>
temperature of the rotating shaft, even very brief<br>
temperature changes in the shaft 5, of the kind that can<br>
be caused by the cooling lubricant, can be detected and,<br>
as explained hereinafter, immediately neutralized.<br>
If needed, a further temperature sensor 31 can be<br>
provided on the base carrier 21, whose detection region 32<br>
is occupied by a shaft portion 33. The temperature sensor<br>
31 can be disposed such that it detects the temperature of<br>
the shaft between the bearing devices 24, 25, or, as<br>
shown, detects the temperature between the bearing device<br>
25 and the next-closest tool 8.<br>
In addition, a temperature sensor 34 for detecting<br>
the temperature of the base carrier can be provided.<br>
Still other temperature sensors can be accommodated in the<br>
detection region 12 to enable detecting changes in its<br>
temperature and thus changes in its dimensions.<br>
The machine 1 is subject to the control of a control<br>
unit 35, which is shown schematically in Fig. 3. Via an<br>
input interface 36, the control unit 35 receives data<br>
pertaining to the motions to be performed by the grinding<br>
and erosion head 3. These data are provided for instance<br>
in the form of machine control instructions, which contain<br>
information about travel distances and targets of the<br>
positioning devices 11, 17 and 19.<br>
On the output side, the control unit 35 controls<br>
drive mechanisms 37 for the positioning devices 11, 14, 17<br>
and 19. These are each provided with sensors 38, which<br>
detect the applicable positioning position and report it<br>
to the control units via an actual-value interface 39.<br>
The control unit 35 includes a processing block 41,<br>
to which all the temperature signals are delivered via a<br>
temperature signal interface 42. In particular, the<br>
temperature signal interface 42 is connected to the<br>
temperature sensor 26 and the temperature sensor 31.<br>
The processing block 41 includes at least one truth<br>
table 43 or a corresponding arithmetic or computer module,<br>
which converts the detected temperature values of the<br>
shaft portion 28 into the associated temperature expansion<br>
of the entire shaft end between the bearing device 24 and<br>
the tool 6 or 7. In other words, the truth table 43, from<br>
the detected temperature values of the shaft portion 28,<br>
determines the temperature- caused shift of the tool 6 and<br>
the tool 7. Accordingly, from the temperature signals<br>
furnished by the temperature sensor 31, the truth table 43<br>
can calculate or determine the temperature-caused<br>
expansion of the shaft portion between the bearing device<br>
24 and the tool 8 or 9. The thus-determined changes in<br>
length of the applicable shaft regions of the shaft 5 and<br>
the control values obtained via the input interface 36<br>
enter the processing block 41, and are being added with<br>
the correct sign to the Z-positioning values. Thus the<br>
processing block 41 converts the control values, received<br>
at the input interface 36, into predetermined values,<br>
which represent corrected control values. The<br>
predetermined values are then compared in a comparator<br>
block 44 with the positions measured by the sensors 38.<br>
Corresponding deviations ?(X, Y, Z) are output to a<br>
triggering block 45, which triggers the drive mechanisms<br>
37.<br>
Fig. 2 shows how the spacing l1 of the tool 7 varies<br>
upon a temperature change ?5 from the temperature d1 to the<br>
temperature d2. The change in length ?1 is at the same<br>
time the change in the spacing from the value l1 to the<br>
value 12. In the simplest case, the control unit 35<br>
assumes a linear relationship between the change in length<br>
?l and the temperature change ?d:<br>
The machine 1 described thus far functions as<br>
follows:<br>
To illustrate the effectiveness of the provision<br>
according to the invention, it will be assumed that the<br>
tool 2 schematically shown in Fig. 4 is supposed to be<br>
both electroeroded and ground. In its active region, the<br>
tool 2 has a thin plate 46 of diamondlike carbon. This<br>
plate is secured to a tool body 47 of tool steel. Such<br>
tools 2 are precision tools, whose cutting edges must be<br>
manufactured to micrometer accuracy. The plate 46 cannot<br>
be secured to the tool body 47 with the desired precision.<br>
Postmachining is therefore required and is performed by<br>
the machine 1. For the sake of illustration, the tool 2<br>
is shown in Figs. 5 and 6 in an enlarged view, looking<br>
toward its tip, that is, parallel to its axis of symmetry<br>
48.<br>
In Fig. 5, the plate 46 initially has an oversize,<br>
which is represented by a dot-dash line 49. This oversize<br>
is not removable by grinding, at least not at reasonable<br>
effort and expense. Accordingly, the grinding and erosion<br>
head is made to approach the flat side of the plate 46 in<br>
such a way that an erosion tool, such as the tool 9, is<br>
positioned at a slight spacing from the flat side of the<br>
plate 46. An electroerosive process of removing material<br>
is now performed, in which the tool 9 rotates at a low<br>
speed, such as 200 rpm, and a corresponding current flows<br>
between the tool 2 and the tool 9. For illustrating the<br>
invention, it will first be assumed here that the<br>
temperature compensation by means of the sensors 26, 31 is<br>
not in operation. Because of the rotation of the shaft 5<br>
and the power generally converted into heat in the machine<br>
1, the shaft 5 assumes a temperature that causes an<br>
increase in the length of the shaft 5, as represented in<br>
Fig. 7 by a curve branch I. As long as the erosive<br>
machining lasts - which can be several hours - this value<br>
does not change very much.<br>
Once the erosive machining is ended, the plate 46<br>
has the rough surface illustrated in Fig. 6. It must now<br>
be smoothed in a grinding operation. To that end, the<br>
shaft 5 of the grinding and erosion head 3 is speeded up<br>
to a speed of 3000 rpm, for instance, and a grinding tool,<br>
such as the tool 6, is brought into engagement with the<br>
flat side of the plate 46 so as to perform a grinding<br>
operation, which for instance lasts several minutes.<br>
Because of the power converted, the temperature of the<br>
shaft rises in the process, so that the longitudinal<br>
expansion in the Z direction increases, as is illustrated<br>
in Fig. 7 within a time period A, B (curve branch II).<br>
Once the grinding operation has been performed, the<br>
temperature of the shaft 5 drops again, as indicated by<br>
the curve branch III.<br>
These changes in length of the shaft 5 in the Z<br>
direction lead to reduced precision at the tool 2. The<br>
temperature of the shaft 5 is therefore detected with the<br>
sensors 26, 31. In the period of time during the erosive<br>
machining operation, in which only a slight longitudinal<br>
expansion AZ1 was found, the expansion is compensated to a<br>
value that is constant over the entire period of time of<br>
the erosive machining. If the grinding operation is then<br>
begun, after a passage through the instant A, the<br>
temperature of the shaft is detected, and the control<br>
values are increased or decreased by suitable corrective<br>
amounts. As a result, a temperature-dictated shift in the<br>
tool is avoided, and the positioning of the tool remains<br>
constant. This is represented in Fig. 7 by the straight<br>
line IV.<br>
Independently of the exemplary embodiment presented,<br>
which is based here on a combined grinding and erosion<br>
machine, the invention can also be employed in a machine<br>
that is used purely for grinding. There as well, it has<br>
major advantages, because temperature changes in the<br>
machine, of the kind that can certainly occur from a<br>
change in the temperature of the coolant-lubricant over<br>
relatively long periods of time, are compensated for.<br>
A machine for machining a workpiece with at least<br>
one revolving or rotating tool has a work spindle with a<br>
shaft 5, whose temperature is monitored by means of at<br>
least one temperature sensor 26. The temperature sensor<br>
is detected in contactless fashion. The sensor 26 is<br>
preferably a radiation-sensitive sensor, which detects the<br>
temperature radiation output by the shaft 5. In<br>
triggering the positioning drive mechanisms, the control<br>
unit 35 of the machine 1 takes into account the<br>
temperature expansions of the shaft 5 that result, from the<br>
temperature changes in the shaft. The positioning drive<br>
mechanisms serve to position a tool 6, carried by the<br>
shaft 5, relative to the workpiece 2. A machining<br>
precision is thus achieved that is independent of the<br>
temperature and temperature changes of the machine 1<br>
overall, of temperature changes in the coolant-lubricant,<br>
and of temperature changes in the tool 6 and the shaft 5,<br>
that can all be caused by the power converted at the<br>
machining site.<br>
