FIELD  OF  INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for retting of  coconut  husk -<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
It is known that a coconut compr ises a nut havi ng an outer protect ive cover ing fibre, pith and peel. Reference is made in part i cular to the husk consist ing of fibre and pith. The coir or f i bre has commerc ial value for produc i ng coi r yarn whi ch can be woven into coi r products such as floor coverings- For this purpose the husk is subjected to a retting process for causing a separat ion of the f i bres  therefrom.<br>
It is known that the fibres and pith are held together to form the husk by phenoli c compounds and pectin. In fact, the f ibres ave embedded in pectin which is a gummy material and phenoli c  compounds whi ch  together  bi nd  the   f i bres.<br><br>
Simultaneously, the  f i bres  also consist  of   phenolic compounds , pect in, eellulose  and  hemi eel In lose„<br>
The known process of retting consists in removi nq the nut, and cutt i ng the flesh to have an open husk, whi ch is then soaked i n the back waters -Such a process of retting is completed in a per iod 9 to 10 months. For the per iod of f i rst the phenolic compounds and pect in did not allow the rett i ng bacteria to act on the husk. However, with the tedal waves acting on the husk, the phenolic compounds and pect i n ar&amp; washed away , and the rett i nq bacter ia acts on the soaked husk - Still further, and after the initial period of 3 months, water is extrai ned within the husk, and whereby the husk no longer floats but sinks into the back water- The process of retting causes of loosening of the fibres- The pith and peel ar&amp; removed by shaking to cause  a  separation of  the fibres.<br>
One  of the  advantages  of the  aforesaid   known process   is  that  the  separated fibres ar^        of  good<br><br>
qual i ty. However f several distinct disadvantages s,rB associated with such a known process- One such disadvantage is that the retting process requries a period of 9 to 10 months to cause a separation of the fibres. Another disadvantage is that such a process  is not  economical.<br>
OBJECTS OF  THE  INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved process of retting for cause a separat ion  of  f i bres  from  husk.<br>
Another   objects   of  this   invention   is    to propose    a   process   of   retting  for   causing   a separat ion  of  f i bers  from husk over  a  substantially shorter  per iod of t ime  i n  compar ison to that of   the known  art.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a process of retting for causing a separation  of  fibers  from husk which  is economical.<br><br>
Yet another  object of  this   invent ion   is    to propose    a   process   of   retting  for   causing   a separat ion   of   f i bers   from husks  and  wherein  the fibres a,r^   of  excellant  quality.<br>
Further    objects    and  advantages    of   this i nvent ion  will  be more  apparent  from  the   ensui ng descr i pt ion. DESCRIPTION OF THE  INVENTION<br>
According to this i nvent ion there is provi ded a process of rett i ng for causing a separat ion of f i bres from husk whi ch compr ises in applying in at least two steps a micro organism medium to sai d husk, such mi cro organism chosen from a spec ies capable of consumi ng the phenolic compounds and pect i ns  so as  to  losen the  bond  of the  f i bres-<br>
In accordance with this invention, husk is treated with a microorganism medium and then introduced into the back waters- Specifically, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment of this i nvent ion, the  mi croorqanism medium is at least applied<br><br>
twice to t he husk in distinction to a single appli cat ion - As descri bed herei nabove, the treat i ng medium consumes the phenoli c compounds and pect i ns to cause a loseni ng of the f ibers. Simultaneously, phenoli c compounds and pect ins are also present i n the fiber structure. Thus, the treating medium is regulated or control 1ed such as i t does not attack the phenolic compounds and pectins present within the fibers, but only the phenolic compounds and pectins which bind the fibers. Such a control is achieved by avoi ding a single application and havi ng instead at least two applications of the treating medium.<br>
The  treating  medium  comprises  in combi nation:<br>
Spec ies  Desmolyticum Spec ies   Etui lata Spec ies   Dimorpha in a  nutrient  medium consisting  of<br>
peptone<br>
sod i um c h1or ide agar  agar water<br><br>
The cultare is &amp;llowed to grow in the nutr ient medium and af ter a per iod of 7 days i t is ready for application. It is incubated at a temperature of 37'C. By way of example, the treat i ng med iurn compr i ses 10 gms of peptone, 5 gm of sod ium chloride and 10 gm of agar agar , the remai nder bei ng  water -  A  loopful  of  culture  is added -<br>
Thus, i f 5000 husks a^re   formed  i nto  a bundle f      4 kg of the  treat ing  medium is applied  thereto.  Thus, 2 kg   of  the  treat i ng  medium  is  applied   in   equal quantities  in two applications and  after a  period  of one  month-<br>
In accordance with this i nvent ion, the per iod for completion of the rutting process is reduced to 3 months in comparison to the known art of 3 to 10 months-<br><br><br><br><br>
