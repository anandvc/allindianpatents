DESC31IPTI0N NOVEL XNDOLINE CXXIPOUMD AND MEDICINAL USE THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel indoline compound and pharmaceutical use thereof.  More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel indoline compound having an inhibitory activity on acyl-CoA: cholesterol acylrransferase (hereinafter ACAT) and lipoperoxidation inhibitory activity, or to pharmaceutical use thereof.<br>
Background Art:<br>
It is a well-known fact that arteriosclerosis is an extremely important factor causing various circulatory diseases, and active studies have been undertaken in an attempt to achieve suppression of the evolution of arteriosclerosis or regression thereof.<br>
In recent years, it has been clarified that cholesterol in blood is accumulated in arterial walls as a cholesterol ester, and that it significantly evolves arteriosclerosis.  Therefore, a decrease in cholesterol level in blood leads to the reduction of accumulation of cholesterol ester in arterial walls, and is effective for the suppression of evolution of arteriosclerosis and regression thereof.  As a pharmaceutical agent that decreases cholesterol in blood, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, a bile acid absorption inhibitor and the like are used and their effectiveness has been acknowledged.  However, an ideal pharmaceutical agent that shows clear clinical effect and less side effects has not been realized yet.<br>
Cholesterol in food is esterified in mucous membrane of small intestine, and taken into blood as chylomicron.  ACAT is known to play an important role in the generation of cholesterol ester in mucous membrane of small intestine. In addition, cholesterol synthesized in the liver is esterified by ACAT and secreted into blood as a very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Accordingly, suppression of esterification of cholesterol by inhibition of ACAT in the mucosal membrane of the small intestine and liver is considered to decrease cholesterol level of blood,<br>
A pharmaceutical agent which more directly inhibits deposition of cholesterol in arterial walls has been desired as a pharmaceutical agent which more effectively prevents or treats arteriosclerosis, and studies in this field are thriving.  Yet, an ideal pharmaceutical agent has not been developed.  In<br><br>
arterial walls, ACAT in macrophages or smooth muscle cells esterifies cholesterol and causes accummulation of cholesterol ester.  Therefore, inhibition of ACAT in arterial walls is expected to effectively suppress accumulation of cholesterol ester.<br>
From the foregoing, it is concluded that an ACAT inhibitor will make an effective pharmaceutical agent for hyperlipemia and arteriosclerosis, as a result of suppression of absorption of cholesterol in small intestine, secretion of cholesterol from liver and accumulation of cholesterol in arterial walls.<br>
Conventionally, there have been reported, for example, as such ACAT inhibitors, amide and urea derivatives [J. Med. Chem., 29: 1131 (1986), Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 117651/1990, 7259/1990, 234839/1992, 327564/1992 and 32666/1993]. However, creation and pharmacological studies of these compounds have been far from sufficient.  First of all, in these compounds, it is not clear if the blood cholesterol lowering action and cholesterol accumulation suppressing effect in arterial wall due to an ACAT inhibitory effect is clinically sufficiently effective for the suppression of evolution of arteriosclerosis and regression thereof.  Since most of the conventional ACAT inhibitors are extremely highly fat-soluble, oral absorption is often low, and when oral absorption is fine, organopathy in adrenal, liver and the like is feared to be induced. Furthermore, a highly fat-soluble, low absorptive ACAT inhibitor may clinically cause diarrhea.<br>
Meanwhile, hyperoxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is also highly responsible for intracellular incorporation of cholesterol accumulated as cholesterol ester in arterial walls. In addition, it is known that hyperoxidation of lipids in a living organism is deeply concerned with the onset of arteriosclerosis and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular ischemic diseases.<br>
Accordingly, a compound having both an ACAT inhibitory activity and lipoperoxidation inhibitory activity is highly useful as a pharmaceutical product, since it effectively and tertainly reduces accumulation of cholesterol esrer in arterial walls and inhibits lipoperoxidation in living organisms, thereby preventing and treating various vascular diseases caused thereby.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a compound having ACAT inhibitory activity and lipoperoxidation inhibitory activity, as well as pharmaceutical<br><br>
use thereof, particularly ACAT inhibitor and lipoperoxidation inhibitor.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have conducted intensive studies in an attempt to achieve the aforementioned objects and found that the novel indoline compound of the present invention not only has a strong ACAT inhibitory effect but also a lipoperoxidation inhibitory effect, superior oral absorbability, and a strong anti-hyperlipidemia effect and an anti-arteriosclerosis effect, which resulted in the completion of the present invention.<br>

Then, to clarify t±e superior characreristic of the compound of the present invention, its inhibitory effects on hepatic ACAT activity, foam cell formation of THP-1 cell-derived macrophages, mouse hepatic lipid secretion amd in vitro LDL peroxidation were determined and its plasma concentration after oral administration were measured as in the following. Experimental Example 1: Hepatic ACAT inhibitory activity<br>
A high cholesterol feed [a feed added with cholesterol (1%), Clea Japan, Inc.] was fed to male Japanese white rabbits weighing 2-2.5 kg at 100 g per day and the rabbits were bred for 4 weeks.  The rabbits were Jellied by bleeding under anesthesia and liver was removed.  The liver was homogenated, and the<br>
homogenare was centrifuged at 4°C and 10,000 rpm for 15 min.  The obtained supernatant was further centrifuged at 4°C and 41,000 rpm for 60 minutes to give microsomal fractions.  The microsomal<br>
suspension as an enzyme sample, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 5 µl) or a test compound dissolved in DMSO (test compound solution 3<br>
µl) , and reaction substrate [l-14c]-oleoyl CoA were added to 0.15 M phosphate buffer to the total amount of 300 µl.     After incubation at 37°C for 20 minutes, a chloroform-methanol mixture was added to stop the reaction.  Water was added thereto and mixed, and the chloroform layer was separated.  The solvent was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was redissolved in n-hexane.  The mix-ure was subjected to thin layer chromatography using a silica gel plate.  The spots of cholesteryl oleate on the silica gel plate were scraped, and quantitatively assayed on a liquid scintillation counter.  The hepatic ACAT inhibitory activity of the rest compound was expressed as a proportion (%) of inhibition of cholesteryl oleate, namely, the proportion of inhibition of cholesteryl oleate production as compared to control, the results of which are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Experimental Example 2: THP-1 cell-derived macrophage foam cell formation suppressing effect (cholesterol ester accumulation inhibitory effect)<br>
THP-1 (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) cells were passage cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),   and the cells of passages 6-13 after purchase were used.  The cells were suspended in FBS-containing RPMI-1640 medium to give a suspension having a concentration of 4x105 cells/mL.  The cell suspension was inoculated to a 12 well microplate by 1 mL, and treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 200 nM) as a differentiation inducing agenr into macrophage.  Then acetyl LDL 400 µg/mL prepared separately from plasma-derived LDL of genetically hyperlipidemia rabbit (KHC rabbit, Japan Laboratory Animals, Inc.) was added.  In addition, a test compound dissolved in DMSO and diluted with FBS-containing RPMI-1640 medium or a control solvent was added. After culture in a carbon dioxide incubator for 3 days, the cells were washed with phosphate buffered physiological saline (pH 7.0), and the lipid was extracted with n-hexane/isopropanol (3:2).  The cells were dissolved in IM-NaOH and the prorein amount was measured.  The free cholesterol and cholesterol ester in a lipid extraction sample was measured by the method of<br><br>
Kunitomo et al, (1983).  The cholesterol ester was compared between the control cell and the test compound-treated cells, and the cholesterol ester accumulation inhibitory rate of the test compound was calculated.  The results are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
Experimental Example 3: Mouse hepatic lipid secretion inhibitory<br>
effect (Triton WR-1339 method)<br>
About 5 week-old male Slc:ICR mice (Japan SLC) were fed only in the daytime (9:00-18:00) and preliminarily bred for one week.  During this period, free access to tap water was allowed during the nighttime, too.  The mice were divided into a control group and a test compound group at 6 mice per group, such that the average and standard deviation of the body weight became almost the same.  The blood (ca 80 µL) was drawn from the orbital venous plexus using a glass capillary under anesthesia, and at 30 min after blood drawing, a test compound suspended in 5% gum arable solution in advance was orally administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg.  At 30 min after the administration, Triton WR-1339 60 mg/mL solution prepared with physiological saline in advance was administered to the tail vein at a dose of 5 mL/kg. At 3 hr after the Triton WR-1339 administration, the blood was drawn again from the orbital venous plexus.  Plasma was separated from the drawn blood, and plasma TC was measured using<br><br>
a comnercially available measurement kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.).  Changes in blood concentration in 3 hr after Triton WR-1339 administration were calculated and taken as the rate of cholesterol secretion from the liver.  The rate of secrerion was compared between the control group and the test compound group and the secretion inhibitory rate of the test compound was calculated.  The results are shown in Table 3.<br><br>
Experiinental Example 4: in vitro LDL peroxidation inhibitory effect<br>
The blood was drawn from the auricular artery of KHC rabbits weighing about 3 kg and LDL was separated by a conventional method.  A solution (5 p,L) of test compound in DMSO or DMSO was added (final concentration 10-5 M) to LDL suspension<br>
(0.5 mg protein/mL, 0.5 mL), aqueous copper sulfate solution (5 µL, final concentration 5 µm)   was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1 hr.  After the completion of the incubation, EDTA-2Na solution (5 µL,   final concentration 1 mM) was added, and lipoperoxide concentration in the sample was measured by the Yagi's method.  To be specific, lipoperoxide in the sample was color developed by the thiobarbituric acid method, measured as malondialdehyde and the activity of the tesr compound was shown by malondialdehyde production inhibitory rate<br>
(%) [to what level the production of malondialdehyde was inhibited as compared to control].  The results are shown in Table 4.<br><br><br>
