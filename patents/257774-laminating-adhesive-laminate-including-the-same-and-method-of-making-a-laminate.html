				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
The invention relates to preparing dual cure laminating adhesives, and laminates including the same.<br>
Flexible packaging materials are widely used in a variety of areas including food packaging. Flexible packaging is often constructed from film laminates in which a layer of laminating adhesive is disposed between a first film (e.g., a polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide or cellophane film) and a second film. Laminates are often used in food packaging because a desired film property cannot be achieved with a single layer or type of film. By combining films having different properties in the form of a laminate, a desired property or combination of properties can be achieved.<br>
Laminates are typically constructed to have a strong cured bond that is resistant to delaminating stresses resulting from differences in modulus of the laminae, as well as to the added stresses imposed in the use of the laminate including exposure to heat, cold and humidity. Substrates used in food laminates often include metallized surfaces and/or have low surface tension, to which it is difficult to form a strong bond<br>
Various adhesives have been developed for use in preparing laminates including solvent based, water based, two component solventless adhesives, and radiation curable adhesives. Organic solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, and alcohols, which are used in some laminating adhesives, tend to be flammable and may pose environmental concerns. Therefore it is desirable to use solventless laminating adhesives. Water-based laminating adhesives, which often include aqueous dispersions of polyurethane and other components, require the expenditure of heat to remove the water.<br>
Because conventional two-component laminating adhesives often require storage for a prolonged period before exhibiting sufficient strength to permit handling and further processing, various efforts have been made to decrease the rate of cure for laminating adhesives. Areas in which recent efforts have been focused include electron beam and ultraviolet (UV) curable adhesive compositions. Although radiation curing can increase the rate of cure, processes that use such techniques do not always produce an adhesive<br>
and/or a laminate with suitable properties. Electron beam radiation, for example, can undesirably degrade the heat seal properties of certain films.<br>

The invention features a method of making a laminate in which the adhesive of the laminate exhibits sufficient green strength to permit handling and further processing prior to being fully cured. The invention also features a method of making a food laminate in which the adhesive of the laminate exhibits a faster rate of cure relative to existing two-component food laminating adhesives. As a result, the period of storage required before the laminate can be used is decreased relative to manufacturing processes that use existing food laminate adhesives. In addition, because the laminate may undergo further processing relatively soon after it has been prepared, the storage requirements associated with the laminate are reduced relative to those requirements for existing two component food laminate adhesives. The relatively fast rate of cure of the adhesive also decreases, and can prevent, adhesive from seeping through pinholes in the film layers and smearing of the ink present on one or more of the film layers of the laminate. The adhesive composition also has a viscosity at the coating temperature that provides good wet out onto various substrates used in laminates.<br>
The adhesive composition also exhibits good adhesion to difficult to adhere to substrates including, e.g., metallized substrates and substrates that exhibit low surface tension, i.e., a surface tension less than 34 dynes/cm2.<br>
Other features and advantages will be apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments and from the claims.<br>
GLOSSARY<br>
In reference to the invention, these terms have the meanings set forth below:<br>
The term "(meth)acrylate" refers to acrylate, methacrylate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The term "dual cure" refers to a composition that cures through two different mechanisms, e.g., radiation and a reaction between isocyanate functional group(s) and hydroxyl group(s).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The method of making the laminate includes coating a first flexible film substrate with an adhesive composition that includes a 100 % solids two part dual cure composition, exposing the coated composition to radiation, and contacting the adhesive composition with a second flexible film substrate. Exposing the adhesive composition to radiation can occur before, during, or after, and combinations thereof, contacting the adhesive with the second flexible film substrate. The adhesive composition can be directly exposed to radiation or exposed to radiation through at least one of the substrates, where the substrate is sufficiently transparent to ultraviolet radiation. Exposing the adhesive composition to radiation initiates free radical polymerization of the radiation curable functional groups present in the composition, which imparts initial adhesive properties, e.g., green strength, to the laminate. A relatively slower reaction involving the isocyanate groups and the hydroxyl groups present in the composition also occurs over time and provides the final performance properties of the adhesive composition and a laminate constructed therewith. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the present inventors believe that the presence of the unsaturation, and the initiation of free radical cure, speed the rate of cure that occurs between the isocyanate and hydroxyl groups.<br>
The adhesive composition is a dual cure adhesive composition that includes a first part, Part A, which includes a radiation polymerizable polyisocyanate prepolymer and polyisocyanate monomer, and a second part, Part B, which includes polyol. The adhesive composition also includes photoinitiator, which may be present in Part A, Part B, or a combination thereof. Alternatively, the photoinitiator may be provided to the composition separate from Part A and Part B. Part A and Part B of the composition are preferably combined to achieve a stoichiometric ratio of isocyanate (NCO) to hydroxyl group (OH) (i.e., NCO:OH) of from about 1:1 to 2:1, from 1.2:1 to 1.6:1, or even about 1.4:1. Part A and Part B are preferably combined in amounts such that, prior to cure, the composition includes at least about 5 % by weight, at least about 30 % by weight, at least about 50 % by weight, at least about 60 % by weight, no greater than about 80 % by weight, or even<br>
no greater than about 70 % by weight radiation polymerizable polyisocyanate prepolymer, at least 5 % by weight, at least 10 % by weight, no greater than about 50 % by weight, no greater than about 40 % by weight, or even no greater than about 30 % by weight polyisocyanate monomer, at least about 20 % by weight, at least about 30 % by weight, no greater than about 90 % by weight, or even no greater than about 70 % by weight polyol, and from 0.2 % by weight to about 10 % by weight, or even from 0.5 % by weight to 1 % by weight photoinitiator.<br>
Parts A and B of the composition are combined with mixing prior to coating. When Part A and Part B are combined, the composition preferably has a viscosity of from 250 centipoise to 5000 centipoise at a temperature from 65°F to 170°F. The two parts of the dual cure composition then react with each other over time forming crosslinks. The rate at which this reaction occurs impacts the pot life, i.e., the period during which the composition can be coated and used for its intended purpose, of the dual cure composition. Preferably the dual cure composition exhibits a pot life of at least 30 minutes, or even at least 45 minutes. As indicated above, the adhesive composition continues to cure over time through the reaction of the isocyanate groups of the prepolymer of Part A and the hydroxyl groups of the polyol of Part B.<br>
The adhesive composition, upon exposure to radiation, preferably exhibits a green strength suitable to permit handling and subsequent processing of the laminate. One useful method of measuring green strength is lap shear. Preferably the adhesive composition exhibits a lap shear of at least 25 grams/square inch (g/in2), at least 100 g/in2, at least 500 g/in2, at least about 600 g/in2, or even at least about 800 g/in2, and a probe tack of at least 20 g/in2, at least about 25 g/in2, or even at least about 30 g/in2 after exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The cured adhesive composition also preferably exhibits a peel force of at least 25 g/lineal inch, or even a destructive bond to the substrate to which it is bonded.<br>
PART A<br>
The first part, Part A, of the dual cure composition includes the radiation polymerizable polyisocyanate prepolymer (preferably a (meth)acrylate functional, polyisocyanate prepolymer) and polyisocyanate monomer. Part A preferably includes<br>
from at least about 40 % by weight, at least about 50 % by weight, at least about 60 % by weight, no greater than about 90 % by weight, or even no greater than about 80 % by weight radiation polymerizable polyisocyanate prepolymer, and at least about 10 % by weight, at least 15 % by weight, at least 20 % by weight, at least 30 % by weight, at least 40 % by weight, no greater than 60 % by weight, or even no greater than 50 % by weight polyisocyanate monomer.<br>
RADIATION POLYMERIZABLE POLYISOCYANATE PREPOLYMER<br>
The radiation polymerizable, polyisocyanate prepolymer includes radiation curable functional groups and isocyanate functional groups. The functional groups are located pendant, terminal or a combination thereof on the prepolymer. Preferably the functional groups are located terminally on the prepolymer, i.e., the prepolymer is end capped with functional groups. The radiation polymerizable, polyisocyanate prepolymer preferably includes at least about 5 % by weight, at least about 10 % by weight, no greater than about 20 % by weight, or no greater than about 18 % by weight isocyanate functional groups, and an amount of radiation polymerizable functional groups sufficient to provide a composition that, upon exposure to radiation, exhibits a green strength suitable for subsequent processing.<br>
The ratio of the equivalents of radiation polymerizable functional groups to isocyanate groups in Part A preferably is from 0.1:1 to about 5:1, from 0.5:1 to about 4:1, from 0.6:1 to about 3:1, or even about 1:1. The average functionality of the radiation polymerizable, polyisocyanate prepolymer is preferably at least about 1.8, about 2, no greater than 8, or even no greater than about 4, and the number average molecular weight of the radiation polymerizable, polyisocyanate prepolymer is preferably from about 200 to about 10,000, from about 400 to about 50,000, or even from about 600 to about 2,000.<br>
The radiation polymerizable, polyisocyanate prepolymer is preferably prepared by reacting a compound that includes an active hydrogen and a radiation polymerizable functional group with a polyisocyanate prepolymer, preferably in the presence of excess isocyanate. Preferably the compound that includes an active hydrogen and a radiation polymerizable functional group is reacted with the isocyanate functional prepolymer in an amount such that from about 10 % to about 80 %, from about 20 % to about 70 %, or even<br>
from about 30 % to about 60 % of the isocyanate groups on the isocyanate functional prepolymer are replaced with the compound that includes the active hydrogen and the radiation polymerizable functional group.<br>
The term "active hydrogen" refers to the active hydrogen on hydroxyl, amine, and mercapto functional groups.<br>

METHOD OF MANUFACTURING<br>
The composition is well suited for manufacturing laminates. Any suitable method of making laminates can be used. One useful method includes applying adhesive in the liquid state to a film that is to be bonded to form a laminate. The adhesive may be applied using any suitable coating process including, e.g., air knife, trailing blade, spraying, brushing, dipping, doctor blade, roll coating, gravure coating, offset gravure coating, rotogravure coating, and combinations thereof. Useful coating temperatures range from 65°F to 170°F. The coating weight of the adhesive may vary broadly depending on the properties desired of the laminate. Useful adhesive coating weights include, e.g., from 0.5 pounds Ob) per 3000 square feet (ft2) (i.e., a ream) to about 4 Ibs/ream, or even from about 0.5 Ibs/ream to 1.5 Ibs/ream.<br>
The coated film is then transferred to a radiation zone in which the polymerization reaction, i.e., the crosslinking of the individual components, is initiated by exposing the adhesive composition to ultraviolet radiation (i.e., radiation in the range from about 200 nm to about 400 run). The adhesive of the invention develops adhesion, for example,<br>
contact adhesion, but preferably pressure-sensitive adhesion, by virtue of the radiation and the associated crosslinking reaction of the individual components present in the adhesive. The amount of radiation necessary to cure or partially cure the composition will depend on a variety of factors including, e.g., the angle of exposure to the radiation, the thickness of the coating, the amount of polymerizable groups in the coating composition, and the type and amount of photoinitiator. Typically, a UV light source with a wavelength from about 200 nm to about 400 nm is directed at the adhesive coating that is being transported on a conveyor system that proves a rate of passage past the UV source appropriate for the radiation absorption profile of the composition. Useful sources of UV light include, e.g., extra high pressure mercury lamps, high pressure mercury lamps, medium pressure mercury lamps, low intensity fluorescent lamps, metal halide lamps, microwave powered lamps, xenon lamps, laser beam sources including, e.g., excimer lasers and argon-ion lasers, and combinations thereof.<br>
Following the radiation procedure, the first film coated with the irradiated adhesive composition is contacted with a second film, with or without the application of pressure, to form a laminate. The second substrate may be of the same or different composition relative to the first substrate. The second substrate can be applied to the adhesive by application of pressures and temperatures commonly used in film laminating equipment.<br>
This procedure is particularly advantageous for the mutual adhesive bonding of two films that are impervious to radiation.<br>
The bonding and laminating procedure described may be repeated a number of times, so that it is possible to produce laminates which consist of more than two bonded layers.<br>
Another suitable method of making a laminate includes coating the adhesive composition on a first substrate, contacting the coated adhesive composition with a second substrate, and exposing the adhesive composition or the construction as a whole to radiation.  The adhesive composition can be exposed to radiation before, during, after or a combination thereof, contacting the adhesive composition with a second substrate.<br>
Useful substrates include flexible films including, e.g., metal foils (aluminum foil), polymer films and metallized polymer films prepared from polymers including, e.g., polyolefins (e.g., polypropylene, polyethylene, low density polyethylene, linear low<br>
density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polypropylene, and oriented polypropylene; copolymers of polyolefins and other comonomers) metallized polyolefins (e.g., metalized polypropylene), metalized polyether terephthalate, ethylene-vinyl acetates, ethylene-methacrylic acid ionomers, ethylene-vinyl-alcohols, polyesters, e.g. polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonates, polyamides, e.g. Nylon-6 and Nylon-6,6, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, cellulosics, and polystyrene, and retortable packaging laminate materials. The thickness of a film may vary, but flexible films typically have a thickness of less than about 0.25 millimeters, e.g. from about 10 micrometers to about 150 micrometers, more typically from about 8 micrometers to about 100 micrometers. The surface of the substrate can be surface treated to enhance adhesion using any suitable method including, e.g., corona treatments, chemical treatments and flame treatments.<br>
Other suitable substrates include, e.g. woven webs, non-woven webs, paper, paperboard, and cellular flexible sheet materials (e.g., polyethylene foam, polyurethane foam and sponge and foam rubber). Woven and non-woven webs can include fibers including, e.g., cotton, polyester, polyolefin, polyamide, and polyimide fibers.<br>
The substrate can be constructed to exhibit many useful properties. Preferably the substrate exhibits properties useful for flexible packaging and retortable packaging. Such properties include, e.g., high tensile strength, vapor barrier properties, flexibility, rigidity, resistance to thermal degradation and combinations thereof.<br>
The invention will now be described by way of the following examples.<br>
EXAMPLES Test Procedures<br>
Test procedures used in the examples include the following.<br>
%NCO<br>
The isocyanate percentage (i.e., % NCO) present in the adhesive composition is determined by first dissolving the prepolymer in toluene, reacting a predetermined volume of the prepolymer/toluene solution with a predetermined volume of a dibutylamine solution. The amine reacts with the isocyanate groups. The excess amine is then titrated with a predetermined solution of hydrogen chloride. The volume of the hydrogen chloride solution is then used to calculate the % NCO present in the composition.<br>
Viscosity<br>
The viscosity of the adhesive composition is determined at room temperature using a Brookfield Thennosel viscometer with a number 27 spindle.<br>
Peel Adhesion Test Method<br>
The peel force is determined according to ASTM D1876-01 entitled, "Standard Test Method for Peel Resistance of Adhesives," which is incorporated herein. The adhesive is coated on a 1.5 mil thick metallized polyethylene terephthalate film substrate at a coating weight from 1 Ibs per ream to 7 Ibs per ream. The coated adhesive composition is then exposed to radiation from a medium pressure mercury lamp having a power of 300 watts per inch at a conveyor speed of 100 feet per minute. The partially cured composition is then laminated with the second substrate, a 1,5 mil thick polyethylene film. The peel speed is 12 inches per minute. The results are reported in grams per lineal inch.<br>
Lap Shear Test Method<br>
The lap shear is determined according to ASTM D3163 in which the test specimen is constructed to have 1 mil coating of adhesive on a 2 mil thick polyethylene terephthalate substrate laminated to a second 2 mil thick polyethylene terephthalate substrate with a 1 inch x 1 inch substrate overlap. The coated composition is first exposed to radiation from a medium pressure mercury lamp having a power of 300 watts per inch at a conveyor speed of 100 feet per minute. The partially cured composition is then laminated with the second substrate. The Maximum Load is determined and results are reported in units of g/in2.<br>
Probe Tack Test Method<br>
The probe tack test is determined by lowering an eight millimeter (mm) diameter spherical probe onto a sample at 100 grams of force for a period of 1 second using an Instron Model 5542 Universal Tester. The sample is a 1 mil thick coating of adhesive on a 2 mil thick PET film substrate. The probe is then withdrawn at a rate of 1000 mm/second.<br>
he force that it takes to pull the probe off the adhesive is referred to the "Pull Off' force. The maximum Pull Off force is measured and reported in units of g/in2.<br>
Examples 1-8<br>
Part A is prepared by charging DESMOPHEN S-1011-210 polyester polyol (Bayer Corporation, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania) to a reactor and heating to 130°F. A nitrogen purge is started and continued during the process.

The mixture is agitated and the temperature is raised to from 160°F to 170°F. The reaction is complete in from one to two hours. The % NCO is checked periodically to determine if the reaction is complete, i.e., the target % NCO is obtained. The agitation is then stopped and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) (Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan) is added to the reactor and allowed to react while maintaining the temperature from 160°F to 170°F. The second reaction is complete in from 1 to 2 hours. The % NCO is checked to determine if the reaction is complete. The agitation is then stopped and additional LUPRANATE MI monomeric MDI is added to the reactor. The agitation is then restarted and continued until the mixture is homogeneous. The amounts of polyester polyol, MDI, and HEA used in Part A are set forth in Table 1.<br>
