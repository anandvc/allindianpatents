COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"FOLDABLE TWO-WHEEL VEHICLE"<br><br>
 	HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan,<br>
 	having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku,<br>
 	Tokyo, Japan,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]	<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field to which the Invention pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a foldable two-wheel vehicle which can be moved or transported even in a folded condition, for example, in the case of being<br>
mounted on a vehicle, which is contrived to be compact,<br>
and which is provided with a measure against theft and<br>
mischief.<br>
[0002]<br>
As a two-wheel vehicle in which a handle can be<br>
folded, there is known, for example, Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-open No. Hei 10-129556 "Antitheft Bicycle".<br>
FIG. 2 of the above publication shows an antitheft<br>
bicycle in which a handle 1 (Symbols described in the<br>
publication are used here as they are) is folded and<br>
fixed between spokes 2, 2 of the front wheel, and a lock<br>
3 for preventing the handle 1 from being returned to its<br>
original condition is provided.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]]<br>
When the handle 1 is folded and fixed between the<br>
spokes 2, 2 of the front wheel as mentioned above, it is<br>
difficult to move or transport the bicycle in this<br>
condition.  However, in the case of transporting such a<br>
bicycle by mounting it on a four-wheel vehicle or the<br>
like, the bicycle must be put into the four-wheel vehicle<br>
by, for example, lifting it up; therefore, a further<br>
improvement is required.<br>
In addition, in the case of mounting such a bicycle<br><br><br>
or other two-wheel vehicle on a vehicle, compactness is demanded for effectively utilize a limited space.<br>
Furthermore, it is desired that the two-wheel vehicle is provided with a contrivance for preventing mischief or  the like.<br>
[0004]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to enable a foldable two-wheel vehicle to be moved or transported even in a folded condition in the case of, for example, mounting it on a vehicle, to contrive compactness, and to provide a contrivance for, for example, protection of a luggage container under the seat.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to attain the above object, claim 1 is characterized in that a seat capable of opening and closing an opening portion of a storage portion is disposed at an upper portion of the storage portion, a seat opening/closing lever for opening and closing the seat is provided at a front portion of the seat, handle means is provided on the front side of the seat opening/closing lever so as  to be foldable  to  the rear side, and the handle means is provided with lock means<br><br><br>
for locking the handle means in a folded condition, whereby the handle means folded so as to cover a front portion of the seat opening/closing lever is locked with the lock means so that the seat opening/closing lever cannot be operated. [0006]<br>
In the condition where the two-wheel vehicle with the handle folded is mounted on a four-wheel vehicle, the seat cannot be opened or closed, so that protection of luggage disposed under the seat can be contrived.  Further, a lock is not required for opening or closing the seat in a riding condition, and the operations of opening and closing the seat are very easy.<br>
Besides, the two-wheel vehicle can be made compact by folding the handle means.  Further, since the wheels are not locked, the two-wheel vehicle can be moved and transported. [0007]<br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that the seat is fitted to a vehicle body so as to be slidable to the front and rear sides, and the seat can be held by a holding mechanism at a most front side position where the seat is slidden to the most front side, a riding position provided on the rear side of the most front side position<br><br><br>
for the rider to ride at the time of running, and an open position where the seat is moved to the most rear side so as to fully open the opening portion of the storage portion. [0008]<br>
By sliding the seat to the most front side position, the two-wheel vehicle with the seat opened can be made compact, and by sliding the seat to the open position, the opening portion of the storage portion can be made large, resulting in that luggage can be easily put in and taken out.  In addition, since the seat is of a slide type, opening and closing of the seat and putting luggage into and out of the storage portion can be performed where the rider is not seated on the seat but standing astride the seat, so that convenience in use can be enhanced. [0009]<br>
Claim 3 is characterized in that a front portion of the seat opening/closing lever is covered at the most front side position.<br>
The foldable two-wheel vehicle can be made compact, and the luggage under the seat can be protected. [0010]<br>
Claim 4 is characterized in that the seat opening/closing lever is disposed at a front portion of<br><br>
the seat and on the lower side of a seat bottom plate, whereby a hand cannot be inserted to the lower side of the seat bottom plate in the condition where the handle means is folded.<br>
The seat opening/closing lever can be made unoperatable, with a simple constitution. [0011]<br>
Claim 5 is characterized in that a tail lamp is integrally fitted to a rear portion of the seat.<br>
Since the tail lamp can be slidden forward together with the seat, the seat and the tail lamp are brought near to the center of the vehicle body, and compactness of the two-wheel vehicle can be further contrived. [0012]<br>
Claim 6 is characterized in that the handle means includes a left-right pair of handle bar portions foldable in the vehicle width direction, and a handle post portion for supporting the handle bar portions, and in the condition where the handle bar portions and the handle post portion are folded, the front side of the seat is closed in a roughly U-shaped form with an upper portion of the handle post portion and the left and right handle bar portions.<br>
The front side of the seat can be covered with the<br><br>
handle post portion without a crevice and the handle bar portions, so that protection of the luggage under the seat becomes more favorable. [0013]<br>
Claim 7 is characterized in that the lock means functions also as switch means for turning ON and OFF a power source of the vehicle.<br>
With the lock means functioning also as the switch means, the number of component parts can be reduced as compared with, for example, the case where switch means is specially provided independently of the lock means; therefore, parts cost and assembly cost can be suppressed. In addition, since the power source would not be turned ON at the folded position, useability with carefree manner is ensured. [0014]<br>
Claim 8 is characterized in that the lock means is provided on the front side of the handle means and in the vicinity of a folding shaft for folding the handle means to the rear side of the vehicle body.<br>
Since the distance between the lock means and the folding shaft is short, the lock means and the folding shaft or the vicinity thereof can be easily connected to each other, and the structure of the lock means can be<br><br><br>
made simple.  In addition, since the lock is located on the front side of the handle means, a series of operations of, for example, unlocking and returning the handle means to its original position can be easily carried out. [0015]<br>
Claim 9 is characterized in that, in the two-wheel vehicle according to claim 5, a front wheel support member for supporting a front wheel is fitted to the vehicle body so as to be foldable to the rear side, and a rear wheel support member for supporting a rear wheel is fitted to the vehicle body so as to be foldable to the front side.<br>
In addition to the features that the handle means is foldable to the rear side and the seat is slidable to the front and rear sides, the front wheel support member is foldable to the rear side and the rear wheel support member is foldable to the front side, whereby more compactness of the two-wheel vehicle can be contrived, and the two-wheel vehicle becomes extremely favorable for being mounted on a four-wheel vehicle.

The above-mentioned wheel 68 has a structure in which the electric motor 116 for driving the wheel 68 is incorporated in the wheel 68, and the drum brake 126 for<br><br><br>
braking the wheel 68 is disposed on the radially inner side of the electric motor 116. Therefore, the electric motor 116 and the drum brake 126 can be disposed concentrically, the width of the wheel 68 can be made small, and a small-type compact wheel 68 can be achieved.<br>
Such a wheel structure may be adopted for the front wheel 11 (See FIG. 2).<br>
[0050]<br>
In addition, since the electric motor 116 and the drum brake 126 are provided on the same side of the disk portion 122 of the wheel 68, it is possible to enhance the assemblability of the electric motor 116 and the drum brake 126 to the wheel 68 and the maintainability of the electric motor 116 and the drum brake 126.<br>
[0051]<br>
Further, since the rear swing arm 42 as a rear wheel support member for rotatably supporting the wheel 68 functions also as a brake panel of the drum brake 126 and is fitted with the stator 115 of the electric motor 126, the number of component parts can be reduced as compared with the case where a stator-fitting member is provided and/or the brake panel is specially provided. Besides, at the time of manufacture, component parts (the brake shoe shaft 138, the brake shoe, the cam shaft 143,<br><br><br>
the arm portion 142, etc.) of the drum brake 126 and the stator 115 can be preliminarily and partly assembled onto the rear swing arm 42, and, separately, the sensor ring 106 and the rotary magnet body 112 can be preliminarily and partly assembled onto the wheel 68; therefore, by the process of fitting the partly assembled wheel 68 to the partly assembled rear swing arm 42, productivity can be enhanced. [0052]<br>
Furthermore, with the wheel 68 provided with the rotary magnet body 112, according to the present invention, a slip ring mechanism or the like for supplying electric current to the stator 115 is unnecessitated and structure is simplified, as compared with the case where, for example, the stator is provided on the side of the wheel.  In addition, with the rotary magnet body 112 included of the magnetic material ring 111 and the permanent magnets 107 ..., 108 ... fixed on the magnetic material ring 111, the magnetic material ring 111 on which the permanent magnets 107 ..., 108 ... are preliminarily fixed can be fitted to the wheel 68, whereby assemblability can be enhanced as compared with the case where, for example, the permanent magnets are fitted directly to the wheel.<br><br>

First, in FIG. 1, the motor operating switch 24 provided on the right-side handle 18 is tilted to the "FOLD" side. [0069]<br>
Then, when the front brake is operated by gripping the front brake lever (not shown) provided on the right-side handle 18, the front lever is locked by the brake lock lever which will be described later, and a rear<br><br>
brake lever (not shown) provided on the left-side handle 17 is ungripped and therefore the rear brake is not operated, it is detected by a front brake operation detection switch (not shown) that the front brake is operated, whereas it is detected by a rear brake operation detection switch (not shown) that the rear brake is not operated, and a control device (not shown) passes an electric current to the solenoid shown in FIG. 18, thereby operating the actuator 178. [0070]<br>
FIGS. 21(a), (b) are action views for illustrating the action of the swing arm unlocking mechanism according to the present invention.<br>
When the actuator 178 (See FIG. 18) is operated, in (a), the arm lock pin 165 is pulled through the wire 168, and is moved as indicated by the arrow, so that the tip end of the arm lock pin 165 is disengaged from the penetration hole 161a of the projected piece 161, and the front swing arm 37 is unlocked.<br>

The rotating direction of the electric motor 116, namely, of the rear wheel 12 at this time is the forward rotation direction (the rotating direction at the time of running, namely, the direction of the arrow). [0072]<br>
By this, the rear wheel 12 moves to the front side of the vehicle body (the direction of the void arrow (front) is the front side). At this time, the front wheel 11 is in the braked condition and is not moved to the front side of the vehicle body, so that the distance between the front wheel 11 and the rear wheel 12 is decreased, whereby the front swing arm 37 and the rear swing arm 42 respectively unlocked with reference to the vehicle body are tilted with the front swing shaft 57 and the rear swing shaft 58 as centers, respectively.<br><br>
gradually into folded conditions. [0073]<br>
Then, when the predetermined period of time has elapsed from the start of the passage of electric current to the electric motor 116 or when the front wheel folding detection switch 184 and the rear wheel folding detection switch 186 are both turned ON, the control device stops the passage of electric current to the electric motor 116. By this, the folding of the front and rear wheels 11, 12 is completed. [0074]<br>
Next, the action of unfolding the front wheel 11 and the rear wheel 12 which have been folded will be described below.<br>
FIG. 23 is a flowchart for illustrating the main points of unfolding the front and rear wheels of the two-wheel vehicle according to the present invention.  STXX represents a step number.<br>

The handle post 23 is a member provided with step portions 23d, 23e (symbol 23e is not shown; detailed later), adjacently to the groove portions 23b, 23c. [0107]<br><br>
The action of the handle support mechanism 227 described above will be described below.<br>
FIGS. 37 (a) to (c) are action views for illustrating the action of the knob of the handle support mechanism according to the present invention, in which (a) is a sectional view, and (b) and (c) are views of the bar 266 and the handle post 23 from direction A of (a).<br>
In (a), the knob 236 is pushed, whereby the bar 266 is lifted from the groove portions 23b, 23c of the handle post 23. [0108]<br>
In (b), with the bar 266 lifted from the groove portions 23b, 23c, the knob 236 comes to be rotatable. Then, the knob 236 is rotated in the direction of the arrow.  Since the above-mentioned step portions 23d, 23e are present in the direction of the arrow of each of the groove portions 23b, 23c, the knob 236 can be rotated without interference with the handle post 23. [0109]<br>
In (c), the knob 236 is shown as being rotated by<br>
90°  from the position of (b).  The bar 266 comes into the condition of being disposed along the cutout portion 23a of the handle post 23, whereby the knob 236 becomes capable of coming out of the cutout portion 23a of the<br><br>
handle post 23 together with the handle clamp lever 237 (See (a)), namely, the connection between the handle post 23 and the handle clamp lever 237 is released by the knob 236.<br>
FIGS. 38(a), (b) are action views for illustrating the actions of the handle clamp lever and peripheral component parts of the handle support mechanism according to the present invention. While description will be made below based on the constitution on the side of the handle 17, the same action applies also to the side of the handle 18.<br>
In FIGS. 37(a) to (c), the knob 236 is rotated to release the connection between the handle post 23 and the handle clamp lever 237, and, thereafter, in FIG. 38(a), the handle clamp lever 237 is kicked up in the direction of the arrow with the connection pin 243 as a center. [0111]<br>

second end portion 241b and the washer 262 by the kick-up of the handle clamp lever 237. [0112]<br>
With the gap with the distance C thus generated, in (b), the handle 17 can be moved in the direction of the arrow together with the nut member 244 and the center bolt 253, and the projected portion 17d of the handle 17 can be disengaged from the recessed portion 263 of the handle post 23, whereby restriction on the rotation of the handle 17 is eliminated, and the handle 17 can be folded. [0113]<br>
FIG. 39 is a front view showing the folded condition of the handles according to the present invention, and shows the condition where the handles 17, 18 are folded to the greatest extent.<br>
Thus, by folding the handles 17, 18, the maximum width WH (The maximum width WH is smaller than the width of the above-mentioned number plate.) of the handles 17, 18 can be made to be very small, as compared with the maximum width of the handles 17, 18 before folding, which is markedly advantageous as to the containing space, particularly, the containing width in the case of mounting the two-wheel vehicle on a vehicle.<br><br>
[0114]<br>
FIG. 40 is an illustration for illustrating the folding of the rearview mirrors according to the present invention. After the folding of the handles 17, 18 is completed, the rearview mirrors 21, 22 are rotated in the directions of the arrows so as to have roughly the same width as the width in the vehicle width direction of the handles 17, 18 (namely, the interval of the handles 17, 18) .  Here, after the rearview mirrors 21, 22 are rotated, the reflective surfaces of the rearview mirrors 21, 22 are directed to the lateral sides of the vehicle body. Where the maximum width of the rearview mirrors 21, 22 at this time is WM, the maximum width WM is smaller than the width of the above-mentioned number plate.<br>
[0115]<br>

The action of the handle post folding mechanism 274 described above will be described below.<br>
FIGS. 43(a), (b) are first action views for illustrating the action of the handle folding mechanism according to the present invention.<br>
In (a), first, the push rod 288 is pushed in the direction of arrow a.  By this, the L-shaped arm 286 connected to the tip end of the push rod 288 is swung in the direction of arrow b with the support shaft 284 as a center, and the lock pin 278 connected to the end portion 286a of the L-shaped arm 286 is moved in the direction of arrow c. As a result, the tip end of the lock pin 278 comes out of the first lock pin insertion hole 281, and the handle post 23 becomes swingable with reference to the upper portion arm 28. [0119]<br>
In (b), the handle post 23 is tilted down in the direction of the arrow, namely, the handle post 23 is folded. The tip end of the lock pin 278 fronts on the<br><br>
second lock pin insertion hole 297. [0120]<br>
FIGS. 44(a), (b) are second action views for illustrating the action of the handle folding mechanism according to the present invention.<br>
In (a), when the hand is put off from the push rod 288 having been pushed at the time of folding the handle post 23, the lock pin 278 is moved in the direction of the arrow by an elastic force of the spring 282, and the tip end of the lock pin 278 is projected into the second lock pin insertion hole 297. By this, the folded handle post 23 comes into a locked condition, and is in the condition of being fixed to the upper portion arm 28. [0121]<br>
In FIG. 43(a), the arm portion 293 of the main switch 275 has been in the condition of extending to the lower side.  But, in FIG. 44(b), when the key 294 (See FIG. 41) is inserted into the main switch 275 and the key 294 is turned to rotate the arm portion 293 in the direction of the arrow and to extend it to the side of the push rod 288, an end portion of the arm portion 293 approaches the tip end of the push rod 288, so that the push rod 288 cannot be pushed even if tried. Therefore, the lock pin 278 cannot be disengaged from the first lock pin<br><br>
insertion hole 297, and the folded handle post 23 cannot be erected.<br>
[0122]<br>
This condition is the condition of FIG. 4, in which an end portion of the handle post 23 covers a front portion of the seat 13 together with base portions of the handles 17, 18, so that an operation of the stopper release lever 212 (See FIG. 27) provided at a front portion of the seat 13 for sliding the seat 13 cannot be performed, and the inside of the storage net 66 (See FIG. 2) under the seat 13 can be protected from mischief.<br>
[0123]<br>

folded condition, whereby the handle post 23 and the handles 17, 18 folded to cover the front portion of the stopper release lever 212 are locked with the main switch 275 to thereby make the stopper release lever 212 unoperatable.<br>
[0124]<br>
For example, in the case where the two-wheel vehicle 10 is utilized by mounting it on a vehicle, the two-wheel vehicle 10 is required to be capable of being moved and transported for mounting on the vehicle, to be capable of preventing theft and mischief, and to be compact.<br>
[0125]<br>
In the present invention, the handle post 23 and the handles 17, 18 can be folded to the rear side, the front portion of the stopper release lever 212 can be covered with the handle post 23 and the handles 17, 18 in the folded condition, and they can be locked in the folded condition. As a result, the seat 13 cannot be opened or closed, and it is possible to prevent mischief onto the storage net 66 disposed under the seat 13.  In addition, by folding the handle post 23 and the handles 17, 18, the two-wheel vehicle 10 can be made compact. Further, since the wheels are not locked, the two-wheel<br><br>
vehicle  10   can be moved and  transported.<br>
[0126]<br>
The present invention is secondly characterized in that the seat 13 is fitted to the side of the vehicle body frame 25 so as to be slidable to the front and rear sides, and the seat 13 can be held by the stopper mechanism 202 at the most front side position where the seat 13 is slidden to the most front side portion, the riding position provided on the rear side of the most front side position for the rider to ride at the time of running, and the open position where the seat 13 is moved to the most rear side portion to fully open the opening portion of the storage net 66.<br>
