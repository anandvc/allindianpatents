				<td>PROCESS FOR OBTAINING ß-GLUCAN HAVING A LOWER AVERAGE MOLECULAR WEIGHT THAN IN ITS NATIVE STATE FROM CEREAL<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to novel substances which can be extracted from cereals, novel extraction procedures, and the use of the products as biocompatible films and as additives in food and cosmetics.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
ß-glucan polysaccharides present in cereals comprise D-glucopyranosyl units. The units are linked together by (1-&gt;3) or (1-&gt;4) ß-linkages. ß-Glucans of this type comprise up to approximately 15% of the solids in oats and barley cereals. They typically have a molecular weight of around 2.5 million.<br>
ß-glucans are useful as food ingredients. They have neutral flavours and provide bulk in addition to having desirable mouthfeel and texture characteristics. In this context, p-glucans are known as fat replacements in some foods.<br>
The reported methods of extracting ß-glucans from cereal involve a number of steps. First, the milled cereal is treated to deactivate enzymes associated with the cereal. Then the ß-glucan is extracted from the cereal into warm water after which the solids are removed from the solution.<br>
Large quantities of water-miscible organic solvents are added to the solution to precipitate the ß-glucan, generally along with other polysaccharides. The ß-glucan is of low purity and of generally high molecular weight.  It is also known to carry out the enzyme deactivation step after the water extraction rather than as a first step. The deactivation step inhibits hydrolysis of the ß-glucan thereby maintaining a high average molecular weight of the ß-glucan.<br>
Aqueous solutions of the ß-glucan obtained via the known methods have minimal functionality with respect to temperature.  They are generally high molecular weight gums and form viscous aqueous solutions although they do not dissolve in water easily.<br>
The S-glucans obtained by the reported methods can contain arabinoxylans and starch.  These impurities can be responsible for the formation of viscous aqueous solutions during extraction which are difficult to process. Gummy or tacky solids can result when the solids are recovered as a dry product.  These products are difficult to redissolve, even at high temperatures.<br>
The known methods of recovering ß-glucan from the aqueous solution include precipitation of the ß-glucan by the addition of a water miscible organic solvent (such as ethanol) followed by filtration, and spray- or freeze-drying of the precipitate.<br>
The extraction procedures suggested by the prior art have limited commercial potential in view of the number of steps and hence the cost involved.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a ß-glucan product and a simple and effective method of extracting ß-glucan, or to at least provide the public with a useful alternative.<br>
In a first aspect of this invention there is provided a process for process for obtaining ß-glucan having a lower average molecular weight than in its native state from cereal which comprises:<br>
mixing the cereal with water to form a slurry of an aqueous solution of ß-glucan and solid residue whereby the ß-glucan is partially hydrolysed by one or more enzymes associated with the cereal to provide a ß-glucan having a lower average molecular weight than in its native state, separating in any known manner the aqueous solution from the solid residue, and<br>
recovering the ß-glucan from the aqueous solution without deactivation of the one or more enzymes.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the ß-glucan is recovered<br>
from the aqueous solution by: freezing the solution;<br>
thawing the frozen solution to give a precipitate in water, and separating in any known manner the precipitate from the water,<br>
wherein the major non-aqueous component of the precipitate is ß-glucan.<br>
The invention provides a p-glucan produced by the process of the invention.<br>
The invention provides the use of a ß-glucan as a food ingredient, as an additive in cosmetic compositions, as a film forming agent in wound dressings and in food coatings, as a matrix for the slow release of an agent carried in the matrix, and for the modification of the properties of other polysaccharides.<br>
The invention also provides an animal feed consisting of cereal from which ß-glucan has been extracted to a substantial extent.<br>
The invention further provides a cereal for use in brewing processes wherein ß-glucan has been extracted from the cereal.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The cereal used in this invention may be any ß-glucan containing grain or plant material including, but not limited to, barley, oats, rice, rye, triticale, maize and wheat. The preferred cereal is barley. In addition, waxy cereals have the advantage over non-waxy cereals that less leaching of amylase from the starch granules into the extraction solution occurs.<br>
The physical properties of ß-glucans depend largely on their average molecular weight.  The expression "high molecular weight ß-glucan" as used herein means ß-glucan having an average molecular weight substantially similar to the average molecular weight of ß-glucan found in the cereal (typically 2 x 106 to 3 x 106). The expression "low molecular weight ß-glucan" as used herein means ß-glucan having a lower average molecular weight (5 x 103 to 1.5 x 106) relative to the average molecular weight of ß-glucan found in the cereal.<br>
The average molecular weight of the ß-glucan extracted from the cereal is a function of the amount of time the ß-gfucan is in contact with one or more hydrolase enzymes associated with the cereal. Thus, when the cereal is mixed with water, the one or more hydrolase enzymes are believed to become activated with respect to reaction with the ß-glucan.   A portion of the ß-glucan motecutes are hydrolysed to smaller units leading to ß-glucan recovered from the extraction process having low molecular weight.<br>
The hydrolase enzymes associated with the cereal include enzymes endogenous to the cereal and also enzymes present in, or produced by, microorganisms which may have adhered to the cereal.<br>
The average molecular weight of ß-glucan obtained by aqueous extraction of cereal, without deactivation of hydrolase enzymes, can be controlled by controlling the time of the extraction.   In the process of the invention cereal is mixed with water to form a slurry so that ß-glucan is extracted from the cereal into solution.   The longer the extraction time, the greater the amount of hydrolysis of the ß-glucan.   Therefore, a low molecular weight ß-glucan can be obtained if no deactivation of the enzymes occurs.   Additionally, ß-glucan of predetermined average molecular weight can be obtained by predetermining the extraction time.<br>
The cereat may be extracted with water at any temperature in the range 0-80°C, preferably 30-70°C, or more preferably 45-60°C.   At temperatures above approximately 80°C, the enzymes associated with the cereal are thought to become deactivated.<br>
It will be appreciated that the yield of p-glucan recovered from the cereal varies with water temperature during the extraction process. A higher temperature generally gives a higher yield.<br>
The cereal may be mixed with water adjusted to a pH in the range 1-10, preferably 5-8.<br>
In addition to controlling the average molecular weight of the p-glucan by controlling the extraction time, the partial hydrolysis of the p-glucan is anticipated to be assisted by the addition of exogenous P-glucan hydrolyzing enzymes to the mixture or by the addition of acid to the mixture.<br>
It is also anticipated that treatment of the aqueous mixture with an arabinoxylan degrading enzyme, such as a xylanase, or a starch degrading enzyme, such as an amylase, will lead to a p-glucan product of improved purity.<br>
Cooling the aqueous solution of p-glucan to a temperature between approximately 0°C. and 10° C. may lead to formation of a gel.<br>
Any of the known processes for recovering P-glucan from an aqueous solution may be employed to recover the low molecular weight p-glucan.<br>
The cereal, which may be in the form of whole grain, bran, pollard, flour or other powder milled to a desired particulate size, may be stirred with water at approximately 50°C. until a desired amount of p-glucan is extracted into solution, for example, up to 48 hours, preferably up to 10 hours, more preferably up to 3 hours. The aqueous phase may then be separated from any remaining solid matter by centrifugation followed by decanting or filtration. The p-glucan present in the aqueous solution is then recovered.<br>
The average molecular weight of the low molecular weight ß-glucan recovered may be in the range up to 1,500,000, preferably up to 600,000, more preferably up to 300, 000, for example, 5000 to 50,000. It will be appreciated that the average molecular weight of the ß-glucan recovered may vary from cereal to cereal and may vary depending on the form of the cereal. Hence, some experimentation may be required in order to predetermine the average molecular weight of the product for a given mixing time.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the process includes the recovery of ß-glucan from an aqueous solution of ß-glucan by freeze-thawing the solution.<br>
The aqueous solution is frozen at a temperature below 0°C, preferably at a temperature between approximately -20°C. and -10°C. It does not appear to be important how long the solution is kept frozen. The frozen solution is then allowed to thaw, preferably by standing at room temperature (15°C. - 25°C).<br>
The ß-glucan product is recovered as a whitish solid particulate, gelatinous or stringy material which has precipitated out of solution. This is separated by filtration or other means from the aqueous phase and is essentially insoluble in cold water. The p-glucan product is then dried. Drying can be assisted by freezing the precipitate and then allowing it to thaw. This process removes further water from the solid material.<br>
The precipitate may be dried by any known means including air drying, pressing, washing with an alcohol, heating or freeze drying.<br>
The resultant ß-glucan product has been found to be of high purity, generally 70% by weight of the total solids or greater.  Redissolving the ß-glucan containing product in water followed by repeating the freezing and thawing steps, provides a ß-glucan product of higher purity for example, greater than 90%.<br>
While the process provides a ß-glucan product of high purity, it is anticipated that the use of an arabinoxylan degrading enzyme, such as a xylanase, and/or a starch degrading enzyme, such as an amylase, will improve the purity of the ß-glucan by making it easier to remove undesired arabinoxylans and starch as readily soluble oligosaccharides. The degrading enzyme may be used prior to the freezing and thawing steps or the ß-glucan product recovered following the freezing and thawing steps, may be redissoived in water and treated with one or more such degrading enzymes.<br>
The ß-glucans so isolated have novel functional properties.  Products obtained by known processes form viscous solutions that have little or no structure over a temperature range of 0 to 100°C.  The ß-glucan produced by the present invention forms free-flowing solutions that can develop considerable structure. Gels may form at temperatures below approximately 60°C and concentrations above about 0.5% w/w, preferably above 1 % w/w.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a ß-glucan product which forms a soft gel at a concentration above about 0.5% w/w.<br>
Preferably, the ß-glucan product is dissolved when the water is heated to above approximately 60°C.  A gel forms when the solution cools.<br>
Generally, ß-glucan of lower molecular weight forms gels rapidly.   For example, a 30,000 molecular weight ß-glucan may begin to solidify after approximately 1 5 minutes whereas a 400,000 molecular weight ß-glucan may take approximately two hours to form a gel.   Higher molecular weight ß-glucans typically form stiffer gels.<br>
Another feature of the invention is the use of the low molecular weight ß-glucan to modify the properties of other polysaccharides, for example, other high molecular weight ß-glucans.<br>
The unique functional properties of the low molecular weight ß-glucan will have a variety of uses particularly in processed food products. It is preferred in accordance with the invention to simply add the ß-glucan to food products. Because the ß-glucans are natural food components, it is believed the consumer resistance to modified or unnatural food additives will not be prevalent.<br>
One quality of the low molecular weight ß-glucans of this invention is that they have a good mouthfeel. This makes them suitable as a fat mimetic in food products. Their ability to form films which are edible makes them potentially useful as food coatings, for example glazings. The film forming properties of ß-glucans also enable them to be useful as a film for wound dressings. ß-Glucans appear to inhibit the formation of ice crystals in frozen foods. They are therefore useful in frozen foods where a smooth mouthfeel is desired, for example, ice cream.<br>
Additionally, the pores in the solid structure of the gelled or dried p-glucan product of this invention are anticipated to enable the p-glucan to be used as flavours, for example, in foods.<br>
Cereals containing ß-glucan are used as stock feed, particularly as poultry or pig feed.  They will not be as effective as a nutrient in view of the anti-nutrient activity of the ß-glucans.  By extracting the ß-glucans, the remaining solid material will have increased value as an animal feed.  This will particularly be the case with barley.<br>
The invention further provides an animal feed containing cereals from which the ß-glucan has been removed by a process involving solublising the ß-glucans into an aqueous solution and removing the solid material as the animal feed.  The solid material may also be used in brewing processes to reduce problems such as clogged fillers caused by the precipitation of ß-glucans from solution during processing.  Typically at least 30% of the ß-glucan has been removed from the cereal.   Preferably, at least 50% has been removed.   More preferably, at least 80% of the ß-glucan has been removed.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention but are not to be construed as limiting:<br>
Example 1:<br>
1 Kilogram of a barley finished pollard flour fraction was gently stirred with 5 litres of water at 55°C for three hours.  The solids were centrifuged off and the supernatant was frozen at -20°C.  The solution was thawed and the ß-glucan solids remaining in the thawed solution were filtered and dried.   The yield of ß-glucan product was 26 g.  The product was characterised by 13C solution NMR (Table 1).<br><br>
Table 1 (Table Removed)<br>
*The 1 3c NMR spectrum of the ß-glucan product was recorded in D2O at 70°C.   Peak positions are referenced to DMSO in water (δ = 39.47 ppm)<br>
Example 2:<br>
5 Grams of a barley finished pollard flour fraction containing 3.9% ß-glucan was mixed with 25 ml of water at 55°C.  The mixture was occasionally stirred.  After 2 hours the solids were centrifuged off and the supernatant was frozen at -20°C for 12 hours.  The frozen solution was thawed at room temperature and the precipitated ß-glucan product was filtered and oven dried at 80°C.  Total yield of ß-glucan product was 0.19 g.<br>
Example 3:<br>
5 Grams of a barley bran flour fraction was mixed with 25 ml of water at 55°C.  The mixture was occasionally stirred.  After 2 hours the solids were centrifuged off and the supernatant was frozen at -20°C for 1 2 hours.  The<br>
frozen solution was thawed at room temperature and the precipitated ß-glucan product was filtered and oven dried at 80°C.  Total yield of ß-glucan product was 0.065 g.<br>
Example 4<br>
5 Grams of a barley pollard flour fraction was mixed with 25 ml of water at 55°C.  The mixture was occasionally stirred.  After 2 hours the solids were centrifuged off and the supernatant was frozen at -20°C for 1 2 hours.  The frozen solution was thawed at room temperature and the precipitated ß-glucan product was filtered and oven dried at 80°C.  The solids remaining after centrifuging were subjected to another extraction procedure identical to the first extraction procedure.  Total yield of recovered ß-glucan product was 0.19 g.<br>
Example 5<br>
5 Grams of a finished pollard barley flour fraction were heated with occasional stirring in 25 ml of distilled water at 55°C for 1/2 hr.   The solids were centrifuged off and the supernatant was frozen at -10°C.  The frozen solution was thawed and the precipitated ß-glucan product was filtered and dried.  The yield of ß-glucan product was about 0.16 g.  The molecular weight of the product was examined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC).   The results suggest that the average molecular weight of this product was about 560,000.<br>
Example 6<br>
140 Grams of a barley pollard flour fraction were heated at 50°C in 700 ml of water with occasional stirring.   After 0.5 hr the solids were removed by centrifuging.   The recovered supernatant was then frozen at -10°C.   After one day the frozen supernatant was allowed to thaw at room temperature. The thawed solution consisted of a gelatinous precipitate of ß-glucan product which was removed by centrifugation.  The gelatinous ß-glucan product was washed and then frozen and thawed for a second time to give a more fibrous ß-glucan product.  This product could be further dehydrated by pressing out excess water, washing with ethanol and then drying in air. The yield of fibrous ß-glucan product was about 3 g.<br>
Example 7<br>
A very pure B-glucan product was prepared as follows:   100 g of barley pollard flour fraction was mixed with 500 ml of water at 55°C.  After 2 hr the solids were centrifuged off and the supernatant was then frozen at -10°C for one day.  The frozen supernatant was thawed and the precipitated ß-glucan product was removed by filtration.  The recovered material was then redissolved in water at 80°C.  The ß-glucan solution was again frozen at -10°C for one day and allowed to thaw.  The ß-glucan product was recovered from solution by filtration and was washed with water.  The filtrate was then oven dried.  Yield of ß-glucan product was 3 g and a McCleary assay [1] indicated that the purity was 95%.<br>
Example 8<br>
In a series of experiments a barley pollard fraction was extracted at different temperatures and for various times.  Extraction temperatures were varied from ambient temperature (25°C) to 55°C and extraction times were varied from 0.5 hours to 5 hours.  Molecular weights were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).   For each experiment ß-glucan was extracted from 5 g of barley pollard into 25 ml of water for varying times and extraction temperatures.  The solids were centrifuged off and the supernatant was then frozen at -10°C for one day.   The solution was then thawed at room temperature.  The ß-glucan that precipitated was filtered and dried.  The yield was recorded and molecular weight profile was determined by GPC.  Results are recorded in Table 2.   Percentage yields given in Table 2 are based on total ß-glucan content (6.8%) in the dry barley pollard [1].  The yield has been corrected for the amount of liquid remaining in the solids after centrifuging and by assuming the ß-glucan content of the freeze/thaw precipitate is 80% (unless actually determined).<br>
Generally it was found that the yield only depended on the temperature of the extraction process whereas the molecular weight at the GPC peak maximum was dependent only on the extraction time.<br>

wet flour was then mixed with 25 ml of water, and the water flour mixture was heated to 55°C for 2 hours.  The solids were centrifuged off and the supernatant was frozen at -10°C for 12 hours.  The frozen solution was then thawed and the gelatinous precipitate was collected and dried.  Yield of ß-glucan product was.0.07 g.<br>

WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A process for obtaining ß-glucan having a lower average molecular weight than in its native<br>
state from cereal which comprises:<br>
mixing the cereal with water to form a slurry of an aqueous solution of   ß-glucan and solid<br>
residue whereby the ß-glucan is partially hydrolysed by one or more enzymes associated<br>
with the cereal to provide a ß-glucan having a lower average molecular weight than in its<br>
native state,<br>
separating in any known manner the aqueous solution from the solid residue, and<br>
recovering the ß-glucan from the aqueous solution without deactivation of the one or more<br>
enzymes.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the aqueous solution separated from the solid residue is cooled to a temperature between 0°C. and 10°C. so that a gel forms and the ß-glucan is recovered from the gel.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the cereal is a processed form or fraction of the cereal grain or cereal plant material.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the cereal is mixed with water at<br>
a temperature in the range of from 0°C. to 80°C.<br>
5.	A process as claimed in claim 3 wherein the temperature is in the range of from 45°C. to<br>
60°C.<br>
