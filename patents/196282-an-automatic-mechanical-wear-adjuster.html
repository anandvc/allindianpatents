				<td>This invention relates to "an automatic mechanical wear-adjuster", which is applicable for all mechanical cam operated drum brake systems, the transmission-clutch controlling systems, other non-limitative systems and the like, comprising the movable parts, which are specifically subjected by wear-out and are returnable by elastic-force <s of the slaving means and said systems com same.></s>
In any known mechanical cam operated drum brake system for any automobiles specifically in 2-wheeled motor vehicle as the former of above said specific examples, there is a set of brake shoes of internally expanding type. One of which is known as the leading shoe and the other is trailing shoe. In another known art, these two shoes are also respectively employed as either leading or trailing shoes, for the design requirements. These shoes are actuated either by the rotation of brake-cam or with a plurality or the like to open out the brake shoes. Consequently the brake shoe is then normally pressed against the rotating brake drum either to slow down or to stop the wheel ulti¬mately resulting in retarding the moving vehicle. For each brake application, both brake shoe-liner and brake drum  gets  substantial  wear-out,  which  is  though with<br><br>
infinitesimal amount but the cumulative effect of these wear-out, results in increase in the clearance between brake drum and brake shoe-liner. After some period of usage or number of brake-applications, the brake shoe liner as well as the brake-drum-bore significantly wear out. As a consequence, the radial clearance between the brake shoe liner and brake drum bore increases more from the pre-setting value, which was initially provided to meet the ergonomic qualities on brake-pedal/control lever usage. This increase in clearance also increases the free-play of brake—control lever or brake pedal. To maintain the ergonomic qualities of the brake actuation with the same value <control-lever free-play as against the predetermined well pre-set value it re periodical wear adjustment of brake system. a known-present art this is usually carried out by manual-adjustment brake-cam lever-position with respect to brake-rod or being part control-cable. after some specific number above adjustments brake-cam-lever re-oriented over using serration-fit therebetween. in another known outer-brake-cable provided manual length-adjuster any way for adjusting same free-play. problems these arts are that requires></control-lever><br>
manual  effort  for periodical  checking  and  adjustments either by user or by atleast any skilled one. Moreover  for  the case of the above said  brake  systems, which    have   higher   mechanical   advantage    (force-amplification)  from brake-control-lever to the  brake-cam functional contact-point with brake-shoe, the frequency of this adjustment is very high and thereby more significant. In  all the above said known arts, the angle  between  the cam-lever  and the brake-cable/rod is changed due  to  the consequence  of these adjustments of brake-cam—lever  with respect  to  the  brake-rod  or  with  brake-cable.   This results in change of its effective mechanical advantage of brake-cam-lever.   This  will gradually vary  the  braking effectiveness  after every adjustment  of  brake-cam-lever with respect to the brake-cam as another problem. In  a known art of another applications, this manual  wear adjustment  is  called  "Slack adjuster",  which  is  also periodically manually used with high adjustment-frequency. Another improvement of the former art is called "automatic slack adjuster".  In this later known art, it consists  of an actuation sensor like the actuation counter and a slack adjuster,  which  is constituted by the ratchet  and  pawl mechanism or with reducer.  In this, by sensing each brake<br><br>
actuation  the sensor or counter operates the ratchet  and pawl  mechanism to slack the return movement of the  brake control   lever   <pedal with an amount which is predetermined from the actual wear of each full brake application. but in normal usage wear-out liner and drum at application will vary other due to inconsistencies vehicle pay load initial speed road conditions inclusive gradient nature applications i.e. partial or braking during consequently slack adjustment may not be always equivalent causes error adjusted required value. this cumulative adding up after number continuously gradually changes reduces pedal free play as against its preset-value results affecting wheel freeness ulti result ceasing poor ergonomic qualities brake-control levers by increasing free-play. hence limits a demerit constraint for above known art. another automatic slack-adjuster similar advanced than said system requires more></pedal><br>
of parts resulting, in huge size, highly complicated design and functions, more in the weight, initial cost, maintenance and the like.<br>
In   a  recent  known  art  referred  to  the  US   Patent*^ No.5,848,672,    brake   lining   wear   sensing    system incorporated with for automatic wear-adjusting system, has electronically   controlled   displacement   sensors   for<br>
r }<br>
detecting the displacement brake system, movable parts for wear-sensing. This is fed into the memory system controlled by atleast a microprocessor, and then this electronic system automatically adjusts the relative positions of the brake-system linkage system according to the amount of wear sensing. The problems in this art are that this system requires atleast electrical power source for its function resulting in power consumption, more number electronically sensitive parts which are complicate arrangements and prone to electronic failures at any time, lead to more initial cost, maintenance and serviceability. Also in another recent known art referred to the US Patent No.5,922,971, rotation-angle sensor for displaying a plurality of rotations of a shaft has a rotary potentiometer unit with a geared-down drive and the related  parts is monitoring  the  continuous wear  with a<br><br>
"wear-end" indication, brake functions using plausibility comparison of various brakes, simplifying the service and harmonizing of war between a plurality of axles. This recent known art also has the following inherent drawbacks. More number of mechatronic parts as well as electronically controlled system; Complication in assembly, more weight, more initial cost and prone to electronic-failures. The above said prior arts are neither cost-effective and compactness nor lighter weight for the lighter vehicles like 2 and 3-wheeled vehicles. Moreover the above known arts are also applicable to transmission-clutch controlling systems, other non-limitative systems and the like, comprising the movable parts, which are specifically subjected by wear-out and are returnable by elastic-force<s of the slaving means. present invention will now be apparent from following non-limitative description with reference to accompanying drawings in which s></s>

substantially following the said brake cam 2 while in<br>
the forward brake actuation;<br>
f)	the retaining force of said slaving means 8 or its<br>
plurality  thereof on the rocker 5 is so  minimum  that<br><br>
the  brake shoe-return springs 9 substantially  enables to return the brake-shoe 10 which in turn the rocker  5 via the brake cam 2 and; g) the said retaining-force of said slaving means B or its plurality  thereof is so sufficient as to  rotate  said rocker  5  by overcoming all  the  transmission  losses between the corresponding movable parts; h) the clamping-torque of said later free-wheel means 8 or its plurality thereof is so sufficient to hold the said brake  cam 2 against the retaining-force of the  brake-shoe-return-springs  9  exerted  upon  the  brake-shoes which in turn transfers to the brake-cam 2. This   invention   described   hereinabove   substantially performs the following operations while using : During  the  forward brake actuation, the brake-cam  2  is rotated  by  said brake-cam-lever 1  through  said  former free-wheel  means 3 to actuate the brake show 10 and  said slaving  means 8 simultaneously enables said rocker  5  to substantially  follow said brake cam 2 by  the  retaining-force of said slaving means 8 on said rocker 5 in the said forward direction of said brake cam actuation. During the releasing of the brake cam 2 by the brake  show return  spring<s>  9 through the brake  shoes 10 and being<br><br>
directionally opposite to said forward brake actuation, the rocker 5 is rotated by the brake cam 2 through the later free-wheel means 7 in the reverse direction opposite to its forward brake actuation and by overcoming the elastic force of said slaving means;<br>
During the forward brake actuation and after brake shoes 10 just touch the brake drum (not shown in Figures), any further forward movement of brake cam 2, which is inevitable, is substantially allowed by the free-wheeling action of the later free-wheel means 7. So it enables the brake cam 2 to actuate the brake shoes i0 against the rotating brake drum.<br>
While releasing of the brake, the said rocker 5 is meant for specifically limiting the return movement of said brake cam 2 with respect to said brake anchor panel 4 through its stopper arrangements 5 A and 6A only up to a predetermined distance. This predetermined distance is the substantially equal in magnitude of forward movement of the rocker 5 from its position being the same position of said brake cam 2 with which the brake control lever is at the normal positions to the other position of said brake cam 2 by which the brake shoes 10 just touch the brake drum.<br>
With respect to  this  invention,   any  further  forward<br>
14<br><br>
movement of said brake cam 2 after the said brake shoes 10 just touch the brake drum due to the wear-out of said both brake-shoe liner and brake drum, irrespective of its the magnitude, is deduced from the brake cam return-movement during its brake-releasing at every brake application. Also any further return movement of cam lever 1 beyond its said predetermined position for which said brake cam movement is limited by said rocker 5 through said stopper mechanisms 5A and 6A on both said rocker 5 and rocker-housing 6, is facilitated by said first free-wheel means 3 being in the free-wheeling mode. Further, this movement of said cam lever 1 is ultimately limited when the brake control lever reaches at normal position by any one of its known stopper arrangements and<br>
This substantially enables to maintain the free-play of brake control lever by eliminating the effect of the cumulative wear-out of both brake show-liner and brake drum<br>
As the effect of the above-described operations, the free-play of brake control lever is maintained the same as in the beginning, resulting in the elimination of any  manual adjustment  of free-play or wear-out till the  dismantling of  above described brake system assembly or reaching  the<br><br>
wear-liffl it whichever is earlier.<br>
Further the relative po8ition(s) of stopper arrangement SA and 6A of said rocker S and either said rocker-housing 6 or being an integral part with said brake-anchor-panel 4, are provided with preferably adjustable manner from each other so as to adjust the relative distance therebetween. This facilitates to vary and re-fix the brake-control-lever free-play as per the requirements. This invention described herein above is also applicable in the same manner for transmission-clutch controlling system, other n on-limitative systems and the like comprises the relatively movable parts which are specifically subjected by wear-out and are returnable by the elastic-force(s) of the slaving means acted upon the output-movable part.<br>
The terms and expressions used herein are ilhistrative and not limitative in any sense.<br><br><br>
