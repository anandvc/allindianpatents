				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The invention concerns certain novel quinazoline compounds, or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, which possess anti-tumour activity and are accordingly useful in methods of treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also concerns processes for the manufacture of said quinazoline compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapeutic methods, for example in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the prevention or treatment of solid tumour disease in a warm-blooded animal such as man.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many of the current treatment regimes for diseases resulting from the abnormal regulation of cellular proliferation such as psoriasis and cancer, utilise compounds that inhibit DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. To date, compounds used in such treatments are generally toxic to cells however their enhanced effects on rapidly dividing cells such as tumour cells can be beneficial. Alternative approaches to these cytotoxic anti-tumour agents are currently being developed, for example selective inhibitors of cell signaling pathways.<br>
These types of inhibitors are likely to have the potential to display an enhanced selectivity of action against tumour cells and so are likely to reduce the probability of the therapy possessing unwanted side effects.<br>
Eukaryotic cells are continually responding to many diverse extracellular signals that enable communication between cells within an organism. These signals regulate a wide variety of physical responses in the cell including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and motility. The extracellular signals take the form of a diverse variety of soluble factors including growth factors as well as paracrine and endocrine factors. By binding to specific transmembrane receptors, these ligands integrate the extracellular signal to the intracellular signalling pathways, therefore transducing the signal across the plasma membrane and allowing the individual cell to respond to its extracellular signals. Many of these signal transduction processes utilise the reversible process of the phosphorylation of proteins that are involved in the promotion of these diverse cellular responses. The phosphorylation status of target proteins is regulated by specific kinases and phosphatases that are responsible for the regulation of about one third of all proteins encoded by the mammalian genome. As phosphorylation is such an important regulatory mechanism in the signal transduction process, it is therefore not surprising that aberrations in these intracellular pathways result in<br><br>
Without wishing to imply that the compounds disclosed in the present invention possess pharmacological activity only by virtue of an effect on a single biological process, it is believed that the compounds provide an anti-tumour effect by way of inhibition of one or more of the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are involved in the signal transduction steps which lead to the proliferation of tumour cells. In particular, it is believed that the compounds of the present invention provide an anti-tumour effect by way of inhibition of EGFR receptor tyrosine kinase.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Generally the compounds of the present invention possess potent inhibitory activity against the erbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, for example by inhibition of EGFR and/or erbB2 and/or erbB4 receptor tyrosine kinases, whilst possessing less potent inhibitory activity against other kinases. Furthermore, generally the compounds of the present invention possess substantially better potency against the EGFR tyrosine kinase over that of the erbB2 tyrosine kinase. Accordingly, it may be possible to administer a compound according to the present invention at a dose that is sufficient to inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase whilst having no significant effect upon erbB2 (or other) tyrosine kinases. The selective inhibition provided by the compounds according to the present invention may provide treatments for conditions mediated by EGFR tyrosine kinase, whilst reducing undesirable side effects that may be associated with the inhibition of other tyrosine kinases.<br>
