Fermentation Procedures Example A<br>
Seed medium YMP3 containing 1% glucose; 0.25% beef extract; 0.5% bacto-peptone; 0.25% Nad; 0.8% CaC03 was inoculated with 0.1% of a frozen vegetative stock of the microorganism, strain A2-2 of Pseudomonas fluorescens, and incubated on a rotary shaker (250 rpm) at 27°C.   After 30 h of incubation, the seed culture was added to a agitated-vessel fermentor with a production medium composed of 2% dextrose; 4% mannitol, 2% dried brewer''''''''s yeast (Vitalevor® Biolux, Belgium}; 1% (NH4)2SO4 0.04% K2HP04; 0.8 KC1; 0.001% FeCl3; 0.1% L-Tyr; 0.8% CO3Ca; 0.05% PPG-2000; 0.2% anti-foam silicone (ASSAF-100, RHODIA UK).   The sterilisation was carried out at 122°C 30 minutes.   The volume inoculated was a 2% (v/v). The temperature was 27°C (0 to 16h) and 24°C from 16h to final process (41 hours). The dissolve oxygen-pressure was upper to 25%. The pH was controlled at 6.0 with diluted sulphuric acid since 28 hours till final process. The overpressure was 0.5 bar.   A 1% mannitol or sorbitol was added from 16 h to final process (for two days running) and 2% for three days fermentation-process.<br>
After 41 or 64 hours, the fermentation broth must be extracted for recovery safracin B or KCN treatment in the clarified broth for recovery safracin B - cyano.<br>
Example B<br>
Obtention of safracin B cyano from the crude extract.<br>
A clarification or filtration from the fermentation broth at pH 6 removes the solids. The clarified broth was adjusted a pH 9.5 with diluted sodium hydroxide and extracted twice with 2:1 (v/v) ethyl acetate, methylene chloride or butyl acetate. The extraction was carried out<br>
into an agitated-vessel during 20'''''''', the temperature of the mixture was maintained at 8 to 10°C. The two phases were separated by a liquid-liquid centrifuge. The organic phase was dried with sodium sulphate anhydrous or frozen and then filtered for removing ice. This organic phase (ethyl acetate layer) was evaporated until obtention of an oil-crude extract.<br>
Example C<br>
Obtention of safracin B cyano from the clarified broth.<br>
A clarification or filtration from the fermentation broth at pH 6 removes the solids.   The clarified broth was adjusted at pH 3.9 with concentrated acetic acid.   0.5 grams per litre of KCN are added to the clarified broth an incubated at 20°C during 1 hour with agitation. Then, the temperature was decreased at 15°C and the pH was adjusted at 9.5 with diluted sodium hydroxide and extracted with 2:1.5 (v/v) ethyl acetate.   The extraction was carried out into an agitated-vessel during 20 minutes, the temperature of the mixture was maintained at 8 to 10°C.   The two phases were separated by a liquid-liquid centrifuge.   The organic phase was dried with sodium sulphate anhydrous.   This organic phase (ethyl acetate layer) was evaporated until obtention of an oil-crude extract.   This extract was purified by flash column chromatography (SiO?, gradient 20:1 to 10: to 5:1 ethyl acetate:methanol) to afford quantitatively compound 2 as a light yellow solid.<br>
