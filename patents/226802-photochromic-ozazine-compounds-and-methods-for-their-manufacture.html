				<td>PHOTOCHROMIC OXAZINE COMPOUNDS AND METHODS FOR THEIR<br>
MANUFACTURE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to oxazine compounds. In particular, the<br>
invention provides oxazine compounds and methods for their manufacture, which<br>
compounds are useful as photochromic compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Various classes of photochromic compounds have been synthesized and<br>
suggested for use in applications in which reversible color changes or darkening is<br>
induced by sunlight. For example, spirooxazine and chromene compounds are<br>
known for excellent fatigue resistance. Additionally, photochromic 2,2-disubstituted<br>
[2H-l,4]-naphthoxazine compounds, such as those are disclosed in United States<br>
Patent No. 5,801,243, are known. These compounds have better fatigue resistance<br>
than chromene compounds, but are disadvantageous in that methods for their<br>
preparation are extremely limited. Thus, a need exists for additional photochromic<br>
oxazine compounds that overcome the disadvantages of the known compounds.<br>
Description of the Invention and its Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides oxazine compounds having an aromatic<br>
substituent at the 2 position of the oxazine moiety, as well as methods for<br>
synthesizing these compounds.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a compound comprising,<br>
consisting essentially of, and consisting of Formula 1.<br>
wherein X is nitrogen or carbon; R1, R2, R3, and R4 are identical or different and each<br>
independently may be hydrogen, hydroxy, halogen, benzyl, formyl, trifluoromethyl,<br>
nitro, cyano, aryl, aryl (C1-C4)alkyl, aryloxy, cyclo (C3 - C6)alkyl, (C1 -<br>
C18)alkoxy, halo (C1-C6)alkoxy, (C1 - C4)alkoxycarbonyl or a heterocyclic nitrogen-<br>
containing substituent having 5 or 6 atoms in the ring, such as, without limitation,<br>
pyrrolidino, piperidino and morpholino; and n = 1 or 2. When n = 1, there is one<br>
substituent on the phenyl moiety or pyridine moiety and R1 or R2 may be located at<br>
the ortho, meta, or para position of the phenyl ring.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, X is carbon or nitrogen; R1, R2, R3, and R4 are<br>
each independently hydrogen, hydroxy, fluoro, chloro, bromo, benzyl, formyl,<br>
trifluoromethyl, nitro, cyano, aryl, aryl (C1 - C4)alkyl, aryloxy, cyclo (C3 - C4)alkyl,<br>
(C1 - C4)alkoxy, (C1 - C4)alkoxycarbonyl, or a heterocyclic nitrogen-containing<br>
substituent having 5 or 6 atoms in the ring, such as without limitation pyrrolidino,<br>
piperidine, and morpholino; and n - 1 or 2. More preferably, X is carbon or<br>
nitrogen, R1, R2, R3, and R4 are each hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, methyl, methoxy,<br>
ethoxy, methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, piperidino, morpholino, or pyrrolidino,<br>
and n = 1 or 2.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment the invention provides a compound that is<br>
2,2-diphenyl-phenanthro (9,10)2H-[1 ,4]-oxazine, 2-(4-methoxyphenyI)-2-phenyl-<br>
 phenanthro (9, ]0)2H-[l,4]-oxazine, 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-<br>
phenanthro (9,10)-2H-[1,4]-oxazine, or 2,2-Bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-phenanthro<br>
(9,10)2H-[l,4]-oxa2ine.<br>
The compound of Formula I may be prepared by the following Reactions A<br>
 through E. For all reactions, R1, R2 and "n" are the same as defined hereinabove.<br>
Benzophenones represented by Formula IV below are commercially available cr<br>
may be prepared by Friedel-Crafts reaction using a benzoyl chloride of Formula II<br>
and a benzene of Formula III. The Friedel-Crafts reaction is described in George A,<br>
Olah, "Friedel-Crafts and Related Reaction" (Vol. 3, 1964).<br>
In Reaction A, the compounds represented by Formulae II and in are<br>
dissolved in dichloromethane and reached in the presence of a Lewis acid including<br>
wihtout limitation, aluminum chloride, to form the corresponding subsituted<br>
benzophenone.<br>
dissssolved in dichJoxomethane and reacted in the presence of a Lewis acid including,<br>
without limitation, aluminum chloride, to form the corresponding substituted<br>
benzophenone.<br><br>
The disubstifuted acrylic acid represented by Formula VI may be prepared by<br>
alternative reactions as shown in Reaction B and C. In reaction B, the<br>
benzophenone is reacted with acetonitrile in the presence of an excess amount of<br>
sodium hydroxide to form the 2,2-disubstituted acrylonitrile of Formula V, which<br>
process is described in J. Org. Chem., 44 (25), 4640-4649 (1979). After<br>
hydrolyzation with sodium hydroxide in ethylene glycol, followed by acidification,<br>
 the disubstituted acrylic acid may be obtained.<br>
Alternatively in Reaction C, a Hornor-Emmons reaction as described in<br>
Tetrahedron, 52 (31), 10455-10472 (1996), may be conducted starting from a<br>
benzophenone. The resulted 3,3-disubstituted acrylic acid ethyl ester of Formula<br>
 VII may be hydrolyzed to form the disubstituted acrylic acid represented of Formula<br>
VI. R1, R2 and "n" are the same as defined herein before.<br><br>
In Reaction D, the 3,3-di-substituted acrylic acid is treated with thionyl<br>
chloride, followed by reaction with sodium azide to form the 3,3-disubstituted but-2-<br>
enoyl azide of Formula VIII. Under heating in nonpolar solvent including, without<br>
limitation, benzene or toluene, the 3,3-disubstituted but-2-enoyl azide rearranges to<br>
form the isocyanate of Formula DC.<br>
The critical step in the synthesis of the photochromic oxazines of Formula I<br>
is shown in Reaction E, in which an isocyanate derivative of Formula IX is reacted<br>
with a symmetric quinone including, without limitation, a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted phenanthrene-9,10-dione and substituted or unsubstituted 1,10-<br>
phenanthroline-5,6-dione of Formula X, in the presence of a catalytic amount of<br>
triphenyl arsen oxide in a suitable organic solvent under mild conditions for a time,<br>
generally about 2 to about 10 hours, sufficient to complete the reaction. Organic<br>
solvents that may be used include, without limitation, benzene, dioxane,<br>
tetrahydofbran ("THF"), toluene, and the like and combinations thereof. Reaction<br>
temperatures will vary and typically range from about 40°C to about 120°C. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, a solvent such as benzene or toluene is used and the reaction<br>
is carried out at about 50 to about 110°C for about 1 to about 15 hours. More<br>
preferably, the solvent is toluene or benzene and the reaction is carried out at about<br>
60 to about 80°C for about 2 to about 4 hours.<br>
Alternatively, the photochromic oxazine compounds of the invention may be<br>
prepared as shown in Reactions F and G. In the reactions R1, R2 and "n" are the<br>
same as defined hereinabove. In Reaction F, the benzophenone of Formula IV is<br>
 converted to a 1,1-disubstituted epoxide of Formula XI by treatment with trimethyl<br>
sulfoxinium iodide and potassium tert-butoxide in dimethyl sulfoxide ("DMSO").<br>
This reaction is described in J. Org. Chem., 62 (19), 6547-6561 (1997). Treatment<br>
of the substituted epoxide with sodium azide in N, N-dimethylformamide ("DMF")<br>
in the presence of lithium chloride forms the substituted 2-azido-1,1-disubstituted<br>
 ethylene of Formula XII.<br>
Following the procedure described in ). Org. Chem., 33 (6), 2411-2416<br>
(1968), dehydration of the 2-azido-1,1-disubstituted ethylene by treatment with<br>
thionyl chloride in pyridine results in the 2-azido- 1,1-disubstituted ethylene of<br>
Formula XIII. A subsequent Staudinger reaction by treatment of the 2-azido- 1,1-<br>
disubstituted ethylene with triphenylphosphine forms the ylide represented by<br>
Formula XIV.<br>
Heating the ylide with a symmetric quinone of Formula X in any suitable<br>
solvent for a time sufficient to complete the reaction affords the desired oxazine of<br>
Formula I. The organic solvent used may be, without limitation, benzene, dioxane,<br>
tetrahydofuran, toluene, and the like and combinations thereof. Reaction<br>
temperature will vary and typically ranges from about 60°C to about 120°C and<br>
reaction time from about 2 to about 24 hours. In a preferred embodiment, the solvent<br>
used is benzene or toluene and the reaction is carried out at about 70 to about 100°C<br>
for about 5 to about 5 hours.<br>
The oxazines of the invention may be used in any applications in which<br>
organic photochromic substances are typically employed including, without<br>
limitation, ophthalmic lenses, windows, automotive transparencies, polymer films,<br>
and the like. The oxazines of the invention may be utilized in an organic solvent or<br>
in organic polymer host. The organic solvent may be any suitable solvent including,<br>
 without limitation, benzene, toluene, methyl ethylketone, acetone, ethanol,<br>
niethanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate, etbylene glycol, xylene,<br>
cylcohexane, N-methyl pyrroiidinone, and the like and combinations thereof. The<br>
host polymer maybe a transparent polymer such as polymethacrylate, polystyrene,<br>
polycarbonate and cellulose acetate. The amount of oxazine used is such that the<br>
organic host material to which the photochromic compound, or mixture of<br>
compounds, is applied or in which they are incorporated exhibits the desired<br>
resultant color, e.g.,, a substantially neutral color when activated with unfiltered<br>
sunlight. The amount of photochrome used in the solution or polymer matrix<br>
depends on the degree of darkening desired and usually is about 0.001 to about 20 %<br>
by weight of the host polymer.<br>
The invention will be clarified further by a consideration of the following,<br>
non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Step 1.<br>
Into a 100 ml three-necked flask was charged solid KOH (3.30 g, 0.05 mole)<br>
and 25 ml acetonitrile under argon which was then heated to reflux. Benzophenone<br>
(9. 1g, 0.05 mole) in 20 ml acetonitrile was added in a stream with stirring. After 8<br>
hours of reflux, the hot reaction solution was poured onto 100 g crushed ice and<br>
extracted with dichloromethane (3x15 ml). The combined organic extract was<br>
washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. Solvent was<br>
removed, the residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (ether-<br>
hexane 1:5 as eluent), 7.9 g colorless oil was obtained (yield: 77%). 1HNMR<br>
showed the product to have a structure consistent with 3,3-diphenyl-acrylonitrile.<br>
 1HNMR (CDCl3): 5 5.75 (s, 1H), 7.27-7.50 (m, 1OH).<br>
Step 2.<br>
The 3,3-diphenyl-acrylonitrile (5.76g, 2.81 mrnol) produced in Step 1 and<br>
sodium hydroxide (11.2g, 280 mmol) were refluxed in a mixture of 180 ml ethylene<br>
 glycol and 1 ml water for 3 days. The reaction mixture was cooled down and diluted<br>
with 100 ml water, acidified with 5 M hydrochloric acid until the pH was 
filtered with suction and washed with water completely. The solid paste was<br>
dissolved in ethyl acetate, and washed with dilute hydrochloric acid. The organic<br>
layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted twice with ethyl acetate.<br>
The combined ethyl acetate solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and ;<br>
filtered. The solvent was removed in vacuo until the total volume was about 40 ml.<br>
The solution was filtered through a short silica gel column and washed with ethyl<br>
acetate. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, the residue was titrated with a small<br>
volume of hexane-ethyl acetate (4 :1), recrystallized from ethyl acetate/bexane.<br>
Colorless crystal (5.34g) was obtained (yield: 84.8%). lHNMR showed thatthe<br>
product to have a structure consistent with 3,3-diphenyl-acrylic acid.<br>
1HNMR (CDCl3): 5 6.38 (s, 1H), 7.24-7 35 (m, 1H), 7.40-7.46 (m, 3H).<br>
Step 3.<br>
A suspension of acrylic acid (225 mg, 1 mmol) in dry benzene (4 ml) was<br>
refluxed with excess thionyl chloride (0.20 ml) for two hours. Removal of the<br>
solvent and excess thionyl chloride under reduced pressure gave the required 3,3-<br>
diphenyl-acrylic acid chloride. The acyl chloride in dry THF (2.5 ml) was cooled to<br>
0°C and treated with a solution of sodium azide (130 mg, 2 mmol) in water (2 ml).<br>
7 he mixture was stirred at 0° C for 2 hours before water (10 ml) was added. The<br>
mixture was extracted with ether (2x10 ml), and dried with anhydrous sodium<br>
sulfate.<br>
Removal of the solvent under reduce pressure afforded a yellow oil (200 rag)<br>
which was heated to 80° C overnight together with 9,10-phenanthrene quinonc (146<br>
mg, 0.7 mmol) and triphenyl arsen oxide (16 mg) in dry toluene (12 ml). After<br>
chromatography (silica gel, dichloromethane-hexane 2 : 1 as eluent) and<br>
 recrystallization from dichloromethane-hexane, 203 mg of the desired photochromic<br>
oxazine was obtained as white (slightly pale yellow) crystal (yield: 52.7%).<br>
Example 2<br>
Step 1.<br>
Trimethylsulfoxonium iodide (1.12 g, 5 mmol) and potassium tert-butoxide<br>
(0.59 g, 5 mmol) were stirred in DMSO (10 ml) at room temperature for 10 minutes.<br>
Benzophenone (0.77g, 4.2 mmol) was added and the mixture stirred at 40°C for 24<br>
hours after which it was cooled, crushed ice and water were added and extracted<br>
with ether (3x15 ml). The combined etherate solution was washed with water,<br>
 dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. Solvent was removed and a<br>
pale yellow oil resulted that contained mostly 1,1-diphenyloxirane, which was used<br>
directly in Step 2 without purification.<br>
1HNMR (CDCfe): 6 3.29 (s, 2H), 7.30-7.40 (m, 10H).<br>
Step 2.<br>
The oil obtained in Step 1 along with sodium azide (0.36 g, 5.5 mmol) and<br>
lithium chloride (0.32 g, 7.5 mmol) in DMF (20 ml) were stirred at 80°C under<br>
nitrogen for 24 hours, cooled, water (20 ml) was added, and the mixture was<br>
extracted with ether (3 * 20 ml). The combined etherate solution was washed with<br>
water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. After removal of the<br>
solvent in vacuo, the residue was purified by chromatography on silica gel<br>
(dichloromethane-hexane 1 :2 as eluent). A colorless oil (0.64 g) was obtained.<br>
Infrared spectra showed a strong absorption at 2100 cm-1.<br>
 1HNMR (CDCl3): 5 2.91 (s, 2H), 4.02 (s, 2H), 7.27-7.45 (m, 10 H).<br>
13CNMR (CDCl3): 'HNMR (CDCl3). 5 60.4, 78.2, 126.3,127.8,128.5, 143.8.<br>
Step 3.<br>
The 2-azido-l,l-diphenylmethanol obtained in Step 2 (60 mg, 0.61 mmol),<br>
 thionyl chloride (0.2 ml) and pyridine (2 ml) were refluxed for 2 hours. After being<br>
cooled, water (10 ml) was added carefully into the reaction mixture under ice-water<br>
cooling, and extracted with ether (3 x 5 ml). The combined etnerate solution was<br>
washed with 4 M hydrochloric acid, water and brine, dried over anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulfate, and filtered. After removal of the solvent, a yellow oil (120 mg)<br>
was obtained. Infrared spectra showed strong absorption at 2097 cm-1. 1HNMR<br>
showed that the resulted product was pretty pure 2-azido-l, 1-diphenyl ethylene.<br>
1HNMR(CDCl3): 8 6.69 (s, 1H), 7.38-7.42 (m, 10H).<br>
Step 4.<br>
To the 2-azido-l,l-diphenyI ethylene prepared in Step 3 in dry toluene (5 ml)<br>
was added triphenylphosphine (157 mg, 0.6 mmol) at room temperature under<br>
nitrogen. After 0.5 hour stirring, 9,10-phenanthrene-9,10-dione (104 mg, 0.5 mmol)<br>
was added. The mixture was heated at 80oC overnight. Photochromic product was<br>
obtained by chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane-hexane 1 :1 as eluent)<br>
and re-crystallized from dichloromethane/hexane, as pale yellow crystal (45 mg).<br>
'HNMR (CDCl3): d 7.24-7.29 (m, 6H), 7.46-7.70 (m, 8H), 8.12 (s, 1H), 8.43-8.52<br>
(m, 1H), 8.53-8.62 (m, 3H).<br>
13CNMR (CDCl3): d 79.5,122.5, 122.7, 122.8, 123.0, 125.1, 126.9, 126.9, 127.1,<br>
127.3, 127.6, 128.4, 128.6, 129.8, 131.3, 128.0, 141.4, 155.7.<br>
Example 3<br>
Step1.<br>
To a stirred suspension of sodium hydride (95%, 0.507 g, 20 mmol) in THF<br>
(15 ml) was added 2-3 ml a solution of triethylphosphono acetate (4.48 g, 20 mmol)<br>
in THF (20 ml). A tiny drop of ethanol was added to initialize the reaction, then the<br>
rest of the triethylphosphono acetate solution was added dropwise under ice-water<br>
cooling over 40 minutes. After 15 minutes of stirring, the reaction mixture was<br>
 transferred into a dropping runnel and added dropwise to a boiling solution of 4-<br>
methoxybenzophenone (4.38 g, 20 mmol) in THF (20 ml). After 24 hours reflux,<br>
most of the solvent was removed. To the cooled residue was added a saturated<br>
solution of aqueous sodium chloride (20 ml) and extracted with dichloromethane.<br>
Removal of dichloromethane gave a pale yellow oil (5.42 g) containing mostly (E)<br>
 and (Z)-3-p-methoxyphenyl-3-phenyl-acryIic acid ethyl ester as characterized by .<br>
'HNMR and which was used directly in Step 2 without further purification.<br>
Step 2.<br>
The oil obtained in Step 1 was hydrolyzed in a solution of KOH (5.07 g,<br>
methanol (30 ml)} under reflux for 1 hour. The cooled reaction mixture was poured<br>
into ice-water, acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid until the pH was 
extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 20 ml). The combined organic solution was dried<br>
over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solvent was removed, the residue was re-<br>
crystalliized from ethyl acetate/hexane and a white solid was obtained. The mother<br>
liquid was subjected to chromatography and re-crystallization. A total of 3.826 g<br>
desired product was obtained as white solid and 0.677 g unreacted ketone was<br>
recovered (yield: 75.3%). 1HNMR showed that the recovered product to be a<br>
mixture of (E)- and (Z)-3-p-methoxyphenyl-3-phenyl-acrylic acid.<br>
Step 3.<br>
The procedure of Step 3 of Example 1 was repeated except that 3-p-<br>
methoxyphenyJ-3-phenyl-acrylic acid (254.5 mg, 1 mmol) was used instead of 3,3-<br>
 diphenyl-acrylic acid to react with 9,10-phenanthrene quinone (44 mg, 0.21 mmol)<br>
and triphenyl arsen oxide (5 mg). Work-up gave 23.5 mg desired photochromic<br>
oxazine as yellow crystal (yield : 5.66%).<br>

Example 4<br>
Step 1.<br>
A mixture of anisole (11.9 g, 0.11 mole) and p-fluorobenzoyl chloride (97%,<br>
16.34 g, 0.1 mole) in dichloromethane (50 ml) was added aluminum chloride (14.67<br>
g, 0 11 mole) in small portions with stirring under ice-water cooling. After addition,<br>
the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, poured into a<br>
mixture of crushed ice (400 g) and hydrochloric acid (20 ml), and stirred until the<br>
orange color discharged. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane, dried<br>
over sodium sulfate, passed through a short silica gel column and washed with<br>
dichloromethane. Solvent was removed, the residue was re-crystallized from<br>
dichloromethane-hexane, 21.96 g colorless crystal was obtained (yield: 95.4%).<br>
1HNMR showed the product to have a structure consistent with p-fluorophenyl-p-<br>
methoxyphenyl ketone.<br>
1HNMR (CDCI3): d 3.89 (s, 3H), 6.97 (d, 2H, J = 8.7 Hz), 7.13 (dd, 2H, J = 8.7 Hz),<br>
7.76-7.84 (m,4H).<br>
Step 2.<br>
The procedure of Step 1 of Example 1 was repeated except that p-<br>
fluorophenyl-p-methoxyphenyl ketone (4.60 g, 20 mmol) was used instead of<br>
 benzophenone and the reaction time was 48 hours. The resulting oil contained<br>
mostly (E) and (Z)3-p-fluorophenyl-3-p-methoxyphenyl acrylic acid ethyl ester<br>
which was used in Step 3 without further purification.<br>
Step 3.<br>
The oil obtained in Step 2 was hydrolyzed in a mixture of KOH (5.2 g) and<br>
methanol (30 ml) for 80 minutes, cooled, and solvent was removed in vacuo. Water<br>
(30 ml) was added, the mixture filtered with suction, and washed with water. The<br>
filtrate was extracted with ether (15 ml) and the aqueous layer was separated and<br>
acidified with 4 M hydrochloric acid until the pH was 
by filtration and re-crystallized from dichloromethanotiexane, 4.8 g white crystal<br>
was obtained (yield: 88.1 %). 1HNMR showed the recovered product to have ,<br>
structure consistent with a mixture of (E) and (Z) 3-p-fluorophenyl-p-<br>
methoxyphenyl-acrylic acid.<br>
Step 3.<br>
The procedure of Step 3 of Example 1 was repeated except that 3-p-<br>
fluoropbenyl-p-methoxyphenyl-acrylic acid (272.5 mg, 1 mmol) was used instead of<br>
3,3-diphenyJ-acryJic acid to react with 9,10-phenanthrene quinone (60 mg, 28.8<br>
mmol) and triphenyl arsen oxide (5 mg). Work-up gave 75 mg desired<br>
photochromic oxazine as yellow crystal (yield : 17.3%).<br>

Example 5<br>
Step 1.<br>
To a stirred suspension of sodium hydride (0.48g, 20 mmol) in dry THF (20<br>
 ml) was added dropwise a solution of triethyl phosphonoaetate (4.48g, 20 mmol) in<br>
dry THF (25 ml) under nitrogen with ice-water bath cooling. After 40 minutes, the<br>
solution was transferred to a dropping runnel, added dropwise to a refluxing solution<br>
of bis (p-methoxyphenyl) ketone in dry THF (20 ml) over 20 minutes. The reaction<br>
mixture was refluxed for 48 hours and was then hydrolyzed with a saturated sodium<br>
 chloride solution (40 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with ether (3 x 70 ml).<br>
The combined organic extracts were dried, filtered and concentrated to afford a<br>
residue which was purified by chromatography eluting with<br>
methylenechloride/hexane (1 : 2). Colorless oil (4.23 g) was obtained (yield: 67.8%).<br>
1HNMR showed that the recovered product to have structure consistent with 3,3-<br>
bis(p-methoxyphenyl)-acrylic acid ethyl ester<br>

Step 2<br>
The 3,3-bis(p-methoxyphenyI)-acrylic acid ethyl ester (4.23 g, 13.5 mmol)<br>
obtained in Step 1 was hydrolyzed in 22 ml methanol in the presence of potassium<br>
hydroxide (3.7 g, 66 mmol) for 1 hour under reflux. The cooled reaction mixture<br>
was poured into ice-water (50 ml), acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid until the<br>
pH was 
from ethylacetate/hexane. White solid (3.6 g) was obtained (yield: 93.78%).<br>
1HNMR showed the recovered product to have a structure consistent with 3,3-bis(p-<br>
methoxyphenyl)-acryiic acid.<br>

Step 3.<br>
The procedure of Step 3 of Example 1 was repeated except that 3,3-bis(p-<br>
methoxyphenyl)-acrylic acid (284.3 mg, 1 mmol) was used instead of 3,3-diphenyl-<br>
 acrylic acid to react with 9,10-phenanthrene quinone (43 mg, 0.2 mmol) and<br>
triphenyl arsen oxide (5 mg). Work-up gave 8 mg desired photochromic oxazine as<br>

Example 6<br>
The oxazine compounds produced in Examples 1, 3, 4, and 5 were dissolved<br>
in organic solvent, then exposed to UV irradiation at 365 nm for 15 seconds. The<br>
solutions each developed an intense coloration and then lost the color once the UV<br>
radiation was discontinued. The maximum absorption in the visible regions are<br>
given in the Table below. The typical absorption has two bands. A strong<br>
absorption around 450-490 nm depends on the structure of photochrome and<br>
solvent, together with a weaker absorption at longer wavelength which is<br>
approximately 100 nm longer.<br>
