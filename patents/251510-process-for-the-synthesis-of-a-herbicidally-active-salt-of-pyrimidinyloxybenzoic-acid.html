PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>

FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for synthesis of a herbicidally active salt of<br>

9<br><br><br>
wherein M+ is as defined herein<br>
The invention provides a process for synthesis of salts of pyrimidinyloxy benzoic acid in high yields. The synthesized salt is herbicidally active and can be directly used in spray compositions for killing weeds. The process of invention involves condensation reaction between a hydroxy substituted benzoic acid and a pyrimidine. Advantageously, a diyhydoxy benzoic acid such as 2,6 dihydroxy benzoic acid is used for the condensation reaction. The condensation reaction is usually carried out in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. The phase transfer catalyst is selected from quaternary ammonium salts, polyethylene glycols, crown ethers and related chemical moieties. Advantageously, tetra butylammonium bromide is used as the phase transfer catalyst.<br>
The process of the invention is carried out at a pKa in the range of 7.5 to 9.0. The pKa is controlled and maintained in this range by suitably selecting the quantity of the solvent, reactants and the base used for the reaction. An alkali metal such as sodium metal, potassium metal or an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, an organic amine such as triethylamine or pyridine or an alkoxide such as sodium<br>
10<br><br>
methoxide or potassium t-butoxide can be used as the base for the reaction. Advantageously, an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide is used as the base. Usually, sodium hydroxide is used in the prill form. A hydrocarbon solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene, a ketone solvent like acetone, methylethylketone, or an aprotic polar solvent like dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile or water or a mixture thereof may be used or an alcohol solvent like methanol, ethanol or ether solvent like dioxane or tetrahydrofuran may be used or chlorinated solvent like methylene dichloride, ethylenedichloride may be used as the solvent for the reaction. Typically the organic solvent is taken in a quantity of 4-5 litres per mole of any of the reactants. The process of the invention is usually carried out in a single stage.<br>
The invention also provides a herbicidally active salt of pyrimidinyloxy benzoic acid. The salt can be an alkali metal salt such as a sodium salt or a potassium salt or an ammonium salt. The salt is usually obtained in high yields of above 72%. The salt is used to prepare herbicidal composition for killing weeds in an agricultural field. The compositions are usually prepared from the salt, in herbicidally effective amounts. The compositions can be formed into granules, powders, concentrates and can contain a carrier, adjuvant, a dispersing agent or a surfactant. The proportion of the salt in the composition can vary depending upon the application method, the application site etc. The composition is usually applied in the form of a spray.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by way of the following non limiting examples.<br>
11<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of sodium salt of 2,6-bis(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy) benzoic acid<br>
at a pKa in the range of 6.0 to 6.5<br>
In a clean and dry flask, 1.54 g of 2,6-dihydroxy benzoic acid and 0.060 g of tetra butyl ammonium bromide as phase transfer catalyst was taken along with toluene solvent. 0.6 g of sodium hydroxide in fine prill form was added while stirring at reflux temperature for 1- 5 hrs to bring the pKa of the reaction mass to about 6.0 to 6.5 and then 2-methylsulfonyl-4,6-dimethoxy pyrimidine was added and the mixture further reacted with stirring for 12 to 18 hours to obtain the salt of 2,6-bis(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy ) benzoic acid. The reaction mass was filtered to recover the unreacted raw material and washed and dried to obtain the purified product. The salt was obtained in yield of 10%.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Preparation of sodium salt of 2,6-bis(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy ) benzoic acid<br>
at a pKa in the range of 7.5 to 9.0<br>
In a clean and dry flask 1.54 g of 2,6-dihydroxy benzoic acid and 0.060 g of tetra butyl ammonium bromide as phase transfer catalyst was taken along with toluene solvent. 1.2 g of sodium hydroxide in fine prill form was added while stirring and maintaining the temperature at 80°C for 1 to 5 hrs to bring the pKa of the reaction mass in the range of 7.5 to 9.0 and then 2-methylsulfonyl-4, 6-dimethoxy pyrimidine was added and the mixture further reacted with stirring for 12 to 18 hours to obtain the salt of 2,6-bis(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy) benzoic acid. The reaction mass was filtered to recover the<br>
12<br><br>
unreacted raw material and washed and dried to obtain the purified product. A high yield of the product was obtained ( 75 % ). The purified product was dissolved in water to get a known concentration which is suitable for spray application.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Preparation of sodium salt of 2,6-bis(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy ) benzoic acid<br>
at a pKa in the range of 10.0 to 10.5<br>
In a clean and dry flask 1.54 g of 2, 6-dihydroxy benzoic acid and 0.060 g of tetra butyl ammonium bromide as phase transfer catalyst was taken along with toluene solvent. 1.8 g of sodium hydroxide in fine prill form was added while stirring at reflux temperature for 1- 5 hrs to bring the pKa of the reaction mass to about 10.0 tol0.5 and then 2-methylsulfonyl-4, 6-dimethoxy pyrimidine was added and the mixture further reacted with stirring for 12 to 18 hours to get the salt of 2,6-bis (4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy ) benzoic acid. The reaction mass was filtered to recover the unreacted raw material and washed and dried to obtain the purified product.<br>
As discussed in the foregoing, the process of the invention (as exemplified by Example 2 ), wherein the pKa in the range of 7.5 to 9.0 is maintained, results in pyrimidynyloxy benzoic acid salt in high yield of 75%. At pKa values higher than 9.0 (as employed in the experiment of example 3) or at a pKa value lower than 7.5 (as employed in the experiment of example 1), the yield of the salt is substantially lower. Higher yields would result in increased productivity, easier isolation and lesser purification procedures.<br>
13<br><br>
Further, in the process of the invention the reactants are recycled and reused. Thus, there is savings in the cost and the overall efficiency is improved.<br>
The above description is illustrative only and is not limiting- The invention is defined by the claims that follow and their full range of equivalents.<br>
