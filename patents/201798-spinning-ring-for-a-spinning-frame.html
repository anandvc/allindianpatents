The invention relates to a spinning ring for a ring spinning frame with an intemally positioned support ring, whereat the spinning ring on its inner side comprises a ring supporting surface, by which surface a support ring is being supported by means of its supporting surface.<br>
A spinning ring of this type is disclosed in the European patent application 0 020 365, wherein several embodiments of support rings are being described. A support ring within a spinning ring on one hand serves to keep the traveller at a minimum height at standstill of the spinning frame, on the other hand it should help to prevent unthreading of the yam from the traveller.<br>
Support rings on spinning rings according to the known art, said support rings, together with the spinning ring are being screwed onto a ring rail of the spinning frame, whereat the support ring serves as support for the spinning ring. Under imfavourable circumstances and due to inappropriate handling of the screw joint it can happen that the spinning ring is being deformed to an unacceptable extent.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a spinning ring with a support ring where said disadvantage is being avoided.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spinning ring for a ring spinning frame with an intemally positioned support ring, characterized in that the spinning ring on its inner side comprises a ring supporting surface, as well as a ring centering surface by which surfaces a support ring is being supported by means of a supporting surface or a centering surface respectively, whereat the ring supporting surface is of concave or convex shape and correspondingly the supporting surfaces on the support ring are being made convex or concave, whereby the support ring is being kept form closed in all directions by the spinning ring.<br><br>
Said task is being solved by a ring according to the characteristic features of the embodiments described in detail by way of the figure in the following.<br>
In the figure only the bottom part 12 of the spinning ring 10 is being shown. Above said bottom part a traveller part extends vertically or at an angle upwards towards the right side. The spinning ring itself rests, by way of a ring rail resting surface 12c on the not shown ring rail or on a ring holder. Corresponding with the ring rail resting surface 12c the support ring 20 as well is being provided with a resting surface 20c at its lower inner side. The support ring resting surface 20c projects downwards beyond the remaining portion of the support ring 20 located radially further outward, by approximately 0.1-0.4mm. The dimensions on the support ring 20 between the support ring resting surface 20c and the support ring supporting surface 22a or the ring supporting surfaces 12a respectively, are chosen in such a way that the support ring 20 after fitting into the spinning ring 10 projects downwards by 5/100 to 1/10 mm compared to the ring resting surface 12c, so that the combination spinning ring/support ring 10, 20 while it is being positioned on the fastening part in the ring spinning frame, at first there is only contact within the section of the support ring resting surface 20c with the base. Due to the excess measurement of the support ring 20 of 5/100 to 1/10 mm the spinning ring resting surface or the ring rail resting surface 12c respectively, has a clearance towards the base surface. After fastening of a screwed connection, holding the spinning ring on the base, the spinning ring rests within the section 12c on said base so that the support ring 20 has to deform itself, which results in a controlled pressure of the support ring resting surface 20c onto the base. This results in a good sealing effect against fly, which otherwise could build up within this section if there were a gap.<br>
On the inside of the bottom part 12 of the spinning ring 10 a ring centering surface 12b is being provided, which is preferably being made conically and<br><br>
which widens in downward direction. Also on said inner side, a ring supporting surface 12a is being arranged, which in the exemplified embodiment is made as a concave surface, preferably as a ring torus surface. The support ring 20 is being formed likewise on its outside. Said support ring 20 rests by means of a supporting surface 22a within the supporting surface 12a of the spinning ring and further by means of the centering surface 22b, also preferably made conically, it is being centered within the spinning ring 10. Corresponding with the concave supporting surface 12a of the ring, the supporting surface 22a of the support ring 20 is being formed analogous, in the shown example in the figure as a circular torus surface.<br>
Generally expressed, the support ring 20 with the spinning ring 10, is brought into a defined position by way of a centring ring and due to a snap connection it is being fixedly fitted, whereby a shoulder surface 14 on the spinning ring 10 and a resting surface 24 on the support ring 20 result. The support ring 20 is thus being kept in the spinning ring between a resting surface 24 and a supporting surface 22a. The support ring 20 is made of plastic, preferably Polyoxymethelene, glass bead reinforced (POM GB 10), while the spinning ring 10 is made of special steel. This enables to press the supporting ring 20 into the spinning ring 10 without a permanent deformation, where it remains until an exchange of the support ring 20 or the spinning ring is required due to wear. Spinning ring 10 and support ring 20, or parts of them, are being screwed onto the spinning frame in a larger number in form of pre-assembled units.<br>
In comparison with a conventional design of a spinning ring-support ring combination the suggested embodiment possesses the advantage of more precise positioning, simple assembly, low tendency for contamination and low manufacturing costs.<br><br>
In contrast to the exemplified embodiment, where the ring supporting surface 12a is concave and the supporting surface 22a on the support ring 20 is convex, the surfaces can also be of vice versa design, so that the support ring 20 in place of the position 22a is being provided with a recess and the spinning ring 10 correspondingly engages with a projection into the recess and thus holds the support ring 20.<br>
The supporting surface 12a, 22a are to be designed in such a way that the support ring 20 is being held in form closed manner in all directions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
