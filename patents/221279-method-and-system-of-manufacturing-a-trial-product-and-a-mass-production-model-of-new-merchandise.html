This mail server 61 transmits and receives electronic mails with the client according to the application program called MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) 62. The mail server 61 also transfers the electronic mails to other mail servers which are not shown in the figures. The mail server 61 also stores the received electronic mails temporarily in a mail spool 63.<br>
Operation of the first embodiment will be described here while referring to the flowcharts shown in Fig. 4 to Fig. 12. The planing period to the sales period shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 correspond to the corresponding periods shown in Fig. 2. At step SA1 shown in Fig. 4 , the merchandise maker 1 and the publisher 2 mutually negotiate and determine the merchandise to be planned and developed (in the case, the watch). At step SA2, the merchandise maker 1 and the publisher 2 determine the target of selling the* merchandise in consideration of the characteristics of the merchandise and marketing results. In this case, it is supposed that the selected targets are young office working men in the age group of 25 to 35 years, with full of individuality and sensibility.<br>
At step SA3, the merchandise maker 1 and the publisher 2 set up the concept of the merchandise. Among the key words characterizing the young office working men, such as creativity,<br><br>
positiveness, recklessness, and freedom, suppose the concept of high spirit is selected. At step SA4, the merchandise maker 1 and the publisher 2 determine, on the basis of the merchandise, targets, concept, etc., the notice method to the customers 3i to 3n, and the preview, including the merchandise design, specification, price setting, sales method, and other details of planning.<br>
At step SA5 , the publisher 2 builds up a system for executing the plan determined at step SA4 . Precisely, the publisher 2 sets up the WWW server 33 , news server 35 , and others , and develops a program for realizing the home page 5. On the other hand, the merchandise maker 1 prepares the design as the preview by' the CAD device 56. The design data is transferred through the Internet 20, and is incorporated into the HTML file operating on the WWW server 33.<br>
Parallel to system build-up at step SA5, at step SA6, the publication 4 including an article announcing the plan is manufactured by the publisher 2. This article includes the merchandise concept, planning method, schedule, preview, URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the home page 5 and other information. At step SA7, the plan is noticed to the customers 3i to 3n.<br>
That is, the plan is noticed by selling the publication 4 and opening the home page 5. The home page 5 shows the merchandise concept, planning method, schedule, preview design,<br><br>
etc. The reader reading the article in the publication 4 recognizes the URL of the home page 5, and can access the home page 5.<br>
At step SA8, the WWW server 33 (merchandise maker 1 and<br>
publisher 2) judges if the preset customer needs survey period<br>
(see Fig. 2) is terminated or not, and in this case the result<br>
of judgement is NO. As a result, the process from step SA9 to<br>
step SA11 is executed parallel.<br>
Herein, the inquiry process at step SA9 is the process of inquiring the customers accessing the home page 5 about the information of merchandise development. The electronic bulletin board process at step SA10 is the process for writing or looking up the electronic bulletin board opened by the news server 35 . Themail process at step SA11 is the process of sending and receiving electronic mails among the customers 3i to 3n, the merchandise maker 1, and the publisher 2, by utilizing the function of the mail server 61.<br>
Suppose that the client 3i has browsed the home page 5. That is, when the WWW browser Hi is started, the customer client 10i accesses the WWW server 33 through the modem 13i, the Internet 20, router 30, firewall 31, and LAN 32 according to the URL entered by the customer 3i. As a result, the home page 5 appears on the display (not shown) of the customer client 10i.<br>
The home page 5 shows the version X trial product notice screen GXas thepreview show, for example, inFig. 13A, inaddition<br><br>

The reservation status confirm screen Gie shows a pie chart of composition ratio of profiles about the subscribers of merchandise A (including customized merchandise) and merchandiseB (includingcustomizedmerchandise) . The customer refers to these profiles, understands the trend of sales target<br><br>
of merchandise A and merchandise B, and judges whether or not to buy.  The pie chart of profiles is displayed on the basis of profiles of reservation information table J (see Fig. 40) described later.<br>
Herein, when the reserve button 126 is pressed by manipulation of the customer 3X, the WWW server 33 makes a judgment of YES at step SK3. At step SK4, the WWW server 33 displays the reservation acceptance screen G12 which is the reservation acceptance form shown in Fig. 33, on the display of the customer client 10i. In the reservation acceptance screen Gi2 shown in Fig. 33, theparts corresponding to those inFig. 21 are identified with the same legends.<br>
The reservation acceptance screen G12 newly shows a profile selector 125 for selecting and entering the subscriber* s profile<br>
(see Fig. 39) , a customized merchandise name display 114 for displaying the name (in the diagram, customized merchandise Ai'<br>
(green)) of customized merchandise (see Fig. 32, Fig. 36), a reserved quantity display 115 for displaying the number of reservations of the merchandise, and a merchandise delivery method selector 116 for selecting the delivery method of reserved merchandise (sales representative or cash on delivery).  The<br>
customer 3i enters the information necessary for reservation. Returning-to Fig. 29, atstepSK5, the WWW server 33 judges<br>
if a clear button 87 shown in Fig. 33 is pressed or not.  This<br>
clear button 87 is pressed when clearing the input data of the<br><br>
reservation acceptance screen G12. If a judgment made at this step is YES, then at step SK8 the WWW server 33 clears the input data of the reservation acceptance screen G12, and returns to the process in the main routine shown in Fig. 27.<br>
If a judgment made at step SK5 is NO, then at step SK6 the WWW server 33 judges if the send button 86 shown in Fig. 33 is pressed or not. In this case, the WWW server 33 makes a judgment of NO. However, if the send button 8 6 is pressed by manipulation of the customer 3i, the WWW server 33 makes a judgment of YES at step SK6 . At step SK7, the WWW server 33 stores the information entered in the reservation acceptance screen G12 in the memory device 34 as the reservation information table J shown in Fig. 40.<br>
The reservation information table Jhas fields for reserved quantity data, reserved date, name of subscriber, profile, address, flag showing customizedmerchandise or not, customizing parts, merchandise name, quantity, delivery method, sales representative, and selling price. In the field of the sales representative, when the sales representative is selected in the merchandise delivery method selector 116 shown in Fig. 33, the sales representative nearest to the address of the subscriber is automatically set by the WWW server 33 among the preset sales representatives 90i to 90n. If the cash on delivery is selected in the merchandise delivery method selector 116, no information is stored in the f ieldof the sales representative .  Hereinafter,<br><br>
the same operation is repeated until the expiration of the reservation acceptance period.<br>
When the reservation acceptance period expires, the WWW server 33 makes a judgment of YES at step SI27 shown in Fig. 27. As a result, at step SI32, the WWW server 33, same as the process at step SA28 (seeFig. 5) explained in the first embodiment, executes the selling price final decision process for finally determining the selling price depending on the number of reservations. In this case, the WWW server 33 stores the determined selling price in the reservation information table J (see Fig. 40). In this case, the selling price of the merchandise A is 25000 yen, and the selling price of the merchandise B is 45000 yen.<br>
At step SI33, the WWW server 33 informs the subscribers of the merchandise information (finally determined price, specification, design, etc.) through the home page 5. At step SI34, the WWW server 33 sends the reservation information table J stored in the memory device 34 to the job server 57 at the side of the merchandise maker 1 through the Internet 20. As a result, the merchandise maker 1 starts manufacture of the merchandise A and merchandise B (both including customized merchandise) on the basis of the reservation information table J (see Fig. 40) . The customized merchandise is manufactured by referring to the field of the customizing parts in the reservation information table J.<br><br>
At step SI35, the job server 57 sends the reservation information table J (see Fig. 40) to the sales representative clients 100i to 100n through the Internet 20. As a result, the sales representatives 90i to 90n, referring to the field of the sales representative in the reservation information table J, can obtain the information of merchandise to be handled and the information of customers. At step SI36, the merchandise maker 1 ships the merchandise to the sales representatives 90i to 90n according to the reservation information table J.<br>
At step SI37, the merchandise maker 1 and the sales representatives 90x to 90n judge if reaching the sales day of the merchandise A and merchandise B (both including customized merchandise) . In this case, the judgment made will be NO and the same step will be repeated till the day is the sales day. When the day is the sales day, the merchandise maker 1 and the sales representatives 90i to 90n make a judgment of YES at step SI37. As a result, the process at step SI38 and step SI39 is executed parallel.<br>
That is, at step SI38 , the merchandise maker 1, referring to the reservation information table J shown in Fig. 40, ship/S the merchandise A and merchandise B (both including customized merchandise) by cash on delivery to the subscribers not listed in the field of the sales representatives in the sequence of reservations. On the other hand, the sales representatives 90i to 90n, referring to the reservation information table J, sell<br><br>
the merchandise to the subscribers listed in the field of the own sales representative, and remit the corresponding amount of money to the bank account of the merchandise maker 1. At step SI39, by the same technique as in step SA9 (see Fig. 4) , the reaction of the customers after sales of merchandise is investigated.<br>
At step SI40, the merchandise maker 1 judges if the number of productions of the merchandise A and merchandise B (both including customized merchandise) is equal to the number of reservations, or not. In this case, the merchandise maker 1 makes a judgment of NO. At step SI42, the merchandise make 1 judges if the sales period is terminated or not. In this case, the merchandise maker 1 makes a judgment of NO. Thereafter, the merchandise A and merchandise B (both including customized merchandise) are being sold.<br>
When the judgment made at step SI40 is YES, then at step SI41 the merchandise maker 1 understands that the number of productions has reached the number of reservations, and stops manufacture of the merchandise A and merchandise B (both including customized merchandise) . When the judgment made at step SI42 is YES, then at step SI43, it is judged if the reaction investigation period is terminated or not. If the judgment made at step SI42 is NO, then at step SI44 the reaction investigation period continues in the same manner as at step SI39.<br>
When the judgment made at step SI43 is YES, then at step<br><br>
SI45 the merchandise maker 1 and the publisher 2 sum up and analyze the results of reaction investigation, and evaluate comprehensively about the series of operation from planning and/or development of merchandise to sales. At step SI46, the merchandise maker 1 and the publisher 2 feed back the result of overall evaluation to planning and development of next merchandise.<br>
In this the second embodiment, at step SI32 shown in Fig. 27 (selling price final decision process) , the selling price is determined in gradual steps depending on the number of reservations, but not limited to this, for example, the selling price may be determined based on four cases of selling price final decision logic. These four cases will be explained below as modified examples 1 to 4 of the second embodiment.<br>
In the modified example 1, the selling price of the merchandise is decided based on the selling price final decision logic Hi shown in Fig. 41A. In this selling price final decision logic Hi, during the reservation acceptance period at step SI27 shown in Fig. 27, the selling price is determined in gradual steps on the first-come-first-served basis of reservations. Precisely, the price is 20000 yen for first to 3000th customers, 25000 yen for 3001st to 6000th customers, and 30000 yen for 6001st and later customers.  In this modified example 1, at step SI32<br>
(see Fig. 27) , the selling price final decision process shown<br>
in Fig. 42 is executed.<br><br>
That is, at step SMI shown in the diagram, the WWW server 33 refers to the reservation information table J (see Fig. 40) , and reads out the reserved quantity data r of the first record. This reserved quantity data r is the data showing the reservation incoming order of the merchandise. At step SM2, the WWW server 33 judges if the reserved quantity data r is in a range of 1 to 3000 customers (see Fig. 41A).<br>
If the judgment made is YES, then at step SM7 the WWW server 33 sets the selling price at 20000 yen (see Fig. 41A) . At step SM5, the WWW server 33 stores the selling price (20000 yen) in the corresponding record of the reservation information table J. At step SM6 , the WWW server 33 j udges if the price is determined for all reserved merchandise. Assume that the judgment made at step SM6 is NO. Accordingly, the entire operation shown in this flowchart- is repeated until the price is decided.<br>
If the judgment made at step SM2 is NO, then at step SM3 the WWW server 33 judges if the reserved quantity data r is in a range of 3001 to 6000 customers . If the judgment made at this step is YES, then at step SM8 the WWW server 33 sets the selling price at 25000 yen (see Fig. 41A) . If the judgment made at step SM3 is NO, that is, if the reserved quantity data r is 6001 or more, at step SM4, the WWW server 33 sets the selling price at 30000 yen.<br>
In the modified example 2, the selling price of the merchandise is decided based on to the selling price final<br><br>
decision logic H2, during the reservation acceptance period at step SI27 shown in Fig. 27, the selling price is determined in gradual steps according to the reservation timing. Specifically, it is 20000 yen if reserved from March 1 (reservation start day) till March 31, 25000 yen if reserved from April 1 till April 30, and 30000 yen if reserved on May 1 and after. In this modified example 2, at step SI32 (see Fig. 27) , the selling price final decision process shown in Fig. 43 is executed.<br>
That is, at step SL1 shown in the diagram, the WWW server 33 refers to the reservation information table J (see Fig. 40) , and reads out the reserved date data t of the first record. This reserved date data t is the data showing the reservation date of the merchandise. At step SL2, the WWW server 33 judges if the reserved date data t is in a range of March 1 to March 31.<br>
If the judgment made at step SL2 is YES, then at step SL7 the WWW server 33 sets the selling price at 20000 yen (see Fig. 41B) . At step SL5, the WWW server 33 stores the selling price (20000 yen) in the corresponding record of the reservation information table J. At step SL6, the WWW server 33 judges if the price is determined for all reserved merchandise. Assume that the judgment made at step SL6 is NO. Accordingly, the entire operation shown in this flowchart is repeated until the price is decided.<br><br>
If the judgment made at step SL2 is NO, then at step SL3 the WWW server 33 judges if the reserved date data t is in a range of April 1 to April 30. If the judgment made at step SL2 is YES, then at step SL8 the WWW server 33 sets the selling price at 25000 yen (see Fig. 41B) . If the judgment made at step SL3 is NO, that is, if the reserved date data t is May 1 or later, then at step SL4 the WWW server 33 sets the selling price at 30000 yen.<br>
In the modified example 3, the selling price of the merchandise is decided based on the selling price final decision logic H3 shown in Fig. 44A. In this selling price final decision logic H3, during the reservation acceptance period at step SI27 shown in Fig. 27, the discount rate of the fixed price of the merchandise is determined in gradual steps on the first-come-first-served basis of reservations. Specifically, the discount rate is 30% for first to 3000th customers, 20% for 3001st to 6000th customers, and 0% (fixed price) for 6001st and later customers. In this modified example 3, at step SI32 (see Fig. 27) , the selling price final decision process shown in Fig. 45 is executed.<br>
That is, at step SOI shown in the diagram, the WWW server 33 refers to the reservation information table J (see Fig. 40) , and reads out the reserved quantity data r of the first record. At step S02, the WWW server 33 judges if the reserved quantity data r is in a range of 1 to 3000 customers (see Fig. 44A) .  If<br><br>
the judgment made at step S02 is YES, then at step S08 the WWW server 33 sets the discount rate at 30% (see Fig. 44A) . At step S05 , the WWW server 33 calculates the selling price (fixed price x (1-0 . 3) ) by applying the discount rate (30%) to the f ixedprice .<br>
At step S06 , the WWW server 33 stores the data of the selling price (at the discount rate of 30%) in the corresponding record of the reservation information table J. At step S07, the WWW server 33 judges if the price is determined for all reserved merchandise. Assume that the judgment made at step S07 is NO. Accordingly, the entire operation shown in this flowchart is repeated until the price is decided.<br>
If the judgment made at step S02 is NO, then at step S03 the WWW server 33 judges if the reserved quantity data r is in a range of 3001 to 6000 customers. If the judgment made at step S03 is YES, then at step S09 the WWW server 33 sets the discount rate of the merchandise at 20%. At step S05, the WWW server 33 calculates the selling price (fixed price x (1-0.2)) by applying the discount rate (20%) to the fixed price. At step S06, the WWW server 33 stores the data of the selling price (at the discount rate of 20%) in the corresponding record of the reservation information table J.<br>
If the judgment made at step S03 is NO, that is, if the reserved quantity data r is 6001 or more, at step S04 , the WWW server 33 sets the discount rate at 0%. At step S05, the WWW server 33 calculates the selling price by applying the discount<br><br>
rate (0%) to the fixed price. In this case, the selling price is the fixed price. At step S06f the WWW server 33 stores the data of the selling price (= fixed price) in the corresponding record of the reservation information table J.<br>
In the modified example 4, the selling price of the merchandise is decided based on the selling price final decision logic H4 shown in Fig. 44B. In this selling price final decision logic H4/ if the reservation acceptance quantity is limited, for example, to 1000 pieces, during the reservation acceptance period at step SI27 shown in Fig. 27, the selling price is determined in gradual steps according to the time required from start of acceptance of reservation until the reservation of the limited 1000 pieces is completed (reservation sold-out time).<br>
Precisely, the selling price is 20000 yen if the reservation sold-out time is less than 5 minutes, 25000 yen if . sold out in 5 minutes to less than 10 minutes, and 30000 yen if sold out in 10 minutes or more. In this modified example 4, at step SI32 (see Fig. 27) , the selling price final decision process shown in Fig. 46 is executed.<br>
That is, in this modified example 4, the WWW server 33 starts up a not shown timer when acceptance of reservation is started, and stops the timer when the reservation quantity (for example, 1000 pieces) is sold out. In this case, at step SP1 shown in Fig. 46, the WWW server 33 reads out the timer counting result as the reservation sold-out time TR.  At step SP2, the<br><br>
WWW server 33 judges if the reservation sold-out time TR is less than 5 minutes or not. If the judgment made at step SP2 is YES, at step SP5, the WWW server 33 sets the selling price uniformly at 20000 yen (see Fig. 44B).<br>
On the other hand, If the judgment made at step SP2 is NO, then at step SP3 the WWW server 33 judges if the reservation sold-out time TR is in a range of 5 minutes to less than 10 minutes . If the judgment made at step SP3 is YES, then at step SP6, the WWW server 33 sets the selling price uniformly at 25000 yen (see Fig. 44B) . If the judgment made at step SP3 is NO, that is, when the reservation sold-out time TR is 10 minutes or more, the WWW server 33 sets the selling price uniformly at 30000 yen. The WWW server 33 stores the data of the determined selling price in each record of the reservation information table J (see Fig, 40) . Incidentally, the discount rate explained in the modified example 3 may be also applied to the modified examples 1, 2 and 4.<br>
Meanwhile, in the second embodiment, the selling price of the merchandise A and B may be decided based on the bidding system by auction. Such case is explained below as modified example 5 of the second embodiment. In this modified example 5, the WWW server 33 displays an auction bidding form screen G19 shown in Fig. 47 . By referring to this screen, each customer enters the personal information (name, kana, etc.) by using each client terminal, and enters the bidding amount for merchandise<br><br>
A in a bidding amount input column 127, and further enters the bidding amount for merchandise B in a bidding amount input column 128. A clear button 130 is pressed when correcting the input data. When a tender button 129 is pressed, the bidding amount data is collected by the WWW server 33, and the WWW server 33 stores the bidding amount data in the bidding table AC shown in Fig. 48.<br>
The WWW server 33 updates the data of the number of bids about the merchandise A and merchandise B at every new tender, and determines the average of bidding amount in every bidding amount price zone (for example, 1000 yen to 5000 yen) . At the tender closing time, at step SQ1 shown in Fig. 49 , the WWW server 33 reads out the bidding table AC. At step SQ2, the WWW server 33 searches the record of the greatest number of bids in the bidding table AC. In this case, the record of 317 bids is searched for merchandise A, and the record of 462 bids for merchandise B.<br>
At step SQ3, the WWW server 33 determines the average of the record as the selling price . In this case, the selling price of merchandise A is 18000 yen, and the selling price of merchandise B is 17000 yen. In the second embodiment, the highest bidding amount may be set as the selling price.<br>
According to the second embodiment, the merchandise planning and development information about planning and/or development of a plurality of new products (for example, shoes,<br><br>
bags, belts) on the basis of one concept may be noticed to many and unspecified customers through the Internet 20 by employing the technique mentioned above, and the opinion information may be collected from the customers. In this case, the enterprise planning and developing a plurality of new merchandise can understand the needs of customers according to the opinion information.<br>
Further, manufacture of the new merchandise recording the greatest number of reservations only can be decided, and manufacture of other new merchandise can be stopped, so that the thrilling sensation and interest of planning can be presented to the subscribers.<br>
