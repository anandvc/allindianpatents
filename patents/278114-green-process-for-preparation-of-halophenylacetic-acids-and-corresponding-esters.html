<br>
GREEN PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF HALOPHENYLACETIC ACIDS AND CORRESPONDING ESTERS<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
This invention generally relates to a process for halogenation of 2-halophenyl acetic acid ester as well as 2-halophenyl acetic acid and esterification thereof to yield corresponding alpha halo ester and particularly relates to preparation of methyl alpha- bromo-2-chlorophenylacetate.<br>
Discussion of prior art:<br>
Many a halo acids and a halo acids esters are widely used in chemical industry as intermediates for many important class of compounds including pharmaceuticals, dyes, pigments, agro chemicals, fine chemicals and specialty chemicals. One of the important a halo acids is a bromo phenyl acetic acid. Similarly one of the important a halo acid esters is a bromo phenyl acetic acid methyl ester.<br>
Out of the many esters of a bromo acids, methyl a-bromo-2-chlorophenylacetate is an important intermediate for Clopidogrel [113665-84-2]; an oral antiplatelet agent (thienopyridine class) used to inhibit blood clots in coronary artery disease, peripheral<br>
vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease.<br>

Many processes for the preparation of cc-bromo-2-chlorophenyl acetic acid and methyl a-bromo-2-chlorophenylacetate are cited in the literature. Some of patents cited are GB 1,277,578 equivalent to DE 1,933,629, US 6,358,971 equivalent to WO 99,59857, JP 2000/034256, US 5,374,656, US 5,189,170, US 5,036,156, US 6,124,343, WO 2007/126258, WO 9111999A1.<br>
Widely used method of preparation for a-bromo-2-chlorophenyl acetic acid and methyl a-bromo-2-chlorophenylacetate, is bromination of 2-chlorophenyl acetic acid and niethylation thereof as represented in Fig. 2. <br>

There are several drawbacks of existing methods like generation of large quantities of waste material, handling of liquid bromine which is highly hazardous to human beings as well as to the environment. Use of costly and hazardous catalysts like red phosphorous in some of the processes makes these processes unfriendly to the environment and also makes them uneconomical. Use of low temperature conditions during the reaction requires use of "ozone depleting" refrigerants. Use of photo- bromination in some of the existing methods requires specialized equipment.<br>
On^ of the major drawbacks of the existing methods is generation of large quantity of highly acidic effluent which requires a large facility for effluent treatment and disposal of wastes. These factors impose location related constraints making it mandatory for these processes to be carried out only in designated areas. In general exiting processes are non-green that harms the environment to a large extent, which has become the major global concern in today's chemical industry. <br>
Hence there is a need for providing a process which is green that avoids above mentioned disadvantages and drawbacks and provides an environmentally sustainable and economical process.<br>
Objects and Advantages of Invention:<br>
Accordingly different objects and advantages of the present invention are described below.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an environmentally friendly (green) process that overcomes the problem of generation of large quantities of acidic wastes resulting from the conventional processes.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process wherein side products formation is minimized, thereby reducing the generation of organic wastes and making the process greener.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process which will prevent generation of large quantity of highly acidic effluent which requires a large facility for effluent treatment and disposal of wastes, thereby imposing location related constraints making it mandatory for these processes to be carried out only in designated areas. <br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide environment - friendly (green) process that overcomes the problem of generation of large quantities of liquid wastes resulting from the conventional processes, since the process described in the present invention uses bromine releasing agent l,3-Dibromo-5,5-dimethylimidazolidine-2.4- dione (DBDMID) as brominating agent in place of liquid bromine, and recovers 5,5- dimethylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (DMID)which is a spent of brominating agent from the reaction mixture.<br>
The different advantages of this invention are described below:<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that excess methyl a-bromo-2- chlorophenylacetate is used as a medium for the reaction described in the present invention. Other solvents including methylene dichloride, ethylene dichloride and other chlorinated solvents alone and / or in combination thereof can also be used in the process of the present invention.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that the end product, which is methyl a-bromo-2-chlorophenylacetate, is purer because the side products formation is minimized, thereby making the impurity profile acceptable for further conversion into Clopidogrel.<br>
Yet other advantage of the present invention is that the end product, which is methyl a-bromo-2-chlorophenylacetate, is separated from the reaction mixture by distillation under reduced pressure; which is one of the green unit operations leading to minimum waste generation as well as requires lesser energy.<br>
Further advantage of the present invention is that 5,5-dimethylimidazolidine-2,4- dione (DMID) is recovered from the reaction mixture by crystallization by cooling which does not generate any waste streams.<br>
Further objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to the reader after going through the detailed description of invention. <br>

Following surprising advantages are observed by the inventor as a result of the process of the present invention:<br>
1.	It is an environmentally friendly (green) process that overcomes the problem of generation of large quantities of liquid wastes resulting from the conventional processes; since the process described in the present invention uses bromine releasing agent l,3-Dibromo-5,5-dimethylimidazolidine-2,4- dione (DBDMID) as brominating agent in place of liquid bromine; and recovers 5,5-dimethylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (DMID)which is a spent of brominating agent from the reaction mixture.<br>
2.	Acidic catalysts including tosicacid, mineral acids, resins, zeolites and /or combination of these can be used the in esterification.<br>
3.	Excess methyl a-bromo-2-chlorophenylacetate is used as a medium for the reaction described in the present invention. Other solvents including<br>
methylene dichloride, ethylene dichloride, and other chlorinated solvents alone and / or in combination thereof can also be used in the process of the present invention.<br>
4.	Molten 2-chloro-phenylacetic acid is used as a medium for the reaction described in the present invention. Other solvents including methylene dichloride, ethylene dichloride, and other chlorinated solvents alone and / or in combination thereof can also be used in the process of the present invention.<br>
5.	The end product, which is methyl a-bromo-2-chlorophenylacetate, is purer because the side products formation is minimized, thereby making the impurity profile acceptable for further conversion into Clopidogrel.<br>
6.	The end product, which is a-bromo-2-chlorophenylacetic acid, is purer because the side products formation is minimized, thereby making the impurity profile acceptable for further conversion into methyl a-bromo-2- chlorophenylacetate and Clopidogrel.<br>
7.	The end product, which is methyl a-bromo-2-chlorophenylacetate, is separated from the reaction mixture by distillation under reduced pressure; which is one of the green unit operations leading to minimum waste generation.<br>
8.	5,5-Dimethylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (DMID) is recovered from the reaction mixture by crystallization by cooling which does not generate any waste streams.<br>
