				<td>FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention generally relates to an improved method for de-phosphorisation of<br>
steel in an LD steel making converter. In particular it relates to a method for enhancing<br>
the mixing of molten metal for improved mass transfer by injecting the gas in differential<br>
flow pattern among the tuyeres.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Since the inception of basic oxygen steel making process into operation, this has been<br>
subjected to continuous development. One of the most important developments has been<br>
the introduction of combined blowing, where the refining achieved with the top oxygen<br>
lance augmented by the injection of inert gases such as argon and nitrogen from elements<br>
mounted in the base of the converter called tuyeres.<br>
The advantages of combined blowing can be fundamentally attributed to improved<br>
hydrodynamics within the bath as a result of far better mixing and improved agitation in<br>
the converter.<br>
The chronological change in number of the bottom tuyeres is found to enhance mixing<br>
starting from a single concentric bottom tuyeres to as high as eight number of bottom<br>
tuyeres. In conventional practice, the flow rate among the tuyeres is kept uniform besides<br>
optimizing the radial placement of the set of tuyeres and an increase in total gas flow rate<br>
through them during the course of a heat in steel making.<br>
Submerged gas injection through bottom of a metallurgical reactor containing molten metal<br>
such as LD steel making converter has been an established practice for enhanced mass<br>
transfer rates, improved mixing and closer approach to chemical equilibrium. The<br>
improvement with respect to the primitive LD process, with only top blowing, is attributed<br>
to the better homogenization of the temperature and chemical composition of the bath and<br>
improving the reaction rates by bringing reactants together and moving products from the<br>
reaction site.<br>
This additional bath stirring helps in attaining metallurgical advantages in terms of<br>
improved metallic yield, better process control and meeting stringent quality requirements<br>
by achieving controlled oxygen, carbon, phosphorous and nitrogen contents in the steel.<br>
Various benefits obtained out of combined blowing were such as increased steel yield,<br>
improved slag metal interaction, better ferroalloy recovery etc.<br>
This is attributed to the fact that in steelmaking process the metallurgical characteristics of<br>
the process is linked to the attainment of the slag metal equilibrium at any instant during<br>
the blow and it is mainly dependent upon the efficiency of the bath mixing and mass<br>
transfer rate. The variables such as radial placement of the tuyeres, tuyere configuration<br>
(circular, linear etc.), and total bottom gas flow rate have been studied vividly to improvise<br>
mixing and mass transfer in the steel making converter vessel. Numerous studies had<br>
been carried out keeping the improvement in mixing and mass transfer rates of slag-metal<br>
in LD steel making converter in perspective through changing different tuyere<br>
arrangements, the bottom injection parameters such as the gas injection rate and the PCD<br>
(pitch circle diameter - the ratio of radial distance of tuyere to that of the radius of the<br>
vessel) of the placement of the bottom tuyeres, the number of tuyeres.<br>
The thermodynamic behavior of the different refining reactions is well established. During<br>
the decarburization period of the blow, a vigorous CO evolution helps in getting the aided<br>
mixing, an inherent advantage of the process.<br>
Hence the bottom gas flow through the bottom injection elements are regulated in such a<br>
way that it should be operated at desired flow rates as per the thermodynamic state of the<br>
refining reactions. It is operated from a flow rate barely minimum to avoid clogging to a<br>
highest during the end of the blow so as to take care of mixing and mass transfer in the<br>
bath. But whatever the state of the flow rate at which it is operated at, one of the typical<br>
features of the bottom blowing has been a uniform flow through all the bottom tuyeres.<br>
However, it is worth noting that all the investigations that have been carried out till date<br>
relate to the enhancement of mixing and mass transfer through modifying the parameters<br>
such as increased gas flow rate through bottom, increasing number of bottom tuyeres,<br>
changing the radial position of the tuyeres, or changing the total flow rate of through the<br>
tuyeres during course of the blow.<br>
But increased gas flow rate also means higher mechanical wear of the tuyere wall and<br>
hence resulting in lower refractory lining life.<br>
A need therefore exists for achieving optimum mixing and mass transfer without increasing<br>
the gas flow rate or changing the tuyere position.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to enhance the mixing for improved mass<br>
transfer during blowing through the elements mounted in the base of the converter, called<br>
tuyeres, without increasing the gas flow rate.<br>
This and other objects of the present invention can be achieved by distributing the total<br>
gas flow through the bottom tuyeres differentially among the tuyeres.<br>
As explained in the last section, conventionally the flow through the bottom tuyeres are<br>
distributed uniformly among the tuyeres. In contrast to this uniform flow rate, the<br>
differential flow rate used in the present invention increases the mixing and mass transfer<br>
by as high as 35%.<br>
Thus the present invention provides an improved method for dephosphorisation of steel in<br>
an LD steel making converter comprising the steps of: blowing oxygen using a top oxygen<br>
lance for refinina steel; combined blowing of inert gases from a plurality of elements<br>
arranged at the base of said converter for enhancing mixing for improved mass transfer;<br>
and regulating the flow of said inert gases through said elements for distributing the total<br>
gas flow differentially among said elements.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
A schematic illustration of the flow uniformity through the tuyeres is shown in Figure 1A.<br>
In contrast to this uniform flow rate, the differential flow rate of the present invention is<br>
shown in Figure 1B.<br>
Mixing time and mass transfer experiments were carried out on a physical model<br>
geometrically and dynamically similar to an existing LD steel making vessel. The Modified<br>
Froude Number was used to make the model dynamically similar to the prototype.<br>
The details of the prototype and the model are enlisted in Table 1.<br>
For the mixing time experiment, slag phase was not simulated as the overall mixing in a<br>
converter is exclusively governed by fluid in the bulk metal phase. However, during mass<br>
transfer experiments a separate phase simulating slag was used along with water<br>
simulating liquid steel.<br>
Mixing time experiments were carried out by monitoring the conductivity of the bath by<br>
means of conductivity probe and kCI solution as tracer. However, during the study the<br>
location of the bottom tuyere at different PCD had been tried out. The details of the<br>
different configurations are listed in Table 2 and are shown in Figure 2.<br>
An integrated experimental set up used during the study is shown in Figure 3. The mixing<br>
time for each experiment was calculated from the conductivity versus time plots for a<br>
degree of mixing of 95 % (+ 5%). Sufficient care was taken to ensure that the variation in<br>
the mixing time for any identical sets of experiments did not exceed three seconds. A<br>
typical mixing time experiment is depicted graphically in Figure 4.<br>
In mass transfer experimentation, a new system (engine oil-water) had been used for this<br>
study. Phase 1 simulates the steel whereas Phase II simulates the siag phase. The<br>
following equation was used to calculate the mass transfer rate constant (k).<br><br>
where k is the mass transfer rate constant of exchange material from Phase I to Phase II;<br>
Ce is the equilibrium concentration of the exchange material in Phase I;<br>
Ct is the concentration of the exchange material in Phase I after time t;<br>
C0 is the initial concentration of exchange material in Phase I.<br>
The exchange material used for the study was benzoic acid. Hence all the mass transfer<br>
experiments were carried out with this system. In the mass transfer experiments, the<br>
transfer of benzoic acid from the water to the engine oil grade-68 was studied, A typical<br>
mass transfer experiment was carried out by first filling up the model with 90 litres of<br>
benzoic acid solution (about 2 gms/lit), then 18 litres of engine oil was gently poured on it.<br>
This amount was similar to the proportion of the slag with respect to liquid steel volume in<br>
the steel making vessel in an existing LD shop. Samples were collected simultaneously<br>
from centre and periphery of the vessel at an interval of 2 minutes. These samples were<br>
subsequently analyzed for their benzoic acid content volumetrically by titrating against 0.05<br>
N potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution using phenolphthalein as the indicator.<br>
For determining the impact of differential flow rate on mixing in the LD converter, various<br>
schemes were formulated and mixing time experiments were carried out by varying the<br>
bottom gas flow rate and keeping other parameters like top lance flow rate, lance height,<br>
bath height constant as enlisted in Table 1. Figure 5 shows a scheme of differential flow<br>
rate among the bottom tuyeres by clubbing together all the 8 tuyeres into three groups of<br>
tuyeres. The flow rates among them were varied from low, intermediate and highest<br>
keeping the total bottom gas flow rate constant. As shown in Figure IB the flow rates are<br>
in the ratio of 2:3:5 in the three groups.<br>
The best location for putting the probe in the case of the differential flow conditions was<br>
optimized. As explained in the previous section, the flow rate was varied so as to cover up<br>
the minimum flow rate through tuyeres corresponding to the start of the blow to a<br>
maximum flow rate at the end of the blow. A consistent improvement in mixing time of<br>
the order of 33-41 % was observed across a wide range of bottom gas flow rate of as<br>
low as 10 Ipm to 50 lpm which covering the minimum and the maximum flow rates<br>
corresponding to that under practice in LD steel making process. But in the flow regime at<br>
which an LD shop operates an improvement in mixing time of more than 30 % was<br>
achieved with differential flow compared to the existing practice of uniform flow through<br>
the tuyeres.<br>
The comparison of mixing time between the uniform flow conditions with the differential<br>
flow condition for existing tuyeres position is shown in Figure 6.<br>
A similar improvement in terms of mixing time has been obtained with the tuyeres<br>
configurations such as S(l), S(2) as shown in Figures 7 and 8 respectively. The mixing<br>
results from a combination of many phenomena such as molecular diffusion, convective<br>
flow and turbulent diffusion. Any one of these phenomena is not sufficient for perfect<br>
mixing. What happens in the vessel is that when the bath is stirred through bottom<br>
purging and top lance injection, turbulent motion is generated in the bath which drives the<br>
convective flow or bulk flow. Such bulk flow causes disintegration of the larger size<br>
pockets of fluid into smaller pockets called eddies and gets dispersed to improve mixing<br>
process which is termed as eddy diffusion. This type of mixing in bulk of the vessel is<br>
termed as macro mixing. When the flow rate through all the tuyeres is uniform, the<br>
circulation cells formed in the liquid metal pool will have uniform strength. This causes<br>
little interaction amongst the cells. But in the case of differential flow rates, the cells<br>
formed will have different strengths which aids in more and more bulk convection as there<br>
is clearly a gradient of energy in three different regions of the bath and thereby enhancing<br>
the intermixing amongst the cells.<br>
To determine the impact of differential flow rate on Mass Transfer Rate in the LD<br>
converter, mass transfer study was carried out for all the configuration such as S(0), S(1),<br>
S(2) with uniform and differential flow. These locations were selected based on the basis<br>
of better mixing. As discussed earlier, during the mass transfer experimentation, samples<br>
were taken from centre as well from the periphery of the vessel. It was found that there<br>
was not much difference in the concentration in the samples obtained from the centre as<br>
well periphery of the vessel as shown in Figure 9.<br>
As expected, concentration of benzoic acid decreased with time. The mass transfer<br>
between the two fluids owing to the mixing of the phases was calculated assuming first<br>
order kinetics by the expression as given in equation (1). As in the present investigation<br>
interracial area 'A' for mass transfer was not determined, therefore, the mass transfer<br>
coefficient could not be determined instead the rate constant 'K' was determined. The<br>
value of Ce in the present investigation was found to be 1.246 gms/litre. The value of rate<br>
constant was determined by plotting -In[(Ct-Ce)/(C0-Ct)] against time and by fitting<br>
straight lines; the slope of each line gave the value of rate constant V when the<br>
differential flow rate condition was imparted to the bottom gas flow rate. Figure 10 shows<br>
that the rate constant 'K' increased by 28 % when flow pattern was changed from uniform<br>
to differential flow at existing tuyere location S(0).<br>
Figure 11 shows the improvement in 'K' when a differential flow in place of uniform flow<br>
condition was tried out for tuyere configured S(l) and an improvement of magnitude of<br>
about 65% was obtained. It is evident that with respect to existing tuyere configuration<br>
S(0) with uniform flow rate the improvement in mass transfer rate constant 'K' was 18 %<br>
when changed to S(l) with uniform flow rate.<br><br>
