ENVELOPE SHAPING OF DECORRELATED SIGNALS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to temporal envelope shaping<br>
of signals and in particular to the temporal envelope shap-<br>
ing of a decorrelated signal derived from a downmix signal<br>
and additional control data during the reconstruction of a<br>
stereo or multi-channel audio signal.<br>
Background of the Invention in Prior Art<br>
Recent development in audio coding enables one to recreate<br>
a multi-channel representation of an audio signal based on<br>
a stereo (or mono) signal and corresponding control data.<br>
These methods differ substantially from older matrix based<br>
solutions, such as Dolby Prologic, since additional control<br>
data is transmitted to control the recreation, also re-<br>
ferred to as up-mix, of the surround channels based on the<br>
transmitted mono or stereo channels. Such parametric multi-<br>
channel audio decoders reconstruct N channels based on M<br>
transmitted channels, where N &gt; M, and the additional con-<br>
trol data. Using the additional control data causes a sig-<br>
nificantly lower data rate than transmitting all N chan-<br>
nels, making the coding very efficient, while at the same<br>
time ensuring compatibility with both M channel devices and<br>
N channel devices. The M channels can either be a single<br>
mono channel, a stereo channel, or a 5.1 channel represen-<br>
tation. Hence, it is possible to have an 7.2 channel origi-<br>
nal signal, downmixed to a 5.1 channel backwards compatible<br>
signal, and spatial audio parameters enabling a spatial au-<br>
dio decoder to reproduce a closely resembling version of<br>
the original 7.2 channels, at a small additional bit rate<br>
overhead.<br>
These parametric surround coding methods usually comprise a<br>
parameterisation of the surround signal based on time and<br>
frequency variant ILD (Inter Channel Level Difference) and<br><br>
ICC (Inter Channel Coherence) quantities. These parameters<br>
describe e.g. power ratios and correlations between channel<br>
pairs of the original multi-channel signal. In the decoder<br>
process, the re-created multichannel signal is obtained by-<br>
distributing the energy of the received downmix channels<br>
between all the channel pairs described by the transmitted<br>
ILD parameters. However, since a multi-channel signal can<br>
have equal power distribution between all channels, while<br>
the signals in the different channels are very different,<br>
thus giving the listening impression of a very wide sound,<br>
the correct wideness is obtained by mixing signals with<br>
decorrelated versions of the same, as described by the ICC<br>
parameter.<br>
The decorrelated version of the signal, often referred to<br>
as wet signal, is obtained by passing the signal (also<br>
called dry signal) through a reverberator, such as an all-<br>
pass filter. The output from the decorrelator has a time-<br>
response that is usually very flat. Hence, a dirac input<br>
signal gives a decaying noise-burst out. When mixing the<br>
decorrelated and the original signal it is for some tran-<br>
sient signal types, like applause signals, important to<br>
shape the time envelope of the decorrelated signal to bet-<br>
ter match that one of the dry signal. Failing to do so will<br>
result in a perception of larger room size and unnatural<br>
sounding transients due to pre-echo type of artefacts.<br>
In systems where the multi-channel reconstruction is done<br>
in a frequency transform domain having a low time resolu-<br>
tion, temporal envelope shaping techniques can be employed,<br>
similarly to those used for shaping quantization noise such<br>
as Temporal Noise Shaping [J. Herre and J. D. Johnston,<br>
"Enhancing the performance of perceptual audio coding by<br>
using temporal noise shaping (TNS)," in 101st AES Conven-<br>
tion, Los Angeles, November 1996] of perceptual audio co-<br>
decs like MPEG-4 AAC. This is accomplished by means of pre-<br>
diction across frequency bins, where the temporal envelope<br>
is estimated by linear prediction in the frequency direc-<br><br>
tion on the dry signal, and the filter obtained is applied,<br>
again in the frequency direction, on the wet signal.<br>
One may for example consider a delay line as decorrelator<br>
and a strongly transient signal, such as applause or a gun-<br>
shot, as signal to be up-mixed. When no envelope shaping<br>
would be performed, a delayed version of the signal would<br>
be combined with the original signal to reconstruct a ste-<br>
reo or multi-channel signal. Such, the transient signal<br>
would be present twice in the up-mixed signal, separated by<br>
the delay time, causing an unwanted echo type effect.<br>
In order to achieve good results on highly critical sig-<br>
nals, the time-envelope of the decorrelated signal needs to<br>
be shaped with a very high time resolution, such cancelling<br>
out a delayed echo of a transient signal or masking it by<br>
reducing its energy to the energy contained in the carrier<br>
channel at the time.<br>
This broad band gain adjustment of the decorrelated signal<br>
can be done over windows as short as 1ms [US Patent Appli-<br>
cation, "Diffuse Sound Shaping for BCC Schemes and the<br>
Like", No. 11/006492, 12/7/2004]. Such high time-<br>
resolutions of the gain adjustment for the decorrelated<br>
signal inevitably leads to additional distortion. In order<br>
to minimise the added distortion for non-critical signals,<br>
i.e. where the temporal shaping of the decorrelated signal<br>
is not crucial, detection mechanism are incorporated in the<br>
encoder or decoder, that switch the temporal shaping algo-<br>
rithm on and off, according to some sort of pre-defined<br>
criteria. The drawback is that the system can become ex-<br>
tremely sensitive to detector tuning.<br>
Throughout the following description the term decorrelated<br>
signal or wet signal is used for the, possibly gain ad-<br>
justed (according to the ILD and ICC parameters) decorre-<br>
lated version of a downmix signal, and the term downmix<br><br>
signal, direct signal or dry signal is used for the, possi-<br>
bly gain adjusted downmix signal.<br>
In prior art implementations, a high time-resolution gain<br>
adjustment, i.e. a gain adjustment based on samples of the<br>
dry signal as short as milliseconds, leads to an additional<br>
significant distortion for non-critical signals. These are<br>
non-transient signals having a smooth timely evolution, for<br>
example music signals. The prior art approach of switching<br>
the gain adjustment off for such non-critical signals in-<br>
troduces a new and strong dependency of the quality of au-<br>
dio perception on the detection mechanism, which is, of<br>
course, mostly disadvantageous and may even introduce addi-<br>
tional distortion, when the detection fails.<br>

tening; and a time envelope shaper for time envelope shap-<br>

In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present inven-<br>

this object is achieved by a computer program for perform-<br>
ing, when running on a computer, a method in accordance<br>
with any of the above method claims.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that the en-<br>
velope of a decorrelated signal derived from an original<br>
signal or of a combination signal derived by combining the<br>
original signal and the decorrelated signal can be shaped<br><br>
without introducing additional distortion, when a spectral<br>
flattener is used to spectrally flatten the spectrum of the<br>
decorrelated signal or the combination signal and the<br>
original signal to use the flattened spectra for deriving a<br>
gain factor describing the energy distribution between the<br>
flattened spectra, and when the so derived gain factor is<br>
used by an envelope shaper to shape the time envelope of<br>
the decorrelated signal or of the combination signal.<br>
Flattening the spectrum has the advantage that transient<br>
signals are hardly affected by flattening, since these sig-<br>
nals already have a rather flat spectrum. Moreover, the<br>
gain factors derived for non-transient signals are being<br>
brought closer to unity. Therefore both demands shaping<br>
transient signals and not altering non-transient signals<br>
can be met at a time, without having to switch envelope<br>
shaping on and off during a decoding process.<br>
The same advantages hold for shaping of combination signals<br>
that are a combination of an original signal and a decorre-<br>
lated signal which is derived from said original signal.<br>
Such a combination may be derived by first deriving a<br>
decorrelated signal from the original signal and by then<br>
simply adding the two signals. For example, possible pre-<br>
echo type of artefacts can be advantageously suppressed in<br>
the combination signal by shaping the combination signal<br>
using the flattened spectrum of the combination signal and<br>
the flattened spectrum of the original signal to derive<br>
gain factors used for shaping.<br>
The present invention relates to the problem of shaping the<br>
temporal envelope of decorrelated signals that are fre-<br>
quently used in reconstruction of multi-channel audio sig-<br>
nals. The invention proposes a new method that retains the<br>
high time resolution for applause signals, while minimising<br>
the introduced distortion for other signal types. The pre-<br>
sent invention teaches a new way to perform the short time<br>
energy adjustment that significantly reduces the amount of<br><br>
distortion introduced, making the algorithm much more ro-<br>
bust and less dependent on a very accurate detector con-<br>
trolling the operation of a temporal envelope shaping algo-<br>
rithm.<br>
The present invention comprises the following features:<br>
performing spectral flattening of the direct sound<br>
signal or a signal derived from the direct sound sig-<br>
nal, over a time segment significantly longer than the<br>
time segment used for temporal envelope shaping;<br>
performing spectral flattening of the decorrelated<br>
signal, over a time segment significantly longer than<br>
the time segment used for temporal envelope shaping;<br>
calculating the gain factor for the short time segment<br>
used for envelope shaping based on the long time spec-<br>
trally flattened signals;<br>
performing the spectral flattening in the time domain<br>
by means of LPC (Linear Predictive Coding);<br>
performing the spectral flattening in the subband do-<br>
main of a filterbank;<br>
performing spectral flattening prior to frequency di-<br>
rection based prediction of temporal envelope;<br>
performing energy correction for frequency direction<br>
based prediction of temporal envelope.<br>
The following problems are completely or significantly re-<br>
duced by the present invention, that would otherwise arise<br>
when attempting very short time broad band energy correc-<br>
tion of a decorrelated signal:<br><br>
the problem of introducing a significant amount of<br>
distortion especially for signal segments where the<br>
temporal shaping is not required;<br>
the problem of introducing high dependency on a detec-<br>
tor indicating when the short time energy correction<br>
should be operated, due to the distortion introduced<br>
for arbitrary signals.<br>
The present invention outlines a novel method for calculat-<br>
ing the required gain adjustment that retains the high<br>
time-resolution but minimises the added distortion. This<br>
means that a spatial audio system utilising the present in-<br>
vention is not as dependent on a detection mechanism that<br>
switches the temporal shaping algorithm off for non-<br>
critical items, since the added distortion for items where<br>
the temporal shaping is not required is kept to a minimum.<br>
The novel invention also outlines how to get an improved<br>
estimate of the temporal envelope of the dry signal to be<br>
applied to the wet signal when estimating it by means of<br>
linear prediction in the frequency direction within the<br>
transform domain.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention an inventive ap-<br>
paratus for processing a decorrelated signal is applied<br>
within the signal processing path of a 1 to 2 upmixer after<br>
the derivation of the wet signal from the dry signal.<br>
Firstly, a spectrally flattened representation of the wet<br>
signal and of the dry signal is computed for a large number<br>
of consecutive time domain samples (a frame). Based on<br>
those spectrally flattened representations of the wet and<br>
the dry signal, gain factors to adjust the energy of a<br>
smaller number of samples of the wet signal are then com-<br>
puted based on the spectrally flattened representations of<br>
the wet and the dry signal. By spectrally flattening, the<br>
spectrum of a transient signal, which is rather flat by na-<br><br>
ture, is hardly altered, whereas the spectrum of periodic<br>
signals is strongly modified. Using a signal representation<br>
with flattened spectra therefore achieves both, shaping the<br>
envelope of the decorrelated wet signal heavily, when a<br>
transient signal is predominant and shaping the envelope of<br>
the wet signal merely, when smooth or periodic signals<br>
carry the most energy in the dry channel. Thus, the present<br>
invention significantly reduces the amount of distortion<br>
added to the signal especially for signal segments where<br>
the temporal envelope shaping is basically not required.<br>
Furthermore, the high dependency on a prior art detector<br>
indicating when short time energy corrections should be ap-<br>
plied, is avoided.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention an inven-<br>
tive apparatus operates on an upmixed (combined) monophonic<br>
signal which is derived by an upmixer that combines an<br>
original signal and a decorrelated signal derived from the<br>
original signal to compute the upmixed monophonic signal.<br>
Such upmixing is a standard strategy during reconstruction<br>
of multi-channel signals for deriving individual channels<br>
that have acoustic properties of the corresponding original<br>
channel of the multi-channel signal. Since the inventive<br>
apparatus can be applied after such upmixing, already ex-<br>
isting set ups can easily be extended.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the tem-<br>
poral envelope shaping of a decorrelated signal is imple-<br>
mented within the subband domain of a filterbank. There,<br>
flattened spectral representations of the various subband<br>
signals are derived for each subband individually for a<br>
high number of consecutive samples. Based on the spectrally<br>
flattened long-term spectra, the gain factor to shape the<br>
envelope of the wet signal according to the dry signal is<br>
computed for a sample representing a much lower time period<br>
of the original signal. The advantages with respect to the<br>
perceptual quality of the reconstructed audio signal are<br>
the same as for the example described above. Furthermore,<br><br>
the possibility to implement the inventive concept within a<br>
filterbank representation has the advantage, that already<br>
existing multi-channel audio decoders using filterbank rep-<br>
resentations can be modified to implement the inventive<br>
concept without major structural and computational efforts.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the tem-<br>
poral envelope shaping of the wet signal is performed<br>
within the subband domain using linear prediction. There-<br>
fore, linear prediction is applied in the frequency direc-<br>
tion of the filterbank, allowing to shape the signal with<br>
higher time resolution than natively available in the fil-<br>
terbank. Again, the final energy correction is computed by<br>
estimating gain curves for a number of consecutive subband<br>
samples of the filterbank.<br>
In a modification of the previously described embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the estimation of the parameters de-<br>
scribing the whitening of the spectrum are smoothed over a<br>
number of neighbouring time samples of the filterbank.<br>
Therefore, the risk of applying a wrongly derived inverse<br>
filters to whiten the spectrum when transient signals are<br>
present, is further reduced.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 is showing a 1 to 2 channel parametric upmixing de-<br>
vice 100 to upmix a submitted mono channel 105 into two<br>
stereo channels 107 and 108, additionally using spatial pa-<br>
rameters. The parametric upmixing device 100 has a paramet-<br>
ric stereo upmixer 110, a decorrelator 112 and an inventive<br>
apparatus for processing a decorrelated signal 114.<br>
The transmitted monophonic signal 105 is input into the pa-<br>
rametric stereo upmixer 110 as well as into the decorrela-<br>
tor 112, that derives a decorrelated signal from the trans-<br>
mitted signal 105 using a decorrelation rule, that could,<br>
for example, be implemented by simply delaying the signal<br>
for a given time. The decorrelated signal produced by the<br>
decorrelator 112 is input into the inventive apparatus<br>
(shaper) 114, that additionally receives the transmitted<br>
monophonic signal as input. The transmitted monophonic sig-<br>
nal is needed to derive the shaping rules used to shape the<br>
envelope of the decorrelated signal, as elaborated in more<br>
detail in the coming paragraphs.<br>
Finally, a envelope shaped representation of the decorre-<br>
lated signal is input into the parametric stereo upmixer,<br>
which derives the left channel 107 and the right channel<br>
108 of a stereo signal from the transmitted monophonic sig-<br>
nal 105 and from the envelope shaped representation of the<br>
decorrelated signal.<br>
To better understand the inventive concept and the differ-<br>
ent presented embodiments of the present invention, the up-<br>
mixing process of a transferred monophonic signal into a<br><br>
stereo signal using the additionally submitted special pa-<br>
rameters is explained within the following paragraphs:<br>
It is known from prior art that two audio channels can be<br>
reconstructed based on a downmix channel and a set of spa-<br>
tial parameters carrying information on the energy distri-<br>
bution of the two original channels upon which the downmix<br>
was made as well as information on the correlation between<br>
the two original channels. The embodiment in Fig. <kl exem-></kl>
plifies a frame work for the present invention.<br>
In Fig. 1, the downmixed mono signal 105 is fed into a<br>
decorrelator unit 112 as well as a up-mix module 110. The<br>
decorrelator unit 112 creates a decorrelated version of<br>
the input signal 105, having the same frequency character-<br>
istics and the same long term energy. The upmix module<br>
calculates an upmix matrix based on the spatial parameters<br>
and the output channels 107 and 108 are synthesised. The<br>
upmix module 110 can be explained according to:<br><br>
with the parameters c,, cr, a and β being derived from<br>
the ILD parameters and the ICC parameters transmitted in<br>
the bitstream. The signal X[k] is the received downmix sig-<br>
nal 105, the signal Q[k] is the de-correlated signal, being<br>
a decorrelated version of the input signal 105. The output<br>
signals 107 and 108 are denoted Y1[k] and Y2[k].<br>
The new module 114 is devised to shape the time envelope<br>
of the signal being output of the decorrelator module 112<br>
so that the temporal envelope matches that of the input<br>
signal 105. The details of module 100 will be elaborated<br>
extensively on in a later section.<br><br>
It is evident from the above and from Fig. 1 that the up-<br>
mix module generates a linear combination of the downmix<br>
signal and the decorrelated version of the same. It is<br>
thus evident that the summation of the decorrelated signal<br>
and the downmix signal can be done within the upmix as<br>
outlined above or in a subsequent stage. Hence, the two<br>
output channels above 107 and 108 can be replaced by four<br>
output channels, where two are holding the decorrelated<br>
version and the direct-signal version of the first chan-<br>
nel, and two are holding the decorrelated version and the<br>
direct-signal version of the second channel. This is<br>
achieved by replacing the above upmix equation by:<br><br>
The reconstructed output channels are subsequently ob-<br>
tained by:<br><br>
Given the above, it is clear that an inventive apparatus<br>
can be implemented into a decoding scheme as well before<br>
the final up-mixing, as shown in Fig. 1, as after the up-<br>
mixing. Moreover, the inventive apparatus can be used to<br>
shape the envelope of a decorrelated signal as well in the<br>
time domain as in a QMF subband domain.<br>
Fig. lb shows a further preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention where an inventive shaper 114 is used to shape a<br>
combination signal 118 derived from the transmitted mono-<br>
phonic signal 105 and a decorrelated signal 116 derived<br>
from the transmitted monophonic signal 105. The embodiment<br>
of Fig. lb is based on the embodiment of Fig. 1. Therefore,<br><br>
components having the same functionality have the same<br>
marks.<br>
A decorrelator 112 derives the decorrelated signal 116 from<br>
the transmitted monophonic signal 105. A mixer 117 receives<br>
the decorrelated signal 116 and the transmitted monophonic<br>
signal 105 as an input and derives the combination signal<br>
118 by combining the transmitted signal 105 and the decor-<br>
related signal 116.<br>
Combination may in that context mean any suitable method to<br>
derive one single signal from two or more input signals. In<br>
the simplest example the combination signal 118 is derived<br>
by simply adding the transmitted monophonic signal 105 and<br>
the decorrelated signal 116.<br>
The shaper 114 receives as an input the combination signal<br>
118 that is to be shaped. To derive the gain factors for<br>
shaping, the transmitted monophonic signal 105 is also in-<br>
put into the shaper 114. A partly decorrelated signal 119<br>
is derived at the output of the shaper 114 that has a<br>
decorrelated signal component and an original signal compo-<br>
nent without introducing additional audible artefacts.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a configuration, where the envelope shaping of<br>
the wet signal part can be applied after the upmix.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an inventive parametric stereo upmixer 120 and<br>
a decorrelator 112. The monophonic signal 105 is input into<br>
the decorrelator 112 and into the parametric stereo upmixer<br>
120. The decorrelator 112 derives a decorrelated signal<br>
from the monophonic signal 105 and inputs the decorrelated<br>
signal into the parametric stereo upmixer 120. The paramet-<br>
ric stereo upmixer 120 is based on the parametric stereo<br>
upmixer 110 already described in Fig. 1. The parametric<br>
stereo upmixer 120 differentiates from the parametric ste-<br>
reo upmixer 110 in that the parametric stereo upmixer 120<br>
derives a dry part 122a and a wet part 122b of the left<br><br>
channel and a dry part 124a and a wet part 124b of the<br>
right channel. In other words, the parametric stereo up-<br>
mixer 120 up-mixes the dry signal parts and the wet signal<br>
parts for both channels separately. This might be imple-<br>
mented in accordance with the formulas given above.<br>
As the wet signal parts 122a and 124a have been up-mixed<br>
but not shaped, a first shaper 126a and a second shaper<br>
126b are additionally present in the inventive up-mixing<br>
set shown in Fig. 2. The first shaper 126a receives at its<br>
input the wet signal 122b to be shaped and as a reference<br>
signal a copy of the left signal 122a. At the output of the<br>
first shaper 126a, a shaped dry signal 128a is provided.<br>
The second shaper 126b receives the right dry signal 124b<br>
and the right wet signal 124a at its input and derives the<br>
shaped wet signal 128b of the right channel as its output.<br>
To finally derive the desired left signal 107 and right<br>
signal 108, a first mixer 129a and a second mixer 129b are<br>
present in the inventive setup. The first mixer 129a re-<br>
ceives at its input a copy of the left up-mixed signal 122a<br>
and the shaped wet signal 128b to derive (at its output)<br>
the left signal 107. The second mixer 129b derives the<br>
right channel 108 in an analogous way, receiving the dry<br>
right signal 124a and the shaped wet right signal 128b at<br>
its inputs. As can be seen from Fig. 2, this setup can be<br>
operated as an alternative to the embodiment shown in Fig.<br>
1.<br>
Fig. 2b shows a preferred embodiment of the present inven-<br>
tion being a modification of the embodiment previously<br>
shown in Fig. 2 and therefore the same components share the<br>
same marks.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2b, the wet signal 122b is<br>
first mixed with its dry counterpart 122a to derive a left<br>
intermediate channel L* and the wet signal 124b is mixed<br>
with its dry counterpart 124a to receive a right intermedi-<br>
ate channel R*. Thus, a channel comprising left-side infor-<br><br>
mation and a channel comprising right-side information is<br>
generated. There is, however, still the possibility of hav-<br>
ing introduced audible artefacts by the wet signal compo-<br>
nents 122b and 124b. Therefore, the intermediate signals L*<br>
and R* are shaped by corresponding shapers 126a and 126b<br>
that additionally receive as an input the dry signal parts<br>
122a and 124a. Thus, finally a left channel 107 and a right<br>
channel 108 can be derived having the desired spatial prop-<br>
erties.<br>
To summarize shortly, the embodiment shown in Fig. 2b dif-<br>
fers from the embodiment shown in Fig. 2b in that the wet<br>
and dry signals are upmixed first and the shaping is done<br>
on the so derived combinations signal (L* and R*) . Thus,<br>
Fig. 2b shows an alternative set-up to solve the common<br>
problem of having two derive to channels without introduc-<br>
ing audible distortions by the used decorrelated signal<br>
parts. Other ways of combining two signal parts to derive a<br>
combination signal to be shaped, such as for example multi-<br>
plying or folding signals, are also suited to implement the<br>
inventive concept of shaping using also spectrally flat-<br>
tened representations of the signals.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3a, two channel reconstruction modules can<br>
be cascaded into a tree-structured system that iteratively<br>
recreates, for example, 5.1 channels from a mono downmix<br>
channel 130. This is outlined in Fig. 3a, where several in-<br>
ventive upmixing modules 100 are cascaded to recreate 5.1<br>
channels from the monophonic downmix channel 130.<br>
The 5.1 channel audio decoder 132 shown in Fig. 3a com-<br>
prises several 1 to 2 upmixers 100, that are arranged in a<br>
tree-like structure. The upmix is done iteratively, by sub-<br>
sequent upmixing of mono channels to stereo channels, as<br>
already known in the art, however using inventive 1 to 2<br>
upmixer blocks 100 that comprise an inventive apparatus for<br>
processing a decorrelated signal to enhance the perceptual<br>
quality of the reconstructed 5.1 audio signal.<br><br>
The present invention teaches that the signal from the<br>
decorrelator must undergo accurate shaping of its temporal<br>
envelope in order to not cause unwanted artefacts when the<br>
signal is mixed with the dry counterpart. The shaping of<br>
the temporal envelope can take place directly after the<br>
decorrelator unit as shown in Fig. 1 or, alternatively, up-<br>
mixing can be performed after the decorrelator for both,<br>
the dry signal and the wet signal separately, and the final<br>
summation of the two is done in the time domain after the<br>
synthesis filtering, as sketched in Fig. 2. This can alter-<br>
natively be performed in the filterbank domain also.<br>
To support the above mentioned separate generation of dry<br>
signals and wet signals, a hierarchical structure as shown<br>
in Fig. 3b is used in a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Fig. 3b is showing a first hierarchical decoder<br>
150 comprising several cascaded modified upmixing modules<br>
152 and a second hierarchical decoder 154 comprising sev-<br>
eral cascaded modified upmixing modules 156.<br>
To achieve the separate generation of the dry and the wet<br>
signal paths, the monophonic downmix signal 130 is split<br>
and input into the first hierarchical decoder 150 as well<br>
as into the second hierarchical decoder 154. The modified<br>
upmixing modules 152 of the first hierarchical decoder 150<br>
differentiate from the upmixing modules 100 of the 5.1<br>
channel audio decoder 132 in that they are only providing<br>
the dry signal parts at their outputs. Correspondingly, the<br>
modified upmixing modules 156 of the second hierarchical<br>
decoder 154 are only providing the wet signal parts at<br>
their outputs. Therefore, by implementing the same hierar-<br>
chical structure as already in Fig. 3a, the dry signal<br>
parts of the 5.1 channel signal are generated by the first<br>
hierarchical decoder 150, whereas the wet signal parts of<br>
the 5.1 channel signal are generated by the second hierar-<br>
chical decoder 154. Hence the generation of the wet and dry<br>
signals can for example be performed within the filterbank<br><br>
domain, whereas the combination of two signal parts can be<br>
performed in the time domain.<br>
The present invention further teaches that the signals<br>
used for extraction of the estimated envelopes that are<br>
subsequently used for the shaping of the temporal envelope<br>
of the wet signal shall undergo a long term spectral flat-<br>
tening or whitening operation prior to the estimation<br>
process in order to minimise the distortion introduced<br>
when modifying the decorrelated signal using very short<br>
time segments, i.e. time segments in the 1 ms range. The<br>
shaping of the temporal envelope of the decorrelated sig-<br>
nal can be done by means of short term energy adjustment<br>
in the subband domain or in the time domain. The whitening<br>
step as introduced by the present invention ensures that<br>
the energy estimates are calculated on an as large time<br>
frequency tile as possible. Stated differently, since the<br>
duration of the signal segment is extremely short, it is<br>
important to estimate the short term energy over an as<br>
large frequency range as possible, in order to maximise<br>
the "number of data-points" used for energy calculation.<br>
However, if one part of the frequency range is very domi-<br>
nant over the rest, i.e. a steep spectral slope, the num-<br>
ber of valid data points becomes too small, and the esti-<br>
mate obtained will be prone to vary from estimate to esti-<br>
mate, imposing unnecessary fluctuations of the applied<br>
gain values.<br>
The present invention further teaches that when the tempo-<br>
ral envelope of the decorrelated signal is shaped by means<br>
of prediction in the frequency direction [J. Herre and J.<br>
D. Johnston, "Enhancing the performance of perceptual au-<br>
dio coding by using temporal noise shaping (TNS)," in<br>
101st AES Convention, Los Angeles, November 1996.], the<br>
frequency spectrum used to estimate the predictor should<br>
undergo a whitening stage, in order to achieve a good es-<br>
timate of the temporal envelope that shall be applied to<br>
the decorrelated signal. Again, it is not desirable to<br><br>
base the estimate on a small part of the spectrum as would<br>
be the case for a steep sloping spectrum without spectral<br>
whitening.<br>
Fig. 4a shows a preferred embodiment of the present inven-<br>
tion operative in the time domain. The inventive apparatus<br>
for processing a decorrelated signal 200 receives the wet<br>
signal 202 to be shaped and the dry signal 204 as input,<br>
wherein the wet signal 202 is derived from the dry signal<br>
204 in a previous step, that is not shown in Fig.4.<br>
The apparatus 200 for processing a decorrelated signal 202<br>
is having a first high path filter 206, a first linear<br>
prediction device 208, a first inverse filter 210 and a<br>
first delay 212 in signal path of the dry signal and a<br>
second high-pass filter 220, a second linear prediction<br>
device 222, a second inverse filter 224, a low-pass filter<br>
226 and a second delay 228 in the signal path of the wet<br>
signal. The apparatus further comprises a gain calculator<br>
230, a multiplier (envelope shaper) 232 and an adder (up-<br>
mixer) 234.<br>
On the dry signal side, the input of the dry signal is<br>
split and the input into the first high-pass filter 206<br>
and the first delay 212. An output of the high-pass filter<br>
206 is connected with an input of the first linear predic-<br>
tion device 208 and with an first input of the first in-<br>
verse filter 210. An output of the first linear prediction<br>
device 208 is connected to a second input of the inverse<br>
filter 210, and an output of the inverse filter 210 is<br>
connected to a first input of the gain calculator 230. In<br>
the wet signal path, the wet signal 202 is split and input<br>
into an input of the second high-pass filter 220 and to an<br>
input of the low-pass filter 226. An output of the low-<br>
pass filter 226 is connected to the second delay 228. An<br>
output of the second high-pass filter 220 is connected to<br>
an input of the second linear prediction device 222 and to<br>
a first input of the second inverse filter 224. A output<br><br>
of the second linear prediction device 222 is connected to<br>
a second input of the second inverse filter 224, an output<br>
of which is connected to a second input of the gain calcu-<br>
lator 230. The envelope shaper 232 receives at a first in-<br>
put the high-pass filtered wet signal 202 as supplied at<br>
the output of the second high-pass filter 220. A second<br>
input of the envelope shaper 232 is connected to an output<br>
of the gain calculator 230. An output of the envelope<br>
shaper 232 is connected to a first input of the adder 234,<br>
that receives at a second input a delayed dry signal, as<br>
supplied from an output of the first delay 212, and which<br>
further receives at a third input a delayed low frequency<br>
portion of the wet signal, as supplied by an output of the<br>
second delay 228. At an output of the adder 232, the com-<br>
pletely processed signal is supplied.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention shown<br>
in Fig. 4a, the signal coming from the decorrelator (the<br>
wet signal 202) and the corresponding dry signal 204 are<br>
input into the second high-pass filter 220, and the first<br>
high-pass filter 206, respectively, where both signals are<br>
high-pass filtered at approximately 2kHz cut-off fre-<br>
quency. The wet signal 202 is also low-pass filtered by<br>
the low-pass filter 226, that is having a path band simi-<br>
lar to the stop band of the second high-pass filter 220.<br>
The temporal envelope shaping of the decorrelated (wet)<br>
signal 202 is thus only performed in the frequency range<br>
above 2kHz. The low-pass part of the wet signal 202 (not<br>
subject to temporal envelope shaping) is delayed by the<br>
second delay 208 to compensate for the delay introduced<br>
when shaping the temporal envelope of the high-pass part<br>
of the decorrelated signal 202. The same is true for the<br>
dry signal part 204, that receives the same delay time by<br>
the first delay 212, so that at the adder 234, the proc-<br>
essed high-pass filtered part of the wet signal 202, the<br>
delayed low-pass part of the wet signal 202 and the de-<br>
layed dry signal 204 can be added or upmixed to yield a<br>
finally processed upmixed signal.<br><br>
According to the present invention, after the high-pass<br>
filtering, the long-term spectral envelope is to be esti-<br>
mated. It is important to note, that the time segment used<br>
for the long-term spectral envelope estimation is signifi-<br>
cantly longer than the time segments used to do the actual<br>
temporal envelope shaping. The spectral envelope estima-<br>
tion and subsequent inverse filtering typically operates<br>
on time segments in the range of 20 ms while the temporal<br>
envelope shaping aims at shaping the temporal envelope<br>
with an accuracy in the 1 ms range. In the preferred em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 4a, the<br>
spectral whitening is performed by inverse filtering with<br>
the first inverse filter 210 operating on the dry signal<br>
and the second inverse filter 224 operating on the wet<br>
signal 202. To obtain the required filter coefficients for<br>
the first inverse filter 210 and the second inverse filter<br>
224, the spectral envelopes of the signals are estimated<br>
by means of linear prediction by the first linear predic-<br>
tion device 208 and the second linear prediction device<br>
222. The spectral envelope H(z) of a signal can be ob-<br>
tained using linear prediction, as described by the fol-<br>
lowing formulas:<br><br>
is the polynomial obtained using the autocorrelation<br>
method or the covariance method [Digital Processing of<br>
Speech Signals, Rabiner &amp; Schafer, Prentice Hall, Inc.,<br>
Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 07632, ISBN 0-13-213603-1,<br>
Chapter 8], and G is a gain factor. The order p of the<br>
above polynomial is called predictor order.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 4a, the linear prediction of the spectral<br>
envelope of the signal is done in parallel for the dry sig-<br>
nal part 204 and for the wet signal part 202. With these<br>
estimates of the spectral envelope of the signals, inverse<br>
filtering of the high-pass filtered dry signal 204 and the<br>
wet signal 202 can be performed, i.e. the flattening of the<br>
spectrum (spectral whitening) can be done while the energy<br>
within the signals has to be preserved. The degree of spec-<br>
tral whitening, i.e. the extent to which the flattened<br>
spectrum becomes flat, can be controlled by the varying<br>
predictor order p, i.e. by limiting the order of the poly-<br>
nomial A(z), thus limiting the amount of fine structure<br>
that can be described by H(z). Alternatively, a bandwidth<br>
expansion factor can be applied to the polynomial A(z). The<br>
bandwidth expansion factor is defined according to the fol-<br>
lowing formula, based on the polynomial A(z).<br><br>
The temporal envelope shaping and the effect of the band-<br>
width expansion factor p are illustrated in Figs. 4c and<br>
4d.<br>
Fig. 4c gives an example for the estimation of the spectral<br>
envelope of a signal, as it could be done by the first lin-<br>
ear prediction device 208 and the second linear prediction<br>
device 222. For the spectral representation of Fig. 4c, the<br>
frequency in Hz is plotted on the x-axis versus the energy<br>
transported in the given frequency in units of dB on the y-<br>
axis.<br>
The solid line 240 describes the original spectral envelope<br>
of the processed signal, whereas the dashed line 242 gives<br>
the result obtained by linear predictive coding (LPC) using<br>
the values of the spectral envelope at the marked equidis-<br>
tant frequency values. For the example shown in Fig. 4c,<br>
the predictor order p is 30, the comparatively high predic-<br><br>
tor order explaining the close match of the predicted spec-<br>
tral envelope 242 and the real spectral envelope 240. This<br>
is due to the fact that the predictor is able to describe<br>
more fine structure, the higher the predictor order.<br>
Fig. 4d shows the effect of lowering the predictor order p<br>
or of applying a bandwidth expansion factor p . Fig. 4d<br>
shows two examples of estimated envelopes in the same rep-<br>
resentation as in Fig. 4c, i.e. the frequency on the x-axis<br>
and the energy on the y-axis. A estimated envelope 244<br>
represents a spectral envelope obtained from linear predic-<br>
tive coding with a given predictor order. The filtered en-<br>
velope 24 6 shows the result of linear predictive coding on<br>
the same signal with reduced predictor order p or, alterna-<br>
tively, with a bandwidth expansion factor row applied. As<br>
can be seen, the filtered envelope 246 is much smoother<br>
than the estimated envelope 244. This means that at the<br>
frequencies, where the estimated envelope 244 and the fil-<br>
tered envelope 24 6 differ at most, the filtered envelope<br>
246 describes the real envelope less precise than the esti-<br>
mated envelope 244. Hence, an inverse filtering based on<br>
the filtered envelope 246 yields a flattened spectrum, that<br>
is flattened less as if using the parameters from the esti-<br>
mated envelope 244 in the inverse filtering process. The<br>
inverse filtering is described in the following paragraph.<br>
The parameters or coefficients a* estimated by the linear<br>
predicted devices are used by the inverse filters 210 and<br>
224, to do the spectral flattening of the signals, i.e. the<br>
inverse filtering by using the following inverse filter<br>
function:<br><br>
where pis the predictor order and p is the optional band-<br>
width expansion factor.<br><br>
The coefficients ak can be obtained in different manners,<br>
e.g. the autocorrelation method or the covariance method.<br>
It is common practice to add some sort of relaxation to<br>
the estimate in order to ensure stability of the system.<br>
When using the autocorrelation method this is easily ac-<br>
complished by offsetting the zero-lag value of the corre-<br>
lation vector. This is equivalent to addition of white<br>
noise at a constant level to the signal used to estimate<br>
A(z).<br>
The gain calculator 230 calculates the short time target<br>
energies, i.e. the energies needed within the single sam-<br>
ples of the wet signal to fulfil the requirement of an en-<br>
velope of the wet signal that is shaped to the envelope of<br>
the dry signal. These energies are calculated based on the<br>
spectrally flattened dry signal and based on the spectrally<br>
flattened wet signal. A derives gain adjustment value can<br>
then be applied to the wet signal by the envelope shaper<br>
232.<br>
Before describing the gain calculator 230 in more detail,<br>
it may be noted, that during the inverse filtering the gain<br>
factor G of the inverse filters 210 and 224 needs to be<br>
taken care for. Since the dry and wet signals operated on<br>
are output signals from an upmix-process that has produced<br>
two output signals for every channel, wherein the first<br>
channel has a specific energy ratio with respect to the<br>
second channel according to the ILD and ICC parameters used<br>
for the upmixed process, it is essential that this relation<br>
is maintained in average over the time segment for which<br>
the ILD and ICC parameters are valid in the course of the<br>
temporal envelope shaping. Stated differently, the appara-<br>
tus for processing a decorrelated signal 200 shall only<br>
modify the temporal envelope of the decorrelated signal,<br>
while maintaining the same average energy of the signal<br>
over the segment being processed.<br><br>
The gain calculator 230 operates on the two spectrally<br>
flattened signals and calculates a short-time gain function<br>
for application on the wet-signal over time segments much<br>
shorter than the segments used for inverse filtering. For<br>
example, when the segment length for inverse filtering is<br>
2048 samples, the short-term gain factors may be computed<br>
for samples of a length of 64. This means that on the basis<br>
of spectra, that are flattened over a length of 2048 sam-<br>
ples, gain factors are derived for temporal energy shaping<br>
using much shorter segments of the signal as, for example,<br>
64.<br>
The application of the calculated gain factors to the wet<br>
signal is done by the envelope shaper 232 that multiplies<br>
the calculated gain factors with the sample parameters. Fi-<br>
nally the high-pass filtered, envelope shaped wet signal is<br>
added to its low frequency part by the adder (upmixer) 234,<br>
yielding the finally processed and envelope shaped wet sig-<br>
nal at the output of the envelope shaper 234.<br>
As energy preservation and smooth transition between dif-<br>
ferent gain factors is an issue as well during the inverse<br>
filtering as during the application of the gain factor,<br>
windowing functions may additionally be applied to calcu-<br>
lated gain factors to guarantee for a smooth transition be-<br>
tween gain factors of neighbouring samples. Therefore, the<br>
inverse filtering step and the application of the calcu-<br>
lated short-term gain factors to the wet signals are de-<br>
scribed in more detail within Figs. 5a, 5b and 6 in later<br>
paragraphs, assuming the example mentioned above with a<br>
segment length of 2048 for inverse filtering and with a<br>
segment length of 64 for calculation of the short-term gain<br>
factors.<br>
Fig. 4b shows a modification of the inventive apparatus for<br>
processing a decorrelated signal 200, where the envelope<br>
shaped wet signal is supplied to a high-pass filter 240 af-<br><br>
ter the envelope shaping. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
high-pass filter 224 has the same characteristics as the<br>
high-pass filter 220 deriving the part of the wet signal<br>
202 that is filtered. Then, the high-pass filter 240 en-<br>
sures that any introduced distortion in the decorrelated<br>
signal does not alter the high-pass character of the sig-<br>
nal, thus introducing a miss-match in the summation of the<br>
unprocessed low-pass part of the decorrelated signal and<br>
the processed high-pass part of the signal.<br>
Several important features of the above-outlined implemen-<br>
tation of the present invention should again be emphasized:<br>
the spectral flattening is done by calculating a spec-<br>
tral envelope representation (in this particular exam-<br>
ple by means of LPC) of a time segment significantly<br>
longer than a time segment used for short-time energy<br>
adjustment;<br>
the spectral flattened signal is only used to calcu-<br>
late the energy estimates upon which the gain values<br>
are calculated that are used to estimate and apply the<br>
correct temporal envelope of the decorrelated (wet)<br>
signal;<br>
the mean energy ratio between the wet signal and the<br>
dry signal is maintained, it is only the temporal en-<br>
velope that is modified. Hence, the average of the<br>
gain values G over the signal segment being processed<br>
(i.e. a frame comprising typically 1024 or 2048 sam-<br>
ples) , is approximately equal to one for a majority of<br>
signals.<br>
Fig. 5a shows a more detailed description of an inverse<br>
filter used as first inverse filter 210 and as second in-<br>
verse filter 224 within the inventive apparatus for proc-<br>
essing a decorrelated signal 200. The inverse filter 300<br>
comprises an inverse transformer 302, a first energy calcu-<br><br>
lator 304, a second energy calculator 306, a gain calcula-<br>
tor 308 and a gain applier 310. The inverse transformer 302<br>
receives filter coefficients 312 (as derived by linear pre-<br>
dictive coding) and the signal X(k) 314 as input. A copy of<br>
the signal 314 is input into the first energy calculator<br>
304. The inverse transformer applies the inverse transfor-<br>
mation based on the filter coefficients 312 to the signal<br>
314 for a signal segment of length 2048. The gain factor G<br>
is set to 1, therefore, a flattened signal 316 (Xflat(z)) is<br>
derived from the input signal 314 according to the follow-<br>
ing formula:<br><br>
As this inverse filtering does not necessarily preserve the<br>
energy, the long-term energy of the flattened signal has to<br>
be preserved by means of a long term gain factor giong-<br>
Therefore, the signal 214 is input into the first energy<br>
calculator 304 and the flattened signal 316 is input into<br>
the second energy calculator 306, where the energies of the<br>
signal E and of the flattened signal Eflat are computed as<br>
follows:<br><br>
where the current segment length for spectral envelope es-<br>
timation and inverse filtering is 2048 samples.<br>
Hence, the gain factor glong can be computed by the gain<br>
calculator 308 using the following equation:<br><br><br>
By multiplying the flattened signal 316 with the derived<br>
gain factor giong, energy preservation can be assured by<br>
the gain applier 310. To ensure a smooth transition be-<br>
tween neighbouring signal segments, in a preferred embodi-<br>
ment, the gain factor glong is applied to the flattened<br>
signal 316 using a window function. Thus, a jump in the<br>
loudness of the signal can be avoided, which would heavily<br>
disturb the perceptual quality of the audio signal.<br>
The long-term gain factor glong can for example be applied<br>
according to Fig. 5b. Fig. 5 shows a possible window func-<br>
tion in a graph, where the number of samples is drawn on<br>
the x-axis, whereas the gain factor g is plotted on the y-<br>
axis. A window spanning the entire frame of 2048 samples<br>
is used fading out the gain value from the previous frame<br>
319 and fading-in the gain value 320 of the present frame.<br>
Applying inverse filters 300 within the inventive appara-<br>
tus for processing a decorrelated signal 200 assures, that<br>
the signals after the inverse filters are spectrally flat-<br>
tened while the energy of the input signals is furthermore<br>
preserved.<br>
Based on the flattened wet and dry signals, the gain fac-<br>
tor calculation can be performed by the gain calculator<br>
230. This shall be explained in more detail within the<br>
following paragraphs, where a windowing function is addi-<br>
tionally introduced to assure for a smooth transition of<br>
the gain factors used to scale neighbouring signal seg-<br>
ments. In the example shown in Fig. 6, the gain factors<br>
calculated for neighbouring segments are valid for 64 sam-<br>
ples each, wherein they are additionally scaled by a win-<br>
dowing function win(k). The energy within the single seg-<br>
ments are calculated according to the following formulas,<br>
where N denotes the segment number within the long-term<br>
segment used for spectral flattening, i.e. a segment hav-<br>
ing 2048 samples:<br><br><br>
Here, win(k) is a window function 322, as shown in Fig. 6<br>
that has, in this example, a length of 64 samples. In<br>
other words, the short-time gain function is calculated<br>
similarly to the gain calculation of the long-term gain<br>
factor glong, albeit over much shorter time segments. The<br>
single gain values GN to be applied to the single short-<br>
time samples are then calculated by the gain calculator<br>
230 according to:<br><br>
The gain values calculated above are applied to the wet<br>
signal using windowed overlap add segments as outlined in<br>
Fig. 6. In one preferred embodiment of the present inven-<br>
tion the overlap-add windows are 32 samples long at a<br>
44.1kHz sampling rate. In another embodiment a 64 sample<br>
window is used. As previously stated, one of the advanta-<br>
geous features of implementing the present invention in<br>
the time domain, is the freedom of choice of time resolu-<br>
tion of the temporal envelope shaping. The windows out-<br>
lined in Fig. 6 can also be used in module 230 where the<br>
gain values gn-t,gn-....gN . are being calculated.<br>
It may be noted, that given the requirement that the en-<br>
ergy relation between the wet and dry signals should be<br>
maintained over the processed segment as calculated by the<br>
upmix based on the ILD and ICC parameters, it is evident<br>
that an average gain value averaged over the gain values<br>
Sn-t,gn...gN shall be approximately equal to one for a majority<br>
of signals. Hence, returning to the calculation of the<br>
long term gain adjustment, in a different embodiment of<br>
the present invention the gain factor can be calculated as<br><br><br>
Hence, the wet and dry signals are normalised, and the<br>
long term energy ratio between the two is approximately<br>
maintained.<br>
Although the examples of the present invention detailed in<br>
the paragraphs above are performing temporal envelope<br>
shaping of a decorrelated signal in the time domain, it is<br>
evident from the derivation of the wet and dry signals<br>
above, that the temporal shaping module can be made to op-<br>
erate as well on the QMF subband signal output of a decor-<br>
relator unit prior to using the decorrelator signal for<br>
the final upmix stage.<br>
This is sketched in Fig. 7a. There, a incoming mono signal<br>
400 is input into a QMF filter bank 402, deriving a sub-<br>
band representation of a monophonic signal 400. Then, in a<br>
signal processing block 4 04, the upmix is performed for<br>
each subband individually. Hence, a final reconstructed<br>
left signal 406 can be provided by a QMF synthesis block<br>
408, and a final reconstructed right channel 410 can be<br>
provided by a QMF synthesis block 412.<br>
An example for a signal processing block 404 is given in<br>
Fig. 7b. The signal processing block 404 is having a<br>
decorrelator 413, an inventive apparatus for processing a<br>
decorrelated signal 414 and an upmixer 415.<br>
A single subband sample 416 is input into the signal proc-<br>
essing block 404. The decorrelator 413 is deriving a<br>
decorrelated sample from the subband sample 416 which is<br>
input into the apparatus for processing a decorrelated<br>
signal 414 (shaper). The shaper 414 is receiving a copy of<br>
the subband sample 416 as a second input. The inventive<br>
shaper 414 is performing the temporal envelope shaping ac-<br><br>
cording to the present invention and providing a shaped<br>
decorrelated signal to a first input of the upmixer 415<br>
that is additionally receiving the subband sample 416 at a<br>
second input. The upmixer 415 is deriving a left subband<br>
sample 417 and a right subband sample 418 from both the<br>
subband sample 416 and the shaped decorrelated sample.<br>
By integrating multiple signal processing blocks 404 for<br>
different subband samples, left and right subband samples<br>
can be calculated for each subband of a filterbank domain.<br>
In multi-channel implementations, signal procession is<br>
normally done in the QMF domain. It is also clear, given<br>
the above, that the final summation of the decorrelated<br>
signal and the direct version of the signal can be done as<br>
a final stage just prior to forming the actual recon-<br>
structed output signal. Hence, the shaping module can also<br>
be moved to be performed just prior to the addition of the<br>
two signal components, provided that the shaping module<br>
does not change the energy of the decorrelated signal as<br>
stipulated by the ICC and ILD parameters, but only modi-<br>
fies the short-term energies giving the decorrelated sig-<br>
nal a temporal envelope closely matching the direct sig-<br>
nal.<br>
Operating the present invention in the QMF subband domain<br>
prior to upmix and synthesis or operating the present in-<br>
vention in the time-domain, after upmix and synthesis are<br>
two different approaches both having their distinct advan-<br>
tages and disadvantages. The former being the simplest and<br>
requires the least amount of computations albeit limited<br>
to the time-resolution of the filterbank it is operating<br>
in. While the latter requires additional synthesis filter-<br>
banks and therefore additional computational complexity,<br>
it has complete degree of freedom when choosing time reso-<br>
lution.<br><br>
As already mentioned above, multi-channel decoders mostly<br>
perform the signal processing in the subband domain as<br>
shown in Fig. 8. There, a monophonic downmix signal 420,<br>
that is a downmix of a original 5.1 channel audio signal,<br>
is input into a QMF filterbank 421 that derives the sub-<br>
band representations of the monophonic signal 420. The ac-<br>
tual upmix and signal reconstruction is then performed by<br>
a signal processing block 422 in the subband domain. As<br>
final step, the original 5.1 channel signal, comprising a<br>
left-front channel 424a, a right-front channel 424b, a<br>
left-surround channel 424c, a right-surround channel 424d,<br>
a center channel 424e and a low-frequency enhancement<br>
channel 424f are derived by QMF synthesis.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a further embodiment of the present inven-<br>
tion, where the signal shaping is shifted to the time do-<br>
main, after the processing and the upmixing of a stereo-<br>
phonic signal has been done within the subband domain.<br>
A monophonic input signal 430 is input into a filterbank<br>
432, to derive the multiple subband representations of the<br>
monophonic signal 430. The signal processing and upmixing<br>
of the monophonic signal into 4 signals is done by a sig-<br>
nal processing block 434, deriving subband representations<br>
of a left dry signal 436a, a left wet signal 436b, a right<br>
dry signal 438a and a right wet signal 438b. After a QMF<br>
synthesis 440, a final left signal 442 can be derived from<br>
the left dry signal 436a and the left wet signal 436b us-<br>
ing an inventive apparatus for processing a decorrelated<br>
signal 200, operative in the time domain. In the same way,<br>
a final right signal 444 can be derived from the right dry<br>
signal 438a and the right wet signal 438b.<br>
As mentioned before, the present invention is not limited<br>
to be operated on a time domain signal. The inventive fea-<br>
ture of long-term spectral flattening in combination with<br>
the short-term energy estimation and adjustment can also<br>
be implemented in a subband filterbank. In the previously<br><br>
shown examples, a QMF filterbank is used, however, it<br>
should be understood that the invention is by no means<br>
limited to this particular filterbank representation. Ac-<br>
cording to the time domain implementation of the present<br>
invention, the signal used for estimation of the temporal<br>
envelope, i.e. the dry signal and the decorrelated signal<br>
going into the processing unit, are high-pass filtered, in<br>
the case of a QMF filterbank representation by means of<br>
setting QMF subbands to 0 in the lower-frequency range.<br>
The following paragraphs exemplify the use of the inven-<br>
tive concept in a QMF subband domain, where m denotes the<br>
subband, i.e. a frequency range of the original signal,<br>
and N denotes the sample number within the subband repre-<br>
sentation, and where the signal subband used for the long-<br>
term spectral flattening comprises N samples.<br>
Now assuming that<br><br>
where Qdry(m,n) and Qwet(m,n) are the QMF subband matrices<br>
holding the dry and the wet signal, and where Edry(m,n) and<br>
Ewet(m,n) are the corresponding energies for all subband<br>
samples. Here, m denotes the subband, starting at mstart be-<br>
ing chosen to correspond to approx 2kHz, and where n is<br>
the subband sample index running from zero to N, the num-<br>
ber of subband samples within a frame being, which is 32<br>
in one preferred embodiment, corresponding to approx 20ms.<br>
For both energy matrices above the spectral envelope is<br>
calculated as an average over all subband samples in the<br>
frame. This corresponds to the long term spectral enve-<br>
lope.<br><br><br><br>
Furthermore, the mean total energy over the frame is cal-<br>
culated according to:<br><br>
Based on the equations above, a flattening gain curve can<br>
be calculated for the two matrices:<br><br>
By applying the gain curve calculated above to the energy<br>
matrices for the wet and dry signal, long term spectrally<br>
flat energy matrices are obtained according to:<br><br>
The above energy matrices are used to calculate and apply<br>
the temporal envelope of the wet signal using the highest<br>
time resolution available in the QMF domain.<br><br>
From the above description of the present invention imple-<br>
mented in the subband domain, it is clear that the inven-<br>
tive step of doing the long term spectral whitening in<br>
combination with short term time envelope estimation, or<br><br>
short time energy estimation/adjustment is not limited to<br>
usage of LPC in the time domain.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, temporal<br>
envelope shaping is used in the subband domain in the fre-<br>
quency direction, to perform the inventive spectral flat-<br>
tening, before applying temporal envelope shaping to the<br>
wet signal.<br>
It is know from prior art that a signal represented in the<br>
frequency domain with low time resolution can be time en-<br>
velope shaped by filtering in the frequency direction of<br>
the frequency representation of the signal. This is used<br>
in perceptual audio codecs to shape introduced quantiza-<br>
tion noise of a signal represented in a long transform [J.<br>
Herre and J. D. Johnston, "Enhancing the performance of<br>
perceptual audio coding by using temporal noise shaping<br>
(TNS)," in 101st AES Convention, Los Angeles, November<br>
1996.].<br>
Assuming a QMF filterbank with 64 channels and a prototype<br>
filter of 640 samples, it is evident that the time resolu-<br>
tion of the QMF subband representation is not as high as<br>
when the temporal shaping is done in the time domain on<br>
windows in the ms range. One way of shaping a signal in<br>
the QMF domain with higher time resolution than natively<br>
available in the QMF, is to do linear prediction in the<br>
frequency direction. Hence, observing the dry signal in<br>
the QMF domain above for a certain QMF slot, i.e. for a<br>
subband sample n ,<br><br><br><br>
is the polynomial obtained using the autocorrelation<br>
method or the covariance method. Again it is important to<br>
note that contrary to LPC in the time-domain, as was out-<br>
lined earlier, the here estimated linear predictor is de-<br>
vised to predict the complex QMF subband samples in the<br>
frequency direction.<br>
In Fig 10, the time/frequency matrix of the QMF is dis-<br>
played. Every column corresponds to a QMF time-slot, i.e.<br>
a subband sample. The rows corresponds to the subbands. As<br>
is indicated in the figure, the estimation and application<br>
of the linear predictor takes place independently within<br>
every column. Furthermore, one column outlined in Fig 10<br>
correspond to one frame being processed. The frame size<br>
over which the whitening gain curves gwet(m) and gdry(m) are<br>
estimated is also indicated in the figure. A frame size of<br>
12 would for example mean processing 12 columns simultane-<br>
ously.<br>
In the previously described embodiment of the present in-<br>
vention, the linear prediction in the frequency direction<br>
is done in a complex QMF representation of the signal.<br>
Again, assuming a QMF filterbank with 64 channels and a<br>
prototype filter of 640 samples, and keeping in mind that<br>
the predictor operates on a complex signal, a very low<br>
order complex predictor is sufficient to track the tempo-<br>
ral envelope of the signal within the QMF slot where the<br>
predictor is applied. A preferred choice is predictor or-<br>
der 1.<br>
The estimated filter Hn corresponds to the temporal enve-<br>
lope of a QMF signal for the specific subband sample, i.e.<br>
a temporal envelope not available by just observing the<br>
subband sample (since only one sample is available). This<br><br>
sub-sample temporal envelope can be applied to the Qwet<br>
signal by filtering the signal in the frequency direction<br>
through the estimated filter, according to:<br><br>
where m is the QMF slot, or subband sample, used for pre-<br>
dictor estimation, and undergoing temporal shaping.<br>
Although the wet signal being produced by the decorrelator<br>
has a very flat temporal envelope, it is recommended to<br>
first remove any temporal envelope on the wet signal prior<br>
to applying that of the dry signal. This can be achieved<br>
by doing the same temporal envelope estimation using lin-<br>
ear prediction in the frequency direction as outlined<br>
above, albeit on the wet signal, and using the filter ob-<br>
tained to inverse filter the wet signal, thus removing any<br>
temporal envelope, prior to applying the temporal envelope<br>
of the dry signal.<br>
In order to get an as closely matching temporal envelope<br>
of the wet signal as possible, it is important that the<br>
estimate of the temporal envelope derived by means of the<br>
linear predictor in the frequency direction of the dry<br>
signal is as good as possible. The present invention<br>
teaches that the dry signal should undergo long term spec-<br>
tral flattening prior to the estimation of its temporal<br>
envelope by means of linear prediction. Hence, the previ-<br>
ously calculated gain curve<br><br>
should be applied to the dry signal used for temporal en-<br>
velope estimation according to:<br><br><br>
where n denotes the QMF slots, and m denotes the subband<br>
index. It is evident that the gain correction curve is the<br>
same for all subbands samples within the present frame be-<br>
ing processed. This is obvious since the gain curve corre-<br>
sponds to the required frequency selective gain adjustment<br><br>
in order to remove the long term spectral envelope. The<br>
obtained complex QMF representation is used for<br>
estimating the temporal envelope filter using linear pre-<br>
diction as outlined above.<br>
The additional time resolution offered by the LPC filter-<br>
ing aims at shaping the wet signal for transient dry sig-<br>
nals. However, due to the use of a limited dataset of one<br>
QMF slot for the LPC estimation there is still a risk that<br>
fine temporal shaping is applied in a chaotic fashion. To<br>
reduce this risk while keeping the performance for tran-<br>
sient dry signals, the LPC estimation can be smoothed over<br>
a few time slots. This smoothing has to take into consid-<br>
eration the evolution over time of the frequency direction<br>
covariance structure of the applied filter bank's analysis<br>
of an isolated transient event. Specifically, in the case<br>
of first order prediction and an oddly stacked complex<br>
modulated filter bank with a total oversampling factor of<br>
two, the smoothing taught by this invention consists of<br>
the following modification on the prediction coefficient<br>
an used in time slot n,<br><br>
where d≥1 defines the prediction block size in the time<br>
direction.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a transmission system for a 5.1 input chan-<br>
nel configuration, having a 5.1 channel encoder 600 that<br>
downmixes the 6 original channels into a downmix 602 that<br>
can be monophonic or comprise several discrete channels<br>
and additional spatial parameters 604. The downmix 602 is<br><br>
transmitted to the audio decoder 610 together with the<br>
spatial parameters 604.<br>
The decoder 610 is having one or more inventive appara-<br>
tuses for processing a decorrelated signal to perform an<br>
upmix of the downmix signal 602 including the inventive<br>
temporal shaping of the decorrelated signals. Thus, in<br>
such a transmission system, application of the inventive<br>
concept on a decoder side leads to an improved perceptual<br>
quality of the reconstructed 5.1 channel signal.<br>
The above-described embodiments of the present invention<br>
are merely illustrative for the principles of the present<br>
invention and for methods for improved temporal shaping of<br>
decorrelated signals. It is understood that modifications<br>
and variations of the arrangements and the details de-<br>
scribed herein will be apparent to others skilled in the<br>
art. It is the intent therefore, to be limited only by the<br>
scope of the impending patent claims, but not by the spe-<br>
cific details presented by way of description and explana-<br>
tion of the embodiments herein. It is also understood that<br>
the explanation of the present invention is carried-out by<br>
means of two channels and 5.1 channel examples, while it<br>
is obvious to others skilled in the art that the same<br>
principles apply for arbitrary channel configurations and,<br>
hence, the present invention is not limited to a specific<br>
channel configuration or embodiment with a specific number<br>
of in-/output channels. The present invention is applica-<br>
ble to any multi-channel reconstruction that utilises a<br>
decorrelated version of a signal and, hence, it is fur-<br>
thermore evident to those skilled in the art that the in-<br>
vention is not limited to the particular way of doing<br>
multi-channel reconstruction used in the exemplifications<br>
above.<br>
In short, the present invention primarily relates to<br>
multi-channel reconstruction of audio signals based on an<br>
available downmix signal and additional control data. Spa-<br><br>
tial parameters are extracted on the encoder side repre-<br>
senting the multi-channel characteristics given a downmix<br>
of the original channels. The downmix signal and the spa-<br>
tial representation is used in a decoder to recreate a<br>
close resembling representation of the original multi-<br>
channel signal, by means of distributing a combination of<br>
the downmix signal and a decorrelated version of the same<br>
to the channels being reconstructed. The invention is ap-<br>
plicable in systems where a backwards compatible downmix<br>
signal is desirable, such as stereo digital radio trans-<br>
mission (DAB, XM satellite radio etc), but also to systems<br>
that require a very compact representation of the multi-<br>
channel signal.<br>
The flattening of the spectrum was performed by inverse<br>
filtering based on filter coefficients derived by LPC<br>
analysis in the examples described above. It is understood<br>
that any further operation yielding a signal with a flat-<br>
tened spectrum is suited to be implemented to build a fur-<br>
ther embodiment of the present invention. The application<br>
would result in a reconstructed signal having the same ad-<br>
vantageous properties.<br>
Within a multi-channel audio decoder the place in the sig-<br>
nal path, where the present invention is applied, is ir-<br>
relevant for the inventive concept of improving the per-<br>
ceptual quality of a reconstructed audio signal using an<br>
inventive apparatus for processing a decorrelated signal.<br>
Although, in a preferred embodiment, only a high-pass fil-<br>
tered part of the wet signal is envelope-shaped according<br>
to the present invention, the present invention may also<br>
be applied on a wet signal having the full spectrum.<br>
The windowing functions, used to apply gain corrections to<br>
the long-term spectrally flattened signals as well as to<br>
the short-term envelope shaping gain factors are to be un-<br>
derstood as examples only. It is evident, that other win-<br><br>
dow functions may be used that allow for a smooth transi-<br>
tion of gain functions between neighbouring segments of<br>
the signal to be processed.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the<br>
inventive methods, the inventive methods can be imple-<br>
mented in hardware or in software. The implementation can<br>
be performed using a digital storage medium, in particular<br>
a disk, DVD or a CD having electronically readable control<br>
signals stored thereon, which cooperate with a programma-<br>
ble computer system such that the inventive methods are<br>
performed. Generally, the present invention is, therefore,<br>
a computer program product with a program code stored on a<br>
machine readable carrier, the program code being operative<br>
for performing the inventive methods when the computer<br>
program product runs on a computer. In other words, the<br>
inventive methods are, therefore, a computer program hav-<br>
ing a program code for performing at least one of the in-<br>
ventive methods when the computer program runs on a com-<br>
puter.<br>
While the foregoing has been particularly shown and de-<br>
scribed with reference to particular embodiments thereof,<br>
it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various other changes in the form and details may be made<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. It is<br>
to be understood that various changes may be made in adapt-<br>
ing to different embodiments without departing from the<br>
broader concepts disclosed herein and comprehended by the<br>
