				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a device for continuous dispensing of idli batter.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to a device wherein an idli batter depositor which can deposit a pre-determined quantity of batter (a ground mixture of rice and black-gram cotyledons) on to a moving pan continuously and consistently without tailing from the said batter deposit.<br>
Idli is popular breakfast staple food consumed in Indian subcontinent especially in southern parts. Idli is prepared from the mixture of raw rice and black gram cotyledons soaked in water at room temperature. The soaked mixture is ground to a coarse viscous batter with the addition of water and required quantity of salt to taste. The prepared batter is fermented overnight. The fermented batter deposited on to the idli pans for steam cooking. In this context, depositing the know the quantity accurately at the right time, at the right place, in hygienic manner and at the lowest cost possible is a very critical operation to derive an acceptable product.<br>
In olden days idlis were also produced traditionally using mud pots, wherein a mud pot was filled 1/4th of its volume with water, was kept on the open Chula fired with fire wood. The fermented batter was manually deposited in to the traditionally prepared round miniature bamboo basket with a piece of cloth spread on it in order to avoid stickiness and steaming in the pot. But in the present scenario, idlis are produced in a batch type as well as continuous process using stainless steel container with or without pressure. Reference may be made to Indian patent application of the same applicants No. 189303.<br>
The fermented batter is deposited manually with the help of a ladle on to the pan cradle or moving pans and steams cooked to produce idlis.<br>
With the growing demand for breakfast foods, the need for large scale production of idlis is felt by many catering institutions like Defense, Railways, Industrial canteens and<br><br><br><br>
Restaurants. In order to meet the large-scale production of idlis, batch type units are readily available in the market.<br>
In the patent application of the same applicants No. 950/DEL/94, a device was claimed for Continuous Production of Idlis capable of producing 1000-1200 idlis/hr.<br>
Large scale production of idlis with these machines is facing a major constraint in depositing the idli batter on to the pans cradle or moving pans manually, ie; a predetermined quantity at the right place, at the right time and in hygienic manner. This poses many problems like drudgery to the operator, unhygienic due to manual handling, inconsistent deposition, time consuming and the shape of the final product may not be as desired.<br>
There are a number of depositing machines commercially available in the market for volumetric filling/depositing of liquids/ materials such as milk, edible oils and bakery products. One such example is the single drop depositor. Reference may be made to Dominic Man, 1990, Process Engineering in the Food Industry, edited by R.W. Field &amp; J.A. Howell, published by Elsevier Applied Science, New York. Vol-2, pp 75-87. Wherein these machines are basically operated and controlled pneumatically. The machine essentially consists of a cylinder and a piston for measuring the deposit, and a mechanically operated rotary valve and facility for adjusting the speed and stroke length of the piston.<br>
Reference may be made to US. Patent No. 4494920, Positive Displacement Volumetric Depositor and A New Universal Depositor (Ann \ on, 1989) suitable for fruits, nuts, chocolate and minced meat and automatic butter dispenser (US patent No. 3437238). Yet another reference may be made to Nagaraju et al.(1999) No. 1976/Del/98. This machine is suitable for dispensing of idli batter and similar food materials, basically operated and controlled by electromagnetic solenoid. The machine essentially consists of a four-<br>
 chambered trough with valve stem and valve, and vertical movement of the valves with the help of the solenoid does deposition.<br>
Though the above machines can be used for idli batter, some of the drawbacks encountered are as follows:<br>
1.	Machines are complicated with the presence of pneumatic system and cylinder and piston arrangements.<br>
2.	Dismantling and cleaning of the system is difficult due to their complicated design.<br>
3.	Consumes more electrical energy and the cost is also high.<br>
4.	Presence of suck-back arrangement to the system for avoiding the trailing has made the machine costlier.<br>
5.	Presence of the electromagnetic solenoid makes more noise due to vibration while lifting the valve and releasing the valve and there is a possibility of valve to get struck during the operation while it is moving through a valve sleeve.<br>
6.	Occupies more space.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a device useful for continuous<br>
dispensing of idli batter and like materials, which obviate the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to eliminate the complicated design such as<br>
pneumatic system and suck-back arrangement and to provide a simple device for<br>
deposition.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an economically cheaper device<br>
for deposition of idli batter and similar materials.<br>
Still another object is to provide continuous and consistent operation of the unit for on-line<br>
production without noise, vibration, contaminated free deposition .<br><br>
This invention provides a device for continual dispensing of idli batter and like materials. The present invention more particularly provides a device wherein an idli batter depositor which can deposit a pre-determined quantity of batter (a ground mixture of rice and blackgram cotyledons) on to a moving pan continuously and consistently without tailing from the said batter deposit.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for continuous dispensing of idli batter, said device comprising:<br>
