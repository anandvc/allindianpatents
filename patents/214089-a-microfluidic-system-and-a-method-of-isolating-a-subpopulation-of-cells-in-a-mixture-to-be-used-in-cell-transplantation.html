Application Serial Number 60/411,058, filed September 16, 2002, the contents of<br>

also claims priority to, and is a continuation-in-part of, U. S. Patent Application<br>
Number 10/329,008, filed December 23, 2002, which is a Continuation-in-part of<br>
U.S. Patent Application 10/179,488, filed June 24, 2002 the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a microfludic system and a method of<br>
isolating a subpopulation of cells in a mixture to be used in cell transplantation<br>
where the input flow path of a sorting module can be split into several output<br>
channels. More particular, the invention relates to a particle sorting system in which<br>
a plurality of sorting modules are interconnected as to yield an increased particle<br>
throughput.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In the fields of biotechnology, and especially cytology and drug screening, there<br>
is a need for high throughput sorting of particles. Examples of particles that require<br>
sorting are various types of cells, such as blood platelets, white blood cells, tumorous<br>
cells, embryonic cells and the like. These particles are especially of interest in the field<br>
of cytology. Other particles are (macro) molecular species such as proteins, enzymes<br>
and polynucleotides. This family of particles is of particular interest in the field of drug<br>
screening during the development of new drugs.<br>
Methods and apparatus for particle sorting are known, and the majority described<br>
in the prior art work in the condition where the particles are suspended in a liquid<br>
flowing through a channel network having at least a branch point downstream and are<br>
operated according to the detect-decide-deflect principle. The moving particle is first<br>
analyzed for a specific characteristic, such as optical absorption, fluorescent intensity,<br>
size etc. Depending on the outcome of this detection phase, it is decided how the<br>
particle will be handled further downstream. The outcome of the decision is then applied<br>
to deflect the direction of specific particle towards a predetermined branch of the<br>
channel network.<br>
Of importance is the throughput of the sorting apparatus, i.e. how many particles<br>
can be sorted per unit of time. Typical sorting rates for sorters employing flows of<br>
particle suspension in closed channels are in the range from a few hundred particles per<br>
second to thousands of particles per second, for a single sorting unit.<br>
An example of a sorting device is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,175,662, the<br>
contents of which are herein incorporated by reference (hereinafter referred to as the<br>
"662 patent). In the "662 patent, a flow of particles, cells in this case, flows through the<br>
center of a straight channel, which branches into two perpendicular channels at a<br>
branching point downstream (T-branch). The entering particles are surrounded by a<br>
sheath of compatible liquid, keeping the particles confined to the center of the channel.<br>
In normal conditions, the flow ratio through the two branches is adjusted so that the<br>
particles automatically flow through one of the branches, m a section of the channel a<br>
characteristic of the particles is determined using a detector, which can be an optical<br>
system (detection phase). The detector generates a signal when the detector detects a<br>
particle possessing a predetermined characteristic in the decision phase. Once a particle<br>
is detected, a deflector is activated for deflecting the particle in a deflection phase. In<br>
this case, the deflector comprises an electrode pair, positioned in the branch of the<br>
channel where the particles normally flow through in the inactivated state of the<br>
deflector. By the application of current pulses, the aqueous liquid is electrolysed,<br>
yielding a gas bubble evolving between the electrode pair. As the gas bubble increases<br>
in size, the flow rate through this branch is reduced during the evolving phase. After the<br>
current pulse is applied, the bubble growth stops and the gas bubble is carried along with<br>
the flow. As a result, the flow through the specific branch is momentarily reduced and<br>
the particle of interest changes paths and flows down the other branch.<br>
The device of the "662 patent is effective for sorting particles. However one<br>
serious drawback is that gas bubbles are created which potentially can accumulate at<br>
certain points of the fluidic network. This bubble generation can clog the flow channels,<br>
yielding erroneous sorting. Another drawback is that the generated gasses (mostly<br>
oxygen and hydrogen) and ionic species (mostly OH- and H+) influence the particles<br>
flowing through the branch with the electrode pair. In addition, cells and delicate<br>
proteins such as enzymes are very fragile and can be destroyed by the fouling<br>
constituents co-generated with the gas bubble. Another drawback is the complexity of<br>
the overall sorting apparatus. In particular, the micro electrode construction is very<br>
complex to mount and assemble in the small channels of the system. As a result, tne<br>
cost of a sorting unit is relatively large.<br>
Another example of a particle sorting system of the prior art is disclosed in U.S.<br>
3,984,307, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference (hereinafter the<br>
"307 patent). In the "307 patent, the particles are flowing, confined by a flowing sheath<br>
liquid, through the center of a channel. After passing a detector section, the channel<br>
branches into two channels forming an acute angle therebetween (e.g., Y-branch). Just<br>
before the branching point, an electrically activated transducer is located in the channel<br>
for deflecting a specific particle having an appropriate, predetermined characteristic.<br>
The transducer described is a piezo actuator or ultrasonic transducer, yielding upon<br>
electrical activation a pressure wave in the channel- The generated pressure wave<br>
momentarily disturbs the flow in one branch thus deflecting the partible of interest into<br>
the other branch.<br>
In the device of the "307 patent, as in the previous discussed device, the deflector<br>
is incorporated within the channel system, resulting in relatively large construction<br>
costs. Another drawback of this device is the deflector principle used. The generated<br>
pressure waves are not confined to the branching point, but rather propagate upstream<br>
into the detector section, as well as down both branches. This influences the overall<br>
flow through the channel. This is particularly a drawback if sorters of this type are<br>
connected either in series or in parallel, as is typically done to construct a high<br>
throughput sorting system. Pressure waves generated in one sorter can then influence<br>
the flows and deflection of particles in neighboring sorter units.<br>
Another sorter is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,756,427, the contents of which<br>
are herein incorporated by reference. This sorter is analogous to the sorter in the "662<br>
patent. In this case, however, the flow in one branch is disturbed by momentarily<br>
changing the resistance of the branch. The resistance is changed by changing the height<br>
of the branch channel by an external actuator. In the preferred embodiment, this<br>
external actuator is a piezo disc glued on top of the channel, causing it to move<br>
downwards upon activation.<br>
Although the construction of the sorter described in the "427 patent is less<br>
complex than the previously described sorter structures, it is still problematic to couple<br>
multiple sorter modules of the described type together to increase the sorting rate. This<br>
is, as in the sorter described in the "307 patent because of the generated pressure waves<br>
causing interference with other sorter modules.<br>
Another particle sorting device is described in U.S. Patent Number 5,837,200,<br>
the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. The "200 patent describes a<br>
sorting device that uses a magnetic deflection module to classify or select particles based<br>
on their magnetic properties. The "200 patent further describes processing and<br>
separating individual particle streams in parallel.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a method and apparatus for sorting particles<br>
moving through a closed channel system of capillary size. The particle sorting system of<br>
the invention provides a sorting module that can be assembled at low cost while<br>
providing an accurate means of sorting large amounts of particles per unit of time. The<br>
particle sorting system may include a plurality of closely coupled sorting modules which<br>
arecombined to further increase the sorting rate. The particle sorting system may<br>
comprise a multi-stage sorting device for serially sorting streams of particles, in order to<br>
decrease the error rate.<br>
The particle sorting system implements an improved fluidic particle switching<br>
method and switching device according to the present invention. The particle sorting<br>
system comprises a closed channel system of capillary size for sorting particles. The<br>
channel system comprises a first supply duct for introducing a stream of particles and a<br>
second supply duct for supplying a carrier liquid. The first supply duct forms a nozzle<br>
to introduce a stream of particles into the flow of carrier liquid. The first supply duct<br>
and the second supply duct are in fluid communication with a measurement duct, which<br>
branches into a first branch and a second branch at a branch point. A measurement<br>
region is defined in the measurement duct and is associated with a detector to sense a<br>
predetermined characteristic of particles in the measurement region. Two opposed<br>
bubble valves are positioned in communication with the measurement duct and are<br>
spaced opposite each other. The bubble valves communicate with the measurement duct<br>
through a pair of opposed side passages. Liquid is allowed to partly fill these side<br>
passages to form a meniscus therein which interfaces the carrier liquid with the reservoir<br>
of the bubble valves. An external actuator is also provided for actuating one of the<br>
bubble valves. When the external actuator is activated, the pressure in the reservoir of<br>
the activated bubble valve increases, deflecting the meniscus and causing a flow<br>
disturbance in the measurement duct to deflect the flow therein.<br>
When a sensor located in the measuring region senses a predetermined<br>
characteristic in a particle flowing through the measurement region, the sensor produces<br>
a signal in response to the sensed characteristic. The external actuator is responsive to<br>
the sensor to cause a pressure pulse in a compression chamber of a first bubble valve to<br>
deflect the particle with the predetermined characteristic, causing the selected particle to<br>
flow down the second branch duct.<br>
In one aspect, the invention comprises a method of sorting particles including the<br>
steps of providing a measurement duct having an inlet and a branching point at which<br>
the duct separates into two branch ducts, and conducting a stream of fluid into the duct<br>
inlet with a stream of particles suspended therein, such that the particles normally flow<br>
through a first one of the branch ducts and providing upstream from the branching point<br>
two opposing side passages for momentarily deflecting the stream in the duct. A first<br>
one of the side passages is hydraulically connected to a compression chamber of a first<br>
bubble valve, which is acted upon by an external actuator for varying the pressure<br>
therein. A second of the side passages is hydraulically connected with a buffer chamber<br>
of a second bubble valve for absorbing pressure variations. The method further<br>
comprises providing a measurement station along the measurement duct upstream of the<br>
side passages for sensing a predetermined characteristic of particles in the stream and for<br>
producing a signal when the predetermined characteristic is sensed. The method further<br>
comprises the step of, in response to sensing the predetermined characteristic, activating<br>
the external actuator for creating a flow disturbance in the duct between the side<br>
passages, thereby deflecting the particle having the predetermined characteristics and<br>
causing the selected particle to flow down the second branch duct.<br>
In further aspects of the invention, the particle sort rate is respectively increased<br>
or the type of particles sorted being increased, by respectively connecting a plurality of<br>
sorting modules in parallel or serially connecting a plurality of sorting modules in a<br>
binary tree like configuration.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, a particle sorting system is provided.<br>
The particles sorting system comprises a first duct for conveying a stream of suspended<br>
particles confined in a carrier liquid, comprising an inlet, a first outlet and a second<br>
outlet, a sensor for sensing a predetermined characteristic in a particle, a side channel in<br>
communication with the first duct, a sealed chamber positioned adjacent to the side<br>
channel, wherein the carrier fluid forms a meniscus in the side channel to separate the<br>
sealed chamber from the carrier fluid; and an actuator. The actuator modifies the<br>
pressure in the sealed chamber to deflect the meniscus when the sensor senses the<br>
predetermined characteristic. The deflection of the meniscus causes the particle having<br>
the predetermined characteristic to flow into the second outlet while particles that do not<br>
have the predetermined characteristic flow into the first outlet.<br>
It is contemplated that the present invention will be of major value in high-<br>
throughput screening; e.g., in screening a large number of candidate compounds for<br>
activity against one or more cell types. It has particular value, for example, in screening<br>
synthetic or natural product libraries for active compounds or biochemical<br>
characterization.<br>
It is also contemplated that the present invention will be of major value in high-<br>
throughput screening of a sample for a plurality of molecules, such as biological<br>
molecules. The present invention can be used to screen a sample for the presence of a<br>
large number of biological molecules such as polypeptides, receptor ligands, enzymatic<br>
substrates, agonists or antagonists of enzymatic or receptor activity, or nucleic acids.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a particle sorting system for sorting particles<br>
suspended in a liquid. The particle sorting system provides high-throughput, low error<br>
sorting of particles based on a predetermined characteristic. The present invention will<br>
be described below relative to illustrative embodiments. Those skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that the present invention may be implemented in a number of different<br>
applications and embodiments and is not specifically limited in its application to the<br>
particular embodiments depicted herein.<br>
The terms "duct" "channel" and "flow channel" as used herein refers to a<br>
pathway formed in or through a medium that allows for movement of fluids, such as<br>
liquids and gases. The channel in the microfluidic system preferably have cross-<br>
sectional dimensions in the range between about 1.0 µm and about 500 µm, preferably<br>
between about 25 µm and about 250 µm and most preferably between about 50 µm and<br>
about 150 µm. One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine an appropriate<br>
volume and length of the flow channel. The ranges are intended to include the above-<br>
recited values as upper or lower limits. The flow channel can have any selected shape or<br>
arrangement, examples of which include a linear or non-linear configuration and a U-<br>
shaped configuration.<br>
The term "particle" refers to a discrete unit of matter, including, but not limited<br>
to cells.<br>
The term "sensor" as used herein refers to a device for measuring a characteristic<br>
of an object, such as a particle.<br>
The term "bubble valve" as used herein refers to a device that generates pressure<br>
pulses to control flow through a channel.<br>
The term "carrier fluid" as used herein refers to a sheath of compatible liquid<br>
surrounding a particle for carrying one or more particles through a duct or channel.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic depiction of a particle sorting system 10 according to the<br>
teachings of the present invention. According to one application of the present<br>
invention, the particle sorting system 10 comprises a closed channel system of capillary<br>
. size for sorting particles. The channel system comprises a first supply duct 12 for<br>
introducing a stream of particles 18 and a second supply duct 14 for supplying a carrier<br>
liquid. The first supply duct 12 forms a nozzle 12a, and a stream of particles is<br>
introduced into the flow of the carrier liquid. The first supply duct 12 and the second<br>
supply duct 14 are in fluid communication with a measurement duct 16 for conveying<br>
the particles suspended in the carrier liquid. The measurement duct branches into a first<br>
branch channel 22a and a second branch channel 22b at a branch point 21. A<br>
measurement region 20 is defined in the measurement duct 16 and is associated with a<br>
detector 19 to sense a predetermined characteristic of the particles passing through the<br>
measurement region 20. Two opposed bubble valves 100a and 100b are positioned<br>
relative to the measurement duct and disposed in fluid communication therewith. The<br>
valves are spaced opposite each other, although those of ordinary skill will realize that<br>
other configurations can also be used. The bubble valves 100a and 100b communicate<br>
with the measurement duct 16 through a pair of opposed side passages 24a and 24b,<br>
respectively. Liquid is allowed to partly fill these side passages 24a and 24b to form a<br>
meniscus 25 therein. The meniscus defines an interface between the carrier liquid and<br>
another fluid, such as a gas in the reservoir of the associated bubble valve 100. An<br>
actuator 26 is also provided for actuating either bubble valve, which momentarily causes<br>
a flow disturbance in the duct to deflect the flow therein when activated by the actuator<br>
26. As illustrated, the actuator is coupled to the bubble valve 100b. The second bubble<br>
valve 100a serves as a buffer for absorbing the pressure pulse created by the first bubble<br>
valve 100b.<br>
The first side passage 24b is hydraulically connected to a compression chamber<br>
70b in the first bubble valve 100b, so that if the pressure in this chamber is increased,<br>
the flow in the measurement duct near the side passage is displaced inwards,<br>
substantially perpendicular to the normal flow in the duct. The second side passage 24a,<br>
positioned opposite of the first side passage 24b is hydraulically connected to a buffer<br>
chamber 70a in the second bubble valve 100a for absorbing pressure transients. This<br>
first side passage 24b co-operates with the second side passage 24a to direct the before<br>
mentioned liquid displacement caused by pressurizing the compression chamber 70b, so<br>
that the displacement has a component perpendicular to the normal flow of the particles<br>
through the measurement duct<br>
Upon pressurizing the compression chamber 70b an amount of liquid is<br>
transiently discharged from the first side passage 24b. The resiliency of the second side<br>
passage 24a results upon a pressurized discharge, in a transient flow of the liquid in the<br>
duct into the second side passage 24a. The co-operation of the two side passages and the<br>
fluidic structures they interconnect causes the flow through the measurement duct 16 to<br>
be transiently moved sideways back and forth upon pressurizing and depressurising of<br>
the compression chamber 70b induced by the external actuator 26 in response to the<br>
signal raised by the detection means 19. This transient liquid displacement, having a<br>
component perpendicular to the normal flow in the duct, can be applied in deflecting<br>
particles having predetermined characteristics to separate them from the remaining<br>
particles in the mixture.<br>
As shown, the measurement duct 16 branches at the branch point 21 into two<br>
branches 22a, 22b and the flow rates in these branches are adjusted so that the particles<br>
normally stream through the second of the two branches 22b. The angle between the<br>
branches 22a, 22b is between 0 and 180 degrees, and preferably between 10 and 45<br>
degrees. However, the angle can even be 0 degrees, which corresponds to two parallel<br>
ducts with a straight separation wall between them.<br>
The particles to be sorted are preferably supplied to a measurement position in a<br>
central fluid current, which is surrounded by a particle free liquid sheath. The process of<br>
confining a particle stream is known, and often referred to as a "sheath flow"<br>
configuration. Normally, confinement is achieved by injecting a stream of suspended<br>
particles through a narrow outlet nozzle into a particle free carrier liquid flowing in the<br>
duct 16. By adjusting the ratio of flow rates of the suspension and carrier liquid, the<br>
radial confinement in the duct as well as the inter particle distance can be adjusted. A<br>
relatively large flow rate of the carrier liquid results in a more confined particle stream<br>
having a large distance between the particles.<br>
In a suspension introduced by the first supply duct 12, two types of particles can<br>
be distinguished, normal particles 18a and particles of interest 18b. Upon sensing the<br>
predetermined characteristic in a particle 18b in the measurement region 20, the detector<br>
19 raises a signal. The external actuator 26 activates the first actuator bubble valve 100b,<br>
when signaled by the detector 19 in response to sensing the predetermined characteristic,<br>
to create a flow disturbance in the measurement duct 16 between the side passages 24a,<br>
24b. The flow disturbance deflects the particle 18b having the predetermined<br>
characteristic so that it flows down the first branch duct 22a rather than the second<br>
branch duct 22b. The detector communicates with the actuator 26, so that when the<br>
detector 19 senses a predetermined characteristic in a particle, the actuator activates the<br>
first bubble valve 100b to cause pressure variations in the reservoir 70b of the first<br>
bubble valve. The activation of the first bubble valves deflects the meniscus 25b in the<br>
first bubble valve 100b and causes a transient pressure variation in the first side passage<br>
24b. The second side passage 24a and the second bubble valve 100a absorb the transient<br>
pressure variations in the measurement duct 16 induced via the actuator 26. Basically,<br>
the reservoir 70a of the second bubble valve 100a is a buffer chamber having a resilient<br>
wall or containing a compressible fluid, such as a gas. The resilient properties allow the<br>
flow of liquid from the measurement duct into the second side passage 24a, allowing the<br>
pressure pulse to be absorbed and preventing disturbance to the flow of the non-selected<br>
particles in the stream of particles.<br>
At the measurement region 20, individual particles are inspected, using a suitable<br>
sensor 19, for a particular characteristic, such as size, form, fluorescent intensity, as well<br>
as other characteristics obvious to one of ordinary skill. Examples of applicable sensor,<br>
known in the art, are various types of optical detection systems such as microscopes,<br>
machine vision systems and electronic means for measuring electronic properties of the<br>
particles. Particularly well known systems in the field are systems for measuring the<br>
fluorescent intensity of particles. These systems comprise a light source having a<br>
suitable wavelength for inducing fluorescence and a detection system for measuring the<br>
intensity of the induced fluorescent light. This approach is often used in combination<br>
with particles that are labelled with a fluorescent marker, i.e. an attached molecule that<br>
upon illuminating with light of a particular first wavelength produces light at another<br>
particular second wavelength (fluorescence). If this second wavelength light is detected,<br>
the characteristic is sensed and a signal is raised.<br>
Other examples include the measurement of light scattered by particles flowing<br>
through the measurement region. Interpreting the scattering yield information on the size<br>
and form of particles, which can be adopted to raise a signal when a predetermined<br>
characteristic is detected.<br>
The actuator 26 for pressurizing the compression chamber of the first bubble<br>
valve can comprise an external actuator that responds to a signal from the sensor that a<br>
particle has a selected predetermined characteristic. There are two classes of external<br>
actuators that are suitable for increasing the pressure. The first class directly provides a<br>
gas pressure to the liquid in the first side passage 24b. For example, the actuator may<br>
comprise a source of pressurized gas connected with a switching valve to the liquid<br>
column in the side passage 24b. Activation of the switch connects the passage to the<br>
source of pressurized gas, which deflects the meniscus in the liquid. Upon deactivation,<br>
the switch connects the passage 24b back to the normal operating pressure.<br>
Alternatively, a displacement actuator may be used in combination with a closed<br>
compression chamber having a movable wall. When the displacement actuator displaces<br>
the wall of the compression chamber inward, the pressure inside increases. If the<br>
movable wall is displaced back to the original position, the pressure is reduced back to<br>
the normal operating pressure. An example of a suitable displacement actuator is an<br>
electromagnetic actuator, which causes displacement of a plunger upon energizing a<br>
coil. Another example is the use of piezoelectric material, for example in the form of a<br>
cylinder or a stack of disks, which upon the application of a voltage produces a linear<br>
displacement. Both types of actuators engage the movable wall of the compression<br>
chamber 70 to cause pressure variations therein.<br>
Figures 2 through 4 illustrate the switching operation of switch 40 in the particle<br>
sorting system 10 of Figure 1. In Figure 2, the detector 19 senses the predetermined<br>
characteristic in a particle and generates a signal to activate the actuator 26. Upon<br>
activation of the actuator, the pressure within the reservoir 70b of the first bubble valve<br>
100b is increased, deflecting the meniscus 25b and causing a transient discharge of<br>
liquid from the first side passage 24b, as indicated by the arrow. The sudden pressure<br>
increase caused at this point in the duct causes liquid to flow into the second side<br>
passage 24a, because of the resilient properties of the reservoir of the second bubble<br>
valve 100a. This movement of liquid into the second side passage 24a is indicated with<br>
an arrow. As a result, as can be seen in the figure, the flow through the measurement<br>
duct 16 is deflected, causing the selected particle of interest 18b located between the first<br>
side passage 24b and the second side passage 24a to be shifted perpendicular to its flow<br>
direction in the normal state. The flow resistances to the measurement duct 16, the first<br>
branch 22a and the second branch 22b is chosen so that the preferred direction of the<br>
flow to and from the first side passage 24b and the second side passage 24a has an<br>
appreciable component perpendicular to the normal flow through the measurement duct<br>
16. This goal can for instance be reached by the first branch 22a and the second branch<br>
22b so that their resistances to flow is large in comparison with the flow resistances of<br>
the first side passage 24b and the second side passage 24a.<br>
Figure 3 shows the particle sorting system 10 during the relief of the first bubble<br>
valve reservoir when the particle of interest 18b has left the volume between the first<br>
side passage 24b and the second side passage 24a. The actuator 26 is deactivated,<br>
causing the pressure inside the reservoirs 70a, 70b to return to the normal pressure.<br>
During this relief phase there is a negative pressure difference between the two<br>
reservoirs 70a, 70b of the bubble valves, causing a liquid flow through the first side<br>
passage 24b and the second side passage 24a opposite to the liquid flow shown in the<br>
previous figure and as indicated by the arrows.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the particle sorting system 10 after completion of the<br>
switching sequence. The pressures inside the reservoirs of the bubble valves are<br>
equalized, allowing the flow through the measurement duct 16 to normalize. As the<br>
particle of interest 18b has been displaced radially, it will flow into the first branch 22a,<br>
while the other particle continue to flow into the second branch 22b, thereby separating<br>
the particles based on the predetermined characteristic.<br>
This process of detecting and selective deflecting of particles may be repeated<br>
many times per second for sorting particles at a high rate. Adopting the fluid switching<br>
as described, switching operations may be executed up to around several thousand<br>
switching operations per second, yielding sorting rates in the order of million sorted<br>
particles per hour.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the actuator bubble valve<br>
100a and the buffer bubble valve 100b maybe placed in different positions. For<br>
example, as shown in Figure 5, the actuator bubble valve 100a and the first side passage<br>
24a and/or the buffer bubble valve 100b and the second side passage 24b may be place<br>
upstream from the branch point 21. The components may be placed in any suitable<br>
location, such that the flow resistance between the actuator chamber 70a and the buffer<br>
chamber 70b is less than the flow resistance between any of these latter components and<br>
other pressure sources. More particularly, the actuator chamber 70a and the buffer<br>
chamber 70b may be placed such that the flow resistance between them is less than the<br>
flow resistance between a selected particle and a subsequent particle in the stream of<br>
particles. The positioning of the components in this manner thus prevents a pressure<br>
wave generated by the above-described method of deflecting a single selected particle,<br>
from travelling upstream or downstream and affecting the flow of the remaining<br>
particles in the stream of particles. A larger difference in flow resistances results in a<br>
higher level of isolation of the fluidic switching operation with associated pressure<br>
transients from the flow characteristics in the rest of the system. Moreover, the in-situ<br>
dampening of generated pressure pulses applied for sorting allows the implementation of<br>
sorting networks comprising a plurality of switches 40, each of which is hydraulically<br>
and pneumatically isolated from the others.<br>
According to another embodiment, shown in Figure 6, the particle sorting system<br>
of the present invention may use any suitable pressure wave generator (in place of a<br>
bubble valve) in combination one or more bubble valves serving as a buffer, such as<br>
valve 100b. For example, the pressure wave generator 260 may comprise an actuator<br>
such as a piezoelectric column or a stepper motor, provided with a plunger that can act<br>
upon the flowing liquid, either directly or via deflection of the channel system, to<br>
selectively deflect particles when the actuator is activated by a signal. Other suitable<br>
pressure wave generators include electromagnetic actuators, thermopneumatic actuators<br>
and a heat pulse generator for generating vapor bubbles in the flowing liquid by<br>
applying heat pulses. The buffer bubble valve 100b is positioned to absorb the pressure<br>
wave created by the pressure wave generator 260 to prevent flow disturbance in the<br>
other particles of the particle stream. The spring constant of the buffer 100b may be<br>
varied according to the particular requirements by varying the volume of the buffer<br>
chamber 70b, the cross-sectional area of the side passage 24b and/or the stiffness or the<br>
thickness of a flexible membrane (reference 72 in Figure 7) forming the buffer chamber<br>
70b.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates an embodiment of a valve 100 suitable for creating a pressure<br>
pulse to separate particles of interest from other particles in a stream of particles and/or<br>
acting as a buffer for absorbing a pressure pulse according to the teachings of the present<br>
invention. As shown, the valve 100 is formed adjacent to a side passage 24a or 24b<br>
formed in a substrate which leads to the measurement duct 16. The side passage 24a<br>
includes a fluid interface port 17 formed by an aperture in the side wall of the passage.<br>
A sealed compression chamber 70 is positioned adjacent to the side passage 24a and<br>
communicates with the side passage through the fluid interface port. The illustrative<br>
chamber 70 is formed by a seal 71 and a flexible membrane 72. The carrier fluid in the<br>
side passage 24a forms a meniscus 25 at the interface between the side passage and the<br>
chamber. The actuator 26 depresses the flexible membrane to increase the pressure in<br>
the chamber, which deflects the meniscus and causes a pressure pulse in the carrier fluid.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a sorting module 50 having an appropriate supply duct 52 for<br>
providing a stream of particles to be sorted as well as a first outlet duct 54 and a second<br>
outlet duct 56, either of which can carry the particles sorted in the sorting module 50.<br>
The sorting module 50 comprises a detector system 19 for sensing particles entering the<br>
sorting module 50 via the supply duct 52 can be operationally connected to a switch 40<br>
for providing the required switching capabilities to sort particles. The first branch 22b<br>
and the second branch 22a, Figure 1, can be disposed in fluidic connection with the<br>
outlet duct 54 and the second outlet duct 56.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a particle sorting system 500 according to an alternate embodiment<br>
of the invention, comprising a plurality of sorting modules 50 that can be coupled<br>
together in any appropriate configuration. For example, the modules 50 in this<br>
embodiment are coupled in parallel. The outlet ducts 54 of the sorting modules 50 are<br>
 coupled to a first combined outlet 58, the second outlet ducts 56 are coupled to a second<br>
combined outlet 60. The parallel arrangement of sorting modules yields a system of<br>
combined sorting module 50 having an overall sorting rate of N times the sorting rate of<br>
an individual sorting module 50, where N is the number of parallel connected sorting<br>
module 50.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a particle sorting system 550 according to another embodiment,<br>
comprising a first sorting module 50a in series with a second sorting module 50b. The<br>
second sorting module 50b may be equipped for sorting particles having a<br>
predetermined characteristic the same or different than the predetermined characteristic<br>
of the particles sorted by the first sorting module 50a. The particle stream enters the first<br>
sorting module 50a through the supply duct 52 and may contain at least two types of<br>
particles. A first type of particle is sorted in the first sorting module 50a and exits<br>
through the first outlet duct 54a. The remaining particles exit the first sorting module<br>
50a through second outlet duct 56a and are introduced into the second sorting module<br>
50b via the second supply duct 52b. From this stream of particles, particles having the<br>
other predetermined characteristic are sorted and exit through the second outlet duct 54b<br>
Particles that posses neither of the two predetermined characteristics exit the second<br>
sorting module 50b via the second outlet duct 56b. Those of ordinary skill will readily<br>
recognize that any suitable type of sorting module 50 can be used, and can be coupled<br>
together in a variety of ways, depending upon the desired results.<br>
Figure 11 shows a hierarchical architecture for high throughput-low error sorting<br>
according to another embodiment of the present invention. The illustrated embodiment<br>
is a two-stage particle sorting system 800 for sorting a plurality of parallel particles<br>
streams in a first stage, aggregating the outputs of the first stage and then performing a<br>
secondary sorting process on the output of the first stage. An input stream of particles in<br>
suspension 80 from a particle input chamber 88 is split among N single sorting channels<br>
81a-81n, each channel being capable of sorting a selected number of particles per<br>
second. Each channel 81 includes a detection region 84 for examining the particles and<br>
identifying particles that have a predetermined characteristic, and a switching region 82<br>
for separating the particles having the predetermined characteristic from the other<br>
particles in the stream, as described above. The switching region 82 produces two<br>
output streams of particles: a "selected" stream and a "rejected" stream in its switching<br>
region 82 based on the measured particle characteristics at the detection region 84. The<br>
"selected" streams from each channel are aggregated in an aggregation region 86 into<br>
one stream to be sorted again in a secondary sorting channel 810. As shown, the<br>
secondary sorting channel 810 repeats the sorting process of detecting and sorting based<br>
on a predetermined characteristic.<br>
Given that each single channel sorting process produces some error (y) rate (y is<br>
a probability less than one of a particle being "selected" by mistake) of mistaken<br>
selections, the hierarchical architecture produces an lower error rate of y2 for a 2-stage<br>
hierarchy as drawn or yn for an n-stage hierarchy. For example, if the single channel<br>
error rate is 1% the 2-stage error rate is 0.01% or one part in 104.<br>
Alternatively, the architecture could have M primary sets of N sorting channels<br>
per secondary channel. Given that the application wants to capture particles that have a<br>
presence in the input at rate z and single channel sorters have a maximum sorting rate x<br>
particles per second. The system throughput is M*N*x in particles per second. The<br>
number of particles aggregated in N channels per second is N*x*z and so N*z must be<br>
less than 1 so that all particles aggregated from N channels can be sorted by a single<br>
secondary channel. To increase throughput above N=1/z one must add parallel groups<br>
of N primary + 1 secondary channels. Overall throughput then comes from M*N*x with<br>
M secondary channels.<br>
Figure 12 show a parallel-serial particle sorting system 160 according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. The parallel-serial particle sorting system 160 includes a<br>
first parallel sorting module 161 and a second parallel sorting module 162. The first<br>
sorting module 161 is applied in multiple marked particles and particles having both<br>
markers are sorted out and conveyed through the exit channel 165.<br>
Figure 13 shows another parallel-serial particle sorting system 170. The first<br>
parallel sorting module 171 separates particles having a first marker, collects the<br>
particles from the different channels and conveys the particles having the first marker<br>
through the first exit channel 175. All other particles are then fed into a second parallel<br>
sorter 172 for sorting particles having a second marker. The particles having the second<br>
marker are collected and conveyed through a second exit channel 176. Particles having<br>
neither the first marker nor the second marker are conveyed through a third exit channel<br>
177.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, shown in Figures 14a and 14b,<br>
the particle sorting system may include sensors for measuring velocity, location and/or<br>
size of particles. The measurement of velocity, location and/or size may be made<br>
simultaneously with classification of the particles for sorting or at a different time. In<br>
parallel channel based systems, as shown in Figure 11, the different channels may have<br>
different flow resistances, causing the velocity of the particles or cells in each channel to<br>
be different. In systems where the detection region 84 is separated from the switching<br>
region 82 by a distance L, the velocity of the particles in the channel 81 must be known<br>
in order to set the switching time delay T (i.e., the time to delay switch actuation relative<br>
to the moment of detection of a target particle).<br>
In most optical systems for detecting cells or particles, the region in which the<br>
cell creates light on the photo detector in the detection region will have a much greater<br>
size than the size of a cell diameter. Therefore, when light is detected in the detection<br>
region, the cell may be anywhere in the region, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact<br>
location of the cell. To provide more accurate detection, many pixels of an optical<br>
detector could be packed across the detection region, but this would have a large cost<br>
and require complex support electronics.<br>
According to an illustrative embodiment of the invention, an optical mask 140<br>
may be added to the detection region to provide accurate velocity detection by<br>
depositing a "masking pattern" directly on the sorting chip. The masking patterns can be<br>
deposited so that an edge in the masking pattern is precisely located (to 
with current technology) relative to the cell sorting actuator region 82. A single optical<br>
detector catching light from the cell in the detection region 84 will see light when the<br>
cell is not masked. The duration of the light being turned off by one of the connected<br>
opaque parts "bars" of the mask of known length gives a measurement of velocity.<br>
A mask pattern that has several bars 141 of size ranging from 10um to 30um in<br>
lum steps results in only bars of size larger than the cell minimizing the signal from the<br>
cell. Therefore, such a pattern can also be used to measure the size of the cell<br>
independently of its signal. Such a "gradient mask" also produces a pattern in the optical<br>
detector that can be analyzed to measure velocity several times for reducing the variance<br>
in the velocity estimate. The pattern in the light induced by the mask 140 also allows<br>
the detector to identify each edge in. the mask 140. If the bars 141 were all the same, the<br>
light signal for each bar would be the same, and one could only tell them apart by<br>
sequence. Therefore, a gradient mask pattern will allow a single detector looking at a<br>
broad region (several times the size of a cell) to measure the velocity of the cell, measure<br>
the exact position inside the detection region 84 with about lum precision relative to the<br>
channel structures and the actuator location on chip and identify the size of the cell to<br>
precision given by the gradient pattern. The gradient mask 140 allows the detector to<br>
measure these parameters independent of the magnification of the optical system or the<br>
nature of the optical detector itself.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that other devices for measuring the size,<br>
position and or velocity of a particle in the sorting system in accordance with the<br>
teachings of the invention. Suitable devices are readily available and known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
According to another embodiment, shown in Figure 15, the particle sorting<br>
system comprises an array 8000 of non-identical sorting channels. The use of a parallel<br>
array comprising a series of non-identical sorter channels 810a-810n is more efficient in<br>
terms of space, use of optical power and adaptation to optimal external actuators. Since<br>
the velocity of particles can be accurately sensed, the channels do not require a fixed<br>
delay between the detection of a property and actuation of a switch to deflect a particle<br>
having the detected property. Therefore, certain parameters of the channel, such as the<br>
distance L between a detector 84 and a switch 82 or the shape of the path between the<br>
detector 84 and the switch 82 can be varied.<br>
Using a single laser for each wavelength optical illumination directed<br>
perpendicular to the chip, the laser is required to illuminate an area defined by: (number<br>
of channels)X((channel width at detection regjon)+(inter channel spacing C)) (See<br>
Figure 15). However, the active area where light can be absorbed to create fluorescence<br>
is only the area of the channels: (number of channels)X(channel width), which leaves a<br>
fill factor of: (channel width)/(channel width + C). The fill factor is preferably close to<br>
100% to avoid wasting available input light.<br>
Therefore, minimizing the interchannel spacing in a parallel sorting system is<br>
important to the optical detection region and optical system efficiency. In the variable<br>
array design of the present invention, shown in Figure 16, the spacing of the channels in<br>
the detection region 84 approaches the width of the channels, so that light utilization<br>
approaches about 50 %. The channel spacing in the actuation region 82 may be larger,<br>
as shown in Figure 16. The location of actuators26 along the channel may also be varied<br>
to make a larger available radius for external driver actuators.<br>
The variable array 8000 may also include meanders in selected channels for<br>
balancing flow resistances of all the channels so that given a constant pressure drop<br>
across all the channels the velocities of particles are nearly matched. These can be<br>
added either upstream or downstream of the illustrated system, i.e., on in the region<br>
between the detectors and actuators. As the lengths Li between each channel"s detection<br>
region 821 and its actuator 26i is known from the design, the measurement of the particle<br>
velocity at the same time as the determination regarding which particles to keep provides<br>
an improved cell sorting system.<br>
Figure 17 illustrates a particle sorting system 1700 according to yet another<br>
embodiment of the invention. The particle sorting system 1700 includes a plurality of<br>
sorting modules 1701 operating in parallel. The system 1700 includes an input region<br>
1710 for introducing samples to each sorting module and a detection region 1720 for<br>
measuring a predetermined characteristic of particles each sorting channel 1702 in the<br>
detection region. The system also includes a switch region 1730, including an actuator in<br>
each sorting module for separating particles having a predetermined characteristic from<br>
particles that do not have the predetermined characteristic. As shown, in the<br>
embodiment of Figure 17, the sorting channels 1702 distance between each sorting<br>
channel in the detection region 1720 is less than the inter-channel distance in the switch<br>
region 1730. The close spacing in the detection region enables cost saving when a laser<br>
is used to detect the particles, while the more distant separation in the switch region<br>
1730 accommodates various sized actuators.<br>
The particle sorting system 1700 may also include a secondary sorting module<br>
1740 for repeating the sorting process of detecting and sorting based on a predetermined<br>
characteristic to increase the accuracy of the sorting process. According to one<br>
embodiment, the system may include an enrichment region 1750 between the array of<br>
primary sorting modules 1701 and the secondary sorting module 1740 for transitioning<br>
the particles from the primary sorting process to the secondary sorting process.<br>
According to an illustrative embodiment, the enrichment region 1750 transitions the<br>
particles by removing excess carrier fluid from the particles before passing the particles<br>
to the secondary sorting module 1740. The enrichment region 1750 may also include a<br>
hydration device for adding secondary sheet fluid to the particles after enrichment. The<br>
enrichment region 1750 may comprise a membrane inserted into outlet channel 1703, an<br>
enrichment channel intersecting the outlet channel 1703 and a membrane separating the<br>
outlet channel from the enrichment channel. Excess carrier fluid is removed from the<br>
stream of selected particles in the outlet channel 1703 through the membrane and into<br>
the enrichment channel before passing the selected particles into the secondary sorting<br>
module 1740.<br>
A suitable system for forming the enrichment region is described in U.S. Patent<br>
Application Number 10/329,018, entitled "Implementation of Microfluidic Components<br>
in aMicrofluidic System", the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference<br>
According to the illustrative embodiment, the removed carrier fluid may be<br>
recycled and fed back into the inlet of the primary channels. A recycling channel or<br>
other device may connect the enrichment region to the primary channel to allow re-use<br>
of the carrier fluid for subsequent sorting process. Alternatively, the carrier fluid may be<br>
removed from rejected particles and introduced into the primary channel inlets prior to<br>
discarding the rejected particles.<br>
The particle sorting system of the present invention has a variety of applications<br>
in the microfluidic art. According to one application, the particle sorting system may be<br>
implemented in a drug screening system, as shown in Figure 18. As shown in Figure 18,<br>
a drug screening system 140 includes a particle sorting module 10 for identifying and<br>
separating target cells from a sample containing the target cells. The sample containing<br>
the target cells is introduced to the screening system through an input channel and passes<br>
to the particle sorting module, which separates the target cells from the rest of the<br>
sample and passes the target cell to a mixing and incubation region 141. Test<br>
compounds are introduced to the mixing and incubation region 141 through a test<br>
channel 142 and contact the target cells provided from the particle sorting subsystem 10.<br>
The effect of the test compound on the target cells is then detected in a detection region<br>
145.<br>
The illustrative drug screening system 140 with the particle sorter 10 may be<br>
used with a variety of types of markers. The drug screening system enables use of<br>
markers that allow measurement of the activity of a specific enzyme, thereby allowing a<br>
search for modulators of the pathways that the enzyme exists in. The drug screening<br>
system also enables use of markers that allow measurement of the concentration of any<br>
intracellular messenger/signal and markers to identify specific cell types, particularly<br>
rare (less than one per one-hundred cells) types. For example, suitable markers include,<br>
but are not limited to, cell surface markers, such as antibodies and recombinant display<br>
technologies, as well as fluorogenic enzyme substrate markers, intracellular signal<br>
binding compounds, such as Ca++ binding fluorescent dyes (Fura-3, Indo-1), and bio-<br>
luminescent enzyme substrate markers. In fluorogenic enzyme substrate markers,<br>
compounds enter cells and are converted by specific intracellular enzymes to be<br>
fluorescent. Examples are Bodipy aminoacetaldehyde or BAAA for ALDH enzymes,<br>
MUP ( 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate) for Phosphatases and Dihydrorhodamine 123<br>
for cell Redox systems. Other examples of fluorescent dyes that can be used in<br>
methods of the instant invention include, In bio-luminescent enzyme substrate markers,<br>
compounds enter cells and interact with specific intracellular enzymes generate light<br>
directly. Often this technology can be tied to reporter genes to observe gene activation.<br>
Examples include D-Luciferin and associated reporter genes, as well as DMNPE and<br>
associated reporter genes.<br>
In the illustrative application, any number of different compounds may be<br>
screened for their effects on a variety of chemical and biochemical systems. For<br>
example, compounds may be screened for effects in blocking, slowing or otherwise<br>
inhibiting key events associated with biochemical systems whose effect is undesirable.<br>
For example, test compounds may be screened for their ability to block systems that are<br>
responsible, at least in part, for the onset of disease or for the occurrence of particular<br>
symptoms of diseases, including, e.g., hereditary diseases, cancer, bacterial or viral<br>
infections and the like. Compounds which show promising results in these screening<br>
assay methods can then be subjected to further testing to identify effective<br>
pharmacological agents for the treatment of disease or symptoms of a disease.<br>
Alternatively, compounds can be screened for their ability to stimulate, enhance<br>
or otherwise induce biochemical systems whose function is believed to be desirable,<br>
e.g., to remedy existing deficiencies in a patient.<br>
The invention may be used to isolate rare cells (i.e., comprising less than .1%-<br>
1% of the input sample) for a variety of applications, such as, but not limited to: cell<br>
reimplantation, cell transplantation and cell transfection or genetic modification<br>
followed by reimplantation or transplantation. The invention may also be used to isolate<br>
tumor cells in a sample for development of tailored treatments.<br>
The invention may be utilized to screen compounds on primary cells, for<br>
example, taking 1011 cells by apheresis and screening on any sub population, rather than<br>
cell lines. The invention may also be used to screen compounds on imperfect cell lines,<br>
where less than 100% of the cell line expresses the correct genes for the screening<br>
program. The invention may also be utilized to screen compounds on cells at specific<br>
cell-cycle stages, for example, screening on cells only in the replication phase.<br>
The present invention has been described relative to an illustrative embodiment.<br>
Since certain changes may be made in the above constructions without departing from<br>
the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above<br>
description or shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.<br>
It is also to be understood that the following claims are to cover all generic and<br>
specific features of the invention described herein, and all statements of the scope of the<br>
invention which, as a matter of language, might be said to fall therebetween.<br>
Having described the invention, what is claimed as new and protected by<br>
Letters Patent is:<br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. A microfluidic system comprising :<br>
a substrate;<br>
a cell sorting system formed on the substrate for sorting cells based on the<br>
predetermined characteristic; and<br>
a screening system formed on the substrate for screening cells, said screening<br>
system having a mixing region for mixing cells having the predetermined characteristic<br>
with a test compound and a detection region for detecting the effect of the test<br>
compound on the cells having the predetermined characteristic.<br>
2. The microfluidic system as claimed in claim 1, comprising a connecting channel<br>
between the cell sorting system and the screening system for conveying selected cells<br>
from the cell sorting system to the screening system.<br>
3. The microfluidic system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cell sorting system<br>
comprises:<br>
a first duct for conveying a stream of suspended cells in a carrier liquid,<br>
comprising an inlet, a first outlet and a second outlet;<br>
a sensor for sensing a predetermined characteristic in a particle and one of a<br>
size and a velocity of a particle;<br>
a side channel in communication with the first duct;<br>
a sealed chamber positioned adjacent to the side channel, wherein the carrier<br>
fluid forms a meniscus in the side channel to separate the sealed chamber from the<br>
carrier fluid; and<br>
an actuator for modifying the pressure in the sealed chamber to deflect the<br>
meniscus when the sensor senses said predetermined characteristic, whereby the<br>
deflection of the meniscus causes the cells having said predetermined characteristic<br>
to flow into the second outlet while cells that do not have said predetermined<br>
characteristic flow into the first outlet.<br>
4. The microfluidic system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the cell sorting system<br>
comprises a buffer for absorbing pressure variations in the first duct.<br>
5. The microfluidic system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the actuator comprises<br>
a source of pressurized gas.<br>
6. The microfluidic system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the sealed chamber<br>
comprises a movable wall.<br>
7. The microfluidic system as claimed in claim 5, wherein the actuator comprises<br>
a displacement actuator for moving the movable wall of the sealed chamber to modify<br>
the pressure in the sealed chamber.<br>
8. The microfluidic system as claimed in claim 7, wherein the actuator comprises<br>
one of an electromagnetic actuator and a piezoelectric element.<br>
9. A method for screening for the ability of a compound to modulate the activity of<br>
a cell, wherein said cell is contacted with a test compound and said cells response to<br>
said test compound is monitored using the microfluidic system as claimed in claim 1.<br>
A system (10) and method for sorting particles moving through a closed<br>
channel system of capillary size comprises a bubble valve for selectively generating<br>
a pressure pulse to separate a particle having a predetermined characteristic from a<br>
stream of particles. The particle sorting system may further include a buffer for<br>
absorbing the pressure pulse. The particle sorting system (10) may include a<br>
plurality of closely coupled sorting modules which are combined to further increase<br>
the sorting rate. The particle sorting system may comprise a multi-stage sorting<br>
device for serially sorting streams of particles, in order to decrease the error rate.</td>
