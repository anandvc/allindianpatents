The disinfectant solution is also supplied to filtration system 10 in accordance with the present invention, as will be described in detail below.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, there is shown a filter 20, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a detailed schematic view of filtration system 10 including filter 20.<br>
Filter 20 generally comprised of an outer housing 30, a filter element 50, and a base 70. Outer housing 30 has an outer surface 32 and an inner surface 34. Outer housing 30 is fixed to base 70, to form a fluid-tight container that defines a cavity 3.6.<br>
Filter element 50 has an outer surface 52 and an inner surface 54. Filter element 50 is located within cavity 36 defined by outer housing 30. Filter element 50 is also attached to base 70. In a preferred embodiment, filter element 50 is a generally cylindrical structure made of a relatively dense filtration media. In a preferred embodiment, the filtration media is dimensioned to filter particles in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 microns, and more preferably about 0.2 microns. One exemplary filtration media is the Pall MCY4463DFLPH4 filter cartridge from Pall Corporation. This filter<br>
5<br><br>
cartridge is a Fluorodyne H hydrophilic FVDF (double layer) filtration media, with a microbial removal rating of 0.2 um, sterilizing grade.<br>
With reference to FIG. 2, an outer chamber 40 is denned between housing 30 and filter element 50. An inner chamber 60 is defined by inner surface 54 of filter element 50.<br>
Base 70 includes a plurality of ports 72, 74, 76, 78, 80 for fluid communication with filter 20. In this regard, first port 72 is connected to an air line 90 providing fluid communication between outer chamber 40 and a compressed air source. A control valve 92, air filter 94 and (directional) check valve 96 are disposed in line 90, to control the flow and direction of air flow in line 90, as will be described in further detail below. Check valve 96 only allows fluid flow into filter 20. In a preferred embodiment, air filter 94 is a 0.2 micron filter.<br>
Second port 74 connects with a fluid line 100, providing fluid communication with the fluid microbial decontamination system 5, as schematically illustrated in the drawings. A control valve 102 is located along fluid line 100. In a preferred embodiment, control valve 102 is constructed to allow "counter flow" when it is closed (i.e., not energized). In this respect, valve 102 allows fluid flow out of filter 20 through fluid line 100 when it is closed, but only allows fluid flow into filter 20 through fluid line 100 when it is open (i.e., energized).<br>
Port 76 connects with a fluid line 110, providing fluid communication between inner chamber 60 and a chemical disinfectant system (CDS) 500. A control valve 116 is located along CDS line 110. In a preferred embodiment, a portion 112 of fluid line 110 extends into inner chamber 60.<br>
Port 78 connects with a water line 120, providing fluid communication between outer chamber 40 and a water inlet. In a preferred embodiment, water inlet supplies heated water. Water travels along line 120 from the water inlet to outer chamber 40. In a preferred embodiment, a flow control 122 and a (directional) check valve 124 are located along line 120. Flow control 122 controls the flow of water from the water inlet into outer chamber 40. Check valve 124 only allows fluid flow into filter 20.<br>
Port 80 connects with a drain line 130 providing fluid communication between outer chamber 40 and a drain. Fluid travels along drain line 130 from outer<br>
6<br><br>
chamber 40 to the drain. A control valve 132 is located along drain line 130 to control the flow of fluid to the drain.<br>
An optional port 38 is also formed in outer housing 30. Port 38 communicates with a condenser line 140, providing fluid communication between outer chamber 40 and a condenser system. The condenser system preferably includes a direct contact cold-water condenser. A control valve 142 is provided along condenser line 140 to control the flow of fluid to the condenser.<br>
A line 150 is disposed between line 90 and line 110, to provide fluid communication therebetween. In a preferred embodiment, line 150 connects with line 90 between air filter 94 and check valve 96, and connects with line 110 between control valve 116 and port 76. A needle valve 152 and check valve 154 are located along connecting line 150. A return (bypass) line 155 is provided in connection with needle valve 152. Return line 155 includes a check valve 156. The return line 155 regulates a high pressure condition associated with needle valve 152. In this regard, if the pressure associated with fluid flowing through needle valve 152 exceeds a predetermined amount, fluid will flow along return line 155 to prevent a high pressure condition.<br>
A line 105 is disposed between lines 100 and 110, to provide fluid communication therebetween. In a preferred embodiment, line 105 connects with line 100 between control valve 102 and washing chamber 200, and connects with line 110 between control valve 116 and CDS 500. A control valve 106 is located in line 105.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, control valves 92, 102, 106, 116, 132 and 142 are solenoid-actuated.<br>
A control unit (not shown) controls the operation of control valves 92, 102,106,116,132,142, and 152, the air source, and flow control 122 associated with the water inlet. In a preferred embodiment, the control unit takes the form of a microcontroller or microcomputer. This same control unit preferably controls circulation pump 400, valves 250, 252 and 254, as well as other components of fluid microbial decontamination system 5.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, filter 20 is angled ■ to direct fluid flow (of liquids) toward port 80 associated with drain line 130. This facilitates the exit of liquids from outer and inner chambers 40,60.<br>
7<br><br>
Operation of filtration system 10 will now be described in detail with particular reference to FIGS. 3-5. It should be understood that the operating method of filtration system 10 as disclosed herein illustrates a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and is not intended to limit the same.<br>
Fluid microbial decontamination system 5 may perform one or more of the following operations: (1) a fill mode wherein sump 210 is filled with filtered water, (2) a dissolution mode wherein disinfectant concentrate is dissolved with filtered water in CDS 500 to form a disinfectant solution (e.g., peracidic acid), (3) a baclcflow filter cleaning mode wherein disinfectant is circulated in filter 20 to clean and disinfect filter element 50, (4) a rinse mode wherein rinse water is circulated through washing chamber 200, (5) a drain mode wherein filter 20 and washing chamber 200 are drained, and (6) a filter test mode wherein the integrity of filter 20 is tested.<br>
The fill mode will now be described with reference to FIG. 3. Starting with filter 20 empty, and valves 92, 102, 106, 116, 132, 142 and 152 closed, flow control 122 is controlled to allow heated water from the water inlet to enter outer chamber 40 through water line 120. In this respect, the water pressure along water line 120 forces directional check valve 124 open, thus allowing the heated water to flow into outer chamber 40. The heated water filling outer chamber 40 passes through filter element 50 (from outer surface 52 to inner surface 54) and into inner chamber 60 as filtered water. Accordingly, the heated water is filtered by filter element 50 as it passes therethrough. The filtered water filling inner chamber 60 exits inner chamber 60 through line 100. As indicated above, valve 102 is constructed to allow "counter flow" when it is closed. Therefore, as filtered water enters inner chamber 60 of filter 20, water pressure is applied to the exit side of valve 102. Consequently, filtered water exits inner chamber 60 by counter flowing through valve 102. In a preferred embodiment, valves 250 and 252 are controlled to allow the filtered water to flow to sump 210, and to be subsequently pumped by circulation pump 400. Once sump 210 has been filled to a desired level, flow control 122 is closed to prevent the further flow of heated water into filter 20.<br>
It should be understood that upon initial flow of heated water into filter 20, control valve 142 may be momentarily opened (e.g., 1-5 seconds) to allow any air<br>
8<br><br>
inside filter 20 pass out through condenser line 140 to the condenser.   Thereafter, valve 142 is closed.<br>
In the dissolution mode, disinfectant concentrate is dissolved with filtered water to form a disinfectant solution by supplying filtered water to CDS 500. To this end, valve 106 is opened, while keeping valves 102 and 116 closed. Accordingly, filtered water pumped by circulation pump 400 can travel from circulation pump 400 to CDS 500 without entering filter 20. At CDS 500, the filtered water mixes with the disinfectant concentrate to form the disinfectant solution. In a preferred embodiment, flow control 122 is controlled to stop water from entering filter 20 while valve 106 is opened.<br>
The backflow filter cleaning mode will now be described with reference to FIG. 4. Disinfectant solution from CDS 500 may be introduced into filter 20 in a backflow operation, to clean and disinfect filter element 50. To this end, flow control 122 is controlled to close the flow of water from the water inlet Furthermore, drain valve 132 is opened to allow water remaining in filter 20 to flow out through drain line 130 into the drain. As a result, water will be removed from outer chamber 40. Valve 106 remains open, and valves 102 and 116 are opened to allow disinfectant solution to flow into inner chamber 60 through lines 110 and 100. The disinfectant solution filling inner chamber 60 passes through filter element 50 (from inner surface 54 to outer surface 52) into outer chamber 40. Disinfectant solution in outer chamber 40 exits filter 20 through drain line 130.<br>
It should be appreciated that filter cleaning is facilitated by the removal of water from outer chamber 40 by controlling the operation of drain valve 132. In this regard, removal of water eliminates the "concentration gradient" through filter element 50, normally occurring when water is present in outer chamber 40, as disinfectant solution passes through filter element 50. The filter cleaning allows disinfectant solution to permeate completely through filter element 50. The "concentration gradient" results from the mixing of the disinfectant solution with the residual water in outer chamber 40. Consequently, a concentration gradient occurs as the disinfectant solution becomes more diluted, as it passes from inner chamber 60 to outer chamber 40.<br>
During the rinse mode, circulating pump 400 circulates rinse water through washing chamber 200. To isolate filter 20 from the rinse water, valves 102,<br>
9<br><br>
106 and 116 are closed. Since the bacterial content of the rinse water is unknown, it is undesirable to introduce the rinse water into filter 20. However, new supplies of filtered water can be provided to circulation pump 200 during circulation of rinse water through washing chamber 200. In this regard, flow control 122 is controlled to allow heated water to flow into filter 20. This heated water is filtered (as described, above), and flows out of filter 20 through line 100 to fluid microbial decontamination system 5. As indicated above, filtered water exiting filter 20 can pass through valve 102 when closed.<br>
The drain mode will now be described with reference to FIG. 5. When washing chamber 200 is to be drained, it is also desirable to drain filter 20. In this regard, flow control 122 is controlled to prevent the flow of heated water to filter 20 via line 120. Drain valve 132 is then opened to drain water from filter 20. Water remaining in filter 20 is removed by opening control valve 92 and activating the air source to supply air to filter 20 through air line 90. In this regard, the air pressure along air line 90 forces check valve % open, allowing air to pass into outer chamber 40, thus pressurizing outer chamber 40. The forced air evacuates water remaining in outer chamber 40 by forcing the water into drain line 130 and into the drain. Needle valve 152 is also opened to allow air from the air source to enter inner chamber 60, thus pressurizing inner chamber 60. In this regard, air pressure along line 150 forces check valve 154 open, allowing air to pass into inner chamber 60 via line 110. Residual water in inner chamber 60 exits filter 20 "counter flow" through line 100. It should be understood that valves 102,106, and 116 remain closed during this draining operation.<br>
In the filter test mode the integrity of filter 20 is checked. In this operating mode, drain valve 132 is closed, condenser valve 142 is closed, flow control 122 is controlled to prevent any incoming water, and valves 152, 106 and 116 are closed. Valve 92 is then opened to allow air from the air source to enter outer chamber 40 through air line 90. A pressure sensor 160 (e.g., a pressure transducer), located along line 90 is used to monitor the pressure within outer chamber 40. In a preferred embodiment, outer chamber 40 is pressurized to a predetermined pressure (e.g., about 40 psi). Pressure sensor 160 is used to monitor a pressure decay resulting from gas diffusion through filter element 50, and determine the operational status of filter 20. Pressure sensor 160 is preferably connected with the control unit described<br>
10<br><br>
above. The control unit may include a visual or audible indicators for indicating to the operator the success or failure of the filter integrity test" After the filter integrity test is completed, pressure in filter 20 is released by opening valve 142, and releasing the air to the condenser.<br>
The present invention provides improved cleaning of filter 20 because the direction of fluid flow through filter element 50 for the disinfectant solution is opposite to the direction of fluid flow through filter element 50 for filtration of the heated water during a filtration operation. Moreover, water is removed from filter 20 before disinfectant solution is moved through filter element 50, thus eliminating a concentration gradient of the disinfectant solution.<br>
Other modifications and alterations will occur to others upon their reading and understanding of the specification. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br>
