				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the electrochemical preparation of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol. More particularly, the presemt invention relates to an improved process for the electrochemical preparation of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol in aqueous medium containing sodium bromide as an electrolyte with platinum both as anode and cathode in an undivided electrochemical cell.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The Product benzaldehyde is widely used as an intermediate in the manufacture of dyestuff, flavoring chemicals (e.g. cinnamldehyde, amyl cinnamldehyde and benzyl benzoate), and perfumery chemicals, in acridine dyes, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. It can be also used as a corrosion inhibitor and a solvent for polyester resins.<br>
Hitherto preparation of benzaldehyde by the hydrolysis of the corresponding side chain halogenated toluene compounds such as benzyl chloride at a temperature range of 100-200°C. at normal or higher pressures in the presence of an excess hydrochloric acid (U.S. Pat. No. 4,229,379). In U.S. Pat. No. 4,450,298 a process is described for the vapor phase catalytic hydrolysis of benzyl chloride to benzaldehyde using a catalyst comprising activated carbon treated with sulphuric acid or impregnated with a metal chloride such as iron (III) chloride or a metal sulphate such as cupric sulphate. A major disadvantage of these processes is the generation of large amount of effluent. The benzaldehyde produced by these routes does not meet food grade specifications.<br>
Vapor phase or liquid phase oxidation of toluene by air is environmentally benign and provided the desired selectivities to the market driven products. World patent WO 95/20560 discloses a liquid phase process for the manufacture of benzaldehyde by the oxidation of toluene in presence of oxygen in a temperature and pressure range of 120 -200.°C. and 2-50 atm, respectively in the presence of a catalyst comprising cobalt or manganese as a metal ion and bromide as a promoter. 10% conversion of toluene and 45% selectivity to benzaldehyde is obtained. Borgaonkaret al, [ I &amp; EC Prod. Res. Dev, 23(3), 459 (1984)] have reported lower (10%) conversion of toluene and 90% yield of<br><br><br>
benzaldehyde by the use of cobalt acetate and either sodium bromide or paraldehyde as a promoter in presence of air.<br>
A process for the vapor phase oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde and benzoic acid using a catalyst containing a mixture of silver vanadate and lead vanadate or silver arsenate in presence of oxygen or ozone is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,485,876. This catalyst system suppresses the formation of benzoic acid and degradation to carbon dioxide. According to U.S. Pat. No. 3,946,067, aromatic aldehydes such as benzaldehyde or substituted benzaldehydes were manufactured by the vapour-phase oxidation of aralkyl compounds, like toluene or substituted toluenes, in the presence of catalyst containing palladium metal and phosphoric acid at a temperature of less than 250 °C. The aromatic aldehydes are produced in a single reaction step. The drawbacks of the process are that the conversion of toluene has to be kept very low (70%). Also, the process is not suitable as large amounts of carbon dioxide are formed due to high temperature used in the reaction. U.S. Pat. No. 4,390,728 describes a process in which the oxides of various metals (viz. Cu, Fe, Pb, Mo, U, and P) with promoter were used for the production of benzaldehyde by the oxidation of toluene. At a temperature of 475-550 °C, a conversion of 35-50% and selectivity of 40-70% to benzaldehyde was obtained.<br>
Another process for the production of benzaldehyde was reported by Ray et al. [Ind. J. Technol., 21(4), 137 (1983)] at a conversion of about 15% and selectivity of 70% with significant amount of C02 formation. Hence, the major disadvantages of the above processes are the use of high temperatures and lower conversion of toluene. The formation of large amount of carbon dioxide ultimately will affect the overall yield and is also not environmentally clean.<br>
An electrochemical process using redox mediated system is described in Indian patent No.62426 for the oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde. In this redox system the space time yield is low and the process is two stage processes for oxidation of toluene. These are the drawbacks in this electrochemical process and there is no electrochemical process on oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with aqueous NaBr medium.<br><br><br>
Wherein, because of the above drawbacks these processes are not promising for the production of benzaldehyde by toluene oxidation. The drawbacks are low yield and low selectivity and the reactions are conducted at very high pressure and temperature with hazardous raw materials in all the above-referred chemical method.<br>
Radical bromination on a benzylic position has been achieved using bromine, and N-bromo succinimide. In addition, bromine complex of styrene vinyl pyridine copolymer and bromotrichloro ethane and copper(ll) bromide have been reported to be effective for benzylic bromination. Majority of brominating agents require the presence of peroxide or other radical initiator. Side chain bromination using sodium bromate and bromotrimethyl silane pair is also reported. But these methods are not suitable for commercialization due to poor yield. Moreover they had become the biggest obstacle to environmental safety. On the basis of the electrochemical technology, it is possible to carry out a desired electrochemical oxidation by a two-phase electrolysis resulting in high yield and high selectivity for benzaldehyde and substituted benzyl benzaldehydes.<br>
Hence the invented process includes an improved process for the electrochemical preparation of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol in aqueous medium containing sodium bromide as an electrolyte with platinum as anode and cathode in an undivided electrochemical cell at a current density of 50 mA/cm2 and in room temperature with high yield (98%) and high conversion (100%). The depleted concentration of sodium bromide can be made up by adding required amount of additional salt in the aqueous phase and can be reused. There are also no wastewater problems. The wastewater consists solely of aqueous sodium bromide solution.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the electrochemical preparation of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol in aqueous medium containing sodium bromide as a electrolyte with platinum as anode and cathode in an undivided electrochemical cell.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a process, which will be eco-friendly and avoids the effluent disposal problem.<br><br><br>
Another object of this investigation is to explore a new electrolyte system consisting of metal bromides such as sodium, potassium, calcium or a combination of any of the above two metal salts preferably sodium bromide.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to use a very low concentration of NaBr solution (25%) to achieve high yield to benzaldehyde.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to reduce the formation of side products such as benzyl bromide and benzoic acid.<br>

Detail description of the invention<br>
The process of the present invention comprises subjecting benzyl alcohol oxidation in two-phase system in an organic solvent and in the presence of aqueous NaBr system and a bromide source as a promoter. The reaction is carried out in the presence of aqueous and an organic solvent system (two-phase system) and at a temperature in the range of 25-50 °C. and at atmospheric pressure for a period of 4-6 F/mol. After the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture is separated by any conventional method such as distillation. The aqueous electrolyte system consists of metal selected from sodium, calcium and potassium or a combination of any of the above two metals, with bromide as a promoter. The percentage of aqueous NaBr used is in the range of 10-50% and preferably in the range of 20-30%. The ratio of benzyl<br><br><br>
alcohol to chloroform is used in the range of 10-100 g/l and preferably in the range of 25-50 g/l.<br>
After the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture phase was separated. The reactants and products were analyzed by GC and HPLC. The present invention produces benzaldehyde with high yield (preferably 95-99%) without other byproducts such as benzyl bromide and benzoic acid. The two-phase electrolysis system is necessary for obtaining high yield of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol. The single phase electrolysis allows very low selectivity to benzaldehyde.<br>
The novelty of the process is the preparation of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol in aqueous medium at 30°C temperature by biphasic electrolysis and also used to syntheses of regioselective substituted benzaldehydes without formation of the benzyl bromide or benzoic acids. Moreover yields of benzaldehyde and substituted benzaldehydes are obtained about 90 to 99%. The reactive species formed by the electrolytic oxidation of the halide ion in an aqueous phase can be continuously taken into the organic layer and then reacts with the substrate giving regioselective products. The electrolysis can be performed in mild condition without any hazardous reagents at atmospheric pressure. Good mass transfer, high conversion and yield could be achieved in this electrochemical cell. The cell design is simple and cost effective.<br>
