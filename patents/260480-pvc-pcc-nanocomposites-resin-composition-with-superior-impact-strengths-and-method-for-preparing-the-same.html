				<td>PVC-PCC NANOCOMPOSITES RESIN COMPOSITION WITH SUPERIOR IMPACT STRENGTHS AND METHOD FOR PREPARING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a nanocomposite resin composition and a method for preparing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a PVC based nanocomposite resin composition with superior impact strength, which is prepared by uniformly dispersing nano calcium carbonate in a vinyl chloride monomer, dispersing the mixture systQm in water to obtain an suspension system and polymerizing it at an elevated temperature, and a method for preparing the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, PVC resins are utilized in the soft and the rigid applications. Soft applications include wallpaper, floorings, artificial leather, toys, disposable polygloves, etc., where PVC resins are used in the form of paste in combination with a lot of plasticizer. Paste PVC resins are manufactured by emulsion polymerization or MSP (microsuspension: seeded Polymerization). The rigid applications including pipes, window frames and hard sheets<br>
adopt extrusion, calendaring or injection process. PVC resins for rigid applications are mostly manufactured by suspension polymerization. In the processing of PVC, additives are typically used altogether to enhance properties and to secure the stability of the resins while processing; impact modifier, heat stabilizer, processing aid, pigment, and inorganic filler to name a few. For example, PVC window profile compound includes 6-10 parts by weight of an impact modifier such as methyl methacrylate-butadiene-styrene (MBS) copolymer, acrylic impact modifier, chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), per 100 parts by weight of a PVC resin to enhance the impact strength of the final article. However, these impact modifiers are expensive compared to PVC resin.<br>
PCC (precipitated calcium carbonate) having a particle size of about 0.07 micron (70 nm) was reported to have an impact modification effect (J.A. Radosta. "Low Temperature and Ambient Impact Modification of Polymers with Surface Treated Calcium Carbonate" SPE ANTEC, New Orleans, May 7-10, 1979). According to this report, a superior impact modification effect is obtained for an extrusion article of a mixture of at least 10 parts by weight of PCC and 100 parts by weight of a PVC resin. In this case, the extrusion article was prepared by several cycles of processing including mixing, roll-mill press,<br>
crushing and extrusion of the PCC/FVC mixture to ensun,) the fine dispersion of the PCC in the polymer matrix. Nano PCC, which is finely dispersed in a polymer medium, is suggested to disperse impact energy into the polymer medium due to its large specific surface area. For nano PCC to have an impact modification effect, the primary PCC particle should have a size of 100 nm or less to maximize the surface area, and the nano particles should be dispersed in the polymer medium as close as -the primary particle. Nano dispersion of PCC in polymer matrix is difficult to achiev with the general extrusion processing. The multi-step processing proposed in the report, which is difficult to apply to industrial productions, adopts external physical force to finely disperse the PCC in the polymer medium.<br>

The method for preparing a PVC based nanocomposite according to the present invention comprises the steps of dispersing nano calcium carbonate in a vinyl chloride monomer, adding the resultant mixture system to an aqueous solution system comprising water, a suspension stabilizer and a polymerization initiator to prepare a suspension, polymerizing the vinyl chloride monomer at an elevated temperature to prepare a PVC/nano calcium carbonate composite resin and processing the resultant composite resin.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the polymerization initiator may .be added in the step of preparing the nano calcium carbonate/vinyl chloride monomer mixture system.<br>
1. Dispersion of nano calcium carbonate<br><br>
The step of adding nano calcium carbonate and a lipophilic dispersing agent to a vinyl chloride monomer to disperse them is described in detail.<br>
In the present invention, a precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) having a particle size smaller than 1 pm, preferably 40-70 nm, is used. Preferably, the nano calcium carbonate is used in 1-30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride monomer, considering the polymerization stability of the suspension system, the extrusion processing condition and the physical properties of the final product.<br>
Because the surface of the nano calcium carbonate is hydrophilic, it should be treated with a metal salt of an organic carboxylic acid such as fatty acid, resin acid, etc. In the present invention, the surface of the nano calcium carbonate is modified with fatty, acid to wet the vinyl chloride monomer.  However, an additional dispersing agent is required to obtain an ultrafine  (sub-micron size) dispersion of PCC in vinyl chloride.<br>
The lipophilic dispersing agent is a monomer dispersing agent or a polymer dispersing agent having carboxylic acid, phosphoric acid or a salt thereof, so that it is soluble ift an organic phase and compatible with the surface of the nano calcium carbonate. More preferably, it has a chemical structure compatible with a PVC resin.<br>
The salt of phosphoric acid or carboxylic acid has sodium, ammonium, a primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary alkyl ammonium salt, Ci-C30 hydrocarbon, a homopolymer selected from the group consisting of polyolefin, polyether, polymethacrylate, polyacrylate, polyacetate, polyester and polyurethane or a copolymer thereof as side chain.<br>
Typically, the main chain of the lipophilic dispersing agent may be an oligomer or a polymer such as polyether like poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide); polyacrylate like poly(methyl methacrylate), poly (.n-hexyl methacrylate), poly (n-propyl acrylate) and (poly(n-butyl acrylate); polylactone like poly(r-caprolactone) , poly (/3-propiolactone), poly (valerolactone), etc.; polyester, etc. Also, a polymer with a strong polarity so as to be compatible with a PVC resin or polymers with PVC-friendly functional groups, such as polyurethane and poly (vinyl acetate), may be used as the main chain of the lipophilic dispersing agent. The lipophilic dispersing agent may adopt a homopolymer, a copolymer of the above polymer components or a copolymer comprising other polymer components.<br>
A typical structure of the dispersing agent is illustrated in Formulas 1 and 2 below:<br>

where each of A and B of the backbone of the polymer is a homopolymer or a copolymer selected from the group consisting of polyether, polyolefin, polymethacrylate, polyacrylate, polyacetate, polyester and polyurethane; each of RI and R2 in the calcium carbonate-friendly side chain is hydrogen, Ci-C30 hydrocarbon or a homopolymer or a copolymer selected from the group consisting of polyether, polymethacrylate, polyacrylate, polyacetate, polyester and polyurethane; n arid 1 are integers.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>

where each of A and B of the backbone of the polymer is a homopolymer or a copolymer selected from the group consisting of polyether, polyolefin, polymethacrylate,<br>
polyacrylate, polyacetate, polyester and polyurethane; R of the calcium carbonate-friendly side chain is hydrogen, sodium, ammonium, primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary alkyl ammonium, CI-CSQ hydrocarbon or a homopolymer or a copolymer selected from the group consisting of polyether, polymethacrylate, polyacrylate, polyacetate, polyester and polyurethane; and n and 1 are integers.<br>
The dispersing agent has molecular weight ranging from 40 to 100,QOO, preferably ranging from 200 to 100,000. Also preferably, 1 and n are integers equal to or larger than 1. For example, if A is a homopolymer of polyethylene oxide having a molecular weight of 300 and a phosphoric acid unit is present in the terminal of the molecule, then each of m and n is 1. Also, if an acid unit is present in the side chain of the polymer, the proportion of each copolymer unit may be expressed by m and n. Here, m represents the proportion of the phosphoric acid or carboxylic acid and n represents the proportion of the polymer unit.<br>
Typical examples of adsorption groups that enable effective dispersion in an organic phase by electronic and steric interaction with the surface of the nano calcium carbonate are cgrboxylic acid and phosphoric acid. Organic salts of these acids can also be utilized. Besides, any<br>
acid having affinity to the surface of the nano calcium carbonate, which is coordinated by a cation, may be the adsorption group of the lipophilic dispersing agent.<br>
Preferably, the lipophilic dispersing agent is used in.0.01-10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the nano calcium carbonate. If the content of the lipophilic dispersing agent is below 0.01 parts by weight, the calcium carbonate may be precipitated on the vinyl chloride monomer. Otherwise, if it exceeds 10 parts by weight, the dispersing agent may remain on the surface of the final product to cause foaming, decrease of heat stability, discoloring, etc.<br>
2. Polymerization of nano calcium carbonate/vinyl chloride composite resin<br>
The step of dispersing the vinyl chloride monomer mixture system, in which the nano calcium carbonate has been dispersed, in water to prepare a suspension and polymerizing it to prepare a PVC/nano calcium carbonate composite is described in detail.<br>
If, deionized water containing a suspension stabilizer and a polymerization initiator is mixed with the nano calcium carbonate;/vinyl chloride monomer dispersion system and stirred, a liquid drop of vinyl chloride having a size of 10-50 /jm is formed in water. The deionized water is used in 100-300 parts by weight, preferably in 150 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride<br>
monomer. The suspension stabilizer may be vinyl acetate, cellulose, gelatin, etc. A polyvinyl acetate having a degree of polymerization of 500-3,000, which has been hydrolyzed to 70-98 mol%, and a modified cellulose having a degree of substitution of about 1.0-3.0 and a degree of" polymerization about 50-2,000 are used as the primary suspension stabilizer. For the secondary suspension stabilizer, a polyvinyl acetate which has been hydrolyzed to 10-60 mol% may be used. In addition, a pH controller, an antioxidant, a scaling inhibitor, etc. may be added in the polymerization step to improve whiteness, weather resistance, etc, of the resin.<br>
3. Preparation of PVC based nanocomposite resin 4-6 partg by weight of a composite stabilizer comprising a heat stabilizer and a lubricant and 1-10 parts by weight of a methyl methacrylate-butadiene-styrene (MBS) copolymer, an acrylic impact modifier (AIM) or a chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) are added to 100 parts by weight of the nano calcium carbonate/vinyl chloride composite resin composition. The mixture is mixed at 90-120 °C for 5-30 minutes and a PVC based nanocomposite resin composition is prepared using a HAAKE extruder. A planar sample having a thickness of 3 mm is prepared using the resultant composition. The conditions of mixing and extrusion may be different depending on the equipments.<br>
The PVC based nanocomposite resin composition may be further processed by adding a heat stabilizer, a lubricant, a processing aid, an antioxidant, etc., if required.<br>

After mixing at 105 °C for 20 minutes, a planat extrusion sample having a thickness of 3 mm was prepared using a HAAKE twin extruder. Processing was performed for less than 3 minutes along the die direction at a screw rotation rate of 30 rpm, while<br>
increasing the temperature to about 165, 170, 175 and 185 T!. The resultant extrusion product was let to cool down. A Charpy impact strength sample and an Izod impact strength sample were prepared form the extrusion sample, according to Korean Industrial Standards (KS) B 5522 and KS M 3055, respectively. The impact strength measurement result is given in Table 1 below.<br>

The impact strength measurement result for the extrusion sample is given in Table 1.<br>
[Example 3|<br>
