				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to road wheels of vehicles. In particular this invention relates to construction of vehicle steel wheel of 5° taper bead-seat of flat or semi-drop center rim used but not limited for commercial use. This invention further relates to a method of manufacturing the said type of wheel.<br>
The 5° taper bead-seat wheel tire bead seat area would have a 5° taper and profile (where tire contact is involved) as defined in the international tire and rim standards / manuals / hand books such as ETRTO, T&amp;RA, JATMA. This is applicable for all 5° bead seat rims i.e. it includes semi drop center, flat base etc. Mainly this is for tube type application. It can be used as tubeless type only when a suitable sealing exists (as recommended by tire manufacturer). It has to be used along with the suitable removable flange / flanges (as recommended by wheel manufacturer) at the end/ends of the rim.<br>
This invention relates to a construction, apparatus and a method of producing integral wheel rim and disc assembly of a 5° taper bead-seat of flat or semi-drop center rim, providing a generally circular steel blank from a sheet stock of pre-determined uniform thickness, the blank is preferably with a center hole pierced to a predetermined size. The blank is preformed in spinning machine to a predetermined cylindrical profile &amp; shape, such perform is further spun and flow formed in a spinning machine, the preform being positioned between an outer roll &amp; inner mandrel and held against the damping plate, such inner mandrel comprise of a outboard surface which conforms to the predetermined inner diameter of the rim comprising of gutter portion, the well, the bead-seat and fixed flange and such outer roll comprise of outboard surface which confirms to the final shape and profile of the gutter wall. The preform peripheral cylindrical portion is then spun against the outboard surface of the inner mandrel &amp; outboard surface of the outer roll to displace the material in backward &amp; forward direction to the final profile and shape of the gutter wall and predetermined profile &amp; form of well, bead-seat, fixed flange respectively. The spun rim comprising of gutter, well and bead seat is further spun and flow formed in a spinning machine, being positioned between an outer mandrel and an inner damping plate, such outer mandrel comprise of a inboard surface which conforms to the final shape of the fixed flange and 5° angle to the bead-seat, is spun and flow formed against the inner surface of the outer mandrel by a shaping roller of predetermined shape to form the final shape of the fixed flange and 5° bead-seat<br>
In its most conventional form, a fabricated sheet steel wheel of a 5° taper bead-seat of flat-base or semi-drop center rims for a vehide, the rim inner periphery have welded or jointed central disc also made of sheet steel. The tire mounts on the outer periphery of the rim supported by the central disc, which provides a means of attachment to spindle hubs, brake drum or other like assodated parts of the vehide. It is essential that the rim and disc, in their assembled relationship, insure perfect roundness of the rim and accurate axial alignment of the rim with respect to the disc. Deviations in the respective directions being termed as "radial" and "axial* run-outs, the Vehide manufacturers establish extremely rigid specifications in the tolerances for these dimensions.<br>
When such wheels are manufactured in the conventional method, the rim and discs are normally made as separate components. These two  components are then<br><br>
assembled together in a press or in a fixture, the disc fixed at its opter peripheral flange to the inner periphery of the rim by welding or some other like method to form the complete wheel assembly. In the conventional method of making the rims by using a butt-welded hoop made out of a strip of hot rolled sections or plate, achieving such a dose tolerance on the roundness has found to be extremely difficult due to the localized *kink* in the region of butt welded joint and the non-uniform spring back during the rim diameter calibration operation. Likewise accurate dimensional control in making the disc are also found difficult due to cold press forming inconsistency, brought about by dimensional and properties variation of the input material. Further substantial distortion due to welding the two parts requires further corrective additional costly operation to ensure that the axial alignment is held within limits. It is appreciated by the people who are skilled in the manufacturing wheels that such distortion once occurred cannot be corrected completely and a welded assembly does not lend itself well to the rigorous balancing and centering of the wheel Such shift in the axial alignment and also the localized kink in the rim in the region of the butt welded joint is known to produce first harmonics during vehicle running causing vibration and high noise. The axial shift between the disc and the rim also produces imbalance of the wheel causing vehicle disturbance or thumping / shake*<br>
Further when such wheels have been run with test overloads to induce failure, fatigue cracks have usually occurred in the center of the disc where it is attached to its supporting axle and in the welds, which have attached the rim to the disc.<br>
Another problem of the wheel of conventional design is due to the constraint of using break drum of larger size. This is due to the disc peripheral portion being assembled under the rim, thus restricting space for accommodating a break drum of larger size. Today's vehicle carries more loads at high speed. From the point of view safety it is necessary to provide for a greater area for a larger envelope break components for improved breaking performance.<br>
The use of integral wheel rim and disc assembly of a 5° taper bead-seat of flat or semi-drop center rims of low carbon and high strength steel, would lead to a noticeable reduction in weight, would facilitate balancing and centering.<br>
It is well recognized that wheels are not only critical to the safety of an automotive vehicle but also being an un-sprung mass has a pronounced effect on vehtde stability and driving comfort. It is thus obvious that only an integral wheel rim and disc assembly of a 5° taper bead-seat of fiat or semi-drop center rims construction and a method of manufacturing the same would satisfy the requirement as enumerated as above.<br>
However, up to the present time none of the prior processes has enabled to be produced a integral wheel rim and disc assembly of a 5° taper bead-seat of flat or semi-drop center rims construction under satisfactory technical and/or economic conditions, either on account of the fact that they do not lend themselves to mass production at an attractive cost price, or on account of the fact that the wheels obtained do not satisfy the requirements of the users, strength, minimal unbalance and first harmonic content, and accuracy of the significant dimensional characteristics.<br>
The present invention relates to a apparatus and method for producing integral steel wheel rim and disc assembly of a 5° taper bead-seat of flat base or semi-drop center riins for vehicles, which lends itself particularly well to mass production and provides wheels which meet the requirements of users such as have just been enumerated above. A vehide integral wheel rim and disc assembly of a 5° taper bead-seat of flat<br><br>
or semi-drop center rims requires less material to construct and is substantially simpler to fabricate as there are fewer parts to construct and there are no assembly &amp; welding steps involved, thus resulting in cost savings.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an integral steel wheel rim and disc assembly for vehicle wheel of 5° taper bead-seat of flat-base or semi-drop center construction, and an method and apparatus for making the same, which overcome the aforementioned problems in an economical and reliable manner.<br>
It is another object of invention to provide an improved method of manufacturing of a vehicle wheel in a way that reduces manufacturing cost while providing high strength wheel<br>
It is further object of invention to provide for a construction that reduces the wheel weight substantially, yet providing the high strength wheel.<br>
It is yet another object of invention to provide for a greater air space for a larger envelope brake components for improved braking performance.<br>
