				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to multifunction peripheral (MFP) devices. Particularly, the present invention relates to the printing domain. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for printing different data blocks in a single document by select and append option.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
In the existing technology of the day, all print drivers provide an option for selection printing in which the user selects the data block in the application and then chooses the 'selection printing* option. The selected data block will get printed immediately in a separate page. If the user wants to select more data blocks and get them printed he follows the same procedure.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the flow chart of the process: selection print in current printers. It involves the following steps,<br>
1.	User selects a data block to print at application.<br>
2.	Goes to Fiie-&gt;Print option.<br>
3.	Click selection TAB as shown in figure 2<br>
4.	Click on OK button<br>
5.	Selected data block gets printed immediately.<br>
The above five steps are repeated for each data block to be printed, which may be present in multiple places of a document.<br>
Figure 3, it depicts the block diagram for prior art in which the print driver gives the direct command to the print spooler to print 'job V (job 1 is the first data block selected by the user) in the spooler queue. Here, the print driver cannot append a print job to an already existing print job in the spooler queue. Hence, whenever a data block is selected, it has to be printed immediately, sans any delay.<br><br>
From the foregoing, hence, it is obvious that existing art has the following drawbacks:<br>
•	User needs to give separate print command for each data block.<br>
•	Separate blocks can only be printed separately in separate pages.<br>
•	As a result, some of the pages will be blank as each block might be half page or so but still needs to be printed in a separate page. This results in wastage of paper.<br>
The present invention tries to negate these shortcomings in the prior art by suggesting a method by which different data blocks can be printed in a single document using a select and append option. This not only saves the valuable time of the user, but also the amount of paper required in a big way.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the primary object of the invention to provide a method by which different data blocks can be printed in a single document using select and append option.<br>
It is another object of the invention to let the user arrange or edit the different data blocks selected before eventually printing it.<br>
It is another objective of the invention to let the user append different files into one job.<br>
It is a further objective of the invention to save paper significantly.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention providesa method for printing different data blocks in a single document by 'select and append' option, the method comprising.<br><br>
a.	Selecting the data block to be printed.<br>
b.	Clicking on the 'Select' and 'Append' options to create a new<br>
print job.<br>
c.	Repeating the procedure if to select more data blocks and<br>
adding to the 'waiting to be printed job'.<br>
d.	Selecting the 'Select',  'Append' and  'Print'  options and<br>
clicking OK when the final selection is made.<br>
e.	Printing the page by the print spooler.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
According to the'present invention, a user can print separate blocks of data in individual pages of a document by selecting those data blocks alone to be printed and finally giving the print command. The selected data blocks in individual pages of the document then gets printed in a continued format, rather than in separate pages, thereby saving paper or avoiding wastage of paper.<br>
The present invention performs the above said functionality by introducing a new block called "Append Job Manager (AJM)". With the help of this Append Job Manager, two new options are available for the user at the print driver, 1. Append; and<br><br>
2. Print When the user wants to select different data blocks in multiple places of a document, the user will be provided with an option in which he can either print the selected data block immediately and get it printed on a single page (subject to the size of the contents) or he can append that print job (data block selected to be printed) to the print job waiting to append. This append option is shown in figure 5.<br>
When the user selects a data block for the first time and chooses the 'Selection' and 'Append' option, a new job will be created. From there onwards, when the user selects a next data block and clicks the 'Selection' and 'Append' option, the selected data block will be appended to the earlier selected data block. All the selected data blocks will be finally printed in a single resultant document when the user clicks the 'Selection' 'Append' and 'Print' option (shown in figure 5). These functions are managed and done by the Append Job Manager or AJM.<br>
Now, the functions of the Append Job Manager can be explained with reference to figure 6 as follows:<br>
When a user selects a first data block and clicks on 'Selection' and 'Append' option, a new job will be created (job 1). This new job will be sent by the print driver to the AJM. AJM in turn sends the job 1 to spooler queue if the user has finally selected print option.<br><br>
Now onwards, we'll call the job 1 as 'waiting to be printed job'.'Waiting to be printed job' is a job that is ready to be printed but will not be printed until it gets a print command from the print driver.<br>
When the user selects the next data block and clicks on the 'Selection' and 'Append' option, this data will be sent by the print driver to AJM. AJM appends it to the 'waiting to be printed job' (job 1). The same steps are repeated for all the different data blocks selected. For each data block selected, the data will be created and will be appended to the 'waiting to be printed job'.<br>
Finally, when the user selects the last data block and clicks on Selection, Append and Print option, the AJM will append the last selected data block to the 'waiting to be printed job', closes the 'waiting to be printed job', and then passes this print job to the print spooler. The print Job then gets printed as a single job as any regular job from print spooler.<br>
In the above mentioned functionality of the AJM (w.r.t figure 6), only one 'waiting to be printed job' is maintained. However, this facility can be extended to maintain a queue for 'waiting to be printed jobs' (shown in figure 7 as 'wait queue at AJM'). In this case, if a data block is selected and the options 'Selection' and 'Append' are chosen, then an additional window will open containing the list of waiting to be printed jobs (wait job 1,wait job 2 etc.,). The user can append the selected data block to any one of those 'waiting to be printed job(s)'. The 'waiting to be printed job' - which the user chooses to print -<br><br>
will be then sent by the AJM to the spooler queue and can be printed from the print spooler.<br>
Figure 4 shows the flowchart which explains the sequence of operations that occurs as per the present invention, which takes advantage of the Append Job Manager and provides append option to the user.<br>
The steps involved in the current invention are given below,<br>
1.	User selects data block at application.<br>
2.	Go to File-&gt;Print option<br>
3.	Select option as Select and Append as shown in figure 5,<br>
4.	Press OK<br>
These four steps are repeated for different data blocks in multiple places of the original document.<br>
5. Click Select, Append and Print option and press OK for last data block selected.<br>
Now, all the selected data blocks will get printed as a single resultant document instead of getting the data blocks printed in separate pages.<br>
With the present invention:<br><br>
•	The User can select different data blocks and print them as one print job.<br>
•	User can edit and arrange these print blocks in the job.<br>
•	Different files can be appended and print together as one job.<br>
•	Minimal paper wastage as different selected print jobs can be printed on<br>
the same paper.<br><br>

It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br>
