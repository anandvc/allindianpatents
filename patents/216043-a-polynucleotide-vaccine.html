				<td>		The present invention relates to methods and compositions useful in the treatment and<br>
	prevention of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and the symptoms and diseases associated<br>
5	therewith. In particular the present invention relates to DNA vaccines comprising<br>
	polynucleotide sequences encoding the HCV core protein and at least one additional HCV<br>
	protein, and methods of treatment of individuals infected with HCV comprising<br>
	administration of the vaccines of the present invention.<br>
		HCV was identified recently as the leading causative agent of post-transfusion and<br>
10	 community acquired non A, nun B hepatitis. Approximately 170m people are chronically<br>
	infected with HCV, with prevalence between 1-10%. The health care cost in the US, where<br>
	 the prevalence is 1.8%, is estimated to be $2 billion. Between 40-60% of liver disease is due<br>
	to HCV and 30% UK transplants arc for ECV infections. Although HCV is initially a sub-<br>
	clinical infection more than 90% of patients develop chronic disease. The disease process<br>
15	 typically develops from chronic active hepatitis (70%), fibrosis, cirrhosis (40%) to liepato-<br>
	cellular carcinoma (60%). Infection to cirrhosis has a median time of 20 years and that for<br>
	hepato-cellujar carcinoma of 20 years (Lauer G.and Walker B. 2001, N. Engl J. Med 345, 41,<br>
	Cohen J. 2001, Science 285 (5424) 2G).<br>
		There is a great need for the unproved treatment of HCV. The current gold standard<br>
20	 of ribavhin and PEGyhtted interferon represents the mainstay for treating HCV infection.<br>
	However the ability of the current regimens to achieve sustained response remains sub-<br>
	optimal (overall 50% response rate for up to 6 months, however, for genotype lb the<br>
	 response rate is lower (27%). This treatment is also associated with unpleasant side effects.<br>
		This results in high fall out rale, especially after first 6 months of treatment.<br>
25	 Several studies have shown that the individual HCV proteins are immunogenic in<br>
	normal mice, including following immunisation with DNA. Several HCV vaccines are<br>
	currently in clinical trial for either prophylaxis or therapy. The most advanced are currently in<br>
	Phase 2 by Chiron and. Innogenetics using El or E2 envelope proteins. An epitope vaccine by<br>
	Transvax is also in Phase 2. Several vaccines are in preclinical development which use<br>
30	 sequences from core and non-structural antigens using a variety of delivery systems including<br>
	DNA.<br>

WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
		HCV is a positive strand RNA virus of the flaviviradae femily, whose genome is<br>
	9.4ko in length, with one open reading frame. The HCV genome is translated as a single<br>
	polyprotein, which is then processed by host and viral proteases to produce structural proteins<br>
	(core,, envelope El aad E2, and p7) and six non-structural proteins with, various enzymatic<br>
5	 activities. The genome of the HCV J4L6 isolate, which is an example of the lb genotype, is<br>
	found as accession number AFD54247 (Yanagi,M., St Claire.M., Shapiro, M, Emerson.S. U,<br>
	Purcell, R H. and Bukh,J. "Transcripts of a chimeric cDNA clone of hepatitis C virus<br>
	genotype lb are infectious in vivo". Virology 244 (I), ]	 61-172 (1998)), and is shown in<br>
	Figure l.<br>
10 		The envelope proteins ate responsible for recognition, binding and entry of virus onto<br>
	target cells. The major non-structural proteins involved in viral replication include N S2 (Zn<br>
	dependent netaloprateinase), NS3 (serinc protease / belicase), NS4A (protease co-factor),<br>
	NS4B, NS5A and MS5B (RHA polymerase)( Bartenscnlager B and Lohmatin V. 2000.<br>
	Replication of hepatitis C virus- 1. Gen Virol 81,1531).<br>
15 The structure of the HCV polyprotein can be represented as follows (the figures refer<br>
	to the position of the first amino acid of each protein; the full polypiotein of the J4L6 isolate<br>
	is 3010 amino acids in length)<br>
Core1-191	El	E2	P7	NS2	NS31027-1657	NS4A	NS4B1712-1972	NS5A	NS5B2420-3010	<br>
		The virus has a high mutation rate and at least six major genotypes have been defined<br>
20	 based in the nucleotide sequence of conserved and non-conserved regions. However there is<br>
	additional heterogeneity as HCV isolated from a single patient is always presented as a <br>
	mixture of closely related genomes, or quasi-species.<br>
		The HCV genome shows a high degree of genetic variation, which has been classified<br>
	into 6 major genotypes (la, lb. 2,3, 4, 5, and 6). Genotypes la, lb, 2 and 3 are the most<br>
25	 prevalent in Europe, North and South America, Asia, China, Japan said Australia. Genotypes<br>
	4 and 5 are predominant in Africa and genotype 6 S.E Asia.<br>
		There is a great need for improved treatments of HCV infection and also to provide<br>
	treatments that are diverse in the ability to treat a number of HCV genotypes,<br>
		HCV vaccines comprising polynucleotides encoding one or more HCV proteins have<br>
30	 been described. Vaccines comprisbg plasmid DNA or Semliki Forest Virus vectors encoding<br>

WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	NS3 were described by Brinster et al. (2002, Journal of General Virology,, 83,369-381).<br>
	Polynucleotide vaccines encodirigNS5B are disclosed in "WO 99/51781, Codon optimised<br>
	genes, and vaccines comprising them, encoding HCV El, E1+E2 fusions, NS5A and NS5B<br>
	proteins are described in WO 97/47358. WO 03/04149 discloses polypeptides or<br>
5	 polynudeotides encoding mosaics of HCV epitopes, derived from within Core, NS3, NS4 or<br>
	NS5A. Fusion protein, and DMA encoding such fusion proteins, comprising NS3, NS4,,<br>
	NS5A and NS5B, that are useful in vaccines are described in WO 01/30812; optionally the<br>
	fusion proteins ane said to comprise fragments of the Core protein. WO 03/031586 describes<br>
	an adenovirus vector, that is suitable for use as a vaccine, which encodes the HCV proteins<br>
10	 NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B.<br>
		Vaccin.es comprising polypeptides comprising "unprocessed" core protein and a non-<br>
	 structural protein are described in WO 96/37606.<br>
		It is desirable to include in a polynucleotide vaccine, a gene that encodes the Core<br>
	protein and at least one other HCV protein. However, it ia known that the co-expression of<br>
15	 Core and other HCV proteins within the same cell can lead to a decrease in the level of<br>
	production of the other HCV protein in comparison with thai produced in a cell where the<br>
	Cote protein is not co-expressed. For this reason the art is relatively silent about the use of the<br>
	Core protein ia polynacleotide vaccines.<br>
		The present invention provides a solution to this problem, and provides a<br>
20	 polynucleotide vaccine comprising a polynucleotide sequence that encodes the HCV Core<br>
	protein and a polynucleotide sequence that encodes at least one other HCV protein, wherein<br>
	the vaccine causes expression of the proteins within the same cell, and wherein the sequence<br>
	 of the polynucleotide encoding the core protein has been mutated or is positioned relative to<br>
	the polynudootide sequence encoding the at least one other HCV protein in such a way that<br>
25	 the negative effect of expression of the Core protein upon the expression o f the said at least<br>
	one other HCV protein is reduced, or abrogated.<br>
		It has been found that the reduction or prevention of the down regulation of<br>
	expression of other HCV proteins by the expression of the core protein, leads to the increase<br>
	in the magnitude of the immune response raised against the other HCV proteins. Preferably<br>
30	 the increase in magnitude of immune response against the non-core HCV protein is two fold<br>
	or greater, as measured by ELISPOT measuring the numbers of EL-2 producing splenocytes<br>
	after vaccination and restimilation in vitro with antigen,<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
		The vaccines of the present invention are designed in such a way that the down<br>
	regulation effect of Core upon the expression levels of the other HCV proteins is reduced or<br>
	abrogated. It is preferred that the polynucleotide vaccines of the present invention cause the<br>
	production of the non-core HCV protein in a cell, at a quantity that is not less than 50% of the<br>
5	 quantity that is produced by transfection of the tells with an equivalent amount of a similar<br>
	vaccine that does not cause expression of the Core protein within the same cell More<br>
	preferably, the polynucleotides cause the production of the non-core HCV protein in a cell at<br>
	a level that is not less than 60%, more preferably not less than 70%, more preferably not less<br>
	than 80%, more preferably not less than 90%, and most preferably not less than 95% of the<br>
10	 levels that are produced by transfection of the cells with an equivalent amount of a similar<br>
	vaccine that does not cause expression of the Core protein within ibe same cell. Most<br>
	preferably the levels of protein production are measured using Western Blot techniques<br>
	revealed by real-time chemiluminescent technology<br>
		Most preferably the vaccine is designed such that the core protein is present in an<br>
15	expression cassette that is downstream of an expression cassette that encodes the other HCV<br>
	protein, or alternatively the amino acid sequence of the core protein is mutated.<br>
		The at least one other HCV antigen encoded by the polynucleotide vaccines of the<br>
	invention may be any of the non-Core ECV proteins, such as E1, E2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B,<br>
	KS5A, NS5B or p7. Preferably, however,the other HCV protein are selected from NS3;<br>
20	 NS4B and NS5B. Preferably, the polynucleotide vaccines of the present invention do not<br>
	vaccines of the present invention encode the Core protein or mutated Core protein (mCore)<br>
	and NS3, NS4B and NS5B HCV proteins, and no other HCV protein. The present invention<br>
	also provides the use of a polynucleotide vaccine encoding these antigens in medicine, and in<br>
25	 the manufacture of A medicament for the treatment, or prevention, of an HCV infection.<br>
		The polynucleotide sequences used in the vaccines of the present invention are<br>
	preferably DNA sequences.<br>
		The polynudeotides encoding the HCV proteins maybe in many combinations or<br>
	configurations. For example, the proteins may be expressed as individual proteins, or as<br>
30	 fusion proteins. An example of a fusion, which could either be at the DNA or protein level,<br>
	would be a double fusion which consists of a single polypeptide or polynucleotide containing<br>
	or encoding the amino acid sequences of NS4B and NS5B (NS4B-NS5B), a triple fusion<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	containing or encoding the amino acid sequences of NS3-NS4B-NS5B, or a fusion of all four<br>
	antigens of the present invention (mCora-NS3-NS4B-NS5B)<br>
		Preferred fusions of the present invention are polynucleotides that encode the double<br>
	fusion between NS4B and NS5B (NS4B-NS5B or NS5B-NS4B); and between Core or<br>
5	 mCore and NS3 (HS3-mCore or mCore-NS3). Preferred triple fusions are polynucleotides<br>
	that encode the amino acid sequences of NS3-NS4B-NS5B.<br>
		Preferably the polynuclootides encoding each antigen are present in the same<br>
	expression vector or plasmid such that expression of the HCV proteins occurs in the same<br>
	cell. In this context the polynucleotide encoding the HCV proteins may be in a single<br>
10	 expression cassette, or in multiple in series expression cassettes within the same<br>
	polynucleotide vector.<br>
		The biological functions of HCV core protein are complex and do nor correlate with<br>
	discrete point mutations (McLauchlan 1.2000. Properties of the hepatitis C virus core<br>
	protein: a structural protein that modulates cellular processes, I of Viral Hepatitis 7, 2-4).<br>
15	There is evidence that core directly interacts with the lymphotoxin β receptor, and can also<br>
	interfere with NFKB and PKR pathways and can influence cell survival and apoptosis. A<br>
	recombinant vaccinia construct expressing core was found to inhibit cellular responses to<br>
	vaccinia making it more virulent in vivo.<br>
		During an infection, the Core protein is cleaved at two sites from the viral polypiotein<br>
20	 by host cell proteases. The first cleavage is at 191 which generates the N-terminal end of El.<br>
	The residue at which the second cleavage takes place has not been precisely located and lies<br>
	between amino acids 174 and 191 thereby liberating a short Core peptide sequence of<br>
	 approximately 17 amino acids in length (McLauchlan J, (2000) J. Viral Hepatitis. 7,2-14;<br>
	YasuiK, Lan IYR Mizokami M, et al, J. Virol 1998. 72 604S-6055),<br>
25 		The Core polypeptides encoded in the vaccines of the preset invention are either full<br>
	length or in a inncated form.<br>
		In order to optimise the expression of the other HCV proteins, the polynucleotide<br>
	encoding the HCV Core protein of mCore protein is preferably present in an expression<br>
	cassette that is downstream of an expression cassette that contains the polynuclcotide that<br>
30	 encodes al least one of the other HCV proteins. Preferably the HCV Core protein is<br>
	i preferably present in an expression cassette that is downatream of an expression cassette that<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	contains the polymcleotide that encodes NS5B. ln this context is it possible for Core protein<br>
	to be expnessed in fusion with the HCV NS3 protein.<br>
		In outer to minimise the negative effect of Core upon the production of other HCV<br>
	proteins in the same cell the Core potein used is a truncated protein. This aspect of the<br>
5	 present invention is particularly preferred if the core protein is not encoded by a<br>
	polynucleotide present in an expression cassette that is downstream of an expression cassette<br>
	that contains the polynucleotide that encodes the other HCV protein. Also, this aspect of the<br>
	present invention is preferred if the Core protein is to be present as part of a fusion protein,<br>
	comprising Core and the other HCV protein sequence. In this aspect of the present invention<br>
10	 it is preferred that the Core protein that is encoded is truncated from the carboxy terminal end<br>
	in a sufficient amount to reduce the inhibitory effect of Core upon the expression of other<br>
	HCV proteins. Most preferably the Core protein is truncated from the carboxy teerminal end<br>
	such that the sequence of the protein produced lacks the naturally liberated C-terninal<br>
	peptide sequence arising from the second cleavage of Core; more preferably the protein lacks<br>
15	 at least the last 10 amino acids, preferably lacks at least the last 15 amino acids, more<br>
	preferably lacks the 20 amino acids, more preferably lacks the last 26 amino acids and<br>
	most preferably lacks the last 40 amino acids. The most preferred polynucldeotides encoding<br>
	Core that are suitable far use in the present invention are those that encode a truncated core<br>
	containing the amino acids 1-l71,1-165, 1-151. Most preferably the polynucleotide encoding<br>
20	 Core that is suitable for use in the present invention is that which encodes a truncated Core<br>
	protein between amino acids I -151. One or more consensus mutations as set forth in<br>
	example I may be present.<br>
		The other non-core HCV polypeptides encoded, by the oligonuclootide vaccines of the<br>
	present invention may comprise the full length amino acid sequence or alternatively the<br>
25	 polypeptides may be shorter than the full length protein in that they comprise a sufficient<br>
	proportion of the full length polynucleotide sequence to enable the expression product of the<br>
	shortened gene to generate an immune response which cross reacts with the full length<br>
	protein. For example, a polynucleoride of the invention may encode a fragment of a HCV<br>
	protein which is a trucated HCV protein in which regions of the original sequence have been<br>
30	 deleted, the final fragment comprisng less than 90% of the original full length amino acid<br>
	sequence, and maybe less than 70% or less than 50% of the original sequence. Alternatively<br>
	speaking, a poiynucleotide which encodes a fragment of at least 3, for example 8-10 amino<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	acids or up to 20, 50, 60, 70, 80, l00, 150 or 200 amino acids in length is considered to fall<br>
	within scope of the invention as long as the encoded oligo or polypeptide demonstrates<br>
	HCV antigericity. In particular, but not exclusively, this aspect of the invention encompasses<br>
	the situation when the polynucleotide encodes a fragment of a complete HCV protein<br>
5	 sequence and may represent one or more discrete epitopes of that protein.<br>
		In preferred vaccines of the present invention at least one, and preferably all, of the<br>
	HCV polypeptides are inactivated by truncation or mutation. For example the helicase and<br>
	protease activity of NS3 is preferably reduced or abolished by mutation of the gene,<br>
	Preferably NS5B polymetaso activity of the expressed polypeptide is reduced or abolished by<br>
10	 mutation. Preferably N54B activity of the expressed polypeptide is reduced of abolished by<br>
	mutation Preferably activity of the Core protein of the expressed potypeptide is reduced or<br>
	 abolished by truncation or mutation. Mutation in this sense could comprise an addition,<br>
	deletion, substitution or rearragement event to polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide.<br>
	Allernatively the full length sequence may be expressed in two or more separate parts,<br>
15		 The functional structure and enzymatic function of the HCV polypeptides NS3 and<br>
	NS5B are described in the art.<br>
		NS5B has heen described as an ENA-dependent RNA polymerase Qin et al,, 200lt<br>
	Hepatology, 33, pp 72S-737; Lohman et at, 2000, Journal of Viral Hepatitis; Lohmann et<br>
	al., 1997, Nov., Journal of Virology, 84l6-8428; De Francesco et al, 2000, Seminars in<br>
20	 Liver Disease, 20(1), 69-83. The N85B polypeptide has been described as having four<br>
	functional motifs A, B, C and D.<br>
		Preferably the NS5B polypcptide sequence encoded by polynucleotidc vaccines of the<br>
	 present invention is mutated to reduce or remove RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity.<br>
	Preferably the polypeptide is mutated to disrupt motif A of NS5B, for example a substitution<br>
25	 of the Aspartic acid (D) in position 2639 to Glycine (G); or a substitution of Aspartic acid (D)<br>
	2644 to Glycine G). Preferably, the NS5B polypeptide encoded by the vaccine<br>
	polynucleotide contains both of these Aspartic acid mutations.<br>
		Preferably, the encoded NS5B contains a disruption in. its motif C. For example,<br>
	Mutstion of D2737, an invariant aspartic acid residue, to H, N or E leads to the complete<br>
30	 inactivation of NS5B.<br>
		Preferably the NS5B encoded by the PNA vaccines of the present invention comprise<br>
	a motif A mission which may optionally comprorise a motif X mutaion. Preferred motations<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	in motif A include Aspastic add (D) 2639 to Glycine awl aspartic acid (D) 2644 Glycine.<br>
	Preferably both mutations are present. Additional further consensus mutations may be<br>
	present, as set forth below in example 1.<br>
		NS3 has been described as having both protease and belicase activity.The NS3<br>
5	 polypeptides encoded by the DNA vaccines of the present invention are preferably mutated to<br>
	disrupt both the protease and helicase activities of NS3. It is known that the protease activity<br>
	of NS3 is linked to the linked to the “catalytic triad” of H-1083, D-l107 and S-l165. Preferably the NS3<br>
	encoded by the vaccines of the present invention comprises a mutation in the Catalytic triad<br>
	residues, and most preferably the N33 comprises single point mutation of Serine 1165 to<br>
10	voline (De Francesco, R., Pessi, a and Steinkuhler C.1993. The hepatitis C Virus NS3<br>
	proteinase : structure and function of a zinc containing proteinase. Anti- Viral Therapy 3, 1-<br>

	The structure and function of NSE can be represented as:<br>

15<br>

	30- 100 amino acids from the N-terminus, more preferably between 40-80 amino acids, and<br>
	most preferably adeletion of fhe first N-tenriinaJ 48 amino acids (in tbe context of the J4 L6<br>
	isolate this corresponds to a. truncation to amino acid 176Q, which is a loss of the first 48<br>
	amino acids of NS4B; equivalent truncations in other HCV isolates also from part of the<br>
5	 present invention). Additionally, the NS4B sequence may be divided into two or more<br>
	fragments and expressed in a potypeptide having the sequence of NS4B arranged in a<br>
	different order to that found in the wild-type molecule.<br>
		The polynucleotides which are present in the vaccines of tbe present invention may<br>
	comprise the natural nucleotidc .sequence as found in the HCV virus however it is preferred<br>
10	 that the nucleotide sequence is codon optimised for expression in mammalian cells.<br>
	In addition to codon optimisation, it is preferred that the codon usage in the<br>
	 polynucleotides of tbe present invention encoding HCV Core, NS3, NS4B and NS5B is<br>
	altered such that rare codons do not appear in concentrated clusters, and are on the contrary<br>
	either relatively evenly spaced throughout the polynucleotide sequence, or are excluded from<br>
15	 the codon optimised gene.<br>
		The DNA code bas 4 letters {A, T,C and G) and uses these to spell three letter<br>
	"codoos" which represent the amino adds of the proteins encoded in. an organism's genes.<br>
	The linear sequence of cadon along the DNA molecule is translated into the linear sequence<br>
	of amino acids in the protein(s) encoded by those genes. The code is highly degenerate, with<br>
20	 61 condons coding for the 20 natural amino acids and 3 codons representing "stop" signlas,<br>
	Thus, most amino acids are coded for by more than one codon - in fact several arc coded for<br>
	by four or more different codons.<br>
		Where mow than one codon is availabl to cods for given amino acid, it has been<br>
	observed that the codon usage patterns of organisms are highly nor-random. Different<br>
25	 species show a different bias in their codon selection and, furthermore, utilisation of codons<br>
	may be markedly different in a single species between genes which are expressed at high and<br>
	low levels. This bias is different in viruses, plants, bacteria and mammalian cells, and some<br>
	species show a stronger bias away from random codon selection than others. For example,<br>
	humans and other mammals are less strongly biased than certain bacteria or viruses. For these-<br>
30	 reasons, there is a significant probability that a mammalian gene expressed in E,coli or a viral<br>
	gene expressed in mammalian cells will have an inappropriate distribution of colons far<br>
	efficient expression. However, a gene with a codon usage pattern suitable for E.coli<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	expression may also be efficiently expressed in humans. It is believed that the presence in a<br>
	heterologous DNA sequence of dusters of codons which are rardy observed in the host in<br>
	which expression is to occur, is predictive of low heterologous expression levels in that host.<br>
	There are several examples where changing codons from those which are rare in the<br>
5	 host to those which are host-preferred ("codon optimisation") has enhanced heterologous<br>
	expression levels, for example the BPV {bovine papilloma virus) late genes I,I and I.2 have<br>
	been codon optimised for mammalian condon usage patterns and this has been shown to give<br>
	increased expression levels over the wild-type HPV sequences in mammlian (Cos-1) cell<br>
	culture (Zhou et. al. j. Virol 1993. 73, 4972-4982). In this work, every BPV codon which<br>
10	 occured more thatn twice as frequency in BPV than in mammals (ratio of usage&gt;2), and<br>
	most codons with a usage ration of &gt;1.5 were conservatively replaced by the preferentially<br>
	used mammalian codon. In WO97/31115, WO97/48370 and WO98/3460 (Merck &amp; Co.<br>
	Inc.) codon optimisation of HIV genes or segments thereof has been shown to result in<br>
	increased protein expression and improved imnunogcnicity when the codon optimised<br>
15	 sequences are used as DNA vaccines in the host mammal for which the optimisation was<br>
	tailored. In these documnents, the sequences consist entirely of optimised codons (except<br>
	where this would introduce an undesired restriction site; intron splice site etc,} because cash<br>
	viral codon is conservativety replaced with the optimal codon for the intended host.<br>
		The term "codon usage pattern" refers to the average frequenciese for all codons in the<br>
20	 nucleotide sequence, gene or class of genes under discussion (e.g. highly expressed<br>
	mammalian genes), Codon usage patterns for mammals, including humans can be found in<br>
	the literature (sec e.g. Nakatmura et.aL Nucleic Acids Resesrth 1996,24:214-215).<br>
		In the polynutlcotides of the present invention, the todon usagc pattern is preferably<br>
	altered from that typical of HCV to mote closely represent the codon bias of the target<br>
25	 organism, e.g. E.coli or a mammal, especially a human. The "cedon usage coefficient" or<br>
	codon adaptation index (Sharp PM Li WH. Nucleic Acids Research. 15 (3): 1281-95,1987 )<br>
	is a measure of how closely the codon usage pattern of a given polynucleotide sequence<br>
	resembles that of a target species, The codon frequencies for each of the 61 codons<br>
	expressed as the number of occurrences per 1000 codons of five selected class of genes) are<br>
30	 normalised for each of hte twenty natural amino acids, so that the value for the most<br>
	freqeuntly used codon for each amino acid is set to 1 and the frequencies for the less common<br>
	codons are scaled proportionaly to lie between zero and 1. Thus each of the 61 codons is<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	assigned a value of 1 or lower for the highly expressed genes of the target species. This is<br>
	referred to as the preference value (W). In order to calculate a codon usage coefficient for a<br>
	specific polynucleotide, relative to the highly expressed genes of that species, the scaled<br>
	value for each codon of the specific polynucleotidc are noted and the geometric mean of all<br>
5	 these values is taken (by dividing the sum of the natural logs of these values by the total<br>
	number of oodons and take the anti-log). The coefficient will have a value between zero and<br>
	1 and the higher the coefficient the more codons in the polynucleotide are frequently used<br>
	codons. If a polynucleotide sequence has a codon usage coefficient of 1, all of the codons are<br>
	"most frequent" codons for highly- expressed genes of the target species,<br>
10	 The present invention provides polynuclcotide sequences which encode HCV Core,<br>
	NS3, NS4B or NS5B amino acid sequences, wherein thecodon usage pattern of the<br>
	 polyuncleotide sequence resembles that of highly expressed mammalian genes. Preferably the<br>
	polynucleotide sequence is a DNA sequence. Desirably the codon usage pattern of the<br>
	polyuncleotide sequence resembles that of highly expressed human genes.<br>
15	 The codon optimise polyunleotide sequence encoding HCV core (1-191) is shown<br>
	in Figure 2. The codon optimised polynuleotide sequence encoding HCV NS3, comprising<br>
	the SI 165V and D1316Q polypeptide mutation, is shown in Figure 3, The codon optimised<br>
	polynucleotide sequence encoding HCV HS4B, comprising the N terminal 1-48 truncation of<br>
	the polypeptide, is shown in Figure 4. The codon optimised polynucleotide sequence<br>
20	 encoding HCV NCS5B, comprising the D2639G aad D2644G polypeptide mutation, is shown<br>
	in Figme5.<br>
		Accordingly, there is provided a synthetic gene comprising a plurality of codons<br>
	 together encoding HCV Core, NS3, NS4Bor NS5B amino acid sequences to form, vaccines<br>
	of the present invention wherein the selection of the possible codons used for encoding the<br>
35	 amino acid sequence has been changed to resemble the optimal mammalian codon usage such<br>
	that the frequency of codon usage inthe synthetic gene more closely resembles that of highly<br>
	expressed mammalian genes than that of Hepatitis C virus genes. Preferably rlie codon usage<br>
	pattern is substantially the same as that for highly expressed human genes. The "natural"<br>
	HCV core, NS3, N34B and NS5B sequences have been analysed for codon usage. The<br>
30	 Codon usage coefficient for the HCV prateins are Core (0.4S7), N S3 (0.482), NS4B (0.481)<br>
	and HS5B (0.459), A polynunclotide of the present invention will generally have a codon<br>
	usage coefficient (as defined above) for highly expressed human genes of greater thatn 0.5,<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	preferably greater than 0.6, most preferably greater than 0.7 but less than 1. Desirably the<br>
	polynucleotide will also have a codon usage coefficient for highly expressed E.coli genes of<br>
	greater than 0.5, preferably greater than 0.6, most preferably greater than 0.7,<br>
		In addition to Codon optimisation the synthetic genes are also mutated so as to<br>
5	 exclude the appearance of clusters of rare codons. This can be achieved in one of two ways.<br>
	The prefereed way of achieving this is to exclude tare codons from, the gene sequence. One<br>
	method to define rare codons would te codons representing 
	particular amino acid and preferably 
	highly expressed genes of the target organism . Alternatively rare codons may be defienes as<br>
10	 codons with a relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) value of 
	highly expressed genes of the target organism. An RSCU value is the observed number of<br>
	codons divided by the number expected if all codons for that amino acid were used equall<br>
	frequently. An propriate definition of a rare codon would be apparent to a person stalled in<br>
	the art.<br>
15 		Alternativley the HCV core, NS3, NS4B and NS5B polyuucleotides are optimised to<br>
	prevent clustening of rare, non-optimal, codons being present in concentrated areas. The<br>
	polynucleotides, therefore, are optimised such that individual rare to codons, such as those with<br>
	an RSCU of 
	polynucleotides.<br>
20 		The vaccines of the present invention may comprise a vector that directs individual<br>
	expression of the HCV polypeptides, alternatively the HCV polynucleotides may be expressed<br>
	as one or more fusion proteins.<br>

	or polynucleotide level, including:<br>

		For HCV combinations E-L above, it is intended that the terminology used, eg.<br>
	(CoreNS3) + (NS4B5B), read to disclose a polynucleotide vector comprising two<br>
	expression cassettes each independently controlled by a individual promoter, and in the tase<br>

	turmeated to 1760-1972 remove N-terminal highly variable fragment)<br>
20 		The present invention provides the novel DNA vaccines and polynucleotide as<br>
	described above. Also provided by the present invention are analogues of the described<br>
	polypeptides and DNA vaccines comprising them.<br>
		The terns " analogue" refers to a polynucleotide which encodes the same amino acid.<br>
	sequence as another polymeleotide of the present invention but which, through the<br>
25	 redundancy of the genetic code, has a different nucleotide sequence whilst maintaining the<br>
	same codon usage pattern, for example having the same codon usage coefficient or a codon<br>
	usage coefficient within 0.1, preferably within 0.05 of that of the other polynucleotide .<br>
		The HCV polynucleotide sequences may be derived from any of the various HCV<br>
	genotypes, strains or isolates. HCV isolates can be classified into the following six major<br>
30	 genotypes comprising one or more subtypes:HCV l(la lb or lc),HCV 2(2a, 2b or 3c)<br>
	HCV 3 (3a, 3b, 10a), HCV 4 (4a), HCV 5 (5a) and HCV 6 (6a, 6b, 7b, 8b 9a and 11a);<br>

14<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	protein may be derived from the polynucleotide sequence of the same HCV genotype or<br>
	subtype, or altenatively any combinatiuon of HCV genotype or subtype, and HCV protein<br>
	may be used. Preferably, the genss are derived from a type lb genotype such as the infectious<br>
	clone J4L.6 (Accession No AF0542478 - see figure 1).<br>
5 		Specific strains that have been sequent include HCV-J {Kato et al1990, PNAS,<br>
	USA, 87;9724-528) and BK (Takamizawa et al, 1991, J.Virol. 65: 1105-1113).<br>
		The polynucleotides according to the invention have utility in the production by<br>
	expression of lie encoded proteins, which expession may tate place in vitro, in vivo or ex<br>
	vivo. The nucleotides may therefore be involved in recombimant protein) synthesis for<br>
10	 example to increase yields, or indeed my find use as therpeutic agents in their own right,<br>
	utilised in DNA vaccination techniques. Where the polynucleotides of present invention<br>
	 are used in the production of the encoded proteins in vitro or ex vivo, cells, for example in<br>
	cell culture, will be modified to include the polynucleotide to be expressed. Such cells<br>
	include transient, or preferably stable mammalian cell lines. Particular examples of cells<br>
15	 which may be modified by insertion of vectors encoding for a polyproteins according to the<br>
	invention includes mammalian HEK293T, CHO, HaLa, 293 and COS cells. Preferably the<br>
	cell line selected will be one which is not only stable, but also allows for mature<br>
	glycosylation and cell surface expression of a polyprotein. Expression may be achieved in<br>
	transformed cocytes, A polypeptide may be expressed from a polynucleotide of the present<br>
20	 invention, in cells of a transgenic non-human animal, preferably a mouse. A transgenic non-<br>
	human animal expressing a polypeptide than a polynucleotide of the invention is included<br>
	within the scope of the invention.<br>
		The present invention includes expression. vectors that comprise the nucleotide<br>
	 sequence of the invention. Such expression vectors are routinely constructed in the art of<br>
25	 molecular biology and may for example involve the use of plasmid DNA and appropriate<br>
	initiators, promoters, enhancers and other elements, inch as for example polyadenylation<br>
	signals which njay be necessary, and which are positioned in the correct orientation, in order<br>
	to allow for protein expression. Other suitable vectors would be apparent to persons skilled in<br>
	the art. By way of furrthar example, in this, regard we refer to Sambrook et al Molecular;<br>
30	 Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Edition CSH Laboratory Press. (1989).<br>
		Preferably, a polynucleotide of the invention, or for use in the invention in a vector, is<br>
	operrably linked to a control sequence which is capable of providing for the expression of the<br>
15 <br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	coding sequence by the host cell, i.e, the vector is an expression vector. The term "openably<br>
	linked refers to a juxtaposition wherein the components described are in a relationship<br>
	permitting them to fraction in their intended manner. A regulatory sequence, such as a<br>
	promoter, "operably linked" to a coding sequence is positioned in such a way that expression<br>
5	 of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the regulatory sequence.<br>
		An expression cassette is an assembly which is capable of directing the expression of<br>
	the sequence or gene of interest. The expression cassette comprises control elements, such as<br>
	a promoter which is operably linked to the gene of interest.<br>
		The vectors may be, for example, plasmids, artificial chromosomes (e.g , BAC, PAC,<br>
10	 YAC), virus or phage vectors provided with. an origin of replication, optionally a promoter<br>
	for the expression of the polynucleotide and optionally a regulator of the promoter. The<br>
	vectors may contain one or more selectable marker genes, for example an ampicilin or<br>
	kanamycin resistance gene in the case of a bacterial plasmid or a resistance gene for a fungal<br>
	vector. Vedors may be used in vitro, for example for the production of DNA or RNA or<br>
15	 used to transfect or transform a host cell, for example, a mammalian host cell e.g. for the<br>
	production of protein encoded by the vector. The vectors may also be adapted to be used in<br>
	vivo, for example in a method of DNA vaccination or of genes therapy.<br>
		Promoters and other expression regulation signals may be selected to be compatible<br>
	with the host cell for which expression is designed. For example, mammalian promoters<br>
20	 include the metallothionein promoter, which can be induced in response to heavy metals such<br>
	as cadmium, and. the β-actin promoter. Viral promoters such, as the SV40 large T antigen.<br>
	promoter, human cytomegalovirus (CMV) inimediate early (IE) promoter, rous sarcoma virus<br>
	LTR promoter, adenovirus promoter, or an HPV promoter, particularly the HPV upstream<br>
	regulatory region (URK) may also be used. All these promoters are well described and<br>
25	 readily available in the art.<br>
		Examples of suitable viral vectors include herpes simplex viral vectors, vaccinia or<br>
	alpha-vims vectors and retrovirus, including lentivirus, adenoviruses and adeno-<br>
	associated viruses. Gene transfer techniques using these viruses are known to those skilled in<br>
	the art. Retrovirus vectors for example may be used to stably integrate the polynucleotide of<br>
30	 the invention into the host genome, although such recombination is not preferred.<br>
Replication-defective adenovirus vectors by contrast remain episomal and therefore allow<br>
	transient expression. Vectors capable of driving expression on in insect cells (for example<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	becelovrius vectors), in human cells or in bacteria may be emloyed in order to produce<br>
	quantities of the HCV protein encoded by the polynucleotide of the present invention, for<br>
	example for use as subumit vaccines or in immunoassays..<br>
		In a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
5	comprising a polynucleotide sequence as described herein. Preferably the composition<br>
	comprises as a DNA vector according to the second aspect of the present invention. In preferred<br>
	embodiments the composition comprises a plurality of particles, preferably gold particles,<br>
	coated with DNA comprising a vector encoding a polynucleotide sequence which encode an<br>
	HCV-amino acid sequence, wherein the codon usage pattern of the polynucleotide sequence<br>
10	 resembles that of highly expressed mammalian genes particularly human genes. In<br>
	alternative embodiments, the composition comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient<br>
	 and a DNA vector according to the second aspect of the present invention. The composition<br>
	may also include and adjuvant..<br>
		DNA vaccines may be delivered by interstitial administration of liquid vaccines into<br>
15	 the muscle (WO90/11092) or by mechanism other than intrs-muscular injection. For<br>
	example, delivay into the skin takes advantage ol the fact that immune mechanisms are<br>
	highly active in tissues that are barriers to infection such as skin and mucous membrances.<br>
	Delivery into skin could be via injection, via jet injector (which forces a liquid into the skin,<br>
	or underlying tissues including muscles, underpressure) or via particle bombardment, in<br>
20	 which the DNA may be coated onto particles of sufficient density to penetrate the epithelium<br>
	(US Patent No. 5371015). For example, the nucleotide sequences may be incorporated into a<br>
	plasmid which is coated on to gold beads which are then administered under high pressure<br>
	 into the epidermis, such us, for example, as described in Haynes et al j. Biotechnology 44:<br>
	37-42 (19%). Projection of these particles into the skin results in direct transfection of both<br>
25	 epidermal cells and epidermal Langerhan cells, Langerhan cells are antigen presenting cells<br>
	(APC) which take up the DNA, express the encoded peptides, and process these for display<br>
	an cell surface MHC proteins. Transfected Langedhan cells migrate to the lymph, nodes where<br>
	they present the display antigen fragments to lymphocytes, evoking an immune response.<br>
	Very small amounts of DNA (less than 1μg. often less than 0.5μg) are required to induce an<br>
30	 immune response via particle mediated delivery into ski9n and theis contrast with the<br>
	 miligram quantities of DNA known to be required to generate immune responses subsequent<br>
	to direct intramuscular injection.<br>

		Where the polynucleotide of the present invention find use as therapeutic agents, e.g<br>
	in DNA vaccination, the nucleic acid will be administered the mammal e.g. human to be<br>
	vaccinated. The nucleic acid, such as RNA or DNA, preferably DNA, is provided in the form<br>
	of a vector, such as those described above, which may be expressed in the cells of the<br>
5	 mammal. The polynucleotides may be administered by any available technique. For<br>
	example, the nucleic acid may be introduced by needle injection, preferably intradermall y,<br>
	subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Alternatively, the nucleic acid may be delivered directly<br>
	into the skin using a nucleic acid delivery such as particle mediated DNA delivery<br>
	(PMDD). In this method, men particles (such as gold beads) are coated with a nucletic acid.<br>
10	 and are accelerated at speeds sufficient to enable them to penetrate a surface of a recipient<br>
	(e.g. akin), for example by means of discharge under high pressure from a projecting device.<br>
	(Partices coated with a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention are within the scope of <br>
	the present invention, as are delivery devices loaded with such particles). The composition<br>
	desirably comprises gold particles having an average diameter of 0.5-5 μn, preferably about 2<br>
15	 μn. In preferred embodiments, the coated gold beads are loaded into tubing to serve as<br>
	cartridges such that each cartridge contains 0.1-1 mg, preferably 0.5mg gold coated with 0.1<br>
5	 μg, preferably about 0.5 μg DNA/cartridge.<br>
		According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a host cell comprising a<br>
	polynucleotide sequence as described herein. The host cell may be bactrial, e.g. E. colo.<br>
	26 mammlain, e.g. human, or may be an insect cell. Mammalian cell comprising a vector<br>
	accordiing to the present invention may be cultured cells transfected in vitro or may be<br>
	transfected in vivo by administration of the vector to the mammal.<br>
	In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of making a<br>
	parmaceutical composition as described above, including the step of altering the codon<br>
25	 usage pattern of a wild-type HC V nucleotide sequence, or creating a polynucleotide sequence<br>
	synthetically,to produce a sequence having a codon usage pattern resembling that of highly<br>

		Suitable techniques for introducing the naked polynucleotide or vector into a patient<br>
	include topical application with an appropriate vehicle. The nucleic aciti maybe administered..<br>
	topically to the skin, or to mucosal surfaces for example by intrsnasal, oral, intravaginal or<br>
	intrarectal administration, The naked polynucleotide or vector may be present together with a<br>
5	 pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, such asp hosphate buffered saline (PBS), DNA uptake<br>
	may be further facilitated by use of facilitating agents such as bupivacaine, either separately<br>
	or included in the DNA formulation. Otter methods of administering the nucleic acid directly<br>
	to a recipient include ultrasound,, electrical stimulation, electoporation and microseeding<br>
	which is described in US-5,697,901.<br>
10 		Uptake of nucleic acid constructs may be enhanced by several Known transfection<br>
	techniques, for example those including the use of transfection agents. Examples of these<br>
	 agents includes cationic agents, for example, calcium phosphate and DEAE-Dextran and<br>
	lipofectants, for examples, lipofectam and trasfectam. The dosage of the nucleic acid to be<br>
	administered can be altered. Typically the nucleic acid is administered in an amount in the<br>
15	 ra nge of lpg to lmg, preferably lpg to 10μg nucleic acid for particle mediated gene delivery<br>
	add 10μg to Img for other routes..<br>
		A nucleic acid sequence of the present invention may also be administered by means<br>
	of specialised delivery vectors useful in gene therapy. Gene therapy approaches are discussed<br>
	for example by Verme et al. Nature 1997, 389:239-242. Both viral and non-viral vector<br>
20	 systems can be used. Viral based systems include retroviral, lentiviral, adenoviral adeno-<br>
	associated viral, herpes viral, Canarypox nnd vaccinia-viral based systems. Preferred<br>
	adenoriral vectors are those derived from non-human primates. In particular Pan 9 (C68) as<br>
	 described in US patent 60K3716, Pan5, 6 or 7 as described in WO03/046:24.<br>
		Non-viral based system include direct administration of nucleic acids, microspher<br>
25	 encapsulation technology (pol(lactido-co-glycolide) and, liposome-based systems. Viral and<br>
	non-viral delivery systems may be combined where it is desirable to provide booster<br>
	injections after an initial vaccination, for example an initial "prime" DNA vaccination using a<br>
	non-virall vector such as a plasmid followed by one or more "boost" vaccinations using a viral<br>
	vector or non-viral based system. Prime boost protocols may also take advantage of priming<br>
30	 with protein in adjuvant and boosting with DNA or a viral vector encoding the polynucleotide<br>
	of the invention. Alternatively the protein based vaccine may be used as a booster. It is<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	preferred that ther protein vaccine will contain all the antigens that the DNA/viral vectored<br>
	vaccine contain. The protein however, may be presented individually or as a polyprotein.<br>
		A nucleic acid sequence of the present invention may also be administrated by means<br>
	of transforemd cells. Such cells include cells harvested from a subject. The naked<br>
5	 polynucleotide or vector of the present invention can be introduced into such cells in vitro<br>
	and the trnsformed cells can later be returned to the subject. The polynucleotide of the<br>
	invention may integrate into nucleic acid already present in a cell by homologous<br>
	recomination events. A transformd cell may, if desired, be grown up in vitro and one or<br>
	more of the resulted cell may be used in the present invention. Cells can be provided at an<br>
	appropriate site in patient by known surgical or microsurgical techniques (e.g. grafting.<br>
	micro-injection, etc.)<br>
		Suitable cells include antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells,<br>
	macrophages, B cells, monocytes and other cells that may be engineered to be efficient<br>
	APCs. Such cell may, but need not, be genetically modified to increase the capacity for<br>
15	 presenting the antigen, to improve activation and/or to be immunologically comatible with the<br>
	receiver (i. e., matched HLA haplotype). APCs my generally be isolated from any of a<br>
	variety of biological fluids anf organs, including tumour and peri-turmoural tissue, and may<br>
	be autologous, allogeneic, syngeneic or xenogeneic cells.<br>
20 		Certain preferred embodiments of the present inventin use dendritic cells or<br>
	progenitors thereof as antigen presenting cells, either for transformation in vitro and return to<br>
	the patient or as the in vivo target of nucleotide delivered in the vaccine, for example by<br>
	particle mediated DNA delivery. Dendritic cells are highly potent APCs (Bancherenu and<br>
	Steiman, Nature 392:245-251, 1998). and have been shown to be effective as a physiological<br>
25	 adujuvant for eliciting ptophylactiv or therapeuttic antitumour immunity (see Timmerman and<br>
	Levy, Ann. Rev. Med. 50:507-529, 1999). In general, dendritic cell may be identified based<br>
	on their typical shape (stallate in situ, wth marked cytoplasmic processes (denodrited) visible<br>
	in vitro), their ability to take up, process and present antigens with hgih effeciency and their<br>
	ability to achivate naive T cell response. Dendritic cell may, of course be engineered to<br>
30	 express specific cell-surface receptors or ligands that are not commonly found on dendritic<br>
	cell in vivo or ex vivo, for example the antigens(s) encoded in the constructs of the invention,<br>
	and such modified dendritic cells are contemplated by tghe present invention<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
		Dendritic cells and progenitors may be obtained from peripheral blood, bone marrow,<br>
	tumour-infiltrating cells, peritumoral tissues-infiltrating cells, lymph nodes,, spleen, skin,<br>
	umbilical cord blood or any other suitable tissue or fluid. For example, dendritic cells may be<br>
	differentiated er vivo by adding a combination of cytokines such as GM-CSF IL-4; IL-13<br>
5	 and/or TNF to cultures of monocytes harvested from peripheral blood- Alternatively, CD34<br>
	positive cells harvested from peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood or bone marrow may be<br>
	differentiated into dendritic cells by adding to the culture medium combination of GM-CSF,<br>
	CL-3, TNF, CD40 ligand, Iipopolysaccharide LPS, flt3 ligand (a cytokine important in the<br>
	generation of professional antigen presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells) and/or other<br>
10	 compound(s) that induce differentiation, maturation adn proliferation of dentritic cell.<br>
		APCs may generally be transfected with a polynucleotide encoding an antigentic HCV<br>
	 amino acid sequcnce, such as a codon-optimised polynucleotide as envisaged in the present<br>
	invention. Such transfection may then be used for therepeutic purpose, as described herein.<br>
	such transfected cells may then be used for therapeutic purposes, as described herein.<br>
15 	Alternatively, a gene delivery vehicle that targets a dendritic or other antigen presenting cell<br>
	rnay be administered to a patient, resulting in transfection that occurs in vivo In vivo and ex<br>
	vivo transfection of dendritic cells, for example, may generally be performed using any<br>
	methods known in the art, such as those described in WO97/24447, or the particle mediated<br>
	approach described by Mahvi et al., Immunology and cell Biology 75A56-46O, 1997.<br>
20	 The Vaccines and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be used in<br>
	conjunction with antiviral agents such as α-interferon, preferably PEGylated α-interferon<br>
	 and a ribavirin Vaccines and pharmaceutical compositions may be presented in unit-dose or<br>
	 multi-dose containers, such as sealed ampoules or vials. Such containers are preferably<br>
	hermetically sealed to preserve sterility of the formulation until use. In general, formulations<br>
25	 may be stored as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles,<br>
	Alternatively, a vaccine or pharmaceutical composition may be stored in a freeze-dried<br>
	condition requiring only the addition of a sterile liquid carrier immediately prior to use.<br>
	Vaccines comprising nucleotide sequences intended for administration via particle mediated<br>
	delivery may be presented as cartridges suitable for use with a compressed gas delivery<br>
30	 instrument, in which case the cartridges may consist of hollow tubes the inner surface of<br>
	which is coated with particles bearing the vaccine nucleotide sequence; optionally in the<br>
	presence- of other pharmeceutically acceptable ingredients.<br>

		The pharmaceautical compositions of the present invention may include adjuvant<br>
	compound, or other substance which may serve to modulate or increase the immune<br>
	response induced by fee protein which is encoded by the DNA. These maybe encoded by the<br>
	DNA, either separately from or as a fusion with the antigen, or may be included as non-DNA<br>
5	 elements of the formulation. Examples of adjuvant-type substances which may be included in<br>
	the formulations of the present invention include obiquitim, lysosomal associated membrane<br>
	protein (LAMP), hepatitis B virus core antigen, flt3-ligand and other cytokines such as IFN-y<br>
	and GMCSF,<br>
		Other suitable adjuvants are commercially, available such as, for example, Freund's<br>
10	 Incomplete Adjuvant and Complete Adjuvant Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI); Imiquimod<br>
	(3M, St Paul, MN); Resimiquimod (3M, St, Paul, MN); Merk Adjuvant 65 (Merck and<br>
	Company, Inc, Rahway, N1); aluminium salts such as aluminium hydroxide gel (alum) or<br>
	aluminium phosphate; salts of calcium, iron or zinc; and insolible suspension of acylated<br>
	tyrosine; acylated sugars; cationically or anionically derivatized polysaccharides:<br>
15	 polyphosphazenes; biodegradable microspheres; monophosphoryl lipid A and quil A<br>
	Cytokines, such as GM-CFS or interlenkin- 2,-7, or -12 may also be used as adjuvants.<br>
	In the formulations of the inventions it is preferred that the adjuvant composition<br>
	induces and immune response predominantly of the Th 1 type. Thus the adjuvant may server to<br>
	modulate the immunce response generated in response to the DNA encoded antigens from a<br>
20	 predominantly Th2 to a prodominantly Th1 type response. High level of the Th1-type cytokines<br>
	(e.g IFN TNF, IK-2 and IL-12) tend to favour the induction of cell mediated immune<br>
	responses to an administered antigen. Within a preferred embodiment, in which a response is<br>
	-CSF or iLberleukin-2, -1, or -12, may also be used as adjuvants.<br>

20	 predominantly Th2 to a prsdomJDantly Th 1 type response. High levels of Th 1 ^ype cytokines<br>
	(e.g.t IFN-, TIS3F, EU2 and IL-12) tend to favour the induction af cell mediated imnrune<br>
	responses to an administered antigen. Within a preferred embodiment, in which a response is<br>
	predominantly Th1-type cytokines. The levels of these cytokines may be readily assessed using<br>
25	 standard assays, For a review of the families of cytokines, sec Mosmann anf Coffiman, Ann-<br>
	Rev. Immol. 7:145-173, 1989.<br>
		According, suitable adjuvants for use in eliciting a predominantly Th1-type<br>
	response include, for example, a combination of monophosphory lipid A, preferably 3-de-O-<br>
	acylated monophosphoryl lipid A(3D-MPL) together with an aluminium salt. Other know<br>
30	 adjuvants which preferentially induce a TH1 type immune response include CpG containing<br>
	oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides are characterised in that CpG dinucleotide is<br>
	unmethylated. Such oligonucleotides are well known and are described in, for example<br><br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	WO96/02555. Immunostimulatory DNA sequences are also described, for example, by Sato<br>
	et al,, Science 273:352, 1996. CpG-containing oligonucleotides maybe encoded separately<br>
	from the HCV antigens) in the same or a different polynucleotide construct, or may be<br>
	immediately adjacent thereto, e.g. as a fusion therewith. Alternatively the CpG-containing<br>
5	 oligonucleotides may be administered separately i,e. not as part of the composition which<br>
	includes the encoded antigen. CpG oligonucleotides may be used alone or in combination<br>
	with other adjuvants. For example, an enhanced system involves the combination of a CpG~<br>
	containing oligonucleotides and a saponin derivative particularly the combination of CpG and<br>
	QS21 as disclosed in WO 00/09159 and WO 00/62800. Preferably the formulation<br>
10	 additionally comprises an oil in water emulsion and/or tocopherol.<br>
		Another preferred adjuvant is a saponin, preferably QS21 (Aquila Biopharmaceuticals<br>
	 Inc., Framingham, MA), which may be used alone or in combination with other adjuvants.<br>
	For example, an enhanced system involves the combination of a monopbosphoryl lipid A and<br>
	saporin derivative, such as the combination of QS21 and 3D-MPL as described in WO<br>
15	 34700153 or a less reactogenic composition where the QS21 is quenched with cholesterol, as<br>
	described in WO 96/33739. Other preferred formulations comprise an oil-in-water emulsion<br>
	and tocopherol. A particularly potent adjuvant formulation involving QS21, 3D-MPL and<br>
	locopherol in sm oil-in-water emulsion is described in WO 95/17210.<br>
		Other preferred adjuvants include Motjtanide ISA 720 (Seppic, France), SAF (Chiron,<br>
20	 California, United Slates), ISCOMS (CSi-), MF-59 (Chiron), Detox (Ribi, Hamilton, MT)<br>
	RC-529 (Corixa, Hamilton, MT) and other aminoalkyl glucosarminide 4-phosphates (AGPs).<br>
		Where the vaccine includes an adjuvant, the vaccine formulation may be administered<br>
	 in two parts. For example, the part of the formulation containing the nucleotide construct<br>
	which encodes the antigen may be administered first, e.g, by subcutaneous or intramuscular<br>
25	 injection, or by intradermal particle-mediated delivery, then the part of the formulation<br>
	containing the adjuvant may be administered subsequently, either immediately or after a<br>
	suitable time period which will be apparent to lite physician skilled in the vaccines arts.<br>
	Udder these circumstances the adjuvant may be administered by the same route as the<br>
	antigenic formulation or by an alternate route. In ether embodiments the adjuvant part of the<br>
30	 formulation will be administered before the antigenic part. In one emobodiment, the adjuvant<br>
	is administered as a topical formulation, applied to skin at the site of particle mediated<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	delivery of &amp;e nucleotid sequences which, encode the antigen (s), either before or after the<br>
	particle mediated driver thereof.<br>
		Preferably the DNA vaccines of the present invention stimulate an effective immune<br>
	response, typically CD4+ snd CD8+ immunity against the HCV antigens . Preferably against<br>
5	 a broad range of epitopes. It is preferred in a therapeutic setting that liver fibrosis and/or<br>
	inflammation be reduced following vaccination.<br>
		As used herein the term comprising is intended to be used in its noo-limiting sense<br>

	responses to MS3 following immunisation and &amp; single boost were demonstrated inC57B1<br>
	mice using both NS3 protein and Vacctnia 3-5 to read oat the response by ELISFOT. Both<br>
	ILa and IFNy responses were detected. No significantt differences between wild type and<br>
	codon optimised (co + m) versions of the constracts were observed in this experiment (figure<br>
20	 9). However differences in in vitro expression following transient transfection were observed<br>
	betvrean wild type and codon optimised construct. Experiments to compare constructs at<br>
	lower DNA dose of in the primary response may reveal differences in the potency of the<br>
	plasmids,<br>
25 	HCV NS4B<br>
	Responses to full length WT p7313 NS4B were observed following PMID<br>
	immunisation of BALB/c mice. Both IL2 and IFNy EL1SPOT responses were observed<br>
	following in vitro restimulatlan with either NS4E protein and Vaccinia 3-5 (figure 10).<br>
	The NS4B protein was truncated at the W-terminus to remove a highly variable<br>
30	 region, however expression of this protein could not be detected following in vitro tranfection<br>
	studies because the available anti-sera had been raised against the N-terminal region. In order<br>
	to confirm expression of this region it was fused with the NS5B protein. Recent experiments<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	have confirmed that immune responses can be detected against the truncated NS4B protein,<br>
	cither alone or as a fusion wtth NS5B, using the NS4B protein and NS3-5 vaccinia. Good<br>
	responses were observed to WT and codoo optimised NS4B,<br>
5 	HCV NSSB<br>
	The immune response to NSSB following PMID was investigated following<br>
	immunisation withWTand codon optimised (co+ M) sequence. Good responses to HS5B<br>
	following immunisation and a single boost were demonstrated in C57BL mice using both<br>
	NS3 protein and vaccinia 3-5 to read out the response by ELTSPOT. As with NS3 no<br>
10	 differences in the immune response were observed between WT and co +m versions of the<br>
	constructs in this experiment (figure 11).<br>
Example 4, Expression qf HCV polyproteins<br>

	order in the different constructs as shown below. The construct panel encoding the expression<br>
	of single polyproteins was designed so the amino -terminal position was taken by each of the<br>
	four antigens in turn, to monitor whether the level of expression was significantly improved<br>
	oneduccd more by the presence of one antigen than another in this important position. In<br>
20	 addition, two construct were generated in which the Core protein was re-arranged via 2<br>

	293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent in a standard protocol<br>
	(Invitrogen/Life Technologies). (Transfection and Western blot method as Example 4)<br>
	The results are shown, in FIG 21, Western blot analysis was, performed to detect the<br>
5	 expression of non-structural components primarily, using anti-NS3 aad anti-NS5B antisera,<br>
	and that of Core by a secondary probe of the same blot with anti-Core, in Gel A The lanes<br>
	were loaded as described in the following table:<br>
Lane	Non-Structural element 	Core element<br>
1	-	Corel 191<br>
3	NS5B	-<br>
4	NS3	Core 191<br>
5	NS3	Core 151<br>
6	NS5B	Core 191<br>
7	NS5B	Core 151<br>
		Core 191<br>
9	NS4E-NS5B	Core 151<br>
10	NS3-NS4B-US5B (HCV 510)	Core 191<br>
11	NS3-NS4B-M S5B (BC V 510c)	Core 151<br>
10 	The results indicate that in a Cis format, where the antigens are in 6 polyprotein<br>
	fusion the truncation of Core increase the expression of the fusion protein.<br>
	Comparison of effect of Core l 91 and Cora 151 on immune responses to NS3.<br>
	C57BL mice were immunised wilh l.5μg x 2 shots total DNA by PMID. The groups<br>
15	 immunised included empty vector p7313ie alone, co coasting of gold beads with p73l3ieNS3<br>
	p731l3ieNS5B ond p73I3ieCore 131 or p7313ieNS3, p73l3ieNS5B and P73l3ieCorel5l.<br>
	Co-coating was used as this should deliver all plasmids to the same cell that should mimic the<br>
	in vitro co-transfection studies described above. Immune responses to the dominant CD8 and<br>
	CD4 T cell ephopes from NS3 were determined 14 days post primary immunisstion using<br>
20	 intracellular cytokine staining to measure IFNy and IL2 antigen -specific responses. The<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2004/046175 	PCT/EP2003/012793<br>
	results (shown in FIG. 22) show that both CD4 and CDS NS3 responses were approximately<br>
	2 fold higher in the presence of Corel51 compared to Core 191.<br>
	In another experiment C57BL mice were immunised with gold beads co-coated<br>
	with plasmids expressing p7313ieNS3/NS4B/NS5B triple fusion together with either Core<br>
5	 191 or core 151, Animals were further boosted with the same constructs and responses to<br>
	NS3 were monitored 7 days post-boost, using intracellular cytokine staining to measure<br>
	responses. The results shown in FIG. 23, show that both NS3 antigen specific CD4 and CDS<br>
	responses were approximately 2 fold hi,gh in the presence of Core 151 compared to Core 191.<br>
	 Overall the in vivo studies comparing the response to NS3 in the presence of Core<br>
10	 support the in vitro expression data that co-delivery of FL core and non-structural protein can<br>
	reduce expression of the non-structural antigens and this reduces the immunogenicity of the<br>
	 constructs. This effect can at least partiarly be overcome by co-coating with truncated, core<br>
	from which the C terminal 40 amino acids have heen removed.<br>
