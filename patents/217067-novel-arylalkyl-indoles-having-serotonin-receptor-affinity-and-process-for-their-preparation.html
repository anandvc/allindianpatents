The compounds of the general fonnula (I) of this invention are 5-HT (Serotonin) ligands e.g. agonists or antagonists. The compounds of the general formula {!) of this invention, by the virtue of there chemical characteristic, could either independently or simulteneously modulate the melatonin receptor i.e. either they are melatonergic ligands e.g. agonists or antagonists, or they interact v^ith both 5-HT as vi/ell as melatonin receptor.<br>
Thus, compounds of general fomiula (1) of this invention are useful for treating diseases \Mnerein activity of either 5-HT (Serotonin) and/or melatonin is modulated to obtain the desired effect. Specifically, the compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment and / or prophylaxis of psychosis, paraphrenia, psydiotic depression, mania, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorders, anxiety, migraine headache, depression, drug addiction, convulsive disorders, personality disorders, hypertension, autism, post-traumatic stress syndrome, alcoholism, panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorders, chronobiological abnormalities, circadian rhythms, anxiolytic, osteoporosis, ischemic stroke, lower the risk of<br><br>
SIDS in young infants with low endogenous melatonin levels, reproduction, glaucoma and sleep disorders.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are also useful to treat psychotic, affective, vegetative and psychomotor symptoms of schizophrenia and the extrapyramidal motor side effects of other antipsychotic dnjgs.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are also useful to treat neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer"s disease, Parkinsonism and Huntington"s chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting. The compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are also useful in modulation of eating behavior and thus are useful in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with excess weight. Background of the Invention<br>
Many diseases of the central nervous system are influenced by the adrenergic, the dopaminergic and the serotenergic neurotransmitter systems. Serotonin has been implicated in a number of diseases and conditions, which originate in the central nervous system, tiese include diseases and conditions related to sleeping, eating, perceiving pain, controlling body temperature, controlling blood pressure depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and other bodily states. (References; Fuller, R. W., Drugs Acting on Serotonergic Neuronal Systems, Biology of Serotonergic Transmission, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, (1982), 221-247; Boullin D. J., Serotonin in Mental abnormalities (1978), 1. 316; Barchas J. et, al., Serotonin and Behavior (1973)). Serotonin also plays an important role in tfie peripheral systems, such as the gastrointestinal system, wt\ere it has been found to mediate a variety of contractile, secretory and electrophysiologic effects.<br>
Due to the broad distribution of serotonin within the body, there is lot of interest and use, in the drugs that affect serotonergic systems. Particularly, preferred are the compounds which have receptor specific agonism and/or antagonism for the treatment of a wide range of disorders, including anxiety, depression, hypertension, migraine, obesity, compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, autism, neurodegenerative disorders like Al^eimer"s disease, Parkinsonism and Huntington"s chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting (References. Gershon M. D. et. al.. The peripheral actions of 5-Hydroxytryptamine (1989), 246; Saxena P. R, et. al.. Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology (1990). supplement 7, 15).<br>
The major classes of serotonin receptors (5-HT,.7) contain fourteen to eighteen separate receptors that have been fonnally classified (References; Glennon et al, Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews (1990), 14, 35 and Hoyer D. et al, Phanmacol. Rev. (1994), 46, 157-203). Recently discovered information regarding sub-t^e identity, distribution, structure and funcyon suggests that it is possible to identify novel, sub-type specific agents having improved therapeutic profiles with lesser side effects. The S-HTe receptor was identified in 1993 (References: Monsma et al, Mol. Pharmacol. (1993), 43, 320-<br><br>
327 and Ruat M. et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. (1993), 193, 269-276), Several antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics bind to the S-HTe receptor with high affinity and this binding may be a factor in their profile of activities (References: Rofri et al, J. Pharm. Exp. Therapeut, (1994). 268, 1403-1410; Sleight et al, Exp. Opin. Ther Patents (1998), 8, 1217-1224; Bourson et al, Brit J. Pharmacol. (1998), 125, 1562-1566; Boess et al, Mol. Pharmacol., 1998, 54, 577-583; Sleight et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 124, 556-562). In addition, 5-HT6 receptor has been linked to generalized stress and anxiety states (Reference: Yoshioka et al, Life Sciences (1998), 17;i8,1473-1477). Together these studies and observations suggest that compounds that antagonize the S-HTe receptor will be useful in treating various disorders of the central nervous system.<br>
There is very strong evidence that Melatonin is important for the regulation of a variety of neural and endocrine functions, espedally those that exhibit circadian and circannual rtiythmicity. Great interest therefore lies in the possibility of making available to the clinician melatonin analogues that are metabolically more stable and have an agonist or antagonist character and of which the tiierapeutic effect may be expected to be superior to that of the homione itself. PCT patent application gives extensive literature c^ studies \Mth Melatonin and potential therapeutic application of various ligands reported till date.<br>
Those various effects are exerted via the intermediary of specific Melatonin receptors. Molecular biology studies have demonstrated the existence of a numtjer of receptor sub-types that are capable of binding that hormone (Trends Pharniacol. Sci., 1995, 16, p. 50; WO 97 04094), Melatonin acts on the CNS to affect neural mechanisms through receptors located in the brain. Additionally, a number of studies indicate the existence of direct effects of Melatonin in peripheral organs via peripheral melatonin receptors. Melatonin receptors are present in the heart, lungs, prostate gland, gonads, vjhUe blood cells, retina, pituitary, thyroid, kidney, gut and blood vessels (Withyachumnamkul et al.. Life Sci, 12 65, 1986). Three Melatonin receptor subtypes have been identified so far MT-I, MT-2 and Mel 1 c (Barrett et al., Biol. Signals Recept., 1999, 8: 6-14).<br>
There is evidence suggesting both Melatonin agonists and antagonists would be of potential therapeutic use for a variety of maladies and conditions.

For intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the active compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressurized container or a nebulizer, or from a capsule using a inhaler or insufflator. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodlfluoromethane, trichlorofluoromettiane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas and the dosage unit may be determined by pnDviding a valve to deliver a metered amount. The medicament for pressurized container or nebulizer may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound while for a capsule it preferably should be in the form of powder. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
