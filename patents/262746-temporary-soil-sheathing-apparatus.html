				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to a temporary soil sheathing apparatus,<br>
and more particularly, to a temporary soil sheathing apparatus capable of increasing<br>
ability to withstand soil pressure through structural simplification during pit excavation<br>
work for constructing an underground structure.<br>
Background Art<br>
As is generally known in the art, in subway construction or in pit excavation work<br>
for forming the basement of a building, holes are drilled to a predetermined depth in a<br>
designated area, and then vertical piles are sunk into the holes. After the vertical piles<br>
are sunk, the ground is partially excavated, and then H-beams and lining boards are<br>
installed. After installing the lining boards, the remaining ground is excavated, and<br>
bracing beams are repeatedly installed, accompanied with excavation. Therefore, in<br>
order to design this temporary structure, the soil pressure and the load acting on each<br>
bracing beam must be repeatedly calculated, once for each excavation step, and the<br>
bracing beams are installed so as to be able to withstand the maximum soil pressure<br>
and load determined thus.<br>
This design and construction requires many bracing beams. In most cases, the<br>
bracing beams are densely arranged at intervals between 2 m and 3 m. The dense<br>
bracing beams serve as main obstacles that impede the transport of construction<br>
materials, the entry and operation of heavy equipment, etc. in the excavated pit, and<br>
interfere considerably with form work or reinforcement work when the main structure<br>
is subsequently formed. Further, the dense bracing beams inevitably require that a<br>
plurality of holes be formed in the main structure, so that they cause a serious problem<br>
with respect to the waterproofing of the finished underground structure.<br>
The vertical piles are set up according to various methods, such as a method of<br>
using H-beams of steel, a method of using concrete piles in which holes are drilled and<br>
filled with concrete, a method of using H-beams together with concrete piles, and a<br>
method of using sheet piles. These methods make little difference with respect to the<br>
basic principle of drilling holes into the ground, forming piles into a wall, and<br>
supporting the load of the ground.<br>
Further, there are other methods: a method of using preflex beams as the vertical<br>
piles, and a method of attaching sheet piles to H-piles to increase rigidity.<br>
Meanwhile, among the temporary methods for constructing the underground<br>
structure, there is a method of supporting steel piles using earth anchors that does not<br><br>
require the above-described bracing beams.<br>
This method involves drilling a hole at an incline into the ground at the rear of the<br>
pile, inserting a steel wire or rod into the hole, anchoring an end of the inserted steel<br>
wire or rod using a mechanical method or a chemical method, such as epoxy grouting<br>
or cement grouting, and tensioning the anchored steel wire or rod to fix the steel piles.<br>
This temporary method has an advantage in that the problem in that it is difficult to<br>
conduct work is mitigated because the constructed structure secures sufficient internal<br>
space.<br>
However, this temporary is widely criticized by the public when implemented in a<br>
developed urban area because the surrounding private land is encroached upon in most<br>
cases, and furthermore, the method costs a great deal.<br>
A method of removing bracing beams crossing an excavated pit from a temporary<br>
structure using a truss is disclosed in Korean Utility Model Registration No.<br>
20-258949. This method is expected to be able to be applied in the case in which the<br>
ground is excavated to a relatively low depth, wherein H-beams are doubly formed<br>
near the surface of land in a lattice shape and are reinforced by vertical beams and<br>
raker beams. Thereby, the two-tier truss near the surface of land is made able to<br>
withstand the soil pressure.<br>
This method was devised to overcome difficulty in excavation and installation of<br>
the main structure due to the bracing beams of the temporary structure, and is regarded<br>
as a convenient method in the situation where a wide structure is to be formed in a<br>
lower portion of the excavated ground and a narrow structure is to be formed in an<br>
upper portion of the excavated ground.<br>
Typically, the bracing beams are primarily used in pit excavation work. During<br>
such work, when viewed from the top, the moment is maximized at the central portion<br>
in the rectangular area by means of the soil pressure, so that the central portion must<br>
have greater bearing capacity than other portions.<br>
Therefore, the central portion requires a lot of central bracing beams. This becomes<br>
a factor that increases construction costs and makes the structure complicated.<br>
Thereby, the work space is narrowed, thus reducing productivity.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made in an effort to solve the problems<br>
occurring in the related art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
temporary soil sheathing apparatus, in which a set of intermediate bracing beams<br>
having a preloading jack in the middle thereof and a triangular supporting structure at<br>
opposite ends thereof is installed at an intermediate excavated portion during pit<br><br>
excavation work for constructing an underground structure, thereby increasing the<br>
capacity to bear soil pressure through structural simplification.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a temporary soil sheathing<br>
apparatus, in which a corner connecting structure is applied to each corner of an<br>
excavated portion during pit excavation work for constructing an underground<br>
structure, thereby increasing ability to withstand soil pressure through structural sim-<br>
plification.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a temporary soil sheathing<br>
apparatus, in which bracing beams are interconnected at each corner of an excavated<br>
portion during pit excavation work for constructing an underground structure, thereby<br>
forming the bracing beams, to which soil pressure is transmitted, into a truss structure<br>
such that the bracing beams behave like one member.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
In order to achieve the above objects, according to one aspect of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a temporary soil sheathing apparatus, which includes: a set<br>
of intermediate bracing beams are is installed across an intermediate portion excavated<br>
in a rectangular area during underground pit excavation work, and wales that are<br>
integrally connected with opposite ends of the intermediate bracing beam set. Here, the<br>
intermediate bracing beam set is provided with a preloading jack at the middle thereof,<br>
and is connected with raker beams via first and second connectors on left and right<br>
sides of each end thereof, such that the opposite ends thereof form a triangular<br>
supporting structure.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a temporary<br>
soil sheathing apparatus, which includes a braced wall that is installed parallel to an<br>
excavated portion during underground pit excavation work, a set of bracing beams that<br>
are coupled to the braced wall at each corner in the pit excavation work and support<br>
soil pressure, and a corner connector having a cross beam that is coupled to each wale,<br>
a compression beam that is obliquely connected to one end of the cross beam and is<br>
integrally connected to one end of the bracing beam set, and a raker beam that connects<br>
one end of the compression beam and another end of the cross beam.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
temporary soil sheathing apparatus, which includes bracing beams that are disposed in<br>
rows at predetermined intervals so as to support each corner during underground pit<br>
excavation work, and at least one connecting plate that is integrally coupled to any one<br>
of upper and lower surfaces of each bracing beam by a coupling means so as to in-<br>
terconnect the bracing beams.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br><br>
According to a first embodiment of the present invention, the temporary soil<br>
sheathing apparatus is adapted to simplify the connecting structure of the intermediate<br>
bracing beam set and reinforce the ability to withstand the soil pressure transmitted<br>
from the braced wall and the wales during rectangular pit excavation work for con-<br>
structing an underground structure. Thus, the temporary soil sheathing apparatus has a<br>
triangular supporting structure that supports the intermediate bracing beam set in the<br>
pit excavation work for constructing an underground structure, so that it can satis-<br>
factorily support soil pressure. Thus, it is possible to prevent space from being reduced<br>
by a complicated supporting structure, reduce construction costs through reduced use<br>
of materials, and increase work space to thus improve productivity.<br>
Further, the opposite ends of the intermediate bracing beam set are supported in a<br>
triangular supporting structure. Hence, the braced wall to which the soil pressure is<br>
actually transmitted can be supported by a wider supporting area compared to existing<br>
structures for connecting the intermediate bracing beams, so that it is possible to simul-<br>
taneously apply an amount of compressive force corresponding to the soil pressure and<br>
increase bearing capacity.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the present invention, the temporary soil<br>
sheathing apparatus is adapted to simplify the connecting structure in each corner and<br>
reinforce the ability to withstand the soil pressure transmitted from the braced wall and<br>
the wales during pit excavation work for constructing an underground structure.<br>
Thereby, the temporary soil sheathing apparatus can satisfactorily support the soil<br>
pressure transmitted to each corner using a simple corner connecting structure during<br>
pit excavation work for constructing an underground structure, so that it is possible to<br>
prevent space from being reduced by a complicated supporting structure, reduce con-<br>
struction costs through reduced use of materials, and increase work space to thus<br>
improve productivity.<br>
According to a third embodiment of the present invention, the temporary soil<br>
sheathing apparatus is adapted to interconnect the bracing beams disposed in rows at<br>
each corner during pit excavation work for constructing an underground structure. The<br>
temporary soil sheathing apparatus integrates the rows of bracing beams at each corner<br>
in a truss structure, so that it can uniformly transmit a horizontal load, and thus obtain<br>
sufficient durability against a flexural load.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in greater detail to exemplary embodiments of the<br>
invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
[Embodiment 1]<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 through 4, a temporary soil sheathing apparatus according to a<br>
first embodiment of the present invention includes wales 20 that are integrally coupled<br>
to a braced wall (not shown), installed parallel to a vertically excavated portion in a<br>
rectangular area during pit excavation work, and that support soil pressure, a set of in-<br>
termediate bracing beams 100 that traverse long sides of the braced wall and that<br>
support the soil pressure transmitted from the braced wall, raker beams 200 that<br>
obliquely support the intermediate bracing beam set 100 and the corresponding wale<br>
20 at opposite ends thereof so as to be connected with the intermediate bracing beam<br>
set 100 and the corresponding wale 20 in a triangular structure.<br>
More specifically, the intermediate bracing beam set 100 comprises a plurality<br>
thereof, and has a structure in which each intermediate bracing beam is connected so as<br>
to be integrally coupled to the wales 20 at opposite ends thereof, and is provided with a<br>
preloading jack 150 at the middle thereof, thereby having varying ability to withstand<br>
the soil pressure.<br>
Each wale 20 may employ a single-layer wale or a multi-layer wale depending on<br><br>
the footprint of the excavated ground, and is preferably pre-stressed so as to match (the<br>
moment of) the soil pressure.<br>
Each raker beam 200 is installed obliquely with respect to the intermediate bracing<br>
beam 100 and the corresponding wale 20, thereby forming a triangular structure. The<br>
raker beam 200 is integrally connected to the intermediate bracing beam set 100 and<br>
the corresponding wale 20, respectively, through first and second connectors 310 and<br>
320 at opposite ends thereof. The first and second connectors 310 and 320 have an ap-<br>
proximately triangular shape so that they can support the opposite ends of each raker<br>
beam 200.<br>
The first connector 310 is interposed between the intermediate bracing beam set<br>
100 and the raker beam 200, and includes a vertical beam 312 that is connected to the<br>
intermediate bracing beam set 100, and first and second supporting beams 314 and 316<br>
that are obliquely connected to opposite ends of one side of the vertical beam 312 so as<br>
to have a triangular shape.<br>
Further, the second connector 320 is interposed between the raker beam 200 and the<br>
corresponding wale 20, and includes a cross beam 322 that is parallel to and in surface<br>
contact with the wale 20, and first and second connecting beams 324 and 326 that are<br>
obliquely connected to opposite ends of one side of the cross beam 322 and integrally<br>
coupled to the other end of the raker beam 200 so as to have a triangular shape.<br>
The cross beam 322 of the second connector 320 is bolted on one side of the wale<br>
20, and the first and second connecting beams 324 and 326 serve to distribute and<br>
support the load transmitted from the raker beam 200.<br>
Preferably, the beams of the first and second connectors 310 and 320 each employ a<br>
typical H-beam having a web and flanges. At least one first stiffener 310a is welded to<br>
the web of the H-beam for the first connector 310, and at least one second stiffener<br>
320a is welded to the web of the H-beam for the second connector 320.<br>
Each of the first and second stiffeners 310a and 320a is preferably provided so as to<br>
support compressive force at a portion where another member is coupled or force is<br>
transmitted.<br>
Further, the cross beam 322 and the vertical beam 312 have end plates welded at<br>
opposite ends thereof in order to be connected with the corresponding wale 20 and the<br>
intermediate bracing beam set 100, respectively.<br>
Also, the first and second connectors 310 and 320 have first and second reinforcing<br>
plates 310b and 320b interposed between the vertical beam 312 and the first supporting<br>
beam 314 and between the cross beam 322 and the first connecting beam 324, re-<br>
spectively. Thus, the first and second connectors 310 and 320 are in surface contact<br>
with two sides of each of the first and second reinforcing plates 310b and 320b, so that<br>
they can increase the ability to withstand compressive force.<br><br>
The wale 20 is preferably provided with a shear key 322a at the position where the<br>
compressive force is transmitted. The shear key 322a is connected by high-tensile<br>
bolts, and is in contact with one flange of the cross beam 322.<br>
Because the compressive force transmitted to the wale 20 and the force transmitted<br>
from the raker beam 200 act in opposite directions, the shear key 322a serves to use the<br>
opposing forces to offset each other.<br>
The operation of the temporary soil sheathing apparatus, having this construction,<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention, will be described below.<br>
The temporary soil sheathing apparatus according to a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention is adapted to support soil pressure on an intermediate portion which<br>
is transmitted through the braced wall by installing the raker beams 200 for connection<br>
with the wales 20 so as to have a triangular supporting structure at opposite ends of the<br>
intermediate bracing beam set 100.<br>
At this time, the preloading jack 150 installed at the intermediate portion, preferably<br>
at the center, of the intermediate bracing beam set 100 transmits a load in opposite<br>
directions. Thereby, the opposite ends of the intermediate bracing beam set 100 apply<br>
pressure to the opposite wales 20, and thus transmit compressive bearing force cor-<br>
responding to the soil pressure to the opposite wales 20.<br>
Further, the compressive force transmitted from the opposite wales 20 is distributed<br>
and supported through the raker beam 200 installed on the opposite ends of the in-<br>
termediate bracing beam set 100 to form a triangular shape, so that stable bearing<br>
capacity can be obtained.<br>
The pressure transmitted through each wale 20 is transmitted to the end plates of<br>
each cross beam 322, which is in surface contact with a stopper of a corresponding<br>
wale 20. In the case in which each cross beam 322 is in contact with the shear key<br>
322a, the compressive force transmitted from each wale 20 acts to oppose the pressure<br>
transmitted to the cross beam 322 through the intermediate bracing beam set 100. As a<br>
result, these forces can be offset and counteracted by each other, and simultaneously<br>
the bearing capacity can be provided by high-tensile bolts.<br>
Further, the raker beams 200 are connected to the intermediate bracing beam set<br>
100 and the opposite wales 20 to form a triangular supporting structure, so that the<br>
compressive forces from the opposite wales can be distributed and supported in a more<br>
stable way.<br>
Further, the first and second stiffeners 310a and 320a are welded to the webs of the<br>
first and second connectors employing H-beams, respectively, so that they can increase<br>
rigidity and ability to withstand compressive force. Further, the first and second<br>
connectors 310 and 320 are provided with the first and second reinforcing plates 310b<br>
and 320b, respectively, so that they can make up for the ability to withstand the<br><br>
compressive force transmitted from the raker beams 200.<br>
[Embodiment 2]<br>
The temporary soil sheathing apparatus according to a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention further includes a corner connecting structure employing the<br>
triangular supporting structure employed in the temporary soil sheathing apparatus<br>
according to the first embodiment of the present invention. In this case, the temporary<br>
soil sheathing apparatus can increase the efficiency of use of space and the ability to<br>
withstand soil pressure through structural simplification.<br>
The temporary soil sheathing apparatus according to a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention further includes a corner connecting structure employing the above-<br>
described triangular supporting structure. Referring to FIGS. 5 through 8, the<br>
temporary soil sheathing apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes a braced wall 510 that is installed parallel to a vertically excavated<br>
portion during pit excavation work, wales 520 and bracing beam sets 550 that are<br>
integrally coupled to the braced wall 510 and support soil pressure, and corner<br>
connectors 600 that are provided at corners formed by the braced wall 510 and support<br>
the soil pressure transmitted from the braced wall 510.<br>
More specifically, each bracing beam set 550 may be replaced by a strut, and each<br>
wale 520 can be pre-stressed so as to match the moment of the soil pressure. Further,<br>
each wale 520 may employ a single-layer wale or a multi-layer wale in consideration<br>
of the footprint and the depth of the excavated ground.<br>
Each corner connector 600 includes a cross beam 610, a compression beam 620,<br>
and a raker beam 630, all of which form a stable structure when pressure is transmitted<br>
thereto, i.e. a triangular structure. Here, the cross beam 610 is integrally coupled with<br>
the corresponding wale 520. The compression beam 620 is connected to one end of the<br>
cross beam 610 and one end of each bracing beam set 550. The raker beam 630<br>
connects the cross beam 610 and the compression beam 620.<br>
The cross beam 610 is fixed to one side of the corresponding wale 520 by means of<br>
bolts. The compression beam 620 is connected with each bracing beam set 550 on one<br>
side thereof, and transmits the load of the soil pressure, which is transmitted from each<br>
bracing beam set 550, to other members. The raker beam 630 serves to distribute and<br>
support the load transmitted from the compression beam 620.<br>
Each of the cross beam 610, the compression beam 620, and the raker beam 630<br>
preferably employs a well-known H-beam, to the web of which at least one stiffener<br>
650 is welded.<br>
The stiffener 650 is preferably provided to portions where the members are coupled<br>
or where the force is transmitted so as to support compressive force.<br>
Further, the cross beam 610 has end plates 614 welded to opposite ends thereof in<br><br>
order to be connected with the corresponding wale 520.<br>
Also, a reinforcing plate 810 is interposed between the cross beam 610 and the<br>
compression beam 620. The reinforcing plate 810 is in surface contact with the cross<br>
beam 610 and the compression beam 620 on two sides thereof, so that it can increase<br>
the ability to withstand compressive force.<br>
The reference number "602", which has not yet been described, refers to a drain<br>
hole for preventing rainwater from collecting in each beam.<br>
As in FIG. 4, each wale 520 is preferably provided with a shear key 615 at a<br>
position where the compressive force is transmitted. The shear key 615 is connected by<br>
high-tensile bolts, and is in contact with the other side of the cross beam 610.<br>
Because the compressive force transmitted to the wale 520 and the force transmitted<br>
from the compression beam 620 act in opposite directions, the shear key 615 serves to<br>
use the opposing forces to offset each other.<br>
Although not illustrated, a preloading jack having a cylinder is provided at an in-<br>
termediate portion of each bracing beam set 550. Preferably, each bracing beam set<br>
550 is provided with corresponding corner connectors 600 having a triangular structure<br>
at opposite ends thereof, thereby transmitting compressive force corresponding to the<br>
soil pressure from the preloading jack to the compression beams 620 of the cor-<br>
responding corner connectors 600.<br>
The operation of the temporary soil sheathing apparatus, having this construction,<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described below.<br>
The temporary soil sheathing apparatus according to a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention is adapted to support soil pressure, transmitted through the braced<br>
wall 510, through the corner connectors 600, installed between the bracing beam sets<br>
550 and the wales 520 at the corners defined by the braced wall 510.<br>
At this time, the soil pressure on the braced wall 510 is supported by the<br>
compressive force transmitted from the bracing beam sets 550 and by the transverse<br>
pressure transmitted from the wales 520 at the corners. The compression beam 620 of<br>
each corner connector 600 distributes and transmits the pressure, which is transmitted<br>
from each bracing beam set 550, to the cross beam 610 and the raker beam 630. As a<br>
result, the temporary soil sheathing apparatus can have increased load carrying<br>
capacity using a simple structure.<br>
The pressure transmitted through each wale 520 is transmitted to the end plates of<br>
each cross beam 610, which is in surface contact with the corresponding wale 520. In<br>
the case in which each cross beam 610 is in contact with the shear key 615, the<br>
compressive force transmitted from each wale 520 acts against the pressure transmitted<br>
to each cross beam 610 through each bracing beam set 550. As a result, these forces<br>
can be offset and counteracted by each other, and the bearing capacity can be provided<br><br>
using high-tensile bolts.<br>
Further, the stiffener 650 is welded to the web of each corner connector 600<br>
employing the H-beam, so that it can increase rigidity and the ability to withstand the<br>
compressive force. Further, the reinforcing plate is interposed between the cross beam<br>
610 and the compression beam 620, so that it can increase the ability to withstand the<br>
compressive force transmitted from each bracing beam set 550.<br>
[Embodiment 3]<br>
The temporary soil sheathing apparatus according to a third embodiment of the<br>
present invention further includes a corner connecting structure which is adapted to<br>
uniformly transmit horizontal load to thus obtain sufficient ability to withstand a<br>
flexural load using bracing beams, disposed in rows at each corner and integrated in a<br>
truss structure when pit excavation work for constructing an underground structure is<br>
performed.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 9 through 13, the temporary soil sheathing apparatus according<br>
to a third embodiment of the present invention includes bracing beams 1100 that are<br>
obliquely disposed in rows at each corner when pit excavation work for constructing<br>
an underground structure is performed, and that are supported on a braced wall 1010 at<br>
opposite ends thereof, and at least one connecting plate 1200 that interconnects upper<br>
or lower surfaces of the neighboring bracing beams 1100 using a coupling means.<br>
More specifically, the connecting plate 1200 has a rectangular shape, and is<br>
provided with at least one stiffener 1210 that is oriented in a longitudinal direction in<br>
order to resist vertical flexural deformation.<br>
The stiffener 1210 is integrally formed at one edge of the connecting plate 1200, or<br>
is integrated with the connecting plate 1200 through welding. The stiffener 1210 has<br>
the shape of a strip or an L-shaped angle. Although not illustrated, the connecting plate<br>
1200 may employ an H-beam.<br>
FIG. 13 is a front view illustrating a modification of FIG. 12. The connecting plates<br>
1200 are coupled to upper and lower surfaces of each bracing beam 110, respectively.<br>
According to the circumstances of a particular site, a plurality of connecting plates<br>
1200 is preferably used in a stacked arrangement. If necessary, the stiffener 1210 can<br>
be omitted.<br>
The connecting plates 1200 cause the rows of bracing beams 1100 to be disposed in<br>
parallel in a truss structure, and function to uniformly transmit the load without leaning<br>
to one side.<br>
Each bracing beam 1100 is connected with wales 1020, which are integrally<br>
coupled to the braced wall 1010, at opposite ends thereof. Alternatively, each bracing<br>
beam 1100 is connected with the wales 1020 at opposite ends thereof by means of<br>
separate structures.<br><br>
The coupling means functions to integrate the connecting plate 1200 and the<br>
bracing beams 1100 by means of welding or well-known fastening members using, for<br>
instance, bolts 1310 and nuts 1320. When using the fastening members, each bracing<br>
beam 1100 and the connecting plate 1200 are provided with a lot of through-holes<br>
1102 and 1202 for fastening the bolts 1310, respectively. The bolts 1310 pass through<br>
the through-holes 1102 and 1202, and then are fastened by the nuts 1320.<br>
The reference number "1150", which has not yet been described, indicates a bearing<br>
beam that bears the bracing beams 1100 in a transverse direction. At least one bearing<br>
beam 1150 is integrally fastened to the lower surface of each bracing beam 1100 by<br>
means of the bolts 1310, thereby serving to prevent the bracing beams 1100 from being<br>
bent upwards and/or downwards by the load.<br>
The operation of the temporary soil sheathing apparatus, having this construction,<br>
according to a third embodiment of the present invention will be described below.<br>
The temporary soil sheathing apparatus according to a third embodiment of the<br>
present invention is adapted to interconnect the plurality of rows of bracing beams<br>
1100, which are disposed in parallel at each corner when pit excavation work for con-<br>
structing an underground structure is performed, using the connecting plates 1200<br>
having a rectangular shape, so that the bracing beams 1100 spaced apart from each<br>
other are connected into one structure, thereby behaving in a unified way with respect<br>
to a load transmitted from each end thereof. Thus, the load is uniformly transmitted to<br>
each bracing beam 1100, and the bracing beams 1100 are prevented from deviating or<br>
flexing.<br>
At this time, the connecting plates 1200 are in surface contact with the upper and/or<br>
lower surface of each bracing beam 1100, and the through-holes 1102 and 1202 are<br>
aligned in a vertical direction. Then, the bolts 1310 pass through the through-holes<br>
1102 and 1202, and are fastened by the nuts 1320. Thereby, the assembly of the<br>
temporary soil sheathing apparatus is completed.<br>
When the assembly is completed, the bracing beams 1100 have a truss structure at<br>
each corner, defined by the braced wall. Therefore, the bracing beams 1100 react to a<br>
transmitted load in an integrated manner, and thereby have sufficient resistance to<br>
horizontal flexural load.<br>
Further, the stiffener 1210 protruding outwards from one surface of each connecting<br>
plate 1200 is welded to each connecting plate 1200, so that the bracing beams 1100 can<br>
resist upward flexure while the load of each bracing beam 1100 is transmitted.<br>
Meanwhile, when the underground structure is sufficiently stable to prevent the<br>
ground from collapsing, the temporary soil sheathing apparatus is disassembled and<br>
reused. At this time, the connecting plates 1200 are separated from each bracing beam<br>
1100 by unfastening the bolts 1310 and the nuts 1320.<br><br>
The connecting plates 1200 can vary in size depending on the interval between the<br>
rows of bracing beams 1100. Therefore, each connecting plate 1200 is not required to<br>
have a fixed size.<br><br>
