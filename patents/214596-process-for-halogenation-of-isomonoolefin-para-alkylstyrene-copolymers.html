				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention,<br>
The invention relates to an improved process for halogenating copoiymers of a C4 to C? isomonoolefin and a para-alkvlsryreneHalogenation process in which a polymer is reacted with a halofjcnating agent to produce a halogenated polymer containing chemically bound halogen are well known in the art. For example, halogenated copoiymers comprising a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin, e.g., isobutylene, and from about 0,5 to 10 wt% of a conjugated dime, e.g., isoprene (commercially known as butyl rubber), may be readily prepared using relatively facile ionic reactions by contacting the polymer, preferably dissolved in organic solvent, with a halogen source, e.g.. molecular bromine or chlorine, and heating the mixture at a temperature ranging from about 20°C to 90°C for a period of time sufficient for the addition of free halogen in the reaction mixture onto the polymer backbone. Such processes are generally disclosed in US Patent 2,7.12,354<br>
A major inefficiency in such process is that the theoretical fraction of ralogen present in the reaction mixture which can be placed on the polymer is 50X and the actual utilization is usually less than 45%. Most of the remaining halogen fraction will combine with hydrogen extracted from the polymer to form a hydrogen halide by¬product which, under normal conditions, does not halogenate the polymer This by¬product is subsequently neutralized with an alkaline material and ivashed from the polymer reaction product as described, for example, in US Patent 5,077,345.<br>
One known method to enhance the efficiency of butyl rubber ionic halogenatkm involves the inclusion in the reaction media of at least 0.5 mole per mole of halogenating agent of an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide, which oxidizes the<br><br>
hydrogen halide by-product as it forms back to ionic halogen. This regenerated halogen is thus available to further halogenate the butyl rubber thereby increasing the halogenation utilization by as much as 70% Such process is disclosed in US Patent 3,018,275 and in UK Patent 867,737.<br>
Another process for improving the brominadon efficiency in rul^ber bromination processes is to conduct the reaction in the presence of elemental bromine and an aqueous solution of an organic azo compound such as azodiisobutronitrile and/or an alkali or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite, as disclosed in EP 0709401 Al.<br>
A new class of halogenated copolymers have been discovered which offer many of the same properties as halogenated butyl rubber, but are even more ozone and solvent resistant. These materials are the halogenation product of random co polymers of from about 10 to 99.5 wt% of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin, such as isobutylenis, and from about 0.5 to 90 wt% of a para-alkylstyrene comonomer such that at least some of the alkyl substituent groups present in the styrene monomer units contain halogen.<br>
More preferred materials are elastomeric copolymers of isobutylene and para-methylstyrenc containing from about 0.5 to about 20 wt% para-mcthylstyrcnc wherein up to about 65% of the methyl substhuent groups present on the benzsne ring contain a bromine or chlorine atom, preferably a bromine atom. These copclymers (hereafter referred to as HI-PAS) have a substantially homogenous compositional distribution such that at least 95% by weight of the polymer has a para-alkylstyrene content within 10% of the average para-alkystyrene content of the polymer, They are also characterized by a very narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of less than about 5, more preferably less than about 2.5, viscosity average molecular weights in the range of from about 500,000 up to about 2,000,000, and a glass transition temperature (Tg) of below about 50°C. Halogenated copolymers of this type are disclosed in US Patent 5,162,445, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated henein by reference<br><br>
As described in the '445 patent, HI-PAS copolymers contain no ethylenic backbone unsaturation as does butyl rubber, and therefore halogenation is carried out under free radical halogenation conditions using light as an initiator or using an organic free radical initiator. Halogenation occurs essentially exclusively on the alkyl substituent groups and, in the case of para-methylstyrene, benzylic halide functionality is formed.<br>
However, even under such free radical halogenation conditions, the halogen utilization in the process is typically only about 45% or less.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a process for halogenating a copolymer of a C4 to C7isomonoloolefin and a para-alkylstyrene comprising contacting said copolymer with a halogenating agent and an oxidizing agent in the presence of a free radical initiator at a temperature of 0°C to 150°C, for a period of time of 1 minute to 4 hours, and recovering the halogenated copolymer containing at least 0.05 mole % of haloalkyl groups.The invention provides a process for halogenating a copolymer of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and a para-alkylstyrene comprising contacting said copolymer under free radical halogenation conditions with a halogenating agent and hydrogen peroxide, and recovering said halogenated copolymer containing at least about 0.05 mole% of haloalkyl groups.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a process is provided for halogenating a copolymer of a C4to C7 isomonoolefin and a para-alkyl styrene comprising:<br>
a)	contacting said copolymer with a halogenating agent and an organic<br>
free radical initiator under free radical halogenation conditions to form a reaction<br>
product mixture containing a partially halogenated copolymer and in-siru generated<br>
hydrogen halide;<br>
b)	contacting said reaction product mixture from step (a) with an<br>
oxidizing agent capable of converting said hydrogen halide to free halogen; and<br>
c)	continuing said halogenation until a halogenated copolymer containing<br>
at least about 0.05 mole % of haloalkyl groups is obtained.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, a multi stage process for brominating a copolymer of C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and a para-alkystyrene is provided comprising:<br>
a)        forming a solution of said copolymer in organic solvent in a first reactor zone;<br>

brominated copolymer containing at least about 0.05 raole% of bromoalkyl groups is<br>
obtained.<br>
DFTATLETD DESCRIPTlON OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ai pointed out above-, the coporymers which provide the halogaiation substrate in accordance with this invention are random copolymers containing from about 10 to 99.5 wt% of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and correspondingly about 0.5 to 90 wt% of a copolymerized para-alkylstyrene having the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed) in which R and R1 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkvl, primary alkyl hftiides, secondaryalkyl halide^ aidmbeturesthisreof Preferably R and R1 are hydrogen, Ci to C$ alkyl, or Ci to Cj primary or secondary alley! and most preferably R and R1 are hydrogen.<br>
The more preferred copolymers are copolymers of isobutylene and aara-methylstyrene and the most preferred copolymers are elastomeric copoiymers concaming from about<br>
0.5 to about 20 wt% para-methytsjyrene. These copolymers and their method of preparation are disclosed in the above mentioned US Patent 5,162,445. For convenience, these copolymers are hereafter referred to as "I-PAS cqtolymers"<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery that the utilization of lalogen, even in a free radical halogenation process as required in the halogenation of 1- PAS copolymers, can be substantially increased by carrying out the reaction in the presence of an oxidizing agent which is added to the reaction medium either at the onset of the halogenation reaction or, more preferably, in a second stage after the polymer has been partially halogenated. The invention is particularly applicable to free radical halogenation conducted using an organic free-radical initiator such as a bis-azo compound and wherein the oxidizing agent is added to the reaction media in a second stage only after a substantial portion of the halogen source e.g., molecular bromine, has been consumed in a first reaction stage. This sequential addition of the organic free radical initiator and halogen source in a first stage and oxidizing agent in a second stage has been found to minimize unwanted reactions between the or^^nic free radical initiator and the oxidizing agent and to maximize halogen utilization in such processes.<br>
Halogenating agents which may be used as a source of halogen in accordance with the invention include molecular bromine (Br5) or chlorine, bromine chloride, iodine bromide and mixtures thereof. Where the free radical halogenation is conducted with the oxidizing agent present at the onset of the halogenation reaction, tydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride may be used as the halogen source. The preferred halogen source is molecular bromine.<br>
Since a considerable portion of the hydrogen halide. e.g., hydrogen bromide, generated in-situ as a halogenation process by-product is oxidized to regenerate useful halogen, smaller amounts of halogenating agent are initially required to achieve a given degree of polymer halogenation than would be the case where the reaction is conducted without the use of oxidizing agent. As a general rule, the amount of halogenating agent present in the reaction media may vary between about 0.1 to 25 php (parts by weight per 100<br>
parts by weight polymer), more preferably from about 0.2 to 10 php and most preferably from about 0.2 to 6 php.<br>
Any of the known free radical initiators can be used in the process. Free radical initiators which are preferred in accordance with the invention include any source of tight, e.g., actinic white light or, where the reaction is conducted in the absence of light, one or more organic free radical initiators. Preferred initiators are those which have a naif lift of between about 0.5 and 2500 minutes under the desired reaction conditions, and more preferably a half life of about 10 to 300 minutes. The amount of chemical initiator employed may vary between about 0.02 to about 1 par: by weight php, preferably between about 0.02 and 0.4 parts by weight php. The most preferred chemical initiators are az-obis compounds including azobisisobuty- ronhrile, 2,2-azobis (2,4,4 trimethyl pentane nitrile), azobis (2-methyl butyro) nitrile and azobis (2,4 dimethyl valero) nitrile. Other radical initiators such as organic peroxides can also be used provided they are relatively poor at hydrogen abstraction so that they react preferentially with the molecular halogen molecules to form halogen atoms rather than with the I-PAS copohymer or any solvent present in the reaction mixiiure to form alkyl radicals or crosslinked structures.<br>
The oxidizing agents which have been found suitable for the purposes of the present invention are water soluble materials which contain oxygen. Preferred agents are peroxides and peroxide forming substances as exemplified by the following substances: hydrogen peroxide, sodium chlorate, sodium bromate, sodium hypochlorite or bromite, oxygen, oxides of nitrogen, ozone, urea peroxtdate, acids such as pertitanic, perzirconic, perchromic, permolybdic, pertungstic, perunanic, perboric, perphosphoric, perpyrophosphoric, persulfktes. perchloric, perchlorate and periodic acids. Of the foregoing, hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen peroxide-forming compounds, e.g, per-acids and sodium peroxide, have been found to be most suitable for carrying out the present reaction.<br>
The amount of oxidizing agent used in accordance with the invention depends on the amount and kind of halogenating agent used. Generally from about 0.1 to about 3 mols of oxidizing agent per mole of halogenating agent may be used. The preferred amount of oxidizing agent present in the reaction mixture ranges from aboui: 1 to 2 mols per mol of halogenating agent.<br>
The oxidizing agent may be introduced into the reaction zone as .1 solution in any suitable diluent such as carbon tetrachloride, lower alcohol, ether or water. More preferably, the oxidizing agent is introduced as an aqueous solution, or water-in-oil emulsion. When introduced as an aqueous solution, the solution may contaain about 10-85 wt% of the oxidizing agent; when introduced as an emulsion, the emulsion may contain about 1-50 wt% of the oxidizing agent.<br>
The halogenation reaction may be carried out in bulk or in solution, but is preferably conducted by first dissolving the I-PAS copolymer in a suitable organic solvent such as a C4 to C10 aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic liquid. Preferred solvents include normal hexane, cyclonexane, normal pentane, normal heptane and benzene. Halogen-containing solvents such as chlorobenzene, carbon tetrachloride and chloroform may also be used. The polymer solution, which may contain from as little as 1 wt% polymer or as much as 40 wt% polymer, is introduced into a reaction zone thai: is provided with suitable means to permit intimate contact with the reactants. The temperature of the polymer solution is adjusted to that which is most convenient for carrying out the reaction in view of the various properties of the reactants and the volatility of the solvent. To insure a fairly rapid reaction it is advisable to employ a reaction temperature above 0°C. e.g., at least 5°C, and it is preferred to maintain the temperature between about 20°C and 80°C. However, under certain conditions, especially where less reactive materials are employed, it may be desirable to run the reaction at temperatures ranging up to t SOT or higherWhere the oxidizing agent is introduced into the reaction zone at the onset of the halogenation reaction, it may be added prior to, concurrently with or subsequent to the<br>
addition of the halogenating agent and chemical free radical initiator, where present. More preferably, however, the oxidizing agent is not added to the reaction mixture until after at least about 50 wt%, more preferably about 75 to 100 wt% of the halogenating agent has been consumed in the halogenation reaction. Halogen consumption is indicated, where molecular bromine is used as the halogenating agent, by a change in color of the reaction mixture from reddish brown to a light tan or amber color. Halogen consumption can also be calculated stoichiornetricalry as a imction of reaction speed under reaction conditions.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the halogenation may be carried out in two or more separate reaction zones. In this process, the halogenation reaoion is carried out as described above in a first reactor zone to form a reaction product mixture comprising a partially halogenated qopolymer and in-situ generated hydrogen lialide by-product. This reaction is also carried out until at least 50 wt°/o, more preferably at least 75 to 100 wt% of the added halogen source is consumed. Thereafter, the reaction mixture is transferred to a second reactor zone where it is contacted under mixing conditions with the oxidizing agent. The hydrogen halide generated in-situ in the first reactor zone is regenerated into free halogen by the oxidizing agent in the second raictor zone, which free halogen is then available for further halogenation of the copolyner in the second reactor zone. The oxidizing agent may be added incrementally or all at once in said second reactor zone or may be added or metered in a mixing zone positioned between the first and second reactor zone.<br>
After completion of the halogenation reaction, the polymer may be recovered by conventional techniques, e.g., neutralization with dilute caustic, waiter washing and removal of solvent such as by steam stripping techniques or by precipitation using a lower alcohol such as isopropanol, followed by drying.<br>
IT* halogenation of the I-PAS copolymer is generally conducted for a period of time of from about 1 minute up to about 3 of 4 hours, depending on reaction conditions until a halogenated copolymer containing at least about 0.05 mol% of haloalkyl groups is<br>
achieved. In the more preferred embodiment and where the I-PAS copolymer contains para-metnylstyrene and the halogenating agent is bromine, the reason is conducted until the polymer contains from about 0.1 to about 10 mol% of benzylic bromine (bromomethyl groups), more preferably from about 0.1 to about 2 mol% of benzylic bromine. Halogenated copolymcrs produced in accordance with this invention will generally contain less than about 0.003 mol% of dibromo methyl groups, even at a high degree of bromination.<br>
The following examples are illustrative of the invention. The I-PAS .jopolymer used in the examples is a random elastomeric copolymer of isobutylene and 7.5 wt% of para-methyistyrene (PMS) having a Mboney Viscosity of 45 (1 + 8 at 125°C).<br>
Example 1<br>
In this example, light initiated bromination of the copolymer was conducted under three separate conditions, i.e., (a) without the addition of oxidizing agent; (b) oxidizing agent added concurrently with Br3 and (c) oxidizing agent added only after the substantial depletion of the Br*<br>
a)	109.5 grams of I-PAS elastomer were dissolved in 620.5 grams of<br>
cyclohexane in a baffled glass flask equipped with a dropping funnel to form a 15 wrVa<br>
solution. The flask was equipped with a 150 watt tungsten light bulb mounted next to<br>
the flask and a turbine mixer. Next, a 3 wt% Br2 charge (based on polymer weight)<br>
was added dropewise to the flask maintained at about 20°C while exposed to light<br>
radiation. The bromination reaction was terminated (neutralized by NaOH) after the<br>
reddish brown Br2 color in the reaction mixture had faded to a light tan color. The<br>
resulting neutralized cement was washed in water until neutral and the brominated<br>
polymer was precipitated in isopropanol and dried in a vacuum.<br>
b)	Part (a) was repeated except that 4.9 grams of emulsified 35%<br>
hydrogen peroxide in hexane (about a 2:1 peroxide to halogen mole i-atio) was added<br>
to the reaction mixture concurrently with the addition of Br2,<br>
c)	Part (a) was repeated except that 4.39 grams of the emulsified<br>
hydrogen peroxide were added to the reaction mixture after the reddish brown Br2<br>
10<br>
color in the reaction mixture had faded to a light tan color. The reaction was continued for 7 minutes prior to neutmlizatioa<br>
The samples of brominated polymers were submitted for NMR analysis and results are shown in Table 1.<br>
TABLE 1<br>
REGENERATIVE BROMINAT10N (LIGHT INITIATION)<br><br>
(Tabe Removed)Bromine Charge: 3 wt% or 2.12 mole% based on polymer.<br>
Table 1 shows the results of light initiated bromination of I-PAS cement with and without H2O2 addition. The data dearly indicate that the addition of H2O2 significantly improved the bromine utilization as reflected by the 80% increase of BrPMS content on polymer. The sequence of HA addition (either added simultaneously with Br2 or after most Br2 was consumed) has little impact on bromine utilization. Thhi suggests that the Br radical does not react/interfere with the bromine regeneration function of H2O2 in a light initiated process.<br>
The data also indicate that the amount of undesirable Br2PMS was extremely small (0.02 mole%) even at 45% PMS conversion (or 1.56 mole% BrPMS on polymer). This suggests that the reduced cement acidity during the Regenerciive Bromination may retard the formation of Br2PMS. Therefore a higher BrPMS content can be<br>
achieved via this process without a significant amount of Br2PMS foimation relative to convention bromination processes.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In this example, the bromination reaction is initiated using a bis azo chemical initiator 2,2'-azobis(2,4,4 trimethyl pentane nhrile), referred to as VAZOI-52 and using sequence of addition of oxidizing agent as in Example 1.<br>
.f<br>
a) 76.2 grains of I-PAS elastomer were' dissolved in 431.8 grams of cydohexane in a baffled glass flask equipped with a dropping funnel 1:0 form a 15 wt% solution. Next, a 0.2 wt%VAZO-52 charge (based on polymer weight) was added to the reactor flask and the contents were gently heated to 50°C at atmospheric pressure. Thereafter, a 3wt% Br2 charge (based on polymer weight) was added dropwise to the flask maintained at 50°C. After bromine addition was complete, the reaction was continued at 50"C for 10 minutes, after which the halogenated polymer was neutralized and recovered as in Example 1.<br>
(b)	Part (a) was repeated except that 3.2 grams of emulsified 35%<br>
hydrogen peroxide aqueous emulsion in hexane (about a 2:1 peroxido to halogen mole<br>
ratio) was added to the reaction media concurrently with the addition of Br2<br>
(c)	Part (a) was repeated except that 3.2 grams of the emulsified hydrogen<br>
peroxide were added to the reaction mixture after the reddish brown Br2 color in the<br>
reaction mixture had faded to a light tan color.   After the peroxide addition, the<br>
reaction was continued for an additional 50 minutes prior to neutralization.<br>
12<br>
NMR analysis of these brominated polymers showed results as indicated in Table 2.<br>
TABLE 2<br>
REGENERATIVE BROMIN ATION (VAZO INITIATION)<br><br>
(Table Removed)Bromine Charge: 3 wt% or 2. 12 mole% based on polymer.<br>
The data in Table 2 indicate that when H2O2 was added into the cement simultaneously with Br2, the reddish color of Br2 stayed significantly longer than the control and the bromine utilization was only about 20% higher than the control. It suggests that the VAZO radicals can react/interfere with H2O2 and a significant amount of the H2O2 might have been destroyed by VAZO radicals before it could react with HBr and regenerate the Br2.<br>
However, when H2O2 was added after most of the Br2 was consumed (based on cement color), the BrPMS on polymer and the bromine utilization were increased by about 80% from the control run under similar conditions. It is most lkely that, after the initial Br2 charge was consumed, the VAZO radical concentration was reduced (according to the half-life of VAZO at 50°C) and the HBr concentration in cement was the highest so that the fast reaction between HjO? and HBr became predominant.<br>
The data show that the Regenerative Bromination process can be used in processes by including the addition of H2O2 between two reactors. In such a scenario, a reduced Br2<br>
charge can be added and consumed in the first reactor and then the H2O2 can be added between the first and second reactors Onto a high shear in-line mbcer) to convert all HBr back to Br2 before it reaches the second reactor Assuming proper temperature in the second bromination reactor, most of the regenerated Br2 would be consumed and thus significantly less caustic is needed to neutralize the residual Br2 and/or HBr in the second reactor.<br><br><br>
