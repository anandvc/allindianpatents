COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR PREPARING SUBSTITUTED N-PHENYL 2-HYDROXY-2-METHYL-3,3,3-TRIFLUOROPROPANAMIDE DERIVATIVES"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company, of S-151 85 Sodertalje, SWEDEN,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a substituted n-phenyl 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3,3,3-trifluoropropanamide derivatives which elevate pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds which elevate pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them-as active ingredient, methods for the treatment of disease states associated with reduced PDH activity, to their use as medicaments and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the elevation of PDH activity in warm-blooded animals such as humans, in particular the treatment of diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease and myocardial.ischaemia in warm-blooded animals such as humans- more particularly to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in warm-blooded animals such as humans.<br>
Within tissues adenosine triphosphate (ATP) provides the energy for synthesis of complex molecules and, in muscle, for contraction. ATP is generated from the breakdown of energy-rich substrates such as glucose or long chain free fatty acids. In oxidative tissues such as muscle the majority of the ATP is generated from acetyl CoA which enters the citric acid cycle, thus the supply of acetyl CoA is a critical determinant of ATP production in oxidative tissues. Acetyl CoA is produced either by p-oxidation of fatty acids or as a result of glucose metabolism by the glycolytic pathway. The key regulatory enzyme in controlling the rate of acetyl CoA formation from glucose is PDH which catalyses the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA and carbon dioxide with concomitant reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH.<br>
In disease states such as both non-insulin dependent (NIDDM) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), oxidation of lipids increased with a concomitant reduction in utilisation of glucose, which contributes to the hyperglycaemia. Reduced glucose utilisation in both IDDM and NEDDM is associated with a reduction in PDH activity. In addition, a further consequence of reduced PDH activity may be that an increase in pyruvate concentration results in increased availability of lactate as a. substrate for hepatic gioceneogenesis. It is reasonable to expect that increasing the activity of PDH could increase the rate of glucose oxidation and hence overall glucose utilisation, in addition to reducing hepatic glucose output. Another factor contributing to diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion, which has been shown to be associated with reduced PDH activity in pancreatic β-cells (in a rodent genetic model of diabetes mellitus Zhou et al.(1996)  Diabetes 45: 580-586).<br><br>
Oxidation of glucose is capable of yielding more molecules of ATP per mole of oxygen than is oxidation of fatty acids. In conditions where energy demand may exceed energy supply, such as myocardial ischaemia, intermittent claudication, cerebral ischaemia and reperfusion, (Zaidan et al., 1998; J. Neurochem. 70: 233-241), shifting the balance of substrate utilisation in favour of glucose metabolism by elevating PDH activity may be expected to improve the ability to maintain ATP levels and hence function.<br>
An agent which is capable of elevating PDH activity may also be expected to be of benefit in treating conditions where an excess of circulating lactic acid is manifest such as in certain cases of sepsis.<br>
The agent dichloroacetic acid (DCA) which increases the activity of PDH after acute administration in animals, (Vary et al., 1988; Circ. Shock, 24: 3-18), has been shown to have the predicted effects in reducing glycaemia, (Stacpoole et al., 1978; N. Engl. J. Med. 298: 526-530), and as a therapy for myocardial ischaemia (Bersin and Stacpoole 1997; American Heart Journal, 134: 841-855) and lactic acidaemia, (Stacpoole et al., 1983; N. Engl. J. Med. 309: 390-396).<br>
PDH is an intramitochondrial multienzyme complex consisting of multiple copies of several subunits including three enzyme activities El, E2 and E3, required for the completion of the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA (Patel and Roche 1990; FASEB J., 4: 3224-3233). El catalyses the non-reversible removal of CO2 from pyruvate; E2 forms acetyl CoA and E3 reduces NAD to NADH. Two additional enzyme activities are associated with the complex: a. specific kinase which is capable of phosphory rating El at three serine residues and a loosely-associated specific phosphatase which reverses the phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of a single one of the three serine.residues rehder-st-he ETinactive. The proportion of the PDH in its active (dephosphorylated) state is determined by a balance between the activity of the kinase and phosphatase. The activity of the kinase may be regulated in vivo by the relative concentrations of metabolic substrates such as NAD/NADH, CoA/acetylCoA and adenine diphosphate (ADP)/ATP as well as by the availability of pyruvate itself.<br>
European Patent Publication Nos. 617010 and 524781 describes compounds which are capable of relaxing bladder smooth muscle and which may be used in the treatment of urge incontinence. We have found that the compounds of the present invention are very good at elevating PDH activity, a property nowhere disclosed in EP 0617010 and EP 524781.<br>
The present invention is based on-the surprising discovery that certain compounds elevate PDH activity, a property of value in the treatment of disease states associated with<br><br>
disorders of glucose utilisation such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, (Curto et al., 1997; Int. J. Obes. 21: 1137-1142), and lactic acidaemia. Additionally the"compounds may be expected to have utility in diseases where supply of energy-rich substrates to tissues is limiting such as peripheral vascular disease, (including intermittent claudication), cardiac failure and certain cardiac myopathies, muscle weakness, hyperlipidaemias and atherosclerosis (Stacpoole et al., 1978; N. Engl. J. Med. 298: 526-530). A compound that activates PDH may also be useful in treating Alzheimer"s disease (AD) (J Neural Transm (1998) 105, 855-870).<br>

If the resolved acid of formula (V) is required it may be prepared by any of the known methods for preparation of optically-active forms (for example, by recrystallization of the chiral salt {for example WO 9738124}, by enzymatic resolution or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase). For example if an (R)-(+) resolved acid is required it may be prepared by the method of Scheme 2 in World Patent Application Publication No.   WO 9738124 for preparation of the (S)-(-) acid, i.e. using the classical resolution method described in European Patent Application Publication No. EP 0524781, also for preparation of the (S)-(-) acid, except that (1S,2R)-norephedrine may be used in place of (S)-(-)-l-phehylethylarnine.

If not commercially available, the necessary starting materials for the procedures such as that described above may be made by procedures which are selected from standard organic chemical techniques, techniques which are analogous to the synthesis of known, structurally similar compounds, or techniques which are analogous to the above described procedure or the procedures described in the examples.<br>
For example, it will be appreciated that certain of the optional aromatic substituents in the compounds of the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications or interconversions either prior to or immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are<br><br>
included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acylhalide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogeno group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group by, for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with heating; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl using, for example, hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid with heating or 3-chloroperbenzoic acid. Particular examples of functional group interconversions are for example conversion of an aniline into a halophenyl by, for example, diazotization in the presence of cupurous halides.<br>
It is noted that many of the starting materials for synthetic methods as described above are commercially available and/or widely reported in the scientific literature, or could be made from commercially available compounds using adaptations of processes reported in the scientific literature.<br>
It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl -group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl-group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or r-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such<br><br>
as a r-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid such as, for example hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or TFA and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine. A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, of an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a t-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as TFA, or for example a.-benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.<br>
In cases where compounds of formula (I) are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable acid or basic salts, administration of the compound as a salt may be appropriate, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be made by conventional methods such as those described.following. Examples of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts axe organic acid addition salts formed with acids which form a physiologically acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulphonate, acetate, tartrate, citrate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, a-ketoglutarate, and α-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed such as sulphate, nitrate, and hydrochloride.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well<br><br>
 nown in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound of formula (I) (or its<br><br>
 ester) with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. It is also possible with most compounds of the invention to make a corresponding alkali metal (e.g. sodium, potassium, or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (e.g. calcium) salt by treating a compound of formula (I) (and in some cases the ester) with one equivalent of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or alkoxide (e.g. the ethoxide or methoxide) in aqueous medium followed by conventional purification techniques.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) may be administered in the form of a prodrug which is broken down in the human or animal body to give a compound of the formula (I). Examples of prodrugs include in vivo hydrolysable esters of a compound of the formula (I).<br>
An in vivo hydrolysable ester of a compound of the formula (I) containing carboxy or hydroxy group is, for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable ester which is hydrolysed in the human or animal body to produce the parent acid or alcohol.<br>
Suitable in vivo hydrolysable esters for a compound of the formula (I) containing a carboxy group include Ci-6alkoxymethyl esters for example methoxymethyl, C1-6alkanoyloxymethyl esters for example pivaloyloxymethyl, phthalidyl esters, C3-8 cycloalkoxycarbonyloxyC1-6alkyl esters for example 1-cyclohexylcarbonyloxyethyl; l,3-dioxolen-2-onylmethyl esters for example 5-rnethyl-l,3-dioxolen-2-onylmethyl; and Ci-6alkoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters for example 1 -methoxycarbonyloxyethyl and may be formed at any carboxy group in the compounds of this invention.<br>
Suitable in vivo hydrolysable esters of a compound of the formula (I) containing a hydroxy group includes inorganic esters such as phosphate esters and α-acyloxyalkyl ethers. Examples of α-acyloxyalkyl ethers include acetoxymethoxy and<br>
2,2-dimethylpropionyloxymethoxy. Other in vivo hydrolysable ester forming groups for hydroxy include alkanoyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl and substituted benzoyl and phenylacetyl, alkoxycarbonyl (to give alkyl carbonate esters), dialkylcarbamoyl and N-(dialkylaminoethyl)-N-alkylcarbamoyl (to give carbamates), diaikyiaminoaeetyl and carboxyacetyl. Examples of substituents for benzoyl include morpholino and piperazino linked from a ring nitrogen atom via a methylene group to the 3- or 4- position of the benzoyl ring.<br>
In vivo cleavable prodrugs of compounds of formula (I) also include in vivo hydrolysable amides of compounds of the formula (I) containing a carboxy group, for<br><br>
example, a N-C1-6 alkyl or N-di-C1-6alkyl amide such as N-methyl, N-ethyl, N-propyl, N-dimethyl, N-ethyl-N-methyl or N-diethyl amide.<br>
The identification of compounds which elevate PDH activity is the subject of the present invention. These properties may be assessed, for example, using one or more of the procedures set out below: (a) In vitro elevation of PDH activity<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to elevate PDH activity. cDNA encoding PDH kinase may be obtained by Polymerase Chain Reaction (VCR) and subsequent cloning. This may be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with PDH kinase activity. For. example rat PDHkinaseII (rPDHKII) obtained by expression of recombinant protein in Escherichia coli (E. Coli), was found to display PDH kinase activity.<br>
In the case of the rPDHKTJ (Genbank accession number U10357) a 1.3kb fragment encoding the protein was isolated by PCR from rat liver cDNA and cloned into a vector (for example pQE32 - Quiagen Ltd.). The recombinant construct was transformed into E. coli (for example M15pRep4 - Quiagen Ltd.). Recombinant clones were identified, plasmid DNA was isolated and subjected to DNA sequence analysis. One clone which had the expected nucleic acid sequence was selected for the expression work. Details of the methods for the assembly of recombinant DNA molecules and the expression of recombinant proteins in bacterial systems can be found in standard texts for example Sambrook et al, 1989, Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press. Other known PDH kinases for use in assays, may be cloned and expressed in a similar manner.            For expression of rPDHKII activity, E coli strain M15pRep4 cells were transformed with the pQE32 vector containing rPDHKH cDNA. This vector incorporates a 6-His tag onto the protein at its N-terminus. E. coli were grown to an optical density of 0.6 (600 nM) and protein expression was induced by the addition of 10 μM isopropylthio-β-galactosidase. Cells were grown for 18 hours at 18°C and harvested by centrifugation. The resuspended cell paste was lysed by homogenisation and insoluble material removed by centrifugation at 24000xg for 1 hour. The 6-His tagged protein was removed from the supernatant using a nickel chelating nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Ni-NTA: Quiagen Ltd.) matrix (Quiagen) which was washed with 20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)arninomethane-hydrogen chloride, 20 mM imidazole, 0.5 M sodium chloride pH 8.0, prior to elution of bound protein using a buffer containing 20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-hydrogen chloride, 200 mM imidazole, 0.15 M sodium<br><br>
chloride pH 8.0. Eluted fractions containing 6-His protein were pooled and stored in aliquots at-80°C in 10% glycerol.<br>
Each new batch of stock enzyme was titrated in the assay to determine a concentration  giving approximately 90% inhibition of PDH in the conditions of the assay. For a typical batch, stock enzyme was diluted to 7.5(μg/ml.<br>
Forassay of the activity of novel compounds, compounds were diluted with 10% DMSO and 10μl transferred to individual wells of 96-well assay plates. Control wells contained 20μl 10% DMSO instead of compound. 40μl Buffer containing 50mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, l0mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N-tetracetic acid (EGTA), ImM benzamidine, ImM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.3mM tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), 2mM dithiothreitol (DTT), recombinant rPDHKII and compounds were incubated in the presence of PDH kinase at room temperature for 45 minutes. In order to determine the maximum rate of the PDH reaction" a second series of control wells were included containing 10% DMSO instead of compound and omitting rPDHKII PDH kinase activity was then initiated by the addition of 5 μM ATP, 2 mM magnesium chloride and 0.04 U/ml.PDH (porcine heart PDH Sigma P7032) in a total volume of 50 μl and plates incubated at ambient temperature for a further 45 minutes. The residual activity of the PDH was then determined by the addition of substrates (2.5mM coenzyme A, 2.5mM thiamine pyrophosphate (cocarboxylase), 2.5mM sodium pyruvate, 6mM NAD in a total volume of 80μl and the plates incubated for 90 minutes at ambient temperature. The production of reduced NAD (NADH) was established by measured optical density at 340nm using a plate reading spectrophotometer. The ED50 for a test compound was determined in the usual way using results from 12 concentrations of the compound. (b) In vitro elevation of PDH activity in isolated primary cells<br>
This assay determines the ability of compounds to stimulate pyruvate oxidation in primary rat hepatocytes.   <br>
Hepatocytes were isolated by the two-step collagenase digestion procedure described by Seglen (Methods Cell Biol. (1976) 13, 29-33) and plated out in 6-well culture plates (Falcon Primaria) at 600000 viable cells per well in Dulbecco"s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM, Gibco BRL) containing 10% foetal calf serum (FCS), 10% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco BRL) and 10% non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Gibco BRL). After 4 hours incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2, the medium was replaced with Minimum Essential Medium	<br><br>
(MEM, Gibco BRL) containing NEAA and penicillin/streptomycin as above in addition to lOnM dexamethasone and 10nM insulin.<br>
The following day cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and medium replaced with 1ml HEPES-buffered Krebs solution (25mM HEPES, 0.15M sodium chloride, 25 mM sodium hydrogen carbonate, 5mM potassium chloride, 2mM calcium chloride, 1mM magnesium sulphate, 1 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate) containing the compound to be tested at the required, concentration in 0.1% DMSO. Control wells contained 0.1% DMSO only and a maximum response was determined using a 10 μM treatment of a known-active compound. After a preincubation period of 40 minutes at 37°C in 5% C02, cells were pulsed with sodium pyruvate to a final concentration of 0.5mM (containing 1-14C sodium pyruvate (Amersham product CFA85) 0.18Ci/mmole) for 12 minutes. The medium was then removed and transferred to a tube which was immediately sealed with a bung containing a suspended centre well. Absorbent within the centre well was saturated with 50% phenylethylamine, and CO2 in the medium released by the addition of 0.2μl 60% (w/v) perchloric acid (PCA). Released 14CO2 trapped in the absorbent was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The ED50 for a test compound was determined in the usual way using results from 7 concentrations of the compound. (c) In vivo elevation of PDH activity<br>
The capacity of compounds to increase the activity of PDH in relevant tissues of rats may be measured using the test described hereinafter. Typically an increase in the proportion of PDH in its active, nonphosphorylated form may be detected in muscle, heart, liver and adipose tissue after a single administration of an active compound. This may be expected to lead to a decrease in blood ghicose after repeated administration of the compound. For example a single administration of DCA, a compound known to activate PDH by inhibition of PDH kinase (Whitehouse, Cooper and Randle (1974) Biochem. J. 141, 761-774) 150 mg/kg, ntraperitoneally, increased the proportion of PDH in its active form (Vary et al. (1988) Circ. Shock 24, 3-18) and after repeated administration resulted in a significant decrease in plasma glucose (Evans and Stacpoole (1982) Biochem Pharmacol.31, 1295-1300).<br>
Groups of rats (weight range 140-180g) are treated with a single dose or multiple loses of the compound of interest by oral gavage in an appropriate vehicle. A control group of ats is treated with vehicle-only. At a fixed time after the final administration of compound, animals areterrrrinally anaesthetised, tissues are removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For<br><br>
determination of PDH activity, muscle samples are disrupted under liquid nitrogen prior to Vhomogenisation by one thirty-second burst in a Polytron homogenizer in 4 volumes of a buffer containing 40 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.0, 5 mM EDTA, 2mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 10mM sodium pyruvate, 10μM phenylmethylsulphonyl chloride (PMSF) and 2μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstain A and aprotinin. Extracts are centrifuged before assay. A portion of the extract is treated with PDH phosphatase prepared from pig hearts by the method of Siess and Wieland (Eur. J. Biochem (1972) 26, 96): 20 μl extract, 40 μl phosphatase (1:20 dilution), in a final volume of 125 μl containing 25 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride. The activity of the untreated sample is compared with the activity of the dephosphorylated extract thus prepared. PDH activity is assayed by the method of Stansbie et al., (Biochem. J. (1976) 154, 225) 50 μl Extract is incubated with 0.75 mM NAD, 0.2 mM CoA, 1.5 mM thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and 1.5mM sodium pyruvate in the presence of 20 μg/ml p-(p-amino-phenylazo) benzene sulphonic acid (AABS) and 50 mU/ml arylamine transferase (AAT) in a buffer containing 100 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 0:5 mM EDTA, 50mM sodium fluoride, 5mM 2-mercaptoethanol and ImM magnesium chloride pH 7.8. AAT is prepared from pigeon livers by the method of Tabor et al. (J. Biol. Chem. (1953) 204, 127). The rate of acetyl CoA formation is determined by the rate of reduction of AABS which is indicated by a decrease in optical density at 460 nm.<br>
Liver samples are prepared by an essentially similar method, except that sodium pyruvate is excluded from the extraction buffer and added to the phosphatase incubation to a final concentration of 5mM.<br>
Treatment of an animal with an active compound results in an increase in the activity of PDH complex in tissues. This is indicated by an increase in the amount of active PDH (determined by the activity of untreated extract as a percentage of the total PDH activity in the same extract after treatment with phosphatase).<br>
