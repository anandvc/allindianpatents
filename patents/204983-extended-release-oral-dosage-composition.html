STABLE EXTENDED RELEASE ORAL DOSAGE COMPOSITION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a film-coated extended release solid oral dosage composition containing a nasal decongestant, e.g., pseudoephedrine in a controlled release core and a film outer coating containing the nonsedating antihistamine, desloratadine. The solid oral dosage compositions of this invention are useful for treating patients showing the signs and symptoms associated with allergic and/or inflammatory conditions such as the common cold, as well as signs and symptoms associated with allergic and/or inflammatory conditions of the skin or upper and lower airway passages such as allergic rhinitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis and nasal congestion, upper respiratory diseases, allergic rhinitis and nasal congestion.<br>
Desloratadine, also called descarbethoxyloratadine, is disclosed in US Patent No. 4,659,716 as a non-sedating antihistamine useful as an anti-allergy agent. US Patent No. 6,100,274 discloses compositions containing desloratadine. US Patent No. 5,595,997 discloses methods and compositions for treating seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms using desloratadine. Desloratadine, upon oral absorption, is hydroxylated at the 3 position to produce the metabolite, 3-hydroxyldesloratadine.<br>
U. S. Patent Nos. 4,990,535 and 5,100,675 disclose a twice-a-day sustained release coated tablet wherein the tablet coating comprises descarbethoxyloratadine and a hydrophilic polymer and polyethylene glycol, and the tablet core comprises acetaminophen, pseudoephedrine or a salt thereof, a swellable hydrophilic polymer and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br><br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,314,697 discloses an extended release tablet containing matrix core comprising pseudoephedrine sulfate and a coating comprising loratadine.<br>
None of the prior art discloses the once-a-day film-coated solid oral dosage composition of this invention.<br>
The successful development of a formulation of a desloratadine-pseudoephedrine once-a-day product would be desirable, but would require achieving a release rate profile for pseudoephedrine component over an extended period in excess of twelve hours and preferably at least _16 hours while maintaining delivery of an effective once a day dose of desloratadine.<br>
It would be desirable for increased patient compliance to have an extended release desloratadine-pseudoephedrine product effective and safe when used on a once-a-day basis for the treatment, management and/or mitigation of the signs and symptoms associated with the common cold, as well as allergic and/or inflammatory conditions of the skin or upper and lower airway passages such as seasonal, allergic rhinitis and nasal congestion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have discovered a desloratadine-pseudoephedrine once-a-day product which produces a release rate profile for pseudoephedrine over an extended period in excess of twelve hours and preferably at least 16 hours while maintaining delivery of an effective once a day dose of desloratadine.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides film-coated extended release solid oral dosage composition comprising (a) a core comprising an effective amount of pseudoephedrine or pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt thereof, and (b) a film coating uniformly covering the core and comprising an effective amount of desloratadine wherein the amount of pseudoephedrine or pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt thereof is effective to produce a geometric maximum plasma<br><br>
concentration of pseudoephedrine of about 345 ng/mL to about 365 ng/mL at a time of about 7.60 hrs to about 8.40 hrs and the amount of desloratadine is effective to produce a geometric maximum plasma concentration of desloratadine of about 2.10 ng/mL to about 2.45 ng/mL at a time of about 4.0 hours to about 4.5 hours after administration of a single dose of said composition.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the film-coated extended release solid oral dosage composition of the present invention also produce a geometric maximum plasma concentration of 3-hydroxydesloratadine of about 0.75 ng/mL to about 1.15 ng/mL at a time of about 5.50 hours to about 6.25 hours after administration of a single dose of said composition.<br>
More preferred embodiments of the film-coated extended release solid oral dosage composition of the present invention also produce a geometric maximum plasma concentration of desloratadine of about 2.10 ng/mL to about 2.45 ng/mL at a time of about 4.0 hours to about 4.5 hours and a geometric maximum plasma concentration of 3-hydroxydesloratadine of about 0.75 ng/mL to about 1.15 ng/mL at a time of about 5.50 hours to about 6.25 hours after administration of a single dose of said composition.<br>
Thus, in a preferred embodiment, this invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising therapeutically effective amount of pseudoephedrine sulfate in a core and an effective amount of desloratadine in a film coating maintaining the desirable pharmacokinetic parameters of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine listed herein above and containing less than about 2 % of desloratadine decomposition products such as N-formyldesloratadine, preferably less than about 1.4% to about 1.6 % of the desloratadine decomposition products such as N-formyldesloratadine, initially, as well as when such compositions are stored at 25°C and about 60% relative humidity for periods of at least about 24 months.<br>
We have also discovered that by placing a first coating between film-coating comprising desloratadine and the core comprising a nasal<br><br>
decongestant, e.g., pseudoephedrine salt, preferably pseudoephedrine sulfate, provides release of desloratadine from the second film-coating and extended release of the nasal decongestant pseudoephedrine sulfate from the core, preferably a matrix core, over a period in excess of twelve hours while maintaining the desirable pharmacokinetic parameters of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine listed herein above and producing less than 2 % degradation of the desloratadine to N-formyldesloratadine.<br>

Similar results would be expected if a decongestant effective amount of another pharmaceutically acceptable pseudoephedrine salt, e.g., pseudoephedrine hydrogen chloride was used in place of pseudoephedrine sulfate.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are useful for treatment of allergic and/or inflammatory conditions of the skin (e.g. urticaria) and the upper and lower airway passages including the nasal and non-nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis including nasal congestion in patients in need of such treating.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
During the course of development of the compositions of the present invention, desloratadine was found to be unstable and to discolor when stored in combination with various excipients such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,314,697 as part of the matrix core containing pseudoephedrine sulfate. The excipients causing discoloration and instability of desloratadine include acidic excipients having a pH of less than 7 in water such as organic acids, such as stearic acid, povidone, crospovidone and carbonyl-containing materials such as lactose, and ethyl cellulose and hydroxylpropyl methylcellulose. Binders like povidone and polymers such as hydroxypropymethylcellulose are useful as a polymer matrix for the sustained release of the pseudoephedrine sulfate from the inner polymer matrix core.<br>
We discovered that by uniformly covering the inner core matrix containing a nasal decongestant, e.g.,pseudoephedrine sulfate and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose and povidone with a first coating comprising a water-swellable film-forming neutral or cationic copolymeric ester, a film modifier and lubricant, the desloratadine could safely be coated onto the first coating. The desloratadine was found to have an acceptable immediate release profile from the<br><br>
second coating (80% release in 0.1 N HCI in less than about 45 min.) and contain less than about 2% of N-formyldesloratadine, preferably aboutr 1.4% to about 1.6 % of N-formyldesloratadine even after storage for at least 24 months - preferably up to 36 months at 25° C and about 60% relative humidity ("RH").<br>
When a third film coating comprising a water swellable film-forming neutral or cationic co-polymeric ester and polyethylene glycol as a film modifier was placed on top of the second coating, the dissolution rate of desloratadine from the second coating and pseudoephedrine from the core decreased to unacceptably low levels.<br>
Suprisingly, addition of a low viscosity hydroxyipropyl methylcellulose to the third coating as a film-modifier, restored the dissolution rates of both active ingredients (pseudoephedrine sulfate and desloratadine) to levels approximately the same as those obtained when a core matrix was uniformly covered with two film coatings.<br>
The phrase "allergic and inflammatory conditions of the skin and airway passages" is meant those allergic and inflammatory conditions and symptoms found on the skin and in the upper and lower airway passages from the nose to the lungs. Typical allergic and inflammatory conditions of the skin and upper and lower airway passages include seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis, asthma including allergic and non-allergic asthma, sinusitis, colds (in combination with a NSAID, e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen) and/or a decongestant e.g. pseudoephedrine), dermatitis, especially allergic and atopic dermatitis, and urticaria and symptomatic dermographism as well as retinophathy, and small verssel diseases, associated with dTabetes mellitus.<br>
The amount of desloratadine effective for treating or preventing allergic and inflammatory conditions of the skin and upper and lower airway passages will vary with the age, sex, body weight and severity of the allergic and inflammatory condition of the patient. Typically, the amount of desloratadine<br><br>
effective for treating or preventing such allergic and inflammatory conditions is in the range of about 2.5 mg/day to about 60 mg/day, preferably about 2.5 mg/day to about 20 mg/day, or about 4.0 mg/day to about 15 mg/day, or about 5.0 mg/day to about 10 mg/day, more preferably about 5.0 mg/day to about 10.0 mg/day, and most preferably about 5.0 mg/day to about 6.0mg/day in a single dose.<br>
Desloratadine is a non-sedating long acting histamine antagonist with potent selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist activity. Following oral administration, loratadine is rapidly metabolized to descarboethoxyloratadie or desloratadine, a pharmacologically active metabolite. In vitro and in vivo animal pharmacology studies have been conducted to assess various pharmacodynamic effects of desloratadine and loratadine. In assessing antihistamine activity in mice (comparison of ED50 value), desloratadine was relatively free of producing alterations in behavior alterations in behavior, neurologic or autonomic function. The potential for desloratadine or loratadine to occupy brain HI-receptors was assessed in guinea pigs following i.p. administration and results suggest poor access to central histamine receptors for desloratadine or loratadine.<br>
In addition to antihistaminic activity, desloratadine has demonstrated anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory activity from numerous in vitro and in vivo    ■ tests. These in vitro tests (mainly conducted on ceils of human origin) have shown that desloratadine can inhibit many events in the cascade of allergic inflammation. These anti-inflammatory effects for desloratadine are independent of the Hi-antagonist effect of desloratadine and include:<br><br>
The release of inflammatory mediators histamine, truptase, leukotriene and<br>
prostaglandin D2 from mast cells;<br>
The release of inflammatory cytokines including IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13;<br>
The release of the inflammatory chemokines such as RANTES (regulated upon<br>
activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted);<br>
Superoxide anion production of polymorphonuclear neutrophils;<br>
The expression of cell adhesion molecules such as intracellular adhesion<br>
molecules (ICAM-1) and P-selectin in endothelial cells; and<br>
Eosinophil migration and adhesion<br>
In vivo studies also suggest that an inhibitory effect of desloratadine on allergic<br>
bronchospasm and cough can also be expected.<br>
The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine has been documented in over 3,200 seasonal allergic rhinitis patients in 4 double-blind, randomized clinical trials The results of these chemical studies demonstrated the efficacy of desloratadine in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal rhinitis.<br>
The nasal decongestants useful in the present invention include<br>
phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine and and pseudoephedrine. Pseudoephedrine as well as pharmaceutically acceptable acid additional salts, e.g., those of HCI or H2SO4, is a<br>
sympathomimetic drug recognized by those skilled in the art as a safe therapeutic agent effective for treating nasal congestion and is commonly administered orally and concomitantly with an antihistamine for treatment of nasal congestion associated with allergic rhinitis. The use of pseudoephedrine as a nasal decongestant in the present invention is preferred; the use of pseudoephedrine sulfate is more preferred.<br>
In the course of development of the oral dosage composition of this invention, it was discovered that the selection of the polymers for the polymer matrix core<br><br>
was critical to achieve the desired extended release period of at least 12 hours, preferably 12 to 16 hours and more preferably for at least 16 hours for pseudoephedrine sulfate. For example, the use of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose 4,000 cps or 15,000 cps as polymers in the matrix core did not provide this more preferred extended release period of at least 16 hours for dose of pseudoephedrine sulfate. We discovered that only by selecting for inclusion into the matrix core of specific weight ratios of three specific polymers was the desired pseudoephedrine release profile achieved. Only by combining (1) four parts by weight of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose 2208 USP, 100,000 cps with (2) one part by weight of ethyl cellulose together with (3) 1/2 part by weight of povidone as a secondary binder was the more preferred extended release profile of at least 16 hours for pseudoephedrine sulfate from the matrix core achieved. The matrix core also contains specific amounts of silicon dioxide as a glidant and magnesium stearate as a lubricant. The tablet hardness 22 ± 6 Strong-Cobb Units (SCU) is not greatly affected by the higher level of lubricant (6mg/tablet) but it is preferred to maintain the lubricant level at l/IO pgrt by weight of lubricant to one part by weight of povidone as secondary binder.<br>
The term "lubricant' as used herein refers to a substance added to the dosage form to enable the dosage form, e.g., a tablet, after it has been compressed to releases from the mold or die.<br>

Typically suitable antifoaming agents include mixtures of homologous liquid methylsiloxane and silica gel available under the Simethecone tradename.<br>
The term "water-swellable film-forming neutral or cationic copolymeric ester," as used herein means neutral and cationic copolymers of ethyl acrylate and substituted unsubstituted methyl or ethyl methacrylate esters.<br>
Typically suitable water swellable film-forming neutral copolymeric esters include neutral copolymers of ethyl acrylate and methyl metharylate such as are available from Pharma Poloymers, a company of the Huls Group under the EUDRAGIT® Tradename; EUDRAGIT NE30D. and Kollicoat available from BASF, Mt Olive, New Jersey An aqueous dispersion containing 30% by weight of a neutral copolymer based on ethyl crylate and methyl methoacryiate (average molecular weight of approximately 800,000) is preferred.<br>

Such copolymers are available as aqueous dispersions of copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic acid esters with a low (substitution) content of quaternary ammonium groups present as salts, (e.g., quaternary ammonium chlorides). Type A and Type B are available as 30% aqueous dispersions under the EUDRAGIT RL SOD and EUDRAGIT RS 30D tradenames, respectively.

During the course of development of the formulations of the present invention, we discovered that the in vitro dissolution studies showed a decrease in both the desloratadine release rate and in desloratadine concentration at increased pH, especially pH values &gt; 7.0, compared to those for a 5 mg tablet of desloratadine. The in vivo studies showed the Tmax was greater than 4 hours and that a significant part of the absorptive desloratadine process occurs in the small intestine which has an alkaline pH (pH values &gt; 7.0).<br>
We discovered we could increase the release of desloratadine by increasing the level of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and lowering the levels of the plasticizing agent, e.g., polyethylene glycol 8000, and of the lubricant, e.g., talc, in the second film coating containing desloratadine. See Example 4.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the effective amount of desloratadine in the second film coating was increased to 6.0 mg and amount of talc was reduced (by about 1.12 mg)to produce an acceptable pharmacokinetic profile.See Example 3 and Table 3.<br>
For the solid oral dosage formulations of the present invention, the geometric mean maximum plasma concentration of pseudoephedrine (PES) is about 345 ng/mL to about 365 ng/mL at a time (Tmax) of about 7.60 hours to about 8.40 hours; the geometric mean maximum plasma concentrate of desloratadine (DL) is about 2.10 ng/mL to about 2.45 ng/mL , preferably 2.15 ng/mL to about 2.35 ng/mL at a time (Tmax), of about 4.0 hours to about 4.5 hours and the geometric mean maximum plasma concentrate of 3-hydroxydesloratadine (3-OH-DL) is about 0.75 ng/mL to about 1.15 ng/mL, preferably about 0.85 ng/mL to about 1.05 ng/mL , and more preferably preferably about 0.88 ng/mL to about 1.02 ng/mL at a time (Tmax) of about 5,50 hours to about 6.25 hours after administration of a single dose of said composition to healthy subjects.<br><br>
Pharmacokinetic Study No. 1:<br>
The pharmacokinetic objective of this study was to determine the bioavailability and bioequivalence of desloratadine (DL), 3-OH DL and pseudoephedrine(PES) from the formulation of Example 2 (5 mg of DL/240 mg of PES) of this application relative to that of a 5 mg of Example 11 of USP No..6,100,274 (USP '274) and an extended-release pseudoephedrine core as references. This study was a Phase I, open-label, single-dose, randomized, three-way crossover study with a seven-day washout period between each treatment. Thirty-six healthy male and female subjects received each of the following treatments in the order assigned by a computer-generated random code:<br>
Treatment A:	One 5 mg DL/240 mg PES tablet of Example 2.<br>
Treatment B:	One DL 5 mg tablet of Example 11 of USP.'274.<br>
Treatment C:	One 240 mg pseudoephedrine sulphate (oval<br>
extended-release pseudoephedrine cores from Claritin® D-24 coated with placebo Claritin® D-24 coat).<br>
The tablets were administered with 180 mL (6 fluid ounces) of non-carbonated room temperature water. The tablet was swallowed whole, not chewed or crushed. After dosing, the oral cavity was inspected to assure that the subject had swallowed the tablet. Subjects continued fasting until the four-hour study procedures were complete. Water was permitted throughout the fasting period, except for two hours post-dose. The subjects remained awake and seated upright/ambulatory for four hours post-dose. All subjects were confined to the study site until the 120-hour blood samples, vital signs and laboratory tests were obtained.<br>
Serial blood samples (10 mL) were to be collected into tubes containing heparin as an anticoagulant at the following time points: 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post-dose. No<br><br>
food was allowed for four hours after dosing. Drinking water was not allowed from one hour pre-dose to one hour postdose, except for the 120 mL administered with the treatment. Plasma concentrations of pseudoephedrine were determined using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) method with a lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 10.0 ng/mL, and a linear range of 10.0-400 ng/mL. The associated mean pharmacokinetic parameters are provided in Table 1.<br>
The mean DL Cmax following administration of DL tablet of Example 2 of the present invention or a 5 mg desloratadine tablet of Example 11 of USP 6,100,274 were 1.79 and 2.23 ng/mL, respectively, and were reached at mean Tmax values of 6.78 and 5.10 hours, respectively.<br>

The mean 3-OH DL Cmax following administration of 5 mgDL/240 mgPES tablet of Example 2 of this application and a 5 mg desloratadine tablet of Example 11 of USP 6,100,274 were 0.695 and 0.832 ng/mL, respectively, and were reached at mean Tmax values of 6.09 and 4.96 hours, respectively. The peak plasma concentration of 3-OH DL decreased slowly with half-life of 29.6 hours following administration of 5 mgDL/240 mgPES tablet of Example 2 of this application, and 29.5 hours following administration of the 5 mg DL tablet of USP 6,100,274.<br><br>
statistical comparisons of Cmax and AUC{tf) following administration of tablet of Example 2 of this application and 5 mg desioratadine tablet of USP 6,100,274were performed for DK and 3-OH DL plasma concentrations.<br>
The results showed that the 90% confidence intervals for DL and 3-OH DL did not meet the 80-125% bioequivalence guidelines for both Cmax and AUC(tf). For those subjects where AUC(I) could be determined, the confidence intervals of DL for AUC(I) did not meet the 80-125 bioequivancy guidelines. However, the confidence intervals of 3-OH DL for AUC(l) did meet the 80-125 bioequivances guidelines.<br>
