LEVER OPERATED PUNCH WITH STRENGTHENED FLAP AND PUNCH HEAD ADJUSTMENT ARRANGEMENT<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Punches with slidable slippers are old. Slippered punches with adjustable punch stations are also old but removal of the slipper is required to accomplish adjustment.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Broadly, the present invention is a slippered adjustable hand-operated punch with adjustment accomplished from the bottom of the punch without slipper removal.  The flap handle is configured for added strength.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the punch of the present invention having a handle and a lever;<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along line 2-2 of Fig. 1 showing the flap handle's reverse curl;<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the punch with lever removed;<br>
Fig. 4 is a sectional view along line 4-4 of Fig. 3;<br>
Fig. 5 is a bottom perspective view of the punch with slipper removed;<br>
Fig. 6 is a partial perspective bottom view of the punch with the slipper installed;<br>
Fig. 7 is a top perspective view of the base with the slipper extended for emptying;<br>
Fig. 8 is a top perspective view of the slipper;<br><br>
Fig. 9 is a plan view of the flap handle; and<br>
Fig, 10 is an elevational view of the handle viewed from the reverse curl edge.<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
In Figs. 1-4, punch 10 includes base 11, end uprights 12a, 12b, handle 14 including upper planar surface 13, handle depressions 13a, 13b, 13c mounted for pivoting around pins 16a, 16b on uprights 12a, 12b.  Lever 17 is pivotally mounted on brackets 18a, 18b.  Also shown are punch assembly heads 21a, 21b, 2lc and slipper 23 mounted on base rails lla, lib. Heads 21a-c include groove curls 34a-c which reside in groove 40 to prevent turning of heads 21a-c as they are translated (see also Fig* 7).<br>
Turning in particular to Fig. 2, handle 14 is formed of a sheet metal and comprises remote flange end 14a substantially perpendicular to planar surface 13, (remote* from pivot pin 16b); renote planar portion 14b, depression portion 13a, near planar port-ion 14c; near vertical flange portion 14d perpendicular to planar surface 13 and reverse curl portion 15.  Reverse curl portion 15 functions to stiffen and otherwise strengthen handle 14 and includes arc portion 15a and upright: lip portion 15b.<br>
The sheet metal of handle 14 has thickness T. Table 1 below outlines ranges of handle 14 portions in relationship to thickness T.<br><br><br>
Turning to Figs. 4-8, it is seen that punch assembly Leads 21a, 21b and 21c are adjustable using retaining screws ;6a, 26b and 26c which travel in adjustment slots 27, 28 Fig. 5) while head groove projections 34a-c travel in .ongitudinal frame groove 40.  Groove 40 is a longitudinal irea below frame upper surface llu and a lower frame surface .11.  Groove projections 34a-c extend beyond and below frame surface llu which permits curl projections 34a-c to move back md forth in groove 40 during head adjustment and while preventing rotation of head 21a-c during the loosening of leads, their movement to adjust punch hole spacing and their retightening.  If a head 21a-c attempts to rotate its curl projection 34a-c will engage frame edge lie to prevent such rotation.  Curl projections 34a-c may be of other shapes but a curved curled shape is preferred.  Adjustment screws are threadedly engaged in threaded housing openings 31a, 31b and 3lc (Fig. 4).  Punch pin P is shown in Fig. 4.  Base bottom lib is shown in Fig. 5.  Slipper 23 has center opening 29 to permit access to adjustment screws 26a-c without removing* slipper 23.<br>
Fig. 7 shows slipper 23 slid open for emptying-and further shows base rail 11a, lib, uprights 12af 12b, slcrs 27, 28 and adjustment screws 26a-c and groove 40.<br>
In Fig. 8, slipper center opening 29 is boarded by cowling 36 having ends 29a, 29b which cowling 36 has a height 36h sufficient to nearly abut base bottom lib to prevent chips from escaping and exiting through center opening 28. Also shown are slipper flanges 23a, 23b and slipper slotted end 23c, and slipper closed end 23d.  Slots 37a, 37b permit slipper 23 to be slid open without removal from base flanges lla, lib.  When slipper 23 is slid open cowling end 29a engages retains screw 26c to limit its travel.  Center opening 29 is longer than the distance (D) between outside adjustment screws 26a and 26c to permit sliding of slipper 23 relative to base 11.  The length of opening 29 is less than<br><br>
the overall length of slipper 23 so that paper punch outs which are all deposited on one side of cowling 36 can migrate past cowling ends 29a, 29b to the other side as punch 10 is handled and manipulated*<br>
Finally in Figs. 9 and 10, the structural curl 15 of handle 14 has a length B which is less than the overall length A of handle 14.  Preferably, length B is at least 60% of length A.<br><br><br>
