GERMICIDAL BLOOMING TYPE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING BIPHENYL SOLVENTS<br>
The present invention relates to blooming type hard surface cleaning compositions. More particularly the present invention relates to concentrated liquid compositions which are nonracially diluted in a larger volume of water to form a working solution therefrom, and which exhibit a blooming effect when diluted.<br>
Blooming is a property exhibited by dilutable compositions such as known cleaning compositions, specifically pine-oil type cleaning compositions which contain a significant amount (generally at least about 5% and more) of pine oil. Certain phenolic disinfectant compounds, such as LYSOL(RTM) (where "RTM** indicates a proprietary trade name or trademark) disinfectant concentrate (Racket &amp; Colman, Inc., Montvale NJ) also exhibit such a blooming property. Blooming may be characterized as the formation of milky, creamy or cloudy appearance which is manifested when a dilutable composition is added to a larger volume or quantity of water.<br>
Such blooming is particularly desirable in compositions where the blooming characteristic in an aqueous dilution is long lasting.<br>
Accordingly it is an object of the invention to provide an aqueous concentrated liquid hard surface cleaning composition which blooms when added to a larger volume of water which comprises the following constituents:<br>
an organic solvent constituent;<br>
binary co-solvent system comprising an alkyl diphenyl solvent and a co-solvent;<br>
an amine oxide surfactant constituent;<br>
optionally, a further detersive surfactant constituent;<br>
optionally but desirably at least one optional constituent selected from: chelating agents, coloring agent, light stabilizers, fragrances, thickening agents, hydrotropism, pH adjusting agents, pH buffers, as well as others known the art and useful in similar compositions. The one or more optional constituents are selected<br><br>
to be present, and are included in amounts which do not undesirably affect the overall blooming characteristics of the present inventive compositions.<br>
In preferred embodiments the concentrate compositions provide excellent initial blooming characteristics in *as mixed' dilutions with water.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide such a concentrated Quid hard surface cleaning composition wherein the composition exhibits a blooming effect when diluted in a larger volume of water.<br>
It is among the further object of the invention to provide such a concentrated liquid hard surface cleaning composition wherein the composition exhibits good long term stability, i.e., shelf stability in its concentrated form.<br>
It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a process for the cleaning of hard surfaces utilizing the compositions in either concentrated form or in diluted form as described herein.<br>
Desirably, the inventive compositions are essentially free of no terpene solvents such as alpha-terpineols or d-Limonene which are characteristic of products such as so-called "pine oil" cleaning compositions which typically include such terpene solvents.<br>
The inventive compositions include an organic solvent constituent. Many useful organic solvents may be used, as long as it does not imdesirably disrupt the favorable characteristics of the invention, especially the blooming characteristic. Mixtures of two or more organic solvents may also be used as the organic solvent constituent.<br>
Useful organic solvents are those which are at least partially water-miscible such as alcohols, water-miscible ethers (e.g. diethylene glycol diethylether, diethylene glycol dimethylether, propylene glycol dimethylether), water-miscible glycol ether (e.g. propylene glycol monomethylether, propylene glycol mono ethylether, propylene glycol monopropylether, propylene glycol monobutylether, ethylene glycol monobutylether, dipropylene glycol monomethylether, diethyleneglycol monobutylether), lower esters of monoalkylethers of ethyleneglycol or propylene glycol (e.g. propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate) all commercially available<br><br>
from Union Carbide, Dow Chemicals or Hoescht. Mixtures of organic solvents can also be used.<br>
Particularly useful organic solvents include glycols such as alkylene glycols such as propylene glycol, and glycol ethers. Useful glycol ethers are those having the general structure Ra-0-Rb-OH, wherein Ra is an alkyl of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or an aryl of at least 6 carbon atoms, and Br is an alkylene of 1 to 8 carbons or is an ether or polyether containing from 2 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of such useful glycol ethers include propylene glycol methyl ether, dipropylene glycol methyl ether, tripropylene glycol methyl ether, propylene glycol isobutyl ether, ethylene glycol methyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl ether, ethylene glycol butyl ether, diethylene glycol phenyl ether, propylene glycol phenol ether, and mixtures thereof Preferred are ethylene glycol n-butyl ether, diethylene glycol n-butyl ether, and mixtures thereof. Such glycol ethers are presently commercially available from a number of sources including in the DOWANOL*"â€˜ glycol ether from The Dow Chemical Company, Midland MI (USA).<br>
Further particularly useful organic solvents monohydric (straight chained or branched) primary, secondary or tertiary lower aliphatic alcohols, especially Ci-Ce aliphatic primary and secondary alcohols, of which isopropanol is particularly preferred.<br>
The present inventors have oimd that inclusion of the organic solvent constituent in amounts of about 0,001% by weight to about 50% by weight have been oimd to be effective in providing effective cleaning, particularly when the compositions are dispersed into a larger volume of water, as well as in solubilizing other less water soluble constituents present in the concentrate compositions of the invention. Preferably, the organic solvent constituent is present in amoimt of from 0.1 - 40% by weight, and most preferably from about 0.1 - 35% by weight,<br>
Additionally the inventor has found the according to certain preferred embodiments the organic solvent constituent, comprises, and in certain especially preferred embodiments consist essentially of, both an alkylene glycol such as propylene glycol, and a monohydric lower aliphatic alcohol such as a Ci-Câ€™ aliphatic primary and secondary alcohol, especially isopropyl alcohol.<br><br>
The inventive compositions further also include a binary co-solvent system comprising alkyl biphenyl solvent and a co-solvent which aids in the solubiUzation of the biphenyl solvent in an aqueous medium.<br>
The alkyl biphenyl solvent is one which may be generally represented by the formula<br>
(Rl)m<br>
(R2)n wherein:<br>
Ri is hydrogen or is a lower alkyl radical, preferably a   but more preferably is a  straight chained or branched alkyl radical,<br>
R2 is a lower alkyl radical, preferably a  , but more preferably is   straight chained or branched alkyl radical,<br>
m is an integer from 1-3 inclusive; and,<br>
n is an integer from 1-3 inclusive. Preferably Ri is hydrogen, m is 1, and R2 has any of the values indicated above. More preferably, Ri is hydrogen and m is 1, and R2 is a C1-C6 straight chained or branched alkyl radical.  It is to be imderstood that mixtures of the compounds indicated above may be used as the biphenyl solvent constituent.<br>
Such alkyl biphenyls are, per se, known to the art, and are described in US 3787181. Particularly useful as the alkyl biphenyl solvent are materials presently marketed as NUSOLV(RTM) ABP solvents (Ridge Technologies Inc., Ridgewood NJ) described to be a high purity alkyl biphenyls and mixtures thereof, and is also available from Koch Chemical Co, (Corpus Christi, TX) as SURESOL(RTM) solvents.<br>
The alkyl biphenyl solvent may be present in the concentrate compositions in amounts of from about 0.001 % by weight to up to about 20% by weight, preferably about 0.01-10 % by weight, most preferably in amoimt of between 0.1-8 % by weight<br>
The inventors have observed that the concentrated compositions of the invention are greatly improved with the addition of a co-solvent. This co-solvent<br><br>
aids in the volatilization of the alkyl biphenyl solvent in water is desirably an at least partially water-miscible monohydric primary alcohol, especially a water-miscible monohydric primary Cg-Cig alcohol. Particularly effective are acetyl, lauryl and myristyl alcohols, especially lauryl alcohols. The inventors have found that the inclusion of such alcohols greatly aids in the dissolution of the alkyl biphenyl solvents in the concentrate compositions according to the invention being described herein, which aids in ensuring that clarity of the concentrate composition is maintained which is particularly desirable from a consumer standpoint.<br>
The co-solvent may be present in the concentrate compositions in amounts of from about 0.001 % by weight to up to about 5% by weight, preferably about 0.01-3% by weight, most preferably in amount of between 0.1 - 2% by weight.<br>
The concentrate compositions also include one or more amine oxide surfactant constituents. Non-limiting examples of unsettle amine oxide semi-polar nonionic surfactants include those according to the formulae:<br><br>
wherein K\ is hydrogen or is an alkyl, 2-hydroxyalkyl, 3-hydroxyalkyl, or 3-alkoxy-2-hydroxypropyl radical where the alkyl and alkoxy parts contain from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, Ra and R3 are independently selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, or 3-hydroxypropyl, m is an integer from 2 to 4, and n is an integer from 0 to about 10. Preferably, the amine oxide semi-polar nonionic surfactants are those according to the formula immediately preceding wherein Ri is an alkyl radical of from 12 to 16 carbon atoms, R2 and R3 are independently selected from methyl or ethyl, and n has a value of 0 or when n has a value of from 1 - 10, m has a value of 2, Specific<br><br>
examples of such useful amine oxide semi-polar nonionic surfactants include cetyl-, myristyl- or lauryl- dimethyl amine oxide or mixtures thereof.<br>
A further useful general class of useful amine oxides which may be included in the amine oxide constituent according to the invention are further acyl di (lower alkyl) amine oxides in which the alkyl group has about 10-20, and preferably 12-16 carbon atoms, and can be straight or branched chain, saturated or xmsaturated. The lower alkyl groups include between 1 and 7 carbon atoms. Examples include those described above, as well as those m which the alkyl group is a mixture of different amine oxides, dimethyl cocoamine oxides, dimethyl (hydrogenated tallow) amine oxides, and myristyl/palmityl dimethyl amine oxides.<br>
A further class of useful amine oxides include alkyl di (hydroxy lower alkyl) amine oxides in which the alkyl group has about 10-20, and preferably 12-16 carbon atoms, and can be straight or branched chain, saturated or unsaturated. Examples are bis(2-hydroxyethyl) cocoamine oxide, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) tallowamine oxide; and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) stearylamine oxide.<br>
Further useful amine oxides include those which may be characterized as alkylamidopropyl di(lower alkyl) amine oxides in which the alkyl group has about 10-20, and preferably 12-16 carbon atoms, and can be straight or branched chain, saturated or imsaturated. Examples are cocoamidopropyl dimethyl amine oxide and tallowamidopropyl dimethyl amine oxide; and<br>
Additional useful amine oxides include those which may be referred to as alkylmorpholine oxides in which the alkyl group has about 10-20, and preferably 12-16 carbon atoms, and can be straight or branched chain, saturated or unsaturated.<br>
Exemplary amine oxide surfactant constituents include AO-728(RTM) which is described to be a composition containing 50%w1. of 6w-(2-hydroxyethyl Ci2-Ci5 alkyloxypropyl) amine oxide (Tomah Products Inc., Milton WI), and AMMONYX(RTM) CDO Special described to be cocoamidopropyl dimethyl amine (Stepan Co., Northfield JL).<br>
The amine oxide constituent is present in the inventive concentrate compositions in amounts of up to 30 %vâ€™., preferably in amoimt of from 0.1 -<br><br>
30%wt. and still more preferably in amounts of form 1 - 20%wt., yet more preferably 12-18%wt. and most preferably about 13-15%wt., based on the total weight of the concentrate composition.<br>
Water is added in order to provide 100% by weight of the concentrate composition. Water is added in amounts which are sufficient to foray the concentrated compositions which amount is sufficient to ensure the retention of a substantially clear characteristic when produced as a concentrate, but at the same time ensuring good blooming upon the addition of the concentrated composition to a further amount of water, or upon the addition of further water to the concentrate. The water may be tap water, but is preferably distilled and/or demonized water. If the water is tap water, it is preferably appropriately filtered in order to remove any undesirable impurities such as organics or in organics, especially minerals salts which are present in hard water which may thus interfere with the operation of the other constituents of the invention, as well as any other optional components of the liquid concentrates according to the invention.<br>
Other conventional additives known to the art but not expressly enumerated here may also be included in the compositions according to the invention. By way of non-limiting example without limitation these may include : chelating agents, coloring agents, light stabilizers, fragrances, thickening agents, hydrotropes, pH adjusting agents, pH buffers as well as one or more detersive surfactants which do not deleteriously detract from the blooming characteristics of the inventive compositions. Many of these materials are known to the art, per se, and are described in McCutcheon 's Detergents and Emulsifiers North American Edition, 1982; Kirk'Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd Ed., Vol. 22, pp. 346-387, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. Mixtures of two or more such surface active agents may be incorporated into the inventive compositions.    Such optional, i.e., non-essential constituents should be selected so to have little or no detrimental effect upon the desirable characteristics of the present invention, namely the blooming behavior, cleaning efficacy, hard surface cleaning activity, and low toxicity as provided by the inventive compositions.<br><br>
Generally the total weight of such further conventional additives may comprise up to 20% by weight of a concentrated composition formulation.<br>
Further optional, but advantageously included constituents are one or more coloring agents which find use in modifying the appearance of the concentrate compositions and enhance their appearance from the perspective of a consumer or other end user. Known coloring agents, may be incorporated in the compositions in effective amount to improve or impart to concentrate compositions an appearance characteristic of a pine oil type concentrate composition, such as a color ranging from colorless to a deep amber, deep amber yellow or deep amber reddish color. Such a coloring agent or coloring agents may be added in any useful amount in a conventional fashion, i.e., admixing to a concentrate composition or blending with other constituents used to form a concentrate composition. However, other colors atypical of pine oil type cleaning concentrates may be used as well. Known art light stabilizer constituents useful in pine oil type compositions may also be added, particularly wherein coloring agents are used in a composition. As is known to the art, such light stabilizers act to retain the appearance characteristics of the concentrate compositions over longer intervals of time.<br>
When a fragrance is included in a concentrate composition being taught herein, the amount of such a fragrance is generally not in excess of 0.5%wt., but is preferably even less, i.e., to 0.20%wt, but generally even less, i.e., to 0.10%wt. It is contemplated that this fragrance constituent may include among its active agents terpene oils (alpha-terpineols, d-Limonene) which is included to provide a fragrance characteristic of a pine oil containing constituent. It is understood that such may be present in the inventive compositions as they may form part of the fragrance constituent forming part of a concentrate composition, but as they are present in only such small amounts they are not considered to be part of a solvent constituent. However, it is noted that the inventive compositions will function and exhibit satisfactory blooming effect without such a fragrance constituent being present.<br>
Exemplary useful buffers include the alkali metal phosphates, polyphospates, pyrophosphates, triphosphates, tetraphosphates, silicates, metasilicates, polysilicates, carbonates, hydroxides, and mixtures of the same.<br><br>
Certain salts, such as the alkaline earth phosphates, carbonates, hydroxides, can   . also function as buffers. It may also be suitable to use buffers such materials as aluminosilicates (zeolites), borates, aluminates and certain organic materials such as gluconate, succinates, maleates, and their alkali metal salts. Such buffers keep the pH ranges of the compositions of the present invention within acceptable limits.<br>
Exemplary useful pH adjusting agents include known materials which may be used to adjust the pH of the concentrate compositions to a desired range.<br>
The inventive compositions further include optionally, but in certain embodiments, desirably, one or more further detersive surfactants.   Useful detersive surfactants include anionic, nonionic, cationic and amphitricha surfactants which are found to not undesirably detract from the blooming characteristics of the present invention.<br>
The useful nonionic surfactantsâ€™ include known art nonionic surfactant compounds. Practically any hydrophobic compound having a carboxy, hydroxy, amido, or amino group with a free hydrogen attached to the nitrogen can be condensed with ethylene oxide or with the polyhydration product thereof, polyethylene glycol, to form a water soluble nonionic surfactant compound. Further, the length of the polyethylene hydrophobic and hydrophilic elements may various. Exemplary nonionic compounds include the polyoxyethylene ethers of alkyl aromatic hydroxy compounds, e.g., alkylated polyoxyethylene phenols, polyoxyethylene ethers of long chain aliphatic alcohols, the polyoxyethylene ethers of hydrophobic propylene oxide polymers, and the higher alkyl amine oxides.<br>
Exemplary useful nonionic surfactants in the compositions according to the present invention include commercially well known surfactant compositions.<br>

emulsifiers and poor detergents. Additional satisfactory nonionic surfactant compositions include the condensation products of a secondary aliphatic alcohols containing 8 to 18 carbon atoms in a straight or branched chain configuration condensed with 5 to 30 moles of ethylene oxide.

What is to be understood by the term "concentrate" and "concentrate composition" in this specification and claims is the pre-consumer dilution and composition of the cleaning composition which is the essentially the form of the product prepared for sale to the consumer or other end user. Such a consumer or other end user would then normally be expected to dilute the same with water to form a cleaning composition. It is to be understood however that nothing in this invention would bar its use as cleaning composition without any further dilution and it may be used in the concentrations in which it was prepared for sale. Similarly, what is to be understood by the term "cleaning compositions" are the water diluted compositions which are expected to be prepared by the consumer or other end user by mixing a measured amount of the "concentrate" with water in order to form an appropriately diluted cleaning composition which is suitable for use in cleaning applications, especially in the cleaning of hard surfaces.<br>
It is also to be understood, that proportions of one or more constituents have been and generally are referred to as percent by weight or as parts by weight based on a measure of 100 % by weight, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
According to certain particularly preferred embodiments of the invention there are provided object of the invention to provide an aqueous concentrated liquid hard surface cleaning composition which blooms when added to a larger volume of water which comprises the following constituents:<br>
0.1 - 35%wt. of an organic solvent constituent;<br>
0.1 - 12%wt. of a binary co-solvent system comprising an alkyl diphenyl<br>
solvent and a co-solvent;<br>
1 - 20%wt. an amine oxide surfactant constituent;<br>
1 - 10%wt. of at least one further detersive surfactant constituent;<br><br>
0 - 20%wt. of at least one optional constituent selected from: chelating agents, coloring agent, light stabilizers, fragrances, thickening agents, hydrotropes, pH adjusting agents, pH buffers<br>
As generally denoted above, the formulations according to the invention include both cleaning compositions and concentrates as outlined above which differ only in the relative proportion of water to that of the other constituents forming such formulations. While the concentrated fomi of the cleaning compositions find use in their original fonn, they are more frequently used in the foliation of a cleaning composition therefrom. Such may be easily prepared by diluting measured amounts of the concentrate compositions in water by-the consumer or other end user in certain weight ratios of concentrate:water, and optionally, agitating the same to ensure even distribution of the concentrate in the water. As noted, the concentrate may be used without dilution, i.e,, in concentrate:water concentrations of 1:0, to extremely dilute dilutions such as 1:10,000. Desirably, the concentrate is diluted in the range of 1:0,1 - 1:1000, preferably in the range of 1:1 -1:500 but most preferably in the range of 1:10 -1:100. The actual dilution selected is in part determinable by the degree and amoimt of dirt and grime to be removed from a surface(s), the amount of mechanical force imparted to remove the same, as well as the observed efficacy of a particular dilution. Generally better results and faster removal is to be expected at lower relative dilutions of the concentrate in water.<br>
In accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention, when a quantity of the concentrate compositions taught herein are added to a larger volume of water, a blooming characteristic is manifested. Such "blooming" may be broadly characterized as the formation of milky, creamy or cloudy appearance which is manifested when a dilutable composition is added to a larger volume or quantity of water. Such "blooming" may be alternately characterized as the reduction of transmitted light through an amoimt of water by at least 30%, desirably by at least 40%, yet more desirably by at least about 50%, and yet most desirably by at least 60% or more when a dilution of the concentrate composition:water with the weight or volume ratio range of from 1:64 to 1:102 is<br><br>
formed. That such blooming may be attained without the use of pine oil fractions as is common in certain commercially available pine oil containing preparations is surprising.<br>
As has been noted, concentrate compositions according to preferred embodiments of the invention exhibit a long lasting blooming effect when they are diluted into a larger volume of water, especially when used to form (weight ratio) dilutions with water of concentrate:water of 1:64 at room temperature. Desirably, such dilutions do not exhibit an increase in light transmittance in accordance with the measurement methods discussed in the Examples below, of more than 50% (based on the initial *as mixed' value) during its initial three-day interval.<br>
The concentrate compositions according to the invention, and aqueous dilutions formed therefrom, are particularly useful in the cleaning of hard surfaces. By way of non-limiting example, hard surfaces include surfaces composed of refractory materials such as: glazed and unglazed tile, brick, porcelain, ceramics as well as stone including marble, granite, and other stones surfaces; glass; metals; plastics e.g. polyester, vinyl; fiberglass, FORMICA(RTM), CORIAN(RTM) and other hard surfaces known to the art. Hard surfaces which are to be particularly denoted include those associated with kitchen environments, lavatory environments, especially flooring surfaces and the surfaces of fixtures (doors, cabinets, shelving, and the like) in such environments.<br>
Such dilution ratios of concentrate:water as described above may be volume/volume basis, or a weight/weight basis.<br>
The following examples below illustrate exemplary and among them preferred formulations of the composition according to the instant invention. It is to be understood that these examples are presented by means of illustration only and that further silyl fonnulations fall within the scope of this invention and the claims may be readily produced by one skilled in the art and not deviate from the scope and spirit of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
The blooming characteristics of these formulations was characterized by using the Brinkman Sybron (RTM) PC 801 colorimeter. Each tested formulation were diluted with demonized water in a weight ratio of 1:64, and the test was carried out with each of the fomiulations and water at room temperature (68**F, 20*'C). The resulting determined values, reported as *Dooming" in the following table provide an empirical evaluation in percent transmittance (%) of the degree of transparency of a diluted example formulation wherein 0% indicates complete opacity and 100% the transparency of a demonized water sample. The result was tabulated as follows:<br><br>
Clanging Test:<br>
The compositions described on Table 1 provide good cleaning efficacy both in their as-mixed, concentrated form, and diluted in water in a weight ratio of 1:64,<br><br><br><br><br><br>
