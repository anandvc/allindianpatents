CASPASE INHIBITORS CONTAINING ISOXAZOLINE RING<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an isoxazoline derivative as an inhibitor against various caspases including caspase-l[interleukin-lp converting enzyme, ICE] and caspase-3[apopain/CPP-32], a process for preparing the same, and a therapeutic composition for preventing inflammation and apoptosis comprising the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Caspase is a new kind of cysteine protease in the form of (X2P2 discovered during the last 10 years. About 14 kinds thereof have been known until now. Caspase-1 (ICE), one of them, is a kind of cytokines and participates in converting the inactive prointerleukin-1β to the active interleukin-lβ. Interleukin-l consists of interleukin-la and interleukin-l P, both of which are synthesized in monocytes in the form of a precursor having 31kDa. Only prointerleukin-1β is activated by ICE. The positions hydrolyzed by caspase-1 are Asp27-Gly28 and AspU6-Ala117. The hydrolysis of the latter position gives interleukin-l p. Interleukin-l P has been reported to act as an important mediator in causing inflammation (1,3). Caspase-1 has been discovered for the first time in 1989, and in two independent study groups, the three dimensional structure thereof was determined by X-ray crystallographic method.<br>
Caspase-3(CPP-32) is broadly studied for its role or mechanism for action, and its three dimensional structure was determined in 1996(2). Caspase-3(apopain) activated from procaspase-3 hydrolyzes (P4)Asp-X-X-Asp(Pl) motif, and the known substrates include poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, Ul 70,000 Mr small nuclear ribonucleoprotein and catalytic subunit of 460,000 Mr DNA-dependent protein kinase, etc. The X-ray structure of caspase-7 has been reported to be very similar to that of caspase-3(4).<br><br>
Caspase-8 and 9 are present in the upstream of caspase-3,6,7, and these caspases are known to participate in the apoptosis cascade. The X-ray structure of caspase-8 was determined in 1999(5), and particularly the inhibitors thereof may be advantageously used for treating the diseases related to apoptosis.<br>
Caspase inhibitors mean those compounds that inhibit the activity of caspase, and so control such symptoms as inflammation, apoptosis, etc. caused by the caspase activity. Diseases or symptoms that may be treated or attenuated by administering the inhibitors include the following: reumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, graft vs. host disease, sepsis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia, meningitis, salpingitis, septic shock, cholangitis, colitis, encephalitis, endocarditis, glomerulonephritis, hepatitis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, type I diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, hepatocirrhosis(6).<br>
Among the caspase inhibitors known until now, the most noted irreversible inhibitors are the following:<br><br>
Both the above inhibitors exhibit their activity based on the common mechanism that they irreversibly inactivate the enzyme to suppress the cell apoptosis (irreversible, broad-spectrum inhibitor). It has been reported that irreversible inhibitor has much more effective inhibitory activity when comparing the irreversible and reversible inhibitors (7). Both IDN-1965 of IDUN Co. and MX-1013 of Maxim Co. are reported to show activity in cell apoptosis model for hepatic injury(8, 9). These compounds are now in the stage of preclinical test.    The irreversible inhibitor IDN-6556, the structure of which has been<br><br>
recently reported, is now in the stage of phase II clinical test as a therapeutic agent for hepatic injury( 10, 11).<br><br>

The compound of formula (1) according to the present invention has two (2) asymmetric carbon atoms, and so may exist in its stereoisomeric form including diastereomer.     Particularly preferred compounds among the stereoisomers are those<br><br>
having the following formula (la):<br><br>
and so it is another object of the present invention to provide the compound of formula (la) in the stereoisomeric form.<br>
Among the compound of formula (la), for example, the compound of (3S)-5-fluoro-3-({[(5i?)-5-isopropyl-3-(l-isoquinolinyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-<br>
isoxazolyl]carbonyl}amino)-4-oxopentanoic acid (Iii-1) may be obtained by a process comprising the steps of dissolving a mixture of (35) and (37?) in methyl t-butyl ether, adding a small amount of crystalline (35)-5-fluoro-3-({[(5R)-5-isopropyl-3-(l-isoquinolinyl)-4,5-dihydro«5-isoxazolyl]carbonyl}amino)-4-oxopentanoic acid as a seed material to give a crystal, and recrystallizing this crystal from ethyl acetate/n-hexane solvent system.<br>
The most preferred compounds among the compounds of formulae (1) and (la) are 5-fluoro-3-({[(5/?)-5-isopropyl-3-(l-isoquinolinyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-<br>
isoxazolyl]carbonyl}amino)-4-oxopentanoic   acid   (Iii);   and   (3iS)-5-fluoro-3-({[(5R)-5-isopropyl-3-(l-isoquinolinyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazolyl]carbonyl}amino)-4-oxopentanoic acid (Iii-1).<br>
The processes for the preparation of the novel isoxazoline derivative of formula (1) showing an inhibitory activity against caspases are depicted in the following Reaction Schemes 1 to 5. However, those illustrated in the following Reaction Schemes represent only the typical processes used in the present invention. The manipulation order may be changed with no limit, and so the processes are not restricted to those explained below.<br><br><br>
in which<br>
A, B, and R are defined as described above, and<br>
P1 represents simple alkyl chain.<br>
In Reaction Scheme 1 above, an aldehyde derivative (II) is reacted with hydroxylamine-hydrochloride and sodium carbonate in a solvent mixture of alcohol-water to give an oxime derivative (III) (a mixture of syn and anti oximes). The resulting oxime derivative (III) is treated by NCS (N-chlorosuccinimide) in dimethylformamide solution to give a hydroxamoyl chloride derivative (IV). Thus obtained hydroxamoyl chloride derivative (IV) is reacted with an acrylate derivative (V) to give an isoxazoline derivative (VI), which is then hydrolyzed, if needed, to give a deprotected isoxazoline derivative (VII). If appropriate, the oxime derivative (III), the acrylate derivative (V), and NaOCl may react together in a reaction vessel {in situ) to directly give the isoxazoline derivative (VI) (see Preparations 16 and 17).<br>
Reaction Scheme 2<br><br><br>
|(X = COCH2Z(Z=ORl\OC(=O)R12,   or   W)<br>
in which A, B, R, R1, R2, R11, R12, and W are defined as described above.<br>
In Reaction Scheme 2 above, a carboxylic acid derivative (VII) is coupled with an aspartic acid derivative (VIII) (see the following Reaction Scheme 3) to give a compound (IX), which is then subjected to Dess-Martin periodinane oxidation reaction, and deprotection reaction, if needed, to give the desired compound of formula (1).<br>
The functional group Z in the compound (I) of Reaction Scheme 2 may be formed through several steps as exemplified in the following Preparations 5 and 7 after the carboxylic acid compound (VII) on the left side is combined with an aspartic acid (β-t-Bu) methylester. Otherwise, as depicted in the following Reaction Scheme 3, the compound (VIII) already having the desired Z is synthesized first and coupled with the compound (VII) (Ref.: WO 00/23421). Further, when W is F, the racemic compound may be prepared according to a method known in Tetrahedron Letters, 1994, 55(52), 9693-9696.<br><br><br><br>
site. According to this, the carboxylic acid derivative (VII) as prepared in Reaction Scheme 1 is reacted with an amino alcohol derivative (XVII) to give a compound (XVI), which is then subjected to Dess-Martin oxidation and Wittig reactions to give the compound (I).<br><br>

To prepare the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention, an effective amount of the caspase inhibitor, particularly the compound of formula (1) or its salt, is mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier that may take a wide variety of forms depending on the formulation to be prepared.<br>
The caspase inhibitor compound may be formulated as a parenteral injection, or percutaneous or oral preparation depending on its application purpose. It is especially advantageous to formulate the composition in a unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.<br>
For the oral preparation, any usual pharmaceutical carrier may be used. For example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like may be used for such oral liquid preparations as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like may be used for such solid preparations as powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Due to their ease of administration, tablets and capsules are the most advantageous dosage unit forms. It is also desirable for tablets and pills to be formulated into enteric-coated preparation.<br>
For the parenteral preparation, sterile water is usually used as the carrier, though other ingredients such as solubility aids may be used. Injections, for example, sterilized aqueous or oily suspension for injection, can be prepared according to the known procedure using suitable dispersing agent, wetting agent, or suspending agent. Solvents that can be used for preparing injections include water, Ringer's fluid, and isotonic NaCl solution, and also sterilized fixing oil may be conveniently used as the solvent or<br><br>
suspending media.    Any non-stimulative fixing oil including mono-, di-glyceride may be used for this purpose.    Fatty acid such as oleic acid may also be used for injections.<br>

(35)-5-fluoro-3-({[(5R)-5-isopropyl-3-(l-isoquinolinyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazolyl]carbonyl}amino)-4-oxopentanoic acid (Iii-1)<br>
Crude t-butyl 5-fluoro-3-({[(5i?)-5-isopropyl-3-(l-isoquinolinyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazolyl]carbonyl}amino)-4-oxopentanoate (366 g) was dissolved in methylene chloride (1.9 kg) and cooled to 0°C. Triethylsilane (235 g) and trifluoroacetic acid (1.88 kg) were added and stirred for one hour at 0°C. The reaction mixture was distilled under reduced pressure, redissolved in ethyl acetate (2.4 kg), and the pH was adjusted to 5.2 by adding 2N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (3.1 L). The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted once with ethyl acetate (2.4 kg). Combined organic layer was distilled under reduced pressure to remove the solvent, the resulting residue was dissolved in methyl t-butyl ether (530 g), and small amount of crystalline (35)-5-fluoro-3-<br><br>
({[(5R)-5-isopropyl-3-(l-isoquinolinyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazolyl]carbonyl}amino)-4-oxopentanoic acid was added.    After stirring for 16 hours at room temperature, resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with the 9:1 mixture of methyl t-butyl ether and n-<br>
hexane(210 mi).<br>
Thus obtained (3S)-5-fluoro-3-({[(5R)-5-isopropyl-3-(l-isoquinolinyl)-4)5-dihydro-5-isoxazolyl]carbonyl}amino)-4-oxopentanoic acid was dissolved in ethyl acetate (240 mi) by heating at 50 °C, n-hexane (240 mi) was slowly added, and gradually cooled to room temperature. After stirring for 24 hours at room temperature, the resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with the 1:1 mixture of ethyl acetate and n-hexane (30 mi) to give the title compound (Iii-1, 46.0 g, 3S/3R=94/6.0). The optical purity was estimated using Luna column (4.6 x 250 mm, 5)µm, Cis). The mixture of acetonitrile/20mM NH4OAC (pH 6) (30/70) was used as the mobile phase at the flow rate of 1 ml/min. Under the detection wavelength of 227nm, the two optical isomers were observed at the retention times of 8.0 min (3R isomer) and 9.0 min (3S isomer), respectively.<br>
Experiment 1<br>
Determination of the caspase inhibitory effect<br>
Caspase-1 and caspase-8 known as cysteine proteases in the form of (X2P2 were expressed, purified, and activated by modifying a method known in Thornberry, N. A. et al, Nature, 1992, 356, 768. Thornberry, N. A. Methods in Enzymology, 1994, 244, 615. Walker, N. P. C. et al. Cell, 1994, 78, 343, and caspase-9 was also purified by a similar method, and the inhibitory activity against them was tested. Briefly describing, plO and p20 subunits (Thornberry, N. A. et al, Nature, 1992, 356, 768) were expressed in E.coli and purified by nickel column and anionic exchange chromatography to give caspase-1, caspase-8 and caspase-9. The fluorescent substrate AcYVAD-AFC for thus obtained caspase-1, AcDEVD-AFC for caspase-8, and AcLEHD-AFC for caspase-9 were used for determining specific activity of the synthesized inhibitors. The enzyme reaction was carried out at 25 °C with various concentrations of the inhibitors in a buffer solution<br><br>
containing 50mM HEPES(pH 7.50), 10%(w/v) sucrose, 0.1%(w/v) CHAPS, lOOmM NaCl, lmM EDTA, and lOmM DTT in the presence of 50|xM AcYVAD-AFC for lOnM caspase-1, 50µM AcDEVD-AFC for 2.1nM caspase-8, and 150^M AcLEHD-AFC for 200nM caspase-9. The inhibitory constants Kj and Kobs of the inhibitors were determined by measuring the reaction velocity with the time lapse using a fluorescent spectrometer and by obtaining the initial rate constant. Kabs was calculated from the Lineweaver Burk Plot, and Kabs from the following Equation 1.<br>
Equation 1<br>
Kabs=-ln(l-A/4oo)/t<br>
in which<br>

Aoo means the maximum cleavage rate (%).<br>
Spectra MAX GeminiXS Fluorescent Spectrometer of Molecular Device Co. was used at the excitation wavelength of 405nm and the emission wavelength of 505nm.<br>
The in vivo inhibitory activity of the inhibitors was determined by subjecting Jurkat cell (ATCC TIB-152) to apoptosis using Fas antibody (Upstate Biotech 05-201) and by detecting the color change according to the WST-1 method known in Francoeur A.M. and Assalian A. (1996) Biochemica 3, 19-25 to observe the amount of alive Jurkat cells when the cells were treated by the inhibitor. Spectra MAX 340 Spectrometer of Molecular Device Co. was used at the absorbance wavelength of 440nm.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Experiment 2<br>
Therapeutic effect for LPS-induced acute hepatitis in mouse<br>
Step 1) Preparation of blood sample<br>
Female Balb/c mice (6 weeks, Charles River Laboratory, Osaka, Japan) were kept under the conditions of 22 , 55% of relative humidity, and light-darkness cycle of 12 hours. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. In pyrogen-free saline were dissolved LPS (lipopolysaccaride) and D-galactosamine in concentrations of 0.4 mg/ml and 280 mg/ini, respectively, and their 1:1 mixture was injected to mice in the amount of<br><br>
5 ln-C/kg. Immediately after the injection of LPS and D-galactosamine, vehicle (a mixture of PEG400 : ethanol : Tween80 = 15 : 7.5 : 2.5 was diluted by five times with saline) wherein the test compound is dissolved or the vehicle alone was intraperitoneally injected into the mice. After 8 hours from the drug injection, blood samples were obtained from their hearts.<br>
Step 2: Determination of the activity of plasma aminotransferase The plasma ALT activity was determined for the blood samples obtained in Step 1 using ALT assay kit (Asan Pharm. Co., Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instruction. As a result, it appeared that the injection of LPS and D-galactosamine steeply increases the ALT activity in plasma, and the test compounds inhibit the increased enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. Based on these results, ED50 values of the test compounds were calculated using Prism software of GraphPad Co. to give 0.01-10mg/kg.<br>
Experiment 3<br>
Inhibitory effect against hepatic fibrosis in SD rats<br>
Step 1) Induction of hepatic fibrosis and administration<br>
Male Spargue-Dawley rats (6 weeks, Korea Biolink) were kept under the conditions of 22 , 55% of relative humidity, and light-darkness cycle of 12 hours. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. For the ligation of biliary duct, the rats were anesthetized by inhalation of 1% halothane, abdomen of the rats were cut open, the distal and proximal biliary ducts were ligated, the part between the ligation sites were cut, 2 mi of saline was injected, and sutured.<br>
Test compound (Iii) was orally administered in a dosage of 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg twice a day. That is, the compound was dissolved in a cosolvent (PEG400 : ethanol : Tween80 = 15 : 7.5 : 2.5), diluted with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) by five times, and administered. To the control group was administered the solution without the test compound.    The administration was made for 1 week after 1 week from the ligation of<br><br>
biliary duct.<br>
Step 2: Preparation of tissue section and Sirius red staining<br>
After the administration, the rats were sacrificed. The livers were fixed by 10% neutral formalin and a paraffin section of 5 pm thickness was prepared and stained by 0.1% Sirius red (Direct red 80, Sigma). The tissue section was investigated by an optical microscope to observe the collagen fibers stained in red, and the results are represented in Figure 1.<br>
Experiment 4<br>
Inhibitory effect against apoptosis during the bile stagnation in SD rats<br>
The test compound (Iii) was administered to the SD rats whose biliary ducts were ligated according to the procedure as Step 1 of Experiment 3. After 2 weeks from the operation, the rats were sacrificed. The livers were fixed by 10% neutral formalin and a paraffin section of 5 µm thickness was prepared. TUNEL staining was carried out using ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's instruction. More than 10 sites of the TUNEL stained liver tissue were photographed in 200 magnifications without any overlap, of which result was shown in Figure 2. The number of cells suffering apoptosis in each test group was counted and represented in the following Table 2. In the following table, the Sham operation means the case where the biliary duct was exposed but not ligated, and the BDL operation means the case where only the vehicle was administered after the ligation of biliary duct.<br><br><br>
Conclusion<br>
The effective inhibition of apoptosis (75% inhibition) by Compound (Iii) was shown by TUNEL staining in a model established by the induction of hepatic fibrosis through the bile stagnation. In addition, the Sirius Red staining showed a severe fibrosis in the control group, but almost no fibrosis in the Compound (Iii) treated group. This result demonstrates the inhibitory effect of Compound (Iii) against hepatic fibrosis in rats, and so it is expected that Compound (Iii) can exhibit the pharmacological activity of suppressing liver cirrhosis by inhibiting the apoptosis of hepatic cell in clinical application. The application may be expanded not only to the hepatic cirrhosis by bile stagnation, but also to various hepatic diseases where hepatic fibrosis due to the apoptosis is included.<br>
Experiment 5 Antiphlogistic effect in rats<br>
Male SD rats (6 weeks, Orient) were kept under the conditions of 22 , 55% of relative humidity, and light-darkness cycle of 12 hours. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. Before the induction of edema, the foot volume of each rat was measured by plethysmometer. Before the induction of edema, vehicle (a mixture of PEG400 : ethanol : Tween80 = 15 : 7.5 : 2.5 was diluted by ten times with phosphate buffer) wherein the test compound is dissolved or the vehicle alone was orally administered into the rats. Carrageenan (gamma) was dissolved in the concentration of 1% in saline, and subcutaneously injected into the right rear foot of the rats in the dosage of 100 µl. After 3 hours, the right foot volume was measured again by plethysmometer. The effect of the test compound was shown by edema inhibition (%) (see Table 3). The edema inhibition (%) was calculated according to the following Equation 2.<br>
Equation 2<br>
Edema Inhibition (%) = 100 x (Average of the increased foot volume in the vehicle-administered group - Increased foot volume in the test compound-administered group)/Average of the increased foot volume in the vehicle-administered group<br><br><br>
Experiment 6<br>
Therapeutic effect for rheumatic arthritis in rats<br>
Female Lewis rats (7 weeks, Charles River, Japan) were kept under the conditions of 22 , 55% of relative humidity, and light-darkness cycle of 12 hours. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. Type II collagen (bovine) was dissolved in 0.05M acetic acid in a concentration of 2 mg/ml at 4 , and the same amount of Complete Freund's adjuvant was added to emulsify the solution at 4 . 0.1 mi of thus emulsified solution was subcutaneously injected into the rattail of the Lewis rats. After 7 days, the emulsified solution was injected again in the same manner. From the date on which the second emulsified solution was injected, vehicle (a mixture of PEG400 : ethanol : Tween80 = 15 : 7.5 : 2.5 was diluted by ten times with phosphate buffer) wherein the test compound is dissolved or the vehicle alone was orally administered into the rats every day. On Day 14 from the first injection of the collagen-containing emulsified solution, the right rear foot volume was measured again by plethysmometer (see Table 4). The edema inhibition (%) was determined by the following Equation 3.<br>
Equation 3<br>
Edema Inhibition (%) = 100 x (Average of the increased foot volume in the vehicle-administered group on Day 14 - Increased foot volume in the test compound-administered group on Day 14)/Average of the increased foot volume in the vehicle-administered group on Day 14<br><br>
Further, p-value was calculated by Student t-test from the increased foot volume on Day 14 to confirm the significance.<br><br>
In the foot edema test in rats, Compound (Iii) showed a dose-dependent edema inhibition effect of about 2, 21, and 23% at a dosage of 3, 30, and 100 mg/kg, respectively. In the model of rheumatic arthritis, the foot edema was decreased significantly (about 70% decrease) in the Compound (Iii)-administered group on Day 14 when the negative control group showed the maximum edema. Therefore, it is considered that Compound (Iii) has an inhibitory effect against the progress of inflammation in an inflammatory disease model, and so can treat the autoimmune inflammatory diseases.<br>
