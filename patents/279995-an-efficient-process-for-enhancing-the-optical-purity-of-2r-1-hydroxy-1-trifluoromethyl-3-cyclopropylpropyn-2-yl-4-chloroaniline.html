<br>
•	filtering the aged slurry of the amino alcohol acid addition salt to isolate a wet cake of the amino alcohol acid addition salt;<br>
<br>
•	washing the wet cake of the amino alcohol acid addition salt with cold organic solvent; and<br>
<br>
•	drying the wet cake of the amino alcohol acid addition salt to isolate the amino alcohol acid addition salt as a solid with enhanced optical purity.<br>
<br>
Our co pending application No.l453/CHE/2008 discloses a process to enhance the optical purity of 2R-[1-hydroxy-l-trifluoromethyl-3-cyclopropylpropyn-2-yl]-4-chloroaniline comprising the steps of:<br>
