COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING CHICK PEA EXTRACT AND RETINOIDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to cosmetic compositions containing chick pea extract in combination with retinoids and to methods of conditioning skin by the application of such compositions to the skin.<br>
BACKGROUND Of THE INVENTION<br>
Retinol (vitamin A) is en endogenous compound which occurs naturally in the huraan body and is essential for normal epithelial cell differentiation. Natural and synthetic vitamin A derivatives have been used extensively in the treatment of a variety of skin disorders and as skin repair and renewal agents. P.etinoic acid has been used to treat a variety of skin conditions such as acne, wrinkles, psoriasis, age spots and skin discoloration.<br>
Within the cells, retinol and retinoic acid are bound to specific cellular binding proteins, two of the major proteins are CRA3P-1 and -2 (Roos ec el., Pharmacological reviews: 50, 315-333, -1993). These proteins act in reculatinc the intracellular concentration of retinoids by acting as both storage or shuttle proteins in retinoid metabolism. The levels cf this protein are regulated by the amount of cf retinoic acid   within the cells. Higher cellular<br><br><br>
levels of retinoids increase the expression cf CRAEP-2. Therefore, the amount of this protein in the ceils, is a measure of the retinoid activity cf the cells. Skin cells contain CRABP-2 both in the epidermis and the dermis. CRA3P-2 response to retinoid administration in fibroblasts in. vitro is used as a reproducible measure cf retinoid bicactivity that predict human skin responses (Elder et al., J.' Invest. Dermatol., 106: 517-521, 1996). Therefore, CRABP-2 expression of fibroblasts is a measure cf retinoid activity leading to various cosmetic skin benefits (antiaging, anti wrinkling, skin conditioning etc.;.<br>
Chick pea or Spanish pea (Cicer ariezinum) , a common dietary lentil, contains flavonoids including daidzein, formononetin, biochanin A, pratensein, homcferreirin, medicarpin, maackiain, methyl coumestrol, medicagol, fonr.ononetin giucoside and biochanin A glucoside (Ingham et al., In: Progress in the chemistry of Organic natural products, vol 43: Ed-W. Herz et al., Springer-Verlag, Wien, New York, 1983) . Flavonoids derived from chick pea have beer, reported to have lipid lowering effects in the blood and liver of rats. Several nutritional studies report on protein derived from chick pea for use as nutritional supplements and ways to improve the protein quality of chick pea. Vasiliou, US patent 4,761,285 discloses the use of chick peas as a dietary supplement or for internal or topitai treatment of haemorrhoids. In India, a cosmetic mask cr skin treatment made from chick pea powder .-.ixec with water is a common beauty treatment.<br><br>
The present invention is based in part on the discovery that the organic solvent chick pea extract in corbination with retinoids enhances CRA8P-2 expression in fibroblasts.<br>

The following specific examples further illustrate the invention, but the invention is not limited thereto. In all examples, chick pea was obtained from local supermarkets. Retinoids were obtained from Sigma. The student t-test was used to calculate all p-values.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following methods were employed:<br>
Methods:<br>
1. Preparation of chick pea extracts:<br>
Dried chick peas were purchased from local supermarkets and powdered in a dry grinder. An alcoholic extract of the chick peas was prepared by stirring 1 gram of the dry chick pea powder in 10 ml of sthanol for 4 to 24 hrs at room temperature. The extract was clarified by filtration and centrifugation, to obtain a 10% extract of chick pea in ethanol.<br>
2.  Cell culture method: Humars adult fibroblasts obtained from sun-protectec inner arm of 25-30 old year female volunteers were used. Cells were grown in 1:1 DMEM/Hams F12 media containing -10% FBS,<br>
mai.-.tainec at 37'C  in a 5*  CO2 atmosphere under normal<br>
atmospheric oxygen tension. Third passage adult fibroblasts<br><br>
were grown in DMEM media with 10% F3S in 12-well plates at a seeding density cf 40,000 cells/mi/well. The cells at 80% confluence were- rinsed in serum free and phenol red free (PRF) DMEM media twice. Pre-treatment with chick pea extract for 4 hours was conducted and then dosed with retinoids and was incubated for 43 hours. After incubation, the wells were washed twice with IX P3S and the cell monolayer was harvested in 100ul ceil lysis buffer (contains IX PBS, 1% TritonX, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS containing protease inhibitor (10mg/ml PMSF in isopropanol, 10u/ml) ) . The suspension was spun at 14000rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant collected and an aliquot of the supernatant used for protein quantification. The protein concentration was determined using a Pierce protein kit. The remainder of the lOOul supernatant (cell iysate) was denatured in a mixture of 40ul sample buffer (NOVEX) and 0.5% 3eta mercaptoechanol (BME) by boiling the sample for 5 minutes. Equal amounts of protein was then loaded onto 16% Tris-glycine gels for protein analysis by SDS page and Western Immuno-blotting for CRABP-2 protein expression.<br>
3.   Detection of Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein 2 (CRA3P-2) in fibroblasts:<br>
In order to measure the levels of CRABP-2 in the fibroblasts prepared as described above, the cell supernatant was re-suspended in 4X sample buffer anz 0.5% BME, boiled for 5 minutes and used for western blotting. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 16% Tris-glycine gels for CRABP-2 protein analysis by SDS page and Western Immuno-blotting. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose blots and Western Blotting was carried out using ncnoclonai antibodies<br><br>
to CRA3F-2 according to standard procedures. The CRABF-2 protein band was visualized in the Western 3iots using the chemilumir.escence system obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SantaCruz, CA) . The bends in the film were quantitated by densitometric scanning, the data' from triplicate samples were calculated as % of control and expressed in the following tables as % increase over control (with control as 100%) +/-SD of triplicates.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-4<br>
The,examples investigated the effect en CRA3P-2 expression of fibroblasts of combinations of various concentrations of chic! pea extract and retinoids.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: 100 nM retinoids and 0.lul of a 10% chick pea extract<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2: 100 nM retinoids and 1.0 v.1      of a 10% chick pe extract<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 3: 500 r.M retinoids and 0.1 pi of a 10% chick pea extract<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE: 4: 500 nM retinoids and 1.0 ul of a 101 chick extract:<br><br>
The results  summarized in  Examples  1-4  demonstrate that retinoids at some concentrations synergize with chick  pea extract  at  some  concentrations.    Optimum  synergy was observed with ail the retinoids at 500 nM level and 1 ul of chick pea extract.<br>
