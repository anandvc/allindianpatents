				<td>COMPACT DISK CASE BASE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a compact disk case, and more particularly to a compact disk case base that prevents a compact disc (CD) from being scraped.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Compact disks (CD) such as video compact discs (VCD), digital versatile discs (DVD) or the like are light and thin and are easy to carry, and data stored on CDs is robust. Furthermore, the compact disks hold more data than floppy disks and are quickly replacing floppy disks as the portable memory of choice. However, compact disks will be bent and need to be protected. Generally, compact disks are carried in a soft envelope and can break easily. Therefore, compact disk cases are more sturdy and used to protect CDs.<br>
With reference to Fig. 6, a conventional compact disk case base (6) holds compact disks (2) that individually comprise a reading sector (54) and a through hole (52) and has a center, a hole (61) and an inner surface (60). Data such as text files, movies, music or the like can be written to or read from the reading sector (54). The hole (52) is formed in the center of the base (6), corresponds to the through holes (52) in the compact disks (5) and allows compact disks (5) to be removed from the base (6) conveniently. The inner surface (60) is flat and faces up, and foreign matter such as dust and airborne debris easily drops on the inner surface (60). The reading sector (54) of the compact disk (5) that sits directly on the inner surface (60) rubs against the inner surface (60) and is damaged easily<br><br>
by rubbing against the inner surface (60) and especially by foreign matter on the inner surface (60).<br>
The present invention provides a base of disk case to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned shortcomings. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a compact disk case base that keeps a compact disk on the bottom from scraping and being damaged by contact with the base.<br>
To achieve the objective, a compact disk case base in accordance with the present invention holds compact disks that individually have a through hole, a non-reading sector, a reading sector and a boundary between the non-reading and reading sectors, keeps the reading sector of a disk from rubbing against the base and has a closed bottom, an inner support segment and an outer segment. The closed bottom is circular, collects any airborne matter that may settle on the base and has a center, a through hole, an outer edge, an inner edge and an upper surface. The through hole is formed through the center of the base and corresponds to the through hole in a CD. The inner edge is formed around the through hole. The inner support segment is circular, supports the non-reading sector of a CD, is mounted on and protrudes up from the upper surface of the closed bottom and has a height. The outer segment is formed on and protrudes up from the upper surface of the closed bottom outside the inner support segment and has a height. The height of the outer segment is lower than the height of the inner support segment so the reading sector of the compact disk will not contact to the outer segment of the base.<br><br>
Other objectives, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a compact disk case base in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is an operational perspective view of the compact disk case base in Fig. 1 with a compact disk (CD);<br>
Fig. 3 is an operational side view of the compact disk case base in Fig.l with multiple CDs stacked on the compact disk case base;<br>
Fig. 4 is a side view of the compact disk case base in Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 5 is top view of the compact disk case base in Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 6 is an operational perspective view of a conventional compact disk case base in accordance with the prior art with a compact disk (CD). DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to Fig. 1 and 2, a compact disk case base in accordance with the present invention holds compact disks (5) individually comprising a through hole (52), a non-reading sector (51), a reading sector (54) and a boundary (53) between the non-reading sector (51) and the reading sector (54) and having a diameter. The compact disk case base is circular, may be made of plastic or acryl and has a closed bottom (20), an inner support segment (30) and an outer segment (40).<br>
With further reference to Fig. 3, the closed bottom (20) is circular, collects any airborne matter that may settle on the compact disk case base and<br><br>
has a central through hole (21), an outer edge, an inner edge, an inner surface (22) and a central post (23). The central through hole (21) is formed through the closed bottom (20) and corresponds to the through hole (52) in a compact disk (5). The inner edge coincides with the central through hole (21). The inner surface (22) is flat and collects any airborne matter that falls on the compact disk case base. The central post (23) is mounted in and protrudes up from the central through hole (21) and holds CDs (5) in position when the through holes (52) are mounted around the central post (23).<br>
The inner support segment (30) is mounted on and protrudes up from the inner surface (22) of the closed bottom (20) concentrically around the central through hole (21) and has a height, an inner ring (31), an outer ring (32) and multiple optional inner ribs (33).<br>
The inner ring (31) is mounted on and protrudes up from the inner edge of the closed bottom (20).<br>
The outer ring (32) is mounted on and protrudes up from the inner surface (22) of the closed bottom (20) concentrically around the inner ring (31) and has a diameter. The diameter is shorter than the diameter of the boundary (53) of the compact disk (5), so the inner support segment (30) only makes contact with the non-reading sector (51) of the disk (5). Consequently, the reading sector (54) of the compact disk (5) is suspended and will not be scraped by contact with the inner surface or foreign matter on the outer segment (40).<br>
The inner ribs (33) are mounted radially on and protrude up from the inner surface (22) of the closed bottom (20) between the inner ring (31) and the outer ring (32).<br><br>
With further reference to Fig. 4, the outer segment (40) is formed on and protrudes up from the inner surface (22) of the closed bottom (20) concentrically around the inner support segment (30) and has a height being lower than the height of inner support segment (30), a mounting lip (41) and multiple outer ribs (42).<br>
The mounting lip (41) may engage and hold a cover on the compact disk case base and is formed on and protrudes up from the inner surface (22) of the closed bottom (20) at the outer edge.<br>
With further reference to Fig. 5, the outer ribs (42) are mounted radially on and protrude up from the inner surface (22) of the closed bottom (20) between the outer ring (32) and the mounting lip (41) and may be formed integrally with the inner ribs (33).<br>
Because the height of the outer segment (40) is lower than the height of the inner support segment (30), the reading sector (54) of the compact disk (5) will not contact the close bottom (20) of the outer segment (40) to keep the compact disk (5) from scraping and being damaged.<br>
Even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only. Changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</td>
