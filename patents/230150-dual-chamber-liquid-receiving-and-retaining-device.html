				<td>DUAL-CHAMBER LIQUID RECEIVING AND RETAINING DEVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The present invention relates to the general field of devices for collecting<br>
and separately containing dual samples of a liquid, more particularly to the<br>
collection and separately containing of dual samples of body fluids, and still<br>
more particularly to the collection and separate containing of dual samples of<br>
urine for analysis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Circumstances often arise wherein a desire or necessity exists for the<br>
collection and separate containment of samples of a liquid. As one example,<br>
bacterial urinalysis typically requires the collection of a flow of what is generally<br>
termed "mid-stream" urine, as described below.<br>
The best mid-stream urine specimen for bacteriologic diagnostic<br>
examination is obtained directly from a patient's urinary bladder by<br>
catheterization, or by following a very rigorous 10-step body cleaning technique<br>
using various antiseptic agents presently available in wide varieties of mid-<br>
stream urinary collection systems. Generally, these tedious and highly<br>
intimidating cleaning procedures are not strictly followed due to ignorance or<br>
non-acceptance, especially by younger female patients.<br>
Added to the facts of inadequacy in the cleaning process and heretofore<br>
unavailability of a competent collection system capable of capturing and isolate<br>
the mid-stream urinary specimen, a high incidences of "false positive" diagnostic<br>
results has always remained a pit-fall in clinical urinary tract infection<br>
management.<br><br>
The initial part of a patient's urinary flow is called<br>
fore-stream urine. In females, in particular, this fore-<br>
stream urine, while flowing through a poorly cleaned<br>
external urogenital tract, is always regarded as<br>
contaminated and unsuitable for urinalysis, especially for<br>
microbiological or bacteriological examination. More often<br>
than not, the fore-stream urine contaminants produce a high<br>
incidence of false positive lab test results that are<br>
unfortunately derived from external contaminants located<br>
around the external urogenital anatomic parts. These<br>
apparently "innocent" false contaminants are dragged along<br>
the apparently clean urinary stream from the bladder during<br>
its excretion process. When this unintentionally<br>
contaminated fore-stream urine, while "rinsing" through the<br>
patient's urogenital pathway, is collected in a conventional<br>
single chamber collection container and then mixes with the<br>
later cleaner, mid-stream sample, such badly mixed mid-<br>
stream sample is regarded as unsuitable or unacceptable for<br>
lab diagnosis procedures.<br>
A problem associated with such mid-stream urine<br>
collection is the assuring of an appropriate cleansing fore-<br>
stream urine flow (which is not used for the bacteriological<br>
analysis) . If the fore-stream urine flow is too small, it<br>
will result in inadequate rinsing of the urogenital pathway,<br>
and the subsequently collected mid-stream urine flow may be<br>
contaminated, thereby adversely affecting the bacterial<br>
urinalysis. On the other hand, if the fore-stream urine<br>
flow is too large, the patient may produce a mid-stream<br>
urine flow quantitatively insufficient for urinalysis<br>
purposes (typically 6 ml to 12 ml required).<br>
Heretofore, to the knowledge of the present inventors,<br>
the most commonly used mid-stream urine collection procedure<br><br>
requires that the patient continuously urinate into a<br>
commode (or other receptacle) an amount of about 3 0 ml to 50<br>
ml of urine (which will be discarded) esL... ted as<br>
sufficient to rinse the anatomical pathway and provide a<br>
cleaner specimen for the required uncontaminated mid-stream<br>
urine flow, and then finish urinating into a container to<br>
collect the subsequent urine flow for analysis. In such a<br>
procedure, the amount of discharged fore-stream urine is<br>
usually difficult to control for females, and if too small,<br>
may result, in a contaminated mid-stream urine flow and if<br>
too large may result in too small a mid-stream urine flow<br>
for accurate biological analysis. Moreover, such a<br>
procedure involves the patient uninterrupting her (or his)<br>
urine flow to collect the mid-stream flowâ€”something that<br>
may be difficult for collecting the mid-stream urine flow.<br>
In any event, such a procedure may result in unintended,<br>
unsanitary urination onto the patient's hand and/or the<br>
urine collection container.<br>
Therefore, it is highly desirable to provide a device<br>
which automatically collects, as a first sample, a<br>
predetermined amount of fore-stream urine flow and then<br>
automatically collects, as a second, separate sample, a mid-<br>
stream urine flow. It is further important that the<br>
collection device completely isolates the second, clean mid-<br>
stream urine sample from the first fore-stream urine sample<br>
to prevent contamination of the mid-stream urine sample.<br>
Another example of the need for collecting two<br>
contemporary separate urine samples from the same ."dividual<br>
is for drug testing of the individual. Particularly when<br>
legal issues are or may be involved, two contemporaneous<br>
samples of urine from an individual being drug tested are<br>
usually desired, if not legally required. A first one of<br><br>
these urine samples is used for on spot drug testing; the<br>
second one of the urine samples is (or should be) maintained<br>
in a tamper-proof, preserved condition for subsequent drug<br>
testing in the event the on spot drug testing results are<br>
contested, for example, in a legal dispute, and a second<br>
drug test is required.<br>
It is, therefore, a principal objective of the present<br>
invention to provide a dual liquid, particularly urine,<br>
sample receiving and retaining device, in which the two<br>
samples are isolated from one another.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A dual-chamber liquid receiving and retaining device<br>
comprises a liquid receiving and retaining body having a<br>
continuous outside wall, an open top and an open bottom; and<br>
includes a detachable top cover and a detachable bottom<br>
cover for the body. The device body, which is preferably<br>
generally cylindrical in shape, is formed having a generally<br>
funnel-shaped transverse inner wall that divides the body<br>
into upper and lower liquid receiving and retaining<br>
chambers, the transverse inner wall tapering downwardly<br>
toward an orifice which enables liquid flow communication<br>
between the upper and lower chambers. Preferably an annular<br>
depending locking flange surrounding the orifice has a<br>
narrow inner annular locking recess.<br>
An orifice stopper disposed in the lower chamber, is<br>
responsive to liquid filling the lower chamber to a<br>
predetermined level that causes the stopper to float<br>
upwardly into sealing engagement with the orifice to thereby<br>
prevent further liquid flow into the lower chamber. The<br>
stopper is preferably formed having a narrow external<br>
annular bead shaped to latch into the locking flange annular<br><br>
recess when the stopper is tightly received into the<br>
orifice. The orifice is circular in shape and is centrally<br>
located in the transverse wall, and the stopper is formed<br>
having an upper, conical orifice-sealing region.<br>
It is preferred that the stopper be formed having an<br>
outwardly flared circular skirt region. A ring-shaped float<br>
having a height selected to provide the predetermined liquid<br>
level in the lower chamber is preferably disposed beneath<br>
the stopper circular skirt region for providing floating<br>
stability to the stopper.<br>
The device body preferably includes a narrow bead<br>
around the outside thereof adjacent the open bottom, the<br>
bottom cover being configured to snap upwardly over this<br>
body bead for attachment of the bottom cover to the body.<br>
Also preferably included is a bottom cover locking ring<br>
sized to fit over the bottom cover and configured, in<br>
conjunction with configuration of the body, for threadable<br>
attachment to the body for locking the bottom cover tightly<br>
to the body.<br>
A variation device includes an adapter for diverting a<br>
strong stream of liquid being received into the device<br>
through the open top in a manner which might otherwise<br>
prevent the stopper from sealing firmly into the orifice<br>
when liquid received into the lower chamber floats the<br>
stopper into the orifice. The diverting adapter includes an<br>
attachment member removably attached to the open top of the<br>
device body in lieu of the top cover. A dome-shaped element<br>
attached to attachment member is located directly above the<br>
stopper when said member is attached to the device body and<br>
when the stopper is floated into the orifice by liquid<br>
received into the lower chamber, the dome-shaped element<br>
being shaped to divert the strong stream of liquid being<br><br>
received into the device onto a region of the transverse<br>
wall surrounding the orifice. The attachment member includes<br>
a handle and means for detachably attaching the handle to<br>
the attachment member.<br>
Means are preferably included for forcing the stopper<br>
into a tight sealing relationship with the orifice so as to<br>
assure that liquid does not leak between the upper and lower<br>
chambers.<br>
In one case, the stopper forcing means include an<br>
annular, spring-like, flexible web formed in the bottom<br>
cover around a downwardly extending bottom cover region, web<br>
being responsive to a downward pushing on the device onto<br>
the downwardly extending bottom cover region for deflecting<br>
upwardly in a manner causing a central upstanding region of<br>
the bottom cover to engage the stopper and force the stopper<br>
upwardly into the orifice and latch the stopper external<br>
annular bead into the locking flange annular recess for<br>
tightly sealing the orifice against liquid leakage past the<br>
stopper. When the web deflects upwardly to cause said bottom<br>
cover upstanding region to force the stopper tightly into<br>
the orifice and latch the stopper external annular bead into<br>
the locking flange annular recess, the web locks over-center<br>
to positively lock the stopper into the orifice and latch<br>
the stopper external annular bead into the locking flange<br>
annular recess so as to assure that liquid does not leak<br>
past the stopper between the upper and lower chambers.<br>
There is preferably provided a bottom cover extension<br>
which is sized for attachment to the downwardly extending<br>
bottom cover region, and sized to provide a larger device<br>
body footprint and an additional height to the downwardly<br>
extending bottom cover region so as to assure the over-<br>
center locking of the web.<br><br>
A variation dual-chamber device includes a spring<br>
disposed in the lower chamber beneath the stopper that is<br>
held in a compressed condition by a fiber disc. The disc is<br>
responsive to contact by an aqueous liquid received into the<br>
lower chamber for a preestablished length of time, which is<br>
preferably at least about 2 0 seconds, that softens the disc<br>
sufficiently to release the spring from its compressed<br>
condition so as to engage the stopper and force the stopper<br>
upwardly into the orifice and latch the stopper external<br>
annular bead into the locking flange annular recess for<br>
tightly sealing the orifice and to positively lock zhe<br>
stopper into the orifice and latch the stopper external<br>
annular bead into the locking flange annular recess so as to<br>
assure that liquid does not leak past the stopper between<br>
the upper and lower chambers.<br>
Another variation dual-chamber device includes an<br>
aqueous liquid, highly expandable, hydrophilic element<br>
disposed in the lower chamber beneath the stopper. The<br>
hydrophilic element is responsive to contact by an aqueous<br>
liquid received into the lower chamber for causing the-<br>
element to greatly expand into contact with the stopper and<br>
force the stopper upwardly into the orifice and latch the<br>
stopper external annular bead into the locking flange<br>
annular recess for tightly sealing the orifice and to<br>
positively lock the stopper into the orifice and the latch<br>
the stopper external annular bead into the locking flange<br>
annular recess so as to assure that liquid does not leak<br>
past the stopper between the upper and lower chambers.<br>
In still another dual-chamber device variation the<br>
stopper forcing means includes an aqueous liquid-soluble<br>
effervescent tablet disposed in the lower chamber beneath<br>
the stopper. The effervescent tablet is responsive to<br><br>
contact by an aqueous liquid received into the lower chamber<br>
for providing a large quantity of gaseous bubbles rising to<br>
contact the stopper and thereby force the stopper upwardly<br>
into the orifice and latch the stopper external annular bead<br>
into the locking flange annular recess for tightly sealing<br>
the orifice.<br>
An a further variation dual-chamber device, the stopper<br>
forcing means includes a secondary bottom cover having a<br>
central region extending upwardly through the bottom cover,<br>
the central region having an elongate, upstanding stopper<br>
engaging pin. A removable spacer is disposed between the<br>
bottom cover and the secondary bottom cover to maintain<br>
device pre-use separation therebetween. Post-use weight of<br>
the device and liquid contained therein causing, when the<br>
spacer is removed, causes the secondary bottom cover pin to<br>
move upwardly to force the stopper into the orifice and<br>
latch the stopper external annular bead into the locking<br>
flange annular recess for tightly sealing the orifice.<br>
After the spacer is removed and the secondary bottom cover<br>
pin forces the stopper tightly into the orifice and latches<br>
the stopper external annular bead into the locking flange<br>
annular recess, and the device is pressed downwardly onto<br>
the secondary bottom cover, the secondary bottom cover is<br>
caused to snap upwardly over the bottom cover to c?.use the<br>
secondary bottom cover pin to positively lock the stopper<br>
into the orifice and latch the stopper external annular bead<br>
into the locking flange annular recess, so as to assure that<br>
liquid does not leak past the stopper between said upper and<br>
lower chambers.<br>
The stopper forcing means of yet another variation<br>
dual-chamber device includes a magnetic element fixed to the<br>
stopper and another magnetic element fixed to the<br><br>
transverse wall adjacent the orifice, and includes a<br>
removable spacer disposed between the stopper and the<br>
orifice to prevent device pre-use magnetic attraction of the<br>
stopper into the orifice, and wherein as liquid is<br>
introduced into the lower chamber to an extent floating the<br>
stopper upwardly into the orifice, the stopper is<br>
magnetically pulled tightly into the orifice and the stopper<br>
external annular bead is latched into the locking flange<br>
annular recess by the magnetic elements for tightly sealing<br>
the orifice. When the stopper is magnetically pulled<br>
tightly into the orifice and the stopper external annular<br>
bead is latched into the locking flange annular recess, the<br>
magnetic elements positively lock the stopper into the<br>
orifice and latch the stopper external annular bead into the<br>
locking flange annular recess so as to assure that liquid<br>
does not leak past the stopper between the upper and lower<br>
chambers.<br>
In a further variation dual-chamber device, an aqueous<br>
liquid-activated adhesive is applied to the transverse wall<br>
around the orifice and a removable spacer is disposed<br>
between the stopper and the orifice to prevent device pre-<br>
use adhering of the stopper into the orifice. As liquid is<br>
introduced into the lower chamber so as to float the stopper<br>
upwardly into the orifice, the adhesive is activated,<br>
thereby positively locking the stopper into the orifice so<br>
as to assure that liquid does not leak past the stopper<br>
between the upper and lower chambers.<br>
In a still further dual-chamber device variation means<br>
are provided for diverting a strong stream of liquid being<br>
received into the device through the open top thereof so as<br>
to prevent the stopper from sealing firmly into the orifice<br>
when liquid received into the lower chamber floats the<br><br>
stopper into the orifice. The diverting means includes an<br>
attachment member removably attachable to the open top of<br>
the device body in lieu of the top cover, and a dome-shaped<br>
element attached to the attachment member in a position to<br>
be directly above the stopper when the member is attached to<br>
the device body and when the stopper is floated into the<br>
orifice by liquid received into the lower chamber. The<br>
dome-shaped element is shaped to divert the strong stream of<br>
liquid being received into the device onto a region of the<br>
transverse wall surrounding the orifice. Included is a<br>
handle and means for detachably attaching the handle to the<br>
attachment member.<br>
It is preferred that the device body be constructed of<br>
a rigid plastic material which comprises a high density<br>
polypropylene, and that the upper and lower chambers have<br>
respective volumes of about 80 ml and about 100 ml for use<br>
of the device for urine collection.<br>
In general, there is included an elongate handle and<br>
means for detachable attachment of the handle to an upper<br>
region of the container outside wall so that the handle-<br>
projects outwardly therefrom in a generally radial<br>
direction, the handle being formed having a gripping region<br>
that angles upwardly and outwardly when the handle is<br>
attached to the container outside wall.<br>
In any version of the dual-chamber device there may be<br>
included an elastomeric member installed in the container<br>
outside wall in the region of the lower chamber, the<br>
elastomeric member being puncturable by a hypodermic needle<br>
so as to permit the removal of liquid from the lower<br>
chamber. The elastomeric element is self-sealing after a<br>
hypodermic needle is withdrawn therefrom, and there is<br>
preferably included a cover securely covering the<br><br>
elastomeric element, the cover being detachable from the elastomeric element,<br>
but not reattachable thereto after removal, thereby providing a visual indication<br>
that liquid in the lower chamber may have been tampered with.<br>
A pressure relieving means may be provided in order to vent air from the<br>
lower chamber so as to prevent pressure-caused bleeding of liquid from the<br>
lower chamber into the upper chamber. The pressure relieving means may<br>
include a pinhole formed through a side wall of the device body into the lower<br>
chamber above the predetermined liquid level, the pinhole preferably having a<br>
diameter between above 0.01 mm and about 0.1 mm.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT:<br>
There is shown in FIG. 1 a dual-chamber, liquid<br>
receiving and containing device 100 (hereinafter, for the<br><br>
sake of brevity, usually referred to as the "dual-chamber<br>
device") which may advantageously be used to receive a flow<br>
of urine from a patient and contain the urine flow as<br>
separate fore-stream and mid-stream flow portions, as<br>
described below.<br>
Shown comprising dual-chamber device 100, more<br>
particularly described below, are a generally cylindrical<br>
device body or liquid cup 102, a top cover or cap 104 that<br>
is detachably attached at an open upper end of the body, a<br>
bottom cover or cap 10 6 that is attached to an open bottom<br>
of the body, a bottom cover locking ring 108 that is<br>
threaded onto the body to secure the bottom cover to the<br>
body (as discussed below) , and an angled handle 110 that is<br>
detachably attached to the body by a tapered fitting 112<br>
projecting from upper regions of the body. Shown adjacent<br>
fitting 112 is a microscopic pressure relief hole 120 that<br>
extends through a device body outer wall 124 at the highest<br>
point or lower chamber 144 so as to be as high as possible<br>
above liquid collected in the lower chamber. Hole 120<br>
(which is shown greatly exaggerated- in size in all relevant<br>
FIGS, for purposes of clarity) may be between about 0.01 mm<br>
and about 0.05 mm in diameter.<br>
Top cover 104 is shown in FIG. 2 as having an annular<br>
device sealing recess or groove 116. Handle 110 is shown in<br>
FIG. 3 as having, at a distal end, an attachment region 118<br>
shaped and sized to fit upwardly onto body fitting 112 (FIG.<br>
4) in a tapered tongue and groove manner. When dual-chamber<br>
device 100 (and below-described variations thereof) is used<br>
to collect fore-stream and mud-stream urine samples, handle<br>
110 is especially shaped for ergonomically convenient and<br>
effective use by female patients for easy accessibility<br>
during urine sample collection. As such, handle 110<br><br>
preferably has an overall length, L1, that may be about 4.5<br>
inches and has a generally central bend, a, that may be<br>
about 45 degrees; moreover, in combination, handle<br>
attachment region 118 and device body fitting 112 mount the<br>
handle at an upward angle, (3, of about 3 0 degrees (FIG. 1) .<br>
Fig. 5 shows a top view of device body 102, which may<br>
be constructed of a rigid plastic material, such as high<br>
density polypropylene, and may be either transparent,<br>
translucent or opaque. As shown in the vertical cross<br>
section of FIGS. 6 and 6a device body 102 is formed having<br>
an outside wall 124 with a height, H1, which may, for urine<br>
specimen collection, be about 3.5 inches; an open, top 126<br>
having an outside diameter, D1 that may be about 2.5- inches<br>
and an open bottom 128 having an outside diameter, D2, that<br>
may be about 2.25 inches. Body wall 124 may have a<br>
thickness, T1, that is about 0.05 inches.<br>
A first, externally threaded top cover receiving region<br>
130 is formed on body wall 124 below-adjacent open top 126<br>
and a second, externally threaded bottom lock ring receiving<br>
region 132 is formed on the body wall above-adjacent open<br>
bottom 128. An external annular bead 134 is formed around<br>
body wall 124 at bottom open end 128.<br>
Formed internally across device outer wall 124 is a<br>
funnel-shaped transverse inner wall 140 that divides device<br>
body 102 into respective upper and lower chambers " 142 and<br>
144 having respective volumes for urine collection of about<br>
80 ml and about 100 ml. A central, circular orifice 146 in<br>
transverse inner wall 14 0 is defined by a depending<br>
peripheral orifice ring 14 8 having an entrance opening of<br>
diameter, D3, that may be about 0.80 inches, the orifice<br>
ring being conically-shaped, that is, is slightly enlarged<br>
toward lower chamber 144.<br><br>
A narrow colored ring 136 on an outside surface 138 of<br>
body wall 124 below-adjacent first threaded region 130 is<br>
provided as a visual "full" guide when introducing liquid<br>
into upper chamber 142.<br>
Depending from transverse inner wall 140 and<br>
surrounding orifice ring 148, and extending therebelow, is a<br>
stopper securing ring 150 having outer diameter, that<br>
may be about 1.25 inches. A narrow, shallow inner annular<br>
stopper latching groove or recess 152 is formed around<br>
stopper securing ring 148 above-adjacent a stopper securing<br>
ring lower edge 156.<br>
A buoyant orifice stopper 160, shown in FIGS. 7-9,<br>
comprises a hollow, upper, conically-shaped orifice sealing<br>
region 162 and a lower, radially-flared skirt region 164,<br>
and has an overall height, H2, that may be about 1.25<br>
inches. Orifice sealing region 162 is shaped and sized to<br>
fit closely into above-described orifice ring 148 to thereby<br>
seal orifice 146. Surrounding a lower region of orifice<br>
sealing region 162 is an annular locking bead 166 that is<br>
shaped and sized to fit closely into stopper securing ring<br>
annular locking groove 152 (also described above). Forming<br>
part of orifice stopper 160 is a depending guide or pushing<br>
column 168. Formed around a lower region of guide or column<br>
168 is an annular latching ring 170 of saw-tooth shape<br>
(FIGS. 7 and 8).<br>
As shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, several (six being shown)<br>
internal stiffeners 172 are provided for imparting rigidity<br>
to orifice sealing region 162. Stopper 160 is preferably<br>
constructed from the same rigid plastic material as device<br>
body 102. Orifice stopper skirt 164 preferably has an<br>
outside diameter, D5, at a lower skirt peripheral edge 174,<br><br>
which may be about 0.59 inches. Column 168 has ar outside<br>
diameter, D6, that may be about 1.97 inches.<br>
An annular orifice stopper float 180, shown in FIGS.<br>
10-12, is preferably constructed from a closed cell<br>
polystyrene foam so as to be buoyant. Float 180 is shaped<br>
and sized to fit upwardly under orifice stopper skirt region<br>
164 to provide buoyancy to orifice stopper 160, as described<br>
below. For such purpose, float 180 has an diameter, D7, of<br>
an inner surface 182, that may be about 1.0 inch, so as to<br>
fit loosely over orifice stopper guide or column 168 and an<br>
outside diameter, D8, of an outer surface 184, that may be<br>
about 1.57_inches so as to fit loosely under orifice stopper<br>
skirt region 164. An upper peripheral region 186 of float<br>
180 is beveled at about 45 degrees so that the float fits<br>
under orifice stopper skirt region 164. Float 180 has a<br>
thickness, T2, that may, for example, be about 0.39 inch,<br>
but is selected according to the desired liquid containing<br>
volume of lower chamber 144 (FIG. 6). Float 180 functions to<br>
raise orifice stopper 160 into engagement with orifice 146<br>
even when device body 102 is tilted, according to patient<br>
skill while discharging urine (or other liquid) into lower<br>
chamber 144, even though the orifice stopper is itself<br>
generally buoyant.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 13-17, bottom cover 106, which has an<br>
overall height, H3, which may be about 1.06 inches,<br>
comprises a rigid, upwardly-recessed, central bottom base<br>
190 having a diameter, D9, which may be about 1.18 inches.<br>
Central bottom base 190 is surrounded by a thin, flexible,<br>
upwardly-arched annular web 192 that has spring-like<br>
properties and that extends a distance, d1 that may be<br>
about 0.63 inch above a bottom base lower surface 194.<br>
Radial outer end of web 192 terminate in an annular,<br><br>
upwardly-extending first devise body attachment flange 196,<br>
having an inwardly facing bead 198; and an annular,<br>
upwardly-extending second devise body sealing flange 200.<br>
Projecting upwardly from bottom base is an orifice stopper<br>
guide 208. Formed around the inside of guide 208 is a saw-<br>
toothed latching ring 210 that is shaped in a complimentary<br>
manner relative to orifice stopper latching ring 17 0 (FIGS 7<br>
and 8) . An outside diameter, D10, of guide 2 08 may be about<br>
0.75 inch.<br>
Bottom cover 106 is shown, in a side view, in FIGS. 15-<br>
17 attached to device body 102 (shown in phantom lines) ,<br>
FIG. 15 showing bottom cover 106 with annular web 192 in its<br>
un-compressed condition. FIG. 16 shows bottom cover 106<br>
with web 192 (not shown) in its compressed condition.<br>
achieved by pressing downwardly on the bottom cover that is<br>
resting on a rigid surface 211 until base region 190 is no<br>
longer visible. FIG. 17 is a vertical cross sectional<br>
drawing (corresponding to FIG. 14, and derived from FIG. 16)<br>
showing bottom cover web 192 flexed into its over-center<br>
locking condition as a result of bottom cover 106 being<br>
pushed downwardly onto surface 211, thereby pushing orifice<br>
stopper 160 upwardly into tight sealing relationship with<br>
orifice 146, including "latching" stopper locking bead 166<br>
into orifice locking recess 152, and positively locking the<br>
stopper into the orifice to assure no liquid leakage occurs<br>
between upper and lower chambers 142 and 144.<br>
Bottom cover 106 is preferably constructed of a<br>
relatively high density polypropylene that is less rigid<br>
than device body 102 so that web 192 can flex in the manner<br>
described above. Because of the relative flexibility of<br>
bottom cover 106, the unlikely possibility exists that an<br>
offset pushing of the bottom cover (that is, device 100) to<br><br>
flex web 192 into its over-center locking condition, to<br>
thereby force stopper 160 tightly into orifice 146 and lock<br>
it there (as above-described, some region of bottom cover<br>
flange 196 might be dislodged from device body annular bead<br>
134 sufficiently to permit liquid leakage from lower chamber<br>
144. To prevent this remote possibility, bottom cover<br>
locking ring 108, which is made of the same rigid plastic<br>
material as device body 102, is tightly threaded onto the<br>
device body threaded region 132 to lock bottom cover 106 to<br>
the device body.<br>
FIRST VARIATION DUAL-CHAMBER DEVICE 100a:<br>
A first variation dual-chamber device 100a, depicted in<br>
disassembled, ordered form in FIG. 18, comprises above<br>
described dual-chamber body 102, top cover 104, bottom cover<br>
106, bottom cover locking ring 108, handle 110, orifice<br>
stopper 160, orifice stopper float 180, a top cover sealing<br>
ring 212, a bottom cover locking ring/ bottom cover sealing<br>
ring 214 and a orifice stopper sealing ring 216. Sealing<br>
rings 212, 214 and .216 are preferably constructed from .<br>
rubber (for example, neoprene) or an elastomeric plastic<br>
(for example, silicone).<br>
To the above extent previously-discussed dual-chamber<br>
device 100 is identical to above-described dual-chamber<br>
device 100a, except that included in, and forming the<br>
distinguishing feature of, dual-chamber device 100a is a<br>
circular bottom cover extension member 220 that fit? onto<br>
central bottom cover base 190 to provide additional bottom<br>
cover height (defined below). Extension member 220<br>
comprises an annular, upwardly-extending attachment flange<br>
222 sized for attaching the member to bottom cover central<br>
base 190. An inner surface 223 of flange 222 has a<br><br>
curvature matching the curvature of bottom cover web 192.<br>
Flange 222 is preferably colored red for easy visibility.<br>
Forming part of member 220 is an enlarged, flat circular<br>
support plate region 224 which provides dual-chamber device<br>
100a with a larger "foot print" on surface 211 than that<br>
provided by central bottom cover base 190, and which assures<br>
over-center locking of bottom cover web 192 and consequent<br>
locking of orifice stopper 160 into orifice 146, as<br>
described below. Support plate 224 is formed having a<br>
relatively thin, narrow annular, peripheral latching region<br>
226 which mates with bottom cover locking ring 108, also as<br>
more particularly described below. Support plate region 224<br>
has a central opening 225 that enables extension member 220<br>
to fit upwardly onto bottom cover region 190.<br>
Also shown in FIG. 18, for the first time, is a<br>
threaded region 230 on the inside of top cover 104 into<br>
which sealing ring 212 is received, and a similar threaded<br>
region 232 on the inside of bottom cover locking ring 108<br>
into which sealing ring 214 is received. Top cover threaded<br>
region 230 mates with threaded region 130 on device body 102<br>
and bottom cover locking ring threaded region 232 mates with<br>
threaded region 13 2 on the device body. As shown in FIG.<br>
19, bottom cover locking ring 108 has a central aperture 240<br>
with a diameter, D11, which may be about 2.09 inches. And a<br>
diameter, D12, to flaps 241, that may be about 1.97 inches.<br>
Dual-chamber device 100a is shown in FIG. 20 in its<br>
fully assembled, pre-use condition. Bottom cover extension<br>
support plate region 224 is shown to have diameter, D13.<br>
Bottom cover extension 22 0 provides a distance, d2, from<br>
surface 211 to bottom cover locking ring 108, which may be<br>
about 0.55 inch, and which is greater than above-described<br>
bottom cover height, d1 (FIG. 14) . This distance, d2,<br><br>
represents the total amount of flexing of bottom cover web<br>
192 when dual-chamber device 100a is pressed downwardly onto<br>
surface 211 as shown in FIG. 21, which depicts the post-use<br>
condition of the dual-chamber device. In this regard, the<br>
red color of bottom cover extension region 222 is no longer<br>
visible when device 100a is in the post-use, compressed<br>
condition depicted in FIG. 21.<br>
Dual-chamber device 100a is shown, in vertical cross<br>
section in FIG. 22, in its fully assembled, pre-use<br>
condition with top cover 104 removed, and thus corresponds<br>
to FIG. 20 without the top cover. Orifice stopper 160,<br>
with orifice stopper seal 216 attached thereto below-<br>
adjacent stopper region 162, is shown in its lowermost<br>
position, below orifice 146 and resting on bottom cover<br>
guide column 210. Float ring 180 is shown in its lowermost<br>
position resting on bottom cover web 192. Bottom cover seal<br>
214 is shown installed in bottom cover locking ring 108,<br>
threaded region 232 of which is shown treaded onto device<br>
body threaded region 132.<br>
In the vertical cross sectional drawing of FIG. 23, 23a<br>
which is similar to FIG. 22, but represents a subsequent<br>
operational stage of dual-chamber device 100a, liquid 250,<br>
such as a patient's urine, is shown being discharged into<br>
upper chamber 142 of device body 102, lower chamber 144<br>
being shown already filled with the liquid (urine) which has<br>
caused float 180 to push orifice stopper 160 upwardly so<br>
that stopper region 162 is pushed into sealing relationship<br>
with orifice 146, whereupon the liquid has then started<br>
filling upper chamber 142. Assuming that device 100a is used<br>
for the collection of a patient's urine for bacteriological<br>
analysis, urine 252 contained in lower chamber 144 should<br>
constitute fore-stream urine, the lower chamber having<br><br>
sufficient volume to assure that urine 254 being collected<br>
in upper chamber 142 will constitute uncontaminated mid-<br>
stream urine. An upper surface 253 of urine 2 52 coincides<br>
with the predetermined urine level in lower chamber 144 to<br>
which orifice stopper 160 is responsive for being floated<br>
upwardly into sealing engagement with orifice 146.<br>
Vertical support column 168 depending from orifice<br>
stopper skirt region 164 is telescopically received into the<br>
larger diameter guide column 208 extending upwardly from<br>
bottom cover 106. The upward movement of orifice stopper 160<br>
is thus perfectly guided and restricted within bottom cover<br>
guide column 208. At this point, bottom cover annular<br>
flexible web 192 remains in its device pre-use, unflexed<br>
condition.<br>
Orifice stopper locking ring 150 stabilizes stopper<br>
sealing region 162 as it is directed into orifice 146<br>
whenever device body 102 is tilted at different angles<br>
during its use. Therefore, irrespective of how each patient<br>
positions her (or his) device body 102 during the liquid<br>
(urine)collection process, the mechanical integrity of the .<br>
entire dual-chamber device 100 involving fore strear urine<br>
capturing, isolation, and precise orifice stopper sealing<br>
and closure, always remain constant and intact with the<br>
stabilizing action of float 180.<br>
In the vertical cross sectional drawing of FIGS. 24,<br>
24a which are similar to FIGS. 23, 23a dual-chamber device<br>
100a is shown in its post-use condition with top cover 104<br>
attached to device body 102 and with handle 110 removed from<br>
member 112. Device 100a is also shown pressed downwardly<br>
onto firm surface 211 so that bottom cover base region 190<br>
and bottom cover extension 220 are fully recessed into<br>
device body 102, which causes bottom cover column 210 to<br><br>
push orifice stopper 160 upwardly into tight sealing<br>
relationship with orifice 146 with stopper seal 216 forced<br>
in a sealing relationship against lower regions of orifice<br>
ring 148 and including "latching" stopper locking bead 166<br>
into orifice locking recess 152, and positively locking the<br>
stopper into the orifice to assure no liquid leakage occurs<br>
between upper and lower chambers 142 and 144. In this<br>
condition, colored bottom extension flange 222 will be<br>
hidden, thereby providing a visual indication that proper<br>
locking has occurred. At times, some nervous and less<br>
knowledgeable patients may leave dual-chamber device 100a<br>
unlocked. This red colored flange 222 will then be clearly<br>
visible to nursing and technician staffs and will<br>
immediately remind them to lock device 100a before<br>
transporting it to the analysis laboratory.<br>
The over-center locking of bottom cover web 192 which<br>
results, locks bottom cover 190 in its upward position<br>
shown, thereby securely locking orifice stopper 160 into<br>
orifice 146 (as described above) so that regardless of any<br>
rough handling of device 100a, no liquid 252 can leak from<br>
lower chamber 144 into liquid 254 held in upper chamber<br>
142. Bottom cover locking ring 108, with installed seal 111,<br>
prevents liquid leakage at the periphery of bottom cover 10 6<br>
that might occur if device 100a is not pressed squarely down<br>
onto surface 211 during the above-described locking process.<br>
As bottom cover base 190 with bottom cover extension 220<br>
attached thereto are retracted upwardly, as above described,<br>
bottom cover extension peripheral latching region 226 flexes<br>
downwardly to bypass bottom cover locking ring radial<br>
projections 241 adjacent central opening 240 and then<br>
projects outwardly thereover to help maintain bottom cover<br>
web 192 in its over-center locked condition.<br><br>
Assuming lower chamber liquid 252 is fore-stream urine<br>
and upper chamber liquid 254 is mid-stream urine, the upper<br>
chamber mid-stream urine would be used for bacteriological<br>
analysis, and device 100a still containing lower chamber<br>
fore-stream urine would then be discarded.<br>
It will be appreciated that when device 100a, or device<br>
100 (without bottom cove extension 220) is pushed downwardly<br>
to flex bottom cover web 192 and cause bottom cover central<br>
region pedestal 190 and bottom cover extension (for device<br>
100a) to be pushed upwardly into lower chamber 144, the<br>
lower chamber volume is decreased, causing a high air<br>
pressure in the lower chamber region above liquid 252. This<br>
high air pressure may be sufficient to cause bleeding of<br>
liquid 252 from lower chamber 144 past orifice stopper 160<br>
into upper chamber 142 and possible contamination of upper<br>
chamber liquid 254. Device body hole 120 is provided for<br>
venting air from lower chamber 144 to relieve pressure<br>
therein and thereby prevent any liquid 252 from bleeding<br>
past orifice stopper 160.<br>
In some situations it may, however, be necessary or<br>
desirable to have access to urine 252 in lower chamber 144<br>
after orifice stopper 160 (and variations thereof) has been<br>
locked into orifice 146, as described above. For example,<br>
when testing for drugs in an individual's urine it may be<br>
necessary, or required by law, to retain, in a tamperproof<br>
manner, a reserve or second portion of the individual's<br>
urine specimen. A spot drug test would be performed on<br>
urine 254 obtained from upper chamber 142, and the second<br>
urine 252 portion would be held locked (as described above)<br>
in lower chamber 144 until needed to verify the spot drug<br>
test results, should they be disputed or require<br>
verification.<br><br>
However, after orifice stopper 160 is locked into<br>
orifice 146 as described above, the stopper cannot be<br>
unlocked from the orifice without destroying device 100a.<br>
Therefore for drug testing use of dual-chamber device 100a<br>
(and other dual-chamber device variations, described<br>
herein) , as depicted in FIGS. 25 and 26, outer wall 13 8 of<br>
device body 102 in the region of lower chamber 144 would<br>
have installed therein a self-sealing syringe access port<br>
260 covered by a detachable metal or hard plastic protective<br>
cap 262 which is swaged or heat sealed in place. As shown<br>
in FIG. 26, after protective cap 262 is removed, it cannot<br>
be manually reattached, thereby assuring a tamper-proof<br>
specimen in lower chamber 144 and providing a visual<br>
indication that urine 252 in lower chamber 144 may already<br>
been accessed or possibly treated in some manner so as to<br>
adversely affect any drug testing of the urine. A syringe<br>
needle 264 is then inserted through port 260 and an attached<br>
syringe 266 is used to withdraw from lower chamber 144 a<br>
quantity of urine 252 that may be used for secondary drug<br>
testing.<br>
SECOND VARIATION DUAL-CHAMBER DEVICE 100b:<br>
The present inventors have determined that in some<br>
situations wherein a strong, torrential flow of liquid 250<br>
(for example, urine discharged from a female patient) into<br>
device upper chamber 142 and impinging on orifice stopper<br>
160 may possibly cause cocking of the stopper to the extent<br>
that proper orifice sealing is hindered when the stopper is<br>
floated up into orifice 146. As a result, it is within the<br>
scope of the present invention to provide a flow diverting<br>
and sanitary barrier adapter 270, as shown in FIGS. 27-31<br><br>
and which comprises part of a second variation dual-chamber<br>
device 10 0b.<br>
Shown comprising flow diverting and sanitary barrier<br>
adapter 270 are a peripheral mounting ring 272 and a central<br>
dome 2 74 supported from the mounting ring by equally spaced<br>
apart, slender, downwardly-angled beams 2 76 (four such beams<br>
being shown). A handle attachment fitting 112a is fixed to<br>
mounting ring 272 for receiving handle 110.<br>
As shown in FIG. 29, when flow diverting and sanitary<br>
barrier adapter 27 0 is snapped onto the upper edge of device<br>
body 102a, central dome 274 is located directly above<br>
orifice 146 and stopper 160. As depicted, an introduced<br>
urine flow 250 (shown in broken lines) flows downwardly<br>
around dome 274 and then onto transverse wall 14 0 and then<br>
downwardly onto side regions of stopper 160, the liquid flow<br>
being thereby reduced in force onto the stopper.<br>
Second variation dual-chamber device 10 0b is depicted<br>
in FIG. 31, showing handle 110 detachably attached to<br>
fitting 112b formed on diverter mounting ring 272. Except<br>
for sanitary barrier adapter 270 with attached handle 110,<br>
and except that device body 102a does not have handle<br>
fitting 112 attached thereto, dual-chamber device 100b is<br>
the same as above-described device 100a and is internally<br>
constructed and operates in the above-described manner of<br>
device 10 0a. After liquid has been discharged into body<br>
102a, adapter 270 with attached handle 110 is removed from<br>
device body 102a and is discarded. Adapter 270 also<br>
provides a sanitary barrier to maintain sterility of body<br>
102a against accidental contamination by contact with the<br>
patient's unclean external body regions. Top cover 104 is<br>
then threaded onto device body 102a to seal device 10 0b for<br>
subsequent urinalysis.<br><br>
THIRD VARIATION DUAL-CHAMBER DEVICE 100c:<br>
It will be appreciated that a locking of orifice stopper<br>
160 into orifice 146 (as described above for devices 100,<br>
100a and 100b) in a more automatic manner will, at least in<br>
some circumstances, be more desirable than the mechanical<br>
locking method described above which requires manually<br>
pushing down on dual-chamber device 100 or 100a to flex<br>
bottom cover web 192 into its over-center locking condition.<br>
To this end, there is disclosed in FIGS. 32-38 a<br>
spring-type orifice stopper locking assembly 280 for a third<br>
variation dual-chamber device 100c {FIGS, 35-37). As shown,<br>
locking assembly 280 comprises a relatively small,<br>
preferably cylindrical, housing 282 which includes an upper<br>
member 284 having a top 286" and a cylindrical side wall 288.<br>
A housing base 290 is threaded upwardly onto the bottom of<br>
side wall 288 (FIGS. 32-33). Housing 282 has a height at, H4,<br>
that may be about 0.31 inch.<br>
As best seen from FIG. 33, a relatively large,<br>
centrally-located aperture 292 is formed in housing top 286.<br>
A conically-shaped compression spring 294 is retained inside<br>
housing 282 by a circular member 296 fixed to housing base<br>
290, and is maintained in its compressed condition by a<br>
rigid, aqueous liquid-softenable, spring-retaining disc 298,<br>
which may be formed from a suitable fiber material, such as<br>
cardboard, that is positioned above compressed spring 294<br>
and directly beneath top aperture 292.<br>
Housing base 2 90, which has a diameter, D14, that may be<br>
about 0.63 inch, is formed with a central liquid entry<br>
aperture 300 and having a plurality of small, short feet 3 02<br>
that space locking assembly 280 upwardly from device bottom<br>
cover 106a so that liquid (urine) collected in lower chamber<br><br>
144 can enter housing 282 through base aperture 3 00 to<br>
soften spring-retaining disc 298 and release the compression<br>
of spring 294. An air vent 304 is provided in housing side<br>
wall 288. A groove 306 is provided in base lower surfece<br>
308 (FIG. 34) to receive a screw driver blade for<br>
facilitating screwing housing base 290 onto housing side<br>
wall 288.<br>
Shown in vertical cross section in FIGS. 35-37 third<br>
variation dual-chamber device 100c incorporates above-<br>
described spring-type orifice stopper locking assembly 280.<br>
Shown further comprising dual-chamber device 1000c is a<br>
device body 102b, a bottom cover 106a, an orifice stopper<br>
160a, float 180 and handle 110. Dual-chamber device 100c,<br>
for reasons described below, eliminates bottom cover locking<br>
ring 10 8 as unnecessary.<br>
Device body 102b is shown identical in all respects to<br>
above-described device body 102, except that a lower<br>
threaded region 132a is formed directly above a lower end of<br>
the device body for the threadable attachment of bottom<br>
cover 106a.<br>
Orifice stopper 160a is identical. in all respects to<br>
above-described orifice stopper 160 except that depending<br>
column 170a is shorter than column 170 shown in FIGS 7 and<br>
8, and is closed at a lower end 310. Bottom cover. 106a is<br>
similar to above-described bottom cover 106 (FIGS. 13-17),<br>
except that annular web 192 is eliminated, permitting a base<br>
194a to be entirely flat and extend entirely across device<br>
body 102b, and is formed having a peripheral internally<br>
threaded attachment region 312 that mates with device body<br>
threaded region 13 2a upon assembly of dual-chamber device<br>
100c.<br><br>
As shown in FIGS. 35-37, compressed spring orifice<br>
stopper locking assembly 280 is attached to an upper surface<br>
318 of bottom cover 106a inside column 208a and directly<br>
beneath orifice stopper closed lower end or bottom 310.<br>
Column 208a is formed having a plurality of vertical slits<br>
(not shown) to allow aqueous liquid access to locking<br>
assembly 280 and disc 298.<br>
In the pre-use condition of dual-chamber device 100c,<br>
depicted in FIG. 35, orifice stopper 160a is resting on top<br>
286 of locking assembly housing 282, and float 180 is<br>
resting on bottom cover upper surface 318.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 36, which corresponds to FIG. 35,<br>
but represents a subsequent operation or use stage of dual-<br>
chamber device 100c, liquid (urine) is being introduced into<br>
dual-chamber device 100c, having filled lower chamber 144 to<br>
the extent that orifice stopper 160a has been floated<br>
upwardly into sealing engagement with orifice 146,. and upper<br>
chamber 142 has subsequently been partially filled with<br>
liquid (urine) 154. At this depicted point in time, spring<br>
retaining disc 2 98 has not yet been sufficiently softened by<br>
aqueous liquid 152 in lower chamber 144 to release locking<br>
spring 294 from its shown compressed state.<br>
Preferably at least about 20 seconds of immersion in<br>
aqueous liquid (urine) is required to soften spring<br>
retaining disc 298 sufficiently for it to release spring<br>
294, which allows sufficient time for orifice stopper 160a<br>
to be floated upwardly into orifice 146 to stop liquid flow<br>
into lower chamber 144. This softening of spring-retaining<br>
disc 298, releases spring 294 which then expands and pushes<br>
the disc upwardly through housing opening 296 and expands<br>
further to push orifice stopper 160 upwardly into tight<br>
sealing relationship with orifice 146 with stopper seal 216<br><br>
forced in a sealing relationship against lower regions of<br>
orifice ring 148, and including "latching" stopper locking<br>
bead 166 into orifice locking recess 152, and positively<br>
locking the stopper into the orifice to assure no liquid<br>
leakage occurs between upper and lower chambers 142 and 144,<br>
as depicted in FIG. 37. FIG. 38 is an enlargement of region<br>
38 of FIG. 37 depicting the above-described actuation of<br>
spring-type orifice stopper locking assembly 180.<br>
It will be appreciated that the above-described tight<br>
locking of orifice stopper 160a into orifice 146 by orifice<br>
stopper locking assembly 280 is completely automatic and<br>
operates solely in response to liquid (urine) 154 billing<br>
device body lower chamber 144 without requiring any manual<br>
intervention.<br>
FOURTH VARIATION DUAL-CHAMBER DEVICE 1OOd:<br>
A fourth dual-chamber device lOOd is depicted in FIGS.<br>
39-40 which utilizes a quantity or element of highly-<br>
expandable, hydrophilic material capsule or element 330 to<br>
provide automatic locking of above-described orifice stopper<br>
160a into orifice 146, the process being otherwise similar,<br>
and comparable, to that described above for spring-type<br>
orifice stopper locking assembly 280 (FIGS. 35-38).<br>
As shown in the vertical cross sectional pre-use<br>
drawing of FIG. 39, expandable, hydrophilic material capsule<br>
or element 330 is disposed within orifice stopper column 170<br>
above bottom cover 106a and in contact with a transverse<br>
stopper closing member 332. Orifice stopper column 168a<br>
rests on hydrophilic material capsule 330 and float 180 is<br>
resting on bottom cover upper surface 318 of bottom cover<br>
106a.<br><br>
As depicted in the vertical cross sectional post-use<br>
drawing of FIG. 40 (which corresponds to FIG. 39), as<br>
aqueous liquid (urine) 252 fills lower chamber 144, the<br>
liquid flows through above-described openings in column 208a<br>
and contacts hydrophilic material capsule 330 causing the<br>
material to greatly expand (swell), thereby exerting an<br>
upward force on stopper bottom 310 to push orifice stopper<br>
160 upwardly into tight sealing relationship with orifice<br>
146 with stopper seal 216 forced in a sealing relationship<br>
against lower regions of orifice ring 148, and including<br>
"latching" stopper locking bead 166 into orifice locking<br>
recess 152, thereby positively locking the stopper into the<br>
orifice to assure no liquid leakage occurs between upper and<br>
lower chambers 142 and 144<br>
Again, as in the case of the spring-type orifice stopper<br>
locking assembly 280, the use of expandable, hydrophilic<br>
material capsule 330, provides for the automatic locking of<br>
orifice stopper 160b into orifice 146 solely in response to<br>
liquid (urine) 154 filling device body lower chamber 144<br>
without requiring any manual intervention.<br>
FIFTH VARIATION DUAL-CHAMBER DEVICE 100e:<br>
A fifth variation dual-chamber device 1OOe is depicted<br>
in FIGS. 41-43. Dual-chamber device lOOe utilizes a gas<br>
generator assembly 34 0 comprising an aqueous liquid-<br>
activated effervescent tablet or element 342 disposed in a<br>
cylindrical tablet housing 344 to achieve automatic locking<br>
of orifice stopper 160b into orifice 146. Dual-chamber<br>
device lOOe is similar in many respects to both above-<br>
described dual-chamber devices 100c and lOOd.<br>
As shown in the vertical cross sectional dravrirrgs of<br>
FIGS. 41-44 gas generator assembly 340 is installed in dual-<br><br>
chamber device lOOe within orifice stopper column 168b and<br>
is attached to bottom cover upper surface 318. As shown in<br>
the pre-use condition of FIG. 41, orifice stopper column<br>
168b is resting on bottom cover upper surface 318, as is<br>
float 180.<br>
Shown in detail in FIG. 42, gas generator assembly<br>
tablet housing 344 includes a top 350, a cylindrical side<br>
wall 352 and a bottom 354. Housing bottom 354 is formed<br>
having a plurality of small, short feet 356 that space gas<br>
generator assembly 340 upwardly from device bottom cover<br>
upper surface 318 so that liquid collected in lower chamber<br>
144 can enter through above-described slits in bottom cover<br>
column 208a and then through holes 358 formed in mousing<br>
bottom 354 to activate effervescent tablet 342. Holes 360<br>
are provided in housing top 350 to enable generated gas<br>
bubbles 362 to escape from housing 344 (FIGS. 43 and 44). A<br>
hole 366 is formed in housing side wall 352 to enable the<br>
escape of air from housing 344 during initial activation of<br>
effervescent tablet 342.<br>
As depicted in the vertical cross sectional drawing of<br>
FIG. 43, gas bubbles 3 62 rising from gas generator 340<br>
pushs orifice stopper 160 upwardly into tight sealing<br>
relationship with orifice 146 with stopper seal 216 forced<br>
in a sealing relationship against lower regions of orifice<br>
ring 148, and including "latching" stopper locking bead 166<br>
into orifice locking recess 152, thereby positively locking<br>
the stopper into the orifice to assure no liquid leakage<br>
occurs between upper and lower chambers 142 and 144.<br>
Similarly to above-described dual-chamber devices 100c and<br>
1OOd, the generated gas locking of orifice stopper 16 0b into<br>
orifice 146 is accomplished when lower chamber 144 is filled<br><br>
with aqueous liquid (urine) 152 and without any manual<br>
intervention.<br>
SIXTH VARIATION DUAL-CHAMBER DEVICE 10Of :<br>
A sixth variation dual-chamber device lOOf, shown in<br>
FIGS. 45-49, comprises device body 102b, an orifice stopper<br>
160c, a bottom cover 106b, an orifice stopper pushing base<br>
380 and a very soft removable sponge element 382 disposed<br>
between the bottom cover and the stopper pushing base.<br>
Shown in FIGS. 45 and 47 comprising bottom cover 106b<br>
are a centrically-located, upwardly extending, lower tubular<br>
portion 384, which is open at the bottom and which<br>
terminates in a smaller diameter, upwardly-extending upper<br>
tubular region 386. Otherwise bottom cover 106b is the same<br>
as above-described bottom cover 106a.<br>
Orifice stopper 160c is formed having a slender,<br>
central, depending tubular pushing pin guide 388 which fits<br>
closely into bottom cover upper tubular region 3 86. Orifice<br>
stopper 160c rests, in the pre-use condition of dual-chamber<br>
device lOOf on an upper end region 3 90 of bottom cover lower<br>
tubular region 384 (FIG. 45) . Otherwise, orifice stopper<br>
160c is substantially the same as above-described orifice<br>
stopper 160a.<br>
Pushing base 380 is formed having a flat bottom 392 with<br>
a centrally-located, upwardly- extending column 394 which<br>
fits closely into bottom cover lower tubular region 384.<br>
Extending upwardly from a top 3 96 of column 3 94 is an<br>
elongate slender orifice stopper pushing pin 400 which<br>
extends upwardly in a close-fitting relationship through<br>
orifice stopper pin guide 388. As shown in FIG. 45, top 396<br>
of pushing base column top 3 96 is spaced substantially below<br>
upper end region 390 of bottom cover lower tubulat region<br><br>
384. Pushing base 380 is formed having a recessed; well<br>
region 402 surrounding column 3 94 into which sponge element<br>
3 82 is received, the recessed region being further defined<br>
by a peripheral attachment flange 406 configured for<br>
snapping upwardly onto bottom cover 106b, as shown in PIG.<br>
47. Peripheral attachment flange 406 extends about 270<br>
degrees around pushing base 3 80 (FIG. 29) to provide<br>
suitable space for withdrawing of sponge element 3 82 from<br>
the pushing base, as described below.<br>
As shown in FIG. 46, sponge element 382 has a central<br>
diameter, D15, that may be about 0.08 inch, so as to fit<br>
loosely around column 394 and a height, H5, that may be<br>
about 0.4 inch. A relatively wide gap 410 is formed in<br>
sponge element 3 82 to permit withdrawal of the element from<br>
pushing base recessed region 402. A thin, projecting finger<br>
tab 412 is joined to sponge element 382 opposite gap 410.<br>
Before liquid (urine) is introduced into device 1OOf, sponge<br>
element 3 82 is withdrawn from pushing base recess 402 and is<br>
discarded. Friction between column 3 94 and tubular region<br>
384 retains pushing base 380 in its pre-sponge removal<br>
condition until liquid (urine) filled device lOOf is<br>
subsequently set onto surface 211, as described below.<br>
The use of dual-chamber device lOOf is evident from FIGS<br>
47-48. As liquid (urine) fills device lower chamber 144,<br>
orifice stopper 160c is floated upwardly into a sealing<br>
relationship with orifice 146, whereupon liquid (urine) is<br>
collected in device upper chamber 142. After liquid (urine)<br>
152 is collected in lower chamber 144 and liquid (urine) 154<br>
is collected in upper chamber 142 is set on surface 211.<br>
 The weight of the liquid (urine) 152 and 154 in device body<br>
 102b, then causes the device body with bottom cover 106b to<br>
settle downwardly into pushing base recess 402, thereby<br><br>
causing pushing pin 400 to push upwardly against orifice<br>
stopper 160c in a manner pushing the orifice stopper 160<br>
upwardly into tight sealing relationship with orifice 146<br>
with stopper seal 216 forced in a sealing relationship<br>
against lower regions of orifice ring 148, and including<br>
"latching" stopper locking bead 166 into orifice locking<br>
recess 152.<br>
Subsequent to such downward settling of device body<br>
102b, cover 104 is installed on the device body and device<br>
10Of is manually pressed downwardly on surface 211 to cause<br>
pushing base peripheral flange 406 to snap up over the<br>
bottom cover periphery to retain pushing base 3 80 onto<br>
bottom cover 106b. This positively locks stopper 160c into<br>
orifice 146 and device lOOf can then be handled (even<br>
carelessly) without the possibility of the stopper being<br>
dislodged from the orifice and causing liquid (urine) 152 to<br>
leak past the orifice stopper between upper and lower<br>
chambers 142 and 144.<br>
SEVENTH VARIATION DUAL-CHAMBER DEVICE 10 0g:<br>
A seventh variation dual-chamber device 10Og, shown in<br>
FIGS. 50-52, provides a magnetic locking of orifice stopper<br>
160d into orifice 146 in the manner described below. As<br>
shown in FIG. 50, above-described orifice stopper 160d;<br>
which corresponds to above-described orifice stopper 160b<br>
(FIG. 41) is formed having a magnetic member 42 0 attached<br>
(as by cementing) to and around an under surface 422 of<br>
stopper skirt 164. Magnetic member 420 may constitute a<br>
single-piece, annular magnet or may comprise two or more<br>
magnetic segments. A corresponding magnetic member 424 is<br><br>
attached to an outer surface 426 of orifice locking ring 150<br>
spaced above stopper magnetic member 420.<br>
A removable soft-type sponge spacer 43 0 is shown in FIG.<br>
50 initially installed in dual-chamber device body 102b<br>
between locking ring magnetic member 424 and orifice stopper<br>
160d to keep magnetic members 424 and 420 separated before<br>
use of device lOOg. Forming spacer 430 is a conically-<br>
shaped separation region 432 to which is joined a finger tab<br>
434. Initially orifice stopper 160d rests on bottom cover<br>
106a, as does float 180.<br>
When, as depicted in FIG. 52, spacer 43 0 is removed from<br>
device body 102b and orifice stopper 160d is floated<br>
upwardly into engagement with orifice 146 by liquid (urine)<br>
152 collected in lower chamber 142, magnet members 4 24 and<br>
420 attract each other, thereby drawing the orifice .stopper<br>
tightly into orifice 146 with stopper seal 216 forced in a<br>
sealing relationship against lower regions of orifice ring<br>
148 and with stopper locking bead 166 "latched" into orifice<br>
locking recess 152, thereby positively locking the stopper<br>
into the orifice to assure no liquid leakage occurs between<br>
upper and lower chambers 142 and 144.<br>
EIGHTH VARIATION DUAL-CHAMBER DEVICE 10Oh:<br>
An eighth variation dual-chamber device 1OOh, shown in<br>
FIGS. 53-56, provides locking of orifice stopper 160 into<br>
orifice 146 by a liquid-activated cementing process in the<br>
manner described below. As shown in the pre-use condition<br>
of FIG. 53, dual-chamber device lOOh comprises device. body<br>
102c, orifice stopper 160, float 180 and bottom cover 106a.<br>
Orifice stopper 160 and float 180 are shown resting on<br>
bottom cover 106a below orifice 146. A coating 440 of an<br>
 aqueous liquid (urine) activated cement (adhesive) is<br>
applied to and around inner surface 442 of orifice ring 148<br><br>
(also FIG. 54), and is initially protected by a flexible,<br>
removable "release" 444, which may be made from waxed paper<br>
or plastic material.<br>
As shown in the post-use condition of PIGS. 55 and 56,<br>
"release" 444 has been withdrawn from orifice ring 148 to<br>
expose cement coating 440 to, and be activated by, liquid<br>
(urine) flowing into device body 102b. As liquid 252 is<br>
collected in lower chamber 144, orifice stopper 160 is<br>
floated upwardly into sealing engagement with orifice 146,<br>
thereby contacting activated cement coating 440, which then<br>
cements the orifice stopper into orifice ring 148. This<br>
causes orifice stopper 160 to be permanently locked and<br>
strongly sealed into orifice ring 148, thereby preventing<br>
any leaking of liquid 252 between upper and lower chambers<br>
142 and 144, regardless of any subsequent handling or<br>
mishandling of dual-chamber device 100h.<br>
SUMMARY OF USE OF EXEMPLARY DUAL-CHAMBER DEVICE 100a<br>
The operational use of exemplary dual-chamber device<br>
100a is depicted step-wise in FIGS. 57A-57H. When a patient â– <br>
with a unclean or poorly clean anatomic part uses device<br>
100a, the earlier fore-stream urine volume (40 to 70 ml) is<br>
regarded as favorably useful because, it helps to flush,<br>
rinse and clean the external urogenital tract, which extends<br>
from the urethra to device 100a. Such flushing and rinsing<br>
mechanism creates a cleaner tract for the subsequent mid-<br>
stream sample flowing through this same tract into dual-<br>
chamber device 100a. Thus, (referring to FIGS. 22-24) dual-<br>
chamber device 100a has the ability to capture the earlier<br>
"rinsing" contaminated fore-stream urine and isolate it in<br>
separate lower chamber 144. Dual-chamber device 100a will<br>
then continue to collect the later cleaner mid-stream sample<br><br>
in upper chamber 142, which is separated from lower chamber<br>
144 by orifice stopper 160. This separation and isolation<br>
renders dual-chamber device 100a completely free from mixing<br>
the contaminated fore-stream sample with the clean mid-<br>
stream sample. (The foregoing applies to all above-<br>
described dual-chamber devices 100 and 1OOb-1OOh).<br>
FIG. 57A depicts dual-chamber device 100a (minus handle<br>
110) in its assembled, initial, pre-use condition and<br>
corresponds generally to above-described FIG. 20. Device<br>
body 102 is shown closed by top cover 104 which is, in turn,<br>
sealed by a sterile-marked adhesive sealing strip 450<br>
indicating that the device is in a sterile condition.<br>
Bottom cover 106 (not shown) is retained by locking ring 108<br>
and rests on bottom extension member 220.<br>
In FIG. 57B, handle 110 is shown being fitted upwardly<br>
onto device body fitting 112, with adhesive sealing strip<br>
450 still in place. Handle 110 being shown in FIG. 57C<br>
fully received onto device body fitting 112. FIG. 57D shows<br>
adhesive sealing strip 450 in the process of being removed<br>
and top cover 104 in the process of being unscrewed from<br>
device body 102.<br>
FIG. 57E depicts liquid (urine) 250 being discharged<br>
into upper chamber 142 of device body 102, and corresponds<br>
to FIG. 22. Although not shown in this FIG., the highly<br>
contaminated fore-stream urine first flows into lower<br>
chamber 144 through orifice 146 located between it and upper<br>
chamber 142 situated directly above, this configuration<br>
resembling an hourglass. As soon as the fore-strem.urine<br>
floods lower chamber 144, it creates an air pocket<br>
underneath the orifice stopper skirt region 164. The<br>
progressively increased fluid level within lower chamber 144<br>
elevates the orifice stopper sealing region 162, directing<br><br>
it towards orifice 146 to plug off the lower chamber.<br>
Simultaneously, stabilizing float 180 floats upwards by<br>
buoyancy and further elevates orifice stopper 180, directing<br>
it even more forcibly and rapidly towards orifice 146 to<br>
close it off. When the fore-stream sample has reached a pre-<br>
determined volume of (between 40 to 70ml), orifice stopper<br>
sealing region 164 has already ascended maximally through<br>
orifice 146, producing a tight sealing contact between the<br>
stopper sealing region and orifice ring 148 to shut off<br>
further liquid (urine) inflow into lower chamber 144.<br>
FIG. 57F shows device body upper chamber 142 filled<br>
with liquid (urine) 254 and with top cover about to be<br>
installed onto device body 102 for the closing thereof. Top<br>
cover 104 is screwed onto device body 102, while using<br>
handle 110 to steady and counter rotate the device body<br>
while the top cover is being screwed onto the device body.<br>
FIG. 57G shows liquid (urine) containing device 100a<br>
being pressed downwardly onto surface 211 to cause flexing<br>
of bottom cover web 192 (not shown) into an orifice stopper<br>
locking condition (corresponding to-FIG. 24). Finally, FIG.<br>
57H shows dual-chamber device 100a in its post-use condition<br>
with bottom cover extension member 220 forced upwardly into<br>
device body 102 and the red-colored extension member is no<br>
longer visible (also corresponding to FIG. 24).<br>
With respect to the foregoing, it is preferred that<br>
device body 102a-102d, handle 110, orifice stopper 160 and<br>
160a-d, top cover 104, bottom cover locking ring 108, bottom<br>
cover 106a-b, bottom cover extension 220, secondary bottom<br>
cover 380, and sanitary barrier adapter 270 each be<br>
constructed of a rigid plastic material, such as the high<br>
density polyethylene plastic as disclosed above as<br>
preferred for device body 102.<br><br>
Thus, there has been described above a dual-chamber<br>
device for collecting and storing liquid samples<br>
(specifically urine samples) and several variations thereof<br>
for purposes of illustrating the manner in which the present<br>
invention may be used to advantage. It will, however, be<br>
appreciated that the invention is not limited thereto but<br>
includes any and all variations and modifications which may<br>
occur to those skilled in the art without violating the<br>
scope and spirit of the claims as appended hereto.<br><br>
