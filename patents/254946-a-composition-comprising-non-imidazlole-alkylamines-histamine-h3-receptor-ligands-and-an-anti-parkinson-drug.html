TREATMENT OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE, OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA,<br>
DEMENTIA WITH LEWY BODIES, VASCULAR DEMENTIA WITH<br>
NON-IMIDAZOLE ALKYLAMINES HISTAMINE H3-RECEPTOR LIGANDS.<br>
The present invention relates to the therapeutical application of alkylamines of formula (A) as defined hereafter for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and/or vascular dementia (VD), and particularly for the treatment of their symptoms.<br>
Antagonists of histamine H3-receptor are known especially to increase synthesis and release of cerebral histamine. Through this mechanism, they induce an extended wakefullness, an improvement in cognitive processes, a reduction in food intake and a normalization of vestibular reflexes (Schwartz et al., Physiol. Rev., 1991,71:1-51).<br>
Histamine Hs-receptor agonists are known to inhibit the release of several neurotransmitters including histamine, monoamines and neuropeptides and thereby exert sedative and sleep-promoting effects in brain. In peripheral tissues, Hs-receptor agonists exert namely anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, gastro-intestinal, antisecretory smooth muscle decontracting activities.<br>
H3 receptor antagonist or agonist compounds previously known resemble histamine in possessing an imidazole ring generally monosubstituted in 4(5)-position (Ganellin et al., Ars Pharmaceutica, 1995, 35:3, 455-468; Stark et al., Drug of the Future, 1996, 21(5), 507-520).<br>
Numerous patents and patent applications are directed to antagonist and/or agonist compounds having such structure, in particular EP 197 840, EP 494 010, WO 93/14070, WO 96/29315, WO 92/15 567, WO 93/20061, WO 93/20062, WO 95/11894, US 5 486 526, WO 93/12107, WO 93/12108, WO 95/14007, WO 95/06037, WO 97/29092, EP 680 960, WO 96/38141, WO 96/38142, WO 96/40126.<br>
In the iitterature, Plazzi et al., Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1995, 30, 881, Clitherow et al., Bioorg. &amp; Med. Chem. Lett. 6 (7), 833-838 (1996) Wolin et al., Bioorg. &amp; Med. Chem. Lett; 8, 2157 (1998) can be cited also in this respect.<br><br>
Nevertheless, such imidazole derivatives may show drawbacks such as poor blood-brain barrier penetration, interaction with cytochrome P-450 proteins and/or some hepatic and ocular toxicities.<br>
Non-imidazole known neuro-active compounds such as betahistlne (J-M. Arrang et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985, 111: 72-84), phencyciidine {J-M. Arrang et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1988, 157: 31-35), dimaprit (J-C Schwartz et al., Agents Actions 1990, 30: 13-23), clozapine (M. Kathmann et a!., Psychopharmacology 1994, 116: 464-468), and sesquiterpenes (M. Takigawa et a!,. JP 06 345 642 (20 Dec 1994)) were suggested to display Hs-receptor antagonism but all these compounds have only very low potency.<br>
These compounds were previously known as therapeutic agent before the discovery and characterization of the histamine Hs-receptor, in particular as neuro-active agents for example as neuroleptic (clozapine) or psychotomimetic (Phencyciidine) agent.<br>
When tested at the Hs-receptor, these compounds were shown to display much lower potency than the imidazole-containing compounds described in patent applications quoted above.<br>
Contrary to previous attempts, the inventors succeeded at developping potent Hs-receptor ligands not containing imidazole ring that reduced the above-mentioned drawbacks. These compounds, their preparation and therapeutical applications thereof have been described in the international patent application WO 00/05254.<br>
The participation of histamine, particularly when acting through its H3 Receptor (H3R), in the etiology or symptomatology of PD, OSA, DLB or VD has never been reported before.<br>
PD is mainly associated with a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal tract from which derive the motor impairments and neuropsychiatric disorders characteristic of the disease. Whereas some other aminergic neuron classes might be affected in the parkinsonian brain, postmortem neurochemical and immunohistochemical studies have shown that histaminergic neurons are completely spared from the degeneration process (Garbarg et al.. Lancet 1983,1,74; Nakamura et al.. Neurology, 1996, 4, 1693). In   addition,   in  a  model  of "Parkinsonian"  rat,  In  which  the   nigrostriatal<br><br>
dopaminergic neurons had been previously destroyed by unilateral administration of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine, the effect of the antiparkinsonian drug levodopa on the turning behaviour, a reflect of its antiparkinsonian activity, was not modified by co-administration of thioperamide, a prototypical HSR antagonist/inverse agonist (Huotary et aL, Parkinsonism Relat Disord, 2000, 6, 159), This absence of effect is not attributable to either an absence of H3R sites in the nigrostriatal complex where, on the contrary, they abund (Piilot et al., Neuroscience 2002, 114, 176) or a disappearance of HSR sites as a result of the neuronal degeneration process, since the number of these sites is, on the contrary, elevated in the same animal model (Ryu et al., Neurosci. Letters, 1994, 178, 19). Taken together these findings suggested the lack of therapeutic Interest of this class of drugs in the management of PD.<br>
In addition to the major signs of PD in the movement initiation and control which constitute the core of the disease, it has become apparent during the last decades that a large proportion (as large as 74-81%) of PD patients display sleep and vigilance disorders (Garcia-Borreguero et ai., Sleep Med. Rev., 2003, 7, 115). These Include disorders of sleep initiation and maitenance, sleep fragmentation, parasomnias (including nocturnal hallucinations), sleep disordered breathing and excessive daytime sleepiness (including narcolepsy or "sleep attacks", i.e. inappropriate and unintended falls into sleep while in daytime activity). It is not entirely clear whether this group of disorders is purely related to the PD itself or whether there is also some participation of the treatment by direct or indirect dopaminergic agonists. The treatment of this class of disorders, which may all result from a loss of circadian rythmicity, is poorly efficient : for instance modafinil treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness was tried with limited success and the indication for this stimulant drug of essentially unknown mechanism of action has not been recognized by health authorities.<br>
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) results from the accumulation of such bodies in the cortex (whereas their accumulation in the nigro-striatal complex is observed in PD, a related degenerative disease). It is characterized by cognitive impairment, attentional disturbances, hallucinations, depression and sleep disorders.<br><br>
Vascular dementia, the second nnost frequent cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, is characterized by acute loss of memory, orientation and executive functions and is often associated with demonstrable cerebrovascular lesions in patients suffering from hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea for several years.<br>
The inventors have now unexpectedly demonstrated that antagonists/inverse agonists of the HSR can markedly improve some major symptoms of these diseases.<br>

According to a preferred embodiment, the method of treatment according to the invention comprises administering a patient in need thereof with a therapeutically effective amount of 3-(4-Chlorophenyl)propyl 3-piperidinopropyi ether, optionally in combination with a therapeutically acceptable vehicle or excipient<br>
The invention further relates to the use of 3-(4-Chlorophenyl)propyl 3-piperidinopropyl ether for the manufacture of a medicament intended for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, dementia with Lev/y bodies and/or vascular dementia, and in particular the treatment of the symptoms thereof.<br>
As used herein, -obstructive sleep apneα- (also referred to herein as -OSα-) denotes a breathing disorder that occurs primarily during sleep with consequences that may persist throughout the waking hours in the form of sleepiness. This increasingly well-recognized disease is characterized by periodic collapse of the upper airway during sleep with apneas (periodic cessation of breathing), hypopneas (repetitive reduction in breathing) or a continuous or sustained reduction in ventilation and excessive daytime sleepiness, neurocognitive defects and depression. It affects almost every system in the body, resulting namely in increased incidence of cardiovascular<br><br>
disorders (Qureshi and Ballard, J. Allergy and Clin. Immunol., 2003, 112 , 643 ). There is no known pharmacological treatment for OSA.<br>
-Parkinson's disease- (-PD-) refers to idiopathic PD or idiopathic parkinsonism described by James Parkinson in 1817. The clinical tetrad of PD includes tremor at repose, bradykinesia (slowness of voluntary movement) or akinesia (reduced or absent movement), cogwheel or leadpipe rigidity, and postural impairment causing difficulty in turning and a stooped posture. The pathologic hallmark is the presence of intracytoplasmic eosinophillic inclusions (Lewy bodies) in addition to loss of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition to the major signs of PD in the movement initiation and control which constitute the core of the disease a large proportion of PD patients display sleep and vigilance disorders. These -sleep and vigilance disorders associated with PD- include in particular insomnia, disorders of sleep initiation and maitenance, sleep fragmentation, parasomnias, sleep disordered breathing, excessive daytime sleepiness (including -sleep attacks-) and circadian dysrhythmia (inversion of sleep-wake rhythm).<br>
Dementia with Lewy bodies results from the accumulation of such bodies in the cortex (whereas their accumulation in the nigro-striata! complex is observed in PD, a related degenerative disease). It is characterized by cognitive impairment, attentional disturbances, hallucinations, depression and sleep disorders.<br>
-Vascular dementia, the second most frequent cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, is characterized by acute loss of memory, orientation and executive functions and is often associated with demonstrable cerebrovascular lesions in patients suffering from hypertension, diabetes, hyperiipidemia, sleep apnea for several years-<br>
-Pharmaceutically- or -pharmaceutically acceptable- refer to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward reaction when administered to an animal, or a human, as appropriate.<br><br>
As used herein, -pharmaceutically acceptable carrier- includes any diluents, adjuvants, excipients, or vehicles, such as preserving agents, fillers, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.<br>
in the context of the invention, the term -treating- or -treatment-, as used herein, means reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition.<br>
-Therapeutically effective amount- means an amount of a compound/medicament according to the present invention effective in producing the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
According to the invention, the term -patient-, or -patient in need thereof, is intended for a human or non-human mammal affected or likely to be affected with a neuropsychological disorder. Preferably, the patient is a human.<br>
-Anti-parkinson drug- refers to any agent usually used and administered to treat, prevent or minimize the effets of Parkinson's disease. Common anti-parkinson drugs include levodopa, ropinorole, lisuride, bromocriptine, pramixepole.<br>
The -combinations- of the inevntion refer to combination of two active ingredients which are administered simultaneously, separately or sequentially.<br>
The compound or medicament according to the invention can be administered via oral, parenteral or topical routes, the active ingredient being combined with a therapeutically suitable excipient or vehicle.<br>
According to the invention, oral administration of the compound or medicament    in    an    appropriate   formulation    is    advantageously    used.<br><br>
Formulations which are suitable to be administered orally to a patient include discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the compound of formula (A); they also include a powder or granules; as solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion.<br>
Actual dosage levels of compounds of formula (A) of the invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of active ingredient that is effective to obtain a desired therapeutic response for a particular composition and method of administration. The selected dosage level therefore depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, on the desired duration of treatment and other factors, e.g. the condition of the patient.<br>
Total daily dose of the compounds useful according to this invention administered to a host in single or divided doses may be in amounts, for example, of from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg body weight daily and preferably 0.01 to 10 mg/kg/day. A suitable effective dose will be in general in the range of from 10 to 500 mg per day and of from 1 to 10mg/day for particularly active compounds.<br>
An example of doses regimen may be a single administration of a H3 antagonists/inverse agonists as described herein (such as 3-(4-Chlorophenyl)propyl 3-piperldinopropyl ether) once a day each morning at an oral dose of 30-50 mg to accompany the usual treatment with dopaminergic agents.<br>
Dosage unit compositions may contain such amounts of such submultiples thereof as may be used to make up the daily dose. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the body weight, general health, sex, diet, time and route of administration, rates of absorption and excretion, combination with other drugs and the severity of the particular disease being treated.<br>
These doses are given on the basis of the compound and should be adapted for the salts, hydrates or hydrated salts thereof.<br><br>
The amount of each component administered is determined by the attending clinicians taking into consideration the etiology and severity of the disease, the patient condition and age, the potency of each component and other factors.<br>
The invention is now illustrated by the following examples.<br>
Example 1: treatment of the wakefulness/sleep disorders of PD with histamine H3 antagonists/inverse agonists<br>
Parkinsonism was experimentally induced in a group of cats by treatment with the chemical neurotoxin MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) which selectively ablates the dopaminergic neurons and reproduces the motor impairments of human PD. The group of cats displayed a marked disorganization of their sleep-wakefulness patterns.<br>
As assessed by electromyographic and EEG recordings, treatment with BF 2.-649 (3-(4-Chlorophenyl)propyl 3-piperidinopropyl ether), a potent and selective H3-antagonist, at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg, normalized these sleep-wakefulness patterns. Particularly, the long periods of sleep which replace, in this animal model of PD, the succession of periods of sleep and wakefulness, a change likely to correspond to the excessive daytime sleepiness experienced by a large proportion of human patients, were largely suppressed upon administration of this drug.<br>
These data, obtained in a very reliable model of PD, show that treatment with histamine H3 antagonists/inverse agonists is able not only to treat the excessive daytime sleepiness which is so detrimental in the every day life of PD patients, but also to restablish a normal sleep architecture.<br>
Example 2: treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with histamine H3 antagonists/inverse agonists<br>
In a group of 10 mate patients with a diagnostic of OSA, confirmed by polysomnography performed during a night in an hospital setting, an Epswoth score above 12 and a body mass index of less than 35, the effect of a 3-day treatment with  BF  2.649  (3-(4-Chlorophenyl)propyl  3-piperidinopropyl<br><br>
ether) was assessed in a single-blind trial against placebo, at a fixed oral dose of 40 mg once a day.<br>
This treatment resulted in all subjects in a clear decrease (by more than 60%) in the number of diurnal somnolence episodes and a total prevention of the occurrence of diurnal sleep episodes. In addition the nocturnal sleep duration was not decreased and its quality was improved This clinical trial establishes for the first time the utility of H3 antagonists/inverse agonists in OSA.<br>
Example 3: treatment of dementia with Lewi bodies with histamine H3 antagonists/inverse agonists<br>
Generally, dementia with Lewi bodies is treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil, rivastigmine or gallanthamine. These agents increase the acetylcholine concentration in the brain extracellular space. Combinations of a compound of the invention and one of these agents were tested on rats. The drug was selected from donepezil, rivastigmine or gallanthamine and administered in combination with 3-(4-Chiorophenyl)propyl 3-piperidinopropyl ether in rats. Analysis of the rat brains by microdialysis showed that the increase of the acetylcholine concentration was potentlalised with co-administration of the compound of the invention. The combinations were well tolerated by the rats, in particular in respect of the cardiovascular parapmeters.<br>
Example 4: treatment of PD with histamine H3 antagonists/inverse agonists in combination with an anti-parkinson drug<br>
Combinations of a compound of the invention and a anti-parkinson drug were tested on rats and humans suffering from Parkinson. The anti-parkinson drug was selected from ropinirole.lisuride, bromocriptine, levodopa, pramiprexole and administered in combination with 3-(4-Chlorophenyl)propyl 3-piperidinopropyl ether at a dose of 40 mg p.o. Motor symptomes were significantly improved. The combination of the invention allowed lower doses of the anti-parkinson drug to be administered.<br><br>
Example 5: treatment of narcolepsy with histamine H3 antagonists/inverse agonists<br>
Two clinical studies were conducted on patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in a single-blinded or double-biinded trial against placebo with a polysomnographical test on patients.<br>
In both studies, patients were administered with 3-(4-ChlorophenyOpropyl 3-piperidinopropyl ether at 40mg p.o. once a day during 3 and 7 days.<br>
In both studies, daytime sleepiness was improved In accordance with the Epworth test or according to the frequency of naps or daytime sleepiness occurences. The average daytime sleepiness could be reduced by up to 50%.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
