METHOD FOR FIXING AN ELEMENT IN AN ELECTRICAL APPARATUS AND ELECTRICAL APPARATUS SUCH AS A VACUUM SWITCH COMPRISING AT LEAST TWO PARTS FIXED ACCORDING TO SUCH A METHOD.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method for fixing an element on a part belonging to an electrical apparatus and an electrical apparatus such as a vacuum cartridge comprising at least two parts fixed according to such a method.<br>
Vacuum cartridges are formed by an enclosure, in the majority of cases made of co-amic, of general cylindrical shape and closed by two end-plates inside which a stationary cont^:t and a contact called movable contact are housed. This movable contact can be moved between a position in which the two stationary and movable contacts are touching one another so as to enable the current to flow and an open contact position in which these two contacts are separated so as to interrupt the current.<br>
These cartridges can also comprise dielectric shields fitted around the contacts or fitted at the top and bottom parts of said cartridge.<br>
Fixing of the dielectric shields on the enclosure, around the contacts, can be performed in<br>
several ways:<br>
Cartridges formed by an enclosure made up of two cylindrical parts are for example<br>
known. The dielectric shield is formed by a cylindrical part comprising an annular rib<br>
extending perpendicularly to the axis of the cylinder and interposed betweai said<br>
cylindrical parts and the enclosure. The drawback of this solution lies in the bi-ceramic<br>
nature of the cartridge.<br>
A cartridge called mono-ceramic is also known, comprising a monoblock enclosure the<br>
inside surface whereof presents a boss designed to cooperate with an annular recess<br>
provided on the outside surface of the shield. This solution presents the drawback of<br>
requiring machining of the enclosure.<br>
A mono-ceramic cartridge is also known as described in the Patent US 6 417 473<br>
comprising a groove provided in the inside surface of the ceramic enclosure and designed<br>
to house a bungee spring which is secured vertically when inserted in the opening of the<br>
ceramic. In this embodiment, the dielectric shield is of cylindrical shape and comprises a<br>
 <br>
cylindrical rib whereby the shield presses on the above-mentioned spring, welding being perfonned to fix the shield in definitive manner on the spring. The drawbacks of this embodiment lie mainly in the fact that the shield is not secured in rotation and that the ceramic enclosure requires machining.<br>
Centering and welding of the respectively top and bottom dielectric shields require specific tooling and are performed at the time the cartridge is closed.<br>
The contact pads are generally welded onto the electrodes before closing of Ac cartridge is performed, which means that the phases respectively of welding and of closing have to be performed in two separate steps.<br>
The present invention overcomes these drawbacks and proposes a method for fixing an<br>
<br>
element to a part belonging to an electrical apparatus and an electrical apparatus such as a vacuum cartridge comprising at least two parts fixed according to such a method, enabling centering and securing of the element which is to be fixed, prior to definitive fixing thereof, without requiring prior machining of the parts such as the ceramic enclosure, and enabling the apparatus to be assembled and fixing of the elements to be performed in a single step.<br>
For this purpose, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for fixing an element onto a part belonging to an electrical apparatus, this method being characterized in that it consists in interposing an extender between said element and said part, which extender is able to exert forces on the element and said part so as to position the element durably with respect to said part and/or to secure said element in position with respect to said part by fiiction between the extender and the element on the one hand and the extender and said part on the other hand, thus ensuring positioning and/or securing of said element with respect to said part.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, this positioning and/or securing is performed prior to final fixing of said element.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the above-mentioned final fixing is achieved by performing two welding operations respectively between said element and the extender and between the extender and said part.<br>
 <br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, each welding operation comprises at least three welding points.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an electrical apparatus such as a vacuum cartridge comprising at least one element designed to be fixed onto a part belonging to said apparatus by means of a method comprising the above-maitioned features taken either alone or in combination.<br>
According to a particular feature, the vacuum cartridge comprising an Â«iclosure of substantially cylindrical shape closed by two end cover-plates in which two arcing contacts and a dielectric shield fitted around the contacts are housed, this cartridge is characterized in that the above-mentioned shield is fixed onto the enclosure by means of an extender fitted inside the enclosure between said enclosure and the shield and able to exert radial forces on the enclosure and the shield, said extender being fixed respectively to the enclosure and to the shield by respectively two welding operations according to the above-mentioned method comprising the above-mentioned features taken either alone or in combination.<br>
According to a particular feature, the vacuum cartridge comprising, at the top and/or bottom part thereof, an end cover-plate-plate and a dielectric shield fitted around the end cover-plate-plate, this cartridge is characterized in that it comprises an extender fitted between the above-mentioned end cover-plate and the dielectric shield and fixed by welding on the one hand to said cover-plate and on the other hand to said shield, according to the above-mentioned method comprising the above-mentioned features taken either alone or in combination.<br>
According to a particular feature, the vacuum cartridge comprising an enclosure of substantially cylindrical shape closed by two end cover-plates in which two arcing contacts are housed, said cartridge comprising at the top and/or bottom part thereof a dielectric shield fitted around the enclosure, this cartridge is characterized in that it comprises an extender fitted between said shield and the enclosure and fixed by welding on the one hand<br>
 <br>
to said enclosure and on the other hand to said shield, according to the above-mentioned method comprising the above-mentioned features taken either alone or in combination.<br>
According to another feature, at least one of the respectively stationary and movable contacts is fixed to the electrode that is associated therewith by means of an extender interposed between the contact and the electrode.<br>
According to another feature, the or each contact comprises a tubular aperture designed to receive a part of conjugate shape of the corresponding electrode.<br>
According to another feature, the or each contact comprises a tubular aperture designed to receive a part of conjugate shape of the corresponding electrode, and said extender presents a disk shape comprising a closed tubular duct in the center thereof, which duct is designed to be inserted in the tubular duct of the corresponding contact and to receive the tubular part of corresponding shape belonging to the electrode.<br>
According to another feature, said vacuum cartridge comprising a bellow protection shield fitted around a bellow fitted around the movable electrode, this cartridge is characterized in that the bellow protection shield is fixed to the electrode by means of an extender fitted between the bellow protection shield and the electrode and secured respectively by two welds onto the electrode and onto the bellow protection shield.<br>
But other advantages and features of the invention will become more clearly apparent fix)m the following description which refers to the accompanying drawings given for example purposes only and in which:<br>

-Figure 13 is a perspective view of an extender.<br>
In figures 1 and 2 a vacuum cartridge A is represented designed to be used in a switdi to perform breaking in an electric circuit. This cartridge A comprises a cylindrical aiclosure 1 close off by two end cover-plates 2,3, in which two arcing contacts 4,5 are housed, one contact whereof, the stationary contact 4, is securedly fixed to one 2 of the above-mentioned cover-plates 2,3, whereas the other contact whereof, the movable contact 5, is fitted with axial sliding inside the cartridge A through the end cover-plate called the bottom cover-plate 3. Each contact 4,5 comprises a contact 6,7 pad fixed on an electrode 8,9, the electrode 8 of the stationary contact 4 being fixed to the end cover-plate called the top cover-plate 2, whereas the electrode 9 of the movable contact 5 is fitted sliding through the end cover-plate 3 called the bottom cover-plate, a bellows seal 10 being fitted between the movable electrode 9 and the bottom end cover-plate 3. This cartridge A also comprises dielectric shields 11,12,13 and 14 comprising a shield 11 placed around the contacts 4,5, a shield 12 placed around the end cover-plate 2 called the top cover-plate and a shield 13 situated around the end cover-plate 3 called the bottom cover-plate, and a shield 14 situated around the bellows seal 10.<br>
According to the prior art embodiment represented in figure 1, the enclosure 1 of the cartridge A is made up of two parts 15,16. The dielectric shield 11 situated around the contacts 4,5 is formed by a cylindrical part 17 and comprises a flange ring 18 extending fi-om the cylindrical part 17 of the shield 11 in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the shield. Fixing of said shield 11 on the enclosure 1 is performed by placing the flange ring 18 between the two enclosure parts 15,16 and making a weld 34 between the shield 11 and the enclosure 1 on each side of the flange ring 18.<br>
The two shields 12,13 respectively the top and bottom shield, are centered and welded with a tool when closing of the cartridge is performed.<br>
 <br>
The two contact pads 6, 7 are welded onto the stationary and movable electrodes 8,9 before<br>
closing of the cartridge is performed.<br>
In figure 2, the main shield 11 is fixed to the enclosure 1 according to the invention by<br>
means of an extender 19, the two dielectric shields 12,13 respectively the top and bottom<br>
shield are likewise fixed to the enclosure 1 by means of an extender 20,21, and the bottom<br>
dielectric shield 13 is also fixed to the bottom end cover-plate 3 by means of an extoider<br>
22.<br>
Assembly and fitting of the main shield 11 according to the invention will be described in<br>
the following with reference to figures 3 to 12.<br>
In figures 3 and 4, the shield has not yet been fixed to the enclosure 1. In figures 5 and 6, a<br>
fitting tool 23 is placed inside the enclosure 1 to guide fitting of the extendi". In figures 7<br>
and 8, the extender 19 is placed inside the enclosure 1 and is pressing on the fitting tool 23.<br>
In figures 9 and 10, the shield 11 is placed inside the extender 19 and said extaider 19<br>
generates radial forces on the shield 11 and the enclosure so as to keep said shield 11 in<br>
position, before final fixing thereof, which is achieved by two welds made respectively<br>
between the shield 11 and the extender 19 and between the extender 19 and the enclosure<br>
1. The montage fitting tool is then removed (fig.l 1 and 12).<br>
Fixing of the top 12 and bottom 13 shields (or deflectors) is performed by placing two extenders 20,21 respectively around the top part 24 and the bottom part 25 of the enclosure 1, and then an extender 22 around the bottom end cover-plate 3, and in thai placing the top dielectric shield 12 around the extender 20 situated at the top part 24 of the aiclosure 1; then the bottom dielectric shield 13 is fitted around the two extenders 21,22 sitxiated at the bottom part 25 of the enclosure 1. Final fixing of the extenders 19 to 22 will be performed by welding on the one hand between the extenders 19 to 22 and the corresponding dielectric shields 11,12,13 and on the other hand between the extenders 19^0,21 and the ceramic enclosure 1, or between the extender 22 and the bottom end cover-plate 3. The extenders 19 to 22 then perform centering of the dielectric shields 11,12,13. At the level of the contacts 4,5, extenders 26,27 are placed respectively between the contact pads 6,7 and their respective electrode 8,9. The contacts 4,5 comprise a tubular aperture 28,29 designed to receive a part of conjugate shape 30,31 of the corresponding electrode 8,9, and the extender 26,27 associated with the contact respectively 4,5 presents a disk-<br>
 <br>
shape comprising, in the center thereof, a closed tubular duct 32,33 designed to receive the<br>
tubular part of corresponding shape 30,31 belonging to the electrode 8,9. The extenders<br>
26,27 placed at the level of the contacts 4,5 thus perform securing of the contact pads 6,7<br>
on the corresponding electrodes 8,9 prior to final fixing of said pads 6,7 to the electrodes<br>
8,9.<br>
All the above-mentioned welds are made at the same time after the cartridge has been<br>
assembled and placed inside a fumace.<br>
It can therefore be observed that according to the invention, fixing of the ^eld can be<br>
performed with a smooth ceramic without any machining having to be perfonned thCTeon.<br>
But it should be noted that the invention can also be implemented on a non-OTaooth<br>
ceramic. The spring blocks the shield in position by fiiction, vertically and in rotation, prior<br>
to final fixing by welding. This method of fixing makes it possible to adapt to a wide range<br>
of ceramics manufacturing tolerances.<br>
It can be noted that other elements than those described above will be able to be fixed<br>
inside the enclosure, such as the bellows protection shield on the electrode or centering<br>
tooling on the outside which can act as a three-point protection shield.<br>
The invention is naturally not limited to the embodiments that have been described and illustrated which have been given for example purposes only.<br>
On the contrary, the invention extends to encompass all the technical equivalexits of the means described as well as combinations thereof if the latter are performed according to the spirit of the invention.<br>
