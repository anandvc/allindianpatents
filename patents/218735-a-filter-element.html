				<td>FILTER SYSTEM; ELEMENT CONFIGURATION; AND METHODS<br>
This application is being filed as a PCT international patent application in the name of Donaldson Company, Inc., a U.S. national corporation, on 29 November 2001 designating all countries except the U.S.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to air cleaner systems. It particularly concerns air cleaners for air intake systems of combustion engines and/or air compressor systems. In a typical application, the air cleaner will be used in association with the air intake system for equipment such as off road machinery (track-type tractors; truck loaders; skid steer loaders; pipelayers; excavators; material handlers; wheeled excavators; front shovels; forest machines; track skidders; drum compactors (soil or asphalt); pneumatic compactors; asphalt pavers; soil stabilizers; cold planers; VFS trailers; wheel loaders; telescopic handlers; integrated tool carriers; wheel tractors; landfill compactors; soil compactors; backhoe loaders; articulated trucks; off highway trucks and tractors; scrapers; motor graders; wheel skidders; and generator sets), farm equipment (tractors, combines), on mining equipment (ore haulers). The invention also concerns air filter elements, for such systems, and methods of assembly and use.<br>
Background<br>
In general, the machinery vehicles or other equipment that operate with internal combustion engines require filtration systems for the air intake to the engine.   Such air filtration arrangements, typically referenced by the term "air cleaner", are generally positioned to separate dust and other components from the air as it is drawn into the engine. Air cleaners typically include a housing and a replacement filter element arrangement. Typically, the air cleaners are designed such that the filter elements can be removed and replaced.<br>
Air compressor systems typically include two air lines that need filtration: the intake air to the engine; and, the intake air to the compressed air storage. Air cleaners are desirable for these systems as well.<br><br>

FIG. 19 is a cross-sectional view of the safety element depicted in FIGS. 16-18 and taken along the line 19-19 of FIG. 18.<br>
FIG. 20 is a fragmented, cross-sectional view depicting the primary element and safety element being aligned, during mounting of the primary element in the air cleaner.<br>
FIG. 21 is a fragmented, cross-sectional view showing the safety element and the primary element in proper alignment with each other.<br><br>
direction of, and circumscribes, axis 15; axis 15 being a longitudinal centra.'] axis defined by an internally received primary element 25, as described below.<br>
It is noted that the particular air cleaner 1 depicted in FIG. 1, as seen from the end view of FIG. 2, is somewhat "obround", i.e. slightly off round from cylindrical. Such configurations are well known, as are housings that are more perfectly cylindrical. Herein, both types will be referred to as "generally cylindrical."<br>
Access cover 9 generally fits over an open end 19 of body 8. In the particular arrangement shown, access cover 9 is secured in place over end 19 by latches 20.<br>
Because the particular arrangement 1 depicted is slightly obround, it is desirable to ensure proper alignment between the end cover 9, and a remainder of the housing body 8. Proper radial alignment can be obtained by engagement between a notch 20a (FIGS. 11-13) on the cover 9, and a post on the housing body 8.<br>
The particular air cleaner 1 depicted is shown mounted in a generally horizontal configuration, i.e. with axis 15 extending generally horizontally (assuming the equipment is standing on level ground and with frame section 5 extending generally parallel to the ground). However, it is recognized that air cleaners 1 of the type depicted can be used in other orientations.<br>
Attention is directed to FIG. 3, in which portions of the assembly 1 are depicted broken away, for viewing of selected internal detail. Referring to FIG. 3, it can be seen that the body 8, along with side portions 20 of the cover 9, defines interior 22 of the air cleaner assembly 1. Within the interior 22 for the particular air cleaner 1 depicted is positioned an air filter arrangement 23, through which air is directed during use. The particular air filter arrangement 23 shown includes a first or primary filter element 25 and a secondary or safety filter element 26.<br>
For the particular arrangement shown, the filter elements 25 and 26 are cylindrical in configuration, and thus have an outer circular periphery. The housing body, being slightly obround, then, does not define a perfect central longitudinal access in alignment with the filter elements 25, 26. Such arrangements, again, are common. However, it is also common to have both the housing and the filter element have circular outer perimeters, and the same central longitudinal axis.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the assembly 1 includes an interior mounting ring or sealing ring 29. The seal ring 29 is a portion of an outlet flow construction or tube 29a (FIG. 1), in flow communication with outlet 13.   More specifically, ring 29, wall section 29b and outlet projection 29c collectively form outlet tube 29a for exit of filtered air from the air cleaner 1.<br>
In general, for the arrangement 1 shown, the safety element 26 is mounted to seal against an interior surface 30 of the mounting ring 29 (or tube 29a), and the primary element 25 is mounted to seal against an exterior surface 31 of the mounting ring 29 (or tube 29a).<br>
The seal 32 formed between the primary element 25 and the outer surface 31 of the seal ring 29, will generally be referred to herein as "radial" because the sealing forces are directed radially toward and/or away from, i.e. generally orthogonal to, axis 15. That is, the seal forces are radially directed as opposed to being axially directed; "axial" in this context meaning pointed in a direction generally parallel to axis 15. The particular radial seal for element 25, is sometimes tenned "interior" or "internal" because the radial seal 32 is located at an interior of element 25.<br>
A variety of types of radial seal systems are known. One of the most widely utilized radial seal systems for air cleaner assemblies of the types depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, is the Donaldson Radialseal™ system, available from the Donaldson Company, Inc., of Bloomington, Minnesota, and described generally in such references as EP 0329659; and U.S. Pat. 5,547,480; each of these publications being incorporated herein by reference. The Donaldson Radialseal™ systems have been utilized on primary elements for such equipment as off road machinery and vehicles, farm tractors, ore haulers, over-the-highway trucks; and, air compressors.<br>
The safety element 26 is also sealed to the seal ring 29 by a radial seal 33. In this instance, the radial seal 33 is an "exterior" radial seal, since it extends outwardly away from, and around, an outside of element 26, as opposed to being directed inside. Such seals are described for example in U.S. Pat. 6,099,606, which is incorporated herein by reference. Donaldson-manufactured safety elements using such radial seals have been provided for such equipment as off road machinery and equipment such as tracked vehicles; wheeled equipment; roller compactors; generator sets; and, ore haulers.<br><br>
III.      THE PRIMARY ELEMENT<br>
Attention is now directed to FIGS. 4-7, in which the primary element 25 is depicted. The primary element 25 includes a side extension 34, open end 35, and closed end 36. In general, the side extension 34 extends between the open and closed ends 35, 36. The open end 35 generally defines a central aperture 40, FIG. 7.<br>
For the embodiment depicted, the primary element 25 includes a first end cap 41 and a second end cap 42, with filter media pack 43 extending therebetween. In general, the first end cap 41 defines a first, or open end 35; the second end cap 42 defines a second, or closed end 36; and, the media pack 43 defines the side extension 34. In typical systems, the media pack 43 will be generally cylindrical with central axis 15. A variety of constructions can be used for the media pack 43, a preferred one for certain applications being described hereinbelow.<br>
For the arrangement 1 depicted, the first end cap 41 serves several functions. For example, it defines central outlet aperture 40 and a central sealing region 46 for sealing against surface 29 (FIG. 3), when the element 25 is installed. Also, the end cap 41 secures components of the media pack 43 together and inhibits air and dust leakage around them.<br>
In addition, structural features provided in the end cap 41 can provide performance enhancements. More specifically, end cap 41 includes a segmented, raised ring structure 44, FIG. 6. When the end cap 41 is manufactured from a preferred soft compressible polyurethane, for example, of the type indicated below, the segmented ring 44 forms a bumper type extension at end 35 of element 25. This can provide a non-sealing, cushioning, against wall 11 of housing 3 (FIG. 1).<br>
In typical preferred systems, the first end cap 41 is a single, unitary, molded material, preferably a soft compressible material; most preferably, a compressible, foamed, polyurethane. Preferred materials and characteristics are provided herein below. Preferably the structural features of the end cap 41, then, are provided during a molding process at the same time that the media pack 43 is potted in, or secured to, the material of end cap 41. A general approach to this construction is also described below.<br>
For certain arrangements, the seal region 46 will be shaped or configured analogously to other Donaldson Radialsealrw systems. Such configurations are<br><br>
a plurality of segments 52 projected axially outwardly therefrom, to form a non-sealing, engagement with cover 9, during installation, FIG. 10.<br>
The preferred second end cap 42 depicted includes features providing for additional functions. One function relates to appropriate configuration for support of the primary element 25, when mounted in a horizontal position as indicated in FIGS. 1 and 2. This function is performed in part by central rim 55 as described below. Also preferably, portions of second end cap 42 provide for an alignment and support function in cooperation with the safety element 26. For the particular arrangement shown, this function is provided by safety element engagement portion 56, as described below.<br>
For the particular arrangement depicted, the second end cap 42 is a two jomponent end cap, with the first component comprising molded polymeric material which defines annular region 49 and a second component comprising a preformed tructure 58 which defines central rim 55, central region or area 53, and safety :lement engagement portion 56. By "preformed" in this context, it is meant that the r.ructure 58 preferably comprises a rigid material preformed to possess a preferred onfiguration and that is then secured into the overall primary element 25, during a :ep of element construction, described below, prior to molding outer annular region 9. Preformed structure 58 is described in greater detail below.<br>
IV.       SUPPORT OF THE PRIMARY ELEMENT SECOND OR<br>
CLOSED END, DURING AIR CLEANER USE<br>
As indicated above, features of the primary element 25 facilitate support of j element-closed end 36 when installed for use, especially in the horizontal sition depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2. With respect to this function, attention is acted to FIGS. 9-15.<br>
Referring first to FIGS. 11-15, end cover 9 is depicted. The end cover 9 iudes an outer surface 65 and an inner surface 66. When installed, the outer face 65 of the cover 9 is the surface generally directed toward the exterior ironment, and the inner surface 66 is generally directed toward the air cleaner rior 22.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 12 and 13, the inner surface 66 includes an element agement construction 70 thereon. The element engagement construction 70 is<br><br>
Preferably, an outer perimeter 75 of projection 72 is non-circular, for reasons that will be described below. Most preferably outer perimeter 75 includes at least three vertices or apices 79. Preferably, outer perimeter 75 defines a polyhedron which is sized and configured to engage, abut or become positionably aligned with circular central rim 55 at spaced points or vertices 76. Regular polyhedral shapes, i.e. polyhedrons having straight segments or sections 78 all of equal length, and defining spaced apices 79, are preferred. Most preferably, the polyhedral perimeter 75 has at least five sides and not more than ten sides, defining at least five and not more than ten apices. The particular projection 72 depicted in FIGS. 12 and 13 is octahedral.<br>
Preferably, projection 72 is configured so that if it does not abut circular central rim 55, the apices 79 are spaced from the central rim 55, when the air cleaner 1 is assembled, by not more than 30 millimeters, and preferably not more than 15 millimeters. This will ensure that, when installed, the element 25 cannot rock downwardly undesirably far.<br>
Preferably, the projection 72 will be continuous in extension, i.e. without gaps, so that it is fairly strong and not likely to break in use. However, discontinuous configurations can be used. Also, preferably, the projection 72 defines a hollow, recessed, interior 82 which, among other things, allows receiving room for certain additional features of the element 25 characterized below. Preferably, perimeter 75 comprises a continuous wall: (a) at least about 0.25 millimeters thick, typically 0.5 to 5 millimeters thick, no more than 20 mm thick; and (b) at least 10 millimeters high, typically 20 to 50 millimeters high, no more than 100 mm high.<br>
By reference to FIGS. 9 and 10, it will be apparent that after the element is installed, once the cover 9 is put in place, projection 72 will extend into recess 74. In general, any upwardly directed apices, for example apex 83, FIG. 9, will support the element 25 and prevent the element 25 from undesirably sagging, rocking or dropping at end 36. For preferred arrangements, the parts are configured such that projection 72 extends at least 5 millimeters into recess 74, most preferably 10 to 30 millimeters, and not more than 100 mm.   FIG. 9 also shows the safety element 26 installed in the system.<br><br>
Attention is directed to FIGS. 12 and 13. Inner surface 66, central region 67 includes, projecting inwardly therefrom, wall 75 as well as radially extending strengthening ribs 68. Ribs 68 extend radially from the wall 75 to the outer perimeter rim 87.<br>
VI.      ARRANGEMENT FOR SAFETY ELEMENT ALIGNMENT<br>
As indicated above, the preferred air cleaner 1 includes an arrangement 76 (FIGS. 20, 21) for ensuring appropriate alignment of the safety element 26 with the primary element 25.<br>
The safety element alignment is one which does not require any structure on the seal ring 29, or indeed any additional structure on the housing 3, but rather operates with features on the elements 25, 26. Thus, it can be retrofit into previously existing housing bodies.<br>
In general, the alignment arrangement 76 includes a projection/receiver arrangement 88 with a first member 89 of the projection/receiver arrangement 88 positioned on the primary element 25, and a second member 90 of the projection/receiver arrangement 88 provided on the safety element 26. For the particular arrangement shown, the primary element 25 includes a receiver member • 92 in end cap 42; and the safety element 26 includes a projection member 93, on end cap 105.<br>
Attention is directed to FIGS. 16-19, in which the safety element 26 is depicted. The safety element 26 includes a first open end 100, an opposite closed end 101, and a side extension 102. For the particular arrangement shown, the open end 100 is defined by a first open end cap 104; the closed end 101 is defined by a second closed end cap 105; and the side extension 102 is defined by a media pack 106 that is embedded in, and extends between, the two end caps 104, 105. The particular arrangement shown also includes an inner liner 120 and an outer liner 121, extending between the two end caps 104, 105. In alternate arrangements, the inner and outer liners 120, 121 may be omitted. In FIGS. 19-21, only a partial section of the inner liner 120 is depicted.<br>
For the particular embodiment shown, the open end cap 104 provides the functions of: retaining the media pack sealed and assembled, at the open end 100; and, sealing seal region 108 (as an externally directed radial seal) to ring 29, when<br><br>
perfect alignment with central axis 124. As a result of the misalignment, as the primary element 25 is moved in the direction of arrow 125, projection 93 of safety element 26 is engaged by receiver 92, again out of perfect axial alignment. However, a cam or sliding engagement between the surfaces 130 and 131, as primary element 25 continues to be moved in the direction of arrow 125, from the position shown in FIG. 20, will align the elements 25, 26. In particular, engagement between the surfaces 130 and 131 will force the safety element 26 to straighten out or reorient itself, into the alignment shown in FIG. 21. Alternately phrased, preferably the projection/receiver combination 92/93 is oriented such that when misalignment occurs, continued motion along the direction of a central axis for the primary element 25 will tend to cause the safety element 26 to slide into appropriate alignment. It is noted that engagement between the projection 93 and receiver 92, at the end of the alignment, FIG. 21, will also tend to retain the safety element in proper alignment, at least until the primary element 25 is removed.<br>
It is preferred that the projection 93 and the receiver 92 each have sufficient circular symmetry (although not necessarily the same shape) so that relative radial orientation between the safety element and the primary element do not matter, for functioning of the projection/receiver assembly. The frustoconical configuration indicated is preferred but is not required. Alternative usable shapes include: cylinders, cubes, boxes, truncated spheres, hemispheres, and 3-d structures having cross-sections of triangles, pentagons, octagons, or other polyhedrons:<br>
Preferred dimensions for the frustoconical projection 93 are provided herein: a height from end cap outer surface 107 to end 113a of at least 5 millimeters, typically 10-50 millimeters, and not greater than 100 mm; a base diameter, that is, the diameter at its largest section coplanar with end cap surface 107 of at least 25 millimeters, typically 30-80 millimeters, and not greater than 150 mm; and a diameter at its end 113a of at least 5 millimeters, typically 10-30 millimeters, not greater than SO mm. The sidewall 113 extends at an angle between the base diameter and the end 113a at least 0.5°, typically 1-45°, and not greater than 80°. The receiver 92 is preferably sized to receive the projection 93 without interference. As such, the receiver 92 may be sized on the order of 5-20% larger than the above dimensions (i.e.: a height (or depth, depending on perspective) of 11-40 mm; a<br><br>
VIII.    PREFERRED METHODS OF FORMING THE SAFETY FILTER ELEMENT<br>
The safety filter element 26 can generally be manufactured in accord with previously applied manufacturing techniques, except for modifications to manage the configuration of the member of the projection/receiver arrangement 88 position on the closed end 101 of the safety element 26. Preferably the closed end 101 of the safety element 26 is formed from a molded plastic, such as urethane having a hardness of 30 Shore D.<br>
Typical methods of preparation, then, would involve assembling the media pack; placing a first end in a mold, with resin, to mold the closed end cap; and placing a second end in a mold, with resin, to form the open end cap.<br>
As to the open end cap having the external directed radial seal thereon, resin capable of forming upon cure, and appropriately soft, compressible polyurethane end cap of the same type as would be used to form the first end cap having the radial seal thereon for the primary element, would generally be preferred. A preferred such material is characterized below.<br>
IX.       PREFERRED MEDIA PACKS<br>
The preferred media pack for the primary and safety element will, in part, depend upon specifications and efficiency needs for the engine or other system involved. Herein, a preferred primary element media pack will be described, which was developed specifically to lead to enhanced performance for certain types of off road construction equipment, farm equipment, and mining equipment, as characterized.<br>
In particular, the following equipment has utilized the Donaldson Radialseabw system for a number of years: Caterpillar tractors, waste handling arrangements, truck loaders, skid steer loaders, pipelayers, excavators, material handlers, front shovels, forest machines, track skidders, compactors, pavers, soil stabilizers, planers, combines, VFS trailers, backhoe loaders, off highway trucks, off highway tractors, skidders, scrapers, and motor graders.<br>
The system installed, however, in that equipment, generally: (1) has not had an alignment system to support or bias the safety element into appropriate<br><br>
It is noted that a variety of alternate constructions of depth media can be provided, for example, multilayered systems, gradient systems, etc. However, the particular construction shown, with specifications as indicated below, leaves a substantial improvement when installed in a previously existing air cleaner. In some arrangements, it may be desirable to secure or support the pleated media 177 with a nairow band around the circumference of the pleat tips. If a band is used, the band will be applied before the outer wrap 178 is placed over the pleated media 177.<br>
Attention is again directed to FIG. 7. FIG. 7 shows the entire media pack 43 as embedded or molded in each of the end caps 41, 42. It can be seen that the sleeve of depth media 178 is tucked into the end cap 41 at tuck 181. Similarly, the opposite end of the sleeve of fibrous depth media 178 is tucked into end cap 42 at tuck 182. In the arrangement shown in FIG. 7, it is contemplated that the entire media pack 43 including both the pleated media 177 and the depth media 178 is embedded in each of the end caps 41, 42 as a total unit, which results in the tucked regions 1S1, 182. In alternative methods of constructions, only the pleated media 177 will be molded within and embedded in the opposite end caps 41, 42.
