MOBILE TELEPHONE SECURITY<br>
TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES LTD.,<br>
an Indian Company<br>
of Bombay House, 24, Sir Homi Mody Street, Mumbai 400 001<br>
Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION.<br><br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The invention relates to the field of mobile telephone security.<br>
Background of Invention:<br>
Mobile telephone service is currently one of the most rapidly expanding types of communication services. The risk of the mobile telephones being cloned has also increased. The industry loses approximately 10 to 20 percent of its annual revenues to mobile cloning fraud. A fraudulent user typically copies authentication information from an original mobile telephone to a cloned phone. When calls are made from a cloned phone they are billed to subscribers of the original phone. For CDMA technology, every mobile handset has a unique factory-coded Electronic Serial Number (ESN) and a Mobile Identification Number (MIN).The ESN/MIN pair can be cloned in a number of ways without the knowledge of the carrier or subscriber through the use of electronic scanning devices. After the ESN/MIN pair is captured, the fraudulent user reprograms or alters the microchip of any wireless phone to create a clone of the wireless phone from which the ESN/MIN pair was stolen. A-Key is a 64 bit code used for mobile security that is permanently programmed on handset and on operator network and is stored in the Authentication Center (AC) of the network. A-Key is not transmitted over air, thus making OTA Interception impossible. But A-key can be cloned using data cable and computer.<br><br><br>
Identity theft is the most serious problem arising out of mobile cloning. A call or SMS from a cloned phone to a wrong person may invite trouble to the actual owner of the phone. A fraudulent user typically copies authentication information from original phone to cloned phone. Now when calls are made from cloned phone they are billed to subscribers of the original phone, resulting in exorbitantly high prices.<br>
US patent 5822691 describes a method for detecting cloned communication units by comparing the last phone number connected as recorded by the radio telephone network with the last phone number connected as recorded in the mobile radio telephone unit.<br>
US patent 5335265 and Japanese patent JP8223650 disclose apparatus and systems for detecting of fraud and cloned mobile telephones using call origin data and time stamp records.<br>
Also US patent 6181925 discloses a method and apparatus for fraud control in a cellular telephone switch. The system monitors calls and identifies both legitimate calls and fraudulent cellular phones using the call origin data and then transmits a message to the switch to terminate the call from the fraudulent phone.<br>
US patent application 20050282529 describes a method for detecting cloned communication units based on message contents.<br><br><br>
Conventional methods typically use voice call detail record and call origin data for comparison. Therefore there is a need for an effective system for detecting cloned calls which is more efficient and detects not only voice calls from cloned mobile telephones but also SMS and data messages.<br>
Objectives of invention:<br>
The object of this invention is to provide system and apparatus for detecting of cloning of mobile telephones.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a system and apparatus for enhancing the security of a mobile telephone subscriber.<br>
Still one more object of this invention is to provide a system and apparatus to minimize the revenue loss incurred by the cellular system operators.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a system and apparatus to avoid monetary loss and loss of reputation.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
The system and apparatus in accordance with this invention envisages means for detecting cloned mobile telephones.<br><br><br>
In accordance with one practical embodiment of this invention, the system and apparatus includes a client side and a server side. The client side comprises a client application running on the handset.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of this invention, the client application comprises a confirmation message logic, voice call record fetch logic, data call record fetch logic and a SMS call record fetch logic. The confirmation message logic is the module which confirms that the call records are not deleted manually. Voice call record fetch logic retrieves the last call from the local Call Detail Record (CDR) and sends it to the server for comparison receives results of the comparison from the server and if a difference is present in the results, then detects that the mobile telephone is cloned. Data call record fetch logic retrieves the last data call from local Internet Protocol Detail Record (IPDR) and sends to server for comparison, receives results of comparison from the server and detects that the mobile phone is cloned if there is a difference in the results. Similarly SMS record fetch logic module retrieves the last SMS from the SMS inbox and sends it to the server for comparison receives the results of comparison from the server and detect that the mobile telephone is cloned if a difference in the results is present. Also the remote communication device or the mobile telephone handset at client side is provided with downloading means to go over the air and execution means for executing the different functions on the handset.<br>
In accordance with one practical embodiment of this invention, the server side of the invention comprises a server with a server side application being executed on it along with a database. The server side unit retrieves the CDR,<br><br><br>
IPDR and SMS from the data center. Server side system compares the above said data with the data received from the client and the results of the comparison are sent to the client for further processing. The server side is provided with Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) that provides access to the Internet, intranets and applications servers for the mobile stations.<br>
In accordance with one practical embodiment of this invention, the system also includes display means for displaying message on the handset at client side. The system also has receiver means at server end to receive request query and interface means to enable connectivity between the client and server sides, processing means at server side for executing the query.<br>
Brief Description of Drawings:<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which<br>
Fig 1 illustrates block diagram of a system and apparatus for detection of mobile cloning.<br>
Fig 2 illustrates flow diagram of working of a system and apparatus for detection of mobile cloning.<br><br><br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings:<br>
