SPECIFICATION<br>
RF-Properties-Optimized Compositions of (RE)Ba2Cu307.8 thin film<br>
Superconductors<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
[0001] This application claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S.<br>
Provisional Application Number 60/639,043, filed December 23,2004.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] This invention relates to thin films of high temperature superconducting<br>
compositions optimized for RF applications and a method for manufacturing them, more<br>
specifically rare earth compositions of (RE)Ba2Cu3O7-8 deviating significantly from the<br>
1:2:3 stoichiometry.<br>
Background of the Invention <br>
[0003] Rare earth oxide superconductors and their ability to superconduct at<br>
significantly higher temperatures than previously recorded was first reported by J.G.<br>
Bednorz and R.A. Muller in 1986 in regard to mixtures of lanthanum, barium, copper and<br>
oxygen in an article entitled "Possible High Tc Superconductivity in the Ba-La-Cu-O<br>
system." (64 Z. Phys. B. - Condensed Matter, ppl89 -193 (1986)). Bednorz and Muller<br>
described Ba-La-Cu-O compositions that offered a substantial increase in the critical<br>
temperature at which the material becomes superconducting over what had been<br>
previously known for other classes of materials. Here, the composition was La5.<br>
xBaxCu5O5(3-y) where x = 0.75-1, y &gt;0, and the abrupt change in resistivity occurred in the<br>
30 Kelvin range.<br>
[0004] This contribution led to intensive investigation in order to develop materials<br>
having even higher transition temperatures, preferably above 77 Kelvin as this enabled the<br>
use of liquid nitrogen to cool the superconducting equipment. In 1987, C.W. Chu and co-<br>
workers at the University of Houston found that the onset Tc of the La-Ba-Cu-0<br>
compound could by increased to over 50 K by the application of pressure. (Phys. Rev.<br>
Lett. 58.405 (1987); Science 235, 567 (1987)).<br>
[0005] Chu and coworkers at Houston and at the University of Alabama subsequently<br>
discovered a mixed-phase Y-Ba-Cu-O system onset having Tc values near 90 K and a<br>
NB 1:672122.1<br><br>
WO 2006/071899	PCT/US2005/047147<br>
2<br>
zero-resistance state at ~70 K. This compound had the nominal composition<br>
Y1.2Ba0.8CuO4-5 (Phys. Rev. Lett. 58,908 (1987). Chu and coworkers as well as scientists<br>
at AT&amp;T and IBM later showed this compound to consist of two phases of nominal<br>
composition Y2BaCuO5 (the "green" phase) and YBa2Cu3O6+x (the "black" phase). The<br>
latter phase was determined to be the superconducting phase, whereas the former was<br>
semiconducting (Cava et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 58,1676 (1987); Hazen et al., Phys. Rev. B<br>
35,7238 (1987); Grant et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 35,7242 (1987).<br>
[0006] Superconductivity near 90 K was also reported in a mixed-phase Lu-Ba-Cu-O<br>
compound by Moodenbaugh and coworkers (Phys. Rev. Lett. 58, 1885 (1987). Chu et al.<br>
also identified superconductivity above 90 K for compounds of the formula ABa2Cu3O6+x,<br>
where A = Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Ho, Er, or Lu (Phys. Rev. Lett. 58,1891 (1987).<br>
[0007] The data from these differing Rare Earth (RE)BCO (RE = rare earth, B = Ba, C<br>
= Cu) compounds demonstrated that for this class of compounds, the superconductivity is<br>
associated with the CuO2-Ba-CuO2-Ba-CuO2 plane assembly which can be disrupted by<br>
the A cations only along the c-axis.<br>
[0008] Following this discovery, research was focused on the YBCO class of<br>
compounds with high temperature superconducting (HTS) properties. B. Satiogg first<br>
discovered and isolated the single crystallographic phase responsible for the<br>
superconducting properties of the YBCO compound. (B.Batlogg, U.S Patent No<br>
6,636,603). In isolating this single perovskite phase of a composition, Batlogg admonished<br>
that the composition was essential to isolation of the phase and that it must be within 10%<br>
of the M2MCU3O7-8 composition where M is a divalent cation preferably barium and M' is<br>
a trivalent cation preferably yttrium.<br>
[0009] Other studies have investigated both the effects of substitution of various rare<br>
earth elements for yttrium and of varying the 1:2:3 ratio of Y:Ba:Cu on the<br>
superconducting properties of HTS compositions. Multiple studies have shown the ability<br>
to partially or completely substitute rare earth elements except Pr, Ce and Tb and maintain<br>
a Tc of approximately 90 K for the resulting (RE)BCO composition. (S. Jin, Physica C<br>
173, pp 75-79 (1991)). Additionally, further studies show that the c-axis coherence length<br>
and the Tc value increase with increasing ionic radius of the rare earth element substituted<br>
for yttrium (G.V.M. Williams, Physica C 258, pp41-46 (1996)).<br>
[0010] Building on these discoveries, P. Chaudhari and his co-workers at IBM developed<br>
a method for making thin films of  high temperature superconducting oxides with a<br>
NBI:672122.1<br><br>
WO 2006/071899	PCT/US2005/047147<br>
3<br>
nominal composition of (RE)(AE)2Cu3O9-y where RE is a rare earth element, AE is an<br>
alkaline earth element and y is sufficient to satisfy valence demands. (Chaudhari, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,863,869 (1999)). The rare earth elements used included Y, Sc and La, and<br>
AE could also be substituted for by Ba, Ca or Sr. Copper was the preferred transition<br>
metal for the oxide due to its high superconducting onset temperature and the smooth,<br>
uniform properties of the copper oxide films. Using this growth process, Chaudhari was<br>
able to obtain YBCO films with superconducting onset temperatures of about 97 Kelvin<br>
that exhibited superconducting behavior from 50 Kelvin to in excess of 77 Kelvin. These<br>
films were within 15% of the targeted (RE)(AE)2Cu3O9-y composition, and Chaudhari<br>
noted that the exact composition was not necessary in order to observe high temperature<br>
superconductivity.<br>
[0011] However, in another study of (RE)BCO cation exchange in thin films, J<br>
MacManus-Driscoll et al. noted that Tc decreased dramatically for off-composition films<br>
with substitutions of rare earth (RE) elements on the Ba site such as RE(Ba2-xREx)Cu3Oy<br>
where RE = Er or Dy and x &gt; 0.1 (14% deviation) and where RE - Ho and x &gt; 0 (any<br>
deviation). (J.L MacManus-Driscoll, Physica C 232, pp 288-308 (1994). J. MacManus-<br>
Driscoll further reported that the oxygen pressure at which the thin films were grown<br>
seemed to have an effect on the structural disordering of the RE and Ba cations as did the<br>
rare earth ion size. Small rare earth cations substituting for the larger Ba cations would<br>
produce large strains on the lattice and therefore an unstable phase which would not likely<br>
occur.<br>
[0012] Another study of varying the 1:2:3 stoichiometry of YBCO thin films noted that<br>
large excesses of yttrium formed ultra small yttrium precipitates leading to increased<br>
surface resistance (R5) and poor microwave quality but that a slightly enhanced copper and<br>
yttrium content lead to minimum surface resistance (E. Waffenschmidt, J. Appl. Phys. 77<br>
(1) pg 438-440). Furthermore, N.G. Chew et al. analyzed the effect of slight changes in<br>
composition on YBCO thin film structural and electrical properties and discovered that<br>
films grown with a stoichiometry close to 1:2:3 or with excess yttrium are smooth while<br>
films with excess barium exhibited surface roughness and growth of a-axis-oriented<br>
grains. (N. Chew, Appl. Phys. Lett. 57 (19) pp 2016-2018 (1990). These authors further<br>
found that there is a well defined YBCO composition where Tc and Jc are maximized and<br>
the c-axis lattice constant, (007) x-ray peak width, and surface roughness are minimized.<br>
These quantities were optimized for a Ba/Y ratio of 2.22 ± 0.05 (subsequently suggested<br>
NBI:672122.1<br><br>
WO 2006/071899	PCT/US2005/047147<br>
4<br>
to instead be equal to 2) and a Cu/(Y+Ba+Cu) ratio of 0.5. Slight changes in cation ratios<br>
away from this optimized composition caused significant degradation in the parameters<br>
listed above.<br>
[0013] W. Prusseit et al. have created an iso-structural Dy-BCO thin film material with<br>
improved properties compared to their YBCO films. By substituting dysprosium for<br>
yttrium and growing under identical conditions as YBCO, Prusseit created films that<br>
deviated only slightly from the 1:2:3 stoichiometry. Compared to their YBCO films, these<br>
materials exhibited better chemical stability and enhanced transition temperatures (by 2-3<br>
K), and they also had a 20% reduction in surface resistance (R5) at 77 K: ~250 mW vs.<br>
-300 mW at 10 GHz, measured in a microwave cavity (W. Prusseit, Physica C 392-396, pp<br>
1225-1228 (2003)). Hein (High-Temperature Superconductor Thin Films at Microwave<br>
Frequencies (Springer Tracts in Modem Physics, 155), Berlin, 1999) and others have<br>
measured somewhat lower surface resistance, ~200 mW at 10 GHz and 77 K, in cavity<br>
measurements of YBCO thin films.<br>
[0014] The compositions of these (RE)BCO compounds may be altered substantially<br>
from the nominal 1:2:3 stoichiometry in order to optimize their properties for specific<br>
applications. It is the primary object of this invention to provide high temperature<br>
superconducting thin films that have the lowest possible RF surface resistance (R5,) values<br>
as well as the lowest achievable RF nonlinearities. This often requires fabrication of<br>
(RE)BCO films that deviate significantly from the 1:2:3 composition. It is another object<br>
of this invention to provide a thin film superconductor that is optimized for RF/microwave<br>
applications. It is another object of this invention that the film has a low surface resistance.<br>
It is another object of this invention that the film has a highly linear RF/microwave surface<br>
reactance. It is another object of this invention that the stoichiometry of the film deviates<br>
by at least 10% from the standard 1:2:3 stoichiometry and with full substitution for yttrium<br>
by a rare earth element.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0015]     The films of this invention are high temperature superconducting (HTS) thin<br>
films specifically optimized for microwave and RF applications. The prior art (RE)BCO<br>
NB1:672122.1<br><br>
WO 2006/071899	-	PCT/US2005/047147<br>
5<br>
films exhibiting high temperature superconducting properties were nominally of the<br>
composition (RE)xBayCu3O7-8 where RE = a rare earth element, preferably yttrium, x = 1,<br>
y = 2 and 0 ≤ 5 ≤1. This 1:2:3 stoichiometry has since been the focus of much study<br>
including varying the rare earth element, full and partial substitutions for RE, for Ba, and<br>
for Cu, oxygen doping, and deviations from the 1:2:3 stoichiometry.<br>
[0016] The present invention focuses on RE HTS films specifically optimized for<br>
microwave and RF applications. The RF/microwave HTS applications require the HTS<br>
thin films to have superior microwave properties, specifically low surface resistance, Rs,<br>
and highly linear surface reactance, X5,, i.e. high JIMD- As such, the invention is<br>
characterized in terms of its physical composition, surface morphology, superconducting<br>
properties, and performance characteristics of microwave circuits made from these films<br>
[0017] In particular, this invention focuses on compositions having a significant<br>
deviation from the 1:2:3 stoichiometry in order to create the films optimized for<br>
microwave/RF applications. These films have a RE:Ba ratio of less than 1.8, which<br>
deviates more than 10% from the typical ratio of 2, and preferably less than 1.7. The<br>
research has shown that the highest quality factor values, Q, representing the surface<br>
resistance of patterned films, peak at a particular Ba:RE ratio for each RE and that these<br>
ratios deviate significantly from the 1:2:3 stoichiometry.<br>
[0018] Additionally, the performance characteristics of the HTS films naturally affect<br>
their efficacy in RF/microwave HTS applications. Specifically desirable are low surface<br>
resistance, R5, (
reactance, Xs, i.e., high JIMD values (&gt;107 A/cm2, preferably &gt;5 x 107 A/cm2 at 77 K). HTS<br>
thin films with such properties permit the fabrication of extremely selective filters (60-dB<br>
rejection within 0.2% relative frequency, to 100-dB rejection within 0.02% relative<br>
frequency, with extremely low in-band insertion loss (
extremely small size (
levels experienced at the front end of a cellular telephone base station receiver (-50 dBm<br>
to -28 dBm, to as high as -12 dBm to 0 dBm or possibly even higher) without producing<br>
undesirable distortion in the passband, particularly intermodulation distortion, and more<br>
particularly intermodulation distortion products comparable to background noise levels (-<br>
173.8 dBm/Hz). Thus, the films of this invention are also characterized by their optimized<br>
microwave and RF properties. These and other objects, features and advantages will be<br>
apparent from the following more particular description of the preferred embodiments.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0053] As previously mentioned, this invention relates to high temperature<br>
superconducting (HTS) thin films with compositions that are optimized for RF/microwave<br>
applications and methods for reliably producing such films. As such, the invention is<br>
characterized in terms of its physical composition, surface morphology, superconducting<br>
properties, and performance characteristics of microwave circuits made from these films<br>
(filters, delay lines, couplers, etc.; particularly bandpass and bandreject filters, more<br>
particularly bandpass and bandreject preselector filters for cellular telephone base station<br>
receivers). The distinction between HTS (RE)BCO films of the prior art and the (RE)BCO<br>
films of this invention is found both in the composition that deviates significantly from the<br>
1 -.2:3 stoichiometry and the highly optimized RF properties of the new composition.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0054] For our purposes, a thin film may be defined as a layer (generally, very thin) of<br>
a material that is grown, deposited, or otherwise applied to a suitable supporting substrate.<br>
The thickness of this film may range from about one nm (10-9 m) to several microns (&gt;l0-6<br>

10<br>
m) thick, The typical range of thin film thickness for many applications is from 100 nm to<br>
1000 nm.<br>
[0055] High temperature superconductors (HTS) encompass a broad class of ceramic<br>
materials, typically oxides, more typically copper oxides or cuprates, that have a transition<br>
temperature or critical temperature, Tc, below which these materials are superconducting.<br>
Above this critical temperature, they generally behave as metallic, or "normal,"<br>
conducting materials. HTS materials are further generally characterized as having Tc<br>
values above about 30 K. Examples of HTS materials include La2CaCu206,<br>
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8, YBa2Cu3O7, Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8, HgBa2CaCu2O7, etc. These materials must<br>
have a well-defined crystal structure in order to be superconducting, i.e., they must have a<br>
very specific regular and repeated arrangement of their constituent atoms.<br>
[0056] The rare earth (RE) elements are the 15 lanthanide elements with atomic<br>
numbers 57 through 71 that are in Group IIIA of the Periodic Table: lanthanum, cerium,<br>
praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium,<br>
dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium. Yttrium (atomic number<br>
39), a Group IIIA transition metal, although not a lanthanide is generally included with the<br>
REs as it occurs with them in natural minerals and has similar chemical properties.<br>
Commonly included with the REs because of their similar properties are scandium (atomic<br>
number 21), also a Group IIIA transition metal, and thorium (atomic number 90), an<br>
element in the actinide series of the Periodic Table.<br>
Composition<br>
[0057] The most ubiquitous HTS material is YBCO, which consists of an ordered<br>
amount and arrangement of Y, Ba, Cu, and O atoms. The fundamental repeated unit of this<br>
material's specific atomic arrangement is known as the unit cell, consisting nominally of<br>
one Y, two Ba, three Cu, and seven O atoms. The size of this compound's orthorhombic<br>
unit cell is about 3.82 x 3.89 x 11.68 Angstroms in the a-, b-, and c-axis directions,<br>
respectively. The atomic ratios needed to form this compound are described by the<br>
chemical formula YBa2Cu3O7-8, where the oxygen content is variable between 6 and 7<br>
atoms per unit cell, or 0 ≤, 6 ≤ 1. For single-phase materials with this composition and<br>
having high crystalline quality and purity, the revalue is determined largely by the value<br>
of S. YBCO is a superconductor for d 
preferred in order to provide the highest Tc values.<br>

11<br>
[0058] YBCO is the most widely studied HTS material, and much is known about how<br>
to make it in single phase form, i.e., consisting of solely the composition mentioned above<br>
and containing no other phases. However, many other similar compounds can also be<br>
fabricated that may have similar or superior superconducting properties, depending on the<br>
application. These compounds may have Y:Ba:Cu ratios that are different from 1:2:3, and<br>
they may also consist of elements other than Y or Ba. A generalized nomenclature for the<br>
makeup of this compound may thus be written as M'xMyCu3O7-8, where M' may in general<br>
be any essentially trivalent ion or combination of ions, and M may be any essentially<br>
divalent ion or combination of ions. The ratios of M':Cu, M:Cu, and M':M may also vary<br>
substantially from the nominal values of 1:3, 2:3, and 1:2, respectively. While the full<br>
range of parameter space has not been explored, it is reasonable to believe that compounds<br>
with cation ratios deviating from the nominal by as much as 50% may still be<br>
superconductors, e.g. 1:6 
However, significantly altering the composition from the 1:2:3 stoichiometry does affect<br>
the specific properties of the composition including critical current density (Jc), normal-<br>
state resistivity (p), critical temperature (Te), and surface resistance (R5).<br>
[0059] In order to provide high Tc values, Ba is generally preferred as the divalent<br>
element, or M in the above formula. Full or partial substitutions of many elements for Ba<br>
tend to decrease Tc or destroy superconductivity altogether. These elements include Sr, La,<br>
Pr and Eu. (Y. Xu, Physica C 341-348, pp 613-4 (2000) and X.S. Wu, Physica C 315, pp<br>
215-222 (1999). Similarly, the Cu atoms may be doped with Co, Zn, Mi, etc., the effect of<br>
most of which is to decrease Tc, though the absolute effect (e.g., charge transfer or<br>
disruption of superconductivity on the Cu-0 planes) depends on whether the Cu(l) or<br>
Cu(2) sites are affected. (Y. Xu, Phys. Rev. B Vol 53, No. 22, pp 15245-15253 (1996).<br>
Some partial substitutions on the Y sites may have a similar effect, such as Ca, Ce, and Pr<br>
(L. Tung, Phys. Rev. B Vol 59, No. 6, pp 4504-4512 (1999) and C.R. Fincher, Phys. Rev.<br>
Lett. 67 (20) pp 2902-2905 (1991)). However, there are many known partial or complete<br>
substitutions for Y that lead to similarly high or greater Te values than YBCO. Many of<br>
these known substitutions come from the rare earth family of elements. In general, rare<br>
earth elements that have a larger ionic radius produce higher Tc values for these (RE)BCO<br>
compounds (G.V.M. Williams, Physica C 258, pp41-46 (1996)).<br>
[0060]     While it is key to maintain the defining property of superconductivity across the<br>
range of compositions available for these related compounds, our research has shown that<br>
NB1:672122.1<br><br>
WO 2006/071899	PCT/US2005/047147<br>
12<br>
the compositions may be altered substantially from the nominal 1:2:3 stoichiometry in<br>
order to tailor their properties for specific applications. For example, compositions near<br>
1:2:3 may be preferred for multilayer or active device applications for which smooth thin<br>
film surfaces are of paramount importance. Conversely, optimization of HTS films for RF<br>
applications requires the production of thin films that strike a balance between having the<br>
lowest possible RF surface resistance (R,) values and the lowest RF nonlinearities that are<br>
achievable. This in turn often requires the fabrication of (RE)BCO films that deviate<br>
significantly from the 1:2:3 composition.<br>
[0061] The HTS thin films of this invention are optimized for RF applications, and as such<br>
they have the lowest possible RF surface resistance (R5) values and the lowest possible RF<br>
nonlinearities. In order to achieve this optimization, the film compositions have the<br>
nominal formula (RE)xBayCu3O7-8 where RE is one of the previously defined rare earth<br>
elements, preferably Dy, and where the ratio yvx is preferably between about 1.5 - 1.8,<br>
more preferably between about 1.55-1.75, and most preferably between about 1.6 - 1.7.<br>
Substrates<br>
[0062]     The superconducting properties of IITS materials are extremely sensitive to<br>
their degree of crystalline perfection. This places severe constraints on the choice of a<br>
suitable substrate material on which high-quality HTS films may be grown. Some of these<br>
constraints include crystal structure, compatibility with the growth process, chemical<br>
compatibility, compatibility with the application, as well as other requirements imposed by<br>
nature.<br>
[0063]     Perhaps the most important requirement is the crystal structure. The substrate<br>
must have an appropriate lattice match with the HTS film such that epitaxial growth of the<br>
film can occur and a well-oriented film will form. A poor lattice match can lead to<br>
dislocations, defects, and misoriented grains in the film. In general, the substrate should be<br>
available in single-crystal form in order to meet these requirements.<br>
[0064]     The substrate must be able to withstand the high processing temperatures during<br>
the growth process that are required for the crystallization of the HTS compound. In<br>
addition, structural integrity and a reasonable thermal expansion match with the HTS film<br>
is required in order to prevent strain and cracking of the film during the cool down cycle<br>
from the growth temperature or from any other subsequent thermal cyclings.<br>
NB1:672I22.1<br><br>
WO 2006/071899		PCT/US2005/047147<br>
13<br>
[0065]     The substrate must be chemically compatible with (RE)BCO, non-reactive, and<br>
with minimal diffusion into the film at high temperature.<br>
[00661 The substrate must be available in a size large enough for the intended use of<br>
the HTS thin film. For example, certain passive microwave circuits or high-volume<br>
electronics applications require a large substrate size. A minimum substrate of 2" in<br>
diameter is typical for these applications, though larger sizes are often desirable if<br>
available. The substrate may also be required to have physical properties that are<br>
compatible with experimental measurement techniques or applications. For most<br>
applications the substrates should be stable, mechanically robust insulators. Other<br>
requirements may include transparency in the infrared for optical transmission<br>
measurements, constituent elements or structure that do not interfere with spectroscopic<br>
measurements such as Rutherford backscattering (RBS) or energy-dispersive x-ray<br>
analysis (EDX), and a low dielectric constant and loss tangent for microwave<br>
measurements and applications at the intended temperature of operation.<br>
[0067] A handful of single-crystal substrates meet some or all of these requirements.<br>
Examples include MgO, AI2O3, LaA1O3, NdGaO3, (La0.18Sr0.82)(Al0.59Ta0.41)O3, and<br>
SrTiO3. The last four have an excellent lattice match to (RE)BCO. The high dielectric<br>
constant and loss tangent of SrTiO3 make it useless for microwave applications, however.<br>
LaA1O3 and NdGaO3 are better in this regard, though LaA1O3 suffers from the fact that it<br>
tends to twin, and these twin boundaries can be formed and become mobile at typical<br>
processing temperatures. AI2O3 is a low-loss substrate and is widely available in several<br>
different orientations and sizes. However, it reacts strongly with (RE)BCO at high<br>
temperatures, requiring the use of an appropriate buffer layer. In addition, A12O3 has a<br>
poor thermal expansion match to (RE)BCO, causing a tendency for the films to crack upon<br>
cooldown. MgO has relatively low loss and a good thermal expansion match to (RE)BCO,<br>
making it a good choice for RF applications. However, MgO has a much larger lattice<br>
mismatch than the other examples listed above, so that great care must be taken to insure<br>
that the (RE)BCO films grown on MgO are well oriented. In particular, it is relatively<br>
common for (RE)BCO films grown on MgO to contain in-plane-rotated grains and 45°<br>
grain boundaries. (B.H. Moeckly, Appl. Phys. Lett. 57,1687-89 (1990). The minimization<br>
of the amount of these high-angle grain boundaries is mandatory for good microwave<br>
performance, particularly for high RF linearity. Certain MgO substrate surface treatments<br>
may be instituted to help control the number of high-angle grain boundaries, but greater<br>

14<br>
effort is required to further suppress formation of these grain boundaries, particularly for<br>
demanding RF applications. The growth method, growth conditions, and particularly the<br>
composition of the (RE)BCO films must all be chosen and adjusted to minimize the<br>
amount of 45° grains in films grown on MgO.<br>
Film morphology and microstructure<br>
[0068] The anisotropic transport properties of (RE)BCO, its orthorhombic crystal<br>
structure, and its small superconductive coherence length mean that the (RE)BCO films<br>
must have excellent crystalline structure and orientation. This is particularly true in order<br>
to obtain good microwave properties. Hence, the films must be substantially free of<br>
secondary phases, they must possess good epitaxy both in-plane (parallel to the substrate<br>
surface) and out-of-plane (perpendicular to the substrate surface). Typically, the c-axis of<br>
(RE)BCO is aligned perpendicular to the substrate surface. All the grains in the film must<br>
be so aligned, and they must be highly aligned with respect to one another. The degree of<br>
this crystalline order is typically characterized by q-2q x-ray diffraction scans, where the<br>
requirements are the existence of only oaxis-oriented (00l) spectral lines having narrow<br>
peak widths, and also narrow peak widths of the so-called w-scan, or rocking curve scan<br>
about a given Bragg angle. The q-2q measurement can also detect the presence of spectral<br>
lines due to a-axis-oriented grains within the film. These grains may also be detected by a<br>
c-scan about an appropriate Bragg angle.<br>
[0069] For a thin film with good microwave properties, the amount of a-axis grains in<br>
the film is ideally zero, so that the intensity of a-axis x-ray peaks relative to c-axis x-ray<br>
peaks for a c-axis-oriented film is ideally zero, and preferably much less than 1%. In<br>
addition, the c-axis-oriented grains should also be in-plane oriented, meaning that they are<br>
in registry with each other and with the substrate crystal structure. Grains that are rotated<br>
with respect to the overall in-plane lattice structure lead to nonzero-degree angle grain<br>
boundaries. The superconducting transport across such nonzero-angle grain boundaries, in<br>
particular high-angle grain boundaries and 45° grain boundaries, is degraded likely due to<br>
strain, the high oxygen mobility, and small coherence length of (RE)BCO (B. H. Moeckly<br>
et al., Phys. Rev. B 47, 400 (1993). Jc, Rs, and the RF nonlinearities may all be adversely<br>
affected by the presence of these high-angle grain boundaries. The presence of these<br>
rotated grains and grain boundaries may be detected by j-scan x-ray measurements taken<br>

about an appropriate Bragg angle. Ideally, the amount of nonaligned j-scan peaks should<br>
be zero, and preferably less than 0.1% of the magnitude of the aligned peaks, more<br>
preferably less than 0.05%, and most preferably less than 0.02%.<br>
[0070] Fig, 1 shows the q-2q scans for several 700-nm-thick (RE)BCO films made by<br>
us and optimized for RF applications. In addition to YBCO, these films include RE<br>
substitutions of Er (EBCO), Ho (HBCO), Dy (DBCO), and Nd (NBCO). The x-ray scans<br>
display the presence of only (00l) peaks, indicating that the films are single-phase and<br>
highly c-axis aligned, and that no a-axis-oriented grains exist in the films. Note that the<br>
relative peak intensities of the (RE)BCO films are different from YBCO, indicative of the<br>
effect of the different RE ionic radii. Fig. 2 shows the (005) peak positions vs. the Ba/RE<br>
ratio for several (RE)BCO films with different compositions, indicating slightly different<br>
c-axis lattice parameters for these films. Fig. 3 shows the intensities of the (005) peaks for<br>
these films. Fig. 31 shows the intensities of the (005) peaks for DBCO films of varying<br>
compositions as a function of the Ba/Dy ratio. These DBCO films are inclusive of those<br>
shown in Fig. 3, but are not necessarily optimized for RF properties. Here, it is observed<br>
that high peak intensities, indicative of good crystallinity, are obtained for DBCO film<br>
compositions that deviate significantly from the on-stochiometric ratio indicated by the<br>
solid line on the graph. Fig. 4 shows representative j-scans of the (103) peak for several<br>
(RE)BCO films (left hand panels). Note that any peaks at 45° are absent, indicating an<br>
absence of 45° oriented grains and grain boundaries. Fig. 5 shows a higher sensitivity j<br>
scan for one of our Dy-BCO films. The y-axis is plotted on a log scale, and it can be seen<br>
that only very weak peaks occur at 45° relative to the main peak. This scan indicates the<br>
degree to which this film is free from high-angle grain boundaries. The intensity of the<br>
weak lines at 45° is only about 0.012% of the maximum central peak indicating that almost<br>
none of the grains are misaligned. This is important for optimization of the RF properties<br>
of these films, most notably their RF nonlinearities. The right-hand panel of Fig. 4<br>
displays the c-scans for (RE)BCO films taken about the (104) peak; as indicated in Fig. 1,<br>
these scans also demonstrate the absence of a-axis-oriented grains.<br>
[0071] The surface morphology of (RE)BCO thin films is typically measured by<br>
scanning probe profilometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron<br>
microscopy (SEM). In general, smooth films are preferred for applications, though some<br>
degree of surface roughness may be tolerated in deference to the optimization of other<br>
NBl:672122.l<br><br>

16<br>
important properties such as Jc and R5. Still, it is desirable to have an RMS surface<br>
roughness as determined by AFM, say, which is less than -10 nm.<br>
[0072] Figs. 6-9 show typical AFM images of Dy-, Ho-, Er-, and Nd-BCO films over a<br>
5 mm x 5 mm area. These films have been optimized in terms of their RF properties. The<br>
RMS surface roughness for these films is a few nm. Fig. 6 shows the surface morphology<br>
for a high- DBCO film with very low RF nonlinearities. The grain size of this film can<br>
be seen to be roughly 2 um in diameter. We also observe some sub-micrometer-sized<br>
particles on the surface of the films, seen as the bright dots in the figure. EDX analysis<br>
indicates a high Cu signal for these particles, implying that they composed of Cu oxide.<br>
The grains for the HBCO film of Fig. 7 have a smaller, squarer appearance, and this film<br>
has a general absence of CuO particulates. The optimized EBCO surface depicted in Fig. 8<br>
has a smaller grain size still, and in this case there also exist CuO particulates. The grains<br>
of the NBCO film of Fig. 9 are also square in appearance and have a size of less than 0.5<br>
mm. The different surface morphologies for these optimized (RE)BCO films are in general<br>
reflections of the different composition and growth conditions needed to achieve the best<br>
RF properties for the different RE substitutions.<br>
Film Characterization Methodology<br>
[0073] The (RE)BCO films are further characterized by measuring their composition<br>
and their electrical properties, including the dc resistivity (p) as a function of temperature<br>
[p(T)], Tc value and transition width, critical current density (Je), and RF surface resistance<br>
(Rs). The films are also subsequently patterned into RF circuits for which we measure the<br>
unloaded quality factor (Q) values, intermodulation distortion (IMD), and nonlinear<br>
critical current density (JIMD).<br>
[0074] The composition of the films of this invention was measured using Rutherford<br>
backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP).<br>
These techniques are both capable of a high degree of accuracy and precision, though<br>
achieving a measurement accuracy of la or 2c equal to 1% is a difficult task and requires<br>
more care than is the norm for these techniques. In the RBS analysis technique, fast, light<br>
ions (typically He ions or alpha particles) are accelerated toward the sample; some of these<br>
ions are backscattered due to Rutherford (Coulomb) scattering from atomic nuclei within<br>
the sample, and the energy spectrum of those backscattered particles is analyzed. The ion<br>
NB1:672122.I<br><br>
WO 2006/071899	PCT/US2005/047147<br>
17<br>
energies are typically in the range of several hundred to several thousand keV, and the<br>
energy of a backscattered ion depends on the mass of the target atom with which it has<br>
collided. Thus, the energy spectrum of the backscattered ions allows identification of the<br>
elements comprising the sample and their ratios (stoichiometry). In addition, as the<br>
incident ions traverse the sample, they lose energy due to inelastic scattering with<br>
electrons. This energy loss occurs in a known way and therefore allows determination of<br>
sample composition as a function of depth. However, for thick films, the spectral peaks of<br>
the measured constituent elements can overlap, requiring careful fitting of the spectra to<br>
extract the composition, and this procedure involves uncertainty and can introduce error.<br>
Therefore, in order to obtain the highest accuracy by simply counting the number of<br>
counts under each peak, sufficiently thin films must be used so that the peaks due to RE,<br>
Ba, and Cu can be completely separated. We have grown sufficiently thin (RE)BCO films<br>
for this purpose, and the results of these measurements have shown a compositional<br>
accuracy of 2o ≤ ±1%. "Note that this measurement technique is quantitative and does not<br>
require the use of a comparison standard.<br>
(0075] In the ICP technique, the thin films are digested in an acidic solution which is then<br>
introduced into a high-temperature (up to 10,000 °C) plasma discharge. Tne plasma<br>
ionizes and excites the constituent atoms in the solution, and as these atoms decay to a<br>
lower energy state, they emit light of a characteristic wavelength that can be detected by a<br>
high-resolution spectrometer. This is the so-called ICP-AES (atomic emission or optical<br>
emission spectroscopy) technique. ICP hence permits measurement of multiple elements<br>
simultaneously. ICP-AES has detection limits typically at the mg/L level in aqueous<br>
solutions. This technique can be very accurate and precise; an accuracy of 10 
obtainable with careful measurement. The method requires the use of a comparison<br>
standard. It does not have an accuracy limitation as a function of thin film thickness,<br>
however, as does RBS. Hence in testing our compositions, we have used RBS and ICP<br>
together. First, we have made careful RBS measurements on very thin films in order to<br>
determine their composition to a high degree of accuracy. We have then confirmed that the<br>
ICP measurements on these same samples agree with the RBS numbers. This allows us to<br>
have confidence that the ICP-AES measurement of thicker (RE)BCO films shares this<br>
same degree of desired accuracy, i.e., 1 o 
[0076] The dc resistivity p is measured by a standard four-point-probe technique. The<br>
room-temperature resistivity of high-quality (RE)BCO films is typically between 150 and<br>

300 mW cm, though this value varies as a function of RE element and of film composition.<br>
Fig. 10 shows the room-temperature (300 K) resistivity values of several (RE)BCO films<br>
as a rimction of composition, specifically the Ba/RE ratio. Fig. 32 shows the room-<br>

These DBCO films are inclusive of those shown in Fig. 10, but are not necessarily<br>
optimized for RF properties Here, it is observed that the room temperature resistivity<br>
values indicative of high quality films are obtained for DBCO film compositions that<br>
deviate significantly from the on-stochiometric ratio (indicated by the solid line on the<br>
graph), particularly within Ba/Dy ratios ranging between about 1.5-1.8, with particularly<br>
good resistivity values achieved for a Ba/Dy ratio of 1.76. The temperature dependence of<br>
the resistivity is shown in Figs. 11-14 for several (RE)BCO films. The temperature<br>
dependence of p for good films is typically linear or slightly downwardly bowed<br>
indicative of so-called overdoped behavior, as these plots indicate. The measurement of<br>
p(T) is also used to determine both the width (in temperature) of the transition to the<br>
superconducting state and the zero-resistance Tc value. The detail of the superconducting<br>
transition region of these films is shown in the inset of Figs. 11-14. The Tc values for<br>
(RE)BCO films are typically between 87 and 91 K (Figs. 11-13), though the higher ionic<br>
radius RE substitutions may have Tc values as high as 95 K, as shown for the NBCO film<br>
in Fig. 14. The transition from the normal state to superconducting state typically occurs<br>
within 0.5 K for high quality films, as the figures indicate.<br>
[0077] The Tc values of the (RE)BCO samples prepared by the process of this<br>
invention are 88.5(5), 88.9(5), 89,2(5), 89.6(5), and 94.5(8) K for Er, Y, Ho, Dy, and Nd,<br>
respectively. These values were measured immediately following deposition. Since the<br>
films are oxygen overdoped as judged by the slope of the R-T curves, the measured Tc<br>
values are slightly lower than the highest values known for these compounds. Fig. 15 plots<br>
the Tc values for different compositions of our Ho-, Er-, and Dy-BCO films. Fig. 33 plots<br>
the Tc values for different compositions of additional DBCO films. These DBCO films are<br>
inclusive of those shown in Fig. 15, but are not necessarily optimized for RF properties. It<br>
can be seen that high Tc values are obtained even for compositions deviating substantially<br>
from the on-stoichiometric (1:2:3) value, indicated by the solid vertical line.<br>
[0078] The RF surface resistance of (RE)BCO thin films may be measured in a number of<br>
ways, including cavity or parallel plate resonator techniques using bulk (unpatterned)<br>
films. R5 is typically measured at frequencies between a few hundred MHz and 10s of<br>

19<br>
GHz. R5, may also be extracted from the Q measurements of patterned resonators of<br>
various kinds, e.g., microstrip, quasi-lumped element, etc. Extraction of R5, from the<br>
measured Q values of these structures requires careful modeling of the resonator<br>
performance to determine the geometric parameter TQ. The relationship between Rs and Q<br><br>
depends only on the resonator geometry, and Q is the measured unloaded quality factor of<br>
the resonator. The extracted R5, value of patterned structures is typically higher than the Rs<br>
value obtained by direct measurement of the bulk films in an RF cavity. This may be<br>
caused by patterning the film, which may introduce defects that can add additional<br>
Tesistive RF losses in the Q measurement. It may also arise from uncertainties in rQ or the<br>
non-uniformity of the current density in microstrip resonators which is generally not<br>
present in bulk film measurement systems.<br>
Device Performance Characterization<br>
[0079] For evaluation of the RF properties of our (RE)BCO films and for determining<br>
the utility of these materials for microwave filter applications, we have fabricated<br>
microwave resonators and filters from these films. These passive devices require a ground<br>
plane and hence necessitate depositing double-sided films. Quasi-lumped element<br>
resonators were patterned using standard photolithographic processing and inert ion<br>
etching. The geometry of our test resonator is shown in Fig. 16. The materials are<br>
characterized by measuring the unloaded quality factor, Qu of this standard test resonator<br>
which has a center frequency of about 1.85 GHz at 77 K for (RJE)BCO resonators<br>
patterned on MgO substrates. The Qu was measured for a range of composition and growth<br>
conditions of each (RE)BCO material, and the growth conditions and composition of each<br>
material were optimized to achieve maximum Qu. We have demonstrated Qu values that<br>
are sufficient for cellular microwave applications for Dy-BCO, Er-BCO, Ho-BCO and Nd-<br>
BCO thin films. Indeed, for 700-nm-thick films, we have achieved unloaded Q values over<br>
40,000 at 1.85 GHz, 67 K, and -10 dBm input power for our test resonator structure using<br>
each of these materials. We subsequently extracted the R5, value of the films by modeling<br>
the electromagnetic field distribution of the resonator geometry. Good R, values for<br>

microwave applications are less than -15 mW at 1.85 GHz and 77 K, and more preferably<br>
less than -10 mW, and most preferably less than about 8 mW.<br>
[0080] Fig. 17 shows the unloaded g of our (RE)BCO lumped-element microwave<br>
resonators vs. the relative Ba/RE ratio. These measurements were made at 67 K and -10<br>
dBm input power. The Qu values of these films are slightly lower than our highest gs<br>
obtained with YBCO films. The dotted line at Ba/RE = 2 represents the on-stoichiometric<br>
value of the 1:2:3 compound. It can be seen that the highest g values are obtained away<br>
from this ratio. OurNd-BCO films display higher Qu values at 67 K, reaching 80,000 (not<br>
shown on this plot), comparable to the highest gs obtained with YBCO films. At 77 K, the<br>
g values of Nd-BCO films can exceed those of YBCO. Although there is scatter in the<br>
data, the trend for all three materials shown in Fig. 17 is similar. There exists for each<br>
(RE)BCO film a value of the Ba:RE ratio for which the Q is maximal, and the g values<br>
drop for ratios away from the maximum in a similar way for each RE element. Fig. 18<br>
shows these Qu values measured as a function of the RE/Cu ratio, and Fig. 19 plots these<br>
data as a function of Ba/Cu. The dotted lines indicate the on-stoichiometric ratios of these<br>
quantities, and it is again observed that high g values are obtained for compositions that<br>
deviate significantly from these nominal ratios. Table I displays the maximum Qu values<br>
obtained for test resonators made from our (RE)BCO films measured at 67 K and 77 K for<br>
an input power of -10 dBm. This table also shows the R5, values that we have calculated<br>
from these Qu values.<br>
[0081] Fig. 27 displays additional data on the unloaded quality factor (Qu) as a function<br>
of the Ba/Dy ratio for different compositions of the various DBCO thin films indicated.<br>
These DBCO films are inclusive of those shown in Fig. 17, but are not necessarily<br>
optimized for RF properties. Hence whereas Fig. 17 represents the best Q values<br>
obtainable at each composition, Fig. 27 shows a range of g values at each composition,<br>
because other properties of the films may not be optimized, e.g., growth temperature, film<br>
thickness, surface morphology, or crystallinity. These Qu values were measured at a<br>
temperature of 67 K and input power of -10 dBm for lumped-element RF resonators<br>
having a center frequency of about 1.85 GHz. The solid line at Ba/Dy = 2 represents the<br>
on-stoichiometric value of the 1:2:3 compound. It is again observed that the highest Q<br>
values are obtained for compositions that deviate significantly from the on-stoichiometric<br>
ratio, particularly for Ba/Dy ratios between about 1.5-1.8, more particularly peaking at<br>
between about the 1.6-1.7 ratio. Fig. 28 displays the unloaded quality factor (Qu) as a<br>
NB1.672122.1<br><br>
WO 2006/071899	PCT/US2005/047147<br>
21<br>
function of the Ba/Dy ratio for the same DBCO thin films of varying compositions<br>
measured at a temperature of 77 K and input power of -10 dBm. While there is more<br>
scatter in the data at this temperature which is nearer Tc the data still clearly show that the<br>
highest Q values are obtained for compositions that deviate significantly from the on-<br>
stoichiometric ratio, particularly for Ba/Dy ratios between about 1.5-1.8, more particularly<br>
peaking around the 1.6 ratio.<br>
[0082] The Q values of (RE)BCO filters can degrade as a function of increasing input<br>
power. The ability of (RE)BCO filters to maintain high Q values as a function of<br>
increasing input power is an important requirement for high performance filter systems.<br>
Fig. 29 displays the ratio of unloaded Q values at 67 K measured at high (+10 dBm) and<br>
low (-10 dBm) input powers for resonators made from DBCO film of different<br>
composition. High values of Q+10dBm / Q-10dBm indicate better power handling capability<br>
and superior performance. It can be seen that increasingly higher ratios are obtained as the<br>
DBCO composition deviates further from the on-stoichiometric value (Ba/Dy = 2),<br>
indicated by the solid vertical line. Fig. 30 plots the ratio of Q measured at high power to<br>
low power at 77 K for several DBCO films of varying composition. This figure also shows<br>
that excellent power handling is obtained even for compositions that deviate substantially<br>
from the on-stoichiometric value.<br>
[0083] The input power levels to the (RE)BCO filter also affects their performance by<br>
generating different amounts of intermodulation distortion, as described below.<br>
[0084] We further evaluated these materials by growing thin films on 2" MgO<br>
substrates and patterning them into 10-pole filter circuits of a type suitable for commercial<br>
cellular communications applications. Fig. 20 shows a layout of the filter design. The<br>
filters were tuned, and their performance was evaluated in terms of insertion loss, return<br>
loss, and out-of-band rejection. In addition, we used these 10-pole filters to measure the<br>
nonlinear properties of these materials in terms of their third-order intermodulation<br>
distortion (IMD). A block diagram of the test setup is shown in Fig. 21. For these<br>
measurements, tones of equal power at two different closely-spaced frequencies// and/2<br>
were combined and applied to the filter at specific power levels. The location of these<br>
input tones is in-band, far from the band edge, or close to the band edge. The output power<br>
of the third-order mixing product at frequency 2f1 — f2 is then measured in a spectrum<br>
analyzer. The magnitude of the output signal from the filter at these frequencies is an<br>
important measure of the RF nonlinearities of the filter and determines its suitability for<br>
NB1:672122.1<br><br>
WO 2006/071899	PCT/US2005/047147<br>
22<br>
many microwave applications. The presence of intermodulation distortion reflects the<br>
current density dependence of the surface reactance, X5,, of the superconducting thin film<br>
(T. Dahm &amp; D.J. Scalapino, J. Appl. Phys. 81 (4), pp 2002-2009) (1997). In contrast,<br>
nonlinearity in the surface resistance, R5 of the thin film would be reflected in an increase<br>
in the insertion loss of the filter. This type of nonlinearity is not generally a limiting factor<br>
in the application of superconducting thin films to RF and microwave filters.<br>
We have utilized three IMD tests to assess the applicability of our HTS thin film materials<br>
for applications in RF/microwave filters.<br>
1.	In-band Test. Two-tone input signals are applied near the center of the AMPS B<br>
Passband (835 MHz to 849 MHz). The input frequencies are at/; = 841.985<br>
MHz and , f2 = 842.015 MHz at power levels of -20 dBm each. The<br>
intermodulation spurious product is measured at 842.045 MHz. The<br>
intermodulation spurious product power at this frequency measured at the<br>
output of the filter must be 
2.	Near-Band Test. Equal amplitude input signals are applied at 851 MHz and 853<br>
MHz, and the intermodulation spurious product power level is measured at 849<br>
MHz. The specification is the minimum power level of input tones that produce<br>
intermodulation spurious products in the AMPS B Passband with power levels<br>
of -130 dBm at the output. This input power level must be &gt; -28 dBm.<br>
3.	Out-of-Band Test. Equal amplitude input signals are applied at 869.25 MHz and<br>
894 MHz, and the intermodulation product is measured at 844.5 MHz. The<br>
requirement is the minimum power level of input tones to cause<br>
intermodulation products in the AMPS B System Passband to reach -130 dBm<br>
at the output of the filter. This input test signal power levels must be &gt; -12<br>
dBm.<br>
[0085] We fabricated B-band cellular microwave filters from several (RE)BCO thin<br>
films which were grown by in situ reactive coevaporation onto 2" MgO substrates. Each<br>
double-sided wafer yields two filters, each having a size of 18 mm x 34 mm. The<br>
patterned (RE)BCO structures are quasi-elliptic 10-pole filters with 3 pairs of transmission<br>
zeros on either side of the frequency passband. Fig. 22 shows the typical response of such<br>
a filter. The positions of the frequencies for the two-tone IMD tests are shown,<br>
[0086] Fig. 23 shows the IMD values measured at 79.5 K as a function of Ba/Dy ratio<br>
for several 10-pole B-band filters patterned from optimized Dy-BCO films. Note that all<br>
NB1:672122.1<br><br>
WO 2006/071899	PCT/US2005/047147<br>
23<br>
the filters measured meet the requirements, which are indicated by dotted lines. Figs. 24<br>
and 25 show the 1MD values as a function of the Ba/RE ratio measured at 79.5 K for<br>
several 10-pole B-band filters patterned from optimized Ho-BCO and Er-BCO films. Fig.<br>
26 shows the IMD values measured at 79.5 K for four 10-pole B-band filters patterned<br>
from optimized Nd-BCO films.<br>
Intermodulation distortion in HTS filters arises due to nonlinearity of the microwave<br>
surface reactance, X5, of the thin films. (R. B. Hammond et al, J, Appl. Phys. 84 (10) pp<br>
5662-5667 (1998)). In general, at high microwave current densities in HTS thin films X,<br>
ceases to be constant and independent of current density, and begins to increase with<br>
increasing current density. Commonly there is a maximum current density, JIMD. at which<br>
X5 retains its low current density value, and above which Xs increases. In this paper by<br>
Hammond et al, the relationships between measured parameters and the material<br>
parameter    JIMD    are    described.    This    relationship    can    be    summarized    as<br><br>
the resonant frequency, these two functions depend on the filter function to be realized,<br>
rIMD is a factor which depends only on the geometry of the resonator, and PIN and POUT<br>
are the input and output powers from an intermodulation measurement.<br>
[0087] The out-of-band IMD test requirement corresponds to a minimum JIMD in the<br>
HTS thin film of 1 x 107 A/cm2. The DBCO films surpass the specification by 14 dB,<br>
which here corresponds to a factor of 5. Thus, the DBCO films have a JIMD of 5 x 107<br>
A/cm2. For filter applications JIMD in HTS thin films must be &gt; 1 x 107 A/cm2, more<br>
preferably &gt; 2 x 107 A/cm2, and most preferably &gt; 3 x 107 A/cm2.<br>
Methods of Manufacture<br>
[0088] We have grown our (RE)BCO thin films using an in situ reactive coevaporation<br>
(RCE) deposition technique which has been successfully used to manufacture large-area<br>
YBCO HTS thin films. This is a fabrication technique that readily lends itself to high<br>
volume film production and manufacturability. The yield of high-performance microwave<br>
filters made from films grown by RCE is typically &gt;90%. A key component of this growth<br>
method is the use of a radiative heater that internally maintains an oxygen partial pressure<br>
that is greater than ~10 mTorr. The heater also incorporates a window that allows<br>
NBU672122.1<br><br>
WO 2006/071899		PCT/US2005/047147<br>
24<br>
exposure of the rotating substrates to high vacuum, where evaporation and deposition of<br>
the source materials occurs. Our substrates are typically MgO single crystals up to 2" in<br>
diameter that are rotated continuously between the window and the oxidation pocket at<br>
300 rpm. The chamber ambient pressure away from the pocket is ~10-5 Torr. This<br>
configuration provides sufficient oxygen pressure for stability of the high-Tc phase while<br>
the metallic evaporation sources are simultaneously free from oxidation, and the<br>
evaporated species are free from scattering. The rare earth elements Er, Ho, and Dy are<br>
evaporated from electron beam sources, Nd and Cu are evaporated from either electron<br>
beam sources or resistive sources, and Ba is evaporated from a thermal furnace or a<br>
resistive source. The typical deposition rate is ~2.5 A/sec. The deposition temperature for<br>
the films discussed here is 760 to 790 °C, and the film thickness is about 700 nm. The<br>
films were deposited directly onto MgO substrates, with the exception of Nd-BCO, which<br>
presently requires a thin buffer layer in order to achieve the best results.<br>
[0089] Unlike yttrium, which melts readily, some rare earth elements such as Er, Ho,<br>
and Dy sublime during e-beam evaporation, thereby making compositional control more<br>
challenging. We routinely use quartz crystal monitors (QCM) as our primary rate<br>
controllers. However, the subliming materials arc never molten at our evaporation rates;<br>
rather, the electron beam digs a hole in the metallic source material so that the plume<br>
shape changes significantly during the course of the deposition run. Therefore, the QCMs<br>
are not able to correctly monitor the changing amount of RE vapor flux. To alleviate this<br>
difficulty we have employed hollow-cathode-lamp (HCL) atomic absorption (AA)<br>
evaporation flux sensors to monitor and control these subliming materials. Since the AA<br>
light beam passes through the entire plume of evaporated species, this technique can more<br>
accurately monitor the amount of evaporated flux.<br>
[0090]	The oxygen pocket pressure and deposition rate used to achieve optimal<br>
results are similar for the (RE)BCO films that we have studied. We have found that the<br>
best substrate temperatures for Er, Ho, Dy, and Nd are 780, 790, 790, and 780 °C,<br>
respectively. These temperatures are significantly higher than the temperature of 760 °C<br>
we use to achieve optimal RF properties for YBCO. The use of different growth<br>
conditions for the (RE)BCO materials compared to YBCO is mandatory in order to<br>
achieve the very best RF properties. For example, higher growth temperatures for the<br>
(RE)BCO materials as compared to YBCO are generally required in order to insure the<br>
absence of deleterious misaligned grains. The composition must also be optimized for this<br>

purpose, as we have discussed. In general, many aspects of film growth affect the defect<br>
structure in (RE)BCO thin films, and thus RF properties, including a) growth temperature,<br>
b) growth rate, c) oxygen pressure, and d) stoichiometry. Specific choices for (a), (b), and<br>
(c) may yield different optimized properties and different optimized compositions.<br>
[0091] Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of<br>
illustration and example for purposes of clarity and understanding, it may be readily<br>
apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of this invention that<br>
certain changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit<br>
or scope of the appended claims.<br>
