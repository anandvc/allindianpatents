IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS, IMAGE FORMING METHOD, AND IMAGE<br>
FORMING PROGRAM PRODUCT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to image<br>
forming apparatuses, image forming methods, and image<br>
forming program products employing plural recording<br>
heads, and in particular, to an image forming apparatus,<br>
an image forming method, and an image forming program<br>
product for correcting an inconsecutive portion in an<br>
image formed by plural recording heads.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
(Description of terminology)<br>
First, terminology used in the present<br>
invention is described.<br><recording head><br>
A recording head records an image onto a<br>
recording body with a recording beam. For example, when<br>
the energy source is light, a laser beam irradiated from<br>
a laser light source is focused on the recording body<br>
with a lens. An image is formed by turning the laser<br>
beam on/off, forming portions on the recording body that<br><br>
react to light and portions that do not receive light.<br>
An example of a recording head is shown in<br>
FIG. 1. The recording head shown in FIG. 1 includes a<br>
semiconductor laser LD 1, an aspherical lens 2, a<br>
diaphragm 3, and an adhesive 4.<br><recording beam><br>
The recording head shown in FIG. 1 uses a<br>
laser beam as a recording beam. Generally, a recording<br>
beam records an image by transferring light, heat,<br>
impacts of a substance, or a substance itself such as<br>
ink, to a recording body.<br><recording body><br>
A recording body reacts to energy from the<br>
recording head, and indicates different physical<br>
features at portions where energy is irradiated and<br>
portions where energy is not irradiated, thereby<br>
recording an image. For example, an image is recorded<br>
by chemical reaction, changes in phases, or changes in<br>
shape. Specifically, a recording body that uses light<br>
energy is made of a photosensitive material for reacting<br>
to light energy, a heat-sensitive material for reacting<br>
to heat of a laser beam, or reaction material that burns<br>
due to heat of a laser beam.<br>
Original image data&gt;<br>
Original image data represent an image to be<br><br>
formed by an image forming apparatus. For example, an<br>
image may be expressed by a page description language<br>
that specifies figures with characters formed by<br>
parameters of equations for dots and surfaces and<br>
parameters specifying character string codes and font<br>
types. Other examples are bitmap data of an arbitrary<br>
resolution or data of a page description language<br>
including bitmap data.<br><rasterization><br>
Rasterization means converting original image<br>
data to a set of dots (set of bits) that an image<br>
forming apparatus can record on a recording body. As a<br>
result of the conversion, 1 bit of rasterized data is<br>
recorded on the recording body as 1 dot. To output<br>
halftones, grayscales are converted to halftone dots,<br>
corresponding to a predetermined number of dots per unit<br>
area.<br><positional displacement information><br>
As shown in FIG. 2, when recording positions<br>
of recording heads are at ideal positions, recording<br>
regions of each of the recording heads on a recording<br>
body are arranged continuously with adjacent regions.<br>
However, in reality, due to manufacturing variations,<br>
the recording positions of the recording heads are<br>
arranged inconsecutively on the recording body, as<br><br>
indicated by solid lines shown in FIG. 3. Thus, an<br>
amount of positional displacement (x, y) between an<br>
ideal recording region and an actual recording region is<br>
obtained, as shown in FIG. 4. In this example, the<br>
ideal recording region is rectangular; a positional<br>
displacement amount can be a distance that vertex<br>
coordinates have moved. In this example, positional<br>
displacements from ideal vertex positions are obtained.<br>
However, in effect, as long as adjacent recording<br>
regions are arranged continuously and are not displaced<br>
from each other, the recorded image appears fine.<br>
Accordingly, the positional displacement amount can be a<br>
relative distance between pixels of adjacent recording<br>
regions, which pixels are ideally adjacent to each other.<br>
Regardless of how the displacement amount is expressed,<br>
positional displacement information represents an<br>
inconsecutive region, i.e., a gap appearing at a<br>
boundary between adjacent regions corresponding to<br>
adjacent recording heads in a recorded image.<br>
The positional displacement information<br>
varies between different image forming apparatuses.<br>
Accordingly, a reference image (marker) is plotted on<br>
the recording body, and positional displacement<br>
information is obtained based on the plotted reference<br>
image.<br><br>
In FIG. 5, marks of an original (M1, M2) are<br>
recorded on a recording body. Each mark is recorded in<br>
one of the recording regions of two recording heads.<br>
The marks recorded by the two recording heads are<br>
compared with original marks (marks on the original), so<br>
as to detect a positional displacement therebetween.<br>
In FIG. 5, the positional displacement is<br>
detected from a positional relationship vO between marks<br>
on the original and a positional relationship v1 between<br>
marks recorded on the recording body. Thus, a relative<br>
positional displacement between the two recording heads<br>
can be detected.<br><scanning information><br>
Scanning information corresponds to data<br>
expressing a position at which image data are to be<br>
recorded when forming an image. When there are N<br>
scanning lines, scanning positions from the left are<br>
expressed as L[l], L [2] • •'L[N] . Normally, position<br>
information is expressed as 1, 2, 3...N for L[l], L[2]...<br>
L[N] .<br>
In order to increase scanning density, three<br>
scanning lines evenly spaced apart can be added in<br>
between scanning line L[l] and scanning line L[2], for<br>
example. When the added scanning lines are included,<br>
the positional information for L[l], L[2] , L[3]"'- is 1,<br><br>
1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 3...N.<br>
The scanning information also includes height<br>
information Lh for determining a position from which<br>
scanning starts (scanning start position), to be<br>
described below.<br><step scanning><br>
As shown in FIG. 6, in a step scanning method,<br>
a movable stage 15 stops while a recording body 11<br>
wrapped around a rotating drum 12 is facing recording<br>
heads 16. The movable stage 15 moves to the next<br>
scanning position when a non-recording portion of the<br>
rotating drum 12 is facing the recording heads 16.<br><spiral scanning><br>
As shown in FIG. 7, in a spiral scanning<br>
method, the movable stage is constantly moving while the<br>
drum is rotating. Normally, the movable stage moves at<br>
a speed such that one main scanning line is scanned<br>
during one rotation of the drum. Accordingly, the<br>
surface of the drum can be scanned in a spiral manner.<br>
(Conventional image forming apparatus)<br>
Next, an example of a conventional image<br>
forming apparatus is described with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
The image forming apparatus employing the<br>
step scanning method shown in FIG. 6 includes the<br>
recording body 11, the drum 12, a drum encoder 14, the<br><br>
movable stage 15 that moves in parallel with the drum 12,<br>
the recording heads 16 provided on the movable stage 15,<br>
and a rotational axle 17. Recording beams irradiated<br>
from the recording heads 16 scan the recording body 11<br>
to form an image.<br>
The recording body 11 is a recording material<br>
used for image formation, and is wrapped around the<br>
surface or the underside of the circumference of the<br>
drum 12. The recording body 11 is fixed to the<br>
circumferential surface of the drum 12 with a fixing<br>
mechanism such as a clamping mechanism. The drum 12 is<br>
rotatable around the rotational axle 17, and is rotated<br>
by not shown driving means attached to the rotational<br>
axle 17. In order to accurately control the rotation of<br>
the drum 12, a stepping motor or a servo motor is<br>
employed as the driving means.<br>
The drum encoder 14 is provided on one end of<br>
the drum 12. The drum encoder 14 includes a light<br>
source and a light detecting device that detects light<br>
irradiated from the light source, so as to detect the<br>
rotational position of the rotating drum 12. Further,<br>
the drum encoder 14 can detect the home position of the<br>
drum 12, i.e., the position from which the drum 12<br>
starts rotating.<br>
The movable stage 15 is movable in the axial<br><br>
direction of the drum 12, under control of a ball screw<br>
or a linear motor. A scan trajectory 13 moves in<br>
accordance with the movement of the movable stage 15.<br>
The image forming apparatus shown in FIG. 6<br>
operates as follows.<br>
The drum 12 is rotated by a power source such<br>
as a motor. As described above, the drum encoder 14<br>
detects the rotational position of the drum 12.<br>
Specifically, positions of the recording body 11 and the<br>
recording heads 16 can be obtained from output from the<br>
drum encoder 14. Based on the obtained positions, a<br>
recording timing to perform recording onto the recording<br>
body 11 is determined.<br>
The image forming apparatus detects the home<br>
position of the drum 12 with the drum encoder 14, and<br>
the recording heads 16 start recording an image. With<br>
one rotation of the drum 12, each recording head 16<br>
scans one line. This is referred to as main scanning.<br>
When one main scanning operation on the<br>
recording body 11 is completed, the movable stage 15<br>
moves horizontally to the position of the next main<br>
scanning operation; this is referred to as sub scanning.<br>
Subsequently, main scanning is performed. Recording<br>
beams from the recording heads 16 scan the recording<br>
body 11 by alternately repeating sub scanning and main<br><br>
scanning. When scanning of a predetermined region on<br>
the recording body 11 is completed, the process of<br>
creating an image is completed.<br>
In the above example, sub scanning is<br>
performed every time the drum 12 rotates once, i.e., in<br>
a stepwise manner. Instead of a stepwise manner, it is<br>
also possible to perform sub scanning substantially<br>
continuously, so that the recording body 11 is scanned<br>
in a spiral manner. The image forming apparatus<br>
described with reference to FIG. 7 performs sub scanning<br>
in a spiral manner. In the image forming apparatus<br>
described with reference to FIG. 7, the movable stage<br>
that moves the recording heads is constantly moving at a<br>
speed such that one main scanning line is scanned during<br>
one rotation of the drum.<br>
(Conventional technology)<br>
A technology disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open<br>
Patent Application No. 2001-88346 (Patent Document 1) is<br>
described with reference to FIG. 8. A laser beam L1 and<br>
a laser beam L2 irradiated from adjacent recording heads<br>
continuously record images in recording regions A1 and<br>
A2. In a recording region C12, the number of main<br>
scanning lines recorded by the laser beam L1 is<br>
gradually reduced, while the number of main scanning<br>
lines recorded by the laser beam L2 is gradually<br><br>
increased, so that the boundary between adjacent<br>
recording regions A1, A2 in the image is inconspicuous.<br>
In an invention described in Japanese Laid-<br>
Open Patent Application No. 2002-72494 (Patent Document<br>
2), an image is divided into plural segments to be<br>
recorded by plural laser beams, and the sub scanning<br>
speed is reduced near boundaries of adjacent images so<br>
as to adjust intervals between main scanning lines. The<br>
main scanning lines are divided in the main scanning<br>
direction, and are separated and formed in a sub<br>
scanning direction, so that differences between<br>
inclinations of the main scanning lines are eliminated.<br>
Accordingly, high quality images can be recorded at high<br>
speed.<br>
In an invention described in Japanese Laid-<br>
Open Patent Application No. 2004-147260 (Patent Document<br>
3), when one set of original image data is divided so<br>
that image formation is performed by plural recording<br>
heads, positional displacements of the divided parts can<br>
be corrected by a simple method. Specifically, a single<br>
set of image data can be divided into plural parts based<br>
on image regions corresponding to the recording heads,<br>
so as to create divided image data. According to<br>
positional displacements of the divided images, a new<br>
correction image data area is additionally provided<br><br>
based on the divided image data and detection results of<br>
positional displacement amounts. The divided image data<br>
are arranged in the correction image data area based on<br>
positions obtained from detection results of the<br>
positional displacement amounts. Thus, positional<br>
displacements between divided images are prevented.<br>
In an invention described in Japanese Patent<br>
No. 3604961 (Patent Document 4), a print region on a<br>
recording medium or an intermediate recording medium, in<br>
which image information is actually recorded, is divided<br>
into at least two segments. The segments are superposed<br>
onto each other at boundary parts. A relative<br>
positional difference detecting unit exposes three or<br>
four positional marks onto an exposure area including<br>
the superposed regions, and calculates a positional<br>
displacement amount of the exposure area from a detected<br>
value of a positional displacement amount between the<br>
positional marks. Image information forming units form<br>
image information based on positional displacement<br>
amounts of the exposure area. An image information<br>
correcting unit corrects the image information so as to<br>
match the actual print region.<br>

Application No. 2002-72494<br>
Patent Document 3: Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>
Application No. 2004-147260<br>
Patent Document 4: Japanese Patent No.<br>
3604961<br>
In the invention described in Japanese Laid-<br>
Open Patent Application No. 2001-88346, in a recording<br>
region where images recorded by adjacent recording beams<br>
are superposed, the number of main scanning lines<br>
recorded by one laser beam is gradually reduced, while<br>
the number of main scanning lines recorded by another<br>
laser beam is gradually increased, so that the boundary<br>
between adjacent images is inconspicuous. However, in<br>
this method, intervals between scanning lines from the<br>
two laser beams are not adjusted at all. Therefore, if<br>
a positional displacement between the two laser beams is<br>
half of the scanning intervals, stripes may appear at<br>
boundaries between scanning lines from different laser<br>
beams. In such a case, as there are boundaries<br>
throughout the entire superposed region, the number of<br>
stripes is increased, and image quality is degraded.<br>
In the invention described in Japanese Laid-<br>
Open Patent Application No. 2002-72494, the sub scanning<br>
speed is reduced near boundaries of adjacent images to<br>
adjust intervals between main scanning lines, so that<br><br>
inconsecutive portions at boundaries are inconspicuous.<br>
However, in order to reduce the sub scanning speed in<br>
spiral scanning, extra processes are necessary to<br>
eliminate differences between inclinations of the main<br>
scanning lines. Specifically, the processes include<br>
dividing the main scanning lines in a main scanning<br>
direction so as to be separated and formed in a sub<br>
scanning direction. Further, when performing processes<br>
to correct inclinations of plural main scanning lines,<br>
interference may occur between the number of main<br>
scanning lines subject to inclination correction and<br>
periods of area modulation patterns used for expressing<br>
image density. Accordingly, stripes may be visible at<br>
boundaries of images. Further, by reducing the sub<br>
scanning speed, the friction resistance of stage machine<br>
parts for sub scanning, e.g., a guide rail, deviates<br>
from normal values. Accordingly, the driving torque of<br>
the driving source deviates from normal values. Thus,<br>
precision of scanning positions varies between segments<br>
scanned at normal speed and segments scanned at reduced<br>
speed; therefore, fine stripes may be visible in the<br>
resultant image.<br>
In the invention described in Japanese Laid-<br>
Open Patent Application No. 2004-147260, embedded images<br>
are provided for each recording head to measure<br><br>
positional displacements, which makes the structure<br>
complex. Further, fractional parts of positional<br>
displacements are not taken into account; therefore, the<br>
positional displacements are not thoroughly corrected.<br>
The invention described in Japanese Patent No,<br>
3604961 involves exposing three or four positional marks<br>
onto the exposure area, which makes the structure<br>
complex.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for an image<br>
forming apparatus, an image forming method, and an image<br>
forming program product in which positional<br>
displacements of images recorded by adjacent recording<br>
heads can be corrected in main scanning and sub scanning<br>
directions without changing the sub scanning speed, and<br>
differences in recording densities between recording<br>
heads are not visible in recorded images.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A description is given, with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, of an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[First Embodiment]<br>
The basic principle of a first embodiment<br>
according to the present invention is described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 9A, 9B, 9C.<br>
FIG. 9A shows ideal recording regions of<br>
three recording heads (first recording head, second<br>
recording head, third recording head).<br>
P1 is the recording region of the first<br><br>
recording head, P2 is the recording region of the second<br>
recording head, and P3 is the recording region of the<br>
third recording head. In FIGS. 9A, 9B, 9C, a vertical<br>
direction (Y direction) is referred to as a main<br>
scanning direction, and a horizontal direction (X<br>
direction) is referred to as a sub scanning direction.<br>
In FIG. 9A, rasterized original image data<br>
are correctly reproduced. However, in reality, image<br>
data are recorded by the recording heads as indicated by<br>
solid lines shown in FIG. 9B. H1 denotes the actual<br>
recording region of the first recording head, H2 denotes<br>
the actual recording region of the second recording head,<br>
and H3 denotes the actual recording region of the third<br>
recording head. Accordingly, the first recording head<br>
irradiates a recording beam before the ideal position by<br>
a distance X1, and the second recording head irradiates<br>
a recording beam behind the ideal position by a distance<br>
X2 and at a position displaced in the sub scanning<br>
direction by a distance Y1. The third recording head<br>
irradiates a recording beam in an ideal recording region.<br>
In the status shown in FIG. 9B, there is a<br>
blank area (Y1) and a superposed area (Y2), and the top<br>
parts of the recording regions are not aligned.<br>
In order to change the status shown in FIG.<br>
9B to a status shown in FIG. 9C, the blank area (Y1) is<br><br>
included in the recording region of the first recording<br>
head, the first recording head is made to irradiate a<br>
recording beam behind the ideal position by the distance<br>
X1, and the second recording head is made to irradiate a<br>
recording beam before the ideal position by the distance<br>
X2.<br>
By recording the image data shown in FIG. 9C<br>
with the recording heads having properties as shown in<br>
FIG. 9B (in addition, the recording region of the first<br>
recording head is widened by the distance Y1), the<br>
original image data can be correctly reproduced.<br>
A detailed description of the first<br>
embodiment is given below.<br>
(Block diagram of image forming apparatus)<br>
An image forming apparatus according to the<br>
first embodiment is assumed to have a structure similar<br>
to that described with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 10 is a block diagram of the image<br>
forming apparatus according to the first embodiment.<br>
The image forming apparatus shown in FIG. 10 includes an<br>
original image data receiving unit 21, a rasterized<br>
original image data (P) storing unit 22, a positional<br>
displacement information storing unit 23, an image data<br>
(Q) generating unit 24, an image data (Q) storing unit<br>
25, a scanning information generating unit 26, a reading<br><br>
control unit 27, buffers 281 through 28N, a drum driving<br>
control unit 29, a stage control unit 30, driving<br>
control units 311 through 31N, and recording heads 321<br>
through 32N.<br>
The original image data receiving unit 21<br>
receives original image data of images to be formed by<br>
the image forming apparatus. The received data, i.e.,<br>
rasterized original image data (P), are loaded in the<br>
rasterized original image data (P) storing unit 22.<br>
The positional displacement information<br>
storing unit 23 holds positional displacement<br>
information. In the first embodiment, a reference image<br>
(marker) is actually plotted on a recording body<br>
beforehand, and the plotted image (marker) is used for<br>
measuring positional displacement of a recording beam<br>
from the recording head 32. The positional displacement<br>
information is obtained based on the measured positional<br>
displacement, and is loaded in the positional<br>
displacement information storing unit 23.<br>
The rasterized original image data (P) loaded<br>
in the rasterized original image data (P) storing unit<br>
22 are recorded by the recording heads 32, based on<br>
positional displacement information loaded in the<br>
positional displacement information storing unit 23.<br>
Before the data are actually recorded, the image data<br><br>
(Q) generating unit 24 can change the rasterized<br>
original image data (P) into the image data (Q), in<br>
order to correct positional displacements in the main<br>
scanning direction and/or the sub scanning direction.<br>
The image data (Q) obtained by changing the rasterized<br>
original image data (P) are loaded in the image data (Q)<br>
storing unit 25.<br>
The reading control unit 27 reads pixels of<br>
the image data (Q) loaded in the image data (Q) storing<br>
unit 25, and sequentially transfers the pixels to the<br>
buffers 281 through 28N. Upon sequentially receiving the<br>
image data (Q), the buffers 281 through 28N temporarily<br>
store a predetermined number of lines (at least one<br>
line) in association with the recording heads 321<br>
through 32N.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11, the image data (Q)<br>
storing unit 25 includes a recording image storing<br>
region Q, which is a region for storing an image to be<br>
recorded. The recording image storing region Q holds<br>
image data (Q), which are divided into N parts, in<br>
association with the N recording heads.<br>
A storing region Q1 is associated with the<br>
first recording head 321, a storing region Q2 is<br>
associated with the second recording head 322, and a<br>
storing region QN is associated with the Nth recording<br><br>
head 32N-<br>
Each of the storing regions Q1 through QN has<br>
z bits in the main scanning direction and Zw bits in the<br>
sub scanning direction (a total of z bits x zw bits).<br>
The reading control unit 27 reads pixels in<br>
each of the storing regions Ql through QN in the order<br>
of 1, 2, 3...z, z + 1, z+2, z + 3...2z,....zXNw, and<br>
transfers the pixels to the corresponding buffers 281<br>
through 28N.<br>
The bits "1, 2, —z" in the storing region Ql<br>
are written onto a recording body by a first scan<br>
(hereinafter, "L[1]"), and the bits "z+1, z+2, •••z+z"<br>
are written onto a recording body by a second scan<br>
(hereinafter, "L[2]"), and so forth.<br>
The scanning information generating unit 26<br>
generates scanning information corresponding to the<br>
image data (Q) loaded in the image data (Q) storing unit<br>
25. Based on the scanning information, the drum driving<br>
control unit 29 and the stage control unit 30 perform<br>
main scanning and sub scanning.<br>
The scanning information generated by the<br>
scanning information generating unit 26 is transferred<br>
to the stage control unit 30 and the driving control<br>
units 31. The stage control unit 30 causes the movable<br>
stage to move according to the order of the scanning<br><br>
information. Specifically, the stage control unit 30<br>
receives the scanning information, and determines the<br>
position of the movable stage. First, the stage control<br>
unit 30 moves the movable stage to the position of the<br>
first scan L[1], and every time the drum rotates once,<br>
the movable stage is moved to a position corresponding<br>
to the next scanning information, such as the position<br>
of the second scan L[2], the position of the third scan<br>
L[3], and so forth. The movable stage is moved when<br>
facing regions of the drum where images are not recorded<br>
and recording beams are not irradiated. For example,<br>
the movable stage is moved in synchronization with a<br>
home position signal of the drum. When the movable<br>
stage moves to a scanning position, image data<br>
associated with the scanning information corresponding<br>
to the scanning position are recorded onto the drum.<br>
The driving control unit 31 drives the recording head 32,<br>
and turns on/off a recording beam in accordance with<br>
image data. Main scanning is performed by the rotation<br>
of the drum, and sub scanning is performed by the<br>
movement of the movable stage.<br>
The stage control unit 30 controls the<br>
movable stage on which the recording heads 32 are<br>
mounted, and has functions of synchronizing with the<br>
drum driving control unit 29 in accordance with scanning<br><br>
information, and receiving scanning information.<br>
The configuration shown in FIG. 10 is also<br>
applicable to other embodiments.<br>
Next, a description is given of a process<br>
performed by the image data (Q) generating unit 24<br>
according to the first embodiment. Specifically, the<br>
image data (Q) generating unit 24 changes rasterized<br>
original image data (P) loaded in the rasterized<br>
original image data (P) storing unit 22 into image data<br>
(Q) loaded in the image data (Q) storing unit 25.<br>
(Rasterized original image data (P) and Image<br>
data (Q))<br>
An original raster image storing region P of<br>
the rasterized original image data (P) storing unit 22<br>
holds rasterized original image data (P). The image<br>
data (Q) generating unit 24 changes the rasterized<br>
original image data (P) into the image data (Q), and<br>
loads the image data (Q) into the recording image<br>
storing region Q of the image data (Q) storing unit 25.<br>
As a matter of simplification, it is assumed<br>
that the number "N" of the recording heads 32 is four.<br>
The recording heads 32 are mounted onto the movable<br>
stage movable in an axial direction of the drum. The<br>
recording heads 32 are referred to as R[1], R[2], R[3],<br>
R[4], from the left of the axial direction of the drum.<br><br>
Recording beams irradiated from the recording heads 32<br>
are referred to as Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rb4, from the left of<br>
the axial direction of the drum. The recording beams<br>
irradiated from the plural recording heads 32 are<br>
arranged so as to irradiate the recording body 11 in a<br>
linear manner along the axial direction of the drum,<br>
with substantially equal intervals therebetween. If sub<br>
scanning is recorded in a direction from left to right,<br>
Rbl is positioned on the left side outside a left edge<br>
of a recording body recording region, before image<br>
recording starts. Accordingly, the entire recording<br>
region of the recording body 11 can be scanned.<br>
In the first embodiment, the recording heads<br>
32 are spaced apart by intervals of 100 mm. A<br>
prescribed image recording density p is 1 line/mm.<br>
Therefore, a prescribed recording width w allocated to<br>
each recording head is 100 mm, such that 100 lines are<br>
scanned. With four recording heads, an image with a<br>
width of 400 mm is recorded. The drum diameter is 200<br>
mm. The drum circumference is approximately 628 mm.<br>
The recording circumference on the recording body 11 is<br>
500 mm.<br>
Thus, the size of an image to be recorded<br>
(hereinafter, "recording image size") is 400 mm in width<br>
and 500 mm in height. Hereinafter, the axial direction<br><br>
of the drum is referred to as a horizontal (X) direction<br>
(sub scanning direction), and the circumferential<br>
direction of the drum is referred to as a height (Y)<br>
direction (main scanning direction). In terms of pixels,<br>
this recording image size corresponds to 400 dots in the<br>
horizontal direction and 500 dots in the height<br>
direction.<br>
The size of the original raster image storing<br>
region P is at least as large as the recording image<br>
size (i.e., not the size of the image after being<br>
recorded, but the size of image information to be<br>
recorded), so as to accommodate image information of 400<br>
dots in the horizontal direction and 500 dots in the<br>
height direction. The actual image size is the size of<br>
the received rasterized original image data (P). The<br>
image size of the rasterized original image data (P) is<br>
assumed to have a width of Pw and a height of Ph.<br>
The movable stage 15 is capable of moving a<br>
distance longer than the prescribed recording width w.<br>
The movable stage 15 is positioned on the left in the<br>
axial direction of the drum when recording starts, and<br>
moves toward the right as an image is being recorded.<br>
In the first embodiment, it is assumed that the image<br>
forming apparatus performs step scanning.<br>
(Positional displacement information)<br><br>
Next, positional displacement information<br>
that is previously loaded in the positional displacement<br>
information storing unit 23 is described. In the first<br>
embodiment, the positional displacement information<br>
represents relative distances between two recording<br>
heads, as described with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
For adjacent recording beams such as Rb1 and<br>
Rb2, Rb2 and Rb3, Rb3 and Rb4, and so forth, positional<br>
displacement information in the X direction is expressed<br>
as Ax[1], ∆x[2], ∆x[3], and positional displacement<br>
information in the Y direction is expressed as ∆y[1],<br>
∆y[2], ∆y[3]. If ∆x [m] (m=1, 2, 3,..., N-1) is positive,<br>
gaps are formed between specified recording images of<br>
Rb[m] and Rb[m+1], If ∆x[m] (m=l, 2,3, ...,N-1) is negative,<br>
there is a superposed region between the specified<br>
recording images of Rb [in] and Rb[m+1]. If ∆y [m] is<br>
positive, among of the specified recording images of<br>
Rb[m] and Rb[m+1], the image of Rb[m+1] is displaced<br>
downward.<br>
For Ax[m] (m=l,2, 3,...,N-l) , ∆y [m] (m=l, 2 , 3,..., N-<br>
1), maximum permissible values ∆xl, ∆yl are specified.<br>
Accordingly, -∆xl≤∆x [m] ≤ ∆xl (m=l, 2 , 3,..., N-l) , -∆yl≤∆y[m]<br>
≤∆yl (m=l, 2, 3,..., N-l) are satisfied. The maximum<br>
permissible values are previously determined in<br>
consideration of assembly precision of the machine and<br><br>
distribution of assembly positions. In the first<br>
embodiment, the following positional displacement<br>
information is assumed.<br>
∆x[1]=2.3 mm, ∆x[2]=-1.0 mm, ∆x[3]=0.5 mm<br>
∆y[1]=1.1 mm, ∆y[2]=-3.2 mm, ∆y[3]=0.0 mm<br>
The value of ∆xmax, which is the maximum ∆x,<br>
is extracted. In the first embodiment, ∆xmax=∆x[1]=2.3<br>
mm.<br>
Further, ∆y is a relative value with the<br>
adjacent region, so that addition is sequentially<br>
performed from ∆y[1], to be converted into a height yn<br>
with Rb1 as the reference. This is obtained as yn[l]=0,<br>
yn[2]=∆y[l], yn[3]=∆y[1]+∆y[2], yn [4]=∆y[1]+∆y[2]+∆y[3] .<br>
In the first embodiment, yn[l]=0 mm,<br>
yn[2]=l.l mm, yn[3]=-2.1 mm, yn[4]=-2.1 mm.<br>
Next, ∆ynmax, which is the maximum value of<br>
∆yn, and ∆ynmin, which is the minimum value of ∆yn, are<br>
extracted. Accordingly, ∆ynmax=∆yn[2]=1.1 mm,<br>
∆ynmin=∆yn[3]=-2.1 mm.<br>
A permissible range is specified also for yn,<br>
as -ynl ≤ yn ≤ +ynl.<br>
(Generation of width Qw of image data (Q))<br>
Image data (Q) are stored in the recording<br>
image storing region Q, based on positional displacement<br>
information and rasterized original image data (P). The<br><br>
image size of the image data (Q) has a width Qw and a<br>
height Qh.<br>
A description is given on how the width Qw<br>
and the height Qh of the image data (Q) are determined<br>
based on positional displacement information and<br>
rasterized original image data (P).<br>
The prescribed recording width w and ∆xmax<br>
are added together to obtain w+∆xmax=102.3 mm. This<br>
expresses a distance between beams where adjacent<br>
recording beams are furthest apart. This result is<br>
multiplied by the prescribed image recording density p<br>
to obtain the number of scanning lines, as (w+∆ymax)x p=<br>
102.3 lines. In this case, ∆ymax is a positional<br>
displacement between Rb1 and Rb2, which means that there<br>
is a gap of 2.3 dots between the recording images of Rb1<br>
and Rb2. The prescribed recording width w is 100 lines;<br>
therefore, a gap of 2.3 dots is formed as shown in FIG.<br>
12. This gap can be filled or reduced by increasing the<br>
prescribed recording width w. By increasing the<br>
prescribed recording width w to 102 dots, the gap<br>
becomes 0.3 dots.<br>
In the first embodiment, in order to prevent<br>
any gaps, a fractional dot is rounded up to an integral<br>
dot.<br>
Thus, when the gap is 2.3 dots, Rb1 and Rb2<br><br>
are made to superpose each other by 0.7 dots, as shown<br>
in FIG. 13.<br>
The prescribed recording width w is obtained<br>
from the maximum positional displacement ∆ymax.<br>
Therefore, by specifying the prescribed recording width<br>
w to be 103 dots for all recording heads, gaps can be<br>
prevented from appearing between recording images of<br>
recording beams.<br>
If ∆ymax is negative, e.g., -2.7 mm, the same<br>
process is performed. A negative ∆ymax indicates that<br>
there is a superposed part between the recording images.<br>
In this example, w+∆ymax=97.3 mm. The prescribed<br>
recording width w becomes 98 dots, so that the<br>
superposed part is 0.7 dots.<br>
(Specification of fine control area QF)<br>
Next, superposed parts corresponding to<br>
fractional dots are taken into consideration. When the<br>
recording image Rb1 and the recording image Rb2<br>
superpose each other by a fractional dot smaller than an<br>
integral dot, it is necessary to move the image<br>
recording position of Rb2. However, all of the<br>
recording heads simultaneously move on a single movable<br>
stage; therefore, in order to only move Rb2, another<br>
moving means would be required. Accordingly, a fine<br>
control area QF is formed, in which the image recording<br><br>
density is increased. For example, as shown in FIG. 14,<br>
in a recording region of a recording beam, the image<br>
recording density is quadrupled in the X direction for<br>
the first four lines. A recording density multiplying<br>
factor used for increasing the image recording density<br>
is expressed as u(u≥1). Accordingly, it is possible to<br>
create image data in units of 1/u dots. When the<br>
density is quadrupled, three scanning lines (e.g., L2,<br>
L3, L4: dots indicated by circles of thin lines are<br>
scanned from the top circle to the bottom circle) are<br>
added in between the prescribed scanning lines (e.g., L1,<br>
L5: dots indicated by circles of thick lines are scanned<br>
from the top circle to the bottom circle). The added<br>
scans 3x3 are referred to as "additional scanning".<br>
Accordingly, in the fine control area QF, nine scanning<br>
lines are added, as obtained from (u-1)x(u-1)=3<br>
lines x 3=9 lines.<br>
The horizontal width of an image size<br>
allocated to each recording head is obtained by adding<br>
the prescribed recording width w with the fine control<br>
area QF, as 103+9=112 dots, which is hereinafter<br>
referred to as base width Nw.<br>
Nw=w+D{∆ymax}+(u-1)x(u-1)<br>
The operation of rounding up a value "a" to<br>
an integer is expressed as D{a}.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 11, the entire width Qw of<br>
the recording image storing region Q corresponds to N<br>
recording heads arranged horizontally, where each<br>
recording head has a base width Nw. Thus, the entire<br>
width Qw of the recording image storing region Q is<br>
expressed by the following equation:<br>
Qw=NwxN<br>
(Generating height Qh of image data (Q))<br>
Next, the height Qh of the image of the<br>
recording image storing region Q is expressed by the<br>
following equation:<br>
Qh=Ph+D{∆ynmax-∆ynmin}<br>
In this example, when Ph is 500 dots, the<br>
height of the image is 504 dots. The height can<br>
constantly be a maximum height, as expressed by<br>
Qh=Ph+D{2x∆ynl}.<br>
The above describes one example of a method<br>
for determining the width Qw and the height Qh of the<br>
recording image storing region Q. The width Qw and the<br>
height Qh correspond to the image data size, and not the<br>
actual width and height of the image recorded on the<br>
recording body. If image data are recorded by scanning<br>
at high density, the recorded image becomes compressed.<br>
(Scanning information)<br>
Scanning information is created in<br><br>
association with row data in the height direction of the<br>
image data (Q).<br>
Scanning information includes the order in<br>
which rows in the height direction of an image are<br>
scanned and the scanning positions thereof.<br>
The scanning information is obtained by<br>
L[k]=1/u x (k-l)+l (k=l,2,...,ux (a-1) )<br>
L[k]=k-u x (a-l)+a-l (k=ux (a-l)+l,u x (a-1)+2, ...,Nw)<br>
based on the recording density multiplying<br>
factor u, the prescribed image recording density p, the<br>
positional displacement information, the prescribed<br>
recording width w, and the base width Nw. Scanning for<br>
the fine control area QF is performed for a length of<br>
"a" scans in the prescribed image recording density p.<br>
In the first embodiment, it is assumed as<br>
a=u=4. As shown in FIG. 15, the scanning position of<br>
the far left row is L[l]=l, the second row is L[2]=1.25,<br>
the third row is L[3]=1.5, and so forth. The scanning<br>
positions are in units of one scan in the prescribed<br>
image recording density p, and scanning positions •<br>
increased in the fine control area QF are in fractional<br>
numbers.<br>
For rasterized original image data (P) of<br>
400 x 500 dots, a recording image region having a width of<br>
448 dots and a height of 504 dots is provided as an<br><br>
image data (Q). These image data are loaded in the<br>
recording image storing region Q of the image data (Q)<br>
storing unit 25. The scanning information includes the<br>
order of scanning, and therefore, the scanning<br>
information is the same for all four recording heads.<br>
The same scanning information is repeatedly associated<br>
with the arranged image data. Accordingly, the scanning<br>
information indicates positions of scanning operations<br>
for the rows in the height direction of the image data<br>
(Q) <br>
In the case of step scanning, the scanning<br>
information includes scanning positions and the scanning<br>
order for data in the main scanning direction of the<br>
image data (Q) to be recorded. In the image data (Q),<br>
the first recording in the main scanning direction is<br>
performed at a scanning position L[l]. When the first<br>
main scanning data set of the image data (Q) is loaded<br>
in the buffer, the stage control unit 30 reads the<br>
scanning information L[l], and moves the movable stage<br>
to the position indicated by L[l]. When the stage<br>
control unit 30 finishes moving the movable stage to the<br>
position indicated by L[l], the driving control units 31<br>
receive the rotational position of the drum from the<br>
drum driving control unit 29, and turn on/off the<br>
recording heads based on buffer data at predetermined<br><br>
drum positions in synchronization with the drum rotation.<br>
When scanning is completed for one main scanning line,<br>
the second main scanning data set of the image data (Q)<br>
is loaded in the buffer, and the same process is<br>
performed based on scanning information L[2]. The same<br>
process is repeated for subsequent sets of scanning<br>
information, until scanning is completed for the<br>
scanning information of the last position. This is an<br>
example of step scanning.<br>
In the case of spiral scanning, the stage<br>
control unit 30 reads scanning information L[l]. When<br>
the present scanning position has not reached the<br>
position of L[l], the stage control unit 30 continues to<br>
move the moving stage. When the present scanning<br>
position has passed the position of L[l], the stage<br>
control unit 30 moves the moving stage backward (return<br>
from overwriting). Under normal circumstances, the<br>
stage control unit 30 continues to move the moving stage<br>
forward. The stage control unit 30 sequentially<br>
transfers the present stage position to the driving<br>
control units 31. The drum driving control unit 29<br>
sequentially transfers the drum rotational position to<br>
the driving control units 31. When the driving control<br>
units 31 detect that the stage position has reached the<br>
position of L[l], the driving control units 31 turn<br><br>
on/off the recording heads based on buffer data in<br>
synchronization with the drum rotation. When buffer<br>
data for one main scanning operation are recorded, the<br>
same process is performed based on the next scanning<br>
information L[2]. The same process is repeated until<br>
scanning is completed for the scanning information of<br>
the last position.<br>
When the present scanning position has passed<br>
the position of the scanning information, the stage<br>
control unit 30 moves the movable stage backward to a<br>
reference position, such as the home position. In order<br>
to perform scanning at the position specified by the<br>
scanning information, the stage control unit 30 controls<br>
the speed of the movable stage in synchronization with<br>
the drum rotational position received from the drum<br>
driving control unit 29, and moves the movable stage at<br>
a predetermined constant speed.<br>
(Generation of image data (Q))<br>
Image data are changed and transferred from<br>
the original raster image storing region P of the<br>
rasterized original image data (P) storing unit 22 to<br>
the recording image storing region Q of the image data<br>
(Q) storing unit 25.<br>
This operation is described next.<br>
A data value for not performing image<br><br>
recording is initially specified for the image in the<br>
recording image storing region Q. An image width Rpw<br>
allocated to each recording head is determined based on<br>
the prescribed recording width w and ∆y (m=l, 2, 3,..., N-l) ,<br>
by<br>
Rpw[m]=D{w+∆y[m] } (m=l, 2, ...,N-1) .<br>
In the first embodiment, as described above,<br>
it is assumed as follows:<br>
∆y[1]=2.3 mm, ∆y[2]=-1.0 mm, ∆y[3]=0.5 mm<br>
Therefore, in the case of the recording head<br>
R[1], there are Rpw[1]=103 dots. Similarly, for the<br>
recording heads R[2] and R[3], there are Rpw[2]=99 dots<br>
and Rpw[3]=101 dots. For the last, fourth recording<br>
head R[4], the maximum positional displacement width<br>
∆ymax is used, so that there are Rpw[4]=103 dots.<br>
As indicated by (A) in FIG. 16, the first dot<br>
from the left through the dot at Rpw[1] in the image of<br>
the original raster image storing region P are allocated<br>
to the recording head R[1]. The dot at Rpw[1]+1 through<br>
the dot at Rpw[1]+Rpw[2] are allocated to the recording<br>
head R[2]. The dot at Rpw[1]+Rpw[2]+1 through the dot<br>
at Rpw[l]+Rpw[2]+Rpw[3] are allocated to the recording<br>
head R[3]. The dot at Rpw[1]+Rpw[2]+Rpw[3]+1 through<br>
the dot at Rpw[1]+Rpw[2]+Rpw[3]+Rpw[4] are allocated to<br>
the recording head R[4].<br><br>
(Positional adjustment in height direction)<br>
At the same time, positional adjustments are<br>
made in the height direction according to yn.<br>
The original raster image storing region P is<br>
indicated by (A) in FIG. 16, and the recording image<br>
storing region Q is indicated by (B) in FIG. 16. Data<br>
in the height direction of the first dot from the left<br>
of the image in the original raster image storing region<br>
P, which is within the range allocated to the recording<br>
head R[l], are transferred to the first dot from the<br>
left in the recording image storing region Q, to be<br>
positioned starting from the dot at D{∆ynmax-∆yn[m] +1)<br>
counted from the top. Data in the height direction of<br>
the second dot from the left in P are transferred to the<br>
fifth dot from the left in Q, to be positioned starting<br>
from the dot at D{∆ynmax-∆yn[1]+1) counted from the top.<br>
In the range allocated to the recording head R[l], fine<br>
control is not performed; therefore, data of P are not<br>
transferred to a row in Q where the scanning information<br>
indicates a fractional number. The rest of the data are<br>
transferred from P to Q in the same manner, and last,<br>
data in the height direction of the dot at Rpw[l] from<br>
the left in P are transferred to the dot at Rpw[l]+9<br>
from the left in Q, to be positioned starting from the<br>
dot at D{∆ynmax-∆yn[1]+1) counted from the top.<br><br>
(Adjustment in fine control area QF)<br>
When there is a superposing region between<br>
the recording head R[1] and the adjacent recording head<br>
R[2], the fine control areas QF are usually superposed.<br>
Unless adjustments are made in the fine<br>
control areas QF, as shown in FIG. 17A, the bit scanned<br>
last by the recording head R[1] and the bit scanned<br>
first by the recording head R[2] are too close to each<br>
other; this causes stripes to appear at the boundary.<br>
In order to solve this problem, as shown in<br>
FIG. 17B, adjustments are made in the adjustment region<br>
of the recording head R[2], so that there are<br>
substantially equal intervals between scanning lines.<br>
A general description is made of the<br>
operation performed by the recording head<br>
R[m] (m=2,3, ...,N) in the allocated range. The data in the<br>
height direction are transferred to be positioned<br>
starting from the dot at D{∆ynmax-∆yn[m]+1) counted from<br>
the top. In the horizontal direction, fractional<br>
numbers in the positional displacement information are<br>
noted, so as to consider the fine control areas QF. A<br>
fractional number ∆yR in the region allocated to each<br>
recording head is obtained as follows:<br>
∆yR[m]=1-Rpw[m-1]+(w+∆y[m-1])x p<br>
The unit is in dots.<br><br>
In the first embodiment, when m=2, then<br>
∆yR[m]=0.3 is satisfied. This means that scanning<br>
intervals between scanning performed by recording heads<br>
Rb[m-1] and Rb[m] correspond to 0.3 dot by the<br>
prescribed image recording density p, as shown in FIG.<br>
18. In order to correct this fractional number in the<br>
fine control area QF, a width (u-l)+∆yR[m] including the<br>
fine control area QF is considered. This range is<br>
adjusted with u-1 scanning lines, and therefore, the<br>
images are preferably recorded with intervals of ( (u-<br>
1)+∆yR[m])/u. Accordingly, the scanning position 1[m,k]<br>
of the kth line (k=l,2,•••,u-l) scanned by Rb[m] is to<br>
be<br>
l[m,k]=(((u-l)+∆yR[m])/u)x k-∆yR[m]+1.<br>
Specifically, 0.3 dot is divided into four,<br>
and added into scanning intervals of the fine control<br>
area QF. As a result, as shown in FIG. 19, the<br>
following are obtained in the first embodiment:<br>
1[2,1]=1.525, 1[2,2]=2.35, 1[2,3]=3.175<br>
Image data are changed and transferred from<br>
the original raster image storing region P of the<br>
rasterized original image data (P) storing unit 22 to<br>
the recording image storing region Q of the image data<br>
(Q) storing unit 25, at a position where the scanning<br>
position 1 and scanning information L are closest. The<br><br>
above describes the case of m=2; the same process is<br>
performed beyond m=2.<br>
When all of the rasterized original image<br>
data (P) in the original raster image storing region P<br>
are transferred, and there is not enough data to be<br>
transferred to fill the recording image storing region Q,<br>
data indicating that the recording head does not<br>
irradiate a recording beam are also transferred.<br>
Supposing that there are N recording heads,<br>
the width that can be recorded by the N recording heads<br>
is not necessarily equal to the width of the rasterized<br>
original image data (P). If the width of the rasterized<br>
original image data (P) is narrower, there would be<br>
recording heads that do not record data within the<br>
rasterized original image data (P). In this case, the<br>
rasterized original image data (P) is not necessarily<br>
divided by N. For example, the width of the rasterized<br>
original image data (P) is divided by the width<br>
allocated to each recording head, and fractions are<br>
rounded up to integers, thereby obtaining the number by<br>
which the rasterized original image data (P) is divided.<br>
By transferring the recording image data from<br>
the original raster image storing region P to the<br>
recording image storing region Q as described above, the<br>
image data (Q) generated are displaced heightwise toward<br><br>
a direction opposite to the positional displacement<br>
information. Accordingly, the heightwise positional<br>
displacement is offset, so that the heights of the<br>
recording images are aligned. The recording positions<br>
in the width direction are also corrected, as shown in<br>
FIG. 20. A fractional dot smaller than an integral dot<br>
remains in the height direction; therefore, the<br>
fractional dot is added as Lh to the scanning<br>
information to each row in the height direction.<br>
The driving control units 31 shown in FIG. 10<br>
change driving timings based on the height information<br>
Lh of the scanning information. By changing the driving<br>
timings, the heightwise position of an image formed on<br>
the recording body can be changed by a fractional dot<br>
smaller than an integral dot. For example, the<br>
recording timing signals are adjusted to be in a cycle<br>
that is 16 times higher than a cycle necessary for the<br>
actual prescribed image recording density p.<br>
Accordingly, the scanning start position can be changed<br>
in units of 1/16 dots. By making this change based on<br>
the scanning information Lh, it is possible to offset<br>
errors by fractional dots in the height direction of the<br>
recording image.<br>
The image data (Q) of the recording image<br>
storing region Q are thus created. FIG. 21 is a<br><br>
schematic diagram of the created image data (Q).<br>
The above describes one example of a data<br>
position changing unit. The recording head records an<br>
image based on the image data in the recording image<br>
storing region Q thus created, and the scanning<br>
information.<br>
The pixels of the image are recorded in the<br>
above-described scanning order shown in FIG. 11. N<br>
recording heads simultaneously record N pixels. The<br>
height direction of the image corresponds to main<br>
scanning in the rotational direction of the drum, and<br>
the horizontal direction corresponds to sub scanning in<br>
the axial direction of the drum.<br>
(Process of image formation)<br>
An image forming process according to the<br>
first embodiment is described with reference to FIG. 22.<br>
Step S1: The original image data receiving<br>
unit 21 receives rasterized original image data (P), and<br>
loads it in the rasterized original image data (P)<br>
storing unit 22.<br>
Step S2: The image data (Q) generating unit<br>
24 rearranges the image data of the rasterized original<br>
image data (P) held in the rasterized original image<br>
data (P) storing unit 22 based on contents stored in the<br>
positional displacement information storing unit 23, and<br><br>
transfers the rearranged data to the image data (Q)<br>
storing unit 25.<br>
Step S3: The scanning information generating<br>
unit 26 generates scanning information in association<br>
with the image data (Q) based on contents stored in the<br>
positional displacement information storing unit 23.<br>
Step S4: The stage control unit 30 moves the<br>
movable stage to an initial scanning start position, in<br>
synchronization with the drum driving control unit 29 by<br>
using a synchronizing unit.<br>
Step S5: The stage control unit 30 receives<br>
scanning information with a scanning information<br>
receiving unit.<br>
Step S6: Image data (Q) associated with<br>
scanning information are transferred to the buffers 281<br>
through 28N.<br>
Step S7: Wait for data corresponding to one<br>
scan operation to be loaded in the buffers 281 through<br>
28N .<br>
Step S8: Move the movable stage to a position<br>
specified by the scanning information.<br>
Step S9: The driving control units 311 through<br>
31N turn on/off the recording beams according to data in<br>
the buffers 281 through 28N, in synchronization with the<br>
drum rotational positions.<br><br>
Step S10: Determine whether recording of data<br>
corresponding to one scan operation is completed.<br>
Step S11: Determine whether there is next<br>
scanning information. When there is, steps S5 through<br>
S9 are repeated for the next scanning information.<br>
Steps S12, S13: When it is determined that<br>
there is no more scanning information in Step Sll, the<br>
drum driving control unit 2 9 stops the drum, the stage<br>
control unit 30 moves the movable stage to a<br>
predetermined position, and the process ends.<br>
When positional displacement information is<br>
not changed frequently, the scanning information is the<br>
same every time; in this case, it is possible to use<br>
scanning information that is obtained and stored in<br>
advance, instead of determining the scanning information<br>
every time.<br>
The driving control units 311 through 31N, the<br>
drum driving control unit 29, and the stage control unit<br>
30 only need to consider the synchronization of image<br>
data with scanning information for one main scanning<br>
operation, regardless of the size of the image data (Q)<br>
or scanning information.<br>
The same amount of image data is sent to all<br>
of the recording heads, and therefore, all of the<br>
control devices for the recording heads can be mounted<br><br>
based on the same design. The recording heads are<br>
turned on/off based on only image data, and therefore,<br>
the devices have simple structures.<br>
The stage is controlled based on scanning<br>
information, and image data are associated with the<br>
scanning information. Therefore, even if the prescribed<br>
image recording density p is partly changed, the driving<br>
control units 31 are unaffected. Specifically, it is<br>
easy to design the generating unit of the image data (Q)<br>
separately from the driving units of the recording heads.<br>
It is also possible to perform design verification and<br>
operational verification for the generating units for<br>
the image data (Q) and the scanning information,<br>
separately from that for hardware such as driving<br>
control units. Accordingly, development costs can be<br>
reduced.<br>
This process can be programmed to be executed<br>
by a computer.<br>
(Variations)<br>
In the first embodiment, an image larger than<br>
the original raster image is provided in the recording<br>
image storing region Q. However, it is also possible to<br>
only provide image data corresponding to one scanning<br>
operation for each recording head. When performing the<br>
scanning operation for recording images, only images<br><br>
necessary for the corresponding scanning positions can<br>
be sequentially created and sent to the buffers 28i<br>
through 28N.<br>
In the first embodiment, the fine control<br>
area QF is provided on the left side of the image;<br>
however, this can also be provided on the right side.<br>
In the first embodiment, each original raster image is<br>
positioned to be aligned with the left side of a region<br>
of the image data (Q) allocated to one of the recording<br>
heads; however, this can also be aligned with the right<br>
side.<br>
In the first embodiment, when there are<br>
slight differences in density between left and right<br>
recording beams of adjacent regions, and the fine<br>
control area QF is provided on the left side, changes in<br>
the image pitch and changes in the image density occur<br>
simultaneously. Accordingly, differences in the density<br>
become visibly apparent. This is because positional<br>
adjustments are made with beams on the right side of the<br>
adjacent region. By providing the fine control area QF<br>
on the right side, the beams of the left side perform<br>
positional adjustments, and density changes occur on the<br>
right side. Accordingly, changes are gradually made, so<br>
that differences in the density are not visible.<br>
The fine control area QF can be provided at<br><br>
both the scanning start position and a position at which<br>
the scanning ends (scanning end position).<br>
[Second embodiment]<br>
The rasterized original image data (P) and<br>
image data (Q) similar to those of the first embodiment<br>
can also be used to operate the movable stage for<br>
performing spiral scanning. In spiral scanning, the<br>
movable stage is constantly moving at a fixed speed<br>
while the image is being recorded. Thus, the scanning<br>
is performed at a slant angle with respect to the drum<br>
surface.<br>
The movable stage is moved at a speed at<br>
which one scanning line is scanned during one rotation<br>
of the drum. Assuming that the prescribed image<br>
recording density is p and the drum rotation speed is dv,<br>
a moving speed xv of the movable stage can be determined<br>
by the following equation:<br>
xv=(dv/60)x(1/p)<br>
When p=l line/mm, dv=60 revolutions/second,<br>
the obtained moving speed is xv=l mm/second.<br>
The scanning is performed at a slant angle,<br>
which angle is formed as one scanning operation is<br>
performed during one drum rotation. This does not cause<br>
a problem as long as the scanning pitch is sufficiently<br>
small with respect to the drum circumference.<br><br>
[Third embodiment]<br>
In order to provide an area with different<br>
recording density such as the fine control area QF, it<br>
is necessary to change the moving speed xv of the<br>
movable stage. However, it is difficult to change the<br>
moving speed during a continuous scanning operation. By<br>
changing the moving speed xv, the slant scanning angle<br>
changes, which causes visible stripes. When the<br>
scanning lines are divided in the main scanning<br>
direction in an attempt to correct the slant angles and<br>
make the stripes not visible, intervals between recorded<br>
dots change in the main scanning direction. As a result,<br>
stripes different from those before the correction are<br>
formed.<br>
Accordingly, in a third embodiment, scanning<br>
information is used to rearrange the order of recording<br>
image data, so that an image including an area with a<br>
different recording density can be scanned without<br>
changing the moving speed xv of the movable stage.<br>
The recording density is increased in the<br>
fine control area QF. However, it is considered that<br>
the fine control area QF includes plural regions having<br>
the same scanning intervals with different starting<br>
positions being superposed on one another. Accordingly,<br>
the recording densities of the regions are equal, so<br><br>
that there is no need to change the speed of the movable<br>
stage.<br>
In this example, it is assumed that the<br>
scanning information is similar to the first embodiment,<br>
as L[1]=1, L[2]=1.25, L[3]=1.5, L[4]=1.75, L[5]=2,<br>
L[6]=2.25, L[7]=2.5, L[8]=2.75, L[9]=3, L[10]=3.25,<br>
L[11]=3.5, L[12]=3.75, L[13]=4, L[14]=5, L [15] =6, ' • • .<br>
As shown in FIG. 23, the scanning information<br>
is divided into four scanning groups. The first<br>
scanning group A includes L[2]=1.25, L[6]=2.25,<br>
L[10]=3.25, the second scanning group B includes<br>
L[3]=1.5, L[7]=2.5, L[11]=3.5, the third scanning group<br>
C includes L[4]=1.75, L[8]=2.75, L[12]=3.75, and the<br>
fourth scanning group D includes L[1]=1, L[5]=2, L[9]=3,<br>
L[13]=4, L[14]=5, L[15]=6. Scanning intervals between<br>
scanning information are 1 in all groups. The only<br>
differences are start positions.<br>
As shown in FIG. 23, every time one scanning<br>
group is recorded, the movable stage is moved backward<br>
to the initial position. Then, the image record start<br>
position is shifted by 1/4 scan before recording the<br>
next scanning group.<br>
Based on the scanning positions included in<br>
the scanning information, the image data and L are<br>
rearranged into the order of being scanned. Thus, a new<br><br>
set of scanning information LN is provided, as<br>
LN[1]=L[2]=1.25, LN[2]=L[6]=2.25, LN [4]=L[10]=3.25,<br>
LN[5]= L[3]=1.5, LN[6]= L[7]=2.5, LN[7]= L[ll]=3.5,<br>
LN[8]= L[4]=1.75, LN[9]= L[8]=2.75, LN[10]= L[12]=3.75,<br>
LN[11]= L[l]=1, LN[12]= L[5]=2, LN[13]= L[9]=3, LN[14]=<br>
L[13]=4, LN[14]= L[14]=5, LN[15]= L[15]=6,..., and is<br>
associated with the rearranged image data. In spiral<br>
scanning, in order to align scanning positions on the<br>
recording body, the movable stage is synchronized with<br>
the rotational position of the drum, so that scanning<br>
positions can be reproduced. An image recording device<br>
sequentially moves the movable stage according to the<br>
scanning information LN. The image recording device<br>
reads each item of scanning information, one by one.<br>
When the image recording device detects that the<br>
scanning position indicated by the scanning information<br>
is before the previous position, the image recording<br>
device temporarily stops the image recording operation,<br>
and moves the movable stage backward to a reference<br>
position, e.g., the home position. The image recording<br>
device moves the movable stage toward the scanning start<br>
position at a constant speed, and adjusts the timing<br>
with the drum rotation signal, so that the movable stage<br>
is aligned with the fractional position for the next<br>
scanning position. Then, scanning is started again.<br><br>
When the movable stage reaches the scanning position,<br>
the stopped image recording operation is resumed.<br>
Plural reference positions can be provided. The movable<br>
stage is to be moved backward to the closest reference<br>
position from which scanning can be resumed. By<br>
providing a reference position on the scanning side<br>
before the end position of image recording, at an<br>
appropriate distance in which the movable stage can move<br>
at a stable speed, the distance can be reduced compared<br>
to returning to the home position. Accordingly, the<br>
time required for image forming can be reduced.<br>
Scanning can be performed several times while<br>
the moving stage is moving backward. Because the<br>
scanning intervals are the same, the speed of the<br>
movable stage does not change. Accordingly, the slant<br>
scanning angle does not change, so that special<br>
corrections are unnecessary. An example of a scanning<br>
track of one recording beam is shown in FIG. 24.<br>
This method is applicable not only to spiral<br>
scanning, but also to other scanning operations such as<br>
step scanning. As the scanning intervals can be made<br>
equal, the energy required, the workload, and the<br>
frictional resistance of mechanical movement are<br>
stabilized when the movable stage is moving.<br>
Accordingly, errors in the positions of the movable<br><br>
stage can be reduced, so that image quality is less<br>
degraded compared to a case of changing the scanning<br>
speed.<br>
[Fourth Embodiment]<br>
In a fourth embodiment, it is assumed that a<br>
failure has occurred in the mth recording head of the<br>
first embodiment, and a recording beam cannot be<br>
irradiated from the mth recording head.<br>
In this case, the mth recording head does not<br>
record an image of the original raster image storing<br>
region P, and instead, the adjacent recording head<br>
records the image for the mth recording head.<br>
Specifically, the mth positional displacement<br>
information ∆y[m] and the m-1th positional displacement<br>
information ∆y[m-1] are changed as follows, to obtain a<br>
new ∆y[m] and a new ∆y[m-1]:<br>
new ∆y[m]=-w, new ∆y[m-1]=old ∆x[m-1]+w+old<br>
∆y[m]<br>
The recording region of the mth recording<br>
head is added to the recording region of the m-1th<br>
recording head, so that the recording region of the mth<br>
recording head becomes zero. Based on the new<br>
positional displacement information, the same processes<br>
as those of the first and second embodiments are<br>
performed.<br><br>
Accordingly, the m-1th recording head can<br>
form the image that the mth recording head is supposed<br>
to record. Image formation can be performed without<br>
using the failed mth recording head.<br>
Further, this technology can be used as a<br>
method of avoiding degraded image formation when a<br>
failure occurs in a recording head.<br>
Similarly, when failures occur in mth and<br>
m+1th recording heads, the recording region of the m-lth<br>
recording head can be used for recording images of the<br>
failed recording heads. However, it is not possible to<br>
exceed the region in which the movable stage can move.<br>
In order to ensure that image formation can<br>
be continued even when a failure occurs, the movable<br>
stage is capable of moving within a region exceeding two<br>
times the width of the prescribed recording width w.<br>
[Fifth Embodiment]<br>
It is difficult to completely match the<br>
densities of adjacent recording heads. If the<br>
difference in density is large, stripes become<br>
apparently visible. By mitigating the difference in<br>
density, stripes can be less visible.<br>
Accordingly, in a fifth embodiment according<br>
to the present invention, image data corresponding to<br>
one recording head are superposed with image data<br><br>
corresponding to an adjacent recording head at a portion<br>
of the image data where scanning density is high.<br>
Further, rasterized image data (Q) are generated such<br>
that a recording beam of one recording head and a<br>
recording beam of the adjacent recording head are<br>
alternately irradiated to form an image.<br>
An example is shown in FIG. 25. The last<br>
scanning position at which a recording head m records an<br>
original raster image is Zm. The area from the scanning<br>
position Zm to a scanning position Zm-4 of the recording<br>
head m corresponds to the boundary part (fine control<br>
area QF) adjacent to another region in the original<br>
raster image, as described in the first embodiment. In<br>
FIG. 25, three scanning lines scanned by the recording<br>
beam m are added (Zm-1, Zm-2, Zm-3) .<br>
Further, in the recording image storing<br>
region Q shown in FIG. 25, it is assumed that three base<br>
widths Nw are added, and four scanning lines are<br>
superposed at boundary parts. Three scanning lines are<br>
added in each of the fine control areas QF of Zm, Zm-1,<br>
Zm-2, Zm-3.<br>
Data indicating that no recording operations<br>
are performed are associated with scanning positions Zm-<br>
3, Zm-1 of the recording beam m.<br>
Scanning information for the recording beam<br><br>
m+1 is determined in a similar manner to the first<br>
embodiment; in this example, data indicating that no<br>
recording operations are performed are associated with<br>
scanning positions other than 1.25, 3.25, 5.25 and<br>
beyond.<br>
The original raster image is recorded<br>
alternately at a scanning position Zm-4 of the recording<br>
beam m and a scanning position 5.25 of the recording<br>
beam m+1; a scanning position Zm-2 of the recording beam<br>
m and a scanning position 6.25 of the recording beam<br>
m+1; and a scanning position Zm of the recording beam m<br>
and a scanning position 7.25 of the recording beam m+1.<br>
Accordingly, inconsecutive portions between<br>
image recording positions of adjacent recording beams<br>
can be reduced, and large differences in density can be<br>
mitigated.<br>
(Variations)<br>
In the above description, the recording beam<br>
m is associated with normal scanning, and the recording<br>
beam m+1 is associated with additional scanning.<br>
However, the recording beams can be associated either<br>
way in performing the alternate recording.<br>
Further, in the above description, the image<br>
data (Q) are divided into a number of regions<br>
corresponding to the number of recording heads; however,<br><br>
the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the<br>
specifically disclosed embodiment, and variations and<br>
expansions may be made without departing from the scope<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The present application is based on Japanese<br>
Priority Patent Application No. 2005-345872, filed on<br>
