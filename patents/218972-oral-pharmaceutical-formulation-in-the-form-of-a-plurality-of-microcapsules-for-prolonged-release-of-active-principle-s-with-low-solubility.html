				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The invention concerns microcapsules with prolonged release of active principles with low solubility, consisting of a core containing the active principle and coated with a polymer layer which controls the release of the active principle. The aim is that said oral microcapsules containing hardly soluble active principles, should have a coating film of sufficient thickness to ensure controlled permeability and should be adapted to industrial reproduction. This is achieved by the inventive microcapsules of mean diameter less than 1000 microns, and whereof the coating film contains a film-forming polymer (P1) insoluble in gastrointestinal tract fluids, a water-soluble polymer (P2), a plasticizer (PL), and optionally a lubricating surfactant (TA). Said microcapsules are characterized in that their coating films represents at least 3 % p/p of dry matter, relative to their total weight and their core contains a hardly soluble active principle and a solubilizing agent (polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil) which provides the core wherein it is contained with properties such that the behaviour of the exposed core (non-coated) in a given dissolving test (TD), is as follows: release of 80 % of active principle in less than two hours. The invention also concerns the use of such microcapsules in galenic formulation. (FIG. - 1)</td>

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The field of the invention is that of oral pharmaceutical<br>
formulation with modified release of active principle(s) (APs) with low<br>
solubility.<br>
In the present disclosure, the expression "modified release"<br>
denotes without distinction a release of the active pnnciple(s) beginning as<br>
soon as the pharmaceutical form has been brought into contact with its<br>
dissolving medium (in vivo or in vitro) or else a release of the active<br>
principle(s) beginning only after a predetermined period of time ranging, for<br>
example, from 0.5 to several hours. Thus, for the purpose of the invention a<br>
prolonging of the release corresponds to a release time for 50% of the active<br>
principle(s) which is typically several hours and which can extend from 0.25 to<br>
20 hours, for example.<br>
The expression "low solubility" relates to active principles the<br>
water-solubility of which is less than 10 g/l at 25°C.<br>
More precisely, the invention relates to pharmaceutical<br>
formulations with prolonged release of active principles with low solubility,<br>
this formulation consisting of a plurality of microcapsules consisting of a core<br>
containing the active principle of low solubility and coated with a layer of<br>
polymer which controls the release of the AP.<br>
Among the various modified-release systems, pharmaceutical<br>
systems with modified release consisting of a plurality of microcapsules of the<br>
reservoir type with an average diameter of less than 1000 microns are<br>
particularly advantageous. In fact, in these systems, the dose of active<br>
principle(s) to be administered is distributed among a large number of<br>
microcapsules (typically 10 000 for a dose of 500 mg and a diameter of<br>
400 microns) and this type of system, as a result.<br>
has the following intrinsic advantages:<br>
• the use of a mixture of microcapsules having<br>
different modified-release profiles makes it<br>
possible to produce release profiles exhibiting<br>
several waves of release or providing, by means<br>
of appropriate regulation of the various<br>
fractions, a constant plasma concentration<br>
level of the AP;<br>
• the sensitivity to the variability of gastric<br>
emptying is lower, since the emptying, which<br>
takes place here with respect to a large number<br>
of particles, is statistically more repro-<br>
ducible;<br>
• contact of the tissues with a high dose of AP,<br>
"dose dumping", is avoided. Each microcapsule<br>
in fact contains only a very low dose of active<br>
principle(s). The risk of tissue deterioration<br>
through local overconcentration of aggressive<br>
active principle(s) is thus avoided;<br>
• it is possible to combine several pharma-<br>
ceutical forms (immediate and/or delayed and/or<br>
prolonged release) comprising one or more<br>
active principles, in these "multimicro-<br>
capsular" systems;<br>
• it does not induce any degradation of the AP;<br>
• the amount of time spent by the microcapsules<br>
in the upper parts of the tract can be<br>
prolonged, which ensures an increase in the<br>
amount of time spent by the active principle(s)<br>
in passing in front of the absorption windows<br>
and thus maximizes the bioavailability of the<br>
active principle(s).<br>
However, when the solubility of the AP is low,<br>
the production of a microparticulate modified-release<br>
form comes up against a substantial difficulty.<br>
The diffusion of the active principle through<br>
the coating film surrounding each microcapsule takes<br>
place under the action of the dissolved AP concentra-<br>
microcapsule. In other words, it is the difference in osmotic pressure of the AP<br>
between the inside and the outside of the microcapsule which drives the<br>
release. The internal concentration of AP is the saturation concentration. The<br>
external concentration of AP is, for its part, negligible under usual conditions<br>
(termed "sink"). The driving of release is therefore directly linked to the<br>
saturation concentration of the AP, i.e. to its solubility.<br>
For APs with low solubility, the saturation concentration of AP is<br>
relatively low and the diffusion of the AP to the outside is therefore, a priori,<br>
very slow, even for coating films that are not very thick.<br>
Furthermore, in any case, for thin coating films, the following<br>
difficulties are encountered:<br>
(a) The depositing of a very thin coating film is not<br>
even: there are gaps next to areas that are too thick, and the<br>
release of the AP is not prolonged.<br>
(b) The industrial control of the process for a very thin<br>
deposit becomes very difficult and relatively unreproducible.<br>
Moreover, for thicker coating films, the release of the AP is<br>
extremely slow, or even nonexistent.<br>
The difficulty in modifying the release of an AP with low<br>
solubility explains the small number of technical solutions which have been<br>
proposed to date.<br>
As regards the solid, multimicrocapsular pharmaceutical systems,<br>
those consisting of a multiplicity of particles or microcapsules each carrying<br>
active principle(s) coated with a film-coating layer based on ethylcellulose, on<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, on magnesium stearate and on castor oil, for example,<br>
are known. Such a pharmaceutical system is disclosed in Indian Patent No<br>
184,436. These microcapsule reservoirs obtain an advantage from their<br>
multiplicity, which is a more even and reproducible gastric emptying time. In<br>
addition, their size is between 50 and 1000 µm<br>
and also the characteristics of their coating make it possible to increase their<br>
transit time in the upper parts of the gastrointestinal tract and, consequently, to<br>
maintain absorption of the active principle(s) for all or part of this time spent in<br>
the small intestine.<br>
However, the multimicrocapsular pharmaceutical system<br>
according to Indian Patent No 184,436 is perfectable as regards APs with low<br>
solubility that can be administered orally, since it does not propose any<br>
solution to the problem of the diffusion of such an AP with low solubility<br>
through a coating film of sufficiently large thickness, for example of several<br>
microns.<br>
As regards the prior art on microcapsulcs with modified release<br>
of active principles with low solubility, mention should first of all be made of<br>
PCT patent application WO 99/49846 which describes a pharmaceutical<br>
preparation composed of submicronic (0.05 to 10 µm) particles combining an<br>
active principle with low solubility with a phospholipid compound, a surface<br>
charge-modifying compound and a block polymer. The aim of this preparation<br>
is to improve the bioavailability and the stability of the active principle and it<br>
finds its applications in injectable forms or alternatively in forms intended to be<br>
administered ocularly or nasally. A prolonged-release form is only obtained in<br>
the case of intramuscular injection.<br>
PCT patent application WO 00/18374 describes an invention of<br>
the same type as the previous one: the active principle in the form of<br>
submicronic (
the surface of the particles and mixed with a polymer. This mixture can then be<br>
formulated into granules or pellets and, optionally, into tablets. The active<br>
principle is rapidly dissolved and it is the increase in bioavailability obtained<br>
by virtue of the decrease in size which makes it possible to have an effective<br>
plasma concentration over a prolonged period.<br>
Patent application GB-2 202 143 describes<br>
spheroids of diameter greater than 0.5 mm, and<br>
preferably greater than 0.8 mm, containing the poorly<br>
soluble active principle dispersed in 70 to 99.5% of<br>
microcrystalline cellulose. This matricial form<br>
requires no coating controlling the release of the<br>
active principle.<br>
Patent application JP-8073345 describes a<br>
controlled-release system composed of a film-coated<br>
granule. The granule contains an active principle with<br>
low solubility at neutral pH and inorganic acids. This<br>
system therefore proposes a solution that is only<br>
suitable for the case of basic active principles with<br>
low solubility.<br>
Finally, European patent EP-B-0 249 587 con-<br>
cerns a solid preparation for the slow release of an<br>
active substance with low solubility (
weight). This controlled-release preparation can be<br>
provided.: in the form of gelatin capsules comprising<br>
capsules consisting of coated granules. The granules<br>
comprise the active principle with low solubility and a<br>
solubilizing agent consisting of the commercial product<br>
Cremophor® RH 40 (polyoxyethylenated hydrogenated<br>
castor oil: 40 ethylene oxide units), and also other<br>
additives such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose,<br>
starch and lactose. These granules of size of between<br>
700 and 1120 Mm are covered with an ethylcellulose<br>
coating layer for controlling release. The ingredients<br>
of the granules, namely polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
cellulose, cornstarch and lactose, appear to be the<br>
elements of the hydrophilic gel system specific to the<br>
pharmaceutical form according to EP-B-0 249 587. These<br>
capsules therefore comprise a single constituent<br>
(ethylcellulose) in their coating layer, which limits<br>
its capacities in terms of modification of the release<br>
of the active principle. In particular, it is doubtful<br>
whether a coating layer composed only of ethylcellulose<br>
(known to form impermeable films) would allow the<br>
and industrially reproducible manner over a period of<br>
several hours, for example.<br>
None of these patent applications describes<br>
microparticles of the reservoir type or microcapsules<br>
for which the prolonged release of the active principle<br>
with low solubility is controlled by means of its<br>
diffusion through a membrane that is sufficiently thick<br>
to ensure a controlled and industrially reproducible<br>
permeability. Neither do they teach the manner in which<br>
such a system can be successfully achieved.<br>
In the face of this vacuity of the prior art,<br>
one of the essential objectives of the present<br>
invention is to propose a form with modified release of<br>
AP(s) with low solubility consisting of a plurality of<br>
microcapsules, each formed by a core containing the AP<br>
and coated with a coating film.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is<br>
to provide a plurality of reservoir-type microcapsules<br>
of AP of; low solubility, for oral administration of the<br>
latter, the coating film of these microcapsules being<br>
sufficiently thick to ensure a controlled and<br>
industrially reproducible permeability.<br>
Another essential objective of the present<br>
invention is to provide a plurality of microcapsules of<br>
AP(s) with low solubility, less than 1000 µm in size.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is<br>
to propose an oral pharmaceutical form consisting of a<br>
large number (for example of the order of several<br>
thousand) of microcapsules, this multiplicity ensuring,<br>
statistically, good reproducibility of the kinetics of<br>
transit of the AP in the entire gastrointestinal tract,<br>
such that better control of the bioavailability and<br>
therefore better effectiveness result therefrom.<br>
Another essential objective of the present<br>
invention is to provide a plurality of microcapsules of<br>
AP(s) with low solubility, for oral administration of<br>
the latter according to a prolonged and/or optionally<br>
delayed release profile, such that the half-release<br>
time, t1/2, is between 0.2 5 and 20 hours.<br>
Another essential objective of the present<br>
invention is to provide an oral form with modified<br>
release in which the AP(s) is (are) in the form of a<br>
plurality of particles individually coated to form<br>
microcapsules, and in which it is possible to mix<br>
several active principles in multimicrocapsular form,<br>
that are released according to different respective<br>
release times.<br>
Having set themselves all the above objectives<br>
among others, the inventors have, to their credit,<br>
developed a multimicrocapsular pharmaceutical system<br>
with prolonged release of AP(s) with low solubility:<br>
which makes it possible to adjust the AP<br>
half-release time to between 0.25 and<br>
20 hours,<br>
which is reproducible and easy to implement<br>
industrially by virtue of a ratio of the<br>
mass of the coating film to the mass of the<br>
particle of greater than 3% dry weight/dry<br>
weight, preferably greater than 5% dry<br>
weight/dry weight, and even more preferably<br>
of between 3 and 40% dry weight/dry weight.<br>
To do this, the inventors have, to their<br>
credit, discovered, after many trials, microcapsules<br>
with a particular structure which make it possible to<br>
satisfy the objectives recalled above, among others.<br>
Thus, the invention relates to microcapsules<br>
for the modified release of at least one AP with low<br>
solubility, intended to be administered orally and of<br>
the type of those:<br>
• each consisting of a core comprising at<br>
least one active principle and of a coating<br>
film applied onto the core and controlling<br>
the prolonged release of the AP(s),<br>
• the mean diameter of which is less than<br>
1000 microns, preferably between 800 and<br>
50 microns, and even more preferably between<br>
capsule contains the following components:<br>
? -I-- at least one film-forming polymer<br>
(PI) insoluble in gastrointestinal<br>
tract fluids,<br>
? -II-- at least one water-soluble polymer<br>
(P2) ,<br>
? -III- at least one plasticizer (PL),<br>
? -IV- and, optionally, at least one<br>
lubricating surfactant (TA);<br>
characterized in that:<br>
&gt; their coating film represents at least 3%<br>
dry weight/dry weight, preferably at least<br>
5% dry weight/dry weight of their total<br>
mass,<br>
&gt; their core contains at least one AP and at<br>
least one solubilizing agent having the<br>
particularity, as soon as it is placed in<br>
aqueous solution at a concentration of<br>
20% w/w at 37°C, of increasing the<br>
solubility of the AP by more than 50%.<br>
It is interesting to note that this original<br>
structure of microcapsules with a core comprising a<br>
solubilizing agent and a coating based on P1/P2/PL/(TA)<br>
is designed in such a way as to significantly improve<br>
the solubility of the AP in aqueous solution. In order<br>
to achieve this, the microcapsules according to the<br>
invention are in fact prepared in such a way that they<br>
facilitate the dampening of the surface of the AP<br>
crystals with water.<br>
The solubility of the active principle is, for<br>
example, measured by introducing the AP into an aqueous<br>
solution containing the solubilizing agent. The<br>
solution is stirred at 37°C for 6 hours and then<br>
filtered through a filter with a 0.2 µm pore diameter.<br>
The content of solubilized AP is evaluated by HPLC<br>
chromatography or any other suitable analytical<br>
technique.<br>
Preferably, the components P1, P2 and PL of the<br>
¦ mass fraction by dry weight of P1 relative to the total mass of the-<br>
coating of between 40 and 90%, and preferably of between 50<br>
and 80%;<br>
¦ mass fraction by dry weight P2/PUP2 of between 15 and 60%,<br>
and preferably of between 15 and 55%;<br>
¦ mass fraction by dry weight PL/PI+PL of between 1 and 30%,<br>
and preferably of between 5 and 25%.<br>
According to an advantageous variant, the coating film comprised<br>
component TA in a proportion of between 2 and 20%, and preferably of<br>
between 4 and 15% of the total mass of the dry coating.<br>
Preferably, the coating film represents 3 to 40% dry weight/dry<br>
weight of the total mass of the microcapsules.<br>
In accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention, the<br>
core containing the AP and the solubilizing agent may have either of the<br>
following structures:<br>
Structure A<br>
The core consists of a microbead approved for chronic oral<br>
administration, composed, for example and without implied<br>
limitation, of cellulose derivatives and/or of hydrophilic compounds<br>
such as sucrose and/or dextrose, etc. This neutral core is covered<br>
with a layer comprising a mixture of the AP and of at least one<br>
solubilizing agent as defined hereinafter.<br>

containing the solubilizing agent defined hereinafter.<br>

solve the technical problem that is the basis of the<br>
invention, one of the many advantageous characteristics<br>

As regards the preparation of the microcapsules<br>
according to the invention, this goes back to micro-<br>
encapsulation techniques accessible to those skilled in<br>
the art, the principles of which are summarized in the<br>
article by C. Duverney and J.P. Benoit in "L"actualite<br>
chimique" [Current use in chemistry], December 1986.<br>
More precisely, the technique under consideration is<br>
microencapsulation by film-coating, resulting in<br>
individualized "reservoir" systems as opposed to<br>
matricial systems.<br>
For further details, reference will be made to<br>
patent EP-B-0 953 359.<br>
The AP particles of desired mean particle size<br>
necessary for preparing the microcapsules according to<br>
the invention may be crystals of pure AP and/or AP that<br>
has undergone a pretreatment by one of the conventional<br>
techniques in the field, such as for example<br>
granulation, in the presence of at least one<br>
conventional binding agent and/or of an agent for<br>
modifying the intrinsic solubility characteristics of<br>
the AP.<br>
The present invention is also directed toward a<br>
medicinal product comprising the microcapsules as<br>
defined above.<br>
This medicinal product may be in solid form:<br>
tablet, gelatin capsule, powder, etc, or a in liquid<br>
form, for example an aqueous suspension.<br>
In accordance with the invention, it is also<br>
proposed, as a solution to the problems mentioned at<br>
the beginning of the present disclosure, namely:<br>
modified, preferably prolonged, release of APs with low<br>
solubility, in a pharmaceutical form that can be<br>
readily swallowed, all this in a perspective of long,<br>
effective and safe therapeutic coverage,<br>
to use a plurality of microcapsules:<br>
• each consisting of a core comprising at least<br>
one active principle and of a coating film<br>
applied onto the core and controlling the<br>
prolonged release of the AP(s),<br>
• the mean diameter of which is less than<br>
1000 microns, preferably between 800 and<br>
50 microns, and even more preferably between<br>
600 and 100 microns,<br>

capsule contains the following components:<br>
? -I-- at least one film-forming polymer<br>
(P1) insoluble in gastrointestinal<br>
tract fluids,<br>
? -II-- at least one water-soluble polymer<br>
(P2),<br>
? -III- at least one plasticizer (PL),<br>
? -IV- and, optionally, at least one<br>
lubricating surfactant (TA);<br>
characterized in that:<br>
&gt; the coating film of the microcapsules<br>

weight, preferably at least 5% dry<br>
weight/dry weight of the total mass,<br>
&gt; and their core contains at least one AP and<br>
at least one solubilizing agent having the<br>
particularity, as soon as it is placed in<br>
aqueous solution at a concentration of<br>
20% w/w at 37°C, of increasing the<br>
solubility of the AP by more than 50%,<br>
for producing a medicinal product based on at least one<br>
AP with low solubility which can be administered<br>
orally, which can be readily swallowed, and which is<br>
released in vivo in a controlled, prolonged and,<br>
optionally, delayed manner.<br>
According to yet another of its objects, the<br>
present invention relates to a method of therapeutic<br>
treatment, in which use is made of a medicinal product<br>
as defined above as a product per se or as a product<br>
obtained by means of the method described above.<br>

terms of its composition and the properties and<br>
obtaining thereof, on reading the examples below, given<br>
only by way of illustration and making it possible to<br>

Example 1<br>
1.1 - Preparation of spironolactone microcapsules:<br>
Step 1: Granule<br>
180 g of spironolactone, 100 g of polyoxyethylenated<br>
hydrogenated castor oil (40 ethylene oxide units), sold<br>
under the trademark Cremophor® RH 40, and 120 g of<br>
povidone (Plasdone® K29/32) are solubilized beforehand<br>
in a water/acetone/isopropanol (5/57/38 m/m) mixture.<br>
This solution is then sprayed onto 800 g of<br>
Celphere® CP-305 cellulose spheres (Asahi Kasei;<br>
diameter of between 300 and 500 µm) in a Glatt® GPC-Gl<br>
fluidized air bed device.<br>
Step 2: Coating<br>
50 g of granules obtained above are coated with 1.60 g<br>
of ethylcellulose (Ethocel® 7 Premium), 0.16 g of<br>
dibutyl sebacate, 0.64 g of polyoxyethylenated<br>
hydrogenated castor oil (40 ethylene oxide units), sold<br>
under the trademark Cremophor® RH 40 and 0.80 g of<br>
povidone (Plasdone® K29/32) dissolved in an acetone/<br>
isopropanol (60/40 m/m) mixture, in a miniGlatt<br>
fluidized air bed device.<br>
1.3 - Increase in solubility<br>
In an aqueous solution at pH-6.8 and comprising 20% by<br>
weight of Cremophor® RH 40, the solubility at 25°C of<br>
the spironolactone, which, without solubilizing agent,<br>
is of the order of 38 mg/1, is multiplied by a factor<br>
of 5.<br>
1.4 - Dissolving Test (TD):<br>
The kinetics of release of the spironolactone are<br>
determined by means of a dissolving test (type II<br>
device according to the European pharmacopoeia,<br>
3rd edition, phosphate buffer medium, pH 6.8,<br>
volume 1000 ml, temperature 37°C, 100 rpm paddle<br>
agitation, UV detection at 240 run) .<br>
The TD test is first of all carried out on noncoated<br>
granules, and then on microcapsules comprising these<br>
granules.<br>
TD test result:<br>
- Noncoated granules: release is complete<br>
(greater than 97% dissolution) at t = 1 hour.<br>
Microcapsules: the result is given in the<br>
attached fig. 1.<br>
The microcapsule composition described above makes it<br>
possible to obtain a modified-release profile over 8 h<br>
for very low-solubility spironolactone (0.02 g/1). The<br>
membrane represents 6% of the weight of the<br>
microcapsule, which ensures a release profile that is<br>
reproducible in an industrial process.<br>

The invention concerns microcapsules with prolonged release of active<br>
principles with low solubility, consisting of a core containing the active<br>
principle and coated with a polymer layer which controls the release of the<br>
active principlel The aim is that that oral microcapsules containing hardly<br>
soluble active principles, should have a coating film of sufficient thickness to<br>
ensure controlled permeability and should be adapted to industrial reproduction.<br>
This is achieved by the inventive microcapsules of mean diameter less than<br>
1000 microns, and whereof the coating film contains a film-forming polymer<br>
(P1) insoluble in gastrointestinal tract fluids, a water-soluble polymer (P2), a<br>
plasticizer (PL), and optionally a lubricating surfactant (TA). Said<br>
microcapsules are characterized in that their coating films represents at least 3%<br>
p/p of dry matter, relative to their total weight and their core contains a hardly<br>
soluble active principle and a solubilizing agent (polyoxyethylene hydrogenated<br>
castor oil) which provides the core wherein it is contained with properties such<br>
that the behaviour of the exposed core (non- coated) in a given dissolving test<br>
(TD), is as follows: release of 80% of active principle is less than two hours.<br>
The invention also concerns the use of such microcapsules in galenic<br>
formulation.</td>
