DESCRIPTION<br>
Radio Receiving System and Synchronization Detection Method<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a radio receiving system and a synchronization detection method, and more particularly, it relates to a radio receiving system and a synchronization detection method capable of detecting a synchronous position of a signal received from a mobile terminal unit through correlation synchronization in a base station of a mobile communication system.<br>
Background Technique<br>
In a mobile communication system such as a portable telephone set (for example, Personal Handyphone System: hereinafter abbreviated as PHS) rapidly developing in recent years, synchronization detection according to the so-called correlation synchronization is generally known as a method of finding out a synchronous position of a signal received from a mobile terminal unit (Personal Station: hereinafter abbreviated as PS) in a base station (Cell Station: hereinafter abbreviated as CS).<br>
Generally known synchronous position detection according to correlation synchronization is now schematically described.<br>
When a CS generally receives a signal from a PS in time division multiplexing, the CS cannot demodulate the received signal to data unless specifying a position where an information part of the signal starts (start symbol in a PHS: hereinafter abbreviated as SS) on an absolute time axis excluding an initial unnecessary component.   This operation of specifying the start position of the information (specifying the time position of the SS in the PHS) is generally referred to as detection of a synchronous position.<br>
The idea of correlation synchronization described below is widely employed as such a method of detecting the synchronous position.   In consideration of that the signal received from the PS includes a known<br><br>
reference signal common to all users, a known waveform of this reference signal is stored in a memory according to this method.    A combination of a preamble and a unique word is employed as the reference signal in the PHS, for example, and the preamble is formed by a bit string of repetition of "1001" while the unique word is formed by a prescribed bit string varying with transmission from the PS side and transmission from the CS side.<br>
The waveform of the received signal of a constant length is sliced with displacement, for calculating correlation between the same and the waveform of the reference signal stored in the memory.    A time position where the calculated correlation value peaks is specified as the synchronous position.<br>
The process of this specification of the synchronous position is described with reference to a waveform diagram of Fig. 11.    Referring to Fig. 11, (a) shows the waveform of the known reference signal stored in the memory of the CS.    On the other hand, (b) in Fig. 11 shows the waveform of the signal continuously received in the CS from the PS.<br>
When signal components are sliced from the received signal (b) with displacement by a time length equal to the time length of the reference signal (a) and the sliced waveform is compared with the waveform of the reference signal, the correlation value of these signals increases (1.0 when completely matching) if the waveforms match with each other while the correlation value lowers if the waveforms mismatch with each other. Referring to Fig. 11, (c) shows a correlation function consisting of such a correlation value of the reference signal (a) and the received signal (b).<br>
In the example shown in Fig. 11, the waveform of the received signal (b) on the time axis matches with the fixed waveform of the reference signal (a) in sections specified by broken lines ® and ©.   Therefore, it follows that the correlation value of the waveforms peaks on a time position (shown by a broken line ®) implementing such matching of the waveforms, while the correlation value lowers (approaches zero) in other time positions.<br>
Thus, it is possible to specify the synchronous position on the time axis by continuously calculating the correlation value of the fixed waveform stored in the memory of the CS and the partial waveform of the received<br><br>
signal and finding out the peak value thereof.   The above is the basic idea of conventional correlation synchronization.<br>
The aforementioned description of correlation synchronization is premised on that a signal from a single PS is independently received in the CS.    However, the CS may receive signals of the same frequency from two PSs in an overlapping manner.<br>
In path division multiple access (hereinafter abbreviated as PDMA) spatially dividing a single time slot of the same frequency and allocating channels to a plurality of PSs, for example, two signals of the same frequency may arrive at the CS in an overlapping manner.<br>
Regardless of such a PDMA system, further, the CS may receive a radio wave from another PS connected with a CS in another cell as an unnecessary interference radio wave in a state overlapping with a signal of the same frequency from a desired PS.<br>
In this case, the synchronous position of the signal from the desired PS cannot be specified by the aforementioned method of correlation synchronization.    Fig. 12 is a waveform diagram for illustrating such a state that the synchronous position is hard to specify.<br>
Referring to Fig. 12, each of (a) to (c) is a graph showing change (correlation function) of the correlation value between the fixed waveform ((a) in Fig. 11) and received waveforms in the case where two signals of the same frequency are received in the CS in an overlapping manner.<br>
When two signals of the same frequency are received in an overlapping manner, two peak values may appear on the correlation value as shown in Fig. 12(a), to disable identification of the signal received from the desired PS.<br>
As shown at (b) in Fig. 12, only a single peak value may appear between two synchronous positions where two peak values must originally appear, in place of the two peak values.<br>
When the two received signals are remarkably different in signal power from each other, the synchronous position of the signal having weaker power may be overlooked as shown at (c) in Fig. 12.<br>
As hereinabove described, the conventional method of correlation<br><br>
synchronization has such a problem that the synchronous position of the desired PS cannot be specified when the CS receives two signals of the same frequency in an overlapping manner.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a radio receiving system and a synchronization detection method capable of detecting the synchronous position of a signal received from a desired PS and correctly extracting the received signal by a method of correlation synchronization even when a CS receives signals of the same frequency in an overlapping manner.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention suppresses an interference wave component with an adaptive array in a receiver of a CS thereby extracting a signal received from a desired PS and obtaining a correlation value with reference to a reference signal stored in a memory.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram schematically showing the hardware structure of the receiver of the CS according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, signals received at n antennas ANTi, -, ANTn are supplied to the receiver 1 of the CS, subjected to amplification, frequency conversion and cutting of unnecessary frequency components in corresponding RF circuits RFi, •-, RFn, and thereafter converted to digital signals in corresponding A/D converters AD ADn.<br>
Outputs of the A/D converters ADi, •-, ADn are supplied to a digital signal processor (hereinafter abbreviated as DSP) 2, which implements each of first to third embodiments described later.    The DSP 2 finally outputs a signal from a desired PS in such a state that synchronization is established and an interference wave component is removed.<br>
A memory 3 is connected to the DSP 2, to hold various data<br><br>
necessary for processing of the DSP 2 in each embodiment described later.<br>
The output signal from the DSP 2 is supplied to an external device as an output signal from the receiver 1 of the CS.<br>
The-respective embodiments of the present invention executed by the hardware structure (particularly the DSP 2) shown in Fig. 1 are now described in detail.<br>
[First Embodiment]<br>
Fig. 2 is a functional block diagram for functionally illustrating processing of a DSP 2 according to a first embodiment of the present invention.   This block diagram expresses the DSP 2 as a combination of various circuit elements for illustrating the principle of operations implemented by the DSP 2, which executes processing along a flow chart shown in Fig. 3 in a software manner in practice.<br>
The operation principle of the first embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
Digital signals from the A/D converters AD ADn shown in Fig. 1 are supplied to first inputs of multipliers MPA1, —, MP An forming a first adaptive array (signal extraction means or interference removal means) as well as to first inputs of multipliers MPB1, —, MPBn forming a second adaptive array respectively.<br>
A weight vector calculator 4 also receives the signals from the A/D converters AD1, •••, ADn, and calculates a weight vector thereof.   The basic idea of calculation of the weight vector is now described.<br>
Assuming that A(t) and B(t) represent signals from users A and B respectively, a signal xl(t) received at the first antenna ANTi shown in Fig. 1 is expressed as follows:<br>
xl(t) = al x A(t) + bl xB(t) where al and bl represent coefficients changing in real time.<br>
A signal x2(t) received at the second antenna ANT2 is expressed as follows:<br>
x2(t) = a2 x A(t) + b2 x B(t) where a2 and b2 also represent coefficients changing in real time.<br>
Similarly, a signal xn(t) received at the n-th antenna ANTn is<br><br>
expressed as follows:<br>
xn(t) = an x a(t) + bn x B(t) where an and bn also represent coefficients changing in real time.<br>
The'above coefficients al, a2, •, an express that the antennas ANTi, ANTo, ", ANTn differ from each other in receiving strength with respect to the signal radio wave from the user A, and the coefficients bl, b2, •••, bn express that the antennas ANTi, ANT2, •••, ANTn differ from each other in receiving strength with respect to the signal radio wave from the user B. Each user is moving, and hence these coefficient change in real time.<br>
The signals xl(t), x2(t), ••, xn(t) received at the respective antennas are supplied to the first inputs of the multipliers MPBi, MPB2, -, MPBn forming the second adaptive array, and a weight vector wi, W2, •-, wn consisting of weights for the signals received at the respective antennas calculated by the weight vector calculator 4 in real time is applied to second inputs of these multipliers.<br>
Therefore, the multiplier MPBi outputs wi x (alA(t) + blB(t)), the multiplier MPB2 outputs w2 x (a2A(t) + b2B(t)), and the multiplier MPBn outputs wn x (anA(t) + bnB(t)).<br>
An adder ADDB adds up the outputs of these MPBi, MPB2, -, MPBn, to output:<br>
w1(alA(t) + blB(t)) + w2(a2A(t) + b2B(t)) + - + wn(anA(t) + bnB(t))<br>
This output is divided into terms related to the signal A(t) and terms related to the signal B(t) as follows:<br>
(w1al + w2a2 + - +Wnan)A(t) + (wibl + w2b2 + •- +wnbn)B(t)<br>
The weight vector calculator 4 calculates the above weights wi, W2, •••, Wn to be capable of identifying the users A and B and extracting only the signal from the PS of the desired user.   For example, the weight vector calculator 4 regards the coefficients al, a2, •, an and bl, b2, •-, bn as constants and calculates the weights wi, W2, -, wn so that the coefficients of the signal A(t) are 1 as a whole and the coefficients of the signal B(t) are 0 as a whole, in order to extract only the signal A(t) from the PS of the desired user A.<br>
Setting the weights wi, W2, ••, wn in this manner, the adder ADDB<br><br>
outputs the following output signal:<br>
Output Signal = 1 x A(t) + 0 x B(t) = A(t)<br>
This output signal is fed back to the weight vector calculator 4, for updating the weight vector values with reference to a reference signal stored in a memory 3.<br>
The weight vector wi, W2, ••-, wn of the frame of the received signals newly calculated by the weight vector calculator 4 in the aforementioned manner is expressed as WINEW, W2NEW, ••, WHNEW.<br>
The weight vector newly calculated by the weight vector calculator 4 is supplied to the multiplies MPBi, MPB2, •-, MPBn of the second adaptive array as described above, and stored in the memory 3.   The weight vector wi, wo, •-, wn of precedent frame stored in the memory 3 is expressed as WIOLD, W20LD, ••&gt; WnOLD, to be distinguished from the aforementioned just calculated weight vector.<br>
The signals received at the antennas ANTi, ANT2, -, ANTn are input to the first inputs of the multiplies MPAi, MPA2, •-, MP An forming the first adaptive array respectively, and the weight vector WIOLD, W2OLD, ••, WnOLD of the precedent frame stored in the memory 3 is input to second inputs of these multipliers.<br>
It is the basic principle of the present invention to apply the weight vector WIOLD, W20LD, ••• WnOLD of the precedent frame stored in the memory 3 to a frame of newly received signals in the first adaptive array when two signal radio waves of the same frequency arrive at the CS in an overlapping manner, thereby removing the component of the undesired signal radio wave for the time being for extracting the signal received from the desired PS (synchronization preprocessing) and detecting the synchronous position with the idea of correlation synchronization on the extracted signal.<br>
This principle is based on such prediction that the directions of arrival of the signal radio waves from the PSs of the users may not abruptly change in a single frame period of 5 milliseconds, noting that the undesired signal component (interference wave component) can be sufficiently removed also when applying the weight vector of the precedent<br><br>
frame to the newly received signals.<br>
Thus, an adder ADDA forming the first adaptive array synthesizes a signal Sy(t) for correlation synchronization subjected to removal of the interference component from the PS of the undesired user, and supplies the same to a correlator 5.<br>
The correlator 5 calculates the correlation function of the signal Sy(t) subjected to removal of the interference wave and the reference signal (preamble + unique word) stored in the memory 3 as described above with reference to Fig. 11, and supplies the correlation function to a peak detector 6.<br>
The peak detector 6 detects a time position where the correlation function calculated in the correlator 5 peaks as a synchronous position Sync, and supplies this synchronous position information to the weight vector calculator 4.   The weight vector calculator 4 regards the synchronous position Sync detected by the peak detector 6 as a start position (SS) of the frame of the received signal and starts calculating the weight vector WINEW,<br>
W2NEW,  •", WnNEW.<br>
The second adaptive array synthesizes the weight vector WINEW, W2NEW, ••-, WnNEw calculated in this manner with the frame of the received signal, so that the signal y(t) from the desired PS can be extracted in higher precision.<br>
Fig. 3 is a flow chart showing processing of the DSP 2 executing the operations of the functional block diagram shown in Fig. 2 by software.<br>
At a step Si, the multiplies MPAi, MPA2, •, MP An of the aforementioned first adaptive array multiply the received signals xl(t), x2(t), •, xn(t) by the weight vector WIOLD, W20LD, ••, WHOLD calculated in the precedent frame and stored in the memory 3, so that the adder ADDA synthesizes the total sum as the correlation synchronization signal Sy(t) (in the equation of the step Si, symbol  represents a conjugate complex number).<br>
At a step S2, the aforementioned correlator 5 calculates the correlation function of the correlation synchronization signal Sy(t) and the reference signal stored in the memory 3, so that the peak position thereof is<br><br>
frame to the newly received signals.<br>
Thus, an adder ADDA forming the first adaptive array synthesizes a signal Sy(t) for correlation synchronization subjected to removal of the interference component from the PS of the undesired user, and supplies the same to a correlator 5.<br>
The correlator 5 calculates the correlation function of the signal Sy(t) subjected to removal of the interference wave and the reference signal (preamble + unique word) stored in the memory 3 as described above with reference to Fig. 11, and supphes the correlation function to a peak detector 6.<br>
The peak detector 6 detects a time position where the correlation function calculated in the correlator 5 peaks as a synchronous position Sync, and supphes this synchronous position information to the weight vector calculator 4.   The weight vector calculator 4 regards the synchronous position Sync detected by the peak detector 6 as a start position (SS) of the frame of the received signal and starts calculating the weight vector WINEW,<br>
W2NEW, ••, WnNEW.<br>
The second adaptive array synthesizes the weight vector WINEW, W2NEW, •-, WnNEw calculated in this manner with the frame of the received signal, so that the signal y(t) from the desired PS can be extracted in higher precision.<br>
Fig. 3 is a flow chart showing processing of the DSP 2 executing the operations of the functional block diagram shown in Fig. 2 by software.<br>
At a step SI, the multiplies MPAi, MPA2,  MP An of the aforementioned first adaptive array multiply the received signals xl(t), x2(t), •, xn(t) by the weight vector WIOLD, W20LD, —, wnoLD calculated in the precedent frame and stored in the memory 3, so that the adder ADDA synthesizes the total sum as the correlation synchronization signal Sy(t) (in the equation of the step Si, symbol  represents a conjugate complex number).<br>
At a step S2, the aforementioned correlator 5 calculates the correlation function of the correlation synchronization signal Sy(t) and the<br><br>
detected as the synchronous position Sync by an operation corresponding to that of the aforementioned peak detector 6.<br>
At a step S3, the weight vector WINEW, W2NEW, •••, W0NEW is calculated by an operation corresponding to that of the aforementioned weight vector calculator 4 with the received signals x(t) and the reference signal stored in the memory 3, so that the received signals xl(t), x2(t), -, xn(t) are multiplied by the calculated weight vector WINEW, W2NEW, , WnNEw by an operation corresponding to that of the aforementioned second adaptive array.    The synthesized total sum is output as the signal y(t) from the desired PS.<br>
In the first frame of the received signal, weight vector is not yet calculated and hence weight vector calculation is performed by provisionally setting either one (for example, the higher peak) of the two peaks shown at (a) in Fig. 12 as the synchronous position, for continuing the operations of the aforementioned steps SI to S3 if there are no receiving errors.    When performing space multiplexing in the PDMA system, the start position (SS) of the precedently connected PS is known and hence the processing may be started by setting the other peak position as the start position (SS) of the signal from the PS requiring connection.<br>
[Second Embodiment]<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram for conceptually illustrating transition of modes in a second embodiment of the present invention described below and a third embodiment described later.<br>
In each of these embodiments, an operation mode for establishing synchronization by detecting a synchronous position, not yet detected, of a received signal by the method of correlation synchronization is referred to as a "synchronization capture mode", and an operation mode for maintaining the once established synchronization unless receiving errors are continuously caused is referred to as a "synchronization protection mode".   Detailed operations of the respective modes are described later.<br>
Fig. 5 is a functional block diagram for functionally illustrating processing of a DSP 2 according to the second embodiment of the present invention.    This block diagram expresses the DSP 2 as a combination of<br><br>
various circuit elements for illustrating the principle of operations implemented by the DSP similarly to Fig. 2, and the DSP 2 implements processing along flow charts shown in Figs. 6 and 7 by software in practice.<br>
The,operation principle of the second embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to Fig. 5.<br>
In the synchronization capture mode not yet detecting the synchronous position, switches SWAi, —, SWAn are turned on so that a first adaptive array synthesizes received signals xl(t), •••, xn(t) and weight vector WIOLD, W20LD, ••-, wn0LD of precedent frame stored in a memory 3 and a signal Sy(t) subjected to removal of an interference wave component is extracted and supplied to a correlator 5, similarly to the aforementioned first embodiment.<br>
The correlator 5 calculates the correlation function of the signal Sy(t) and a reference signal stored in the memory 3, and supplies the correlation function to a peak detector 6.<br>
The peak detector 6 detects a time position where the correlation function calculated in the correlator 5 peaks as a synchronous position Sync, and supplies the synchronous position Sync to a weight vector calculator 4 through a switch SWB turned on toward a fixed end SWl while storing the same in the memory 3 in the synchronization capture mode.<br>
The weight vector calculator 4 regards the detected synchronous position Sync as the start position (SS) of frame of the received signals, and starts calculating weight vector WINEW, W2NEW, •••, WnNEw.<br>
A second adaptive array synthesizes the weight vectors WINEW, W2NEW, -, WnNEw calculated in this manner with the received signals xl(t), •-, xn(t), so that a signal from a desired PS is extracted and output as an output signal y(t) through a detector 7.<br>
The output signal y(t) from the detector 7 is on one hand supplied to a receiving error determiner 8, which determines presence/absence of receiving errors.<br>
The result of determination of the receiving error determiner 8 is supplied to a synchronization mode determiner 9. When the receiving error determiner 8 determines that there are no receiving errors in the<br><br>
synchronization capture mode, the synchronization mode determiner 9 decides transition from the synchronization capture mode to the synchronization protection mode (arrow (D in Fig. 4), and stores a synchronization mode flag indicating the result in the memory 3.   When the receiving error determiner 8 determines that there are receiving errors, on the other hand, the synchronization capture mode is maintained (arrow (D in Fig. 4), and the aforementioned operations are repeated until the receiving error determiner 8 determines that there are no receiving errors.<br>
When entering the synchronization protection mode, the switches SWAi, , SWAn are turned off to perform no synchronization preprocessing employing weight vector of the precedent frame.    Substitutionally, a fixed end SW2 of the switch SWB is turned on so that the synchronous position Sync detected in the synchronization capture mode and stored in the memory 3 is supplied to the weight vector calculator 4 as the start position (SS) of the frame of the received signals.   Thereafter the weight vector calculator 4 calculates weight vector on the basis of the fixed synchronous position Sync stored in the memory 3 in the synchronization protection mode.   This is an operation based on the premise that the synchronous position does not fluctuate at a high speed every frame of a 5 millisecond unit.<br>
When receiving errors are detected in the output signal y(t) obtained by the weight vector calculation based on the fixed synchronous position Sync, the synchronization mode determiner 9 maintains the synchronization protection mode unless the number of continuously caused receiving errors exceeds a threshold (arrow (3) in Fig. 4).<br>
When the synchronization mode determiner 9 determines that the number of continuously caused receiving errors exceeds the threshold, however, the synchronization mode determiner 9 decides transition from the synchronization protection mode to the synchronization capture mode (arrow ® in Fig. 4), and stores a synchronization mode flag indicating the result in the memory 3.<br>
Returning to the synchronization capture mode, the aforementioned synchronization preprocessing employing the first adaptive array and the<br><br>
weight vector of the precedent frame is executed for detecting the synchronous position by correlation synchronization again.<br>
Figs. 6 and 7 are flow charts showing the operations of the functional block diagtam shown in Fig. 5 executed by the DSP 2 by software as a whole.<br>
At a step Sll, synchronization mode determination is executed for determining whether the DSP 2 is in the synchronization capture mode or in the synchronization protection mode at present.<br>
When the DSP 2 is determined as in the synchronization capture mode at present at the step Sll, synchronization preprocessing and calculation of weight vector as well as extraction of the signal y(t) from a desired PS are executed at steps S12 to 14.   The processing at these steps S12 to S14 is absolutely identical to the processing at the steps Si to S3 in the first embodiment shown in Fig. 3, and hence redundant description is not repeated.<br>
When the signal y(t) is extracted at the step S14, the signal y(t) is detected by an operation corresponding to that of the detector 7 shown in Fig. 5 at a step S15&gt; and it is determined whether or not the aforementioned detected demodulated output has receiving errors at a step S16 by an operation corresponding to that of the receiving error determiner 8 shown in Fig. 5.<br>
When it is determined that there are no receiving errors at a step S17, transition from the synchronization capture mode to the synchronization protection mode is executed at a step S18 (arrow (2) in Fig.<br>
4).<br>
When it is determined that there are receiving errors at the step S17, on the other hand, the number of continuous errors is counted at a step Sl9, so that the synchronization capture mode is maintained as such (arrow Q in Fig. 4) even if the count is 1 (step S20).<br>
When the synchronization protection mode is determined at the step Sll, on the other hand, the synchronization preprocessing and the detection of the synchronous position by correlation synchronization at the steps S12 and S13 are skipped for immediately executing array processing<br><br>
at the step S14.   At the step S14, calculation of weight vector is executed with the synchronous position Sync detected in the precedent synchronization capture mode stored in the memory 3 as a start position<br>
(SS).<br>
When it is determined that the demodulated output has no receiving errors through the steps S15 to S17, the synchronization protection mode is maintained at a step S18 (arrow ® in Fig. 4).<br>
When it is determined that there are receiving errors at the step S17, on the other hand, continuous errors are counted at a step S19 so that transition from the synchronization protection mode to the synchronization capture mode is executed at a step S21 if the count exceeds the threshold value at a step S20 (arrow © in Fig. 4).   When it is determined that there are no errors at least once at the step S17 while counting continuous errors, a continuous error counter is initialized to zero at the step S18.<br>
Thereafter these steps Sll to S21 are repeated for making transition between the synchronization capture mode and the synchronization protection mode and updating the synchronous position Sync in the synchronization capture mode.<br>
Handling in the case where weight vector is not yet calculated in the first frame of the received signals is as described with reference to the first embodiment.<br>
[Third Embodiment]<br>
Fig. 8 is a functional block diagram for functionally illustrating processing of a DSP 2 according to the third embodiment of the present invention.   This block diagram expresses the DSP 2 as a combination of various circuit elements for illustrating the principle of operations implemented by the DSP 2 similarly to Figs. 2 and 5, and the DSP 2 implements processing along flow charts shown in Figs. 9 and 10 by software in practice.<br>
The operation principle of the third embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to Fig. 8.<br>
In a synchronization capture mode not yet detecting a synchronous position, all switches SWAi (not shown), •••, SWAn are turned on toward<br><br>
fixed ends SWl, and a first adaptive array synthesizes received signals xl(t), •••, xn(t) with weight vector WIOLD, W20LD, •••, WHOLD of the precedent frame stored in a memory 3 so that a signal Sy(t) subjected to removal of an interference wave component is extracted and supplied to a correlator 5 (synchronization preprocessing).<br>
The correlator 5 calculates the correlation function of the signal Sy(t) and a reference signal stored in the memory 3, and supplies the correlation function to a peak detector 6.<br>
The peak detector 6 detects a time position where the correlation function calculated in the correlator 5 peaks as a synchronous position Sync, and supplies the synchronous position Sync to a weight vector calculator 4 through a switch SWB turned on toward a fixed end SWl while storing the same in the memory 3 in the synchronization capture mode.<br>
The weight vector calculator 4 regards the detected synchronous position Sync as the start position (SS) of the frame of the received signals and starts calculating weight vector WINEW, W2NEW, •••, W0NEW.<br>
A second adaptive array synthesizes the weight vector WINEW, W2NEW, •••, WnNEw calculated in this manner with the received signals xl(t), ••, xn(t), so that a signal from a desired PS is extracted and output as an output signal y(t) through a detector 7.<br>
The output signal y(t) from the detector 7 is supplied to a receiving error determiner 8 on one hand, so that presence/absence of receiving errors is determined.<br>
The result of the determination of the receiving error determiner 8 is supplied to a synchronization mode determiner 9.    When the receiving error determiner 8 determines that there are no receiving errors in the synchronization capture mode, the synchronization mode determiner 9 decides transition from the synchronization capture mode to a synchronization protection mode (arrow © in Fig. 4), and stores a synchronization mode flag indicating the result in the memory 3.    When the receiving error determiner 8 determines that there are receiving errors, on the other hand, the synchronization capture mode is maintained (arrow (D in Fig. 4) and the aforementioned operations are repeated until it is<br><br>
determined that there are no receiving errors.<br>
Entering the synchronization protection mode, the switch SWB is turned on toward a fixed end SW2, so that the synchronous position Sync detected in the synchronization capture mode and stored in the memory 3 is supplied to the weight vector calculator 4 as the start position of the frame of the received signals.   Thereafter the weight vector calculator 4 calculates a weight vector on the basis of the synchronous position Sync stored in the memory 3.<br>
When receiving errors are detected in the output signal y(t) obtained by the weight vector calculation based on the synchronous position Sync stored in the memory 3, the synchronization protection mode is maintained unless the number of continuously caused receiving errors exceeds a threshold (arrow (3) in Fig. 4).<br>
When the synchronization mode determiner 9 determines that the number of continuously caused receiving errors exceeds the threshold, however, the synchronization mode determiner 9 decides transition from the synchronization protection mode to the synchronization capture mode (arrow ® in Fig. 4), and stores a synchronization mode flag indicating the result in the memory 3.<br>
Returning to the synchronization capture mode, the aforementioned synchronization preprocessing employing the first adaptive array and the weight vector of the precedent frame is executed for detecting the synchronous position again.<br>
While the aforementioned operations are basically identical to the operations of the second embodiment shown in Fig. 5, the third embodiment shown in Fig. 8 modifies the operations of the second embodiment 2 in the following point:<br>
While the synchronous position Sync stored in the memory 3 remains fixed during the synchronization protection mode period in the second embodiment, the synchronous position Sync stored in the memory 3 is finely controlled in the third embodiment also in the synchronization protection mode period, as described below.<br>
When entering the synchronization protection mode from the<br><br>
synchronization capture mode, all switches SWAi (not shown), •-, SWAn are turned on toward fixed ends SW2, so that the first adaptive array synthesizes the received signals xl(t), •, xn(t) with the weight vector WINEW, W2NEW, •••, WnNEw of the current received signals calculated by the weight vector calculator 4 and the signal Sy(t) subjected to removal of an interference wave component is extracted and supplied to the correlator 5.<br>
The correlator 5 calculates the correlation function of the signal Sy(t) and the reference signal stored in the memory 3 and supplies the correlation function to the peak detector 6.<br>
The peak detector 6 detects a time position where the correlation function calculated in the calculator 5 peaks as synchronous position information Sync_tmp, which in turn is supplied to a first input of a comparator 10 through a switch SWC turned on in the synchronization protection mode.    The synchronous position Sync stored in the memory 3 is input in a second input of the comparator 10.<br>
The comparator 10 increments the count of a counter 11 by 1 when the synchronous position information Sync_tmp is greater than the synchronous position Sync (Sync_tmp &gt; Sync), and decrements the count by 1 when the synchronous position information Sync_tmp is less than the synchronous position Sync (Sync_tmp 
The count of the counter 11 is supplied to a synchronization follower 12, so that the synchronous position Sync stored in the memory 3 is updated in a positive direction when the count of the counter 11 positively increases to exceed a first threshold while the synchronous position Sync stored in the memory 3 is updated in a negative direction when the count negatively reduces below a second threshold.<br>
Thus, the received signals can be demodulated in higher precision by finely controlling the synchronous position information stored in the memory in a direction where the synchronous position deviates in consideration of that the actual synchronous position can finely fluctuate also in the synchronization protection mode period.<br>
Figs. 9 and 10 are flow charts showing processing of the DSP 2 implementing the operations of the functional block diagram shown in Fig.<br><br>
8 by software as a whole.<br>
In the flow charts shown in Figs. 9 and 10, processing at steps Sll to S21 is absolutely identical to the processing at the steps Sll to S21 of the second embodiment shown in Figs. 6 and 7, and hence redundant description is not repeated.<br>
In the flow charts shown in Figs. 9 and 10, steps S22 to S29 show processing specific to the third embodiment.<br>
When it is determined that the DSP 2 is in the synchronization protection mode at the step S22, the correlation function is calculated at the step S23 by an operation corresponding to that of the correlator 5 shown in Fig. 8.    Then, the time position where the correlation function peaks is detected as the synchronous position information Sync_tmp by an operation corresponding to that of the peak detector 6 shown in Fig. 8.<br>
At the step S25, the synchronous position Sync stored in the memory 3 is compared with the aforementioned synchronous position information Sync_tmp, for decrementing the count of the counter by 1 if the synchronous position information Sync_tmp is less than the synchronous position Sync (Sync_tmp  Sync).<br>
When the count positively increases to exceed the first threshold at the step S26 as a result of repeating updating of the count at the step S25, the synchronous position Sync stored in the memory is updated by +1 at the step S27.   When the count negatively reduces below the second threshold at the step S28 to the contrary, the synchronous position Sync stored in the memory is updated by -1 at the step S29.<br>
Thereafter these steps Sll to S29 are repeated for making transition between the synchronization capture mode and the synchronization protection mode and updating the synchronous position Sync also in the synchronization protection mode period in addition to the synchronization capture mode.<br>
Handling in the case where a weight vector is not yet calculated in the first frames of the received signals is as described with reference to the<br><br>
first embodiment.<br>
The embodiments disclosed this time must be considered illustrative in all points and not restrictive.   The scope of the present invention is shown not by the above description but by the scope of claim for patent, and it is intended that all modifications within the meaning and the range equivalent to the scope of claim for patent are included.<br>
