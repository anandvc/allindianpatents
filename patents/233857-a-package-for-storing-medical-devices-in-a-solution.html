RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a non-provisional filing of a provisional application,<br>
U.S. Pat. App. No.60/436,109, filed on December 23, 2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention related to packages for storing contact lenses as well as<br>
methods of using and preparing these packages.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Contact lenses have been used commercially to improve vision since the<br>
1950s. At first contact lenses were made of hard materials, which were<br>
relatively easy to handle and package for use, but were uncomfortable for<br>
many patients. Later developments, gave rise to softer more comfortable<br>
lenses made of hydrophobic hydrogels, particularly silicone hydrogels. These<br>
lenses are very pliable, but due to this texture and their chemical composition,<br>
they present a number of problems with packaging.<br>
Most contact lenses are packaged in individual blister packages having<br>
a bowl portion and a foil top, where the bowl portion is made from a<br>
hydrophobic material such as polypropylene. See U.S. Patent Nos. 4,691,820;<br>
5,054,610; 5,337,888; 5,375.698; 5,409,104; 5,467,868; 5,515,964; 5,609,246;<br>
5,695,049; 5,697,495; 5,704,468; 5,711,416; 5,722,536; 5,573,108; 5,823,327;<br>
5,704,468; 5,983.608; 6,029,808; 6,044.966; and 6.401,915 for examples of<br>
such packaging, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their<br>
entirety. While polypropylene is resilient enough to withstand the sterilization<br>
steps of contact lens manufacture, this material has an affinity for contact<br>
lenses made of silicone hydrogels. When silicone hydrogels are packaged in<br>
polypropylene bowls, the lenses stick to the bowl and cannot be removed from<br>
the package without damaging the pliable lenses. Therefore is a need to<br>
prepare a contact lens package that has resilient properties, but does not stick<br>
to the final product. It is this need that is met by the following invention.<br>

The term "molded base" refers to any polymer, rubber, or plastic that can<br>
be formed into a receptacle for medical devices, where the size and shape of<br>
the base are determined by the device and other considerations known those<br>
who are skilled in the art of making or designing molded bases. For example<br>
molded bases may be individual blister packages, secondary packages, or<br>
hydrating trays. The molded base may be prepared from any number of<br>
materials provided that those materials are compatible with the chemical and<br>
physical properties of the device. Examples of suitable materials include but<br>
are not limited to polypropylene, polyethylene, nylons, olefin co-polymers,<br>
acrylics, rubbers, urethanes, polycarbonates, or fluorocarbons. The preferred<br>
materials are metallocenes polymers and co-polymers made of polypropylene,<br>
polyethylene, having a melt flow range of about 15 g/10 minutes to about 44<br>
g/10 minutes as determined by ASTM D-1238. With respect to the shape of<br>
the molded base, examples of suitably shaped bases are disclosed in the<br>
following patents which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety,<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. D 458,023; 4,691,820; 5,054,610; 5,337.888; 5,375,698;<br>
5,409,104; 5,467,868; 5,515,964; 5,609,246; 5,695,049; 5,697,495; 5,704,468;<br>
5,711,416; 5,722,536; 5,573,108; 5,823,327; 5,704,468; 5,983,608; 6,029,808;<br>
6,044,966; and 6,401,915. As in the cited references, the molded based is<br>
sealed about the cavity that encloses the contact lens. Flexible cover sheets<br>
can be made from can be an adhesive laminate of an aluminum foil and a<br>
polypropylene film or any other extruded or co-extruded film that can be sealed<br>
to the top surface of the flange in order to form a hermetic seal for the medical<br>
device and the solution. Further, the base can be formed by any of a number<br>
of known methods which include but are not limited to injection molding,<br>
transfer molding, skin packaging, blow molding, coinjection molding, film<br>
extrusion, or film coextrusion.<br>
As used herein the term "additive" refers to a substance that is added to<br>
the polymer, rubber, or plastic prior to forming the molded base, where the<br>
material inhibits sticking, adherence, or adhesion of the medical device to the<br>
molded base. The additive is mixed with the remainder of the molded base<br>
material and amount of additive present by weight percentage based on the<br>
total weight of the molded base material is greater than about 0.25 to about 10<br>
weight percent, preferably greater than about 0.25 to about 5 weight percent,<br>
most preferably about 0.25 to about 3 weight percent. The preferred additives<br>
are glycerol monostearate (2%), polyvinylpyrolidone (1% to 5%),<br>
polyvinylpyrolidone/maleic anhydride (1/1% to 5/5%), and succinic acid (5%).<br>
Polyvinylpyrolidinone has a variety of molecular weight ranges (as indicated by<br>
the KD#) and consistencies (flake, powdered/micronized). When PVP KD90 is<br>
used as an additive, it is preferred that it is powered/micronized.<br>
The term "solution" refers to any liquid medium in which a medical<br>
device is stored. The preferred solutions are aqueous solutions contain<br>
physiological buffers. The particularly preferred solution is saline solution.<br>
For example, if the medical device is a contact lens, it is preferred that<br>
the molded base is transparent to the degree necessary to permit visual<br>
inspection, UV sterilization or both. The preferred additives are glycerol<br>
monostearate present at about 2 weight percent, succininc acid present at<br>
about 5 weight percent, PVP KD90 present at about 1-5 weight percent,<br>
PVP/maleic anhydride present at about 1/1 to about 5/5 weight percent. If the<br>
inner surface of the medical device has a roughness of about 0.2 µm to about<br>
4.5 µm, the preferred additives are maleic anhydride or PVP/maleic anhydride,<br>
most preferably maleic anhydride.<br>
Further, the invention includes a method of reducing the adherence of a<br>
medical device to its packaging, comprising, consisting essentially of, or<br>
consisting of, storing said medical device in a solution in a package comprising,<br>
consisting essentially of, or consisting of, a molded base wherein said molded<br>
base comprises an additive, provided that the medical device is not a contact<br>
lens consisting of acqualfilcon A coated with polyHema. The terms molded<br>
base, medical device, solution and additive all have their aforementioned<br>
meanings and preferred ranges.<br>
When soft contact lenses are prepared, the lenses cured to a hard disc<br>
and subsequently hydrated with water to give the non-sterilized final product.<br>
During this hydration step, soft contact lenses often stick to the surface of the<br>
hydration chamber and it would useful to find a method of hydrating soft contact<br>
lenses which alleviates this problem.<br>
To solve this problem, the invention includes a method of hydrating a<br>
contact lens comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of hydrating<br>
said lens in a molded base wherein said molded base comprises an additive.<br>
The terms molded base, medical device, solution and additive all have their<br>
aforementioned meanings. The preferred values for the medical device, the<br>
solution and the additive are as listed above. The preferred molded base is a<br>
square or a rectangle.<br>
Other have tried to address the problem of a medical device adhering to<br>
its packaging. For example U.S. Pat App. No. 09/942,347, entitled "Textured<br>
Contact Lens Package," filed on August 29, 2001 and U.S. Pat. App. No.<br>
10/183,133, entitled "Contact Lens Packages,"filed on June 26, 2002 disclose<br>
solutions to this problem. The disclosure of these applications are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in their entirety. Even though those methods<br>
address this problem, it is contemplated by the inventors of this patent<br>
application that the additives of this invention may be incorporated into the<br>
packaging of each of the cited references.<br>
In order to illustrate the invention the following examples are included.<br>
These examples do not limit the invention. They are meant only to suggest a<br>
method of practicing the invention. Those knowledgeable in contact lenses as<br>
well as other specialties may find other methods of practicing the invention.<br>
However, those methods are deemed to be within the scope of this invention.<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of Packages with Different Additives<br>
Additives (identity and amounts listed in Table 1) were mixed with<br>
polypropylene (listed below). The material was injection molded to form the<br>
base portion of a contact lens package. The configuration of the package is as<br><br>
illustrated in Figurel of U.S. Pat No. 5,467,868 which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
Contact lenses made from acquafilcon A coated with polyhema, a<br>
silicone hydrogel, were added to individual polypropylene blister packs having<br>
different additives containing 950µL of saline solution and then the blister pack<br>
was heat sealed with an flexible cover. Lenses were visually evaluated for<br>
adhesion to the package after sterilization. The flexible cover sheet was<br>
removed and the molded base is rotated or jiggled without spilling the saline<br>
solution while a contact lens is observed to determine if it is adhered to the<br>
inner surface of the molded base. Lenses that do not adhere are free floating<br>
and pass the test. If the lenses adhere to the molded base in any manner they<br>
fail the test. The addtitive, its weight percentage, the number of lenses that<br>
stuck to the package, and number of lenses that were free floating are<br>
displayed in Table 1. This example illustrates that glycerol monostearate is a<br>
superior additive.<br>
Example 2<br>
Consumer Test<br>
Packages containing 2% weight percent GMS and Exxon 1605 were<br>
prepared using the method of Example 1. Contact lenses of types A, B, and C<br>
were added to individual blister packages along with 950 µL of saline solution.<br>
The filed packages were heat sealed with flexible covers and sterilized. The<br>
packaged lenses were submitted to consumers. The consumers opened the<br>
packages and evaluated the lenses for ease of removal of the lens from the<br>
package using the following criteria and grading system<br>
1-very easy removal-Lens comes out without any problems<br>
2-easy removal-a couple of attempts to remove the lenses, but overall<br>
there were no real problems in removal<br>
3-moderate removal- several tries before lens comes out neither<br>
pleased or displeased<br>
4-difficult removal-many tries to remove with finger or nail-removal is<br>
frustrating<br>
5-very difficult removal-many tries to remove with a finger or nail, lens<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the testing results for a companson of Lens A in a<br>
polypropylene package (control), Lens A in a package containing 2.0% GMS<br>
where the package has an average surface roughness (Ra) of about 2.0 nm,<br>
and Len A in a package containing 2.0% GMS. This figure shows that the<br>
roughened package containing GMS has the highest consumer rating.<br>

polypropylene package (control), Lens B in a package containing 2.0% GMS<br>
where the package has an average surface roughness (Ra) of about 2.0 µm,<br>
and Len B in a package containing 2.0% GMS. This figure shows that the<br>
package containing 2.0 %GMS has the highest consumer rating.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the testing results for a comparison of Lens C in a<br>
polypropylene package (control), Lens C in a package containing 2.0% GMS<br>
where the package has an average surface roughness (Ra) of about 2.0 µm,<br>
and Len C in a package containing 2.% GMS. This figure shows that the<br>
package containing 2.0 %GMS has the highest consumer rating.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of Packages With Different Additives<br>
