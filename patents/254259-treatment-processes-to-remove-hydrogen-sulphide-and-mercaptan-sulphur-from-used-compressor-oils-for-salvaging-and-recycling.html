FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to treatment processes to remove Hydrogen Sulphide and<br>
Mercaptan Sulphur from used compressor oils for salvaging and recycling.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION:<br>
Heavy water play crucial role in the generation of nuclear energy and is used as<br>
moderator and coolant in the reactors using Uranium as fuel. The viability of<br>
producing heavy water depends on the isotopic mass transfer rate and chemical<br>
exchange process involving hydrogen containing compounds such as H2, H2O,<br>
H2S, NH3, CH4 etc.. For acceptable isotopic mass transfer rate the bonds of the<br>
above molecules should be made labile. Among available Hydrogen containing<br>
molecules the bonds of O-H, S-H and N-H are so much labile that bond braking<br>
and making processes occur in isotopic exchange reaction without any catalyst<br>
at any temperature. Hence the exchange processes of H2S-H2O and NH3-H2O<br>
are preferred, as the reaction does not involve catalyst and can be conducted at<br>
any desired temperature. Thus heavy water production utilizes dual temperature<br>
exchange process of H2S and water for extracting Deuterium from water up to<br>
15% and subsequent enrichment to reactor grade through vacuum distillation.<br>
Thus Hydrogen Sulphide is used in large quantities as carrier gas, which is highly<br>
toxic and corrosive in nature. Hydrogen Sulphide gas booster compressors are<br>
used in the exchange units to make up the pressure loss for circulating the H2S<br>
gas through exchange unit towers. A dedicated seal oil system is provided for<br>
supplying seal oil to the compressor seal. The seal oil is likely to get<br>
contaminated with H2S over a period of time due to diffusion of gas into the seal<br>
oil and hence mixing of seal oil with lube oil result in the contamination of lube oil<br><br><br>
also. The lube oil is supposed to be free from H2S gas, as any traces of H2S in<br>
lube oil is critical and will effect the bearings made of white metal causing<br>
pressure loss to the exchange towers. In such cases, the contaminated oil<br>
cannot be used in the lube oil system and has to be rejected. The rate of<br>
rejection may be around 200 to 400 Liters per day which cannot be reused and<br>
the oil is difficult to dispose off due to the toxicity and environmental problems of<br>
H2S gas. Thus, large quantities of oil is to be rejected due to the contamination<br>
of H2S gas which is not economically feasible. When H2S gas dissolves in oil it<br>
causes formation of Mercaptans also.<br>
This patent covers reclamation and regeneration of used oil. During the process<br>
of dissolution of H2S in oil, there is a possibility of elemental sulphur and<br>
Mercaptan sulphur formation due to the oxidation caused by ingressed oxygen.<br>
The formation of Mercaptan Sulphur and other forms of Sulphur cause corrosion<br>
and damage to the copper containing components.<br>

OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a process for the removal of H2S &amp;<br>
Mercaptan Sulphur from the used compressor oils;<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for the removal of H2S &amp;<br>
Mercaptan Sulphur from the used compressor oils for recycling;<br>
Further, object of this invention is to propose a process for the reclamation and<br>
regeneration of used compressor oils.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for removal of H2S and<br>
Mercaptans sulphur from compressor oil comprising:<br>
adding adsorbents under heating in presence of nitrogen bubbling for a certain<br>
period of time with stirring;<br>
subjecting the oil thus obtained to the step of filtration.<br>
In accordance with this invention there is also provided a process as claimed in<br>
the proceeding claim wherein 20 wt% of dried molecular sieves 13 X is added to<br>
compressor oil and heated to 90°C with nitrogen bubbling for 2 hours with stirring<br>
are treated with 99.9% electrolytic grade copper powder and the temperature<br>
is increased to 100°C for 2 hrs and then filtered.<br>
Further, in accordance with this invention there is provided a process for removal<br>
of H2S &amp; Mercaptans from compressor oil by heating to a temperature of 90 to<br>
120°C in the presence of electrolytic grade copper powder or mixture of copper<br>
and silver powders<br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In petroleum industry, the H2S contamination is usually removed by caustic wash<br>
which is very effective and cheaper but caustic wash cannot remove the<br>
Mercaptans and free sulphur formed during the reaction with H2S gas. Further<br>
alkali treatment may remove the additives which are generally added to improve<br>
the performance of oil. Hence various reclamation processes were studied to<br>
remove the contaminants from oil so as to make it reusable. Keeping in view of<br>
the scaling up of the processes and economy of regeneration, different<br>
adsorbents such as animal charcoal, fullers earth, neutral alumina, molecular<br>
sieves, were tried in different combinations to achieve the goal of removal of H2S<br>
and Mercaptans below the instrument detection level as per the methods given.<br>
With the combination of different adsorbents, the treatment process can be<br>
scaled up continently to suit the batch size by designing columns with proper bed<br>
material as experimented in our processes.<br>
In this process the used oil is heated to 90°C with nitrogen bubbling for 1 to 2<br>
hours and then the oil is treated with electrolyte grade copper powder (20% by<br>
weight) at 120°C and stirring and filtered. The filtered oil is treated with neutral<br>
alumina at temperature of 60 to 70°C filtered. The contaminants like H2S<br>
Mercaptan Sulphur and elemental Sulphur were determined. When the treated oil<br>
is tested, it is found to be free from H2S, Mercaptan and elemental Sulphur.<br>
Experiments were also conducted with mixture of Copper and Silver powders (15<br>
and 5% by weight). There is improvement in the color of the oil and the oil has<br>
become more clear.<br><br><br>
The contaminated oil is degassed under vacuum for 2 to 4 hours at 60 to 80°C<br>
with stirring. The oil is then treated with dried animal charcoal (5 to 10%) and<br>
fullers earth (Korvi earth) (5 to 10%) and filtered. The filtered oil is tested for H2S,<br>
merchantman sulphur and elemental Sulphur.<br>
The contaminated oil is bubbled with nitrogen gas at 120, 240, 360 ml/minute for<br>
2 to 4 hours at 80 to 100°C and then treated with animal charcoal (5 to 10%)<br>
followed by fullers earth (5 to 10%)<br>
The contaminated oil is bubbled with nitrogen gas and treated with neutral<br>
alumina followed by animal charcoal and fullers earth<br>
The contaminated oil is treated with molecular sieve 13 X at room temperature to<br>
remove H2S gas and then subsequently treated with neutral alumina, animal<br>
charcoal and fullers earth to remove the Mercaptans, acid contaminants,<br>
moisture and to improve colour. The advantage of using molecular sieve 13X is<br>
to regenerate H2S gas by heating molecular sieves to 150° C. Thus, the H2S gas<br>
is recovered and reused. This process is usefull in a continuous process after<br>
scaling up by using a column with a bed of molecular sieves. The molecular<br>
sieves has got the capability adsorbing 50 g of H2S gas per Kg of molecular<br>
sieves.<br>
The oil is treated with molecular sieve 13 X with stirring and then treated with<br>
electrolytic copper powder at 100°C with stirring for 2 to 4 hours and then filtered.<br>
The filtered oil is treated with animal charcoal (5 to 10%) followed by neutral<br>
alumina (2 to 4%) and fullers earth.<br>
The physical and chemical properties of oil before processing and after<br>
processing by the above methods are determined. The H2S was tested by IP<br>
342/93 method by treatment with Cadmium Sulphate. The qualitative presence of<br>
Mercaptans were determined by ASTM D 4952 (Doctors test). The quantitative<br><br><br>
estimation of Mercaptan and H2S were determined by potentionmetric method<br>
using silver-silver sulphide electrode with nitrogen purging and by titrating the oil<br>
sample in a solvent like Isopropanol as per UOP 163-89.<br>
Further, the process of the present invention will be described in greater details<br>
with the help of the examples:<br>
Treatment with Copper, Silver powders and other adsorbent materials<br>
The treatment of the oil by the process given under 3.1, though effective, it<br>
causes oil to become dark in color, and the acid values are comparatively higher<br>
as compared to the other process. Treatment of oil given under 3.2 to 3.6 can<br>
effectively remove the Mercaptans and elemental Sulphur and the process is<br>
safe to handle as the reaction temperature is on lower side.<br>
Example-1<br>
Oil C (Process-1):<br>
100 g of compressed oil containing H2S and Mercaptan is taken in a beaker and<br>

Example-7<br>
Oil I (Process-7):<br>
100 g of compressed oil containing H2S and Mercaptans is taken in a beaker and<br>
treated with 10 g of molecular sieve 13 X and then heated to 90°C with Nitrogen<br>
bubbling for 2 hours under stirring. The oil is then treated with 20 g of 99.9% pure<br>
electrolytic grade copper powder under stirring. The temperature of the oil is<br>
slowly increased from 90 to 100°C over a period of one hour and the temperature<br>
is maintained at 100°C for 2 hours with stirring. At the end of 2 hours the stirring<br>
is stopped, the oil is allowed to settle and then filtered hot through a sintered<br>
glass crucible (G4) under vacuum. The colour of the oil is found to be brown. The<br><br>
physical and chemical properties of the oil after treatment are determined. Since<br>
the colour is dark brown and the acid value is high the process adopted under<br>
Example-4 is applied to remove the acids and also to remove any traces of<br>
Mercaptans present in the oil after treatment. The oil is heated to 80°C under<br>
nitrogen bubbling at the rate of 360 ml/min for 2 hours with constant stirring. At<br>
the end of 2 hours, the 5 g of previously dried animal charcoal is added slowly for<br>
period of 20 minutes through a separating funnel under stirring maintaining the<br>
temperature. The stirring is continued for 30 minutes. 10 g of fullers earth (korvi<br>
earth) dried for 24 hours at 105°C is added slowly for 20 minutes under stirring<br>
maintaining temperature and nitrogen sparging. The temperature of the oil is<br>
increased to 90°C and maintained for 2 hours with stirring. The stirring is stopped<br>
after 2 hours and the oil is filtered through a buckner funnel with a filter paper<br>
under vacuum. The physical and chemical properties of the oil is determined and<br>
are given in table-7.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The properties obtained after subjecting H2S contaminated oils to different<br>
treatment processes as compared to fresh oil and H2S saturated site oils are<br>
given in Table-8.<br>
In the model experiments H2S free compressor grade oil is taken and saturated<br>
by bubbling H2S gas and then subjected the oil by the above treatment methods.<br>
The H2S presence is tested by adding cadmium sulphate which did not show any<br>
precipitate indicating the absence of H2S. Similarly Mercaptan free compressor<br>
oil is mixed with known concentrations of Octadecylmercaptan or ethyl<br>
Mercaptan and subjected the oil to the above processes to find out the efficiency<br>
of the method for total removal of Mercaptan as indicated by Doctors test. The<br>
RBOT value of the treated oil is comparable with fresh oil indicating that the<br>
performance additives are not lost or depleted during the treatment. The debris<br>
after removal of impurities can be disposed off by incinerating.<br><br>
