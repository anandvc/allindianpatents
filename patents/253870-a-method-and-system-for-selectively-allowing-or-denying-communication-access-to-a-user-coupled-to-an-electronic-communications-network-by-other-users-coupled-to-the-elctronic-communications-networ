				<td>RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/574,239, filed 25 May 2004, entitled "Systems and Methods for Controlling Access to an<br>
Electronic Message Recipient through the use of a Plurality of Proxy Identities".<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure relates to computer networks and, more specifically, to a system and<br>
method for controlling access control over forms of electronic communications (e. g. "electronic<br>
mail", "instant messaging") where messages are directed between participants using sender and<br>
recipient identifiers.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The great strength of electronic mail ("e-mail") is the universal use of standard<br>
protocols that define the content and delivery of e-mail messages. Unfortunately, these standard<br>
protocols do not authenticate sender identities, making access control over e-mail a difficult<br>
proposition. In recent years, the lack of access control over e-mail has led to dramatic increases in<br>
the volume of commercial and other undesired messages ("spam").<br>
[0004] For over ten years, there have been hundreds of attempts to create a software system to<br>
control access to e-mail inboxes.<br>
[0005] At the time of this application filing, it is a widely held belief that existing anti-spam<br>
technologies fail to solve the spam problem in e-mail, to the extent that there are predictions that<br>
spam has put the medium in jeopardy of becoming unusable.<br>
[0006] The most common approach is what is collectively known as "spam filtering". Spam<br>
filters attempt to determine whether or not a message is desired based on an assessment of its<br>
content, the identity of the sender, or some other characteristic of the message.<br>
[0007] Filters tend to suffer from one or several common deficiencies. Filters frequently miss<br>
spam messages and allow their delivery and also incorrectly identify legitimate messages as spam<br><br><br>
("felse positive"). It's problem enough to miss significant numbers of spam, but blocking<br>
legitimate messages is simply intolerable for most users, especially in business where the filtered<br>
message could be of critical importance.<br>
[0008] Filters are easily bypassed since the properties on which filters depend to identify<br>
spam are frequently under the control of the sender (e. g. sender's identity, subject, message<br>
content).<br>
[0009] Rules-based filters require ongoing maintenance of the rules by users and<br>
administrators. Filters can be computationally expensive, as each message much be processed<br>
through all of the rules leading to latency in message delivery.<br>
[0010] A second approach to limiting access over electronic communications is to deny all<br>
access other than from authenticated sources, a technique typically known as "white listing". It's a<br>
system that allows messages to arrive "by invitation only".<br>
[0011] When a message is sent to a white list-protected e-mail address, the message is<br>
delivered only if the sender's identity is found on the white list. Messages from senders not on the<br>
white list are rejected, quarantined as suspect spam, or most-commonly, challenged. Each<br>
rejection behavior introduces it's own aggravation and disruption to legitimate communications.,<br>
[0012] White listing works because most spam senders do not want to receive reply messages,<br>
so message-based challenges mostly arrive to legitimate message senders only.<br>
[0013] Changes to the underlying e-mail protocols will not bring relief. The IETF (the body<br>
that defines and supports the RFC e-mail standards) already defined an authentication extension to<br>
standard e-mail communications in 1999 called ESMTP. Yet even though ESMTP has been with<br>
us for four years, few if any mail hosts require the use of ESMTP by senders because to do so<br>
would be to deny fee vast majority of messages sent with universal non-authenticated standard<br>
(SMTP). So no one will move to the ESMTP standard until everyone does, resulting in a continued<br>
and permanent dependency on SMTP.<br>
[0014] Commercial schemes that try to put a monetary control system (e. g. pay-per-message<br><br><br>
e-mail and bonded e-mail) over e-mail or that try to draw from legal intellectual property<br>
protection (e. g. trademarked poetry in message headers) require too much setup and follow-up<br>
aggravation to be acceptable to the majority of users.<br>
[0015] The key insight that led to the present invention was accepting that it is very difficult,<br>
if not impossible, to design a system that separates all desired from undesired messages when<br>
mixed in a single collection. The numerous attempts that attempted to do so have not delivered<br>
complete protection against spam without blocking legitimate messages.<br>
[0016] The solution resides in a system or method that can be adopted unilaterally by a user or<br>
enterprise that prevents desired and undesired messages from being mixed in the same collection.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0017] In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, a system for selectively allowing or<br>
denying access to a user coupled to an electronic communications network includes a receiver that<br>
receives an inbound message over the electronic communications network from a sender. The<br>
inbound message includes an identifier that is associated with a sender and an identifier that is<br>
associated with a recipient. The system also includes a processor that determines if the identifier<br>
associated with the recipient was previously generated by the user and is absent from a plurality of<br>
proxy identifiers associated with the recipient. The processor is further determines one of at least<br>
three security states associated with the inbound message. A first security state is indicative of<br>
allowing delivery of the inbound message to the user. A second security state is indicative of<br>
denying delivery of the inbound message to the user. A third security state is indicative of<br>
conditionally allowing delivery of the message to the user. Each of the three security states are<br>
associated with the sender identifier and the recipient identifier included in the inbound message.<br>
[0018] In one embodiment, the processor may be configured to add the identifier associated<br>
with the recipient to the plurality of proxy identifiers. Determining the recipient identifier was<br>
previously generated by the user may include isolating a portion of the recipient identifier to<br>
determine if the portion is included in the plurality of proxy identifiers. If the first security state is<br>
associated with the inbound message, the processor may remove the recipient identifier from the<br><br><br>
inbound message.<br>
[0019] In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a system for selectively allowing<br>
or denying access to a user coupled to an electronic communications network includes a receiver<br>
that receives an inbound message over the electronic communications network from a sender. The<br>
inbound message includes an identifier associated with a sender and an identifier associated with a<br>
recipient. The system also includes a processor configured to determine one of at least three<br>
security states associated with the inbound message. A first security state is indicative of allowing<br>
delivery of the inbound message to the user. A second security state is indicative of denying<br>
delivery of the inbound message to the user. A third security state is indicative of conditionally<br>
allowing delivery of the message to the user. Each of the at least three security states are associated<br>
with the sender identifier and the recipient identifier included in the inbound message. If delivery<br>
is allowed, the processor is further configured to add a footer to the inbound message. The footer is<br>
configured to serve as an interface for the user.<br>
[0020] In one embodiment, the footer may include information contained in the inbound<br>
message. The footer may include information representing the security state associated with the<br>
inbound message. The processor may be configured to adjust the footer for updating information<br>
represented by the footer. The processor may also be configured to adjust the footer for updating<br>
information represented by the footer, wherein the user initiates the adjustment. Based on the<br>
determined security state, the processor may delay delivery of the inbound message.<br>
[0021] In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a system for selectively allowing<br>
or denying access to a user coupled to an electronic communications network includes a receiver<br>
that receives an inbound message over the electronic communications network from a sender. The<br>
inbound message includes an identifier associated with a sender and an identifier associated with a<br>
recipient. The system also includes a processor configured to determine one of at least three<br>
security states associated with the inbound message. A first security state is indicative of allowing<br>
delivery of the inbound message to the user. A second security state is indicative of denying<br>
delivery of the inbound message to the user. A third security state is indicative of conditionally<br>
allowing delivery of the message to the user. Each of the at least three security states are associated<br><br><br>
with the sender identifier and the recipient identifier included in the inbound message. The<br>
processor is also configured to determine if the inbound message is exempt from the security states<br>
and to deliver the inbound message based on the security exemption.<br>
[0022] In one embodiment, the security exemption may be based on the identifier associated<br>
with the sender. The security exemption may be based on a domain associated with the recipient<br>
identifier. The security exemption may be based on the recipient identifier and the sender<br>
identifier including a similar domain. The security exemption may be based on the inbound<br>
message being a reply message to another message that was sent to exempt and non - exempt<br>
recipients. The security exemption may be valid for a time period. The processor may be further<br>
configured to store data that represents the delivery of the inbound message.<br>
[0023] In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a system for selectively allowing<br>
or denying access to a user coupled to an electronic communications network includes a receiver<br>
configured to receive an inbound message over the electronic communications network from a<br>
sender. The inbound message includes an identifier associated with a sender and an identifier<br>
associated with a recipient. The system also includes a processor configured to determine one of at<br>
least three security states associated with the inbound message. A first security state is indicative<br>
of allowing delivery of the inbound message to the user. A second security state is indicative of<br>
denying delivery of the inbound message to the user. A third security state is indicative of<br>
conditionally allowing delivery of the message to the user. Each of the at least three security states<br>
are associated with the sender identifier and the recipient identifier included in the inbound<br>
message. Determining the security state includes determining when a previous message was<br>
received that included the identifier associated with the sender and the identifier associated with<br>
the recipient.<br>
[0024] In one embodiment, the processor may also be configured to deliver the inbound<br>
message if the time period between reception of the inbound message and the previous message is<br>
less than a predefined time.<br>
[0025] In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a system for selectively allowing<br><br><br>
or denying access to a user coupled to an electronic communications network includes a receiver<br>
that receives an inbound message over the electronic communications network from a sender. The<br>
inbound message includes an identifier associated with a sender and an identifier associated with a<br>
recipient. The system also includes a processor configured to determine one of at least three<br>
security states associated with the inbound message. A first security state is indicative of allowing<br>
delivery of the inbound message to the user. A second security state is indicative of denying<br>
delivery of the inbound message to the user. A third security state is indicative of conditionally<br>
allowing delivery of the message to the user. Each of the at least three security states are associated<br>
with the sender identifier and the recipient identifier included in the inbound message. The<br>
processor is also determines if the security state associated with the inbound message has been<br>
escalated.<br>
[0026] In one embodiment, if the security state is escalated and the inbound message is<br>
associated with the first security state, the processor may associate the second security state with<br>
the inbound message in place of the first security state. If the security state is escalated and the<br>
inbound message is associated with the first security state, the processor may associate the third<br>
security state with the inbound message in place of the first security state. The security state<br>
escalation may be occur for a predefined period of time. Determining if the security state has been<br>
escalated may include detecting a predefined condition. Determining if the security state has been<br>
escalated may include receiving an instruction from a system administrator.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0028] The present invention (the "producf) provides systems and methods for controlling<br>
access in forms of electronic communications (e. g. "electronic mail", "instant messaging") where<br><br><br>
messages are directed between participants using sender and recipient identifiers, through the<br>
establishment and management of a plurality of proxy identifiers (" the proxies") that serve as<br>
substitutes to a protected original identifier ("the originator"), each of which proxies having a<br>
discrete security state defining access rights that correspond to the portion of the messaging<br>
community dependent on it for communications with the originator ("the contacts").<br>
[0029] Typically, there are at least three security states, and in many embodiments many more<br>
than three, that control the manner in which proxy identifiers (e. g. e-mail addresses) are restrictive<br>
of access to the destination identifier during the delivery of messages, are created, and are<br>
substituted for references to the source identifier in the message.<br>
[0030] The system may support multiple (i.e., more than three) security settings that<br>
' collectively interact with each other, resulting in a matrix of discrete security states and<br>
corresponding behaviors. The diversity of security states in this embodiment provides system<br>
behavior that is more precise than, for example, a binary state system where access is either<br>
allowed or disallowed. In this and other embodiments, certain communities of users can be<br>
permitted access where others cannot, even in messages sent to the same destination identifier.<br>
For access control, messages can be denied, challenged, quarantined or accepted, and each with<br>
variations.<br>
[0031] Proxy e-mail addresses may be defined in a variety of manners, including automatic<br>
creation and assignment by the product as messages are processed through the system, explicit<br>
creation and assignment by the enterprise or individual user, and implicit creation following a<br>
naming convention that predetermines the source e-mail address and initial security state.<br>
[0032] References to proxy e-mail addresses can be either translated or not translated to the<br>
corresponding source address, depending on the security state. For example, references to proxy<br>
identifiers that were created automatically by the product are replaced by the source identifier<br>
throughout the message. Explicitly created proxy addresses or defined via a naming convention<br>
(and are thus known to the user) are not replaced by the source identifier.<br>
[0033] The product is comprised of three systems: a Reflexion Mail Server (RMS), a<br><br><br>
AdrninistrationWeb Site (AWS), and a Database server.<br>
[0034] The three systems can reside on a single server or be clustered in a variety of<br>
configurations on multiple servers.<br>
[0035] Typically most external messages to and from the originator pass through the product.<br>
Messages from the originator to an external recipient ("contact") are herein called "outbound<br>
messages"; messages from an external sender (also a "contact") to the originator are herein called<br>
"inbound messages".<br>
[0036] The Reflexion Mail Server ("RMS") employs two storage queues, one in which<br>
in-bound traffic messages reside until the Security Module processes them (the "pre-processed<br>
queue"), and a second wherein processed messages and bounce messages are placed for final<br>
delivery (the "delivery queue").<br>
[0037] The sender and recipient e-mail addresses specified in the transport envelope of the<br>
SMTP delivery are the keys for the Security Module. The Security Module determines, based on a<br>
combination of interacting security states as defined hereinafter, whether or not the message<br>
should be delivered to the intended recipient. A variety of error messages and warnings can be sent<br>
back to the sender if warranted.<br>
[0038] Messages that are delivered typically have a footer attached to the bottom of the<br>
message by the RMS with a link to the Reflexion Wizard, a polymorphic browser interface that<br>
serves as the user's primary interface to the product.<br>
[0039] The Reflexion Mail Server also manages the creation and use of the arrays of proxy<br>
identifiers that is the core security apparatus of the invention.<br>
Proxy Addresses<br>
[0040] Each contact is assigned one or more proxy addresses, each of which is a<br>
RFC-compliant e-mail addresses (i.e., addresses compatible with the naming conventions of the<br>
most common e-mail protocols, see http://www.ietf.org/rfx.html for more information on e-mail<br>
protocols). In the context of this application, "proxy identifier" is synonymous with "proxy<br><br><br>
address".<br>
[0041] Each contact is assigned its own proxy address on first reference as either the sender or<br>
recipient in a message passing through the RMS. The product controls access to the infrastructure<br>
based on enterprise and user preferences and defaults, stored as properties on each security code.<br>
[0042] Following a message from an originator to an external contact:<br>
1.	An outbound message is processed through the existing e-mail infrastructure of the<br>
host enterprise and arrives at the product embodying the invention.<br>
2.	The product automatically assigns and records a unique proxy address as being<br>
registered for use by the contact. If a proxy address had previously been assigned to the<br>
contact, it will be reused.<br>
3.	All references to the originator's address in the header and body of the outbound<br>
message are changed to corresponding proxy address. For example, a message from the<br>
originator address:<br>
From: <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="88fbfbe5e1fce0c8ebe7e5f8e9e6f1a6ebe7e5">[email&#160;protected]</a><br>
is sent to an outside contact. As the message passes through the product, all references to<br>
the originator address <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7f0c0c12160b173f1c10120f1e1109511c1012">[email&#160;protected]</a> are changed to the proxy address that<br>
corresponds to the recipient, which in this example is:<br>
From: <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1764647a7e637f392625245774787a6776796e3974787a">[email&#160;protected]</a><br>
When the message arrives in the contact's inbox, the message appears to have originated<br>
from the address ssmith. <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="81b0b3b2c1e2eeecf1e0eff8afe2eeec">[email&#160;protected]</a> (emphasis on the ".123"), not from<br>
<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9fececf2f6ebf7dffcf0f2effef1e9b1fcf0f2">[email&#160;protected]</a>.<br>
In this example, me proxy address remains personalized to the originator's identity; the<br>
local part still has "ssmith" and the domain remains "company.com". In other<br>
embodiments, the proxy address-could just as easily sustain no visible provenance from<br>
the originator address. For example, an address such as <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5b6a69681b3834362b3a352275383436">[email&#160;protected]</a> can be<br>
assigned as the proxy address to <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="dba8a8b6b2afb39bb8b4b6abbab5a2f5b8b4b6">[email&#160;protected]</a>. In still another example an<br>
address such as <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fdcccfcebdcecfccd39e9290">[email&#160;protected]</a> can be assigned as the proxy address for<br>
<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5d2e2e303429351d3e32302d3c3324733e3230">[email&#160;protected]</a>. Typically each proxy address is unique with respect to the other<br>
proxy addresses such that each proxy address is distinguishable from the other proxy<br>
addresses.<br>
4.	After altering references of the originator address to be the proxy address, the<br>
message is delivered as with any unaffected e-mail message.<br><br><br>
[0043] Following a message sent from an external contact back to the originator via a proxy<br>
address:<br>
1.	An outbound message is sent to the proxy address by an external contact that<br>
ultimately arrives at the RMS.<br>
2.	The RMS Security Module determines the delivery disposition for the message<br>
based on the security state of the addresses involved, including but not limited to:<br>
a.	Message delivery denied, message offering no recourse to sender. End processing.<br>
b.	Message delivery denied, message offering new proxy to sender. End processing.<br>
c.	Message delivery accepted, message flagged as "suspect". Proceed to 3.<br>
d.	Message delivery accepted without reservation. Proceed to 3.<br>
3.	For messages authorized for delivery, all references to proxy addresses in the header<br>
and body of the inbound message are changed to corresponding originator's address. To<br>
continue the example, a message to the proxy address:<br>
To: <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="186b6b75716c7036292a2b58367b77756879766e367b7775">[email&#160;protected]</a><br>
When the message arrives in the contact's iribox, the message appears to have been sent<br>
from the external contact to the originator's address <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d6a5a5bbbfa2be96b5b9bba6b7b8aff8b5b9bb">[email&#160;protected]</a>.<br>
[0044] In this manner, proxy addresses on inbound messages are not exposed in the final<br>
delivery, making the mechanics of the access control protocol transparent to the user.<br>
[0045] Users can disable or restrict the use of one security code without affecting any other.<br>
[0046] Access control is difficult to circumvent because the security settings reside on the<br>
e-mail address itself, so it doesn't matter who the sender says that they are, or what they place in<br>
the message, the address itself will no longer work once disabled.<br>
About the Administration Web Site<br>
[0047] The Administration Web Site ("AWS") provides a full-control, full-disclosure<br>
interface to the proxy arrays, security settings and traffic history.<br>
[0048] The AWS is built on a three-tier architecture:<br>
1.	Java Server Pages and Servlets<br>
2.	Database Server<br>
3.	Application Server<br><br><br>
[0049] The server pages define the application interface, update and request data from the<br>
Database Server, and construct result pages and forms that are served to the user's browser by the<br>
Application Server.<br>
[0050] Within the interface defined in the server pages and servlets, mere are a number of<br>
application-specific objects.<br>
Users<br>
[0051] Access to the overall AWS requires success authentication of the user's credentials. In<br>
the preferred embodiment, the AWS requires a successful login using a user ID and corresponding<br>
password.<br>
[0052] Authentication and credential requirements are enforced on every page within the<br>
AWS.<br>
[0053] There are three levels of users supported in the AWS, each having different access<br>
privileges:<br>
1.	Super Administrator - full access and the only user type that can access the server<br>
configuration and control methods. Access to overall traffic history details and<br>
summary.<br>
2.	Domain Group Administrator (DGA) - full access to the domain group itself, the<br>
users of the domain group, and the traffic history for domain group to which the DGA<br>
is assigned.<br>
3.	User - Access to the user's own options, proxy addresses and personal history.<br><br><br>

Reflexion has different overall security modes by user:<br>
1.	Enforce - Denial and challenge messages are sent to<br>
senders when their messages cannot be delivered<br>
2.	Flag - Guarantees that all messages are delivered to the<br>
recipient. Messages that would be denied or challenged<br>
in Enforce Mode are instead "flagged" (i. e. given a<br>
visible indicator that the message would not have been<br>
delivered in Enforce Mode.<br>
3.	Pass Through - Messages to the recipient are to skip<br>
the Security Module altogether and go straight to<br>
delivery.<br>
4.	Reverse - Used to eliminate the dependency on proxy<br>
addresses, ostensibly in preparation for removal of the<br>
product. All security is dropped, and any message to<br>
a proxy address results in a request message being sent<br>
to the sender requesting that future messages to the<br>
recipient be sent on the original address. Messages are<br>
flagged on messages sent to a proxy address.<br>
As messages pass through the product, the RMS attaches a footer to<br>
the bottom of each message. There are three types of footers<br>
available to each user:<br>
1.	Standard Footer - Contains single link that connects to<br>
the Reflexion Wizard.<br>
2.	Advanced Footer - Contains a great deal of additional<br>
information and links not found in the Standard Footer.<br>
3.	No Footer - The Footer is not required; this type turns<br>
it off.<br>
Option to keep copies of messages that denied or challenged.<br>
Option to automatically exempt contacts when the user replies to a<br>
flagged message from the contact.<br><br>
The Server<br>
[0054] The Server object contains properties and methods that are specific to the entire<br>
installation of the product. The server object is available only to users with "super administrator"<br>
privileges.<br>
[0055] Most of the properties are related to the behavior of the product as a generic mail<br>
server. These include settings for the queue lifetime, IP address of the Administration Web Site,<br>
database backup schedules, etc.<br><br><br>
Domain Groups<br>
[0056] Each Reflexion installation can support any number of enterprises. Enterprises are<br>
managed as a Domain Group on the product. A Domain Group can have any number of domains<br>
under management, any number of users with addresses at these domains, and any number of<br>
Domain Group Administrators (DGAs) managing the Domain Group.<br>
Contacts<br>
[0057] Reflexion catalogs all of the external contacts that either sent or received a message to<br>
or from the user. A contact is both a proxy address with security settings and a security profile of<br>
the contact to which it is registered.<br><br><br>
Property _ Description	_<br>
Contact Name Name of the contact to which this contact's proxy address is registered.<br>
The Contact Name is parsed from inbound messages from the contact.<br>
True Address	The contact's e-mail address (not to be confused with the proxy<br>
address assigned to the user).<br>
Proxy Address The Reflexion proxy address assigned to the contact by the RMS.<br>
Security Status Each proxy address has one of the following security status:<br>
1.	Public - This proxy can be used and shared by anyone<br>
and messages to it will be delivered.<br>
2.	Protected - Only "appropriate" contacts can use this<br>
proxy address, inappropriate contacts will be challenged<br>
(Enforce Mode) or their messages will be flagged (Flag<br>
Mode).<br>
3.	No Share - Only "appropriate" contacts can use this<br>
proxy address, inappropriate contacts will be denied<br>
(Enforce Mode) or their messages will be flagged (Flag Mode).<br>
4.	Disabled - No mail to this proxy address will be<br>
delivered (other than for exempt senders).<br>
Message Store Option to keep copies of messages that denied or challenged. - !<br>
Auto-exempt	Option to automatically exempt contacts when the user replies to a<br>
flagged message from the contact.<br>
Name-on-the-Fly If enabled, allows new proxy addresses to be defined "on the fly" (i. e.<br>
(NOTF)	without any interaction with the product) that are derivatives of this<br>
contact's proxy address. For example, if the proxy address of this<br>
contact is:<br>
<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9ceceef3e4e5dcfff3f1ecfdf2e5b2fff3f1">[email&#160;protected]</a><br>
and NOTF is on, then the user can invent any new proxy address of the<br>
form:<br>
<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e8989a879091c6a08d9fa88b878598898691c68b8785">[email&#160;protected]</a><br>
where "new" is anything that the user wants. The NOTF proxy will be<br>
assigned to the first contact that uses it (see Fig. 13 to follow).<br>
Life Span	Proxy addresses can be assigned a limited life span. "When a proxy<br>
"expires", the security state is set to disabled.<br><br>
Exemptions<br>
[0058] Reflexion supports database entries that serve to identify sender addresses that should<br>
not be subject to security enforcement. There are four explicit exemptions that can be set by<br>
individual or enterprise users of Reflexion. Exemptions for e-mail are included, but the technique<br>
can be applied to any form of electronic communications:<br>
1.	Exempt a single sender identifier (e-mail address) for a single Reflexion user.<br>
2.	Exempt an entire host and domain (e. g. "company.com") for a single Reflexion user.<br>
3.	Exempt a single sender identifier (e-mail address) for all users at an enterprise<br>
4.	Exempt an entire host and domain (e. g. "company.com") for all users at an enterprise<br>
[0059] For each message sent to or received by a remote party (i. e. a sender whose address is<br>
not local to the protected enterprise), a match of the sender's address with any of the four<br>
corresponding exempt categories listed above will result in the party being treated as "exempt".<br>
[0060] An exempt sender is not subject to Reflexion security, which means that by being<br>
exempt, all messages from an exempt sender will be delivered. Messages to an exempt recipient<br>
will inhibit the use of a Reflexion address.<br>
[0061] The primary use of explicit exemptions in Reflexion is to insulate a remote party that<br>
is already dependent on the original address from having to change their behavior or the e-mail<br>
address used to reach the Reflexion user, specifically when a Reflexion user begin using the<br>
application with a pre-existing spam problem.<br>
[0062] The process by which a Reflexion user stops a pre-existing spam problem is as<br>
follows:<br>
1.	Increase security on the original e-mail address, typically raising the security state<br>
from "public" to "protected".<br>
2.	The known e-mail addresses and domains of legitimate contacts are exempted,<br>
allowing those contacts to continue using the original address unabated.<br><br><br>
3.	Security enforcement is set to "flag mode" to guarantee that all messages arrive to the<br>
user.<br>
4.	The user adds legitimate contacts that are not on the exempt list (i. e. whose messages<br>
arrive "flagged") to the exempt list.<br>
5.	When the Reflexion user believes that all legitimate contacts are on the exempt list,<br>
and all flagged messages are undesired, they may elect to change security enforcement<br>
to "enforce mode", after which time addresses and host and domains will rarely need<br>
to be added to the exemption list.<br>
[0063] The system also allows users to move contacts away from being exempt. As an option,<br>
each user or enterprise can instruct Reflexion to send a polite request to exempt contacts that they<br>
should change their e-mail address for the user to a unique proxy address, triggered by the arrival<br>
of a message from the exempt contact. When a message arrives at the recommended proxy address,<br>
the exemption status is cleared for that contact.<br>
[0064] There is an implicit contact supported by Reflexion. On any message sent by the<br>
Reflexion user to two or more external contacts, where at least one of the contacts is exempt and<br>
one of the contacts is not exempt, the non-exempt contacts) will have an implicit security-only<br>
exemption recorded for their address(es) by the application. This implicit exemption allows<br>
non-exempt users to bypass security on inbound messages (but will not inhibit the use of unique<br>
proxy addresses on outbound messages to them). See Fig. 6 for an example of why and how<br>
implicit security-only exemptions are supported in the application.<br>
History<br>
[0065] The product records descriptive information about each message that is sent in or out<br>
of the enterprise. The individual message history items are consolidated into totals for historical<br>
summary reporting and dropped after remaining online for a configurable length of time.<br>
[0066] Referring to FIG 1, the Reflexion Mail Server employs 2 e-mail queues, one queue for<br>
in-bound traffic wherein messages reside until the Security Module processes them (the<br>
"pre-processed queue") 102, and a second queue wherein processed messages and bounce<br>
messages are placed for final delivery (the "delivery queue") 106.<br><br><br>
[0067] Inbound messages (from either the mail server of the enterprise 100 or the mail server<br>
of the external contact 114) are received and stored in the inbound queue 102. Inbound messages<br>
from external sources 114 are subject to the product's security.<br>
[0068] Security enforcement takes place during receipt of the inbound messages using the<br>
SMTP protocol 112. As soon as the transport envelope sender and recipient addresses are received,<br>
the SMTP protocol handler sends a request to the Reflexion Security Module 110 to obtain the<br>
security disposition for this message 116. Subsequent processing of the remainder of the incoming<br>
message is predicated on the security response 118 returned from the Reflexion Security module<br>
108.<br>
[0069] If the message can be delivered, it is deposited into the pre-processing queue 102. If<br>
the message cannot be delivered, either a deferral or denial 120 will be sent back to the sending<br>
server 114.<br>
[0070] Messages that are subject to deferral are only deferred for some amount of time<br>
(typically 30 to 60 minutes). This is a test that the sending server 114 is "well-behaved". Many<br>
servers that send spam do not process deferred messages, thus deferred messages will not be resent<br>
from such sources.<br>
[0071] Using a typical queue scheduler, each inbound message is processed by the product's<br>
Message Translation module 104, which deposits into the delivery queue 106 either:<br>
1,	the message "as is", or<br>
2.	the message with some level of additions, modifications or other translation, to be<br>
described hereinafter<br>
[0072] The delivery queue 106 will deliver inbound messages to the internal e-mail<br>
infrastructure 100 of the enterprise or to an external destination 114. The delivery queue can use<br>
standard destination lookup mechanisms to resolve delivery locations (such as Domain Name<br>
Service DNS) or a routing table that sends mail to known internal domains to the internal e-mail<br>
infrastructure 100 and everything else to the Internet 114.<br>
[0073] Referring to FIG. 2, inbound message preparation is described. As the product<br><br><br>
processes mail, it updates the database with new proxy addresses, volume statistics and historical<br>
tracking. Figure 2 details the database preparations that are made during the receipt of an inbound<br>
message in the preferred embodiment.<br>
[0074] Inbound message preparation takes place before the security disposition is returned on<br>
a given message.<br>
[0075] Typically, the first thing that is examined on an incoming message is whether or not<br>
the recipient address is at a domain that is being protected by Reflexion 200.<br>
[0076] Note that a message that arrives at Reflexion must either be sent to an address whose<br>
domain is being protected by Reflexion ("inbound"), or be sent from such an address ("outbound").<br>
Local mail should be delivered locally; therefore Reflexion should never see e. mail to and from<br>
addresses at the same domain.<br>
[0077] It is possible for mail to be sent from one enterprise to another and have both<br>
enterprises' domains be hosted on a single Reflexion installation. In this case, the message is first<br>
processed as an outbound message from the first enterprise and then is treated as an inbound<br>
message to the second enterprise.<br>
[0078] If the sender's address has never been encountered by this installation of Reflexion<br>
202, it is added to the database table of "true addresses" 204.<br>
[0079] Next, the product searches the database to see if the recipient address is an issued<br>
proxy address 206.<br>
[0080] If the alias does not exist, it is still possible that the address was created through the<br>
naming convention known as, "Name-on-the-Fly" (NOTF) 210, in which case the proxy address<br>
should be created and registered to the protected user based on information drawn from the naming<br>
convention 212. If NOTF is not permitted for the unknown proxy address, the message is rejected<br>
208 (see Fig. 13 to follow for more information on NOTF).<br>
[0081] At this point, the proxy address exists in the database. Start tracking the result of the<br><br><br>
message for the history system 220.<br>
[0082] To find the user for which the proxy serves as a substitute, it's necessary in the<br>
preferred embodiment to navigate first to the user's original address 218 then from there to the user<br>
records 216. In other embodiments, this can be accomplished using numerous other strategies,<br>
however, it is necessary to have in hand the identity of the user in order to proceed.<br>
[0083] If the proxy address is unregistered to any given user 214, then register it to the current<br>
sender 222. This condition can occur due to two possible conditions. First, the proxy address was<br>
just created using NOTF, and is thus un-owned. Second, proxy addresses can be explicitly created<br>
prior to being used, in which case it is un-owned until the first use, and wherein it becomes<br>
registered to the first user 222 just as with NOTF proxies.<br>
[0084] The sender's exemption status is then checked 224 to provide information to the<br>
Reflexion Security Module and also the Address Translation Module. Exempt senders are not<br>
subject to access control and all mail to and from exempt contacts are conducted under the original<br>
internal address of the protected user.<br>
[0085] Referring to FIG. 3, security enforcement is described. Once inbound message<br>
preparation is completed, Reflexion will determine the security disposition for this message.<br>
[0086] There are two active security modes available to Reflexion users; Enforced Mode and<br>
Flag Mode.<br>
[0087] Figure 3 details the logic followed by the preferred embodiment security model for<br>
messages sent to a user that employs Enforced Mode.<br>
[0088] By definition, all inbound mail to domains protected by Reflexion are proxy<br>
identifiers, even if the recipient address is indistinguishable from the original, internal address.<br>
Each original, internal address has a proxy address with the same address in order to permit<br>
security to be placed on the original address itself.<br>
[0089] The security state of the recipient address is interrogated first.<br><br><br>
Message to a Public Proxy<br>
[0090] If the recipient proxy address has a security status of "public" 300, then check for the<br>
sender's exempt status 302. If the sender is exempt, security is bypassed and the message is passed<br>
on to subsequent message translation stages and delivered 338.<br>
[0091] If the proxy address that is registered to the sender is not the same as the proxy address<br>
used as the recipient address for this message (this is not stated clearly in the figure, but is the case),<br>
the product will examine the security set on the proxy of the sender before permitting delivery.<br>
[0092] If the proxy assigned to the sender is public 312 or protected 320, the message is<br>
allowed through security 338. The sender is sent a reminder message to use their own proxy<br>
address in the future 322 if the proxy that is registered to them is protected.<br>
[0093] If the sender's proxy is "no share" 328, the message is not allowed to be delivered.<br>
Instead, the sender is sent back a request that the sender resend the message using the proxy<br>
address registered to the sender (as opposed to proxy used as the recipient in this message).<br>
[0094] So even if a message is sent to public proxy address, the security state of the sender's<br>
proxy address can alter, or prohibit, the delivery of the message.<br>
Message to a Protected Proxy<br>
[0095] If the recipient proxy address has a security status of "protected" 304, then check to<br>
see if the sender is permitted to send mail to this proxy address.<br>
[0096] Currently, there are three ways that a sender can be authorized to use a protected proxy.<br>
First, if the sender is exempt 314 then security is bypassed and the message is passed on to<br>
subsequent message translation stages and delivered 338. Second, if the sender is the party that is<br>
registered to the proxy address 324, delivery is authorized and completed 338. Finally, if the<br>
sender is from the same domain as the contact that is registered to the proxy address and the<br>
domain is not one of the major ISPs such as AOL, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. (a configurable list), and<br>
the security property that permits domain-level sharing is enabled on the proxy 332, the message is<br><br><br>
authorized for delivery 338.<br>
[0097] Senders that are not authorized to use a protected proxy are sent a request that the<br>
message be resent to the proxy address that is permitted for use by the sender 316. This message<br>
essentially states that "proxy address x has been changed to the sender's proxy address y. Please<br>
resend your message to y".<br>
[0098] Protected addresses are used to protect against spam that has no valid return address,<br>
but to afford legitimate contacts a resend mechanism that will let messages be delivered.<br>
Message to a No Share Proxy<br>
[0099] If the recipient proxy address has a security status of "no share" 306, then check to see<br>
if the sender is permitted to send mail to this proxy address.<br>
[00100] Currently, there are three ways that a sender can be authorized to use a protected proxy.<br>
First, if the sender is exempt 314 then security is bypassed and the message is passed on to<br>
subsequent message translation stages and delivered 338. Second, if the sender is the party that is<br>
registered to the proxy address 324, delivery is authorized and completed 338. Finally, if the<br>
sender is from the same domain as the contact that is registered to the proxy address and the<br>
domain is not one of the major ISPs such as AOL, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. (a configurable list), and<br>
the security property that permits domain-level sharing is enabled on the proxy 332, the message is<br>
authorized for delivery 338.<br>
[00101] Senders that are not authorized to use a protected proxy are sent a denial of delivery<br>
message that gives no recourse for resending the message. 316. The difference between<br>
unauthorized use of a protected address versus unauthorized use of a no share address is that<br>
protected proxy denials provide a means for successfully resending the message while no share<br>
denials do not.<br>
[00102] With no share proxies, the requirement to successfully send an e-mail message is<br>
raised from simply knowing the recipient address to knowing both the recipient and the<br>
corresponding sender address that is registered to the proxy. No share proxies provide<br><br><br>
security-conscious organizations a very effective yet lightweight protection against what are<br>
known as "directory harvest attacks". Directory harvest attacks are a technique used to gather live<br>
e-mail addresses by sending messages to large numbers of different addresses at the targeted<br>
domain. Whatever addresses do not result in a "no such user" are assumed to be valid.<br>
[00103] With no share proxies, directly harvests will fail unless the sender knows to spoof the<br>
correct sender's address in each attempt.<br>
Message to a Disabled Proxy<br>
[00104] If the recipient proxy address has a security status of "disabled" 308, then check to see<br>
if the sender is exempt, for that is the only way that a message to a disabled proxy can be delivered<br>
if the user employs Enforce Mode security.<br>
[00105] Referring to FIG 4, flag security is described. In particular, the details the logic<br>
followed by the preferred embodiment security model for messages sent to a user that employs<br>
Flag Mode.<br>
[00106] Flag Mode guarantees that all inbound messages will be delivered to the user's inbox.<br>
[00107] The logic is almost the same as described for Figure 3, the only material difference is<br>
that, in Flag Mode, whenever a sender is determined to be unauthorized to send a message to the<br>
recipient proxy, instead of sending a denial or retry message as would occur in Enforce Mode, the<br>
product will only flag the subject line with a prefix to indicate that the sender is unauthorized to<br>
send this message to the chosen proxy address 422 / 426.<br>
[00108] It's important to note that the subject line flag is visible only inside the host enterprise;<br>
Reflexion removes the flag on replies to flagged messages on the way out of the enterprise.<br>
[00109] Flag Mode serves three important product requirements:<br>
1. Provides new users with a mode of operation for a smooth migration into using<br>
Reflexion, guaranteeing that no outside contact will ever be aggravated by Reflexion<br>
("transition"). Pre-existing spam problems are cleared up in the new user's transition<br>
period.<br><br><br>
2. Provides users with little or no tolerance for the blocking of legitimate but unexpected<br>
messages a guarantee that all mail will be delivered to the user's inbox. Flag Mode is<br>
ideal for those in the role of sales, business development or executive positions where<br>
a lot of business cards are handed out and the value and frequency of unexpected<br>
messages is high.<br>
[00110] Users that do not or cannot change their e-mail behavior will operate the product<br>
permanently in Flag Mode. These users (or their administrator) can also inhibit the use of proxy<br>
addresses altogether, allowing the user to continue to use their one and only address as normal, yet<br>
still receiving spam relief.<br>
Stopping a Pre-Existing Spam Problem<br>
[00111] A new user that begins using the product, who has a pre-existing spam problem, can<br>
end spam being sent to the existing address in the following manner:<br>
1.	Configure overall security enforcement to Flag Mode.<br>
2.	Exempt all known contacts using any of the various embodiments of exemption methods.<br>
Exempting contacts allows legitimate contacts that are already dependent on the original,<br>
internal address to continue to use it unabated.<br>
3.	Increase security on the proxy that has the same address as the original, internal address.<br>
This will cause any mail sent to that proxy to be flagged unless the contact is on the exempt<br>
list. This is a non-aggressive form of "white listing", a common technique that is very<br>
effective at blocking spam but which has shortcomings that limit wide scale adoption,<br>
particularly among businesses.<br>
[00112] Reflexion only employs this white list to stop a pre-existing spam problem. If a new<br>
user does not start with a spam problem, the white list is not required.<br>
[00113] Referring to FIG. 5, address translations are described. Once an inbound message has<br>
been successfully cleared for delivery, most references to proxy addresses are translated to the<br>
corresponding original, internal addresses. There are some security states in the preferred<br>
embodiment that inhibit the translation of proxy addresses, specifically Name-on-the-Fly proxies<br>
(see Fig. 13 for more information on NOTF).<br><br><br>
[00114] NOTF proxies were defined by the user and, as such, reside in the name space of the<br>
user. Many times, NOTF proxy addresses are used in a login sequence or other process keyed by<br>
the NOTF proxy address. By inhibiting the translation of the NOTF within the body of an e-mail<br>
message (as opposed to the header of the message, which must be translated to ensure delivery of<br>
the message within the existing e-mail infrastructure), confinnation messages that specify the use<br>
of the NOTF proxy will be accurate (i. e. translation would make the information inaccurate).<br>
[00115] When considering address translations, first understand that only proxy addresses at<br>
the domains protected by the individual Reflexion installation are candidates for translation.<br>
Addresses at non-protected domains are never translated.<br>
[00116] Reflexion keeps a catalog of "true" addresses within the database. Both external<br>
addresses and internal, original addresses of the protected domains are stored in the true address<br>
catalog 500. Proxy addresses are found by seeking the proxy address itself as a key (e. g.<br>
<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4a3a38253233647b78790a2925273a2b243364292527">[email&#160;protected]</a>) or by seeking a proxy that is assigned to an outside contact for use a<br>
substitute to an internal, original address 502.<br>
[00117] Given the true addresses of the sender and receiver, the corresponding proxy can be<br>
retrieved on outbound messages and substituted within the message for any and all references to<br>
the original, internal address.<br>
[00118] Given the proxy address, the corresponding internal, original address can be retrieved<br>
on inbound messages and substituted within the message for any and all references to the proxy<br>
address.<br>
[00119] Address translation becomes more complicated when the product also translates, for<br>
both inbound and outbound messages, proxy addresses of colleagues that may or may not exist, but<br>
which are created if necessary.<br>
[00120] Exemption status adds another level of complexity, as e-mail to and from exempt<br>
contacts result in address translations being inhibited.<br>
[00121] Additionally, some external contacts are dependent on a third-party proxy, so<br><br><br>
messages to those contacts should preserve the continuity of use of the proxy that is expected (i. e.<br>
the same proxy is presented to the same contact in all messages from the user to that contact).<br>
[00122] To understand Figure 5, being comfortable with the syntax is helpful.<br>
[00123]Read 504 as. "a translation method that takes some address 'a' and returns the correct<br>
translation for it".<br>
[00124]Read 506 as, "a method that returns the proxy address that the outside contact expects<br>
to see", which is not always the same as the proxy addressed assigned to the contact.<br>
[00125]Referring to FIG. 13, "Name - on - the - Fly" is described. In particular,<br>
Name-on-the-Fly (NOTF) is a naming technique that permits the creation of new and unique proxy<br>
e-mail addresses without the use of any enabling device or software application. With NOTF, a<br>
Reflexion user can create proxy addresses simply by adhering to a predetermined naming scheme.<br>
[00126] Typically, the naming scheme includes: when a message is sent to an address at a<br>
domain protected by Reflexion that is found to have not yet been created within the application,<br>
that some characteristic of the unknown address may resolve to one and only one Reflexion user.<br>
If the address does resolve to one and only one Reflexion user, and the user permits NOTF<br>
addresses to be created, then Reflexion will create the heretofore-unknown proxy address and put<br>
it under management of the application, assign it as a proxy address to the user, and deliver or deny<br>
the message as appropriate to the security disposition.<br>
[00127] For example, a message sent to the proxy <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4a2b2e2e382f3939203927233e2264222f2626250a2925273a2b243364292527">[email&#160;protected]</a> 700 is<br>
not found in the table of known proxy addresses by Reflexion 702. Before treating the message as<br>
addressed to a non-existent user 708, Reflexion (in mis example) isolates the local part "jsmith"<br>
706 and searches for a user that owns the proxy address ismith(3).companv.com 712. If found, see if<br>
the user 712 allows NOTF proxy addresses to be created (which can be accomplished in a variety<br>
of ways, the preferred method to follow in the example below) 714. If allowed, create a new proxy<br>
address <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="214b524c4855490f49444d4d4e61424e4c51404f580f424e4c">[email&#160;protected]</a> 720 and continue processing the message as if sent to an<br>
existing proxy 722, otherwise process the message as addressed to a non-existent user 716.<br>
26<br><br>
[0012 8] Reflexion's address translations - where references to a proxy address are translated to<br>
the user's original address - are suppressed in the Subject: SMTP header and the body of the<br>
message for NOTF address references. Reflexion suppresses NOTF addresses for two reasons.<br>
First, the NOTF address was most likely defined by the user and, therefore, is both known and<br>
expected in messages sent to the NOTF address. Second, disclosures of a NOTF address may be<br>
used for login and password sequences, so it is important to preserve the exact address in case these<br>
types of sequences are being reported to the user via e-mail (e. g. "forgot my password" type<br>
messages).<br>
[00129]Referring to FIG 14 and 15, adding and removing footers from messages is described.<br>
In particular, attached to the bottom of each incoming message is a footer that contains live<br>
controls ("the footer"), which serves as the primary user interface for interacting with and<br>
controlling the security model of Reflexion.<br>
[00130] On an inbound message 1400, information about the message is gathered as Reflexion<br>
processes the message 1402. This information includes transport envelope addresses, date and<br>
time, subject, size, attachments, and resolution of the security pass (allow, disallow, flag, etc.).<br>
[00131] All of this information is available and used, as appropriate, in the construction of the<br>
footer 1404. There are a variety of possible presentations available for implementation. In one<br>
embodiment, the footer may present or promote for the benefit of the user the most relevant<br>
operations. For example, if a message is being flagged, the most relevant operation would be for<br>
the user to stop having the message be flagged, so that operation would have prominence over<br>
other possibilities. In other embodiments, a wider range of options may be presented, perhaps to<br>
conform to a standard footer structure or to provide the greatest degree of choice and convenience<br>
to the user.<br>
[00132] Regardless of how the footer is structured, the operations supported by the live<br>
controls contained in the footer draws context from the message to which it is attached.<br>
[0013 3] Reflexion constructs the footer and attaches it to the message 1406 before delivery.<br>
The footer can be attached anywhere to the document, or it can be a link in the document to an<br><br><br>
external viewer such as a browser or other application.<br>
[00134] In one embodiment, Reflexion constructs both a text and HTML version of the footer,<br>
with the use of HTML footers being an option of the enterprise or user. Reflexion converts<br>
inbound messages from whatever original form they contain into an appropriate MIME<br>
(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt?number=2045)<br>
format so that either text or HTML versions of the footer can be viewed, depending on the options<br>
selected.<br>
[0013 5] On outbound messages 1500, Reflexion first identifies the location of any and all<br>
footers 1502 and removes them from the message 1504. Removal of the footer is not necessary,<br>
but it is how messages are handled in the preferred embodiment.<br>
[0013 6] Referring to FIG 16, security enforcement in regards to receiving messages is<br>
described. In particular, security is enforced at the soonest possible time. For e-mail<br>
communications, security enforcement takes place in the midst of the receipt of the message,<br>
typically using the SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol, see<br>
Request for Comments: 0821 available from The Internet Engineering Task Force) protocol.<br>
[00137]At the start of the SMTP delivery of a message 1600, the Transport Envelope is<br>
delivered ahead of the actual message itself. Reflexion gathers the sender and recipient e-mail<br>
addresses from the Transport Envelope 1602 and immediately resolves the security disposition for<br>
this address prior to the receipt of any part of the message itself (see Fig. 1 to see more on the<br>
system architecture). There are three possible security dispositions 1606; to allow the message to<br>
be delivered, to prevent the message from being delivered (see Fig. 3), or to treat the message as<br>
suspect.<br>
[00138] If the message is denied 1614, the sender maybe sent a notice that the message was<br>
undeliverable, a notice that the message should be resent to a new Reflexion address, or no notice<br>
at all depending on the circumstances.<br>
[00139]If the message is allowed 1610, Reflexion will accept the message for delivery and<br><br><br>
complete the SMTP dialog.<br>
[00140] If the security disposition of the message is "flagged", the message is suspected of<br>
being undesired. Suspected messages are not automatically flagged and delivered. Instead,<br>
Reflexion tests the behavior of the sender's mail server (i. e. Mail Transport Agent) by deferring<br>
suspect mail for some amount of time.<br>
[00141] The first time a new suspect message is received, Reflexion begins to track the number<br>
of delivery attempts and the overall time of delivery since the first attempt 1620. Each time a<br>
suspect message is attempted for delivery, Reflexion checks to see if the test threshold has been<br>
met or exceeded 1622. If the threshold has been satisfied, the message is accepted, flagged and<br>
delivered 1624, otherwise the sender is notified to try again later 1626.<br>
[00142] This deferral strategy tests that the mail server (Mail Transport Agent) of the sender of<br>
a suspect (i. e. "flagged") message is well behaved. Many spammers do not retry messages that<br>
have been deferred, thus increasing Reflexion's performance and saving the delivery of a flagged<br>
message.<br>
[00143] Referring to FIG. 17, security enforcement in regards to cold contact anti - virus<br>
protection. In general, "Cold Contact" is a simple yet effective early warning system for<br>
potentially new e-mail (or other electronic communication medium) borne viruses. The Reflexion<br>
paradigm for issuing multiple proxy addresses makes Cold Contact possible. Any proxy address<br>
that has been inactive for an amount of time 1704 that is set by the host enterprise will be<br>
considered a "cold contact", with one or more protective behaviors triggered after such an<br>
assessment, for example possible quarantining of the original message to be replaced by a "safe"<br>
substitute 1706.<br>
[00144] Cold Contact helps defend against a message sent from a legitimate contact's address<br>
to the correct Reflexion proxy address that contains a virus that is not detectable by a virus scanner.<br>
[00145] Referring to FIG. 18, a lockdown defense against viruses and volume - based attacks<br>
are described. In general, "Lockdown" is another simple yet effective defense against<br><br><br>
volume-based attacks on an enterprise and e-mail borne viruses that spread with spoofed sender<br>
addresses. Lockdown is an enterprise-wide, temporary increase in security with optional<br>
behaviors that can be triggered automatically by conditions recognized by Reflexion or explicitly<br>
by a system administrator.<br>
[00146]As inbound messages arrive for processing 1800, Reflexion retrieves the security<br>
status on the recipient proxy address as normal 1802. For addresses that have a security state of<br>
"public", check to see if Lockdown is in effect 1804. If Lockdown is enabled, temporarily increase<br>
the security on the proxy address from "public" to the security state option set in the Lockdown<br>
feature, either "protected" or "no share" 1806. Use the temporarily increased security state and<br>
deny or permit delivery of the message 1808.<br>
[00147] Some of the options for Lockdown are the temporary security state to enforce for<br>
"public" proxies, an option to suppress undeliverable or challenge response messages sent back to<br>
the sender, and the option to quarantine in the same manner described in Fig. 17 for Cold Contacts<br>
and message containing potentially viral attachments or script.<br>
[00148] A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be<br>
understood that various modifications may be made. Accordingly, other implementations are<br>
