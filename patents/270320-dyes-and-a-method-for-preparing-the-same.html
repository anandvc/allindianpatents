question is linked to further selected structural elements in a certain manner have<br>
excellent properties and provide dyeings having excellent wash fastnesses and very<br>

R2 is hydrogen, methyl, chlorine or methoxy;<br>
R3 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, butyl, benzyl, phenoxyethyl or allyl; and<br>
R5 is methyl or ethyl.<br>
The dyes of the general formula (I) according to the present invention are obtainable<br>
using methods known to one skilled in the art.<br>
For instance, a compound of the general formula (III)<br>
D-NH2 (III)<br>
where D is as defined above, is diazotized and coupled onto a compound of the<br>
general formula (IV)<br><br>
where R1 to R7 and n are each as defined above.<br>
The diazotizing of the compounds of the general formula (III) is generally effected in<br>
a known manner, for example using sodium nitrite in an aqueous medium rendered<br>
acidic, for example with hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, or using nitrosylsulfuric acid in<br>
dilute sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or in a mixture of acetic acid and propionic acid.<br>
The preferred temperature range is between 0°C and 15°C.<br>
The coupling of the diazotized compounds onto the compounds of the general<br><br>
formula (IV) is generally likewise effected in a known manner, for example in an<br>
acidic, aqueous, aqueous-organic or organic medium, particularly advantageously at<br>
temperatures below 10°C. Acids used are in particular sulfuric acid, acetic acid or<br>
propionic acid.<br>
The compounds of the general formulae (III) and (IV) are known and can be prepared<br>
by known methods.<br>
The present invention's dyes of the general formula (I) are very useful for dyeing and<br>
printing hydrophobic materials, the dyeings and prints obtained being notable for<br>
level hues and high service fastnesses. Deserving of particular mention are excellent<br>
wash fastnesses and very good sublimation fastnesses.<br>
The present invention thus also provides for the use of the dyes of the general<br>
formula I for dyeing and printing hydrophobic materials, i.e., processes for dyeing or<br>
printing such materials in a conventional manner wherein one or more dyes of the<br>
general formula (I) according to the present invention are used as a colorant.<br>
The hydrophobic materials mentioned may be of synthetic or semisynthetic origin.<br>
Useful hydrophobic materials include for example secondary cellulose acetate,<br>
cellulose triacetate, polyamides and, in particular, high molecular weight<br>
polyesters. Materials of high molecular weight polyester are in particular those<br>
based on polyethylene glycol terephthalates.<br>
The hydrophobic synthetic materials can be present in the form of sheet- or<br>
threadlike constructions and can have been processed, for example, into yarns or<br>
into woven or knit textile materials. Preference is given to fibrous textile materials,<br>
which may also be present in the form of microfibers for example.<br>
The dyeing in accordance with the use provided by the present invention can be<br>
carried out in a conventional manner, preferably from an aqueous dispersion, if<br>
appropriate in the presence of carriers, at between 80 to about 110°C by the<br>
exhaust process or by the HT process in a dyeing autoclave at 110 to 140°C, and<br>
also by the so-called thermofix process, in which the fabric is padded with the<br>
dyeing liquor and subsequently fixed/set at about 180 to 230°C.<br><br>
Printing of the materials mentioned can be carried out in a manner known per se by<br>
incorporating the dye of the general formula (I) of the present invention in a print<br>
paste and treating the fabric printed therewith at temperatures between 180 to 230°C<br>
with HT steam, high-pressure steam or dry heat, if appropriate in the presence of a<br>
carrier, to fix the dye.<br>
The dyes of the general formula (I) of the present invention shall be in a very fine<br>
state of subdivision when they are used in dyeing liquors, padding liquors or print<br>
pastes.<br>
The dyes are converted into the fine state of subdivision in a conventional manner<br>
by slurrying the as-fabricated dye together with dispersants in a liquid medium,<br>
preferably in water, and subjecting the mixture to the action of shearing forces to<br>
mechanically comminute the original dye particles to such an extent that an<br>
optimal specific surface area is achieved and sedimentation of the dye is<br>
minimized. This is accomplished in suitable mills, such as ball or sand mills. The<br>
particle size of the dyes is generally between 0.5 and 5 urn and preferably equal<br>
to about 1 urn.<br>
The dispersants used in the milling operation can be nonionic or anionic. Nonionic<br>
dispersants include for example reaction products of alkylene oxides, for example<br>
ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, with alkylatable compounds, for example fatty<br>
alcohols, fatty amines, fatty acids, phenols, alkylphenols and carboxamides. Anionic<br>
dispersants are for example lignosulfonates, alkyl- or alkylarylsulfonates or alkylaryl<br>
polyglycol ether sulfates.<br>
The dye preparations thus obtained should be pourable for most applications.<br>
Accordingly, the dye and dispersant content is limited in these cases. In general,<br>
the dispersions are adjusted to a dye content up to 50 percent by weight and a<br>
dispersant content up to about 25 percent by weight. For economic reasons, dye<br>
contents are in most cases not allowed to be below 15 percent by weight.<br>
The dispersions may also contain still further auxiliaries, for example those which<br>
act as an oxidizing agent, for example sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate, or<br>
fungicidal agents, for example sodium o-phenylphenoxide and sodium<br>
pentachlorophenoxide, and particularly so-called "acid donors", examples being<br><br>
butyrolactone, monochloroacetamide, sodium chloroacetate, sodium<br>
dichloroacetate, the sodium salt of 3-chloropropionic acid, monosulfate esters<br>
such as lauryl sulfate for example, and also sulfuric esters of ethoxylated and<br>
propoxylated alcohols, for example butylglycol sulfate.<br>
The dye dispersions thus obtained are very advantageous for making up dyeing<br>
liquors and print pastes.<br>
There are certain fields of use where powder formulations are preferred. These<br>
powders comprise the dye, dispersants and other auxiliaries, for example wetting,<br>
oxidizing, preserving and dustproofing agents and the abovementioned "acid<br>
donors".<br>
A preferred method of making pulverulent preparations of dye consists in stripping<br>
the above-described liquid dye dispersions of their liquid, for example by vacuum<br>
drying, freeze drying, by drying on drum dryers, but preferably by spray drying.<br>
The dyeing liquors are made by diluting the requisite amounts of the above-<br>
described dye formulations with the dyeing medium, preferably water, such that a<br>
liquor ratio of 5:1 to 50:1 is obtained for dyeing. In addition, it is generally<br>
customary to include further dyeing auxiliaries, such as dispersing, wetting and<br>
fixing auxiliaries, in the liquors. Organic and inorganic acids such as acetic acid,<br>
succinic acid, boric acid or phosphoric acid are included to set a pH in the range<br>
from 4 to 5, preferably 4.5. It is advantageous to buffer the pH setting and to add a<br>
sufficient amount of a buffering system. The acetic acid/sodium acetate system is<br>
an example of an advantageous buffering system.<br>
To use the dye or dye mixture in textile printing, the requisite amounts of the<br>
abovementioned dye formulations are kneaded in a conventional manner together<br>
with thickeners, for example alkali metal alginates or the like, and if appropriate<br>
further additives, for example fixation accelerants, wetting agents and oxidizing<br>
agents, to give print pastes.<br>
The present invention also provides inks for digital textile printing by the ink jet<br>
process, comprising a present invention dye of the general formula (I).<br><br>
The inks of the present invention are preferably aqueous and comprise one or more<br>
of the present invention's dyes of the general formula (I), for example in amounts of<br>
0.1% to 50% by weight, preferably in amounts of 1% to 30% by weight and more<br>
preferably in amounts of 1% to 15% by weight based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
They further comprise in particular from 0.1% to 20% by weight of a dispersant.<br>
Suitable dispersants are known to one skilled in the art, are commercially available<br>
and include for example sulfonated or sulfomethylated lignins, condensation products<br>
of aromatic sulfonic acids and formaldehyde, condensation products of substituted or<br>
unsubstituted phenol and formaldehyde, polyacrylates and corresponding<br>
copolymers, modified polyurethanes and reaction products of alkylene oxides with<br>
alkylatable compounds, for example fatty alcohols, fatty amines, fatty acids,<br>
carboxamides and substituted or unsubstituted phenols.<br>
The inks of the present invention may further comprise customary additives, for<br>
example viscosity moderators to set viscosities in the range from 1.5 to 40.0 mPas in<br>
the temperature range of 20 to 50°C. Preferred inks have a viscosity in the range<br>
from 1.5 to 20 mPas and particularly preferred inks have a viscosity in the range from<br>
1.5 to 15mPas.<br>
Useful viscosity moderators include rheological additives, for example polyvinyl-<br>
caprolactam, polyvinylpyrrolidone and also their copolymers, polyetherpolyol,<br>
associative thickeners, polyureas, sodium alginates, modified galactomannans,<br>
polyetherurea, polyurethane and nonionic cellulose ethers.<br>
By way of further additives, the inks of the present invention may include surface-<br>
active substances to set surface tensions in the range from 20 to 65 mN/m, which are<br>
if appropriate adapted depending on the process used (thermal or piezo technology).<br>
Useful surface-active substances include for example surfactants of any kind,<br>
preferably nonionic surfactants, butyldiglycol and 1,2 hexanediol.<br>
The inks may further include customary additives, for example chemical species to<br>
inhibit fungal and bacterial growth in amounts from 0.01% to 1% by weight based on<br>
the total weight of the ink.<br>
The inks of the present invention can be prepared in conventional manner by mixing<br>
the components in water.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
4.6 g of 6-chloro-2,4-dinitroaniline are introduced into a mixture of 9.8 ml of sulfuric<br>
acid (96%), 0.5 ml of water and 3.5 ml of nitrosylsulfuric acid (40%) at 30 to 35°C.<br>
After 3 hours of stirring at 30 - 35°C, excess nitrite is destroyed with amidosulfonic<br>
acid. The diazonium salt solution thus obtained is expediently added dropwise to a<br>
mixture of 7.0 g of 2-oxopropyl 3-[(5-acetylamino-2-methoxyphenyl)ethylamino]-<br>
propionate, 50 ml of methanol and 200 g of ice. After stirring for one hour the solids<br>
are filtered off with suction, washed with water and dried to leave 7.3 g of the dye of<br>
the formula (lab) <br>
(λmax [DMF] = 606 nm), which dyes polyester in blue hues having good wash and<br>
sublimation fastnesses.<br>
Example 2<br>
7.5 g of 2-oxopropyl 3-{[3-acetylamino-4-(2,6-dibromo-4-nitrophenylazo)phenyl]-<br>
ethylamino}propionate and 2.15 g of copper(l) cyanide are stirred in 30 ml of<br>
N-methylpyrrolidone at 80°C for 4 hours. After cooling, 200 ml of methanol and 30 ml<br>
of water are added dropwise. The precipitate is filtered off with suction, washed with<br>
5% hydrochloric acid and water and dried under reduced pressure to leave 4.9 g of<br>
the dye of the formula (lac)<br><br>
(λmax [DMF] = 612 nm), which dyes polyester in brilliant, blue shades and has<br>
excellent wash and sublimation fastnesses.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Example 2 is repeated except it proceeds from 2-oxopropyl 3-{[3-acetylamino-4-(6-<br>
bromo-2,4-dinitrophenylazo)phenyl]ethylamino}propionate and utilizes only one<br>
equivalent of copper(l) cyanide. The dye thus obtained has the formula (lad)<br><br>
(λmax [DMF] = 602 nm) and dyes polyester in brilliant, blue shades and gives<br>
excellent wash and sublimation fastnesses.<br>
Examples 4 to 145 of Table 1 were prepared in a similar manner.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 146<br>
4.3 g of 3-amino-5-nitrobenzisothiazole are introduced into a mixture of 11 ml of<br>
sulfuric acid (96%) and 4 ml of phosphoric acid (85%). Then, 4.6 ml of nitrosylsulfuric<br>
acid (40%) are added dropwise at 10 to 15°C. The mixture is subsequently stirred at<br>
10 to 15°C for 4 hours. The diazonium salt solution thus obtained is speedily added<br>
dropwise to a mixture of 6.6 g of 2-oxopropyl 3-[(5-acetylaminophenyl)ethylamino]-<br>
propionate, 100 ml of methanol, 1.1 g of urea and 100 g of ice. The mixture is stirred<br>
at room temperature overnight and the precipitate is filtered off with suction, washed<br>
with 1:1 methanol/water and dried to leave 7.9 g of the dye of the formula (Ibb)<br><br>
(λmax [DMF] = 622 nm), which dyes polyester in greenish blue shades and has very<br>
good wash and sublimation fastnesses.<br>
Examples 147 to 173 of Table 2 were prepared in a similar manner.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 174<br>
A textile fabric consisting of polyester is padded with a liquor consisting of 50 g/l of<br>
8% sodium alginate solution, 100 g/l of 8-12% carob flour ether solution and 5 g/l of<br>
monosodium phosphate in water and then dried. The wet pickup is 70%.<br><br>
The textile thus pretreated is then printed with an aqueous ink prepared in<br>
accordance with the procedure described above and containing<br>
3.5% of the dye of Example 1,<br>
2.5% of Disperbyk 190 dispersant,<br>
30% of 1,5-pentanediol,<br>
5% of diethylene glycol monomethyl ether,<br>
0.01% of Mergal K9N biocide, and<br>
58.99% of water<br>
using a drop-on-demand (piezo) ink jet print head. The print is fully dried. Fixing is<br>
effected by means of superheated steam at 175°C for 7 minutes. The print is<br>
subsequently subjected to an alkaline reduction clear, rinsed warm and then dried.<br><br>
