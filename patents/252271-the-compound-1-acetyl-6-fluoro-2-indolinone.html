In the reactions described above, any reactive groups present, such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino, alkylamino or imino groups, can be protected during the reaction by customary protective groups which are removed again after the reaction,<br>
A protective radical for a carboxyl group is, for example, the trimethylsilyl, methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl, benzyl or tetrahydropyranyl group, and<br>
a protective group for a hydroxyl, amino, alkylamino or imino group is, for example, the acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzoyl, ethoxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl or 2,4-d!rriethoxy6enzyI group, and, for the amino group&gt; additionally the phthalyl group.<br>
The subsequent removal of a protective radical used is, if appropriate, carried out, for example, hydrolytically in an aqueous solvent, for example in water, isopropanol/water, tetrahydrofuran/water or dioxane/water, in the presence of an acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid, or in tha presence of an alkali metal base, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, at temperatures between 0 and 100°C, preferably at temperatures between 10 and 50°C.<br>

A phthalyl radical is preferably removed in the presence of hydrazine or a primary arriine, such as methylamine, ethylamine or n-butylamine, in arsolvent," such"as" methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, toluene/water or dioxane, at temperatures between 20 and 50°C.<br>
Furthermore, chiral compounds of the formula I obtained can be separated into their enantiomers and/or diastereomers.<br>
Thus, for example, compounds of the formula I obtained which occur as racemates can be separated by methods known per se (see Allinger N. L. and Elie! E. L. in "Topics in Stereochemistry", Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971) into their enantiomers, and compounds of the formula I having at least 2 asymmetric carbon atoms can, owing to their physicochemical differences, be separated by methods known per se, for example by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization, into their diastereomers, which, if they are obtained in racemicform, can then be separated into the enantiomers as mentioned above.<br>
The separation of enantiomers is preferably carried out by column separation on chiral phases or by recrystallization from an optically active solvent or by reaction with an optically active substance which forms salts or derivatives, such as, for example, esters or amides, with the racemic compound, in particular acids and their activated derivatives or alcohols, and separating the mixture of diastereomeric salts or derivatives obtained in this manner, for example owing to different solubilities, whereupon the free enantiomers can be released from the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives by action of suitable agents. Particularly common optically active acids are, for example, the D and L forms of tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, di-o-tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphorsulphonic acid, glutamic acid, N-acety!glutamic acid, aspartic acid, N-acetylaspartic acid or quinic acid. A suitable optically active alcohol is, for example, (+)- or (-)-menthol, and a suitable optically active acyl radical in amides is, for example, the (+)- or (-)-menthyloxycarbonyl radical.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the formula I obtained can be converted into their salts, in particular, for pharmaceutical use, into their physiologically acceptable salts, with inorganic or organic acids. Acids suitable for this purpose are, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, methanesulphonic acid,<br>
ethanesulphonic acid, para-toluenesulphonio acid, phenylsulphonlc acid or L-(+)-mandelic acid.<br>
Moreover, the resulting novel compounds of the formula ! can, if they contain a carboxyl group, then, if desired, be converted into their salts with inorganic or organic bases, in particular, for pharmaceutical use, into their physiologically acceptable salts. Bases suitable for this purpose are, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cyclohexylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine.<br>
Also suitable, for compounds of the formula I which contain 2 or more acidic or basic groups, are salts with 2 or more inorganic or organic bases or acids (disalts etc.).<br>
Some of the compounds of the general formulae V to XI used as starting materials are known from the literature or can be obtained by processes known from the literature or can be obtained by the processes described above and in the examples. Compounds of the general formula IX, for example, are described in the German patent application 19844 003.<br>
As already mentioned at the outset, the novel compounds of the formula (I) have useful pharmacological properties, in particular in inhibiting action on various kinases, especially on receptor tyrosine kinases, such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, PDGFRot, PDGFRp, FGFR1, FGFR3, EGFR, HER2, c-Kit, IGFIRand HGFR, Flt-3, and on the proliferation of cultivated human cells, in particular that of endothelial cells, for example in angiogenesis, but also on the proliferation of other cells, in particular of tumour cells.<br>
The biological properties of the novel compounds were examined by the following standard methods:<br>
Human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultivated in IMDM (Gibco BRL), supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma), 50 pM B-mercaptoethanol (Fluka), standard antibiotics, 15 ug/ml of endothefial cell growth<br>
factor (EGGS, Collaborative Biornedical Products) and 100 ug/ml of heparin (Sigma) on gelatin-coated culture bottles (0.2 % gelatin, Sigma) at 37°C, 5% CO2, in an atmosphere saturated with water.<br>
To examine the inhibitory activity of the compounds according to the invention, the cells were "starved" for 16 hours, i.e. kept in culture medium without growth factors (EGGS + heparin). Using trypsin/EDTA, the cells were detached from the culture bottles and washed once with serum-containing medium. 2.5 x 103 cells were then seeded in each well.<br>
The proliferation of the cells was stimulated using 5 ng/ml of VEGF-|65 (vascular endothelial growth factor; H. Weich, GBF Brunswick) and 10 ug/ml of heparin. Per plate, as control value, in each case 6 wells were not stimulated.<br>
The compounds according to the invention were dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulphoxide and, in triplicate, added to the cultures in different dilutions, the maximum dimethyl sulphoxide concentration being 0.3%.<br>
The cells were incubated at 37°C for 76 hours, and 3H-thymidine (0.1 u Ci/well, Amersham) was then added for a further 16 hours to determine DMA synthesis. The radioactively labelled celte were then immobilized on filter mats and the incorporated radioactivity was determined in a p counter. To determine the inhibitory activity of the compounds according to the invention, the mean value for the non-stimulated cells was subtracted from the mean value of the factor-stimulated cells (in the presence or absence of the compounds according to the invention).<br>
The relative cell proliferation was calculated in percent of the control (HUVEC without inhibitor), and the concentration of active compound at which the proliferation of the cells is inhibited by 50% (lC5Owas derived therefrom.<br>
The compounds of the formula I according to the invention have an IC50 between 50µM and 1 nM.<br>
Owing to their inhibitory action on the proliferation of cells, in particular of endothelian cells and of tumour cells, the compounds of the formula I are suitable for treating diseases in which the proliferation of ceils, in particular that of endothelial ceils, plays a role.<br>
Thus, for example, the proliferation of endothelial cells and the related neovascularization is a decisive step in tumour progression (Folkman J. et al., Nature 339. 58-61, (1989); Hanahan D. and Folkman J., Cell 86, 353-365, (1996)). Furthermore, the proliferation of endothelial cells is also of importance in haemangiomes, in metastasization, in rheumatoid arthritis, in psoriasis and in ocular neovascularization (Folkman J., Nature Med. 1, 27-31, (1995); Carmeliet P &amp; Rakeh J., Nature 407, 249-257, (2000)). The therapeutic benefit of inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation in the animal model was shown, for example, by O'Reilly et al. and Parangiet al. (O'Reilly M.S. et al., Cell 88, 277-285, (1997); Parangi S. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 93, 2002-2007, (1996)).<br>
Thus, the compounds of the formula I, their tautomers, their stereoisomers or their physiologically acceptable salts are suitable, for example, for treating tumours (for example squamous epithelium carcinoma, astrocytoma, Kaposi sarcoma, glioblastoma, lung cancer, cancer of the bladder, neck carcinoma, oesophagus carcinoma, melanoma, ovarial carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, breast cancer, small-ceil lung carcinoma, glioma, colorectal carcinoma, pancreas carcinoma, urogenital cancer and gastrointestinal carcinoma, and also haematological cancers, such as, for example, multiple myeloma and acute myelotic leukaemia), psoriasis, arthritis (for example rheumatoid arthritis), haemangioma, angiofibroma, disorders of the eye (for example diabetic retinopathy), neovascular glaucoma, disorders of the kidneys (for example glomerulonephritis), diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndromes, transplantation rejections and glomerulopathy, fibrotic disorders (for example cirrhosis of the liver), mesarigfal-celt proliferate disorders, atherosclerosis, injuries of the nerve tissue and for inhibiting the reocclusion of vessels after balloon catheter treatment, in vessel prosthetics or<br>
after implantation of mechanical devices for keeping vessels open (for example stents) or other disorders in which cell proliferation or angiogenesis play a rote.<br>
Owing to their biological properties, the compounds according to the invention can b« used alone or in combination with other pharmacologically active compounds, for example in tumour therapy in monotherapy or in combination with other antitumor therapeutics, for example in combination with topoisomerase inhibitors (for example etoposide), mitosis inhibitors (for example vinblastine, Taxol), compounds which interact with nucleic acids (for example cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin), hormone antagonists (for example tamoxifen), steroids and analogues thereof (for example dexamethasone), inhibitors of metabolic processes (for example 5-FU etc.), cytokines (for example interferons), kinase inhibitors (for example EGFR kinase inhibitoren, such as, for example, Iressa; Gleevec), allosterically acting receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antibodies (for example Herceptin), COX-2 inhibitors or else in combination with radiotherapy, etc. These combinations can be administered either simultaneously or sequentially.<br>

Preparation of the starting materials: Example I:<br>
Dimethyl 2-(4-fluoro-2-nitrophenvl)malonate<br>
With ice-cooling, 185 g of potassium ferf-butoxide are added to a solution of 188 ml of dimethyl malonate in 970 ml of N-methylpyrrolidone, and the mixture is stirred for 2 hours. Over a period of 30 minutes, 150 ml of 2,5-difluoronitrobenzene are added dropwise to the resulting slurry, and the mixture is then, stirred at 85°C for 6 hours. The mixture is poured into 4 liters of ice-water and 250 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and extracted with 2 liters of ethyl acatate. The organic phase is dried with sodium sulphate and concentrated. The oily residue is triturated twice with water and then taken up in 600 ml of ethyl acetate. The solution is dried with sodium sulphate and concentrated to dryness. The resulting crude product is recrystallized from 600 ml of ethyl acetate/hexane = 2:8 and dried.
