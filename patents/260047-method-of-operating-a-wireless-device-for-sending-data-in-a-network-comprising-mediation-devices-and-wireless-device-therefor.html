hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to networking. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to wireless networking.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Advances in electronics manufacturing technology have enabled the<br>
manufacture of inexpensive wireless devices in large quantities. Presently, there is an<br>
interest in greatly expanding the use of wireless networks beyond traditional<br>
communication uses.<br>
It is expected that in the future wireless networks will be used for a variety of<br>
sensing, control, security, and location based services. The design of devices and<br>
protocols for operation of networks for such applications present numerous<br>
challenges. It is expected that in many such networks it will be necessary or desirable<br>
to have devices that can operate for extended periods of time on battery power. In the<br><br>
interest of reducing the cost of devices for such networks so that they can be widely<br>
deployed, it is believed that high accuracy, high cost crystal oscillators traditionally<br>
used in wireless communication devices may have to be dispensed with in favor of<br>
lower cost albeit lower accuracy components. Limiting the operating power reduces<br>
the amount of signaling and signal processing that can be used in maintaining and<br>
using a network. Using lower accuracy oscillators limits the ability of devices in a<br>
wireless network to stay in synchronization. Operating with low power tends to<br>
dictate infrequent signaling and reception, whereas use of low accuracy oscillators<br>
(which perforce leads to inter-device timing errors) makes it difficult to achieve<br>
coincidence of one device's infrequent signaling with another device's infrequent<br>
reception.<br>
To address the foregoing difficulties co-pending patent application S/N<br>
09/803,322, entitled "A Multiple Access Protocol and Structure for Communication<br>
Devices in an Asynchronous Network" which is assigned in common with the instant<br>
application proposes a protocol according to which a number of devices in a network<br>
are able to operate with very low duty cycles. In low duty cycle operation, devices<br>
actively receive and transmit for relatively short periods compared to longer periods<br>
in which the devices are in a low powered sleep mode. Operating according to a low<br>
duty cycle leads to reduced power consumption, which as stated above is desirable or<br>
required for certain applications. Although such devices may have low accuracy<br>
oscillators, they are able to communicate through a number of devices that act as<br>
mediation devices. The mediation devices operate at a higher duty cycle than the<br>
other devices, and have relatively long receive periods during which they are able to<br>
receive communication from the low duty cycle devices. A low duty cycle device<br><br>
wanting to send a message (e.g., to another low duty cycle device) sends a<br>
'communication request' message to a mediation device. Low duty cycle devices also<br>
periodically send 'query' messages to the mediation device to ascertain if they are the<br>
intended recipients of communications from other low duty cycle devices. The<br>
mediation devices receive and store the communication request messages, and upon<br>
receiving a query message from an intended recipient indicated in a communication<br>
request message, send a 'response' message to the querying device. The response<br>
message includes timing information for the device that initiated communication to<br>
the querying device by sending the communication request. The timing information<br>
allows the querying device to adjust its own timing to synchronize with the device<br>
that initiated communication, and thereafter directly (without going through the<br>
mediation device) communicate with the device that initiated communication.<br>
Unfortunately, devices operating as mediation devices tend to consume more<br>
power. However, co-pending patent application S/N 09/803,322 also discloses<br>
protocols in which devices in a network share the task of operating as mediation<br>
devices. In the latter case, the extra power consumption burden associated with<br>
operating as a mediation device will be shared among devices in a network.<br>
Co-pending patent application S/N 10/443,428 entitled "Media Access Control<br>
and Distributed Data Processing Using Mediation Devices in an Asynchronous<br>
Network" discloses protocols in which the aforementioned mediation devices take on<br>
additional functions including storing and forwarding data.<br>
The protocols described in the abovementioned co-pending applications are<br>
suitable for so-called "ad-hoc" networks. In forming ad-hoc networks, a number of<br>
devices are placed in a building or outdoors so that subsets of the devices are within<br><br>
radio communication range of each other. The devices then interoperate to form a<br>
connected network. The placement of the devices may be dictated by application<br>
dependent needs, (e.g., a device may need to be placed at each smoke detector in a<br>
fire alarm application) and is not necessarily ideal from a network design point of<br>
view. The topology of such ad-hoc networks, which is in part dictated by the network<br>
formation protocol that is used and in part by the locations of the devices (dictated by<br>
application, and beyond the control of the protocol designer) can, in the case of<br>
protocols using mediation devices, lead to some of the mediation devices handling a<br>
greater communication load burden. Devices handling a greater communication load<br>
burden may, in the case of battery powered operation, exhaust their batteries first, and<br>
impair or disable the network, even if the batteries of most devices still have a<br>
substantial amount of energy remaining. Furthermore forcing a particular mediation<br>
device to bear a greater communication load could, for certain protocols and for heavy<br>
network traffic conditions, lead to increased message latency.<br>
What is needed is a protocol for ad-hoc networks using mediation devices that<br>
facilitates sharing the burden of communication tasks that expend power and/or<br>
communication bandwidth.<br>

invention.<br>
The terms a or an, as used herein, are defined as one or more than one. The<br>
term plurality, as used herein, is defined as two or more than two. The term another,<br>
as used herein, is defined as at least a second or more. The terms including and/or<br>
having, as used herein, are defined as comprising (i.e., open language). The term<br>
coupled, as used herein, is defined as connected, although not necessarily directly, and<br>
not necessarily mechanically.<br>
FIG. 1 is an electrical schematic, in block diagram form, of an embodiment of<br>
a wireless device 100. The wireless device 100 includes a controller 102. A<br>
workspace memory 104, a program memory 106 and an Input/Output (I/O) interface<br>
108 are coupled to the controller 102. The workspace memory 104 and the program<br>
memory 106 can be embodied in a single physical memory.<br>
The program memory 106 stores a control program for the wireless device<br>
100. The program memory 106 is a form of computer readable media. The control<br>
program configures the wireless device 100 to operate as described below with<br><br>
reference to FIGs. 3-10. Program instructions of the control program are received by<br>
the controller 102, from the program memory 106. Digital signals and data pass<br>
between the transceiver 110, and the controller 102 in the course of operation of the<br>
wireless device 100.<br>
The I/O interface 108 is coupled to transceiver 110, and to one or more<br>
peripheral devices 112. As indicated in FIG. 1, the one or more peripheral devices<br>
112 comprise one or more sensors 114, and one or more actuators 116. For certain<br>
applications the sensors 114, and/or the actuators 116 can be eliminated. For example<br>
for portable equipment location tracking applications neither the sensors 114, or<br>
actuators 116 are needed. For sensor network applications, only the sensors 114 are<br>
needed. The transceiver 110 comprises a transmitter 118, and a receiver 120.<br>
A clock module 118 is coupled to the controller 102, the program memory<br>
106, the work space memory 104, the I/O interface 108, and the transceiver 110. The<br>
clock module provides timing signals for operating the various components. The<br>
clock module is suitably based on a Micro Electromechanical System (MEMS)<br>
resonator device that is built into a semiconductor die that also includes one or more<br>
electrical circuits of the wireless device 100. MEMS resonators have the potential to<br>
be less expensive than traditional quartz oscillators; however, they may be less<br>
accurate and cause the difficulties discussed above.<br>
A battery 120 is coupled to the controller 102, the workspace memory 104, the<br>
program memory 106, the I/O interface 108, the transceiver 110, and the peripheral<br>
devices 112.<br><br>
In the interest of economy, multiple parts of the wireless device are suitably<br>
integrated in a single die. The wireless device 100 is suitable for use in ad-hoc<br>
networking.<br>
FIG. 2 is a graph of a network 200 that includes wireless devices of the type<br>
shown in FIG. 1 functioning in two modes. The network 200 comprises a plurality of<br>
wireless devices including a first through a fifth device operating in mediation device<br>
mode 202-210 (hereinafter referred to as mediation devices), and a first through an<br>
eighth device 212-226 operating in regular (non-mediation) device mode (hereinafter<br>
referred to as regular devices). Co-pending patent application S/N 09/803,322<br>
discloses methods whereby devices share the task of operating in mediation device<br>
mode. Programs stored in the program memory allow the wireless devices 202-226 to<br>
operate in both modes. As shown in FIG. 2 the mediation devices 202-210 are<br>
interspersed among the regular devices 212-226, such that regular devices 212-226<br>
are generally in communication range of mediation devices 202-210 and are able to<br>
communicate with the support of mediation devices 202-210.<br>
FIG. 3 is a timing diagram illustrating functioning of the mediation devices<br>
202-210 in the network 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 in order to coordinate<br>
communications among initially unsynchronized devices. Although the operation<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3 is taught in co-pending patent application S/N 09/803,322,<br>
entitled "A Multiple Access Protocol and Structure for Communication Devices in an<br>
Asynchronous Network", a description is given here by way of introduction to<br>
additional methods taught below.<br>
Timelines showing communications by the first mediation device 202 and the<br>
first 212 the second 214 regular devices are shown in FIG. 3. In the timelines shown<br><br>
in FIGs. 3-4, periods of transmission appear above each time axis, and periods of<br>
reception appear below each time axis. Note that the first mediation device 202 is in<br>
range of both the first 212 and second 214 regular devices, and the first 212 and<br>
second 214 regular devices are in range of each other. However, the first 212 and<br>
second 214 regular devices operate at a low duty cycle, and due to clock drift are<br>
generally not synchronized with each other (i.e. a receive slot of one does not overlap<br>
a transmit slot of the other). In order to initiate communication with the second<br>
regular device 214, the first regular device 212 transmits a communication request<br>
302 to the first mediation device 202. The communication request 302 is sent during<br>
a relatively short transmit slot 304 for the first regular device 212 and received during<br>
a longer receive frame 306 of the first mediation device. The communication request<br>
302 identifies the second regular device 214 (e.g., by address) as the destination for<br>
messages to be sent. Note that prior to receiving the communication request 302 from<br>
the first regular device 212, the mediation device 202 received a query message 308<br>
from the second regular device 214. Query messages are suitably issued periodically<br>
e.g., once every frame interval. The query message 308 is sent by the second regular<br>
device 214 to ascertain if any other device seeks to communicate with the second<br>
regular device. In receiving the communication request 302, and the query message<br>
308, the first mediation device 202 learns the timing of communications by first 212<br>
and second 214 regular devices. In as much as the first 212 and second 214 regular<br>
devices receive and transmit periodically during, at least, certain periods, the<br>
mediation device 202 is able to calculate when the regular devices 212,214 will again<br>
be in receive mode. During a subsequent receive slot 310 of the first regular device<br>
212 that overlaps a transmit frame 312 of the first mediation device 202, the first<br><br>
mediation device 202 sends an acknowledgment message (ACK) 314 to the first<br>
mediation device 202 acknowledging receipt of the communication request 302.<br>
During a receive slot 316 of the second regular device 214 (at a time subsequent to<br>
transmitting the query 308) and also overlapping the transmit frame 312 of the<br>
mediation device 202, the first mediation device 202 sends a response 318 to the<br>
second regular device 214. The response 318 includes information indicative of a<br>
timing adjustment to be made to a schedule of the second regular device 214 to allow<br>
the second regular device 214 to synchronize with the first regular device 212.<br>
Thereafter, the second regular device 214 adjusts its schedule for subsequent time<br>
slots 320, and the first 212 and second 214 regular devices are able to communicate<br>
with each other directly. As illustrated with reference to FIG. 3 the mediation devices<br>
202-210 are able to facilitate direct communication between regular devices 212-226<br>
by coordinating the synchronization of regular devices 212-226.<br>
FIG. 4 is a timing diagram illustrating functioning of mediation devices 202-<br>
210 in the network 200 shown in FIG. 2 in order to store and forward messages. In<br>
the particular scenario depicted in FIG. 4, both the first 212 and second 214 regular<br>
devices transmit data through the third mediation device 206 to the third regular<br>
device 216. At other times during the operation of the network 200, only one regular<br>
device, or more than two regular devices may transmit data through a mediation<br>
device. Although in the scenario illustrated in FIG. 4 both the first 212 and 214<br>
regular devices transmit message via the third mediation device 206 to a single<br>
regular device, i.e. the third regular device 216, at other times during the operation of<br>
the network 200, messages may be passed through a mediation device to multiple<br>
regular devices.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the first regular device 212 initiates communication by<br>
sending a first communication request 402, during a first transmit slot 404 of the first<br>
regular device 212. Similarly, the second regular device 214 initiates communication<br>
by sending a second communication request 406 during a first transmission slot 408<br>
of the second regular device 214. Each of the communication requests 402, 406<br>
includes an indication of the length of a multipart message that is to be transmitted.<br>
For example, a binary field in a header of the communication requests 402, 406<br>
suitably includes a total number of message parts for multipart messages initiated with<br>
the communication requests 402, 406. Each of the communication requests also<br>
identifies a destination to which messages are to be sent. In the scenario illustrated in<br>
FIG. 4, the communication requests from the first 212 and second 214 regular devices<br>
identify the third regular device 216 as the intended destination. The communication<br>
requests 402, 406 are received during a first receive frame 410 of the third mediation<br>
device 206. The first receive frame 410 is long compared to the duration of the<br>
communication requests 402, 406, in order to increase the chance that the<br>
communication requests 402, 406 will be received notwithstanding drifts in operating<br>
schedules of the devices 202-226 in the network stemming from the use of low cost,<br>
reduced accuracy clocks.<br>
The third regular device 216 sends a query message 412 to the third mediation<br>
device 206 during a transmit slot 411 of the third regular device 216, in order to<br>
ascertain if another device in the network 200 has sent a communication request to<br>
third mediation device 206 that identified the third regular device 216 as an intended<br>
destination for communication. The query 412 is also received during the first receive<br>
frame 410 of the third mediation device 206. Although, in the scenario illustrated in<br><br>
FIG. 4, the query 412 is received prior to both the communication requests 402, 406,<br>
this need not be the case.<br>
In response to receiving the communication request 402 from the first regular<br>
device 212, the third mediation device 206 sends a first acknowledgment message 414<br>
to the first regular device 212 during a first transmit frame 416 for the third mediation<br>
device 206. Similarly, the third mediation device 206 sends a second<br>
acknowledgement 418 to the second regular device 214, during the first transmit<br>
frame 416, in response to receiving the communication request 406 from the second<br>
regular device 214. The third mediation device 206 also sends a response message<br>
420 to the third regular device 216. The response message 420 is timed to a relatively<br>
short duration receive slot 422 of the third regular device 216. The response message<br>
420 commands the third regular device 216 to operate in receive mode during a<br>
specified period 438, in order to receive the multipart messages that are to be sent by<br>
the first 212 and second 214 regular devices via the third mediation device 206.<br>
The third mediation device 206 times the acknowledgment messages 414, 418<br>
and the response message 420 to coincide with short duration receive slots 422, 424,<br>
426 of the regular devices 216, 214, 212 by adding known (or communicated)<br>
intercommunication intervals for the regular devices 212, 214, 216 to times at which<br>
the communication requests 402, 406 and the query 412 were received by the third<br>
mediation device 206. The acknowledgement messages 414, 418 indicate to the first<br>
212 and second 214 regular devices when to transmit remaining parts of the multipart<br>
messages initiated with the communication requests 402,406.<br>
Subsequently, during a first series of time slots 428 commencing at a time<br>
indicated in the first acknowledgement 414, the first regular device 212 transmits<br><br>
remaining parts of the multipart message initiated in the first communication request<br>
402. In response to receiving the remaining parts of the multipart message, a third<br>
acknowledgement message 430 is transmitted from the third mediation device 206 to<br>
the first regular device 212. During a second series of slots 432 commencing at a<br>
time indicated in the second acknowledgement 418, the second regular device 214<br>
transmits remaining parts of the multipart message that was initiated with the second<br>
communication request 406. In response thereto, the third mediation device 206<br>
sends a fourth acknowledgement message 434 to the second regular device 214. The<br>
first 428 and second 432 series of time slots overlap receive periods 436 of the third<br>
mediation device 206.<br>
Parts of the multipart messages received by the third mediation device 206<br>
during receive periods 436 are stored in a queue prior to retransmission. The queue is<br>
suitably established in the workspace memory 104 of the third mediation device 206.<br>
A measure of the size of the queue built up during receive periods 436 of the<br>
mediation devices 202-210 is also stored in the mediation devices 202-210. A<br>
running average of the queue size over multiple receive periods is suitably used in<br>
order to filter out brief atypical excursions in the queue size. The queue size or<br>
average queue size of a particular mediation device indicates the communication load<br>
of the particular mediation device, and is closely related to the rate of battery<br>
depletion for the particular mediation device. As described further below, the queue<br>
size, average queue size, and/or other measures of communication load on the<br>
mediation devices 202-210 are used in selecting mediation devices in order to avoid<br>
battery exhaustion which might impair or disable the network 200.<br><br>
Referring again to FIG. 4, during the period 438 specified to the third regular<br>
device 216 by the third mediation device 206 in the response 420, the third mediation<br>
device 206 transmits the multipart messages that were received from the first 212 and<br>
second 214 regular devices and stored in the queue, to the third regular device 216.<br>
Thus, as shown in FIG. 4 mediation devices in the network 200 are able to relay<br>
messages between devices operating in regular device mode.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, it is apparent that the first 212 and second 214 regular<br>
devices are within range of the first mediation device 202 and the third mediation<br>
device 206. The first 212 and second 214 regular devices are thus able to use either<br>
the first mediation device 202, or the third mediation device 206 to synchronize as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3 or relay messages as illustrated in FIG. 4. A choice of mediation<br>
device can be effected by specifying an address of a particular mediation device in<br>
transmitted packets, and by transmitting during a receive period of a particular<br>
mediation device. (Because mediation devices operate at a higher duty cycle than<br>
regular devices, clock drift will be less of an impediment to synchronizing messages<br>
sent to a particular mediation device within the particular mediation device's receive<br>
period. This is the case even after a relatively long duration has passed since a<br>
previous communication with a particular mediation device which had afforded the<br>
opportunity to discover the timing of periodic reception frames of the particular<br>
mediation device.) Choosing a particular mediation device causes the particular<br>
mediation device 202-210 to expend energy. Mediation devices 202-210 will<br>
typically consume more power than regular devices. Overburdening a particular<br>
device will lead to battery exhaustion in the particular device, which in turn may<br>
impair or disable the network 200. FIGs. 5-6, 9-10 include flowcharts of operations<br><br>
performed by the wireless devices 202-226 in the network 200 in order to better<br>
distribute the burden on mediation devices.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 4, note that after receiving the multipart messages, the<br>
third regular device 216 transmits additional query messages, represented by a single<br>
query message 440, in order to ascertain whether additional messages are to be sent to<br>
the third regular device 216. Each additional query message may not coincide with a<br>
receive period of third mediation device 206, but may coincide with a receive period<br>
of another mediation device in the network 200. Although not shown in FIG. 4, if the<br>
first 212 and second 214 regular devices need to relay messages through a mediation<br>
device at a later time, they will send additional communication requests.<br>
Prior to the first receive frame 410 of the third mediation device 206 there is a<br>
short transmit slot 442. During the short transmit period 442 one or more<br>
announcement messages 444 that suitably include indications of communication load<br>
on the third mediation device 206 are transmitted. Use of the indications of<br>
communication load is discussed further with reference to FIGs. 5-7.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing operations performed by each mediation device<br>
202-210 in the network shown in FIG. 2 in maintaining current communication load<br>
information and transmitting such information to neighboring regular devices. The<br>
operations shown in FIG. 5 are part of network maintenance activities that take place<br>
on a schedule or in response to changes in the network 200. In block 502, a mediation<br>
device executing programs that embody the flowchart turns on its transceiver 110. In<br>
block 504, the mediation device transmits a list of each regular device that the<br>
mediation device communicates with to each regular device with which the mediation<br>
device communicates. (A particular regular device need not be included in the list it<br><br>
receives from the mediation device, as its inclusion is implicit.) The number of<br>
regular devices that a mediation device communicates with is useful as a<br>
characterization of the communication load on the mediation device. (Although a<br>
simple count would suffice as a characterization of communication load, a list is<br>
useful for message routing in that it allows regular devices to determine which other<br>
regular devices can be reached through a particular mediation device.)<br>
In block 506, additional parameters characterizing the communication load on<br>
the mediation device are transmitted to regular devices that the mediation device<br>
communicates with. Examples of additional parameters that characterize the<br>
communication load include: queue length, average queue length, average<br>
acknowledgement time, number of outstanding messages to be transmitted, etc. The<br>
transmissions of blocks 504, 506 suitably occur during short transmit periods (e.g.,<br>
period 442) of the mediation device, as described further below with reference to FIG.<br>
7. However the transmissions of blocks 504, 506 alternatively take place at other<br>
times, as for example, described below with reference to FIG. 8.<br>
Block 508 represents operation of the mediation device to facilitate<br>
communication between regular devices in the network 200, as described with<br>
reference to FIGs. 3-4, and taught in co-pending applications S/N 09/803,322, S/N<br>
10/443,424 and S/N 10/443,428.<br>
In block 510, the mediation device updates the parameters characterizing the<br>
communication load. In the case of queue length, the queue length is updated to<br>
reflect the size to which the queue grew during operation of the mediation device to<br>
facilitate communication in block 508. In the case that a running average of the queue<br><br>
length is used to characterize communication load, the running average is recomputed<br>
based on the queue length attained during the preceding execution of block 508.<br>
In block 512, the transceiver turns off to conserve battery power, and then<br>
after a delay 514 the mediation device loops back to block 502, to begin the foregoing<br>
operations again. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the order of the<br>
blocks shown in FIG. 5 can be varied.<br>
By executing the operations shown in FIG. 5, each particular mediation device<br>
202-210 in the network 200 informs regular devices that are served by the particular<br>
mediation device of the communication load on the particular mediation device. As<br>
described below with reference to FIGs. 6, 9-10, regular devices use information<br>
regarding the communication load on mediation devices in determining which<br>
mediation device or devices to use in order to avoid, to an extent, overburdening<br>
particular mediation devices.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing operations performed by regular devices in the<br>
network 200 shown in FIG. 2 in determining the availability of mediation devices. In<br>
block 602, a regular device receives from each particular mediation device within<br>
range a list of other regular devices that the particular mediation device serves. The<br>
information received in block 602 is the information sent in block 504 of the<br>
flowchart shown in FIG. 5.<br>
In block 604, the regular device receives additional parameters that<br>
characterize the communication load on one or more mediation devices within range<br>
of the regular device. The information received in block 604 is the information sent<br>
in block 506 of the flowchart shown in FIG. 5.<br><br>
Note that execution of blocks 602-604 can involve receiving during a plurality<br>
of separate receive periods for each of a plurality of mediation devices.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 6, block 606 is a decision block the outcome of which<br>
depends on whether communications are received from more than one mediation<br>
device, i.e. if more than one active mediation device is within range of the regular<br>
device executing the flowchart shown in FIG. 6. If communications are not received<br>
from more than one mediation device, then the flowchart continues with decision<br>
block 614, the outcome of which depends on whether communications are received<br>
from at least one mediation device. If communications were not received from even<br>
one mediation device, then the flowchart branches to block 612 in which, the device<br>
executing the flowchart commences operation in mediation device mode.<br>
Alternatively, in the case that communications are not received from any mediation<br>
device, the regular device executing the flowchart shown in FIG. 6 commences<br>
operation in a mode that does not use mediation devices. A suitable mode that does<br>
not rely on mediation devices is carrier sense multi access (CSMA).<br>
If in decision block 614 it is determined that communications were received<br>
from a single mediation device, then in block 616 the regular device executing the<br>
flowchart shown in FIG. 6 commences to operate in a single mediation device enabled<br>
mode. Use of a mediation device is described above with reference to FIGs. 3-4, and<br>
taught in co-pending applications S/N 09/803,322, S/N 10/443,424 and S/N<br>
10/443,428.<br>
If decision block 606 determines that communications were received from<br>
more than one mediation device, then the flowchart continues with block 608 in<br>
which, for each particular mediation device from which communications were<br><br>
received, the parameters that characterize the communication load on the particular<br>
mediation device are checked to determine if the communication load on the<br>
particular mediation device exceeds one or more predetermined limits. Each<br>
parameter that characterizes communication load can be checked separately against a separate predetermined limit;, and/or two or more of the parameters can be combined<br>
into a single measure that is checked against a predetermined limit. In the case that<br>
queue length or average queue length is used as indication of communication load, the<br>
queue length or average queue length is checked against an upper limit. Similarly, in<br>
the case that average acknowledgement time is used as an indication of<br>
communication load, the average acknowledgement time is checked against an upper<br>
limit. In using the number of devices that a mediation device communicates with as<br>
an indication of communication load, the number of devices that the mediation<br>
devices communicates with is compared to an upper limit. One suitable way by<br>
which a plurality of parameters that are indicative of communication load are<br>
combined is by taking a weighted sum of the parameters. The weighted sum is then<br>
compared to a limit. The upper limits used in block 608 are chosen in order to<br>
mitigate the problem of premature battery exhaustion due to mediation device<br>
overloading. The exact value of the upper limit is suitably determined after routine<br>
experimentation or network simulation.<br>
In block 610, mediation devices that have communication loads that exceed<br>
the one or more limits checked in block 608 are eliminated from a list of mediation<br>
devices to be used for cornmunicating by the regular device executing the flowchart.<br>
By having the regular device that is executing the flowchart not use devices that are<br><br>
found to have communication loads that exceed one or more limits, it is possible to<br>
avoid further overburdening of particular mediation devices.<br>
Block 618, which follows block 610, is a decision block, the outcome of<br>
which depends on whether more than one mediation device remains after executing<br>
block 610. If more than one mediation device remains after executing block 610 then<br>
the flowchart continues with block 616 described above. Even if all mediation<br>
devices from which communications were received have communication loads that<br>
exceed the limits checked in block 608, one mediation device, suitably a mediation<br>
device with the least communication load is used in block 616 by the regular device<br>
executing the flowchart.<br>
If, in the alternative more than one mediation device remains after eliminating<br>
mediation devices in block 610, then in block 620 the regular device executing the<br>
flowchart operates in a mediation device enabled mode with more than one mediation<br>
device. Use of multiple mediation devices, including the selection of mediation<br>
devices in order to avoid overloading particular mediation devices is discussed further<br>
below with reference to FIGs. 9-10.<br>
FIGs. 7-8 are timing diagrams illustrating processes by which regular devices<br>
detect mediation devices in their vicinity. One suitable time for the mediation devices<br>
to communicate parameters characterizing their communication load is when the<br>
mediation devices are detected by regular devices. FIG. 7 is a timing diagram<br>
illustrating a first method by which mediation devices are detected. As indicated by<br>
reference numerals, FIG. 7 includes time lines for the first mediation device 202, the<br>
third mediation device 206, and the first regular device 212. The first regular device<br>
is within range of both the first 202 and the third 206 mediation devices, and by the<br><br>
process illustrated in FIG. 7 detects both mediation devices 202,206. As illustrated in<br>
FIG. 7, in order to detect mediation devices that are within range of the first regular<br>
device 212, the first regular device 212 operates in receive mode for an extended<br>
period of time 702. The extended period of time 702 is suitably equal to a complete<br>
cycle time of the mediation devices 202-210. Each cycle time of the mediation<br>
devices 202-210 includes a period of active communication 442, 410, 416 and a<br>
longer inactive period. During the extended period of time 702, the first regular<br>
device 212 receives the announcement 444 from the first mediation device 202, and<br>
an announcement message 704 from the third mediation device 206. The<br>
announcement messages 444, 704 suitably contain parameters indicative of the<br>
communication load on the first 202 and third 206 mediation devices.<br>
Alternatively, announcement messages do not include parameters indicative of<br>
communication load, rather such parameters are sent after the announcement<br>
messages in response to a request for the parameters from a regular device that has<br>
been alerted to the presence of a mediation device by the mediation device's<br>
announcement message.<br>
FIG. 8 is a timing diagram illustrating a second method by which mediation<br>
devices are detected. In the method illustrated in FIG. 8, in order to detect mediation<br>
devices that are within range, each regular device, here exemplified by the first<br>
regular device 212, will go into a mode of operation in which the regular device will<br>
periodically send out a mediation device discovery message. After sending out each<br>
mediation device discovery message, each regular device waits for a predetermined<br>
period and then briefly operates in receive mode in order to receive responses to the<br>
mediation device discovery message. In FIG. 8, three mediation device discovery<br><br>
messages 802, 804, 806 are shown. The first mediation device discovery message<br>
802 happens to be transmitted within a receive frame 808 of the third mediation<br>
device 206. In response to the first mediation device discovery message 802, the third<br>
mediation device 206 transmits a first mediation device identification message 810.<br>
The second mediation device discovery message 804 is transmitted at a time when<br>
there is no mediation device within range of the first regular device 212 operating in<br>
receive mode. Consequently, the second mediation device discovery message 804<br>
goes unanswered. The third mediation device discovery message 806 is transmitted<br>
within a receive frame 812 of the first mediation device 202, and is received by the<br>
first mediation device 202. In response to receiving the third mediation device<br>
discovery message 806, the first mediation device transmits a second mediation<br>
device identification message 814. Information indicative of the communication<br>
loads on the first 202 and third 206 mediation devices is suitably included in the first<br>
810 and second 814 mediation device identification messages.<br>
Alternatively, identification messages do not include information indicative of<br>
communication load, rather information indicative of communication load is<br>
transmitted in subsequent messages in response to requests from regular devices,<br>
which have learned of mediation devices in their vicinity by receiving mediation<br>
device identification messages.<br>
The information indicative of communication load of mediation devices that is<br>
suitably conveyed in the processes illustrated in FIGs. 7-8, optionally includes the list<br>
of regular devices that a mediation device serves, and the additional parameters<br>
characterizing communication load that are received in blocks 602-604 of the<br>
flowchart shown in FIG. 6.<br><br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart showing operations performed by a regular device in the<br>
network 200 shown in FIG. 2, in proportioning the use of multiple, in-range mediation<br>
devices. The operations shown in FIG. 9 can be conducted after executing the<br>
operations shown in FIG. 6, or, alternatively, without executing the operations shown<br>
in FIG. 6. Referring to FIG. 9, in block 902 the regular device receives parameters<br>
that indicate the communication load on a plurality of mediation devices. In the case<br>
that the operations shown in FIG. 9 are performed after executing the operations<br>
shown in FIG. 6, then block 902 is redundant with blocks 602, 604 and need not be<br>
included. In block 904, messages including data to be sent to other wireless devices is<br>
read. The messages can be received from another wireless device or internally<br>
generated. In block 906, a proportion of messages (or parts of a multipart message) to<br>
be sent using each particular mediation device that is in range of the regular device<br>
executing the flowchart in FIG. 9, is set to an amount that is inversely related to a<br>
communication load on the particular mediation device. Thus, mediation devices that<br>
have reported high communication loads will be used less, and mediation devices that<br>
have reported low communication loads will be used more. One way to set the<br>
proportion of usage of mediation devices in inverse relation to the communication<br>
load on mediation devices is to use the following equation:<br>
EQU. 1:<br><br>
where, Pi is a proportion of messages sent using an ith mediation device that is<br>
within range of a particular regular device having messages to send; C.L.j is a<br><br>
quantification of a communication load on a jth device; and the summation is taken<br>
over N mediation devices that are within range of the particular regular device having<br>
messages to send.<br>
In equation one, the quantification of communication load C.L.j can be based<br>
on a single parameter such as queue length, average queue length, average<br>
acknowledgement time, or the number of devices with which a mediation device<br>
communicates. Alternatively, the quantity C.L j can be a value that combines (e.g. in<br>
a weighted sum or other mathematical formula) multiple parameters that are<br>
indicative of communication load.<br>
In block 908, the messages (or parts of a multipart message) that were read in<br>
block 904 are transmitted using mediation devices in the proportions determined in<br>
block 906. In sending messages according to the proportions determined block 908, a<br>
round robin method is suitably used. In a round robin method, for each successive<br>
group of a number M of messages (or parts of a multipart message), the number M is<br>
suitably multiplied by the proportion determined for each mediation device<br>
determined in block 908, and the result rounded to an integer number to obtain a<br>
number out of the M messages (or parts of multipart messages) that is to be sent using<br>
each mediation device. Each mediation device is then used to send the computed<br>
number of messages. In case the communication loads on the mediation devices<br>
happens to vary substantially, and updated information on the communication loads is<br>
received, it is prudent to use mediation devices in order according to their<br>
communication loads, starting with the mediation device with the lightest<br>
communication load.<br><br>
FIG. 10 is a flowchart showing operations performed by a regular device in<br>
the network 200 shown in FIG. 2 in selecting a mediation device to use based on<br>
mediation device communication load and routing considerations. In block 1002 a<br>
destination address for a message that is to be sent is read. The message comprises<br>
one or more parts. In block 1004, the destination address is looked up in a routing<br>
table maintained by the regular device. The routing table is suitably constructed by<br>
any of a variety of methods including the well know techniques of Dynamic Source<br>
Routing, Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Destination-Sequenced<br>
Distance Vector Routing (DSDV), or any other ad hoc wireless routing protocol that<br>
stores a routing table for nodes storing device addresses and other routing cost<br>
constraint information. For use in connection with this embodiment, such routing<br>
techniques are modified so that more than one route to each destination is maintained<br>
in the routing table. In particular, if there exist multiple routes for a given destination<br>
that have different mediation devices as a next hop from the regular device executing<br>
the flowchart in FIG. 10, such routes are retained in the routing table. Block 1006 is a<br>
decision block, the outcome of which depends on whether multiple routes through<br>
different next hop mediation devices are found in the routing table. If the outcome of<br>
decision block 1006 is negative the flowchart branches to decision block 1008, the<br>
outcome of which depends on whether at least one route is found in the routing table.<br>
If a single route to the destination is found, then the flowchart branches to block 1010<br>
in which the single route is used to send the message.<br>
If on the other hand, it is determined in decision block 1008 that there is no<br>
route to the destination in the routing table, then in block 1012 a route discovery<br>
process is performed to obtain route information along with virtual hop counts for one<br><br>
or more routes. As used herein, the term virtual hop count encompasses metrics of<br>
properties of a route that directly or indirectly relate to how quickly use of the route<br>
will lead to battery exhaustion. Such metrics are based on quantities that apply to<br>
each link and/or to each node along a route. The quantities are suitably summed,<br>
multiplied or combined with a minimum (MUST) or maximum (MAX) mathematical<br>
operator in mathematical expressions of the virtual hop count metrics.<br>
Examples of quantities on which virtual hop count metrics are suitably based<br>
include battery energy (indicated by voltage) remaining in nodes along a route,<br>
transmit power for links along a route (which relates to battery energy consumption),<br>
packet loss rates for links along a route (which relates to the required retransmissions<br>
and thereby to battery consumption), received signal strength indication (RSSI) and<br>
signal to noise ration (SNR) (which are predictors of retransmission rates, and thus<br>
battery consumption) for links along the route. Each node in the network 200 is<br>
programmed to evaluate the quantities for itself and for one or more links of which it<br>
is an end point. The quantities are suitably collected in route discovery packets in the<br>
form of a single quantity which is to become the virtual hop count metric, or in a list<br>
of quantities. The quantities can appear in linear and nonlinear expressions of the<br>
virtual hop count metrics. As the route discovery packet propagates along potential<br>
routes, at each node that the route discovery packet crosses, the quantities for the node<br>
and/or adjacent link are added to the list or incorporated into the single quantity,<br>
which is to become the virtual hop count. This single quantity virtual hop count is<br>
updated by adding a term, multiplying in another factor, revaluating a MIN or MAX<br>
function, or reevaluating another type of mathematical function. In the case of<br>
AODV routing, the route reply messages can be used to collect quantities that<br><br>
determine the virtual hop count metric. Quantities collected in the route reply<br>
messages would take the place or supplement the hop count field typically included in<br>
such messages. In block 1014, the virtual hop counts are suitably stored in the routing<br>
table in association with routes to which they apply.<br>
After route discovery has been performed in block 1012 and the resulting<br>
routes stored in the routing table in block 1014, the flowchart returns to decision<br>
block 1006 previously described. If upon executing block 1006, whether it is reached<br>
from block 1004, or block 1014, it is determined that multiple routes through different<br>
next hop mediation devices to the destination exist, then the flowchart branches to<br>
block 1016. Block 1016 is a decision block the outcome of which depends on<br>
whether the virtual hop counts for any of the routes to the destination are below a<br>
predetermined threshold which would tend to indicate that the destination is nearby.<br>
The value of the predetermined threshold is suitably set based on real or simulated<br>
experimentation in which multiple values of the predetermined threshold are<br>
evaluated with respect to their effect on battery exhaustion in the network 200. If it is<br>
determined that any of the virtual hop counts are below the predetermined threshold,<br>
then the flowchart branches to block 1018.<br>
In block 1018 a route is chosen from among those routes that have virtual hop<br>
counts below the threshold, based on the communication loads on the mediation<br>
devices that are involved in the first hop along each of the multiple routes to the<br>
destination. In particular, the regular device chooses the route that has the lowest<br>
communication load on the mediation device that is involved in the first hop.<br>
If on the other- hand, it is determined in block 1016 that none of the multiple<br>
routes to the destination have virtual hop counts below the threshold, then the<br><br>
flowchart branches to block 1020 in which the route (and the MD involved in the first<br>
hop of the route) is chosen based on the virtual hop count along the route. In<br>
particular, the route, which has the lowest virtual hop count is chosen. It will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that a simple change in the expression of the<br>
virtual hop count metric (e.g., inversion or subtraction from 1) would alter the virtual<br>
hop count metric such that it would be appropriate to choose a maximum virtual hop<br>
count metric as opposed to a minimum virtual hop count metric.<br>
While the preferred, and other embodiments of the invention have been<br>
illustrated and described, it will be clear that the invention is not so limited.<br>
Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions, and equivalents will<br>
occur to those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope<br>
of the present invention as defined by the following claims.<br>

receive one or more parameters indicating a communication load carried<br>
by the particular mediation device; and<br><br>
schedule transmission through at least one of the plurality of mediation<br>
devices according to the one or more parameters by distributing transmissions<br>
among the more than one of the plurality of mediation devices, wherein each<br>
particular mediation device of the more than one of the plurality of mediation<br>
devices that are detected is used for an amount of transmissions that is inversely<br>
related to the communication load carried by the particular mediation device as<br>
indicated by the one or more parameters.<br><br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
METHOD OF OPERATING A WIRELESS DEVICE FOR SENDING DATA IN A NETWORK<br>
COMPRISING MEDIATION DEVICES AND WIRELESS DEVICE THERFOR<br>
The present invention relates to protocols for ad-hoc wireless networks (200) that use mediation<br>
devices (202-210) to facilitate communication between low power, low duty cycle wireless devices<br>
(212-226) are provided. In order to avoid premature battery exhaustion in particular devices, devices<br>
operating as mediation devices (202-210) report their communication load to low duty cycle wireless<br>
devices (212-226) that are positioned to be able to use the mediation devices (202-210). Based on the<br>
information as to communication load received from multiple mediation devices (202-210), and<br>
optionally on a virtual hop count that is a predictor of how rapidly the use of a route through a<br>
particular mediation device will lead to battery exhaustion, low duty cycle wireless devices (212-226)<br>
choose a mediation device (202-210) to use or proportion use of mediation devices (202-210) in order<br>
to delay battery exhaustion in the network.</td>
