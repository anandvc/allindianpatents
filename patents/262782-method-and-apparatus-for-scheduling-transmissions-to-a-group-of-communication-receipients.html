METHOD AND APPARATUS TO FACILITATE<br>
SCHEDULING TRANSMISSIONS TO GROUP RECIPIENTS<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] This invention relates generally to communication systems and more<br>
particularly to group-based transmissions.<br>
Background<br>
[0002] Communication systems of various kinds are known in the art. Some<br>
communication systems support one or more communication needs for groups of<br>
communication recipients. For example, some systems permit a given user-based<br>
message to be transmitted to each of a plurality of individual communication<br>
recipients (such as, but not limited to, two-way wireless communication devices such<br>
as cellular telephones, push-to-talk devices, and so forth). Some systems facilitate<br>
such capability by providing each communication recipient with a scheduled personal<br>
communication opportunity. Such an approach may comprise, for example, a<br>
particular slot as occurs at a specific consistent location in a recurring slot cycle. As<br>
each intended recipient's scheduled personal communication opportunity occurs the<br>
communication system transmits the desired content to that particular recipient.<br>
[0003] Such an approach, of course, can consume considerable system resources.<br>
For example, many individual transmissions may be required to reach a large group of<br>
intended recipients using this approach. To avoid this concern, some communication<br>
systems provide for an occasional scheduled group communication opportunity. This<br>
scheduled group communication opportunity often comprises a particular slot that is<br>
monitored by a corresponding group of potential communication recipients. In many<br>
typical deployments this scheduled group communication opportunity will not occur<br>
with each slot cycle. As a result, considerable delay may be experienced before a<br>
given communication need can be met by effecting a one-to-many transmission using<br>
a scheduled group communication opportunity such as this.<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2007/024321	PCT/US2006/023703<br>
[0004] As noted above, scheduled individual communication opportunities are<br>
often viewed as consuming undue system resources while scheduled group<br>
communication opportunities sometimes give rise to unacceptable levels of latency.<br>
The problems do not stop with only these issues. For example, varying systems<br>
and/or varying communication services typically have varying corresponding<br>
performance requirements. In some application settings, the time used to contact at<br>
least a first member of a group of communication recipients comprises a critical<br>
metric. In other application settings, however, the time used to effect contact with the<br>
last member of a group of communication recipients may comprise an important<br>
metric. Issues such as these and others too numerous to mention render architectural<br>
design in this regard difficult.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
[0005] The above needs are at least partially met through provision of the method<br>
and apparatus to facilitate scheduling transmissions to group recipients described in<br>
the following detailed description, particularly when studied in conjunction with the<br>
drawings, wherein:<br>
[0006] FIG. 1 comprises a schematic view of a slot cycle as configured in<br>
accordance with the prior art;<br>
[0007] FIG. 2 comprises a flow diagram as configured in accordance with various<br>
embodiments of the invention; and	,<br>
[0008] FIG. 3 comprises a block diagram as configured in accordance with<br>
various embodiments of the invention.<br>
[0009] Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated<br>
for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example,<br>
the dimensions and/or relative positioning of some of the elements in the figures may<br>
be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of various<br>
embodiments of the present invention. Also, common but well-understood elements<br>
that are useful or necessary in a commercially feasible embodiment are often not<br>
depicted in order to facilitate a less obstructed view of these various embodiments of<br>

WO 2007/024321	PCT/US2006/023703<br>
the present invention. It will further be appreciated that certain actions and/or steps<br>
may be described or depicted in a particular order of occurrence while those skilled in<br>
the arts will understand that such specificity with respect to sequence is not actually<br>
required. It will also be understood that the terms and expressions used herein have<br>
the ordinary meaning as is accorded to such terms and expressions with respect to<br>
their corresponding respective areas of inquiry and study except where specific<br>
meanings have otherwise been set forth herein.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
[0010] Generally speaking, pursuant to these various embodiments, upon<br>
detecting a communication need for a group of communication recipients that entails<br>
attempting to make at least one transmission to each of the communication recipients<br>
in the group (wherein at least one of the communication recipients has both a<br>
scheduled personal communication opportunity and a scheduled group<br>
communication opportunity), one automatically uses whichever of the scheduled<br>
communication opportunities occurs first to make the transmission to the<br>
communication recipient(s) for which this option applies.<br>
[0011] In a typical deployment the scheduled personal communication<br>
opportunity is likely to occur at least once per each slot cycle whereas the scheduled<br>
group communication opportunity is likely to occur less frequently than the scheduled<br>
personal communication opportunity. Accordingly, for this and other reasons as well,<br>
selection of a first-to-occur opportunity as specified above is, in some embodiments,<br>
further informed by consideration of other criteria as well. Examples of such criteria<br>
include, but are not limited to, present loading of the system (where a preference for<br>
using the first-to-occur opportunity may tend to increase as system loading decreases),<br>
a relative size of the group (where a preference for using the first-to-occur opportunity<br>
may tend to increase as the size of the group of intended communication recipients<br>
decreases), and availability of current location information for specific intended<br>
communication recipients (where one may tend to favor using a next scheduled<br>
personal communication opportunity instead of the next first-to-occur opportunity for<br>
communication recipients having a known present location), to name but a few.<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2007/024321	PCT/US2006/023703<br>
[0012] So configured, the varying needs of a variety of communication systems<br>
and/or services can be more conveniently met. In particular, considerable flexibility<br>
exists to emphasize scheduling behaviors in ways that tend to support rather than<br>
detract from desired performance metrics. In general, overall latency can often be<br>
improved without causing undue impact on system resource availability. This, in<br>
turn, tends to promote a better user experience without sacrificing loading capacity.<br>
[0013] These and other benefits may become clearer upon making a thorough<br>
review and study of the following detailed description. Referring now to the<br>
drawings, and in particular to FIG. 1, it may be helpful to first briefly describe and<br>
characterize a general application context within which these teachings may be<br>
usefully employed. Viewed generally, a communication channel is divided with<br>
respect to time to form a plurality of slot cycles 101. In this illustrative setting, each<br>
slot cycle 101 is comprised of a plurality of slots. These slots are typically dedicated<br>
(or are at least reserved and/or available) to support specific communication needs.<br>
Forexample, one or more slots (not shown) may be used to convey system<br>
information of interest or need.<br>
[0014] At least one such slot is used, in this application setting, as a scheduled<br>
individual communication opportunity 102 for a given corresponding target recipient<br>
(such as a wireless two-way communications device). (In some application settings a<br>
number of different target recipients may share the same slot, and hence may share<br>
the same scheduled individual communication opportunity. In such a case an<br>
identifier may accompany a message to permit the recipients to ascertain whether<br>
information as is received during such a slot is indeed intended for them.)<br>
[0015] As suggested by the depiction shown in FIG. 1, the individual<br>
communication opportunity described above recurs in a similar relative position with<br>
respect to the slot cycle 101 itself and on a cyclical basis as the slot cycles 101 repeat<br>
over time (hence suggesting that the opportunity be viewed as a "scheduled"<br>
opportunity). Also shown in FIG. 1 is a slot cycle 103 that also includes a slot that<br>
comprises a scheduled group communication opportunity 104. This scheduled group<br>
communication opportunity 104 may substitute for, for example, system control<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2007/024321	PCT7US2006/023703<br>
information that might otherwise be transmitted at that respective location of the slot<br>
cycle. In a typical application setting this scheduled group communication<br>
opportunity 104 can be used to address, simultaneously, a large number of target<br>
recipients (wherein the target recipients are programmed to monitor the scheduled<br>
group communication opportunity 104 for such group messages).<br>
[0016] As already noted earlier, in a typical application setting this scheduled<br>
group communication opportunity 104 does not occur as frequently as the scheduled<br>
personal communication opportunities 102. So configured, however, and as usefully<br>
exploited herein, a given target recipient as comprises a part of a group of target<br>
recipients can be contacted either via a scheduled personal communication<br>
opportunity or a scheduled group personal communication opportunity as corresponds<br>
to that target recipient.<br>
[0017] Referring now to FIG. 2, a process 200 suitable to be carried out by, for<br>
example, a group communication scheduler, will be described.<br>
[0018] Pursuant to this process 200, one detects 201 when a communication need<br>
for a group of communication recipients occurs, which communication need entails at<br>
least attempting to make at least one transmission to each of the communication<br>
recipients in the group. These teachings are useful with a wide variety of<br>
communication needs including, but not limited to, a need to forward a user message<br>
(as part of a one-to-many broadcast, for example), a need to establish a channel to be<br>
used to forward at least one user message, and so forth. The at least one transmission<br>
referred to above can also comprise any of a wide variety of specific actions<br>
including, but not limited to, a page, a user message, and so forth.<br>
[0019] In one approach at least one of the communication recipients has both a<br>
scheduled personal communication opportunity and a scheduled group<br>
communication opportunity. In other approaches, all of the intended communication<br>
recipients will be so provisioned. The scheduled personal communication opportunity<br>
can comprise, for example, an event that occurs at least once per each slot cycle. The<br>
scheduled group communication opportunity can comprise, for example, an event that<br>
occurs less frequently than the scheduled personal communication opportunity.<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2007/024321	PCT/US2006/023703<br>
[0020] In response to detecting 201 such a need, this process 200 then provides<br>
for automatically using 202 whichever of the scheduled personal communication<br>
opportunity and the scheduled group communication opportunity occurs first to make<br>
the at least one transmission to the corresponding communication recipient(s). For<br>
example, if a scheduled group communication opportunity will occur first in time as<br>
compared to a next scheduled personal communication opportunity, this process could<br>
facilitate favoring the former. In a case where the reverse is true, however, this<br>
process could facilitate favoring use of "the scheduled personal communication<br>
opportunity as versus the scheduled group communication opportunity.<br>
[0021] If desired, limits can be used to constrain these choices. For example, this<br>
process 200 could further support determining a duration of time until a next<br>
opportunity to communicate to a given communication recipient using the scheduled<br>
group communication opportunity. One could then automatically use whichever of<br>
the scheduled personal communication opportunity and the scheduled group<br>
communication opportunity occurs first to make the needed transmission so long-as<br>
the above-determined duration of time does not exceed a predetermined duration.<br>
[0022] The above-described process may be sufficiently complete to render<br>
satisfactory performance in at least some communication systems. In other settings,<br>
however, it may be desirable to further condition and inform the automatic use 202 of<br>
whichever opportunity becomes available first. As a first example, such automatic<br>
use 202 of the first available communication opportunity may be conditioned as a<br>
function, at least in part, of determined system loading 203 (i.e., information<br>
regarding recent, present, and/or likely near-term future active use of the<br>
communication system by a particular number of users). As system loading increases,<br>
it may become less desirable to employ system resources to contact specific target<br>
recipients via their scheduled personal communication opportunities as this may<br>
unduly additionally burden the communication system. In such a case, this step of<br>
automatically using 202 the earlier communication opportunity can comprise tending<br>
to automatically use the scheduled group communication opportunity to make the<br>
necessary transmission to the communication recipients as system loading increases.<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2007/024321	PCT/US2006/023703<br>
Conversely, as system loading decreases, this step can comprise tending to select<br>
whichever communication opportunity arrives earlier as already described.<br>
[0023] As another example, this step can be conditioned as a function, at least in<br>
part, of communication recipient group size and/or the known (or unknown)<br>
whereabouts 204 of the target recipients as comprise the group. As the sheer relative<br>
number of communication recipients grows it may again comprise an undue<br>
additional burden on the communication system to potentially utilize scheduled<br>
personal communication opportunities as described herein. In such a case, this step of<br>
automatically using 202 the earliest communication opportunity can comprise tending<br>
to automatically use whichever of the scheduled communication opportunities occurs<br>
first to make the desired transmission as the communication recipient group size tends<br>
to be relatively small. The particular number of communication recipients as may<br>
comprise a cut-off or trigger value in this regard will of course vary with the specifics<br>
of a given communication system as well as any performance requirements as may be<br>
desired and/of required by the system administrator:<br>
[0024] This step of tending to automatically use whichever of the scheduled<br>
communication opportunities occurs first to make the desired transmission as the<br>
communication recipient group size tends to be relatively small is particularly useful<br>
when the present whereabouts of at least a substantial number of the communication<br>
recipients is unknown. Conversely, when the specific whereabouts of a given<br>
communication recipient is known, such knowledge may aid in dictating use of a<br>
particular communication opportunity other than as based upon a first-in-time criteria.<br>
In such a case, and where the present whereabouts of a significant number of<br>
communication recipients is known, then again it may be appropriate to modify this<br>
step 202 to tend towards an alternative selection preference other than first-in-time<br>
determinations.<br>
[0025] As yet another example, this step 202 can be conditioned as a function, at<br>
least in part, of whether a transmission response has recently been received 205 for<br>
one or more of the communication recipients. More particularly, and if desired,<br>
automatic use 202 of the earliest communication opportunity can further comprise<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2007/024321	PCTYUS2006/023703<br>
determining whether a response to an earlier one of the necessary transmissions to an<br>
earlier selected one of the communication recipients has been received, and if so,<br>
determining whether a present location for another of the communication recipients to<br>
which the necessary transmission has not yet been transmitted is known. In such as<br>
case, when at least one communication recipient has responded to the transmission<br>
and the present location of another communication recipient (to which the necessary<br>
transmission has not yet been made) is known, this step 202 may usefully comprise<br>
automatically not using the scheduled personal communication opportunity for the<br>
communication recipient having the known location.<br>
[0026] This may be useful, for example, in a setting when a communication<br>
recipient has responded such that the system knows that a channel assignment will<br>
eventually be transmitted in a given sector that includes that communication recipient,<br>
and when another as-yet-uncontacted communication recipient is also known to be in<br>
that same sector. In such a case it may be better to simply transmit a channel<br>
assignment throughout that sector, which channel assignment will inherently address<br>
the need to transmit to the as-yet-uncontacted communication recipient.<br>
[0027] So configured, considerable flexibility can accompany highly leveraged<br>
use of the availability of both personal and group scheduled communication<br>
opportunities. A first-in-time approach can be either implemented in all instances if<br>
desired or can be favored, or disfavored, as a function of system or communication<br>
system dynamics of interest and choice. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
the above-described processes are readily enabled using any of a wide variety of<br>
available and/or readily configured platforms, including partially or wholly<br>
programmable platforms as are known in the art or dedicated purpose platforms as<br>
may be desired for some applications. Referring now to FIG. 3, an illustrative<br>
approach to such a platform will now be provided.<br>
[0028] An exemplary apparatus 300 may be comprised of a group communication<br>
processor 301 as is otherwise understood in the art and that operably couples to both a<br>
scheduled personal communication opportunity transmission output 302 and a<br>
scheduled group communication opportunity transmission output 303. The two<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2007/024321	PCT/US2006/023703<br>
transmission outputs 302 and 303, in turn and pursuant to one configuration, operably<br>
couple to a transceiver 304, such as a wireless transceiver, of choice. So configured,<br>
the group communication processor 301 has the ability to use either or both of the<br>
personal and group scheduled communication opportunity transmission outputs when<br>
seeking to provide a transmission to each communication recipient as comprises a part<br>
of a corresponding group to thereby meet a particular communication need. These<br>
generally described elements (including as well their interaction and specific<br>
functionality) will of course vary from system to system but are otherwise generally<br>
well understood in the art. Accordingly, for the sake of brevity and the preservation<br>
of narrative focus no further details regarding such elements will be provided here.<br>
[0029] This apparatus 300 also comprises, in this illustrative embodiment, a group<br>
communication scheduler 305 that operably couples to the group communication<br>
processor 301. (These elements can comprise separate physical elements as suggested<br>
by the depiction presented in FIG. 3. Those skilled in the art will also understand and<br>
appreciate, however, that fwd or more of these elements can share a common enabling<br>
platform and in that case the provided depiction serves more as a logical view of the<br>
apparatus 300.) In one embodiment this group communication scheduler 305 is<br>
configured and arranged (via, for example, programming that accords with the<br>
teachings set forth above) to automatically prompt use of whichever of a scheduled<br>
personal communication opportunity and a scheduled group communication<br>
opportunity occurs first for each communication recipient of a group communication<br>
as has both a scheduled personal communication opportunity and a scheduled group<br>
communication opportunity.<br>
[0030] This arrangement can of course implement any or all of the specific<br>
embellishments as were presented earlier. For example, the group communication<br>
scheduler 305 can be configured and arranged to determine system loading and to<br>
automatically use an earliest communication opportunity as a function, at least in part,<br>
of the system loading. This can comprise, for instance, tending to automatically use<br>
whichever of the scheduled personal communication opportunity and the scheduled<br>
group communication opportunity occurs first as system loading decreases.<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2007/024321	PCT/US2006/023703<br>
v Conversely, this can comprise tending to favor a scheduled group communication<br>
opportunity as system loading increases.<br>
[0031] As another example, the group communication scheduler 305 can be<br>
configured and arranged to determine how many communication recipients are to<br>
receive the group communication and to then automatically use the earliest<br>
communication opportunity as a function, at least in part, of how many<br>
communication recipients are to receive the group communication. This can<br>
comprise, for instance, tending to automatically use whichever of the scheduled<br>
personal communication opportunity and the scheduled group communication<br>
opportunity occurs first as the relative (and/or absolute) number of communication<br>
recipients decreases. Conversely, this can comprise tending to favor a scheduled<br>
group communication opportunity as the number of communication recipients<br>
increases.<br>
[0032] .As yet another example, the group communication scheduler 305 can be<br>
configured and arranged, if desired, to determine whether a present location for one or<br>
more intended recipients of the group communication is known, and automatically<br>
using the scheduled personal communication opportunity for any of the intended<br>
communication recipients for which a present location is known. So configured, an<br>
earliest communication opportunity can be selected and used for each communication<br>
recipient (meaning, in this example, as between a personal and a group<br>
communication opportunity) except for communication recipients having a present<br>
known location. As to communication recipients having a present known location, a<br>
scheduled personal communication opportunity can instead be used even when a<br>
scheduled group communication opportunity might otherwise arrive at an earlier time.<br>
[0033] Those skilled in the art will understand and recognize the great flexibility<br>
offered by these teachings. The notion of being able to select either a personal or<br>
group scheduled communication opportunity to reach various members of a<br>
predefined group in and of itself provides considerable power and capability to meet a<br>
number of varying performance goals or requirements. The ability to then modify<br>
that capability as a function of other criteria of interest (such as system loading, group<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2007/024321	PCT/US2006/023703<br>
size, and so forth) provides an even more extensive ability to fine tune group message<br>
processing in a way that best accommodates the unique attributes of a given<br>
communication system.<br>
[0034] Those skilled in the art will recognize that a wide variety of modifications,<br>
alterations, and combinations can be made with respect to the above described<br>
embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, and that<br>
such modifications, alterations, and combinations are to be viewed as being within the<br>
ambit of the inventive concept.<br>
