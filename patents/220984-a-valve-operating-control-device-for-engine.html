DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRKH KMROnTMENT The present invention will now be described by way of an<br>
embodiment of the present invention with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring to Fig.l, a DOHC type 4-cylinder straight<br>
engine E includes a crankshaft 1, an intake camshaft 12 and an<br>
received exhaust camshaft 13.  A timing chain 17 is     - around a<br>
crankshaft sprocket 14 mounted at end of the crankshaft 11, an<br>
intake camshaft sprocket 15 mounted at end of the intake<br>
camshaft 12 and an exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 mounted at end<br>
of the exhaust camshaft 13. The timing chain 17 is driven in<br>
a direction of an arrow"a'by the crankshaft 11, whereby the intake<br>
camshaft 12 and the exhaust camshaft 13 are rotated at a speed<br>
half of the speed of the crankshaft 11. Each of cylinders<br><br>
Includes two intaJce valves 18, IS driven by the intake camshaft<br>
12,	and two exhaust valves 19, 19 driven by the esthaust camshaft<br>
13.	The lift amount and opening duration of each of the two<br>
intake valves 18, 18 are capable of being varied by a first<br>
valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism Vl provided<br>
for each of the cylinders, and the timing of opening of each<br>
of the intake valves 18, 18 is capable of being varied by a second<br>
valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism V2 provided<br>
at an end of the intake camshaft 12.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 to 4, a cylinder head 23 is superposed on an upper surface of a cylinder block 21 with a gasket 22 interposed therebetween and is fastened to the upper surface by a plurality Of bolts 24. A lower camshaft holder 25 and an upper camshaft holder 26 each also serving as a locker arm shaft holder are superposed on an upper surface of the cylinder head 23 and fastened together to the cylinder head 23 by four bolts 27, 28, 29 and 30. Upper portions of the lower camshaft holder 25 and the upper camshaft holder 26 are covered with ahead cover 31. An intake rocker arm shaft 32 and an exhaust rocker arm shaft 33 are fixed to the lower camshaft holder 2S, and the Intake camshaft 12 and the exhaust camshaft 13 are rotatably carried on mating surfaces of the lower camshaft holder 25 and the upper camshaft holder 26.<br>
As can be seen from Figs 5 and 7, an oil passage PI is<br>
- defined in the cylinder head 23 and leading to an oil pump (not<br>
shown) driven by the crankshaft 11, an oil passage P2 is diverted<br><br>
from the oil passage PI to communicate with a fist hydraulic pressure control valve 34 mounted on a side of the cylinder head 23. An oil passage P6 exiting the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 Into the cylinder head 23 extends upwards to communicate with an oil passage 7 defined In a lower surface (a surface mating with the cylinder head 23) of a bulge 25a integral with the lower camshaft holder 25. An oil drain port 25b is defined in a downstream end of the oil passage P7 and opposed to a zone of starting of the meshing of the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 and the timing chain 17. The oil drain port 25b is narrowed slightly, as compared with a sectional area of a flow path of the oil passage P7 , so that oil can be supplied reliably to the above-described meshing-starting zone. A blind plug 35 is mounted on an upper surface of a bulge 25a of the lower camshaft holder 25 located on an extension of an oil passage P6 extending upwards in the cylinder head 23.<br>
An oil passage P9 exiting the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 and extending horizontally within the cylinder head 23 communicates with an oil passage FIO extending upwards. , The oil passage PIO opens into the upper surface of the cylinder head 23 and communicates with an oil passage Pll defined in a lower surface of the lower camshaft holder 25. The oil passage Pll in the lower camshaft holder 25 communicates with oil passages P12 and P13 defined around outer peripheries of two 28, 29 of the four bolts 27 to 30 for fastening the lower camshaft holder 25 and the upper camshaft holder 26 to the cylinder head<br><br>
23. The oil passage P12 around tHe outer periphery of the bolts 28 communicates with an oil passage 33a defined axlally In the exhaust rocker arm shaft 33, and the oil passage P13 around the outer periphery of the bolt 29 communicates with an oil passage 32a defined axially in the intake rocker arm shaft 32 and with an oil Jet 36 provided in the lower camshaft holder 25.<br>
As can be seen from Fig.8, the oil jet 36 is comprised of an oil jet body 37 having a nozzle bore 37a, and a mounting bolt 39 for fixing the oil jet body 37 to the lower camshaft holder 25 with a seal member 36 interposed therebetween. A relief valve 40 is accommodated within the mounting bolt 39, so that its upstream portion communicates with the oil passage P12 axound the outer periphery of the bolt 2B, and its downstream portion communicates with the nozzle bore 37a in the oil jet body 37. By fitting a positioning projection 37b formed on the oil jet body 37 into a positioning bore 25c defined in the lower camshaft holder 25, the oil Jet 36 is positioned so that the nozzle bore 37a points to the zone of starting of the meshing of the intake camshaft sprocket 15 and the timing chain 17.<br>
The oil jet 36 is disposed in a dead space defined between the lower camshaft holder 25 and the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16, so that it is fallen into an outside diameter of the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 and hence, the influence exerted by the mounting of the oil jet 36 to other members can be suppressed to the minimum. Particularly, the oil jet 36 is disposed by affectively utilizing a dead space on a back of the exhaust<br><br>
camshaft sprocket 16, which is not occupied by the second valve-operating chaxacteristic changing mechanism V2. Therefore, it is possible to suppress an Increase in sise of the engine E and the obstruction of the mounting of the other members due to the mounting the oil jet 36 to the minimum. As shown in Fig.2, a lightening bore 16a made in the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 for reducing the weight thereof is opposed to the oil jet 36. In other words, the oil jet 36 is provided to face the lightening bore 16a made in the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 and hence, the mounted state of the oil jet 36 and the forgetting to mount the oil jet 36 can be checked easily through the lightening bore I6a.<br>
If the entire mounting bolt 39 of the oil jet 36 is disposed within a region of the lightening bore 16a in the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16, the mounting bolt 39 can be removed through the lightening bore 16a, leading to an enhanced maintenance. If the entire oil jet 36 Is disposed within a region of the lightening bore 16a In the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16, the oil jet 36 can be removed through the lightening bore 16a, leading to an enhanced maintenance.<br>
As can be seen from Figs.3, 4 and 8, a chain guide 41 is fastened by the two bolts 28 and 29 for fastening the upper camshaft holder 26 (the inner bolts disposed inside the intake camshaft 12 and the exhaust camshaft 13). The two bolts 28 and 29 for fastening the upper camshaft holder 26 are offset by a<br>
distance 6 in a direction away from the oil jet 36 with respect<br><br>
to the two bolts 27 and 30 disposed outside the bolts 2fi and 29. Thus, It is possible to avoid the interference with the bolts 28 and 29 to secure the mounting space for the oil jet 36 and moreover to enhance the support rigidity of the oil Jet 36.<br>
One of the two offset bolts 26 and 29 is overlapped on the oil jet 36 as viewed in an axial direction'of the exhaust camshaft 13 and hence, it is possible not only to reduce the size of the lower camshaft holder 25, but also to enhance the support rigidity of the exhaust camshaft 13 . The reason is that if the oil Jet 36 Is disposed at a location closer to the bolts 29 than the bolt 28 (i.e., dt a location farther from the exhaust camshaft 13), the size of the lower camshaft holder 25 is increased by a value corresponding to the space for the oil jet 36. On the other hand, if the oil jet 36 is disposed at a location displaced from the bolt 28 toward the exhaust camshaft 13, It is necessary to define a mounting bore for the oil jet 36 at a location closer to the surface of the lower camshaft holder 25 supporting the exhaust camshaft 13 and for this reason, there is a possibility that the support rigidity of the exhaust camshaft 13 Is reduced. Further, the oil passage P12 is defined around the periphery of the bolt 28 to commijnicate with the oil Jet 36 and hence, an oil passageway for supplying oil to the oil jet 36 can he simplified in arrangement and shortened.<br>
The chain guide 41 includes a chain guide body 42 formed of a metal plate, and a slide member 43 made of a synthetic resin<br><br>
Is mounted on an upper surface of a tip end of the cliain guide body 42 to come into contact with the upper surface of the timing Chain 17 for sliding movement. The timing chain 17 can be guide by the slide member 43 with its deflection inhibited, whereby the occurrence of the wear of the timing chain 17 can be inhibited, and the resistance to the sliding movements of the chain guide 41 and the timing chain 17 can be reduced. A pair of skip-preventing plates 42a and 42b are integrally formed at lengthwise opposite ends of the chain guide body 42. One of the skip-preventing plates 42a covers the above of the zone of starting of the meshing between the Intake camshaft sprocket 15 and the timing chain 17 to prevent the skipping of the timing chain 17, and the other skip-preventing plate 42b covers the above of a zone of finishing of the meshing between the Intake camshaft sprocket 15 and the timing chain 17 to prevent the skipping of the timing chain 17. The rigidity of the chain guide 41 Is enhanced by the provision of the skip-preventing plates 42a and 42b and hence, the support rigidities of the intake camshaft 12 and the exhaust camshaft 13 are also further enhanced.<br>
Since the skip-preventing plates 42a and 42b are formed at opposite ends of the slide member 43 made of the synthetic resin and hence, the durability of the slide member 43 is enhanced, notwithstanding that the slide member 43 is made of the synthetic resin.<br>
The upper camshaft holder 26 includes a cam cap portion<br><br>
26a adapted to hold the Intake camshaft 12, a cam cap portion 26b adapted to hold the exhaust camshaft 13, and a connecting wall portion 26c, which connects the cam cap portions 26a and 26b to each other. A U-shaped lightening recess 26d is formed between the two bolts 28 and 29 and the connecting wall portion 26c, i.e., in a aiirface of the connecting wall portion 26c opposed to the chain guide 4l. The cam cap pqrtions 26a and 26b are connected at their lower ends to each other by the connecting wall portion 26c and also at their upper ends to each other by the chain guide 41, Namely, the chain guide 41 is bridged over the recess 26d f onned between the cam cap portions 26a and 26b and the connecting wall portion 26c and hence, it is possible to couple the cam cap portions 26a and 26b by the connecting wall portion 26c and the chain guide 41, while lightening the upper camshaft holder 26, thereby ensuring a sufficient rigidity and enhancing the support rigidity of the intake camshaft 12 and the exhaust camshaft 13.<br>
As described above, the chain guide 41 is fastened utilizing two 28 and 29 of the four bolts 27 to 30 for fastening the lower camshaft holder 25 and the upper camshaft holder 26 to the cylinder head 23 and hence, the number of parts is reduced and moreover, the mounting rigidity of the chain guide 41 is enhanced. In addition, the level of the seat faces of the two inner bolts 28 and 29 for fixing the chain guide 41 is restrained to the level of the timing chain 17, but the level of the seat faces of the two outer bolts which do not contribute to the fixing<br><br>
of tha chain guide 41 can be lowered without being restrained to the level of the timing chain 17, Thus, the opposite ends of the upper camshaft holder 26 can be disposed at a level lower than the seat faces of the bolts 28 and 29 tc reduce the size of the head cover 31.<br>
Returning to Fig. 4, a filter housing 45 of an oil filter F Is fixed to a side of the cylinder head 23 buy bolts 44, 44. An oil passage P14 diverted from the oil passage PI in the cylinder head 23 extends in a direction away from the first valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism VI and via a filter element 46 within the filter housing 45 and an oil passage P15 to communicate with an oil passage P16 in the cylinder head 23. The oil passage P16 communicates with the second valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism V2 accommodated in the cylinder head 23 (in an end wall of the cylinder head 23 on the side of the timing chain 17, and a second hydraulic pressure control valve 47 conmunlcates with an outer periphery of the intake camshaft 12 through oil passages P17a and P17b defined in the cylinder head 23 and oil passages P18a and Pl8b defined in the lower camshaft holder 25.<br>
As can be seen from Pig. 14, the filter housing 45 of the oil filter F is a flat dish-shaped member and Is fixed to the cylinder head 23 by the two bolts 44, 44 passed through bolt bores 45a and 45b made in vertically opposite ends of the housing 45. Since the filter housing 45 is formed of the flat member, the filter housing 45 is easy to form, as compared with a usual<br><br>
cylindrical filter housing and moreover, is compact. An oil passed from the oil passage P14 in the cylinder head 23 through the filter element 46 to enter an inlet chamber 45c within the filter housing 45 flows via an outlet chamber 45d within the filter housing 45 into the oil passage P16. The inlet chamber 45c and the outlet chamber 45d are sealed by a common twin ring-shaped seal member 110 and hence, the number of parts can be reduced, as compared with a case where the inlet chamber 45c and the outlet chamber 45d are sealed by separate seal members<br>
110, respectively.<br>
filter A mounted portion of the oil      F protrudes from the<br>
side of the cylinder head 23, and a protruding portion is of<br>
a box-shape, as is the seal member 110, This can contribute<br>
to an enhancement in rigidity of the cylinder head 23. A chain<br>
guide 114 is fixed to the mounted portion of the oil filter F<br>
by a bolt 115 (see Fig.2) and hence, the mounting rigidity of<br>
the chain guide 114 is enhanced. Further, a portion of the chain<br>
guide 111 fastened by the bolt 112 is disposed at the mounted<br>
portion of the oil filter F and hence, the fastened rigidity<br>
of the chain guide 111 is enhanced.<br>
The outlet chamber 45d is provided in an upper portion<br>
of the filter housing 45 closer to the second oil pressure<br>
control valve 47 and hence, the oil passage P16 connecting the<br>
oil filter F to the second oil pressure control valve 47 can<br>
be shortened. Moreover, the outlet chamber 45d is provided at<br>
a location closer to the upper bolt bore 45a in the filter housing<br><br>
45. Therefore, the fastening force of the upper bolt 44 passed through the bolt bars 45a can be effectively applied to a portion in the vicinity of the outlet chamber 45d and thus, a sufficient sealing force can be generated by a smaller number of the bolts 44. Moreover, the filter housing 45 Is mounted to close the oil passages P14 and P16 which open into an end face of the cylinder head 23 and hence, it is unnecessary to close the oil passages P14 and P16 by a blind plug, leading to a reduction in number of parts.<br>
As shown in Figs. 3 and 13, a chain cover 111 is fixed to the cylinder head 23 by a bolt 112 to cover a front surface of the timing chain 17, and the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 and the oil filter F are mounted to a left side (one side) and a right side (the other side) of the cylinder head 23 at locations displaced from the chain cover 111, respectively. Because the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 and the oil filter F are mounted at the locations displaced from the chain cover 111, as described above, they can be removed while the chain cover ill is mounted, leading to an enhanced maintenance. Moreover, there is not a possibility that the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 and the oil filter F interfere with each other, and there is also not a possibility that the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 and the oil filter F interfere with the timing chain 17, because they are mounted outside a loop of the timing chain 17. Therefore, a sufficient space for mounting the oil filter F is secured.<br><br>
thereby making it possible to Increase the size of the oil filter to enhance the filtering performance. , In addition, It is unnecessary to maJce an opening In the chain cover 111 for performing the maintenance of the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 and the oil filter F and hence, the structure of the chain cover ail is simplified. Further, the oil filter F is mounted on the same side as the side on which the second valve-operating characteristic changing meclianism V2 Is mounted, i.e., on the right side of the cylinder head 23 closer to the intake camshaft 12 and hence, the length of the oil passage between the oil filter F and the second valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism V2 can be suppressed to the minimum.<br>
An annular mounting seat 23b, on which the second hydraulic pressure control valve 47 is mounted by a bolt 113, is formed on an end face of the cylinder head 23 sandwiclied between the mounted portion of the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 and the mounted portion of the oil filter F. The mounting seat 23b is connected to the mounted portion of the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 and the mounted portion of the oil filter F by reinforcing ribs 23c and 23d, respectively. The rigidity of the cylinder head 23 is enhanced by the ribs 23c and 23d. Moreover, since the mounting seat 23b for the hydraulic pressure control valve 47 in the second valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism V2 is provided on the end face of the cylinder head 23 sandwiched<br><br>
between the mounted portion of the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 for the first valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism V 1 and the mounted portion of the oil filter F. it is possible to prevent the hydraulic pressure control valve 47 for the second valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism V2 from interfering with the hydraulic pressure control valve 34 for the first valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism V 1 and the oil filter P, thereby providing the further compactness of the engine E.<br>
The structiire of the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 will be described below with reference to Fig.5.<br>
The first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 mounted on the side of the cylinder head 23 includes a valve bore 51a defined in the valve housing 51. Opposite ends of an oil passage P3 extending through a lower portion of the valve bore 51a communicate with the oil passage P2 and an oil passage P4, respectively, and opposite ends of an oil passage P5 extending through an intermediate portion of the valve bore 51a communicate with the oil passages P9 and P4, respectively. An upper portion of the valve bore 51a communicates with the oil passage P6 through a dtain port 51b. A filter 52 is mounted in an inlet of the oil passage P3. Defined in a spool 53 accommodated in the valve bore 51a are a pair of lands 53a and 53b, a groove 53c between the lands 53a and 53b, an internal bore 53d extending axlaily, an orifice 53e extending through an upper end of the internal bore 53d, and a groove 53f perTsitting<br><br>
the internal bore 53a to communicate with the drain port Sib.<br>
r<br>
The spool 53 Is biased upwards by a spring 54 accommodated in a lower end of the internal bore 53d to abut against a cap 55 which closes an upper end of the valve bore 51a. The oil passages P4 and P5 communicate with each other through the orifice 51c. The oil passage P4 and an oil passage PS are connected to and disconnected from each other by an ON/OPF solenoid 56.<br>
The structure of the first valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism VI will be described below with reference to Fig.9.<br>
The first valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism VI adapted to drive the intake valves 18, 18 includes first and second low-speed rocker arms 57 and 58 plvotally supported on the intake rocker arm shaft 32 for swinging movement, and a high-speed rocker arm 59 mounted between the low-speed rocker arms 57 and 58. Sleeves 60, 61 and 62 are press-fitted into intermediate portions of the rocker arms 57, 58 and 59, respectively. A roller 63 rotatably carried on the sleeve 60 abuts against a low-speed intake cam 64 provided on the Intake camshaft 12 j a roller 65 rotatably carried on the sleeve 61 abuts against a high-speed intake cam 66 provided on the intake camshaft 12; and a roller 67 rotatably carried on the sleeve 62 abuts against a low-speed Intake cam 68 provided on the Intake camshaft 12. The height of the lobe of the high-speed cam 66 is set larger than those of the lobes of a<br><br>
pair of the low-speea intake cams having the same profile-<br>
A first switching pin 69, a second switching pin 70 and a third switching pin 71 are slidably supported within the three sleeves 60, 61 and 62, respectively. The first switching pin 69 Is biased toward the second switching pin 70 by a spring 73 disposed in a compressed state between the first switching pin 69 and a spring seat 72 fixed to the sleeve 60, and is stopped at a location where it abuts against a clip 74 fixed to the sleeve 60. At this time, abutment faces of the first and second switching pins 69 and 70 are located between the first low-speed rocker arm 57 and the high-speed rocker arm 59, and abutment faces of the second and third switching pins 70 and 71 are located between the high-speed rocker arm 59 and the second low-speed rocker arm 58. An oil camber 58a defined in the second low-speed rocker arm 58 communicates with an oil passage 32a defined in the intake rocker arm shaft 32.<br>
When no hydraulic pressure is applied to the oil passage 32a in the intake rocker arm shaft 32, the first, second and third switching pins 69, 70 and 71 are in positions shown in Fig.9, and the first and second low-speed rocker arms 57 and 58 and the high-speed rocker arm 59 are freely swingable. Therefore, the pair of Intake valves 16, 18 are driven with a low valve lift by the first and second low-speed rocker arms 57 and 58, respectively. At this time, the high-speed rocker arm 59 disconnected from the first and second low-speed rocker arms 57 and 58 is raced independently of the pair of intake valves<br><br>
When a hydraulic pressure is applied to the oil camber 58a from the oil passage 32a In the IntaKe rocker arm shaft 32, the first, second and third switching pins 69. 70 and 71 are moved against the force of the spring 73, whereby the first and second low-speed rocker arms 57 and 58 and the high-speed rocker arm 59 are integrally connected together. As a result, the first and second low-speed rocker arms 57 and 58 and the high-speed rocker arm 59 are driven in unison by the high-speed Intake cam 66 having the higher lobe, and the pair of intake valves 18, 18 connected to the first and second low-speed rocker arms 57 and 58 are driven with a higher valve lift. At this time, the air of low-seed Intake cams 64 and 68 are separated from the first and second low-speed rocker arms 5 7 and 58 and raced.<br>
The structure of the second hydraulic pressure control valve 47 will be described below with reference to Fig. 10.<br>
Five ports 82, 83, 84, 85 and 86 are defined in a cylindrical valve housing 81 fitted in the valve bore 23a made in the cylinder head 23. The central port 84 communicates with an oil passage P16; the ports 83 and 85 on opposite sides of the central port 84 communlaate with a pair of oil passages P17a and Pl7b, respectively, and the ports 82 and 86 on opposite sides of ths central port 84 communicate with a pair of draining oil passages P15a and Pl9b, respectively. A spool 90 having three grooves 87, 88 and 89 defined in its outer periphery is slldably<br><br>
received in the valve housing 81 and biased by a resilient force of a spring 91 mounted at one end of the spool 90 toward a linear solenoid 92 mounted at the othex end of the spool 90.<br>
When the spool 90 Is in a neutral position shown In Fig. lo, all the oil passages P16, P17a and P17b are closed. When the spool 90 is movea leftwards from the neutral position by the duty-controllsd linear solenoid 92, the oil passage P16 is brought into communication with the oil passage P17a through the port 84, the groove 88 and the port 83, and the oil passage P17b is brought into communication with the oil passage P19b through the port 85, the groove 89 and the port 86. When the spool 90 is moved rightwards from the neutral position by the duty-controlled linear solenoid 92, the oil passage P16 is brought into communication with the oil passage P17b through the port 84, the groove 88 and the port 85, and the oil passage P17a is brought Into communication with the oil passage P19a through the port 83, the groove 87 and the port 82.<br>
The structure of the second valve^operatlng characteristic changing mechanism V2 will be described below with reference to Figs.11 and 12.<br>
The second valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism V2 includes aji outer rotor 93, and an inner rotor 96 fixed to the intake camshaft 12 by a pin 94 and bolts 95. The outer rotor 93 includes a cup-ahaped housing 97, on an outer periphery of which the intake camshaft sprocket 15 is integrally formed, an outer rotor body 98 fitted Into the housing 97, and<br><br>
an annular cover plate 99  which covers an opening in the housing<br>
97.	The housing 97 , the outer rotor body 96 ana the cover plate<br>
99 eire Integrally coupled to one another* A support bore g7a<br>
Is made in the center of the housing 97, so that the outer rotor<br>
93 is relatively rotatably supported on the intake camshaft 12<br>
by fitting of the support bore 97a over an outer periphery of<br>
the intaXe camshaft 12.<br>
Four recesses 98a and four projections 9ab are formed alternately around an inner periphery of the outer rotor body<br>
98,	and four vanes 96a radiately formed around an outer<br>
periphery of the inner rotor 96 are fitted into the four recesses<br>
98a, respectively. Seal members 101 are mounted at tip ends<br>
of the projections 98b of the outer rotor body 98 to abut against<br>
the inner rotor 96, and seal members 102 are mounted at tip ends<br>
of the vanes 96a of the inner rotor 96 to abut against the outer<br>
rotor body 98, whereby four advance chambers 103 and four delay<br>
chambers 104 are demarcated between the outer rotor body 96 and<br>
the inner rotor 96.<br>
A stopper pin 105 is slidably supported in a pinhole 96b provided In the inner rotor 96, and an arcuate elongated groove 97b is provided in the housing 9? of the outer rotor 93, so that a tip end of the stopper pin 105 can be brought Into engagement in the elongated groove 97b. The stopper pin 105 is biased in a direction away from the elongated groove 97b by a spring 106, and an oil chamber 107 is defined behind the stopper pin lOS. When the stopper pin 105 is in a state in which it has li&amp;en moved<br><br>
away from the elongated groove 97b by a pepulsing foreÂ© of a spring 106, the outer rotor 93 and the Inner rotos 96 can be<br>
rotated relative to each other within an angle ci (e.g., 30") until each of the vanes 96a of the inner rotor 96 is moved from one end of each recess 98a In the outer rotor 93 to reach to the other end of the recess 98a. When a hydraulic pressure is supplied to the oil chamber 107 to bring the stopper ptn 105 into engagement in the elongated groove 97b, the outer rotor 93 and the inner rotor 96 can be rotated relative to each other within an angle p (e.g., 20Â°) until the stopper pin 105 is moved from one end of the elongated groove 97b to reach the other end of the elongated groove 97b,<br>
The pairs of oil passages P18a, P18b defined in the lower camshaft holder 25 communicate with the advance chambers 103 and the delay chambers 104 through a pair of oil passages 12a and 12b defined In the intake camshaft 12 and oil passages 96c and 96d defined in the inner rotor 96, respectively. Therefore, when a hydraulic pressure is supplied to the advance chambers 103 through the second hydraulic pressure control valve 47, the low-speed intake cams 64 and 68 and the high-speed Intake cam 56 are advanced relative to the intake camshaft 12 to hasten the timing of the intake valves 18, 16- When a hydraulic pressure is supplied to the delay chambers 104 through the second hydraulic pressure control valve 47, the low-speed Intake cams 64 and 68 and the high-speed intake cam 66 are delayed<br><br>
to retard the timing the intake valves 18, 18.<br>
An oil paseage P20 is defined in the second lower camshaft holder 25 as viewed from the side of the second valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism V2 to communicate with the oil passage P13 (see Fig, 4) â¢ The oil passage P20 communicates with the oil chamber 107 facing a head of the stopper pin 105 through an oil passage 12c defined in the intake camshaft 12 and oil passages 95a and 95h defined in the bolt 95.<br>
In the present embodiment, no valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism is mounted on the exhaust camshaft 13, and the exhaust valves 19, 19 are driven with a jnedlum valve lift, In other words, the valve lift of the exhaust valves 19. 19 is medium between a valve lift (a smaller lift) provided when the intake valves 18, IS are moved at a lower speed and a valve lift (a larger lift) provided when the intake valves 18, 18 are moved at a higher speed.<br>
The operation of the embodiment having the above-described arrangement will be described below.<br>
During rotation of the engine E at a lower speed, the solenoid 56 of the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 is in its turned-of f state and hence, the communication between the oil passages P4 and P8 is cut off, and the spool 53 is in its lifted position shown in Pig.5 under the action of the repulsing force of the spring 54. In this state, the oil pump communicates with the oil chamber In the first valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism VI via the oil passages PI<br><br>
and P2 in ths cylinder head 23, the oil passages P3 and P4, the orifice 53c and the oil passage P5 in the valve housing 51. the oil passages F9 and PIO in the cylinder head 23. the oil passages Pll and P13 in the lower camshaft holder 25 and the oil passage 32a in the intaJce rocker arm shaft 32. At this time, the hydraulic pressure trananiitted to the oil chainber 58a in the first valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism VI is brought into a lower pressure by the action of the orifice 53c in the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34. Therefore, the first, second and third switching pins 69, 70 and 71 are retained in the positions shown in Fig. 9, and the pair of intake valves 16, 18 are driven with the lower valve lift, and a valve operating system (including a rocker arm support portion, a camshaft support portion and the like) can be lubricated by the oil having the lower pressure.<br>
When the hydraulic pressure output from the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 is lower, as described above, the hydraulic pressure transmitted to the oil chamber 107 In the second valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism V2 through the oil passage P20 in the lower camshaft holder 25 and the oil passage 12c in the Intake camshaft 12 shown in Fig. 11 is also brought into a lower pressure, and the stopper pin 105 is moved away from the elongated groove 97 by the repulsing force of the spring 106. When the duty ratio oÂ£ the second hydraulic pressure control valve 47 (see Pig.10) connected to the oil pump through the oil passages PI and P14 in the cylinder head 23,<br><br><br>
P16 m the cylinder bead 23 is controIOjsd, a difference le generated between the hydraulic pressures transmitted to the advance chambers 103 and the delay chambers 104 In the second valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism V2 through the pair of oil passages P17a and Pl7b. As a result, the phase of the inner rotor 96 relative to the outer rotor 93 can be changed within the angle a (see Fig.12), thereby controlling the valve timing of the intake valves 18, 18.<br>
During the rotation of the engine at the lower speed described above, the oil passed through the orifice 53c In the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 to have a reduced pressure (i.e. , the relieved oil) flows via the oil passage P5, the groove 53c in the spool 53, the drain port 51b, the oil passage P6 in the cylinder head 23 and the oil passage P7 in the bulge 25a of the lower camshaft holder 25 and through the oil drain port 25b to the zone of starting of the meshing of the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 and the timing chain 17 (or a meshed zone between the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 and the timing chain 17), thereby lubricating the tlinlng chain 17 (see Fig. 7). During the rotation of the engine at the lower speed, the rotational speed of the timing chain 17 is also smaller and hence, the oil deposited to the timing chain 17 is scattered in a reduced amount by a centrifugal force. Therefore, if the oil is supplied to the zone of starting of the meshing of the<br><br>
 exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 and the timing chain 17 on the delayed side in a direction of rotation of the timing chain 17, the meshed zone between the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 and the timing chain 17 on the advanced side in the direction of rotation of the timing chain 17 can be also lubricated sufficiently, because the engine E Is in a state in which it is being rotated at the lower speed, and the load.of the timing chain 17 is smaller.<br>
The relived oil from the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 is permitted to flow out of the oil drain port 25b to lubricate the timing chain 17, as described above, and hence, an oil jet and a space for mounting of the oil jet are not required. Moreover, the oil passage P7 leading to the oil drain port 25b is defined in the mating surfaces of the cylinder head 23 and the lower camshaft holder 25 and hence, the arrangement of the oil passage P7 is simplified. In addition, the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 is mounted to a sldewall of the cylinder head 23 closer to the oil drain port Z5b and hence, as compared with a case where the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 is mounted to a sidewall of the cylinder head 23 farther from the oil drain port 25b, the length of the oil passage P7 for the relieved oil can be reduced, and the mounting rigidity of the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 is also increased.<br>
Further, the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 and the oil passage P7 for the relieved oil defined in the mating<br><br>
surfaces of the cylinder hsad 23 and the lower camshaft holder 25 are disposed on the same plane perpendicular to the camshafts 12 and 13 and hence, the lengths of the oil passages P6 and P7 from the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 to the oil drain port 25b can be further reduced.<br>
When the solenoid 56 of the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 is brought into the turned-on state during rotation of the engine E at a higher speed to permit the communication between the oil passages P4 and P8, vhereby the spool 53 is moved downwards by the hydraulic pressure applied to the land 53b, as shown in Fig. 6, the oil passages P3 and P5 axe brought into communication with each other through the groove 53c. As a result, the higher hydraulic pressure is transmitted via the oil passages P9 and PIO in the cylinder head 23, the oil passages Pll and Pl3 in the lower camshaft holder 25 and the oil passage 32a in the intake rocker arm shaft 32 to the oil chamber 58a in the first valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism VI to move the first, second and third switching pins 69, 70 and 71 against the repulsing force of the spring 73, whereby the pair of Intake valves 16, 18 are driven with a higher valve lift.<br>
when the hydraulic pressure output from the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 Is higher as described above, the hydraulic pressure traiismitted through the oil passage P21 In the lower camshaft bolder 25 and the oil passage 12c In the Intake camshaft 12 show in Pig. 11 to the oil chamber 107 in the<br><br>
second valve-operating characteristic cbanging mechanism V2 Is eilso brought into a higher pressure, whereby the stopper pin 105 is brought into engagement in the elongated groove 97b against the repulsing force of the spring 106. Therefore, a difference can be generated between the hydraulic pressures transmitted to the advance chambers 103 and the delay chambers 104 in the second valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism V2 through the pair of oil passages P17a and Pi7b by controlling the duty ratio of the second hydraulic pressure control valve 47 connected to the oil pump through the oil passages PI and P14 in the cylinder head 23, the oil passage F15 In the filter housing 45 and the oil passage P16 in the cylinder head 23, whereby the phase of the inner rotor 96 relative to the outer rotor 93 can be changed within the angle P (see Fig. 12) to control the valve timing of the intake valves 18. IS.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, the higher-pressure oil supplied to the oil passage F12 defined around the outer periphery of the bolt 28 forces the relief valve 40 in the mounting bolt 39 of the oil jet 36 open, and spouts out of the nozzle bore 37a in the oil Jet body 37 to lubricate the zone of starting oÂ£ the meshing (or the meshed zone) of the intafce camshaft sprocket 15 and the timing chain 17 , Referring to Fig. 6, the oil supplied to the oil passage P6 in the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 flows via the orifice 53e, the internal bore 53d and<br><br>
the groove 53f In the spool 53, the drain port 51b in the valve housing 51, the oil passage P6 in the cylinder head 23 and the oil passage P7 in the bulge 2Sa of the lower camshaft holder 25 and through the oil drain port 25b to the zone of starting of the meshing (or the meshed zone) of the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 and the timing chain 17 to lubricate the timing chain 17 (see Fig.7).<br>
In this way, during the rotation of the engine E at the lower speed in which the load of the timing chain 17 is reduced, only the zone of starting of the meshing of the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 and the timing chain 17 is lubricated. During the rotation of the engine E at the higher speed in which the load of the timing chain 17 is increased, the zone of starting of the meshing of the Intake camshaft sprocket 15 and the timing chain 17 is lubricated concentratedly by the oil from the oil Jet 36 and at the same time, the zone of starting of the meshing of the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 and the timing chain 17 is lubricated subsidiarily by the relived oil from the oil drain port 25b. Therefore, it is possible to lubricate the timing chain 17 optimally in accordance with the operational state of the engine E to enhance the durability thereof.<br>
In other words, the operations of the oil drain port 25b and the oil Jet 36 which are a plurality of oil supply means for supplying the oil to the timing chain 17 are changed in accordance with the operational state of the engine E and hence, it is possible to carry out the lubrication of the timing chain<br><br>
17 In accordance with the operational state of the engine E to reduce the wear of the timing chain 17. Moreover, the number of the oil supply means operated is increasefl with an Increase in rotational speed of the engine E and hence. It is possible to Increase the number of portions to be lubricated with an increase in load to further effectively reduce the wear of the timing chain 17.<br>
Particularly, during the rotation of the engine E at the lower speed in which the valve lift (the medium valve lift) of the exhaust valves 19, 19 is larger than the valve lift (the smaller valve lift) of the intake valves 18, 18, a relatively large amount of the oil is supplied to the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16 having a load larger than that of the intake camshaft sprocket 15. During the rotation of the engine E at the higher speed in which the valve lift (the larger valve lift) of the intake valves 18, 18 is larger than the valve lift (the medium valve lift} of the eschaust valves 19, 19, a relatively large amount of the oil is supplied to the Intake camshaft sprocket 15 having a load larger than that of the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16, and a smaller amount of the oil is also supplied to the exhaust camshaft sprocket 16. Thus, it is possible to ensure an optimal amount of the oil in accordance with the operational state of the engine E.<br>
Namely, the valve operating control system includes the first valve-operating characteristic changing mechanism VI adapted to change the magnitude relationship between the lift<br><br>
amount of the intake valves 18, IS and the lift amount of the exhaust valves 19, 19 In accordance with the operational state of the engine E, so that the amount of oil supplied to the meshed zone between the sprocket for driving the valve in the larger lift amount and the timing chain is larger than the amount of oil supplied to the meshed zone between the sprocket for driving the valve In the smaller lift amount and the timing chain 17. Therefore, it is possible to supply a larger amount of the oil to the sprocket having a larger valve-operating load to extend the life of the timing chain 17. Moreover, the valve operating control system includes the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 adapted to change the lower-speed valve lift provided when the rotational speed of the engine is lower than a predetermined value and the higher-speed valve lift provided when the rotational speed of the engine is higher than the predetermined value from one to the other, so that the lower-speed valve lift is established by the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 during rotation of the engine E at the lower speed, and the higher-speed valve lift is established by the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 during rotation of the engine E at the higher speed, whereby the timing chain 17 Is lubricated by the lower-pressure relived oil from the first hydraulic pressure control valve 34 at the lower-speed valve lift, and the timing chain 17 is lubricated by the higher-pressure valve-lift controlling oil from the first hydraialic pressure control valve 34 at the higher-speed valve<br><br>
lift. Therefore, an appropriate amount of the oil in accordance with the loaded state at that time can be supplied to effectively prevent the wear of the timing chain 17.<br>
