Alternatively, the product can be obtained by reacting trans-4-isopropylcyclohexane carbonyl chloride with D-phenylalanine methylester HCl in halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane in presence of base such as triethylamine, pyridine at a temperature between -10°C to 90° C followed by base hydrolysis.<br><br>
According to a still further aspect of the present invention, the new crystal from 'C" of N-(trans-4-isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl)-D-phenylalanine thus produced have at least one, and preferably all, of the following properties:<br>
