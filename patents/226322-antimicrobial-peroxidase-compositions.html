ANTIMICROBIAL PEROXIDASE COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to an enzymatic composition capable of killing or inhibiting microbial cells or microorganisms/ more specifically microbial cells or microorganisms present in laundry, on hard surface, on skin, teeth or mucous membranes; and for preserving food products, cosmetics, paints, coatings, etc., the composition comprising a peroxidase enzyme and an enhancing agent acting as door. <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various enzymatic antimicrobial compositions are known in the art. For instance, WO 94/04127 discloses stabilized dentifrice compositions which are capable of producing antimicrobially effective concentrations of hypothiocyanite ions. The compositions contain an oxidoreductase capable of producing hydrogen peroxide and a peroxidase enzyme capable bf  oxidizing thiocyanate ions, which are normally present in saliva, to antimicrobial hypothiocyanite ions. Suitable peroxidases include lactoperoxidase, myeloperoxidase, salivary peroxidase and chloroperoxidase*<br>
En EP-A-G 500 387 enzymatic antimicrobial compositions are iisclosed comprising a haloperoxidase, e.g. myeloperoxidase, eosinophil oxidase, lactoperoxidase and zhloroperoxidase, which selectively binds to and inhibits :he growth of target microorganisms in the presence of peroxide and halide.<br>
70 95/27046 discloses an antimicrobial composition ;omprising a Vanadium chloroperoxidase, halide ions, and lydrogen peroxide or a hydrogen peroxide-generating agent.<br><br>
The object of the invention is to provide a composition for killing or inhibiting microbial cells, i.e. for disinfection or preservation,  which is easy to use and an effective alternative to the known disinfecting and preserving composition and methods.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE <br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the combined action of a peroxidase enzyme from the fungus Coprinus  and an enhancing agent acting as electron-donor/ when applied to e.g. a hard surface, skin, mucous membranes, oral cavity, hair, or laundry in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, results in a hitherto unknown synergistic antimicrobial effectâ€ž<br>
Thus, based on these findings the present invention provides, in a first aspect, an enzymatic antimicrobial composition comprising or consisting essentially of a peroxidase obtainable from or produced by the fungus CoprinuSi   an enhancing agent, and hydrogen peroxide or a Sourca of hydrogen peroxide .<br>
The composition of the invention is useful as antimicrobial ingredient wherever such an ingredient is needed, for example for the preservation of food, beverages, cosmetics/ deodorants, contact iens products, food ingredients or eneyme compositions; as a disinfectant for use e.g. on human or animal skin, hair, oral cavity, mucous membranes/ vounds, bruises or in the eye; for killing microbial ceils In laundry; and for incorporation in cleaning compositions or disinfectants for hard surface cleaning or disinfection*<br>
accordingly, in further aspects, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting microorganisms present in Jaundry, wherein the laundry is treated with a soaking, cashing or rinsing liquor comprising this composition; a<br><br>
method of inhibiting microbial growth on a hard surface, wherein the surface is contacted with this composition; and a method of killing microbial cells present on human or animal skin, mucous membranes, teeth, wounds, bruises or in the eye or inhibiting the growth thereof, wherein the cells to be killed or inhibited or the skin, mucous membrane, teeth, wound or bruise are/is contacted with this composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The term "microbial cells" denotes bacterial or fungal cells, and the term "microorganism" denotes a fungus, a <br>
The term "hard surface" as used herein relates to any surface which is essentially non-permeable for microorganisms- Examples of hard surfaces are surfaces made from metal, e.g. stainless steel, plastics, rubber, board, glass, wood, paper, textile, concrete, rock, marble, gypsum and ceramic materials which optionally may be coated, e*g* with paint, enamel and the like. The hard surface can also be a process equipment member of a cooling cower, a water treatment plant, a dairy, a food processing plant, a chemical or pharmaceutical process plant. Accordingly, the composition according to the present invention is useful in a conventional cleaning-in-piace (C-I-P) system.<br>
In the present context, the term "bactericidal" is to be understood as capable of killing bacterial cells.<br>
In the present context, the term "bacteriostatic" is to be understood as capable of inhibiting bacterial growth, i.e.<br>
inhibiting growing baeterial cells. <br>
In the present context, the term "fungicidal" is to be understood as capable of killing fungal cells.<br><br>
In the present context, the term "fungistatic" is to be understood as capable of inhibiting fungal growth, i.e. inhibiting growing fungnl cells.<br>
Without being bound to this theory, it is believed that the key reaction in the antimicrobial effect of the combined peroxidase/enhancing agent system of the present invention is the oxidation of essential protein and enzyme sulphydryl groups.<br>
The peroxidase enzyme is able to catalyse H202-dependent oxidation of an electron-donor, e.g halxde ions or the thiocyanate ion (SCN", a pseudohalide) to yield halogens or other oxidising agents The oxidising agents make an electrophilic attack on microbial components resulting in chemical modification of essential enzymes, transport systems, and other functional components Sulfhydryl groups are especially susceptible to electrophilic attack, and are usually present in higher amounts than other easily oxidised groups- Aromatic amino acid residues are also susceptible to attack. Most aspects of antimicrobial action can be correlated with chemical modification of these nucleophilic components. Antimicrobial activity is favoured by influences that increase the stability of the oxidising agent, provided that these influences do not interfere with their electrophilic character, or their ability to penetrate microbial membranes. Although H202 itself is a powerful oxidising agent, the H202 molecule is stabilised and reacts slowly with biological materials. Also, most cells have enzymes that rapidly eliminate H202- Peroxidase-oatalysed oxidation of e.g. halides or SCN* conserves the oxidising power of H202  in forms that react more rapidly, and for which the target cells may have no defense. (Thomas, E.L. in "The Lactoperoxidase System"- Ed. By Pruitt, K.M., and Tenovuo, J.O,, New York, 1985).<br><br>
The reaction catalysed by peroxidase can be written as<br><br>
The hydrogen peroxide may be generated by an oxidoreductase enzyme and a substrate specific to that enzyme, in particular by those oxidoreductases which utilise water as a co-reactant and oxygen as an electron donor. Suitable oxidoreductases include glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, glycollate oxidase, lactate oxidase, L-gulunolactone oxidase, L-2-hydroxyacid oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, xanthine oxidase, D-aspartate oxidase, L-amino acid oxidase, D-amino acid oxidase, monoamine oxidase, pyridoxaminephosphate oxidase, diamine oxidase, and sulfite oxidase. Glucose oxidase is most preferred. Suitable substrates are specific to the particular oxidoreductases chosen and are well known to the skilled person* For example, beta-D-^glucose is a specific substrate for glucose oxidase. Other suitable substrates include, but are not limited to D-glucose, D-galactose, L-sorbose, ethanol, tyramine, 1,4-diaminobutane, 2-aminophenol, glycollate, L-lactate, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, L-gulunolactone, L-galaconolactone, D-mannonolactone, L-2-hydroxyisocaproate, acetaldehyde, butyraldehyde, xanthine, D-aspatate, D-glutamate, L-amino acids and D-amino acids.<br>
It may be advantageous to use enzymatically generated hydrogen peroxide, since this source results in a relatively low concentration of hydrogen peroxide under the biologically relevant conditions. Low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide result in an increase in the rate of<br><br>
peroxidase-catalysed rea-rr.Lor..<br>
The hydrogen peroxide can also be added to the composition per se  or can be generated by perborate or percarbonate<br>
salts, preferably sodium percarbonate or sodium perborate.<br>
The enzyme<br>
The peroxidase employed in the method of the invention is preferably producible by plants (e*g* horseradish or soybean peroxidase) or microorganisms such as fungi or bacteria, more preferably by fungi including strains belonging to the subdivision Basidiomycotina, class Basidiomycetes, especially the genus Coprinus,   in particular Coprinus  ciner&amp;us  f. microsporvs   (IFO 8371), or Coprlnux  m&amp;crorkizus.<br>
The peroxidase enzyme to be used in the method of the invention may be a monocomponent (recombinant) enzyme; i.e. enzymes essentially free from other proteins or enzyme proteins. A recombinant enzyme may be cloned and expressed according to standard techniques conventional to the skilled person. However, the enzyme may also be used in the form of an enzyme preparation optionally enriched in an enzyme exhibiting the desired enzyme activity as the major enzymatic component, e.g. a mono-component enzyme preparation.<br>
Particularly, a recombinantly produced peroxidase is a peroxidase derived from a Coprip.us  sp-, in particular C. macrorhizus  or C. cinereus  according to WO 92/16634/ or a variant thereof, e.g., a variant as described in WO 94/12621. Accordingly, a useful recombinant peroxidase may be produced by using a DNA construct comprising the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID No. 1 encoding a Coprinus  sp. peroxidase^ or a suitable modification thereof.<br><br>
Examples of suitable modifications of the DNA sequence are nucleotide substitutions which do not give rise to another amino acid sequence of the peroxidase, but which correspond to the codon usage of the host organism, into which the DNA construct is introduced or nucleotide substitutions which do give rise to a different amino acid sequence and therefore, possibly, a different protein structure which might give rise to a peroxidase mutant with different properties than the native enzyme.  Other examples of possible modifications are insertion of one or more nucleotides into the sequence, addition of one or more nucleotides at either end of the sequence, or deletion of one or more nucleotides at either end or within the sequence.<br>
The DNA construct encoding the peroxidase may be prepared synthetically by established standard methods, e.g. the phosphoamidite method described by S.L. Beaucage and M.H. Caruthers, Tetrahedron Letters 22, 1981, pp. 1859-1869, or the method described by Matthes et al., EMB0_Jqurnal_3/ 1984, pp. 801-805, According to the phosphoamidite method, oligonucleotides are synthesized, e.g. in an automatic DNA synthesizer, purified, annealed, ligated and cloned in sui table vectors.<br>
The DNA construct may also be of genomic or cDNA origin, for instance obtained by preparing a genomic or cDNA library and screening for DNA sequences coding for all or<br>
i part of the peroxidase by hybridization using synthetic oligonucleotide probes in accordance with standard techniques (cf. Sambrook et al., MolecularCloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor, 1989) . in this case, a genomic or cDNA sequence encoding the peroxidase<br>
&gt; may be modified at a site corresponding to the site(s) at which it is desired to introduce amino acid substitutions, e.g. by site-directad mutagenesis using synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the desired amino acid sequence<br><br>
for homologous recombination in accordance with well-known procedures.<br>
Finally, the DNA construct may be of mixed synthetic and genomic/ mixed synthetic and cDNA or mixed genomic and cDNA origin prepared by licating fragments of synthetic/ genomic or cDNA origin (as appropriate)/ the fragments corresponding to various parts of the entire DNA construct, in accordance with standard techniques. The DMA construct may also be prepared by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers, for instance as described in US 4,683,202 or R.K. Saiki et al., Science 239, 1988, pp. 487-491,<br>
The DNA construct is normally inserted into a recombinant expression"vector. This may be any vector which may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell, into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication/ e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host ceil, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s), into which it has been integrated.<br>
In the vector, the DNA sequence encoding the peroxidase should be operably connected to a suitable promoter and terminator sequence, -he promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. Examples of suitable promoters are those indicated above. The procedures used to iigate the DNA sequences coding for the peroxidase, the promoter and the terminator, respectively, and to insert them into suitable vectors are well known to persons skilled in the art (cf-, for instance, Sambrook et a 1., oo_. a11) .<br><br>
A host cell is transformed with the expression vector* The host ceil is a cell of a filamentous fungus, and is preferably a cell of an Aspergillus  sp. as indicated above.<br>
The medium used to culture the transformed host cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing filamentous fungi. The transformants are usually stable and may be cultured in the absence of selection pressure. However/ if the transformants are found to be unstable, a selection marker introduced into the cells may be used for selection. If hemin or a heme-containing material (e.g. hemoglobin or red blood cells) is added to the medium, the yield of heme protein may be significantly increased.<br>
The mature heme protein secreted from the host cells may conveniently be recovered from the culture.medium by wellj known procedures including separating the cells from the medium by centnfugation or filtration, and precipitating proteinaceous components of the medium by means of a salt such as ammonium sulphate, followed by chromatographic procedures such as ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the 1ike.<br>
In the context of this invention, peroxidase acting compounds comprise peroxidase active fragments derived from cytochromes, haemoglobin or peroxidase enzymes, and synthetic or semisynthetic derivatives thereof, e.g. iron porphins, iron porphyrins, and iron phthalocyanine and derivatives thereof.<br>
Determination of peroxida 1 peroxidase unit (POXU) is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 |imol hydrogen peroxide per minute at the following analytical conditions: 0,88 mM hydrogen peroxide, 1,67 mM 2,2T-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate),<br>
0,1 M phosphate buffer/ pH 7,0, incubated at 30Â°C, photome-<br><br>
trically followed at 418 nm; molecular extinction coefficient <br>
The peroxidase enzyme may be present in the composition of â€¢ the invention corresponding to 0.01-100 POXU per ml' of ready-to-use liquid, i.e. of washing solution, disinfecting liquid, preserving liquid, foot bath etc.<br>
The enhancing agents<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the enhancing agent capable of acting as an electron-donor is a source of ionic iodide which may be enzvmatically converted to iodine when contacted with peroxidase enzyme in an aqueous solution for a time and under conditions sufficient to permiL the conversionâ€¢<br>
Iodine (ls) is widely used as a disinfectant, for many types of situations, for example as skin cleansers, for wound disinfection, contact lens cleaning and water sanitation, to mention a few. In addition, iodine is also useful in catalysts, as an animal feed additive, in pharmaceuticals, and as polymer precursor additives. Although the I2-based system of disinfection is extremely effective, several factors limit the scope of directly applying I2,  In particular, the storage, transportation and handling of I2  are extremely hazardous, due to the chemicals involved in production and also due to the toxicity of I, itself even in moderate concentrations. Generally, I2 is obtained from natural sources, such as brine, by processes that utilise strong inorganic acids, chlorine gas, and other hazardous chemicals, lodophores have been developed as l2  carriers to replace simple I3 solutions for industrial and domestic disinfection In addition, binary systems capable of generating 12 from an I" salt and a chemical oxidant are also available. Both these systems create the need for disposal of large,<br><br>
potentially toxic amounts of by-products. Another alternative to both industrially producing I2 on a large scale/ and to applying I2 as a disinfectant, has been found in the peroxidase-based generation of l2 (US 4,282,324; US 4,617,190/ US 4,583,536; US 4,937,072; US 5,055,287; US 5,227,161; US 5,169,455; US 4,996,146; US 4,576,817), Such methods involve the use of a peroxidase enzyme, the oxidising agent H2O2, and a source of ionic iodide, Unfortunately, this method has the disadvantage of requiring the hazardous and volatile peroxide or peracid, which has to be either transported or generated in $ita  by additional enzymatic or chemical steps, this making the system more complex anu/or costly.<br>
In the present context, a preferred source of ionic iodide is a water-soluble iodide salt such as an alkaline metal iodide salt, e.g. potassium iodide (KI), sodium iodide (Nal), or lithium iodide, ammonium iodide, calcium iodide. Sodium iodide and potassium iodide are preferred.<br>
Another preferred enhancing agent is a source of the thiocyanate ion (SCN~), eÂ«g&gt; sodium thiocyanate, potassium thiocyanate, ammonium thiocyanate, and other thiocyanate salts, preferably sodium thiocyanate and potassium thiocyanate.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Antibacterial activity of Copr-inus cinereus  recombinant peroxidase using different enhancing agents<br>
The antibacterial activity of Coprinus  cinerevs,   IFO 8371, recombinant peroxidase (rCIP) available from Novo Nordisk A/S, DK-2380 Bagsvaerd, Denmark, has been tested in a phosphate buffer with the following enhancing agents: sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN), potassium iodide (KI), 10-phenothiasine propionic acid (PPT), butyl syringate (BS) and 2, 2' azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) * The hydrogen peroxide was either generated by glucose oxidase or added directly in the concentration of 5 mM. In order to avoid interference with substrate components, the experiment was carried out in a buffer instead of in a growth substrate.<br>
P. fluorescens   (104 cfu/ml) was treated with rCIP (3 PQXU/ml) and the different enhancing agents (5 mM) for 15<br>
min (pH 6,0, 40Â°C) combined with glucoseoxidase/glucose or hydrogen peroxide, respectively.  The bactericidal activity was determined by plate counting and by incubation in Malthus.  The detection times measured by the Malthus instrument were converted to cfu/ml by a standard curve.<br>
Indirect Malthus measurements were used when enumerating total survival cells (Malthus Flexi M2060, Malthus Instrument Limited).  3 ml of growth medium was transferred to the outer chamber of the indirect Malthus cells, and 0.5 ml of sterile KOH (0,1 M) was transferred to the inner chamber.  The cell suspensions were after enzyme treatment transferred to the outer chamber of the Malthus cell. As cells are growing in the outer chamber they produce CG2 which will dissolve in the KOH in the inner chamber and thereby change the conductance of the KOH.  The amount of C02 formed by the respiring cells surviving the enzyme treatment was used for estimating the number of viable<br><br>
cells. When the conductance change is measurable by the Malthus, a detection time (dt) will be recorded. The dt's were converted to colony counts by use of a calibration curve relating c-fu/ml to dt (fig, 1).<br>
The results are shown in fig* I as the number of cells which survive the treatment (average from both Malthus experiments and plate counts)â€¢ Glucose oxidase and hydrogen peroxide in the used concentration have a bactericidal activity, decreasing the cell number from 10* cfu/ml to approximately 10*-1QJ cfu/ml, independent of enhancing agent -<br>
rCIP had a statistical significant bactericidal activity against p4   fluoresceins  when NaSCN or KI were used as enhancing agents. PPT had a slight bactericidal activity, however, only statistically significant at a 10% level. When KI was used as enhancing agent the activity was 100% bactericidal/ both when determined by plate counts and Malthus.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Antibacterial activity of rCIP and KI against P. aeruginosa and $,   aureus.<br>
The antibacterial activity of rCIP was tested in phosphate buffer (pH 6*0) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ATCC 10146 and Staphylococcus aureus  ATCC 25923 with potassium iodide as electron donor; and hydrogen peroxide was added as electron acceptor. The ceils (approximately 107 cfu/ml) were incubated with enzyme for 15 min at 4 0Â°C, and the experiment was carried out using a 23 factorial design reproduced two times. The bactericidal activity was determined by incubation in Malthus, The detection times ineasured by the Malthus instrument were converted to cfu/ml by a standard curve*<br><br><br><br>
sant for the combination of peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide, whereas no activity of hydrogen peroxide combined with iodide was observed.  The activity was observed as a 98% reduction in cfu/'ml.<br>
Increasing the concentration of peroxidase to 1 POXU/ml and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide to 1 raM caused a total kill of the cell suspension.<br><br><br>
