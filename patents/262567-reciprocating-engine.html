DESCRIPTION<br>
RECIPROCATING ENGINE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a reciprocating engine for use in an automobile,<br>
a marine vessel, an industrial prime mover, or the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Patent Document 1: JP-A-4-347352<br>
[0003]<br>
For example, in patent document 1, a reciprocating engine is proposed in<br>
which a second piston ring (second ring) disposed with a first piston ring (top ring)<br>
interposed between the same and a top surface (head end surface) of a piston is inclined<br>
with respect to the reciprocating direction of the piston, such that a gas-pressure<br>
receiving area of the piston between the first piston ring and the second piston ring<br>
becomes greater on a thrust side than on an anti-thrust side, and gases from a<br>
combustion chamber are adapted to be introduced into an annular gas chamber between<br>
the first piston ring and the second piston ring. In such a reciprocating engine, larger<br>
gas pressure is produced on the thrust side than on the anti-thrust side so as to gas float<br>
the piston with respect to the cylinder.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
2<br>
PROBLEMS THAT THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE<br>
[0004]<br>
Incidentally, in the above-described reciprocating engine, the gas-pressure<br>
receiving area of the piston between the first piston ring and the second piston ring is<br>
made greater on the thrust side than on the anti-thrust side by inclining only the second<br>
piston ring, so that the angle of inclination of the second piston ring becomes large, and<br>
the second piston ring becomes remarkably elliptical in shape. As a result, there are<br>
possibilities that it becomes impossible to ensure the gastightness between the outer<br>
peripheral surface of the piston ring and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder, that<br>
the second piston ring becomes difficult to rotate relative to the piston, and that damage<br>
or the like is likely to be caused to the second piston ring and the inner peripheral<br>
surface of the cylinder which is in sliding contact with that second piston ring. In<br>
addition, the fabrication of the piston ring which is remarkably elliptical in shape is also<br>
difficult.<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention has been devised in view of the above-described aspects,<br>
and its object is to provide a reciprocating engine which makes it possible to gas float<br>
the piston with respect to the cylinder, reduce the angle of inclination of each of the first<br>
and second piston rings, and form the annular gas chamber for effectively producing a<br>
floating force for gas floating, and in which circular piston rings can be used, the<br>
gastightness between the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder and the outer<br>
peripheral surfaces of the piston rings can be ensured, and damage or the like is difficult<br>
to cause to the piston rings and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br><br>
3<br>
[0006]<br>
A reciprocating engine in accordance with the invention comprises: a first<br>
piston ring disposed adjacent to a top surface of a piston defining a combustion<br>
chamber; a second piston ring disposed with the first piston ring interposed between the<br>
second piston ring and the top surface of the piston; an annular gas chamber defined by<br>
the first piston ring and the second piston ring; and one or a plurality of communicating<br>
passages for allowing the annular gas chamber and the combustion chamber to<br>
communicate with each other, wherein the first piston ring and the second piston ring<br>
are respectively inclined with respect to a reciprocating direction of the piston so as to<br>
be located further away from each other on a thrust side than on a anti-thrust side.<br>
[0007]<br>
According to the reciprocating engine in accordance with the invention, one or<br>
a plurality of communicating passages are provided for allowing the annular gas<br>
chamber and the combustion chamber to communicate with each other, and the first<br>
piston ring and the second piston ring are respectively inclined with respect to the<br>
reciprocating direction of the piston so as to be located further away from each other on<br>
the thrust side than on the anti-thrust side. Therefore, a larger gas pressure can be<br>
produced in the annular gas chamber on the thrust side than on the anti-thrust side,<br>
thereby making it possible to gas float the piston with respect to the cylinder and<br>
reducing the angle of inclination of each of the first piston ring and the second piston<br>
ring. Hence, it is possible to form the annular gas chamber for effectively producing a<br>
floating force for gas floating. Further, conventional circular piston rings can be used<br>
as the first piston ring and the second piston ring, and the first piston ring and the<br>
second piston ring can be set in a state of being easily rotatable with respect to the<br>
piston and the cylinder. Furthermore, the gastightness between the inner peripheral<br><br>
4<br>
surface of the cylinder and the outer peripheral surfaces of the piston rings can be<br>
ensured, and damage or the like is made difficult to cause to the piston rings and the<br>
inner peripheral surface of the cylinder.<br>
[0008]<br>
In a preferred example of the reciprocating engine in accordance with the<br>
invention, the first piston ring and the second piston ring are located closer to each<br>
other on the anti-thrust side.<br>
[0009]<br>
In another preferred example of the reciprocating engine in accordance with<br>
the invention, the communicating passage is disposed on the thrust side so as to allow<br>
the annular gas chamber and the combustion chamber to communicate with each other<br>
when the piston is positioned at a top dead center or in a vicinity of the top dead center.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to provide a reciprocating engine<br>
which makes it possible to gas float the piston with respect to the cylinder, reduce the<br>
angle of inclination of each of the first and second piston rings, and form the annular<br>
gas chamber for effectively producing a floating force for gas floating, and in which<br>
circular piston rings can be used, the gastightness between the inner peripheral surface<br>
of the cylinder and the outer peripheral surfaces of the piston rings can be ensured, and<br>
damage or the like is difficult to cause to the piston rings and the inner peripheral<br>
surface of the cylinder.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br>
5<br>
[0011]<br>
Next, a more detailed description will be given of an embodiment of the<br>
invention with reference to the embodiment shown in the drawings. It should be noted<br>
that the invention is not limited to the embodiment.<br>
[0012]<br>
In Figs. 1 to 3, a reciprocating engine 1 in accordance with this embodiment is<br>
comprised of an annular top ring 5 serving as a first piston ring disposed adjacent to a<br>
top surface (head end surface) 4 of a piston 3 defining a combustion chamber 2; an<br>
annular second ring 6 serving as a second piston ring disposed with the top ring 5<br>
interposed between the annular second ring 6 and the top surface 4; an annular gas<br>
chamber 7 defined by the top ring 5 and the second ring 6; and a plurality of<br>
communicating passages 8 for allowing the annular gas chamber 7 and the combustion<br>
chamber 2 to communicate with each other.<br>
[0013]<br>
The reciprocating engine 1 may be a two-cycle or four-cycle gasoline engine<br>
or may be a diesel engine.<br>
[0014]<br>
Piston ring grooves, in which the top ring 5 and the second ring 6 are<br>
respectively fitted and secured, are provided on a circumferential surface 22 connected<br>
to the top surface 4 of the piston 3 which reciprocates in a cylinder 21 in an X direction.<br>
In addition, an oil ring groove, in which an oil ring 23 disposed with the second ring 6<br>
interposed between the same and the top ring 5 is fitted and secured, is also provided on<br>
the circumferential surface 22. The top surface 4 is parallel to a plane perpendicular to<br>
the X direction. The piston 3 is connected to one end of a connecting rod 24 by means<br>
of a piston pin 25. A crankshaft 26 is connected to the other end of the connecting rod<br><br>
6<br>
24.<br>
[0015]<br>
An inner peripheral surface 31 of the cylinder 21 defines a cylinder bore<br>
(space) 32 where the piston 3 is disposed. An ignition plug 34, an intake valve 35, and<br>
an exhaust valve (not shown) are provided in a head portion 33 of the cylinder 21.<br>
[0016]<br>
A portion 41 on a thrust side 9 of the top ring 5 is disposed in closer proximity<br>
to the top surface 4 in the X direction than a portion 42 on an anti-thrust side 10 of the<br>
top ring 5. The portion 41 is located further away from the second ring 6 in the X<br>
direction than the portion 42. An outer peripheral surface 43 of the top ring 5 is in<br>
slidable contact with the inner peripheral surface 31 of the cylinder 21. The top ring 5<br>
defines the combustion chamber 2 in cooperation with the cylinder 21 and the piston 3<br>
and defines the annular gas chamber 7 in cooperation with the cylinder 21, the piston 3<br>
and the second ring 6. Such a top ring 5 is inclined with respect to the X direction in<br>
which the piston 3 reciprocates, so as to be located further away from the second ring 6<br>
on the thrust side 9 than on the anti-thrust side 10. The top ring 5 is also inclined with<br>
respect to the plane perpendicular to the X direction, and an angle of such inclination is<br>
preferably 1 degree to 3 degrees, more preferably 2 degrees to 3 degrees, and even more<br>
preferably 2.3 degrees or thereabouts. The top ring 5 is fitted and secured in the piston<br>
ring groove (top ring groove) of the piston 3 with a slight gap so as to assume such a<br>
state as to be capable of rotating with respect to the piston 3 in a C direction shown in<br>
Fig. 2, i.e., the circumferential direction of the piston 3, and to be movable in a radial<br>
direction.<br>
[0017]<br>
A portion 51 on the thrust side 9 of the second ring 6 is disposed further away<br><br>
7<br>
from the top surface 4 in the X direction than a portion 52 on the anti-thrust side 10 of<br>
the second ring 6. The portion 51 is disposed further away from the top ring 5 in the<br>
X direction than the portion 52. The distance from the portion 41 to the portion 51 in<br>
the X direction is longer than the distance between the portion 42 to the portion 52 in<br>
the X direction. An outer peripheral surface 53 of the second ring 6 is in slidable<br>
contact with the inner peripheral surface 31 of the cylinder 21. The second ring 6<br>
defines the annular gas chamber 7 in cooperation with the cylinder 21, the piston 3, and<br>
the top ring 5. Such a second ring 6 is inclined with respect to the X direction in<br>
which the piston 3 reciprocates, so as to be located further away from the top ring 5 on<br>
the thrust side 9 than on the anti-thrust side 10. The second ring 6 is also inclined in<br>
an opposite direction to the top ring 5 with respect to the plane perpendicular to the X<br>
direction, and an angle of such inclination is preferably 1 degree to 3 degrees, more<br>
preferably 2 degrees to 3 degrees, and even more preferably 2.3 degrees or thereabouts.<br>
The second ring 6 is inclined in the opposite direction to the inclination of the top ring 5,<br>
as shown in Fig. 1. The second ring 6 is fitted and secured in the piston ring groove<br>
(second ring groove) of the piston 3 with a slight gap so as to assume such a state as to<br>
be capable of rotating with respect to the piston 3 in the C direction and to be movable<br>
in the radial direction. The respective angles of inclination of the top ring 5 and the<br>
second ring 6 with respect to the plane perpendicular to the X direction may be<br>
mutually identical angles. The top ring 5 and the second ring 6 may be symmetrical.<br>
[0018]<br>
The top ring 5 and the second ring 6 are located further away from each other<br>
in the X direction on the thrust side 9 than on the anti-thrust side 10 and are located<br>
closer to each other on the anti-thrust side 10 than on the thrust side 9. The<br>
gas-pressure receiving area of the circumferential surface 22 between the top ring 5 and<br><br>
8<br>
the second ring 6 is greater on the thrust side 9 than on the anti-thrust side 10, and<br>
gradually increases from the anti-thrust side 10 toward the thrust side 9.<br>
[0019]<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, in this embodiment three communicating passages<br>
8 are respectively disposed on the thrust side 9 to allow the annular gas chamber 7 and<br>
the combustion chamber 2 to communicate with each other when the piston 3 is<br>
positioned at the top dead center or in the vicinity of the top dead center. Each of the<br>
communicating passages 8 has a recess 61 provided on the inner peripheral surface 31<br>
of the cylinder 21.<br>
[0020]<br>
The recesses 61 in this embodiment are respectively arranged on the inner<br>
peripheral surface 31 of the cylinder 21, as shown in Fig. 3, so as to mutually<br>
simultaneously allow the annular gas chamber 7 to communicate with the combustion<br>
chamber 2 in a case where the piston 3 dwells at a position corresponding to between<br>
substantially 0 to 5 degrees and 20 to 30 degrees in the crank angle with respect to the<br>
X direction in the explosion stroke. It should be noted that the aforementioned crank<br>
angle for communication is determined by the piston diameter and the stroke. The<br>
three recesses 61 are respectively arranged at mutually equal intervals in the C direction.<br>
The recess 61 located on one side in the direction in which the piston pin 25 extends<br>
and the recess 61 located on the other side are opposed to each other in the direction in<br>
which the piston pin 25 extends, and the recess 61 located between these two recesses<br>
61 is disposed so as to allow the combustion chamber 2 to communicate with the<br>
annular gas chamber 7 through the portion 41 of the top ring 5.<br>
[0021]<br>
It should be noted that the recess 61 on the one side and the recess 61 on the<br><br>
9<br>
other side may be arranged in the X direction so as to mutually simultaneously allow<br>
the combustion chamber 2 to communicate with the annular gas chamber 7 before or<br>
after the communication between the combustion chamber 2 and the annular gas<br>
chamber 7 through the recess 61 located between the two recesses 61. In addition, the<br>
recess 61 located between the recess 61 on the one side and the recess 61 on the other<br>
side may be omitted. Furthermore, although in this embodiment only one recess 61 is<br>
disposed on each of one side and the other side of the portion 41 of the top ring 5 in the<br>
direction in which the piston pin 25 extends, for example, two or more recesses 61 may<br>
be disposed on the one side, and the recesses 61 in a number identical to that of the<br>
recesses 61 on the one side may be disposed on the other side.<br>
[0022]<br>
It should be noted that although in this embodiment the reciprocating engine 1<br>
has the plurality of communicating passages 8, the reciprocating engine 1 may have<br>
only one communicating passage 8, for example.<br>
[0023]<br>
Hereafter, a detailed description will be given of the operation of the<br>
reciprocating engine 1 in accordance with this embodiment.<br>
[0024]<br>
In the explosion stroke shown in Fig. 1, when the piston 3 starts forward<br>
motion toward the crankshaft 26 side in the X direction, combustion gases in the<br>
combustion chamber 2 are introduced into the annular gas chamber 7 through the<br>
communicating passages 8, and the gas pressure in the annular gas chamber 7 is<br>
increased by the gas pressure of the introduced combustion gases. A lateral pressure<br>
A directed toward the thrust side 9 is imparted to the piston 3 which is forwardly moved,<br>
in the light of such as relationships among the gas pressure to which the piston 3 is<br><br>
10<br>
subjected between the top surface 4 and the top ring 5, the rotation of the crankshaft 26<br>
in an R direction, and the inclination of the connecting rod 24, whereas, against such a<br>
lateral pressure A, a lateral pressure B is also imparted thereto which is directed toward<br>
the anti-thrust side 10 on the basis of the gas pressure in the annular gas chamber 7<br>
produced on a larger scale on the thrust side 9 than on the anti-thrust side 10. The<br>
piston 3 to which the lateral pressures A and B are thus imparted is gas floated with<br>
respect to the cylinder 21.<br>
[0025]<br>
The reciprocating engine 1 in accordance with this embodiment is comprised<br>
of the top ring 5 disposed adjacent to the top surface 4 of the piston 3 defining the<br>
combustion chamber 2; the second ring 6 disposed with the top ring 5 interposed<br>
between the same and the top surface 4 of the piston 3; the annular gas chamber 7<br>
defined by the top ring 5 and the second ring 6; and one or a plurality of communicating<br>
passages 8 for allowing the annular gas chamber 7 and the combustion chamber 2 to<br>
communicate with each other. Further, the top ring 5 and the second ring 6 are<br>
respectively inclined with respect to the X direction which is the reciprocating direction<br>
of the piston 3, so as to be located further away from each other on the thrust side 9<br>
than on the anti-thrust side 10. Therefore, a larger gas pressure can be produced in the<br>
annular gas chamber 7 on the thrust side 9 than on the anti-thrust side 10, thereby<br>
making it possible to gas float the piston 3 with respect to the cylinder 21 and reduce<br>
the angle of inclination of each of the top ring 5 and the second ring 6. For this reason,<br>
it is possible to form the annular gas chamber 7 for effectively producing a floating<br>
force for gas floating. Further, the top ring 5 and the second ring 6 which are circular<br>
in shape can be used, and the top ring 5 and the second ring 6 are set in a state of being<br>
rotatable with respect to the inner peripheral surface 31 of the cylinder 21.<br><br>
11<br>
Furthermore, the gastightness between, on the one hand, the inner peripheral surface 31<br>
of the cylinder 21 and, on the other hand, the outer peripheral surface 43 of the top ring<br>
5 and the outer peripheral surface 53 of the second ring 6 can be ensured, and damage<br>
or the like is made difficult to cause to the top ring 5, the second ring 6, and the inner<br>
peripheral surface 31 of the cylinder 21.<br>
