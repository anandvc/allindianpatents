PROCESS FOR INSTANT CURD FORMATION<br>
The present innovation relates to the process of forming instant curd with dry and powder ingredients subjected to instant reaction in a reconstitution medium, result instant curd as denatured reconstitution. The present innovation is exploration of technology involved in a natural process of milk coagulation to form curds , evaluation of an innovative process casting the making of curd in a convenient and ready to make out presence. Innovation defines new utilities exploring the proprietary behavior made to confer on the components of Milk in their value added form to develop an innovative process.<br>
Naturally curds are formed in a duration of few hours with pinches of lime or available curd ( Starter) put in milk at temperatures 37-42 ^ C (termed as optimum) and up to 65 ^ C. the clabbering of milk is due to Lactobacillus , the natural bacteria in milk metabolizes the milk sugar lactose into lactic acid. Lactic Acid so formed decrease pH of fresh milk from pH 6.6 towards the isoelectric point of pH 4.6 brings about precipitation. It is a bio-chemical reaction in a process of coagulation with implants of bacterial fermentation/ incubation. These phases take a time of few hours . Transformation of Milk's pH from 6.6 to 4.6 is identified as principle in curd formation. Current innovation is the exploitation of the principle to a process carrying convenience , compactness in its product raw material and out presence to utilities in conventional out looks.<br>
Triumph of present invention would be principals of its instant coagulation. Transformation of pH of milk from 6.6 to 4.6 with aids of catalysts, reagents chemically and supported by of coenzymes, co-factors biologically if needed.<br>
The present innovation relates to the process of powdered ingredients forming a composition , a composition of Milk powder with edible acid powder, out present 'Instant Curd' as denatured reconstitution while getting rehydrated in aqueous media or in any other supporting fluid media. The process to results 'Instant Curd with ingredients of the composition react with one another in their dissolution/rehydration to find a denatured reconstitution. The phenomenon is an innovative process and never attempted earlier.<br>
To derive process for milk based products, the protein portion is of particular interest. This is because changes in proteins not only affect quality of derived product, but also to produce certain characteristics. The two primary proteins in Milk  are Casein, Lactalbumin have characteristics<br><br>
which are distinct to one another. Methods of preparation and processing of milk products have been specialized to take advantage of either Casein, Lactalbumin, or both. The main protein of fresh milk, casein, noticeable easily. This is partly because casein is roughly 80% of the total milk protein. It is also partly due to the consequence of denaturing casein. To detail a bit more, Casein macromolecule consists of a Calcium Caseinate molecule made up of calcium, alpha-, beta- and kappa-casein, and some phosphate. The exact structure is not known, however, it is a large macromolecule made up of the milk casein proteins, calcium and phosphate in some type of colloid. The protein consists of approximately 82% of the total protein. This is the protein that primarily makes the clabber, curds. Casein is particularly susceptible to denaturation by the enzyme rennin and by low pH. The later told is imparted with the current innovation.<br>
Coagulation in terms of milk is essentially the formation of gel by destabilizing the casein micelles aggregate them forming a network. This may be accomplished with enzymes or Acid treatment or Heat Acid treatment. Chymosin or Rennet is most often used in enzyme coagulation, where Acid treatment employ lowering the pH of whole milk. They result in casein micelle destabilization or aggregation. Acid coagulation is achieved naturally with starter culture, or artificially with addition of mineral acid or Gluconodelatalactone. Gluconodelatalactone has a slow release Hydrolysis, taking tie to acidify. Earlier usage of acid in commercial application was mainly to promote coagulation of whole milk but never used for instant coagulation results of milk powder. For the above processes lactic acid producers and acid strength promoters are used. They can be either Mineral Acids like HCl, CaCl2 where recent applications use GluconoDelataLactone.<br>
The current invention explores ,claims and experimentally proves that ,milk powder which was not used earlier for showing instant curd formation results, on subjected denaturation in its reconstitution result instant curd. The invention identifies the process that, Milk powder made form a composition with edible acid powder when made to react in the process of reconstitution in specified quantity of water at room temperature. Readily forms Curd as the resultant. Edible Acids powder dissolves simultaneously in the same water. The heat treatment in processing of Milk Powder ,used as the prime ingredient in the composition in its Instant ( Agglomerated) and non- Instant ( regular) to certain extent effect the denaturation of Milk Protein . Same with Whey protein at reconstitution . The denatured protein interact with Casein on addition of Acid, Caseinate precipitate with whey proteins. Powdered edible Acids used in the composition dissolving in the same fluid media with Milk powder   as evaluated through the above process<br><br>
result a denatured reconstitution with a change in pH of 4.6 which other wise would have been 6.6 if only milk powder is allowed to reconstitute. The claimed innovation is an economical method to compared to yogurt powder . yogurt powder is processed dehydrating the curd, curd processed for 6-24 hours under Industrial settings are sent for freeze drying process involving 4-9 hours of processing to result Yogurt powder. Yogurt powder gets rehydrated when subjected to reconstitution. Where the current innovation is a process to readily make curd with dry and powder ingredients subjected to instant reaction in the reconstituting medium.<br>
In water, towards transformation of pH to around 4.6, Acids in the Composition are to bring a 75-105 time increase in [H^] (known as H^ ion concentration ) in the volume of water media in which Milk powder directly would have reconstituted with a pH of 6.6. For example, 25 gm Milk Powder ( spray dried ,instantized) with 90% solids and 2% fat reconstitute in 200 ml water as solution of 6.6 pH forming a composition with acid say 'Citric Acid' preferably 3gm by weight( 0.075M in 200 ml water) would result 'Instant curd' in reconstitution time for milk powder on rehydration in the same 200ml water. 1% emulsifying and stabilizing agents in the form of Gelatin, G.M.S and Alginate impart necessary thickness to the tangy fluid curd formed. Emulsifying agents improve the body of the curds formed, they reduce the possibility of synersis, separation of liquid from curds.<br>
The basic concept in instant curd formation with the claimed innovation as described through fore going write-up can be detailed as following. Milk powder in the processed to dehydration in the perspective of current innovation on subjected heat treatment on milk for prolonged heat treatment at sufficiently high temperatures and long duration denatures the whey protein. In the absence of water due to applied dehydration on milk powder they make weak hydrophobic interaction with Casein in Milk powder.<br>
Casein in milk is not coagulated by heat, it is precipitated by acid. Heat treatment of Milk towards processing of Milk powder where microscopic droplets of milk are exposed to heat treatment appears weaken the interaction forces between casein components within the micelles, and consequently micelles dissociated more readily when pH was lowered in reconstitution with subjected reaction with edible acid powder as evaluated through the claimed process innovation.<br>
The processing steps of the innovation with dry and powder ingredients subjected to instant reaction while reconstituting in the fluid media sets pro-line characteristic environment for instant<br><br>
curd formation. Innovation identifies that when ingredients subjected to reaction in terms of dehydration, transformation of pH of reconstituting Milk powder in the aqueous medium, The denatured whey protein in milk as heat treated conventionally interact with casein and precipitate readily with subjected pH transformation. The recovered whey protein have a greater capacity to bind water, the hydrophilic properties of whey protein the process of reaction accomplish instant draining say as instant whey expulsion which is physically the end out put in the conventional process of coagulation of milk as curd. The above properties made confer on Milk powder due heat processing operation in their processing from milk are termed pre-susceptibility in the perspective of claimed innovation.<br>
Coagulation is essentially the formation of a gel by destabilizing the casein micelles causing them to aggregate and form a network, which partially immobilizes the water and traps the fat globules in the newly formed matrix. This is accomplished instantaneously with the current innovation. The property of instantized Milk powder to readily trap the water, in the perspective of current innovation readily forms network with partial immobilization of water and the components of Milk powder creating a new matrix, forms instant curd with the subjected to dehydration and pH transformation with edible acid powder dissolved in the same medium<br>
Products through the process innovation in T^ Phase would be A solid solution with mix of (1) Milk Powder and (2) edible Acid. Apparently a homogeneous mixture of crystalline and amorphous powders.<br>
Product in 2"^ Phase would be: (Before contents poured in Water): Initial formation of the solution will be solute: mix of milk powder and coagulation agents. Solvent: Water.<br>
Product in 3^^ Phase would be: (When contents poured in Water): Initial solution formed would be (1) Solvent: Milk (Milk powder reconstituted and traces of coagulation agents). Solute: The coagulation agents in the form of edible acids.<br>
Product in 4^^ and final Phase would be: formation of Curd with milk turned milk powder reacting instantly with edible acid sources in aqueous media with support of coagulation agents, co-factors.<br>
The process of coagulation with the invention out present itself with synchronized process of dialysis, dissolution, colloidal dispersion, emulsification and suspension within the reconstituting medium/solution in the limits of iso electric point of reconstituted milk to form instant curds.<br><br>
Supporting fluid media other than aqueous media towards denatured reconstitution of principle ingredients with current innovation can be whole milk or lemon water or a solution of Orange juice water or vinegar solution or water mixed with some edible acid. The this context, composition of milk powder and edible acid powders forming the composition as analyzed in the proposed innovation should result resultant fluid as Instant curd with a pH on a whole as 4.6 . i.e. composition of acid powders need to be fixed to necessarily increase the [H+] concentration with respect to quantity of milk powder in the composition . Where the proportion of milk powder in the composition if allowed to reconstitute in the same volume of water reconstitutes with a pH in a range 6.6 if it is not part of the above composition.<br>
Edible acid powders part of the composition can be cyclic esters for example like gluconondeltalactone or direct edible acids like citric acid or solidified acids that result on acidification in hydrolysis / solvation contribute to augmentation of acid strength to reconstituting milk to result denatured reconstitution. The edible Acid substances dry and powder form in context with present innovation are termed as edible acid powder in generalized terms in the following documentation of the innovation. Edible acids powders part of the composition with milk powder on hydration or salvation in any supporting fluid media produces acidification when entire composition i.e. With milk powder put to dissolve in water or salvation in supporting fluid media. Characteristics of Acid influential in forming the composition with Milk powder are degree of ionization , dissociation constant pKa that give pH to the Acid. While % solids , % fats ,process of drying (depending on media of Reconstitution desired), % dispersion etc are characters with Milk powder. Characteristics of both these components are fixed to fit together deciding reaching iso electric point on rehydration forming instant curds. In reference to the above, composition vary with product requirements .in regard, the following write up uses terms acid powder and milk powder in the description of the innovation and mention of components of the composition. Where compositions and characteristics are described herein with certain examples.<br>
Innovation analyses that edible acids like hydoxy carboxyl acids which can be tartaric acid/ malic acid/ citric acid, etc forming a composition with Milk Powder can show instant coagulation , instant curd formation results on simultaneous dissolve or rehydration in water or other supporting fluid media say Gluconodeltalactone or Miner acids, which earlier were used to only promote coagulation of milk can be parted with thee composition to show pH transformation results depending on availability and desired characteristics in curds .i.e. In   reference to the<br><br>
characteristics of milk power reconstitute denatured as clabber. Which is accomplished through milk protein aggregation with transformation of pH from 6.6-6 to 5-4 composition of the present innovation can impart permitted emulsifier and stabilizing agents as additive to avoid synersis in the end out put.<br>
Apart the above analyzed free abundant acidification agents , other acidification agents within the scope of the presents innovation as edible powder acids for claimed innovation can comprise of tannic acid, malic acid, gluconic acid, glycolic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, isocitric acid, pimelic acid, malonic acid, adipic acid, or any combination thereof<br>
Acid Powder in the form of citric acid part in proposed composition as hydroxy carboxylic acid while transforming pH of reconstituting Milk powder from 6.6 to 4.6 forming instant coagulation also with its natural sequestering property with calcium ions arrests loss of Ca^^ , a loss natural with Acid coagulation where Free Ca^^ naturally supports conventional curd formation. In context restricting loss of Calcium, fragility can be opposed . Hold Ca and help rate of formation of coordination complexes (Coagulation, Gelation) While the same permissibly allow to hold in air to clump to the viscosity developed in reconstitution of the Milk Powder with other components of composition. The natural anti-oxidant property of citric acid stabilizes the process in the preservation perspective while the acidity in pH of the range 4 of denatured rehydrated drink work against spore germination or mold growth ^restricts pathogenic bacteria.<br>
Sequestration is the process of forming of coordination complexes of an ion in solution. Sequestration often involves the formation of chelate complexes, and is used to prevent the chemical effect on an ion without removing it from the solution, citric acid acts on Ca^ with same property. It is also used as way of supplying ions in a protected form. However fragility of the results of the acid curd is supported by gelling agents Emulsifying agents ( external) with composition gives apparently homogenous solution.<br>
Citric acid often part of the innovation is recognized as a safe for use in food by all major national and international food regulatory agencies. It is naturally present in almost all forms of life ,and excess citric acid is readily metabolized and eliminated from the body. Similarly Gluconodeltalactone is assigned generally recognized as safe , conferred GRAS status by the US Food and Drug Administration permitting its use in food without limitation.<br><br>
A single compound having both chelating and acidification properties as such as citric acid, Chelation and acidification can be subjected to take place by separate agents. In that context, proportion of acidifying agents with chelating agents are fixed in the limit that that resultant acidification confer to a pH 5-6 of the out put curd. A non-exhaustive list of Chelating agents within the scope of present innovation composition comprises ethylenediaminotetraacetate, pyrophosphate, citric acid, malic acid, gluconic acid, sodium citrate, disodium citrate, potassium citrate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium hexa metaphosphate, sodium acid pyrophosphate which also acts as emulsifier and thickening agent, monopotassium dihydrogen orthophosphate, dipotassium hydrogen orthophosphate, tripotassium orthophosphate, monosodium phosphate, dipotassium phosphate, trisodium phosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium aluminum phosphate, sodium potassium tartrate, or mixtures thereof.<br>
PRINCIPLES OF COAGULATION<br>
Reconstituted Milk pH 6.6 - 6.7<br>
Milk powder at reconstitution has protein as a solution The water-soluble materials are in solution<br>
An appropriate pH 5.2 one begins to see denaturation Through increased viscosity<br>
At pH 4.6, the isoelectric point of Caseinate, there is maximum denaturation. If done correctly, a gel or clabber will be formed<br>
Milk Clabber or Curd<br>
ACID COAGULATION -RESULTS<br>
Reconstituting milk /milk normally has a pH of 6.6. At this pH, the casein molecules exist primarily in a charged form, which causes them to repel each other thus preventing coagulation and precipitation. The acid powder dissolved in water with Milk powder,<br><br>
while reconstituting as Milk lowers the pH of reconstituting milk to 4.6, the isoelectric point of casein, at which time the proteins coagulate and begin to precipitate.<br><br>
ISO ELECTIC POINT<br>
The isoelectric point is the pH at which the protein exists primarily in its 'zwitterion* form that is there is no net charge on the protein molecules<br>
NH3 - CH - COO-<br>
R<br>
In the above experiment, the greater the percentage of solids present, the greater the number and the closer together the curds. At 13% solids (whole milk), there are fewer curds forming in the liquid, resulting in a slightly thickened liquid containing very evident curds. At 73% solids (normally condensed milk), the milk becomes very thick and smooth looking as the curds are packed very close together. While Non Fat Skimmed Milk Powder in reference to the innovation consist 90% solids. Curds contain the protein casein, fat, some minerals and fat-soluble vitamins.<br>
In brief ,Milk powder is the prime component of the claimed innovation. Milk Powder reconstitutes/ dehydrates forming instant Milk . Milk powder is convenient and compact milk. Milk Powder carries many properties of whole milk and boiled milk, reconstitutes restoring the volume of water removed during processing. Milk Powder as does Milk reconstitute as a solution of pH 6.6. The claimed innovation is a process identifying that characteristic properties can be made to confer on milk powder in the processing from Milk, the same when subjected to denaturation/ coagulation with edible acid powder at reconstitution, which in reconstitution towards transformation of acid strength (pH) form instant curds. The phenomena of transforming pH of reconstituting Milk powder from 6.6 to 4.6 is identified as key step for the reaction and is analysed to obtain instant coagulation results .<br><br>
Ingredients: Present invention deals with the facet of milk as Milk Powder. Over view of key ingredients with the current invention is analysed here in. The type of milk powder created varies with processing. In turn, processing may have an influence on the quality of the product. Additionally, the market for skim and low fat milks has increased in recent years, perhaps because of lower calories. A desire for an easy to store and/or transportable milk has given rise to NFDM (nonfat dry milk solids) processed through homogenized milk. These engineered products should vary considerably in composition depending upon the particular characteristics desired. Say, have more Antimycolic Agents , enough fat proportion . The reconstitution requirements decides the drying process on milk . Current invention with properties of its other ingredients benefits restricting need of more Antimycolic Agents in Milk Powder. Spray dried whole milk powder can for more thicker curds. Can augment the quantity of whey protein by adding whey protein isolate or whey protein concentrate to milk powder, complement the characteristic properties in the out put curd in the form more whey protein to participate in the subjected reaction on milk powder compared to the conventional composition of whey and casein components in milk powder.<br>
Milk powder reconstitutes to milk with properties of its dispersion and allows the formation of instant curds. Following are two categories in Milk Powder in reconstitution perspective.<br>
Reconstitution as a day today process in reference to Milk powder is defined as. Water added to dry milk powder to restore to the volume of water that had been removed during processing. The milk is restored to its original form and composition.<br>
The constituents of milk powder on reconstitution are dispersed as either i) Colloidal dispersion ii) Solution iii) Suspension .For example, the carbohydrate portion is present in solution, and the ash is likely also dispersed as a true solution. There is some indication that calcium phosphate may form a large micelle and have characteristics of a colloidal dispersion. The fat may be present as globules in suspension or emulsified throughout the milk. Protein is colloidally dispersed.<br>
Instantized Milk Powder( analyzed in the following lines here with) serves the role of prime constituent. Instantized milk with suitable proportion of fat would directly turn into milk - make the products described through example 1 &amp; 2 discusses with advantage of no external whipping required on it.<br><br>
Dried: Water is removed from nonfat milk resulting in a dry powder. The first step is to remove 2/3 of the water from the milk to produce very concentrated milk which runs though evaporator undergoing prolonged Heat treatment ,some time 135- 210 degrees F, at Partial vacuum is practiced, pasteurization is carried in the process along with evaporation operation. Then sent for standardization operation . Standardized which means the different components of the milk are mixed automatically until we have a consistent product. Every batch must be exactly the same composition. The evaporated, condensed milk is turned into powdered milk. Depending on need. Then the concentrated milk is spray dried in a heated vacuum, drying can be through the spray nozzle the newer atomization system where there are many spray dryers in operation. Where spray of a fine mist of condensed milk into 450-400 degree F. swirling air. As the milk droplets fall, the swirling air quickly removes the water out of the droplets of milk until all that's left is a small particle of milk powder not much larger than a speck of dust. As it falls, the air cools to about 300- 250 degrees F until it settles into the funnel shaped hopper in the bottom of the tower where it's removed. The operators can carefully control the moisture level of the finished product by controlling the swirling air in the tower, resulting in a fine dry powder, which can be reconstituted in warm water. The problem with this product is that there is a tendency for the dry milk solids to lump when added to water.<br>
Instantized: The dry milk powder obtained from the above steps is further treated in a process called agglomeration. The dry powder is exposed to moisture a second time and then redried. The final result is an instant milk powder composed of loose and porous particles, which dissolves easily in cold water.<br>
Spray-drying is the principal method used for drying milk in the dairy industry. Most skim milk powders used as ingredients are spray dried and as said above are manufactured in two basic varieties: instant (agglomerated) and non-instant (regular). The instantized spray-drying process gives the powder a larger grain size than regular spray dried powder and renders it instantly soluble when reconstituted in cold water.<br>
Properties conferred on Milk powder in the perspective of claimed innovation is analyzed as here in . Heat treatment of milk appeared to weaken the interaction forces between casein components within the micelles, and, consequently, micelles dissociated more readily when pH was lowered with subjected acidification with the claimed innovation, milk at the processing stage to Milk powder at sufficiently high temperatures conferred unique properties that: The long duration heat treatment denatures the whey proteins which can then be coagulated along with the casein at low<br><br>
pH and recovered as liquid remaining after the formation of curd . Heat treatment conventionally triggers denatured whey protein to make hydrophobic interactions with casein where in the processing of Milk powder due to the dehydration operation, whey proteins are analyzed to make weak hydrophobic interactions with casein components, i.e due to the absence of supporting water media. The recovered whey proteins have a great capacity to bind water so that a high moisture but firm curd can be produced, hence, another huge yield advantage; Acid coagulation is analyzed to requires less acidification, so the final cheese is much less acid with pH in the range of 5.2 to 6.0 rather than the range 4.4 - 4.8 required normally. The heat treatment applied during the manufacture of specific spray dried milk powders will, to a certain extent, affect the denaturation of the milk proteins, and consequently, their solubility and functionality as milk ingredients. The degree of denaturation is normally expressed by the Whey Protein Nitrogen Index (WPNI) as milligrams of undenaturued whey protein (u.w.p.) per gram of powder. (See Whey Protein Nitrogen Index Table.)<br><br>
Microbiological requirements : Strict microbiological requirements are placed on the quality of the raw milk that is used in the manufacture of milk powders. Consequently, SMP should be free from bacteria of the genus Salmonella. One gram of powder must not contain more than 50 000 mesophilic bacteria, 10 coliforms and 100 Staphylococcus aureus. These counts correspond respectively to about 5000, 1 and 10 per lire of reconstituted product, provided that contamination does not occur after manufacture. Composition<br>
Skim milk powder (SMP) must contain no less than 95 percent milk solids and must not exceed 4 percent moisture or 1.5 percent of fat, unless otherwise indicated. In the case of instantized SMP, Vitamins A and D are added. Regular and instantized SMP may also contain an anti-foaming agent which not mandatory with the current innovation say for example-2.<br><br>
Typical Composition for Skim Milk Powder (illustration)<br><br>
Utilities, the Process innovation is capable of deriving commercial utilities / industrial products like Instant Lassy, Instant Butter milk or Instant crud Milk through a sachet of powder ingredients readily forming amiable out presence. Apart the commercial utilities innovation evaluated analyzed the Characteristic features carried with it's out presence capable to serve as Unique media for Drug Delivery. Where the process innovation confers to the formation of 'Instant Curd' with Dry and Powder/ ingredients on rehydration/reconstitution in a glass of water . Innovation identifies the proprietary characteristics of the ingredients and end out put with the innovation can cater certain drug components, drugs in the form of friendly bacteria , Heath proactive enzymes ,or pharmaceutical application based molecules.<br>
The characteristic features with innovation (basically Curd) out present reconstituting media around a pH of 4.5, which prevents proliferation of other pathogenic Bacteria while product as such support /ingest friendly bacteria.

Supporting process, composition of powder enzyme / Bio-engineered Enzyme bacteria /starter Culture to be added with the composition of ingredients analyzed with the present invention to take better out put in terms desirable characteristics in clabber and gel formation. The support process can be applicable in conditions say process out put can be in Luke warm water , temperature 35-42 ^C and not less than 10 ° C or above 65^C. In the above conditions and emphasizing the exploration that milk powder can subjected to denaturation, the process can be composition of Milk powder, Powder Enzymes , coenzyme, catalyst which result instant Curd inline natural clabbering, following is the analysis on the process .<br>
Supporting Process-1, Rennin is an enzyme which coagulates milk proteins to form a gel. The same is case with Bio- Engineered Rennet the 'Chymosin' .though a non- bio engineered enzyme Mucor mihei is also in use. Rennin comes from rennet^ a salt extract from the stomach of milk fed calves. Rennin is responsible for releasing Glycomacropeptides from the kappa casein of milk. Glycomacropeptides are extremely hydrophilic; this accounts for rennin stabilizing properties. Enzyme cleaves the peptide bond between Phenylalanine and Methionine in Kappa Casein. This hydrolyzes the Kappa Casein and an insoluble gel is the result. Because milk protein is 82 percent casein, rennin proves to be a very effective thickening agent. I.e. Rennin is a proteolytic enzyme. It is capable of destabilizing the casein micelle, which results in the precipitation of the protein, or the formation of curds. The enzyme eliminates the protective function of K casein in the casein micelle, thus promoting curd formation. The complete reaction takes place in two steps.<br>
Step - 1 : The Enzyme stage<br>
Rennin/Chymosin<br>
Ca Phosphocaseinate	►     Ca Sensitive Ca Pasphocaseinate<br>
In this reaction, the enzyme acts on K Casein, altering it so that it become sensitive to the free Ca^^ in the milk.<br><br>
Step - 2 : The non-enzyme reaction<br>
Ca"^<br>
Ca Sensitive Ca Phosphocaseinate    	►     Ca Pasphocaseinate (Precipitate)<br>
The modified Casein micelle is precipitated by the free Ca^^ in the milk resulting in the formation of a gel.<br>
Increased Ca   activity, addition of CaCb are factors affecting in terms coagulation and with enzyme. Dephosphorylation of the casein micelle results in formation of a soft curd and Consolidation of coagulum involves interactions between Ca^"^ ions and phosphate groups of the casein proteins. They result good Gelation<br>
Supporting Process -2, lactic-acid-producing bacteria such as Streptococcus lacti. Lactobacillus acidophilus^ Lactobacillus bulgaricus, or Streptococcus thermophilus, bacteria (which may benefit digestion). Specially selected lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus, generally used for 'starter cultures. These Antimicrobials Nisin and other new ones being developed (e.g. pediocin, lactocin) are produced by lactic acid bacteria they can also extend shelf life of the product . Inculcate the suitable with the process of current invention, incubate milk along with principle of acid coagulation of current invention.<br>
Process of current invention with Milk Powder and Acid Powder can be well supported with the above two process. Else the two process can be two exclusive process with milk powder in conditions of reconstitution say in Luke warm water, zero contamination media and environmental support ( fit in conditions of low temperature atmosphere).<br>
In reference to improve the and under conditions absolute need to naturally improve gel strength and in strict packaging conditions of product from the process, add 1) conditionally supporting enzyme in 0.5- 25 mg /ILt reconstituting medium in he form of Bio-engineered rennet 'Chymosin' or non Bio-Engineered enzyme Mucor Mehei 2) conditionally supporting Bacteria available in powder form in 60 -70 million spores /ILt reconstituting medium in the forms of Streptococcus Lacti cultured with Lacto Bulgarious, Lacto bacillus acidophilus or Streptococcus thermophilus put in as supplementary ingredients on process forming instant Curds . Edible acid in the composition as Citric acid in the proposed composition with rennet/chymosin / Mucor Mehei increases the rate of reaction, citric acid lowers the reconstituting milk powder partially denatures milk protein and with its sequestering property supplies Ca++ ions setting up<br><br>
characteristic environment for the rennet reaction. Calcium sensitive casein, where partially denatured casein with action taken on its protective function due to lowered pH turns it sensitive to calcium, with free Ca++ ions obtained due to initial partial denaturation precipitates into larger curds. The lactic acid supportive bacteria added to the principle composition producing lactic acid can complement the claimed process innovation. The above claim is optional with respect to the current invention.<br>
How ever control of bacteriological /enzymatic reaction need precision and acute care. In context, the above process is taken as possible consideration to support the much economical and easy to make process with prime invention under select condition of temperature and pressure at out presence/ reconstitution. Process as a support means to acid Coagulation underlines that powdered ingredients with the composition prove to result instant curd as well.<br><br><br><br>
