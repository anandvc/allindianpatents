				<td>Description<br>
Field Device<br>
The invention relates to a field device, in particular for use<br>
in power installations, for example in power supply<br>
installations, having the features as claimed in the<br>
precharacterizing clause of claim 1.<br>
A field device such as this is formed, for example, by the<br>
SIPROTEC 7SA511 or 7SA513 protective device from SIEMENS AG.<br>
This protective device is equipped with a microprocessor<br>
arrangement which carries out a program module, which defines<br>
the device function, during operation of the field device.<br>
Nowadays, field devices in power installations carry out a<br>
multiplicity of functions relating to protection and control.<br>
The performance and the functionality of the devices are rising<br>
continuously. One problem that is occurring increasingly from<br>
the point of view of the field device manufacturers is to<br>
provide the respectively appropriate device for every customer<br>
requirement: in this case, of course, the devices must provide<br>
all the functions which the respective customer requires; at<br>
the same time, however, care must be taken because of cost and<br>
pricing aspects to ensure that the devices are not overdesigned<br>
for their functions and cannot carry out more functions than<br>
the customer needs and is prepared to pay for.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of specifying a<br>
field device which can be configured easily and quickly such<br>
that predetermined device functions can be carried out and<br>
other functions are not available, or are available only to a<br>
restricted extent.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by a field<br>
device having the features of claim 1. Advantageous refinements<br><br>
of the field device according to the invention are specified in<br>
dependent claims.<br><br>
The invention accordingly provides for the field device to have<br>
a protection device which is designed such that it checks<br>
whether an input function description block, which describes a<br>
desired device function, describes an enabled device function<br>
and, if a device function is not enabled, prevents it from<br>
being carried out and, if a device function is enabled, allows<br>
it to be carried out. By way of example, the function<br>
description block may be input in the form of a file - for<br>
example using the XML format.<br>
One major advantage of the field device according to the<br>
invention is that the functional scope, which can be used by<br>
the user, of the device can be set very simply and at low cost<br>
just by enabling or inhibiting device functions which are<br>
provided in the device. The functional scope which is actually<br>
available to the user may therefore be less than the functional<br>
scope which the device would in principle be able to provide if<br>
further device functions were enabled. The configuration<br>
accessed by the manufacture can therefore be carried out just<br>
by enabling and inhibiting device functions which, for example,<br>
are in the form of software.<br>
A further major advantage of the field device according to the<br>
invention is that this considerably simplifies storage at the<br>
manufacturer's premises. Ideally, in theory, it will be<br>
sufficient to produce hardware for just a single field device<br>
type and to define the final functional scope of the device and<br>
the final device type solely by software enabling and<br>
inhibiting.<br>
A third major advantage of the field device according to the<br>
invention is that, despite the presence of the protection<br>
device, it can be operated very easily: the device function<br>
which is desired by the user is defined - within the scope of<br>
the enabled device functions - just by inputting a function<br>
description block<br><br>
which describes the device function - for example using the XML<br>
format. BÎ³ way of example, an input such as this can be entered<br>
using a configuration tool which is provided by the<br>
manufacturer.<br>
In order, as reliably as possible, to prevent the user from<br>
overcoming a device function inhibit by misuse, it is<br>
considered to be advantageous for the projection device to have<br>
an interpreter module which interprets the function description<br>
block which has been input by the user or manufacturer and<br>
then produces the appropriate program module using a plurality<br>
of function modules which are preinstailed in firmware,<br>
preferably hardware, in the field device, only if the input<br>
function description block describes an enabled device<br>
function. This advantageous refinement of the field device<br>
makes it harder for the user to access the internal function,<br>
and reduces the possibilities for misuse. Furthermore, the<br>
program module which is required for operation of the device is<br>
not yet available, so that the user cannot read and copy it or<br>
modify it by misuse - for example in order to enable inhibited<br>
device functions.<br>
Device functions can be enabled and inhibited particularly<br>
easily and therefore advantageously if the protection device is<br>
designed such that it compares a feature block which is<br>
contained in the function description block with an<br>
identification block, which is stored in the field device or is<br>
accessible to the field device and describes the enabled<br>
functional scope of the field device, and prevents the device<br>
function which is described in the function description block<br>
from being carried out if the features which are described in<br>
the feature block are not present or are defined as inhibited<br>
in the identification block.<br>
The identification block is preferably stored in the field<br>
device. In this case, the identification block preferably<br><br>
has a device identification which identifies the field device<br>
for which the identification block is intended.<br>
Alternatively, the identification block can be stored in an<br>
external memory module which is connected to the field device<br>
for its operation. In this case, the identification block<br>
preferably contains a memory identification which identifies<br>
the external memory with which the identification block is<br>
associated. In this embodiment, although the identification<br>
block is suitable for a multiplicity of field devices, copy<br>
protection nevertheless remains ensured.<br>
The identification block is particularly preferably signed with<br>
an electronic signature, and the protection device is designed<br>
such that it prevents the further processing of the function<br>
description block if the check of the electronic signature<br>
gives a negative result. A signature for the identification<br>
block such as this makes it possible to prevent a user being<br>
able to modify the identification block by misuse, in order<br>
retrospectively to extend the device functions.<br>
By way of example, the protection device is designed such that<br>
it decrypts the identification block, which has been encrypted<br>
using a first key of a key pair, in order to check the<br>
electronic signature using a second key of the key pair. The<br>
second key of the key pair is preferably stored in a memory<br>
area, which is protected against unauthorized reading, of the<br>
field device.<br>
The protection device can also be designed such that it checks<br>
the feature block for the presence of a valid electronic<br>
signature, and prevents the further processing of the function<br>
description block if the check of the electronic signature<br>
gives a negative result. By way of example, it is recommended<br>
that function blocks have a signature when the aim is to ensure<br><br>
that an input can be made to function description blocks only<br>
by using a manufacturer's configuration tool. By way of<br>
example, a restriction to a manufacturer's configuration tool<br>
such as this makes it possible to ensure that the only function<br>
description blocks and feature blocks which can be used are<br>
those which have been checked by the manufacturer and have been<br>
classified as safe in terms of guarantee and reliability.<br>
The protection device is preferably designed such that it<br>
decrypts the feature block, which is being encrypted using a<br>
first key of a further key pair, in order to check the<br>
electronic signature, using a second key of the further key<br>
pair. The second key of the further key pair is preferably<br>
stored in a memory area which is protected against unauthorized<br>
reading.<br>
The memory area or areas which is or are protected against<br>
unauthorized reading is or are preferably integrated in a<br>
module, or in each case in one module which carries out an<br>
essential, indispensable basic function of the field device.<br>
This makes it possible to prevent the possibility of modules<br>
with keys being replaced by any other electrical modules with<br>
different keys in order, for example, to overcome the signature<br>
protection. For example, the modules control a data bus or an<br>
interface of the field device. By way of example, the modules<br>
with protected memory areas may be integrated in ASIC, FPGA or<br>
CPLD modules.<br>
Furthermore, with regard to the maximum possible level of user-<br>
friendliness, it is considered to be advantageous for the<br>
identification block to contain a basic function block and an<br>
option block, with the basic function block defining an enabled<br>
basic functional scope of the field device, and with the option<br>
block defining an enabled option scope within which further<br>
additional functions may be added to the basic functional scope<br>
by the user without this leading to<br><br>
the field device being blocked by the protection device.<br>
A value number is in each case preferably stored in the option<br>
block for each optional additional function, and the enabled<br>
option scope is preferably defined by a maximum value (referred<br>
to in the following text as a prepaid variant). For example the<br>
protection device adds the value numbers of the additional<br>
functions which have been selected by the user and prevents the<br>
resultant device function from being carried out if the sum<br>
value is more than the maximum value.<br>
Alternatively, the identification block may describe only a<br>
single device function, and may not allow any options if the<br>
customer requires only a simple version of the field device. In<br>
this case, the function description block including the feature<br>
block is preferably already stored in the field device at the<br>
manufacturer's premises.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following<br>
text with reference to exemplary embodiments; in this case, by<br>
way of example:<br>
Figure 1 shows one exemplary embodiment of a field device<br>
according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows the design of a protection module for a<br>
protection device for the field device as shown in<br>
Figure 1,<br>
Figure 3 shows one exemplary embodiment for the production of<br>
an identification block for the field device as shown<br>
in Figure 1, and<br>
Figure 4 shows one exemplary embodiment for the production of<br>
a function description block for the field device as<br>
shown in Figure 1.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a field device 10 which is equipped with a<br>
microprocessor unit 20 as well as a main memory 30 and<br><br>
a protection device 40. The microprocessor unit 20, the main<br>
memory 3 0 and the protection device 40 are connected via a<br>
device-internal data bus 50 to one another and to an external<br>
connection A10 of the field device 10.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 1, the protection device 40 is<br>
equipped with an interpreter module 60, a protection module 70<br>
and a memory area 80 in which function modules FM are stored.<br>
The protection module 7 0 is connected via the connection A7 0a<br>
to the data bus 50, and via the connection A70b to the<br>
interpreter module 60.<br>
By way of example, the field device 10 illustrated in Figure 1<br>
is operated as follows:<br>
In a first step, which is carried out even during the<br>
production and/or configuration of the field device 10, an<br>
identification block KB is stored in the main memory 3 0 of the<br>
field device 10; a storage process such as this can be carried<br>
out, for example, via the connection AlO on the field device<br>
10. The functional scope which is permissible for operation of<br>
the field device is described in the identification block KB.<br>
For example, it is possible to state in the identification<br>
block KB that the field device 10 may be operated as a distance<br>
protective device, as a power-quality measurement device or as<br>
a differential-protective measurement device.<br>
After the initial installation of the identification block KB<br>
and delivery of the field device 10 to a final customer, this<br>
also referred to in the following text as a user, a function<br>
description block FB is stored in the main memory 3 0 at the<br>
user's premises by means of a configuration tool, which is not<br>
illustrated in Figure 1 (for the sake of clarity) but is<br>
connected to the connection AlO of the field device. In the<br>
function description block FB, the user inputs to the field<br>
device 10 how he wishes to use the device<br><br>
and what device functions the field device is intended to carry<br>
out. The device functions to be carried out are contained in a<br>
feature block MB of the function description block FB;<br>
alternatively, the function description block. FB may also be<br>
defined solely by the feature block MB.<br>
When the field device 10 is now used by the user, then the<br>
protection device 40 first of all checks whether the function<br>
description block FB which has been input at the user's<br>
premises, to be precise the feature block MB contained in it,<br>
describes a device function which is enabled for the field<br>
device 10. If the protection device 40 in this case finds that<br>
the device function required by the user is defined in the<br>
identification block KB as being enabled, then it enables<br>
device operation, as a result of which the microprocessor unit<br>
20 can carry out the device function. Furthermore, it checks<br>
whether the identification block KB which is contained in the<br>
field device 10 contains the ID stored in the protection device<br>
40 of the field device, and the signature of the identification<br>
block KB and of the feature block MB can be checked using the<br>
public key Key OSK which is stored in the memory area 80.<br>
The program module PM which can be run and is required for<br>
control of the microprocessor unit 2 0 is supplied by the<br>
interpreter module 60, which evaluates the device function<br>
described in the feature block MB or the; function description<br>
block FB, and uses the function modules FM which are stored in<br>
the memory area 80 to produce the program module PM.<br>
If, in contrast, the protection device 40 finds that no device<br>
function which is enabled for the field device. 10 is described<br>
in the function block FB, then it blocks the interpreter module<br>
60 and/or the microprocessor unit 2 0 in order to prevent the<br>
field device 10 from being started up with the unapproved<br>
device function.<br><br>
If, for example, the identification block KB contains the<br>
stipulation that the field device 10 may be operated only as a<br>
distance protective device, as a power-quality measurement<br>
device or as a differential-protective device, then starting up<br>
with a different device function is prevented even if, in<br>
principle, the interpreter module 60 were able to simulate this<br>
device function using the function modules FM stored in the<br>
memory area 80. Thus, in other words, because of the function<br>
modules FM which are stored in the memory area 80 and the<br>
method of operation of the interpreter module 60, the field<br>
device 10 can always be suitable for carrying out device<br>
functions other than those defined in the identification block<br>
KB; however, nevertheless such functions cannot be carried out<br>
since the protection device 40 first of all checks whether the<br>
device function required by the user is described and enabled<br>
in the identification block KB.<br>
In order to prevent the identification block KB from being<br>
corrupted by the user and, for example, having the permissible<br>
device functions extended, the identification block KB is<br>
preferably signed at the manufacturer's premises with an<br>
electronic signature in that, for example, it is encrypted<br>
using a first key of a first key pair; furthermore, the device<br>
identification number ID of the field device 1.0 is used in the<br>
encryption process. The encrypted identification block KB' is<br>
then stored in the main memory 30.<br>
The function description block FB and the encrypted feature<br>
block MB contained in it are also preferably signed with an<br>
electronic signature, and are stored in an encrypted form.<br>
Encryption of the feature block MB is advantageous in order to<br>
prevent the user from installing function description blocks in<br>
the field device 10 which have not been produced and tested by<br>
the manufacturer of the field device 10. The encryption of the<br>
blocks FB and MB<br><br>
is carried out, for example, using a first key of a second key<br>
pair, forming an encrypted function description block FB' and<br>
an encrypted feature block MB' contained therein.<br>
An encryption technique based on key pairs is preferably used<br>
for the encryption and the decryption of the identification<br>
block KB, of the function description block FB and of the<br>
feature block MB contained in it. In this case, the encryption<br>
is carried out using a first key and can be reversed only using<br>
the second key of the key pair. Encryption such as this<br>
therefore allows an encrypted file to be read only when the<br>
second key is available. The holder of the second key can at<br>
the same time also check the authenticity of the file because<br>
sensitive decryption using the second key is possible only when<br>
the source file has actually been encrypted using the first key<br>
of the key pair, which the key-pair holder keeps secret and<br>
which is therefore unknown by third parties, and therefore by<br>
the second-key holder himself. The described encryption process<br>
can be carried out, for example, on the basis of the RSA or<br>
triple-DES method. Alternatively, a so-called message digest<br>
can be calculated over the feature block MB and the<br>
identification block KB by means of a hash-code method, for<br>
example using the MD5 or SHA1 algorithm, can then be encrypted<br>
and then added to the blocks KB and MB as a signature. This<br>
signature can be checked in the field device 10 by decryption<br>
of the message digest using the public key Key OSK contained in<br>
the memory 80, followed by completion of the calculation of the<br>
message digest using the SHA1 or MD5 algorithm. A match between<br>
the decrypted and the completed message digest is obtained only<br>
if the blocks KB and MB have not been changed between the time<br>
of signature and the time of the check.<br>
The method of operation of the protection module 7 0 of the<br>
protection device 40 as shown in Figure 1 will now be explained<br>
below in more detail<br><br>
with reference to Figure 2, by way of example. Figure 2 shows a<br>
first unit 100, which cannot be monitored, and a second unit<br>
110, which cannot be monitored, which units are connected to<br>
one another via a comparison device 120. The expression a unit<br>
which cannot be monitored means a unit which cannot be<br>
eavesdropped on during its operation, such that its method of<br>
operation cannot be understood from the outside. The two units<br>
100 and 110 which cannot be monitored may, for example, be in<br>
the form of protected hardware blocks, for example in the form<br>
of an ASIC, FPGA or gate-array module.<br>
The object of the unit 100 which cannot be monitored is first<br>
of all to check whether the encrypted identification block KB'<br>
stored in the main memory 30 of the field device 10 is the<br>
original identification block as produced at the manufacturer's<br>
premises; this check prevents the protection, module 70 from<br>
using an identification block KB' which is being corrupted by<br>
the user where possible for its further check.<br>
In order to check the authenticity of the encrypted<br>
identification block KB' , the unit 100 first of all checks the<br>
device identification number ID of the field device 70 and<br>
decrypts the identification block KB' using a second key, which<br>
is stored in it in the form of hardware and "concealed", of the<br>
already mentioned first key pair. The decrypted identification<br>
block KB is passed to the comparison device 12 0, which compares<br>
the decrypted identification block KB with the feature block<br>
MB.<br>
As already mentioned, the function description block FB and the<br>
feature block MB contained in it are also preferably stored in<br>
encrypted form, as is indicated by the reference symbol MB' in<br>
Figure 2. The decryption process is carried out using a second<br>
key, which is stored in hardware and concealed in the second<br>
unit 110, of the second key pair in the second unit 110. As<br><br>
in the case of the encryption and decryption of the<br>
identification block KB which has already been described, it is<br>
also possible to use the RSA or 3DES method in this case.<br>
Alternatively, the electronic signature of the blocks can be<br>
checked as already described.<br>
On the output side, the unit 110 produces the decrypted feature<br>
block MB and transmits this to the comparison device 12 0 which<br>
compares the contents of the decrypted feature block MB and the<br>
contents of the decrypted identification block KB with one<br>
another and produces an enable signal S1 with a logic 1 if the<br>
comparison result is positive, and the device function as<br>
defined in the decrypted feature block MB corresponds to an<br>
enabled device function which is described in the decrypted<br>
identification block KB.<br>
If, during decryption of the encrypted identification block<br>
KB' , the unit 100 which cannot be monitored finds that this<br>
cannot be decrypted using the second key of the first key pair,<br>
then on its output side it produces a control signal S2 with a<br>
logic 0, thus indicating that the identification block KB has<br>
been modified and can no longer be decrypted. Only if a legible<br>
and comprehensible identification block KB is formed on<br>
decryption of the encrypted identification block KB' does the<br>
unit 100 produce on its output side the control signal S2 with<br>
a logic 1, thus indicating that the encrypted identification<br>
block KB' is an original, to be precise an identification block<br>
KB produced by the manufacturer.<br>
In a corresponding manner, the unit 110 produces a control<br>
signal S3 with a logic 1 on its output side when it finds<br>
during decryption of the encrypted feature block MB' that<br>
decryption can be carried out successfully using the second<br>
key, stored in the unit 110, of the second key pair. In<br>
contrast, it produces the control signal S3 with a logic 0 when<br>
decryption<br><br>
cannot be carried out using the stored second key of the second<br>
key pair.<br>
A control device 150 for the protection module 70 enables the<br>
field device 10 only when all three control signals S1, S2 and<br>
S3 are in a logic 1 state, as a result of which the interpreter<br>
module 60 can use the function description block FB to produce<br>
the program module PM with the assistance of the function<br>
modules FB.<br>
Figure 3 shows an exemplary embodiment for the production and<br>
storage of the identification block KB shown in Figure 1. As<br>
can be seen, a device function list L which has been preset at<br>
the manufacturer's premises as being permissible is encrypted<br>
in an encryption device 200 by means of a coding method using<br>
the first key SL1 of the first key pair; the device<br>
identification number ID of the field device 70 is also taken<br>
into account, thus resulting in the formation of an encrypted<br>
identification block KB' which is suitable for only one<br>
specific field device 70. The identification block KB'<br>
therefore cannot be run on other devices whose device<br>
identification number ID does not match the device<br>
identification number stored in the identification block KB'.<br>
The encrypted identification block KB' formed in this way is<br>
stored in the main memory 3 0 of the field device 10, as shown<br>
in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 4 shows one exemplary embodiment of a configuration<br>
process for the field device 10 as shown in Figure 1. By way of<br>
example, a configuration process such as this is carried out by<br>
the user using a configuration tool. For this purpose, the<br>
configuration tool is equipped with configuration software 3 00<br>
which is available at the manufacturer's premises. The<br>
configuration software accesses a multiplicity of preferably<br>
signed function modules FM which, for example, are stored in a<br><br>
database 310 and can<br><br>
be used to form a function description block FB for the field<br>
device 10. The user selects the function modules FM' which he<br>
requires and uses the configuration software to produce the<br>
appropriate function description block FB, containing the<br>
feature block MB which describes the device function required<br>
for the field device 10. The configuration software 300<br>
preferably processes only correctly signed function modules FM,<br>
in order to ensure that only function modules FM which have<br>
been released by the manufacturer can be used.<br>
In order also to ensure that only function blocks FB and<br>
feature blocks MB which have been tested by the device<br>
manufacturer and classified as reliable and have been processed<br>
further by the device software 3 00 can be used in the field<br>
device, the device software 3 00 contains an encryption module<br>
which carries out an encryption process - for example based on<br>
a hash code - during the production of the function description<br>
block FB and the feature block MB. An encrypted function<br>
description block FB' and an encrypted feature block MB' are<br>
therefore produced on the output side and are checked for<br>
authenticity by the protection module 70 of the field device 10<br>
while the device is being started up.<br>
By way of example, the above statements have been based on the<br>
assumption that one or more permissible device functions which<br>
can subsequently be selected by the user is or are defined in<br>
the identification block KB. Alternatively, for example, it is<br>
also possible to define in the identification block KB one or<br>
more basic functions which can be added by optional additional<br>
functions by the user. The option scope within which the user<br>
can select such options can, for example, be stored in the<br>
identification block KB such that each optional additional<br>
function has an associated value number. At the same time, the<br>
identification block KB defines which total value number the<br>
additional options required by the user may have<br><br>
in total (prepaid function). If the functional scope of the<br>
field device 10 is stored in the described manner in the<br>
identification block KB, then the protection module 70 checks,<br>
after the field device 10 has been started up, whether the<br>
total value of the additional options required by the user is<br>
more than the maximum value defined in the identification block<br>
KB or not. If the total number is more than the predetermined<br>
maximum value, then the protection module 7 0 inhibits the<br>
operation of the field device 10. In this situation, the user<br>
of the field device is forced to ensure by application of a new<br>
function description block FB that a functional scope which is-<br>
permissible for the field device 10 is requested.<br>
Alternatively, the two second keys of the first and second key<br>
pair can also be stored in the main memory 3 0 in the field<br>
device 10 provided that the keys are in turn themselves<br>
encrypted, for example using an X.509 certificate.<br>
By way of example, using the XML format, a feature block MB may<br>
appear as follows:<br><guid val="AJB3FX7hK"></guid><!--- Unique ID of the<br/>
application<br/>

An exemplary embodiment of an identification block KB as shown<br>
in Figure 1 with a variable application (or device function)<br>
