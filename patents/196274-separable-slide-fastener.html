SEPARABLE SLIDE FASTENER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a separable slide fastener which comprises a pair of fastener tapes, a pair of fastener-element assemblies attached to confronting longitudinal edges of the fastener tapes by sewing, each fastener-element assembly having a succession ^f fastener elements molded on a pair of parallel connecting yarns at regular distances and folded individually into a U-shape about each of confronting longitudinal edges of the fastener tapes, and an insertion pin and a box pin attached to bottom end portions of the respective fastener tapes.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art:<br>
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 4-125708 discloses a separable slide fastener which comprises a pair of fastener tapes, a pair of fastener-element assemblies attached to confronting longitudinal edges of the fastener tapes by sewing threads, and a separable bottom stop assembly attached to confronting bottom end portions of the fastener tapes . Each fastener-element assembly is composed of a succession of fastener elements extrusion-molded on a<br><br>
pair of parallel connecting yarns in such a manner that Che connecting yarns are embedded in upper and lower legs , respectively, of the successive fastener elements. The individual fastener elements of each fastener-element assembly are folded in a U-shape about the inner longitudinal edge of the corresponding fastener tape. Each fastener tape has along its inner longitudinal edge a bulged portion to which the legs of the successive fastener elements are attached by the sewing threads. The bottom end portion of each fastener tape is formed by removing several fastener elements .  An insertion pin ol the bottom stop assembly is aittached to the fastener-element-free bottom end portion of one fastener tape, and a box pin is attached to the faatener-element-free bottom end portion of the other fastener tape.<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 7-79815 discloses another separable slide fastener which comprises a pair of fastener tapes, a pair of fastener-element assemblies attached to confronting longitudinal edges of the fastener tapes by sewing threads, and a separable bottom stop assembly attached to confronting bottom end portions of the fastener tapes . Each fastener tape is woven so as to form along its inner longitudinal edge a bulged portion in the form of a woven<br><br>
tube in which a plurality of core yarns are inserted. Each fastener-element assembly is composed of a succession of thermoplastic resin fastener elements extrusion-molded on a pair of parallel connecting yarns and folded individually in a U-shape about the inner longitudinal edge of each fastener tape; upper and lower legs of the fastener element are sewn to the bulged portion so as to clamp the bulged portion between them. An insertion pin of the bottom stop assembly is attached to the bulged bottom end portion of one fastener tape cojitiguously to the lowermost fastener element, and a box pin is attached to the bulged bottom end portion of the othor fnntonor tapo oon t iyviouuly Lo l.ho lowormoiil, fastener element.<br>
In conventional extrusion-molded slide fasteners, since the insertion pin or the box pin of the separable bottom stop assembly is attached to the longitudinal edge of each fastener tape so as to merely cover the sewing threads after cutting the connecting yarns of the fastener-element assembly, stable attachment of the bottom stop assembly members is difficult to achieve so that these members might be removed of the fastener tapes.<br>
A solution has been proposed by the first-named publication.  According to this solution, in an at'tempt<br><br>
to attach the fastener elements to the bulged longitudinal edges of the fastener tapes stably, a pair of grooves are formed in the inner surfaces of the upper and lower legs of each fastener element, and the individual fastener elements are attached to the bulged longitudinal edges of the fastener tapes by sewing with the bulged portion fitted in the grooves of the legs. The bottom end portion of each fastener tape is formed by cutting the connecting yarns to remove several fastener elements, whereupon the insertion pin or the box pin is attached to the element-free bulged portion at the bottom end portion of each fastener tape. With this structure, however, a gap is created at the boundary of the lowermost fastener element and the insertion pin or box pin so that the coupled fastener element rows would tend to split from the boundary.  Further, because of the bulged portion, it is difficult to thread the fastener-element assembly onto the fastener tape edge when sewing the fastener elements to the fastener tape, which is laborious and time-consuming.<br>
According to another solution proposed by the second-named publication, the bulged portion of the fastener tape edge is modified in an attempt to facilitate sewing the fastener-element assembly to the fastener tape edge.  However, because of the core yarns.<br><br>
it is difficult to smoothly thread the fastener-element assembly onto the fastener tape edge so that an improved rate of production cannot be achieved. Further, since the insertion pin or the box pin are attached to the bottom end portion of each fastener tape contiguously to the lowermost fastener element by molding, a gap is created at the boundary between the lowermost fastener element and the insertion pin or box pin so that the coupled fastener element rows would tend to split from the boundary.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A first object of this invention is to provide a separable slide fastener in which an insertion pj.n or a box pin is attached to a bottom end portion of each of opposed fastener tapes firmly in close contact with the lowermost fastener element so that the coupled fastener element rows can be prevented from splitting<br>
Q<br>
and also that sewing of fastener elements of a fastener-element assembly to each fastener tape can be facilitated, improving the rate of production and hence making the slide fastener commercially useful.<br>
A second object of the invention is to provide a separable slide fastener in which an insertion pin and a box pin are attached to the bottom end portions of opposed fastener tapes in a unique manner so as to be<br><br>

A third object of the invention is to provide a separable slide fastener in which successive fastener elements have a unique shape so as to be sewn to each of opposed fastener tapes firmly with tha lowerraoat fastener oloment sewn in a stabilized forni, thus enabling stabilized attachment of the insertion pin and the box pin to the bottom end portions of opposed fastenar tapes.<br>
A fourth object of the invention is to provide a separable slide fastener in which, by specifying the substance of fastener tapes an\ sewing yarns, bottom end portions of opposed fastener tapes are molded in such a form that an insertion pin and a box pin can be attached to the fastener tapes firmly in a simple manner.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRKFEKREU KMOOUIMENTS Preferred embodiments of a separable slide fastener according to this invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the separable slide fastener of thiis invention cdmpris^j^s a pair of fastener tapes 1, a pair of rows of fastener elements 2 attached to confronting longitudinal edges of the respective fastener tapes 1, and a bottom stop assembly 3 attached to confronting bottom end portions of the fastener tapes 1.  The bottom stop assembly 3 is composed of an insertion pin 4 mounted on the bottom end portion of one fastener tape 1, a box pin 5 mounted on the bottom end portion of the other fastener tape 1. and a box 6 mounted on the box pin 5.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the successive fastener elements 2 are molded at regular distances on a pair of parallel connecting yarns 7 by extrusion using thermoplastic resin, such as polyamide, polyacetal and polypropylene, to form a flat fastener-element assembly 8.  Each fastener element 2 has a coupling head 10 and a pair of legs 11 projecting from the coupling head 10 in opposite directions.  The two connecting yarns 7 are embedded in the respective legs 11 on the side toward their outer ends.  Each leg 11 has on its surface a transverse groove<br><br>
12 by the connecting yarn 7 on the side toward the coupling head 10, and in its opposite side surfaces a pair of recesses 13 communication with opposite ends of the transverse groove 12.<br>
As shown in FIG.4, the flat successive fastener elements 2 of fastener-element assembly 8 are folded individually in a U-shape about the coupling head 10 and<br>

fastener tape i and attached to the fastener tape 1 by sewing threads 14 received in the transverse grooves 12 and the recesses 13 of the upper and lower legs 11. Each fastener tape 1 is knitted or woven of thermoplastic synthetic fiber yarns, such as polyamide and polyester, or mixed fiber yarns, which are composed of synthetic fibers and natural fibers. The sewing threads 14 also comprise synthetic fiber yarns or mixed fiber yarns, which are composed of synthetic fibers and natural fibers . It is preferable that the connecting yarns 7 also comprise the same kind of synthetic fiber yarns.<br>
A continuous length of opposed fastener stringers made of the fastener tapes 1 and the fastener-element assemblies 8 is severed into a predetermined length, and several fastener elements 2 are removed from the sewing threads 14 at the bottom end portion of each fastener stringer by cutting the connecting yarns 7 and also<br><br>
cutting the coupling heads 10 of the individual fastener elements 2 , The element-free sewing threads 14 are fused with the fastener tape 1 by ultrasonic welding or other means to form cores 15. The insertion pin 4 or the box pin 5 is attached to the cores 15, during which each of the upper and lower legs 11 of the lowermost fastener element 2 is flatted by ultrasonic processing or other means to form a small-thickness portion 16 with or without cutting the coupling head 10.<br>
As shown in FIG.2, the small-thickness portion 16 hoH a thickness such that, when the insertion pin 4 or the box pin 5 is mounted on the upper and lower small-thickness portions 16, the thickness of the insertion pin 4 or the box pin 5 is equal to that of the coupling head 10 of the lowermost fastener element 2 or that of the next fastener element 2 so that a slider threaded on the opposed fastener stringers are free to slide over the insertion pin 4 and the box pin 5 for separating the slide fastener.<br>
Each of the insertion pin 4 and the box pin 5 is attached to the bottom end portion of the corresponding fastener tape 1 so as to hold the cores 15 (see FIG.4) and the upper and lower small-thickness portions 16 of the lowermost fastener element 2, as shown in FIG. 2. For example, the insertion pin 4, as shown in FIG. 4,<br><br>
is in the form of a metallic elongated box having in one side a key hole 17, in which the cores 15 formed on the bottom end portion of each fastener tape 1 is inserted, and at one end slightly sloping upper and lower tongues 18 for holding the upper and lower small-thickness portions 16. The box pin 5 also is in the form of a metallic elongated box shorter than the insertion pin 4 as shown in FIG.l, and having vertical flat outer surfaces and at one end upper and lower tongues 18 holding the upper and lower small-thickness portions 16. The Dlhnr nnri of th« box pin Tj in IriBorlncI Into niul T I xod to the box 6.<br>
The Insertion pin 4 and tha box pin 5 doucribod in the above are formed of zinc alloy or aluminum alloy by die casting. As shown in FIG. 5, the coupling head 10 of the lowermost fastener element 2 may be cut off with the legs 11 remaining uncut but flatted into upper anl lower small-thickness portions 16, and the insertion pin 4 is closed at the outer side opening between the two tongues 18 and have an engaging projection 19 integrally extending from its upper end for engagement with the lowermost fastener element 2 of the companion ffistener stringer. Alternatively, the box pin 5 and the box 6 may be molded simultaneously and integrally.  The insertion pin 4 and box pin 5 are threaded onto the cores<br><br>
15 of the respective bottom end portions of the opposed fastener tapes 1 and, at the same time, onto the upper and lower small-thickness portions 16, whereupon the front and rear walls of the Insertion pin 4 is clenched against the lowermost fastener element 2 and the cores 15 to hold them as a unit. As a result, the insertion pin 4 is fixed attached to the bottom end portion of one fastener stringer. The box pin 5 also is attached to the bottom end portion of the other fastener stringer in same manner as the insertion pin 4.<br>
In the case shown in FIG. 6, the insertion pin 4 and the box pin 5 are made of thermoplastic resin, such as polyamide, polyacetal and polypropylene. The coupling head 10 of the lowermost fastener element 2 is cut off with the upper and lower legs 11 uncut but flatted into upper and lower small-thickness portions 16, and the insertion pin 4 is formed on the bottom end portion of one fastener stringer by injection-molding thermoplastic resin so as to hold the upper and lower small-thickness portions 16 of the lowermost fastener element 2 and the cores 15 (see FIG.4) integrally.<br>
FIG. 7 shows an alternative form in which the coupling head 10 of the lowermost fastener element 2 and the outer ends of the upper and lower legs 11 ar^ cut off, and the remaining upper and lower legs 11 are flatted<br><br>
into upper and lower small-thickness portions 16 by ultrasonic processing, whereupon the insertion pin 4 is formed on the bottom end portion of one fastener stringer so as to completely cover the upper and lower small-thickness portions 16 by injection-molding thermoplastic resin. The box pin 5 also is formed on the bottom end portion of the other fastener stringer in the same manner as the insertion pin 4.  Thus a tough separable bottom stop assembly 3 is formed.<br>

fastener.<br>
According to the seventh aspect of the invention, since the insertion pin 4 and the box pin 5 are made of metal and attached to the confronting bottom end portions of opposed fastener tapes 2 by clenching, it is possible to attach the insertion pin 4 or the box pin 5 to each fastener tape firmly by simple processing means. Thus a separable slide fastener having a metallic separable bottom stop assembly can be manufactured in a simple manner.<br>
According to the eighth aspect of the invention, since the Insertion pin 4 and the box pin 5 are formed by injection-molding thermoplastic resin, it is possible to attach the insertion pin 4 or the box pin 5 to the bottom end portion of each fastener tapes 1 firmly by simple processing means.
