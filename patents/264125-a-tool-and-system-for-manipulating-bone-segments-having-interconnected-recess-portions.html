COMPRESSOR-DISTRACTOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a hand-held tool for moving bone segments<br>
with respect to each other, such as for example, for arranging a pair of opposing bone<br>
segments to be connected with a bone plate. More particularly, the invention relates to a tool<br>
used first to distract fractured bone segments so they may be properly aligned, and then to compress the aligned segments together so they may be fixed together with an orthopedic<br>
bone plate<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
10002)	The use of bone plates for stablizing fractured bones is widely accepted. The<br>
plates are used by surgeons to stabilize, mend, or align a patient's bones as well as alter<br>
compression of patient's bones, and are typically fastened to the bones with a plurality of<br>
inscteacrs, such as screws that arc installed through holes in the plate.<br>
[0003]	Prior to fixation of a fracture the surgeon typically may manipulate the bone<br>
segments to return them to proper orientation and alignment To accomplish this, the surgeon<br>
may first apply a distraction or separation force to the bone segments, which may cause the<br>
surrounding soft tissue to urge the bone segments bade toward their general pro-fracture<br>
position. The bone segments may then be individually manipulated to achieve a more precise<br>
alignment, followed by the application of a compression force to the segments to press them<br>
together to increase the likelihood that the bone segments will fuse.<br>
[0004]	Thus, there is a need for an instrument that may be used to apply a distraction<br>
or compression force to fractured bones to aid in their alignment and subsequent re-<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0037]	Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown an examplary tool 10 adapted for<br>
distracting or compressing a pair of opposing fractured bone segments. The tool 10 may engage an orthopedic fixation element, such as a bone plate 1000 (FIG. 5A) or bone screw 1100, that is connected to one ofthc pair of segments. The tool 10 may be a generally pliers lite device having an actuating end 100 and a fixation-elements engaging end 200.The<br>
actuating end 100 may comprise a pair of opposed handles 110A, B coupled at pivot portions 130A,B. The fixation-element engaging end 200may comprise apair of engaging arms 220A, B, each having a distal engaging end210A,B configured to engage a separate orthopedic fixation elemeat such as a bone plate, bone screw or guide wire (see FIGS. 5A-5C). Engaging arms 220A,B may further each have a proximal end 222A,B, pivotably associated with a respective distal cod 140 A, B of handles 110A, B so that when the handles are squeezed together, the engaging ends 210A, B spread apart (FIG. 2). Thus, when the engaging ends 2lftA, B are engaged with bone plate 1000 and bone screw 1100 that themselves are each fixed to a respective fractured bone segment 2000,2100, (FIGS. 5A.<br><br>
3e),squeezing the handles 110A,B, together may cause the bone segments to spread apart<br>
Conversely, spreading the handles 110A,B may draw the bone segments together.A biasing<br>
assembly 400 maybe provided to urge the handle 110A, B apart, and a locking assembly<br>
500 may be provided to allow the user to lock the device in a selected position.<br>
[0038J	Handles 110A, 110B may each have a proximal gripping portion 120A, B, a<br>
distal engaging-arm engaging portion 140A, B, and an into mediate pivot portion 130A, B,<br>
The gripping portion mayhaveribsll2A,112Bto facilitate gripping by the user.	The pivot<br>
portions 130A, B may have a transverse hole 142A, B for receiving a fastener150 such as a pin, screw, rivet, etc therethrough to allow the handles to pivot with respect to each other, likewise, the engaging-arm engaging portions 140A,B, may each have a similar transverse hole 144A,B, for receiving a similar fastener 145AfBtopivotaUymgagetheptoximaIcod 222A, B of a respective engaging aim 220A, B.<br>
[0039]	The engaging arms 220A, B may be connected together via a scissors<br>
assembly 300 that operates to maintain the arms 220A, B substantially parallel with respect to each other as they axe opened and closed. This parallel arrangement causes the engaging ends 210A, B to remain in constant alignment with the associated fixation element 1000, 1100 throughout the full range of motion of the instrument 10, thus enhancing the engagement between the instrument 10 and the fixation elements 1000,1100,1200. This arrangement also may allow the user to apply distraction, or compression motion that if substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fractured bone, thus eliminating a potential source of bone segment misalignment in use.<br>
[0040]	Thus, scissor assembly 300 may comprise first and second scissor aims 310,<br>
315 each having a first end 311,316 and a second cud 312,317 and an intermediate pivot portion 313,318. The first ends 311,316 each have a transverse hole 314,319 for receiving a pin 350A, B to pivotably connect the first ends 311,316 to the first and second engaging<br><br>
arms 220A,B, The second ends 3152,317 each have a transversely projecting pin 332A,B<br>
configured to slide within a longitudinal slot 224A,B formed in the first and second engaging<br><br>
arms 220At B. The intermediate pivot portions 313,318 each has a transverse hole for<br>
receiving a pivot pui342, to allow the arms 310,315 to pivot with respect to code other.<br>
Thus arranged, when, the instrument 10 is in the closed position illustrated in FIG. 1, the<br>
scissors assembly 300 assumes a folded position in which transverely projecting pins 332A,,<br>
B art positioned adjacent the proximal end of longitudinal slots 224A, B. When the handles<br>
110A» B arc squeezed together, an opening movement is allied to the engaging arms 220A,<br>
B via fasteners 145A, B, which causes the scissors assembly 300 to open, fixing projecting<br>
pins 332A, B to slide distally within the associated longitudinal slots 224A, B, This opening<br>
movement may continue until the handles are brought fully together or until the pins 332A, B<br>
reach thedistal ends of their associated slots 224A,B, as illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
[0041]	The instrument 10 may be sized and<br>
distraction or compression length. Thus, as illustrated in JIG, 2, the engaging arms 220a, b may have a fully open position in which the arms are separated by a maximum separation distance "mod," as measured between the centerlines of the aims. In one embodiment of the instrument 10 l or use with smaller bones such as the radius, ulna, tibia, etc., the maximum separation distance "mod" may be about 30 mm. In an alternative embodiment of the instrument 10, for use with larger bones such as the femur, the maximum separation distance may be about 60 mm As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the instrument may to scaled to provide any appropriate separation distance, depending on the application for which the instrument is intended.<br>
[0042]	It is noted that although the handles 110A, B, engaging arms 220A, 0, and<br>
scissor mechanism 300 of the instrument 10 may all be illustrated as lying in the same plane, in order to facilitate visualization of the treatment site during distraction and compression, at<br><br>
arms220A,B.<br>
[0043]	likewise, the handles 110A,B maybe divergently flared or curved away from<br>
each other, and the length of slots 224A, B increased, to allow the engaging ends 210A, B to<br>
have a greater length of travel, thus increasing the maximum distance" mod" between the<br>
ends in the fully open position of FIG. 2. It will be apparant that the instrument may be<br>
provided with any appropriate combination of slot lengths and handle configurations to result<br>
in a desired maximum separation distance "mod."<br>
[0044]	As previously noted, a locking mechanism 500 may be provided adjacent to or<br>
within the engaging end 100 to maintain a desired distraction or compression position of the<br>
instrument 10. The locking mechanism 500 may include a spindle or threaded both 510 mounted on the second handle HOB and passing through the first handle 110A. A first internally threaded speed nut 520 may rotatably mounted on the threaded bolt 510 such that movement of the speed nut 510 along the bolt selectively inhibits movement of the first handle HOB away from the second handle 110A and thus maintains the bone portions in the desired distracted position. A second speed nut 530 may also be rotatably mounted on the threaded bolt 510 between the first and second handles 110A, B such that movement of the second speed nut 530 along the bolt selectively inhibits movement of the first handle toward the second handle 110A and thus maintains the bone portions in the desired compressed position,<br>
[0045]	A biasing element 400, such as a pair of leaf springs 410A, B, may further be<br>
provided to maintain handles 110A, B in a "neutral" spaced apart configuration such that engaging ends 210A, B are in the closed position of FIG. 1, ready for insertion through a small incision in the patient Locking mechanism 500 may counteract biasing element 400 as desired.<br><br>
10046]                The instrument 10 may also be provided with a dynamometer or force guage<br>
(not shown) disposed between handles 110A, B to allow the surgeon to preciesly determine<br>
the amount of force being applied to the bone segments using the instrnment ID. This may be important; for example, in determining whether sufficient roanpresave force is bring applied between the ends of the fractured bones to ensure proper healing, or to ensure that too much force is not being applied to the bone segments.<br>
10047]	Referring now to FIGS-4A-4C the engaging ends 210A,B of the<br>
instrument 10 will bo described in greater detail. As shown in FIGS. 4A-4C, the engaging end 210A maycomprise a hook element 212 configured to engage the end surface 1002 or<br>
the bone screw hole 10004, or articulated tensioa device hole 1005 (FIG. 5E) of a bone plate<br>
1000 (WIG. 5A), while engaging end 210B may have s pair of recesses 218; 219 configured<br>
to receive a head portion 1102 of a bone screw 1100 (FIGS. 5A-C) or a section of a surgical<br>
guidewire 1200 (BIG.5D).This arrangement allows the device tobe used to apply a force<br>
between first and second bone segments, where the first bone segment is connected to a bone<br>
plate and the second bone segment is connected to either a bone screw or guide wire.<br>
[0048]	As shown in greater detail in FIG.4B,hook element 212 may be associated<br>
with the distal end 210A of engaging arm 220A. Specifically, hook element 212 maybe connected to, and may extend distally from, the distal end 210A of engaging arm 220A. Hook 212 may have a longitudinally extending shank portion 214 with a transversely extending hook portion 216 disposed at a distal end there, The shank portion 214 may have a proximal end connected to the distal end of the engaging arm 220A. in the illustrated embodiment; the shank 214 is connected to the engaging arm 220A via a pair of machine screws 217,218. Although any appropriate fastener or fastening method may be employed for this connection (the hook could even be made an integral part of the engaging arm 220A), screws provide the advantage of allowing the hook element 216 to be easily replaced if it<br><br>
becomes damaged.<br>
[0049]	The shank portion 214 may have an extention length "I" and a width "sw"<br>
while the hook portion 216 mayhavc a hook width "hw." Generally, die extension length "T"<br>
should be sufficient to allow the shank portion 214 to be pressed against an end 1002 of a<br>
bone plate 1000 (FIG 5A) or within a bone screw hole 1004, or articulated tension device<br>
hole 1005 (FIG. 5D) of the bone plate 1000 (FIG. 5C) without interference from the hook<br>
portico 216. In one embodiment, the extention length "I" is about 7 mm and the shank width<br>
"sw" is about 2.5 mm The hook portion 216 should be sized to allow it to be hooked under<br>
bone plate 1000 (when the instrument is used for distracting against mead of the bone plate)<br>
or to be hooked within hone screw hole 1004, or preformed hole 1005 (FIG. 5D) of the bone<br>
plate 1000 (when the instrument is used for compression) to maintain engagement of the<br>
instrument 10 with the bone plate 1000. In one embodiment; the hook width "hw" may be<br>
about 4.5 mm.<br>
[0050]	As shown in FIGS. 4B and 4C, recessea218 and 219 may be formed in the<br>
lateral wall 226A, B of engaging arm 220B, and may be of substantially similar design so<br>
that a bone screw 1100 or guide wire 1200 may be engaged using either lateral side 226A, B<br>
of file instrument 10. Thus, when the device u used for distraction, recess 218 will engage<br>
the screw/wire 1100,1200, whereas when the device is used for compression, recess 219 will<br>
be engaged with the screw/wire Reference will therefore be made to recess 218 only,<br>
however, all configurations and permutations described in relation to recess 218 should be<br>
understood to apply equally to recess 219.<br>
[0051]	As can be seen in FIGS. 4A and 4B, recess 218 may be comprised of two<br>
interconnected recesses 218a, b. Recess 218a may be configured to receive the head 1102 of<br>
a bone screw 1100 (FIG. 4D), while recess 218b maybe configured to receive a length of<br>
guide wire 1200 since the surgeon may use either a bone screw or guide wire to engage one<br><br>
of the bone segments recess 218a  may have an engaging surface 1218a comprising a width<br>
"rw1"a length "r11" and a maximum depth "rd1" recess 218b likewise may have an <br>
engaging surface 1218b comprising width "rw2" a length "r12" and a maximum depth<br>
"rd2." In one embodiment, width "rw1" may be about 8 mm length "r11" may be about 7<br>
mm and depth "rd1"may be about 4 mm; width "rw2"may be about 3 mm,"r12" may be<br>
about 26 mm and "rd2" maybe about 1.75 mm.<br>
(0052)	la the illustrated embodiment, each of the recesses 218% b, 219a, b comprise<br>
cylindrical sections having a radius of curvature substantially equal to the respective recess<br>
depth "rd1""rd2"  It is noted that although recesses 218a, b are described as having<br>
engaging surfaces 1218a, b comprising the aforementioned configurations and dimentions,	<br>
the instrument 10 may be provided with one or more recesses with engaging surfaces having<br>
any appropriate configuration and size appropriate to engage an appropriate fastener for use<br>
in a distraction or compression operation. Further, recesses having engaging surface shapes<br>
other than the illustrated cylindrical configurations may also be used Additionally, any<br>
combination of recesses having any appropriate engaging surface shape may be used. For<br>
example, the engaging surface of each recess may be flat, triangular, elliptical, etc<br>
[0653]	Moreover, the engaging surfaces 1218a, b may be smooth, or they may have<br>
surface roughenings such as projections, coatings or other surface profilings to increase<br>
engagement between the instrument 10 and an associated bone screw 1100 or guide wire<br>
1200.<br>
[0054]	Additionally, rather than providing a pair of individual recesses, a single<br>
recess maybe provided, such as to engage only a bone screw or to engage only a guide wire.<br>
Likewise, more than two recesses may be provided to engage, for example, individual<br>
multiple bone screws or individual multiple guide wires. Further, the instrument recess or<br>
recesses may be sized and configured to engage a Shant screw or Steinmann pin engaged<br><br>
[00551	Providing a tool 10 having engaging recesses 1218,1219 allows the<br>
instrument to be insetted through a small incision in the skin, since the fastener-engaging<br>
elements do not extend laterally beyond the engaging arms 220A,220B, an arrangement that<br>
would require additional incision length to accommodate. Thus, the present design<br>
minimizes (he ultimate incision required, which in turn reduces the total time required to<br>
perform the procedure, and also reduces scarring. A smaller incision provides a more<br>
vascular injury site, and thus results in a shorter healing time for the affected bone, limiting<br>
tile incision length also reduces disruption of (he periosteum, which is known to facilitate<br>
healing.<br>
[0056]	FIGS. 5A and 5B show the tool 10 engaged with a bone plate 1000 and above<br>
screw 1100 to apply a distraction force between bone segments 2000,2100. Specifically, hook 212 engages end surface 1002 of the bone plate 1000 which is attached to bone segment 2000 while recess 218a engages the head 1102 of the bone screw 1100 which is attached to bone segment 2100. Thus applied, a squeezing force applied to the handles 110% b may cause the engaging ends 210% b of the instrument to separate, thus distracting the bone segments 2000,2100. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 5C, 1he tool 10 is engaged with a bone screw hole 1004 of the bone plate 1000, while the recess 219a engages the head 1102 of die bone screw 1100. In this case, a separating force applied to the handles 110% b may cause the bone segments 2000,2100 to be drawn together (i.e, compressed), FIG. 5D shows the instrument 10 engaged with a length of surgical guide wire 1200 that is engaged with bone segment 2100.<br>
[0057]	With reference to FIGS. 5A-5D, a method of reducing a fracture using the<br>
tool 10 of FIGS. 1-4C is also disclosed. An incision may be made in the patient's skin near the fracture, and a bone plate 1000 may be inserted through the incision so that at least a<br><br>
portion of the plate lies across a portion of each bone segment 2000,2001. The plate may be<br>
fixed to one bone segment 2000 using at least one bone screw 2002 Another bone screw<br>
1100 (or guide wire 1200) maybe driven a portion of the second bone segment 2001 located<br>
a distance "d"away from the end surface 1002 of the plate 1000. The user may then insert<br>
the engaging end 200 of the tool 10 through the incition so that recess 218a engages the head<br>
portion 1002 of bone screw 1100, and the hook portion 212 engeges the end surfece 1002 of<br>
the plate 1000. In this position, the tool may be at or near its fully dosed position (FIG. 1) so<br>
as to permit easy insertion into the incision and engagement with the fixation elements 1000,<br>
1100. The user may then squeeze the handles 110a, b of die tool together to slightly distract<br>
the bone segments. To lock (he tool 10 In this distracted position, speed nut 520 may be<br>
rotated so that it moves along threaded rod 510 md abuts handle 110*<br>
[0058]	This slight distraction may allow the saloon to align bone segments 2000,<br>
2100, and may be particularly helpful when reducing a commulated fracture involving additional smaller bone segments 2300 During the distraction step, the soft tissue surrounding the fracture may act to urge the bone segments back toward their original un-fractured position (i.e. ligamentotaxis). If accessary, forceps or other tools may also be used to realign the bone segments as desired.<br>
[0059]	Once the bone segments have been realigned, the tool 10 may be repositioncd<br>
so that the hook element 212 engages a bone screw hole 1004, or articulated tension device hole 1005 (FIG. 5D), of the plate 1000, and recess 219a engages the head 1102 of bone screw 1100 (or guide wire 1200). The user may then apply a separation force between the handles 110% b to cause the engaging ends 210a, b to come together, thereby forcing the engaged bone fragments 2000,2001 to be compressed together. Again, the tool 10 may be locked in position, this time by turning speed nut 530 along threaded shaft 510 until the nut 530 contacts handle 110a, thus locking the bone segments together until the bone plate can be<br><br>
fixed to bone segment 2100 to fix the segment together permanently. The tool 10 may than<br>
be removed from the incision and additional procedures performed  if required.<br>
