Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to multi-channel	decoding<br>
and, particularly, to multi-channel decoding, in	which at<br>
least two transmission channels are present, i.e.	which is<br>
stereo-compatible.<br>
In recent times, the multi-channel audio reproduction<br>
technique is becoming more and more important. This may be<br>
due to the fact that audio compression/encoding techniques<br>
such as the well-known mp3 technique have made it possible<br>
to distribute audio records via the Internet or other<br>
transmission channels having a limited bandwidth. The mp3<br>
coding technique has become so famous because of the fact<br>
that it allows distribution of all the records in a stereo<br>
format, i.e., a digital representation of the audio record<br>
including a first or left stereo channel and a second or<br>
right stereo channel.<br>
Nevertheless, there are basic shortcomings of conventional<br>
two-channel sound systems. Therefore, the surround<br>
technique has been developed. A recommended multi-channel-<br><br>
surround representation includes, in addition to the two<br>
stereo channels L and R, an additional center channel C and<br>
two surround channels Ls, Rs. This reference sound format<br>
is also referred to as three/two-stereo, which means three<br>
front channels and two surround channels. Generally, five<br>
transmission channels are required. In a playback<br>
environment, at least five speakers at the respective five<br>
different places are needed to get an optimum sweet spot in<br>
a certain distance from the five well-placed loudspeakers.<br>
Several techniques are known in the art for reducing the<br>
amount of data required for transmission of a multi-channel<br>
audio signal. Such techniques are called joint stereo<br>
techniques. To this end, reference is made to Fig. 10,<br>
which shows a joint stereo device 60. This device can be a<br>
device implementing e.g. intensity stereo (IS) or binaural<br>
cue coding (BCC). Such a device generally receives - as an<br>
input - at least two channels (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) , and<br>
outputs a single carrier channel and parametric data. The<br>
parametric data are defined such that, in a decoder, an<br>
approximation of an original channel (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) can<br>
be calculated.<br>
Normally, the carrier channel will include subband samples,<br>
spectral coefficients, time domain samples etc, which<br>
provide a comparatively fine representation of the<br>
underlying signal, while the parametric data do not include<br>
such samples of spectral coefficients but include control<br>
parameters for controlling a certain reconstruction<br>
algorithm such as weighting by multiplication, time<br>
shifting, frequency shifting, ... The parametric data,<br>
therefore, include only a comparatively coarse<br>
representation of the signal or the associated channel.<br><br>
Stated in numbers, the amount of data required by a carrier<br>
channel will be in the range of 60 - 70 kbit/s, while the<br>
amount of data required by parametric side information for<br>
one channel will be in the range of 1,5 - 2,5 kbit/s. An<br>
example for parametric data are the well-known scale<br>
factors, intensity stereo information or binaural cue<br>
parameters as will be described below.<br>
Intensity stereo coding is described in AES preprint 3799,<br>
"Intensity Stereo Coding", J. Herre, K. H. Brandenburg, D.<br>
Lederer, February 1994, Amsterdam. Generally, the concept<br>
of intensity stereo is based on a main axis transform to be<br>
applied to the data of both stereophonic audio channels. If<br>
most of the data points are concentrated around the first<br>
principle axis, a coding gain can be achieved by rotating<br>
both signals by a certain angle prior to coding. This is,<br>
however, not always true for real stereophonic production<br>
techniques. Therefore, this technique is modified by<br>
excluding the second orthogonal component from transmission<br>
in the bit stream. Thus, the reconstructed signals for the<br>
left and right channels consist of differently weighted or<br>
scaled versions of the same transmitted signal.<br>
Nevertheless, the reconstructed signals differ in their<br>
amplitude but are identical regarding their phase<br>
information. The energy-time envelopes of both original<br>
audio channels, however, are preserved by means of the<br>
selective scaling operation, which typically operates in a<br>
frequency selective manner. This conforms to the human<br>
perception of sound at high frequencies, where the dominant<br>
spatial cues are determined by the energy envelopes.<br>
Additionally, in practically implementations, the<br>
transmitted signal, i.e. the carrier channel is generated<br><br>
from the sum signal of the left channel and the right<br>
channel instead of rotating both components. Furthermore,<br>
this processing, i.e., generating intensity stereo<br>
parameters for performing the scaling operation, is<br>
performed frequency selective, i.e., independently for each<br>
scale factor band, i.e., encoder frequency partition.<br>
Preferably, both channels are combined to form a combined<br>
or "carrier" channel, and, in addition to the combined<br>
channel, the intensity stereo information is determined<br>
which depend on the energy of the first channel, the energy<br>
of the second channel or the energy of the combined or<br>
channel.<br>
The BCC technique is described in AES convention paper<br>
5574, "Binaural cue coding applied to stereo and multi-<br>
channel audio compression", C. Faller, F. Baumgarte, May<br>
2002, Munich. In BCC encoding, a number of audio input<br>
channels are converted to a spectral representation using a<br>
DFT based transform with overlapping windows. The resulting<br>
uniform spectrum is divided into non-overlapping partitions<br>
each having an index. Each partition has a bandwidth<br>
proportional to the equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB).<br>
The inter-channel level differences (ICLD) and the inter-<br>
channel time differences (ICTD) are estimated for each<br>
partition for each frame k. The ICLD and ICTD are quantized<br>
and coded resulting in a BCC bit stream. The inter-channel<br>
level differences and inter-channel time differences are<br>
given for each channel relative to a reference channel.<br>
Then, the parameters are calculated in accordance with<br>
prescribed formulae, which depend on the certain partitions<br>
of the signal to be processed.<br><br>
At a decoder-side, the decoder receives a mono signal and<br>
the BCC bit stream. The mono signal is transformed into the<br>
frequency domain and input into a spatial synthesis block,<br>
which also receives decoded ICLD and ICTD values. In the<br>
spatial synthesis block, the BCC parameters (ICLD and ICTD)<br>
values are used to perform a weighting operation of the<br>
mono signal in order to synthesize the multi-channel<br>
signals, which, after a frequency/time conversion,<br>
represent a reconstruction of the original multi-channel<br>
audio signal.<br>
In case of BCC, the joint stereo module 60 is operative to<br>
output the channel side information such that the<br>
parametric channel data are quantized and encoded ICLD or<br>
ICTD parameters, wherein one of the original channels is<br>
used as the reference channel for coding the channel side<br>
information.<br>
Normally, the carrier channel is formed of the sum of the<br>
participating original channels.<br>
Naturally, the above techniques only provide a mono<br>
representation for a decoder, which can only process the<br>
carrier channel, but is not able to process the parametric<br>
data for generating one or more approximations of more than<br>
one input channel.<br>
The audio coding technique known as binaural cue coding<br>
(BCC) is also well described in the United States patent<br>
application publications US 2003, 0219130 A1, 2003/0026441<br>
A1 and 2003/0035553 Al. Additional reference is also made<br>
to "Binaural Cue Coding. Part II: Schemes and<br>
Applications", C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, IEEE Trans. On<br><br>
Audio and Speech Proc, Vol. 11, No. 6, Nov. 2993. The<br>
cited United States patent application publications and the<br>
two cited technical publications on the BCC technique<br>
authored by Faller and Baumgarte are incorporated herein by<br>
reference in their entireties.<br>
In the following, a typical generic BCC scheme for multi-<br>
channel audio coding is elaborated in more detail with<br>
reference to Figures 11 to 13. Figure 11 shows such a<br>
generic binaural cue coding scheme for coding/transmission<br>
of multi-channel audio signals. The multi-channel audio<br>
input signal at an input 110 of a BCC encoder 112 is<br>
downmixed in a downmix block 114. In the present example,<br>
the original multi-channel signal at the input 110 is a 5-<br>
channel surround signal having a front left channel, a<br>
front right channel, a left surround channel, a right<br>
surround channel and a center channel. For example, the<br>
downmix block 114 produces a sum signal by a simple<br>
addition of these five channels into a mono signal. Other<br>
downmixing schemes are known in the art such that, using a<br>
multi-channel input signal, a downmix signal having a<br>
single channel can be obtained. This single channel is<br>
output at a sum signal line 115. A side information<br>
obtained by a BCC analysis block 116 is output at a side<br>
information line 117. In the BCC analysis block, inter-<br>
channel level differences (ICLD), and inter-channel time<br>
differences (ICTD) are calculated as has been outlined<br>
above. Recently, the BCC analysis block 116 has been<br>
enhanced to also calculate inter-channel correlation values<br>
(ICC values) . The sum signal and the side information is<br>
transmitted, preferably in a quantized and encoded form, to<br>
a BCC decoder 120. The BCC decoder decomposes the<br>
transmitted sum signal into a number of subbands and<br><br>
applies scaling, delays and other processing to generate<br>
the subbands of the output multi-channel audio signals.<br>
This processing is performed such that ICLD, ICTD and ICC<br>
parameters (cues) of a reconstructed multi-channel signal<br>
at an output 121 are similar to the respective cues for the<br>
original multi-channel signal at the input 110 into the BCC<br>
encoder 112. To this end, the BCC decoder 120 includes a<br>
BCC synthesis block 122 and a side information processing<br>
block 123.<br>
In the following, the internal construction of the BCC<br>
synthesis block 122 is explained with reference to Fig. 12.<br>
The sum signal on line 115 is input into a time/frequency<br>
conversion unit or filter bank FB 125. At the output of<br>
block 125, there exists a number N of sub band signals or,<br>
in an extreme case, a block of a spectral coefficients,<br>
when the audio filter bank 125 performs a 1:1 transform,<br>
i.e., a transform which produces N spectral coefficients<br>
from N time domain samples.<br>
The BCC synthesis block 122 further comprises a delay stage<br>
126, a level modification stage 127, a correlation<br>
processing stage 128 and an inverse filter bank stage IFB<br>
129. At the output of stage 129, the reconstructed multi-<br>
channel audio signal having for example five channels in<br>
case of a 5-channel surround system, can be output to a set<br>
of loudspeakers 124 as illustrated in Fig. 11.<br>
As shown in Fig. 12, the input signal s (n) is converted<br>
into the frequency domain or filter bank domain by means of<br>
element 125. The signal output by element 125 is multiplied<br>
such that several versions of the same signal are obtained<br>
as illustrated by multiplication node 130. The number of<br><br>
versions of the original signal is equal to the number of<br>
output channels in the output signal, to be reconstructed<br>
When, in general, each version of the original signal at<br>
node 130 is subjected to a certain delay d1, d2, .., di, ...,<br>
dN. The delay parameters are computed by the side<br>
information processing block 123 in Fig. 11 and are derived<br>
from the inter-channel time differences as determined by<br>
the BCC analysis block 116.<br>
The same is true for the multiplication parameters a1, a2,<br>
..., a1, ..., aN, which are also calculated by the side<br>
information processing block 123 based on the inter-channel<br>
level differences as calculated by the BCC analysis block<br>
116.<br>
The ICC parameters calculated by the BCC analysis block 116<br>
are used for controlling the functionality of block 128<br>
such that certain correlations between the delayed and<br>
level-manipulated signals are obtained at the outputs of<br>
block 128. It is to be noted here that the order between<br>
the stages 126, 127, 128 may be different from the case<br>
shown in Fig. 12.<br>
It is to be noted here that, in a frame-wise processing of<br>
an audio signal, the BCC analysis is performed frame-wise,<br>
i.e. time-varying, and also frequency-wise. This means<br>
that, for each spectral band, the BCC parameters are<br>
obtained. This means that, in case the audio filter bank<br>
125 decomposes the input signal into for example 32 band<br>
pass signals, the BCC analysis block obtains a set of BCC<br>
parameters for each of the 32 bands. Naturally the BCC<br>
synthesis block 122 from Fig. 11, which is shown in detail<br><br>
in Fig. 12, performs a reconstruction which is also based<br>
on the 32 bands in the example.<br>
In the following, reference is made to Fig. 13 showing a<br>
setup to determine certain BCC parameters. Normally, ICLD,<br>
ICTD and ICC parameters can be defined between pairs of<br>
channels. However, it is preferred to determine ICLD and<br>
ICTD parameters between a reference channel and each other<br>
channel. This is illustrated in Fig. 13A.<br>
ICC parameters can be defined in different ways. Most<br>
generally, one could estimate ICC parameters in the encoder<br>
between all possible channel pairs as indicated in Fig.<br>
13B. In this case, a decoder would synthesize ICC such that<br>
it is approximately the same as in the original multi-<br>
channel signal between all possible channel pairs. It was,<br>
however, proposed to estimate only ICC parameters between<br>
the strongest two channels at each time. This scheme is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 13C, where an example is shown, in<br>
which at one time instance, an ICC parameter is estimated<br>
between channels 1 and 2, and, at another time instance, an<br>
ICC parameter is calculated between channels 1 and 5. The<br>
decoder then synthesizes the inter-channel correlation<br>
between the strongest channels in the decoder and applies<br>
some heuristic rule for computing and synthesizing the<br>
inter-channel coherence for the remaining channel pairs.<br>
Regarding the calculation of, for example, the<br>
multiplication parameters a1, aN based on transmitted ICLD<br>
parameters, reference is made to AES convention paper 5574<br>
cited above. The ICLD parameters represent an energy<br>
distribution in an original multi-channel signal. Without<br>
loss of generality, it is shown in Fig. 13A that there are<br><br>
four ICLD parameters showing the energy difference between<br>
all other channels and the front left channel. In the side<br>
information processing block 123, the multiplication<br>
parameters a1, ..., aN are derived from the ICLD parameters<br>
such that the total energy of all reconstructed output<br>
channels is the same as (or proportional to) the energy of<br>
the transmitted sum signal. A simple way for determining<br>
these parameters is a 2-stage process, in which, in a first<br>
stage, the multiplication factor for the left front channel<br>
is set to unity, while multiplication factors for the<br>
other channels in Fig. 13A are set to the transmitted ICLD<br>
values. Then, in a second stage, the energy of all five<br>
channels is calculated and compared to the energy of the<br>
transmitted sum signal. Then, all channels are downscaled<br>
using a downscaling factor which is equal for all channels,<br>
wherein the downscaling factor is selected such that the<br>
total energy of all reconstructed output channels is, after<br>
downscaling, equal to the total energy of the transmitted<br>
sum signal.<br>
Naturally, there are other methods for calculating the<br>
multiplication factors, which do not rely on the 2-stage<br>
process but which only need a 1-stage process.<br>
Regarding the delay parameters, it is to be noted that the<br>
delay parameters ICTD, which are transmitted from a BCC<br>
encoder can be used directly, when the delay parameter d1<br>
for the left front channel is set to zero. No rescaling has<br>
to be done here, since a delay does not alter the energy of<br>
the signal.<br>
Regarding the inter-channel coherence measure ICC<br>
transmitted from the BCC encoder to the BCC decoder, it is<br><br>
to be noted here that a coherence manipulation can be done<br>
by modifying the multiplication factors a1, ..., an such as by<br>
multiplying the weighting factors of all subbands with<br>
random numbers with a range of [20log10(-6) and<br>
201ogl0(6)]. The pseudo-random sequence is preferably<br>
chosen such that the variance is approximately constant for<br>
all critical bands, and the average is zero within each<br>
critical band. The same sequence is applied to the spectral<br>
coefficients for each different frame. Thus, the auditory<br>
image width is controlled by modifying the variance of the<br>
pseudo-random sequence. A larger variance creates a larger<br>
image width. The variance modification can be performed in<br>
individual bands that are critical-band wide. This enables<br>
the simultaneous existence of multiple objects in an<br>
auditory scene, each object having a different image width.<br>
A suitable amplitude distribution for the pseudo-random<br>
sequence is a uniform distribution on a logarithmic scale<br>
as it is outlined in the US patent application publication<br>
2003/0219130 A1. Nevertheless, all BCC synthesis processing<br>
is related to a single input channel transmitted as the sum<br>
signal from the BCC encoder to the BCC decoder as shown in<br>
Fig. 11.<br>
To transmit the five channels in a compatible way, i.e., in<br>
a bitstream format, which is also understandable for a<br>
normal stereo decoder, the so-called matrixing technique<br>
has been used as described in "MUSICAM surround: a<br>
universal multi-channel coding system compatible with ISO<br>
11172-3", G. Theile and G. Stoll, AES preprint 3403,<br>
October 1992, San Francisco. The five input channels L, R,<br>
C, Ls, and Rs are fed into a matrixing device performing a<br>
matrixing operation to calculate the basic or compatible<br>
stereo channels Lo, Ro, from the five input channels. In<br><br>
particular, these basic stereo channels Lo/Ro are<br>
calculated as set out below:<br><br>
x and y are constants. The other three channels C, Ls, Rs<br>
are transmitted as they are in an extension layer, in<br>
addition to a basic stereo layer, which includes an encoded<br>
version of the basic stereo signals Lo/Ro. With respect to<br>
the bitstream, this Lo/Ro basic stereo layer includes a<br>
header, information such as scale factors and subband<br>
samples. The multi-channel extension layer, i.e., the<br>
central channel and the two surround channels are included<br>
in the multi-channel extension field, which is also called<br>
ancillary data field.<br>
At a decoder-side, an inverse matrixing operation is<br>
performed in order to form reconstructions of the left and<br>
right channels in the five-channel representation using the<br>
basic stereo channels Lo, Ro and the three additional<br>
channels. Additionally, the three additional channels are<br>
decoded from the ancillary information in order to obtain a<br>
decoded five-channel or surround representation of the<br>
original multi-channel audio signal.<br>
Another approach for multi-channel encoding is described in<br>
the publication "Improved MPEG-2 audio multi-channel<br>
encoding", B. Grill, J. Herre, K. H. Brandenburg, E.<br>
Eberlein, J. Roller, J. Mueller, AES preprint 3865,<br>
February 1994, Amsterdam, in which, in order to obtain<br>
backward compatibility, backward compatible modes are<br><br>
considered. To this end, a compatibility matrix is used to<br>
obtain two so-called downmix channels Lc, Rc from the<br>
original five input channels. Furthermore, it is possible<br>
to dynamically select the three auxiliary channels<br>
transmitted as ancillary data.<br>
In order to exploit stereo irrelevancy, a joint stereo<br>
technique is applied to groups of channels, e. g. the three<br>
front channels, i.e., for the left channel, the right<br>
channel and the center channel. To this end, these three<br>
channels are combined to obtain a combined channel. This<br>
combined channel is quantized and packed into the<br>
bitstream. Then, this combined channel together with the<br>
corresponding joint stereo information is input into a<br>
joint stereo decoding module to obtain joint stereo decoded<br>
channels, i.e., a joint stereo decoded left channel, a<br>
joint stereo decoded right channel and a joint stereo<br>
decoded center channel. These joint stereo decoded channels<br>
are, together with the left surround channel and the right<br>
surround channel input into a compatibility matrix block to<br>
form the first and the second downmix channels Lc, Re.<br>
Then, quantized versions of both downmix channels and a<br>
quantized version of the combined channel are packed into<br>
the bitstream together with joint stereo coding parameters.<br>
Using intensity stereo coding, therefore, a group of<br>
independent original channel signals is transmitted within<br>
a single portion of "carrier" data. The decoder then<br>
reconstructs the involved signals as identical data, which<br>
are rescaled according to their original energy-time<br>
envelopes. Consequently, a linear combination of the<br>
transmitted channels will lead to results, which are quite<br>
different from the original downmix. This applies to any<br><br>
kind of joint stereo coding based on the intensity stereo<br>
concept. For a coding system providing compatible downmix<br>
channels, there is a direct consequence: The reconstruction<br>
by dematrixing, as described in the previous publication,<br>
suffers from artifacts caused by the imperfect<br>
reconstruction. Using a so-called joint stereo<br>
predistortion scheme, in which a joint stereo coding of the<br>
left, the right and the center channels is performed before<br>
matrixing in the encoder, alleviates this problem. In this<br>
way, the dematrixing scheme for reconstruction introduces<br>
fewer artifacts, since, on the encoder-side, the joint<br>
stereo decoded signals have been used for generating the<br>
downmix channels. Thus, the imperfect reconstruction<br>
process is shifted into the compatible downmix channels Lc<br>
and Rc, where it is much more likely to be masked by the<br>
audio signal itself.<br>
Although such a system has resulted in fewer artifacts<br>
because of dematrixing on the decoder-side, it nevertheless<br>
has some drawbacks. A drawback is that the stereo-<br>
compatible downmix channels Lc and Rc are derived not from<br>
the original channels but from intensity stereo<br>
coded/decoded versions of the original channels. Therefore,<br>
data losses because of the intensity stereo coding system<br>
are included in the compatible downmix channels. A stereo-<br>
only decoder, which only decodes the compatible channels<br>
rather than the enhancement intensity stereo encoded<br>
channels, therefore, provides an output signal, which is<br>
affected by intensity stereo induced data losses.<br>
Additionally, a full additional channel has to be<br>
transmitted besides the two downmix channels. This channel<br>
is the combined channel, which is formed by means of joint<br><br>
stereo coding of the left channel, the right channel and<br>
the center channel. Additionally, the intensity stereo<br>
information to reconstruct the original channels L, R, C<br>
from the combined channel also has to be transmitted to the<br>
decoder. At the decoder, an inverse matrixing, i.e., a<br>
dematrixing operation is performed to derive the surround<br>
channels from the two downmix channels. Additionally, the<br>
original left, right and center channels are approximated<br>
by joint stereo decoding using the transmitted combined<br>
channel and the transmitted joint stereo parameters. It is<br>
to be noted that the original left, right and center<br>
channels are derived by joint stereo decoding of the<br>
combined channel.<br>
An enhancement of the BCC scheme shown in Figure 11 is a<br>
BCC scheme with at least two audio transmission channels so<br>
that a stereo-compatible processing is obtained. In the<br>
encoder, C input channels are downmixed to E transmit audio<br>
channels. The ICTD, ICLD and ICC cues between certain pairs<br>
of input channels are estimated as a function of frequency<br>
and time. The estimated cues are transmitted to the decoder<br>
as side information. A BCC scheme with C input channels and<br>
E transmission channels is denoted^ C-2-E BCC.<br>
Generally speaking, BCC processing is a frequency<br>
selective, time variant post processing of the transmitted<br>
channels. In the following, with the implicit understanding<br>
of this, a frequency band index will not be introduced.<br>
Instead, variables like xn, sn, yn, an, etc. are assumed to<br>
be vectors with dimension (1,f), wherein f denotes the<br>
number of frequency bands.<br><br>
The so-called regular BCC scheme is described in C. Faller<br>
and F. Baumgarte, "Binaural Cue Coding applied to stereo<br>
and multi-channel audio compression," in Preprint 112th<br>
Conv. Aud. Engl. Soc. , May 2002, F. Baumgarte and C.<br>
Faller, "Binaural Cue Coding - Part I: Psychoacoustic<br>
fundamentals and design principles," IEEE Trans. On Speech<br>
and Audio Proc, vol. 11, no. 6, Nov. 2003, and C. Faller<br>
and F. Baumgarte, "Binaural Cue Coding - Part II; Schemes<br>
and applications," IEEE Trans. On Speech and Audio Proc,<br>
vol. 11, no. 6, Nov. 2003. Here, one has a single<br>
transmitted audio channel as shown in Fig. 11, is a<br>
backwards compatible extension of existing mono systems for<br>
stereo or multi-channel audio playback. Since the<br>
transmitted single audio channel is a valid mono signal, it<br>
is suitable for playback by legacy receivers.<br>
However, most of the installed audio broadcasting infra-<br>
structure (analog and digital radio, television, etc.) and<br>
audio storage systems (vinyl discs, compact cassette,<br>
compact disc, VHS video, MP3 sound storage, etc.) are based<br>
on two-channel stereo. On the other hand, "home theater<br>
systems" conforming to the 5.1 standard (Rec. ITU-R BS.775,<br>
Multi-Channel Stereophonic Sound System with or without<br>
Accompanying Picture, ITU, 1993, http://www.itu.org) are<br>
becoming more popular. Thus, BCC with two transmission<br>
channels (C-to-2 BCC), as it is described in J. Herre, C.<br>
Faller, C. Ertel, J. Hilpert, A. Hoelzer, and C. Spenger,<br>
"MP3 Surround: Efficient and compatible coding of multi-<br>
channel audio," in Preprint 116th Conv. Aud. Eng. Soc, May<br>
2004, is particularly interesting for extending the<br>
existing stereo systems for multi-channel surround. In this<br>
connection, reference is also made to US patent application<br>
"Apparatus and method for constructing a multi-channel<br><br>
output signal or for generating a downmix signal", US<br>
serial number 10/762,100, filed on January 20, 2004.<br>
In the analog domain, matrixing algorithms such as "Dolby<br>
Surround", "Dolby Pro Logic", and "Dolby Pro Logic II" (J.<br>
Hull, "Surround sound past, present, and future," Techn.<br>
Rep., Dolby Laboratories, 1999, www.dolby.com/tech/; R.<br>
Dressier, "Dolby Surround Prologic II Decoder - Principles<br>
of operation," Techn Rep., Dolby Laboratories, 2000,<br>
www.dolby.com/tech/) have been popular for years. Such<br>
algorithms apply "matrixing" for mapping the 5.1 audio<br>
channels to a stereo compatible channel pair. However,<br>
matrixing algorithms only provide significantly reduced<br>
flexibility and quality compared to discrete audio channels<br>
as it is outlined in J. Herre, C. Faller, C. Ertel, J.<br>
Hilpert, A. Hoelzer, and C. Spenger, "MP3 Surround:<br>
Efficient and compatible coding of multi-channel audio," in<br>
Preprint 116th Conv. Aud. Eng. Soc, May 2004. If<br>
limitations of matrixing algorithms are already considered<br>
when mixing audio signals for 5.1 surround, some of the<br>
effects of this imperfection can be reduced as it is<br>
outlined in J. Hilson, "Mixing with Dolby Pro Logic II<br>
Technology," Tech. Rep., Dolby Laboratories, 2004,<br>
www.dolby.com/tech/PLII.Mixing.JimHilson.html.<br>
C-to-2 BCC can be viewed as a scheme with similar<br>
functionality as a matrixing algorithm with additional<br>
helper side information. It is, however, more general in<br>
its nature, since it supports mapping from any number of<br>
original channels to any number of transmitted channels. C-<br>
to-E BCC is intended for the digital domain and its low<br>
bitrate additional side information usually can be included<br>
into the existing data transmission in a backwards<br><br>
compatible way. This means that legacy receivers will<br>
ignore the additional side information and play back the 2<br>
transmitted channels directly as it is outlined in J.<br>
Herre, C. Faller, C. Ertel, J. Hilpert, A. Hoelzer, and C.<br>
Spenger, "MP3 Surround: Efficient and compatible coding of<br>
multi-channel audio," in Preprint 116th Conv. Aud. Eng.<br>
Soc, May 2004. The ever-lasting goal is to achieve an<br>
audio quality similar to a discrete transmission of all<br>
original audio channels, i.e. significantly better quality<br>
than what can be expected from a conventional matrixing<br>
algorithm.<br>
In the following, reference is made to Fig. 6a in order to<br>
illustrate the conventional encoder downmix operation to<br>
generate two transmission channels from five input<br>
channels, which are a left channel L or x1, a right channel<br>
R or x2, a center channel C or x3, a left surround channel<br>
sL or x4 and a right surround channel sR or x5. The downmix<br>
situation is schematically shown in Fig 6a. It becomes<br>
clear that the first transmission channel y1 is formed<br>
using a left channel X1, a center channel x3 and the left<br>
surround channel x4. Additionally, Fig. 6a makes clear that<br>
the right transmission channel y2 is formed using the right<br>
channel x2, the center channel x3 and the right surround<br>
channel x5.<br>
The generally preferred downmixing rule or downmixing<br>
matrix is shown in Fig. 6c. It becomes clear that the<br>
center channel x3 is weighted by a weighting factor 1 /√2,<br>
which means that the first half of the energy of the center<br>
channel x3 is put into the left transmission channel or<br>
first transmission channel Lt, while the second half of the<br>
energy in the center channel is introduced into the second<br><br>
transmission channel or right transmission channel Rt.<br>
Thus, the downmix maps the input channels to the<br>
transmitted channels. The downmix is conveniently described<br>
by a (m,n) matrix, mapping n input samples to m output<br>
samples. The entries of this matrix are the weights applied<br>
to the corresponding channels before summing up to form the<br>
related output channel.<br>
There exist different downmix methods which can be found in<br>
the ITU recommendations (Rec. ITU-R BS.775, Multi-Channel<br>
Stereophonic Sound System with or without Accompanying<br>
Picture, ITU, 1993, http://www.itu.org). Additionally,<br>
reference is made to J. Herre, C. Faller, C. Ertel, J.<br>
Hilpert, A. Hoelzer, and C. Spenger, "MP3 Surround:<br>
Efficient and compatible coding of multi-channel audio," in<br>
Preprint 116th Conv. Aud. Eng. Soc. , May 2004, Section 4.2<br>
with respect to different downmix methods. The downmix can<br>
be performed either in time or in frequency domain. It<br>
might be time varying in a signal adaptive way or frequency<br>
(band) dependent. The channel assignment is shown by the<br>
matrix to the right of Fig. 6a and is given as follows:<br><br>
So, for the important case of 5-to-2 BCC, one transmitted<br>
channel is computed from right, rear right and center, and<br>
the other transmitted channel from left, rear left and<br>
center, corresponding to a downmixing matrix for example of<br><br><br>
which is also shown in Fig. 6c.<br>
In this downmix matrix, the weighting factors can be chosen<br>
such that the sum of the square of the values in each<br>
column is one, such that the power of each input signal<br>
contributes equally to the downmixed signals. Of course<br>
other downmixing schemes could be used as well.<br>
In particular, reference is made to Fig. 6b or 7b, which<br>
shows a specific implementation of an encoder downmixing<br>
scheme. Processing for one subband is shown. In each<br>
subband, the scaling factors e1 and e2 are controlled to<br>
"equalize" the loudness of the signal components in the<br>
downmixed signal. In this case, the downmix is performed in<br>
frequency domain, with the variable n (Fig. 7b) designating<br>
a frequency domain subband time index and k being the index<br>
of the transformed time domain signal block. Particularly,<br>
attention is drawn to the weighting device for weighting<br>
the center channel before the weighted version of the<br>
center channel is introduced into the left transmission<br>
channel and the right transmission channel by the<br>
respective summing devices.<br>
The corresponding upmix operation in the decoder is shown<br>
with respect to Figs. 7a, 7b and 7c. In the decoder an<br>
upmix has to be calculated, which maps the transmitted<br>
channel to the output channels. The upmix is conveniently<br>
described by a (i,j) matrix (i rows, j columns), mapping i<br>
transmitted samples to j output samples. Once again, the<br>
entries of this matrix are the weights applied to the<br><br>
corresponding channels before summing up to form the<br>
related output channel. The upmix can be performed either<br>
in time or in frequency domain. Additionally, it might be<br>
time varying in a signal-adaptive way or frequency (band)<br>
dependent. As opposed to the downmix matrix, the absolute<br>
values of the matrix entries do not represent the final<br>
weights of the output channels, since these upmixed<br>
channels are further modified in case of BCC processing. In<br>
particular, the modification takes place using the<br>
information provided by the spatial cues like ICLD, etc.<br>
Here in this example, all entries are either set to 0 or 1.<br>
Fig. 7a shows the upmixing situation for a 5-speaker<br>
surround system. Besides each speaker, the base channel<br>
used for BCC synthesis is shown. In particular, with<br>
respect to the left surround output channel, a first<br>
transmitted channel y1 is used. The same is true for the<br>
left channel. This channel is used as a base channel, also<br>
termed the "left transmitted channel".<br>
As to the right output channel and the right surround<br>
output channel, they also use the same channel, i.e. the<br>
second or right transmitted channel y2. As to the center<br>
channel, it is to be noted here that the base channel for<br>
BCC center channel synthesis is formed in accordance with<br>
the upmixing matrix shown in Fig. 7c, i.e. by adding both<br>
transmitted channels.<br>
The process of generating the 5-channel output signal,<br>
given the two transmitted channels is shown in Fig. 7b.<br>
Here, the upmix is done in frequency domain with the<br>
variable n denoting a frequency domain subband time index,<br>
and k being the index of the transformed time domain signal<br><br>
block. It is to be noted here that ICTD and ICC synthesis<br>
is applied between channel pairs for which the same base<br>
channel is used, i.e., between left and rear left, and<br>
between right and rear right, respectively. The two blocks<br>
denoted A in Fig. 7b includes schemes for 2-channel ICC<br>
synthesis.<br>
The side information estimated at the encoder, which is<br>
necessary for computing all parameters for the decoder<br>
output signal synthesis includes the following cues: ∆L12,<br>
∆L13, ∆L14, ∆L15, τin, τ25, C14, and C25 ∆Lij is the level<br>
difference between channel i and j, τij is the time<br>
difference between channel i and j, and Cij is a correlation<br>
coefficient between channel i and j) . It is to be noted<br>
here that other level differences can also be used. The<br>
requirement exists that enough information is available at<br>
the decoder for computing e.g. the scale factors, delays<br>
etc. for BCC synthesis.<br>
In the following, reference is made to Fig. 7d in order to<br>
further illustrate the level modification for each channel,<br>
i.e. the calculation of ai and the subsequent overall<br>
normalization, which is not shown in Fig. 7b. Preferably,<br>
inter-channel level differences ∆Li are transmitted as side<br>
information, i.e. as ICLD. Applied to a channel signal, one<br>
has to use the exponential relation between the reference<br>
channel Fref and a channel to be calculated, i.e. Fj.. This<br>
is shown at the top of Fig. 7d.<br>
What is not shown in Fig. 7b is the subsequent or final<br>
overall normalization, which can take place before the<br>
correlation blocks A or after the correlation blocks A.<br>
When the correlation blocks affect the energy of the<br><br>
channels weighted by ai, the overall normalization should<br>
take place after the correlation blocks A. To make sure<br>
that the energy of all output channels is equal to the<br>
energy of all transmitted channels, the reference channel<br>
is scaled as shown in Fig. 7d. Preferably, the reference<br>
channel is the root of the sum of the squared transmitted<br>
channels.<br>
In the following, the problems associated with	these<br>
downmixing/upmixing schemes are described. When the	5-to-2<br>
BCC scheme as illustrated in Fig. 6 and Fig.	7 is<br>
considered, the following becomes clear.<br>
The original center channel is introduced into both<br>
transmitted channels and, consequently, also into the<br>
reconstructed left and right output channels.<br>
Additionally, in this scheme, the common center<br>
contribution has the same amplitude in both reconstructed<br>
output channels.<br>
Furthermore, the original center signal is replaced during<br>
decoding by a center signal, which is derived from the<br>
transmitted left and right channels and, thus, cannot be<br>
independent from (i.e. uncorrelated to) the reconstructed<br>
left and right channels.<br>
This effect has unfavorable consequences on the perceived<br>
sound quality for signals with a very wide sound image<br>
which is characterized by a high degree of decorrelation<br>
(i.e. low coherence) between all audio channels. An example<br>
for such signals is the sound of an applauding audience,<br>
when using different microphones with a wide enough spacing<br><br>
for generating the original multi-channel signals. For such<br>
signals, the sound image of the decoded sound becomes<br>
narrower and its natural wideness is reduced.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
higher-quality multi-channel reconstruction concept which<br>
results in a multi-channel output signal having an improved<br>
sound perception.<br>
In accordance with the first aspect of this invention, this<br>
object is achieved by an apparatus for generating a multi-<br>
channel output signal having K output channels, the multi-<br>
channel output signal corresponding to a multi-channel<br>
input signal having C input channels, using E transmission<br>
channels, the E transmission channels representing a result<br>
of a downmix operation having C input channels as an input,<br>
and using parametric side information related to the input<br>
channels, wherein E is ≥ 2, C is &gt; E, and K is &gt; 1 and ≤ C,<br>
and wherein the downmix operation is effective to introduce<br>
a first input channel in a first transmission channel and<br>
in a second transmission channel, and to additionally<br>
introduce a second input channel in the first transmission<br>
channel, comprising: a cancellation channel calculator for<br>
calculating a cancellation channel using information<br>
related to the first input channel included in the first<br>
transmission channel, the second transmission channel or<br>
the parametric side information; a combiner for combining<br>
the cancellation channel and the first transmission channel<br>
or a processed version thereof to obtain a second base<br>
channel, in which an influence of the first input channel<br><br>
is reduced compared to the influence of the first input<br>
channel on the first transmission channel; and a channel<br>
reconstructor for reconstructing a second output channel<br>
corresponding to the second input channel using the second<br>
base channel and parametric side information related to the<br>
second input channel, and for reconstructing a first output<br>
channel corresponding to the first input channel using a<br>
first base channel being different from the second base<br>
channel in that the influence of the first channel is<br>
higher compared to the second base channel, and parametric<br>
side information related to the first input channel.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present<br>
invention, this object is achieved by a method of<br>
generating a multi-channel output signal having K output<br>
channels, the multi-channel output signal corresponding to<br>
a multi-channel input signal having C input channels, using<br>
E transmission channels, the E transmission channels<br>
representing a result of a downmix operation having C input<br>
channels as an input, and using parametric side information<br>
related to the input channels, wherein E is ≥ 2, C is &gt; E,<br>
and K is &gt; 1 and ≤ C, and wherein the downmix operation is<br>
effective to introduce a first input channel in a first<br>
transmission channel and in a second transmission channel,<br>
and to additionally introduce a second input channel in the<br>
first transmission channel, comprising: calculating a<br>
cancellation channel using information related to the first<br>
input channel included in the first transmission channel,<br>
the second transmission channel or the parametric side<br>
information; combining the cancellation channel and the<br>
first transmission channel or a processed version thereof<br>
to obtain a second base channel, in which an influence of<br>
the first input channel is reduced compared to the<br><br>
influence of the first input channel on the first<br>
transmission channel; and reconstructing a second output<br>
channel corresponding to the second input channel using the<br>
second base channel and parametric side information related<br>
to the second input channel, and a first output channel<br>
corresponding to the first input channel using a first base<br>
channel being different from the second base channel in<br>
that the influence of the first channel is higher compared<br>
to the second base channel, and parametric side information<br>
related to the first input channel.<br>
In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention,<br>
this object is achieved by a computer program having a<br>
program code for performing the method for generating a<br>
multi-channel output signal, when the program runs on a<br>
computer.<br>
It is to be noted here, that preferably, K is equal to C.<br>
Nevertheless, one could also reconstruct less output<br>
channels, such as three output channels L,R,C and not<br>
reconstructing Ls and Rs. In this case, the K (=3) output<br>
channels correspond to three of the original C (=5) input<br>
channels L,R,C.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that, for<br>
improving sound quality of the multi-channel output signal,<br>
a certain base channel is calculated by combining a<br>
transmitted channel and a cancellation channel, which is<br>
calculated at the receiver or decoder-end. The cancellation<br>
channel is calculated such that the modified base channel<br>
obtained by combining the cancellation channel and the<br>
transmitted channel has a reduced influence of the center<br>
channel, i.e. the channel which is introduced into both<br><br>
transmission channels. Stated in other words, the influence<br>
of the center channel, i.e. the channel which is introduced<br>
into both transmission channels, which inevitably occurs<br>
when downmixing and subsequent upmixing operations are<br>
performed, is reduced compared to a situation in which no<br>
such cancellation channel is calculated and combined to a<br>
transmission channel.<br>
In contrast to the prior art, for example the left<br>
transmission channel is not simply used as the base channel<br>
for reconstructing the left or the left surround channel.<br>
In contrast thereto, the left transmission channel is<br>
modified by combining with the cancellation channel so that<br>
the influence of the original center input channel in the<br>
base channel for reconstructing the left or the right<br>
output channel is reduced or even completely cancelled.<br>
Inventively, the cancellation channel is calculated at the<br>
decoder using information on the original center channel<br>
which are already present at the decoder or multi-channel<br>
output generator. Information on the center channel is<br>
included in the left transmitted channel, the right<br>
transmitted channel and the parametric side information<br>
such as in level differences, time differences or<br>
correlation parameters for the center channel. Depending on<br>
certain embodiments, all this information can be used to<br>
obtain a high-quality center channel cancellation. In other<br>
more low level embodiments, however, only a part of this<br>
information on the center input channel is used. This<br>
information can be the left transmission channel, the right<br>
transmission channel or the parametric side information.<br>
Additionally, one can also use information estimated in the<br>
encoder and transmitted to the decoder.<br><br>
Thus, in a 5-to-2 environment, the left transmitted channel<br>
or the right transmitted channel are not used directly for<br>
the left and right reconstruction but are modified by being<br>
combined with the cancellation channel to obtain a modified<br>
base channel, which is different from the corresponding<br>
transmitted channel. Preferably, an additional weighting<br>
factor, which will depend on the downmixing operation<br>
performed at an encoder to generate the transmission<br>
channels is also included in the cancellation channel<br>
calculation. In a 5-to-2 environment, at least two<br>
cancellation channels are calculated so that each<br>
transmission channel can be combined with a designated<br>
cancellation channel to obtain modified base channels for<br>
reconstructing the left and the left surround output<br>
channels, and the right and right surround output channels,<br>
respectively.<br>
The present invention may be incorporated into a number of<br>
systems or applications including, for example, digital<br>
video players, digital audio players, computers, satellite<br>
receivers, cable receivers, terrestrial broadcast<br>
receivers, and home entertainment systems.<br><br>

Before a detailed description of preferred embodiments will<br>
be given, the problem underlying the invention and the<br>
solution to the problem are described in general terms. The<br><br>
inventive technique for improving the auditory spatial<br>
image width for reconstructed output channels is applicable<br>
to all cases when an input channel is mixed into more than<br>
one of the transmitted channels in a C-to-E parametric<br>
multi-channel system. The preferred embodiment is the<br>
implementation of the invention in a binaural cue coding<br>
(BCC) system. For simplicity of discussion but without loss<br>
of generality, the inventive technique is described for the<br>
specific case of a BCC scheme for coding/decoding 5.1<br>
surrounds signals in a backwards compatible way.<br>
The before-mentioned problem of auditory image width<br>
reduction occurs mostly for audio signals which contain<br>
independent fast repeating transients from different<br>
directions such as an applause signal of an audience in any<br>
kind of live recording. While the image width reduction<br>
may, in principle, be addressed by using a higher time<br>
resolution for ICLD synthesis, this would result in an<br>
increased side information rate and also require a change<br>
in the window size of the used analysis/synthesis<br>
filterbank. It is to be noted here that this possibility<br>
additionally results in negative effects on tonal<br>
components, since an increase of time resolution<br>
automatically means a decrease of frequency resolution.<br>
Instead, the invention is a simple concept that does not<br>
have these disadvantages and aims at reducing the influence<br>
of the center channel signal component in the side<br>
channels.<br>
As has been discussed in connection with Figs. 7a - 7d, the<br>
base channels for the five reconstructed output channels of<br>
5-to-2 BCC are:<br><br><br>
It is to be noted that the original center channel signal<br>
component x3 appears 3 dB amplified in the center base<br>
channel subband S3 (factor 1 /√2) and 3 dB attenuated in the<br>
remaining (side channel) base channel subbands.<br>
In order to further attenuate the influence of the center<br>
channel signal component in the side base channel subbands<br>
according to this invention, the following general idea is<br>
applied as illustrated in Fig. 2.<br>
An estimate of the final decoded center channel signal is<br>
computed by preferably scaling it to the desired target<br>
level as described by the corresponding level information<br>
such as an ICLD value in BCC environments. Preferably, this<br>
decoded center signal is calculated in the spectral domain<br>
in order to save computation, i.e. no synthesis filterbank<br>
processing is applied.<br>
Additionally, this center decoded signal or center<br>
reconstructed signal, which corresponds to the cancellation<br>
channel, can be weighted and then combined to both the base<br>
channel signals of the other output channels. This<br>
combining is preferably a subtraction. Nevertheless, when<br>
the weighting factors have a different sign, then an<br>
addition also results in the reduction of the influence of<br>
the center channel in the base channel used for<br><br>
reconstructing the left or the right output channel. This<br>
processing results in forming a modified base channel for<br>
reconstruction of left and left surround or for<br>
reconstruction of right or right surround. Preferably a<br>
weighting factor of -3 dB is preferred, but also any other<br>
value is possible.<br>
Instead of the original transmission base channel signals<br>
as used in Fig. 7b, modified base channel signals are used<br>
for the computation of the decoded output channel of the<br>
other output channels, i.e. the channels other than the<br>
center channel.<br>
In the following, a block diagram of the inventive concept<br>
will be discussed by reference to Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows an<br>
apparatus for generating a multi-channel output signal<br>
having K output channels, the multi-channel output signal<br>
corresponding to a multi-channel input signal having C<br>
input channels, using E transmission channels, the E<br>
transmission channels representing a result of a downmix<br>
operation having the C input channels as an input, and<br>
using parametric side information on the input channels,<br>
wherein C is &gt; 2, C is &gt; E, and K is &gt; 1 and 
Additionally, the downmix operation is effective to<br>
introduce a first input channel in a first transmission<br>
channel and in a second transmission channel. The inventive<br>
device includes the cancellation channel calculator 20 to<br>
calculate at least one cancellation channel 21, which is<br>
input into a combiner 22, which receives, at a second input<br>
23, the first transmission channel directly or a processed<br>
version of the first transmission channel. The processing<br>
of the first transmission channel to obtain the processed<br>
version of the first transmission channel is performed by<br><br>
means of a processor 24, which can be present in some<br>
embodiments, but is, in general, optional. The combiner is<br>
operated to obtain a second base channel 25 for being input<br>
into a channel reconstructor 26.<br>
The channel reconstructor uses the second base channel 25<br>
and parametric side information on the original left input<br>
channel, which are input into the channel reconstructor 26<br>
at another input 27, to generate the second output channel.<br>
At the output of the channel reconstructor, one obtains a<br>
second output channel 28, which might be the reconstructed<br>
left output channel, which is, compared to the scenario in<br>
Fig. 7b, generated by a base channel, which has a small<br>
influence or even a totally cancelled influence of the<br>
original input center channel compared to the situation in<br>
Fig. 7b.<br>
While the left output channel generated as shown in Fig. 7b<br>
includes a certain influence as has been described above,<br>
this certain influence is reduced in the second base<br>
channel as generated in Fig. 2 because of the combination<br>
of the cancellation channel and the first transmission<br>
channel or the processed first transmission channel.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 2, the cancellation channel calculator<br>
20 calculates the cancellation channel using information on<br>
the original center channel available as a decoder, i.e.<br>
information for generating the multi-channel output signal.<br>
This information includes parametric side information on<br>
the first input channel 30, or includes the first<br>
transmission channel 31, which also includes some<br>
information on the center channel because of the downmixing<br>
operation, or includes the second transmission channel 32,<br><br>
which also includes information on the center channel<br>
because of the downmixing operation. Preferably, all this<br>
information is used for optimum reconstruction of the<br>
center channel to obtain the cancellation channel 21.<br>
Such an optimum embodiment will subsequently be described<br>
with respect to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. In contrast to Fig. 2,<br>
Fig. 3 shows the 2-fold device from Fig. 2, i.e. a device<br>
for canceling the center channel influence in the left base<br>
channel s1 as well as the right base channel s2. The<br>
cancellation channel calculator 20 from Fig. 2 includes a<br>
center channel reconstruction device 20a and a weighting<br>
device 20b to obtain the cancellation channel 21 at the<br>
output of the weighting device. The combiner 22 in Fig. 2<br>
is a simple subtracter which is operative to subtract the<br>
cancellation channel 21 from the first transmission channel<br>
21 to obtain - in terms of Fig. 2 - the second base channel<br>
25 for reconstructing the second output channel (such as<br>
the left output channel) and, optionally, also the left<br>
surround output channel. The reconstructed center channel<br>
X3(k) can be obtained at the output of the center channel<br>
reconstruction device 20a.<br>
Fig. 4 indicates a preferred embodiment implemented as a<br>
circuit diagram, which uses the technique which has been<br>
discussed with respect to Fig. 3. Additionally, Fig. 4<br>
shows the frequency-selective processing which is optimally<br>
suited for being integrated into a straight forward<br>
frequency-selective BCC reconstruction device.<br>
The center channel reconstruction 26 takes place by summing<br>
the two transmission channels in a summer 40. Then, the<br>
parametric side information for the channel level<br><br>
differences, or the factor a3 derived from the inter-<br>
channel level difference as discussed in Fig. 7d is used<br>
for generating a modified version of the first base channel<br>
(in terms of Fig. 2) which is input into the channel<br>
reconstructor 26 at the first base channel input 29 in Fig.<br>
2. The reconstructed center channel at the output of the<br>
multiplier 41 can be used for center channel output<br>
reconstruction (after the general normalization which is<br>
described in Fig. 7d).<br>
To acknowledge the influence of the center channel in the<br>
base channel for the left and the right reconstruction, a<br>
weighting factor of 1/√2 is applied which is illustrated by<br>
means of a multiplier 42 in Fig. 4. Then, the reconstructed<br>
and again weighted center channel is fed back to the<br>
summers 43a and 43b, which correspond to the combiner 22 in<br>
Fig. 2.<br>
Thus, the second base channel s1 or s4 (or s2 and s5) is<br>
different from the transmission channel y1 in that the<br>
center channel influence is reduced compared to the case in<br>
Fig. 7b.<br>
The resulting base channel subbands are given in<br>
mathematical terms as follows:<br><br><br>
Thus, the Fig. 4 device provides for a subtraction of a<br>
center channel subband estimate from the base channels for<br>
the side channels in order to improve independence between<br>
the channels and, therefore, to provide a better spatial<br>
width of the reconstructed output multi-channel signal.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, which will subsequently be described with<br>
respect to Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b, a cancellation channel<br>
different from the cancellation channel calculated in Fig.<br>
3 is determined. In contrast to the Fig. 3/Fig. 4<br>
embodiment, the cancellation channel 21 for calculating the<br>
second base channel sl(k) is not derived from the first<br>
transmission channel as well as the second transmission<br>
channel but is derived from the second transmission channel<br>
y2(k) alone using a certain weighting factor x_lr, which is<br>
illustrated by the multiplication device 51 in Fig. 5a.<br>
Thus, the cancellation channel 21 in Fig. 5a is different<br>
from the cancellation channel in Fig. 3, but also<br>
contributes to a reduction of the center channel influence<br>
on the base channel sl(k) used for reconstructing the<br>
second output channel, i.e. the left output channel xl(k).<br>
In the Fig. 5a embodiment, also a preferred embodiment of<br>
the processor 24 is shown. In particular, the processor 24<br>
is implemented as another multiplication device 52, which<br>
applies a multiplication by a multiplication factor (1-<br>
x_lr) . Preferably, as is shown in Fig. la, the multi-<br>
plication factor applied by the processor 24 to the first<br>
transmission channel depends on the multiplication factor<br>
51, which is used for multiplying the second transmission<br>
channel to obtain the cancellation channel 21. Finally, the<br>
processed version of the first transmission channel at an<br><br>
input 23 to the combiner 22 is used for combining, which<br>
consists in subtracting the cancellation channel 21 from<br>
the processed version of the first transmission channel.<br>
All this again results in the second base channel 25, which<br>
has a reduced or a completely cancelled influence of the<br>
original center input channel.<br>
As it is shown in Fig. 5a, the same procedure is repeated<br>
to obtain the third base channel s2(k) at an input into the<br>
right/right surround reconstruction device. However, as it<br>
is shown in Fig. 5a, the third base channel s2(k) is<br>
obtained by combining the processed version of the second<br>
transmission channel y(k) and another cancellation channel<br>
53, which is derived from the first transmission channel<br>
yl(k) through multiplication in a multiplication device 54,<br>
which has a multiplication factor x_rl, which can be<br>
identical to x_lr for a device 51, but which can also be<br>
different from this value. The processor for processing the<br>
second transmission channel as indicated in Fig. 5a is a<br>
multiplication device 55. The combiner for combining the<br>
second cancellation channel 53 and the processed version of<br>
the second transmission channel y2(k) is illustrated by<br>
reference number 56 in Fig. 5a. The cancellation channel<br>
calculator from Fig. 2 further includes a device for<br>
computing the cancellation coefficients, which is indicated<br>
by reference number 57 in Fig. 5a. The device 57 is<br>
operative to obtain parametric side information on the<br>
original or input center channel such as inter-channel<br>
level difference, etc. The same is true for the device 20a<br>
in Fig. 3, where the center channel reconstruction device<br>
20a also includes an input for receiving parametric side<br>
information such as level values or inter-channel level<br>
differences, etc.<br><br>
The following Equation<br><br>
shows the mathematical description of the Fig. 5a<br>
embodiment and illustrates, on the right side thereof, the<br>
cancellation processing in the cancellation channel<br>
calculator on the one hand and the processors (21, 24 in<br>
Fig. 2) on the other hand. In this specific embodiment,<br>
which is illustrated here, the factors x_lr and x__rl are<br>
identical to each other.<br>
The above embodiment makes clear that the invention<br>
includes a composition of the reconstruction base channels<br>
as a signal-adaptive linear combination of the left and the<br>
right transmitted channels. Such a topology is illustrated<br>
in Fig. 5a.<br>
When viewed from a different angle, the inventive device<br>
can also be understood as a dynamic upmixing procedure, in<br>
which a different upmixing matrix for each subband and each<br>
time instance k is used. Such a dynamic upmixing matrix is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5b. It is to be noted that for each<br>
subband, i.e. for each output of the filterbank device in<br>
Fig. 4, such an upmixing matrix U exists. Regarding the<br>
time-dependent manner, it is to be noted that Fig. 5b<br>
includes the time index k. When one has level information<br><br>
for each time index, the upmixing matrix would change from<br>
each time instance to the next time instance. When,<br>
however, the same level information a3 is used for a<br>
complete block of values transformed into a frequency<br>
representation by the input filterbank FB, then one value<br>
a3 will be present for a complete block of e. g. 1024 or<br>
2048 sampling values. In this case, the upmixing matrix<br>
would change in the time direction from block to block<br>
rather than from value to value. Nevertheless, techniques<br>
exist for smoothing parametric level values so that one may<br>
obtain different amplitude modification factors a3 during<br>
upmixing in a certain frequency band.<br>
Stated generally, one could also use different factors for<br>
computation of the output center channel subbands and the<br>
factors for "dynamic upmixing", resulting in a factor a3,<br>
which is a scaled version of a3 as computed above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the weighting strength of the<br>
center component cancellation is adaptively controlled by<br>
means of an explicit transmission of side information from<br>
the encoder to the decoder. In this case, the cancellation<br>
channel calculator 20 shown in Fig. 2 will include a<br>
further control input, which receives an explicit control<br>
signal which could be calculated to indicate a direct<br>
interdependence between the left and the center or the<br>
right and the center channel. In this regard, this control<br>
signal would be different from the level differences for<br>
the center channel and the left channel, because these<br>
level differences are related to a kind of a virtual<br>
reference channel, which could be the sum of the energy in<br>
the first transmission channel and the sum of the energy in<br><br>
the second transmission channel as it is illustrated at the<br>
top of Fig. 7d.<br>
Such a control parameter could, for example, indicate that<br>
the center channel is below a threshold and is approaching<br>
zero, while there is a signal in the left or the right<br>
channel, which is above the threshold. In this case, an<br>
adequate reaction of the cancellation channel calculator to<br>
a corresponding control signal would be to switch off<br>
channel cancellation and to apply a normal upmixing scheme<br>
as shown in Fig. 7b for avoiding "over-cancellation" of the<br>
center channel, which is not present in the input. In this<br>
regard, this would be an extreme kind of controlling the<br>
weighting strength as outlined above.<br>
Preferably, as becomes clear from Fig. 4, no time delay<br>
processing operation is performed for calculating the<br>
reconstruction center channel. This is advantageous in that<br>
the feedback works without having to take into<br>
consideration any time delays. Nevertheless, this can be<br>
obtained without loss of quality, when the original center<br>
channel is used as the reference channel for calculating<br>
the time differences dj.. The same is true for any<br>
correlation measure. It is preferred not to perform any<br>
correlation processing for reconstructing the center<br>
channel. Depending on the kind of correlation calculation,<br>
this can be done without loss of quality, when the original<br>
center channel is used as a reference for any correlation<br>
parameters.<br>
It is to be noted that the invention does not depend on a<br>
certain downmix scheme. This means that one can use an<br>
automatic downmix or a manual downmix scheme performed by a<br><br>
sound engineer. One can even use automatically generated<br>
parametric information together with manually generated<br>
downmix channels.<br>
Depending on the application environment, the inventive<br>
methods for constructing or generating can be implemented<br>
in hardware or in software. The implementation can be a<br>
digital storage medium such as a disk or a CD having<br>
electronically readable control signals, which can<br>
cooperate with a programmable computer system such that the<br>
inventive methods are carried out. Generally stated, the<br>
invention therefore, also relates to a computer program<br>
product having a program code stored on a machine-readable<br>
carrier, the program code being adapted for performing the<br>
inventive methods, when the computer program product runs<br>
on a computer. In other words, the invention, therefore,<br>
also relates to a computer program having a program code<br>
for performing the methods, when the computer program runs<br>
on a computer.<br>
The present invention may be used in conjunction with or<br>
incorporated into a variety of different applications or<br>
systems including systems for television or electronic<br>
music distribution, broadcasting, streaming, and/or<br>
reception. These include systems for decoding/encoding<br>
transmissions via, for example, terrestrial, satellite,<br>
cable, internet, intranets, or physical media (e.g.<br>
compact discs, digital versatile discs, semiconductor<br>
chips, hard drives, memory cards and the like). The<br>
present invention may also be employed in games and game<br>
systems including, for example, interactive software<br>
products intended to interact with a user for entertainment<br>
(action, role play, strategy, adventure, simulations,<br>
racing, sports, arcade, card and board games) and/or<br><br>
education that may be published for multiple machines,<br>
platforms or media. Further, the present invention may be<br>
incorporated in audio players or CD-ROM/DVD systems. The<br>
present invention may also be incorporated into PC software<br>
applications that incorporate digital decoding (e.g.<br>
player, decoder) and software applications incorporating<br>
digital encoding capabilities (e.g. - encoder, ripper,<br>
recoder, and jukebox).<br><br>
