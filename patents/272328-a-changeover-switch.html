 <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a changeover switch for changeover of electrical supply from one source to another source.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A backup system for power generation is used when the main power source is discontinued, so that, the critical operations will continue by the help of backup power source, like generator or inverter. Thus, there is a need to have a device, which has two power supplies i.e. main power supply and backup power supply at input side of the switch and one output power supply for the load. Further, these input power supplies must have complete electrical isolation from each other, and only one power supply should get connected to a load at a time. The aforesaid requirements are fulfilled by changeover or transfer switch. This type of switch is able to obtain isolation between two input power supplies and only one power supply gets connected to a load at a time. Besides isolation it also fulfils the interlock requirement and hence ensures that only one of the two sources will be connected to the load.<br>
The patent application WO 9824102 relates to a switch comprising of double-decker changeover switch having two switch-disconnectors, which sandwiches two mechanism modules connected with an interlock module. One switch is placed above the mechanism block and second switch is placed below the mechanism block. Each switch comprises of rotary bridge which houses moving contact. Terminals mounted on housing forms fix contact. In order to prevent two switches to be ON at the same time, mechanical linkages are provided on the shaft, which ensures the interlocking of two switches. Thus, this invention comprises of two switches housed in different housing with multiple bridges, two mechanism and an interlock.<br>

 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, figures 1-9 show a changeover or transfer switch along with the components thereof.<br>
Fig. 1 is a disassembled view of a changeover switch (8). The changeover switch comprises of a handle (10), which on rotation changes to various changeover positions so as to switch the electrical supply from one source to another source. A housing (12) is provided having the terminals (14) or the fix contacts. The housing (12) has at least two sets of terminals (14). The terminals (14) are arranged in a zigzag manner or alternately or at different levels. This arrangement of the terminals (14) eases the access to the top and bottom switches from the front side, thereby facilitating fixing of the cable lug to the terminals (14) conveniently. A bridge assembly (16) as shown in fig. 3 is composed of moving contacts (20), contact springs (22) mounted on a bridge (24). The bridge assembly (16) has at least two rows of moving contacts (20) on either side. The changeover switch comprises of a single bridge. A cover (18) covers the bridge assembly (16). The cover (18) along with the bridge assembly (16) is adapted centrally on the housing (12). A shaft (28) is placed in between the housing (12) and the cover (18) covering the bridge assembly (16). The shaft (28) transmits the rotational motion from the handle (10) to an actuation mechanism (not shown in the figures), to convert the rotary motion of the handle (10) or the shaft (28) into translating motion, which changes the position of the bridge assembly (16) thereby interlocking or establishing or breaking the contact between the terminals (14) or the fix contacts and the moving contacts (20) to actuate the switch to ON or OFF condition respectively. The shaft is of C shape that avoids interference with the bridge, when switch I is in ON or switch II is in ON condition.<br>
Fig. 2 is a view of the housing (12) with the terminals 14(a), 14(b), 14(c) and 14(d). The terminals or the fix contacts are arranged alternately or in a zigzag manner or at different levels. Terminals 14(a) and 14(c) are the bottom and top front terminals that form front switch I. Terminals 14(b) and 14(d) are the bottom and top rear terminals that form rear switch II.<br>
5<br>
 <br>
Switch I is connected to one power supply source and switch II is connected to another power supply source at the input side of the switch and one output power supply for the load.<br>
Fig. 3 entails a bridge assembly (16) with the contact springs (22), moving contacts 20(a), 20(b), 20(c) and 20(d) and a bridge (24). The bridge (24) is made up of an insulating material such as plastic. The contact springs (22) are placed on the moving contacts (20) and the central part is supported against the bridge (24). The contact springs (22) facilitate contact pressure between the moving contacts (20) and the respective terminals (14) in contact. The contact spring (22) is a leaf spring. Moving contacts 20(a) and 20(b) form a path for current between the top and bottom front terminals 14(a) and 14(c) in ON condition of switch I. Moving contacts 20(c) and 20(d) form a path for current between the top and bottom rear terminals 14(b) and 14(d) in ON condition of switch II.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a changeover switch with both switch I and switch II in OFF condition. The handle (10) as shown in fig. 4 is in a horizontal position. During this position, the bridge (24) is in such a position that neither of moving contacts (20) is in contact with any of the terminals (14). During this condition a contact gap is formed between the moving contacts 20(a) and 20(b) and the terminals 14(a) and 14(c) to fulfill isolation requirement. Similarly, a contact gap is formed between the moving contacts 20(c), 20(d) and the terminals 14(b), 14(d) to fulfill isolation requirement. There is no contact between the terminals (14) and the moving contacts (20) and therefore both the switches, switch I and switch II are in OFF condition as shown in fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 6 and 7 shows switch I from OFF to ON and Switch II in OFF condition. The handle (10) is turned clockwise. For the first 45° rotation, the mechanism spring gets fully charged. During this condition the bridge (24) does not move from its previous position as in fig 4. After mechanism crosses the dead centre position, the bridge (24) moves from right to left causing moving contacts 20(a) and 20(b) to climb over terminals 14(a)<br>
6<br>
 <br>
and 14(c) against contact spring (22). When the handle (10) turns completely 90° of its rotation and become vertical as shown in fig.6, the bridge (24) is at its right most position. In this condition terminals 14(a) and 14(c) and moving contacts 20(a) and 20(b) are interlocked and forms closed path for current to flow from incoming side to outgoing side.<br>
In order to turn switch I from ON to OFF condition, the handle (10) is turned counter clockwise. For the first 45° rotation of the mechanism spring gets charged fully during this condition the bridge (24) does not move from its previous position. After mechanism crosses the dead centre position, the bridge (24) starts moving from left to right causing moving contacts 20(a) and 20(b) to get detached from terminals 14(a) and 14(c) and move away from them. When handle turns completely 90° of its rotation and become horizontal as shown in fig.4, the bridge (24) comes to central position as shown in fig. 5 and switch I is in OFF condition. In this condition terminals 14(a) and 14(c) and the moving contacts 20(a) and 20(b) form an open circuit and ensures adequate contact gap to fulfill isolation requirement. In this condition switch I and switch II are in OFF condition.<br>
Fig. 8 and 9 shows switch I in OFF and Switch II from OFF to ON condition. The handle (10) is turned counter clockwise. For the first 45° rotation, the mechanism spring gets fully charged. During this condition the bridge (24) does not move from its previous position. After mechanism crosses the dead centre position, the bridge (24) starts moving from right to left causing moving contacts 20(c) and 20(d) to climb over terminals 14(b) and 14(d) against contact spring (22). When the handle (10) turns completely 90° of its rotation and becomes vertical as shown in fig.8, the bridge (24) comes to its left most position and switch I is OFF. In this condition, terminals 14(b) and 14(d) and the moving contacts 20(c) and 20(d) are interlocked and forms closed path for current to flow from incoming side to outgoing side as shown in fig.9.<br>
7<br>
 <br>
Switch switch and I II are connected to different power supplies so that whenever the main power supply is discontinued, a backup power supply continues the critical operations. The switches are able to achieve isolation between the power supplies and only one power supply gets connected to a load at a time.<br>
