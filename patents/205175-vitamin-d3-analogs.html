Compounds of formula III are known (for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,087,619) or can be prepared according to known methods.<br>
The useful activity of compounds of formula I as agents for the treatment of prostate cancer, breast cancer, and for the treatment of leukemia can be demonstrated by the following test processes which are known in the art.<br>
Materials selected for use herein and procedures employed were as follows:<br>
Cell lines. The breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) and myeloid leukemia cell line (HL-60) were maintained as follows: MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum<br><br>
(FCS);  LNCaP and HL-60 were cultured in RPMI1640 with 10% FCS;   All three cell lines were maintained in a 37°C incubator containing 5% CO2.<br>
Vitamin D3 Compounds. The vitamin D3 compounds were dissolved in absolute ethanol at 10*3 M as stock solution, which were stored at -20°C and protected from light. For in vitro use, compounds were diluted in DMEM or RPMI medium. For in vivo use, compounds were diluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). An aliquot was used only once and LNCaP cells were trypsinized. Washed single-cell suspensions of cells were enumerated and plated into 24-well flat-bottomed plates with a total of 1 X 10"3 cells/well in a volume of 400 jil/vvell. The feeder layer was prepared with agar that had been equilibrated at 42°C. Prior to this step, compounds were pipetted into wells. After incubation, the colonies were counted. All experiments were done at least three times using triplicate plates per experimental point.<br>
Serum Calcium Levels in vivo. Twenty-eight male Balb/c mice at 8 to 9 weeks of age were maintained in pathogen-free conditions and fed a standard laboratory diet. Four mice per group were injected intraperitoneally every other day (except Saturday and Sunday) with either vitamin D3 compound or diluant (100 (.il/mouse) for 3 weeks. Doses of l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 were: 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 |Ag. Doses of l,25(OH)2D3 were 0.1 j-ig/mouse. Control mice were injected with 100 \x\ of PBS. Serum calcium values were measured every week by the quantitative, colorimetric detection assay.<br>
Pulse-Exposure Experiments. The MCF-7 cells were incubated in liquid culture with 10"7 of l,25(OH)2D3 or l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 for various durations. After incubation, these cells were carefully washed twice with PBS and viable cells were counted and plated into 24-well plates for soft agar colony assay, as previously described.<br>
Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry. Cell cycle analysis was performed on MCF-7 cells incubated for4 days with either l,25(OH)2D3 oU,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 at 10"7 M. The cells were fixed in chilled methanol overnight before staining with 50 Hg/ml propidium iodide, 1 mg/ml Rnase (100 units/ml) and 0.1% NP40. Analysis<br><br>
was performed immediately after staining. All experiments were done at least three times independently. All data were statistically analyzed by Student's test.<br>
Western Blot Analysis. Cells were washed twice with PBS, suspended in Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris Ph 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 100 jig/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 \x§/m\ aprotinin, 1 p.g/ml pepstatin and 10 ng/ml leupeptin), and placed on ice for 30 minutes. After centrifugation at 15,000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C, the supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations were quantitated. Whole lysates (15 jig) were resolved by 15% sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel, were transferred to an immobilon polyvinylidene difuride membrane and were probed with anti-p27kipl rabbit polyclonal antibody and anti-Actin murine monoclonal antibody. Blots were developed.<br>
Telomerase Activity. To detect the relative telomerase activity, telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assays were performed. For human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), total RNAs were isolated from HL-cells which were treated with either l,25(OH)2D3 or l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 (10"9 10"8, and 10'7 M) for 4 days with a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate. RT-PCR was performed with 1 ng of total RNA and random hexamer primers. cDNA was amplified using primers specific for the hTERT gene or the GAPDH gene, which was used as a control. The primers used for hTERT were: 5'-CGGAAGAGTGTCTGGAGCAA-3' (sense) (SEQ ID NO: 1), and 5'- GGATGAAGCGGAGTCTGGA-3'- (antisense) (SEQ ID NO: 2). The thermal cycles were 94°C for 90 seconds, followed by 33 cycles of 95°C for 20 seconds, 68°C for 40 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds. Primers for the GAPDH gene were: 5'-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3' (sense) (SEQ ID NO: 3), and 5'-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3' (antisense) (SEQ ID NO: 4), Conditions for GAPDH amplifications were: 94°C for 2 minutes, 26 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 62°C for 40 seconds, 72°C for 60 seconds, followed by 72°C for 4 minutes. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.<br><br>
Effect of Vitamin D3 analogs on Clonogenic Assay. LNCaP cells, MCF-7 cells and HL-60 cells were cloned in soft agar in the presence of vitamin D3 analogs at 10"n to 10"7 M. Dose-response curves were drawn and the effective dose that inhibited 50% colony formation (ED50) was determined. l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans D3 was effective in inhibition of clonal proliferation of the three cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. The ED50 of l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 was 1.4 X 10*9 M for LNCaP cells, 4.3 X 10" 9 M for MCF-7 cells, and 3.0 X 10*11 M for HL-60 cells, which was about 10-100 fold more potent than l,25(OH)2D3.<br>
Serum Calcium Levels in vivo. Because hypercalcemia is a major toxicity of vitamin D3 compounds, the calcemic effects of l,25(OH)2D3 were compared with l,25(OH)2-l6-ene-5,6-trans-D3. All mice survived at 3 weeks of study. The mice that received 0.1 p.g of lf25(OH)2D3 were all hypercalcemic with serum calcium levels of approximately 12 mg/d! (normal 8.5-10.5 mg/dl). In contrast, mice that received l,25(OH)2-l6-ene-5,6-trans-D3 (0.1 -2.0 (.tg/mouse) had almost the same calcium level (8-10 mg/dl) as the control mice (8-9 mg/dl).<br>
Pulse-Exposure Experiments. To investigate whether the inhibition of clonogenic proliferation by vitamin D3 analogs was reversible, pulse-exposure experiments were performed. The MCF-7 cells were exposed to either l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 or l,25(OH)2D3 for various durations, washed thoroughly, plated in soft agar, and colony numbers were enumerated on day 14 of culture.   Approximately forty and thirty percent of the clonogenic cells were inhibited by 4 days of exposure to l,25(OH)2-l6-ene-5,6-trans-D3 and l,25(OH)2D3, respectively.<br>
Cell cycle Analysis. Effect of l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 and l,25(OH)2D3 (10~7, 4 days) on the cell cycle of the MCF-7 cells was determined. A significant increase (P 
 <br>
Western Blot Analysis. The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors known as p21 and p27kipl are able to inhibit the activity of cyclin kinase and thus slow the progression for the cells through the cell cycle. The control MCF-7 cells constituitively had a moderate level of expression of p21wafl and p27kipI, as determined by Western blot analysis. Exposure for one day to l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 (10'7 M) increased expression of p21waf1 and p27kipI by about 3.2-3.5 fold, whereas culture with l,25(OH)2D3 (10'7 M) increased expression of p21wafl and p27kipI about 1.6-1.8 fold. Exposure of MCF-7 cells to l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 (10'7 M) for 3 days resulted in a 2.8-fold and 3.4-fold increase in expression of p21wafl and p27kipi, respectively. l,25(OH)2D3 (10-7 M, 3 days) increased expression of p21wafl and p27kipI by 4.8 fold and 3.3 fold, respectively.<br>
The dose-dependent effect of the vitamin D3 compounds on expression of p27kipl HL-60 cells was examined. Both l,25(OH)2D3 and l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 up-regulated expression of p27kip! expression, and these levels markedly increased after incubation with l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 (4 days, 10"9 M). Levels of p27kipl increased prominently when the HL-60 cells were cultured with 10*s - 10"7 M of l,25(OH)2D3.<br>
Telomerase Activity. The effect of l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 and l,25(OH)2D3 (10'9 - 10"7 M, 4 days) on telomerase activity was evaluated using the TRAP assay. Telomerase activity markedly decreased in HL-60 cells cultured with either l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 10'9 M or 10'7 M, l,25(OH)2D3.<br>
The effects of vitamin D3 analogs on hTERT expression in HL-60 cells was evaluated using RT-PCR. Both l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 and l,25(OH)2D3 inhibited the expression of hTERT mRNA in a dose-dependent manner with almost complete inhibition of expression occurring at 10*8 M of l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans-D3 and at 10*7 M of l,25(OH)2D3.<br><br>
The useful activity of the compounds of formula I as agents for the treatment of benign prostate growth can be demonstrated by the following test processes which are known in the art.<br>
l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans D3 was evaluated for antiandrogenic activity in castrated, testosterone stimulated male Syrian hamsters. Studies demonstrated that l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans D3 substantially suppressed the androgen-induced hypertrophy of the seminal vesicles and the ventral prostate gland in these animals, whereas l,25(OH)2D3 was inactive at non-toxic doses (1 ^g).<br>
Castrated male Syrian hamsters were injected daily, s.c. with 20 j.ig testosterone propionate and 1 jag l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5&gt;6-trans D3 for 14 consecutive days. Both compounds were administered in a vehicle of 0.2 ml sesame oil each. Necropsy was performed on day 15. The prostate and seminal vesicles were removed, blotted and weighed. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using the Student's t-test and are expressed as percent inhibition of stimulated response.<br><br><br>
The useful activity of the compounds of formula I as agents for the treatment of osteoporosis can be demonstrated by the following test processes which are known in the art.<br>
Materials and Methods Animals and treatment:<br>
Three month old adult female rats were used. After a week of acclimatization the animals were weight grouped and treated by oral gavage at 1 ml/kg/day with several concentrations of l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans D3. On day 7 of dosing, animals were bled and serum calcium levels were determined.<br>
Compound Preparation:<br>
Compound was dissolved in 200 proof ethanol to produce a concentration of 100 |ig/ml. Sesame oil vehicle and ethanol compound solution were prepared for the highest dosage concentration, then rotary evaporated at 37° to remove ethanol. Dose volume was calculated using the dosing group average body weight. Serial dilutions of vehicle dissolved compound were done to appropriate dosage concentrations.<br>
Serum Collection and Determination:<br>
Blood (1.5 ml) was collected from each animal by orbital puncture under ether anesthesia on Day 7 of dosing. Blood was collected into serum separator tubes, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 minutes and then serum aliquoted for calcium determinations. Serum calcium was determined by colorimetric assay.<br><br><br>
Serum calcium levels were within the normal range for dosage groups up to 2 jig/kg/day of treatment with l,25(OH)2-16-ene-5,6-trans D3.<br>
Materials and Methods Animals and treatment:<br>
Three month old adult female rats were subjected to bilateral ovariectomy or sham surgery. After a week of acclimatization the animals were weight grouped and treated by oral gavage at 1 mg/kg of specified concentration. Dose volume was calculated weekly using the group average body weight. Dosing started 17 days post surgery and continued for 19 days! On the 20th day animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation and left femurs excised.<br>
Total Femoral Bone Calcium:<br>
At necropsy the left femurs from all groups were excised and soft tissue removed. The bones were measured and cut in half at mid-diaphysis; then the distal portion was cut in half longitudinally after removal of the epiphysis. The bone marrow was flushed out and the calcium was extracted by immersion in 5% TCA. The calcium content of TCA extracts was determined by using quantitative, colorimetric determination of calcium. The data were expressed as mean total bone calcium in mg/distal half femur (DHF) + serum.<br>
Serum Collection and Determination:<br>
Blood (1.5 ml) was collected from each animal by orbital puncture under ether anesthesia on day 7 and day 18 of dosing. Blood was collected into serum separator tubes, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min. and then serum aliquoted for calcium determinations. Serum calcium was determined by colorimetric assay.<br>
Statistics:<br>
For a verification of the effect of ovariectomy on bone calcium, the sham and ovx vehicle groups were compared using student's t-test. The ovx groups were compared by one-way<br><br>
analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Fisher's LSD to compare each treatment group to vehicle when the overall effect was statistically significant.<br><br>
We first identified the useful activity of the compounds of formula I as agents for the treatment of sebaceous gland diseases, as demonstrated by the following test procedures which are known in the art.<br>
