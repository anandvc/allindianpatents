				<td>silicon-titanium mixed oxide-containing dispersion for the<br>
production of titanium-containing zeolites <br>
The invention relates to a silicon-titanium mixed oxide<br>
powder-containing dispersion for the production of<br>
titanium-containing zeolites.<br>
From EP-A-814058, the use of silicon-titanium mixed oxide<br>
powders for the production of titanium-containing zeolites<br>
is known. Titanium-containing zeolites are efficient<br>
catalysts for the oxidation of olefins with hydrogen<br>
peroxide. They are obtained by hydrothermal synthesis,<br>
starting from silicon-titanium mixed oxide powders in the<br>
presence of a template. In EP-A-814058, it is disclosed<br>
that pyrogenic silicon-titanium mixed oxides with a silicon<br>
dioxide content of 75 and 99.9 wt.-% can be used for this.<br>
Particularly advantageous is a composition which contains<br>
from 90 to 99.5 wt.-% silicon dioxide and 0.5 to 5 wt.%<br>
titanium dioxide. As templates, amines, ammonium compounds<br>
or alkali (alkaline earth) metal hydroxides can be used.<br>
A disadvantage of the process disclosed in EP-A-814058 is<br>
that it leads to products whose catalytic activity is often<br>
not reproducible and is often not adequate.<br>
The purpose of the present invention was therefore to<br>
provide a silicon-titanium mixed oxide in a form which<br>
makes it possible to produce titanium-containing zeolites<br>
of high catalytic activity.<br>
The object of the invention is a dispersion containing<br>
pyrogenic silicon-titanium mixed oxide powders with a<br>
silicon dioxide content of 75 to 99.99 wt.% and a titanium<br>
dioxide content of 0.01 to 25 wt.%, water and a basic,<br>
quaternary ammonium compound, wherein the mean aggregate<br>
diameter of the particles of the silicon-titanium mixed<br>
oxide powder in the dispersion is 200 nm at most.<br><br>
It was found that on use of this dispersion, which contains<br>
particles of this fineness, the reaction time which is<br>
needed for the production of titanium-containing zeolites<br>
is markedly reduced. Preferably, the mean aggregate<br>
diameter is less than 100 nm.<br>
Pyrogenic should be understood to refer to metal mixed<br>
oxide particles obtained by flame oxidation and/or flame<br>
hydrolysis. During this, oxidisable and/or hydrolysable<br>
starting materials are oxidised or hydrolysed as a rule in<br>
a hydrogen-oxygen flame. The metal mixed oxide particles<br>
according to the invention are as pore-free as possible and<br>
have free hydroxyl groups on the surface. They are present<br>
in the form of aggregated primary particles.<br>
The BET surface area of the pyrogenic silicon-titanium<br>
mixed oxide powders is not limited. It has however been<br>
found advantageous if the BET surface area lies in a range<br>
from 20 to 400 m2/g and in particular from 50 to 300 m2/g.<br>
The use of a silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder of high<br>
BET surface area in combination with a small mean aggregate<br>
diameter in the dispersion is particularly advantageous for<br>
the production of titanium-containing zeolites.<br>
It has further been found advantageous if the dispersion<br>
contains a pyrogenic silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder,<br>
wherein the proportions of Na, K, Fe, Co, Ni, Al, Ca and Zn<br>
are each less than 50 ppm, in particular less than 25 ppm.<br>
Such a dispersion leads to titanium-containing zeolites<br>
with high catalytic activity.<br>
The dispersion according to the invention also contains a<br>
basic, quaternary ammonium compound. These are preferably<br>
tetraalkylammonium hydroxides such as for example<br>
tetraethylammonium hydroxide, tetra-n-propylammonium<br>
hydroxide and/or tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide. Basic,<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds serve as templates which<br>
determine the crystal structure through incorporation into<br><br>
the crystal lattice. Tetra-n-propylammonium hydroxide is<br>
preferably used for the production of titanium silicalite-1<br>
(MFI structure), tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide for the<br>
production of titanium silicalite-2 (MEL structure) and<br>
tetraethylammonium hydroxide for the production of titanium<br>
β-zeolites (BEA crystal structure) .<br>
The ratio water / silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder is<br>
preferably 10 

oxide 
The content of quaternary, basic ammonium compound in the<br>
dispersion according to the invention is not limited. If<br>
the dispersion is to be stored for a prolonged period, it<br>
can be advantageous to add to it only a part of the<br>
quantity of the dispersion necessary for the production of<br>
a titanium-containing zeolite. Preferably, the quaternary,<br>
basic ammonium compound can be added in a quantity such<br>
that a pH value of 9 to 11, in particular 9.5 to 10.5,<br>
results. In this pH range, the dispersion displays good<br>
stability.<br>
If for example the dispersion is to be used directly after<br>
its production for the production of a titanium-containing<br>
zeolite, the dispersion can already contain the whole<br>
quantity of quaternary, basic ammonium compound. Preferably<br>
then 0.12 
mixed oxide 
silicon-titanium mixed oxide 
preferred.<br>
A further object of the invention is a process for the<br>
production of the dispersion comprising the steps:<br>
- water, which, in the event that silicon-titanium mixed<br>
oxide powder incorporated later leads to a pH value of<br>
the aqueous phase of 4, is adjusted to pH values<br><br>
micropellets, spheres, tablets, solid cylinders, hollow<br>
cylinders or honeycombs by known methods for the shaping of<br>
catalysts in powder form, such as for example pelleting,<br>
spray-drying, spray pelleting or extrusion.<br>
The titanium-containing zeolite according to the invention<br>
can be used as a catalyst in oxidation reactions with<br>
hydrogen peroxide. In particular, it can be used as a<br>
catalyst in the epoxidation of olefins by means of aqueous<br>
hydrogen peroxide in a solvent miscible with water.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Production of a silicon-titanium mixed oxide<br>
powder<br>
5.15 kg/hr of silicon tetrachloride and 0.15 kg/hr of<br>
titanium tetrachloride are vaporised. The vapours are<br>
transferred into a mixing chamber by means of 15 Nm3/hr of<br>
nitrogen as carrier gas. Separately from this, 2 Nm3/hr of<br>
hydrogen and 8 Nm3/hr of primary air are introduced into<br>
the mixing chamber. In a central pipe, the reaction mixture<br>
is fed into a burner and ignited. Here the flame burns in a<br>
water-cooled flame tube. In addition, 15 Nm3/hr of<br>
secondary air is introduced into the reaction space. The<br>
powder produced is separated in a filter connected<br>
downstream and then treated with a counter-current of<br>
hydrogen at 520°C.<br>
The powder displays the following values:<br>
Silicon dioxide 96.6 wt.%<br>
Titanium dioxide 3.4 wt.%<br>
BET surface area 80 m2/g<br><br>
of 2 to 4 by addition of acids or bases, is circulated<br>
from a holding tank through a rotor/stator machine, and<br>
-	via a filling device, silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder<br>
is introduced continuously or discontinuously into the<br>
shear zone between the grooves of the rotor teeth and the<br>
stator grooves, with the rotor/stator machine running, in<br>
a quantity such that a predispersion with a solids<br>
content of 20 to 40 wt.-% results, and<br>
-	after all the silicon-titanium mixed oxide powder has<br>
been added, the filling device is closed, and shearing<br>
continued such that the shear rate lies in the range<br>
between 10000 to 40000 sec-1, and<br>
-	then, while maintaining the dispersion conditions, a<br>
basic, quaternary ammonium compound is added, and<br>
optionally water, before the addition of the ammonium<br>
compound.<br>
A further object of the invention is a process for the<br>
production of a titanium-containing zeolite, wherein the<br>
dispersion according to the invention, optionally with<br>
further addition of the basic, quaternary ammonium<br>
compound, is processed at a temperature of 150 to 220°C for<br>
a period of less than 12 hours. The crystals obtained are<br>
separated by filtration, centrifugation or decantation and<br>
washed with a suitable washing liquid, preferably water.<br>
The crystals are then dried as required, and calcined at a<br>
temperature between 400°C and 1000°C, preferably between<br>
500°C and 750°C, in order to remove the template.<br>
A further object of the invention is a titanium-containing<br>
zeolite, which is obtainable by the process according to<br>
the invention.<br>
The titanium-containing zeolite is obtained in powder form.<br>
For its use as an oxidation catalyst, as required it is<br>
converted into a form suitable for the use, e.g. into<br><br>
Example 2: Production of a Dispersion (according to<br>
invention)<br>
32.5 kg of deionised water are first placed in a 100 1<br>
stainless steel batch vessel. Next, 17.5 kg of the silicon-<br>
titanium mixed oxide powder from Example 5 are inducted<br>
under shear conditions using the suction tube of the Ystral<br>
Conti-TDS 4 (Stator groove: 6 mm ring and 1 mm ring,<br>
rotor/stator gap ca. 1 mm). After completion of the<br>
induction, the inlet nozzle is closed and the 35 weight<br>
percent predispersion is sheared for a further 10 mins at<br>
3000 rpm. Undesired warming of the dispersion due to the<br>
high energy input is counteracted with a heat exchanger and<br>
the temperature rise limited to max. 40 °C. Owing to the<br>
acidic nature of the pyrogenically produced silicon-<br>
titanium mixed oxide powder, the pH value of the dispersion<br>
is ca. 3.6.<br>
Next, 28.6 kg of deionised water are added, and a pH value<br>
of 10.0 is rapidly established under intensive shearing and<br>
thorough mixing with 1.0 kg of tetra-n-propylammonium<br>
hydroxide solution (40 wt.-% in water).<br>
The dispersion displays the following values:<br>
Water/silicon-titanium mixed oxide 11.7<br>
Mean aggregate diameter 94 nm (determined on Horiba LA 910)<br>
Example 3: Production of a Dispersion (Comparison) •<br>
1 g of tetra-n-propylammonium hydroxide solution (40 wt.-%<br>
in water) are added to 17.5 g of the silicon-titanium mixed<br>
oxide powder from Example 1 in 61.1 ml of water under<br>
dispersing conditions by means of a dissolver, and<br>
dispersed for 30 mins. The dispersion obtained has a<br>
markedly higher viscosity in comparison to Example 3.<br>
Coarse aggregates can clearly be discerned as well as finer<br>
ones.<br>
The dispersion displays the following values:<br>
Water/silicon-titanium mixed oxide 13.2<br><br>
Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide/silicon-titanium mixed oxide<br>
0.14<br>
Mean aggregate diameter 256 nm<br>
Example 4: Production of a titanium-containing zeolite<br>
(according to invention)<br>
505 g of the dispersion from Example 2 are first placed in<br>
a polyethylene beaker, 46.7 g of deionised water and 130.6<br>
g of a tetra-n-propylammonium hydroxide solution (40 wt.-%<br>
in water) are added and firstly aged for four hours at 80°C<br>
with stirring and then crystallised for 10 hours at 180°C<br>
in an autoclave. The solid obtained is separated from the<br>
mother liquor by centrifugation, washed with 3 x 250 ml<br>
portions of deionised water, dried at 90°C and calcined in<br>
an atmosphere of air for four hours at 550°C.<br>
The Xray diffraction diagram of the crystals obtained from<br>
Example 4 shows the diffraction pattern typical for the MFI<br>
structure, and the IR spectrum the characteristic bands at<br>
960 cm-1. The UV/visible light spectrum shows that the<br>
sample is free from titanium dioxide and titanates.<br>
Example 5 is performed analogously to Example 4, but with<br>
the use of the dispersion from Example 3.<br>
In contrast to Example 4, Example 5 yields markedly more<br>
coarse zeolite aggregates. In the catalytic epoxidation of<br>
propylene, the product from Example 4 displays a higher<br>
activity than that from Example 5.<br><br>
