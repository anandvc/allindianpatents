				<td>PROCESS FOR MAKING OPHTHALMIC LENSES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to aqueous processes for making silicone<br>
hydrogel contact lenses that do not cause ocular discomfort.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known that contact lenses can be used to improve<br>
vision. Various contact lenses have been commercially produced for many<br>
years. Hydrogel contact lenses are very popular today. These lenses are<br>
often more comfortable to wear than contact lenses made of hard materials.<br>
Malleable soft contact lenses can be manufactured by forming a lens in a<br>
multi-part mold where the combined parts form a topography consistent with<br>
the desired final lens. Contact lenses made from silicone hydrogels have<br>
been disclosed. However, many of the raw materials which are used to<br>
make silicone hydrogel contact lenses have impurities which cannot be<br>
efficiently removed using the conventional water and saline based leaching<br>
steps.<br>
Some early disclosed methods used only water. However, these<br>
early processes used extremely long water leaching and/or high<br>
temperatures to extract undesirable components. No clinical data on the<br>
resulting lenses is available to confirm removal of undesirable impurities.<br>
Processes for removing undesired impurities from silicone hydrogel<br>
lenses via leaching steps using alcohols have been disclosed. The alcohols<br>
can sting the eye and must be completely removed from the contact lens.<br>
Special handling steps must be taken to dispose of the alcohols making the<br>
manufacturing process more expensive. Moreover; the use of organic<br>
solutions can present drawbacks, including, for example: safety hazards;<br>
increased risk of down time to a manufacturing line; high cost of release<br>
solution; and the health hazards associated with organic solvents.<br><br>
While modifying the leaching process is possible, it would be<br>
desirable to find silicone hydrogel materials which are free of impurities<br>
which cause undesirable ocular reactions, such as stinging.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process comprising<br>
(a)	curing in a mold a reaction mixture comprising at least one silicone<br>
containing component wherein said reaction mixture is substantially free<br>
from sparingly water soluble components or impurities having a retention<br>
time, relative to TRIS of less than about 0.9 to form a lens;<br>
(b)	contacting said lens and mold with an aqueous solution at a<br>
temperature less than 99°C for less than about 1 hour, to release said lens<br>
from the mold and<br>
(c)	optionally post processing the lens, wherein said post processing,<br>
if conducted, is conducted with aqueous solutions for a time less than 6<br>
hours.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been found that silicone hydrogels can be made via an<br>
aqueous hydration process so long as certain impurities are kept below an<br>
amount which causes ocular discomfort. Specifically, it has been found that<br>
compounds in silicone hydrogel contact lenses which can cause ocular<br>
discomfort are sparingly soluble in water, but have sufficient mobility in tears<br>
or tear components to move from the lens into ocular tissue. Compounds<br>
and impurities which are sparingly soluble in water and are able to move<br>
directly to the ocular tissue when in direct contact with ocular tissue may also<br>
contribute to ocular discomfort. As used herein "sparingly water soluble"<br>
means that less than about 2000 ppm of the compound is soluble in water at<br>
25ºC. These components and impurities are hereinafter referred to as<br>
"sparingly water soluble" or "SWS" components and impurities. When<br><br><br>
present as teachable compounds, these SWS compounds are not<br>
completely removed using aqueous solutions in the extraction and hydration<br>
steps of the contact lens manufacturing process. However, SWS<br>
compounds may leach from the contact lens during wear, causing ocular<br>
discomfort to the wearer. Thus it is imperative to insure that no SWS<br>
compounds and impurities remain in the contact lens.<br>
Unfortunately attempts to identify all of the chemical moieties which<br>
cause ocular discomfort have been unsuccessful. However, applicants have<br>
found that the SWS compounds and impurities may be characterized using<br>
liquid chromatography as described herein, and have a retention time<br>
relative to 3-metrmeryloxypropyltris(trirnethylslfoxy)silane ("TRIS"). measured<br>
in an HPLC using mixtures of acetonitrile, water, isopropanol and formate<br>
buffer as the solvent of less than about 0.9. Thus,, applicants have found<br>
that silicone hydrogel contact lenses may be made using aqueous<br>
processing so long as sparingly water soluble compounds or impurities<br>
having relative retention times of less than about 0.9 are substantially<br>
excluded from the reactive mixture or are bound to the lens polymer during<br>
curing.<br>
As used herein retention time means the time from injection of the<br>
sample into an HPLC to the time of the peak of edition. The retention times<br>
used in the present invention are relative retention times measured against<br>
3-methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiboxy)silane ("TRIS") using the same<br>
conditions, column and equipment for both TRIS and the sample to be<br>
measured. The use of a relative retention time instead of an absolute<br>
retention time allows for more consistent retention time values regardless of<br>
the specific HPLC system selected.<br>
In the examples, the Applicants used an Agilent 1100 HPLC with a<br>
Thermo ODS Hyperslf column of dimensions 150 x 4.6 mm x 5 Μ, with<br>
attached Finnigan LCQ Classic mass spectrometer with electrospray<br>
ionization in tandem with UV and ELSO (Sedex). While applicants have<br><br><br>
used the specifically disclosed equipment, any C18 column and equivalent<br>
equipment will provide results consistent with those claimed herein. The<br>
solvent gradient profile specified in Table 6 should be used to determine the<br>
relative retention times specified herein. The chromatographic analysis is<br>
performed at about 25°C.<br>
Other chromatographic conditions are well known in the art, and will<br>
not affect the results of this test so long as they are within the conditions<br>
commonly used in the art, such as but not limited to tubing volumes.<br>
Samples are prepared by making 2% (wt/wt) solutions of each test<br>
material in isopropyl alcohol. 3 μL of sample solution is injected into the<br>
HPLC, using a flow rate of 1 ml/minute. The eluting solvent for each sample<br>
was varied using the gradient program shown in Table 6 of the Examples.<br>
The contact lenses of the present invention are formed by combining<br>
the desired lens forming components into a reactive mixture. The reactive<br>
mixture comprises the reactive components, initiators, and other desired<br>
components described below. The reactive mixture used to form contact<br>
tenses is substantially free from SWS components and impurities having a<br>
retention time, relative to TRIS of less than about 0.9 and in another<br>
embodiments less than about 0.8.<br>
As used herein "substantially free from SWS compounds and<br>
impurities" means the lens has a concentration of SWS compounds and<br>
impurities insufficient to cause ocular discomfort. Ocular discomfort may be<br>
measured by putting contact lenses on the eyes of at least 10 patients, and<br>
collecting subjective information at initial insertion and after 30 minutes of<br>
wear. As used herein ocular discomfort is a score of leas than about 20%,<br>
preferably less than about 10% and preferably less than about 5% of the<br>
subjects noting discomfort at 30 minutes of wear.<br>
As used herein, "ocular discomfort" means a subjective rating of at<br>
least moderate stinging or burning within 30 minutes of insertion of the<br>
contact lens on the eye.<br><br><br>
In one embodiment the reactive mixture comprises SWS compounds<br>
and impurities having a retention time, relative to TRIS specified herein in an<br>
amount of less than about 3000, in another embodiment less than about<br>
1000 ppm, in another embodiment less than about 200 ppm, and in another<br>
embodiment less than about 100 ppm.<br>
In another embodiment the amount in the reactive mixture of SWS<br>
compounds and impurities having the retention time, relative to TRIS<br>
specified herein is not controlled, but the curing conditions are selected to<br>
produce a cured contact lens having less than an ocular discomfort causing<br>
amount of said component or impurity. In one embodiment the less than an<br>
ocular discomfort causing amount of said component or impurity comprises<br>
an amount less than about 2000 ppm based upon the weight of the lens in a<br>
fulty hydrated state.<br>
The reactive mixtures comprise at least one silicone containing<br>
component.<br>
The term components includes monomers macromers and<br>
prepolymers. "Monomer" refers to lower molecular weight compounds that<br>
can be polymerized to higher molecular weight compounds, polymers,<br>
macromers, or prepolymers. The term "macromer" as used herein refers to<br>
a high molecular weight polymerizable compound. Prepolymers are partially<br>
polymerized monomers or monomers which are capable of further<br>
polymerization.<br>
A "silicone-contalning component" is one that contains at least one [-<br>
Si-O-] unit in a monomer, macromer or prepolymer. Preferably, the total Si<br>
and attached O are present in the silicone-containing component in an<br>
amount greater than about 20 weight percent and more preferably greater<br>
than 30 weight percent of the total molecular weight of the silicone-<br>
containing component. Useful silicone-containing components preferably<br>
comprise polymerizable. functional groups such as acrylate, methacryiate,<br>
acrylamide, methacrylamide, vinyl, N-vinyl lactam, N-vinylamide, and styryl<br><br><br>
functional groups. Examples of silicone-containing components which are<br>
useful in this invention may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,808,178; 4,120,570;<br>
4,136,250; 4,153.641; 4,740.533; 5,034,461 and 5.070.215, and EP080639.<br>
These references disclose many examples of olefinic: silicone-containing<br>
components.<br>
While almost any silicone containing component may be included, in<br>
order to provide the lenses of the present invention with the desired<br>
modulus, the majority of the mass fraction of the silicone components used<br>
in the lens formulation should contain only one polymerizable functional<br>
group ("monofunctional silicone containing component"). In silicone<br>
containing lenses, to insure the desired balance of oxygen transmissibility<br>
and modulus it is preferred that all components having more than one<br>
polymerizable functional groups ("multifunctional components") make up no<br>
more than 10 mmol/100 g of the reactive components, and preferably no<br>
more than 7 mmol/100 g of the reactive components. Suitable<br>
monofunctional silicone containing components include<br>

mode equal to a stated value, preferably 2 to 16, more preferably 3 to 10;<br>
R56 is a monovalent group containing at least one ethylenically unsaturated<br>
moiety, preferably a monovalent group containing a styryf, vinyl, or<br>

In some embodiments monofunctional poiydimethylsiloxanes may be<br>
preferred, as they lower not only modulus, but also tan 6, white bulky<br>
silicones, such as those containing at least one branching trimethytslioxy<br>
group will increase tan 6. Accordingly, at least about 30 and preferably at<br>
least about 60 weight% of all the silicone components should be non-bulky<br>
silicone containing compounds such as polydimethyisiloxanes.<br>
In one embodiment, where a silicone hydrogel lens is desired, the<br>
lens of the present invention will be made from a reactive mixture comprising<br>
at least about 20 and preferably between about 20 and 70%wt silicone<br>

Other silicone containing components suitable for use in mis invention<br>
include those described is WO 96/31792 such as macromers containing<br>
potysiloxane. polyalkylene ether, diisocyanate, polyfluorinated hydrocarbon,<br>
polyfluorinated ether and polysaccharide groups. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,321,108;<br>

graft or side group having a hydrogen atom attached to a terminal difluoro-<br>
substituted carbon atom. US 2002/0016383 describe hydrophilic siloxanyl<br>
methacrylates containing ether and siloxanyl linkanges and crosslinkable<br>
monomers containing polyether and polysiloxanyl groups. Any of the<br>
foregoing polysiloxanes can also be used as the silicone containing<br>
component in this invention.<br><br>
The reactive mixture may also comprise at least one hydrophilic<br>
component. Hydrophilic monomers can be any of the hydrophilic monomers<br>
known to be useful to make hydrogels.<br>
One class of suitable hydrophilic monomers include acrylic- or vinyl-<br>
containing monomers. Such hydrophilic monomers may themselves be<br>
used as crosslinking agents, however, where hydrophilic monomers having<br>
more than one polymerizable functional group are used, their concentration<br>
should be limited as discussed above to provide a contact lens having the<br>
desired modulus. The term "vinyl-type" or "vinyl-containing" monomers refer<br>
to monomers containing the vinyl grouping (-CH=CH2) and are generally<br>
highly reactive. Such hydrophilic vinyl-containing monomers are known to<br>
polymerize relatively easily.<br>
"Acrylic-type" or "acrylic-containing" monomers are those monomers<br>
containing the acrylic group: (CH2=RCOX) wherein R is H or CH3. and X is<br>
O or N. which are also known to polymerize readily, such as N.N-dimethyl<br>
acrylamide (DMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), glycerol<br>
methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylamide, polyethyleneglycol<br>
monomethacrylate, methacrylic acid and acrylic acid.<br>
Hydrophilic vinyl-containing monomers which may be incorporated<br>
into the silicone hydrogels of the present invention include monomers such<br>
as N-vinyl amides, N-vinyl lactams (e.g. NVP), N-vinyl-N-methyl acetamjde,<br>
N-vinyl-N-ethyl acetamide, N-vinyl-N-ethyl formamide, N-vinyl formamide,<br>
with NVP being preferred.<br>
Other hydrophilic monomers that can be employed in the invention<br>
include polyoxyethylene polyols having one or more of the terminal hydroxyl<br>
groups replaced with a functional group containing a polymerizable double<br>
bond. Examples include polyethylene glycol, ethoxylated alkyl glucoside,<br>
and ethoxylated bisphenol A reacted with one or more molar equivalents of<br>
an end-capping group such as isocyanatoethyl methacrylate OEM"),<br>
methacrylic anhydride, methacryloyl chloride, vinylbenzoyl chloride, or the<br><br><br>
like, to produce a polyethylene polyol having one or more terminal<br>
polymerizable olefinic groups bonded to the polyethylene* polyol through<br>
linking moieties such as carbamate or ester groups.<br>
Still further examples are the hydrophilic vinyl carbonate or vinyl<br>
carbamate monomers disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 5,070,215, and the<br>
hydrophilic oxazolone monomers disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 4,910,277.<br>
Other suitable hydrophilic monomers will be apparent to one skilled in the<br>
art<br>
In one embodiment the hydrophilic comprises at least one hydrophilic<br>
monomer such as DMA, HEMA, glycerol methacrytate,. 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylamide, NVP, N-vinyl-N-methyl acrylamide, polyethylenegfycol<br>
monomethacrylate, methacrylic acid and acrylic acid with DMA being the<br>
most preferred.<br>
The hydrophilic monomers may be present in a wide range of<br>
amounts, depending upon the specific balance of properties desired.<br>
Amounts of hydrophilic monomer up to about 50 and preferably between<br>
about 5 and about 50 weight %. based upon all components in the reactive<br>
components are acceptable. For example, in one embodiment lenses of the<br>
present invention comprise a water content of at least about 25%, and in<br>

thereof and the like. Illustrative examples of photoinitiators are 1-<br>
hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone, 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propan-1-<br>
one, bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4-trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide<br>
(DMBAPO), bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenyl phospNneoxide (Irgacure<br>
819), 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyldiphenyl phosphine oxide and 2,4,6-<br>

Specialty Chemicals) and Lucirin TPO initiator (available from BASF).<br>
Commercially available UV photoinitiators include Darocur 1173 and Darocur<br>
2959 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals). These and other photoinitators which may<br>
be used are disclosed in Volume III, Photoinitiators for Free Radical Cattonic<br>
&amp; Anionic Photopolymerization, 2nd Edition by J.V. Crivello&amp; K. Dietliken<br>
edited by G. Bradley; John Wiley and Sons; New York; 1998. The initiator is<br>
used in the reaction mixture in effective amounts to initiate<br>
photopolymerization of the reaction mixture, e.g., from about 0.1 to about 2<br>
parts by weight per 100 parts of reactive monomer. Polymerization of the<br>
reaction mixture can be initiated using the appropriate choice of heat or<br>
visible or ultraviolet light or other means depending on the polymerization<br>
initiator used. Alternatively, initiation can be conducted without a<br>
photoinitiator using, for example, e-beam. However, when a photoinitiator is<br>
used, the preferred initiators are bisacylphosphine oxides, such as bis(2,4,6-<br><br><br>
trimethylbenzoyl)-phenyl phosphine oxide (Irgacure 819®) or a combination<br>
of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone and bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4-<br>
trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide (DMBAPO). and in another embodiment the<br>
method of polymerization initiation is via visible light activation. A preferred<br>
initiator is bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenyl phosphine oxide (Irgacure<br>
819®).<br>
The reactive components (silicone containing component, hydropnilic<br>
monomers, lubricious polymers, and other components which are reacted to<br>
form the lens) are mixed together either with or without a diluent to form the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
In one embodiment a diluent is used having a polarity sufficiently low to<br>
solubilize the non-polar components in the reactive mixture at reaction<br>
conditions. One way to characterize the polarity of the diluents of the<br>
present invention is via the Hansen solubility parameter, 6p. In certain<br>
embodiments, the Sp is less than about 10, and preferably less than about 6.<br>
Suitable diluents are further disclosed in US Ser. No 60/452898 and US<br>
6,020,445.<br>
Classes of suitable diluents include, without limitation, alcohols having 2 to<br>
20 carbons, amides having 10 to 20 carbon atoms derived from primary<br>
amines, ethers, polyetners, ketones having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, and<br>
carboxylic acids having 8 to 20 carbon atoms. For all solvents, as the<br>
number of carbons increase, the number of polar moieties may also be<br>
increased to provide the desired level of water misdbility. In some<br>
embodiments, primary and tertiary alcohols are preferred. Preferred classes<br>
include alcohols having 4 to 20 carbons and carboxylic acids having 10 to 20<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
Preferred diluents include diluents that have some degree of solubility in<br>
water. In some embodiments at least five percent of the diluent is misdble<br>
water. Examples of water soluble diluents include 1-decanol, 1-octanol, 1-<br><br><br>

acid, dodecanotc acid, 1-ethoxy-2- propanol, 1-tert-butoxy-2-propanol, EH-5<br>
(commercially available from Ethox Chemicals), 2,3,6.7-tetrahydroxy-2,3,6,7-<br>
tetramethyl octane, 9-(1-methylethyl)-.2,58,10,13,16-hexaoxaheptadecane,<br>
3,5,7,9,11,13-hexamethoxy-1-tetradecano), mixtures thereof and the like.<br>
The reactive mixture of the present invention may be cured via any<br>
known process for molding the reaction mixture in the production of contact<br>
lenses, including spincasting and static casting. Spincasting methods are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,408,429 and 3,660,545, and static casting<br>
methods are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,113,224 and 4,197,266. In<br>
one embodiment the contact lenses of this invention are formed by the<br>
direct molding of the silicone hydrogels, which is economical, and enables<br>
precise control over the final shape of the hydrated lens. For this method,<br>
the reaction mixture is placed in a mold having the shape of the final desired<br>
silicone hydrogel, i.e. water-swollen polymer, and the reaction mixture is<br>
subjected to conditions whereby the monomers polymerize, to thereby<br>
produce a polymer in the approximate shape of the final desired product.<br>
After curing the tens is treated to remove unreacted components and<br>
release the lens from the lens mold.<br>
As used herein, the term 'treat" means to expose a cured lens to an<br>
aqueous solution, but excludes equilibration, sterilization and storage of the<br>
lens. Aqueous solutions are solutions which primarily comprise water. In<br>
one embodiment the aqueous solutions of the present invention comprise at<br>
least about 70 % water and in others at least about 90 weight% water.<br>
Aqueous solutions may also include additional water soluble components<br>
such as release agents, wetting agents, slip agents, pharmaceutical and<br>
nutraceutical components, combinations thereof and the like. Release<br>
agents are compounds or mixtures of compounds which, when combined<br><br><br>
with water, decrease the time required to release a contact lens from a mold,<br>
as compared to the time required to release such a lens using an aqueous<br>
solution that does not comprise the release agent. In one embodiment the<br>
aqueous solutions comprise less than about 10 weight %, and in others less<br>
than about 5 weight % organic solvents such as isopropyl alcohol, and in<br>
another embodiment are free from organic solvents, in these embodiments<br>
the aqueous solutions do not require special handling, such as purification,<br>
recycling or special disposal procedures.<br>
In various embodiments, treatment can be accomplished, for<br>
example, via immersion of the lens in an aqueous solution or exposing the<br>
lens to a flow of an aqueous solution. In various embodiments, treatment<br>
can also include, for example, one or more of heating the aqueous solution;<br>
stirring the aqueous solution; increasing the level of release aid in the<br>
aqueous solution to a level sufficient to cause release of the lens;<br>
mechanical agitation of the tens; and incorporating at least one leach aid in<br>
the aqueous solution to a level sufficient to facilitate adequate removal of<br>
unreacted components from the lens.<br>
Treatment may be conducted by various implementations, such as<br>
but not limited to a batch process wherein lenses are submerged in a<br>
solution contained in a fixed tank for a specified period of time or in a vertical<br>
process where lenses are exposed to a continuous flow of an aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
In some embodiments the aqueous solution can be heated with a<br>
heat exchanger or other heating apparatus to further facilitate leaching of the<br>
lens and release of the lens from a mold part For example, heating can<br>
include raising the temperature of an aqueous solution to the boiling point<br>
while a hydrogel lens and mold part to which the lens is adhered are<br>
submerged in the heated aqueous solution. Other embodiments can include<br>
controlled cycling of the temperature of the aqueous solution.<br><br>
Sonne embodiments can also include the application of physical<br>
agitation to facilitate leach and release. For example, the lens mold part to<br>
which a lens is adhered, can be vibrated or caused to move back and forth<br>
within an aqueous solution. Other embodiments may include ultrasonic<br>
waves through the aqueous solution.<br>
These and other similar processes can provide an acceptable means<br>
of releasing the lens.<br>
As used herein, "released from a mold" means that a lens is either<br>
completely separated from the mold, or is only loosely attached so that it can<br>
be removed with mild agitation or pushed off with a swab. In the process of<br>
the present invention the conditions used include temperature less than<br>
99ºC for less than about 1 hour.<br>
The lenses of the present invention require minimal treatment. The<br>
treatment is conducted with aqueous solutions for times less than about 6<br>
hours, in some embodiments less than about 4 hours, less than about 2<br>
hours and sometimes less than about 1 hour.<br>
The lenses of the present invention require minimal post treatment<br>
Post treatment is an optional part of treatment and includes solution<br>
exchange and extraction but not sterilization, storage and equilibration. In<br>
embodiments where post treatment is included, the post treatment is<br>
conducted with aqueous solutions for times less than about 6 hours, in some<br>
embodiments less than about 4 hours, less than about 2 hours and<br>
sometimes less than about 1 hour.<br>
The treated lenses may be sterilized by known means such as, but<br>
not limited to autoclaving.<br>
It will be appreciated that all of the tests specified herein have a<br>
certain amount of inherent test error. Accordingly, results reported herein<br>
are not to be taken as absolute numbers, but numerical ranges based upon<br>
the precision of the particular test.<br><br><br>
In order to illustrate the invention the following examples are included.<br>
These examples do not limit the invention. They are meant only to suggest<br>
a method of practicing the invention. Those knowledgeable in contact<br>
lenses as well as other specialties may find other methods of practicing the<br>
invention. However, those methods are deemed to be within the scope of<br>
this invention.<br>
