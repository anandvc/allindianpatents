The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a slope planting structure, and more particularly to one having slope protection and green effects.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
    A conventional slope structure is composed of cement, stone, steel bar, sand, and earth.  The process of construction is complicated.  It needs fixing mold plates by manpower for pouring concrete.  After pouring concrete, the concrete needs protection for shaping and solidifying.  Besides, after the slope is completed, the slope needs vegetation, i.e. landscape engineering, to prevent the soil on the surface of the slope from being washed away by rain.  The conventional concrete slope structure is not pervious to water.  Therefore, it needs an additional system to drain water.  The effect to drain water is not perfect because the system may be blocked by earth and stones, causing the soil on the surface to be washed away by rain.  Sometimes, the soil of the slope contains abundant water, causing mudflows and landslides to destroy the slope structure.<br>
Thus it can be seen, the conventional slope structure is complicated and time-consuming.  The concrete structure is not environmental and beautiful, and is easy to be damaged.  Besides, the conventional slope structure causes destruction to ecology.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is to overcome the shortcomings of the prior art.  The primary object of the present invention is to provide a slope planting structure for plant growing so as to achieve environmental protection and beauty effects and to secure and protect the slope.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a slope planting structure, comprising containing bags laid on the surface of a slope, stuffing filled in the containing bags, and fasteners, the containing bags being provided with plant seeds, the stuffing comprising plant growing material and being filled into the containing bags, the containing bags being laid on the surface of the slope, the fasteners being inserted through the containing bags to secure the containing bags on the slope, the containing bags being integrated with the slope to secure the slope for providing protection and greening.<br>
The plant seeds are sprinkled on the surface of the containing bags, mixed with the stuffing and filled into the containing bags, or disposed between every two of the containing bags.<br>
The containing bags are ventilative and pervious to water for plant growing.<br>
The plant growing material of the stuffing is soil, organic soil or any material to assist plant growing.<br>
The stuffing further comprises absorbent material.  The absorbent material being is absorbent resin in order to keep moisture for the plants.<br>
Each of the fasteners is a bullet head nail, a bulged nail, a spiral nail, or a nail with a spacer.  Each of the fasteners may have a hook, depending on the demand.  The fasteners are to secure the containing bags on the slope firmly.<br>
Each of the containing bags is made in the form of a unitary block or a unitary rod.  The containing bags made in the form of a unitary rod are arranged longitudinally from an upper end of the slope to a lower end of the slope.  The bottoms of the containing bags are covered with soil.  The containing bags made in the form of a unitary rod may be arranged transversally from an inclination of the slope to a side of the slope.  A connecting buckle is provided between every two of the containing bags for connecting and securing the containing bags transversally.  The connecting buckle comprises a protrusion or a protrusion having a hook to connect the tops or the bottoms of every two of the containing bags.  The connecting buckle may have a central hole.  The central hole of the connecting buckle is adapted for insertion of the fastener.<br>
Compared to the prior art, the present invention has the following advantages.<br>
1. The present invention covers an entire slope or a partial slope to provide a green layer for plant growing, securing and protecting the slope as well as greening and beautifying the slope.<br>

The containing bag 2 is made in the form of a unitary rod.  The containing bag 2 is arranged from an upper end of the slope 1 to a lower end of the slope 1, and the bottom of the containing bag 2 may be covered with earth (or not be covered with earth).  The number of the fasteners 5 depends on the gradient of the slope 1 for enhancing the rod-shaped containing bags 2 integrated to the slope 2.  In this embodiment, the plant seeds 4 are mixed with the stuffing 3.  The containing bag 2, the stuffing 3, the fasten 5 are the same as the aforesaid embodiments and don’t be described hereinafter.<br>
	Fig. 4 is a schematic view of a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention, which is substantially similar to the third embodiment with the exceptions described hereinafter.  The plant seeds 4 are not mixed with the stuffing 3.  The plant seeds 4 are sprinkled on the surface of each containing bag 2 after the containing bags 2 are laid on the slope 1.<br>
	Fig. 5 is a schematic view of a fifth preferred embodiment of the present invention, which is substantially similar to the third embodiment with the exceptions described hereinafter.  A number of connecting buckles 6 are provided between two adjacent containing bags 2 for connecting the containing bags 2 and integrating the containing bags 2 with the slope 1.  In this embodiment, the plant seeds 4 are mixed with the stuffing 3 and then filled into the containing bags 2.<br>
	Referring to the Figs. 9a and 9b, the connecting buck 6 is a board provided with at least two protrusions 61 for enhancing the connection of the containing bags 2.   Each protrusion 61 may be provided with a hook 62.  In addition, the connecting buckle 6 may have a hole 63 for insertion of the fastener 5 so that the connecting buckle 6 is fixed on the slope 1 firmly.<br>
	Referring to Figs. 10a and 10b, the protrusion 61 or the protrusion 61 having the hook 62 of the connecting buckle 6 without a hole is to connect the bottoms of two adjacent containing bags 2.  Referring to Figs. 10c and 10d, the protrusion 61 or the protrusion 61 having the hook 62 of the connecting buckle 6 with the hole 63 is to connect the tops of two adjacent containing bags 2.  The fastener is inserted through the hole 63 to secure the connecting buckle 6 on the slope 1.  Referring to Figs. 10e and 10f, the protrusion 61 or the protrusion 61 having the hook 62 of the connecting buckle 6 with the hole 63 is to connect the bottoms of two adjacent containing bags 2.

	Fig. 6 is a schematic view of a sixth preferred embodiment of the present invention, which is substantially similar to the fifth embodiment with the exceptions described hereinafter.  The plant seeds 4 are not mixed with the stuffing 3.  The plant seeds 4 are sprinkled on the surface of each containing bag 2 after the containing bags 2 are laid on the slope 1.<br>
	Furthermore, the plant seeds 4 may be sprinkled in between every two adjacent containing bags 2.  This also has the same effects of plant sprouting and growing, and will not be limited.<br>
	Fig. 7 is a schematic view of a seventh preferred embodiment of the present invention, which is substantially similar to the third embodiment with the exceptions described hereinafter.  The rod-shaped containing bags 2 are laid transversely from the inclination to the side of the slope 1.  In this embodiment, the connecting buckles are also used to connect every two adjacent containing bags, and the arrangement of the plant seeds are the same as the aforesaid embodiments to do difference changes.<br>
	As shown in Figs. 1 through 6, after completing the present invention, the plant growing material and absorbent material in the stuffing 3 need watering to keep moisture for a long time.  Even in a drought season, the stuffing 3 is able to provide moisture to the plant seeds 4.  The plant seeds 4 sprout and grow up to extend from the top of the containing bag 2, and the roots of the plants extend downward and pass through the bottom of the containing bag 2 into the soil of the slope 1.  When the slope 1 is soft material, such as soil, the roots and stems of the plants extend into the soil of the slope 1 to from a permanent natural slope.  When the slope 1 is hard material, such as stones and cement, the present invention also provides a green effect.  The containing bags 2 adapted for plant growing are integrated with the slope 1, preventing the soil from being washed away and enhancing beauty, environmental protection, ecology and green effects.<br>
	The present invention covers an entire slope or a partial slope to provide a green layer for plant growing, securing and protecting the slope as well as greening and beautifying the slope.  The materials of the present invention are made of environmental materials, which can be used on any natural slope, such as cement, stone or earth, to provide a green ecology, to improve the air and to absorb heat and noise.<br>
