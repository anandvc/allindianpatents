				<td>DERIVATIVES OF ISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE AND PHARMACEUTICAL<br>
COMPOSITION CONTAINING THE SAME FOR TREATMENT OF<br>
CARDIOVASCULAR OR CORONARY DYSFUNCTIONS, OR FOR<br>
TREATMENT OF DYSFUNCTIONS OF CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel derivatives of isosorbide mononitrate<br>
which have a potent vasodilating activity and which, at the same time, have a<br>
significantly reduced tolerance, and in particular, pharmaceutical composition<br>
containing the same for treatment of cardiovascular or coronary dysfunctions, or for<br>
treatment of dysfunctions of circulatory system.<br>
Background art<br>
The nitric acid esters of organic: compounds,<br>
common known as nitrated organic compounds, are known<br>
and have been used as vasodilating agents. Within<br>
these, the usefulness of mono and di-nitrated isosor-<br>
bide is well known, and further there have been de-<br>
scribed compounds with vascular and coronary activities<br>
based on substitution reactions of the free hydroxyl<br>
group of isosorbide mononitrate- For example, the US-A-<br>
4891373 patent describes derivatives of aminepropanol<br>
corresponding to the formulas<br>
for the treatment of the angina pectoris and systemic<br>
and pulmonary hypertension.<br>
The US-A-5665766 patent describes the isosor-<br>
bide 5-mononitrate 2-acetylsalicylate, of formula<br>
as well as its platelets anti-aggregating activity.<br>
One of the principal problems of the nitrated<br>
organic compounds mentioned above resides on the fact<br>
that these are quite sensible in relation to the phe-<br>
nomena known as tachyphylaxy or tolerance, which re-<br>
lates to that its effect on the organism decreases dur-<br>
ing prolonged treatment, and it is then required to<br>
sensitively elevate the administrated doses in a gradu-<br>
ated manner or otherwise to perform a pharmacologically<br>
wash out.<br>
It is also known that one way of reducing the<br>
tolerance of the nitrated organic compounds consists of<br>
introducing a thiol group in the molecule, for example<br>
by use of sulphur containing amino acids. The European<br>
patent EP-B-0362575 describes nitrated organic com-<br>
pounds with incorporated Cysteine and/ mainly, Methion-<br>
ine molecules.<br>
The patent application WO-A-92/04337 de-<br>
scribes organic nitrated derivatives of the ring of the<br>
thiazolidine with vasodilating activity and a reduced<br>
tolerance.<br>
The patent application WO-A-93/03037 de-<br>
scribes an enormously amount of different nitrated or-<br>
ganic vasodilating compounds, with reduced tolerance,<br>
of highly variable structures. Within these are in-<br>
cluded generically, i.e. without specifying nor de-<br>
scribing one single specific product, derivatives of<br>
isosorbide mononitrate according to following structure<br>
in which R5 represents a hydrogen atom, a C1-C6 alkyl<br>
group, a phenyl, etc.<br>
The nitrated organic compounds described in<br>
the documents mentioned above do not in itself solve<br>
the problems originating from the tolerance of the ni-<br>
trated organic compounds, since these still have prob-<br>
lems in relation to low vasodilating activity, high<br>
tolerance, etc.. Accordingly, it is still necessary to<br>
develop novel nitrated organic compounds which have a<br>
high vasodilating activity combined with a more de-<br>
creased level of tolerance being maintained persis-<br>
tently.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
An object of the invention is a novel type of<br>
compounds, derivatives of isosorbide mononitrate, which<br>
are capable of providing a potent vasodilating effect<br>
and which at the same time show a small or null toler-<br>
ance effect.<br>
A further object of the present invention re-<br>
lates to the use of the novel derivatives of isosorbide<br>
mononitrate for the manufacture of a medicament for the<br>
treatment of disorders related to dysfunctions of the<br>
circulatory system, in particular at the level of the<br>
coronary system.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a<br>
 derivative of isosorbide mononitrate, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, having the<br>
following general formula (I)<br>
wherein one of A and B represents -ONO2 and the other<br>
represents<br>
wherein:<br>
either (i) Z is a sulphur atom and R is an<br>
optionally substituted C1-C4 alkyl group, an<br>
optionally substituted aryl group or an<br>
optionally substituted aralkyl group;<br>
or (ii) Z is an oxygen atom and R is the group<br>
v/herein R1 is hydrogen or an optionally<br>
substituted C1-C4 alkyl group, an optionally<br>
substituted aryl group or an optionally<br>
substituted aralkyl group.<br>
Within the novel derivatives of the invention<br>
it is preferred that when Z is a sulphur atom, R is. a<br>
short chain C1-C4 alkyl group, and when Z is an oxygen<br>
atom, R1 is a hydrogen atom or a short chain C1-C4 alkyl<br>
group. More preferably, within above mentioned crite-<br>
ria, B is the -ONO2 group, i.e. the compounds wherein<br>
the nitrate ester is at position 5 in the ring-shaped<br>
system of the isosorbide.<br>
The preferences mentioned above should not in<br>
any way be considered as limiting the scope of the ob-<br>
ject of the present invention.<br>
In case R1 is hydrogen the compounds of the<br>
invention could be represented as any of its two<br>
tautomers<br>
and both of the tautomer structures should be consid-<br>
ered as within the object of the invention.<br>
Examples of specific compounds within the ob-<br>
ject of the invention.could be following:<br>
isosorbide 2- (2'-ethylthio)nicotinate 5-mononitrate, of<br>
formula<br>
isosorbide 5-(2'-ethylthio)nicotinate 2-mononitrate, of<br>
formula<br>
isosorbide 2-(2'-mercapto)nicotinate 5-mononitrate, of<br>
formula<br>
isosorbide 5-{2'-mercapto)nicotinate 2-mononitrate, of<br>
formula<br>
2-acetylmercaptoisosorbide 5-mononitrate, of formula<br>
isosorbide 2-(2'-methylthio)nicotinate 5-mononitrate,<br>
of formula<br>
isosorbide 5-(2'-ethylthio)nicotinate 2-mononitrate, of<br>
formula<br>
as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of<br>
these, in particular their chlorhydrates.<br>
The compounds 1 and its chlorhydrate and the<br>
compound 5 are particularly preferred.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be<br>
obtained by techniques of esterification using known or<br>
accessible starting products described in the basic or-<br>
ganic chemical literature known to the skilled person,<br>
for example the publications of Chemical Abstracts Ser-<br>
vice, the Beilstein Encyclopedia of organic products,<br>
or in any other appropriate publication available at<br>
university libraries.<br>
For example, when Z is an oxygen atom the<br>
compounds may be obtained from isosorbide or the corre-<br>
sponding isosorbide mononitrate through a reaction of<br>
esterification of these with the corresponding carbox-<br>
ylic acid or an activated derivative of this, for exam-<br>
ple an acid chloride, an anhydride, an active ester,<br>
etc. If the starting product is isosorbide, it will be<br>
necessary finishing with a further step consisting of<br>
nitrating the free hydroxyl group of the isosorbide, a<br>
thing which is not necessary if there is started from<br>
any of the isosorbide mononitrates in position 5 or in<br>
position 2 of the ring-shaped structure of said com-<br>
pound .<br>
When R1 is hydrogen, these compounds have<br>
a thiol group which can be unintentionally oxidized<br>
producing disulphur dimers. In this case, the dimers<br>
can be reverted to the corresponding monomers by reac-<br>
tion with triphenylphosphine in water, as described in<br>
R. Humphrey (1964), Analytical Chem,36,1812 y<br>
L.E.Overman (1974), Synthesis, 59.<br>
When Z is a sulphur atom the situation is<br>
very similar since it is enough to start from the cor-<br>
responding thiocarboxylic acid, in stead of the carbox-<br>
ylic acid mentioned above, and to use techniques well<br>
known to the expert for the formation of the thioester<br>
bond. On the other hand, if any of the reactions imply<br>
the epimerization of a chiral center, there may be used<br>
as a starting compound the adequate enantiomer of the<br>
isosorbide, for example the isomanide.<br>
The tests performed demonstrate that the<br>
novel isosorbide mononitrate derivatives of the inven-<br>
tion show a vasodilating activity comparable, as a<br>
minimum, with that of the isosorbide mononitrate by it-<br>
self, and in some cases highly superior. Further, they<br>
manifest a significant inferior tolerance as compared<br>
to that observed with said compound and in some cases<br>
it approaches practically null.<br>
Consequently, the compounds of the invention<br>
may very efficiently be used for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament with vasodilating effect for the treatment<br>
of dysfunctions of the circulatory system, in particu-<br>
lar at the cardiovascular and coronary level.<br>
Accordingly, the compounds of the general<br>
formula (I), as well as their pharmaceutically accept-<br>
able salts, may be used, via the use of conventional<br>
pharmaceutical techniques, in the manufacture of me-<br>
dicaments which may be administrated by different<br>
routes.<br>
For example they may be administrated orally<br>
in form of pharmaceutically preparations such as tab-<br>
lets, capsules, syrups and suspensions. Parenterally in<br>
form of solutions or emulsions, etc. They may also be<br>
administrated topically in form of creams, pomades,<br>
balsams, etc., and transdermically for example through<br>
the use of patches or bandages. They may also be ap-<br>
plied directly in the rectum as suppositories. The<br>
preparations may comprise physiologically acceptable<br>
carriers, excipients, activators, chelating agents,<br>
stabilisators, etc. In case of injections there may be<br>
incorporated physiologically acceptable buffers, solu-<br>
bilizing agents or isotonics. The daily dose may be<br>
varied depending on the specific symptoms, the age, the<br>
body weight of the patients, the specific mode of ad-<br>
ministration, etc., and a daily normal dose for an<br>
adult person could be between 1 to 500 mg, and could be<br>
administrated as one dose only or divided into several<br>
doses during the day.<br>
In the working examples herein (vide infra)<br>
are described in details suitable processes to obtain<br>
various of the compounds according to the general for-<br>
mula (I) . In view of these examples, it is within the<br>
skilled persons general knowledge to obtain the com-<br>
pounds not explicitly exemplified herein via suitable<br>
modifications the of working examples herein.<br>
Consequently, the working examples herein<br>
should not be interpreted as limiting the scope of the<br>
invention, but solely as an additional detailed expli-<br>
cation, which guides the skilled person to a more<br>
deeply understanding of the invention.<br>

refrigerator, closed with a CaCl2 tube, and magnetic<br>
agitation, 4.25 g (23.2 mmol) 2-ethylthionicotinate<br>
acid are dissolved in 20 mL of thionyl chloride (1.64<br>
g/ml; 275.6 mmol). The reaction mixture is refluxed for<br>
3.5 h. After this period, the mixture is cooled down<br>
and excess thionyl chloride is eliminated under reduced<br>
pressure while adding portions of toluene. After drying<br>
at reduced pressure, 4.67 g of a solid yellowish prod-<br>
uct corresponding to the acid chloride of interest are<br>
obtained. Yield: 100%.<br>
Step 2.- In a 50 ml glass flask, provided with magnetic<br>
agitation and reflux refrigerator, 4.67 g (23.2 mmol)<br>

dissolved, under Ar atmosphere, in 25 ml pyridine. The<br>
solution is cooled down in a ice bath and 4.44 g (23.2<br>
mmol) of isosorbide 5-mononitrate are added. The reac-<br>
tion mixture is agitated at room temperature under Ar<br>
atmosphere for 19 h. After this period the solvent is<br>
eliminated at reduced pressure. The residue is dis-<br>
solved in 50 mL of CHC13 and washed: first with 50 mL of<br>
water, secondly with 50 mL aqueous solution of 5% HC1<br>
and once more with 50 mL water. The organic phase is<br>
dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and the solvent is<br>
eliminated at reduced pressure. After drying at reduced<br>
pressure, 7.25 g of the product of interest are ob-<br>
tained. Yield: 88%.<br>
Step 3.- In a 250 ml three neck glass flask, provided<br>

pressure, 3.35 g of a solid yellow-orange corresponding<br>
to the acid chloride of interest are obtained. Yield,<br>
100%.<br>
Step 2.- In a 250 mL glass flask, provided with a re-<br>
flux refrigerator and magnetic agitation, 3.0 g (17.29<br>
mmol) of the acid chloride obtained in the former step<br>
are suspended, under Ar atmosphere, in 75 mL of pyri-<br>
dine. The suspension is cooled down in an ice bath and<br>
3.30 g (17.29 mmol) of isosorbide 5-mononitrate are<br>
added. The reaction mixture is left agitating at room<br>
temperature under Ar atmosphere for 19 h, a period of<br>
time wherein the mixture is getting dark. Once the re-<br>
action finished, the solvent is eliminated at reduced<br>
pressure. The residue is dissolved in 250 mL of CHCI=<br>
and washed: first with 250 mL of water, secondly with<br>
250 mL aqueous solution of 5% HC1 and once more with<br>
250 mL water. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous<br>
MgSO4, filtered, and the solvent is eliminated at re-<br>
duced pressure. After drying at reduced pressure, 5.45<br>
g of a yellow solid are obtained, which are re-<br>
crystallized in isopropanol to obtain 4.83 g of a white<br>
solid which is reacted in acid medium for 20 rain, with<br>
triphenylphosphine (1:1.25 mol/mol) in methanol, with a<br>
10% of water. The solvent is eliminated at reduced pre-<br>
sureand the residue is disolved in AcOEt, washing the<br>
solution with some water. The organic phase is dried<br>
and the solvent is eliminated at reduced presure, re-<br>
covering the product of interest by preparative chroma-<br>
tography. Yield: 35.7%.<br>

In a 250 mL glass flask, provided with a reflux refrig-<br>
erator and magnetic agitation, 3.0 g (17.29 mmol) of<br>
the acid chloride obtained in step 1 of example 3 are<br>
suspended, under Ar atmosphere, in a mixture of 50 ml<br>
pyridine and 25 mL of CHCI3. The suspension is cooled<br>
down in an ice bath and 3.30 g (17.29 mmol) of isosor-<br>
bide 2-mononitrate are added. The reaction mixture is<br>
left agitating at room temperature under Ar atmosphere<br>
for 19 h, a period of time wherein the mixture is get-<br>
ting dark. Once the reaction finished, the solvent is<br>
eliminated at reduced pressure. The residue is dis-<br>
solved in 300 mL of CHC13 and washed: first with 300 mL<br>
of water, secondly with 300 mL aqueous solution of 5%<br>
HC1 and once more with 300 mL water. The organic phase<br>
is dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and the solvent<br>
is eliminated at reduced pressure. After drying at re-<br>
duced temperature, 5.10 g of a white-yellowish solid<br>
are obtained, which are re-crystallized in isopropanol<br>
to obtain 4.55 g of a white solid which is reacted in<br>
acid medium for 20 min. with triphenylphosphine (1:1.25<br>
mol/mol) in methanol, with a 10% of water. The solvent<br>
is eliminated at reduced presure and the residue is<br>
disolved in AcOEt, washing the solution with some wa-<br>
ter. The organic phase is dried and the solvent is<br>
eliminated at reduced presure, recovering the product<br>
of interest by preparative chromatography. Yield:<br>

Example 5.- Obtaining 2-acetylmercaptoisosorbide 5-<br>
mononi-trate (5) .<br>
Step 1.- In a 1 L glass flask provided with a reflux<br>
refrigerator, an addition funnel with a compensated<br>
pressure, and magnetic agitation, 60 g (411 mmol) of<br>
isomanide, 88 g (461 mmol) of paratoluenesulfonyl chld-<br>
rine, 296 mL of CCI4, 33 mL of CH2C12 and 247 mL of H20<br>
are mixed. An Ar atmosphere is made and a solution of<br>
29.9 g (453 mmol) of 85% KOH is added, drop by drop,<br>
while maintaining the reaction temperature at 5° C. The<br>
period of time of the addition is 1 h 20 min. The re-<br>
sulting mixture is agitated at 5° C for 7 h. The solid<br>
is filtered and with 2 x 125 mL portions of H2O and<br>
dried at reduced pressure.<br>
The obtained solid is re-crystallized in 1200<br>
mL of CCI4, hot filtered and the filtrate is left to<br>
cool down. The obtained crystals are filtered and<br>
washed yielding 54.5 g of a fraction A of the product<br>
of interest, monotosilate of isomanide.<br>
The, after the hot filtering, resulting solid<br>
is re-crystallized in 1000 mL of CCI4 obtaining 29.5 g<br>
of a fraction B of the product of interest.<br>
Step 2.- In a 500 mL glass flask provided with a reflux<br>
refrigerator and magnetic agitation, 22.7 g (76 mmol)<br>
of monotosilate of isomanide and 13.0 g (113 mmol) of<br>
potassium thioacetate are mixed in 113 mL of n-butanol.<br>
An Ar atmosphere is made and the reaction mixture is<br>
let to reflux for 1 h. The mixture is cooled down, fil-<br>
tered and washed with 200 mL ethanol and the solvents<br>
are eliminated at reduced pressure. 20 g of a solid are<br>
obtained.<br>
A thin layer chromatographic analysis with<br>
independent sample shows that the product of interest<br>
is not a major part of the crude.<br>
The obtained crude is treated with 300 mL of<br>
n-butanol and 40 mL of thioacetic acid and refluxed for<br>
1 h. The mixture is left to cool down and filtered over<br>
a SiO2 layer. The solvents of the filtrate are evapo-<br>
rated at reduced pressure and a crude is obtained which<br>
is submitted to a Flash chromatography.<br>
For the chromatographic separation a mixture<br>
CHCl3/AcOEt 4:1 is used as eluent. A fraction of 4.14 g<br>
of 2-acetylmercaptoisosorbide is obtained, sufficiently<br>
pure to be used in the subsequent step of synthesis.<br>
Various fractions of product of interest are obtained<br>
with quite a lot of impurity. These last fractions are<br>
submitted to reverse phase preparative chromatography<br>
for purification of the wanted product.<br>
Step 3.- A nitrating mixture is prepared by addiing,<br>
slowly and carefully, 2.4 ml of 60% HNO3 into a mixture<br>
of 10 mL of acetic anhydride and 10 mL of acetic acid.<br>
The mixture is prepared at 0° C.<br>
In a 100 mL glass flask provided with a re-<br>
flux refrigerator and magnetic agitation, 2.51 g (12.3<br>
mmol) of the product obtained in the former step are<br>
dissolved at 0° C in 14.5 mL of acetic acid and, after<br>
agitation for a while the nitrated mixture previously<br>
made is added drop by drop, for 20 minutes, while main-<br>
taining the temperature at 0° C. The reaction mixture<br>
is agitated for 2 h at 0° C, the crude is poured on 200<br>
mL water, and the resulting mixture is extracted with 3<br>
x 200 mL portions of AcOEt. Each of the three portions<br>
are washed separately with 2 x 220 mL portions of a<br>
saturated NaHCO3 solution and 200 mL of water. The ob-<br>
tained solution is dried on Na2SO4, filtered, and the<br>
solvents are eliminated at reduced pressure. 2.4 g of a<br>
crude are obtained which are submitted to a Flash Chro-<br>
matography using a mixture of CHCl3/AcOEt 25:1 as elu-<br>
ent. 2.0.8 g of product de interest are obtained. Yield:<br>

Example 8.- Tests for vasodilatation.<br>
The method used in the assays is substan-<br>
tially the same as described in following references:<br>

The different compounds are tested at 5 dif-<br>
ferent concentrations, at a concentration range from<br>
0.001 y 10 mM, using from 6 to 9 arterial rings for<br>
each compound. The obtained • results are compared to<br>
those from the isosorbide 5-mononitrate, which is used<br>
as reference product.<br>
The results are shown in table 1 below and<br>
are provided as CEso (concentration effective 50)/ which<br>
is the concentration of each of the tested compounds<br>
wherein there is produced a vasodilatation of 50% of<br>
the arterial ring previously contracted with 1 mM of<br>
Norepinephrine.<br>
As can be observed, the two compounds tested<br>
have a potent vasodilating activity, at least similar<br>
to that of the reference, and the compound 1 has a<br>
vasodilating activity superior to.that of thecreference<br>
product.<br>
Example 9.- Assay of tolerance.<br>
The different compound:, tested are subcutane-<br>
ously administrated to rats at a dose of 10 mg/Kg for<br>
three days, each eight hours, and the assay is then<br>
done ex vivo to test the capacity to vasodilate the ar-<br>
terial segments of the rats after the subcutaneous ad-<br>
ministration of the compound.<br>
The method followed is substantially the same<br>
as described in following references:.<br>

The different compounds are tested at 5 dif-<br>
ferent concentrations, at a concentration, range from<br>
0.001 to 10 mM, using from 6 to 9 arterial rings for<br>
each compound. The obtained results are compared to<br>
those from the isosorbide 5-mononitrate, which is used<br>
as reference product, and with those obtained from the<br>
animals wherein there have not been administrated any<br>
compound.<br>
The results obtained, also shown as CE50, are<br>
shown in table 2<br>
It should be understood that a compound de-<br>
velops tolerance when the CE50 of the product in the<br>
vascular rings of the animals which have been submitted<br>
to administration of the compound, as specified above,<br>
is superior to the CE50 of the compound in the vascular<br>
rings of the animals which have not been submitted to<br>
administration of the compound.<br>
The CE50 of isosorbide 5-mononitrcite in the<br>
group of animals wherein said compound was adminis-<br>
trated was seven times superior as compared to that of<br>
the not treated animals.<br><br>
which indicate a strong developments of tolerance for<br>
the reference product. On the contrary, for the two<br>
compounds tested, 1 y 5, which form part of the object<br>
of the invention, the CE50 obtained for both of them are<br>
significantly less, which indicate a development of<br>
tolerance very inferior as compared to the reference<br>
product. Further, for the compound 5 the development of<br>
tolerance is practically null under these test condi-<br>
tions.<br>
