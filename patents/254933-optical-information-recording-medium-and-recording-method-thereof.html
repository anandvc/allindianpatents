				<td>To provide an optical information recording medium including a pigment appropriate for high-density and high-speed optical recording by the blue laser light of 350 to 500 nm and especially around 400 nm (for example, 405 run), enabling recording at low power, suppressing thermal affect of recording to the optical recording layer, and assuring a reflection ratio or modulation degree by the change of a refraction index n and an attenuation coefficient k; and to provide a recording method thereof.

Recording may be performed mainly by the change Ak of the attenuation coefficient k. It is preferable to use a recording wavelength which is at the side of longer wavelength than the absorption peak of the absorption spectrum for the laser beam of the aforementioned pigment.

				<td>Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a postscript (write once) type<br>
optical information recording medium and to the recording method<br>
thereof. In particular, this invention relates to an optical<br>
information recording medium which is capable of writing<br>
information by means of a semiconductor laser such as a laser<br>
beam having a wavelength of 350-500nm (blue laser, a blue laser<br>
beam) and to the recording method thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Nowadays, many efforts have been conducted trying to<br>
develop an optical information recording medium of postscript<br>
type which is designed to use a blue laser beam having a wavelength<br>
in the vicinity of 350-500nm (for example, around 405nm) which<br>
is shorter in wavelength than that conventionally employed. In<br>
this optical information recording medium, an organic dye<br>
compound is employed for creating an optical recording layer.<br>
As the organic dye compound absorbs laser beam, the organic dye<br>
compound is decomposed (e.g. thermal decomposition) or denatured,<br>
thereby bringing about a change in optical properties of the laser<br>
beam of recording or regenerating wavelength. This change is<br>
then picked up respectively as a modulation factor, thereby<br>
making it possible to perform the recording as well as the<br>
regeneration.<br><br>
In conformity with recent trend to increase the density and<br>
the velocity of recording, a laser beam of shorter wavelength<br>
zone is now increasingly employed in the recording. As the laser<br>
beam to be employed is getting shorter in wavelength, the optical<br>
recording layer is required to be formed increasingly thinner.<br>
Therefore, the development of the optical information recording<br>
medium is now being advanced especially attaching importance to<br>
the selection of dyes having a higher refractive index.<br>
Namely, it has been practiced to secure the modulation factor<br>
by taking advantage of the optical phase difference that can be<br>
generated due to a change in refractive index at the recording<br>
or regenerating wavelength.<br>
A general structure of an optical information recording<br>
medium 1 which is capable of recording and regenerating<br>
information by means of a blue laser beam will be explained with<br>
reference to FIG. 15.<br>
FIG. 15 illustrates an enlarged cross-sectional view of a<br>
main portion of a disc-like optical information recording medium<br>
1. More specifically, FIG. 15 is a cross-sectional view of the<br>
optical information recording medium 1 as it is sectioned<br>
diametrally. Namely, FIG. 15 schematically shows a<br>
cross-section of the optical information recording medium 1 as<br>
it is sectioned perpendicular to the surface provided with a<br>
pre-groove 7 and also perpendicular to the direction of the<br>
pre-groove 7. This optical information recording medium 1<br>
comprises a light-transmitting substrate 2, an optical recording<br>
layer 3 (light-absorptive layer) formed on the substrate 2, a<br>
light-reflecting layer 4 formed on the optical recording layer<br>
3, and a protective layer 5 (adhesive layer) formed on the<br>
light-reflecting layer 4 . By the way, under some circumstances ,<br><br>
a dummy layer 6 having a predetermined thickness may be laminated<br>
on the top of the protective layer 5 so as to make the optical<br>
information recording medium 1 have a predetermined thickness<br>
which is required by the specification.<br>
The substrate 2 is provided in advance with a pre-groove 7<br>
which is formed spirally. On both sides of this pre-groove 7,<br>
there are located lands 8 constituting the regions other than<br>
the pre-groove 7.<br>
As shown in FIG. 15, as a laser beam (recording beam) 9 is<br>
irradiated onto the optical information recording medium 1 from<br>
the light-transmitting substrate 2 (incident layer) side, the<br>
optical recording layer 3 is caused to generate heat (or absorb<br>
heat) as the energy of the laser beam 9 is absorbed by the optical<br>
recording layer 3, thereby forming a recording pit 10 through<br>
the thermal decomposition of the optical recording layer 3.<br>
By the way, the substrate 2 is contacted, through a first<br>
boundary layer (or interface) 11, with the optical recording<br>
layer 3.<br>
The optical recording layer 3 is contacted, through a second<br>
boundary layer 12, with the light-reflecting layer 4.<br>
The light-reflecting layer 4 is contacted, through a third<br>
boundary layer 13, with the protective layer 5.<br>
The protective layer 5 is contacted, through a fourth<br>
boundary layer 14, with the dummy substrate 6.<br>
The light-transmitting substrate 2 can be generally formed<br>
using a resin having a high transparency exhibiting a refractive<br>
index ranging from about 1.5 to 1.7 to a laser beam and being<br>
excellent in impact resistance. For example, the<br>
light-transmitting substrate 2 can be formed using a<br>
polycarbonate plate, an acrylic plate, an epoxy resin plate, etc.<br><br>
It is also possible to use a glass plate as the light-transmitting<br>
substrate 2.<br>
The optical recording layer 3 deposited on the substrate 2<br>
is formed of a layer made of a light-absorptive substance (a<br>
light-absorbing substance) containing a dyestuf f . This optical<br>
recording layer 3 is caused to generate heat as it is irradiated<br>
with a laser beam 9 , thereby bring about the thermal decomposition,<br>
the heat generation, the absorption of heat, melting, sublimation,<br>
deformation or denaturing. This optical recording layer 3 can<br>
be formed, for example, by uniformly coating an azo-based dye,<br>
a cyanine dye, etc., which has been dissolved in a solvent, on<br>
the surface of substrate 2 by means of spin-coating method, etc.<br>
With respect to the materials to be employed for forming the<br>
optical recording layer 3, although it is possible to employ any<br>
kind of optical recording materials, it is more preferable to<br>
employ a photoabsorptive organic dye.<br>
The light-reflecting layer 4 is formed of a metal film which<br>
is high in heat conductivity and light reflectance, and can be<br>
created by the deposition of gold, silver, copper, aluminum, or<br>
an alloy comprising any of these metals by means of vapor<br>
deposition method, sputtering method, etc.<br>
The protective layer 5 can be formed, as in the case of the<br>
substrate 2, by making use of a resin which is excellent in impact<br>
resistance and adhesion. For example, the protective layer 5<br>
can be formed by coating an ultraviolet-curing resin on the<br>
light-reflecting layer 4 by means of spin-coating method followed<br>
by the curing of the coated layer through the irradiation of<br>
ultraviolet rays thereto.<br>
The dummy layer 6 can be formed by making use of the same<br>
kinds of materials as those of the substrate 2, thereby securing<br><br>
a predetermined thickness (about 1.2mm) of the optical<br>
information recording medium.<br>
Further, FIG. 16 is an enlarged cross-sectional view<br>
illustrating, as in the case of FIG. 15, a main portion of a<br>
disc-like optical information recording medium 20 of another type<br>
using a blue laser beam. In this case, the optical information<br>
recording medium 20 comprises a light-transmitting substrate 2<br>
having a thickness of 1.1mm, a light-reflecting layer 4 formed<br>
on the substrate 2, an optical recording layer 3<br>
(light-absorptive layer) formed on the light-reflecting layer<br>
4, a protective layer 5 formed on the optical recording layer<br>
3, an adhesive layer 21 formed on the protective layer 5, and<br>
a cover layer 22 having a thickness of 0.1mm and formed on the<br>
adhesive layer 21.<br>
The substrate 2 is provided in advance with a pre-groove 7<br>
which is formed spirally. On both sides of this pre-groove 7,<br>
there are located lands 8 constituting the regions other than<br>
the pre-groove 7.<br>
By the way, if a boundary layer between the substrate 2 and<br>
the optical recording layer 3 satisfies a low reflectance and,<br>
furthermore, if the light reflected from the optical recording<br>
layer 3 is sufficient enough, the provision of light-reflecting<br>
layer 4 may not be required.<br>
As shown in FIG. 16, as a laser beam (recording beam) 9 is<br>
irradiated onto the optical information recording medium 20 from<br>
the light-transmitting incident layer (the cover layer 22) side,<br>
the optical recording layer 3 is caused to generate heat (or<br>
absorb heat) as the energy of the laser beam 9 is absorbed by<br>
the optical recording layer 3, thereby forming a recording pit<br>
10 through the thermal decomposition of the optical recording<br><br>
layer 3.<br>
By the way, the substrate 2 is contacted, through a first<br>
boundary layer 23, with the light-reflecting layer 4.<br>
The light-reflecting layer 4 is contacted, through a second<br>
boundary layer 24, with the optical recording layer 3.<br>
The optical recording layer 3 is contacted, through a third<br>
boundary layer 25, with the protective layer 5.<br>
The protective layer 5 is contacted, through a fourth<br>
boundary layer 26, with the adhesive layer 21.<br>
The adhesive layer 21 is contacted, through a fifth boundary<br>
layer 27, with the cover layer 22.<br>
In the optical information recording medium 1 or the optical<br>
information recording medium 20, which are constructed as<br>
described above, the laser beam 9 is irradiated onto the recording<br>
film of the optical recording layer 3 through the transparent<br>
substrate 2 or through the cover layer 22, and the energy of this<br>
beam is converted into a thermal energy, thereby bring about the<br>
generation of heat causing thermal decomposition, i.e. heating,<br>
melting, sublimation, or decomposition, thus creating a<br>
recording pit 10. By making use of this recording pit 10, the<br>
contrast that can be created due to the reflectance of light at<br>
the recorded portion or unrecorded portion is read out as an<br>
electric signal (modulation factor).<br>
As described above, in the optical information recording<br>
medium 1 or the optical information recording medium 20, the<br>
recording pit 10 is created mainly through the change in<br>
refractive index that can be caused due to the thermal<br>
decomposition of an organic dye compound as the laser beam 9 is<br>
irradiated onto the optical recording layer 3 formed of the<br>
organic color dye compound.<br><br>
As a result, the optical constant and decomposition behavior<br>
of the organic color dye compound to be employed in the optical<br>
recording layer 3 are now important factors in order to create<br>
excellent recording pit.<br>
Therefore, the organic color dye compound to be employed in<br>
the optical recording layer 3 is now required to be selected from<br>
those which are excellent in optical properties and in<br>
decomposition behavior to blue laser wavelength. Namely, with<br>
the view of securing excellent recording/regenerating properties<br>
even in the blue laser wavelength zone, there has been tried to<br>
enhance the reflectance of the optical recording layer 3 when<br>
it is not yet recorded and to cause a large change in refractive<br>
index as the organic dye compound is thermally decomposed by the<br>
irradiation of laser beam (thereby making it possible to secure<br>
a large modulation factor).<br>
The change of refractive index "n" and of the extinction<br>
coefficient "k" of the organic dye compound employed as the<br>
optical recording layer 3 due to the absorption of laser beam<br>
9 by the organic dye compound will be explained in reference to<br>
FIG. 17.<br>
FIG. 17 is a graph showing the relationship between the<br>
wavelength of the laser beam 9 and the refractive index "n" and<br>
the relationship between the wavelength of the laser beam 9 and<br>
the extinction coefficient "k". As the organic dye compound<br>
employed is thermally decomposed, the molecular bond is destroyed,<br>
resulting in the decrease of refractive index "n" after recording<br>
and hence resulting in the decrease of reflectance "R" .<br>
Therefore, there has been conventionally tried to increase the<br>
magnitude of change "Δn" in refractive index "n" to thereby secure<br>
a sufficient magnitude of the change "AR" in reflectance, thus<br><br>
securing a modulation factor between the recording pit 10 and<br>
other portions of the optical recording layer 3 and making it<br>
possible to perform regenerable recording.<br>
Further, the graph describing the extinction coefficient "k"<br>
is substantially the same as the graph describing the absorbency<br>
to the laser beam 9 of the dye, so that it is generally practiced<br>
to make the wavelength on the long wavelength side of this<br>
absorption peak (recording wavelength) the same as the wavelength<br>
of recording' beam (laser beam 9). Namely, since the graph of<br>
refractive index "n" indicates the absorption peak on the long<br>
wavelength side of the graph of the extinction coefficient "k",<br>
it is possible to secure a large magnitude of change "Δn" in<br>
refractive index "n" at this recording wavelength.<br>
On the other hand, it is well known that, as in the case of<br>
the refractive index "n", the extinction coefficient "k" is<br>
caused to decrease after recording at the same recording<br>
wavelength due to the destruction of molecular bond of the organic<br>
dye compound as a result of thermal decomposition of the organic<br>
dye compound. As the extinction coefficient "k" is decreased,<br>
the reflectance "R" is caused to increase. Namely, the change<br>
"Δk" of the extinction coefficient "k" acts to decrease the<br>
magnitude of change "AR" in the reflectance "R" due to the change<br>
"Δn" in refractive index "n" . Namely, the absolute value of "AR"<br>
can be derived as a magnitude corresponding to (An-Ak).<br>
Therefore, according to the prior art, the interest of<br>
development of optical information recording medium is focused<br>
to find a way to increase the "Δn" as much as possible in order<br>
to secure a desired level of modulation factor and to select a<br>
dye exhibiting as small magnitude of "Δk" as possible.<br>
Actually however, no one has succeeded as yet to obtain a<br><br>
suitable dye which is useful as a coloring material of the optical<br>
recording layer 3 with respect to the laser beam 9 having a<br>
recording wavelength within the range of 350-500nm (for example,<br>
around 405nm).<br>
As described above, the coloring material is required to<br>
exhibit a suitable extinction coefficient "k" (absorption<br>
coefficient) and a large refractive index "n" so as to secure<br>
a sufficient contrast before and after the recording. Therefore,<br>
the coloring material has been selected such that the<br>
recording/regenerating wavelength can be located at the skirts<br>
of the long wavelength side of absorption peak of absorption<br>
spectrum of dye, thus designing the optical recording layer 3<br>
so as to secure a large magnitude of change "Δn" in refractive<br>
index "n" .<br>
Further, as for the properties demanded of the organic<br>
compound, the behavior of decomposition thereof is required to<br>
be suitably selected in addition to the aforementioned optical<br>
properties to the blue laser beam wavelength. However, the<br>
materials having an optical property indicating a refractive<br>
index "n" which is comparable to that of the conventional CD-R<br>
or DVD-R in this short wavelength zone is extremely limited in<br>
kinds. Namely, in order to bring the absorption band of an<br>
organic compound close to the wavelength of blue laser beam, the<br>
molecular skeleton of the organic compound is required to be<br>
minimized or the conjugated system of the organic compound is<br>
required to be shortened. However, when the structure of the<br>
organic compound is adjusted in this manner, it will invite the<br>
decrease of the extinction coefficient "k" or the decrease of<br>
the refractive index "n".<br>
As for the method of overcoming these problems, there have<br><br>
been recently reported possibilities of improving the optical<br>
properties of organic compound through the utilization of<br>
interaction between molecules such as association instead of<br>
utilizing the optical properties of the simple substance of dye<br>
molecule. However, no one has succeeded as yet to realize<br>
satisfactory recording properties by making use of such a method.<br>
Meanwhile, if a high-speed recording is to be performed by<br>
making use of the optical information recording medium 1 or the<br>
optical information recording medium 20, it is required to<br>
perform a predetermined recording in a shorter period of time<br>
than that required in the conventional speed of recording or low<br>
speed recording. Therefore, the recording power is required to<br>
be increased, thus increasing a quantity of heat or a quantity<br>
of heat per unit time at the optical recording layer 3 on the<br>
occasion of the recording. As a result, the problem of thermal<br>
strain tends to become more prominent, thus giving rise to the<br>
generation of non-uniformity of recording pits 10. Further,<br>
since there is a limit in increasing the output power of<br>
semiconductor laser for emitting the laser beam 9, it is now<br>
demanded to develop a dyestuff having such a high sensitivity<br>
that can be coped with a high-speed recording.<br>
As described above, since an organic dye compound is employed<br>
in the optical recording layer 3 in the cases of the optical<br>
information recording mediums 1 and 20, the development of<br>
optical information recording medium is mainly directed to a<br>
dyestuff which is capable of exhibiting high refractive index<br>
to the laser beam 9 of short wavelength side.<br>
Namely, as long as the conventional postscript type optical<br>
information recording medium using an organic dye compound is<br>
concerned, only the organic compounds which are capable of<br><br>
exhibiting a large refractive index and a relatively small<br>
extinction coefficient (0.05-0.07) to a recording/regenerating<br>
wavelength are enabled to be employed in viewpoints of securing<br>
modulation factor and reflectance.<br>
Since there are known at present a large number of organic<br>
dye compounds having an absorption band which is close to the<br>
blue laser wavelength, the extinction coefficient "k" thereof<br>
can be controlled. However, since these organic dye compounds<br>
fail to have a large refractive index "n" , the dye compound layer<br>
is required to have a certain degree of film thickness in order<br>
to obtain modulation factor securing a sufficient optical phase<br>
difference of the recording portion (recording pit 10).<br>
However, since the organic compound is incapable of<br>
exhibiting a large absorption power to the recording beam, it<br>
is impossible to make thinner the film thickness of the organic<br>
compound film. Therefore, it is required to employ a substrate<br>
2 having a deep trench (since the film of organic compound is<br>
formed by means of spin-coating, the increase of film thickness<br>
of the organic compound film is achieved by depositing the organic<br>
compound in a deep trench) . In this case however, it is very<br>
difficult to fabricate a substrate 2 having a deep trench, giving<br>
rise to the deterioration in quality of the optical information<br>
recording medium.<br>
Additionally, since the recording medium where blue laser<br>
beam is employed is demanded to execute a high-density recording,<br>
the physical track pitch is required to be formed narrow. As<br>
a result, when a laser beam of high output such as blue laser<br>
beam is employed, the heat generated on the occasion of the<br><br>
decomposition of dye compound is liable to be accumulated, thus<br>
enabling the heat generated on the occasion of the decomposition<br>
of dye compound to easily transmit to the neighboring tracks and<br>
hence raising the problem that the properties of the recording<br>
medium will be deteriorated.<br>
As described above, the recording medium using a blue laser<br>
wavelength zone where the refractive index of dyestuff (organic<br>
dye compound) cannot be easily enhanced is accompanied with the<br>
problem that it is difficult to enable the recording medium to<br>
exhibit excellent recording properties in the conventional<br>
recording to be effected through the phase change of the change<br>
of refractive index "n".<br>

phase difference to be brought about by the change "Δk" of the<br>
extinction coefficient "k" of dyestuff and not based on an optical<br>
phase difference to be brought about by the change "Δn" in<br>
refractive index "n" of dyestuff as conventionally conducted.<br>
Thus, the present invention is based on the finding of possibility<br>
of obtaining a dyestuff which is useful in carrying out the<br>
aforementioned recording, wherein the recording is performed<br>
mainly based on the change "Δk" of the extinction coefficient<br>
"k" of dyestuff.<br>
Namely, it is designed to form a recording pit on the<br>
unrecorded optical recording layer formed of an organic dye<br>
compound by making use of the color change of the organic dye<br>
composition of optical recording layer as a result of recording.<br>
More specifically, there is employed a dyestuff whose main<br>
absorption band (absorption peak) before recording is located<br>
on the short wavelength side relative to the<br>
recording/regenerating wavelength and which can be colored or<br>
discolored (absorption) at the recording/regenerating<br>
wavelength zone after the irradiation of laser beam. More<br>
preferably, there is employed a dyestuff whose color can be<br>
thickened as it is irradiated with laser beam as compared with<br>
the color thereof before the irradiation of the laser beam.<br><br>
FIG. 1 is a graph showing a recording system of the present<br>
invention and illustrating a relationship between the wavelength<br>
of the laser beam 9 and the refractive index "n" and the<br>
relationship between the wavelength of the laser beam 9 and the<br>
extinction coefficient "k", wherein a dyestuff useful in the<br>
present invention is employed. As seen from this graph, while<br>
the refractive index "n" was caused to decrease, the extinction<br>
coefficient "k" was caused to increase as a result of recording<br>
at the recording wavelength. According to this novel recording<br>
system, it has been taken notice of the facts that the magnitude<br>
of decrease "Δn" of refractive index "n" becomes smaller and the<br>
magnitude of change (increment) "Δk" of the extinction<br>
coefficient ™k" becomes larger. At the same time, it has been<br>
found possible to obtain such a dyestuff which is useful in this<br>
recording system. It has been also found possible to suppress<br>
to a possible extent the influence of the generation of heat that<br>
has been a problem involved in the conventional recording system<br>
where a change of refractive index due to thermal decomposition<br>
are utilized.<br>
As a result of extensive studies made by the present<br>
inventors, it has been succeeded to find out an optical recording<br>
layer exhibiting excellent recording/regenerating properties<br>
that can be manifested through the coloring (increase in<br>
concentration) or discoloration of the optical recording layer<br>
while enabling to retain mainly the composition of an organic<br>
dye compound and by making use of recording/regenerating beam<br>
of high output and of short wavelength such as blue laser beam.<br><br>
This indicates that it is possible to secure a sufficient optical<br>
phase difference through a quantity of change "Δk" of the<br>
extinction coefficient "k" of dyestuff that can be brought about<br>
by the recording and also possible to minimize the influence of<br>
heat generation through the suppression, as much as possible,<br>
of the change "Δn" in refractive index that may be caused to occur<br>
due to the thermal decomposition of the organic dye compound.<br>
Namely, it is now possible to decrease the reflectance "R"<br>
by increasing the extinction coefficient "k", thus making it<br>
possible to derive a sufficient degree of change "AR" in<br>
reflectance which is required for securing the modulation factor.<br>
Moreover, due to the decrease of refractive index "n", the<br>
reflectance "R" can be also decreased, thus making it possible<br>
to further increase the change "AR" in combination with the change<br>
"Δk" of the extinction coefficient "k". Namely, it is now<br>
possible to obtain the absolute value of "AR" as a quantity<br>
corresponding to a value of (Ak+An).<br>
Therefore, it is now possible to perform the recording<br>
through the change of the extinction coefficient "k" and not<br>
through the employment of a dyestuff exhibiting a high refractive<br>
index as conventionally conducted. Moreover, if the decrease<br>
of the change "Δn" is confined to a predetermined level which<br>
is smaller than the conventional level, the generation of heat<br>
due to the thermal decomposition of the organic dye composition<br>
can be suppressed correspondingly. Therefore, it is now<br>
possible to secure the change "AR" of reflectance "R" to be caused<br>
by the change "Δn" in addition to the change "Δk", thus making<br><br>
it possible to realize efficient recording through synergistic<br>
effects to be derived from the refractive index "n" and the<br>
extinction coefficient "k". Namely, the recording power may be<br>
of a lower level as compared with the conventional level and the<br>
recording with lower power is effective in enhancing the<br>
reliability of the recording of high density and high speed<br>
especially.<br>

Effects of the Invention:<br>
According to the optical information recording medium and<br>
the recording method thereof, it is possible to perform optical<br>
recording not through a large magnitude of change of dyestuff<br>
as conventionally conducted but through the change of extinction<br>
coefficient "k" of the dyestuff as represented by the dye<br>
compounds having chemical structures as shown in FIGs. 2 and 6<br>
or as shown in FIGs. 3-5 and FIGs. 7 and 8 for instance. Further,<br>
for this reason, it is now possible to perform excellent optical<br>
recording by making use of blue laser and to perform the optical<br>
recording with low power since the dyestuff is not required to<br>
be heated to the decomposition temperature of the dyestuff. As<br>
a result, it is now possible to perform the optical recording<br>
at high sensitivity and high density, while securing the<br>
reliability and stability of the recording. In the conventional<br>
recording system where a thermal decomposition reaction of<br>
dyestuff is utilized, a large quantity of heat is generated at<br>
the time of the decomposition. Whereas in the case of the<br>
recording system as proposed by the present invention, wherein<br>
the structural change of dyestuff such as the tautomerization<br>
of dyestuff is utilized or the orientation of a polarized<br>
structure unbalanced in electric charge that can be effected<br>
through an electrostatic interaction is utilized, the generation<br><br>
of heat is suppressed, thus making it possible to minimize the<br>
transmission of heat to neighboring tracks (the problem that has<br>
been raised on the occasion of forming a recording pit) and to<br>
obtain an optical information recording medium having excellent<br>
recording properties.<br>
Namely, in the case of the present invention, as the light<br>
and heat are applied to the optical recording layer on the<br>
occasion of recording through the irradiation of laser beam, the<br>
orientation of the dyestuff (organic dye compound) is caused to<br>
change in the optical recording layer, thereby increasing the<br>
absorption of laser beam by the dyestuff (due to the increase<br>
of the extinction coefficient "k") in the recording region at<br>
the recording/regenerating wavelength. As a result, the<br>
reflectance "R" is caused to decrease, thus securing the<br>
modulation.<br>
Furthermore, since the recording is performed through the<br>
change of absorption to be caused by the orientation of dyestuff<br>
without generating the decomposition such as the thermal<br>
decomposition of the dyestuff, the generation of heat on the<br>
occasion of recording can be minimized. Namely, in the case of<br>
the prior art, the magnitude of change of the refractive index<br>
"n" through the decomposition of dyestuff has been a key.<br>
Whereas, in the case of the present invention, a key is not how<br>
to thermally decompose the dyestuff but how to change the<br>
absorbance of the dyestuff through the decomposition thereof or<br>
how to enlarge the change of reflectance "R" of dyestuff.<br>
Therefore the dyestuff, according to the present invention, is<br><br>
not necessarily required to be decomposed and the recording of<br>
information can be performed with low power.<br>
Specifically, the dyestuff is irradiated with laser beam to<br>
isomerize the dyestuff or to generate an electrostatic<br>
interaction or the association among the dye molecules, thereby<br>
lowering the refractive index "n" and increasing the extinction<br>
coefficient "k". Preferably, an organic dye material exhibiting<br>
associating properties is employed in order to obtain excellent<br>
recording properties. By the way, when an organic dye material<br>
having a plurality of associating structures in the molecule<br>
thereof is employed, it is possible to expect further improved<br>
properties therefrom. Especially, since it is possible to<br>
sufficiently secure the dyestuff that has been isomerized, it<br>
is possible to obtain a dyestuff which is improved in desirable<br>
recording properties . Especially, a material having a plurality<br>
of isomerized structures in the molecule thereof (for example,<br>
materials shown in FIGs. 6 and 8) is expected to exhibit greatly<br>
improved properties.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, since the<br>
organic compound layer (optical recording layer) is not<br>
restricted with regard to the refractive index "n" thereof, the<br>
organic compound layer is no longer required to have the light<br>
absorbing properties at all, so that it is no longer required<br>
such a severe restriction as conventionally required with regard<br>
to the optical constant.<br>
Especially, according to the first, the second, the fourth<br>
and the fifth aspects of the invention, not only the decrease<br><br>
of the reflectance "R" due to the increase of the extinction<br>
coefficient "k" but also the decrease of the reflectance "R" due<br>
to the decrease of the refractive index "n" can be synergistically<br>
secured as a modulation factor, thereby making it possible to<br>
realize a more efficient recording as compared with the<br>
conventional recording.<br>
Especially, according to the third aspect of the invention,<br>
since the organic dyestuff is enabled to form a polarized<br>
structure which is unbalanced in electric charge as it is<br>
irradiated with the laser beam, and this polarized structure is<br>
designed to be orientated by an electrostatic interaction to<br>
thereby make it possible to perform the recording, it is now<br>
possible to minimize, without generating a large magnitude of<br>
heat due to the recording that has been experienced in the<br>
conventional recording system, the transmission of heat to the<br>
neighboring track which has been a problem to be solved on the<br>
occasion of forming a recording pit, thereby making it possible<br>
to realize an efficient recording.<br>
Especially, according to the sixth aspect of the invention,<br>
it is now possible to form an optical recording layer by making<br>
use of a dye compound having a relatively simple structure,<br>
enabling to perform more efficient recording as compared with<br>
the conventional recording.<br>
Especially, according to the seventh aspect of the invention,<br>
since a dye compound having a plurality of tautomeric structures<br>
in the molecule thereof, it is now possible to further improve<br>
the optical properties and to perform stable recording.<br><br>
Especially, according to the fourth and the eighth aspects<br>
of the invention, not only the decrease of the reflectance "R"<br>
due to the increase of the extinction coefficient "k" but also<br>
the decrease of the reflectance "R" due to the decrease of the<br>
refractive index "n" can be secured as a modulation factor, it<br>
is now possible to perform the recording with a lower power as<br>
compared with that employed in the conventional recording.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, since not only the<br>
decrease of the reflectance "R" due to the increase of the<br>
extinction coefficient "k" but also the decrease of the<br>
reflectance "R" due to the decrease of the refractive index "n"<br>
can be secured as a modulation factor, it is now possible to<br>
perform the recording with a laser beam having a wavelength<br>
ranging from 350nm to 500nm. Further, since the recording layer<br>
contains an organic dye compound having a reversible optical<br>
property, i.e. since a dye compound having a structure<br>
represented by that shown in FIG. 2 or FIG. 6, it is now possible<br>
to obtain an optical information recording medium which is<br>
capable of performing more efficient recording as compared with<br>
the conventional optical information recording medium and to<br>
realize the recording method thereof in the recording especially<br>
by making use of blue laser beam.<br>

Among them, if the organic dyestuff has a substituent group<br>
consisting of amide group, preferably alkylamide, it may become<br>
more reactable by the light and heat to be provided by the laser<br>
beam, so that an isomer is more liable to be formed and that the<br>

Among them, if the organic dyestuff has a substituent group<br>
consisting of amide group, preferably alkylamide, it may become<br>
more reactable by the light and heat to be provided by the laser<br>
beam, so that an isomer is more liable to be formed and that the<br>
organic dyestuff can be more easily orientated by the change in<br>
association thereof through an electrostatic action.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a general formula of another example of the<br>
compound having a plurality of tautomeric structures or a<br>
plurality of associating structures in its dye molecule.<br>
FIG. 18 is a diagram illustrating a process wherein the<br>
optical recording layer 3 containing an amine compound changes<br>
from its basic structure to a polarized structure (quinoid<br>
structure) and then to an orientated structure. The optical<br><br>
recording layer 3 containing an amine compound having the<br>
aforementioned associating properties is designed to generate,<br>
. as it is irradiated with laser beam, an unbalanced electric charge<br>
(polarization) in the dye molecule as the amine compound is<br>
reacted with light and heat, thereby creating an isomer as shown<br>
in FIG. 18.<br>
Due to this unbalanced electric charge, a reversible change<br>
in structure, of dyestuff is taken place at a portion of the<br>
recording layer which has been irradiated with the laser beam<br>
in distinction from a portion of the recording layer which has<br>
not been irradiated with the laser beam, thus providing a<br>
tautomeric change to the recording layer, thereby making it<br>
possible to perform the recording.<br>
Further, if there is existed an amine compound having<br>
associating properties, an electrostatic interaction is<br>
permitted to take place due to this unbalanced electric charge.<br>
As a result, due to the association to be effected by this<br>
electrostatic interaction, a change in orientation is caused to<br>
occur in the recording layer, thereby making it possible to<br>
perform the recording.<br>
Furthermore, if there is existed an amine compound having<br>
associating properties, the molecule of the dyestuf f is optically<br>
excited by the irradiation of laser beam and hence this irradiated<br>
portion is caused to change into a quinoid structure, thereby<br>
making it possible to perform the recording.<br>
These states mentioned above can be confirmed, for example,<br>
by observing the absorption spectrums obtained before and after<br><br>
the recording. For example, when the absorption peak of<br>
absorption spectrum after the recording is found shifted to the<br>
long wavelength side as compared with the absorption spectrum<br>
of optical recording layer before the recording, it can be said<br>
that the isomerization or the change in orientation has taken<br>
place.<br>
Further, whether or not the molecular composition (the kind<br>
and the number of atoms constituting the molecule) of an organic<br>
dye compound is retained without generating the decomposition<br>
of the organic dye compound can be confirmed by the analysis of<br>
the peak of each component by means of GC-MS system or a<br>
high-performance liquid chromatography for instance. For<br>
example, if the peaks obtained before and after the irradiation<br>
of laser beam are the same with each other, it can be that the<br>
molecular composition of an organic dye compound is retained<br>
without being decomposed.<br>
Although representative methods to confirm the<br>
compositional state of an organic dye compound have been<br>
discussed above, it is also possible to employ other confirmation<br>
methods.<br>
Since the aforementioned amine compound having associating<br>
properties is liable to easily react with water or oxygen because<br>
of its nature, i.e. the associating properties thereof, the<br>
quinoid structure to be derived therefrom is very unstable so<br>
that it is required to take some measures to retain as much as<br>
possible the state of quinoid structure thus converted.<br>
Therefore, in order to definitely retain the quinoid<br><br>
structure or stabilize the recorded portion, it may be advisable<br>
to incorporate various kinds of additives.<br>
For example, a dehydration type additive such as carbodiimide<br>
may be suitably employed as such an additive. Further, a quencher<br>
may be mixed as a light stabilizer into the dye composition.<br>
Further, in order to prevent the optical recording layer 3<br>
from being deteriorated by water or oxygen, an auxiliary layer<br>
should preferably be deposited on one of the surfaces of the<br>
optical recording layer, which is opposite to the surface where<br>
the light-reflecting layer is to be formed, thereby preventing<br>
the penetration of water and oxygen into the optical recording<br>
layer.<br>
More specifically, an oxidation inhibitor should preferably<br>
be incorporated into the optical recording layer 3, specific<br>
examples of the oxidation inhibitor comprising at least one kind<br>
of compound selected from the group consisting of a hindered amine<br>
(HALS)-based compound, a phenolic compound, an amine-based<br>
compound, a phosphate-based compound and an organosulfur-based<br>
compound.<br>
Alternatively, an oxidation inhibiting film comprising any<br>
of these compounds may be disposed on one side of and close to<br>
the optical recording layer 3.<br>
Further, the optical recording layer'3 may further comprise<br>
a rust preventive formed of a benzotriazole-based compound or<br>
a benzothiazole-based compound.<br>
Examples<br><br>
Next, the examples of the present invention will be explained<br>
together with comparative examples.<br>
(Examples)<br>
The amine compound shown in FIG. 4 was dissolved in TFP<br>
(tetrafluoropropanol: 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propanol) to<br>
prepare a coating solution having a concentration of 18g/L.<br>
The organic dye compound having associating properties to<br>
be employed in the present invention is generally poor in<br>
solubility. It was found however that, when TFP<br>
(tetrafluoropropanol: 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propanol) was<br>
employed as a solvent, it was possible to obtain an optical<br>
recording layer 3 which could be easily transformed into a quinoid<br>
structure through a change in association. By means of<br>
spin-coating method, this coating solution was then coated on<br>
the surface of a disc-like polycarbonate substrate 2 (120mm in<br>
outer diameter, and 0.6mm in thickness) having a continuous<br>
guiding groove (pre-groove 7) having a depth of 7 5nm and a half<br>
width of 220nm. Then, the resultant layer was dried for 30<br>
minutes at a temperature of 80° C to obtain the optical recording<br>
layer 3 having an average dye film thickness of 70nm.<br>
The guiding groove (pre-groove 7) was formed at a track pitch<br>
of about 4 00nm. In order to suppress the expansion of the<br>
recording pit 10, this guiding groove should preferably be formed<br>
such that the width thereof is as wide as possible and the depth<br>
thereof is as shallow as possible. Specifically, the width of<br><br>
the guiding groove should preferably be confined within the range<br>
of 220-270nm and the depth of the guiding groove should preferably<br>
be confined within the range of 55-80nm. Further, the average<br>
film thickness of an optical recording layer 3 should preferably<br>
be confined within the range of 40-80nm and the leveling value<br>
of the optical recording layer 3 should preferably be confined<br>
within the range of 0.35-0.45.<br>
Then, silver (Ag) was sputtered onto the surface of this<br>
optical recording layer 3 to form a light-reflecting layer 4<br>
having a thickness of 120nm.<br>
Furthermore, an ultraviolet curing resin (SD-318; Dainippon<br>
Ink Chemical Industries) was spin-coated on the surface of the<br>
light reflection layer 4 and irradiated with ultraviolet rays<br>
to cure the resin to form a protective layer 5.<br>
An ultraviolet-curing resin adhesive was coated on the<br>
surface of this protective layer 5 and then a dummy substrate<br>
6 formed of the same material and the same configuration (0.6mm<br>
in thickness and 120mm in outer diameter) as those of the<br>
substrate 2 was adhered on the surface of this protective layer<br>
5. Subsequently, the adhesive was irradiated with ultraviolet<br>
rays to cure the adhesive, thus manufacturing a postscript type<br>
optical information recording medium 1.<br>
Further, an optical information recording medium 1 was<br>
fabricated as a comparative example in the same manner as the<br>
aforementioned example except that the oxacyanine dye shown in<br>
FIG. 9 was employed.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a table illustrating the results of assessment<br>
of recording properties of each of the aforementioned example<br>
and comparative example.	<br><br>
As apparent from FIG. 10, according to the example, it was<br>
possible to perform the recording with a recording power of about<br>
a half of that required in the comparative example. With respect<br>
to the reflectance and the modulation factor, values of almost<br>
the same level were obtained in both of these examples.<br>
It will be recognized that SbER (Simulated bit Error Rate)<br>
which corresponds to jitter (jitter of signal) and PRSNR (Partial<br>
Response Signal to Noise Ratio) which corresponds to noise to<br>
regenerating signals were both deteriorated in the comparative<br>
example as compared with those of the example.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a table illustrating the optical constants<br>
before and after the recording of a recording pit 10, i.e. a<br>
magnitude of the change "Δk" in refractive index "n" as well as<br>
in extinction coefficient "k" in the optical recording layer 3<br>
of the disc employed in the example. It will be seen from the<br>
results shown in FIG. 1 that, as a result of the recording, the<br>
refractive index "n" was decreased and the extinction coefficient<br>
"k" was increased. This indicates that the portion of recording<br>
pit was thickened in color as compared with the unrecorded<br>
portion.<br>
FIG. 12 is a graph illustrating the influence of the "Δn"<br>
and the "Δk" on the modulation factor (reflectance) in each of<br>
the discs which were fabricated in the same manner as the<br>
aforementioned example, wherein the film thickness of the optical<br>
information recording medium 1 created by making use of the<br>
dyestuff shown in FIG. 4 was variously changed. As shown in FIG.<br>
12, as far as the contribution to the modulation factor is<br>
concerned, the "Δk" is greater than the "Δn" in contrast to that<br>
can be obtained from the conventional organic dyestuff.<br>
It will be assumed from these results that about 80% of the<br><br>
modulation factor was derived from the effects of the "Δk".<br>
Because of this reason, the recording can be suitably<br>
performed by the increase in magnitude of change "Δk" of<br>
extinction coefficient that can be derived from the recording<br>
rather than the increase in magnitude of change "Δn" of refractive<br>
index.<br>
When calculated from the ratio of contribution to be obtained<br>
from FIG. 12, if it is desired to achieve a modulation factor<br>
of up to 0.45 for instance, the "Δn" is required to be 0.052 (an<br>
increase of 94%), whereas the "Δk" is required to be 0.009 (an<br>
increase of 22%). More specifically, Δn=0.335 or Δk=0.055 is<br>
required.<br>
FIG. 13 is a graph illustrating the change of reflectance<br>
relative to the refractive index "n". When it is desired to<br>
obtain a sufficient modulation factor (for example, a standard<br>
value of 0.35) by making use of only the refractive index "n",<br>
it is required to realize a change of about 1.55-1.9 as the range<br>
of change in refractive index as shown by the dot-and-dash line<br>
shown in FIG. 13. As a matter of fact however, as shown in the<br>
graph of FIG. 11, a change of only 0.055 was permitted as the<br>
"Δn" and hence the value of this change is confined to a very<br>
narrow region (as indicated in FIG. 13 by a two dots-and-dash<br>
line) as shown in FIG. 13, thus making it impossible to obtain<br>
a sufficient change in reflectance.<br>
FIG. 14 is a graph illustrating the change of reflectance<br>
relative to the extinction coefficient "k" . When it is desired<br>
to obtain a sufficient modulation factor (for example, 0.35) by<br>
making use of only the extinction coefficient "k", it is required<br>
to realize a change of about 0.15-0.22 as the range of change<br>
in extinction coefficient "k" as shown by the dot-and-dash line<br><br>
shown in FIG. 14. As a matter of fact however, as shown in the<br>
graph of FIG. 11, a change of 0.05 was permitted as the "Δk" and<br>
hence this change indicates a value of a very wide region (as<br>
indicated in FIG. 13 by a two dots-and-dash line) as shown in<br>
FIG. 13 in contrast to the case of refractive index "n", thus<br>
making it possible to obtain a sufficient change in reflectance<br>
by making use of only the "Δk".<br>
In FIG. 14, the range of value required (as the range of<br>
Ak) for the recording by making use of only the "Δk" (shown by<br>
the dot-and-dash line shown in FIG. 14) is shifted to a smaller<br>
value than the actual range of change (shown by the two<br>
dots-and-dash line in FIG. 14). The reason for this is that,<br>
as a tendency of the change of reflectance relative to the "Δk",<br>
the rising gradient of reflectance tends to become higher as the<br>
"Δk" becomes smaller, so that the range of value required for<br>
the recording by making use of only the "Δk" is shown therein<br>
as a preferable range. In practical use, the range of "Δk" may<br>
be set to any optional zone.<br>
FIG. 19 shows a table illustrating the refractive index "n",<br>
the extinction coefficient "k" and the modulation factor, before<br>
and after the recording, of various kinds of optical information<br>
recording mediums which were prepared in the same manner as the<br>
aforementioned example by making use of each of the organic dye<br>
compounds represented by the general formula shown in FIG. 2.<br>
In FIG. 19, the existence or absence of ferrocene group as<br>
indicated in the organic dye compound shown in FIG. 5 is indicated<br>
in each of the organic dye compounds.<br>
FIG. 20 is a graph illustrating the ranges of the extinction<br>
coefficient "k" and of the change "Δk" of the extinction<br>
coefficient "k" which were required for satisfying the modulation<br><br>
factor of not less than 35% as stipulated by the standard, these<br>
results being obtained using various kinds of optical information<br>
recording mediums which were prepared in the same manner as the<br>
aforementioned example by making use of each of the organic dye<br>
compounds represented by the general formula shown in FIG. 2.<br>
With respect to the change of refractive index "n" and the<br>
change of extinction coefficient "k" before and after the<br>
recording according to the present invention, it will be<br>
recognized that the refractive index "n" falling within the range<br>
of 1.7 to 1.9 before the recording was caused to change by only<br>
a magnitude of at most 0.1 or less than 0.1 after the recording<br>
as shown in FIG. 19. Whereas, the extinction coefficient "k"<br>
which was 0.22 before the recording was caused to change by a<br>
magnitude of not less than 0.74 after the recording as shown in<br>
FIG. 20.<br>
With regard to the range of extinction coefficient "k" (0.22<br>
or less) which is indicated by an arrow in FIG. 20 and the range<br>
of change "Δk" (0.074 or more), they were derived, as described<br>
above, as the conditions for securing not less than 35% as a<br>
standard value of modulation factor in the optical information<br>
recording medium of the present invention.<br>
By the way, it is preferable to take the error of measurement<br>
into consideration in evaluating the aforementioned results.<br>
Namely, it is preferable to take into account a measuring error<br>
of ±5%-±10% with respect to the values obtained in the measurement.<br>
In that case, the refractive index "n" falling within the range<br>
of 1.5 to 2.0 before the recording may be caused to change by<br>
10% or less (the result obtained is re-calculated according to<br>
the ratio) after the recording, and the extinction coefficient<br>
"k" which has been 0.25 or less before the recording may be caused<br><br>
to change by 30% or more (the result obtained is re-calculated<br>
according to the ratio) after the recording.<br>
By the way, the present invention has been accomplished<br>
expecting the change of reflectance that can be derived from the<br>
change of the extinction coefficient "k" and also expecting a<br>
synergistic effect of the change of reflectance that can be<br>
derived from the change of the extinction coefficient "k" and<br>
also from the' change of the refractive index "n" as the dye<br>
compounds represented by the chemical structures shown in FIGs.<br>
2 and 6 or by the chemical structures shown in FIGs. 3 to 5 and<br>
FIGs. 7 and 8 are employed as a dyestuf f of the optical recording<br>
layer. Further, the present invention has been accomplished<br>
expecting the change of reflectance that can be brought about<br>
by the change of the extinction coefficient "k", preferably, by<br>
an increase of the extinction coefficient "k". Further, when<br>
a dyestuf f which is also capable of greatly changing (decreasing)<br>
the refractive index "n" is employed, it is possible to obtain<br>
further preferable optical properties. In this case however,<br>
it is more preferable if these changes can be caused to generate<br>
without inviting the decomposition of the dyestuff.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
OPTICAL INFORMATION RECORDING MEDIUM<br>
AND RECORDING METHOD THEREOF<br>
To provide an optical information recording medium including a pigment<br>
appropriate for high-density and high-speed optical recording by the blue laser light of<br>
350 to 500 nm and especially around 400 nm (for example, 405 run), enabling recording<br>
at low power, suppressing thermal affect of recording to the optical recording layer, and<br>
assuring a reflection ratio or modulation degree by the change of a refraction index n and<br>
an attenuation coefficient k; and to provide a recording method thereof.<br>
Instead of the recording based on the optical phase difference obtained by a<br>
change A n of the refraction index n of the pigment as in the conventional method, a<br>
pigment capable of performing recording based on the change ?k of the attenuation<br>
coefficient k has been obtained. Recording may be performed mainly by the change Ak of<br>
the attenuation coefficient k. It is preferable to use a recording wavelength which is at the<br>
side of longer wavelength than the absorption peak of the absorption spectrum for the<br>
laser beam of the aforementioned pigment. However, the invention is not to be limited to<br>
this and characterized in recording performed by the change of the attenuation coefficient<br>
of the pigment against the recording wavelength.	 <br></td>
