				<td>DOUBLE ENDED INVERTER SYSTEM WITH AN IMPEDANCE<br>
SOURCE INVERTER SUBSYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]       This application claims the benefit of United States provisional<br>
patent application serial number 60/952,764, filed July 30, 2007 (the entire<br>
content of which is incorporated by reference herein).<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]       The subject matter described herein relates generally to an electric<br>
traction system. More particularly, the subject matter relates to a double<br>
ended inverter system, for use in a hybrid or electric vehicle, that includes an<br>
impedance source inverter.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]       In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the power usage and complexity of the various<br>
electrical systems within automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles,<br>
such as hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles.<br>
[0004]       Many of the electrical components, including the electric motors<br>
used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, receive electrical power from<br>
alternating current (AC) power supplies. However, the power sources (e.g.,<br>
batteries) used in such applications provide only direct current (DC) power.<br>
Thus, devices known as power inverters are used to convert the DC power to<br>
AC power. In addition, double ended inverter topologies can be used to drive<br>
a single AC motor with two DC power sources.<br><br>
[0005]       High voltage batteries or battery packs are typically used to provide<br>
electric power storage for the electric traction systems in most electric and<br>
hybrid electric vehicles. Such a high voltage battery may have a nominal<br>
voltage of 100 volts or more. Moreover, batteries are utilized to power other<br>
onboard subsystems, such as lighting subsystems, instrumentation subsystems,<br>
entertainment subsystems, and the like. For example, many electric and<br>
hybrid electric vehicles employ traditional subsystems that are powered by a<br>
12 volt battery. Moreover, a vehicle may employ another low voltage system<br>
of approximately 42 volts to power intermediate power electrical loads such as<br>
an electric power steering subsystem.<br>
[0006]       For vehicles that utilize more than one voltage level, a device that<br>
can transfer energy from one voltage source to another is necessary to<br>
maintain desirable charge levels at each source. DC-to-DC converters are<br>
commonly used to maintain the charge levels of multiple sources in a hybrid<br>
or electric vehicle. A double ended inverter system is able to control state of<br>
charge levels between two voltage sources while simultaneously controlling<br>
the power delivered to an AC electric motor. However, traditional double<br>
ended inverter topologies ideally operate when the two energy sources have<br>
similar voltage levels. Therefore, a traditional double ended inverter topology<br>
may not operate in an efficient or optimized manner in a hybrid or electric<br>
vehicle system having significantly different voltage sources (e.g., 12 volts<br>
and 100+volts).<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0007]       A double ended inverter system for an AC electric traction motor<br>
of a vehicle is provided. The double ended inverter system includes a first<br>
energy source having a first nominal DC voltage, and a second energy source<br>
having a second nominal DC voltage that differs from the first nominal DC<br>
voltage. The double ended inverter system also includes an impedance source<br>
inverter subsystem coupled to the first energy source, and an inverter<br><br>
subsystem coupled to the second energy source. These inverter systems are<br>
configured to individually or collectively drive the AC electric traction motor.<br>
[0008]       An alternate embodiment of a double ended inverter system for an<br>
AC electric traction motor of a vehicle is also provided. The vehicle has a first<br>
energy source and a second energy source, and the double ended inverter<br>
system includes an impedance source inverter subsystem configured to drive<br>
the AC electric traction motor using the first energy source, an inverter<br>
subsystem configured to drive the AC electric traction motor using the second<br>
energy source, and a controller coupled to the impedance source inverter<br>
subsystem and to the inverter subsystem. The controller is configured to<br>
control the impedance source inverter subsystem and the inverter subsystem in<br>
accordance with a boost operating mode, a traditional inverter operating mode,<br>
and a recharge operating mode of the double ended inverter system.<br>
[0009]       An electric traction system for a vehicle having a high voltage<br>
battery and a low voltage battery is also provided. The electric traction system<br>
includes an AC electric motor and a double ended inverter system coupled to<br>
the AC electric motor. The double ended inverter system is configured to<br>
drive the AC electric motor using energy obtained from the high voltage<br>
battery and energy obtained from the low voltage battery. The double ended<br>
inverter system includes a first inverter section coupled to the AC electric<br>
motor, a crossed LC X-link coupled between the first inverter section and the<br>
low voltage battery, and a second inverter section coupled between the high<br>
voltage battery and the AC electric motor.<br>
[0010]       This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a<br>
simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description.<br>
This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of<br>
the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in<br>
determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0011]       A more complete understanding of the subject matter may be<br>
derived by referring to the detailed description and claims when considered in<br>
conjunction with the following figures, wherein like reference numbers refer<br>
to similar elements throughout the figures.<br>

or hybrid electric vehicle.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014]       The following detailed description is merely illustrative in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the embodiments of the subject matter or the<br>
application and uses of such embodiments. As used herein, the word<br>
"exemplary" means "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any<br>
implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be<br>
construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.<br>
Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied<br>
theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary<br>
or the following detailed description.<br>
[0015]       Techniques and technologies may be described herein in terms of<br>
functional and/or logical block components, and with reference to symbolic<br>
representations of operations, processing tasks, and functions that may be<br>
performed by various computing components or devices. For the sake of<br>
brevity, conventional techniques related to inverters, AC motor control,<br>
electric and hybrid electric vehicle operation, and other functional aspects of<br>
the systems (and the individual operating components of the systems) may not<br>
be described in detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting lines shown in the<br>
various figures contained herein are intended to represent exemplary<br>
functional relationships and/or physical couplings between the various<br><br>
elements. It should be noted that many alternative or additional functional<br>
relationships or physical connections may be present in an embodiment of the<br>
subject matter.<br>
[0016]       As used herein, a "node" means any internal or external reference<br>
point, connection point, junction, signal line, conductive element, or the like,<br>
at which a given signal, logic level, voltage, data pattern, current, or quantity<br>
is present. Furthermore, two or more nodes may be realized by one physical<br>
element (and two or more signals can be multiplexed, modulated, or otherwise<br>
distinguished even though received or output at a common mode).<br>
[0017]       The following description refers to elements or nodes or features<br>
being "connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, unless expressly<br>
stated otherwise, "connected" means that one element/node/feature is directly<br>
joined to (or directly communicates with) another element/node/feature, and<br>
not necessarily mechanically. Likewise, unless expressly stated otherwise,<br>
"coupled" means that one element/node/feature is directly or indirectly joined<br>
to (or directly or indirectly communicates with) another element/node/feature,<br>
and not necessarily mechanically. Thus, although the schematic shown in<br>
FIG. 2 depicts one exemplary arrangement of elements, additional intervening<br>
elements, devices, features, or components may be present in an embodiment<br>
of the depicted subject matter.<br>
[0018]       A double ended inverter system for an electric traction system of a<br>
vehicle is described here. The double ended inverter system utilizes an<br>
impedance source inverter topology coupled to one DC energy source, and a<br>
traditional inverter topology coupled to another DC energy source. The use of<br>
an impedance source inverter topology makes it economical to employ voltage<br>
sources having significantly different voltage ratings. In certain embodiments,<br>
the traction system is designed such that both sides of the double ended<br>
inverter system have bi-directional charge capability.<br>
[0019]       FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of an exemplary vehicle 100<br>
that incorporates an embodiment of a double ended inverter system. Vehicle<br>
100 preferably incorporates an embodiment of a double ended inverter system<br><br>
as described in more detail below. The vehicle 100 generally includes a<br>
chassis 102, a body 104, four wheels 106, and an electronic control system<br>
108. The body 104 is arranged on chassis 102 and substantially encloses the<br>
other components of vehicle 100. The body 104 and chassis 102 may jointly<br>
form a frame. The wheels 106 are each rotationally coupled to chassis 102<br>
near a respective corner of body 104.<br>
[0020]       The vehicle 100 may be any one of a number of different types of<br>
automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport utility<br>
vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel drive or<br>
front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD), or all-wheel drive (AWD). The<br>
vehicle 100 may also incorporate any one of, or combination of, a number of<br>
different types of engines and/or traction systems, such as, for example, a<br>
gasoline or diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV)<br>
engine (i.e., using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound<br>
(e.g., hydrogen and natural gas) fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor<br>
hybrid engine, and an electric motor.<br>
[0021]       In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, vehicle 100 is a<br>
fully electric or a hybrid electric vehicle having an electric traction system,<br>
and vehicle 100 further includes an electric motor (or traction motor) 110, a<br>
first DC energy source 112 having a first nominal voltage, a second DC<br>
energy source 114 having a second nominal voltage, a double ended inverter<br>
system 116, and a radiator 118. As shown, first DC energy source 112 and<br>
second DC energy source 114 are in operable communication and/or<br>
electrically connected to electronic control system 108 and to double ended<br>
inverter system 116. It should also be noted that vehicle 100, in the depicted<br>
embodiment, does not include a direct current-to-direct current (DC/DC)<br>
power converter as an integral part of its electric traction propulsion system.<br>
[0022]       A DC energy source utilized by vehicle 100 may be realized as a<br>
battery, a battery pack, a fuel cell, a supercapacitor, or the like. For the<br>
embodiments described here, first DC energy source 112 and second DC<br>
energy source 114 are batteries (or battery packs) of significantly different<br><br>
voltages. Although not always required, this description assumes that first DC<br>
energy source 112 and second DC energy source 114 are rechargeable.<br>
Moreover, first DC energy source 112 and second DC energy source 114 may<br>
have other different and unmatched operating characteristics, such as current<br>
ratings. In this regard, first DC energy source 112 can be a relatively low<br>
voltage battery having a nominal operating voltage within the range of about<br>
12 to 42 volts. For purposes of this description, the exemplary embodiment of<br>
vehicle 100 employs a 12 volt battery for first DC energy source 112. In<br>
contrast, second DC energy source 114 can be a relatively high voltage battery<br>
having a nominal operating voltage within the range of about 42 to 350 volts.<br>
For purposes of this description, the exemplary embodiment of vehicle 100<br>
employs a battery that provides more than 60 volts (e.g., 100 volts) for second<br>
DC energy source 114. The techniques and technologies described herein are<br>
well suited for use in an embodiment wherein the nominal DC voltage<br>
provided by first DC energy source 112 is less than half of the nominal DC<br>
voltage provided by second DC energy source 114.<br>
[0023]       The motor 110 is preferably a three-phase alternating current (AC)<br>
electric traction motor, although other types of motors having a different<br>
number of phases could be employed. As shown in FIG. 1, motor 110 may<br>
also include or cooperate with a transmission such that imotor 110 and the<br>
transmission are mechanically coupled to at least some of the wheels 106<br>
through one or more drive shafts 120. The radiator 118 is connected to the<br>
frame at an outer portion thereof and although not illustrated in detail, includes<br>
multiple cooling channels that contain a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant), such as<br>
water and/or ethylene glycol (i.e., antifreeze). The radiator 118 is coupled to<br>
double ended inverter system 116 and to motor 110 for purposes of routing the<br>
coolant to those components. In one embodiment, double ended inverter<br>
system 116 receives and shares coolant with motor 110. In alternative<br>
embodiments, the double ended inverter system 116 may be air cooled.<br>
[0024]       The electronic control system 108 is in operable communication<br>
with motor 110, first DC energy source 112, second DC energy source 114,<br><br>
and double ended inverter system 116. Although not shown in detail,<br>
electronic control system 108 includes various sensors and automotive control<br>
modules, or electronic control units (ECUs), such as an inverter control<br>
module (i.e., the controller shown in FIG. 2) and a vehicle controller, and at<br>
least one processor and/or a memory which includes instructions stored<br>
thereon (or in another computer-readable medium) for carrying out the<br>
processes and methods as described below.<br>
[0025]       FIG. 2 is a schematic circuit representation of an embodiment of a<br>
double ended inverter system 200 suitable for use with an electric or hybrid<br>
electric vehicle. In certain embodiments, double ended inverter system 116<br>
(shown in FIG. 1) can be implemented in this manner. As depicted in FIG. 2,<br>
double ended inverter system 200 is coupled to, and cooperates with, an AC<br>
electric traction motor 202, a low voltage battery 204, and a high voltage<br>
battery 206. Double ended inverter system 200 generally includes, without<br>
limitation: an impedance source inverter subsystem 208 coupled to low<br>
voltage battery 204; an inverter subsystem 210 coupled to high voltage battery<br>
206, and a controller 212 coupled to impedance source inverter subsystem 208<br>
and to inverter subsystem 210. To support recharging of low voltage battery<br>
204, double ended inverter system 200 may utilize a switched diode element<br>
214 coupled between low voltage battery 204 and impedance source inverter<br>
subsystem 208. Double ended inverter system 200 allows AC electric traction<br>
motor 202 to be powered by the different batteries, even though the batteries<br>
have significantly different nominal operating voltages. As explained in more<br>
detail below, this topology can provide voltage matching between low voltage<br>
battery 204 and high voltage battery 206.<br>
[0026]       The AC electric traction motor 202, in one embodiment, is a three<br>
phase motor that includes a set of three windings (or coils) 216, each<br>
corresponding to one phase of AC electric traction motor 202, as is commonly<br>
understood. In one embodiment, the neutral point of AC electric traction<br>
motor 202 is opened up to make it a six terminal, three phase motor. Although<br>
not illustrated, AC electric traction motor 202 includes a stator assembly<br><br>
(including the coils) and a rotor assembly (including a ferromagnetic core), as<br>
will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.<br>
[0027]       Impedance source inverter subsystem 208 includes an inverter<br>
section 218, and inverter subsystem 210 includes an inverter section 220. For<br>
this embodiment, inverter section 218 and inverter section 220 each includes<br>
six switches (e.g., semiconductor devices, such as transistors) with antiparallel<br>
diodes (i.e., the direction of current through the transistor switch is opposite to<br>
the direction of allowable current through the respective diode). As shown,<br>
the switches in inverter section 218 of impedance source inverter subsystem<br>
208 are arranged into three pairs (or legs): pairs 222, 224, and 226. Similarly,<br>
the switches in inverter section 220 of inverter subsystem 210 are arranged<br>
into three pairs (or legs): pairs 228, 230, and 232. A first winding in the set of<br>
windings 216 is electrically coupled, at opposing ends thereof, between the<br>
switches of pair 222 (in inverter section 218) and the switches of pair 228 (in<br>
inverter section 220). A second winding in the set of windings 216 is coupled<br>
between the switches of pair 224 (in inverter section 218) and the switches of<br>
pair 230 (in inverter section 220). A third winding in the set of windings 216<br>
is coupled between the switches of pair 226 (in inverter section 218) and the<br>
switches of pair 232 (in inverter section 220). Thus, one end of each winding<br>
is coupled to impedance source inverter subsystem 208, and the opposite end<br>
of each winding is coupled to inverter subsystem 210.<br>
[0028]       Impedance source inverter subsystem 208 and inverter subsystem<br>
210 are configured to drive AC electric traction motor 202, individually or<br>
collectively (depending upon the particular operating conditions). In this<br>
regard, controller 212 is suitably configured to influence the operation of<br>
impedance source inverter subsystem 208 and inverter subsystem 210 to<br>
manage power transfer among low voltage battery 204, high voltage battery<br>
206, and AC electric traction motor 202. For example, the controller 212 is<br>
preferably configured to be responsive to commands received from the driver<br>
of the vehicle (e.g., via an accelerator pedal) and provides control signals or<br>
commands to inverter section 218 of impedance source inverter subsystem 208<br><br>
and to inverter section 220 of inverter subsystem 210 to control the output of<br>
inverter sections 218 and 220. In practice, high frequency pulse width<br>
modulation (PWM) techniques may be employed to control inverter sections<br>
218 and 220 and to manage the voltage produced by inverter sections 218 and<br>
220.<br>
[0029]       In addition to inverter section 218, impedance source inverter<br>
subsystem 208 includes a crossed LC X-link 234, which is coupled between<br>
inverter section 218 and low voltage battery 204. This particular embodiment<br>
of crossed LC X-link 234 includes a first inductance element 236, a second<br>
inductance element 238, a first capacitance element 240, and a second<br>
capacitance element 242. One end of inductance element 236 is coupled to a<br>
node 244, and the other end of inductance element 236 is coupled to a node<br>
246. One end of inductance element 238 is coupled to a node 248, and the<br>
other end of inductance element 238 is coupled to a node 250. Inverter section<br>
218 may be connected between nodes 246 and 250, as depicted in FIG. 2. In<br>
this regard, nodes 246 and 250 may be considered to be input and/or output<br>
nodes of inverter section 218. One end of capacitance element 240 is coupled<br>
to node 246, and the other end of capacitance element 240 is coupled to node<br>
248. One end of capacitance element 242 is coupled to node 244, and the<br>
other end of capacitance element 242 is coupled to node 250. In other words,<br>
capacitance element 240 is coupled between the first end of inductance<br>
element 236 and the second end of inductance element 238, while capacitance<br>
element 242 is coupled between the first end of inductance element 238 and<br>
the second end of inductance element 236. The inductance and capacitance of<br>
the components in crossed LC X-link 234 are selected based upon factors such<br>
as the switching frequency of inverter section 218, the output frequency, the<br>
amount of tolerable ripple current, etc. Crossed LC X-link 234 operates in a<br>
known manner to facilitate operation of impedance source inverter subsystem<br>
208 in a buck or boost mode, as described in more detail below.<br>
[0030]       Impedance source inverter subsystem 208 generally operates in the<br>
following manner. Crossed LC X-link 234 is ideally modulated at twice (or<br><br>
six times, depending on the control method) the switching frequency of<br>
inverter section 218, because crossed LC X-link 234 is active during the off<br>
states of the switching network. During the off states of the switching network<br>
(i.e., all upper or lower switches on) the effective voltage of the impedance<br>
network can be boosted by turning on both switches in one, two, or three of<br>
the phase legs for a controlled duration. This shoot-through condition charges<br>
the inductors, which add to the available effective DC link voltage during the<br>
next active state of inverter section 218. In this regard, impedance source<br>
inverter subsystem 208 and crossed LC X-link 234 may function in<br>
accordance with known principles and techniques. For example, operation of<br>
a known impedance source power converter is described in United States<br>
Patent number 7,130,205, the content of which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein.<br>
[0031]       For the illustrated embodiment, node 248 is coupled to the low<br>
potential terminal of low voltage battery 204 (e.g., a ground or other<br>
reference), and node 244 is coupled to one side of switched diode element<br>
214. Moreover, the other side of switched diode element 214 is coupled to the<br>
high potential terminal of low voltage battery 204. Switched diode element<br>
214 may include a switch 252 and a diode 254 coupled anti-parallel to switch<br>
252. For this particular implementation, switch 252 and diode 254 are both<br>
coupled between the positive terminal of low voltage battery 204 and node<br>
244. More specifically, the anode of diode 254 is coupled to low voltage<br>
battery 204, and the cathode of diode 254 is coupled to node 244. Controller<br>
212 may be suitably configured to control the activation of switch 252 as<br>
needed to support operation of double ended inverter system 200 in different<br>
modes. For example, switched diode element 214 can be controlled into a first<br>
state (when switch 252 is closed) to accommodate charging of low voltage<br>
battery 204 via impedance source inverter subsystem 208. This first state<br>
corresponds to the recharge operating mode of double ended inverter system<br>
200. Switched diode element 214 can also be controlled into a second state<br>
(when switch 252 is open) that limits current flow into low voltage battery<br><br>
204. In other words, when in the second state, diode 254 allows current to<br>
flow from low voltage battery 204 into crossed LC X-link 234, while<br>
preventing or limiting current flow in the opposite direction.<br>
[0032]       Depending upon the implementation and manner of deployment of<br>
double ended inverter system 200, controller 212 can be suitably configured to<br>
control impedance source inverter subsystem 208 and/or inverter subsystem<br>
210 in accordance with a number of different operating modes. Such<br>
operating modes may include, without limitation, a boost operating mode, a<br>
traditional inverter operating mode, a recharge operating mode, or the like. In<br>
the boost operating mode, impedance source inverter subsystem 208 boosts<br>
the nominal DC voltage of low voltage battery 204 for compatibility and<br>
matching with high voltage battery 206. To sustain the boost operating mode,<br>
controller 212 opens switch 252 such that crossed LC X-link 234 can function<br>
to increase the potential across nodes 246 and 250 to a voltage that exceeds<br>
that of low voltage battery 204. More specifically, the voltage across nodes<br>
246 and 250 is boosted such that it approximates or equals the nominal DC<br>
voltage of high voltage battery 206. As a result, the AC output voltage of<br>
inverter section 218 is higher relative to the AC output voltage that would<br>
otherwise be obtained by a traditional inverter topology. This higher voltage<br>
afforded by the inclusion of impedance source inverter subsystem 208 can be<br>
used to operate double ended inverter system 200 at a more efficient operating<br>
point. For this type of operation, low voltage battery 204 is providing either<br>
active power to AC electric traction motor 202 or providing zero active power<br>
such that inverter section 218 is providing only reactive power to AC electric<br>
traction motor 202, acting to improve the power factor of double ended<br>
inverter system 200.<br>
[0033]       Controller 212 also opens switch 252 to sustain operation in the<br>
traditional inverter operating mode. In the traditional inverter operating mode,<br>
controller 212 maintains the nominal DC voltage of low voltage battery 204.<br>
In other words, the voltage is not boosted. Although the AC output voltage is<br>
limited, the desired motor operating point may not require a higher voltage<br><br>
and, hence, the lower available voltage may be sufficient, thus providing a<br>
more efficient overall operating point. As mentioned above, controller 212<br>
closes switch 252 for the recharge operating mode, and controls inverter<br>
sections 218 and 220 to provide an appropriate flow of recharging energy into<br>
low voltage battery 204. During the recharge operating mode, impedance<br>
source inverter subsystem 208 is operated in a manner akin to a traditional<br>
inverter. In this mode, the AC output voltage of inverter section 218 is limited<br>
to that of a traditional inverter.<br>
[0034]       Referring also to FIG. 1, vehicle 100 is operated by providing<br>
power to wheels 106 via the AC electric traction motor 202, which receives its<br>
operating energy from low voltage battery 204 and/or high voltage battery<br>
206. In order to power the motor, DC power is provided from low voltage<br>
battery 204 and high voltage battery 206 to inverter section 218 and inverter<br>
section 220, respectively, which convert the DC power into AC power, as is<br>
commonly understood in the art. In certain embodiments, if the motor does<br>
not require the maximum power output of low voltage battery 204, the extra<br>
power from low voltage battery 204 may be used to charge high voltage<br>
battery 206. Similarly, if the motor does not require the maximum power<br>
output of high voltage battery 206, the extra power from high voltage battery<br>
206 may be used to charge low voltage battery 204. Of course, under certain<br>
operating conditions, controller 212 can be utilized to drive the motor using<br>
energy from both energy sources.<br>
[0035]       In operation, controller 212 receives a torque command for AC<br>
electric traction motor 202, and determines how best to manage the flow of<br>
power between low voltage battery 204 and impedance source inverter<br>
subsystem 208, and between high voltage battery 206 and inverter subsystem<br>
210. In this manner, controller 212 also regulates the manner in which<br>
inverter section 218 and inverter section 220 drive AC electric motor 202.<br>
Double ended inverter system 200 may utilize any suitable control<br>
methodology, protocol, scheme, or technique. For example, certain aspects of<br>
the techniques and technologies described in United States Patent numbers<br><br>
7,154,237 and 7,199,535 (both assigned to General Motors Corporation) may<br>
be employed by double ended inverter system 200. The relevant content of<br>
these patents is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0036]       In practice, the vehicle may include a battery controller, which may<br>
be separate from or integrated with controller 212 (typically, it will be<br>
separate). The battery controller is suitably configured to monitor the state of<br>
charge information (along with other information, such as cell balancing) of<br>
the batteries. The battery controller can analyze and/or process such<br>
information and provide a power capability to the vehicle controller. The<br>
vehicle controller processes the information obtained from the battery<br>
controller, along with driver commands, to determine how best to meet the<br>
driver's request and satisfy any subsystem requests such as power balancing<br>
between the two energy sources.<br>
[0037]       Although the illustrated embodiment utilizes an impedance source<br>
inverter subsystem for the low voltage side, alternate embodiments may utilize<br>
an impedance source inverter subsystem for the high voltage side in lieu of (or<br>
in addition to) an impedance source inverter subsystem for the low voltage<br>
side. In addition, the embodiment described above contemplates two DC<br>
energy sources having different nominal voltages. An alternate embodiment<br>
may utilize one or two impedance source inverter subsystems with two DC<br>
energy sources having approximately the same nominal voltage.<br>

of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the<br>
