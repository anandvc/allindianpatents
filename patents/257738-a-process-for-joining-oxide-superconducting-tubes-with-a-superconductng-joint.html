				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for joining oxide-superconducting tubes with a superconducting joint. More particularly, it relates to joining oxide superconducting (Bi, Pb)2 Sra C&amp;2 Cu3 OIQ+X tubes with a superconducting joint that stably carries transport current with minimum degradation. Using this process, long conductors with strong superconducting joint can be developed particularly for applications like superconducting transmission cables, current leads, medical MRI systems, superconducting power reserving systems etc.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
One of the major problems inhibiting widespread applications of oxide superconductors particularly to either large-scale or complicated systems, for example, for superconducting transmission cables, bus bar, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems, medical diagnostic tools (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), superconducting magnet energy storage systems (SMES), superconducting generators single-crystal drawing-up systems in a magnetic field, freezer cooling superconducting magnets, nuclear fission reactor magnets, accelerators, magnetic separation units, large scale devices, current leads and the like, where it is necessary not only to pass transport current as high as 103 A or more but is also essential to have a long conductor with stable superconductivity along its entire length. And it is impossible to fabricate the whole system in a single piece. Consequently, it is frequently necessary to join superconductors to each other (end-to-end) in order to form a joined superconductor of sufficient length, which is stabilized and is in a state capable of ensuring a heavy current. Thus it is very essential that these joints between such superconductors must have the same superconducting properties, as of the original shorter length itself to be useful in a given application.<br>
Further, it is also necessary that a technique be available for removing and replacing a section of the superconducting material if it becomes damaged by the thermal/mechanical shocks while working. The contact between the replaced new piece and the undamaged sections of the original piece must be superconducting and also should have the same current capacity as the original and replaced piece themselves.<br>
So far established technique for making superconducting joint for metal superconductors, such as NbTi and NbsSn is in the wire form. In contrast to these metal<br>
superconductors, the situation for oxide superconductors is particularly problematic due to their brittle nature, poor ductility and low breaking resistance etc.<br>
To produce joints between oxide superconductors, similar methods like overlapping fusing, laser welding, spot welding, soldering, brazing, lap joining, butt joining, ultrasonic joining, laminate joining etc. as used for metal superconductors are developed. However, these are related to Ag-clad wires/tapes of both mono and multifilaments [Japan. J. Appl. Physics, vol.34, p.4770 (1995); U.S. Patent, 6,133,814; U.S. Patent, 6,159,905, U.S. Patent, 6,753,748, Appl. Supercond, vol,3, p 207 (1995); Supercond. Sci. Technol. Vol, 13, p.237 (2000); U.S. Patent, 6,194,2226]. On the other hand, very few methods for joining oxide bulk superconductors in bulk form like bars, disks, rods etc. have been proposed up to now. But these are now beginning to attract more attention.<br>
Reference may be made to two Japanese Patents Laid-open No. Hei 1(1989&gt;24379; and Japanese Patent Laid-open No.Hei 1 (1989)-173 84, wherein, the joint parts are produced through solid state reaction. Both these methods lead to randomly oriented and low-density joined parts that a sufficient critical current density (Jc)is hard to procure.<br>
In another reference: Journal of the Electrochemical Society, volume 136, Number 2, pp 582-583 (February 1989)", Y.Tzeng discloses an improved method, wherein the joint portion is produced through melting using an autogeneous welding technique in which end faces of two bar pieces of preformed superconducting bulk YBa2 Cu3O7.x are overlapped, heated to melt and fused together with a subsequent recovery heating of the joined portion. It is taught that the joint having Jc which is about the same as that of the original component bars can be produced by this method.<br>
In U.S. Patent 5,244,876, a similar autogeneous welding technique to join preformed silver sheathed Bi2Sr2CaiCu2Og+x superconducting rods/disks, has been used but with a change. Instead of overlapping, the disclosure places end faces of the two superconductors close together with a gap and filling this gap with molten material of the same superconducting rod followed by recovery heating of the joined portion.<br>
The above two known joining methods have the following problems. The joint is generally resistive, because the joint parts thereof are produced through melting of the preformed superconducting phase, that a full recovery of damaged superconducting phase is hard to procure.<br>
Li et.al. in reference: J. Less-Common Met. Vol-164/165, p.660 (1990), disclosed a welding method for joining of preformed Bi-based superconducting bars by using an LPG-02 flame. It is taught that during welding, the top of the samples soon melted and a gap appears, and the tiny particles from the same melt is added to fill the gap. Then reporting formation of a superconducting joint after a heat treatment. However, drawback of this method is that the joint portion is larger, which makes the joint mechanically poor.<br>
J.Cai et.al in reference: Supercond. Sci.Technol. volume 5, p599 (1992) disclosed a Microwave technique for joining of (Bi, Pb)-2223 preformed superconducting bars end to end under an axial compressive load and then reporting mechanically strong joint. However, drawback of this method is that the disclosures do not disclose about the superconducting properties of the joint.<br>
In U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,116,810 and 5, 321, 003, both to Joshi et al, also make use of a similar method but in contrast to joint formation between preformed superconducting components, the joint according to this patent is formed between shaped pieces of metallic precursor rare earth elements and the joined portion is spot welded with a subsequent heating to form superconducting phase. Although, the joints formed prior to formation of superconducting phase are substantially non-resistive in nature, however, it is frequently inconvenient to perform such joining operations on elemental precursors, rather than on components in the superconducting state.<br>
Mutoh et.al. in Japanese J. Apply. Phys. Vol.29, No.8, p LI432 (Aug. 1990) disclosed a method using (Bi, Pb)-2223 tablets pumped up from melts. Joint is formed between a pair of such tablets: unannealed, annealed and annealed with an unannealed insert plate. Two tablets aligned, one on top of the other, and hot pressed at various temperatures and pressures. Then reporting, a good superconducting joint can only be obtained when annealed starting melt (i.e. second case) was used. Drawback of this method lies in the presence of unavoidable traces of impurity phases both in the bulk as well as in the joined portion, thereby leading to a poor quality end product.<br>
In another reference: Jap. J. Appl. Phys. Vol.29, p L875 (1990), although the disclosure used the same hot pressing method as used in the above citation, for joining of thick films, however, concludes differently. That is, according to this study, acceptable joints are only possible with completely reacted material rather than precursor material for the hot pressing process. However, drawback of this method is that weak superconducting joints are formed.<br>
In the methods described in Japan Patents Laid-open Nos.5 Hei 3(1991)-242384; Hei 3 (1991)- 254473, use is made of partial melt solidification (i.e. crystallization from the melted state) of the preformed superconducting bodies of Bi-2212 to be joined to produce a dense and oriented matrix in the joint portion so as to result in a superconducting joint. For this method of crystallization from the melted state, use of a method of insertion of an intervening substance having lower melting point than that of the connecting bodies is made. According to the method in former patent an intervening substance is either a precursor or calcined body in powder form which is filled in the joint part, followed by thermal treatment for crystallization from the melted state. Whereas in this method, the joint part is largely oriented and dense in comparison to the above methods. This method, however, has a draw back due to difference in thermal treatments (by about 10°C) of the bodies to be joined and of the intervening substance because of their different melting temperatures, good jointing can be attained only with much difficulty. Further, if the intervening substance is singly melted, the crystal growing in liquid phase is hardly connected to the bodies to be joined.<br>
In the method disclosed in the latter patent, the intervening substance is a calcined powder containing Bi-2212 phase. Disadvantage of this method lies in the reduction of crystal orientation at the joint part as compared with the orientation within the component parts due to variation in the melting temperature as a result of changing ratio of the calcined powder mixed to the Bi-2212 phase as the heating proceeds. Consequently, it leads to reduction of Ic at the joint part.<br>
An improvement in the above method is disclosed in U.S. Patent,6,258,754, wherein the overall assembly of joining YbBa2Cu3O7_Y powder sandwiched between two independent performed superconducting single YBa2Cu3O7_x domains and of the joint portion is heat-treated such that melting occurs only in the interface and the bonding material grows epitaxially. Then reporting strongly linked bars. Rings (rectangular or square) can also be joined together by stacking one over the other. This method however, has a drawback when a powder is used as the joining material, the air present between the particles cannot escape even in the course of melting and solidification of the joining material and therefore, result in not only pores but also segregation of impurities in the joined portion.<br>
To overcome the problem occurring due to trapped air with the use of powder of YbBa2Cu3O7-Y as the joining material in the above patents, lida et.al. in U.S. Patent:7,001,870 made use of a sintered dense material of YbBa2Cu3O7.Y which is<br>
interposed between two sintered YbBa2Cu3O7.Y blocks, and this sintered joining material is melted and then solidified to form a joining layer, thereby joining the YbBa2Cii3O7.x rectangular blocks. Although, this sintered material provided a relatively better joint, however, the drawback of this method is that, even a slight difference in the recrystallization points, crystal structures etc. of the joining material from that of the blocks fails to make a strong superconducting joint.<br>
All the above methods having their own merits and limitations are related to joining of bulk bodies in solid form: like wires/tapes, Ag-sheathed rods, ribbons, sheets, bars, blocks and in hollow form: like rings having rectangular or square cross section and not having circular cross-section in order to keep the interface angle below 10 degree for easy joining and that too by stacking samples of small size in millimeter range. Thus, attention has not been paid to a method for joining together hollow bodies of large size and having circular cross section, like tube conductors which are now under rapid technical development due to their Ic values which are not much limited by the self-magnetic field in comparison to those of the solid rod conductors.<br>

Detail description of the invention<br>
In the present invention a process for joining a pair of tubes of oxide superconductor particularly to (Bi Pb)2 Sr2 Ca2 Cu3 Oio+x [Bi, Pb)-2223] is disclosed. In this, the said joined pair is a current lead in tube shape with both end silver metallic contacts. To produce such a joined lead of longer length, the method included a step of preparing a starting powder of high temperature superconductor of (Bi Pb)2 Sr2 Ca2 Cus Oio+xWith addition of Ag from spray drying method with an immediate calcination. Cold isopressing of the calcined powder into a tube with a subsequent sintering followed by grinding and mixing to obtain a homogeneous partially preformed superconducting powder. Then cold isopressing of partially preformed superconducting powder material in tube shape. Lapping one of the end faces of such a pair of tubes. Clubbing the said pair of tubes longitudinally end to end on a silver bush so that the lapped end faces are in contact with each other. It is these end portions where the joint is formed. Applying a<br>
paste of the same said partially preformed superconducting powder material on the said lapped faces. These coated end faces are put in contact touching each other, subsequently wrapped with a perforated silver foil and deposited metal silver layer by spray gun. Followed by a final step of co-sintering the overall assembly of this contact portion and the tube pair in air. The joint has made on tubes of different dimensions. The joint made has critical current (Ic) not less than at least 90% of the lesser of the critical current of the individual tubes. Further, the joint is capable of carrying a continuous current of more than 500 Amp. at 77 K in self-field. The contact resistivity of the joint is not less than 10" 6-10"7 micro ohms at 77 K.<br>
In a feature of the present invention, the calcinations of the starting spray dried is effected at a temperature of the order of 800° ± 10° in air for a period of the order of one hour to obtain a precursor powder for sintering.<br>
In another feature of the present invention, the cold isopressing of the calcined powder into a large size tube is effected at a pressure of 300 MPa.<br>
In yet another feature of the present invention, the size of the tube obtained from cold isostatically pressed calcined powder is of the length of the order of 430mm, outer diameter of the order of 50mm and wall thickness in the range of 2 to 3 mm.<br>
In yet another feature of the present invention, the grinding of the first sintered oxide superconductor tube into powder and mixing is effected by known methods.<br>
In still another feature the cold isopressing of the first sintered tube powder (hereafter, referred as partially preformed superconducting powder material) into tubes is effected at a pressure of 400 MPa.<br>
In yet another feature of the present invention, the organic formulation consists of polyvinyl buturyal (binder) cyclohexane (solvent) and fish oil (dispersant).<br>
In yet another feature of the present invention, weight of partially preformed superconducting powder material in the paste varies from 4 gms to 8 gms.<br>
In yet another feature of the present invention the quantity of polyvinyl buturyal in the paste varies from 0.4 gm to 1.2 gms<br>
In yet another feature of the present invention the quantity of cyclohexanone in the paste varies from 2 C.C to 5 C.C.<br>
In yet another feature of the present invention, the paste of partially preformed superconducting powder material may be made in silver paste in weight ratio of 10:1.<br>
In still another feature of the present invention, the organic formulation may be isoamylacetate whose quantity varies from 3 C.C to 7 C.C. for 5 gms to 7 gms of the partially preformed powder material.<br>
This invention addresses a technique that can be utilized to develop strongly joined tubes of various sizes with high current-carrying capacity desirable for various applications such as magnetic shields, fault current limiters, current leads, and the like. The joint can carry continuous transport current more than 500 A at 77K in self-field. This is a novel method of joining oxide superconductor components because the present invention provides joints between bodies which are hollow and that can account for the superconductivity.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in a process for preparing a superconducting joint between hollow oxide superconductors which is superconducting with carrying capacity of more than 500 A. The non obvious inventive step is the use of partially preformed superconducting bodies and applying a paste of the same material with an organic formulation on the end faces of these bodies by simple steps as detailed herein above.<br>
This joining technique may be applied widely to superconducting appliances for example, superconducting transmission cables, bus bars, long conductors, permanent current switch devices, nuclear magnet resonance systems, medicinal MRI systems, superconducting power reserving systems, magnetic separation units, single crystal drawing-out systems in magnetic fields, freezer cooling superconducting magnet systems and the like and also to the application of high field magnet systems, where long length current leads are required for instance to connect a power source or other conventional equipments like accelerators etc. to the superconducting components.<br>
Figure of the drawings 1 illustrates X-ray diffractrogram of partially preformed powder material used for making tubes as joining bodies and also used as a bonding material showing the presence of desired superconducting (Bi,Pb)-2223 phase along with secondary phases: Bi-2212, Ca2PbO4 and CuO.<br>
The process of making joint between a pair of tubes in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in figure 2 of the drawings accompanying this specification, wherein reference numeral 1 is a (Bi, Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3Oio+x tube; numeral 2 designates: groove; numeral 3 is a silver layer; numeral 4 is a lapped face; numeral 5 is a silver bush; numeral 6 is a paste; numeral 7 is a perforated silver foil; and numeral 8 is a silver layer.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the X-ray diffractogram of the unitary tube conductor of figure 2 made according to the method of the present invention showing the presence of desired (Bi,Pb)-2223 phase.<br>
For phase identification of both the partially preformed powder material and of the unitary tube of figure 2 prepared by the process of the present invention were taken by using a Brucker D-8 powder X-ray diffractrometer with CuKa radiations.<br>
Figure 4(a) &amp; (b) of the drawings represents the relationship between voltage and current through (a) a unitary superconductor on the one hand (b) a superconductor joined made according to the method of the invention on the other hand. Critical current (Ic) was determined using 1 micro-volt/cm criterion.<br>
The critical current (Ic) and voltage of the unitary tube superconductor and of the joined tube pair prepared by the process of the present invention described herein above were measured by four-terminal method as illustrated in figure 5 of the drawings accompanying this specification. Contact resistivity of the unitary tube superconductor and of the joint part was also measured by four terminal methods as illustrated in figure 6 of the drawings accompanying this specification. For this, eight terminals designated with numeral (2) were made on the superconductor portion designated with numeral (1). All these terminals were of silver. Two outer and two middle terminals (electrode portion) were current terminals and the inner two terminals on either side of the middle current terminals were voltage terminals. In four-probe method, for voltage taps, air-drying silver paste was used and connecting copper leads were soldered directly to the superconductor close the current contact. Accuracy of the measurements was about ±10%. The measurements were at a sample temperature of 77 K and in zero magnetic fields (OT).<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore, should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
Spray dried starting powder with addition of silver was prepared by weighing each raw nitrate powder of the constituent elements Bi,Pb,Sr,Ca and Cu in mole ratio of 1.84:0.35:1.91:2.05:3.05 and Ag in mole ratio of 1.2.

The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>

desired superconducting phase (Bi-2223) in pure form during final heat treatment.<br>
3.	Use of the same partially preformed superconducting material for both the bodies<br>

with sufficient Ic.<br>
4.	Use of joining material in paste form formed from powder of the partially<br>
preformed superconducting material mixed in an organic formulation provides a<br>
homogeneous and dense packing of the superconducting particles on the end faces<br>

full recovery of the desired superconducting phase is hard to procure.<br><br>
