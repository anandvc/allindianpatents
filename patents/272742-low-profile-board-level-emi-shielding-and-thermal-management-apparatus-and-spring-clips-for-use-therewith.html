				<td>LOW-PROFILE BOARD LEVEL EMI SHIELDING AND THERMAL MANAGEMENT APPARATUS AND SPRING CLIPS FOR USE THEREWITH<br>
FIELD [0001]     The present disclosure generally relates (but not exclusiveiy) to low-profile apparatus that include spring clips and are capable of providing board level EMI shielding and dissipation of heat generated by one or more electrical components of a board.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Electronic equipment includes electrical components and circuits that are mounted or supported on a substrate and that can be sensitive to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). Such EMI/RFI interference may originate from internal sources within the eiectronic equipment and/or from external EMI/RFI interference sources. Interference can cause degradation or complete loss of important signals, rendering the electronic equipment inefficient or inoperable. Accordingly, the circuits (sometimes refeired to as RF modules or transceiver circuits) usually require EMI/RFI shielding in order to function properly. The EMI/RFI shielding can reduce interference not only from extemal sources, but also from various functional blocks within the module.<br>
[0004] As used herein, the tenn "EMI" should be considered to generally include and refer to both EMI and RFI emissions, and the tenn "electromagnetic" should be considered to generally include and refer to both electromagnetic and radio frequency from external sources and intemal sources. Accordingly, the tenn shielding (as used herein) generally includes and refers to both EMI shielding and RFi shielding, for example, to prevent (or at least reduce) ingress and egress of EMI and RFI relative to a housing or other enclosure in which electronic equipment is disposed.<br>
[0005] By way of example, electronic circuits or components of a printed circuit board (PCB) are often covered with shields to localize EMI within its source and to insulate other devices proximal to the EMi source.<br>
 <br>
Such shields may be soldered or otherwise affixed to the PCB, thus increasing the overall size of the PCB. Soldered shields, however, may need to be removed to repair or replace the covered component, which can be an expensive and time consuming task that can even cause damage to the PCB. [0006] In addition, many electronic or electrical components generate significant amounts of heat (e.g., resistor, power transistor, microprocessor, etc.). Excessive heat build up can lead to reduced product life and reliabiJJty. Thus, various constructions have been proposed for removing heat generated by electronic or electrical components.<br>
SUMIWARY<br>
[0007] According to various aspects of the present disclosure, exemplary embodiments are provided of low-profile apparatus capable of providing board level EMI shielding and dissipation of heat generated by one or more electrical components of a board. Other aspects relate to components of low-profile board level EMI shielding and thermal management assemblies. Further aspects relate to methods of using low-profile board level EMI shielding and thermal management assemblies. Additional aspects relate to methods of making low-profile board level EM) shielding and therma} management assemblies, and methods of making components thereof.<br>
[0008] (n one partcuiar embodiment, an apparatus generally includes a resiiiently compressible EMI gasket, a heat sink, and a spring clip. The spring clip has resilient legs with feet. The feet are configured to engage the board. When the feet are engaged with the board, a clamping force is generated that compresslvely biases the heat sink and the resiiiently compressive EMI gasket generally towards the board.<br>
[0009] Other exemplary embodiments indude spring clips that can be used with low-profile board level EM! shielding and heat dissipation assemblies. In one such embodiment, a spring clip generally includes resilient fegs downwardly depending from a connecting member. The connecting member and resilient legs can cooperatively define a generally inverted U-shaped profile. The resilient legs can have generally U-shaped feet for engaging a board supporting one or more electrical components. The connecting member can be resiiiently biased to have a first generally concave<br>
 <br>
configuration w/hen the feet are disengaged from the board. But the connecting member can be fiexed into a second generally flat configuration when the spring clip's feet are engaged with the board. This flexing of the resifiently biased connecting member into the second generally flat configuration can generate a clamping force generally between the connecting member and the board.<br>
[0010] Further embodiments relate to methods of providing board level EMI shielding and dissipating heat from one or more electrical componente of a board. In one such embodiment, a method generally includes positioning a generally inverted U-shaped spring clip having resilient legs relative to the board to engage generally U-shaped feet of the resilient legs with the board. The engagement of the feet wrth the board can apply a clamping force that compressively biases a heat sink and an EMI gasket generally towards the board.<br>

In addition, any one or more aspects of the present disctosure may be implemented individually or in any combination with any one or more of the other aspects of the present disclosure. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disdosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0026] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is In no way intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0027] According to various aspects of the present disclosure, exemplary embodiments are provided of low-profile apparatus capable of providing board level EMI shielding and dissipation of heat generated by one or more electrical components of a board. Other aspects relate to components<br>
 <br>
of low-profile board level EMI shielding and thennal management assemblies. Further aspects relate to methods of using low-profile board level EMI shielding and thermal management assemblies. Additional aspects relate to methods of making low-profile board level EMI shielding and themial management assemblies, and methods of making components thereof.<br>
[0028] In various embodiments, an apparatus generally includes a board level EMI shielding gasket (e.g., electrically-conductive elastomer, etc.) for electrically grounding the apparatus to a board, such as a printed circuit board, etc. The apparatus also includes one or more structures for dissipating heat generated by the one or more electrical components surface-mounted to or othenA^se supported by the board. A heat dissipaiion structure can also be generally refened to herein as a heat sink or heat spreader.<br>
[0029] In some embodiments, the heat sink can cooperate with the EMI gasket to provide EMI shielding and thermal management (e.g., heat dissipation and cooiing, etc.) for the one or more electrical components (e.g., electronics package, circuits, etc.) over which the apparatus is disposed. A thennal interface (e.g., a thermal interfece material, a pad of thermally-conductive material, etc.) can be disposed generally between the heat sink and the electrical component(s) being shielded. The thermal interface can help facilitate transfer of heat generated by the electrical component(s} to the heat sink.<br>
[0030] In some embodiments, a thermal interi^ace materiai and resiliently compressible EMI gasket can be coupled to or attached (e.g., adhesively attached, dispensed via form-ln-place dispensing equipment, molded onto, etc.) to a carrier. Alternative embodiments can include low-profile EMI shielding and ttiermal management apparatus that do not include a separate canier piece. In such embodiments, for example, one or more suitable materials can be coupled or attached directly to the heat sink, to thereby form a resiliently compressible EMI gasket and/or thermal interface. By way of example, various embodiments include electrically-conductive and thermally-conductive elastomer that is adhesively attached, dispensed via torm-in-place dispensing equipment, and/or molded (e.g., overmolded onto, etc.) to the heat sink. In some embodiments, an electrically-conductive elastomer   is  attached   directly  to  the   heat  sink  to  fonrt   a   resiliently<br>
 <br>
compressible EMI gasket, and another material is also attached to the heat sink to forni a thermal interface. In such embodiments, the themnal interface material preferably comprise a more themially-conductive material tian the electrically-conductive elastomer used to form the EMI gasket, although this is not required for all embodiments.<br>
[0031] In various embodiments of the shielding and themial management apparatus, spring-action retaining devices (e.g., a spring clip, clamp, etc.) are used for providing the mechanical or clamping force for low themial impedance. In such embodiments, the spring-action retaining device can have resilient legs and be generally referred to herein as a spring clip. Accordingly, various embodiments include spring clips having engagement members (e.g., U-shaped feet, etc.). The engagement members can be configured to engage a board, such as by positioned the engagement members through corresponding holes in a board and then engaging (e.g., hooking under, etc.) a lower surface of the board. This lower surface may be the bottommost surface of the board, but this Is not required. Additionally, or alternatively, the spring clip's engagement members may be positioned generally around the sides of the board (instead of through holes in the board) to thereby engage the board's underside or a lower surface portion of the board. When the spring dip is installed and engaged to the board, a sufficient mechanical or clamping fores can be generated for compressively biasing the heat sink generally towards the board. In this exemplary manner, the spring clip can help create and maintain sufficient contact for providing the EMI shielding and thermal management apparatus with low thermal impedance and good heat dissipation capacity.<br>
[0032] In some embodiments, the biasing force applied by a spring clip can also help hold the heat sink down firmly against an EMI gasket and/or against a thermal interfece. This, in turn, can help reduce any gaps, such as gaps between the EMI gasket and the heat sink, gaps between the heat sink and the thermal interfece, and/or gaps between the EMI gasket and the board. Reducing (and, in some cases, eliminating) such gaps can thereby inhibit electromagnetic energy from passing through or leaking out through those gaps.<br>
 <br>
[0033] A wide range of materiais can be used for any of the various components of an EMI shielding and thermai management apparatus. Some embodiments include a sheet metal heat sink and/or a sheet metal carrier. These and other embodiments can also include an EMI gasket formed from electrically-conductive elastomer, and a thermal interface formed from themially-conductive elastomer (which may also be electrically conductive). The elastomer materials fontiing the EMI gasket and/or thermal interface can be provided (e.g., attached, adhesively attached, dispensed via form-in-place dispensing equipment, molded, overmolded, etc.) to a earner and/or directly to a heat sink.<br>
[0034] In those embodiments that include a earner, the carrier can help maintain the plan-view shape of the EMI gasket when the EM! gasket is being compressed after installation of the spring clip. The carrier can also provide a surface for supporting (e.g., attaching, carrying, etc.) a thennal interface.<br>
[0035] In one particular embodiment, an apparatus generally includes a resiliently compressible EMI gasket, a heat sink, and a spring clip. The spring clip has resilient legs with feet. The feet are configured to engage the board. When the feet are engaged with the board, a clamping force is generated that compressively biases the heat sink and the resiiiently compressive EMI gasket generally towards the board.<br>
[003S] Other exemplary embodiments include spring clips that can be used with low-profile board level EMI shielding and heat dissipation assemblies. In one such embodiment, a spring clip generally includes resilient legs downwardly depending from a connecting member. The connecting member and resilient legs can cooperatively define a generally inverted U-shaped profile. The resilient legs can have generally U-shaped feet for engaging a boand supporting one or more electrical components. The connecting member can be resiliently biased to have a first generally concave configuration when the feet are disengaged from the board. But the connecting member can be flexed into a second generally flat configuration when the spring clip's feet are engaged with the board. This flexing of the resiliently   biased   connecting   member   into  the   second   generally  flat<br>
 <br>
configuration can generate a clamping force generally between the connecting member and the board.<br>
[0037] Further embodiments relate to methods of providing board level EMI shielding and dissipating heat from one or more electrical components of a board. In one such embodiment, a method generally includes positioning a generally inverted U-shaped spring clip having resilient legs relative to the board to engage generally U-shaped feet of the resilient legs with the board. The engagement of the feet with the board can apply a clamping force that compressively biases a heat sink and a resiliently compressive EMI gasket generally towards the board.<br>
[0038] FIGS. 1 through 4 illustrate an exemplary combined low-profile EMI shielding and thermal management apparatus 100 embodying one or more aspects of the present disclosure. As shown, the apparatus 100 generally includes a resiliently compressible EMI gasket 104, a heat sink 108, a thermal interface 110, a carrier 112, and a spring clip 114.<br>
[0039] FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate the apparatus 100 disposed over an electrical con:^onent 116, which, in turn, is surfece-mounted to (or othenwise supported by) the board 120. The apparatus 100 can shieid the electrical component 116 and dissipate heat generated by the electrical component 115. For example, the apparatus 100 can shield the electrical component 116 from electromagnetic interference (EMI) emitted from other components (not shown) external to the apparatus 100 and/or prevent EMI emitted by the electrical component 115 from interfering with other electronic or electrica! components (not shown) externa! to the apparatus 100. The apparatus 100 can be used with a wide range of electrical components, such as surface-mounted electronic components, electnanics packages, and integrated circuits of a printed circuit board, etc.<br>
[0040] As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the EMI gasket 104 generally indudes peripherai walls 124. While the illustrated EMI gasket 104 includes four peripheral walls 124 tn a generally rectangular confrguration, other embodiments can include an EMI gasket having more or less than four peripheral vralls and/or peripheral walls in a non-rectangular configuration (e.g., triangular, hexagonal, circular, etc.).<br>
 <br>
[0041] Each gasket wall 124 includes an inwardly extending shoulder 128. The shoulders 128 provide surfeces along which the carrier 112 can be disposed, attached, adhered, supported, etc. The shoulders 128 can allow for easier handling and assembly of the apparatus 100. Alternative embodiments provide combined low-profile EMI shielding and themnal management apparatus that do not include a separate earner. For example, FIGS. 9 through 12 illustrate an apparatus 200 in which a thermal interface 210 (e.g., thermally-conductive elastomer {which may be electrically conductive or non-conductive), etc) is provided directly on or to the heat sink 208. In such embodiments, the themnal interface 210 can be adhesively attached, dispensed via fonn-in-piace dispensing equipment, and/or molded (e.g., overmolded onto, etc.) to the heat sink 208. Also shown in FIGS. 9 through 12, the apparatus 200 further includes an EMI gasket 204 and a spring clip 214.<br>
[0042] Refening back to FIGS. 1 and 2, the EMI gasket 104 also includes a relatively open upper surface or window 156. The EMI gasket 104 is configured such that the lower edges 129 of the walls 124 are generally straight. The edges 129 can provide suitable surfaces for contacting and abutting against the board 120, vsrtiereby such contact or abutment can ground the apparatus 100 to the board 120.<br>
[0043] A wide range of materials can be used for the EMI gasket 104, which are preferably resiliently compressible. In one preferred embodiment, the EMI gasket 104 is molded from an electrically-conductive elastomer. Alternatively, the EMI gasket 104 can be formed from other materials and/or with other manufacturing processes. By way of example, other embodiments include an EMI gasket fomied from sheet metal or wire mesh.<br>
[0044] In various preferred embodiments, the EMI gasket 104 can also be made of one or more materials having sufficient resiliency or flexibility to pennit the EMI gasket 104 to be deflected at least partially against ground traces 115 (FIG. 4) of the board 120. This deflection can help reduce (and, in some cases, eliminate) any gaps between the EMI gasket 104 and the board 120 after installation of the spring clip  114. This,  in turn,  can  inhibit<br>
 <br>
electromagnetic eneigy from passing through or leaking out through the interface between the EMI gasket 104 and the board 120.<br>
f0045] in various embodiments, the EMI gasket 104 is formed of a material that allows for compression or deflection of the EMI gasket 104 between about twenty percent and about fifty percent of the gasket's free or uncompressed height. In some embodiments, the design of the EMI gasket 104 can be fonned to have the inherent or built-in ability to handle assembly tolerances. AHemativeiy, other suitable configurations {e.g., shapes, sizes, etc), materials, and manufacfairing methods can be used for making the EMI gasket 104.<br>
[0046] The apparatus 100 further includes the heat sink 108. This heat sink 108 can help dissipate, remove, and/or spread heat generated by the electrical component 116. in addition, the heat sink 108 can also operate in cooperation vwth ttie EMI gasket 104 to provide shielding for the electrical component 116.<br>
[0047] As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, a portion of the heat sink 108 can be disposed generally over the interposed thermal interface 110 and the EMI gasket 104. Accordingly, the heat sink 108 and/or themial interface 110 ran flinction as a lid for covering the window 156 of the EMI gasket 104. In tiiis exemplary manner, the EM! gasket 104 and the heat sink 108 and/or thermal interface 110 can cooperatively provide EMI shielding for the eiectricai component 116 over which the apparatus 100 is disposed.<br>
[0048] in the illustrated embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the heat sink 108 comprises a heat pipe having a generally hollow interior, which is preferably filled with fluid. In some embodiments, the heat pipe may also include relatively fine grooves along the inner surface thereof. Alternatively, other configurations are possible for the heat sink 108. For example, ttie heat sink 108 may comprise a piece of generally flat sheet metal. Further heat sink embodiments can include a heat dissipation surface integrally formed with another component of the apparatus, where the heat dissipation surface extends outwardly away from the EMI gasket vralls. Further embodiments can include solid heat sinks andfor heat sink structures having other shapes and sizes.<br>
 <br>
[0049] The heat sink 108 can be formed from a wide variety of materials via various manufacturing methods. Preferably, the heat sink material(s) are good themial conductors, and, in some embodiments, also good EMI shielding materials. In various embodiments, the heat sink 108 can be integrally or monolithically formed as a single component structure by bending or folding a piece of sheet metal. Altematively, other exemplary manufacturing methods and materials can be used for the heat sink 108, such as beryllium copper alloys, aluminum, brass, phosphor bronze, etc. !n some embodiments, the heat sink 108 may comprise bare or uncoated metal. In some other embodiments, the heat sink 108 may comprise a metal coated vmth a suitable electrically-conducfive plating to provide galvanic compatibility with the EMI gasket 104.<br>
[0050] FIGS. 5 through 8 illustrate an exemplary spring clip 114 that can be used in the apparatus 100. Spring clip 114 can be configured for providing the mechanical or clamping force for low thermal impedance. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the spring dip 114 can be configured for compressively biasing the heat sink 108 generally tovirards the board 120. in this exemplary manner, the spring clip 114 can help create and maintain sufficient ojntad for providing the apparatus 100 with low themial impedance and good heat dissipation capacity,<br>
[0051] In some embodiments, the biasing force applied by the installed spring clip 114 can also help hold the heat sink 108 down fintily against the EMI gasket walls 124 and/or against the themial interfece 110. This, in turn, can help reduce (and, in some cases, eliminate) any gaps between the various components, such as gaps between the EMI gasket 104 and the board 120 and gaps between the EMI gasket 104 and the heat sink 108. Accordingly, the damping force applied by the installed spring clip 114 can help inhibit electromagnetic energy from passing into or leaking out of the interior defined within the EMI gasket walls 124.<br>
[0052] With continued reference to FIGS. 5 through 8, the illustrated spring clip 114 indudes a connecting member 130 and resilient legs 132 depending downwardly and outwardly from the connecting member 130. The legs 132 have feet or engagement portions 136. The feet 136 are configured to resiliently engage or clip under a lower surface 121 of the board 120 (FIG.<br>
 <br>
3B).As shown, the lower surface 121 comprises the bottom of the board 120 (but this is not required).<br>
[0053] In the particular illustrated embodiment (FIG. 3B), the board 120 includes holes or openings 127 configured to receive therethrough the spring clip's feet 136. After the feet 136 are positioned through the holes 127, the feet 136 may then engage the board's lower surface 121. Alternatively, the apparatus 100 may also be used with boards that do not have any such openings or holes 127. in such alternative embodimente, the spring clip's engagement members or feet can be configured to be positioned generally around the sides of the board (instead of through holes in the board) to thereby engage the board's underside or lower surface 121.<br>
[0054] The resilient engagement of the spring clip's feet 136 with the lower suri'ace 121 of the board 120 can flex, deflect and/or defonn the connecting member 13D. In ttiis particular ennbodiment, the connecting manber 130 is resiliently biased into a first generally concave configuration (FIG. 7). But the connecting member 130 can be resiliently flexed, deflected and/or deformed into a second generally flat configuration (FIGS. 3 and 4). This flexing of the resiliently biased connecting member 130 can create a clamping force that is applied generally between the board 120 and the connecting member 130.<br>
[0055] As shown in FIG. 7, the connecting member 130 has a generally concave or U-shaped profile when the spring clip's feel 136 are not engaged to the board 120. In addition, FIG. 5 illustrates the upper surface of the connecting member 130 as being generally rectangular with two semicircular cutout portions 138 and 140. In some embodiments, the semicircuSaT cutout portions 13B and 140 can be configured (e.g., shaped, sized, positioned, etc.) for enhandng flexibility of the legs 132 and/or flexibility of the connecting member 130. Alternatively, other configurations (e.g., shapes, sizes, etc.) are possible for the connecting member 130.<br>
[0D5&amp;] Witfi continued reference to FIG. 7, the spring clip's legs 132 depend or extend outwardly at a slant relative to the connecting member 130. This generally outward tapering or flaring allovre the legs 132 to become vertical and spaced to line up vwth the board at the proper locations when the connecting member 130 is flexed from its first generally concave configuration<br>
 <br>
into the second generally flat configuration. Alternative spring clip embodiments can include one or more legs extending or depending generally straight down or perpendicular relative to the member 130 or that extend inwardly relative to the member 130. In addition, further embodiments can include a spring dtp having more or less than four legs and/or one or more legs having a different configuration (e.g., shape, size, etc.).<br>
[0057] With continued reference to FIGS. 5 through 8, the legs 132 have engagement members 136 comprising inward foot-like extensions with generally U-shaped transverse profiles. While the illustrated embodiment shows the feet 136 with generally U-shaped cross-secUons or transverse prafrles, other cross-sectional shapes (e.g., L-shaped, angularly truncated U-shaped, etc.) are also possible depending, for example, on the particular application in which the apparatus 100 will be used. For example, FIG. 13 illustrates a spring clip 314 having an alternative foot topology or configuration that is described in more detail below.<br>
[0058] Wrth reference back to FIG. 3B, after the feet 136 are engaged or clipped under the boarti 120 (FIG. 3B), the profile of the connecting member 130 has been changed, flexed, or deformed from ite generally concave inverted U-shaped profile (FIG. 7) to a more flat profile {FIG. 3). In various embodiments, the spring dtp 114 is fornied from a material having sufficient resiliency or springiness to pemiit tiie profile change of the connecting member 130 for allowing the legs 132 to be moved downwardly for positioning and clipping the feet 136 generally under the board 120, and then to respond with a sufficient restorative force (alter the feet 136 are disposed underneath the board 120) such that the spring dip 114 biases the heat sink 108 generally towards the EMI gasket 104, thermal interface 110, carrier 112, electrical component 116, and board 120 in the illustrated embodiment. In one particular embodiment, the spring clip 114 is formed from sheet metal having a thickness of about 0.20 millimeter. Alternatively, other suitable materials can be used for the spring clip 114.<br>
[0059] After the feet 136 have been engaged or clipped under the board 120 (FiG. 3), the resiliency or springiness of the spring clip 114 can thus apply a compressive biasing pressure forcing the heat sink 108 downward onto the thermal interface 110. Accordingly, this biasing pressure<br>
 <br>
applied by the spring dip's foot-like end portions 136 can help hold the heat sink 108 down firmly against the themial interface 110, thereby helping retain good themial contact between the heat sink 108 and thermal interface 110 and between the themnai interface 110 and the electrical component 116. In some embodimente, the biasing force applied by the spring clip's feet 136 (when engaged with the lower board surface 121) can also help hold the heat sink 108 down firmly against the EMI gasket walls 124. This, in turn, can help reduce any gaps between the EMI gasket 104 and the heat sink 108, thereby inhibiting electromagnetic energy from passing through or leaking out through the interface between the heat sink 108 and the EMI gasket 104. Accordingly, the clamping force applied by the installed spring clip 114 can help inhibit electromagnetic energy from passing into or leaking out of the interior defined within the EMI gasket walls 124.<br>
[0060] In some embodiments, the lower surfaces 170 of the spring clip's tegs 132 can also operate as cam surfaces. In such embodiments, contact between the curved lower surfaces 170 of the spring clip legs 132 and the board 120 can urge the legs 132 generally outwards. This, in turn, can allow the leg end portions 136 to slide generally through the holes 127 and/or generally over sides of the board 120. After the feet 136 clear the lower board surface 121, the feet 136 may then spring generally inwardly to thereby engage or interlock with the lower surface 121 of the board 120.<br>
[0061] In the illustrated embodiment of FIGS. 1 through 4, the apparatus 100 includes the thennal interface 110 disposed between the heat sink 108 and electrical component 116. The thermal interface 110 can comprise one or more separate layers disposed on the electrical component 116 and/or one or more separate layers disposed on the lower surface 164 of the heat sink 108.<br>
[0062] A wide variety of materials can be used for the thermal interface 110. In one preferred embodiment, the thermal interfece 110 comprises molded thermally-conductive elastomer. The thernially-conductive elastomer can be electrically conductive, or it can also be electrically non-conductive, (n some embodiments, the thermal interfece 110 is formed from ceramic or metal particle filled elastomer materials. Alternative embodiments can   include  a  thennal   interface  formed  from  ceramic  particles,  ferrite<br>
 <br>
electromagnetic interference/radio frequency interference (EMI/RFI) absorbing materials, metal, fiberglass meshes in a base of rubber, gel, grease, or wax, etc. Alternative embodiments can provide an apparatus that does not include a separate thermal interfetce 110. In such embodiments, the heat sink can make direct physical contact with and abut against the one or more electrical or electronic components over which the apparatus is disposed.<br>
[0063] in order to liirther illustrate various aspects and possible advantages thereof, the following example is given for purposes of illustration only and not for purposes of limitation, in this particular example, the components are configured to have the following height dimensions when the spring clip 114 is undipped from the board 120: a board 120 having a height of about 1 millimeter, an electrical component 116 having a heiglit of about 0.55 millimeters, a heat sink 108 having a height of about 1.3 millimeters (or about 0.2 millimeter when formed with a generally flat piece of sheet metal), a thenmal interface 110 having a height of about 0.13 millimeters, an EMI gasket 104 having a height of about 1.0 millimeter, and a spring clip 114 having a sheet metal thickness of about 0.20 millimeters. Continuing with this example, and after the spring clip 114 has been installed wiUi Its ^et 136 engaged or clipped under the lower board surface 121, the overall (compressively reduced) height above the board 120 can be about 2.3 millimeters (or about 1.2 millimeters when the heat sink 108 is formed with a generally flat piece of sheet metal). Alternatively, lower overall heights can be achieved depending, for example, on the deflection needs for the EMI gasket 104 and on the height of the electrical component 116. In addition, the installed spring clip 114 in the above example can apply a clamping force of about 130 Newtons or 30 pounds, which in some embodiments may be sufficient for fecilitating thennal pad wet-out or elimination (or at least reduction) of air gaps for providing efficient heat transfer. This clamping force can be distributed between the EM! gasket 104 and the thermal interface 110. The dimensions and other numerical values provided in this paragraph (as are all dimensions and numerical values set forth herein) are for purposes of illustration only, as the apparatus and components thereof ran be configured with different dimensions   and/or   for   providing   operational   parameters   with   different<br>
 <br>
iiuKieiiuai values aepenaing, Tor example, on the particular application, such as the component(s) to be shielded, space considerations vw'thin the overall apparaUjs, EMI shielding and heat dissipation needs, and other factors. For example, the material and thickness used for the spring dip 114 can be varied to change the amount of ciamping force applied by the installed spring clip 114 to the apparatus 100. By way of example, a spring clip may be configured for applying about 0.14 Megapascal or 20 pounds per square inch of pressure to the thermal interface, which in some embodiments may be generally sufficient for good thermal performance. Or, for example, a spring clip 114 can be configured for applying a force of about 24 Newtons or 5.5 pounds per square inch to the thermal interfece, when the apparatus is being used with an electrical component 116 that is 12 millimeters by 12 millimeters. In addition, various embodiments can provide assemblies having EMI shielding performance of about one hundred decibels at ten gigahertz and with about fifty percent compression of the EMI gasket 104 relative to the EMI gasket's free height.<br>
[0064] For example, FIG. 13 illustrates a spring clip 314 having an alternative foot topology or configuration, which is described in more detail below. In this particular example, the spring clip 314 again include legs 332 depending from a connecting member 330 having a generally concave or U-shaped profile virfien the spring clip's feet 336 are not engaged to a board.<br>
[0065] In this illustrated embodiment, however, the spring clip's feet 336 are configured to be inserted through holes in a board, and then be slidabiy moved relative to the board in order to capture and engage the board generally between upper and lower shoulder portions or stops 337A, 337B of the spring clip 330. With the board captured and engaged generally between the upper and lower shoulder portions 337A and 337B, the spring clip 314 can be resiliently flexed, deflected and/or defonned from the generally concave configuration shown in FIG. 13 to a more generally flat configuration. This flexing of the resiliently biased connecting member 330 can create a damping force that is applied generally between the board and the connecting member 330.<br>
[0066] In one particular embodiment, the spring clip 314 is formed from sheet metal such that the feet 336 are generally flat and hook-shaped as<br>
 <br>
shown in FIG. 13. Altemativeiy, other materials, shapes, and configurations can also be used for the spring clip 314.<br>
[0067] Advantageously, various embodiments can thus allow cost savings to a customer/manufactufer. This is because a customer/manufacturer can purchase a combined EMI shielding and thermal management apparatus (e.g., as a kit, etc.) instead of purchasing separate apparatus to respectively provide EMI shielding and to provide thennal management.<br>
[0068] In addition, various embodiments can provide for EMI shielding and thennal management of reiativeiy small electrical components and circuit boand layouts, such as the electronic components and circuft board layouts associated with cellular telephones and other wireless/RF devices. As eiectnsnic component and layouts are decreasing in size, various embodiments are able to help meet the needs of increasing heat dissipation from such small electronic components and layouts.<br>
