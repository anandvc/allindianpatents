BAYER    AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,    a    company    of    Germany,    of   D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>

Polyamines which contain urea-group a PROCESS for the preparation thereof and their use no hardeners for epoxide resins<br>
The present invention provides polyamines which contain urea groups, a process for the preparation thereof and their use to produce adhesives, sealants, embedding compounds, moulded items or coatings.<br><br>
              Polyamine/epoxide resin systems are characterised, inter alia, by excellent adhesion to<br>
10	metals, very good resistance to chemicals and outstanding corrosion prevention   properties. In the case of solvent-containing formulations and powder coating systems, cross-linked films with high flexibility are obtained by using epoxide resins with high molecular weights and/or polyaminoamides, e.g. those based on dimeric fatty acids, as hardeners. Coatings based on solvent-free liquid resins and solvent-free amino hardeners are brittle due to the low molecular weights of the epoxide <br>
15        resins and the high network density resulting there from. Nowadays, therefore,                    tar substitutes, e.g. coumarone resins, are used for plasticising purposes in solvent-free formulations. These types of coating tend to become brittle in the long term, in particular when using relatively large amounts of hydrocarbon resins, due to migration of the non-functional constituents.<br><br>
20<br><br>
     Good and permanent elastification of epoxide resins can be achieved by combining them with polyurethanes. Thus, e.g. in DE-A 23 38 256, high molecular weight amine-terminated polyetherurethane ureas are prepared by reacting prepolymers which contain free isocyanate groups with amines in highly dilute solution and then <br>
25           curing the product with epoxide resins.<br>
                 The use of the, in particular aromatic, solvents required for this is a disadvantage in practice, both from an industrial and also a physiological point of view. On the other hand, the viscosity of the solvent-free reaction products, such as those prepared in accordance with DE-A 23 38 256, is too high for use in practice.<br><br><br>

J*<br>
            DE-A 24 18 041  describes a process for preparing excised moulded articles and<br>
   two-dimensional structures in which epoxide and amine compounds are reacted<br>
which are obtained by hydrolysis of prepolymeric ketimines or enamines. Using this<br>
process, thermoset materials which are resistant to chemicals, adhere well and have<br>
5     improved properties are obtained. However, the process described is costly from a<br>
technical point of view.<br><br><br><br>
DE-A 21 52 606 describes reactive systems based on alkylphenol-blocked polyisocyanates and polyamines, which may optionally also be cured in combination with epoxide resins. These reactive systems are also associated with some technical disadvantages: on the one hand, the blocking agents being released have comparatively low molecular weight so they migrate out of the coating over the course of time, which can lead to adhesion problems. On the other hand, reactive systems based on alkylphenol-blocked polyisocyanates and polyamines have a relatively high viscosity and the actual mechanical properties of the end products do not satisfy all requirements.<br>
In contrast to this, EP-A 480 139 describes a process for reacting non-blocked NCO prepolymers with polyamines at temperatures of 140-170°C. However, this process can be applied only to prepolymers with aliphatic or cycloaliphatic isocyanate groups due to the very high reactivity of aromatic isocyanate groups when reacting with amines. Since aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates can be prepared only in a more costly manner (more expensively) than aromatic isocyanates, polyurethanurea amines prepared by this method have hitherto been of no industrial significance.<br>
In order to facilitate targeted reaction of polyisocyanate prepolymers with excess amounts of diamine, it has therefore been suggested on several occasions that the polyisocyanates be used in a blocked form, as described for instance, in CA-A 12 19 986, EP-A 293 110 or EP-A 82 983. These publications disclose using, as preferred blocking agents, phenols or substituted phenols. After completion of reaction with the polyamines, these phenols cannot be removed, or not completely removed, from<br><br>
3<br><br>
Le A33-696 –Foreign  Countries<br>
the reaction mixture by distillation, due to their high boiling point. Retention of these optionally substituted phenols in the mixture or in the plastic materials, however, leads to the disadvantages mentioned above. Furthermore, it is pointed out in these publications' that in principle the other conventional blocking agents from poly-<br>
5	       urethane chemistry may also be used, e.g. oximes, caprolactam, malonates and acetoacetates. However, since none of these blocking agents can be incorporated into the polymer structure during the course of epoxide hardening, these types of compounds are not normally used in traditional amine/epoxide chemistry. The use of such blocking agents instead of the preferably used, optionally substituted, phenols, <br>
10          does not provide significant advantages.<br>
In accordance with EP-A 457 089, on the other hand, secondary amines with preferably low boiling points are used as blocking agents. If these amines are retained in the reaction mixture after de-blocking, slow evaporation of the very<br>
15          pungent compounds (odour pollution) readily takes place. Although in principle the secondary amine can be incorporated into the system when used in epoxide systems, this takes place relatively slowly, especially in the case of applications at low temperatures (e.g. room temperature) so that some of the amines evaporate before reacting. In a particularly preferred application, the amine blocking agent is distilled<br>
20     out of the reaction mixture after de-blocking. Although this procedure leads to products which do not release a gas (odour pollution), it is very costly.<br>
            Thus, the object of the invention was to provide elasticising, amine hardener<br>
              mixtures for epoxides which do not have the disadvantages of the systems in the<br>
25"	prior art.<br>
The object can be achieved by the provision of the hardener mixtures according to the invention and the process for preparing them which are described in detail below.<br><br>
30<br><br>
The invention provides urea group-containing, amine hardener mixtures for epoxide resins, prepared by reacting<br><br>

~4<br>
A)       a polyisocyanate component, consisting of at least one organic polyiso-<br>
cyanate, in which at least 95 mol.% of the NCO groups are reversibly blocked<br>
by reaction with at least one phenolic group-containing hydrocarbon resin<br>

B)       at least one organic polyamine in a ratio by equivalents of amine groups to blocked NCO groups of 2:1 to 50:1.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing these urea group-containing, amine hardener mixtures.<br><br>
The invention also provides the use of these urea group-containing, amine hardener<br>
15	mixtures in combination with the epoxide resins conventionally used in plastics and<br>
coating technology, optionally in combination with catalysts, auxiliary substances and additives conventionally used in plastics and coating technology, to prepare adhesives, sealants, embedding agents, moulded items or coatings.<br>
20        The invention is based on the surprising observation that reactive systems based on urea group-containing, amine hardener mixtures according to the invention and epoxides cure to give plastics materials which are characterised by long-term elastification with a surprisingly beneficial relationship between plasticity on the one hand and elasticity on the other hand.<br>

large excess of the di- and polyisocyanates mentioned followed by removal of the<br>
     excess polyisocyanate, e.g. by thin layer distillation. Aromatic polyisocyanates with a<br>
      molecular weight in the range 174 to 300 are particularly preferably used to<br>

Polytetramethylene glycol polyethers corresponding to the data given above, such as can be obtained in a manner known per se by cationic polymerisation of tetrahydro-furan, are also preferably suitable for preparing the prepolymers.<br>
5          Also suitable for preparing the prepolymers are hydroxyl group-containing polycarbonates corresponding to the data given above, such as can be prepared, for example, by reacting simple diols of the type mentioned above with diaryl carbonates such as, for example, diphenyl carbonate or phosgene.<br>
10        Polythioetherpolyols, such as can be obtained, for example, by the polycondensation of thiodiglycol with itself or with diols and/or polyols of the type mentioned, are also suitable for preparing NCO group-containing prepolymers.<br>

15        polyols of the type mentioned, such as can be obtained, for example, by using acid catalysts such as phosphoric acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid are also suitable.<br>
Obviously, mixtures of the hydroxyl compounds mentioned by way of example may also be used to prepare the prepolymers.<br>
20<br>
Particularly preferred polyisocyanates for part A) for preparing urea group-containing amine hardener mixtures are prepolymers based on aromatic polyisocyanates and polyetherpolyols of the type mentioned previously.<br>
25	Suitable phenolic OH group-containing hydrocarbon resins which are used according<br>
to the invention for preparing the blocked polyisocyanates used as part A) are those<br>
of a generally known type such as are described, for example, in Ullmanns Encyklo-<br>
padie der technischen Chemie, 4th edition, vol.  12, pages 539 to 545, (Verlag<br>
     Chemie, Weinheim 1976), Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd<br>
30           ed., vol. 12, pages 852 to 869 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1980) or Encyclopedia<br>
of Polymer Science and Engineering, vol. 7, pages 758 to 782 (John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br><br><br>
Le A 33 696-Foreign Countries<br>
New York 1987). Examples of suitable phenolic OH group-containing hydrocarbon resins are coumarone/indene resins, petroleum resins or terpene resins.<br>
           These types of phenolic OH group-containing hydrocarbon resins are typically <br>
5        prepared by the copolymerisation of unsaturated hydrocarbons of the previously mentioned type with phenol in the presence of strong acids or catalysts of the Friedel-Crafts type. Suitable unsaturated hydrocarbons for preparing OH functional hydrocarbon resins which can be used according to the invention are the hydrocarbons produced during the cracking of naphtha or gas oil such as, for example,<br>
10     butene, butadiene, pentene, piperylene, isoprene, cyclopentadienea, styrene, oc-methyl-styrene, vinyltoluene, dicyclopentadiene, methyldicyclopentadiene, indene and methylindene. Terpene resins such as, for example, oc-pinene, p-pinene, dipentene, D-limonene or turpentine are also suitable as unsaturated hydrocarbons which can be used to prepare OH-functional hydrocarbon resins which can be used according to<br>
15      the invention. Hydrocarbon resins which can be used have a hydroxyl group content, calculated as OH (molecular weight = 17), of 0.1 % to 10.0 % and preferably have a hydroxyl group content of 1.0 % to 6.0 %. Hydrocarbon resins with a hydroxyl group content of 1.5 % to 4.0 % and which are liquid at room temperature are particularly preferably used to prepare part A).<br>
20-<br><br>
                 Polyisocyanates with reversibly blocked isocyanate groups which are suitable for use<br>
as part A) according to the invention are prepared by reacting organic polyiso-<br>
cyanates of the previously mentioned type at temperatures of 40°C to 150°C,<br>
preferably 50°C to 100°C with phenolic OH group-containing hydrocarbon resins as <br>
25	 characterised in more detail previously. The amount of phenolic OH group-con<br>
taining hydrocarbon resin used in the blocking reaction should correspond to at least<br>
95 mol.% of the amount of NCO groups. Often, a small excess of blocking agent is<br>
expedient in order to ensure complete reaction of all the isocyanate groups. The<br>
excess is generally not more than 20 mol.%, preferably not more than 15 mol.% and<br>
30 	in particular not more than 10 mol.%, with respect to the isocyanate groups.<br>

         The blocking reaction is preferably performed with the additional use of catalysts<br>
known per se from polyurethane chemistry such as, for example, organometallic<br>
compounds such as tin(II) octoate, dibutyltin(II) diacetate, dibutyltin(II) dilaurate or<br>
+ertiary amines such as triethylamine or diazabicyclooctane. The blocking reaction<br>

as, for example, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, methoxypropyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, toluene, xylene, aromatic or (cyclo) aliphatic hydrocarbon mixtures or any mixture of these types of solvents. These conversions are preferably performed in a solvent-free manner.<br>
10<br>
Part B) for preparing the urea group-containing amine hardener mixture according to the invention quite generally consists of polyamines which may optionally also contain secondary amine groups.<br>
15	Polyamines which contain at least two primary amine groups per molecule are<br>
preferably used.<br>
Particularly preferably, polyamines which contain at least two primary amine groups per molecule and have a (mean) molecular weight of 60 to 500 are used. Suitable <br>
20	  compounds are, for example, ethylene diamine, 1,2- and 1,3-diaminopropane, 1,4-  diaminobutane, 1,6-diaminohexane, 2,2,4- and/or 2,4,4-trimethylhexamethylene diamine, the isomeric xylylene diamines, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, 4,4'-diamino-dicyclohexylmethane, 1,3-diaminocyclopentane, 4,4'-diaminodicyclo-hexyl-sulfone, 4,4'-diaminodicylohexylpropane-l ,3, 4,4'-diaminodicyclo-hexylpropane-2;2, 3,3'- <br>
25 dimethyl-4,4'-diaminodicyclohexylmethane, 3-aminomethyl-3,3,5-trimethyl-cyco- hexylamine (isophorone diamine), 3(4)-aminomethyl-l-methylcyclohexylamine or technical grade bisaminomethyltricyclodecane, such as is sold under the name TCD-Diamin® by Hoechst AG or also those polyamines which contain secondary amine groups in addition to at least two primary amine groups such as for example<br>
30<br>
diethylene triamine or triethylene tetramine.<br>
10<br><br>
Le A 33 696-Foreign Countries<br>
Quite specifically preferred is the use of polyamines, in particular diamines with molecular weights in the range mentioned above, which contain one or more cyclo-aliphatic rings. These include, for example, 1,4-diaminooyclohexane, 4,4'-diamino-dicyclohexylmethane, 1,3-diaminocyclopentane, 4,4'-diamino-dicyclohexyl-sulfone,<br>
5  4,4'-diaminodicyclohexylpropane-l,3, 4,4'-diaminodicyclo-hexylpropane-2,2, 3,3'-  dimethyl-4,4'-diaminodicyclohexylmethane, 3-aminomethyl-3,3,5-trimethyl-cyclo-hexylamine (isophorone diamine), 3(4)-aminomethyl-l-methylcyclohexylamine or technical grade bisaminomethyltricyclodecane.<br>

epoxide resins of the type mentioned below can also be used as part B).<br>
     Furthermore, polyethearamines which are prepared by reacting polyetherpolyols with ammonia and are sold, for example, by Huntsman under the tradename Jeffamin® can <br>
15      also be used as part B).<br>
Furthermore, polyamide resins are also suitable as part B). These types of polyamide resins, which mclude polyaminoamides and polyaminoimidazolines, are sold, inter alia, by Henkel under the tradename "Versamid®".<br>
20<br>
Obviously, it is also possible to use mixtures of the polyamines mentioned as part B).<br>
        The urea group-containing amine hardener mixtures according, to the invention are      prepared by reacting component (A) with component (B) at temperatures up to <br>
25      200°C, preferably at temperatures of 10°C to 200°C, in particular at temperatures of 40°C to 150°C and quite specifically at temperatures of 50°C to 100°C.<br>
The reaction may optionally be catalysed. Suitable catalysts are preferably com     pounds which contain basic nitrogen atoms. Tertiary amines, Mannich bases and <br>
30            amidines may be mentioned as suitable.<br>

Urea group-containing amine hardener mixtures according to the invention are prepared by adding part A) and part B) in amounts such that the ratio by equivalents of amine groups to blocked isocyanate groups is 2:1 to 50:1, preferably 3.5:1 to 25:1, in particular 5:1 to 15:1.<br>
5<br>
      Urea group-containing amine hardener mixtures according to the invention may be prepared, if required, in conventional lacquer solvents of the type mentioned above. Preparation is preferably performed, however, in a solvent-free manner.<br>
10      Urea group-containing amine hardener mixtures according to the invention may be prepared in a separate reactor from that used for the synthesis of A), but are preferably prepared immediately following the synthesis of A), in the same reactor.<br>
        Hardener mixtures according to the invention are liquid compounds with a H  <br>
15	equivalent of 20 to 10,000, preferably 40 to 3,000 and in particular 50 to 500. They are preferably suitable as a hardener in combination with the epoxide resins conventionally used in plastics and coating technology, optionally in combination with the catalysts, auxiliary substances and additives conventionally used in plastics and coating technology, to   produce coatings, adhesives, sealants, embedding  <br>
20     compounds or moulded parts.<br>
Epoxide resins conventionally used in plastics and coating technology are oxirane group-containing compounds which contain on average more than one epoxide group per molecule. Examples of suitable epoxide resins are glycidyl ethers of polyhydric <br>
 25 alcohols, such as e.g. butanediol, hexanediol, glycerol, TMP, hydrogenated diphenylolpropane or polyhydric phenols such as e.g. resorcinol, diphenylolpropane-2,2 (bisphenol A), diphenylolmethane (bisphenol F) or phenol/aldehyde condensates. Glycidyl esters of polybasic carboxylic acids, such as hexahydrophthalic acid or dimerised fatty acids may also be used.<br><br><br><br>

The use of liquid epoxide resins based on epichlorhydrin and diphenylolpropane-2,2 (bisphenol A) or diphenylolmethane (bisphenol F) or their mixtures is particularly preferred. If desired, the viscosity of the mixtures may be reduced with mono-functional epoxide compounds, which means that processing is improved. Examples <br>
 5   of these are aliphatic and aromatic glycidyl ethers such as butyl glycidyl ether, phenyl glycidyl ether or glycidyl esters such as glycidyl versatate or epoxides such as styrene oxide or 1,2-epoxydodecahe.<br>
In the urea group-containing amine hardener mixtures according to the invention, the <br>
10   H equivalent of the hardener and the oxirane group equivalent of the epoxide resin are preferably present in a ratio of 0.8:1 to 1.4:1, in particular in a ratio of 0.9:1 to 1.2:1 and quite specifically in aratio of 0.95:1 to 1.1:1.<br>
To prepare coatings, adhesives, sealants, embedding compounds or moulded items, <br>
15	auxiliary agents and additives conventionally used in plastics and coating technology such as, for example,. fillers, solvents, flow control agents, pigments, reaction accelerators or viscosity regulators may optionally be incorporated into the mixture of urea group-containing amine hardener mixture and epoxide resin. Reaction accelerators such as salicylic acid, bis-(dimethylaminomethyl)-phenol or tris-(dimethyl<br>
20   amino-methyl)-phenol, fillers such as sands, crushed rocks, silicas, asbestos dust, kaolin, talcum, metal powders, tar, tar pitch, asphalt, scrap cork, polyamides, plasticisers such as for example phthalates or other viscosity regulators such as for example benzyl alcohol may be mentioned by way of example.<br>
25   Cured plastics based on the urea group-containing amine hardener mixtures according to the invention and epoxide resins are characterised, in contrast to the prior art, by long-term elastification with a surprisingly favourable ratio between plasticity on the one hand and elasticity on the other hand.<br>

epoxide resins are particularly highly suitable for all applications where good adhesion, resistance to chemicals, and high impact strength and impact resistance, associated with good flexibility and elasticity, are required over the long term.<br>
5     Systems according to the invention are particularly highly suitable as corrosion prevention coatings. In particular when subjected to aggressive media, such as for example in. the case of ballast tanks, the systems are characterised by good wet adhesion and good adhesion under cathode protection conditions.<br>
10       Depending on the range of requirements, the properties of the urea group-containing amine hardener mixtures can be adjusted. If particularly flexible and elastic materials are required, the urea group-containing amine hardener mixture according to the invention is prepared from a large amount of part A) and a small amount of part B). If highly cross-linked, materials which are resistant to chemicals are required, the<br>
