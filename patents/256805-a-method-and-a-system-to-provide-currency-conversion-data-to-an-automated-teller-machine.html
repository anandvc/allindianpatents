ATM MACHINE AND METHODS WITH<br>
CURRENCY CONVERSION CAPABILITIES<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/580,985,<br>
filed June 17, 2004, and 60/588,169, filed July 14,2004, and claims the benefit of U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 11/	,	, filed June 15, 2005, the complete disclosures of which are<br>
herein incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) are used by customers to conveniently perform<br>
transactions related to financial accounts. One of the most common transaction involves the<br>
withdrawal of money from a checking or savings account. The customer enters the desired<br>
withdrawal amount and if the transaction is approved, receives the requested amount. The<br>
withdrawal amount is deducted from the customer's account. ATM's may also be used for<br>
credit card transactions and credit card cash advances, money transfers, payments (e.g.,<br>
payment of a bill, such as a cellular phone bill or other bill), balance inquiries, item purchase<br>
items (e.g., stamps), electronic purse transactions, and other types of transactions involving<br>
the making and receiving of payments.<br>
[0003] ATM transactions are conducted using the native currency of the ATM. Thus, an<br>
ATM located in the United States conducts transactions in U.S. dollars, while an ATM<br>
located in France conducts transactions in Euros. If the customer is using an ATM located in<br>
the same country as the customer, the transaction amounts (e.g., the withdrawal amount) are<br>
presumably well understood by the customer. However, in instances in which a customer is<br>
using an ATM in a foreign country, the customer often does not know how the ATM's native<br>
currency corresponds to the customer's native currency amount. Additionally, the exchange<br>
rate that will be used to perform the settlement on the transaction is not known to the<br>
customer. Even if the customer can make an educated guess about the exchange rate, the<br>
conversion must be performed manually by the customer. Thus, a customer usually does not<br>
know the exact amount of the transaction in the customer's native currency (e.g., the<br><br>
withdrawal amount deducted from his or her account) until a statement is received from the<br>
financial institution.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0004] Methods, systems, and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) are disclosed which<br>
provide ATM currency conversion capabilities. In one embodiment, a financial account<br>
number associated with a financial account maintained by a customer at a financial institution<br>
is received at an ATM. A foreign currency type associated with the financial account is<br>
determined and a choice is presented to the customer at the ATM to conduct a financial<br>
transaction in the foreign currency type. A currency selection is received from the customer.<br>
At least a portion of the financial transaction at the ATM is conducted in the selected<br>
currency.<br>
[0005] In some instances, the foreign currency type associated with the financial account<br>
may be determined by obtaining an identifier portion of the financial account number (e.g.,<br>
the bank identification number (BIN) portion). The country associated with the financial<br>
account may be determined using the identifier portion. By way of example, the identifier<br>
portion may be compared to a lookup table associating financial institution identification<br>
numbers to a country. Other methods of determining foreign currency type may also be used.<br>
[0006] The currency selection received may be a selection indicating the foreign currency<br>
type. In one embodiment, the transaction may be a withdrawal, and conducting at least a<br>
portion of the financial transaction may comprise receiving a withdrawal amount in the<br>
foreign currency type. The method may then further comprise obtaining an exchange rate to<br>
convert the foreign currency type to a native currency type associated with the ATM and<br>
converting the withdrawal amount to the native currency type.<br>
[0007] Alternately, conducting at least a portion of the financial transaction may comprise<br>
receiving a withdrawal amount in a native currency type associated with the ATM. The<br>
exchange rate to convert the native currency type to the foreign currency type is obtained and<br>
the withdrawal amount is converted to the foreign currency type. The converted withdrawal<br>
amount is displayed to the customer.<br>
[0008] In a second embodiment, a method is disclosed which comprises receiving, at an<br>
ATM network, a request from an ATM to obtain a currency exchange rate from a first<br><br>
currency to a second currency. The currency exchange rate is obtained and provided to the<br>
ATM. The method may also further comprise receiving an identifier from the ATM<br>
identifying a financial institution associated with a financial account, using the identifier to<br>
determine a currency type associated with the financial account, and providing the currency<br>
type to the ATM.<br>
[0009] In a third embodiment, a system to provide currency conversion information to an<br>
ATM is disclosed. The system may comprise an interface, communicatively coupled to an<br>
ATM, data, and logic, communicatively coupled to the interface and the data. The interface<br>
is configured to receive an identifier portion of a financial account from an ATM. The data<br>
associates financial institution identification numbers to at least one of a country and a<br>
currency. The logic determines a currency type associated with the financial account using<br>
the data and the interface transmits the currency exchange rate to the ATM.<br>
[0010] fn a fourth embodiment, an ATM is disclosed. The ATM comprises a user interface<br>
to receive a financial transaction selection from a customer. The user interface also receives<br>
a selection from the customer to conduct a transaction in a foreign currency type different<br>
than a native currency type associated with the ATM. Logic processes at least a part of the<br>
financial transaction in the foreign currency.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0018] In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific<br>
details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It<br>
will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced<br>
without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices<br>
are shown in block diagram form.<br>
[0019] FIG. 1 illustrates a system that may be used to provide currency conversion<br>
capabilities in an ATM. The system includes ATMs 102,104. ATM 102 has a direct<br>
communication coupling to ATM network 108, while ATM 104 is communicatively coupled<br>
to ATM network 108 via a server at a financial institution 106 associated with the ATM 104.<br>
The ATM network 108 may be used to obtain information and authorization for an ATM 102,<br>
104 to perform transactions requested by a customer of the ATM 102, 104. Thus, ATM<br>
network 108 is able to communicate with a financial institution 110 associated with the ATM<br>
customer's financial account. By way of example, ATM network 108 may be a network, such<br>
as the NYCE® network, the Pulse® network, the STAR® network, and the like. ATM<br>
network 108 may be used to verify a customer's authentication information (e.g., financial<br>
account and personal identification number (PIN)) and to provide authorization to an ATM<br>
102, 104 to perform a transaction, such as a withdrawal of funds from a financial account or a<br>
transfer of funds from a first financial account to a second financial account. ATM network<br>
108 may also be used to obtain information on the customer's financial account, such as the<br>
account balance. The information and authorization may be provided directly to some ATMs<br>
102 and may be provided to other ATMs 104 via a financial msfitution server 106. In some<br>
instances, the customer's financial account may be maintained at the financial institution 106<br>
associated with the ATM 104. In these instances, financial institution 106 may provide the<br>
authorization and other information needed by the ATM 104 without using ATM network<br>
108. It should be appreciated that the system may include many more ATMs 102,104 and<br>
financial institutions 106,110 than illustrated in FIG. 1.<br><br>
[0020] ATM network 108 is communicatively coupled to Currency Recognition and<br>
Exchange Service 112. Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 may be a service<br>
that is used to provide information on a currency associated with an ATM customer's<br>
financial account. Additionally, Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 may be<br>
used to provide exchange rates to an ATM 102,104 via ATM network 108. In some<br>
embodiments, Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 may be used to provide<br>
currency exchange information for more than one ATM network 108. Alternately, Currency<br>
Recognition and Exchange Service 112 may be a component of ATM network 108. In some<br>
embodiments, Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 may provide the currency<br>
and exchange information dynamically. For instance, the information may be provided when<br>
it is requested by financial institution 106 or ATM network 108 on behalf of ATM 102, 104.<br>
Alternately, Currency Recognition and Exchange Sex-vice 112 may periodically provide<br>
currency recognition and exchange information to a server residing on ATM network 108,<br>
ATM 102/104, and/or financial institutions 106, 110. By way of example, the information<br>
may be transferred as one or more files using file transfer protocol (ftp). The file transfer<br>
may be initiated by either the Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 or at the<br>
initiative of the component on the system receiving the files (e.g., financial institution 106,<br>
server on ATM network, etc.).<br>
[0021] FIG. 2 illustrates a second exemplary communication coupling between financial<br>
institution 106 and Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112. hi this embodiment,<br>
financial institution 106 is communicatively coupled to Currency Recognition and Exchange<br>
Service 112 via a communications network 202, such as a wide area network (WAN). Thus,<br>
financial institution 106 may obtain currency recognition and exchange rate information from<br>
Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 without using ATM network 108. As<br>
previously described, financial institution 106 may obtain the information dynamically, as<br>
requested by ATM 104, or may locally store information which is periodically transmitted to<br>
the financial institution 106 from Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 (e.g., via<br>
ftp file(s)).<br>
[0022] It should be appreciated that various other configurations than those illustrated in<br>
FIGs. 1 and 2 may be used to provide currency recognition information and exchange<br>
information to ATMs 102,104. For instance, either or both ATMs 102, 104 may be in direct<br>
communications with Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112. Alternately,<br>
Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 may be a component of ATM 102,104 or<br><br>
may be software executing on a financial institution server 106, 110. In these embodiments,<br>
Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 may periodically obtain exchange rate<br>
information and currency recognition information from one or more sources of this<br>
information.<br>
[0023] FIG. 3 illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a Currency Recognition and<br>
Exchange Service 112. Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 includes a<br>
communications interface 302. Communications interface may be communicatively coupled<br>
to a server residing on ATM network 108, one or more financial institutions 106, 110 and/or<br>
one or more ATMs 102, 104. In some embodiments, Currency Recognition and Exchange<br>
Service 112 may be used to provide currency recognition and/or exchange information to an<br>
ATM 102, 104 at the request of another component, such as ATM network 108 or financial<br>
institution 106. Alternately, the information may be provided directly to an ATM 102,104.<br>
As will be described in further detail below, interface 302 may be used to receive financial<br>
institution identifier portions of financial account identifiers and to communicate a<br>
determined currency associated with the financial account. Interface 302 may also further be<br>
used to communicate exchange rates to convert from a first currency to a second currency.<br>
[0024] Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 further includes logic 304,<br>
identifier lookup table 306, and exchange rate information 308. Logic 304 is<br>
communicatively coupled to interface 302, identifier lookup table 306, and exchange rate<br>
information 308. By way of example, logic 304 may be machine-executable instructions,<br>
such as a software program. Logic 304 may be used to determine a currency type associated<br>
with a financial account using data, such as identifier lookup table 306. Additionally, logic<br>
304 may be used to determine exchange rates by using the exchange rate information 308.<br>
[0025] Identifier lookup table 306 and exchange rate information 308 may be stored in one<br>
or more databases. The database(s) may be any type of structure that may be used to store<br>
information, such as relational databases, internal software lists, text files, spreadsheet files,<br>
and the like. Identifier lookup table 306 may contain information associating financial<br>
institution identification numbers (e.g., BINs) with a country and/or currency. Other unique<br>
identification numbers, such as the ATM card number or customer's financial account may<br>
also or alternately be associated with a country and/or currency. Exchange rate information<br>
308 may store information on exchange rates that may be used to convert from a first<br>
currency to a second currency. In embodiments in which the lookup table maps financial<br><br>
institution identification numbers to a country, additional information may be stored which<br>
maps countries to currencies. In some embodiments, the identifier lookup table 306 may map<br>
a range of financial institution identification numbers to a country and/or currency. In these<br>
embodiments, the information in the database(s) may further include an exception table (not<br>
shown) to map financial institution identification numbers to a currency and/or country<br>
different than the one indicated in the associated range of the lookup table.<br>
[0026] In the configuration described above, different components were described as being<br>
communicatively coupled to other components. A communicative coupling is a coupling that<br>
allows communication between the components. This coupling may be by means of a bus,<br>
cable, network, wireless mechanism, program code call (e.g., modular or procedural call) or<br>
other mechanism that allows communication between the components. Thus, it should be<br>
appreciated that logic 304, identifier lookup table 306, and exchange rate information 308<br>
may reside on the same or different physical devices. It should also be appreciated that in<br>
alternate embodiments, Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 may contain<br>
additional or fewer components than illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
[0027] As previously described, in alternate embodiments, currency recognition<br>
information, such as identifier lookup table 306, and exchange rate information 308 may be<br>
periodically provided to a server residing on ATM network 108, financial institution 106,<br>
and/or ATMs 102, 104. For instance, files may be periodically transferred or otherwise made<br>
available to one or more of these components 108,106,102,104. It should be appreciated<br>
that in these embodiments, appropriate logic (e.g., program code) may also reside on the<br>
component 108, 106, 104, and/or 102 having the currency recognition and exchange<br>
information. The component logic may function similar to logic 304 and may use the<br>
transferred data to perform currency recognition and provide exchange rate information at the<br>
request of an ATM 102, 104, or additional logic resident to the ATM 102, 104.<br>
[0028] FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary block diagram of an ATM 102 that may be used to<br>
provide currency conversion information to customers. ATM 102 includes a user interface<br>
400. User interface 400 may comprise multiple components, such as card reader 402, display<br>
404, keypad 406, and printer 408. Card reader 402 may be used to receive a customer's ATM<br>
card and obtain a financial account number from the ATM card. Display 404 may be used to<br>
prompt the customer for responses needed to perform a transaction and to display information<br>
to the customer. Keypad 406 may be used to receive input from the customer, such as a<br><br>
personal identification number (PIN) associated with the customer's financial account,<br>
transaction selections, dollar amounts for transactions (if applicable), and other information<br>
related to a customer's transaction with the ATM. Additionally, as will be described in<br>
further detail below, display 404 may be used to display a currency type selection for the<br>
transaction and keypad 406 may be used to receive the customer's currency type selection.<br>
User interface 400 may also include a printer 408 that may be used to print a receipt of the<br>
transaction, and in some embodiments, the customer's remaining account balance.<br>
[0029] ATM 102 may further include logic 410 and communications interface 412. Logic<br>
410 may be used to process a financial transaction requested by a customer of the ATM 102.<br>
By way of example, the financial transaction may be a withdrawal request, a balance transfer<br>
request, a deposit request, a purchase request (e.g.,. to purchase stamps, telephone calling<br>
cards, etc. using funds available in the customer's financial account), or other type of request<br>
that may be performed at an ATM. Logic 410 may receive information from user interface<br>
400 and use coinmunications interface 412 to communicate with ATM network 108.<br>
[0030] Communications interface 412 is communicatively coupled to a server on ATM<br>
network 108. Logic 410 may use communications interface 412 to request authentication of<br>
a customer's financial account number received from user interface 400. Li some<br>
embodiments, the authentication request transmitted to the ATM network 108 may also<br>
include a PIN which was received from the customer. Additionally, logic 410 may use<br>
communications interface 412 to request authorization of a transaction initiated by the<br>
customer. Other information used to perform a financial transaction may also be requested<br>
and received using communications interface 412.<br>
[0031] As will be described in further detail below, logic 410 may also be used to process<br>
at least a part of a financial transaction requested by the customer in a foreign currency which<br>
is associated with the customer's financial account and different from a native currency<br>
associated with the ATM 102. For instance, logic 410 may prompt the customer to select<br>
either the native currency associated with the ATM 102 or a foreign currency type which was<br>
determined to be associated with the customer's financial account (the customer's native<br>
currency). If the user selects the foreign currency type, logic 410 may use communications<br>
interface 412 to obtain exchange rate information. Exchange rate information may be<br>
provided by Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 via ATM network 108, ATM<br>
network 108, or from information accessible to ATM 102. In an alternate embodiment, the<br><br>
information may be stored locally at ATM 102. Logic 410 may use the exchange rate<br>
information to convert from the native currency to the foreign currency and display details of<br>
the transaction (e.g., withdrawal amount or other financial amounts) in the currency which is<br>
foreign to the ATM, but native to the customer. Alternately, logic 410 may not be provided<br>
with exchange rate information and may instead use communications interface 412 to obtain<br>
converted transaction amounts.<br>
[0032] The above description described an ATM 102 that communicates with an ATM<br>
network 108 to obtain authentication, authorization, and other transaction information. It<br>
should be appreciated that in alternate embodiments, communications interface 412 may<br>
communicate with a financial institution 106 to obtain information used to process a<br>
transaction, including currency recognition information and exchange rate information. It<br>
should also be appreciated that in alternate embodiments, ATM 102 may comprise fewer or<br>
additional components than described above. For instance, user interface 400 may not<br>
include a keypad 406, but instead may include a touch pad to receive information from a<br>
customer.<br>
[0033] FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method that may be used to<br>
conduct a transaction at an ATM . The method may begin when a customer inserts 500 an<br>
ATM card (e.g., debit card, credit card) into a card reader. The card reader obtains a financial<br>
account identifier associated with a financial account maintained by the customer at a<br>
financial institution from the ATM card. The customer may also provide 502 a PTN<br>
associated with the financial account.<br>
[0034] The ATM may then transmit 504 one or more packet(s) to an ATM network 108 or<br>
a financial institution 106 associated with the ATM to authenticate the financial account<br>
identifier and PIN. Additionally, the ATM may also request financial account currency<br>
information for a currency type associated with the customer's financial account. The ATM<br>
may include this request in the authentication packet or may submit a second packet<br>
requesting the currency type information. Alternately, the currency type information may be<br>
provided to the ATM by either ATM network 108 or associated financial institution 106<br>
without an explicit request from the ATM.<br>
[0035] The customer's account identifier and PIN are then authenticated. If the ATM<br>
request was sent to a financial institution 106 associated with the ATM, the authentication<br>
may be performed by the financial institution 106 if the customer's financial account is<br><br>
maintained at the same or affiliated financial institution. Otherwise, ATM network 108 may<br>
be used to perform the authentication by communicating with the customer's financial<br>
institution 110 to authenticate the customer's financial account and associated PIN.<br>
[0036] Additionally, ATM network 108 or financial institution 106 may determine a<br>
currency type associated with the financial account. The determination may be made by<br>
transmitting a request to a Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 or by accessing<br>
currency type information stored locally or otherwise made available to ATM network<br>
108/fmancial mstitution 106. By way of example, an identifier lookup table 306 may be used<br>
to match a financial institution identifier portion (e.g., BIN) of the financial account to a<br>
currency type or country. In some embodiments, an exception table may also be consulted to<br>
determine whether an exception exists to the mapping rules in the lookup table for the<br>
customer's financial account. For instance, the financial institution identifier portion may fall<br>
in a range of identifiers normally assigned to U.S. financial institutions, but the particular<br>
identifier may be an exception and be assigned to a Canadian financial institution.<br>
[0037] The ATM network 108 or associated financial institution 106 then provides 506 the<br>
authentication and currency type information to the ATM. This information may be provided<br>
in one or more transmittal packets. In some instances, the customer account information may<br>
not be authenticated, either because of an invalid PTN, account inacfivation, or other problem.<br>
In these instances, the ATM network 108 or financial institution 106 may only transmit a<br>
rejection of the authentication information without associated currency type and the method<br>
may end with a notification provided to the customer that the account information could not<br>
be authenticated. In some embodiments, a determination of currency type may not be made<br>
until after the account information provided by the customer has been authenticated.<br>
[0038] If 508 the currency type associated with the customer's financial account is the same<br>
as the ATM's native currency, the ATM may proceed 512 with the customer transaction using<br>
the native ATM currency type. Otherwise, if the customer account is associated with a<br>
foreign currency type different from the ATM's native currency type, the customer may be<br>
presented 510 with a currency selection choice. For instance, if the customer's financial<br>
account is maintained in the United States, but the customer is using an ATM in Great<br>
Britain, the ATM may present 510 the customer a choice to conduct the transaction in Great<br>
Britain Pounds (the ATM's native currency) or U.S. Dollars.<br><br>
[0039] If 514 the customer does not select the foreign currency, the ATM proceeds 512<br>
with the customer transaction using the native ATM currency. Otherwise, if the foreign<br>
currency is selected, at least a part of the customer's transaction at the ATM is conducted in<br>
the foreign currency. This process will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 6, which<br>
illustrates a withdrawal transaction. However, as will be appreciated, other types of<br>
transactions may also be conducted using the foreign currency.<br>
[0040] In alternate embodiments, the process of conducting a financial transaction at an<br>
ATM may be different than described in reference to FIG. 5. For example, the customer may<br>
provide the financial account identifier to the ATM in a manner different than by inserting<br>
500 a card into a card reader. By way of example, the customer may enter the financial<br>
account identifier using a keypad or other mechanism. As another example, in alternate<br>
embodiments, the ATM may not request 504 currency type information, but instead may<br>
itself determine the currency type associated with the financial account by accessing<br>
information local to the ATM or otherwise made available to the ATM. As a third example,<br>
currency type information may not be requested 504 or provided 506 to the ATM, but instead<br>
the customer may be presented with a variety of predetermined choices for the currency type<br>
to use to conduct a financial transaction. It should also be appreciated that in alternate<br>
embodiments, the method of performing a financial transaction at an ATM may not include<br>
all the blocks illustrated in FIG. 5. For instance, the customer may not be presented with a<br>
currency selection choice 510, but instead the transaction may be automatically conducted in<br>
the foreign currency type.<br>
[0041] Referring to FIG. 6, a method of conducting a financial transaction in a foreign<br>
currency type different than the ATM's native currency type will now be described. FIG. 6<br>
illustrates an exemplary withdrawal transaction, including credit card withdrawals. However,<br>
with minor modifications that may easily be made, the principles of the method may be<br>
applied to other types of financial transactions conducted at an ATM, such as balance<br>
inquiries, transfer of funds, purchases made at the ATM (e.g., for stamps, telephone calling<br>
cards, etc.), bill payment, electronic purse transactions, or other types of transactions that may<br>
be performed at an ATM.<br>
[0042] The method may begin by the customer requesting 600 a withdrawal transaction be<br>
performed at the ATM. If the customer account information has not been authenticated, a<br>
method similar to that described with reference to FIG. 5 may be performed with the<br><br>
customer selecting 514 to at least partially conduct the financial transaction in a foreign<br>
currency type different than the ATM's native currency type. The ATM may then receive<br>
602 a withdrawal amount from the customer in the foreign currency. For example, a<br>
customer at an ATM located in Great Britain may enter a withdrawal amount in U.S. Dollars.<br>
[0043] The ATM may then obtain 504 an exchange rate to convert from the foreign<br>
currency to the native currency. The exchange rate may be obtained from an ATM network<br>
108, a financial institution 106 associated with the ATM, Currency Recognition and<br>
Exchange Service 112, or exchange rate information stored locally or otherwise accessible to<br>
ATM. As previously described, in some embodiments, exchange rate information may be<br>
obtained by ATM network 108 or financial institution 106 from Currency Recognition and<br>
Exchange Service 112.<br>
[0044] After the exchange rate has been obtained 604, the ATM may the convert 606 the<br>
withdrawal amount to the ATM's native currency. Alternately, the ATM may provide the<br>
withdrawal amount to ATM network 108, financial institution 106, or Currency Recognition<br>
and Exchange Service 112 and the conversion may be performed by one of these components<br>
108, 106, 112. By way of example, ATM network 108 or financial institution 106 may<br>
obtain the exchange rate from Currency Recognition and Exchange Service 112 or from<br>
locally stored or otherwise accessible information, perform the conversion, and provide the<br>
converted amount to the ATM or the conversion may be performed by Currency Recognition<br>
and Exchange Service 112.<br>
[0045] The converted withdrawal amount is then displayed 608 or otherwise presented to<br>
the customer. Optionally, the exchange rate used to perform the conversion may also be<br>
displayed 610 or provided to the customer. In some embodiments, the conversion 606 may<br>
result in a withdrawal amount that is not supported by the ATM. For instance, the conversion<br>
may result in denominations that may not be withdrawn from the ATM (e.g., withdrawal of<br>
change, or smaller bills). In these embodiments, the converted withdrawal amount may be<br>
modified to a denomination supported by the ATM. The modification may be made by<br>
rounding to the nearest denomination, rounding to the next highest supported denomination,<br>
or rounding down to the next lowest supported denomination. Thus, the modified withdrawal<br>
amount may be presented 608 instead of or in addition to the initially converted amount.<br>
Alternately, the customer may be presented with a choice to select whether to increase the<br>
withdrawal amount (round up) or decrease the withdrawal amount (round down). In some<br><br>
embodiments, the modified withdrawal amount may be converted to the foreign currency<br>
type (the customer's native currency) and displayed or otherwise provided to the customer so<br>
that the customer is made aware of the exact corresponding transaction amount in the<br>
customer's native currency. This information may be presented to the customer as part of the<br>
presentation of the modified converted withdrawal amount, or may be provided to assist the<br>
customer in making the choice whether to increase or decrease the amount.<br>
[0046] After being presented 608 with the converted withdrawal amount, which may have<br>
been modified from the initial conversion amount, the customer may then be asked to<br>
confirm 612 that he or she wants to proceed with the transaction. If the customer does not<br>
wish to proceed after the information has been presented, the transaction may be canceled<br>
614 or the customer may be presented with a choice to enter a different withdrawal amount<br>
602. Otherwise, the method may proceed with authorization 616 of the withdrawal amount.<br>
[0047] After the withdrawal amount has been authorized 616, the funds are provided to the<br>
customer 618. Optionally, the customer may also be provided with a receipt 620. The<br>
receipt may indicate one or more transaction details, such as the ATM native currency<br>
amount withdrawn, the corresponding foreign currency amount (the customer's native<br>
currency), and the exchange rate used. In some embodiments, the receipt may also contain<br>
the customer's current account balance in the customer's native currency after the funds were<br>
withdrawn.<br>
[0048] Although the customer has concluded his or her interaction with the ATM, at some<br>
point in time, a settlement may need to be performed 622 to transfer funds from the financial<br>
institution at which the customer maintains the financial account and the financial institution<br>
or other entity responsible for providing the funds to the customer via the ATM.<br>
[0049] It should be appreciated that the method of conducting a withdrawal transaction<br>
may be performed differently than illustrated in FIG. 6. For instance, the customer may not<br>
be prompted to confirm the withdrawal amount. Alternately or additionally, the withdrawal<br>
amount may be converted to the native currency as part of the authorization 616 process. As<br>
another example, in other embodiments, the ATM may receive 602 the withdrawal amount<br>
from the customer in the ATM's native currency and the withdrawal amount may be<br>
converted to the foreign currency. The customer may then be asked to confirm the amount or<br>
the ATM may only display the foreign currency amount (and possibly the exchange rate)<br><br>
using a display and/or on a receipt provided to the customer. Other variations are also<br>
contemplated.<br>
[0050] In the foregoing description, for the purposes of illustration, methods were<br>
described in a particular order. It should be appreciated that in alternate embodiments, the<br>
methods may be performed in a different order than that described. It should also be<br>
appreciated that the methods described above may be performed by hardware components or<br>
may be embodied in sequences of machine-executable instructions, which may be used to<br>
cause a machine, such as a general-purpose or special-purpose processor or logic circuits<br>
programmed with the instructions to perform the methods. These machine-executable<br>
instructions may be stored on one or more machine readable mediums, such as CD-ROMs or<br>
other type of optical disks, floppy diskettes, ROMs, RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic<br>
or optical cards, flash memory, or other types of machine-readable mediums suitable for<br>
storing electronic instructions. Alternatively, the methods may be performed by a<br>
combination of hardware, firmware, and software.<br>
[0051] While illustrative and presently preferred embodiments of the invention have been<br>
described in detail herein, it is to be understood that the inventive concepts may be otherwise<br>
variously embodied and employed, and that the appended claims are intended to be construed<br>
to include such variations, except as limited by the prior art.<br><br>
