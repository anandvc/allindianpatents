THERMALLY CONTROLLED PROCESS INTERFACE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to field devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to process interfaces between the field device and the process.<br>
Field devices, such as process variable transmitters, are used by a number of industries to remotely sense a process variable. Such variables are generally associated with fluids such as slurries, liquids, vapors, gases, chemicals, pulp, petroleum, pharmaceuticals, food, and other fluid processing plants. Process variables may include pressure, temperature, flow, turbidity, density, concentration, chemical compensation, and other properties. Other examples of field devices include valves, actuators, heaters, and controllers.<br>
Process variable transmitters are used to measure and provide accurate and reliable process measurements. One of the challenges in making accurate and reliable process measurements is maintaining the integrity of the process interface and the process medium itself. It is common for the process fluid to clog or solidify due to changing temperatures or changes in the state of the fluid itself leading to erroneous measurements and potentially unsafe process conditions.<br><br>
The use of thermal control systems in industrial process control and measurement is known. For example, high purity vacuum transducers often have an internal thermal control system to maintain the entire device at a selected temperature in order to increase accuracy and/or longevity of the device. Additionally, some field devices employ a thermal control system disposed proximate a primary element in order to ensure that the element is maintained at a desired temperature. For example, it is known for pitot tubes to be heated such that they do not accumulate ice in measuring air velocity during flight.<br>
Additionally, some have employed a number of external means and methods to apply thermal control systems to field devices. These techniques generally employ electrical heat elements or steam tracing but are difficult to install, have poor temperature measurement and control, and are costly and troublesome to maintain. These devices are "addon" designs that are typically attached externally to the connection hardware or measurement instrument itself. While prior approaches have generally addressed some thermal issues of the instrument modules and primary elements themselves, the process interface element has not been utilized for such uses. Installations with thermal control elements added-on to the process interface element require additional control systems,  additional installation<br><br>
time and expense. Further, such systems are more susceptible to failure since they are exposed to the elements. Thus, there is a need for field devices having process interface elements with more integral thermal control systems. Such field devices would provide the advantages of thermal control of the process interface less expensively and more robustly.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A field device is coupled to a process through at least one process interface element. The process interface element may be a field device flange, a manifold, impulse tubing or a process flange. The process interface element has a temperature sensor attached thereto, and is adapted to receive a thermal source. In one embodiment, the source is one or more electrical heaters. In another embodiment, the thermal source is heat transfer fluid tracing through the process interface element. A controller is coupled to the temperature sensor and is adapted to control the heat applied to the process interface element based upon the temperature of the process interface element measured by the temperature sensor.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying and drawings. The drawings and description provide specific examples, or "embodiments," of how the invention may be made or used, or "practiced." The scope of the invention includes these specific examples, and other examples, and should not be limited to the examples described<br><br>
here. Other examples are contemplated and will fall within the scope of the invention even if they are developed after the disclosed examples. Changes can be made to the described embodiments without departing from the spirit of the scope of the protected invention, which is defined by the appended claims.<br>
FIG. 1 shows generally one example of an environment of a process measurement system 32. FIG. 1 shows process piping 30 containing a fluid under pressure coupled to the process measurement system 32 for measuring a process pressure. The process measurement system 32 includes impulse piping 34 connected to the piping 30. The impulse piping 34 is connected to a process pressure transmitter 36. A primary element 33, such as an orifice plate, venturi tube, flow nozzle, and so on, contacts the process fluid at a location in the process piping 30 between the pipes of the impulse piping 34. The primary element 33 causes a pressure change in the fluid as it passes past the primary element 33.<br>
Transmitter 36 is a process measurement device that receives process pressures through the impulse piping 34. The transmitter 36 senses the process pressures and converts it to a standardized transmission signal that is a function of the process pressure. Transmitters can also sense multiple process variables or can be configured to provide process   control   functions.   In   the   example,<br><br>
transmitter   3 6   is   a   differential   pressure transmitter. FIG. 1 shows the transmitter configured to measure flow.  Other uses of the transmitter for differential pressure measurement  are,  of  course, contemplated.<br>
A process loop 38 facilitates both a power signal  to the  transmitters  3 6  and bi-directional communication, and can be constructed in accordance with a number of process communication protocols.  In the illustrated example, the process loop 38 is a two-wire loop.  A two-wire loop, as the name implies, uses  only two wires  to electrically  connect  the transmitter 36 to a remote control room 40.  The two-wire loop is used to transmit all power to and all communications to and from the transmitter 36 during normal   operations   with   a   4-20   mA   signal. Accordingly, the transmitter 36 as illustrated often is referred to as a 'utwo-wire transmitter," although other configurations,  such as three-wire and four-wire  transmitters,  and  so  on,  are  known  and contemplated.  Communication can be performed with a<br>
4-2 0 mA analog signal, and the open protocol HART® or<br>
FOUNDATION™ Fieldbus digital protocol. The transmitter 36 can be configured for use with other process protocols, including Device Bus, Sensor Bus, Profibus, Ethernet, and others in use throughout the world. A computer 42 or other information handling system, through modem 44 or other network interface, is used for communication with the transmitter 36.  A<br><br>
remote voltage power supply 46 typically powers the transmitter 36.<br>
FIG. 2 shows an exploded view of the example transmitter 36. Field device flange 50 is attached to a sensor module 52 to interface with impulse piping 34, The sensor module 52 includes a threaded housing 53 that is an all welded design to isolate internal components from the process medium and the field environment. A process pressure is applied to the sensor module 52. A pressure sensor (not shown) disposed within module 52, isolated mechanically, electrically, and thermally from the process medium receives the process pressures and provides an analog electrical signal representative of differential pressures.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagrammatic view of one embodiment of the present invention. System 10 0 includes a process interface element 102 having an electrical heating element 104 disposed therein and thermally coupled thereto. A temperature sensitive device 106 is thermally coupled to process interface element 102 and electrically coupled to controller 108. Controller 108 is further coupled to electrical switch 110 via control line 112.<br>
Process interface element 102 may be any interface element that couples, at least in part, a process device to the process. Process interface elements include, but are not limited to, a manifold, a process flange, impulse piping, a secondary fill<br><br>
system (such as a remote seal) and/or a field device flange.    Switch  110  is  coupled to a  source  of electrical power via lines 114 and can selectively pass  power  to  thermal  source  104  based  upon energization of control line 112 from controller 108. Thermal source 104 can be any electric device which can change temperature in response to energization. Thus,  source 104 can be an electric heater, or a device that cools in response to energization, such as a known Peltier device. Preferably, source 104 is an electric heating element configuration that  is suitable for use with a process interface element. For example,  source 104 may include one or more cartridge heaters disposed within suitable recesses inside process interface element 102.  Additionally, other types of electrical heaters, such as etched-foil heaters could be incorporated into the design and manufacture of process interface element 102. Those skilled in the art will recognize other forms of  electrical  heating  that  may be  suitable  for heating process interface element 102.<br>
Temperature sensor 106 can be any suitable device that provides an electrical parameter that varies with the temperature of process interface element 102. Accordingly, sensor 106 may be a thermocouple, a resistance temperature device (RTD), a thermistor, or any other suitable device. Preferably, sensor 106 is disposed within process interface element 102.   One example of sensor 106<br><br>
being disposed within process interface element 102 includes sensor 106 being a RTD probe disposed within a suitably sized recess within process interface element 102.<br>
Controller 108 includes logic and/or circuitry that can relate a suitable control signal provided on line 112 to a temperature sensor signal provided from temperature sensor 106 using a suitable control strategy- Controller 108 preferably includes a microprocessor as well as suitable input and output circuitry for receiving the input signal and for generating the output signal. For example, where temperature sensor 106 is an RTD, controller 108 may include suitable circuitry to drive a small current through the RTD and measure an associated voltage developed across the RTD. In one embodiment, controller 10 8 may be the controller of the field device to which the thermal control system 100 is coupled. For example, in embodiments where the process variable transmitter is a pressure transmitter having a microprocessor therein, controller 108 may be provided by the microprocessor within the process variable transmitter. However, in other embodiments, both controller 108 and switch 110 may be an additional add-on module for maintaining independent temperature control of the process interface element 102. In other embodiments, this controller 108 and switch 110 may be integral with -the process interface element 102.<br><br>
FIG. 4 is a diagrammatic view of process interface thermal control system 120 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  Control system 120 includes a number of components similar to control system 100, and like components are numbered similarly.   Control system 120 differs from control system 100 in that control system 120 uses a thermal transfer  fluid,  such  as  steam,  to  control  the temperature  of  process  interface  element  102. Accordingly, switch 110 of system 100 is replaced by valve 122 in system 120.   Valve 122 is coupled to source  124  of  thermal  transfer  fluid.  Valve  122 selectively allows the thermal transfer fluid to flow through tracing 126 in process interface element 102 based upon energization of line 112 from controller 108.    The  heat  transfer  fluid  exiting  process interface  element  102  is  indicated  at  reference numeral  128  and  may  be  used  for  additional components, such as other process interface elements, may be drained,  or may be recovered.   As before, sensor 106 provides an indication of the temperature of process interface element 102 to controller 108 which selectively energizes valve 122 along line 112 to control the flow of thermal transfer fluid and thus control the temperature of process interface element 102.  Depending on the temperature of the thermal  transfer  fluid  relative  to  the  process interface,   flow  of  fluid  through  the  process interface may heat or cool the process interface.<br><br>
FIG. 5 is a diagrammatic view of process interface thermal control system 150. System 150 includes process interface element 102, which in this embodiment is a manifold 152 having a plurality of recesses 154 therein to receive cartridge heaters 156. Manifold 152 also has a recess 158 which receives temperature sensor 106. Switch 160 is coupled to a source of power via lines 162 and selectively energizes' cartridge heaters 156 with power from lines 162 based upon energization of control lines 112 from controller 108. Switch 16 0 may be any suitable device able to switch a relatively large . amount of power based upon a relatively smaller energization signal. For example, switch 160 may be a relay, a semiconductor switch, or any other suitable device. Manifold 152 includes mounting holes 162 and pressure conduits 164.<br>
Thermal  control  system  150  allows  the manifold  152  to  be  maintained . at  a  selected temperature  set  point  stored  in  controller  108. Accordingly, if sensor 106 indicates that the actual temperature of manifold 152 is below the set point, controller 108 will energize switch 160 along lines 112 in order to heat manifold 152 using cartridge heaters 156.  Any suitable control regime can be used including,   but  not  limited  to,   proportional, proportional-integral,  proportional-derivative,  and proportional-integral-derivative (PID).<br><br>
FIG. 6 is a diagrammatic view of process interface thermal control system 170 in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Manifold 172 of system 170 is similar to manifold 152, but includes thermal transfer fluid tracing 174 therein. Valve 176 is coupled to a source 178 of heat transfer fluid and selectively allows thermal transfer fluid to flow through tracing 174 and out port 18 0 based upon energization of control line (s) 112 from controller 108. As described in other embodiments, controller 108 generates the energization signal along lines 112 based upon the temperature measured by temperature sensor 106. As indicated in FIG. 6, temperature sensor 106 is preferably disposed relatively close to the thermal transfer fluid tracing 174. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 6, sensor 106 is actually disposed slightly above or below thermal transfer fluid tracing 174. Preferably, the thermal transfer fluid is steam, but may be any suitable fluid including liquids such as water, oil, or antifreeze.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagrammatic view of another type of process interface element 102. In this embodiment, process interface element 102 is a flange, such as a process or field device flange 182. Flange 182 includes thermal transfer fluid tracing 174 and a hole 184 disposed relatively close to the thermal  transfer fluid tracing 174.   Hole 184  is<br><br>
suitable for mounting a temperature sensor, such as temperature sensor 106.<br>
FIG. 8 is a perspective view of a process interface element 200 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Element 200 is a conduit that transmits a process pressure from the process, via a fluid within the conduit, to a pressure sensing device. One form of element 200 includes a modified impulse pipe 202. However, element 2 00 can also be a secondary fill system such as a remote seal. Impulse pipe 202 includes threads 204 for coupling to a process variable transmitter. Additionally, impulse pipe 2 02 has a thermal source 206 thermally coupled thereto. In the illustrated embodiment, thermal source 206 is an electrical heating element 2 08 disposed within a cover material that is bonded or otherwise affixed to pipe 20 2. A temperature sensor 210 is disposed to sense the temperature of pipe 202. Each of element 208 and sensor 210 include leadwires that are coupleable to the process device, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, such that the process device provides a thermal control function. For example, the process device may determine the temperature of impulse pipe 202 using the temperature sensor and apply a selected amount of energy to impulse pipe 20 2 using heating element 208. FIG. 8 merely shows one example of a thermally controlled impulse pipe. Other embodiments include impulse piping heated or cooled<br><br>
by steam tracing. In these embodiments, the field device provides a thermal control function such that an additional temperature controller is not required.<br>
Thermal control of the process interface provides a number of advantages. First, in applications where the process interface is operated near a freezing temperature of the process medium, providing a controlled source of heat ensures that the passageways from the interface to the pressure sensor module do not freeze. Further, even in applications where the temperature is not near the freezing point of the process medium, heating the process interface is believed to reduce the occurrence of solidification or clogging due to changing temperatures or changes in the state of the fluid . itself. Further, in embodiments where the process interface is controllably cooled, such cooling may help keep the temperature of the process medium proximate the interface below critical temperatures such as the boiling point of the process medium.<br>
In embodiments where the field device is able to receive a suitable amount of electrical power, it is conceivable that both the switch/valve and the controller may be incorporated as part of the field device. Further, in embodiments where the controller of the thermal control system is part of the field device, aspects of the thermal control, such as current process interface element temperature, and/or<br><br>
alarm conditions can be conveyed over the process control and measurement loop. Additionally, the controller can receive a new temperature set point for the thermal control system over the process control and measurement and loop, as desired.<br>
It is also expressly contemplated that the process interface element thermal control system may be wholly independent of the field device. Thus, the field device may operate on the relatively low power of a process control and measurement loop (e.g. 4-20 mA) while the thermal control system may employ 120 volt 6 0 Hz power. Further, in embodiments where the processors of the field device and thermal control system are separate, they may be coupled together to enable communication therebetween. While embodiments of the present invention have been described with respect to a single process interface element, it is expressly contemplated that the thermal control system may be applied to multiple process interface elements with respect to a single field device, or with respect to multiple field devices.<br>
Although the present  invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers  skilled  in  the  art  will  recognize  that changes may be made  in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
