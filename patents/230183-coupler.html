				<td>COUPLER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to couplers, and in particular to couplers<br>
having coupled sections separated by an uncoupled section,<br>
A pair of conductive lines are coupled when they are spaced apart, but<br>
spaced closely enough together for energy flowing in one to be induced in the<br>
other. The amount of energy flowing between the lines is related to the<br>
dielectric medium the conductors are in and the spacing between the lines. Even<br>
though electromagnetic fields surrounding the lines are theoretically infinite,<br>
lines are often referred to as being closely or tightly coupled, loosely coupled, or<br>
uncoupled, based on the relative amount of coupling.<br>
Couplers are electromagnetic devices formed to take advantage of<br>
coupled lines, and may have four ports, one for each end of two coupled lines. A<br>
main line has an input connected directly or indirectly to an input port. The other<br>
end is connected to the direct port. The other or auxiliary line extends between<br>
a coupled port and an isolated port. A coupler may be reversed, in which case<br>
the isolated port becomes the input port and the input port becomes the isolated<br>
port. Similarly, the coupled port and direct port have reversed designations.<br>
Directional couplers are four-port networks that may be simultaneously<br>
impedance matched at all ports. Power may flow from one or the other input<br>
port to the pair of output ports, and if the output ports are properly terminated,<br>
the ports of the input pair are isolated. A hybrid is generally assumed to divide<br>
its output power equally between the two outputs, whereas a directional<br>
coupler, as a more general term, may have unequal outputs. Often, the coupler<br>
has very weak coupling to the coupled output, which minimizes the insertion<br>
loss from the input to the main output. One measure of the quality of a<br>
directional coupler is its directivity, the ratio of the desired coupled output to the<br>
isolated port output.<br>
Adjacent parallel transmission lines couple both electrically<br>
and magnetically. The coupling is inherently proportional to<br>
frequency, and the directivity can be high if the magnetic<br>
and   electric   couplings   are   equal. Longer  coupling regions   increase<br><br>
the coupling between lines, until the vector sum of the Incremental couplings no<br>
longer increases, and the coupling will decrease with increasing electrical length In a<br>
sinusoidal fashion. In many applications it is desired to have a constant coupling<br>
over a wide band. Symmetrical couplers exhibit inherently a 90-degree phase<br>
difference between the coupled output ports, whereas asymmetrical couplers have<br>
phase differences that approach zero-degrees or 180-degrees.<br>
Unless ferrite or other high permeability materials are used, greater than<br>
octave bandwidths at higher frequencies are generally achieved through cascading<br>
couplers. In a uniform long coupler the coupling rolls off when the length exceeds<br>
one-quarter wavelength, and only an octave bandwidth is practical for +/- 0.3 dB<br>
coupling ripple. If three equal length couplers are connected as one long coupler,<br>
with the two outer sections being equal in coupling and much weaker than the<br>
center coupling, a wideband design results. At low frequencies all three couplings<br>
add. At higher frequencies the three sections can combine to give reduced coupling<br>
at the center frequency, where each coupler is one-quarter wavelength. This design<br>
may be extended to many sections to obtain a very large bandwidth.<br>
Two problems come from the cascaded coupler approach. One is that the<br>
coupler becomes very long and lossy, since its combined length is more than one-<br>
quarter wavelength long at the lowest band edge. Further, the coupling of the<br>
center section gets very tight, especially for 3 dB multi-octave couplers. A cascaded<br>
coupler of X:1 bandwidth is about X quarter wavelengths long at the high end of its<br>
range. As an alternative, the use of lumped, but generally higher loss, elements<br>
have been proposed.<br>
An asymmetrical coupler with a continuously increasing coupling that abruptly<br>
terminates at the end of the coupled region will behave differently from a<br>
symmetrical coupler. Instead of a constant 90-degree phase difference between the<br>
output ports, close to zero or 180 degrees phase difference can be realized. If only<br>
the magnitude of the coupling is important, this coupler can be shorter than a<br>
symmetric coupler for a given bandwidth, perhaps two-thirds or three-fourths the<br>
length.<br>
These couplers, other than lumped element versions, are designed using an<br>
analogy between stepped impedance couplers and transformers. As a result, the<br><br>
couplers are made in stepped sections that each have a length of one-fourth<br>
wavelength of a center design frequency, and are typically several sections long.<br>
The coupler sections may be combined into a smoothly varying coupler. This<br>
design theoretically raises the high frequency cutoff, but it does not reduce the<br>
length of the coupler.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a coupler having reduced length and,<br>
depending on the design, with low loss. This may be provided by a coupler<br>
including first and second conductive lines forming at least first and second<br>
coupled sections and an uncoupled section between the first and second<br>
coupled sections. The expression 'delay section' used in the following<br>
description has the same meaning as the expression "uncoupled section".<br>
Further embodiments of this structure may include additional alternating<br>
delay sections and coupled sections or coupled sections of unequal length. The<br>
delay sections may be formed of a delay loop in one or both lines. One line may<br>
be a mirror image of the other line. Further, the coupler may be designed to be<br>
symmetrical or asymmetrical.<br>
A coupler unit, which includes a coupled section and an adjacent delay<br>
section, has an effective electrical length equal to the sum of the electrical<br>
lengths of the two lines in the coupled section and the lengths of the lines in the<br>
delay section. The electrical length is defined as the line length divided by the<br>
wavelength of an operating frequency. In the case of a coupler in which only one<br>
line has a delay loop, the delay section has a length that equals the length of the<br>
space between the coupled sections plus the length of the delay loop.<br>
Each coupler unit is equivalent to a conventional quarter-wavelength<br>
coupler in which the sum of the line lengths making up the coupler unit is equal<br>
to one-half the wavelength of an operating frequency, such as the center<br>
frequency of a band of operating frequencies. It will be seen that this new<br>
coupler may have a very short electrical length, since the coupled section may<br>
be very short but tightly coupled and the delay section relatively long, but much<br>
shorter than one-half wavelength.<br><br>
It will also  be appreciated that particularly when the coupler of the<br>
invention is configured with a delay loop in only the auxiliary or second line, the<br>
main line has very low loss. The loss in the auxiliary line is greater due to the<br>
existence of the delay loop or loops.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention generally provides a coupler that has an effective electrical<br>
length that is greater than the combined lengths of the coupled lines. It has<br>
been found that when two very short couplers are connected in series, the<br>
resulting coupling is the vector sum of the two individual couplings. When the<br>
two couplers are separated by a length of line, the electrical length of that line is<br>
added to the coupler length, and the frequency response corresponds to that of<br>
a long coupler. An example of such a coupler made according to the invention is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1. The coupler, shown generally at 10, includes first and<br>
second conductive lines 12 and 14 formed into first and second spaced-apart<br>
coupled sections 16 and 18, and a delay section 20. Lines 12 and 14 may be<br>
formed as coplanar conductors on the face 22a of a dielectric substrate 22. In<br>
conventional microstrip structure, a ground plane 24 is formed on the back side<br>
of the substrate. Other structures, such as broadside-coupled lines, coplanar<br>
waveguides, slot lines, and coaxial lines, may also be used.<br><br>
First conductive main line 12, in this example, is rectilinear, extending<br>
from an Input end or port 12a and an output end or direct port 12b. Second<br>
conductive auxiliary line 14 has an end 14a functioning as a coupled port, and<br>
another end 14b functioning as the isolated port. It will be appreciated that the<br>
shape of the lines may be varied so long as there is coupling between the first<br>
and second lines in the first and second coupled sections.<br>
Delay section 20 includes an open delay loop 26 formed in line 14, and a<br>
straight portion 28 in line 12 that spans the space between the coupled sections.<br><br>
The tabs at the base of the delay loop, such as tab 29, are capacitors that<br>
compensate for inductance produced in the transitions between coupled sections<br>
and delay loops. The primary function of the delay section is to increase the<br>
electrical length of the coupler without significant coupling with line 12, thereby<br>
allowing the overall length of the coupler to be made shorter than a conventional<br>
coupler. The lines may be considered coupled if they are spaced apart less than the<br>
distance between the lines and the ground plane.  The electrical length of coupler<br>
10 is the sum of twice the lengthL1  of coupled section 16, plus the length L2 of<br>
uncoupled portion 28 opposite from delay loop 26, plus the length L3 of delay loop<br>
26. This corresponds to the path of an input signal reflected back to coupled port<br>
14a when the signal is reflected at the input end of coupled section 18. The<br>
coupling of the coupler is at a maximum when the two very short coupled sections<br>
16 and 18 are separated by a delay section that is about one quarter wavelength<br>
(actually 50 electrical degrees) long, as represented by the length L2 plus L3.<br>
Beyond that the coupling decreases until it becomes zero when the delay section is<br>
one-half wavelength long. Ideally, to produce high coupling, length L2 may be very<br>
short, the length of the delay loop may be about one quarter wavelength long, and<br>
coupled section 16 may be about one-eighth wavelength long.<br>
Coupler 10 is an asymmetrical directional coupler, since coupled sections 16<br>
and 18 have different lengths. In this example, coupled section 18 has a length L4<br>
that is longer than the length L1 of coupled section 16. This coupler has high<br>
directivity, and a frequency response quite close to that of a single long coupler,<br>
however with a very short total line length on the main side, and a much greater line<br>
length on the coupled or auxiliary side. The loss through the coupler on the main<br>
side is nearly the theoretical minimum for that coupling level, while the loss on the<br>
coupled side is greater than the theoretical, due to the loss in the additional delay<br>
loop between the short-coupled sections. In many applications this is a very<br>
desirable trade-off. Because the main line 12 is very short in this embodiment, it<br>
has substantially less dissipative loss than the auxiliary line 14.<br>
Coupler 10 may also be formed as a plurality of delay sections separated by<br>
coupled sections. An example is a coupler made according to a second embodiment<br>
of the invention, shown generally at 30 in FIG. 2. Coupler 30 represents a<br><br>
quadrature hybrid, symmetrical directional coupler with equal power split between a<br>
main line 32 and an auxiliary line 34. Main line 32 has corresponding ends 32a and<br>
32b forming an input port and a direct port, respectively. Auxiliary line 34 has ends<br>
34a and 34b that form a coupled port and an isolated port.<br>
Coupler 30 includes N coupler units, with each coupler unit including a<br>
coupled section and a delay section, where N is an integer. A first coupler unit 36<br>
includes a first coupled section 38 and a delay section 40. A second coupler unit 42<br>
includes a second coupled section 44 and a delay section 46. An Nth coupler unit 48<br>
includes an Nth coupled section 50 and a delay section 52. Each coupler unit may<br>
be considered a coupler with coupler 30 being a combination of these couplers.<br>
Each delay section includes an uncoupled portion associated with each line,<br>
such as loops 54 and 56 of lines 32 and 34, respectively, of delay section 40.   In<br>
this embodiment, the first and second lines share equally the length of the delay<br>
section. It will be appreciated that each coupler unit, except for the final one,<br>
includes the leading edge of the succeeding coupled section in order to provide for<br>
signal reflection at that point. Thus, there is an N+1 coupled section 58 associated<br>
with the final coupler unit 48. Stated alternatively, if there are N coupled sections,<br>
there are N-l delay sections.<br>
Coupler 30 is an example of a coupler in which the coupler units are identical,<br>
the coupled sections are equal in length and the delay loops are equal in length. As<br>
a result, coupler 30 is a quadrature hybrid, symmetrical directional coupler with<br>
equal power split between the direct port and the coupled port. This coupler, then,<br>
is equivalent to a coupler built entirely with uniformly coupled sections. All of the<br>
coupled sections may thus have about the same value of coupling. The length of the<br>
coupled sections may be adjusted to the desired coupling level for each equivalent<br>
portion of the coupler, and the delay loops may be adjusted in length to obtain the<br>
desired electrical length for each coupler section.<br>
Alternatively, a coupler may have coupled sections, delay sections, delay<br>
spanning portions, and delay portions of different lengths. When two non-identical<br>
short couplers are combined with a delay line, the coupling is not zero at one-half<br>
wavelength between the couplers, but is essentially at a minimum. The frequency<br>
response of the coupler then is third order, even though It uses only two coupled<br><br>
sections. Nearly two octaves of bandwidth can be achieved with this simple<br>
approach, still with very low main line loss.<br>
For increased bandwidth in conventional directional couplers more sections<br>
can be added in cascade or in tandem. In these couplers, the main line and the<br>
coupled line are preferably identical. The present invention may be used to provide a<br>
multi-section asymmetrical cascade coupler that may cover a decade bandwidth with<br>
low main line loss. This coupler consists of a number of short tightly coupled<br>
sections connected together in series on the main side, and with delay lines of<br>
optimum length on the coupled side.<br>
An example of such an asymmetrical directional coupler is shown generally at<br>
60 in FIGS. 3 and 4. Coupler 60 includes a main line 62 having corresponding ends<br>
62a and 62b forming an input port and a direct port, respectively. An auxiliary line<br>
64 has ends 64a and 64b that form a coupled port and an isolated port, respectively.<br>
As shown, the main line follows a rectilinear path and the auxiliary line follows a<br>
varied serpentine path to one side of the main line.<br>
More specifically, coupler 60 includes coupler units 66, 67, 68, 69 and 70<br>
having respective coupled sections 76, 77, 78,79 and 80 and delay sections 86, 87,<br>
88,89 and 90. A final coupled section 92 forms the sixth coupled section for the five<br>
coupler units, thereby providing a second coupled section for coupler unit 70. Delay<br>
sections 86, 87, 88,89 and 90 include associated delay loops 96, 97, 98, 99 and<br>
100.<br>
As shown in the cross section of FIG. 4, coupler 60 is formed as a broadside<br>
coupled structure. Conductive lines 62 and 64 are sandwiched between dielectric<br>
layers 102,104 and 106, which in turn are sandwiched between opposite ground<br>
plates 108 and 110. Line 62 is 100% offset from line 64 so that the two lines have<br>
only an edge in alignment between the ground plates. The ground plates are<br>
separated by a distance D1. It has been found that coupling between opposite<br>
portions of a delay loop is not significant when the opposite portions are separated<br>
by a distance D2 greater than or equal to distance D1.<br>
It is seen that the lengths of the delay loops and the coupled sections are<br>
different for different coupler units. An optimization program was used to determine<br>
the number of coupler units and the lengths of the coupled and delay sections for<br><br>
particular design criteria. Instead of varying the spacing between the lines to vary<br>
the cumulative coupling, the lengths of the coupled sections were varied. In one<br>
embodiment of coupler 60, the length L2 is equal to 0.25 inches for an operating<br>
frequency of about 2 GHz, which frequency also corresponds to an upper limit<br>
frequency of an operating band of 200 MHz to 2 GHz. Over the operating band, this<br>
coupler has at least 20 dB directivity and between -18dB and -20 dB coupling.<br>
The overall length of coupler 60 is about five inches. One wavelength at the<br>
high-end frequency of 2 GHz is about 8 inches. A conventional 10:1 coupler would<br>
have about ten quarter-wavelength sections, which would correspond to a total<br>
equivalent length of about 20 inches. It is therefore seen that this invention<br>
provides a significant reduction in overall length.<br>
It will also be apparent that the dissipative loss in the main line may be<br>
reduced as well. In the example just mentioned, the loss is less than 0.2 dB over<br>
the entire frequency band. This loss is about one third of the loss of a conventional<br>
design. For high power couplers where the coupling levels are very low, say -40 dB,<br>
the power savings in this approach are substantial, particularly for wideband<br>
couplers whose main line electrical length at the highest frequency of use can be<br>
less than one quarter wavelength, as compared with the conventional coupler having<br>
a main line length of about 2 wavelengths.<br>
Many design variations are possible. As has been shown, the number of<br>
coupler units may be varied, as well as the lengths of the coupled sections and delay<br>
sections. Further, the tightness of the coupling in each coupled section may be<br>
varied, if desired. As with conventional couplers, the direction of signal transmission<br>
may also be reversed. As a practical matter, the overall coupler may be reduced in<br>
length between the input and output ports by making the lines in the coupled<br>
sections tightly coupled. The amount of coupling provided by the coupler then is<br>
determined by the length of the coupled section and all coupled sections can have<br>
the same spacing between the main and auxiliary lines. This simplifies construction<br>
of the couplers. Also, the design of the delay loops may be varied and may include<br>
lumped elements.<br>
While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with<br>
reference to the foregoing preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will<br><br>
understand that many variations may be made therein without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims. The description<br>

to all possible combinations that may be claimed in this or a later application. Where<br>
