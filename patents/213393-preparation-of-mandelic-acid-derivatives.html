"PREPARATION OF MANDELIC ACID DERIVATIVES"<br>
AVECIA  LIMITED,   of Hexagon   House,   Blackley,   Manchester  M9   8ZS, England,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of/the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
732/MUMNP/03<br>
25/07/03<br><br>
GRANTED<br>

This invention relates to processes for the preparation of chiral forms of ortho substituted mandelic acid.<br>
Mandelic acid substituted in the ortho position is a key intermediate in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals in particular anticoagulants such as clopidogrel.<br>
A number of different processes for the preparation of enantiomers of mandelic acid have been proposed. For example in US 5223416 a biological process is described which involves subjecting (R),(S)- benzaldehyde cyanohydrin, or a derivative, or a mixture of prussic acid and benzaldehyde to the action of a microorganism. However, the process most commonly used is based on selectively forming the (R) or (S) enantiomers of the corresponding cyanohydrin and then hydrolysing to yield the desired 2-hydroxy acid with no loss of stereochemical purity.<br>
Many methods for the asymmetric addition of cyanating agents to aryl aldehydes have been reported in the literature. These methods are reviewed in Comprehensive Asymmetric Catalysis; Eds. Jacobsen, E.N., Pfaltz, A. and Yamamoto, H; Chapter 28. High enantiomeric excesses (e.e.) of one or other enantiomer of cyanohydrin have been achieved with enzyme and peptide-catalysts. However, with non-biological catalysts much lower optical yields are seen. These methods also generally involve the use of high levels of catalyst (i.e. more than 5mol% catalyst).<br>
Two recent papers (Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1999, 121, 3968-3973; and Organic Letters, 2000, 2, 1617-1619) describe new titanium and vanadium chiral catalysts respectively which are able to convert aryl aldehydes at ambient temperature (or lower) into the corresponding trimethylsilyl ethers of cyanohydrins at high yield and optical purity using low levels of catalyst. While these methods are of general applicability they give products of lower optical purity with ortho substituted benzaldehydes, especially those where the aldehyde is electron deficient.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for the stereoselective preparation of a compound of Formula (1):<br><br>
Formula (1)<br>

o-chlorobenzaldehyde	(R) 2-chloromandelonitrile silyl ether<br>
o-Chlorobenzaldehyde (0.459 g, 0.37 ml, 3.269 mmol) was added by a syringe to a catalyst of Formula (7) ((2 mg, 3.3x10+3 mmol) in CH2CI2 (5 ml), followed by TMSCN (0.357 g, 0.48 ml, 3.597 mmol). The solution was stirred at room temperature overnight at<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
20°C. Analysis by G.C. showed that the reaction had gone to 92% conversion (76% e.e.) after 18 hrs and 96% conversion (76% e.e.) after 48 hrs. The catalyst was removed by passing the mixture through a plug of silica and washing with dichloromethane.<br>

(R) 2-chloromandelonitrile silyl ether	(R) 2-chloromandelic acid<br>
: o	The silyl ether of 2'-chloromandelonitrile (0.39 g, 1.626 mmo!) from step 1(a) and<br>
water (0.5 ml) were placed in a 100 ml flask equipped with a reflux condenser. Hydrochloric acid (37%, 5 ml) was added via a dropping funnel and the solution was stirred and heated to 80 °C for 48 hrs. The solution was cooled to room temperature and diethyl ether (10 ml) was added. After vigorous stirring for 30 mins the stirrer was stopped. The extent of reaction was determined by conversion of the (R) 2-chloromandelic acid to the corresponding methyl ester. A 0.2 ml sample was taken into methanol (1 ml) in a G.C. vial and left to stand at ambient temperature for 1 hr to form the methyl ester. The methyl ester was determined by G.C. analysis which showed 100% conversion to with no trace of starting material indicating that the reaction had gone to completion after 48 hrs. Optical purity of the final product was determined by G.C. analysis following conversion to the trifluoroacetate ester. The analysis showed that the reaction had gone with stereochemical retention.<br>
The product was extracted from the reaction mixture with diethyl ether (3 x 20 ml), purified by passing through a plug of silica, dried using MgS04 and concentrated.<br>
Step 1 (c)<br>
The crude (R) 2-chloromandelic acid from step 1 (b) was heated in toluene until dissolved and seed crystals of pure (R)-2-chloromandelic acid were added. The solution was gradually cooled to ambient temperature, over which time crystallisation occurred. The crystals were collected using a Buchner funnel/filter system. The crystallisation process was repeated in order to obtain crystals with &gt;99% e.e. (analysed as the trifluoroacetate ester by G.C).<br><br>

The solution was stirred at room temperature overnight at 10 20°C. Analysis by G.C. showed that the reaction had gone to 95% conversion (81% e.e.) after 1.5 hrs and to 97% conversion (81% e.e.) after 22 hrs. The catalyst was removed by passing the mixture through a plug of silica and washing with 10:1 v/v hexane:ethyl acetate.<br>

(R) 2-chloromandelonitrile silyl ether (0.39 g, 1.626 mmol). from step 2(a) and water (0.5 ml) were placed in a 100 ml flask equipped with a reflux condenser. Hydrochloric acid (37%, 5 ml) was added via a dropping funnel and the solution was stirred and heated to 80 °C for 5 hrs. The solution was cooled to room temperature and diethyl ether (10 ml) was added. After vigorous stirring for 30 mins the stirrer was stopped.<br>
The extent of reaction was determined by conversion of the (R) 2-chloromandelic acid to the corresponding methyl ester. A 0.2 ml sample was taken into methanol (1 ml) in a G.C. vial and left to stand at ambient temperature for 1 hr to form the methyl ester. The methyl ester was determined by G.C. analysis which showed 100% conversion with no 30     trace of starting material indicating that the reaction had gone to completion after 48 hrs.<br>
Optical purity of the final product was determined by G.C. analysis following conversion to the trifluoroacetate ester. The analysis showed that the reaction had gone with stereochemical retention.<br>
The product was extracted from the reaction mixture with diethyl ether (3 x 20 ml), purified by passing through a plug of silica, dried using MgS04 and concentrated.<br><br><br>
Step 2(c)<br>
The crude (R) 2-chloromandelic acid from step 2 (b) was heated in toluene until dissolved and seed crystals of pure (R)-2-chloromandelic acid were added. The solution was gradually cooled to ambient temperature, over which time crystallisation occurred. The crystals were collected using a Buchner funnel/filter system. The crystallisation process was repeated in order to obtain crystals with &gt;99% e.e. (analysed as the trifiuoroacetate ester by G.C.).<br>

0.16 ml, 1.37 mmol) and water (0.25 g, 0.25 ml, 13.66 mmol). The slurry was cooled to a temperature of-6°C and acetic anhydride (3.08 g, 2.85 ml, 30.17 mmol) was added via a syringe. The slurry was agitated at a temperature of -5°C to 0°C. Analysis by G.C. showed that the reaction had gone to 51% conversion (62% e.e.) after 4 hrs and to 61% conversion (53% e.e.) after 7 hrs. The excess potassium cyanide was filtered off and the product was washed with dichloromethane before the filtrates were reduced in vacuo. The residues were dissolved in 10:2 v/v hexane : ethyl acetate and the catalyst was removed by passing the mixture through a bed of silica and washing with 10:1 v/v hexane : ethyl acetate.<br>
