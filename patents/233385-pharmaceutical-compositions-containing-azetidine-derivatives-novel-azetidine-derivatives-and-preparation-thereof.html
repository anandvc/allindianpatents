It is understood for persons skilled in the art that, to carry out the processes according to the invention which are described above, it may be necessary to introduce groups protecting amino, hydroxyl and carboxyl functions in order to avoid side reactions.

As examples of groups protecting the hydroxyl function, there may be mentioned triethylsilyl and tert-butyldimethylsilyl which may be regenerated using tetrabutylammonium fluoride or alternatively asymmetric acetals (methoxymethyl or â¢tetrahydropyranyl for example) with regeneration using hydrochloric acid. As groups protecting carboxyl functions, there may be mentioned esters (allyl or benzyl for example), oxazoles and 2-alkyl-l,3-oxazolines. Other protecting groups which can be used are described by GREENE T.W. et al., Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, second edition, 1991, John Wiley &amp; Sons.<br>

cardiovascular or endocrine system, the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal apparatus and reproductive disorders (Hollister, Pharm. Rev.; 38, 1986, 1-20, Reny and Sinha, Prog.

(4-Pyridyl)(4-chlorophenyl)methanol may be prepared in the following manner: 348 mg of sodium<br>
tetraborohydride are added, at a temperature in the region of 20Â°C, to a solution of 2 g of 4-(4-chloro-oenzoyl)pyridine in 160 cm3 of ethanol. After stirring for 2 hours at a temperature in the region of 20Â°C, 90 mg of sodium tetraborohydride are added. After about 1.5 hours at the same temperature, the reaction medium is diluted with 200 cm3 of dichloromethane and 200 cmj of water. The pH of the aqueous phase is adjusted to a value of about 5 by addition of about 13 cm3 of a 1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. After decantation, the aqueous phase is extracted with 3 times 100 cm3 of dichloromethane. The organic phases are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. 2 g of (4-pyridyl)(4-chlorophenyl)-methanol are thus obtained in the form of a white powder.<br>
Example 36<br>
24.4 mg of a 75% dispersion of sodium hydride in mineral oil are added, at room temperature under an argon atmosphere, to a solution of 330 mg of {l-[bis(4-chlorophenyl)methyl]azetidin-3-yl}(3,5-difluoro-benzyl)amine in 25 cm3 of tetrahydrofuran. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hour before adding thereto 59 mm3 of methyl chloroformate, and then the stirring is maintained for 18 hours under the same conditions. The reaction mixture is supplemented with 0.3 cm3 of distilled water and the tetrahydrofuran is expelled in a rotary evaporator. The residue obtained is extracted with dichloromethane, the organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure (2.7 kPa). The residue obtained is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel [eluent: dichloromethane/methanol (97.5/2.5 by volume)]. 328 mg of methyl {1-[bis(4-chlorophenyl)-methyl]azetidin-3-yl}-(3,5-difluorobenzyl)carbamate are obtained in the form of a colorless oil ^R NMR spectrum<br>

The medicaments according to the invention consist of at least one compound of formula (I) or an isomer or a salt of such a compound, in the pure state or in the form of a composition in which it is combined with any other pharmaceutically compatible product which may be inert or physiologically active. The medicaments according to the invention may be used orally, parenterally, rectally or topically.<br>
As solid compositions for oral<br>
administration, tablets, pills, powders (gelatine capsules, sachets) or granules may be used. In these compositions, the active ingredient according to the invention is mixed with one or more inert diluents, such as starch, cellulose, sucrose, lactose or silica, under an argon stream. These compositions may also<br>
comprise substances other than diluents, for example one or more lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talc, a coloring, a coating (sugar-coated tablet) or a glaze.<br>
As liquid compositions for oral<br>
administration, there may be used pharmaceutically acceptable solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents such as water, ethanol, glycerol, vegetable oils or paraffin oil. These compositions may comprise substances other than diluents, for example wetting, sweetening, thickening, flavoring or stabilizing products.<br>
Sterile compositions for parenteral<br>
administration may be preferably solutions which are aqueous or nonaqueous, suspensions or emulsions. As solvent or vehicle, there may be used water, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, in particular olive oil, injectable organic esters, for example ethyl oleate or other suitable organic solvents. These compositions may also contain adjuvants, in particular wetting, isotonizing, emulsifying, dispersing and stabilizing agents. Sterilization may be carried out in several ways, for example by asepticizing filtration, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the composition, by irradiation or by heating. They may also be prepared in the form of sterile solid compositions which may be dissolved at<br>
the time of use in sterile water or any other injectable sterile medium.<br>
Compositions for rectal administration are suppositories or rectal capsules which contain, in addition to the active product, excipients such as cocoa butter, semisynthetic glycerides or polyethylene glycols.<br>
Compositions for topical administration may be, for example, creams, lotions, collyria, collutoria, nasal drops or aerosols.<br>
In human therapy, the compounds according to the invention are particularly useful for the treatment and/or prevention of psychoses including schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, depression, epilepsy, neurodegeneration, cerebellar and spinocerebellar disorders, cognitive disorders, cranial trauma, panic attacks, peripheral neuropathies, glaucomas, migraine, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, Raynaud's syndrome, tremor, obsessive-compulsive disorder, senile dementia, thymic disorders, Tourette's syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, bipolar disorders, cancers, movement disorders induced by medicaments, dystonia, endotoxemic shocks, hemorrhagic shocks, hypotension, insomnia, immunological diseases, multiple sclerosis, vomiting, asthma, appetite disorders (bulimia, anorexia), obesity, memory disorders, intestinal transit disorders, in weaning from chronic treatments and alcohol or drug abuse<br>
(opioids, barbiturates, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, phencyclide, hallucinogens, benzodiazepines for example), as analgesics or potentiators of the analgesic activity of the narcotic and nonnarcotic drugs.<br>
The doses depend on the desired effect, the duration of the treatment and the route of administration used; they are generally between 5 mg and 1000 mg per day orally for an adult with unit doses ranging from 1 mg to 250 mg of active substance.<br>
In general, the doctor will determine the appropriate dosage depending on the age, weight and any other factors specific to the subject to be treated.<br>
