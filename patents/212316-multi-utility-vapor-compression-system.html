A schematic of Conventional Vapor Compression System (VCS) shown in Figure 1. High pressure-high temperature refrigerant vapour is discharged by Compressor 1, through the conduit 2, to condenser 7 through conduit 5 where it rejects heat 6 toi ambient. Further condensed high pressure-low temperature liquid refrigerant passes through the conduit 8 to liquid-vapour heat exchanger 9, where refrigerant is sub cooled by delivering; heat to the vapour refrigerant from the evaporator 16 while passing to compressor 1. Sub cooled refrigerant is throttled in throttling device 11 and passes through conduit 15, to evaporator 16. In 16 it extract heat 17 from the space to be conditioned, low pressure vapour refrigerant further passes through the conduit 18 to 9 where it is super-heated. This superheated refrigerant vapour passes through the conduit 19 back to 1 to complete the cycle. Conventional VC$ provides only air conditioning and is not capable of operating as multiutility system. The main feature, of this invention is that"a judicious coupling: of VCS and HMTD synergistically function to produce new effects such as generating hot and/or cold utility while conditioning air.<br>
Various options for MUVCS are as follows: a)  In one of the embodiments HMTD is in series with condenser/evaporator of VCS in which<br>
•	HMTD is in series With condenser/evaporator of VCS,<br>
•	HMTD is before condenser of VCS in refrigerant circuit	<br>
•	Part of the total heat is"rejected to fluid in HMTD by the refrigerant to obtain hot utility<br>
•	Residual heat is rejected to atmosphere by the refrigerant in the condenser »,   HMTD is placed before evaporator of VCS in refrigerant circuit<br>
•	The heat from the fluid in HMTD is absorbed to evaporate part of the refrigerant to obtain ,    cold utility	"<br>
•	Heat from the space to be conditioned is absorbed to evaporate residual refrigerant<br>
The system and process to operate option (a) is shown in Figure 2 with schematic of MUVCS with HMTD in series with condenser / evaporator of VCS. Vapor Compression System works as already explained in Figure 1. Additional heat and mass transfer devices are added in series with the condenser and evaporator. In 3, high temperature refrigerant vapour transfers heat to the fluid in conduit 4 to get hot utility. Refrigerant is further passed through conduit 5 to 7, where it rejects heat 6 to ambient. Sub cooled refrigerant is throttled in the throttling device 11, which is then passed through the heat transfer device 13, placed in series with 16. Low pressure- low temperature liquid refrigerant in conduit 12 is evaporated by absorbing heat from the fluid passing through conduit 14, where the fluid is chilled.<br><br>
In another embodiment of (a) fluid is not passed through conduit 4 and 14 to get hot and cold utility while conditioning air. Same system can condition air without delivering hot and cold utility.<br>
b)	In another embodiment HMTD is integrated with condenser/evaporator of VCS in which<br>
•	HMTD and condenser of the VCS are integrated in a single device such that they are in parallel connection in refrigerant circuit<br>
•	Part of the total heat is rejected to fluid in HMTD by the refrigerant to obtain hot utility<br>
•	Residual heat is rejected to atmosphere by the refrigerant in the condenser<br><br>
•	HMTD and evaporator of the VCS are integrated in a single device such that they are in parallel connection in refrigerant circuit<br>
•	The heat from the fluid in HMTD is absorbed to evaporate part, of the refrigerant to obtain cold utility<br>
•	Heat from the space to be conditioned is absorbed to evaporate residual refrigerant<br>
The system and process to operate option (b) is shown in Figure. 3 with Schematic of MUVCS with HMTD integrated with condenser/evaporator of VCS. Vapor Compression System works as explained in Figure 1. Additional heat and mass transfer devices are integrated with the condenser and evaporator. Device 120 consists of condenser and Heat and Mass Transfer Device (HMTD), integrated and in parallel connection in refrigerant circuit with the condenser. The vapour refrigerant in 120 rejects major part of heat to the fluid passing through 121 to get the hot utility through conduit 107. Excess heat 106 is rejected to air. High pressure low temperature liquid refrigerant from 120 passes through 110 to liquid vapor heat exchanger 111. Low pressure- low temperature liquid refrigerant in 124 is partially evaporated by absorbing heat 127 from the space to be conditioned. Refrigerant is further evaporated by absorbing heat from fluid passing through 125.<br>
In another embodiment of (b) thermal contact between tubes carrying fluid in the HMTD and refrigerant tubes is enabled by fins. A set of the tubes carrying refrigerant and fluid are in the form of rows.<br>
c)	In yet another embodiment conditioning of air is provided at different locations in which<br>
•	HMTD and condenser of the VCS are integrated in a single device such that they are in parallel connection in refrigerant circuit<br>
•	Part of the total heat is rejected to fluid in HMTD by the refrigerant to obtain hot utility<br>

The system and process to operate option (c) is shown in Figure 4 with schematic of MUVCS with HMTD at different location/s. Vapor Compression System works as explained in Figure 1. Additional HMTD 230 is used to facilitate conditioning of air at distant location. Low pressure- low temperature liquid refrigerant in 224 is partially evaporated by absorbing heat 227 from one of the spaces to be conditioned. Refrigerant is further evaporated by absorbing heat from fluid passing through 225. Cold fluid from 225 passes through 215 to pump 228. Pump feeds the cold fluid through conduit 229. to 231 of the heat and mass transfer device 230 which is placed in the space to be conditioned which is located at a distance from the 217. Thus, it is possible to condition different spaces at different distant locations by evaporating refrigerant at one location only. After absorbing heat from the space to be conditioned, fluid passes through conduit 233 back to 225. Low pressure vapour refrigerant further passes through the conduit 218 to 223 where it is, super-heated. Superheated refrigerant vapour passes through the conduit 219 to compressor 201 and cycle is completed.<br>
d)   In another embodiment conditioning of air of high relative humidity is provided in which •■    HMTD is a contacting device consisting of a rotating/ assembly submerged in liquid desiccant/ water in a containment vessel<br>
•	Liquid Desiccant (LD) is cooled by the evaporator of the VCS which is in thermal contact with the containment vessel<br>
•	Moisture from the air with high relative humidity is absorbed by cooled LD<br>
•	Refrigerant rejects heat to LD in another containment vessel to release absorbed moisture in the LD<br>
•	Water/ liquid desiccant is used in containment vessel to use the system as thermal storage when air conditioning load is lower than the designed capacity of the system<br>
The system and process to operate option (d) is shown in Figure 5 with schematic of MUVCS with contacting devices as HMTD and condenser / evaporator. The system comprises of an absorber/ICD 318, which incorporates large surface density contacting discs 301, in plurality mounted on a shaft 302. The disc-assembly placed in a trough 303, containing the LD. The trough is made of any material that is compatible with the LD and air. A fan, 316 circulates the indoor air through the absorber/ICD, which gets dehumidified and cooled as it passes through the absorber. In an embodiment the fan may be a forced/induced draft fan. A hood, 314 guides the indoor air over the contacting disc assembly. Concentrated LD enters the absorber/ICD through conduit 306. Weak LD leaves the absorber/ICD through conduit 307. The contacting discs are partially submerged in the LD, in the absorber/ ICD. The disc assembly is rotated by a drive at low rpm in the LD, preferably at around 3 to 5 rpm or oscillated to an angle greater than 30° in either direction. The refrigerant of VCRS is expanded in the throttle valve, 321 and the low temperature refrigerant flows in through conduit 311 to the passages 309, that are in thermal contact with the puter lower surface or inner surface or integrated; with the trough wall of the absorber/ ICD. The LD in the absorber/ICD is cooled as the refrigerant evaporates in the passages 309. The cooled desiccant in the absorber has high affinity to absorb the moisture from the indoor air. After absorbing the moisture from the indoor air, weak LD flows through conduit 307 and led to the pump 330, to the regenerator/OCD, 319 through a liquid-liquid heat exchanger 331. This heat exchanger is provided to heat the LD from the absorber/ICD and cool the desiccant stream as it flows from regenerator/OCD 319, which flows in to the absorber/ ICD.   Refrigerant exits<br><br>
from the absorber/ICD through conduit 312 and moves to the compressor 320. Refrigerant after compression, passes through conduit 310 to the passages 309 of regenerator/OCD, 319 which are in thermal contact with the outer lower surface or inner surface or integrated with the trough wall of the regenerator/OCD. The weak LD from absorber/ICD after liquid-liquid heat exchanger flows to the regenerator/OCD. The weak LD enters the regenerator /OCD through conduit 327. The heat required for the regeneration is supplied by the refrigerant condensing in the passages 309. After condensation of the refrigerant in regenerator/ OCD, it moves through conduit 12 which led to throttling device 321. The regenerated, strong LD flows out from the regenerator/OCD through conduit 308 and pumped with LD pump 332 to the absorber/ICD through the liquid-liquid heat exchanger, 331. A hood 314 is provided to guide the outdoor air through the regenerator/OCD. A fan 316 is provided to circulate the outdoor air through the regenerator/OCD. The contacting disc assembly is partially submerged in the LD in the regenerator/OCD. The ambient air pickups the moisture from the hot desiccant, in the trough of regenerator/OCD.<br>
In another embodiment of (d) water is used in trough 303 instead of liquid desiccant to use the system as thermal storage when air conditioning load is lower than the designed capacity of the system<br>
In yet another embodiment of (d) HMTD is a contacting device consisting of a rotating assembly and a liquid desiccant/ water in a containment vessel or any other suitable contacting device<br>
In another embodiment of (a)-(c) HMTD consists of finned tubes, tube and tube or any suitable heat transfer surface<br>
In another embodiment of (d), air conditioning for high humidity areas is provided using contacting devices as HMTD<br>
In yet another embodiment of (d), contacting device enables thermal storage while air conditioning is not at peak load<br>
In another embodiment of (d), contacting device/s are used as evaporator and condenser and<br>
HTD to get hot and/Or cold utilities and air conditioning	- •<br>
In another embodiment of (a)-(d), any suitable refrigerant such as ammonia, R 22, C02etc. is used as refrigerant<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Example shows the result of the combination in a wherein HMTD is places in series with condenser/evaporator of the VCS as explained in embodiment (a). Vapor compression system used in the example is window air conditioner. Important parameters, needed to evaluate the performance this system are tabulated in Table 1. Performance of this Multi Utility Vapor Compression System (MUVCS) operating in different modes is compared with the air conditioning (AC) mode.<br><br>
In AC + Water Heating (WH) + Water Cooling (WC) mode most of the condenser heat is delivered to the water being heated. Lower condensing pressure leads to a lower pressure rati . This results in 5.47 % increase in total cooling capacity, to 5.34 kWc, of which about 4.59 kW is in the form of AC and 0.75 kW in the form of cooled potable water cooled to 15°C. Lower pressure ratio leads to 9.72 % lowering of power consumption, to 1.86 kWe, which results in 16.82 % increase in cooling COP, to 2.87. Water heating duty works out to be 4.01 kW and the corresponding heating COP is 2.15. Overall COP of the HP is 5.02.<br><br>

In- AC + WH mode also most Of the condenser heat is delivered to the water being heated. This helps lower the condensing temperature to 44°C as compared to 54.9°C in the AC mode. Lower condensing pressure leads to a lower pressure ratio of 3.37. This results in reduced flashing at the outlet of the expansion device and higher compressor volumetric efficiency. This leads to 8.05 % increase in cooling capacity, to 5.47 kWc. Lower pressure ratio leads to 8.13 % lowering of power consumption, to 1.89 kWe, which results in 17.62 % increase in cooling COP, to 2.89, Water heating duty works out to be 3.13 kW and the corresponding heating COP is 1.65, Overall COP of the HP is 4.54.<br>
In AC + WC mode the condenser is air cooled, which leads to higher condensing temperature of 54.9°C. Evaporating pressure increased because of cold water extraction and higher indoor air temperature. The total cooling capacity increased by 2.19 % because of cold water extraction which leads to higher inlet air temperature to the indoor unit. Power consumption of the HP is reduced by 7.44 %. Since, the cooling capacity increased and the power consumption reduced, the cooling COP of the system enhanced by 10.41 %, which takes up the overall COP of the HP to 2.71.<br>
The test results for both window and split HP in different modes shows that the cooling capacity is increased by 2.19 to 8.05 % and the cooling COP is enhanced by 10.41 to 37.86 % compared to conventional air condition systems. Performance of the HP reverts to that of conventional Air Conditioners when hot and cold water is not tapped.<br>
Thus, the judicious coupling of VCS and HMTD synergistically function to produce new effects such as generating hot and/or cold utility while conditioning air. A mere combination of a VCS<br><br>
