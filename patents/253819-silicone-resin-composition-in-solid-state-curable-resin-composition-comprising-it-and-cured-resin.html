				<td>Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a silicone resin composition, curable resin<br>
composition, and a cured resin. More specifically, the invention relates to the following:<br>
a silicone resin composition that is characterized by low melt viscosity and good<br>
dispersibility in and high reactivity to organic resins; a curable resin composition that<br>
possesses good moldability, is capable of forming a cured resin with excellent flame<br>
resistance, and does not produce a harmful influence on the environment and human health<br>
since it is free of halogenated epoxy resin and antimony-type oxide; and a cured resin with<br>
excellent flame resistance that is also characterized by low influence on the environment<br>
and human health.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] As disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No.<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "Kokai") H6-298940, it is possible to prepare a silicone resin<br>
with a required molecular weight, softening point and glass transition point by combining<br>
siloxanes or silanes as raw materials and by providing specific reaction conditions.<br>
However, it is difficult to provide accurate control of the melt viscosity of the<br>
aforementioned silicone resin, as well as to control dispersibility and reactivity thereof<br>
when it is combined with organic resins.<br>
[0003] On the other hand, it is known that curable resin compositions may form cured<br>
resins characterized by excellent dielectric properties, volumetric resistivity, insulation<br>
resistance or other electrical properties, as well as by improved bending strength,<br>
compression strength, impact strength, or other mechanical properties. Nevertheless, in<br>
order to improve flame resistance of these resins, they must incorporate halogen-containing<br>
compounds, antimony trioxides, or similar antimony-type compounds, which is<br>
undesirable because they produce toxic antimony oxide dust and toxic gases during<br>
burning which are harmful to human health and to the environment.<br>
[0004] As has been shown in Kokai H6-298897, the addition of a silicone resin to a<br>
curable resin improves such properties of the resin as flowability prior to curing,<br><br>
flexibility, and resistance to moisture and heat shock. Furthermore, as disclosed in Kokai<br>
H11 -222559 and Kokai H11 -323086, the addition of silicone resin to a curable resin<br>
improves flame resistance of the resin. However, the problem associated with the curable<br>
resin composition disclosed in Kokai H6-298897 consists of insufficient flame-resistant<br>
properties in the obtained cured resin, while the curable resin compositions of Kokai H11-<br>
222559 and Kokai H11-323086 encounter a problem associated with contamination of a<br>
mold during the molding process.<br>
[0005] Kokai 2003-253122 discloses a method for improving mechanical properties<br>
and compounding properties in the preparation of a curable resin by combining silicone<br>
resin with an epoxy-containing silicone resin. However, the effect of this method is<br>
insufficient.<br>
[0006] It is an object of the present invention to provide a silicone resin composition<br>
that is characterized by low melt viscosity and improved dispersibility in, and reactivity to,<br>
organic resins. It is another object to provide a curable resin composition that is<br>
characterized by improved moldability, ability to form cured resins with excellent flame-<br>
resistant properties, and by reduced influence on human health and environment because<br>
this curable resin is free from halogenated epoxy resins and antimony compounds. It is a<br>
further object to provide a cured resin which has low influence on human health and<br>
environment and possesses improved flame-resistance properties.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
[0007] A silicone resin composition of the invention comprises a mixture or a reaction<br>
mixture of the following components:<br>
(A) a silicone resin having a softening point above 25°C and represented by the following<br>
average unit formula:<br>
(R1SiO3/2). (R22SiO2/2)b (R33SiO1/2)c (SiO4/2)d (XO1/2)e<br>
{where R1, R2, and R3 designate identical or different univalent hydrocarbon groups or<br>
epoxy-containing organic groups, of the total number of R1, R2, and R3 in the molecule, 0.1<br>
to 40 mole % comprises epoxy-containing organic groups and not less than 10 mole %<br>
comprises phenyl groups; X is hydrogen atom or an alkyl group; "a" is a positive number,<br>
"b" is 0 or a positive number; "c" is 0 or a positive number; "d" is 0 or a positive number;<br>
"e" is 0 or a positive number; "b/a" is a number within the range of 0 to 10; "c/a" is a<br>
number within the range of 0 to 0.5; "d/(a+b+c+d)" is a number within the range of 0 to<br>
0.3; and "e/(a+b+c+d)" is a number within the range of 0 to 0.4} and<br><br>
(B) an epoxy-containing alkoxysilane.<br>
[0008] The curable resin composition of the invention comprises (I) a curable resin<br>
and (II) the aforementioned silicone resin composition.<br>
[0009] Furthermore, the cured resin of the invention is the one obtained by curing the<br>
aforementioned curable resin composition.<br>
Effects of Invention<br>
[0010] The silicone resin composition of the invention is characterized by low melt<br>
viscosity and improved dispersibility in, and reactivity to, organic resins. Furthermore,<br>
the curable resin composition of the invention is characterized by improved moldability,<br>
ability to form cured resin with excellent flame-resistant properties, and by reduced<br>
influence on human health and environment since it is free of such harmful components as<br>
halogenated epoxy resin and antimony compounds. Furthermore, the cured resin of the<br>
invention is characterized by reduced influence on human health and environment as well<br>
as by improved flame-resistant properties.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0011] The following is a more detailed description of the silicone resin composition<br>
of the invention.<br>
[0012] Component (A) is a silicone resin represented by the following average unit<br>
formula:<br><br>
and having a softening point above 25°C. In this formula, R1, R2, and R3 may be the<br>
same or different and may represent univalent hydrocarbon groups or epoxy-containing<br>
organic groups. The univalent hydrocarbon groups can be exemplified by methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, or similar alkyl groups; vinyl, allyl, butenyl, pentenyl,<br>
hexenyl, or similar alkenyl groups; phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, naphthyl, or similar aryl groups;<br>
benzyl, phenethyl, or similar aralkyl groups; chloromethyl, 3-chloropropyl, 3,3,3-<br>
trifluoropropyl, nonafiuorobutyl ethyl, or similar halogenated alkyl groups. The epoxy-<br>
containing organic groups can be exemplified by 2,3-epoxypropyl, 3,4-epoxybutyl, 4,5-<br>
epoxypentyl, or similar epoxyalkyl groups; 2-glycidoxyethyl, 3-glycidoxypropyl, 4-<br>
glycidoxybutyl, or similar glycidoxyalkyl groups; 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyI) ethyl, 3-(3,4-<br>
epoxycyclohexyl) propyl, or similar epoxycyclohexyl alkyl groups. Of the total number<br>
of R1, R2, and R3 in the molecule, 0.1 to 40 mole % comprises epoxy-containing organic<br><br>
groups. If the content of the epoxy-containing organic groups is less than the<br>
abovementioned lower limit when the obtained composition is mixed with an organic<br>
resin, bleeding may occur during molding, and the molded product will have low<br>
flexibility and low resistance to moisture and heat shock. On the other hand, if the<br>
amount exceeds the abovementioned upper limit, this may impair the mechanical<br>
properties of the molded product. From the point of view of improved affinity for organic<br>
resins, the amount of phenyl groups should be 10 mole % or more per total amount of<br>
groups designated as R1, R2, and R3. In particular, preferably, phenyl groups should<br>
comprise not less than 10 mole % of R1, and even more preferably, phenyl groups should<br>
comprise not less than 30 mol % of R1. In the above formula, X designates a hydrogen<br>
atom or an alkyl group such as a methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl. or a heptyl<br>
group.<br>
[0013] In the above formula, "a" is a positive number, "b" is 0 or a positive number;<br>
"c" is 0 or a positive number; "d" is 0 or a positive number; "e" is 0 or a positive number;<br>
"b/a" is a number within the range of 0 to 10; "c/a" is a number within the range of 0 to<br>
0.5; "d/(a+b+c+d)" is a number within the range of 0 to 0.3; and "e/(a+b+c+d)" is a<br>
number within the range of 0 to 0.4. If "b/a" exceeds 10, the silicone resin will be either<br>
obtained with a softening point not greater than 25 °C or will have reduced affinity for<br>
organic resins. Furthermore, if "d/(a+b+c+d)" exceeds 0.3, this will reduce dispersibility<br>
of silicone resin in organic resins.<br>
[0014] There are no special restrictions with regard to the weight-average molecular<br>
weight of component (A), and it may be within the range of 500 to 50,000, and preferably<br>
500 to 10,000. Also, there is no special restrictions with regard to the softening point of<br>
component (A), provided that it is above 25°C, preferably between 40 and 250°C, and even<br>
more preferably between 40 and 150°C. If the softening point of the silicone resin is<br>
below the recommended lower limit, the resin will be subject to bleeding during molding<br>
of the organic resin that contains the silicone resin, and thus will contaminate the mold or<br>
will impair mechanical properties of the molded product. If, on the other hand, the<br>
softening point of the silicone resin exceeds the upper limit, it will be difficult to uniformly<br>
disperse it in the organic resin.<br>
[0015] There are no special restrictions with regard to a method suitable for the<br>
preparation of a silicone resin of component (A). For example, it can be obtained by<br>
causing a reaction between constituents (A') and (A"), where the constituent (A') is a<br><br>
silane or siloxane composed of at least one type of units represented by the following unit<br>
formulae: (i) R4SiO3/2 (where R4 is a univalent hydrocarbon group); (ii) R52SiO2/2 (where<br>
R5 may be the same or different univalent hydrocarbon groups); (iii) R63SiO1/2 (where R6<br>
may be the same or different univalent hydrocarbon groups); and (iv) SiO4/2, or a mixture<br>
of two or more of the aforementioned silanes or siloxanes, and where the constituent (A")<br>
is an epoxy-containing alkoxysilane represented by the formula given below or by a<br>
product of its partial hydrolysis: R7R8fSi(OR9)(3-f) (where R7 is an epoxy-containing<br>
organic group, R8 is a univalent hydrocarbon group, R is an alkyl group, and "f" is 0,1, or<br>
2), the reaction being carried out in the presence of a basic catalyst.<br>
[0016] In the above-described method, constituent (A') is a main raw material which<br>
is a silane or siloxane composed of at least one type of units selected from the units<br>
represented by the aforementioned formulae (i) through (iv), or a mixture of two or more<br>
of the aforementioned silanes or siloxanes. Such constituent (A') may be a silane or<br>
siloxane composed only of units (i), a silane or siloxane composed only of unit (ii), a silane<br>
or siloxane composed only of unit (iii), a silane or siloxane composed only of unit (iv), a<br>
siloxane composed of units (i) and (ii), a siloxane composed of units (i) and (iii), a siloxane<br>
composed of units (i) and (iv), a siloxane composed of units (i), (ii), and (iii), a siloxane<br>
composed of units (i), (ii) and (iv), and a siloxane composed of units (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).<br>
In the above formulae, R4, R5, and R6 may be the same or different and may represent<br>
univalent hydrocarbon groups and may be exemplified by the same univalent hydrocarbon<br>
groups as previously mentioned examples of R1, R2, or R3. It is recommended that 10<br>
mole % or more, and preferably 30 mole % or more of R4's be comprised of phenyl<br>
groups.<br>
[0017] The aforementioned silanes or siloxanes of constituent (A') may be<br>
exemplified by methyltrimethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, ethyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
ethyltriethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, phenyltrimethoxysilane, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl<br>
trimethoxysilane, dimethyldimethoxysilane, methylphenyl dimethoxysilane, methylvinyl<br>
dimethoxysilane, diphenyldimethoxysilane, dimethyldiethoxysilane, methylphenyl<br>
diethoxysilane, tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, tetrapropoxysilane,<br>
dimethoxydiethoxysilane, or products of hydrolysis of the above.<br>
[0018] In the above method, constituent (A") is used for introduction of epoxy-<br>
containing organic groups. It is an epoxy-containing alkoxysilane of general formula:<br>
R7R8fSi(OR9)(3-f) or a product of its partial hydrolysis. In this formula, R7 is an epoxy-<br><br>
containing organic group that may be exemplified by the same epoxy-containing organic<br>
groups as those given for R1, R2, or R3. Furthermore, R8 designates a univalent<br>
hydrocarbon group that also may be the same as those exemplified earlier for R1, R2, or R3.<br>
R9 is an alkyl group such as a methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, or a heptyl group.<br>
In the above formula, "f is 0, 1 or 2 and preferably 0.<br>
[0019] The following are specific examples of epoxy-containing alkoxysilanes: 3-<br>
glycidoxypropyl (methyl) dimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyl (methyl) diethoxysilane, 3-<br>
glycidoxypropyl (methyl) dibutoxysilane, 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyl (methyl)<br>
dimethoxysilane, 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyl (phenyl) diethoxysilane, 2,3-epoxypropyl<br>
(methyl) dimethoxysilane, 2,3-epoxypropyl (phenyl) dimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyl<br>
trimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyl triethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyl tributoxysilane, 2-<br>
(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyl trimethoxysilane, 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyl<br>
triethoxysilane, 2,3-epoxypropyl trimethoxysilane, and 2,3-epoxypropyl triethoxysilane.<br>
[0020] The aforementioned manufacturing method consists of reacting constituents<br>
(A') and (A") in the presence of a basic catalyst. Such a catalyst may be the one used for<br>
cohydrolyzation of constituents (A') and (A"), for causing a condensation reaction, or for<br>
causing an equilibrium reaction between the constituents (A') and (A"). For example,<br>
this may be sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, or a similar alkali<br>
metal hydroxide; sodium-tert-butoxide, potassium-tert-butoxide, cesium-tert-butoxide, or a<br>
similar alkali metal alkoxide; sodium silanolate compound, potassium silanolate<br>
compound, and cesium silanolate compound, or a similar alkali metal silanolate compound.<br>
Potassium- and cesium-type basic catalysts are preferable. If necessary, for causing<br>
cohydrolyzation or condensation of constituents (A') and (A"), water can be added. If<br>
necessary, upon completion of the reaction between constituents (A') and (A"), the<br>
concentration of solid components in the reaction system can be adjusted by means of an<br>
organic solvent, or the reaction may be continued.<br>
[0021] When the method of the invention is carried out with the use of an equilibrium<br>
reaction, it means that siloxane bonds are broken and reconnected again at random,<br>
whereby the obtained epoxy-containing silicone resin arrives at an equilibrium condition.<br>
When this reaction is carried out at a low temperature, it is difficult to provide sufficient<br>
progress of the equilibrium reaction, but if the temperature is too high, this may lead to<br>
decomposition of silicon-bonded organic groups. Therefore, the preferable temperature is<br>
within the range of 80 to 200°C, preferably 100 to 150°C. Selection of an organic solvent<br><br>
that has a boiling temperature within the range of 80 to 200°C will facilitate conducting of<br>
an equilibration reaction at a refluxing temperature. The equilibrium reaction can be<br>
stopped by neutralizing the basic catalyst. This can be achieved by adding gaseous carbon<br>
dioxide or a weak acid such as carboxylic acid. Salts created due to neutralization can be<br>
simply removed by filtering or washing with water.<br>
[0022] Component (B) is an epoxy-containing alkoxy silane which is used for<br>
improving solubility of the silicone resin composition in organic resins. Component (B)<br>
can be exemplified by the following compounds: 3-glycidoxypropyl (methyl)<br>
dimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyl (methyl) diethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyl (methyl)<br>
dibutoxysilane, 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyl (methyl) dimethoxysilane, 2-(3,4-<br>
epoxycyclohexyl) ethyl (phenyl) diethoxysilane, 2,3-epoxypropyl (methyl)<br>
dimethoxysilane, 2,3-epoxypropyl (phenyl) dimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyl<br>
trimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyl triethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyl tributoxysilane, 2-<br>
(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyl trimethoxysilane, 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyl<br>
triethoxysilane, 2,3-epoxypropyl trimethoxysilane, and 2,3-epoxypropyl triethoxysilane.<br>
From the viewpoint of easy procurement, 3-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane is<br>
preferable.<br>
[0023] There are no special restrictions with regard to the amount in which component<br>
(B) can be added to the silicone resin composition of the invention, but, in general, it<br>
should be used in an amount of 0.15 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of<br>
component (A). If it is used in an amount less than the recommended lower limit, this<br>
may impair dispersibility of the silicone resin composition in organic solvents. If, on the<br>
other hand, it is used in an amount exceeding the recommended upper limit, the obtained<br>
silicone resin can become liquid, and this will impair moldability of the organic resin that<br>
contains this composition.<br>
[0024] There are no special restrictions with regard to the method of preparation of the<br>
silicone resin composition of the invention. For example, it can be prepared by mixing<br>
components (A) and (B) in a molten state, or by first mixing component (B) with an<br>
organic solvent solution of component (A) and then removing the organic solvent. The<br>
mixing operation can be carried out in a single-shaft or double-shaft-type continuous<br>
mixer, two-roll-type mill, Ross mixer®, kneader mixer, or a mixer equipped with a<br>
vacuum apparatus for removal of solvents. Organic solvents suitable for the above<br><br>
purposes may be represented by toluene, xylene, or similar aromatic hydrocarbons;<br>
acetone, methylethylketone, or similar ketone-type solvents.<br>
[0025] There are no special restrictions with regard to the melt viscosity of the silicone<br>
resin composition at 100°C, but it is recommended to be 5 x 104 mPα-s or below. Also,<br>
there are no restrictions with regard to the melt viscosity of the silicone resin composition<br>
at 140°C, but it is preferably 5000 mPα-s or below. It is preferable that at 25°C, the<br>
silicone resin composition of the invention be in a solid state and have the melting point<br>
within the range of 40 to 150°C.<br>
[0026] The silicone resin composition of the invention described above may be<br>
combined with various additives for imparting to the organic resin various properties such<br>
as resistance to heat, flame-retarding properties, water-repellant properties, or the like.<br>
Organic resins obtained by compounding with the silicone resin composition of the<br>
invention may constitute thermosetting resins or thermoplastic resins. The thermosetting<br>
resins can be exemplified by phenol resins, formaldehyde resins, xylene resins, xylene-<br>
formaldehyde resins, ketone-formaldehyde resins, furan resins, urea resins, imide resins,<br>
melamine resins, alkyd resins, unsaturated polyester resins, aniline resins, sulfonamide<br>
resins, silicone resins, epoxy resins, copolymer resins of the above, and mixtures of two or<br>
more of the above. The thermoplastic resins can be exemplified by polyethylenes<br>
composed of homopolymers or copolymers with α-olefins such as propylene, 1-butene, 1-<br>
pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, etc.; low-density polyethylene, high-density<br>
polyethylene, super-high molecular-weight polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
ethylene/propylene copolymer, etc.; olefin type resins composed of copolymers of the<br>
aforementioned α-olefin and other type of monomers such as vinyl acetates,<br>
methylmethacrylate, maleic acid, etc.; acrylic-type resins composed of homopolymers or<br>
copolymers of acrylic-type monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid;<br>
methylmethacrylate, butylmethacrylate, cyclohexylmethacrylate, 2-<br>

[0027] There are no special restrictions with regard to the amounts in which the<br>
silicone composition of the invention should be added to organic resins, but, in general, it<br>
can be added in an amount of 0.1 to 500 parts by weight, preferably 0.1 to 100 parts by<br>
weight, and even more preferably 0.5 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the<br>

[0028] The following is a more detailed description of the curable resin composition of<br>
the invention.<br>
[0029] The curable resin of component (I) is one of main components of the<br>
composition. There are no special restrictions with regard to curability of this component.<br>
For example, this component may be curable by heating, irradiating with high-energy rays<br>
such as ultraviolet rays, contact with humid air, condensation-type curing, or an addition-<br>
reaction-type curing. Also, there are no restrictions with regard to the form of this<br><br>
component that can be liquid or solid at 25 °C. This curable resin can be exemplified by<br>
the same resin as has been mentioned above such as epoxy resin, phenol resin, imide resin,<br>
or silicone epoxy-type resin.<br>
[0030] There are no special restrictions with regard to the aforementioned epoxy resin<br>
provided that it contains glycidyl groups or alicyclic epoxy groups. The following resins<br>
are given as examples: o-cresol-novolac-type epoxy resin, phenol-novolac-type epoxy<br>
resin, biphenyl-type epoxy resin, biphenyl aralkyl-type epoxy resin, biphenyl-novolac-type<br>
resin, bisphenol A-type epoxy resin, bisphenol F-type epoxy resin, bisphenol AD-type<br>
epoxy resin, bisphenol S-type epoxy resin, dicyclopentadiene-type epoxy resin,<br>
naphthalene-type epoxy resin, anthracene-type epoxy resin, naptholaralkyl-type epoxy<br>
resin, polyvinylphenol-type epoxy resin, diphenylmethane-type epoxy resin,<br>
diphenylsulfonic-type epoxy resin, triphenolalkane-type epoxy resin, cresol-naphthol co-<br>
condensation-type epoxy resin, bisphenyl-ethylene-type epoxy resin, fluorene-type epoxy<br>
resin, stilbene-type epoxy resin, spiro-cumarone-type epoxy resin, norbornene-type epoxy<br>
resin, halogenated epoxy resin, imide-containing epoxy resin, maleimide-containing epoxy<br>
resin, allyl-modified epoxy resin, epoxy resin based on heavy oil and a pitch-type raw<br>
material. In order to improve water-repellant properties and to reduce the stress in a<br>
cured body, it may be recommended to use epoxy resins that contain silanes,<br>
polyalkylsiloxanes, or chemically bonded fluoroalkyl groups. Most preferable of the above<br>
are crystalline-type resins, biphenyl-type epoxy resins, bisphenol A-type epoxy resins,<br>
bisphenol F-type epoxy resins, stilbene-type epoxy resins, biphenyl ether-type epoxy<br>
resins, and biphenylsulfonic-type epoxy resins. The following are specific examples of<br>
the above resins:<br>
biphenyl-type epoxy resin of the following general formula:<br><br><br>
bisphenol A-type epoxy resin of the following general formula:<br><br>
[0031] In the above formulae, R's may be the same or different and may designate<br>
hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups. R's as alkyl groups can be represented by methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, and tert-butyl groups. In the above formulae, "n" is a<br>
positive integer. The crystalline-type epoxy resin can be exemplified by biphenyl-type<br>
epoxy resin that improves moldability of the composition and imparts flame resistance to a<br>
cured body of the composition. Such biphenyl-type epoxy resin can be exemplified by 4,4'-<br>
bis (2,3- epoxypropoxy) biphenyl, 4,4'-bis (2,3-epoxypropoxy)-3,3',5,5'-<br>
tetramethylbiphenyl, 4,4'-bis (2,3-epoxypropoxy)-3,3',5,5'-te1xaethylbiphenyl, and 4,4'-bis<br>
(2,3-epoxypropoxy)-3,3',5,5'-tetrabutylbiphenyl. An example of the above resins may be a<br>
product (YX4000HK) commercially available, e.g., from Yukα-Shell Epoxy Co.<br><br>
[0032] The following are specific examples of phenol resins: polyvinylphenol-type<br>
phenol resin, phenolnovolac-type phenol resin, cresolnovolac-type phenol resin, biphenol-<br>
type phenol resin, biphenolaralkyl-type phenol resin, naphthol-type phenol resin, terpene-<br>
type phenol resin, phenoldicyclopentadiene-type phenol resin, phenolaralkyl-type phenol<br>
resin, naphtholaralkyl-type phenol resin, triphenolalkane-type phenol resin,<br>
dicyclopentadiene-type phenol resin, cresol-naphthol co-condensation-type phenol resin,<br>
xylene-naphthol co-condensation-type phenol resin, phenol resin based on heavy oil or<br>
pitch-type raw material. In order to improve water-repellant properties and reduce stress<br>
in a cured body of the composition, it is recommended to use phenol resins having<br>
chemically bonded fluoroalkyl groups or combined with silanes or polyalkylsiloxanes.<br>
There are no restrictions with regard to the types of phenol resins which may be<br>
phenolaralkyl-type or phenol-type, naphthol-type, novolac-type, etc. From the viewpoint<br>
of improved flame-retarding properties in the cured body of the composition, the<br>
phenolaralkyl-type phenol resin is preferable. Such phenolaralkyl-type phenol resins can<br>
be represented by the following compounds:<br>
phenolaralkyl-type phenol resin represented by the following general formula:<br><br>
phenolaralkyl-type phenol resin represented by the following general formula:<br><br>
phenolaralkyl-type phenol resin represented by the following general formula:<br>
  and<br><br>
phenolaralkyl-type phenol resin represented by the following general formula:<br><br>
[0033] In the above formulae, "n" is a positive integer. An example of such<br>
phenolaralkyl-type resins is one commercially produced (XLC-3L) by Mitsui Chemicals,<br>
Inc.<br>
[0034] Curable resin compositions may be compounded by combining epoxy and<br>
phenol resins. Epoxy resins suitable for such compounding may be comprised of<br>
crystalline phenol-type epoxy resins that are preferable for improving moldability of the<br>
composition, while phenol resins may be represented by phenolaralkyl-type phenol resin.<br>
There are no special restrictions with regard to the proportions in which epoxy and phenol<br>
resins can be combined, but it can be recommended to combine them in such a proportion<br>
that the ratio of epoxy-functional groups to phenol-functional groups be in the range of 0.5<br>
to 2.5. Furthermore, the premixed epoxy and phenol resins can be further combined with<br>
component (II) during the mixing step of the process.<br>
[0035] Component (II) is the aforementioned silicone resin composition that<br>
improves flame resistance of a cured body obtained by curing the curable resin<br>
composition without decreasing moldability. The aforementioned silicone resin<br>
compositions are the same as those mentioned above.<br>
[0036] There are no special restrictions with regard to the amounts in which<br>
component (II) can be added to the curable resin composition of the invention. For<br>
example, it can be added in an amount of 0.1 to 500, preferably 0.1 to 100, and even more<br>
preferably 0.5 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of component (I).<br>
[0037] Within the limits that are not contradictory to the purposes of the invention, the<br>
composition of the invention may also be combined with some arbitrary components such<br>
as inorganic fillers (III). Examples of the aforementioned inorganic fillers (IE) are the<br>
following: glass fiber, mineral fiber, alumina fiber, ceramic fiber that contains alumina<br>
and silica as components, boron fiber, zirconia fiber, silicon carbide fiber, metal fiber, or<br>
other fibrous filler; fused silica, crystalline silica, precipitated silica, fumed silica, baked<br><br>
silica, zinc oxide, baked clay, carbon black, glass beads, alumina, talc, calcium carbonate,<br>
clay, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, barium sulfate, titanium dioxide,<br>
aluminum nitride, boron nitride, silicon carbide, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide,<br>
titanium oxide, beryllium oxide, kaolin, mica, zirconium, or other powdered fillers.<br>
These fillers can be used in combinations of two or more. Although there are special<br>
restrictions with regard to the average particle size and shape of the particles of component<br>
(IET), from the viewpoint of improved moldability, it is recommended to use spherical silica<br>
with an average particle size in the range of 0.1 to 40 µm.<br>
[0038] There are no special restrictions with regard to the amounts in which<br>
component (III) can be used in the composition of the invention, but, in general, it can be<br>
recommended to add this component in an amount of 400 to 1200 parts by weight per 100<br>
parts by weight of the sum of the components (I) and (II). If component (III) is added in<br>
an amount below the lower recommended limit, the cured resin will be obtained with an<br>
increased coefficient of thermal expansion, and either cracks will develop in such a<br>
material because of stress, or the flame-resistant properties will be impaired. If, on the<br>
other hand, the added amount exceeds the upper recommended limit, the moldability of the<br>
obtained composition will worsen.<br>
[0039] In order to improve dispersibility of component (III) in component (I) or to<br>
improve affinity between component (I) and component (III), the composition may<br>
incorporate a coupling agent such as a silane coupling agent, titanate coupling agent, etc.<br>
The silane coupling agent can be exemplified by 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-<br>
glycidoxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane, 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyltrimethoxysilane, or<br>
similar epoxy-containing alkoxysilanes; N-(2-aminoethyI)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, N-phenyl-3-arnmopropyltrimethoxysilane, or similar amino-<br>
containing alkoxysilanes; 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, or similar mercapto-<br>
containing alkoxysilanes. The titanate-coupling agents can be exemplified by i-<br>
propoxytitanium tri(i-isostearate).<br>
[0040] In order to accelerate curing of component (I), the composition of the invention<br>
may incorporate a curing-acceleration agent. Such an agent may be represented by<br>
triphenylphosphine, tributylphosphine, tri(p-methylphenyl) phosphine, tri(nonylphenyl)<br>
phosphine, triphenylphosphine-triphenylborate, tetraphenylphosphine-tetraphenylborate, or<br>
similar phosphorous-type compounds; triethylamine, benzyldimethylamine, α-<br>
methylbenzyldimethylamine, 1,8-diazobicyclo [5.4.0] undecα-7-ene, or similar tertiary<br><br>
amine compounds; 2-methylimidazole, 2-phenylimidazole, 2-phenyl-4-methylimidazole,<br>
or similar imidazol compounds.<br>
[0041] If necessary, the composition of the invention may incorporate thermoplastic<br>
resins, thermoplastic elastomers, organic synthetic rubbers, silicone-type compounds, or<br>
similar stress-lowering agents; carnauba wax, higher fatty acids, synthetic waxes, or<br>
similar waxes; carbon black, or similar coloring agents; halogen-trapping agents, or the<br>
like.<br>
[0042] There are no special restrictions with regard to the method which can be used<br>
for preparing the composition of the invention. The composition can be prepared by<br>
uniformly mixing component (I) and component (II) with other arbitrary components.<br>
When component (III) is used as an arbitrary component, it can be added to and mixed,<br>
with component (I), and then the mixture can be combined with component (II) and with<br>
other arbitrary components and uniformly mixed therewith. In this case, a coupling agent<br>
can be added to components (I) and (III), and then the composition can be prepared by<br>
integral blending, or component (III) can be preliminarily surface-treated with the coupling<br>
agent and then combined with component (I). Equipment suitable for the preparation of<br>
the composition of the invention may be represented by a single-shaft or double-shaft-type<br>
continuous mixer, two-roll-type mill, Ross mixer®, and a kneader mixer.<br>
[0043] The curable resin composition of the invention demonstrates excellent<br>
flowability prior to curing, and perfect flame-retarding properties in a cured resin obtained<br>
by curing the composition. Therefore, it can be used as an adhesive agent, a coating agent,<br>
a coating material, or a sealing resin composition for electrical and electronic parts and can<br>
be applied by transfer molding, injection molding, potting, casting, powder coating,<br>
dipping or dripping. The most suitable application for the curable resin composition of the<br>
invention is the sealing of semiconductor devices by means of a transfer press.<br>

examples. Values of viscosity given in the example were measured at 25°C. In the<br>
formulae, "Me" designates a methyl group, "Ph" designates a phenyl group, "Ep"<br>
designates a 3-glycidoxypropyl group, and "Pr" designates an isopropyl group.<br>

tested material turned into liquid drops when it was heated in a micro-melting point<br>
apparatus of Yanagimoto factory with a heating rate of 1 °C/min.<br>
-	Melt Viscosity: This characteristic was determined with the use of a programmable<br>
rheometer (Model DV-III, the product of Brookfield Co,. Inc., USA) by heating the<br>
silicone resin from room temperature with the heating rate of 2°C/min and defining the<br>
sought characteristic as a viscosity obtained after holding the sample for 20 min. at 100°C,<br>
120°C and 140°C.<br>

[0046] Characteristics of the curable resin composition and of the cured resin obtained<br>
by curing the composition were also measured by the methods described below. The<br>
aforementioned composition was subjected to molding in a transfer press for 2 min. at a<br>
temperature of 175°C and under a pressure of 70 kgf/cm2, and then the obtained product<br>
was post-cured for 5 hours at 180°C.<br>

a specimen having a thickness of 1/16 inch (about 1.6 mm) was measured with the use of<br>
an oxygen-index tester in accordance with JIS K 7201 (Testing Method for Flammability of<br>
Polymeric Materials Using Oxygen Index Method). The concentration was determined as<br>
an average value obtained on 5 specimens.<br>
-	Burning Time: Burning time (in seconds) was measured as an average value for 5<br>
specimens having a thickness of 1/16 inch (about 1.6 mm). The test was carried out in<br>
accordance with UL94 Standard (Underwriters Laboratory, Inc., USA: Standard for<br>
Testing Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts and Appliances).<br>
[Reference Example 1]<br>
[0047] 250 g of water and 400 g of toluene were loaded into a 2000 ml flask equipped<br>
with a thermometer and a reflux cooler, and while the contents were cooled in an icy bath,<br><br>
they was combined with a mixture of 300 g of phenyltrichlorosilane and 200 g of toluene<br>
added dropwise. Upon completion of the addition of the mixture, the contents were<br>
refluxed with heating for 6 hours, and then the toluene solution was separated. The<br>
toluene solution was washed with water, and the washing procedure was repeated till<br>

Stark trap, and a reflux condenser. The contents were then combined with 10.0 g of water,<br>
and heated. The obtained methanol and water were removed by distillation. Upon<br>
completion of distillation of water, the system was cooled, combined with another 10.0 g<br>

then refluxing with heating was carried out for 6 hours. After cooling, the system was<br>
neutralized by adding 0.08 g of acetic acid. The product was washed three times with 80<br>
ml of water. The obtained toluene solution was poured into a 500 ml flask equipped with a<br>
Dean-Stark trap and was subjected to azeotropic removal. Impurities were removed by<br>
filtering. The toluene was removed via distillation by heating the filtrate in vacuum. The<br>
resulting product was comprised of 140 g of a colorless solid substance. The obtained<br>
substance had a weight-average molecular weight of 2600, a softening point of 73 °C, and<br>
an epoxy equivalent of 1620. 29Si-NMR spectral analysis confirmed that the substance<br>
was comprised of a silicone resin represented by the following average unit formula:<br><br>
Relative to the total content of the silicon-bonded organic group, the aforementioned<br>
silicone resin contained 7 mole % of 3-glycidoxypropyl groups and 64 mole % of phenyl<br>
groups.<br>
