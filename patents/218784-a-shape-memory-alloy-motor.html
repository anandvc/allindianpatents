Fig. 12 Is a graph showing the relationship between various forces in Newton and the distance of displacement of a piston pump plunger in mm by the actuator shown in Figs, 5-7.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2, a pivotable body in the form of a circular disc 1 is arranged for pivoting around a central pivot 2 fixedly attached to a not shown frame of the actuator, and the disc 1 is provided with a peripheral extension 3 and a yoke-like peripheral extension 5. A tension coB spring 6 is at one end thereof plvotably attached to a fastening pin 7 fixedly attached to said frame and is at the other end thereof pivotabty attached to a fastening pin 8 fixedly attached to the peripheral extension 3.<br>
Two wires or filaments 9 and 10 of a shape memory alloy such as nickel titanium alloy or nitinof, for instance supplied by the company DYNALLOY, INC, of Costa Mesa, California, USA, under the trade name FLEXINOL, are attached at one end thereof to electrically conductive terminals 11 and 12, respectively, fixedly attached to said frame.<br><br>
The other end of each of the wires 9 and 10 is attached to an electrically conductive terminal 13 fixedly attached to the periphery of the disc 1. The wires 9 and 10 extend along the periphery of the disc 1 such that the wires 9 and 10 when tensioned extend along and are supported by said periphery. In the drawings the wires 9 and 10 are shown spaced from said periphery for the sake of clarity.<br>
A sliding body 14 having two arms 15 and 16 is arranged for sliding movement between two stop pins 17 and 18 attached to the frame. A pin 19 attached to the sliding body 14 is received In the fork 5a of the yoke-like extension 5 such that the pin 19 may slide and rotate freely in the fork when the disc 1 pivots from the position shown in Fig. 1 to the position shown in Fig. 2 thereby sfidingry displacing the body 14 from abutment against stop pin 18 to abutment against stop pin 17 with the arm 15, constituting the activating pin of the actuator, fully extended.<br>
A proximity sensor 20 is attached to the frame and connected to not shown electrical conductors for transmitting a signal from the sensor to a not shown receiver. The terminals 11 and 12 are likewise each connected to an electrical conductor, not shown, connected to a not shown power source for supplying electrical power to the wires 9 and 10 for resistance heating thereof, the terminal 13 being likewise connected to the not shown power source through a not shown electrical conductor for closing the resistance heating circuit.<br>
In use, the wires 9 and 10 are intermittently heated to the transformation or transition temperature {from martensitic to austenftic state) of the shape memory alloy which temperature for nrtinol is approximately 90 °C. Thereby the length of the wire is shortened. When the wire coots to beiow 90 "C the length thereof reverts to normal, i.e. the wire lengthens. The speed at which the shortening takes place, I.e. the contraction time, is directly related to the current input i.e. the voltage applied over the terminals 11 or 12 and 13.<br>
in the position depicted in Fig. 1, the intermediate disc 1 is in its outermost counter dock-wise position with the arm 15 fully retracted and with the wire 9 cooled to below 90 *C and the wire 10 heated to above 90 *C by applying an electrical voltage between the terminal 12 and 13 whereby an electrical current will flow through the wire 10. The disc 1 has therefore been rotated counter clock-wise to the position shown by the contraction force exerted by the wire 10.<br><br>
In the next step, the wire 10 Is cooled to below 90 °C and thereby lengthens to the shape indicated by the dotted line 10a in Fig. t. The actuator is now ready to perform an activating extension of the arm 15 towards the left, the end of the arm 15 being intended to come into contact with a not shown lever, plunger, button or the like and depress or activate same during the movement of the arm 15 to the extended leftwards position thereof as depicted in Fig. 2.<br>
Thereafter or simultaneously, the wire 9 is heated to above 90 °C whereby it contracts and exerts a clock-wise force on the disc 1 pivoting It clock-wise around the pivot 2 past the balance position of the disc 1 and spring 6 in which the attachment pins 7 and S of the spring 6 are aligned with the pivot 2.<br>
When the disc 1 has rotated clock-wise past said balance point, the tension force exerted by the spring 7 will continue the clock-wise rotation of the disc 1 to the position shown in Fig- 2 with the arm 15 fully extended and the wire 9 slack though still above 90 °C. This is the actual activating movement of the actuator where the force applied to the sliding body 14 by the extension 5 increases because of the increasing lever of force or moment arm of the tension force exerted by the spring 6 on the intermediate disc 1 with respect to the pivot 2 or axis of rotation of the disc 1.<br>
For many applications where the force necessary to perform the function of the actuator, for instance depress a pump piston, increases during the activating stroke, said increase of the spring force moment arm as the disc 1 rotates is a very advantageous feature as will be explained more in detail in connection with Figs 11 and 12 in the following.<br>
An increase of the activating force of the actuator during the activating stroke Is also achieved or enhanced by decreasing the distance of the pin 19 from the pivot 2 or axis of rotation of the disc 1 during the activating stroke whereby the moment arm or lever of force of the displacement force exerted on the pin 19 by the yoke-like extension 5 with respect to the pivot 2 is decreased and thereby the displacement force is increased during the activating stroke. This shortening of said distance can be seen from the situation In Fig. 1 at the beginning of the activation stroke to the situation in Fig. 2 at the end of the activation stroke.<br><br>
Finally, the wire 10 Is heated above 90 °C so that it contracts and pivots the disc 1 back to the position shown in Fig. 1 whereby the activating cycle is ready to be repeated.<br>
 The length of the wire 10 is larger than the length of the wire 9 because the contraction or shortening of the wire 10 must be large enough to pivot the disc 1 from the position shown in Fig. 2 past the balance point mentioned above while the shortening of the wire 9 only has to be enough the pivot the disc 1 from the position shown in Fig. 1 past said balance point<br><br>
Nitinol wires will typically contract about 3% ~ 6% when heated past the transition temperature. The uncontracted length of the wire 10 should be enough to ensure that the uncontracted wire is fully extended in the position shown in Fig. 2 and that the contracted wire 10 is fully extended when the disc 1 is at least slightly past said balance point in the counter-clockwise direction, i.e. the uncontracted length of wire 10 should be about 22-25 times the distance of travel of terminal 13 between the Rg. 2 position thereof and the balance point position thereof.<br>
The necessary contraction force to be exerted by wires 9 and 10 are rather different | because the contraction force of wire 9 only has to counteract the torque or moment oF the spring force of spring 6 with the relatively small torque arm in Fig. 1 while the contraction force of wire 10 has to counteract the considerably larger torque of said spring force in Fig. 2 The contraction force of a nitinol wire is larger the larger the diameter or cross sectional area of the wire. The cross sectional area of wire 10 Is thus considerably larger than the cross sectional area of wire 9 or there may be a number of wires 10 with the same cross sectional area.<br>
The latter possibility is chosen if it is necessary that the cooling-off time for the wires 10 is as short of possfole so that the interval between the activating cycles may be as short as possible. Several small diameter wires with a certain total cross sectional area wilt cool more rapidly than a single larger diameter wire with the same cross sectional area.<br>
The signal emitted by the proximity sensor 20 each time the extension 3 is in the position shown in Fig 2 may be utilized for many different purposes such as for instance a mere monitoring of the correct function of the actuator or for controlling the<br><br>
timing of the heating of the wires 9 and 10 and thereby the timing of the activating stroke of the sliding body 14. Naturally, the location of the proximity sensor or of any other type of sensor for sensing the position of the disc 1 may be varied according to the purpose thereof, and several such sensors may be provided in different locations for instance for achieving a more complex control of the timing of the activating effect of the actuator.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 3, this embodiment differs from the embodiment of Figs. 1-2 in that a double activating effect may be achieved for each cycle of heating and cooling the shape memory wires 21 and 22 that in this case are of equal length and cross sectional area The rotation of the disc 1 counter-clockwise and clockwise is limited by stop pins 23 and 24, respectively.<br>
The activating member may be a sliding body simlar to body 14 in Fig. 1-2 where both the arm 15 and the arm 16 perform an activating function, or the activating function may be a pull/push activation by for instance arm 15.<br>
The disc 1 may alternatively be provided with a central torsion shaft projecting at right angles to the plane of the disc 1 as a prolongation of the pivot 2 such that the torsion shaft functions as the activating member by for instance rotating a lever to and fro. Many different types of activating members connected to the disc 1 will be obvious to those skilled in the art.<br>
In the position shown in Fig. 3, the disc 1 has just performed an activating rotation counter-clockwise under the influence of the counter-clockwise torque of the force of the spring 6 and is ready for the initiation of a rotation clockwise by heating the wire 21 so that the disc 1 is rotated against the counter-clockwise torque of the spring force until the balance point is passed. Then the activating rotation clockwise is performed by the clockwise torque of the spring force. Also in this embodiment the moment arm of the activating force of the spring 6 increases during the activating stroke in both directions.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4, the terminal 13 of the embodiments of Ftgs 1-3 has been substituted by a combined terminal and abutment member 28 for abutting the stop pins 24 and 25. Furthermore, another type of biasing means is utilized, namely a piston and cylinder mechanism  comprising  a pressurized cylinder 24 pivotably<br><br>
attached to pin 7, a piston 26 and a piston rod 27 pivofably attached to the disc 1 by means of a pin 27.<br>
The piston and cylinder mechanism 24-25 functions like a compression spring and could in fact be substituted by a compression spring. In Fig. 4 the disc 1 is in the balance point position where the pin 7, the pin 27 and the pivot 2 are aligned such that the pressure exerted on the disc 1 by the piston rod 25 does not produce any torque on the disc 1. In the situation shown In Fig. 4, the wire 22 is contracting and rotating the disc counter-clockwise past the balance point As soon as the balance point has been passed, the torque from the piston rod 25 will cause the activating counter¬clockwise rotation of the disc 1 until the member 2B abuts the stop pin 23 whereupon a clockwise rotation may be initiated in a manner very similar to that described above in relation to Fig. 3.<br>
The tension spring 6 in Figs. 1-2 could also be substituted by a piston and cylinder mechanism or a compression spring in an arrangement similar to Fig. 4.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 5-7 an activating body 30 is arranged linearly displaoeable in the directions of arrows R1 and R2 under the influence of a shape memory alloy wire 31 and a two-armed lever 32.<br>
One end of the wire 31 is attached to the body 30 at 33 and the other end is attached to a fixed portion 37a of a not shown frame of the actuator, the wire 31 extending around a pulley 34 pivotably arranged on a slide 35 disptaceable in the directions of the arrows R1 and R2. A compression spring 36 is arranged between the body 30 and the slide 35 and extends through a passage through a fixed portion 37 of said frame.<br>
The two-armed (ever 32 is arranged pivatable around a pivot 33, one arm 39 of the lever abutting a pin 40 on the body 30 and the other arm 41 of the lever being attached at 42 to one end of a tension spring 43, the other end being attached to a fixed portion 44 of said frame such that displacement of the body 30 in the direction of arrow R1 tensions the spring 43 via rotation of the intermediate lever 32.<br>
A pawl or hook element 45 is arranged pivotable around a pivot 46 such that a hook or projection 47 of the hook element 45 may be received in a matching recess 46 in the body 30. A shape memory alloy wire 49 is at one end attached to the hook element 45<br><br>
and at the other end attached to a fixed portion 50 of said "frame. A compression spring 51 is arranged between the fixed portion 50 and the hook element 45<br>
In use, the body 30 is moved to and fro in the direction of the arrows R1 and R2 to    actuate a plunger, lever, button, contact and the like during the activating stroke of the body in the direction R1<br>
In Fig. 5 the wire 31 is cooled to below the transformation temperature of the alloy (for instance by sandwiching the wire between two aluminium rails coated with PTFE) and  is at its maximum length and is maintained taut by the biasing action of the compression spring 36. The hook 47 is received in the recess and holds the body 30 against the biasing force of the spring 43 transmitted to the pin 40 by means of the lever 32. The wire 49 is also In its cool state and at its maximum length.<br>
 When the activating stroke is to be initiated, the wire 49 Is heated to the transformation temperature and shortens or contracts, thereby pivoting the hook element 45 against the biasing force of the spring 51 such that the hook 47 is pulled out of the recess 48 to the release position shown in Fig. 6. The body 30 is thus released for displacement in direction R1 under the influence of the lever 32 pivoted by the spring 43.<br>
During the activating stroke of body 30 in direction R1 the lever or moment arm of the force exerted by the spring 43 relative to the pivot 38 or the axis of rotation of the lever 32 Increases such that the displacement force exerted on the pin 40 by the arm 39 increases as the body 30 is displaced in the direction R1.<br>
Likewise, during the activating stroke by the body 30 in direction R1, the lever or moment arm of the displacement force exerted by the arm 39 on the pin 40 relative to the pivot 38 decreases whereby said displacement force increases as the body 30 is displaced En the direction R1<br>
When the slide 35 abuts the fixed frame portion 37, the activating stroke in direction R1 will be stopped as shown in Fig. 6. In practice the activating stroke preferably is stopped by the resistance to the activating stroke of the body 30 by the object being activated such that the stroke Is stopped before the slide 35 abuts the fixed frame _,    portion 37.<br><br>
So as to cock the actuator again, the wire 49 is cooled to allow the spring 51 to pivot the hook element 45 towards the holding position thereof white the wire 31 is heated untill it shortens and thereby causes the slide 35 to abut the fixed frame portion 37 and the pulley 34 to rotate clock-wise while the body 30 Is displaced in the direction R2 against the force of the spring 43 that thereby is lengthened while the lever 32 pivots counter clock-wise. When the body 30 has reached the position shown in Fig. 7, the hook 47 is pressed into the recess 48 and the wire 31 may then be cooled so that the situation in Fig. 5 Is re-established ready to initiate a new activation cycle of the actuator<br>
During the tensioning of the spring 43, the force exerted by the wire 31 necessary for this tensioning is largest at the beginning of the displacement of the body 30 In the direction R2 because of the large moment arm of the force of the spring 43 and the small moment arm of the rotation force of the pin 40 on the arm 39, and the force exerted by the wire 31 decreases as the body 30 is displaced in the direction R2. This is an advantageous development of the force in the wire 31 during the cocking of the actuator as will be explained more in detail in the following in connection with Figs, 11 and 12.<br>
By adapting the actuator according to the invention such that the activating stroke is performed by a force exerted by a biasing means, a further advantage is obtained In that any blocking of the activating stroke of the activating body, for Instance because the activated object such as a pump plunger is blocked, wiH only entail that the activation stroke is stopped with no damage to the SMA wire. If the activating stroke were carried out under the influence el a shortening of a shape memory alloy wire, said wire would probably be damaged or snapped if the activating stroke were blocked.<br>
The extra length of the wire 31 obtained by means of the pulley 34 is advantageous for giving a longer activating stroke with a compact construction of the actuator.<br>
The heating of the wires 31 and 49 is preferably carried out In a manner similar to the heating of the wires 9 and 10 in Figs 1-2 by means of not shown electrically conductive connections of the ends thereof to a power source.<br><br>
Referring now to Fig. 8, a toothed wheel or gear 55 is rotatably arranged on a power output shaft 56 journalist in a not shown frame of the actuator motor. A body 57 having an edge portion 58 fitting between two neighbouring teeth 59 of the gear 55 is arranged in said frame displaceable between the position shown in full lines and the     position shown in dotted lines.<br>
A shape memory alloy wire 60 is at one end attached to the body 57 and at the other end to a fixed portion 61 of said frame. A coiled flat or wire spring 62 integral with or connected to an arm 63 is attached to said frame such that said arm 63 may pivot i around one end thereof opposite the free end thereof. The arm 63 abuts a pin 64 on the body 57.<br>
A pawl 65 is pivotebly arranged on a pivot 66 and is biased by a tension spring 67 so as to constantly abut the rim of the gear 55.<br>
i<br>
In use, the gear 55 fs turned clock-wise by the body 57 being displaced from the full line position to the dotted line position thereof by the force of the spring 62 acting through the intermediate arm 63 on the pin 64, whereby the gear advances the width of one tooth 59 and the pawl 65 moves from locking engagement between one pair of teeth 59 to a locking position between the next pair of teeth in the counter clock-wise direction.<br>
When the gear is locked against rotating counter dock-wise by the pawl 65, the SMA wire 60 is heated and shortens whereby the body is displaced from the dotted line position to the full line position against the force of the intermediate arm 63 on the pin 64 thereby cocking the spring 62.<br>
The lever or moment arm of the displacement force exerted by the intermediate arm in the clock-wise direction with respect to the pivoting point of the arm decreases as the body is displaced in the activating direction from the full line position to the dotted line position whereby the displacement force exerted by the intermediate arm 63 on the pin 64 increases.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 9, a SMA actuator motor similar to the motor of Fig. 8 is shown, the spring 62 and intermediate arm 63 being substituted by a tension spring 68 fastened to the body 57 and to a fixed portion 69 of a not shown frame.<br><br>
The operation of the motor of Fig. 9 is very similar to the one in Fig. 8 except that the displacement force exerted on the body 57 by the spring 66 is exerted directly and declines substantially proportionally with the distance of displacement.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 10, a rack 70 is arranged disptaceabie in a not shown frame in the direction R4 and a body 71 is arranged displaceabie in the directions R3 and R4 as well as transversely thereto A SMA wire 72 is attached to the body 71 and to a fixed portion 73 of said frame. A coil spring 74 attached to said frame and integral with or connected to an intermediate arm 75 exerts a displacement force on a pin 76 of the body 71 through the intermediate arm 75 in a manner very similar to spring 62 in Fig. 8.<br>
The rack 70 advances the distance of the width of one tooth 78 thereof in the direction R4 for every cycle of heating and cooling of the SMA wire 72 In the same way as gear 55 in Fig. 5 is rotated by wire 60, spring 62, intermediate arm 63 and body 57 in Fig. 8-<br>
The rack 70 may be used to push an object by means of front end 77, for instance a piston in a cylinder to empty said cylinder of liquid or paste through an aperture in said cylinder.<br>
Means to displace the body 71 transversely to the rack 70 may be provided for allowing the rack 1o be displaced in the direction R3 for repeating the pushing travel of the rack 70 in the direction R4.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 11, the curve or line 80 Indicates the relationship between the force exerted by the SMA wire 60 in Fig. 9 on the body 57 as a function of the contraction or shortening thereof. The force increases proportionally with the contraction because of the proportional Increase of the spring force of the spring 68 when it is stretched by contraction of the wire 60.<br>
The line or curve 81 is symbolic of the curves corresponding to the relationship between contraction and force exerted for (he embodiments of Figs. 1-8 and 9 where the force in the wires 10, 22, 24 31,60 and 72, respectively is largest at the beginning of the contraction or shortening, and the contraction length of the wire is much larger because of the variation In the length of the moment arm or arms during the activating stroke as described above.<br><br>
In this manner, a high coefficient of mechanical efficiency is obtained because the longer contraction distance for a given Input of energy to heat the SMA wires gives an increased input of energy into the activating system.<br>
The actual curves 81 will not be linear but will reflect the varying rate of change of the moment arm or moment arms during the activating stroke.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 12 and Figs 5-7, an actuator as shown in Figs. 5-7 Is applied to operate a piston pump by depressing the plunger thereof with the body 30<br>
The pump piston plunger and body 30 travel from 0.2mm to 3.4mm during the activating stroke of the body 30. The force required to displace the plunger increases substantially proportionally from approx. D.5 N to approx. 2N where the force increases steeply because the plunger has reached the end of its path.<br>
The force exerted by the spring 43 on the body 30 and thus the plunger develops as an increasing parable-like curve corresponding to the curve for the tension or force in the SMA wire 31 necessary to retract the body 30 against the leveraged force of the spring 43.<br>
It is clear that the curves show that the actuator according to the invention can produce an increasing force as the displacement increases which is very advantageous in many applications such as pumping with piston pumps where the force required increases with the distance travelled by the plunger.<br><br><br>
