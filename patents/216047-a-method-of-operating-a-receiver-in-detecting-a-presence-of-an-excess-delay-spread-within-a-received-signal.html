EXCESS DELAY SPREAD DETECTION METHOD<br>
FOR MULTI-CARRIER COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS<br>
5<br>
	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
		The present invention generally rebates to the field of communication<br>
	systems. More Specifically, the invention relates to a method for detecting the<br>
10 	presence of an excess delay spread in communication systems.<br>
	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
		Orthogonal Frequency Division Multipiaxing (OFDM) systems generally<br>
	include a cyclic extension (or guard interval) with each transmitted OFDM<br>
	symbol. The cyclic extension is intended to eliminate inter-symbol and<br>
15 	inter-carrier interference in delay spread channels. However, if the channel<br>
	impulse response is longer than the cyclic extension, the portion of the<br>
	impulse response that is outside the extension causes self-interference.<br>
		Delay spread detection circuits exist in the art to estimate the delay<br>
	spread in a radio frequency signal. Most of the existing delay spread sensors<br>
20 	are designed for single-carrier systems. For example, a prior art delay spread<br>
	estimator disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 5,602,484 A1 detects the<br>
	presence of an excess delay spread after estimating the channel by an<br>
	implementation of a matched filter operation. Another prior art delay spread<br>
	estimator disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication NO. 6,028,901 A1 implements a<br>
25 	matched filter operation to estimate the channel and extract the channel's<br>
	impulse response. However, for multi-carrier systems, a process of channel<br>
	estimation as proposed by the art is computationally intensive, because it<br>
	invokes a fast Fourier transform ("FFT") followed by an inverse fast Fourier<br>
	transform ("IFTT") to extract the channel impulse response.<br><br>
WO 2004/051913								PCT/US2003/038866<br>

		The present invention advances the art by a contribution of a method<br>
	and a receiver for detecting the presence of an excess delay spread in<br>
	communication systems.<br>
5<br>
	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
		The present invention is a method for operating a receiver in detecting<br>
	a presence of an excess delay spread in a received signal. The received<br>
	signal originates from a transmitter that occasionally or periodically transmits<br>
10 	a signal having two or more adjacent segments that are very similar.<br>
		In a first form of the method, a quantitative estimation of a similarity of<br>
	two segments of a received signal is calculated and the presence or an<br>
	absence of an excess delay spread in the received signal based upon the<br>
	quantitative estimation is subsequently determined.<br>
15 		In a second form of the method, the quantitative estimation is<br>
	performed, and the presence or the absence of an excess delay spread in the<br>
	received signal based upon a comparison of the quantitative estimation and a<br>
	detection threshold is subsequently determined.<br>
		The foregoing forms as well as other forms, features and advantages<br>
20 	of the invention will become further apparent from the following detailed<br>
	description of the presently preferred embodiments, read in conjunction with<br>
	the accompanying drawings. The detailed description and drawings are<br>
	merely illustrative of the inventon rather than limiting, the scope of the<br>
	invention being defined by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.<br><br>

	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE<br>
25 	PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
		The preferred embodiment of the invention relates to multicarrier<br>
	communication systems such as, for example, orthogonal frequency division<br>
	multiplexing ("OFDM") and OFDM variants (e.g. spread OFDM), and can also<br>
	be used with other types of modulation methods that use a cyclie prefix and/or<br>
30 	postfix. An exemplary OFDM symbol 10 with a cyclic prefix and a postfix is<br>
	frustrated in FIG. 1. Furthermore, a prior art OFDM synchronization symbol<br><br>
WO 2004/051913								PCT/US2003/038866<br>
-4-<br>
	format can be used by a transmitter to transmit a signal with two identical<br>
	segments as exemplary illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
		FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary OFDM transmitter components. In the<br>
	form of an IFFT 20 and a paralIel-to-serial converter ("PSC") 21 for generating<br>
5 	a synchronization symbol periodically as known in the art. The<br>
	synchronization symbol consists of a sequence of either known or unknown<br>
	data symbols DS1-DSx transmitted on the even numbered OFDM sub-<br>
	carriers, and null symbols NS1-NSx transmitted on the unused odd-numbered<br>
	OFDM sub-carriers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that additional null<br>
10 	symbols can be included on subcarriers near the edges of the channel<br>
	bandwidth to provide a frequency guard band to simplify practical<br>
	implementation issues. These additional null symbols near the band edges<br>
	do not affect the similarity properties as subsequently described herein.<br>
		The data symbols DS1-DSx, interlaced with the null symbols NS1-NSx<br>
15 	yield a transmitted baud waveform BW. In the absence of an excess delay<br>
	spread, the baud waveform BW as received by an OFDM receiver 30 will<br>
	include two identical segments (e.g., a segment FH1 and a segment SH1<br>
	illustrated in<br>
	FIG. 3) having a similarity that is preserved after propagating over a<br>
20 	communication medium to the receiver 30 (ignoring noise). However, when<br>
	an excess delay spread is present, the baud waveform BW as received by the<br>
	receiver 30 will include two dissimilar segments (e.g., a first segment FH2 and<br>
	a second segment SH2 exemplary illustrated in FIG. 4),<br>
	Specifically, assuming that the symbol duration is L and the FFT size is N, the<br>
25 	guard interval is (L-N). This guard interval is also known as a cyclic<br>
	extension, which can be a cyclic prefix, cyclic postfix, or a split cyclic<br>
	extension consisting of both a cyclic prefix and postfix. For purposes of<br>
	facilitating an understanding of the invention, the various embodiments<br>
	described herein are based on a split cyclic extension as illustrated in FIG. 1,<br>
30 	FIG. 3 and FIG. 4. Also, the descriptions are based on a length of a channel<br>
	impulse response (a.k.a. delay spread) being M and the channel impulse<br>
	response being causal with discrete samples from 0 to M-1. From the<br><br>
WO 2004/051913								PCT/US2003/038866<br>
-5-<br>
	descriptions, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the<br>
	applicability of the invention to other cyclic extension types and to continuous-<br>
	time waveforms and channels. When M is less than the guard interval of L-N<br>
	samples (the maximum distortion-free delay spread for the received signal),<br>
5 	two similar portions of the baud wavefrom BW would be [(L-N+1) to (L-N/2)]<br>
	and [(L-N/2+1) to L]. In the present invention, it has been, determined that any<br>
	delay spread in excess of M samples would disturb the similarity properties of<br>
	the synchronization symbol in these portions. To make a decision on the<br>
	presence of delay spread beyond M samples, the OFDM receiver 30<br>
10 	implements an excess delay spread detection method in accordance witn the<br>
	present invention.<br>
		FIG. 5 Illustrates a flowchart 40 representative of the excess delay<br>
	spread detecton method of the present invention. During a stage S42 of the<br>
	flowchart 40, a signal which consists of data symbols DSt-DSx and the null<br>
15 	symbols NS1-NSx followed by the transformation and the conversion as<br>
	shown in FIG. 2, is received by the OFDM receiver 30 after passing through a<br>
	communication channel with the channel impulse response of length M.<br>
	During a stage S44 of the flowchart 40, one or more quantitative estimations<br>
	of a similarity of two segments of the received signal are performed by the<br>
20 	OFDM receiver 30. In one embodiment, a quantitative estimation method in<br>
	accordance with the present invention is implemented during stage S44.<br>
		FIG. 6 illustrates a flowchart 50 representative of the quantitative estimation<br>
	method of the present invention, During a stags S52 of the flowchart 50,<br>
25 	values of appropriate variables are determined and/or retrieved if they have<br>
	been previously determined. In a typical embodiment, the values for the<br>
	symbol duration L, FFT size N, and a small fraction m of N are predetermined<br>
	based on system parameters, and the values S(1), S(2), .... S(L), are the<br>
	signal samples of the received synchronizatiort symbol.<br>
30 		During a stags S54 of the flowchart 50, a quantitative estimation QE1, a<br>
	quantitative estimation QE2, or a quantitative estimation QE3 is calcutated. A<br><br>
WO 2004/051913								PCT/US2003/038866<br>
-6-<br>
	calculation of a quantitative estimation QE1 is executed in accordance with the<br>
	following equation [1]:<br><br>
5<br>
		In a preferred embodiment. P = 1, but other values including but not<br>
	limited to P = 2 or P- 4 can also be used. The quantitative estimation QE1 is<br>
	a numerical comparison of two portions or segments of the received signal<br>
	that are similar when there is no delay spread and dissimilar when there is<br>
10 	excess delay spread. The numerator in the equation [1] represents the mean<br>
	magnitude of the difference vector of length m samples beyond the beginning<br>
	(L-N) samples of the signal (guard interval). This quantity should be on the<br>
	order of the standard deviation of the noise in the received signal if there is no<br>
	excess delay spread, but will be much larger if there is excess delay spread.<br>
15 	The denominator represents the mean magnitude of the noise in the last m<br>
	samples of portions of the signal that remain similar. This is used as a<br>
	normalizing factor for the mean magnitude estimate of the difference vector in<br>
	the first m samples of the similar portions of the signal. The assumption is<br>
	that the delay spread is less than (L-(N/2)-m) and the last m samples of the<br>
20 	similar portions are uncorrupted. If there is no excess delay spread, the noise<br>
	corrupts the expected similarity of the numerator and denominator segments<br>
	of the signal equally and the quantitative estimation QE1 will be close to 0 d8;<br>
	if there is excess delay spread, the similarity of the numerator segments will<br>
	be corrupted by excess delay spread and noise to a greater extent than the<br>
25 	denominator segments corrupted by noise only, and the quantitative<br>
	estimation is expected to be larger than 0 d8.<br>
		The quantitative estimation QE2 is formulated to detect excess delay<br>
	spreads before the 0-th sample for a non-causal channel impulse response<br><br>
WO 2004/051913								PCT/US2003/038866<br>
-7-<br>
	encountered when the received signal synchronization is early. To detect<br>
	early excess delay spread assuming no late excess delay spread, a<br>
	calculation of quantitative estimation QE2 is executed in accordance with the<br>
	following equation [2];<br><br>
		In equation [2], the roles of the numerator and denominator of equation<br>
	[1] are reversed since the last m samples of the similar portions are corrupted<br>
	by early excess delay spread, white it is assumed no late excess delay spread<br>
10 	is present and hence the first m samples are uncorrupted,<br>
		The quantitative estimation QE3 is formulated to detect either early or<br>
	late excess delay spread. A calculation of quantitative estimation QE3 is<br>
	executed in accordance with the following equation [2]:<br>
15<br><br>
		where now the beginning of the expected similar portions is corrupted<br>
20 	by late excess delay spread if present, the end of the expected similar<br>
	portions is corrupted by early excess delay spread if present, and the center<br>
	of the expected similar portions is assumed corrupted by noise only and no<br>
	excess delay spread.<br>
		Note that the above quantitative estimations QE1-QE3 are formulated<br>
25 	based on an assumption that the transmitter transmitted a signal having two<br><br>
WO 2004/051913								PCT/US2003/038866<br>
-8-<br>
	identical segments. The invention can also handle the case where the two<br>
	segments of the transmitted signal are identical to within a complex constant,<br>
	as long as the constant is known at the receiver 30. For example, if the<br>
	frequency domain data symbols DSt-DSx are interleaved with the null<br>
5 	symbols NS1-NSx on the odd rather than the even subcarriers, the second<br>
	segment of the received signal will equal the negative of the first sagment in<br>
	the absence of excess delay spread and noise. The invention can either<br>
	compensate for the known constant prior to a calculation of one of the<br>
	quantitative estimations QE1-QE3, or the equations [1]- [3] can be modified to<br>
10 	take the constant into account.<br>
		Referring again to FIG. 5, during a stage S46 of the flowchart 40, a<br>
	presence or an absence of an excess delay spread within the received signal<br>
	is determined based on the quantitative estimation, in one embodiment, an<br>
	excess delay spread determination of the present invention is implemented<br>
15 	during the stage S46.<br>
		FIG. 7 illustrates a flowchart 60 representative, of the excess delay<br>
	spread detection method of the present invention. During a stage SS2 of the<br>
	flowchart 60, the quantitative estimation calculated during stage S54 (FIG. 6)<br>
	is compared to a corresponding detection threshold. In one embodiment, the<br>
20 	quantitative estimation QE1 is compared to a detection threshold THR1 when<br>
	quantitative estimation QE1 was calculated during stage S54, the quantitative<br>
	estimation QE2 is compared to a detection threshold THR2 when quantitative<br>
	estimation QE2 was calculated during stage S54, and/or the quantitative<br>
	estimation QE3 is compared to a detection threshold THR3 when quantitative<br>
25 	estimation QE3 was calculated during stage SS4.<br>
		The detection thresholds THR1-THR3 are preferably selected to<br>
	achieve a high probability of detection and a low probability of false alarm for<br>
	the types of channels and signal-to-(noise and interference) ratios expected<br>
	during system usage. The probability of detection is the probability of<br>
30 	detecting the presence of excess delay spread given that the channel has<br>
	excess delay spread and the probability of false alarm is the probability of<br>
	erroneously detecting the presence of excess delay spread given that the<br><br>
WO 2004/051913								PCT/US2003/038866<br>
-9-<br>
	channel has no excess delay spread. There is no limit to a numerical range of<br>
	the detection thresholds THR1-THR3. Furthermore, all of the detection<br>
	thresholds THR1-THR3 can be identical (e.g., 7 d8), or one or all three of the<br>
	detection thresholds THR1-THR3 can be different.<br>
5 		During a stage S64 of the flowchart 60, a presence of an excess delay<br>
	spread is assumed when the comparison of stage S62 determines the<br>
	calculated quantitative estimation is equal to or greater than a corresponding<br>
	detection threshold (i.e., QE1,  THR1 QE2 XXX THR2, and/or QE3  THR3).<br>
		Referring again to FIG. 5, the flowchart 40 is terminated upon<br>
10 	completion of stage S4S. For each signal propagated thereafter to the<br>
	receiver 30, flowchart 40 will be implemented wherein either quantitative<br>
	estimation QE1, quantitative estimation QE2 or quantitative estimation QE3<br>
	are calculated during an implementation of stage S54 (FIG. 6) in view of a<br>
	desired early, late, or early/late detection of an excess spread delay,<br>
15 	respectively.<br>
		FIG. 8 illustrates a communication unit 70 and a communication unit<br>
	80, The communication unit 70 includes a receiver 71 and a transmitter 72,<br>
	and the communication unit 80 includes a receiver 81 and a transmitter 82.<br>
	The present invention is employed within the communication unit 70 and/or<br>
20 	the communication 80 to determine a presence of excess delay spread in a<br>
	communication channel 90 between the communication unit 70 and the<br>
	communication 80. In one embodiment, the receiver 71 receives a signal S<br>
	transmitted by the transmitter 82 passing through the communication channel<br>
	90. The signal S as received by the receiver 71 either has segments<br>
25 	exhibiting similar properties in the absence of an excess delay spread in the<br>
	communication channel 90 as exemplary illustrated in FIG. 3, or segments<br>
	exhibiting dissimilar properties due to the presence of an excess delay spread<br>
	in the communication channel 90 as exemplary illustrated in FIG. 4. Upon<br>
	reception of the signal S, the receiver 71 implements the excess spread<br>
30 	detection method of the present invention represented by the flowchart 40<br>
	illustrated In FIG. 5 to determine whether an excess delay spread is present in<br>
	the communication channel 90 based upon a quantitative estimation of a<br><br>
WO 2004/051913								PCT/US2003/038866<br>
10<br>
	almiterity of two segments of the received signal. In one embodiment, if the<br>
	presence of excess delay spread in the communication channel 90 is<br>
	detected by the receiver 71, then the transmitter 72 transmits a message M1<br>
	to the receiver 81 to indicate the detection of the presence of excess delay<br>
5 	spread in the communication channel 90. If the receiver 71 defects the<br>
	absence of excess delay spread in the communication channel 90, the<br>
	transmitter 72 can optionally transmit a message M2 to the receiver 81 to<br>
	indicate an absence of excess delay spread in the communication channel 90.<br>
		FIG. S illustrates flowchart 100 representative of a communication<br>
10 	system adaptation method in accordance with the present invention. To<br>
	facilliate an understanding of the communication adaptation method of the<br>
	present invention, the flowchart 100 will be described based upon an<br>
	implementation of the flowchart 100 by the receiver 71 (FIG. 8) and the<br>
	transmitter 72 (FIG. 8).<br>
15 		During a stage S102 of the flowchart 100, the receiver 71 implements<br>
	the excess spread detection method of the present invention represented by<br>
	the flowchart 40 Illustrated in FIG. 5 to determine whether an excess delay<br>
	spread is present or absent in a received signal based upon a quantitative<br>
	estimation of a similarity of two segments of the received signal.<br>
20 		During a stage S104 of the flowchart 100, the receiver 71 (FIG. 8)<br>
	and/or the receiver 81 (FIG. 8) is(are) adapted based on any detected<br>
	presence of excess delay spread in the received signal S. In one<br>
	embodiment, an adaptation of the receiver 71 and/or the receiver 81<br>
	encompasses a determination of the coefficients of a filter used to interpolate<br>
25 	and/or smooth complex channel gain estimates for the subcarriers of an<br>
	OFDM signal. This filter is a channel estimation filter. When an OFDM signal<br>
	includes known or pilot symbols on certain subcarriers, the receiver 71 and/or<br>
	the receiver 81 compares a received pilot symbol to the known transmitted<br>
	pilot symbol value to measure the complex channel gain on the subcarrier<br>
30 	containing the pilot symbol. This process is repeated on each subcarrier<br>
	having a pilot symbol to obtain a set of measurements. However, these<br>
	measurements are sometimes too noisy to be used directly, so filtering can be<br><br>

	used to reduce the noise (smoothing) and interpolate values of the complex<br>
	channel gain between the subcarriers containing pilot symbols. In the<br>
	presence of excess delay spread, the complex channel gain becomes fess<br>
	correlated between subcarriers and the channel estimation filter should<br>
5 	perform less smoothing to improve the tracking of the increased channel<br>
	variations. Thus, when excess delay spread is present, the channel<br>
	estimation filter bandwidth can be increased (the bandwidth of the fiiter is<br>
	related to the Fourier transform of the filter coefficients).<br>
		In a second embodiment, two channel estimation filters with different<br>
10 	bandwidths are stored in the receiver 71 and/or the receiver 81, and a<br>
	determination of the coefficients of the filter includes a selection of the<br>
	coefficients of one of the filters based on the presence of excess delay<br>
	spread.<br>
		Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate an adaptation of<br>
15 	the receiver 71 and/or the receiver 81 is based on the presence of excess<br>
	delay spread can also be advantageously applied to other portions, methods,<br>
	and algorithms of a receiver.<br>
		During a stage S106 of the flowchart 100, the transmitter 72 (FIG. 8)<br>
	and/or the transmitter 82 (FIG. 8) is (are) adapted based on any detected<br>
20 	presence of excess delay spread in the received signal 5. In one<br>
	embodiment, a cyclic prefix length used by the transmitter 72 and/or the<br>
	transmitter 82 is adapted based on the detected presence of excess delay<br>
	spread in the received signal.<br>
		In alternative embodiments of the flowchart 100, either stage S104 or<br>
25 	stage S108 can be omitted.<br>
		Referming again to FIG. 8, when the presence of excess delay spread is<br>
	detected by the receiver 71, the receiver 71 can be adapted without the need<br>
	for communication unit 70 to transmit the message M1 or the message M2<br>
	from the transmitter 72. It is preferred nonetheless that communication unit<br>
30 	70 transmits the message M1 to communication unit 80 when it adapts<br>
	transmitter 72. In such a case, the message Ml preferably includes additional<br>
	information about the adaptation of transmitter 72 whereby the communication<br><br>
WO 2004/051913								PCT/US2003/038866<br>
-12-<br>
	unit 80 will be informed of changes to the transmit signal properties. As to the<br>
	communicaton unit 80, if the receiver 81 or transmitter 82 are to be adapted<br>
	based on the detected presence of excess delay spread by the receiver 71,<br>
	the transmission of the message M1 is required to inform the communication<br>
5 	unit 80 of the detected presence of excess delay spread whereby the receiver<br>
	81 and/or the transmitter 82 can be properly adapted.<br>
		The receiver 30 (FIG. 2), the receiver 71 (FIG. 8), the transmitter 72<br>
	FIG. 8), the receiver 81 (FIG. 8) and the transmitter 82 (FIG. 8) may employ<br>
	ardware (analog or digital), software, or any combination of hardware and<br>
10 	oftware for implementing various stages of the one or more methods of the<br>
	resent invention.<br>
		e present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without<br>
	eparting from its spirit or essential characteristics. For example, the<br>
	athematical principles of linearity and superposition may enable the re-<br>
15 	rdering of certain steps of the described embodiments, or may enable<br>
	dditional specific embodiments having essentially the same function, and<br>
	hat such variations are within the scope of the present invention. In another<br>
	xample, upon determination of the presence of the excess delay spread, the<br>
	etrics disclosed herein could be determined for various window sizes and/or<br>
20 	starting positions in order to determine the length of the excess deley spread.<br>
	The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as<br>
	illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore,<br>
	indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All<br>
	changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims<br>
25 	are to be embraced within their scope.<br>
		The present invention is not limited to multi-carrier communication<br>
	systems. For example, a waveform with similar segments can be transmitted<br>
	periodically in a conventional single-carrier system. The methods presented in<br>
	the invention can then be applied to detect the presence of excess delay<br>
30 	spread with appropriate redefinition of the variables.<br><br>
