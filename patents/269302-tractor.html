				<td>Specification TRACTOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a tractor which detachably mounts a hydraulic circuit body and a hydraulic control valve on a transmission casing.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, as a type of tractor, there has been known a tractor in which a hydraulic casing is communicably connected with an upper portion of a transmission casing, a lift arm support shaft which has an axis thereof extended in the lateral direction penetrates the hydraulic casing, proximal end portions of a pair of left and right lift arms are mounted on left and right-side end portions of the lift arm support shaft, a proximal end portion of an operating arm is mounted on a midst portion of the lift arm support shaft, a distal end portion of a lift cylinder which is arranged in the inside of the hydraulic casing in a lying manner is connected to a distal end portion of the operating arm, and a lift arm is vertically and rotatably operated in an interlocking manner with the extending and contracting operation of the lift cylinder (for example, see Japanese Patent Laid-open 2002-283861).<br>
Further, a hydraulic circuit is formed in the hydraulic<br><br>
casing, and a lubricant in the inside of the transmission casing is allowed to pass through the hydraulic circuit as a working oil so as to perform the extension-contraction operation of the lift cylinder.<br>
However, with respect to the above-mentioned tractor, since the hydraulic casing is often formed by casting and hence, there ir.ay be a case that small cavities, that is, so-called blowholes are formed in the hydraulic casing. When the hydraulic circuit is formed in such a hydraulic casing, there may arise a drawback that the pressurized oil leaks at blowhole portions.<br>
This brings about a drawback that the whole hydraulic casing is scrapped or disposed and hence, an economical loss is large.<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned tractor, the lubricant in the inside of the transmission casing is supplied to the lirt cylinder under pressure as a working oil so as to operate the 1ift cylinder. Accordingly, when a hydraulic filter is clogged with dusts such as worn-out pieces which are constantly generated due to the meshing of gears in the inside of the transmission casing, the dusts flow into a hydraulic control valve formed in the midst of the hydraulic circuit through a bypass circuit and hence, there exists the possibility that the operation of the hydraulic control valve becomes defective.<br>
Accordingly, there has been adopted the structure in which a partition plate is interposed between the hydraulic<br><br>
casing and the transmission casing so as to separate the working oil in the inside of the hydraulic casing and the lubricant in the inside of the transmission casing.<br>
However, such separation structure suffers from following drawbacks.<br>
(1)	In performing the performance/function inspection<br>
of the hydraulic control valve, to prevent the leaking of<br>
the working oil, it is necessary to perform the inspection<br>
in a state that the hydraulic casing is mounted on the<br>
transmission casing.  Accordingly, the inspection device<br>
becomes large-sized and there exists the cumbersomeness that<br>
a human power is insufficient for handling the inspection<br>
device and a transport assist: device is necessary.<br>
(2)	It is necessary to prevent the leaking of oil-on<br>
both surfaces of the partition plate and hence, the highly<br>
accurate flatness is required with respect to both surfaces<br>
of the partition plate.<br>
(3)	Since the partition plate is interposed between<br>
the hydraulic casing and the transmission casing, a height<br>
on the ground of the hydraulic casing is increased by an<br>
amount corresponding to a wall thickness of the partition<br>
plate whereby the degree of freedom in designing a mounting<br>
height of a driver's seat which is arranged right above the<br>
hydraulic casing is small.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
(1) According to the first aspect of the present<br><br>
invention, a lift arm is mounted on an upper portion of a transmission casing by way of a lift arm support body, the lift a run is hy draulically control lab le by a hydraulic control valve by way cf a hydraulic circuit body, and the hydraulic circuit body and the hydraulic control valve are detachably mounted on the transmission casing as bodies separate from a lift a rm s u p po r t: body.<br>
In this manner, the hydraulic circuit body and the hydr au 1 i c cor, t r o 1 valve are constituted as bodies separate from the lift arm support body. Accordingly, even when blowholes are formed in the lift arm support body which is formed by casting, a pressurized oil is not allowed to pass through the lift arm body and hence, it is no more necessary to worry about the adverse influence attributed to the blowholes such as the leaking of oil or the like.<br>
Further, in forming the lift arm support body, it is possible to simplify a shape of the lift arm support body compared to a conventional lift arm support body and hence, it is possible to easily take measures to cope with the occurrence of blowholes whereby a yield rate of the lift arm support body can be enhanced whereby the manufacturing cost can be reduced.<br>
Still further, the lift arm support body per se can be minimized as much as possible and hence, it is possible to acquire the easiness of handling of the lift arm support body during manufacturing and forming as we 11 as the reduction of the manufacturing cost.<br><br>
Further, it is possible to detachably mount the hydraulic circuit body and the hydraulic control valve without removing the lift arm support body which is a relatively heavy object from the transmission casing and hence, it is possible to ensure the favorable maintenance.<br>
(2) According to the second aspect of the present invention, the lift arm support body is extended fronwarcily to form a hydraulic circuit body support member and the hydraulic circuit body is mounted on and fixed to the hydraulic circuit body support member.<br>
In this manner, the hydraulic circuit body is mounted on and fixed to the hydraulic circuit body support member which is formed by extending the lift arm support body frontwardly. Accordingly, it is possible to fix the hydraulic circuit body to the hydraulic circuit body support member in a state that the lift arm support body is preliminarily fixed to the transmission casing or it is possible to integrally mount the hydraulic circuit body support member and the hydraulic circuit body on the transmission casing in a state that the hydraulic circuit body is preliminarily fixed to the hydraulic circuit body support member whereby it is possible to effectively perform the assembling operation correspond ing to working conditions and the like.<br>
(3) According to the third aspect of the present invention, the hydraulic control valve is mounted on the hydraulic circuit body.<br><br>
In this manner, bymounting the hydraulic control valve on the hydraulic circuit body, it is possible to arrange the hydraulic control valve and the hydraulic circuit body in a compact and concentrated manner and, at the same time, it is possible to integrally fix the hydraulic control valve and the hydraulic circuit body to the lift arm support body or the; hydraulic circuit body support member whereby the assembling performance of these parts can be enhanced.<br>
Further, in the hydraulic circuit body which is constituted as the separate body from the lift arm support body, it is possible to arrange valves and the like in a concentrated manner and hence, it is possible to form the hydraulic circuit body in a compact manner.<br>
(4) According to the fourth aspect of the present invention, a lift arm is mounted on an upper portion of the transmission casing ;::y way of a lift arm support body and, at the same time, the lift arm is hydraulically controllable by a hydraulic control valve by way of a hydraulic circuit body which is detachably mounted on the lift arm support body, a valve cover body is mounted on the hydraulic circuit body, the hydraulic control valve is housed in the inside of the valve cover bony, and a drain in the hydraulic control valve can be discharged through a drain circuit formed in the inside of the hydraulic circuit body by way of a drain receiving space which is formed in the inside of the valve cover body.<br><br>
In this manner, by mounting the valve cover body on the hydraulic circuit body which is detachably mounted on the lift arm support body and by housing the hydraulic control valve in the inside of the valve cover body, it is possible to perform the performance/function inspection of the hydraulic control valve before mounting1 the hydraulic circuit body and the valve cover body on the lift arm support body.<br>
As a result, it is possible to realize the easiness of the performance/function inspect ion, theminiaturization of the inspection device, and easiness of handling which requires human power.<br>
(5) According to the fifth embodiment of the present invention, the hydraulic circuit body is mounted on the transmission casing by way of the lift arm support body, an upper end peripheral portion of an upper-surface open-ended box-like valve cover body is hermetical ly mounted on a lower portion of the hydraulic circuit body, and a lower portion of the valve cover body is arranged in the inside of the transmission casing.<br>
In this manner, by mount ing the hydraulic circuit body on the transmission casing by way of the lift arm support body, it is sufficient to perform the sealing of a mounting surface of the lift arm support body to the transmission casing at one portion and, at the same time, a conventional sealing method can b adopted.<br>
Further, since the lower portion of the valve cover<br><br>
body is arranged in the inside of the transmission casing, it is possible to set aheight above the ground of the hydraulic circuit body at a low level and hence, it is possible to ensure the large degree of freedom in designing a mounting height of a driver's seat which is arranged right above the hydraulic circuit body.<br>
(6) According to the sixth aspect of the present invention, a lift arm is hydraulically controllable by a hydraulic coritrcl valve by way of a hydraulic circuit body, a valve cover body is mounted on the hydraulic circuit body, the hydraulic control valve is housed in the inside of the valve cover body, a sub spool is interposed between a spool which is mounted in the hydraulic control valve and a spool actuator which is arranged outside the valve cover body and actuates the spool, and the sub spool is configured such that a sealing member having the sealing structure is mounted in the valve cover body, a sub spool projectinghole is formed in the sealing member, and the sub spool is arranged in the sub spool projecting hole in a penetrating manner.<br>
In this manner, by mounting the sealing member having the sealing structure to the valve cover body, by forming the sub spool projecting hole in the sealing member, and by allowing the sub spool to penetrate the sub spool projecting hole, and by interposing the sub spool between the spool provided to the hydraulic control valve and the spool actuator, even when the accuracy of concentricity of the spool and the sub spool projecting hole is made more<br><br>
or less offset due to amounting error of the hydraulic control valve, it is possible to sufficiently ensure the slide operation of the sub spool in the sub spool projecting hole and hence, it is possible to surely transmit an actuation force of the spool actuator to the spool by way of the sub spool .<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to favorably ensure the hydraulic control performed by the hydraulic control valve.<br>
(7) According to the seventh aspect of the present invention, at least one of a contact surface of the spool with the sub spool or a contact surface of the sub spool with the spool is formed in an arcuate surface which bulges outwardly.<br>
By forming the arcuate surface which bulges outwardly on either one of the respective contact surfaces of the spool and the sub spool, even when the accuracy of concentricity of the spool arid the sub spool projecting hole is made more or less offset due to a mounting error of thehydrauliccor.zrol valve, it is possible to surely transmit an actuation force of the spool actuator from the sub spool to the spool by way of the contact surfaces and hence, it is possible to ensure the hydraulic control performed by the hydraulic control valve in a more favorable manner.<br>

Hereinafter, the constitutions of the above-mentioned [prime mover 2], [clutch part 3], [transmission part 4], [driving paTt 5] and [PTO transmission portion •£• ] are explained in a specific manner in this order. [prime mover 2}<br>
The prime mover 2 is constituted such that, as shown in Fig. 1, an engine 15 or the like is mounted on the body frame 1 and the engine 15 is covered with a hood I •: which can be opened and closed. I the clutch part 3]<br>
The clutch part 3 is configured such that, as shown in Fig. 2 to Fig. 4 and Fig. 6, an inner-and-outer double drive shaft body 18 which extends in the fore-and-aft direction is rotatably supported in the inside of a clutch housing 17, and the inner-and-outer double drive shaft body 18 is constituted of an inner drive shaft 19 which extends<br><br>
in the fore-and-aft direction and a cylindrical outer drive shaft 20 which is rotatably fitted on an outer periphery of the inner drive shaft 19.<br>
Here, a proximal end portion (a front end portion) of the inner drive shaft 19 which constitutes one shaft is interlockingly connected with the engine 15 by way of a traveling clutch 21, while a distal end portion(a rear end portion} of the inner drive shaft 19 is interlockingly connected with a traveling-system transmission mechanism 51 described later , On the other hand, a proximal end portion (a front end portion) of the outer drive shaft 20 which constitutes another shaft is interlockingly connected with the engine 15 by way of a PTO clutch 22, while a distal end portion (a rear end portion) of the outer drive shaft 20 is interlockingly connected with a PTO-system transmission mechanism 52 described later.<br>
Here, to a rear end peripheral portion of the clutch housing 17, a front end peripheral portion of a main transmission casing 53 of the transmission part 4 described later is detachably connected. The above-mentioned inner-and-outer double drive shaft body 18 has a distal end portion thereof pivotally supported by a bearing 24 which is arranged on a front portion inside the clutch housing 17 and a rear end portion thereof pivotally supported by a bearing 25 which is arranged on a front portion inside the main transmission casing 53.<br>
Further, on an inner peripheral portion of a rear end<br><br>
of the clutch housing 17, a rear wall 27 having an opening portion 26 at a center portion thereof is formed and a cylindrical support body 28 which extends in the fore-and-aft direction is mounted on the rear wall 27 in a state that the cylindrical support body 28 passes through the opening portion 26, wherein the cylindrical support body 28 serves to support an outer peripheral surface of the midst portion of the inner-and-outer double drive shaft body 18.<br>
Further, with respect to the cylindrical support body 28, a front portion 28a thereof which is positioned in the inside of the clutch housing 17 is formed in a state that the front portion 28a has a narrow diameter, while a rear portion 28b thereof which is positioned in the inside of the main transmission casing 53 is formed in a state the rear portion 28b has an enlarged diameter. Further, a mounting flange member 28c is formed on an outer peripheral surface of the rear portion 28b, the mounting flange member 28c is brought into contact with a rear surface of the rear wall 27 of the clutch housing 17 from behind, and the mounting flange member 28c is mounted on the rear wall 27 by a mounting bolt 29. [Inner drive shaft 19]<br>
The inner drive shaft 19 is formed as a two-split body which is constituted of a front divided drive shaft member 30 and a rear divided drive shaft member 31, and both divided drive shaft members 30, 31 are interlockingly connected with each other in the inside of the outer drive shaft 20. Here,<br><br>
a dividing position (interlocking connecting position) of the front divided drive shaft member 30 and the rear divided drive shaft member 31 is arranged in the vicinity of a connecting portion of the clutch housing 17 and the main transmission casing 53, that is, in the inside of the rear portion 28b of the cylindrical support body 28.<br>
Further, a distal end portion of the front divided drive shaft member 30 and a proximal end portion of the rear divided drive shaft member 31 are detachably and interlockingly connected with each other using spigot fitting engagement.<br>
That is, while a fitting projecting member 30a is formed on a distal end surface of the front divided drive shaft member 30 in a state that the fittingprojecting mer.ber 30a projects rearwardly, a proximal-end-side fitting recessed portion 31a is formed on a proximal end surface of the rear divided drive shaft member 31 . Then, the fitting projecting member 30a is fitted into the proximal-end-side fitting recessed portion 31a in spigot engagement and, at the same time, a cylindrical connecting body 32 which has an axis thereof directed in the fore-and-aft direction is fitted into spline grooves 30b formed in an outer peripheral surface of the distal end portion of the front divided drive shaft member 30 and spline grooves 31b formed in an outer peripheral surface of the proximal end portion of the rear divided drive shaft member 31. [outer drive shaft 20]<br><br>
The outer drive shaft 20 is formed in a state that afrontportion20athereofhasa small dianeter in conformity with an outer peripheral surface of the inner drive shaft<br>
19	and a rear portion 20b thereof has a large diameter in<br>
conformity with  an outer peripheral  surface  of  the<br>
cylindrical connection body 32.   Bearings 33,  34 are<br>
interposed between an outer peripheral surface of the rear<br>
portion 20b of the outer drive shaft 20 and an inner peripheral<br>
surface of the rear portion of a rear portion 28b cf the<br>
cylindrical support body 28.<br>
Further, a distal end portion of the outer drive shaft<br>
20	extends rearwardly than a rear end of the cylindrical<br>
support body 28 and a PTO drive gear 20c is integrally formed<br>
on an outer peripheral surface of the outer drive shaft 20.<br>
Numeral 35 indicates a PTO drive gear support bearing.<br>
In this manner, the inner drive shaft 19 is formed such that the inner drive shaft 19 is divided into the front divided drive shaft member 30 and the rear divided drive shaft member 31 and both divided drive shaft members 30,31 are interlockingly connected with each other in the inside of the outer drive shaft 20. Accordingly, compared to a prior art in which a distal end portion of an inner drive shaft is extended rearwardly than a distal end portion of an outer drive shaft and is interlockingly connected with a proximal end portion of a PTO-system input shaft coaxially by way of a cylindrical shaft coupling in an abutted state, even when the clutch housing 17 and the main transmission<br><br>
casing 53 are connected in the fore-and-aft direction and the inner-and-outer double drive shaft body 18 is allowed to pass through the inside of the clutch housing 17 and the main transmission casing 53, it is possible to eliminate a drawback that the main transmission casing 53 is largely prolonged in the fore-and-aft direction.<br>
Further, an assembling operation to connect the clutch housing 17 arid the main transmission casing 53 by assembling and a maintenance operation which is performed by releasing the connection can be performed easily.<br>
Sti]] further, since the division position of the front divided drive shaft member 30 and the rear divided drive shaft member 31 of the inner drive shaft 19 is arranged in the vicinity of the connecting portion of the clutch housing 17 and the main transmission casing 53, the main transmission casing 53 can be contracted in the fore-and-aft direction whereby the body can be made compact and, at the same time, an assembled unit: of the main transmission casing 53 can be shortened in the fore-and-aft direction whereby the transportation cost of the assembled unit can be reduced whereby it is possible to bring a large number of units at a time by making use of outsourcing.<br>
Here, the fitting projecting member 30a formed on the distal end portion of the front divided drive shaft member 30 is fitted into the proximal-end-side fitting recessed portion 31a formed in the proximal end portion of the rear divided drive shaft member 31 using the spigot joint fitting<br><br>
and hence, the front divided drive shaft member 30 and the rear divided drive shaft member 31 are detachably interlockingly connected with each other. Accordingly, it is possible to interlockingly connect the front divided drive shaft member 30 and the rear divided drive shaft member 31 which are formed in a two-split structure by assembling these members 30, 31 with high accuracy.<br>
Further, a traveling cylindrical operating body 36 is fitted on an outer peripheral surface of the outer crive shaft 20 as well as on an outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical support body 28 in a slidable manner'in the fore-and-aft direction, and a proximal end portion of a traveling clutch operating lever 37 is interlockingly connected wifh a rear portion of the traveling cylindrical operating body 36. Further, a clutch operating member 36a is mounted on a front end peripheral portion of the traveling cylindrical operating body 36, and the clutch operating member 36a is arranged close to an operation receiving arm 21a of a traveling clutch 21 in an opposed manner. Nurr.eral 38 indicates a lever support shaft.<br>
Due to such a constitution, when the traveling clutch operating lever 37 is rotatably manipulated, the traveling cylindrical operating body 36 is slidably moved frontwardly, the clutch operating member 36a pushes the operation receiving arm 21a so as to rotate the operation receiving arm 21a whereby the traveling clutch 21 performs the power transmission disconnecting operation.<br><br>
Further, a PTO cylindrical operating body 39 is fitted<br>
on an outer peripheral surface of the traveling cylindrical operating body 36 in a slidable manner in the fore-and-aft direction, and a proximal end portion of a PTO clutch operating lever 40 is interlockingly connected with a rear portion of the PTO cylindrical operating body 39. Further, a clutch operating member 39a is mounted on a front end peripheral portion of the PTO cylindrical operating body 39, and the clutch operating member 39a is arranged close to an operata.cn receiving arm 22a of a PTO clutch 22 in an opposed manner. Numeral 41 indicates a lever support shaft.<br>
Due to such a constitution, when the PTO clutch operating lever 40 is rotatably manipulated,  the PTO cylindrical operating body 39 is slidably moved f rontv;ardly, the clutch operating member 39a pushes the operation receiving arm 22a so as to rotate the operation receiving arm 22a whereby the PTO clutch 22 performs the power cutting operation. [Transmission part 4]<br>

To an upper portionofthe sub transmission casing 54, a connecting flange portion 353 which is formed on a peripheral portion of the cover body 302 is detachably mounted using connecting bolts 354.<br>
Further, a proximal portion of the sub transmission lever 142 is mounted on the cover body 302 and, at the same time, a proximal portion of the main transmission lever 85 is mounted on the longitudinally-extending cover forming body 304 arranged at a position close to the sub transmission lever 142, wherein respective proximal portions of both levers 142, 85 are integrally assembled in the vicinity of the lever proximal portion cover body 301.<br>

Due to such a constitution, it is possible to change the mode of arrangement from the mode in which the main/sub transir.i ssion levers 85, 142 are arranged on the right side with respect to the lateral imaginary center line Cl of the transmission casing 45 in the body advancing direction, that is, in the mode in which the main/sub transmission levers 85, 142 are arranged on the right-side position of the driver's seat 283 integrally and in a concentrated manner as in the case of this embodiment to a mode in which the main/sub transmission levers 85, 142 are arranged on the left side position of the driver's seat; 283 integrally and in a<br><br>
concentrated manner.<br>
Since the main transmission lever 85 is arranged close to the sub transmission lever 142 in the above-mentioned manner, an operator can suitably manipulate the main transmission lever 85 or the sub transmission lever 142 using another hand while gripping a steering wheel 282 which constitutes a handle described later with one hand.<br>
Further, since the main/sub transmission levers 85, 142 are arranged close to each other in a concentrated manner, it is possible to rapidly and surely perform the shifting from one  transmission  lever manipulation  to  another transmission lever manipulation whereby the operability can be enhanced.<br>
Further, with respect to the main transmission lever 85 and the sub transmission lever 142, respective proximal portions are integrally assembled to the lever proximal portion cover body 301 in a state that the respective proximal portions of transmission levers 85, 142 are arranged close to the lever proximal portion cover body 301 and, thereafter, the lever proximal portion cover body 301 can be mounted on the transmission casing 45 and hence, it is possible to easily connect both transmission levers 85, 142 with the transmission casing 45. As a result, it is possible to enhance the efficiency of mounting operation of the main/sub transmission levers 85, 142.<br>
Further, the main/sub transmission levers 85, 142 can be arranged integrally and in a concentrated manner at both<br><br>

(mounting structure of sub transmission lever 142)<br>
The sub transmission lever 142 is interlockingly connected with a sub transmission rr.echanism 47 described Later by way of a sub transmission lever support shaft 141. The sub transmission lever support shaft 141 is arranged in a lying manner with an axis thereof extended in the lateral direction between left and right side walls of the cover body 302 of the above-mentioned lever proximal portion cover body 301. Here, a right-side end portion 336 of the sub transmission lever support shaft 141 extends outwardly from the right side wall, and a proximal end portion of the sub transmission lever 142 is mounted on the right-side end portion 336. On the other hand, at a position right below<br><br>

(sub transmission mechanism 47)<br>
The sub transmission mechanism 47 is, as shown in rig. 4, Fig. 7 and Fig. 9, configured such that a sub transmission shaft 116 is interlockingly connected with a distal end portion (a rear end portion) of the above-menticned main-transmission main shaft 58 by way of a planetary gear mechanism 115. Here, a distal end portion of the main-transmission main shaft 58 extends rearwardly ami forms a sun gear 117 which constitutes a portion of the planetary gear mechanism 115. on the other hand, the sub transmission shaft 116 is arranged coaxially with the main-transir.i 5 sion main shaft 58 and, at the same time, has a midst portion thereof supported on a shaft support body 118 provided in the inside of the sub transmission casing 54 by way of a bearing 119. Further, a distal end portion (a rear end portion) of the sub transmission shaft 116 is supported on a shaft support wall 100 formed on a differential gear casing<br><br>
55 described later by way of a bearing 120.<br>
The planetary gear mechanism 115 has the following constitution. A pair of front and rear inner gear support bodies 121, 122 which are formed in a ring shape and are arranged on an outer periphery of the sun gear 117 are mounted on the above-mentioned shaft support wall forming body 50 using mounting bolts 123 which have axis thereof directed in the fore-and-aft direction. An inner gear 124 has both ends thereof supported on both inner gear support bodies 121, 122. A plurality of planetary gears 125 are arranged in a spaced apart manner in the circumferential direction of the inner gear 124 and, at the same time, the respective planetary gears 125 are meshed with both of the inner gear 124 and the sun gear 117. On the other hand, a carrier 128 is mounted between inner peripheral portions of a pair of front and rear inner gear support bodies 121, and the plurality of planetary gears 125 are integrally and inter lockingly connected with the carrier 128.<br>
Further, the carrier 128 has a rear end peripheral portion thereof extended rearwardly to form a cylindrical gear forming member 129 and inner teeth 130 are formed on an inner peripheral surface of the gear forming member 129.<br>
Further, between an outer peripheral surface of the sun gear 117 and an outer peripheral surface of a proximal end portion (a front end portion) 114 of the sub transmi ssion shaft 116, a cylindrical shift gear support body 132 is disposed in spline fitting in a state that the shift gear<br><br>
support body 132 can be shifted in the axial direction.<br>
Further, a distal end portion 138 of the above-mentioned shift fork 136 is engaged with the shift gear support body 132.<br>
In this manner, by performing the rotational manipulation of the sub transmission lever 142 in the fore-and-aft direction, the shift gear support body 132 is shifted in the fore-and-aft direction so that the sub transmission manipulation is performed.<br>
That is, when the sub transmission lever 142 is rotated rearwardly, the interlocking arm 143 is rotated forwardly by way of the sub transmission lever support shaft 141, the shift fork 136 which is connected with the distal end portion of the interlocking arm 143 is slidably moved forwardly, and the shift gear support body 132 which is engaged with the shift fork 136 is shifted frontwardly.<br>
Here, the shift gear support body 132 is shifted in a state that the shift gear support body 132 is extended between an outer peripheral surface of the sun gear 117 and an outer peripheral surface of the proximal end portion (front end portion) 114 of the sub transmission shaft 116 thus establishing a state in which the sun gear 117 and the sub transmission shaft 116 are interlockingly connected with each other by way of the shift gear support body 132 ia state in which the main-transmission main shaft 58 and the sub-transmission shaft 116 are directly connected with each other) .<br><br>
Accordingly, in such a shift position, the power is transmitted to the sub transmission shaft 116 from the sun gear 117 which is integrally formed with the main-transmission main shaft 58 by way of the shift gear support body 132.<br>
Further, when the sub transmission lever 142 is rotated frontwardly, the interlocking arm 143 is rotated rearv;ardly by way of the sub transmission lever support shaft 141, the shift fork 136 which is connected with the distal end p or t ion of the interlocking arm 143 is slidably moved rearwardly, and the shift gear support body 132 which is engaged with the shift fork 136 is shifted rearwardly.<br>
Then, the shift gear support body 132 is detached from the outer peripheral surface of the sun-gear 117 and is shifted to the outer peripheral surface of the proximal end portion (the front end portion) 114 of the sub transmission shaft 116 and, at: the same time, the front shift gear 133 is ir.eshed with the inner teeth 130 which are formed on the inner peripheral surface of the gear forming member 129.<br>
Accordingly, in such a shift position, a rotational force of the sun gear 117 which is integrally formed with the main-transmission main shaft 58 is transmitted to the distal end portion 114 of the sub transmission shaft 116 through a path of the planetary gear 125 which is neshed<br>
with the sun gear 117 -&gt; the carrier 128 —&gt; the inner teeth 130 of the gear forming member 129 which is integrally formed<br>
with the carrier 128 —&gt; the front shift gear 133 of the shift<br><br>
gear support body 132 -» the shift gear support body 132 —&gt; the distal end portion 114 of the sub transmission shaft 116.<br>
Here, the power which is subjected to the speed reduction by way of the planetary gear mechanism 115 is transmitted to the sub transmission shaft 116 from the main-transmission main shaft 58 whereby the sub transmission is performed. (mounting structure of main transmission lever 85)<br>
The main transmission lever 85 is, as shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, interlockingly connected with a lever interlocking shaft 81 by way of the above-mentioned lever interlocking mechanism 300, wherein the lever interlocking mechanism 3 00 is arr an g ed in the ins ide of the above-mentioned lever proximal portion cover body 301.<br>

interlocking-shaft-side ope rat ing member 306isengagedwith an upper end portion of the interlocking-shaft-side operation receiving member 84 which is mounted on a rear end portion of rhe above-mentioned lever interlocking shaft 81 . On the other hand, a lever-side operation receiving member 307 is mounted on a right-side end portion of the interlocking rod 305 which is positioned in the inside of a longitudinally extending cover forming body 304 in a state that the lever-side operation receiving member 307 extends upwardly and a lower end portion of the lever-side operating member 85a is engaged 'with an upper end portion of the lever-side operation receiving member 307.<br>
Then, a cylindrical tilting receiving portion 308 is communicably connected with an upper end portion of the longitudinally extending cover forming body 304, and an approximately spherical tilting support body 309 is arranged in the inside cf the tilting receiving portion 308 in a state that the tilting support body 309 is tiltable in the front, rear, left: and right directions arbitrarily. A through hole 310 is formed in a center portion of the tilting support body 309 in a vertically penetrating manner . The lever-side operating member 85a is inserted into the through hole 310 and, at the same time, a midst portion of the lever-side operating member 85a is connected with the tilting support body 309 by way of a support shaft 311 which penetrates the through hole 309 while having an axis thereof in the lateral direction. Numeral 312 indicates a<br><br>
tiltable-support-body compression spring which is interposed between the tilting receiving portion 308 and the tilting support body 309, and numeral 313 indicates a resilient cover body which covers the lever-side operating member 8 5a.<br>
Further, the main transmission lever 85 has a lower end portion thereof fitted on an upper end portion cf the lever-side operating member 85a and is connected with the lever-side operating member 85a using a connecting pin 332.<br>
In such a constitution, by grasping an upper end portion of the main transmission lever 85 and by rotatably manipulating the main transmission lever 85 in the front, rear, left; and right directions, it is possible to tilt the lower end portion of the lever-side operating member 85a in the front, rear, left and right directions by way of the tilting support body 309.<br>
Further, by allowing the lever-side operating member 85a to be tilted in the fore-and-aft direction, it is possible to slide the lever interlocking shaft 81 in the fore-and-aft direction by way of the lever-side operation receiving member 307 ~» the interlocking rod 305 —&gt; interlocking-shaft-side operating member 306 —&gt; interlocking-shaft-side operation receiving member 84.<br>
On the other hand, by allowing the lever-side operating member 85a to be tilted in the left-and-right direction, it is possible to rotate the lever interlocking shaft 81 about an axis thereof by way of the lever-side operation<br><br>
receiving member 307 —&gt; the interlocking rod 305 -» interlocking-shaft-side operating member 306 —» interlocking-shaft-side operation receiving member 84.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to easily perform the transmission manipulation in five stages using the above-mentioned main transmission lever 85.<br>
Here, between the cover body 302 and the left-side end portion of the interlocking rod 305, as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 10, a branching position temporarily he 1 ding portion 314 which temporarily holds the shifting manipulation in the lateral direction of the main transmission lever 85 at a transmission-manipulation-direction branching position at a neutral position is provided.<br>
That is, branching position temporarily holding portion 314 is configured as follows as shown in Fig. 10. In a left-side portion of a ceiling portion 315 of the cover body 302, a ball accommodating longitudinal hole 316 which extends vertically is formed in a penetrating manner. A lower end portion of a temporarily holding ball 319 is projected from a lower-end opening portion 317 of the ball accommodating longitudinal hole 316 by way of a compression spring 318, while on an outer peripheral surface of the left-side end portion of the interlocking rod 3 05, a left-side engaging groove 320, a center engaging groove 321 and a right-side engaging groove 322 are formed in a state that these grooves are arranged close to each other in the lateral<br><br>
direction. A lower end portion of the temporarily holding ball 319 is engaged with any one of the engaging grooves. Numeral 436 indicates a spring holding body which holds the compression spring 318 from above and is fixed to the ball accommodating longitudinal hole 316.<br>
In such a constitution, when the main transmission lever 85 is manipulated to the neutral position, the interlocking rod 305 is s lidably moved, the lower end portion of the temporari lyholdingball 319 is engagedwith the center engaging groove 321. When the main transmission lever 85 is rotated to the left side (or to the right side) from such a state, the interlocking rod 305 is slidably moved to the right side (or to the left side) and the lower end portion of the temporarily holding ball 319 is engaged with the left-side (right-side) engaging groove 320 (322).<br>
Accordingly, even at the neutral position, the operator can perceive that the main transmission lever 85 is shifted to the shift manipulation position with his hand. As a result, it is possible to enhance the operability of the main transmission lever 85.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 7, between an upper portion of the inner support wall 57 of the main transmission casing 53 and a front end portion of the slide body support shaft 80, a transmission position temporarily holding portion 323 which temporarily holds the shift manipulation in the fore-and-aft direction of the main transmission lever 85 at respective transmission positions is provided.<br><br>
That is, in the upper portion of the inner support wall 57 of the main transmission casing 53, an insertion support hole 324 which allows the insertion of a front end portion of the slide body support shaft 80 and supports the front end portion is formed. An upwardly-extending ball accommodating longitudinal hole 325 is formed in the inner support wall 57 from an upper peripheral surface of the insertion support hole 324. A lower end portion of a temporarily holding ball 328 is projected from a lower-end opening portion 326 of the ball accommodating longitudinal hole 325 by way of a compression spring 327. On the other hand, on an outer peripheral surface of the front end portion of the slide body support shaft 80, a front-side engaging groove 329, a center engaging groove 330 and a rear-side engaging groove 331 are formed in a state that these grooves are arranged close to each other in the fore-and-aft direction, wherein a lower end portion of the temporarily holding ball 328 is engaged with any one of the engaging grooves.<br>
In such a constitution, when the main transmission lever 85 is manipulated to the neutral position, the slide body suppor t shaft 80 is slidably moved, the lower end port ion of the temporal" ilyholdingball 328 is engagedwith the center engaqing groove 333. When the main transmission lever 85 is rotatably manipulated to the frond side (or to the rear sides from such a state, the slide body support shaft 80 is slidably moved to the front side (or to the rear side) and the lower end portion of the temporarily holding ball<br><br>
328 is engaged with the rear-side (front-side) engaging groove 331 (329).<br>
Accordingly/ the operator can perceive that the main transmission lever 85 is shifted to the respective transmission positions with his hand. As a result, it is possible to enhance the operability of the main transmission lever 85.<br>
Further, an opening portion 102 is formed in a bottom portion 54d of the sub transmission casing 54 and the front-wheel-drive power takeout port ions 103 described later are mounted through the opening portion 102. The front-wheel-drive power takeout portions 103 are respectively interlockingly connected with the sub transmission mechanism 47. (differential gear casing 55)<br>
The differential gear casing 55 is formed in a box shape with an opened upper surface as shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12. Opening portions 104, 104 are respectively formed on left and right side walls 55a, 55b. The rear axle cases 8, 8 are communicably connected with the differential gear casing 55 by way of the respective opening portions 104,<br>
104.	In the inside of the rear axle cases 8, 8, rear axles<br>
105,	105 which extend in the lateral direction are inserted<br>
and are rotatably supported, wherein the respective rear<br>
axle  105,  105  are interlockingly connected with the<br>
differential mechanism 48.<br>
Further, in the differential gear casing 55, a front<br><br>
wall is formed of a shaft support wall 100 and a rear end portion of the sub transmission shaft 116 and a midst portion of a third divided transmission shaft 247 are supported on the shaft support wall 100.<br>
Further, in the differential gear casing 55, as shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, a maintenance opening portion 106 is formed in a ceiling portion, a lift arm support body 339 is detachably rv.cunted on a peripheral portion of the opening portion 106, 5 hydraulic circuit body 341 is detachably mounted on a hydraulic body circuit body support member 340 which is formed by extending the lift arm support body 339 frontwardly, ar.d a hydraulic control valve 342 is mounted on the hydraulic circuit body 341.<br>
In such a constitution, since the hydraulic circuit body 341 and the hydraulic control valve 342 are forrr.ed as bodies separate from the lift arm support body 339, even when blowholes are formed in the lift arm support body 339 formed by melding, there is no possibility that the pressurized oil passes through the lift arm support body 339 whereby it is no more necessary to worry about the adverse influence attributed to the blowholes such as leaking of oil or the like.<br>
Further, in forming the lift arm support body 339, measures to cope with the generation of the blowholes can be easily taken against the occurrence of blowholes and he nee, a yield rate of the lift arm support body 339 can be enhanced whereby the manufacturing cost can be reduced.<br><br>
Still further, the lift arm support body 339 per se can be minimized as much as possible and hence, it is possible to acquire the easiness of handling of the lift arm support body during manufacturing and forming as well as the reduction of the manufacturing cost.<br>
Further, it is possible to detachably mount the hydraulic circuit body 341 and the hydraulic control valve 342 without removing the lift arm support body 339 which is a relatively heavy object from the transmission casing 45 and hence, it is possible to ensure the favorable maintenance.<br>
Further, the hydraulic circuit body 341 is mounted on and fixed to the hydraulic circuit body support member 340 which is formed b-y extending the lift arm support body 339 frontwardly. Accordingly, it is possible to fix the hydraulic circuit body 341 to the hydraulic circuit body support member 340 in a state that the lift arm support body 339 is preliminarily fixed to the transmission casing 45 or it is possible to integrally mount the hydraulic circuit body support member 340 and the hydraulic circuit body 341 on the transmission casing 45 in a state that the hydraulic circuit body 341 is preliminarily fixed to the hydraulic circuit body support member 340 whereby it is possible to effectively perform the assembling operation corresponding to working conditions and the like.<br>
By mounting the hydraulic control valve 342 on the hydraulic circuit body 341, it is possible to arrange the<br><br>
hydraulic control valve 342 and the hydraulic circuit body 341 in a compact and concentrated manner and, at the same time, it is possible to integrally fix the hydraulic control valve 342 and the hydraulic circuit body 341 to the lift arm support body 339 or the hydraulic circuit body support member 340 whereby the assembling performance of these parts can be enhanced.<br>
Further , the hydraulic circuit body 341 which is formed separately frcr. the lift arm support body 339 can realize the concentrated arrangement of the valves and the like and hence, the hydraulic circuit body 341 can be formed in a compact form.<br>
Next, the constitutions of the above-mentioned lift arm support body 339, hydraulic circuit body 341-andhydraulic control valve 3-42 are specifically explained in conjunction with Fig. 11 to Fig. 16. (lift arm support body 339)<br>
The lift arm support body 339 includes, as shown in Fig. 13 to Fig. 16, a ring-like mounting member 343 which mounts the lift arm support body 339 in alignment with a peripheral portion of the opening portion 106 formed in a ceiling portion of the differential gear casing 55, the cylindrical hydraulic circuit body support member 34C which is raised upwardly at a front portion of the mounting member 343 so as to support the hydraulic circuit body 341, and a pair of left and right pivoting members 345, 345 which are raised upwardly at a rear portion of the mounting member<br><br>
343	so as to pivotally support the lift arm support shaft<br>
344	.<br>
Further, mounting bolt holes 346 which constitute a plurality of (ten pieces in this embodiment) mounting holes are formed in the mounting member 343 in a state that the mounting holes are positioned at a front side and left and right sides of a pair of left and right pivoting members 345, 345 and between both pivoting members 345, 345. Here, the mounting bolt holes 346 positioned between both pi voting members 345, 345 are arranged close to the lift arm support shaft 344 which is pivotally supported by the pi voting members 345, 345.<br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 14 and Fig. 16, one mounting bolt hole 346 is formed in a front end portion of the mounting member 343. At left-and-right symmetrical positions with respect to a lateral imaginary center line C2 which extends in the fore-and-aft direction passing through the center of the mounting bolt hole 346, four mounting bolt holes 346 are formed respectively in a spaced apart manner with a fixed distance in the fore-and-aft direction. One mounting bolt hole 346 is formed in a rear portion of the mounting ir.ember 343 on the above-mentioned lateral imaginary center line C2. With respect to the mounting bolt hole 346 formed in the rear portion of the mounting member 343, in a portion of the mounting member 343 which is positioned between the pair of left and right pivoting members 345, 345 and right below the lift arm support shaft 344, a recessed portion<br><br>
347 which is opened at an upper portion and a rear portion is formed, and the mounting bolt hole 346 is formed in the recessed portion 347.<br>
In this manner, due to the wall shape of the left and right pivoting members 345, 345, it is possible to ensure the sufficient strength and hence, it is unnecessary to form walls on the mounting member 343 other than both pivoting members 345, 345.<br>
Further, the mounting bolt holes 346 which are formed between the pair o~: the left and right pivoting members 345,<br>
345	formed on the mounting member 343 are formed in the<br>
recessed portion 347 which is formed in the portion of the<br>
mounting member 343 which is positioned between the pair<br>
of left and right pivoting members 345, 345 and right below<br>
the lift arm support shaft 344.  Accordingly, it is possible<br>
to arrange the mounting bolt holes 346 formed between the<br>
pivoting members 345, 345 close to the lift arm support shaft<br>
344 which is pivotally supported by the pivoting members<br>
345, 345 whereby even when a tensile load acts on the lift<br>
arm support: shaft 344, a bending moment does not act on a<br>
rear port ion of the mounting member 343 whereby it is possible<br>
to make the mount ing member 343 light-weighted by decreas ing<br>
a wall thickness of the mounting member 343.<br>
Further, it is possible to form the mounting bolt holes<br>
346	in the mounting member 343 at front, rear, left and right<br>
positions in a well-balanced manner whereby it is possible<br>
to ensure the sufficient mounting strength of the mounting<br><br>
member 343.<br>
Further, all mounting bolt holes 346 can be formed in the mounting member 343 from above thus facilitating the hole forming operation.<br>
Further, since the mounting operation of the mounting member 343 can be performed using one kind of tool, the mounting operation of the mounting member 343 car. be simpli fied.<br>
Still further, the lift arm support shaft 344 car. be formed by molding using only compact two-split upper and lower molds without requiring a core and without extending the mounting member 343 rearwardly and hence, it is possible to manufacture the lift arm support shaft 344 at a low cost.<br>
In upper portions of the pair of left and right pivoting members 345, 345, as shown in Fig. 15, support shaft insertion holes 345, 348 which respectively open in the lateral direction are formed. The lift arm support shaft 344 which has an axis thereof arranged in the lateral direction is extended between both support shaft insertion holes 348, 348 in a state both sides of the lift arm support shaft 344 are inserted into both support shaft insertion holes 348, 348 in a penetrating manner. Proximal end portions of the respective lift arms 350, 350 are mounted on left/right-side end portions 349, 349 of the lift arm support shaft 344.

As described above, the circuit body block 355 is formed in the upper and lower two-layered state consisting of the upper-layer oil passage forming surface portion 357 and the lower-layer oil passage forming surface portion 358, wherein in the respective oil passage forming surface portions 357, 358, the oil passages which extend in the for-and-aft direction and the lateral direction  (the left-and-right direction) are formed and, at the same time, the given oil passages are connected in a state that the oil passages cross each other orthogonally.  Further, in the circuit body block 355, the oil passages which extend in the vertical direction are formed and connect either one<br><br>
of oil passages which are formed in the upper-layer oil passage forming surface portion 357 and the lower-layer oil passage forming surface portion 358 with the hydraulic control valve 342 described later in an orthogonal state. Accordingly, it is possible to easily and surely form the hydraulic passage in the inside of the circuit body block 355.<br>
Here, the directions of the oil passages are not limited to the fore-and-aft direction and the left-arid-iight direction so long as the oil passages are formed on the same plane and the oil passages can be formed by extending in the given directions in conformity with the extending directions of the hydraulic pipes with which the oil passages are connected . As a result, it is poss ible to easily per form the connection operation and the piping operation of the hydraulic pipes.<br>
Further, the connecting flange portion 356 of the hydraulic circuit body 341 is, as shown in Fig. 13, Fig. 17 and Fig. 18, formed in a state that the connecting flange portion 356 is, as a lid, capable of closing an upper surface of the above-mentioned hydraulic circuit body support member 340 formed in the lift arm support body 339, and a plurality of bolt insertion holes 390 are formed in a peripheral port ion thereof.<br>
Still further, in an upper end surface of the hydraulic circuit body support member 340, a plurality of bolt thread holes 391 which are aligned with the above-mentioned bolt<br><br>
insertion holes 390 are formed.  By aligning the respective bolt insertion holes 390 formed in the connecting flange portion 356 with the respective bolt thread holes 391 and, at the same time, by threadedly inserting connecting bolts 392 into both holes 390, 391, it is possible to detachably connect the hydraulic circuit body 341 to the hydraulic circuit body support member 340. (hydraulic control valve 342)<br>
The hydraulic control valve 342 includes, as shown in Fig. 17 and Fig. 18, a valve body 395 and a spool 396 which is ihterlockingly connected with the valve body 395, wherein the valve body 395 is mounted on a lower surface of the hydraulic circuit body 341 by way of a spacer 397 in a state that the valve body 395 extends downwardly and the spool 396 extends rearwardly from the valve body 395.<br>

Further, in the inside of the drain receiving space S , the drain which is discharged through the respective valves mounted in the hydraulic circuit body 341 is recovered.<br>
Here, the valve cover body 387 is formed in a box shape<br><br>
having an open-ended upper surface, wherein an upper end peripheral portion 389 of the valve cover body 387 is hermetically mounted on a lower surface of the hydraulic circuit body 341 using mounting bolts 398 .

In this manner, by mounting the valve cover body 387 on the hydraulic circuit body 341 which is detachably mounted on the lift arm support body 339 and by housing the hydraulic control valve 342 in the inside of the valve cover body 387, it is possible to perform the performance/function inspection of the hydraulic control valve 342 as a single unit before mounting the hydraulic circuit body 341 and the valve cover body 387 on the lift arm support body 339.<br>
As a result, it is possible to realize the easiness of the performance/function inspection, theminiaturization of the inspection device, and easiness of handling which requires human power.<br>
Further, with respect to the valve cover body 387, as shown in Fig. 13, Fig. 17 and Fig. 18, thehydrauliccircuit body 341 is mounted on the hydraulic circuit body support member 340 and a lower portion 402 of the valve cover" body<br><br>
387 is arranged in the inside of the transmission casing 46 in a state that the valve cover body 387 extends downwardly from the hydraulic circuit body 341.<br>
In this manner, by mounting the hydraulic circuit body 341 on the differential gear casing 55 by way of the lift arm support body 339, since the sealing of the mounting surface of the lift arm support body 339 on the differential gear casing 55 becomes one place and hence, the conventional sealing method can be adopted.<br>
Further, since the lower port ion 402 of the valve cover body 387 is arranged in the inside of the differential gear casing 55, it is possible to set a height above a ground of the hydraulic circuit body 341 at a low level whereby it is possible to largely ensure the degree of freedom in designing a mounting height of a driver's seat which is arranged right above the hydraulic circuit; body 341.<br>
Further, the spool 396 of the above-mentioned hydraulic control valve 342 can be manipulated using an elevating/lowering lever 404 (see Fig. 15) by way of a spool actuator 403 which is formed on a rear portion of the hydraulic circuit body support member 340 and, at the same time, the stopping of elevating/lowering can be per formed by a feedback link mechanism 405.<br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 13, Fig. 15 and Fig. 16, in an operating member insertion hole 406 which is formed in the rear portion of the hydraulic circuit body support member 340, the rod-iike spool actuator 403 which has an<br><br>
axis thereof extended in the fore-and-aft direction is inserted in a slidable manner in the fore-and-aft direction, and the spool actuator 403 is arranged to face the spool 396 of the hydraulic control valve 342 on the same axis as the spool 396 in the fore-and-aft direction.<br>
Further, a rear portion of the spool actuator 403 is supported on the mounting member 343 by way of an operating member support body 407, a center portion of a tilting member 408 which extends in the lateral direction is pivotally supported on a rear end portion of the spool actuator 403 using a pivotal ly supporting pin 4 09 which has an axis thereof directed vertically, left and right-side engaging pins 410, 411 which are respectively formed on left and right-side end portions of the tilting member 408 are formed in a state that the engaging pins 410, 411 project upwardly. Further, a left-side engaging operating pin 412 of the feedback link mechanism 405 is engaged with the left-side engaging pin 410 from behind, while a right-side engaging operating pin 413 which is interlockingly connected with the elevating/lowering lever 404 is engaged with a right-side engaging pin 411 from behind.<br>
Further, the feedback link mechanism 405 is constituted as follows. A left-side boss portion 414 which extends in the lateral direction is formed on a rear left-side portion of the mounting member 343, a left-side interlocking shaft 415 is inserted in the left-side boss portion 414, a proximal end portion of an interlocking arm 416 is mounted<br><br>
on a left-side end portion of the left-side interlocking shaft 415, a distal end portion of the connecting rod 417 is connected to a distal end portion of the interlocking arm 416 ina state that the connecting position is adjustable, and a rear end portion of the connecting rod 417 is connected with a distal end portion of an interlocking member 418 which is formed on a left-side end portion of the lift arm support shaft 109 in a state that the interlocking member 418 is projected upwardly. Numerals 419, 420 indicate connecting pins and numeral 421 indicates a fixing bolt.<br>
Ontheother hand, a left-side interlocking projecting member 422 is formed on a right-side end portion of the left-side interlocking shaft 415 in a state that the left-side interlocking projecting member 422 projects downwardly, while the above-mentioned left-side engaging operating pin 412 is formed on a lower end portion of the left-side interlocking projecting member 422 in a state that the left-side engaging operating pin 412 projects rightwardly from the lower end portion of the left-side interlocking projecting member 422.<br>
Further, a right-side boss portion 423 which extends in the lateral direction is formed on a rear right-side port ion of the mounting member 343, a right-side interlocking shaft 424 is inserted in the right-side boss portion 423, and a proximal end portion of the above/mentioned elevating/lowering lever 404 is interlockingly connected with a right-side end portion of the right-side interlocking<br><br>
shaft 424 . On the other hand, a right-side interlocking projecting member 425 is formed on a left-side end portion of the right-side interlocking shaft 424 in a state that the right-side interlocking projecting member 425 projects downwardly, while the above-mentioned right-side engaging operating pin 413 is formed on a lower end portion of the right-side interlocking projecting -ember 425 in a state that the right-side engaging operating pin 413 projects leftwardly from the lower end portion of the right-side interlocking projecting member 425.<br>
Here, in the same manner as the above-ment icned main/sub transmission levers 85, 142, the elevating/lowering lever 404 is arranged on a right side of the driver's seat 283 in a concentrated manner so as tc ensure the favorable operability of these levers 85, 142, 404.<br>
In this manner, when the elevation manipulation. is performed by rotating the elevating/lowering lever 404 rearwardly, the right-side engaging operating pin 413 is engaged with the right-side engaging pin 411 from behind and pushes a right-side end portion of the tilting mer.ber 408 forwardly by way of the right side engaging pin 411.<br>
Here, since the left-side end portion of the tilting member 408 is fixed by the left-side engaging operating pin 412 by way of the left-side engaging pin 410, the spool actuator 403 which is connected to a center portion of the tilting member 408 using a pivotally supporting pin 409 is slidably moved frontwardly so as to ?.ilow the spool 396 to<br><br>
slide forwardly against a resilient biasing force of the compression spring 401.<br>
As a result, the valve body 395 is operated toward the elevation sidesoastoopenthe valve, and the pressurized oil is supplied under pressure to the lift cylinders 351, 351 so as to extend both lift cylinders 351, 351 whereby the lift arms 110, 110 which are interlockingly connected, with the respective lift cylinders 351, 351 are rotated upwardly.<br>
Then, the feedback link mechanism 405 is interlockingly operated with the upward rotation of the lift arms 110, 110 and hence, the left-side engaging operating pin 412 of the feedback link mechanism 405 is rotated rearwardly and the fixing of the left-side end portion of the tilting member 408 by way of the left-side engaging pin 410 is released. As a result, the spool 396 is slidably moved rearwardly due to the resilient biasing force of the compression spring 401 and, at a point of time that the spool returns to a neutral position, the valve body 395 performs the valve-closing operation so as to stop the inflow of the pressurized oil into the lift cylinders 351, 351.<br>
Further, when the lowering manipulation is performed by rotating the elevating/lowering lever 404 frontwardly, the right-side engaging operating pin 413 is separated from the right-side engaging pin 411.<br>
As a result, due to the resilient biasing force of the compression spring 401, the spool 396 is slidably moved<br><br>
rearwardly and hence, the valve body 395 performs the valve-opening operation to the lowering side for lovrering the lift cylinders 351, 351. The pressurized oil which is supplied to both lift cylinders 351, 351 under pressure flows out from the lift cylinders 351, 351 and hence, both lift cylinders 351, 351 are contracted whereby the lift arrr.s 110, 110 which are interlockingly connected with the respective lift cylinders 351, 351 perform the Jowering rotation.<br>
Here, since the left-side end portion of the tilting member 408 is fixed by the left-side engaging operating pin 412 by way of the left-side engaging pin 410, the spool actuator 403 which is connected with the center portion of the tilting member 408 by way of the pivotally supporting pin 409 is slidably moved rearwardly whereby the right-side end portion of the tilting member 408 is moved rearv;ardly by way of the right-side engaging pin 411.<br>
Then, the feedback link mechanism 4:5 is interlockingly operated with the downward rotation of the liftarmsllO, HOandhence, the left-side engaging operating pin 412 of the feedback link mechanism 405 is rotated frontwardly and pushes the left-side end portion of the tilting member 408 frontwardly by way of the left-side engaging pin 410 and hence, the spool 396 is slidably moved frontwardly against the resilient biasing force of the compression spring 401 and, at a point of time that the spool 396 returns to a neutral position, the valve body 395 performs the valve-closing operation so as to stop the outflow of<br><br>
the pressurized oil to the lift cylinders 351, 351.<br>
Here, in the feedback link mechanism 405, by adjusting the connecting position between the distal end portion of the interlocking arm 416 and the distal end portion of the connecting rod 417, it is possible to adjust the neutral position of the spool 396.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 11, an opening portion 111 is formed in a rear end of the differential gear casing 55 and a PTO transmission portion 6 is mounted in the opening portion 111. The constitution of the PTO transmission portion 6 is explained later, (differential mechanism 48)<br>

Then, the output bevel gear 180 is interlockingly connected with the respective rear axle input gears 181, 181 by way of the differential mechanism 48.<br>
That is, the differential mechanism 48 is configured as follows. A large speed reduction gear 183 which is meshed with the above-mentioned output bevel gear 180 is mounted on an outer peripheral surface of a differential gear casing<br><br>
182. On the other hand, in the inside of the differential gear casing 182, a pair of front and rear small differential gears 185, 185 are rotatably mounted by way of a small differential gear support shaft 184 which extends in the fore-and-aft direction and, at the same time, a pair of left and right large differential gears 187, 187 are mounted by way of apair of left and right large differential gear support shafts 186, 186 extending in the lateral direction. The respective large differential gears 187, 187 are meshed with both small differential gears 185, 185.<br>
Then, on cylindrical communication connect ion member s 188, 188 which are integrally formed on left and right side portions of the differential gear casing 182, a pair of left and right cylindrical shaft support bodies 189, 189 which have axes thereof directed in the lateral direction are detachably fitted thus communicably connecting the cylindrical communication connection members 188, 188 and the cylindrical shaft support bodies 189, 189witheachorher. The above-mentioned large differential gear support shafts 186, 186 are inserted into and are supported by the respective left and right cylindrical shaft support bodies 189, 189 after passing through the respective cylindrical communication connection members 188, 188.

Accordingly, the operator can perceive the response which satisfies his taste with his hand and hence, the operabilityof the ma in transmission lever 8 5 can be enhanced.<br>
Here, since the branch position temporarily holding portion 314, different from the transmission position temporarily holding portion 323, does not perform the function of preventing the removal of the gear at the time<br><br>
of power transmission and hence, it is unnecessary to hold the temporary holding strength to a fixed value or more whereby it is possible to freely adjust the temporarily holding strength such that the operator can obtain the response which satisfies his taste with his hand.<br>
Further, since the adjusting tab member 434 is formed in a state that the adjusting tab member 434 projects in the substantially same axial direction as the main/sub transmission levers 85, 142, the operator can easily grasp the adjusting tab member 434 from above and, at the same time, it is possible to perform the temporarily holding adjustment by the adjustment tab member 434 smoothly and surely.<br>

Further, one portion of the rear wall of the valve cover body 387 is formed by a sealing member 399 which has a sealing structure and a sub spool projecting hole 445 which is opened in the fore-and-aft direction is formed in the center portion of the sealing member 399 and the above-mentioned sub spool 440 is slidably inserted in the fore-and-aft direction in the sub'spool projecting hole 445. Numeral 446 indicates a sealing ring.<br>
Further, the spool 396, the sub spool 440 and the spool actuator 403 are arranged on an approximately same axis which extends in the fore-and-aft direction.<br>
Stilj further, by connecting an elevating/lowering lever (not shown in the drawing) for performing the elevating and lowering manipulation of lift arms 350, 350 interlockingly with the spool actuator 403 and, at the same time, as shown in Fig. 2, by interposing a feedback link mechanism 405 between the spool actuator 403 and the left lift arm 350, the elevation and lowering of the lift arms 350, 350 can be stopped by the feedback link mechanism 405.<br>
That is, when the lift arms are elevated by rotatably<br><br>
manipulating the elevating/lowering lever in the rearward direction, the spool actuator 403 is slidably moved in the frontward direction, whereby the spool 396 is slidably moved forwardly against s resilient biasing force of the compression spring 401 by way of the sub spool 440.<br>
As a result, the valve main body 395 is manipulated to open the valve on the elevation side, the pressurized oil is supplied to the lift cylinders 351, 351 and both lift cylinders 351, 351 are extended, whereby the lift arms 350, 350 which are interlockingly connected to the respective lift cylinders 351, 351 are rotatably elevated.<br>
Then, when the feedback link mechanism 405 is interlocked with the rotatable elevation of the lift arms 350, 350 and the slidable movement o,f the spool actuator 403 in the frontward direction is released due to the feedback link mechanism 405, the spool 396 is slidably moved in the rearward direction by the resilient biasing force of the compression spring 401 and returns to the neutral position, and the valve main body 395 is manipulated to close the valve, whereby the flow in of the pressurized oil (working oil) into the lift cylinders 351, 351 is stopped.<br>
As a result, the lift arms 350, 350 assume the state in which the lift arms 350, 350 are hydraulically locked at the elevation rotating position thus holding the posture .<br>
Further, when the lowering manipulation is performed by rotating the elevating/lowering lever in the frontward direction, the spool actuator 403 is slidably moved in the<br><br>
rearward direction, whereby the spool 396 is slidably moved in the rearward direction by the resilient biasing force of the compression spring 401.<br>
As a result, the valve main body 395 is manipulated to open the valve in the lowering side, the pressurized oil which is supplied to the lift cylinders 351, 351 is made to flow out and both lift cylinders 351, 351 are contracted whereby the lift arms 350, 350 which are interlockingly connected to the respective lift cylinders 351, 351 are rotated downwardly.<br>
Then,  when the1 feedback link mechanism 405 is interlocked with the lowering rotation of the lift arms 350, 350 and the slidable movement of the spool actuator 403 in the rearward direction is released by the feedback link mechanism 405, the spool 396 is slidably moved in the frontward direction against the resilient biasing force of the compression spring 4 01 and returns to the neutral position, and the valve main body 395 are manipulated to close the valve whereby the flow-out of the pressurized oil fron the lift cylinders 351, 351 is stopped.<br>
As a result, the lift arms 350, 350 assume the state in which the lift arms 350, 350 are hydraulically locked at the lowering rotated position thus holding the posture.<br>
Here, in this embodiment, by mounting the sealing member 399 having a sealing structure to the valve cover body 387, by forming the sub spool projecting hole 445 in the sealing member 399, and by allowing the sub spool 440<br><br>
to penetrate the sub spool projecting hole 445, and by interposing the sub spool 440 between the spool 396 provided to the hydraulic control valve 342 and the spool actuator 403, even when the accuracy of concentricity of the spool 396 and the sub spool projecting hole 445 is made more or less offset due to a mounting error of the hydraulic control valve 342, it is possible to sufficiently ensure the slide operation of the sub spool 440 in the sub spool projecting hole 445 and hence, it is possible to surely transmit an actuation force of the spool actuator 403 to the spool 396 by way of the sub spool 440.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to favorably ensure the hydraulic control performed by the hydraulic control valve 342.<br>
Further, in this embodiment, as shown in the partially enlarged view of Fig. 22, a front end surface 441 which constitutes a contact surface of the sub spool 440 with the spool 396 is formed in an arcuate surface which bulges frontwardly.<br>
In this mariner, since the front end surface 441 which defines the contact surface of the sub spool 440 is forr.ed in an arcuate surface which bulges frontwardly, even when the accuracy of concentricity of the spool 396 and the sub spool projecting hole 445 is made more or less offset due to a mounting error, it is possible to surely transmit an actuation force of the spool actuator 403 from the sub spool 440 to the spool 396 by way of the contact surfaces and hence,<br><br>
it is possible to ensure the hydraulic control performed by the hydraulic control valve 342 in a more favorable manner .<br>
Here, by forming a rear end surface 442 as a contact surface of the spool 396 with the sub spool 440 in an arcuate surface which bulges rearwardly, the substantially same advantageous effect can be obtained.<br>
Further, the front end surface 444 which constitute a contact surface of the spool actuator 403 with the sub spool 440 is also formed in an arcuate surface which bulges frontwardly.<br>
In this manner , even when the accuracy of concentricity of the spool actuator 403 and the sub spool projecting hole 445 is made more or less offset due to a mounting error, it is possible to surely transmit an actuation force of the spool actuator 403 to the sub spool 440 by way of the contact surfaces and hence, it is possible to ensure the hydraulic control performed by the hydraulic control valve 342 in a more favorable manner.<br>
