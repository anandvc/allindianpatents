				<td> <br><br>
This inventioa relates to an improved seat-ejector system for hinge type seat of two-wheelers and comprising the same in seat assembly of two-wheelers.<br>
As known, in the front hinge-type of seat assembly of any 2-wheeler, one of the brackets is rigidly connected to the bottom base/panel of the seat and other is connected to the top surface of the vehicle frame. They are pivotally connected together by means of hinge pm fastened thereto. On the other (rear) end of the seat-assembly, the spring-loaded latch of a seat-lock is provided in at least in any one of the former and latter parts. The hook is provided in the other part for locking with seat-latch. The lockmg is normally capable of being done automatically against the spring-load of this seat-lock due to the own gravitational force on seat assembly, when the seat is dropped from the normal open-position for the customer's convenience.<br>
When the seat-lock is opened by using one hand against its seat-lock-spring-load for the seat opening, the inevitable-primary problem found will be as follows. Until the seat-latch and its hook are just relieved from each other by keeping in open-condition of the seat-lock using one hand, the seat rear-end is to be simultaneously lifted by the other hand. The usage of both hands for opening the seat until both the seat-latch and the hook are just relieved from each other, is difficult at all times.<br>
This problem has already been solved in known art by the seat-locking<br>
system   comprising  a locking system and the ejector which are integrated<br><br>
to each other to both open and eject/life the seat assembly while opening.<br>
;es:   Its<br>
complicated construction results in weight-increase, higher cost and more maintenance.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide a aser-friendly system of the seat ejector with simpler and lighter construction for seat opening.<br>
The improved seat-ejector system for hinge type seat of two-wheelers comprises elastic means provided between the vehicle frame and the seat-bottom base/panel so as to open/eject the said seat assembly about its pivot provided therebetween; the said elastic-means consisting of an elastic-member and a con strain-member, operitively connected to either the bottom surface of said seat assembly or the top surface of said frame the said elastic-member being eiastically loaded between the said seat-bottom base and the top surface of said frame, while only closing the scat; the said constrain-member allowing the expansion of said elastic-member only up to a predetermined travel but, substantially constraining the expansion of said elastic-member beyond said predetermined travel, the maximum pre-detennined limit of the said elastic member is such that it enables the seat-lock to automatically lock, when the seat is dropped from normal opened position, but while fully closing the said seat, the said elastic-load of the eletic-member has its minimum limit to substantially lift/eject the said seat<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	An improved seat-ejector system for hinge type seat of two-wheelers comprising elastic means provided between the vehicle frame and the seat-bottom base/panel so as to open/eject the said seat assembly about its pivot provided therebetween; the said elastic-means consisting of an elastic-member and a constrain-member, operatively connected to either the bottom surface of said seat assembly or the top surface of said frame the said elastic-member being elastically loaded between the said seat-bottom base and the top surface of said frame, while only closing the seat; the said constrain-member allowing the expansion of said elastic-member only up to a predetermined travel but, substantially constraining the expansion of said elastic-member beyond said predetermined travel, the maximum pre-determined limit of the said elastic member is such that it enables the seat-lock to automatically lock, when the seat is dropped from normal opened position, but while fully closing the said seat, the said elastic-load of the elastic-member has its minimum limit to substantially lift/eject the said seat assembly against its gravity-force and inertia,<br>
2.	An improved seat-ejector system for hinge type seat of two-wheelers as claimed in claim 1, wherein the elastic-means comprises a helical coiled compression spring, a retainer-cup having a cavity-space in which one end of said spring is rested/connected to and which is connected beneath a part as m integral or attached part to the said frame and is provided with a hole through which the said seat base or its part transmits the load to the said spring and a spring-plate kept<br><br>
between said frame part and  spring and wherein the said spring and spring plate are held between the said frame part and retainer-cup and the seat base and the said spring are capable of transmitting the spring-load and its strain-energy from each other by said spring plate.<br>
3.	An improved sort-ejector system for hinge type seat of two-wheelers<br>
as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the plunger shaped part is provided<br>
beneath the seat base as an integral part therof or an attachment<br>
therewith and wherein the transmission of the spring-force and its strain-energy is carried-out between the said seat base and spring plate by said plunger shaped part.<br>
4.	An improved seat-ejector system for hinge type seat of two-wheelers<br>
as claimed in claims 2 and 3, wherein the said retainer-cup is capable<br>
of detachable from the said frame part.<br>
. An improved seat-ejector system for hinge type seat of two-wheelers as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein the mounting of said retainer-cup is done on the top surface of said seat-base which is also provided with a hole through which said spring held inside the said retainer-cup is capable of communicating with said plunger part connected to the top surface of said frame part to transmit  the spring-load and its strain-energy from each other.<br>
6.    An improved seat-ejector system for hinge type seat of two-wheelers as claimed in claims 2 to 5, wherein the said plunger part attached or<br><br>
integrated to either the seat base or the frame part is eliminated by providing the modified -shape in the sa9id spring plate with plunger shape protruding upward and across the said hole in either said frame<br>
part or seat base and wherein said plunger shaped spring plate is freely<br>
movable across, the said hole up its predetermined position.<br>
7.. An improved seat-ejector system for hinge type seat of two-wheelers<br>
substantially as herein described and illustrated with respect to the<br>
accompanying drawings..<br>
