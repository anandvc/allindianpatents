Fig. 3 is an explanatory drawing showing the non-contact card brought close to a desk and a detection area by the keyboard provided with a detecting section for detecting the non-contact card.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Next, referring to the drawings, a computer system according to the present invention will be described.<br>
The computer system according to the present invention is constituted by a computer terminal 1 and a portable non- contact card 2 which can be used with the portable non-contact card suspended from the neck and others of a user who operates the computer terminal 1 as shown in Fig. 1. The computer terminal 1 is constituted by a keyboard 3 which is input means, a display 4, the body 5 of a computer not shown and others.<br>
The non-contact card 2 is constituted by a<br>
resonance circuit 6 consisting of a coil and a capacitor, a rectifier 7 connected to the resonance circuit 6, a voltage regulator 8 connected to the rectifier 7 for generating supply voltage in the non-contact card, a clock<br>
regenerating circuit 9, a demodulator 10, a microcomputer 11, a modulator 12 and nonvolatile memory FeRAM 13 as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Personal identification informa±ion is written to the nonvolatile memory FeRAM 13, at least a password proper to an individual and a code for guaranteeing identity are included in the personal identification information and further, information such as accessible file name and data type in a usable computer system is also written.<br>
A communication section 14 for communicating with the non-contact card 2 is provided to the keyboard 3 in addition to operating keys as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.<br>
The communication section 14 is arranged suitably, for example on the side face and others opposite to the user side of the keyboard so that it does not hinder the operation of arranged keys. Information received by the communication section 14 is transmitted together with data input via the keys to the body of the computer 5 via a cable 15 and the display 4.<br>
Information may be also transmitted between the keyboard 3 and the display 4 not via the cable 15 but by wireless. Information may be also transmitted between the display 4 and the body of the computer 5 not via the cable but by wireless.<br>
When the communication section 14 constituted as<br>
described above detects the non-contact card 2, personal identification information stored in the non-contact card 2 is transmitted to the communication section 14, is supplied to the body of the computer 5 via the cable 15 and the display 4, and the body of the computer 5 authenticates a user. A user table is stored on a storage medium such as a hard disk and memory of the body of the computer 5. The personal identification information of at least one user accessible to the body of the computer 5 is stored in the user table.<br>
Therefore, the body of the computer 5 authenticates. by comparing stored personal identification information and personal identification information received from the non-contact card 2. Personal identification information is transmitted from the keyboard 3 to the body of the computer 5 according to the same format as data input via the keys of the keyboard 3.<br>
If personal identification information transmitted from the non-contact card 2 is authenticated by the body of the computer 5 and the body of the computer judges that the owner of the non-contact card is a real user, login for access to the body of the computer 5 and for access to a network connected to the body of the computer 5 is automatically executed. In the meantime, if as a result of the authentication, the body of the computer judges that<br>
the owner of the non-contact card is an invalid user, a message reporting the above is displayed on the display 4 and login for access to the body of the computer 5 and the network is not executed.<br>
When a user starts the operation of a predetermined file or predetermined data, it is identified whether the above user is provided with access authority to the predetermined file or data or not. That is, if the body of the computer 5 accepts an instruction by a user to start the operation of a new file or new data, a command to transmit the information of an accessible file name or data type stored in the non-contact card 2 is output to the non-contact card 2 via the display 4 and the keyboard 3. In the non-contact card 2, the microcomputer 11 recognizes the command received via the clock regenerating circuit 9 and the demodulator. .10, reads the information of the file name or data type stored in FeRAM 13 to which the user can access and outputs the information to the modulator 12. As described above, the information of the file name or data type to which the user can access is modulated and transmitted to the body of the computer 5 via the communication section 14 of the keyboard 3 and the display 4. The body of the computer 5 compares the transmitted information of the file name or data type to which the user can access and the file name or data which the user starts the operation. If the result of the comparison coincides,<br>
the body of the computer 5 allows access to the file or data of which the user instructs to start the operation and if the result of the comparison does not coincide, the body of the computer instructs the display 4 to display a message reporting that the access is disabled.<br>
Communication between the non-contact card 2 and the communication section 14 is executed every predetermined time, for example every 30 seconds. Hereby, if a user temporarily leaves his/her seat at work, communication between the communication section 14 and the non-contact card 2 is disabled. The body of the computer 5 detects the above state in which communication is disabled, stores a file or data at work and inhibits the change of the file or data at work until the user returns to his/her seat and communication between the communication section 14 and the non-contact card 12 is enabled again. Further, the body of the computer 5 executes processing for a power saving mode such as activating a screen saver to prevent the CRT display 4 from seizing, darkening the screen of the display and stopping the rotation of a hard disk. When the user returns to his/her seat and communication between the communication section 14 and the non-contact card 2 is restarted, the body of the computer 5 enables the update of the file or data at work, executes processing for releasing the power saving mode such as the termination of the screen saver and lightening the screen of the display 4 and<br>
returns the current state to a state in which operation is enabled.<br>
An area provided to the keyboard 3 in which the communication section 13 can communicate is limited to a fixed range W shown in Figs. 1 and 3 and in this embodiment in which the communication section 13 is provided to the keyboard 3, the above area is limited to the spherical area W with the keyboard 3 as the center.<br>
The non-contact card 2 suspended from the neck and others of a user is automatically located in the vicinity of the keyboard 3 by setting a communicable area as described above if the user sits on a chair 17, for example to use the computer terminal 1 on the table 16 as shown in Fig. 1, that is, in the communicable area W of the communication section 13 provided to the keyboard 13.<br>
Even if a position in which a user works and the body of the computer 5 are separated, the keyboard 3 is normally located close to a user and as a result, located in the communicable area W.<br>
For example, even in an OA room in which plural computer terminals 1 are arranged, communication between the non- contact card 2 and the computer terminal 1 is enabled in units of user by providing the communication section 14 with the non-contact card 2 to the peripheral equipment connected to the body of the computer 5 and<br>
arranged in the vicinity of a user and suitably setting a communicable area W as described above and radio interference between plural non-contact cards 2 and plural computer terminals 1 can be prevented.<br>
If a detected state is bad, the non-contact card 2 has only to approach the keyboard 3 suitably and special adjustment and others are not required.<br>
In this embodiment, the communication section 14 is provided to the keyboard 3, however, the communication section has only to be provided to the peripheral equipment connected to the body of the computer 5 and arranged in the vicinity of a user and it need scarcely be said that the communication section may be also provided to a mouse, a display, a microphone used for the input of voice, a microphone stand, an external storage such as a magneto-optical disc for example and others.<br>
According to the computer system described above, when a user sits on a chair before which a computer terminal is installed, the user is automatically authenticated and login to the body of the computer 5 and a network is executed.<br>
Further, if a user suspends work and leaves his/her seat, that is, goes out of the detection area W, it is judged that work is suspended and security can be kept by darkening the screen of the display 4, automatically saving<br>
a file at work and others. If a message telling that work is continued is displayed on the screen, reported in voice or by both in case in this state, another user tries to access, another person is prevented from interfering during work and security can be kept. It can be also managed when a user starts to work.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above embodiment and various variations are allowed. For example, in the above embodiment, when a user sits on a chair, a computer automatically authenticates the user and executes login, however, a computer may also require a user to input his/her password only when power is applied in consideration of further security. Also, in the above embodiment, information such as an accessible file name and an accessible data type in a computer system is written to a non-contact card, however, accessible file name and data type may be also stored in the hard disk and others of the body of the computer 5 with them and the identification information of a user in pairs. In this case, if the body of the computer 5 accepts an instruction by a user to start the operation of a new file or new data, the body of the computer compares the personal identification information of a user stored with the personal identification information and accessible file name, data type and others stored in the body of the computer 5 in pairs and the personal identification information received to the non-<br>
contact card 2 and if they coincides, the body of the computer allows access to the file or the data.<br>
Further, in the above description of the present invention, a computer is a desktop computer, however, the present invention can be also applied to a portable computer.<br>
As described above, in a computer system according to the present invention, a communication section for communicating with a non-contact card which is excellent in portability is provided to peripheral equipment arranged in the vicinity of a user of a computer terminal, preferably, if a communication section is provided to mobile equipment such as a keyboard and a mouse, the non-contact card 2 suspended from his/her neck and others is automatically located in the vicinity of the keyboard 3 when a user sits on a chair, that is, located in the communicable area W of the communication section 13 provided to the keyboard 3 and a secure detection area can be acquired.<br>
Also, even if a user temporarily leaves his/her seat because communication is periodically made even while the user works, the security of a file and data at work can be kept.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
