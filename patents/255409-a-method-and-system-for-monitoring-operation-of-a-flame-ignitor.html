FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an ignitor for a fossil fuel fired<br>
combustion chamber, and more particularly to an ignitor having improved<br>
performance and reliability.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to begin the combustion process inside a fossil fuel fired<br>
combustion chamber, such as that found in industrial and utility boilers, there<br>
must be an energy source to begin the self-sustaining combustion reaction of<br>
main fuel and air inside the combustion chamber Current practice is to use a<br>
light fuel oil, natural gas, or propane ignitor of a size between input of 0.5 to<br>
20 Million Btu/hr for each of several fuel admission compartments of the<br>
combustion chamber.<br>
Igniters have a dedicated fuel and air supply and an energy source,<br>
typically a spark plug, to produce a flame. In operation, fuel and air are<br>
introduced to the ignitor and a spark provides the energy to begin a self-<br>
sustaining reaction that keeps the ignitor burning. Proof that the ignitor is<br>
operating is established through the use of a flame detector, such as a flame<br>
rod, a thermal sensing device, or an optical sensor, that is often integral with<br>
the ignitor.<br>
Once the ignitor is proven to be operating, main fuel and air for the<br>
combustion chamber can be introduced, often after utilizing the ignitor to<br>
preheat the combustion chamber. The energy from the ignitor (the ignitor<br>
flame), allows the combustion reaction of the main fuel and air to begin.<br><br><br>
Generally, once the main fuel and air is ignited the combustion reaction is<br>
self-sustaining, and the ignitor can be turned off. However, in some cases,<br>
such as due to low volatility of the main fuel, it is necessary to leave the<br>
ignitor on in order to keep the main combustion reaction continuing. In other<br>
cases, ignitors are left to burn continuously, as may be required by safety<br>
laws.<br>
For reasons of safety it is important that the ignitor reliably begin<br>
burning on command, and that it be able to be confirmed that the ignitor is<br>
producing a flame to insure the safe combustion of the main fuel and air.<br>
Failure of an ignitor can result in unsafe accumulations of unburned main fuel<br>
and air, resulting in massive explosive damage.<br>
In one known type of coal-fired boiler unit, one or more relatively<br>
high-capacity oil burners (warm-up guns) are started by one or more oil- or<br>
gas-fired ignitors to preheat the combustion chamber Once the combustion<br>
chamber has been brought up to the proper starting temperature, coal<br>
nozzles are ignited by the oil- or gas-fired igniters, or by the warm-up guns<br>
themselves.<br>
At higher boiler loads, i.e., when the amount of coal supplied by the<br>
coal nozzles is great, the combustion chamber can typically maintain stable<br>
combustion of the pulverized coal. However, when the load goes down and<br>
the coal supply is thereby decreased, the stability of the pulverized coal flame<br>
is also decreased, and it is therefore common practice to use the igniters or<br>
warm-up guns to maintain flame in the combustion chamber, thus avoiding<br>
the accumulation of unburned coal dust in the combustion chamber and the<br>
associated danger of explosion.<br><br><br>
Certain portions of an ignitor mounted in a windbox compartment of<br>
a combustion chamber are subjected to relatively high temperatures, typically<br>
on the order of 500 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, in some conventional<br>
igniters, there is a risk that an ignitor wire supplying energy to an ignitor spark<br>
element may burn up due to the high temperatures, especially when<br>
insufficient cooling air is supplied to the ignitor. Recently, a gas-fired ignitor<br>
overcoming this problem has been proposed. However, oil-fired igniters are<br>
still subject to this problem. Accordingly, a need exists for an oil-fired ignitor<br>
which provides a reliable spark action and which has improved survivability in<br>
a high temperature environment.<br>
An igniter's spray of fuel and air (the combustive mix) is produced<br>
by an atomizer. The spray produced by conventional atomizers used in oil-<br>
fired igniters frequently has too many large droplets, resulting in insufficient<br>
oxygen at the base of the flame. An insufficient amount of oxygen results in<br>
excessive smoke formation, resulting in an unacceptable opacity from the<br>
stack. Accordingly, a need exists for an oil-fired igniter that produces a spray<br>
with more available oxygen at the flame base.<br>
Introduced above, conventional igniters, no matter the type of<br>
igniter fuel utilized, include some sort of flame sensing device which may be<br>
mechanical or optical. The output of such a flame sensing device is<br>
transmitted to a control room where operational decisions are made based<br>
upon the sensed flame. If no igniter flame is detected when one is expected<br>
to be present, repair personnel must service the non-performing igniter based<br>
upon only the information that a flame is not present. Lack of a flame could<br>
be due to any one of a faulty igniter fuel supply, a faulty igniter compressed<br>
air, or a faulty igniter spark source. Further, a flame could actually be<br><br><br>
present, and the flame detector itself could be sending a false lack of flame<br>
signal. Currently, there is no way for service personnel to know what ignitor<br>
component has failed without physically examining that igniter. Thus, many<br>
man-hours are spent attempting to determine the reason an igniter has failed.<br>
If repair personnel had an indication of a reason for failure prior to beginning a<br>
repair operation, many of those man-hours could be saved. Accordingly, a<br>
need exists for an igniter which provides information indicating which<br>
component has failed.<br>
Aside from an ignitor failure, routine scheduled maintenance of<br>
igniters is typically performed in an effort to prevent failure. A single utility<br>
boiler typically can include upwards of 64 individual igniters that must be<br>
maintained. Performing this routine maintenance is both costly and time<br>
consuming. That is, each ignitor, whether functioning properly or not, is<br>
regularly inspected. If those igniters that required service could be identified,<br>
not only could the time and cost expenses of services all igniters be saved,<br>
but costs associated with ignitor failure, such as boiler down time, could be<br>
saved. Accordingly, a need exists for an ignitor in which the necessity of<br>
service can be determined prior to failure.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an oil-fired ignitor<br>
having reliable spark action in a high temperature environment.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an oil-fired<br>
ignitor having an improved atomizer.<br><br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an ignitor<br>
having higher reliability than conventional igniters.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an igniter<br>
in which an indication of which component, or components, are responsible<br>
for an igniter failure is available.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an igniter in<br>
which the necessity of service can be determined prior to an igniter failure.<br>
The above-stated objects, as well as other objects, features, and<br>
advantages, of the present invention will become readily apparent from the<br>
following detailed description which is to be read in conjunction with the<br>
appended drawings.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Methods and systems for monitoring operation of a flame igniter are<br>
provided herein. The flame igniter is used to begin and/or support the<br>
combustion process inside a fossil fuel fired combustion chamber. A system<br>
includes at least a memory and a processor. A processor can be any type of<br>
processor capable of functioning to implement the techniques described<br>
herein. A memory can be any type of memory capable of storing information<br>
and communicating with a processor.<br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention, multiple inputs from<br>
at least one of a first group of inputs and a second group of inputs are<br>
received. That is, the multiple inputs could all come from the first group,<br><br><br>
could all come from the second group, or come from a mixture of the first and<br>
second groups.<br>
The first group of inputs includes a flame rod voltage, a stop signal<br>
for deactivation of the flame igniter, a fuel supply interruption signal, and an<br>
air supply interruption signal. A flame rod voltage measures the intensity of<br>
flame, with the voltage being proportional to the intensity of the flame. A stop<br>
signal causes the flame ignitor to cease operation. A fuel supply interruption<br>
signal indicates that the fuel supply for the flame igniter has been interrupted,<br>
and an air supply interruption signal indicates that the air supply for the flame<br>
igniter has been interrupted. The second group of inputs includes a start<br>
signal for activation of the flame igniter and a flame proven signal indicating<br>
presence of a flame produced by the flame ignitor A start signal causes the<br>
flame ignitor to begin operation. A flame proven signal indicates that the<br>
ignitor is successfully operating, i.e., producing a flame<br>
If inputs from the first group are received, a determination of a<br>
cause of a failure of the flame ignitor is made. This determination is made<br>
based upon the received inputs from the first group If inputs from the second<br>
group are received, a determination of the reliability of the flame ignitor is<br>
made. This reliability determination is made based upon the received inputs<br>
from the second group. It should be understood that inputs from both groups<br>
may be received.<br><br><br>
In one aspect of this first embodiment, information associated with<br>
one or more determinations made based upon the received inputs is<br>
transmitted. This could include a single transmission, or multiple<br>
transmissions. Further, a transmission could be, as desired, made to a single<br>
entity, or multiple entities. Also, a transmission could be a scheduled<br>
transmission, could be made whenever a determination is made, or could be<br>
made ad hoc.<br>
In a further aspect, the information associated with a determination<br>
is transmitted to at least one of a control room associated with a combustion<br>
chamber with which the flame ignitor is associated, and a location remote<br>
from the control room. In an even further aspect, the remote location is<br>
associated with an entity responsible for servicing the flame ignitor. The<br>
responsible entity could be an entity other than the entity to which the<br>
combustion chamber belongs.<br>
In another aspect of this first embodiment, multiple start signals and<br>
multiple flame proven signals are received. Each received input is stored.<br>
The number of stored flame proven signals is divided by the number of stored<br>
start signals to determine the reliability of the flame ignitor.<br>
In a further aspect, a warning signal is transmitted when the<br>
determined reliability violates a reliability set-point. That is, if the determined<br>
reliability does not meet a predetermined criteria, a warning signal is<br>
transmitted. This transmission could be to the control room, could be to a<br>
remote location, could be to another location, or could be to multiple<br>
locations.<br><br><br>
According to still another aspect of this embodiment multiple inputs<br>
from group one are received. An indication of each received input from group<br>
one is stored. This indication identifies the particular type of group one input<br>
received. Also, a time that each group one input is received is stored. The<br>
cause of failure is determined based, at least in part, upon the stored time<br>
information. In a further aspect, the cause of failure is determined based<br>
upon the first received group one input.<br>
In yet another aspect of the first embodiment, information<br>
associated with one or more determinations is outputted via a display on the<br>
flame ignitor. That is, the flame ignitor has a display that is configured to<br>
show information associated with at least one determination that has been<br>
made based upon the multiple received inputs. This information could be<br>
related to one, or both of, a cause of failure of the flame ignitor and a<br>
reliability of the flame ignitor.<br>
According to a second embodiment for monitoring operation of a<br>
flame scanner, multiple inputs that are each associated with operation of the<br>
flame scanner are received. An operational parameter of the flame ignitor is<br>
then determined based upon one or more of the received inputs In one<br>
aspect of this second embodiment, the determined operational parameter is<br>
one of a cause of a failure of the flame ignitor, and a reliability of the flame<br>
ignitor.<br>
In another aspect of the flame ignitor, each input is one of a flame<br>
rod voltage, a stop signal for deactivation of the flame ignitor, a fuel supply<br>
interruption signal, an air supply interruption signal, a start signal for activation<br>
of the flame ignitor, and a flame proven signal, each discussed above.<br><br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In order to facilitate a fuller understanding of the present invention,<br>
reference is now made to the appended drawings. These drawings should<br>
not be construed as limiting the present invention, but are intended to be<br>
exemplary only.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to Figure 1,<br>
there is depicted a conventional fossil fuel-fired power generation system,<br>
generally designated by the reference numeral 10, having installed therein a<br>
preferred embodiment of the igniter of the present invention. It should be<br>
understood that the ignitor of the present invention could be utilized in.<br>
industrial or utility installations other than that depicted in Figure 1 The fossil<br>
fuel-fired power generation system 10 includes a fossil fuel-fired steam<br>
generator 12 and an air preheater 14.<br><br><br>
The fossil fuel-fired steam generator 12 includes a burner region. It<br>
is within the burner region 16 of the fossil fuel-fired steam generator 12 that<br>
the combustion of fossil fuel and air, in a manner well-known to those skilled<br>
in this art, is initiated. To this end, the fossil fuel-fired steam generator 12 is<br>
provided with a conventional firing system 18.<br>
The firing system 18 includes a housing, preferably in the form of a<br>
windbox 20. The windbox 20 includes a plurality of compartments, each<br>
designated 22. In conventional fashion, some of the compartments 22 are<br>
designed to function as fuel compartments from which fossil fuel is injected<br>
into the burner region 16, while others of the compartments 22 are designed<br>
to function as air compartments from which air is injected into the burner<br>
region 16. The fossil fuel is supplied to the windbox 20 by a conventional fuel<br>
supply means, not shown in the interest of maintaining clarity of illustration in<br>
the drawing. At least some of the air which is injected into the burner region<br>
16 for purposes of effecting combustion of the injected fuel is supplied to the<br>
windbox 20 from the air preheater 14 through the duct 24.<br>
It is within the burner region 16 of the fossil fuel-fired steam<br>
generator 12 that the combustion of the fossil fuel and air is initiated The hot<br>
gases that are produced from this combustion of the fossil fuel and air rise<br>
upwardly in the fossil fuel-fired steam generator 12. During the upwardly<br>
movement thereof in the fossil fuel-fired steam generator 12, the hot gases, in<br>
a manner well-known to those skilled in this art, give up heat to fluid flowing<br>
through tubes (not shown in the interest of maintaining clarity of illustration in<br>
the drawing) that in conventional fashion line all four of the walls of the fossil<br>
fuel-fired steam generator 12. Then, the hot gases flow through the horizontal<br>
pass 26 of the fossil fuel-fired steam generator 12, which in turn leads to the<br><br><br>
rear gas pass 28 of the fossil fuel-fired steam generator 12. Although not<br>
shown in Figure 1, it should be understood that the horizontal pass 26 would<br>
commonly have suitably provided therein some form of a heat transfer<br>
surface. Similarly, heat transfer surface, as illustrated at 30 and 32, is suitably<br>
provided within the gas pass 28. During passage through the rear gas pass<br>
28 the hot gases give up heat to the fluid flowing through the tubes of the heat<br>
transfer surface.<br>
Upon exiting from the rear gas pass 28 of the fossil fuel-fired steam<br>
generator 12 the hot gases are conveyed to the air preheater 14. To this end,<br>
the fossil fuel-fired steam generator 12 is connected from the exit end 34<br>
thereof to the air preheater 14 by means of duct work 36. After passage<br>
through the air preheater 14, the now relatively cooler hot gases are further<br>
conducted to conventional treatment apparatus which are not illustrated in the<br>
interest of clarity.<br>
The fossil fuel-fired steam generator 12 is provided with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the ignitor of the present invention. Figure 2 shows an oil-<br>
fired igniter 200 mounted in one of the windboxes of the fossil fuel-fired steam<br>
generator 12. It should be understood that the fossil fuel-fired steam<br>
generator 12, as well as any other industrial or utility installation, can be<br>
provided with any desired number of the ignitor of the present invention The<br>
ignitor 200 is mounted inside a pipe 201 secured to a windbox wall 205. The<br>
ignitor 200 includes a conventional flame rod 210, a spark extension<br>
assembly 215, a compressed air conduit 225, a fuel conduit 230 collinear and<br>
disposed within the compressed air conduit 225, a bluff body 240 disposed at<br>
the terminus of the compressed air conduit 225, and an atomizer 235<br>
disposed within the bluff body 240.<br><br><br>
The spark extension assembly 215 includes a solid conductor with<br>
an outer ceramic insulation coating, enabling the spark extension assembly<br>
215 to survive temperatures greater than 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. The solid<br>
conductor, preferably made of stainless steel, though it could be any other<br>
conductive metal, connects to an external electrical power source (not shown<br>
in the Figures) at terminus 255. At the opposite end of the spark extension<br>
assembly 215 is a high energy ignitor tip 220. The solid conductor receives<br>
electrical current from the power source and conducts the electrical current to<br>
the high energy ignitor tip 220, which produces a spark to ignite a spray<br>
mixture of the compressed air and fuel released by the atomizer 235. United<br>
States Patent Number 6,582,220, assigned to the assignee of the present<br>
invention and which is incorporated herein in its entirety, discloses an<br>
elongate electrode assembly suitable for use as the spark extension<br>
assembly 215.<br>
The external power source provides a high energy pulse of<br>
electricity to the spark extension assembly 215. Preferably, the pulse is 12<br>
joules for a microsecond pulse period, though other high energy levels and/or<br>
pulse periods could be provided by the external power supply Because of<br>
the high energy pulse, any unburned fuel and combustion products that have<br>
accumulated on the high energy ignitor tip 220 are removed by the resultant<br>
spark. Thus, degradation of the performance of the spark extension<br>
assembly 215 due to build up is prevented.<br>
The spark from the high energy ignitor tip 220 is positioned in the<br>
output spray of the atomizer 235. The spark ignites the compressed air/fuel<br>
spray produced by the atomizer 235. The configuration of the atomizer 235<br>
allows additional compressed air to come straight out of the center of the<br><br><br>
atomizer 235 into the central core of the spray to improve the fuel to air ratio.<br>
This feature results in an increased amount of oxygen at the flame base,<br>
which reduces opacity.<br>
The bluff body 240 is spherical, or essentially spherical, with a<br>
truncated face. The spherical shape minimizes air flow friction losses and<br>
permits substantially greater mass flow of air through the pipe 201, which in<br>
turn allows proper fuel mixing for a greater amount of fuel for combustion.<br>
United States Patent Number 6,443,728, assigned to the assignee of the<br>
present invention and which is incorporated herein in its entirety, discloses a<br>
structure suitable for use as the bluff body 240.<br>
In operation, the flame rod 210 is charged to approximately 40 volts<br>
DC, allowing for an optimum signal-to-noise ratio. As flame ions interact with<br>
the flame rod 210, the voltage dips and rises. These voltage fluctuations are<br>
measured by sensor 265. The measured voltage is transmitted to processing<br>
electronics, to be discussed below.<br>
With reference to Figure 3, the processing electronics 400, which<br>
can, as desired, be housed proximate to or remote from the ignitor 200,<br>
include a digital signal processor 405 and a memory 410. The digital signal<br>
processor 405 communicates with the memory 410. As desired, and as<br>
shown in Figure 3, the digital signal processor 405 and the memory 410 may<br>
be combined into a single unit. The digital signal processor 405 is preferably<br>
of a minimum specification of 16-bit design operating at 40 million instructions<br>
per second, however other designs could be utilized, as desired It should be<br>
understood that the control electronics shown in Figure 3 and described<br>
below can be utilized with igniters burning any type fuel, not just the oil-fired<br><br><br>
ignitor 200 shown in Figure 2.<br>
The digital signal processor 405 includes multiple inputs for<br>
receiving information and multiple outputs for communicating the received<br>
information and determined information to operators and service technicians.<br>
The inputs include the flame rod voltage sensed by sensor 265 discussed<br>
above, a start/stop signal input, a fuel flow switch input, and an air pressure<br>
switch input The start/stop signal input is associated with signals generated<br>
in the control room indicating a desire to activate or deactivate the ignitor 200.<br>
That is, whenever an operator attempts to start the ignitor 200, a start signal<br>
is received at the digital signal processor 405, and whenever an operator<br>
stops the ignitor 200, a stop signal is received at the digital signal processor<br>
405. Indications of these start and stop signals are stored in the memory 410<br>
by the digital signal processor 405, along with a time each was received.<br>
These stored indications will be further discussed below.<br>
The fuel flow switch input receives signals from a fuel line sensor<br>
(not shown in the Figures) on a fuel line to the ignitor 200. Whenever fuel<br>
flow is interrupted, or decreases below a certain level, the fuel line sensor<br>
sends a fuel flow warning signal to the digital signal processor 405. A fuel<br>
flow warning signal causes a trip of the -gnitor 200. In a trip, as well as in an<br>
operator-ordered shut down, the igniter's fuel, air, and spark are discontinued,<br>
causing the ignitor flame to extinguish. The digital signal processor 405<br>
stores an indication of the fuel flow warning signal in the memory 410, along<br>
with the time such was received.<br><br><br>
The air pressure switch input receives signals from a compressed<br>
air line sensor (not shown in the Figures) on a compressed air line to the<br>
ignitor 200. Whenever compressed air flow is interrupted, or decreases<br>
below a certain level, the compressed air line sensor sends a air flow warning<br>
signal to the digital signal processor 405. An air flow warning signal also<br>
causes a trip of the ignitor 200. The digital signal processor 405 stores an<br>
indication of the air flow warning signal in the memory 410, along with the<br>
time such was received.<br>
The memory also stores trip set points associated with the sensed<br>
flame intensity on the flame rod 210. If the DC voltage measured by sensor<br>
265 and input to the digital signal processor 405 violates a trip set point, the<br>
digital signal processor 405 trips the ignitor 200. The digital signal processor<br>
405 also calculates an AC voltage based upon the input DC voltage from<br>
sensor 265. Likewise, if the calculated AC voltage violates a trip set point, the<br>
digital signal processor 405 trips the ignitor 200. Whenever the ignitor 200 is<br>
tripped due to violation of a set point, an indication of such, along with the<br>
time, is stored in the memory 410 by the digital signal processor 405.<br>
Separate from the trip set point processing described above, the<br>
sensed DC voltage and the calculated AC voltage is available as a real-time<br>
output, shown as Flame Intensity AC &amp; DC output. A related output is the<br>
Ignitor Proven output. This output is a state-based output. That is, if the<br>
sensed DC voltage and the calculated AC voltage do not violate a set point, a<br>
high signal is output Whereas, if one or both of the AC and DC voltages<br>
violates a set point, a low signal is output. Outputs will be further discussed<br>
below.<br><br><br>
Also based upon the sensed flame rod DC voltage and calculated<br>
flame rod AC voltage is the Flame Rod Dirty/Shorted output. This output is<br>
also a state-based output. If the flame rod 210 is operating property, the<br>
Flame Rod Dirty/Shorted output will be high. However, if the sensed DC<br>
voltage falls to zero, or another stored value that indicates a shorted flame<br>
rod, the Flame Rod Dirty/Shorted output will be low. Also, the digital signal<br>
processor 405 monitors the calculated AC voltage. Stored in the memory 410<br>
is an indication of an expected AC voltage waveform. If the calculated AC<br>
voltage does not match the expected AC voltage waveform, or deviates from<br>
the expected AC voltage waveform more than an acceptable amount the<br>
Flame Rod Dirty/Shorted output will be low.<br>
The stored information based upon the received inputs discussed<br>
above forms a first-out logic architecture. The first-out architecture aids in<br>
determining why an operating igniter has failed. Whenever an ignitor trips, no<br>
matter the cause, signals indicating improper fuel flow, improper air flow, and<br>
improper voltage, as discussed above, will each be received. This is because<br>
once an ignitor shuts down, fuel and air flow cease, causing the flame to<br>
extinguish, which in turn causes the flame rod to detect a lack of a flame.<br>
Because of stored time information associated with each of these variables,<br>
the cause of the trip can easily be determined. It should be understood that<br>
the stored time information could simply be ordering information, or could be<br>
an actual time. As an example of the first-out logic, if the ignitor 200 trips<br>
because of the an improper fuel flow, the stored indication of improper fuel<br>
How will have the earliest time indication because the improper air flow signal<br>
and the lack of voltage signal will be received subsequent to the improper fuel<br><br><br>
flow signal. The digital signal processor 405 is programmed to determine<br>
which of the stored signals associated with a particular failure was received<br>
first and output this determination to an operator or service technician via the<br>
First-Out Logic output.<br>
Introduced above, an indication of each received start signal is<br>
stored in memory 410. Also stored in memory 410 is an indication of each<br>
actual start. Each time the digital signal processor 405 determines that the<br>
flame rod detects a flame within a certain time period following receipt of a<br>
start signal the digital signal processor 405 stores an indication of a<br>
successful start in the memory 410. The number of received start signals and<br>
the number of successful starts is the basis for determining reliability of the<br>
ignitor. Thus, the digital signal processor 405 divides the number of<br>
successful starts indicated in the memory 410 by the number of received start<br>
signals indicated in the memory 410 to produce a percentage reliability<br>
indication. This information is available via the % Reliability output.<br>
The percentage reliability indication is especially useful in<br>
determining degradation of the spark extension assembly 215, as this<br>
component is most often associated with a failed start attempt. The digital<br>
signal processor 405 is programmed to not only calculate the percentage<br>
reliability, but also report a need for service based upon that information. As<br>
desired, the digital signal processor 405 can be programmed to transmit a<br>
service request when the calculated percentage reliability falls below a certain<br>
set point, stored in memory 410. Alternatively, or perhaps in combination, the<br><br><br>
digital signal processor 405 can be programmed to transmit a service request<br>
when the calculated percentage reliability begins to trend downward, perhaps<br>
even at a predetermined rate stored in the memory 410. A service request is<br>
transmitted via a Link to Remote, to be discussed further below.<br>
The digital signal processor 405 has a user interface through which<br>
all outputs discussed above are available. The user interface includes a<br>
backlit LED bargraph display for communicating each output. Thus, via the<br>
display, an operator or service technician can view the DC and the AC flame<br>
intensity and the percent reliability, as well as the Ignitor Proven and Flame<br>
Rod Dirty/Shorted outputs. Especially beneficial, the digital signal processor-<br>
determined cause of a trip is also available via the display. Also, the user<br>
interface includes a user input, preferably password protected, through which<br>
an operator or service technician can adjust the stored voltage trip set points<br>
and the shorted voltage<br>
Also shown in Figure 3 is the Link to Remote input/output Through<br>
the Link to Remote, all outputs discussed above can be transmitted to a<br>
remote location, such as a local control room, or even a remote monitoring<br>
station. This feature is especially useful for providing the first-out logic<br>
determination to an operator or service technician, and for transmitting a<br>
service request. Also through the Link to Remote, any user inputs can be<br>
communicated to the digital signal processor 405.<br><br>
The Link to Remote output can be, as desired, an Ethernet or serial<br>
connection. Specifically, Device Net, Industrial Ethernet, MODBUS or RS-<br>
232 communication protocols may be utilized. Beneficially, multiple digital<br>
signal processors 405, each associated with a single ignitor 200, can be<br>
serially connected, saving cabling costs.<br>
The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific<br>
