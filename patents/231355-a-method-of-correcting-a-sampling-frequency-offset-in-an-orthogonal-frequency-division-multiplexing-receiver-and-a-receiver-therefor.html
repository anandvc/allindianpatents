				<td>Correction Of A Sampling Frequency Offset in An Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing System<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to processing orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiplexed (OFDM) signals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Orthogonal frequency division multiptexing (OFDM) is a robust technique<br>
for efficiently transmitting data over a channel. The technique uses a plurality of<br>
sub-carrier frequencies (sub-carriers) within a channel bandwidth to transmit the<br>
data. These sub-carriers are arranged for optimal bandwidth efficiency compared<br>
to more conventional transmission approaches, such as frequency division<br>
multiplexing (FDM), which waste large portions of the channel bandwidth in<br>
order to separate and isolate the sub-carrier frequency spectra and thereby avoid<br>
inter-carrier interference (ICI). 3y contrast, although the frequency spectra of<br>
OFDM sub-carriers overlap significantly within the OFDM channel bandwidth,<br>
OFDM nonetheless allows resolution and recovery of the information that has<br>
been modulated onto each sub-carrier.<br>
The transmission of data through a channel via OFDM signals provides<br>
several advantages over more conventional transmission techniques. One<br>
advantage is the tolerance of OFDM to multipath delay spread. This tolerance is<br>
due to the relatively long symbol interval Ts compared to the typical time<br>
duration of the channel impulse response. These long symbol intervals prevent<br>
inter-symbol interference (ISI). Another advantage is the tolerance of OFDM to<br>
frequency selective fading. By including redundancy in the OFDM signal, data<br>
encoded onto fading sub-carriers can be reconstructed from the data recovered<br>
from the other sub-carriers. Yet another advantage is the efficient spectrum<br>
usage in OFDM. Since OFDM sub-carriers are placed in very close proximity to<br>
one another without the need to leave unused frequency space between them,<br>
OFDM can efficiently fill a channel. A further advantage is the simplified sub-<br>
channel equalization of OFDM. OFDM shifts channel equalization from the time<br>
domain (as in single carrier transmission systems) to the frequency domain<br>
where a bank of simple one-tap equalizers can individually adjust for the phase<br>
and amplitude distortion of each sub-channel. A still further advantage is the<br>
good interference properties of OFDM. It is possible to modify the OFDM<br>
spectrum to account for the distribution of power of an interfering signal. Also, it<br>
is possible to reduce out-of-band interference by avoiding the use of OFDM sub-<br>
carriers near the channel bandwidth edges.<br>
Although OFDM exhibits these advantages, prior art implementations of<br>
OFDM also exhibit several difficulties and practical limitations. One difficulty is<br>
the issue of determining and correcting for carrier frequency offset, a major<br>
aspect of OFDM synchronization. Ideally, the receive carrier frequency, fcr,<br>
should exactly match the transmit carrier frequency, fct. if this condition is not<br>
met, however, the mis-match contributes to a non-zero carrier frequency offset,<br>
delta fc, in the received OFDM signal. OFDM signals are very susceptible to such<br>
carrier frequency offset which causes a loss of orthogonality between the OFDM<br>
sub-carriers and results in inter-carrier interference (ICI) and a severe increase in<br>
the bit error rate (BER) of the recovered data at the receiver.<br>
Another difficulty is that of synchronizing the transmitter's sample rate to<br>
the receiver's sample rate to eliminate sampling rate offset. Any mis-match<br>
between these two sampling rates results in a rotation of the 2m -ary sub-symbol<br>
constellation from symbol to symbol in a frame for smaller frequency offsets.<br>
However, for larger frequency offsets, the result is a contraction or expansion of<br>
the frequency spectrum of the received signal. Both of these can contribute to<br>
increased BER. One cause of sampling rate offset is the presence of a sampling<br>
frequency offset. A sampling frequency offset occurs when the receiver<br>
samples the received signal at a frequency that is either higher or lower than the<br>
sample rate used at the transmitter. A sampling frequency offset can be<br>
detrimental to the performance of the receiver, and must be corrected for in<br>
order for the receiver to be properly synchronized. The present invention is<br>
directed to the correction of this problem.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An OFDM receiver samples an incoming signal in the time domain,<br>
multiplies the sampled data by a window function to lower the sidelobes of the<br>
frequency domain spectrum of each of the predetermined subcarriers in order to<br>
reduce interference between the predetermined subcarriers and also to widen the<br>
main lobe such that samples of sufficient magnitude (relative to the noise floor)<br>
will be available on either side of the main peak, takes an FFT (fast Fourier<br>
transform) of the sampled signal to analyze the frequency domain samples of<br>
each predetermined subcarrier, detects a difference in magnitude of the<br>
frequency domain samples on either side of each predetermined subcarrier, and<br>
generates a sampling frequency error based on the detected differences in<br>
magnitude.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more apparent from the following description, given by way of example.<br>
The general principles of OFDM signal transmission can be described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 1-4. Turning now to FIG. 1, a block diagram of a<br>
conventional OFDM transmitter 10 is shown. OFDM transmitter 10 receives a<br>
stream of baseband data bits 12 as its input. These input data bits 12 are fed<br>
into an encoder 14, which takes these data bits 12 in segments of B bits every<br>
Tg +Ts seconds, where Ts is an OFDM symbol interval and Tg is a cyclic prefix<br>
or guard interval. Encoder 14 typically uses a block and/or convolutional coding<br>
scheme to introduce error-correcting and/or error-detecting redundancy into the<br>
segment of B bits and then sub-divides the coded bits into 2N sub-segments of<br>
m bits. The integer m typically ranges from 2 to 6.<br>
In a typical OFDM transmission system, there are 2N +1 OFDM sub-<br>
carriers, including the zero frequency DC sub-carrier which is not generally used<br>
to transmit data since it has no frequency and therefore no phase. Accordingly,<br>
encoder 14 then typically performs 2m -ary quadrature amplitude modulation<br>
(QAM) encoding of the 2N sub-segments of m bits in order to map the sub-<br>
segments of m bits to predetermined corresponding complex-valued points in a<br>
2m -ary constellation. Each complex-valued point in the constellation represents<br>
discrete values of phase and amplitude. In this way, encoder 14 assigns to each<br>
of the 2N sub-segments of m bits a corresponding complex-valued 2m -ary QAM<br>
sub-symbol ck = ak +jbk, where -N £ k 
frequency-domain sub-symbols that encodes the B data bits. Also, the zero-<br>
frequency sub-carrier is typically assigned co =0. Encoder 14 then passes the<br>
sequence of sub-symbols, along with any additional zeroes that may be required<br>
for interpolation to simplify filtering, onto an inverse discrete Fourier transformer<br>
(IDFT) or, preferably, an inverse fast Fourier transformer (IFFT) 16.<br>
Upon receiving the sequence of OFDM frequency-domain sub-symbols<br>
from encoder 14, IFFT 16 performs an inverse fast Fourier transform on the<br>
sequence of sub-symbols. In other words, it uses each of the complex-valued<br>
sub-symbols, Ck, to modulate the phase and amplitude of a corresponding one of<br>
2N +1 sub-carrier frequencies over a symbol interval Ts. The sub-carriers are<br>
given by e-2πifkt, and therefore, have baseband frequencies of fk = k/Ts, where k<br>
is the frequency number and is an integer in the range -N ≤ k 
thereby produces a digital time-domain OFDM symbol of duration Ts given by:<br><br>
As a result of this discrete-valued modulation of the OFDM sub-carriers by<br>
frequency-domain sub-symbols over symbol intervals of Ts seconds, the OFDM<br>
sub-carriers each display a sine x = (sin x)/x spectrum in the frequency domain.<br>
By spacing each of the 2N +1 sub-carriers 1/Ts apart in the frequency domain,<br>
the primary peak of each sub-carrier's sine x spectrum coincides with a null of<br>
the spectrum of every other sub-carrier. In this way, although the spectra of the<br>
sub-carriers overlap, they remain orthogonal to one another. FIG. 2 illustrates the<br>
arrangement of the OFDM sub-carriers as well as the envelope of their modulated<br>
spectra within an OFDM channel bandwidth, BW, centered around a carrier<br>
frequency, fct. Note that the modulated sub-carriers fill the channel bandwidth<br>
very efficiently.<br>
Returning to FIG. 1, the digital time-domain OFDM symbols produced by<br>
IFFT 16 are then passed to a digital signal processor (DSP) 18. DSP 18 performs<br>
additional spectral shaping on the digital time-domain OFDM symbols and also<br>
adds a cyclic prefix or guard interval of length Tg to each symbol. The cyclic<br>
prefix is generally just a repetition of part of the symbol. This cyclic prefix is<br>
typically longer than the OFDM channel impulse response and, therefore, acts to<br>
prevent inter-symbol interference (ISI) between consecutive symbols.<br>
The real and imaginary-valued digital components that make up the<br>
cyclically extended, spectrally-shaped digital time-domain OFDM symbols are<br>
then passed to digital-to-analog converters (DACs) 20 and 22, respectively.<br>
DACs 20 and 22 convert the real and imaginary-valued digital components of the<br>
time-domain OFDM symbols into in-phase and quadrature OFDM analog signals,<br>
respectively, at a conversion or sampling rate fck_t as determined by a clock<br>
circuit 24. The in-phase and quadrature OFDM signals are then passed to mixers<br>
26 and 28, respectively.<br>
In mixers 26 and 28, the in-phase and quadrature OFDM signals from<br>
DACs 20 and 22 are used to modulate an in-phase intermediate frequency (IF)<br>
signal and a 90 degree phase-shifted (quadrature) IF signal, respectively, in order<br>
to produce an in-phase IF OFDM signal and a quadrature IF OFDM signal,<br>
respectively. The in-phase IF signal that is fed to mixer 26 is produced directly<br>
by a local oscillator 30, while the 90° phase-shifted IF signal that is fed to mixer<br>
28 is produced by passing the in-phase IF signal produced by local oscillator 30<br>
through a 90° phase-shifter 32 before feeding it to mixer 28. These two in-<br>
phase and quadrature IF OFDM signals are then combined in combiner 34 to<br>
form a composite IF OFDM signal. In some conventional transmitters, the IF<br>
mixing is performed in the digital domain using a digital synthesizer and digital<br>
mixers before the digital-to-analog conversion is performed.<br>
This composite IF OFDM signal is then passed into radio frequency (RF)<br>
transmitter 40. Many variations of RF transmitter 40 exist and are well known in<br>
the art, but typically, RF transmitter 40 includes an IF bandpass filter 42, an RF<br>
mixer 44, an RF carrier frequency local oscillator 46, an RF bandpass filter 48,<br>
an RF power amplifier 50, and an antenna 52. RF transmitter 40 takes the IF<br>
OFDM signal from combiner 34 and uses it to modulate a transmit carrier of<br>
frequency fct, generated by RF local oscillator 46, in order to produce an RF<br>
OFDM-modulated carrier that occupies a channel bandwidth, BW. Because the<br>
entire OFDM signal must fit within this channel bandwidth, the channel<br>
bandwidth must be at least (1/TS)(2N +1) Hz wide to accommodate all the<br>
modulated OFDM sub-carriers. The frequency-domain characteristics of this RF<br>
OFDM-modulated carrier are illustrated in FIG. 2. This RF OFDM-modulated<br>
carrier is then transmitted from antenna 52 through a channel, to an OFDM<br>
receiver in a remote location. In alternative embodiments of RF transmitter 40,<br>
the OFDM signal is used to modulate the transmit carrier using frequency<br>
modulation (FM), single-sideband modulation (SSB), or other modulation<br>
techniques. Therefore, the resulting RF OFDM-modulated carrier may not<br>
necessarily have the exact shape of the RF OFDM-modulated carrier illustrated in<br>
FIG. 2 (i.e., the RF OFDM-modulated carrier might not be centered around the<br>
transmit carrier, but instead may lie to either side of it}.<br>
In order to receive the OFDM signal and to recover the baseband data bits<br>
that have been encoded into the OFDM sub-carriers at a remote location, an<br>
OFDM receiver must perform essentially the inverse of all the operations<br>
performed by the OFDM transmitter described above. These operations can be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 3 which is a block diagram of a conventional<br>
OFDM receiver.<br>
The first element of a typical OFDM receiver 60 is an RF receiver 70. Like<br>
RF transmitter 40, many variations of RF receiver 70 exist and are well known in<br>
the art, but typically, RF receiver 70 includes an antenna 72, a low noise<br>
amplifier (LNA) 74, an RF bandpass filter 76, an automatic gain control (AGC)<br>
circuit 77, an RF mixer 78, an RF carrier frequency local oscillator 80, and an IF<br>
bandpass filter 82.<br>
Through antenna 72, RF receiver 70 couples in the RF OFDM-modulated<br>
carrier after it passes through the channel. Then, by mixing it with a receive<br>
carrier of frequency fcr generated by RF local oscillator 80, RF receiver 70<br>
downconverts the RF OFDM-modulated carrier to obtain a received IF OFDM<br>
signal. The frequency difference between the receive carrier and the transmit<br>
carrier contributes to the carrier frequency offset, delta fc.<br>
This received IF OFDM signal then feeds into both mixer 84 and mixer 86<br>
to be mixed with an in-phase IF signal and a 90° phase-shifted (quadrature) IF<br>
signal, respectively, to produce in-phase and quadrature OFDM signals,<br>
respectively. The in-phase IF signal that feeds into mixer 84 is produced by an IF<br>
local oscillator 88. The 90° phase-shifted IF signal that feeds into mixer 86 is<br>
derived from the in-phase IF signal of IF local oscillator 88 by passing the in-<br>
phase IF signal through a 90° phase shifter 90 before feeding it to mixer 86.<br>
The in-phase and quadrature OFDM signals then pass into analog-to-digital<br>
converters (ADCs) 92 and 93, respectively, where they are digitized at a<br>
sampling rate fck_r as determined by a clock circuit 94. ADCs 92 and 93 produce<br>
digital samples that form an in-phase and a quadrature discrete-time OFDM<br>
signal, respectively. The difference between the sampling rates of the receiver<br>
and that of the transmitter is the sampling rate offset, delta fck = fck_r -Frck-t.<br>
The unfiltered in-phase and quadrature discrete-time OFDM signals from<br>
ADCs 92 and 93 then pass through digital low-pass filters 96 and 98,<br>
respectively. The output of lowpass digital filters 96 and 98 are filtered in-phase<br>
and quadrature samples, respectively, of the received OFDM signal. In this way,<br>
the received OFDM signal is converted into in-phase (qi) and quadrature (pi)<br>
samples that represent the real and imaginary-valued components, respectively,<br>
of the complex-valued OFDM signal, n = qi +jpi. These in-phase and quadrature<br>
(real-valued and imaginary-valued) samples of the received OFDM signal are then<br>
delivered to DSP 100. Note that in some conventional implementations of<br>
receiver 60, the analog-to-digital conversion is done before the IF mixing<br>
process. In such an implementation, the mixing process involves the use of<br>
digital mixers and a digital frequency synthesizer. Also note that in many<br>
conventional implementations of receiver 60, the digital-to-analog conversion is<br>
performed after the filtering.<br>
DSP 100 performs a variety of operations on the in-phase and quadrature<br>
samples of the received OFDM signal. These operations may include: a)<br>
synchronizing receiver 60 to the timing of the symbols and data frames within<br>
the received OFDM signal, b) removing the cyclic prefixes from the received<br>
OFDM signal, c) computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) or preferably the<br>
fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the received OFDM signal in order to recover the<br>
sequences of frequency-domain sub-symbols that were used to modulate the<br>
sub-carriers during each OFDM symbol interval, d) performing any required<br>
channel equalization on the sub-carriers, and e) computing a sequence of<br>
frequency-domain sub-symbols, yk, from each symbol of the OFDM signal by<br>
demodulating the sub-carriers of the OFDM signal by means of the FFT<br>
calculation. DSP 100 then delivers these sequences of sub-symbols to a<br>
decoder 102.<br>
Decoder 102 recovers the transmitted data bits from the sequences of<br>
frequency-domain sub-symbols that are delivered to it from DSP 100. This<br>
recovery is performed by decoding the frequency-domain sub-symbols to obtain<br>
a stream of data bits 104 which should ideally match the stream of data bits 12<br>
that were fed into the OFDM transmitter 10 This decoding process can include<br>
soft Viterbi decoding and/or Reed-Solomon decoding, for example, to recover the<br>
data from the block and/or convolutionally encoded sub-symbols.<br>
In a typical OFDM data transmission system such as one for implementing<br>
digital television or a wireless local area network (WLAN), data is transmitted in<br>
the OFDM signal in groups of symbols known as data frames. This concept is<br>
shown in FIG. 4 where a data frame 100 includes M consecutive symbols 112a,<br>
112b, . . . , 112M, each of which includes a guard interval, Tg, as well as the<br>
OFDM symbol interval, Ts. Therefore, each symbol has a total duration of Tg<br>
+ Ts seconds. Depending on the application, data frames can be transmitted<br>
continuously, such as in the broadcast of digital TV, or data frames can be<br>
transmitted at random times in bursts, such as in the implementation of a<br>
WLAN.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 5-8, an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention is shown. Although the present invention is illustrated as being<br>
distinct from the elements of OFDM receiver of FIG. 3, one skilled in the art will<br>
readily devise that the present invention may be integrated with the elements of<br>
the OFDM receiver. For example, the present invention may be combined with<br>
ADCs 92 and 93 and clock circuit 94 of OFDM receiver 60. However, the<br>
present invention is illustrated as a distinct sampling frequency correction loop<br>
for clarity, ease of reference, and to facilitate an understanding of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention is described as operating in a receiver that conforms<br>
to the ETSI-BRAN HIPERLAN/2 (Europe) and IEEE 802.11a (USA) wireless LAN<br>
standards. However, it is considered within the skill of one skilled in the art to<br>
implement the teachings of the present invention in other OFDM systems.<br>
The above-identified wireless LAN standards propose the use of a training<br>
sequence for detection of OFDM transmissions. Briefly, the training sequence<br>
(e.g., training sequence A or B) includes a series of short OFDM training symbols<br>
(having known amplitudes and phases) that are transmitted over a pre-<br>
determined number of pilot sub-carriers or bins (e.g., 12 pilot sub-carriers). All<br>
the other sub-carriers (e.g., 52 sub-carriers) remain at zero during the<br>
transmission of the training sequence. Although use of the training sequence of<br>
the above-identified LAN standards is discussed below, use of alternative training<br>
sequences and symbols is considered within the scope of the invention as<br>
defined by the appended claims.<br>
More specifically, the HIPERLAN/2 short training sequence B consists of<br>
12 non-zero pilot subcarriers and all the other carriers are zero (total of 64<br>
subcarriers). If a sampling frequency offset is present when the time-domain<br>
OFDM signal is sampled, the result in the frequency-domain will be a spectrum<br>
that is scaled along the frequency axis. Such a scaling will mean that the 12<br>
non-zero pilot subcarriers will no longer be on frequencies that are a multiple of<br>
the fundamental frequency. Thus, DFT leakage will occur. The result is that,<br>
instead of having a single peak in the FFT output that corresponds to a pilot<br>
subcarrier, there is a peak with sidelobes (samples on either side of the main<br>
peak), as shown in FIG. 5. By calculating the difference of the sample to the left<br>
of the peak and the sample to the right of the peak, a meaningful error can be<br>
generated that can be used to successfully update the frequency of the sampler<br>
and thus remove the sampling frequency offset.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6, a sampling frequency correction network 120 is<br>
shown. It should be noted the network 120 may be embodied in software,<br>
hardware, or some combination thereof. Network 120 receives a sampled signal<br>
from a sampler 122 having analog to digital converters (e.g., ADCs 92 and 93 in<br>
FIG. 3) driven by a variable clock circuit (e.g., clock circuit 94 in FIG. 3). As<br>
discussed above, sampler 122 may be sampling the received signal at a<br>
frequency that is different than the sample rate of the transmitter. This<br>
difference in sample rate generates a sampling frequency offset that can be<br>
detrimental to the performance of the receiver. Network 120 corrects the<br>
frequency offset so the receiver is properly synchronized.<br>
Network 120 includes a time-domain windowing module 124 that<br>
multiplies the sampled time domain data, received from sampler 122, by a<br>
window function such as a Hamming window, Hanning window, or the like.<br>
Applying the window function to the sampled data produces two benefits. First,<br>
when the sampled data is analyzed in the frequency domain/ i.e. when the<br>
sampled data is processed by FFT module 126 and analyzed by error<br>
computation module 128, the main lobe of each pilot bin will be widened or<br>
spread. Widening the main lobe will increase the number of frequency-domain<br>
samples for each pilot bin, as discussed in further detail below. Second, the<br>
sidelobes of the pilot bins are lowered and, as a result, cause less interference<br>
with neighboring pilot bins.<br>
Time domain windowing module 124 passes the sampled time domain<br>
data to FFT module 126 which converts the time-domain samples into the<br>
frequency domain. As discussed above, application of the windowing function<br>
in the time domain increases the number of frequency samples for the main lobe<br>
of each pilot bin. For example, FIG. 7 shows two pilot bins having three<br>
frequency-domain samples, i.e. each pilot bin has a main peak and a smaller peak<br>
on either side of the main peak. If the windowing function was not applied in<br>
the time domain there would likely be only one frequency-domain sample per<br>
pilot bin. In other words, only the main peaks would be present in the frequency<br>
domain if the windowing function was not applied in the time domain. As<br>
discussed in further detail below, the additional frequency-domain samples are<br>
needed to generate a frequency offset error.<br>
FFT module 126 passes the frequency-domain samples to an error<br>
computation module 128. Error computation module 128 compares the received<br>
samples to a stored table 130 of pilot bin indices of a known training sequence<br>
to detect the occurrence of main peak frequency-domain samples of the training<br>
sequence. When the main peak frequency-domain samples of the training<br>
sequence are detected, error computation module 128 analyzes the frequency<br>
bins that neighbor each pilot bin of the training sequence to determine if a<br>
sampling frequency offset exists. When there is no sampling frequency offset<br>
the frequency bins to the left and right of a pilot bin will have the same<br>
magnitude, as shown in FIG. 7. However, if there is a sampling frequency offset<br>
the frequency bins to the left and right of a pilot bin will have different<br>
magnitudes, as shown in FIG. 8.<br>
Upon detection of a sampling frequency offset error, computation module<br>
128 computes an error value for each pilot bin by calculating the difference in<br>
magnitude between the frequency bins on either side of each pilot bin. The<br>
difference in magnitude may be positive or negative, as shown in FIG. 5, and the<br>
sign of the difference needs to be maintained since this contains information<br>
about whether the receiver's sampling frequency is too fast or too slow. For a<br>
given sampling frequency offset, the magnitude of the sample to the left of a<br>
main peak (denote the magnitude of this sample as LEFT) minus the value of the<br>
' sample to the right of the mam peak (denote the magnitude of this sample as<br>
RIGHT) will produce a value with a given sign for the first half of the FFT output<br>
spectrum, and the sign of that difference will be reversed for the second half of<br>
the FFT output spectrum. In order for the error term to have the same sign for<br>
the entire spectrum, the error for the first half 136 of the spectrum (i.e., the<br>
positive frequency bins from the FFT) must be defined as the opposite of that for<br>
the second half 138. That is, the error for the first half can be defined as LEFT<br>
- RIGHT, whereas the error for the second half (i.e., the negative frequency bins<br>
from the FFT) can be defined as RIGHT-LEFT. The opposite definition can<br>
alternatively be used as well (RIGHT - LEFT for the first half, and LEFT-RIGHT<br>
for the second half).<br>
Returning to FIG. 6, error computation module 128 outputs the computed<br>
error values for the pilot bins to a mean error module 132. Mean error module<br>
132 calculates a mean error value by taking the mean of the computed error<br>
values. Afterwards, mean error module 132 outputs the mean error value to a<br>
gain module 134 that multiplies the mean error value by a gain factor to generate<br>
a scaled error signal that is fed back to sampler 122 to adjust the sampling<br>
frequency. The value of the gain controls the convergence speed of the<br>
sampling frequency of the OFDM receiver. Thus gain module 134 serves as a<br>
first order loop filter.<br>
Thus according to the principle of the present invention, there is provided<br>
a method of correcting a sampling frequency offset in an OFDM receiver. The<br>
method includes receiving an OFDM signal containing a training symbol on an<br>
OFDM pilot subcarrier, sampling the received OFDM signal at a sampling<br>
frequency, applying a time-domain window to the sampled OFDM signal such<br>
that a main lobe of the OFDM pilot subcarrier is widened, taking a Fast Fourier<br>
Transform (FFT) of the windowed OFDM signals such that there are a plurality of<br>
frequency-domain samples of the OFDM pilot subcarrier, and generating an error<br>
proportional to the sampling frequency offset by analyzing the plurality of<br>
frequency-domain samples of the OFDM pilot subcarrier.<br>
According to a feature of the present invention, there is provided an<br>
OFDM receiver for receiving an OFDM signal having a training symbol on a pilot<br>
subcarrier. The OFDM receiver includes an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that<br>
samples a received analog OFDM signal at a sampling frequency to generate<br>
digital OFDM samples, a window module that applies a window function to the<br>
digital samples output by the ADC, the window function widening a main lobe of<br>
the pilot subcarrier, an FFT that Fast Fourier Transforms the windowed samples<br>
output by the window module such that a plurality of frequency samples exist<br>
for the pilot subcarrier, and an error computation module that computes a<br>
sampling frequency error by analyzing the plurality of frequency samples of the<br>
pilot subcarrier.<br>
