BACKGROUND<br>
ischemia heart disease results from myocardial<br>
ischemia developed by a serious deficiency of oxygen<br>
supply caused by interruption of blood flow to heart by<br>
a reason like arteriosclerosis (G. J. Grover, Can. J.<br>
Physiol. 75, 309, 1997; G. D. Lopaschuk fit al.<br>
&amp; Medicine 42, 1997) . Myocardial ischemia induces<br>
pathological changes in cells progressively, leading to<br>
irreversible myocardial damage and even necrosis of<br>
cells and tissues, at last. In early stage when damage<br>
is reversible, irreversible damage might be prevented<br>
by reperfusion through surgical operations such c.s PTCA<br>
(percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplast;<br>
cience<br>
CABG (coronary artery bypass graft) or<br>
thrombolytics, but the restoration of f 1 DW by<br>
reperfusion therapy is accompanied by a ::urther<br>
injurious phenomenon called reperfusion injury (D. J.<br>
Hearse, Medicographia 18, 22, 1996) . It is difficult<br>
to clearly separate ischemic injury from that mediated<br>
by reperfusion. Reperfusion injury is caused by sudden<br>
restoration of blood flow by reperfusion t'lerapy,<br>
mainly due to reactive oxygen free radicals and -alcium<br>
overload. Reperfusion injury includes a range of<br>
) and<br>
using<br>
events, such as arrhythmia, vascular damage, myocarcial<br>
dysfunction and serious neurocognitive dysfunction.<br>
In order to delay damage by ischemia and minimize<br>
reperfusion injury, studies have actively been<br>
undergoing on pharmacotherapy using immune modulators,<br>
agents to suppress apoptosis, ion channel modulators,<br>
etc, artificial blood products to enhance the oxygen<br>
carrying potential of blood, and development of devices<br>
and operation procedures, but neither of them has oeen<br>
in commercial use, so far. As an ion cha<br>
modulators, an inhibitor of Na-H exchanger (NHE)<br>
adenosine Ai/A2 antagonist and a KATP opener (ATPsensitive<br>
potassium channel opener) draw our attention.<br>
According to earlier reports, diazoxide, a<br>
mel<br>
an<br>
KATp<br>
opener, can reduce damage due to oxidative stress by<br>
suppressing the generation of oxygen free radicals in<br>
mitochondria by inducing oxidation of flavoprotein (A.<br>
A. Starkov, Biosci, Rep. 17, 273, 1997; V. P. Skulachev,<br>
Q. Rev. Biophus. 29, 169, 1996), and the opening of<br>

the decrease of release of excitatory amino acids<br>
Moreau, G. Huber, Brain Res., 31, 65, 1999).<br>
general KATP openers have not only cardioprotective<br>
activity but also vasorelaxant activity, meaning that<br>
^•ATP<br>

The<br>
the relaxation of coronary and peripheral blood vessels<br>
drops blood pressure, so that blood flow to damaged<br>
tissues decreases, which is negative factor for<br>
cardioprotection. That is, vasorelaxation is a kind of<br>
side effect of those openers for heart protection.<br>
KATP, which was first found in myocardium, is<br>
distributed in variety of organs and tissues such as<br>
(3 -cells of pancreas, smooth muscles, kidney and<br>
central nervous system, etc., so that it has been a<br>
major target for the development of a novel d::ug but,<br>
at the same time, it is hard to develop<br>
medicine working selectively toward a specific<br>
tissue. According to Atwal et al, the cardiopr<br>
activity and vasorelaxant activity of K.•ATP<br>

provides a new chance for the development of<br>

(Figure Removed)<br>
Thus, the inventors of the present invention<br>
synthesized benzopyran derivatives substituted with<br>
benzimidazole derivatives, in which the guanidinyl<br>
group substituted in the 4-position of benzopyran was<br>
cyclized to a benzene ring to form a benzimidazole ring.<br>
And the present inventors completed this invention by<br>
confirming that the compound of the invention had an<br>
excellent cardioprotective effect against the damage<br>
I<br>
caused by ischemia-reperfusion, so that it can be<br>
effectively used as a protective agent or therc.peutic<br>
agent for ischemia-reperfusion related diseases.<br>
Precisely, the compound can be used for the treatment<br>
of ischemic heart diseases such as myocardial<br>
infarction, unstable angina pectoris, etc. and for the<br>
protection of heart upon thrombolytic therapy or<br>
reperfusion therapy such as PTCA (percutaneous<br>
transluminal coronary angioplasty) and CABG (coronary<br>
artery bypass graft), and for the protection of<br>
ischemia-reperfusion related tissues such as nerve<br>
cells, brain, retinal cells, storage organs, etc.<br>

The present invention further provides<br>
pharmaceutical composition for cardioprotection<br>
containing benzopyran derivatives substituted with a<br>
benzimidazole derivative, represented in <formula>,<br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as an<br>
effective ingredient.<br>
When tested in ischemic heart models of<br>
Langendorff using isolated rat hearts, compounds of the<br>
present invention significantly prolong the time to<br>
contracture (TTC) , an index of heart protection, and<br>
improve recovery of the cardiac function (left<br>
ventricular developed pressure x heart rate, LVDP x HR)<br>
after reperfusion, but reduce release of lactate<br>
dehydrogenase (LDH), an index for cell damage, which<br>
are similar or superior to cardioprotecting activity of<br>
BMS-180448, a control. In ischemic myocardium models<br>
using anesthetized rat, compounds of the present<br>
invention also show similar antiischemic activity to<br>
BMS-180448. In the tests with blood vessels isolated<br>
from a white rat, the compounds of the present<br>
invention shows better cardioselective antiischemic<br>
activity than BMS-180448 owing to their minor<br>
vasorelaxant activity.<br>
In conclusion, the compounds of the present<br>
invention do not drop blood pressure owing to their<br>
minor vasorelaxant activity but have excellent<br>
antiischemic activity. Therefore, the compounds of the<br>
invention can be effectively used not only for the<br>
protection of heart but also for the prevention or the<br>
treatment of ischemic heart diseases such as myocardial<br>
infarction and unstable angina pectoris and ischemiareperfusion<br>
related diseases caused by thrombolytics or<br>
reperfusxon therapy like PTCA (percutaneous<br>
transluminal coronary angioplasty) and CABG (coronary<br>
artery bypass graft), decrease of myocardial<br>
contractility, myocardial injury, change of energy<br>
metabolism and decline of cognitive capability. In<br>
addition, the compounds of the present invention can be<br>
used as a protective agent against brain injury, a<br>
protective agent for retinal cells or organs for longterm<br>
storage such as heart, kidney, liver and tissues,<br>
or a treating agent for isr.hemia-reperfu'sion related<br>
diseases.<br>

The following experiments were performed to<br>
investigate pharmacological activities of compounds of<br>
the present invention represented in <formula>.<br>
Experiment I: Vasodilating effect on blood vessel<br>
isolated from white rats<br>
In order to investigate vasorelaxation effect of<br>
compounds represented in <formula> on blood vessel,<br>
following experiments were performed.<br>
White rats (350 ~ 450 g; the Experimental Animal<br>
Team of the Korea Research Institute of Chemical<br>
Technology) were knocked to be unconscious by hitting<br>
the occipital region, sacrificed by cervical<br>
dislocation, and underwent thoracotomy. After being<br>
quickly removed, the thoracic aorta was deprived of the<br>
adipose tissue and cut into aortic rings of 3 nun width.<br>
The aorta was lightly rubbed with cotton club soaked in<br>
a modified Krebs Henseleit buffer (physiological salt<br>
solution) to remove the inner epithelial layer<br>
therefrom. While being hung in an organ bath<br>
containing a physiological buffer, the vascular smooth<br>
muscle was allowed to equilibrate under a resting<br>
tension of 2 g and then, stand 'for 1 hour at 37°C for<br>
stabilization, supplying a carbogen consisting of 95%<br>
02 I 5% COo. Thereafter, the vascular smooth muscle was<br>
constricted with 1CT5 M phenylephrine and washed several<br>
times with physiological saline solution. The said<br>
procedure was repeated to ensure the stable reactivity<br>
of vascular smooth muscle to repetitive<br>
constriction/relaxation.<br>
Thereafter, 3 x 1CT6 M methoxamine was applied to<br>
induce an intensive constriction in the vascular smooth<br>
muscle. When the vasoconstriction induced by the<br>
methoxamine was reached and maintained to a maximum,<br>
test compounds and control material were cumulatively<br>
added to the organ bath with concentration of 1, 3, 10<br>
and 30 M M, respectively, to examine the vasodilating<br>
effect. Cromakalim and BMS-180448 (compound of<br><formula>) , known to be the first generation KATP<br>
opener with potent vasodilating effect, were used as<br>
control materials.<br>
The change rate of constriction by the addition<br>
of the drugs compared to the maximal constriction<br>
induced by methoxamine was calculated to plot a<br>
concentration-relaxation response curve. Through a<br>
least linear regression analysis, IC50 that the drug<br>
concentration at which the vascular tissue is relaxed<br>
to 50% extent of the maximal constriction, was obtained<br>
for each drug. And the results were shown in the below<br>
Table 1.<br><table>
<br>
Vasodilating effect of the compounds of <formula><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
As shown in rhe above Table I, Cromakalim<br>
represented a potent vasorelaxation effect, showing<br>
0.067 nM of IC50 on the isolated rat aorta constricted<br>
with methoxamine (3 nM) while IC50 of BMS-180448 was<br>
1.38 nM, which was twenty times weaker vasorelaxation<br>
effects than that of Cromakalim. On the other hand,<br>
IC50 of the compound of example 1 was 50.1 jiM, showing<br>
36 times weaker vasorelaxation effect than that of BMS-<br>
180448, a general KATP opener, used as a control<br>
material. The compound of example 20 also showed 10<br>
times weaker vasorelaxation effect than that of BMS-<br>
180448.<br>
Cromakalim or BMS-180448 protects heart by acting<br>
toward KATP in heart and drops blood pressure by<br>
dilating blood vessels by acting toward KATP in coronary<br>
and peripheral blood vessels. Hypotensive action may<br>
mask any cardioprotective effects due to reduction<br>
under coronary artery perfusion pressure, and would<br>
limit utility in treating myocardial ischemia.<br>
Therefore, the compounds of the present invention may<br>
be more optimal for cardioprotective agents by virtue<br>
of their weak vasorelaxation activity.<br>
Again, the compounds of the present invention<br>
have enhanced cardioprotectjve function with weak<br>
Experiment 2: Cardioprotective effect on isolated<br>
ischemic heart models of white rats<br>
The experiment confirming that the compounds of<br><formula l> have the protective effect (antiischemic<br>
effect) on ischemic heart was accomplished in the below.<br>
100 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital was injected in<br>
abdominal cavity of white male rats (300 ~ 450 g; the<br>
experimental animal team of the Korea Research<br>
Institute of Chemical Technology) to anesthetize them.<br>
Then, an intravenous injection of 1000 U/kg of heparin<br>
was performed before taking out heart. Particularly,<br>
cannula(PE 240) was inserted in the trachea, and<br>
artificial respiration was tried upon the rat by using<br>
a rodent ventilator. Under that condition, aortic<br>
cannula was inserted in the aorta and heart was taken<br>
out under retrograde perfusion. The extracted heart<br>
was hung on Langendorff apparatus quickly and<br>
unnecessary tissues on heart were removed. Perfusion<br>
was induced under static pressure (85 mmHg) with 37°C<br>
modified Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer<br>
(composition <mm>: 116 NaCl, 4.7 KC1, 1.1 MgS04, 1.17<br>
KH2P04, 24.9 NaHC03, 2.52 CaCl2, 8.32 Glucose, 2.0<br>
Pyruvate) saturated with 95% O2/5% C02. A metal cannula,<br>
to which a latex balloon filled with a ethanoldistilled<br>
water mixture (1:1 vol/vol) was linked, was<br>
inserted in left ventricle through pulmonary vein.<br>
Then, left ventricular pressure transmitted through the<br>
balloon was transduced by using pressure transducer,<br>
and amplified by using isovolumetric amplifier(Plugsys<br>
bridge amplifier). Then, the pressure was recorded in<br>
a recorder (Linearcorder mark 8 WR 3500). Thereafter,<br>
heart was stabilized for 15 minutes. Then, left<br>
ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was given by<br>
5 mmHg and such volume of the balloon was kept<br>
throughout the experiments.<br>
Baseline cardiac contractile function, heart rate<br>
(HR) , and coronary flow (CF) were measured. Cardiac<br>
contractile function was calculated by subtracting LVSP<br>
(left ventricular peak systolic pressure) from LVEDP<br>
(left ventricular end diastolic pressure), yielding<br>
LVDP (left ventricular developed pressure). Double<br>
product RPP (rate-pressure product)(DP), another<br>
important parameter for indirectly assessing cardiac<br>
performance in Langendorff heart, in which cardiac<br>
output could not be measured ordinarily, was calculated<br>
by multiplying HR by LVDP. Throughout the experiment,<br>
total coronary blood flow was measured by the use of<br>
coronary flow probe (diameter: 1.0 mm) installed in<br>
aortic cannula with electromagnetic flowmeter.<br>
Temperature of heart was steadily maintained by<br>
immersing the heart at 37°C in physiological saline<br>
solution to which 95% 02/5% CO2 was constantly supplied.<br>
After stabilization for 15 min, the hearts were pretreated<br>
for 10 min with vehicle (0.04% DMSO) only or a<br>
compound of the present invention or the control<br>
material in the vehicle. Thereafter, cardiac<br>
contractile function, HR and CF were repeatedly<br>
measured. Global ischemia was induced by completely<br>
shutting off the perfusate for 30 min. Severity of<br>
ischemia was determined as the time to contracture (TTC,<br>
min) during global ischemia in which the first 5 mmHg<br>
increase in EDP was observed. Then, the hearts were<br>
reperfused and, 30 min later, contractile functions<br>
(LVDP, HR and CF) were repeatedly measured. After<br>
reperfusion was accomplished for 30 min, LDH (lactate<br>
dehydrogenase) was measured with a kit as a sensitive<br>
index for loss of cell viability. The results were<br>
shown in Table 2.<br><table>
<br>
Cardioprotective effect in ischemic heart models of<br>
Rats<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
In vehicle-treated group, reperfusion DP (LVDP X<br>
HR) , an index for contractility function, was decreased<br>
to 15.8% of pre-treatment DP, and EDP was increased to<br>
45.1 mmHg from 5 mmHg, and TTC was 19.8 min, and<br>
reperfusion LDH release was 31.3 unit/g as shown in the<br>
above.<br>
In BMS-180448 treated group, reperfusion<br>
contractile function (DP, LVDP x HR) was 67.6% of pretreatment<br>
DP, which was significantly improved compared<br>
to the vehicle treated group. EDP was 16.5 mmHg,<br>
significantly lower than control, and TTC was 27.8 min,<br>
prolonged than control, and reperfusion LDH release was<br>
17.2 Unit/g, decreased than control. Then, in BMS-<br>
180448 treated group, all parameters showed significant<br>
protective effect on ischemic heart.<br>
When compared only in antiischemic effects based<br>
on those parameters, cardiac contractile function, EDP,<br>
TTC, and LDH release, the compounds of the present<br>
invention were similar to or superior to BMS-180448.<br>
However, because the compounds of the present invention<br>
have remarkably lower vasorelaxant effects than BMS-<br>
180448 dose, they are far superior to the conventional<br>
drugs in cardioselective antiischemic activity.<br>
Especially, the compound of Example 1 showed a .good<br>
cardioprotective effect, of which contractile function<br>
(LVDP x HR) was improved to 68.8% of pre-treatment<br>
index, and EDP was 20.3 mmHg, and TTC was 23.2 min, and<br>
reperfusion LDH release was 8.1 unit/g, with very low<br>
vasodilation activity (IC50 = 50.1 p M) . So, it shows<br>
much better cardioselectivity upon vasodilation than<br>
BMS-180448. Consequently, the compounds of the present<br>
invention can be used for the treatment of ischemic<br>
heart diseases by virtue of their excellent selectivity<br>
and protective activity against ischemic cardiovascular<br>
diseases. Besides, the compounds can also be used as a<br>
protective agent for ischemic brain and retinal cell<br>
damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion or for storage<br>
organs,<br>
Experimental 3: Acute oral toxicity test in rats<br>
The following experiments were performed to see<br>
if the compounds of <formula> had acute toxicity in<br>
rats .<br>
6-week old SPF SD line rats were used in the<br>
tests for acute toxicity test. The compounds prepared<br>
in the Example 1 were suspended in 0.5% methylcelLulose<br>
solution and orally administered once to 2 rats per<br>
group with the dosage of 1 g/kg/15 M. Death, clinical<br>
symptoms, and weight change in rats were observed,<br>
hematological tests and biochemical tests of blood were<br>
performed, and any abnormal signs in the<br>
gastrointestinal organs of chest and abdomen were<br>
checked with eyes during autopsy.<br>
The results showed that the test compounds did<br>
not cause any specific clinical symptoms, weight change,<br>
or death in rats. No change was observed in<br>
hematological tests, biochemical tests of blood, and<br>
autopsy. The compounds used in this experimert were<br>
evaluated to be safe substances since they did not<br>
cause any toxic change in rats up to the level of 2<br>
g/kg and their estimated LD50 values were much jreater<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As explained hereinbefore, the compounds of<br>
present invention represented in <formula> have<br>
excellent cardioprotective effect against damage by<br>
ischemia-reperfusion without lowering blood pressure<br>
owing to their weak vasorelaxation activity. Thus, a<br>
pharmaceutical composition containing benzopyran<br>
derivatives substituted with a benzimidazole derivative,<br>
represented in <formula>, or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of the same can be used as a<br>
protective or therapeutic agent for ischemiareperfusion<br>
related damage or diseases, that is, the<br>
compounds are not only useful for the treatment of<br>
ischemic heart diseases such as myocardial infarction,<br>
unstable angina pec'toris, etc, the protection of heart<br>
from the damage caused by thrombolytics or reperfusion<br>
therapy such as PTCA (percutaneous transluminal<br>
coronary angioplasty) and CABG (coronary artery bypass<br>
graft), and the protection of ischemia-reperfusion<br>
related tissues such as nerve cells, brain, retinal<br>
cells, storage organs, etc.<br>
