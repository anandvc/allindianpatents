				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ENANTIOMERICALLY ENRICHED<br>
ESTERS AND ALCOHOLS<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of an enantiomerically enriched ester, in which a mixture of the enantiomers of the corresponding secondary alcohol is subjected to an enantioselective conversion in the presence of a racemisation catalyst with the aid of an acyl donor upon which the ester is formed and an acyl donor residue is obtained.<br>
Such a process is known for example from Backvall, J.A. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 1645-1650, in which esters of halogenated phenols are used as acyl donor.<br>
A disadvantage of the known method is that the reaction is carried out at a low concentration. Furthermore the quantity of catalyst that is used is relatively high, and this holds for both the acylation catalyst and the racemisation catalyst. In addition the reaction rate is relatively low. Another disadvantage is that use is made of an acyl donor that is environmentally unfriendly.<br>
The invention now provides a process by which enantiomerically enriched esters can be obtained with a higher yield and a higher production capacity, and in which less acylation and/or racemisation catalyst needs to be used. Furthermore in the proces according to the invention use can be made of readily available and inexpensive acyl donors of which the acyl donor residue is not an environmentally unfriendly byproduct.<br>
According to the invention this is achieved in a process wherein the acyl donor residue is irreversibly removed from the phase in which the enantioselective conversion occurs.<br>
The process according to the invention can be carried out in the presence of a ketone.<br>
It has been found that, in contrast to the findings published in Backvall, J.A. Chem. Soc. 1999,121, 1645-1650, the presence of a ketone can have a significant effect on the production capacity, the yield and the reaction rate of the method according to the invention.<br>
The ketone can be chosen in such a way that it corresponds to the alcohol that is used as substrate, or it can be another ketone that is preferably chosen in such a way that it is not also removed from the reaction mixture by the<br><br>
same irreversible method of removal used to remove the acyl donor residue, and that its corresponding alcohol is not acylated by the enzyme. One skilled in the art can simply establish by experimental means which ketones are the most suitable for use in his specific reaction system.<br>
The acyl donor residue is preferably removed from the reaction mixture on a continuous basis, for example by preferentially transferring the acyl donor residue to another phase relative to the acyl donor and the other reaction components. This can be achieved by physical and by chemical methods, or by a combination thereof. Examples of physical methods by which the acyl donor residue can irreversibly be removed from the phase in which the enzymatic reaction occurs, are selective crystallisation, extraction, complexing to an insoluble complex, absorption or adsorption; or by such a choice of the acyl donor that the acyl donor residue is sufficiently volatile relative to the reaction mixture, or is converted in situ into another compound that is sufficiently volatile relative to the reaction mixture to remove the acyl donor residue irreversibly from the reaction mixture; examples of the latter are the application of isopropyl acetate as acyl donor resulting in volatile isopropyl alcohol as acyl donor residue, and the application of isopropenyl acetate as acyl donor, resulting, via isopropenyl alcohol, in volatile acetone as acyl donor residue. In order to remove the acyl donor residue use can be made of a reduced pressure, depending on the boiling point of the reaction mixture. The pressure (at a given temperature) is preferably chosen in such a way that the mixture refluxes or is close to refluxing. In addition it is known to one skilled in the art that the boiling point of a mixture can be lowered by making an azeotropic composition of the mixture. Examples of chemical methods of removal are covalent bonding or chemical or enzymatic derivatization.<br>
Activated forms of carboxylic acids, for example esters or amides or anhydrides, can be used as acyl donor. Examples of suitable acyl donors are esters of C1-C20 carboxylic acids, preferably isopropyl acetate, isopropenyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, vinyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isopropyl laureate, isopropenyl laureate or other readily available esters of carboxylic acids and CrC7 alcohols. Preferably an acyldonor is chosen such that the acyldonor itself is (relatively) not volatile under the reaction conditions while its acyl donor residue is volatile, and oxidation of the substrate is prevented as much as possible under the reaction conditions. Examples of such acyldonors are carboxylic acid esters of an alcohol with 1-4C-atoms and a carboxylic acid with 4-20C-atoms, for instance isopropyl butyric acid ester.<br><br>
The concentration at which the reaction is carried out is not particularly critical. The reaction can be carried out without a solvent. For practical reasons, for instance when solid or higly viscous reactants or reaction products are involved , a solvent may be used. The reaction can suitably be carried out at higher concentrations, for example at a substrate concentration higher than 0.4 M, in particular higher than 0.8 M. Preferably the substrate (eventually substrate mixture) concentration is higher than 1M, for instance higher than 2M.<br>
The enantioselective conversion of the secondary alcohol in the ester can be carried out with the known asymmetrical acylation catalysts, for example as described in Christine E Garrett et al., J.A.Chem. Soc. 120,(1998) 7479-7483 and references cited therein, and Gregory C. Fu in Chemical innovation/January 2000,3-5. Preferably the enantioselective conversion of the secondary alcohol in the ester is carried out enzymatically.<br>
Suitable enzymes that can be used in the method according to<br>
the invention are for example the known enzymes with hydrolytic activity and a<br>
high enantioselectivity in such reactions that are also active in an organic<br>
environment, for example enzymes with lipase or esterase activity or, when an<br>
amide is used as acyl donor, enzymes with amidase activity and esterase or<br>
lipase activity, for example originating from Pseudomonas, in particular<br>
Pseudomonas fluoresceins, Pseudomonas tragi; Burkholderia, for example<br>
Burkholderia cepacia; Chromobacterium, in particular Chromobacterium<br>
viscosum; Bacillus, in particular Bacillus thermocatenulatus, Bacillus licheniformis;<br>
Alcaligenes, in particular Alcaligenes faecalis; Aspergillus, in particular Aspergillus<br>
niger, Candida, in particular Candida antarctica, Candida rugosa, Candida<br>
lipolytica, Candida cylindracea; Geotrichum, in particular Geotrichum candidum;<br>
Humicola, in particular Humicola lanuginosa; Penicillium, in particular Penicillium<br>
cyclopium, Penicillium roquefortii, Penicillium camembertii; Rhizomucor, in<br>
particular Rhizomucorjavanicus, Rhizomucor miehei; Mucor, in particular Mucor<br>
javanicus; Rhizopus, in particular Rhizopus oryzae, Rhizopus arrhizus, Rhizopus<br>
delemar, Rhizopus niveus, Rhizopus japonicus, Rhizopus javanicus; Porcine<br>
pancreas lipase, Wheat germ lipase, Bovine pancreas lipase, Pig liver esterase.	v<br>
Preferably an enzyme originating from Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas sp., Burkholderia cepacia, Porcine pancreas, Rhizomucor miehei, Humicola lanuginosa, Candida rugosa or Candida antarctica or subtilisin is used. If an R-selective enzyme is used, for example from Candida antarctica, the R-ester is obtained as product. Naturally an S-selective enzyme will lead to the S-ester.<br><br>
Such enzymes can be obtained via generally known technologies. Many enzymes are produced on a technical scale and are commercially available. The enzyme preparation as used in the present invention is not limited by purity etc. and can be both a crude enzyme solution and a purified enzyme, but it can also consist of (permeabilised and/or immobilised) cells that have the desired activity, or of a homogenate of cells with such an activity. The enzyme can also be used in an immobilised form or in a chemically modified form. The invention is in no way limited by the form in which the enzyme is used for the present invention. Within the framework of the invention it is of course also possible to use an enzyme originating from a genetically modified microorganism.<br>
Examples of suitable racemisation catalysts are redox catalysts as occurring in transfer hydrogenations. The racemisation catalyst and the acylation catalyst are preferably chosen so that they are mutually compatible, which means that they do not or minimally deactivate each other. The expert can establish by experimental means what acylation/ racemisation catalyst combination is suitable for his specific system. The acylation catalyst and/or the racemisation can be used in heterogenised form.<br>
Examples of racemisation catalysts to be chosen are catalysts on the basis of a transition metal compound. Transition metal compounds are described for example in Comprehensive Organometallic Chemistry'The synthesis, Reactions and Structures of Organometallic Compounds' Volumes 1 - 9, Editor: Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson, FRS, deputy editor: F. Gordon A. Stone, FRS, Executive editor Edward W. Abel, preferably volumes 4, 5, 6 and 8 and in Comprehensive Organometallic Chemistry 'A review of the literature 1982 - 1994', Editor-in-chief: Edward W. Abel, Geoffrey Wilkinson, F. Gordon A. Stone, preferably volume 4 (Scandium, Yttrium, Lanthanides and Actinides, and Titanium Group), volume 7 (Iron, Ruthenium, and Osmium), volume 8 (Cobalt, Rhodium, and Iridium), volume 9 (Nickel, Palladium, and Platinum), volume 11 (Main-group Metal Organometallics in Organic Synthesis) and volume 12 (Transition Metal Organometallics in Organic Synthesis).<br>
As transition metal compound use is preferably made of a transition metal compound of the general formula:<br><br><br>
n is 1,2,3,4....;<br>
p, q and r each independently represent 0,1,2,3,4...;<br>
M is a transition metal, for example a metal of group 7,8,9 or 10 of the periodic<br>
system according to the new IUPAC version as shown in the table printed in the<br>
cover of the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 70th edition, CRC press,<br>
1989-1990, or a lanthanide or a mixture thereof, in particular iron, cobalt, nickel,<br>
rhenium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, palladium, platinum or samarium,<br>
or a mixture thereof. In the racemisation use is preferably made of palladium,<br>
ruthenium, iridium or rhodium, most preferably ruthenium or iridium;<br>
X is an anion such as e.g. hydride, halogenide, carboxylate, alkoxy, hydroxy or<br>
tetrafluoroborate;<br>
S is a so-called spectator ligand, a neutral ligand that is difficult to exchange, for<br>
example an aromatic compound, an olefin or a diene. Examples of aromatic<br>
compounds are: benzene, toluene, xylene, cumene, cymene, naphthalene,<br>
anisole, chlorobenzene, indene, cyclopentadienyl derivatives, tetraphenyl<br>
cyclopentadienone, dihydroindene, tetrahydronaphthalene, gallic acid, benzoic<br>
acid and phenylglycine. It is also possible for the aromatic compound to be<br>
covalently bonded to the ligand. Examples of dienes are norbornadiene,<br>
1,5-cyclooctadiene and 1,5-hexadiene.<br>
L is a neutral ligand that is relatively easy to exchange with other ligands and is for<br>
example a nitrile or a co-ordinating solvent, in particular acetonitrile, dimethyl<br>
sulphoxide (DMSO), methanol, water, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl formamide,<br>
pyridine and N-methylpyrrolidinone.<br>
Examples of suitable transition metal compounds are: [RuCI2(rj6-benzene)]2, [RuCI2(r]6-cymene)]2, [RuCI2(r)5-mesitylene)]2, [RuCI2(rj6-hexamethylbenzene)]2, [RuCI2(r)6-1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene)]2, [RuCI2(rj6-1,3,5-triethylbenzene)]2, [RuCI2(r]6-1,3,5-triTspropylbenzene)]2, [RuCI2(rf-tetramethylthiophene)]2, [RuCI2(r)6-methoxybenzene)]2, [RuBr2(Q6-benzene)]2, [Rul2(n6-benzeen)]2, trans-RuCI2(DMSO)4, RuCI2(PPh3)3, Ru3(CO)12, RU(CO)3(Q4-Ph4C4CO), [Ru2(CO)4(^-H)(C4Ph4COHOCC4Ph4)], [lr(COD)2CI], [lr(CO)2CI]„, [lrCI(CO)3]„, [lr(Acac)(COD)], [lr(NBD)CI2]2, [lr(COD)(C6H6)]+BF4-, (CF3C(0)CHCOCF3)-[lr(COE)2]+, [lr(CH3CN)4]+BF4', [lrCI2Cp*]2, [lrCI2Cp]2, [Rh(C6H10CI]2 (where C6H10 = hexa-1,5-di-ene), [RhCI2Cp*]2, [RhCI2Cp]2, [Rh(COD)CI]2, CoCI2,<br>
If necessary the transition metal compound is converted to a<br><br>
transition metal complex by for example exchanging the neutral ligand L with another ligand L', whereby the transition metal compound changes into MnXpSqUiL'i, or complexing the transition metal compound with a ligand L'. The catalyst on the basis of the transition metal compound and the ligand can be added in the form of separate components of which one is the transition metal compound and the other is the ligand L', or as a complex that contains the transition metal compound and the ligand L'. Suitable racemisation catalysts are obtained for example by complexing the transition metal compound with for example a primary or secondary amine, alcohol, diol, amino alcohol, diamine, mono-acylated diamine, mono-acylated amino alcohol, mono-tosylated diamine, mono-tosylated amino alcohol, amino acid, amino acid amide, amino-thioether, phosphine, bisphosphine, aminophosphine, preferably an aminoalcohol, monoacylated diamine, monotosylated diamine, amino acid, amino acid amide, amino thioether or an aminophosphine. Examples of ligands are described in EP-A-916637 and in Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 10 (1999) 2045-2061, complexing not necessarily taking place with the optically active ligand, but optionally with the racemate corresponding to the optically active ligands described. The ligands are preferably used in quantities that vary between 0.5 and 8 equivalents relative to the metal, in particular between 1 and 3 equivalents. In the case of a bidentate ligand use is preferably made of 0.3-8, in particular 0.5-3 equivalents.<br>
An example of a particularly good class of ligands is the class of amino acid amides of the formula (1).<br><br>
wherein R1 and R4 each independently represent H or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or phenyl group with for instance 1-9 C-atoms; R2 and R3each independently represent H or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group with for instance 1-9 C-atoms, or R1 and R2 form a ring together with the N and C atom to which they are bound.<br>
In most cases activation of catalysts, for example catalysts obtained by complexing of the transition metal compound and the ligand, can be effected for example by treating the transition metal compound or the complex of<br><br>
the transition metal compound and the ligand in a separate step with a base, for example KOH, KOtBu, and subsequently isolating it by removing the base, or by activating the transition metal compound or the complex of the transition metal compound and the ligand in situ, when the acylation/racemisation takes place, i     with a mild base, for example a heterogeneous base, in particular KHC03or K2 CO3, or a homogeneous base, in particular an organic amine, for example triethylamine. It is also possible to activate the transition metal compound with the aid of a reducing agent, for example H2, formic acid and salts thereof, Zn and NaBH4.<br>
The quantities of racemisation catalyst and acylation catalyst to be used are not particularly critical and are for example less than 5, preferably less than 1 mole%, calculated relative to the substrate. The optimum quantities of both catalysts are linked to each other; the quantity of acylation catalyst is preferably adapted so that the overall reaction continues to proceed efficiently, that is to say, that the racemisation reaction does not proceed much slower than the acylation reaction and thus the e.e. of the remaining substrate does not become too high. The optimum ratio between racemisation catalyst and acylation catalyst for a given reaction/catalyst system can simply be established by experimental means.<br>
The secondary alcohol that is used as substrate (substrate alcohol) can if desired be formed beforehand from the corresponding ketone in a separate step (that principally does not need to be stereoselective at all) with the aid of a reducing ancillary reagent, the reduction preferably being catalysed by the racemisation catalyst, and a cheap and preferably volatile alcohol being used as reducing ancillary reagent (non stereoselective transfer hydrogenation).<br>
The substrate alcohol can optionally be formed in situ from the corresponding ketone with the aid of a reducing ancillary reagent. This gives the freedom of choice to employ substrate ketone or substrate alcohol or mixtures of both as substrate. The choice can depend on the availability and the simplicity of the synthesis. If the alcohol is formed in situ from the ketone, a hydrogen donor is also added as ancillary reagent. As ancillary reagent preferably a secondary alcohol is added to the reaction mixture that promotes the conversion of the ketone to the substrate alcohol and is not converted by the acylation catalyst. The ancillary reagent is preferably chosen so that it is not also removed from the reaction mixture by the same irreversible removal method by which the acyl donor residue is removed, that this ancillary reagent is not acylated by the acylation<br><br>
catalyst, and has sufficient reduction potential, relative to the substrate ketone, for the creation of a redox equilibrium. Reducing agents other than alcohols can of course also be used as ancillary reagents. One skilled in the art can simply determine by experimental means which compounds are suitable for use as ancillary reagents in his reaction system.<br>
The product ester obtained may subsequently be isolated from the mother liquor using common practice isolation techniques, depending on the nature of the ester, for instance by extraction, destination, chromatography or crystallization. If the product is isolated by crystallization further enantiomeric enrichment may be obtained. If desired, the mother liquor (which may contain the alcohol, ester and/or ketone involved in the reaction) may by recirculated to the non stereoselective hydrogenation or to the conversion of the mixture of the enantiomers of the alcohol to the enantiomerically enriched ester. Normally, before recycling the solids will be removed from the mother liquor and, according to common practice, a purge will be built in in order to prevent built up of impurities. If desired, the ester in the mother liquor will first be saponified. This is especially desirable if saponification of the ester under the reaction conditions of the non stereoselective hydrogenation respectively the conversion of the mixture of the enantiomers of the alcohol to the enantiomerically enriched ester, is rather slow.<br>
With the process according to the invention an enantiomerically enriched ester can be obtained with enantiomeric excess (e.e.) larger than 95%, preferably larger than 98%, more preferably larger than 99%, optionally after recrystallization. The enantiomerically enriched ester obtained can subsequently be used as such. If the alcohol is the desired product, the enantiomerically enriched ester is subsequently converted by a known procedure into the corresponding enantiomerically enriched alcohol. This can for example be effected by means of a conversion catalysed by an acid, base or enzyme. When an enantioselective enzyme is used the enantiomeric excess of the product alcohol can be increased further by this. When the enantioselective esterification according to the invention has been carried out with the aid of an enzyme, the same enzyme can very suitably be used for the conversion of the enantiomerically enriched ester into the enantiomerically enriched alcohol. When the ultimate goal is the preparation of the alcohol, the acyl donor can be freely chosen in such a way that the physical or chemical properties of the acyl donor and the acyl donor residue are optimal for the irreversible removal of the acyl donor residue and the<br><br>
treatment of the reaction mixture. With the process according to the invention enantiomerically enriched alcohols with an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) larger than 95%, preferably larger than 98%, more preferably larger than 99% can be obtained, optionally after recrystallization and/or hydrolysis with the aid of an enantioselective enyme.<br>
The alcohols thus obtained form commonly used building blocks<br>
in the preparation of for example liquid crystals, agrochemicals and<br>
pharmaceuticals, for example of secondary aliphatic alcohols or aryl alcohols, for<br>
example of 1-aryl-ethanols, -propanols, -butanols or-pentanols. In the literature<br>
applications are known of for example 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propenyl-1-ol in<br>
J. Heterocycl. Chem (1977), 14 (5), 717-23; 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-propanol in<br>

The invention also relates to the preparation of an<br><br>
enantiomerically enriched alcohol from the enantiomerically enriched ester obtained.<br>
The invention will be elucidated on the basis of the examples, without however being limited by them.<br>
In all examples the enantioselective transesterification is catalysed by Novozym® 435 (Candida antartica). For the tested chiral alcohols the lipase is selective for the R-alcohol. The chiral esters were thus obtained with R-selectivity.<br>
Example I and comparative experiment A<br>

Conversion of (R.SH-phenvlethanol to (R)-a-methvlbenzvl butvrate using a<br>
iridium racemisation catalyst<br>
The following procedure is performed using different amounts of the mentioned catalyst:<br>
Placed in a three-necked round bottom flask of 100 ml:<br>
[lrCI2Cp*]2 (796)<br>
Ligand 12 (151):	small excess compared to iridium<br>
(R,S)-1-phenylethanol (122):	36 mmol<br>
The catalyst precursor and the ligand were dissolved in the<br>
substrate. The resulting clear solution was degassed by five vacuum<br>
(50 mbar)/nitrogen purge cycles. The complexation was carried out at 70°C at<br>
atmospheric pressure. The obtained clear solution was cooled to room<br>
temperature. To the solution is respectively added:<br>
Isopropyl butyrate (130):	72 mmol<br>
o-xylene:	23 ml<br>
K2C03(138)	2,5 g<br>
Novozym435®:	400 mg<br>
The reaction vessel was closed under air atmosphere. After reducing the pressure to 50 mbar the reaction mixture was heated to 70°C. The pressure in the reaction vessel was allowed to equilibrate at this temperature. During the course of the reaction the pressure was slowly adjusted to 80 mbar. Under the chosen conditions isopropanol and small amounts of o-xylene and isopropyl butyrate were destilled during 21 hours.<br><br><br>
Example XXVII<br>
Conversion of (R.S)-2-octanol to (R)-2-octvl butvrate<br>
Ligands used were mentioned in example XXIII.<br>
Placed in a three-necked round bottom flask of 100 ml:<br>
Catalyst precurcor:	0,036 mmol<br>
Ligand:	0,072 mmol<br>
(R,S)-2-octanol(130):	36 mmol<br>
The catalyst precursor and the ligand were dissolved in the<br>
substrate. The resulting clear solution was degassed by five vacuum<br>
(50 mbar)/nitrogen purge cycles. The complexation was carried out at 70°C at<br>
atmospheric pressure. The obtained clear solution was cooled to room<br>
temperature. To the solution is respectively added:<br>

WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	A process for the preparation of an enantiomerically enriched ester, in which a mixture of the enantiomers of the corresponding secondary alcohol is subjected, in the presence of an acyl donor, to an enantioselective conversion in the presence of a racemisation catalyst upon which the ester is formed and an acyl donor residue is obtained, characterised in that the acyl donor residue is irreversibly removed from the phase in which the enantioselective conversion takes place.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1, in which the alcohol concentration is higher than 1M.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claim 2, in which the alcohol concentration is higher than 2M.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claim 3, in which no solvent is used.<br>
5.	The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, in which the enantioselective conversion is an enzymatic conversion.<br>
6.	The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, in which a transfer hydrogenation catalyst is used as racemisation catalyst.<br>
7.	The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, in which a racemisation catalyst with a transition metal chosen from the group of Ru and Ir is used.<br>
8.	The process as claimed in claim 7, in which the racemisation catalyst contains an amino acid amide of the formula (1).<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R4 each independently represent H, an alkyl or a phenyl group; R2 and R3 each independently represent H or an alkyl group or R1 and R2 form a ring together with the N and C atoms to which they are bound, as the ligand L'.<br>
9.	The process as claimed in   any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the enantioselective conversion takes place in the presence of a ketone.<br>
10.	The process as claimed in  any one of claims 1 to 9, in which the secondary alcohol is formed in situ from the corresponding ketone, in the presence of a hydrogen donor.<br>
11.	The process as claimed in claim 10, in which a mixture of the secondary alcohol and the corresponding ketone is used as substrate.<br>
12.	The process as claimed in claim 10 or 11, in which the reaction mixture also contains a reducing agent as ancillary reagent.<br>
13.	The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12, in which the acyl donor is chosen so that the acyl donor residue is converted in situ into another compound.<br>
14.	The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 13, in which the acyl donor residue is removed via distillation under reduced pressure.<br>
15.	The process as claimed in claim 14, in which the acyl donor is chosen from the group of carboxylic acid esters of an alcohol with 1-7 carbon atoms.<br><br>
16.	The process as claimed in claim 15, in which the acyldonor is chosen from the group of<br>
carboxylic esters of an alcohol with 1-4 C-atoms and a carboxylic acid with 4-20 C-atoms.<br>
17.	The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 16, in which the enantiomerically<br>
enriched ester obtained is subsequently converted into the corresponding enantiomerically<br>
enriched alcohol.<br>
18.	The process as claimed in claim 17, in which the conversion is carried out in the<br>
presence of an enantioselective enzyme.<br>
19.	The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 18, in which the ester or alcohol<br>
obtained is subsequently converted into a liquid crystal, an agro chemical or a pharmaceutical.<br>
