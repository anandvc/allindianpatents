[0013]	Further objects, features and advantages of the invention will be<br>
apparent from the following detailed description.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014]	The present invention provides methods for synthesizing amino<br>
substituted quinolinone compounds. Such compounds act as antagonists of<br>
receptor tyrosine kinases, and, more particularly, as inhibitors of PDGFRa and<br>
PDGFRp, bFGF and/or VEGF-RTK function. Such compounds also have<br>
potent activity with respect to other tyrosine kinases and also with respect to<br>
various serine/threonine kinases. The compounds provided herein can be<br>
formulated into pharmaceutical formulations that are useful, for example, in<br>
treating patients with a need for an inhibitor of VEGF-RTK, especially, for use<br>
in compositions and methods for reducing capillary proliferation and in the<br>
treatment of cancer. The methods for synthesizing amino substituted<br>
quinolinone compounds allows for the synthesis of formulations and<br>
compounds that have reduced amounts of lithium.<br>
[0015]	The following abbreviations and definitions are used throughout<br>
this application:<br>
[0016]	"bFGF" is an abbreviation that stands for basic fibroblast growth<br>
factor.<br>
[0017]	"bFGFR", also referred to as FGFR1, is an abbreviation that<br>
stands for a tyrosine kinase that interacts with the fibroblast growth factor<br>
FGF.<br>
[0018]	"PDGF" is an abbreviation that stands for platelet derived growth<br>
factor. PDGF interacts with tyrosine kinases PDGFRa and PDGFRp.<br>
[0019]	"RTK" is an abbreviation that stands for receptor tyrosine kinase.<br>
[0020]	"VEGF" is an abbreviation that stands for vascular endothelial<br>
growth factor.<br>
[0021]	"VEGF-RTK" is an abbreviation that stands for vascular<br>
endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase.<br><br>
[0022J	Generally, reference to a certain element such as hydrogen or H<br>
is meant to include all isotopes of that element. For example, if an R group is<br>
defined to include hydrogen or H, it also includes deuterium and tritium.<br>
[0023]	The phrase "unsubstituted alkyl" refers to alkyl groups that do<br>
not contain heteroatoms. Thus the phrase includes straight chain alkyl groups<br>
such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl,<br>
undecyl, dodecyl and the like. The phrase also includes branched chain<br>
isomers of straight chain alkyl groups, including but not limited to, the<br>
following which are provided by way of example: -CH(CH3)2,<br>
-CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), -CH(CH2CH3)2, -C(CH3)3, -C(CH2CH3)3, -CH2CH(CH3)2,<br>
-CH2CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2, -CH2C(CH3)3, -CH2C(CH2CH3)3,<br>
-CH(CH3)CH(CH3)(CH2CH3),-CH2CH2CH(CH3)2, -CH2CH2CH(CH3)(CH2CH3),<br>
-CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)2, -CH2CH2C(CH3)3, -CH2CH2C(CH2CH3)3,<br>
-CH(CH3)CH2CH(CH3)2,-CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH(CH3)2,<br>
-CH(CH2CH3)CH(CH3)CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), and others. The phrase also<br>
includes cyclic alkyl groups such as cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopropyl,<br>
cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl and such rings<br>
substituted with straight and branched chain alkyl groups as defined above.<br>
The phrase also includes polycyclic alkyl groups such as, but not limited to,<br>
adamantyl norbornyl, and bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl and such rings substituted with<br>
straight and branched chain alkyl groups as defined above. Thus, the phrase<br>
unsubstituted alkyl groups includes primary alkyl groups, secondary alkyl<br>
groups, and tertiary alkyl groups. Unsubstituted alkyl groups may be bonded<br>
to one or more carbon atom(s), oxygen atom(s), nitrogen atom(s), and/or<br>
sulfur atom(s) in the parent compound. Preferred unsubstituted alkyl groups<br>
include straight and branched chain alkyl groups and cyclic alkyl groups<br>
having 1 to 20 carbon atoms. More preferred such unsubstituted alkyl groups<br>
have from 1 to 10 carbon atoms while even more preferred such groups have<br>
from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Most preferred unsubstituted alkyl groups include<br>
straight and branched chain alkyl groups having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and<br>
include methyl, ethyl, propyl, and -CH(CH3)2.<br><br>
[0024]	The phrase "substituted alkyl" refers to an unsubstituted alky!<br>
group as defined above in which one or more bonds to a carbon(s) or<br>
hydrogen(s) are replaced by a bond to non-hydrogen and non-carbon atoms<br>
such as, but not limited to, a halogen atom in halides such as F, CI, Br, and I;<br>
an oxygen atom in groups such as hydroxyl groups, alkoxy groups, aryloxy<br>
groups, and ester groups; a sulfur atom in groups such as thiol groups, alkyl<br>
and aryl sulfide groups, sulfone groups, sulfonyl groups, and sulfoxide groups;<br>
a nitrogen atom in groups such as amines, amides, alkylamines,<br>
dialkylamines, arylamines, alkylarylamines, diarylamines, N-oxides, imides,<br>
and enamines; a silicon atom in groups such as in trialkylsilyl groups,<br>
dialkylarylsilyl groups, alkyldiarylsilyl groups, and triarylsilyl groups; and other<br>
heteroatoms in various other groups. Substituted alkyl groups also include<br>
groups in which one or more bonds to a carbon(s) or hydrogen(s) atom is<br>
replaced by a bond to a heteroatom such as oxygen in carbonyl, carboxyl,<br>
and ester groups; nitrogen in groups such as imines, oximes, hydrazones,<br>
and nitriles. Preferred substituted alkyl groups include, among others, alkyl<br>
groups in which one or more bonds to a carbon or hydrogen atom is/are<br>
replaced by one or more bonds to fluorine atoms. One example of a<br>
substituted alkyl group is the trifluoromethyl group and other alkyl groups that<br>
contain the trifluoromethyl group. Other alkyl groups include those in which<br>
one or more bonds to a carbon or hydrogen atom is replaced by a bond to an<br>
oxygen atom such that the substituted alkyl group contains a hydroxyl, alkoxy,<br>
aryloxy group, or heterocyclyloxy group. Still other alkyl groups include alkyl<br>
groups that have an amine, alkylamine, dialkylamine, arylamine,<br>
(alkyl)(aryl)amine, diarylamine, heterocyclylamine, (alkyl)(heterocyclyl)amine,<br>
(aryl)(heterocyclyl)amine, or diheterocyclylamine group.<br>
[0025]	The phrase "unsubstituted aryl" refers to aryl groups that do not<br>
contain heteroatoms. Thus, by way of example, the phrase includes, but is<br>
not limited to, groups such as phenyl, biphenyl, anthracenyl, and naphthyl.<br>
Although the phrase "unsubstituted aryl" includes groups containing<br>
condensed rings such as naphthalene, it does not include aryl groups that<br><br>
have other groups such as alkyl or halo groups bonded to one of the ring<br>
members, as aryl groups such as tolyl are considered herein to be substituted<br>
aryl groups as described below. A preferred unsubstituted aryl group is<br>
phenyl, in some embodiments, unsubstituted aryl groups have from 6 to 14<br>
carbon atoms. Unsubstituted aryl groups may be bonded to one or more<br>
carbon atom(s), oxygen atom(s), nitrogen atom(s), and/or sulfur atom(s) in the<br>
parent compound.<br>
[0026]	The phrase "substituted aryl group" has the same meaning with<br>
respect to unsubstituted aryl groups that substituted alkyl groups had with<br>
respect to unsubstituted alkyl groups. However, a substituted aryl group also<br>
includes aryl groups in which one of the aromatic carbons is bonded to one of<br>
the non-carbon or non-hydrogen atoms described above and also includes<br>
aryl groups in which one or more aromatic carbons of the aryl group is bonded<br>
to a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group as defined<br>
herein. This includes bonding arrangements in which two carbon atoms of an<br>
aryl group are bonded to two atoms of an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group to<br>
define a fused ring system (e.g. dihydronaphthyl or tetrahydronaphthyl).<br>
Thus, the phrase "substituted aryl" includes, but is not limited to groups such<br>
as tolyl, and hydroxyphenyl among others.<br>
[0027]	The phrase "unsubstituted alkenyl" refers to straight and<br>
branched chain and cyclic groups such as those described with respect to<br>
unsubstituted alkyl groups as defined above, except that at least one double<br>
bond exists between two carbon atoms. Examples include, but are not limited<br>
to vinyl, -CH=C(H)(CH3), -CH=C(CH3)2, -C(CH3)=C(H)2, -C(CH3)=C(H)(CH3),<br>
-C(CH2CH3)=CH2, cyclohexenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexadienyl, butadienyl,<br>
pentadienyl, and hexadienyl among others. In some embodiments,<br>
unsubstituted alkenyl groups have from 2 to 8 carbon atoms.<br>
[0028]	The phrase "substituted alkenyl" has the same meaning with<br>
respect to unsubstituted alkenyl groups that substituted alkyl groups had with<br>
respect to unsubstituted alkyl groups. A substituted alkenyl group includes<br><br>
alkenyl groups in which a non-carbon or non-hydrogen atom is bonded to a<br>
carbon double bonded to another carbon and those in which one of the non-<br>
carbon or non-hydrogen atoms is bonded to a carbon not involved in a double<br>
bond to another carbon.<br>
[0029]	The phrase "unsubstituted alkynyl" refers to straight and<br>
branched chain groups such as those described with respect to unsubstituted<br>
alkyl groups as defined above, except that at least one triple bond exists<br>
between two carbon atoms. Examples include, but are not limited to -C≡C(H),<br>
-C≡C(CH3), -C=C(CH2CH3), -C(H2)C≡C(H), -C(H)2C≡C(CH3), and<br>
-C(H)2C≡C(CH2CH3) among others. In some embodiments, unsubstituted<br>
alkynyl groups have from 2 to 8 carbon atoms.<br>
[0030]	The phrase "substituted alkynyl" has the same meaning with<br>

-OCH2(CH2)q(heterocyclyl) group, where q is selected from 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, the<br>
heterocyclyl group may be bonded to a methylene carbon of the -OCH2(CH2)q<br>
group of the -OCH2(CH2)q(heterocyclyl) through various ring members. By<br>
way of non-limiting example, where q is 1 and the heterocyclyl group is<br>
tetrahydrofuran, the group could be represented by the formula<br>
-OCH2CH2(tetrahydrofuranyl) which corresponds to the following two<br>
structures:<br><br>
where structure VIII represents the group that can be referred to as the<br>
-OCH2CH2(2-tetrahydrofuranyl) group and structure IX represents the group<br>
that can be referred to as the -OCH2CH2(3-tetrahydrofuranyl) group. When<br>
the heterocyclyl group is a N-containing heterocycle, such as, but not limited<br>
to piperidine, piperazine, morpholine, or pyrrolidine, the heterocycle can be<br>
bonded to the methylene carbon through a ring carbon atom or through a<br><br>
nitrogen atom in the ring of the N-containing heterocycle. Both of these are<br>
preferred. Where the heterocyclyl group is a piperidine and q is 2 for an<br>
-OCH2(CH2)q(heterocyclyl) group, the following structures are possible and<br>
preferred:<br><br>
[0073]	Structure X is an example of a -O(CH2)3(N-piperidinyl) or<br>

and structure XV is an example of a -O(CH2)2(1-piperazinyl) or -O(CH2)2(N-<br>

-O(CH2)2(N-pyrrolidinyl), -O(CH2)2(2-pyrrolidinyl), and -O(CH2)2(3-pyrrolidinyl).<br>
[0076]	Scheme 1 depicts one exemplary synthetic route for the<br>
synthesis of a compound of a benzimidazolyl quinolinone compound and<br>
should not be interpreted to limit the invention in any manner. As shown<br>
below, the reaction of a first compound with a second compound is believed<br>
to proceed via an uncyclized intermediate. However, this will be understood<br>
to not limit the invention in any manner. The potassium salt of the resulting<br>
compound having the formula III produced on cyclization of the intermediate<br>
has been found to have reduced solubility resulting in precipitation of the<br>
product from the reaction. This was surprising and unexpected given that<br>
precipitation was not observed when a lithium salt such as LiHMDS was used<br>
rather than a potassium salt such as KHMDS. The use of the potassium salt<br>
rather than a lithium salt provides a greatly enhanced yield of compounds<br>
having the formula ill such as compounds having the formula IIIB as shown in<br>
Scheme 1 especially when a base such as a potassium alkoxide such as<br>
potassium t-butoxide is employed. The reaction of the first compound with the<br>
second compound was also found to provide significantly higher yields of<br>
compounds having the formula HI when the reaction was conducted with<br><br>
solvents and reactants with low water contents. For example, the yield was<br>
found to improve significantly when the second compound was dried as<br>
described herein such as by azeotropic evaporation from absolute ethanol or<br>
in the reaction vessel by repeated addition of THF followed by distillation. The<br>
yield of the compound having the formula VI, such as a compound having the<br>
formula VIH, produced by the reaction of an N-alkyl piperazine such as N-<br>
methyl piperazine with the compound having the formula VII, was increased<br>
when the temperature was lowered and the amount of the compound having<br>
the formula HR7 was increased with respect to the compound having the<br>
formula VI. The temperatures of the reaction were lowered and the reaction<br>
was diluted with ethanol during scale up. For example, good yields were<br>
obtained when the reaction was conducted at a temperature of 90°C to<br>
100°C, and the compound having the formula HR7, such as N-methyl<br>
piperazine, was present in an amount of greater than 2.5 equivalents with<br>
respect to the amount of the compound having the formula VI, such as 5-<br>
chloro-2-nitroaniline. In some such embodiments, the compound having the<br>
formula HR7 is present in an amount of greater than 2.8, greater than 2.9,<br>
greater than 3.0, or from 2.5 to 5 equivalents with respect to the amount of the<br>
compound having the formula VI.<br><br><br>
[0077]	Scheme 2 depicts a method for synthesizing a compound<br>
having the formula VA and shows the general application of the method of the<br>
invention. Those skilled in the art will understand that the selection of a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted diaminobenzene and a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted anthranilonitrile allows for the synthesis of a wide variety of<br>
compounds having the formula III. Those skilled in the art will also recognize<br>
that certain groups may need protection using standard protecting groups for<br>
the final cyclization reaction. The extremely versatile synthetic route allows a<br>
plethora of compounds having the formula III to be readily prepared by a<br>
highly convergent and efficient synthetic route.<br><br><br>

Example 1<br>
Synthesis of 5-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline<br>
Procedure A<br><br>
[0082]	5-Chloro-2-nitroaniline (500 g, 2.898 mol) and 1-methyl<br>
piperazine (871 g, 8.693 mol) were placed in a 2000 mL flask fitted with a<br>
condenser and purged with N2. The flask was placed in an oil bath at 100°C<br>
and heated until the 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline was completely reacted (typically<br>
overnight) as determined by HPLC. After HPLC confirmed the disappearance<br>
of the 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline, the reaction mixture was poured directly (still<br>
warm) into 2500 mL of room temperature water with mechanical stirring. The<br>
resulting mixture was stirred until it reached room temperature and then it was<br>
filtered. The yellow solid thus obtained was added to 1000 mL of water and<br>
stirred for 30 minutes. The resulting mixture was filtered, and the resulting<br>
solid was washed with TBME (500 mL, 2X) and then was dried under vacuum<br>
for one hour using a rubber dam. The resulting solid was transferred to a<br>
drying tray and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C to a constant weight to yield<br>
670 g (97.8%) of the title compound as a yellow powder.<br>
Procedure B<br>
[0083]	5-Chloro-2-nitroaniline (308.2 g, 1.79 mol) was added to a 4-<br>
neck 5000 mL round bottom flask fitted with an overhead stirrer, condenser,<br>
gas inlet, addition funnel, and thermometer probe. The flask was then purged<br>
with N2. 1-Methylpiperazine (758.1 g, 840 mL, 7.57 mol) and 200 proof<br>
ethanol (508 mL) were added to the reaction flask with stirring. The flask was<br>
again purged with N2, and the reaction was maintained under N2. The flask<br>
was heated in a heating mantle to an internal temperature of 97°C (+/- 5°C)<br>
and maintained at that temperature until the reaction was complete (typically<br><br>
about 40 hours) as determined by HPLC. After the reaction was complete,<br>
heating was discontinued and the reaction was cooled to an internal<br>
temperature of about 20°C to 25°C with stirring, and the reaction was stirred<br>
for 2 to 3 hours. Seed crystals (0.20 g, 0.85 mmol) of 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-<br>
yl)-2-nitroaniline were added to the reaction mixture unless precipitation had<br>
already occurred. Water (2,450 mL) was added to the stirred reaction mixture<br>
over a period of about one hour while the internal temperature was<br>
maintained at a temperature ranging from about 20°C to 30°C. After the<br>
addition of water was complete, the resulting mixture was stirred for about one<br>
hour at a temperature of 20°C to 30°C. The resulting mixture was then<br>
filtered, and the flask and filter cake were washed with water (3 x 2.56 L). The<br>
golden yellow solid product was dried to a constant weight of 416 g (98.6%<br>
yield) under vacuum at about 50°C in a vacuum oven.<br>
Procedure C<br>
[0084]	5-Chloro-2-nitroaniline (401 g, 2.32 mol) was added to a 4-neck<br>
12 L round bottom flask fitted with an overhead stirrer, condenser, gas inlet,<br>
addition funnel, and thermometer probe. The flask was then purged with N2.<br>
1-MethyIpiperazine (977 g, 1.08 L, 9.75 mol) and 100% ethanol (650 mL)<br>
were added to the reaction flask with stirring. The flask was again purged<br>
with N2, and the reaction was maintained under N2. The flask was heated in a<br>
heating mantle to an internal temperature of 97°C (+/- 5°C) and maintained at<br>
that temperature until the reaction was complete (typically about 40 hours) as<br>
determined by HPLC. After the reaction was complete, heating was<br>
discontinued and the reaction was cooled to an internal temperature of about<br>
80°C with stirring, and water (3.15 L) was added to the mixture via an addition<br>
funnel over the period of 1 hour while the internal temperature was maintained<br>
at 82°C (+/- 3°C). After water addition was complete, heating was<br>
discontinued and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool over a period of no<br>
less than 4 hours to an internal temperature of 20-25°C. The reaction mixture<br>
was then stirred for an additional hour at an internal temperature of 20-30°C.<br>
The resulting mixture was then filtered, and the flask and filter cake were<br><br>
washed with water (1 x 1 L), 50% ethanol (1 x 1L), and 95% ethanol (1 x 1L).<br>
The golden yellow solid product was placed in a drying pan and dried to a<br>
constant weight of 546 g (99% yield) under vacuum at about 50°C in a<br>
vacuum oven.<br>
Example 2<br>
Synthesis of [6-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-acetic<br>
acid ethyl ester<br>
Procedure A<br><br>
[0085]	A 5000 mL, 4-neck flask was fitted with a stirrer, thermometer,<br>
condenser, and gas inlet/outlet. The equipped flask was charged with 265.7 g<br>
(1.12 mol. 1.0 eq) of 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline and 2125 mL of<br>
200 proof EtOH. The resulting solution was purged with N2 for 15 minutes.<br>
Next, 20.0 g of 5% Pd/C (50% H2O w/w) was added. The reaction was<br>
vigorously stirred at 40-50°C (internal temperature) while H2 was bubbled<br>
through the mixture. The reaction was monitored hourly for the<br>
disappearance of 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline by HPLC. The<br>
typical reaction time was 6 hours.<br>
[0086]	After all the 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline had<br>
disappeared from the reaction, the solution was purged with N2 for 15<br><br>
minutes. Next, 440.0 g (2.25 mol) of ethyl 3-ethoxy-3-iminopropanoate<br>
hydrochloride was added as a solid. The reaction was stirred at 40-50°C<br>
(internal temperature) until the reaction was complete. The reaction was<br>
monitored by following the disappearance of the diamino compound by HPLC.<br>
The typical reaction time was 1-2 hours. After the reaction was complete, it<br>
was cooled to room temperature and filtered through a pad of Celite filtering<br>
material. The Celite filtering material was washed with absolute EtOH (2 x<br>
250 mL), and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure providing<br>
a thick brown/orange oil. The resulting oil was taken up in 850 mL of a 0.37%<br>
HCl solution. Solid NaOH (25 g) was then added in one portion, and a<br>
precipitate formed. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hour and then<br>
filtered. The solid was washed with H2O (2 x 400 mL) and dried at 50°C in a<br>
vacuum oven providing 251.7 g (74.1%) of [6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzoimidazol-2-yl]-acetic acid ethyl ester as a pale yellow powder.<br>
Procedure B<br>
[0087]	A 5000 mL, 4-neck jacketed flask was fitted with a mechanical<br>
stirrer, condenser, temperature probe, gas inlet, and oil bubbler. The<br>
equipped flask was charged with 300 g (1.27 mol) of 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-<br>
yl)-2-nitroaniline and 2400 mL of 200 proof EtOH (the reaction may be and<br>
has been conducted with 95% ethanol and it is not necessary to use 200<br>
proof ethanol for this reaction). The resulting solution was stirred and purged<br>
with N2 for 15 minutes. Next, 22.7 g of 5% Pd/C (50% H2O w/w) was added<br>
to the reaction flask. The reaction vessel was purged with N2 for 15 minutes.<br>
After purging with N2, the reaction vessel was purged with H2 by maintaining a<br>
slow, but constant flow of H2 through the flask. The reaction was stirred at<br>
45-55°C (internal temperature) while H2 was bubbled through the mixture until<br>
the 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline was completely consumed as<br>
determined by HPLC. The typical reaction time was 6 hours.<br>
[0088]	After all the 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline had<br>
disappeared from the reaction, the solution was purged with N2 for 15<br><br>
minutes. The diamine intermediate is air sensitive so care was taken to avoid<br>
exposure to air. 500 g (2.56 mol) of ethyl 3-ethoxy-3-iminopropanoate<br>
hydrochloride was added to the reaction mixture over a period of about 30<br>
minutes. The reaction was stirred at 45-55°C (internal temperature) under N2<br>
until the diamine was completely consumed as determined by HPLC. The<br>
typical reaction time was about 2 hours. After the reaction was complete, the<br>
reaction was filtered while warm through a pad of Celite. The reaction flask<br>
and Celite were then washed with 200 proof EtOH (3 x 285 mL). The filtrates<br>
were combined in a 5000 mL flask, and about 3300 mL of ethanol was<br>
removed under vacuum producing an orange oil. Water (530 mL) and then<br>
1M HCL (350 mL) were added to the resulting oil, and the resulting mixture<br>
was stirred. The resulting solution was vigorously stirred while 30% NaOH<br>
(200 mL) was added over a period of about 20 minutes maintaining the<br>
internal temperature at about 25-30°C while the pH was brought to between 9<br>
and 10. The resulting suspension was stirred for about 4 hours while<br>
maintaining the internal temperature at about 20-25°C. The resulting mixture<br>
was filtered, and the filter cake was washed with H2O (3 x 300 mL). The<br>
collected solid was dried to a constant weight at 50°C under vacuum in a<br>
vacuum oven providing 345.9 g (90.1%) of [6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzoimidazol-2-yl]-acetic acid ethyl ester as a pale yellow powder. In an<br>
alternative work up procedure, the filtrates were combined and the ethanol<br>
was removed under vacuum until at least about 90% had been removed.<br>
Water at a neutral pH was then added to the resulting oil, and the solution<br>
was cooled to about 0°C. An aqueous 20% NaOH solution was then added<br>
slowly with rapid stirring to bring the pH up to 9.2 (read with pH meter). The<br>
resulting mixture was then filtered and dried as described above. The<br>
alternative work up procedure provided the light tan to light yellow product in<br>
yields as high as 97%.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Method for Reducing Water Content of [6-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzoimidazol-2-yl]-acetic acid ethyl ester<br>
[0089]	[6-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-acetic acid<br>
ethyl ester (120.7 grams) that had been previously worked up and dried to a<br>
water content of about 8-9% H2O was placed in a 2000 mL round bottom flask<br>
and dissolved in absolute ethanol (500 mL). The amber solution was<br>
concentrated to a thick oil using a rotary evaporator with heating until all<br>
solvent was removed. The procedure was repeated two more times. The<br>
thick oil thus obtained was left in the flask and placed in a vacuum oven<br>
heated at 50°C overnight. Karl Fisher analysis results indicated a water<br>
content of 5.25%. The lowered water content obtained by this method<br>
provided increased yields in the procedure of Example 4. Other solvents such<br>
as toluene and THF may be used in place of the ethanol for this drying<br>
process.<br>
Example 4<br>
Synthesis of 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one<br>
Procedure A<br><br>
[0090]	[6-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1 H-benzimidazoi-2-yl]-acetic acid<br>
ethyl ester (250 g, 820 mmol) (dried with ethanol as described above) was<br>
dissolved in THF (3800 mL) in a 5000 mL flask fitted with a condenser,<br>
mechanical stirrer, temperature probe, and purged with argon. 2-Amino-6-<br>
fluoro-benzonitrile (95.3 g, 700 mmol) was added to the solution, and the<br>
internal temperature was raised to 40°C. When all the solids had dissolved<br>
and the solution temperature had reached 40°C, solid KHMDS (376.2 g, 1890<br><br>
mmol) was added over a period of 5 minutes. When addition of the potassium<br>
base was complete, a heterogeneous yellow solution was obtained, and the<br>
internal temperature had risen to 62°C. After a period of 60 minutes, the<br>
internal temperature decreased back to 40°C, and the reaction was<br>
determined to be complete by HPLC (no starting material or uncyclized<br>
intermediate was present). The thick reaction mixture was then quenched by<br>
pouring it into H2O (6000 mL) and stirring the resulting mixture until it had<br>
reached room temperature. The mixture was then filtered, and the filter pad<br>
was washed with water (1000 mL 2X). The bright yellow solid was placed in a<br>
drying tray and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C overnight providing 155.3 g<br>
(47.9%) of the desired 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one.<br>
Procedure B<br>
[0091]	A 5000 mL 4-neck jacketed flask was equipped with a distillation<br>
apparatus, a temperature probe, a N2 gas inlet, an addition funnel, and a<br>
mechanical stirrer. [6-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-acetic<br>
acid ethyl ester (173.0 g, 570 mmol) was charged into the reactor, and the<br>
reactor was purged with N2 for 15 minutes. Dry THF (2600 mL) was then<br>
charged into the flask with stirring. After all the solid had dissolved, solvent<br>
was removed by distillation (vacuum or atmospheric (the higher temperature<br>
helps to remove the water) using heat as necessary. After 1000 mL of solvent<br>
had been removed, distillation was stopped and the reaction was purged with<br>
N2. 1000 mL of dry THF was then added to the reaction vessel, and when all<br>
solid was dissolved, distillation (vacuum or atmospheric) was again conducted<br>
until another 1000 mL of solvent had been removed. This process of adding<br>
dry THF and solvent removal was repeated at least 4 times (on the 4th<br>
distillation, 60% of the solvent is removed instead of just 40% as in the first 3<br>
distillations) after which a 1 mL sample was removed for Karl Fischer analysis<br>
to determine water content. If the analysis showed that the sample contained<br>
less than 0.20% water, then reaction was continued as described in the next<br>
paragraph. However, if the analysis showed more than 0.20% water, then the<br><br>
drying process described above was continued until a water content of less<br>
than 0.20% was achieved.<br>
[0092]	After a water content of less than or about 0.20% was achieved<br>
using the procedure described in the previous paragraph, the distillation<br>
apparatus was replaced with a reflux condenser, and the reaction was<br>
charged with 2-amino-6-fluoro-benzonitrile (66.2 g, 470 mmol)( in some<br>
procedures 0.95 equivalents is used). The reaction was then heated to an<br>
internal temperature of 38-42°C. When the internal temperature had reached<br>
38-42°C, KHMDS solution (1313 g, 1.32 mol, 20% KHMDS in THF) was<br>
added to the reaction via the addition funnel over a period of 5 minutes<br>
maintaining the internal temperature at about 38-50°C during the addition.<br>
When addition of the potassium base was complete, the reaction was stirred<br>
for 3.5 to 4.5 hours (in some examples it was stirred for 30 to 60 minutes and<br>
the reaction may be complete within that time) while maintaining the internal<br>
temperature at from 38-42°C. A sample of the reaction was then removed<br>
and analyzed by HPLC. If the reaction was not complete, additional KHMDS<br>
solution was added to the flask over a period of 5 minutes and the reaction<br>
was stirred at 38-42°C for 45-60 minutes (the amount of KHMDS solution<br>
added was determined by the following: If the IPC ratio is 
mL was added; if 10.0 ≥ IPC ratio ≥ 3.50, then 56 mL was added; if 20.0 ≥ IPC<br>
ratio ≥ 10, then 30 mL was added. The IPC ratio is equal to the area<br>
corresponding to 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one) divided by the area corresponding to<br>
the uncyclized intermediate). Once the reaction was complete (IPC ratio &gt;<br>
20), the reactor was cooled to an internal temperature of 25-30°C, and water<br>
(350 mL) was charged into the reactor over a period of 15 minutes while<br>
maintaining the internal temperature at 25-35°C (in one alternative, the<br>
reaction is conducted at 40°C and water is added within 5 minutes. The<br>
quicker quench reduces the amount of impurity that forms over time). The<br>
reflux condenser was then replaced with a distillation apparatus and solvent<br>
was removed by distillation (vacuum or atmospheric) using heat as required.<br><br>
After 1500 mL of solvent had been removed, distillation was discontinued and<br>
the reaction was purged with N2. Water (1660 mL) was then added to the<br>
reaction flask while maintaining the internal temperature at 20-30°C. The<br>
reaction mixture was then stirred at 20-30°C for 30 minutes before cooling it to<br>
an internal temperature of 5-10°C and then stirring for 1 hour. The resulting<br>
suspension was filtered, and the flask and filter cake were washed with water<br>
(3 x 650 mL). The solid thus obtained was dried to a constant weight under<br>
vacuum at 50°C in a vacuum oven to provide 103.9 g (42.6% yield) of 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-<br>
quinolin-2-one as a yellow powder.<br><br>
[0093]	[6-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-acetic acid<br>
ethyl ester (608 g, 2.01 mol) (dried) and 2-amino-6-fluoro-benzonitrile (274 g,<br>
2.01 mol) were charged into a 4-neck 12 L flask seated on a heating mantle<br>
and fitted with a condenser, mechanical stirrer, gas inlet, and temperature<br>
probe. The reaction vessel was purged with N2, and toluene (7.7 L) was<br>
charged into the reaction mixture while it was stirred. The reaction vessel was<br>
again purged with N2 and maintained under N2. The internal temperature of<br>
the mixture was raised until a temperature of 63°C (+/- 3°C) was achieved.<br>
The internal temperature of the mixture was maintained at 63°C (+/- 3°C)<br>
while approximately 2.6 L of toluene was distilled from the flask under<br>
reduced pressure (380 +/- 10 torr, distilling head t = 40°C (+/- 10°C) (Karl<br>
Fischer analysis was used to check the water content in the mixture. If the<br>
water content was greater than 0.03%, then another 2.6 L of toluene was<br>
added and distillation was repeated. This process was repeated until a water<br>
content of less than 0.03% was achieved). After a water content of less than<br><br>
0.03% was reached, heating was discontinued, and the reaction was cooled<br>
under N2 to an internal temperature of 17-19°C. Potassium t-butoxide in THF<br>
(20% in THF; 3.39 kg, 6.04 moles potassium t-butoxide) was then added to<br>
the reaction under N2 at a rate such that the internal temperature of the<br>
reaction was kept below 20°C. After addition of the potassium t-butoxide was<br>
complete, the reaction was stirred at an internal temperature of less than 20°C<br>
for 30 minutes. The temperature was then raised to 25°C, and the reaction<br>
was stirred for at least 1 hour. The temperature was then raised to 30°C, and<br>
the reaction was stirred for at least 30 minutes. The reaction was then<br>
monitored for completion using HPLC to check for consumption of the starting<br>
materials (typically in 2-3 hours, both starting materials were consumed (less<br>
than 0.5% by area % HPLC)). If the reaction was not complete after 2 hours,<br>
another 0.05 equivalents of potassium t-butoxide was added at a time, and<br>
the process was completed until HPLC showed that the reaction was<br>
complete. After the reaction was complete, 650 mL of water was added to the<br>
stirred reaction mixture. The reaction was then warmed to an internal<br>
temperature of 50°C and the THF was distilled away (about 3 L by volume)<br>
under reduced pressure from the reaction mixture. Water (2.6 L) was then<br>
added dropwise to the reaction mixture using an addition funnel. The mixture<br>
was then cooled to room temperature and stirred for at least 1 hour. The<br>
mixture was then filtered, and the filter cake was washed with water (1.2 L),<br>
with 70% ethanol (1.2 L), and with 95% ethanol (1.2 L). The bright yellow<br>
solid was placed in a drying tray and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C until a<br>
constant weight was obtained providing 674 g (85.4%) of the desired 4-amino-<br>
5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1 H-quinolin-2-<br>
one.<br><br>

[0094]	A 3000 mL 4-neck flask equipped with a condenser,<br>
temperature probe, N2 gas inlet, and mechanical stirrer was placed in a<br>

methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one (101.0 g, 0.26<br>
mol), and the yellow solid was suspended in 95% ethanol (1000 mL) and<br>
stirred. In some cases ah 8:1 solvent ratio is used. The suspension was then<br>
heated to a gentle reflux (temperature of about 76°C) with stirring over a<br>
period of about 1 hour. The reaction was then stirred for 45-75 minutes while<br>
refluxed. At this point, the heat was removed from the flask and the<br>
suspension was allowed to cool to a temperature of 25-30°C. The suspension<br>
was then filtered, and the filter pad was washed with water (2 x 500 mL). The<br>
yellow solid was then placed in a drying tray and dried in a vacuum oven at<br>
50°C until a constant weight was obtained (typically 16 hours) to obtain 97.2 g<br>
(96.2%) of the purified product as a yellow powder.<br><br>
Example 6<br>
Preparation of Lactic Acid salt of 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-<br>
piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinoIin-2-one<br><br>
[0095]	A 3000 mL 4-necked jacketed flask was fitted with a condenser,<br>
a temperature probe, a N2 gas inlet, and a mechanical stirrer. The reaction<br>
vessel was purged with N2 for at least 15 minutes and then charged with 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1 H-<br>
quinolin-2-one (484 g, 1.23 mol). A solution of D,L-Lactic acid (243.3 g, 1.72<br>
mol of monomer-see the following paragraph), water (339 mL), and ethanol<br>
(1211 mL) was prepared and then charged to the reaction flask. Stirring was<br>
initiated at a medium rate, and the reaction was heated to an internal<br>
temperature of 68-72°C. The internal temperature of the reaction was<br>
maintained at 68-72°C for 15-45 minutes and then heating was discontinued.<br>
The resulting mixture was filtered through a 10-20 micron frit collecting the<br>
filtrate in a 12 L flask. The 12 L flask was equipped with an internal<br>
temperature probe, a reflux condenser, an addition funnel, a gas inlet an<br>
outlet, and an overhead stirrer. The filtrate was then stirred at a medium rate<br>
and heated to reflux (internal temperature of about 78°C). While maintaining<br>
a gentle reflux, ethanol (3,596 mL) was charged to the flask over a period of<br>
about 20 minutes. The reaction flask was then cooled to an internal<br><br>
temperature ranging from about 64-70°C within 15-25 minutes and this<br>
temperature was maintained for a period of about 30 minutes. The reactor<br>
was inspected for crystals. If no crystals were present, then crystals of the<br>
lactic acid salt of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one (484 mg, 0.1 mole %) were added to the<br>
flask, and the reaction was stirred at 64-70°C for 30 minutes before again<br>
inspecting the flask for crystals. Once crystals were present, stirring was<br>
reduced to a low rate and the reaction was stirred at 64-70°C for an additional<br>
90 minutes. The reaction was then cooled to about 0°C over a period of<br>
about 2 hours, and the resulting mixture was filtered through a 25-50 micron<br>
fritted filter. The reactor was washed with ethanol (484 mL) and stirred until<br>
the internal temperature was about 0°C. The cold ethanol was used to wash<br>
the filter cake, and this procedure was repeated 2 more times. The collected<br>
solid was dried to a constant weight at 50°C under vacuum in a vacuum oven<br>
yielding 510.7 g (85.7%) of the crystalline yellow lactic acid salt of 4-amino-5-<br>
fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1 H-quinolin-2-one.<br>
A rubber dam or inert conditions were typically used during the filtration<br>
process. While the dry solid did not appear to be very hygroscopic, the wet<br>
filter cake tends to pick up water and become sticky. Precautions were taken<br>
to avoid prolonged exposure of the wet filter cake to the atmosphere.<br>
[0096]	Commercial lactic acid generally contains about 8-12% w/w<br>
water, and contains dimers and trimers in addition to the monomeric lactic<br>
acid. The mole ratio of lactic acid dimer to monomer is generally about<br>
1.0:4.7. Commercial grade lactic acid may be used in the process described<br>
in the preceding paragraph as the monolactate salt preferentially precipitates<br>
from the reaction mixture.<br>
