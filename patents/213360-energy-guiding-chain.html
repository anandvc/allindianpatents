				<td>Energy guiding chain<br>
The invention relates to an energy guiding chain for guiding cables, hoses and the like from a fixed to a movable connection point on a curved path, with chain straps which are connected to one another in articulated fashion and can be angled relative to one another, where the joint axes of at least some chain straps intersect.<br>
An energy guiding chain of this type is known from EP 0 277 389, for example. This chain is formed by chain links connected to one another in articulated fashion in the known manner, where each of the chain links is formed by two chain straps arranged roughly parallel to one another, which are connected to one another by way of a lower base plate integrally moulded as one piece and an upper detachable or removable cross-member. Each chain link is connected to the adjacent chain link by way of two tab-like strap projections, which snap into corresponding slit-shaped holes in the adjacent chain straps and are connected to them in articulated fashion via pins running through the holes and the strap projections. In order to ensure the back-and-forth rolling motion of the energy guiding chain on a curved - for example helical - path, and in order to produce a curve in the chain, the inner straps of the chain facing the centre point of the curve are shorter than the outer straps of the chain. In addition,<br>
the base plate connecting the chain straps is of trapezoidal kK      shape. The joint axes of each chain link are at an angle to one another, where the point of intersection of the axes defines the centre point of the chain curve. 5<br>
Thus, the known chain can follow the path of a curve in its back-and-forth rolling motion, even if the path is inclined. This offers the advantage that, for example, rotating energy consumers, such as assembly robots and the like, can be con-10 nected by way of this kind of energy guiding chain to energy supply lines installed in a protected and strain-relieved manner.<br>
However, the energy guiding chain disclosed in EP 0 277 389<br>
15 has the disadvantage that, due to the different lengths of the straps and due to the angled position of the joint axes relative to one another, the fit between the joint connections must be very loose in order to guarantee smooth running, i.e. smooth back-and-forth rolling motion, of the chain. The known<br>
20 chain must be manufactured with very large tolerances. The pins and bore holes must engage with a great deal of play, because the chain must move not only in a circle, but also vertically at the same time. Due to this bending in two planes, the chain strand must be able to twist to a certain<br>
25 degree. In turn, the great amount of play in the joint connections makes specially designed guide elements and guide channels indispensable for lateral stabilisation of the chain. The known energy guiding chain also has the disadvantage that chain links of various shapes and sizes must be available in<br>
30 order to produce different radii of curvature and various interior spaces for the energy lines.<br>
The invention is thus based on the task of improving an energy guiding chain of the type described at the start in such a way 35 that it can be manufactured with joint connections of tight tolerance, while retaining good sliding and rolling properties. In particular, the chain according to the invention<br>
should be easy Co assemble and ensure optimum adaptation to the movement cycle of the machine to be equipped and to the desired interior space using simple means.<br>
The task is solved by an energy guiding chain with the features described in the generic definition in Claim 1, which is characterised by the fact that the chain is formed by only one strap strand and that at least some of the chain straps are provided with at least one support frame for accommodating the cables, hoses and the like.<br>
A chain of this kind formed by only one strap strand has various advantages over the known chain. It is considerably easier to assemble, the joint connections can be designed with virtually no play and, above all, the width of the usable space available for accommodating cables, hoses and the like can be varied. This is especially possible through the use of the support frames provided on the chain straps for accommodating the cables.<br>
Experiments with the energy guiding chain according to EP 0 277 389 showed that virtually the entire load of the chain strand is borne by the outer strap strand. The invention takes advantage of this by completely dispensing with one chain strand, so that, in addition to a substantial reduction in weight, the fits of the single-strand chain can be designed to be very tight, this simultaneously improving the lateral stability of the chain, as well as its flexibility and twistabil-ity. The support frames can be mounted on the inside and also the outside of the curve in the chain.<br>
In a preferred version of the invention, the support frame is formed by upper and lower cross-members which can be attached to the chain straps in a. detachable manner and which are assembled to form a closed frame by way of a detachable connecting member. Cross-members of standard, i.e. conventional, chain links can be used for this purpose.<br>
The support frame can alternatively consist of a U-shaped bracket or the like designed as a single piece, which can be mounted on the chain straps in a detachable manner. The width and usable space of the chain can be varied by using support frames or support brackets which can be mounted on the chain straps in a detachable manner.<br>
In a particularly preferred practical example, chain straps with parallel joint axes and chain straps with intersecting joint axes are alternately connected to one another to form a chain strand. In this context, the intersecting joint axes do not all intersect at one point, but rather run along an arc. The centre point of this arc defines the centre point of the circular motion. The alternating arrangement of chain straps with intersecting joint axes and parallel joint axes has the advantage that only one chain link need be replaced at any one time in order to change the diameter of the circle.<br>
The joint sections of chain straps with intersecting joint axes are expediently formed by strap sections angled towards one another.<br>
For example, adjacent chain straps connected to one another can overlap and display a positive fit by way of holes and pins .<br>
It has proven to be particularly expedient for the same side of a chain strap to be positioned on top of the two directly adjacent chain straps, where one chain strap is provided with holes and the directly adjacent chain strap with protruding pins which snap into the holes of the adjacent chain strap.<br>
In order to be able to hold the chain strand together in a secure tashion, the ends of tne upper and lower cross-members on one outer strap, or the ends of the legs of the U-shaped bracket, which respectively form the support frame, are dimensioned such that they cover the overlap area with the adjacent<br>
chain straps and act as 'a stop to prevent separation of the chain straps transverse to the direction of motion. This type of cross-member design is known, but proves to be particularly expedient for the energy guiding chain according to the invention. Each of the chain straps is expediently provided with projections designed as snap ridges, which interact in a known manner with corresponding recesses in the upper and lower cross-members or in the legs of the bracket.<br>
As additional protection against separation of the chain straps transverse to the direction of motion, the straps provided with pins each have a shoulder around a partial length of their outer edges, which is engaged by locking projections of the straps provided with holes.<br>
In a particularly preferred configuration of the invention, the connecting member is provided with projections designed as snap ridges, which interact with recesses in the upper and lower cross-member s. In this way, the support frame for accommodating the cables can be assembled using cross-members for conventional energy guiding chains.<br>
Instead of a support frame, at least some of the chain straps can be provided with support loops for accommodating the cables. This would further reduce the weight and dimensions of the chain according to the invention, which has a positive effect on the running properties of the chain.<br>
To provide additional guidance, at least some of the chain straps can be equipped with guide projections on at least one of their narrow sides, which interact with a groove provided in a guide rail or the like. Guide projections of this kind, which engage the guide groove provided for this purpose with play, can be particularly expedient in the case of large chain radii. The guide projections and the guide groove prevent excessive loading of the chain transverse or tangential to its direction of motion.<br>
The invention is described below based on a practical example illustrated in the drawings.<br>

Figure 1 shows two adjacent chain straps 1 of a strap strand of the energy guiding chain according to the invention. For the sake of simplicity, one of the chain straps will be designated below as inner strap la, and the other as outer strap Ib, where these terms are based on the position of the interior space for the cables or hoses formed by the energy guiding chain selected in the practical example and apply only to the practical example described. It is evident to a person skilled in the art that an interior space for energy lines can be provided on both sides of each chain strap, as illustrated in Fig. 10, in which case the terms outer strap, on the one hand, and inner strap, on the other hand, no longer apply. In this case, the chain strap provided with holes 2 is designated as inner strap la, while chain strap 1 provided with pins (not shown) is designated as outer strap Ib.<br>
As is clearly evident in the drawings, the energy guiding chain according to the invention is formed by a strap strand consisting of inner straps la and outer straps Ib, where pins on outer straps Ib engage holes 2 on inner straps la, so that chain straps 1 form a strand which can be angled in at least one direction, where directly adjacent chain straps connected to one another overlap. In this context, the same side of inner strap la is positioned on top of adjacent outer straps Ib. The joint sections of inner strap la are angled towards one another in such a way that their joint axes 3 intersect a common point. In contrast, joint axes 3 of outer straps Ib run parallel to one another, so that chain straps 1 with parallel joint axes 3 and chain straps 1 with intersecting joint axes 3<br>
energy guiding chain is thus curved, the intersecting joint axes 3 being situated on an arc.<br>
In the practical example shown in Fig. 1, support frames for accommodating cables or hoses are formed on one side of the strap strand by upper cross-members 4, lower cross-members 5 and connecting members 6. Chain straps 1 and connecting members 6 are each provided with known projections 7 designed as snap ridges, which interact with recesses R in upper and lower cross-members 4, 5. Upper and lower cross-members 4, 5 are designed in the manner of conventional cross-members for conventional energy guiding chains and are assembled to form a self-supporting support frame on the side of chain strap 1 by snapping onto projections 7 of chain straps 1 and of connecting members 6. If necessary, intermediate cross-members extending longitudinally between, or perpendicular to, upper and lower cross-members 4, 5 can be provided, which further partition the interior space for the cables or hoses.<br>
Connecting members 6 and upper and lower cross-members 4, 5 of adjacent chain links are not connected to one another. As mentioned at the start, support brackets designed as one piece, which are provided with corresponding recesses in order to snap onto projections 7 of the chain straps, can also be used instead of modularly assembled support frames consisting of upper and lower cross-members 4, 5 and connecting members 6.<br>
The joint sections of inner straps la, which are provided with holes 2, can be designed with additional holes, which act with the stops provided on outer straps Ib as pivot limiters, on the one hand, and also serve to reduce the weight, on the other hand.<br>
The width of upper and lower cross-members 4, 5 is dimensioned such that they - as shown in Fig. 3 - each overlap the overlapping sections of two inner straps la with the associated outer strap, thus holding chain straps 1 together and acting as a stop to prevent the separation of chain straps 1 transverse to the direction of motion. As additional protection<br>
against separation of the strap strand, outer straps Ib are each provided with semi-circular shoulders 14 around the outer edge, which are overlapped by locking projections 15 of inner straps la.<br>
However, pin or press-stud connections can also be provided as an alternative for attaching chain straps 1 to one another.<br>
The overlapping of the overlapping section of two inner straps la with an outer strap 1b by an upper cross-member 4 is illustrated in Fig. 3 in a cut-away, hatched view.<br>
As shown by Figs. 4 to 6, the energy guiding chain according to the invention can run from a connection point on a rotatable consumer to a fixed connection point on a path that is curved in two planes. In Figs. 4 to 6, the consumer is illustrated as a load-bearing column 9 which can rotate about its longitudinal axis. A connecting element 10, designed as an end attachment for the energy guiding chain, is connected to the column and thus also follows its rotating motion. The energy guiding chain runs from this connecting element 10 around load-bearing column 9 and downwards in an arc of 180°. The base of load-bearing column 9 is surrounded by an arc-shaped guide channel 11, on which the energy guiding chain can be rolled back and forth. In the practical example illustrated, guide channel 11 does not completely surround load-bearing column 9, but it can also be designed as a closed, i.e. complete, ring. Guide channel 11 forms an outwardly slanting support surface 12 and a boundary wall 13 extending perpendicular to support surface 12.<br>
Figures 7 to 9 illustrate the position of the energy guiding chain after load-bearing column 9 has rotated 180° in the direction of the arrow shown in Fig. 4. In this position, the energy guiding chain lies on guide channel 11 over the greater part of its length.<br>
Figure 10 shows a practical example of the invention, in which support frames formed by upper and lower cross-members 4, 5 and connecting members 6 are provided on both sides of the chain straps.<br>
In place of guide channel 11 shown in Figs. 4 to 9, a rail or track 16, laid in the shape of an arc and having a guide groove 17, can be provided which guide projections 18 on the lower narrow sides of chain straps 1 engage with play. This kind of track 16, preferably made of a thermoplastic material, can easily be bent into the desired shape by being pre-heated, if necessary. A groove can also be provided in guide channel 11 in order to accommodate guide projections 18.Zgus Spritzgussteile fur die Industrie GmbH D-51147 Koln<br>
