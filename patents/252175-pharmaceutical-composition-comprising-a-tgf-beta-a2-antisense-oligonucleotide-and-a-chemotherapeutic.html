Pharmaceutical composition Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating neoplasms, in one preferred<br>
embodiment to neoplasms of the brain such as glioma, glioblastoma or astrocytoma.<br>
Antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents and radiation are the most common agents and methods, besides<br>
surgery for the treatment of neoplasms. Antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents comprise e.g. alkylating<br>
agents, antimetabolites and alkaloids derived from plants. The common effect of these antineoplastic<br>
chemotherapeutic agents and radiation is the unspecific inhibition of the cell proliferation and the unspecific<br>
induction of cell death respectively, by a wide range of different mechanisms not completely discovered so<br>
far.<br>
The inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of cell death, respectively, primarily influence rapidly<br>
growing cells such as tumor cells. But at the same time the proliferation of other rapidly growing cells such<br>
as cells of the hair follicle, colon mucosa cells and also immune cells is inhibited. The immune cells inhibited<br>
are for example T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, granulocytes, macrophages, microglia<br>
cells as well as the respective precursor cells of the bone marrow. The administration of antineoplastic<br>
chemotherapeutic agents unspecifically inhibiting cell growth is therefore associated with severe side effects<br>
and general suppression of the function of the immune system, which has been proven by a lot of "in vitro"<br>
and "in vivo" results. For example, dacarbazine which cannot be clearly classified according to standard<br>
classification so far is reported to inhibit the humoral and cell-mediated immune response in mouse cells<br>
(Giampietri 1978, Nardelli 1984). The same results can be found for temozolomide which is an active<br>
metabolite of dacarbazine. Further "in vitro" studies of temozolomide show inhibition of cytotoxicity of<br>
lymphocyte activated killer cells (Alvino et al. 1999). CCNU (lomustine) as a representative for alkylating<br>
antineoplastic agents was shown to suppress both T-cells and B-cells (Bernego et al. 1984) by e.g.<br>
suppressing T-cell mediated cytotoxicity and further suppresses T-cell mediated cytotoxicity (Einstein et al.<br>
1975). Further "in vitro" comparative studies of the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide, the antimetabolite 5-<br>
fluorouracil, the alkaloid vincristin and the antibiotic doxorubicine have in common to clearly show<br>
suppression of the cytotoxic T-cell function (Gereis et al. 1987).<br>
Whereas the chemotherapy of some neoplasms is very successful, many neoplasms are accompanied by a<br>
poor life expectancy.<br>
Another approach in the therapy of neoplasms is the stimulation of the immune system. There is a wide range<br>
of stimulators of the function of the immune system and/or the immune cells e.g. immune cell attracting<br>
substances, viruses and molecules involved in antigen processing, presentation or transporting, fusion cells of<br>
dendritic and tumor cells. Antagonists of substances downregulating the function of the immune system are<br>
regarded as stimulators of the immune system as well.<br>
As a common principle these immune stimulators employ the ability of the immune system to selectively kill<br>
"foreign" tumor cells while sparing other fast growing "self cells. This is of course a superior approach for<br>
treating neoplasms compared to unspecific inhibition of all growing cells or unspecific destruction of cells of<br>
an organism, respectively, which is the principle of the above mentioned antineoplastic chemotherapeutic<br>
agents as well as of radiation.<br>
One example for a potent inhibitor of the immune system is TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta)<br>
mediating the neoplasms' escape from immunosurveillance (Wojtowicz-Praga, S. 1997). Cellular immunity<br>
is highly suppressed in patients suffering from neoplasms producing high levels of TGF-beta (de Visser, K.E.<br>
ctal. 1999).<br>
Using a substance specifically inhibiting the TGF-beta production and thus stimulating the immune system is<br>
a promising approach for the treatment of neoplasms (Stauder, G. et al. 2003).<br>
Despite these promising results the tumor therapy with immunostimulators seems to have margins at least in<br>
very quick growing tumors.<br>
Therefore there is an urgent need for the development of new therapeutics also for the treatment of fast<br>
growing neoplasms that are more reliable, have less side effects and increase the life spans of patients<br>
suffering from neoplasms.<br>
In a clinical phase I/H study, upon administration of an immunostimulatory agent (antagonist of the<br>
immunosuppressor TGF-beta), we surprisingly recognized that the median overall survival of patients treated<br>
with an antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent before the treatment with this immunostimulatory agent was<br>
clearly longer compared to patients not pre-treated with an antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent.<br>
Since the antineoplastic agents suppress the immune system by inhibiting the proliferation of the<br>
immunocompetent cells, as described above, up to now the approach of combining these antineoplastic<br>
agents with stimulators of the immune system in human beings were deemed not to be an appropriate<br>
approach for tumor therapy or tumor medicaments. In the literature reporting about neoplasm therapy by<br>
stimulation of the immune system it is emphasized that there has to be a sufficient time delay between the •<br>
administration of a chemotherapeutic agent and a substance stimulating an immune response (e.g.<br><br>
Timmermann, J. M. 2002).<br>
This inhibitory effect of chemotherapeutics on cells of the immune system also was proven in experiments. In these experiments cells of the immune system were treated with antineoplastic therapeutics and stimulators of the immune system, namely antisense oligonucleotides inhibiting TGF-beta. These assays are described in experiment 4 and the results are depicted in figures 9 and 10.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Surprisingly patients treated with a combination of an antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent and a stimulator of the immune system according to this invention showed significant longer life spans compared to patients treated with either of these therapeutics.<br>
The invention comprises a pharmaceutical composition with a stimulator of the function of the immune system and/or immune cells and substances inhibiting cell proliferation and/or inducing cell death. In a preferred embodiment the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one antagonist of TGF-beta and at least one antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent The at least two substances are mixed or are separate. The antagonist of TGF-beta is selected from the group of TGF-beta specific nucleotides, TGF-beta binding proteins that arc no antibodies, TGF-beta binding receptors, parts of TGF-bcta binding receptors, TGF-beta specific peptides and low molecular substances binding TGF-beta or any of their proteins, receptors, part of receptor protein or low molecular substance inhibiting the function of TGF-beta. In yet another embodiment the TGF-beta antagonist is selected from the group of oligonucleotides hybridising with an area of the messenger RNA (m-RNA) and/or DNA encoding TGF-beta, TGF-beta receptors and/or para of them binding TGF-beta, proteins, except antibodies, inhibiting TGF-beta peptides of less than 100 kDa inhibiting TGF-beta, peptides being parts of TGF-beta.<br>
In yet a more preferred embodiment the TGF-beta specific nucleotides are antisense oligonucleotides against TGF-beta.<br>
Another part of this invention are paptides that are part of TGF-beta, their use for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition and the method of treating neoplasms with this preparation.. Methods to treat neoplasms are also part of this invention. The substances or methods stimulating the function of the immune system and/or the immune cells are administered with substances inhibiting cell proliferation and/or inducing cell death. The substances are administered by any known route in the art for adinmistering medicaments.<br>
The at least two substances of the pharmaceutical compositions according to this invention arc mixed together or seperately, optionally in the same carrier formulation or in separate pharmaceutical carriers. The treatment of a patient suffering from unwanted neoplasms with a pharmaceutical composition as described above, in a preferred embodiment additionally with radiation is also part of this invention. The at least two substances of the pharmaceutical compositions according to this invention are administered in parallel, in sequence, through the same route or different routes, together with, the radiation, before or after the radiation.<br>
Surprisingly patients suffering from neoplasms that were treated with at least one substance stimulating the immune system and/or the immune cells together with a substance inhibiting the cell proliferation and/or inducing cell death, and/or radiation show clearly longer life spans compared to patients treated with each of these medicaments and/or therapies alone.<br>
This can lead to a reduction of the dosage of one of these medicaments and/or therapies being administered and thus to the reduction of potential undesireable side effects.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention are peptides, that are part of TGF-beta. These peptides, their use for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition, the use of this composition for the treatment of neoplasms, and the method of treating persons with neoplasms with those peptides is also part of this invention.<br>
figure 1 depicts a comparative study of lymphokine activated killer cell (LAK cell) mediated cytotoxicity on glioma cells. One part of the cells was incubated with the TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30, the other part was additionally treated with CCNU. The figure clearly points out that the cytotoxic activity of LAK cells treated with CCNU in combination with TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 is superior compared to LAK cells treated with only TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30.<br>
5xl06PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) were cultivated in 4- pL RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, in the presence of 10 ng/ml rh. IL-2 (recombinant human interleukin 2), in 5% C02 atmosphere at 37°C. The first 3 days 5 μM TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 was added. After that one part of the cells was incubated with 10 μM CCNU for an additional 6 h. Cell-mediated cytotoxicity, quantified by CARE-LASS assay (Lichtenfels et aL 1994), of LAK cells treated with TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30<br><br>
(horizontal hachures) was compared to LAK cells treated with TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 in combination with CCNU (diagonal hachures). Indicated are means ± SD of quadruplicates.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a comparative study of lymphokine activated killer cell (LAK cell) mediated cytotoxicity on glioma cells. One part of the cells was incubated with the TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 the other part was subsequently treated with Temozolomid (IMZ). The figure clearly points out that the cytotoxic activity of LAK cells treatment with temozolomid after the treatment with TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 is superior compared to LAIC cells treated only with TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30. 5xl06LAK were cultivated in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, in the presence of 10 ng/ml rh IL-2 (recombinant human interleukin 2), in 5% C02 atmosphere at 37°C. The first 3 days 5 uM TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 was added. Cell-mediated cytotoxicity was the:n quantified by CARE-LASS assay (Lichtenfels et al. 1994) in one part of the cells without further treatment (only TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30, horizontal hachures), in the other part in the presence of 30 uM temozolomid (TMZ, diagonal hachures). Indicated are means ± SD of quadruplicates. figure 3 depicts survival data of patients treated with the TGF-beta antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 after treatment with temozolomide according to standard schedule compared, to the median overall survival time of patients treated with temozolomide only according to standard schedule. Survival time is given from start of first chemotherapy after tumor recurrence. Median overall survival time in the clinical study is evaluated from 3 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma and 10 patients with glioblastoma. The survival data are compared to the survival data of the literature. Our data reveal longer median overall survival times if applying TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 following temozolomide than the comparable published data for temozolomide alone: 146.6 weeks vs. 42.0 weeks for patients suffering from anaplastic astrocytoma and 45.1 weeks versus 32.0 weeks for patients suffering from glioblastoma.<br>

a substituted pyrimidine, e.g. cytosine (C), thymine (T) or uracil (U) or a substituted purine, e.g. adenine (A)<br>
or guanine (G) or a modification thereof. As used herein, the terms refer to oligoribonucleotidcs as well as<br>
oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The terms shall also include oligonucleosides (i.e. a oligonucleotide without the<br>
phosphate) and any other organic base containing polymer. The nucleic acids may be double-stranded ox<br>
single-stranded. Double-stranded molecules may be more stable in vivo, while single-stranded molecules<br>
may have increased activity. In one embodiment the nucleotides have lengths between about 6 and about 100<br>

sugar-backbone of an oligonucleotide is replaced with an amide containing backbone, in particular an<br>
aminoethylglycine backbone. The nucleobases are bound directly or indirectly to aza nitrogen atoms of the<br>
amide portion of the backbone. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of PNA<br>
compounds include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos.: 5,539,082; 5,714,331; and 5,719,262, each of<br>

For use in the instant invention, the nucleic acids can be synthesized de novo using any of a number of procedures well known in the art. Such compounds are referred to as 'synthetic nucleic acids.' For example, the b-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite method (Beaucage et al. 1981); nucleoside H-phosphonate method (Garegg et al. 1986, Froehler et al. 1986, Garegg et al. 1986, Gaffhey et al. 1988). These chemistries can be performed by a variety of automated oligonucleotide synthesizers available in the market Alternatively, nucleic acids can be produced on a large scale in plasmids, (see, e.g., Sambrook, et al. 1989) and separated into smaller pieces or administered whole. Nucleic acids can be prepared from existing nucleic acid sequences (e.g., genomic or cDNA) using known techniques, such as those employing restriction enzymes, exonucleases or endonucleases. Nucleic acids prepared in this manner are referred to as isolated nucleic acids. The term "antineoplastic nucleic acid" encompasses both synthetic and isolated antineoplastic nucleic acids.<br>
Modified backbone nucleic acids, such as those having phosphorothioates bonds may be synthesized using automated techniques employing, for example, phosphoramidate or H-phosphonatc chemistries. Aryl- and alkyl-phosphonates can be made, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,469,863. Alkyiphosphotriesters, in which the charged oxygen moiety is alkylated as described in U.S. Pat No. 5,023,243 and European JPatent No. 092,574, can be prepared by automated solid phase synthesis using commercially available reagents. Methods for making other nucleic acid backbone modifications and substitutions have been described (Uhlmann etal. 1990, Goodchild 1990).<br>
Phosphorothioates may be synthesized using automated techniques employing either phosphoramidate or H-phosphonate chemistries. Aryl- and alkyl-phosphonates can be made, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,469,863; and alkyiphosphotriesters (in which the charged oxygen moiety is alkylated as described in U.S. Pat No. 5,023,243 and European Patent No. 092,574) can be prepared by automated solid phase synthesis using commercially available reagents. Methods for making other DNA backbone modifications and substitutions have been described (Uhlmann, E. et al. 1990, Goodchild, J. 1990). Synthesis of peptides of this invention<br>
One method for synthesizing proteins and or peptides of this invention is merfield synthesis. This methodology is characterised by the use of tert-butyl based temporary a-amino protection and benzyl, or substituted benzyl, groups for permanent side chain protection. There are over one hundred different -'« substituted resins suitable for peptide synthesis generally based on polystyrene and polyethylene glycol, which is state of the art knowledge. These resins allow introduction of an amino acid through either substitution, condensation or addition reactions. The traditional resin used for Merrifield synthesis is a chloromethylphenyl substituted resin. Hie first amino acid is attached to the resin through substitution of the chloride by the caesium salt of the BOC-amino acid, generating an equivalent to a benzyl ester. Deprotection of the temporary BOC group uses a 20-50% solution of trifluoroacetic acid (TEA) in dichloromethane and has to be followed by neutralisation of the resulting ammonium salt with a hindered tertiary base. Final cleavage from the resin as well as deprotection of benzyl based side chain protecting groups is achieved using strong acids, usually liquid hydrogen fluoride or trifluoromethane sulphonic acid. Such procedures require specialised apparatus and die highly acidic conditions catalyse several possible rearrangements.<br>
Yet another method of synthesizing proteins and/or peptides according to this invention is Fmoc Polyamide Synthesis, developed by Eric Atherton and Bob Sheppard at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge in the late 1970. The fundamental differences between the Fmoc polyamide strategy when compared to the Merrifield approach are that the reactions are carried out under continuous flow and that the conditions for a-amino deprotection and cleavage from the resin are far more mild. This arises from the adoption of the base labile Fmoc protecting group for a-amino protection. The side chains are generally protected with tert-butyl based groups which, in common with the linkage to the resin, can be cleaved by TFA in the presence of scavengers.<br>
As mentioned above, a large number of resins are available. Traditionally, resins with 4-hydroxymethylphenoxy substitution is used. These allowes were esterified with the anhydride of the first amino acid As a result of the mesomerically electron donating para oxygen atom stabilising the resultant<br><br>
carbocation, cleavage of the peptide from the resin occurs under more mild acid conditions, typically using trifluoroacetic acid with scavengers.<br>
The use of continuous flow means that the reagents are passed through a reaction chamber containing the resin supported peptide. Having passed through this chamber, the reagents can be recirculated back into the chamber again or taken to a waste collection bottle. This allows the resin to be washed clean of excess reagents and unwanted reaction products, which in turn helps drive deprotection steps to completion following Le Chatelier's principle. In addition, the solution can be pass cd through a u.v. detector and monitored at a suitable wavelength for the Fmoc chromophore. A typical cycle consists of:<br>
1.	Deprotection of the preceding residue with piperidine.<br>
2.	Wash to remove any remaining reagents from 1.<br>
3.	Acylation in a recirculatory mode.<br>
4.	Wash to remove excess reagents.<br>

Hie term antineoplastic chemotherapeutic also agents includes nucleic acid molecules for the inhibition of angiogenesis and inductors of the aggregation of tubulin.<br>
Active derivatives of the antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents as well as prodrugs are also part of this invention.<br>
Since a common but tolerable side effect of antineoplastic agents is nausea and vomiting it is obvious to someone skilled in the art that these effects can be avelliated by administering an anti-emetic in conjunction with the antineoplastic agent inducing nausea and/or vomiting. E.g. Ondansetron may be given p.o. in a dose of about 8 mg about 30 minutes before the nausea/vomiting inducing antineoplastic agent is administered. Of course other anti-emtics such as Hasaldol, Benadryl, and Ativan may also be used as needed. The antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent of this invention arc commercialley available. For the synthesis of e.g. tcmozolomid see for example Stevens et al. (1984) or Wang et. al (1994).<br>
Radiation is applied in dosages of about 1 Gy to about 100 Gy, more preferred from about 20 to about 80 Gy and most preferred, e.g. for the treatment of astrocytomas, glioblastomas and gliomas from about 40 to about 60 Gy.<br>
The dosage in preferred embodiments is fractionated which means that, from about 0.1 to about 10 Gy or from about 1 Gy to about 5 Gy or from about 1 Gy to about 2 Gy are applied in one session which is repeated several times during about 1 to about 20 weeks, about 2 to about 10 weeks or 4 to about 8 weeks. The<br><br>
antagonist and/or the substance inhibiting cell proliferation and/or inducing cell death of this invention can be administered before, after or together with the radiation. One cycle of radiation therapy as well as several cycles of radiation are possible, dependnt of the reduction of tumor size.<br>
The radiation usually is performed with 60Co. Radiation with neutrons, protons, negative pi-mesones or neutrone capture are applicable as well.<br>
It is clear to someone sldlled in the art that the dosage is further dependant on the size of the tumor, the build of the patient and the kind of radiation applied. In special embodiments the dosage is about 2 to about 100 fold higher or lower as described above also dependant from the number of fractions the dosage is applied with.<br>
In one embodiment the combination of at least one immunostimulator and at least one antineoplastic agent is useful in the treatment of unwanted neoplasms such as but not limited solid tumors; blood born tumors such as leukemias, acute or chronic myelotic or lymphoblastic leukemia; tumor metastasis; benign tumors, for example hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, neurofibromas, trachomas, and pyogenic granulomas; pre-malignant tumors; astrocytoma, blastoma, chordoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, Ewing's tumor, germinoma, glioma, glioblastoma, hemangioblastoma, hemangioperycatioma, Hodgkins lymphoma, medolloblastoma, leukaemia, mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, non-HodgkLns lymphoma, pinealoma, retinoblastoma, sarcoma (including angiosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, endothelial sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, lymphangioandotheiiosarcoma, lyphangiosarcoma, medolloblastoma, melanoma, meningioma, myosarcoma, neurinoma, oligodendroglioma, osteogenic sarcoma, osteosarcoma), seminoma, subependymoma, Wilm's tumor, or is selected from the group of bile duct carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, brain tumor, breast carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, carcinoma of the kidney, cervical carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, cystadenocarcinome, embryonal carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, colon carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma, liver carcinoma, lung carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, non-small cell bronchogenic/lung carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, pancreas carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinoma, prostate carcinoma, small intestine carcinoma, rectal carcinoma, renal . cell carcinoma, skin carcinoma, small-cell bronchogenic/lung carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, testicular carcinoma, uterine carcinoma.<br>
In another embodiment the composition of at least one agonist and at least one antineoplastic agent may be used in combination with other procedures for the treatment of diseases. For example, a tumor may be treated conventionally with surgery and/or radiation and then the composition of an immunostimulator and antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent according to this invention may be subsequently administered to the patient to extend the dormancy of micrometastases and to stabilize respectively reduce any residual unwanted neoplasm.<br>
In a preferred embodiment a combination of at least one antineoplastic agent and at least one antagonist is administered to a site likely to harbor a metastatic lesion (that may or may not be clinically discernible at the time). A sustained release formulation implanted specifically at the site (or the tissue) where the metastatic lesion is likely to be would be suitable in these latter instances.<br>
The embodiments of the combination of at least one stimulator of the immune cells and/or the immune system and at least one substance inhibiting cell proliferation, and/or inducing cell death is delivered in effective amounts. In general, the term "effective amount" of an antagonist and/or antineoplastic agent refers to the amount necessary or sufficient to realize a desired biologic effect Specifically, the effective amount is that amount that reduces the rate or inhibits altogether formation of neoplasms. For instance, when the subject bears a tumor, an effective amount is that amount which decreases or eliminates the unwanted neoplasm. Additionally, an effective amount may be that amount which prevents an increase or causes a decrease in new unwanted neoplasms.<br>
The effective amount varies depending upon whether the combination is used in single or multiple dosages. Dosages given in this writing are for adults. It is quite clear to someone skilled in the art that these dosages have to be adapted if the human being is a child, a person stressed by a further illness or other circumstances. The effective dosage is dependent also on the method and means of delivery, which can be localized or systemic. For example, in some applications, as in the treatment of skin carcinoma or ophthalmic carcinoma the combination is preferably delivered in a topical or ophthalmic carrier.<br>
In one embodiment subject doses of the compounds described herein typically range from about 0.1 ug to about 10 mg per administration, which depending on the application could be given hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly and any other amount of time therebetween. In yet another embodiment the doses range from about 10 ug to about 5 mg per administration or from about 100 ug to about 1 mg, with 1-10 administrations being spaced hours, days or weeks apart In some embodiments, however, doses may be used in a range even 2 to 100 fold higher or lower than the typical doses described above.<br>

ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In one embodiment the delivery systems include polymer base systems such as poly(lactide-glycolide),<br>
copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric  acid,   and<br>
polyanhydrides. Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for example,<br>
UiLPat No. 5,075,109.<br>
In another embodiment the delivery systems include non-polymer systems that are e.g. lipids including<br>

excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited to calcium carbonate, calcium<br>
phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>
In one embodiment the immunostimulators and substances inhibiting cell proliferation and/or inducing cell<br>
death are administered neat or in the form of a pharmaceutical acceptable salt The salts have to be<br>
pharmaceutical acceptable, but non-pharmaceutical acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare<br>
pharmaceutical acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the<br>
following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, malcic, acetic, salicylic, p-tolucnc<br><br>
sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic, and<br>
benzene salphonic. Also, such salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium,<br>
potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic acid group.<br>
In one embodiment suitable buffering agents include but are not limited to: acetic acid and a salt (1-2% w/v);<br>
citric acid and a salt (1-3% w/v); boric acid and a salt (0.5-2.5% w/v); and phosphoric acid and a salt (0.8-2%<br>
w/v).<br>
Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride (0.003-0.03% w/v); chlorobutanol (0.3-0.9% w/v);<br>
parabens (0.01-0.25% w/v) and thimerosal (0.004-0.02% w/v).<br>
In one embodiment the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for topical administration for the at least two<br>
compounds of a pharmaceutical composition according to this invention include transdermal patches,<br>
ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional<br>
pharmaceatica] carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or<br>
desirable. In yet another embodiment coated condoms, gloves and the like are useful.<br>
In yet another embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions also include penetration enhancers in order to<br>
enhance the alimentary delivery. Penetration enhancers may be classified as belonging to one of five broad<br>
categories, Le., fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, surfactants and non-surfactants (Lee et al. 1991,<br>
Muranishi 1990). One or more penetration enhancers from one or more of these broad categories may be<br>
included.<br>
Various fatty acids and their derivatives which act as penetration enhancers include, for example, oleic acid,<br>
lanric acid, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate,<br>
tricaprate, recinleate, monoolein (a.k.a. 1-monooleoyl-rac-glycerol), riilanrin, caprylic acid, arichidonic acid,<br>
glyceryl 1-monocaprate, l-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, acylcarnitines, acylcholines, mono- and di-<br>
glycerides and physiologically acceptable salts thereof (Le., oleate, laurate, caprate, myristate, palmitate,<br>
stearate, linoleate, etc.) (Lee et al. 1991, Muranishi 1990, El-Hariri et aL 1992). Examples of some presently<br>
preferred fatty acids arc sodium caprate and sodium laurate, used singly or in combination at concentrations<br>
of0.5to5%.<br>
The physiological roles of bile include the facilitation of dispersion and absorption of lipids and fat-soluble<br>
vitamins (Brunton 1996). Various natural bile salts, and their synthetic derivatives, act as penetration<br>
enhancers. Thus, the term "bile salt" includes any of the naturally occurring components of bile as well as<br>
any of their synthetic derivatives. A presently preferred bile salt is chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (Sigma<br>
Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.), generally used at concentrations of 0 J to 2%.<br>
Complex formulations comprising one or more penetration enhancers may be used. For example, bile salts<br>
may be used in combination with fatty acids to make complex formulations. Preferred combinations include<br>
CDCA combined with sodium caprate or sodium laurate (generally 0.5 to 5%).<br>
In one embodiment additionally chelating agents are used that include, but are not limited to, disodium<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), citric acid, salicylates (e.g., sodium salicylate, 5-methoxysalicylate and<br>
homovanillate), N-acyl derivatives of collagen, laureth-9 and N-amino acyl derivatives of beta-diketones<br>
(enaraines) (Lee et al. 1991; Muranishi 1990; Buur et al. 1990). Chelating agents have the added advantage<br>
of also serving as DNase inhibitors.<br>
In yet another embodiment additionally surfactants are used. Sufactants include, for example, sodium lauryl<br>
sulfate, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether and polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether (Lee et al. 1991); and<br>
perftoorochemical emulsions, such as FC-43 (Takahashi et al. 1988).<br>
Non-surfactants include, for example, unsaturated cyclic ureas, 1-alkyl- and 1-alkenylazacyclo-alkanone<br>
derivatives (Lee et al. 1991); and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as diclofenac sodium,<br>
indomethacin and phenylbutazone (Yamashita et al. 1987).<br>
In one embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention additionally contain other<br>
adjunct components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions, at their art-established usage<br>
levels. Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional compatible pharmaceutically active<br>
materials such as, e.g., antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or may contain<br>
additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of the composition of present<br>
invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and<br>
stabilizers. However, such materials, when added, should not unduly interfere with the biological activities of<br>
the components of the compositions of the invention.<br>

Kamofsky performance status (KPS) was at least 70%. Patients with clinically significant acute infections, cardiovascular abnormalities or poorly controlled seizures and pregnant and lactating females were excluded.<br>
Surgical planning was based on computer tomography or magnetic resonance images. The perforated part of the catheter was placed m the solid, enhancing area of the tumor. Ventricles, cysts, resection cavities from prior surgical interventions, blood vessels and eloquent brain areas had to be avoided by the catheter trajectory. The catheter was introduced through a standard burr hole into the center of the largest tumor lesion. The distal end of the catheter was passed several centimetres under the galea through the slcin and filled with saline- TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 was administered intratumorally as a continuous high-flow microperfusion using an external pomp system, Graseby 3200 (Smith Medical, London, GBM). The application system was removed after the end of the infusion. For safety assessment patients were followed up for 28 days. Post-study MRI and survival data until death were collected by the investigators. L Example<br>
47 years old male who was diagnosed with a histologically grade m anaplastic astrocytoma received a combination therapy of several antineoplastic agents and TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30. The antineoplastic agents administered were ACNU together with tcnoposide, tcmozolomide, and PEG-ylated liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx**). ACNU was administered partly parallel with tcnoposide with 90 mg/m2 ACNU on the first day of each cycle and 60 mg/mz of tenoposide on days 1-3 of each cycle. Each cycle comprised 42 days, 4 of these cycles were realized. About 2 years later the patient was treated with 3 cycles of temozolomide. Each cycle of 28 days started with the administration of temozolomide 75 mg/m2 from day 1-5. About 8 months after mis treatment PEG-ylated liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx®) was administered in 5 cycles of 42 days, with 20 mg/m2 on day 4 and day 14 of the cycle, followed by a week with 160 mg tamoxifen administration in the morning and in the evening. The therapy with these antineoplastic agents according to standard schedules was finally without success and therefore the patient was included into the study with TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 showing surprising success. At the standpoint of this study the magnetic resonance imaging showed three tumors in the left frontal lobe and an additional tumor in the right hemisphere and an overall oedema. After the chemotherapy with the above mentioned antineoplastic agents one cycle of TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 (10 μM in steril pyrogen free isotonic 0.9% NaCl solution, 4 μL/min, total of 1.42 mg in 4 days) was applied intratumorally by an implanted catheter into the largest nodule. Six months after start of TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 a clear reduction of the largest tumot lesion could be diagnosed. Although not individually targeted by the catheter^ the three smaller tumors also disappeared completely. Additionally, the oedema had decreased 17 months after the first application of TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq, Id. No. 30 the largest tumor was hardly measurable anymore. Four months later a complete response was assessed by 3 independent specialists. These findings were accompanied by clinical improvement The patient died due to a myocardial infarction without signs of tumor recurrence and had experienced an overall survival of 195 weeks after first recurrence and 208 weeks after diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma.<br>
2,	Example<br>
Male patient 45 years old was diagnosed with anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade m). The diagnosis was followed by surgery and radiotherapy. 3 times 200 mg/m2 Temozolomide was administered according to a standard schedule during two months. Again this therapy was without success. Therefore the patient was included into me study with TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30. Two cycles of this oligonucleotide with a concentration of 80 ΜM and a flow of 8 μl/rnin was administered for each 4 days through a catheter placed inside the tumor tissue. Afterwards the patient received ten additional cycles within four months. Following the last cycle of the oligonucleotide, approximately 10 months after the first oligonucleotide treatment, the patient received seven cycles of liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx8'). A planned 8th cycle could not be started, as the chemotherapy had to be discontinued due to cardiotoxicity (ventricular tachycardia). From that time the patient did not receive any anti-tamor therapy or corticosteroids. The last magnetic resonance image was taken 19.4 months after the start of oligonucleotide treatment. These images were evaluated and showed in the central reading a significant partial response (83% tumor reduction) and an overall survival time which was not so far reported in literature.<br>
This is a further prove that surprisingly the coadministration of radiotherapy, antineoplastic agents and antagonists clearly show synergistic effects in the treatment of tumors, snch as e.g. glioma, glioblastoma and/or astrocytoma.<br>

Summary of patients* characteristics from the study. Patients 01,13 and 16 received each two cycles of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Caeiyx®), patient 14 two cycles of PCV (procarbazine, lomustine<br><br>
(CCNU), vincristine) after TGF-beta 2 specific antisensc oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 treatment, all other patients had no anti-tumor therapy after oligonucleotide treatment Patient 17 received 10 additional oligonucleotide cycles. After the last cycle of the oligonucleotide the patient received 7 cycles of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.<br>
Reduction of tumor volumes of patients 04 and 17 was more than 80%. Tomor volume was assessed by<br>
measurement of the largest cross-sectional diameter of the enhancing lesion in the first layer and the largest<br>
cross-sectional diameter perpendicular to the first in the same plane and layer. For the third dimension, the<br>
largest cross-sectional diameter of all further planes perpendicular to the first one was determined.<br>
Compared to literature data for the treatment with antineoplastic agents alone the survival data show clearly<br>
enhanced survival of patients treated with one or more antineoplastic agents (e.g. temozolomide and/or<br>
procarbazine) before the administration of TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No.<br>
30.<br>
The data are calculated after start of chemotherapy. According to this approach the median overall survival in<br>
our study was 147 weeks for AA and 42.4 weeks for GBM. The data reveal longer median overall survival<br>
times if applying the oligonucleotide following chemotherapy (mainly temozolomide) man the comparable<br>
published data for temozolomide alone, for which the most recent and accurate survival data are available:<br>
about 147 weeks versus 42 (Theodosopoulos, P.V. et al. 2001) weeks for anaplastic astrocytoma, and 45<br>
weeks versus about 32 weeks (Theodosopoulos, P.V. et al. 2001; Yung, W.K. et al. 2000; Yung, W.K. 2000;<br>
Branctes, AA. et aL 2001) for GBM, respectively.<br>
These results surprisingly show that there is a clear survival advantage of patients treated with a combination<br>
of the antagonist, TGF-beta 2 specific antisense oligonucleotide with Seq. Id. No. 30 and at least one further<br>
antineoplastic agent (e.g. temozolomide) in patients suffering from neoplasm, e.g. AA (mean overall survival<br>
of 146.6 weeks versus 90 weeks for all anaplastic astrocytoma patients).<br>

CeU-mediated cytotoxicity assay.<br>
Cell-mediated cytotoxicity was quantified by the CARE-LASS assay (Lichtenfels et al. 1994) using the KSCLC (non small cell lung carcinoma cell) line NCI-H661, the glioma cell line A-172, and the pancreatic cancer cell line Hup-T3 as target cells. NCI-H661 cells were pretreated with 5 uM TGF (transforming growth factor&gt;beta 1 specific antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (PTO) Seq. Id. No. 14. A-172 and Hup-T3 cells were pretreated with 5 jiM TGF-beta 2 specific antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide Seq. Id. No. 30 in medium at 5% C02 and 37°C for 3 days according to -the cell line suppliers' instructions. Additionally, for Hup-T3 cells 3 ug/ml Lipofectin® were used to enhance cellular uptake of the PTO. Untreated cells and cells treated with 3 ugfrnl Lipofectin® were used as controls. Lymphokine activated killer cells (LAK cells) were used as effector cells. LAK cells were generated by a 3 day pretreatment of 5x106 PBMC from healthy volunteers with 10 ng/ml rh IL-2 (recombinant human interleukin 2) in 4 ml RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 5% C02 and 37°C. One part of the effector cells was incubated additionally with rh TGF-b to mimic the presence of tumor cells (2000 pg/ml rh TGF-bl for NCI-H661, 500 pg/ml rh TGF-b2 for A-172 and Hup-T3). The other part of cells was incubated without additional treatment.<br>
Effector cells were incubated with the target cells with and without cytostatic drugs for 4 h. The supraaditive effect respectively the inhibition was calculated by subtracting the specific cell lysis of the control from the specific cell lysis of the chernothcrapeutic agent. Taking into account the sign this difference is sunfmed up with the specific lysis of the inhibitor of TGF-beta, as depicted in the figures. In case the specific lysis of the combination of a chemotherapeutic agent with the TGF-beta inhibitor was higher than this sum, this was interpreted as supraaditive effect. In case the specific lysis of this combination was smaller than the sum this was interpreted as inhibition.<br>
