				<td>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to copolyetherimides, and more particularly to a new genus of copolyetherimides characterized by such advantageous properties as good ductility, good melt flow properties and high heat resistance.<br>
Polyetherimides are a well-known class of commercially available polymers having excellent chemical resistance, high temperature stability and electrical and mechanical properties. An important subgenus of polyetherimides comprises polymers prepared by the reaction of diamines such as m-phenylenediamine with dianhydrides such as the dianhydride of 2,2-bis[4-(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)phenyl]-propane. As disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 5,229,482, such polyetherimides may also be prepared by the reaction, typically in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, of a bisphenol alkali metal salt with a bis(chlorophthalimide) such as l,3-bis[N-(4-chlorophthalimido)benzene]. The latter method has gained favor in recent years by reason of its relative simplicity (e.g., a minimum number of steps) and high yield.<br>
Various properties of polyetherimides could benefit from improvement. They include melt flow; heat resistance, which is related to heat distortion temperature; and ductility, which can be measured by temperature at which the transition from the brittle to the ductile state occurs.<br>
In White et al., J. Poly. Sci., Poly. Chem. Ed., 19, 1635-1658 (1981), there are disclosed certain polyetherimides prepared from 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether, also designated "ODA" (for 4,4'-oxydianiline). In a particular example, a mixture of the 3,3'-bis(nitrophthalimide) and the 4,4'-bis(nitrophthalimide) derived from ODA underwent reaction with resorcinol disodium salt to yield the corresponding copolyetherimide. There is no disclosure therein, however, of copolyetherimides of ODA and bisphenols or of copolyetherimides derived from 3,4'-bis(nitrophthalimide).<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br><br><br>
A genus of copolyetherimides has been discovered which is characterized by advantageous properties including high melt flow, high heat resistance and good ductility.

Heat distortion temperatures (HDT) of the copolyetherimides of the invention are also higher than those of previously known polymers of this type. In one embodiment the HDT of the copolyetherimides is at least about 205°C; in another embodiment at least about 210°C; and in still another embodiment at least about 215°C, all measured at 0.455 megapascals (mPa).<br><br><br>
Other advantageous properties are also possessed by the copolyctherimides of the invention. They include melt flow properties and ductility comparable to or better than those of commercial polyetherimides, and low polydispersity (Mw/Mn) as compared with homopolyetherimides. In one particular embodiment copolyetherimides of the invention comprising structural units derived from 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether have melt flow properties and ductility comparable to or better than those of commercial polyetherimides, and low polydispersity (Mw/Mn) as compared with homopolyetherimides having a structure corresponding to preparation from 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether and 2,2-bis[4-(2,3-dicarboxyphenoxy)phenyl]-propane dianhydride. Copolyetherimides of the invention have a polydispersity in one embodiment in the range of between about 2.3 and about 3, in another embodiment in the range of between about 2.4 and about 2.8, and in still another embodiment in the range of between about 2.4 and about 2.6. Ductility may be measured as the temperature of transition between ihe brittle and ductile states (from brittle to ductile as the temperature is increased), as shown by the falling dart (Dynatup) impact test (ASTM method D3763), said temperature typically being at most 30°C.<br>

Appropriate amounts of additives may be readily determined without undue experimentation.<br>
Illustrative examples of suitable fillers comprise particulate fillers (for example, fillers having an aspect ratio less than about 3), reinforcing fillers, conductive fillers (e.g., conductive caTbon black, and vapor grown carbon fibers having an average diameter of about 3 to about 500 nanometers). Suitable reinforcing fillers are those which increase the rigidity of the composition. Amongst these, fibrous materials are preferred, in particular glass fibers such as those made from E, A, C, ECR, R, S, D,<br><br><br>
NE glasses and quartz. In some embodiments the fibers comprise low alkali E-glass. Suitable fibers include those with a fiber diameter of from about 8 to about 14 micrometers, the length of the glass fibers in the finished injection molding being from about 0.01 millimeters (mm) to about 0.5 mm. The glass fibers may be employed as rovings or as chopped or milled glass fibers, and may be provided with a suitable finish and an adhesion promoter or promoter system based on silanes. Other fibrous reinforcing materials, e.g. carbon fibers and microfibers, potassium titanate single-crystal fibers, gypsum fibers, aluminum oxide fibers, aluminum silicate fibers, magnesium oxide fibers or asbestos may also be incorporated. The amount of optional reinforcing filler is generally an amount sufficient to increase the rigidity of the composition. The amount of reinforcing fillers is advantageously from about 5% to about 60% by weight, especially from about 10% to about 40% by weight; all based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Non-fibrous fillers, e.g. glass beads, hollow glass beads, chalks, micas, talcs, quartzes and natural or calcined kaolins are further illustrative fillers, as are combinations of these materials with glass fibers. Like the glass fibers, these latter fillers may be provided with a finish and/or an adhesion promoter or adhesion promoter system. Mixtures of fillers may also be employed in compositions of the invention.<br>

Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the description herein, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent. The following examples are included to provide additional guidance to those skilled in the an in practicing the claimed invention. The examples provided are merely representative of the work that contributes to the teaching of the present application. Accordingly, these, examples are not intended to limit the invention, as defined in the appended claim's, in any manner. All parts, percentages and ratios are by weight. Glass transition temperatures (Tg) were measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) carried out on a Perkin Elmer DSC-7 instrument, using the data from the 2nd<br><br>
heat with a program going from 50°C 10 300°C at 20°C per minute heating rate under nitrogen.<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
A mixture of 3,3'-, 3,4'- and 4,4'-dichloro[N-phthalimidopheny)] ethers was prepared by reaction of 4,4'-diaminodipheny] ether with a mixture of 3-and 4-chloro-phthalic anhydrides. The resulting mixture of ethers had a ratio of 3-linkage to 4-linkage of about 3:1. A solution in o-dichlorobenzene of 13,442 parts of the mixture of ethers and 947.2 parts of a corresponding monochlorophthalimide mixture was distilled with removal of water until less than 15 ppm of water was present. A slurry of 7,102 parts of bisphenol A disodium salt in o-dichlorobenzene was added, this amount being calculated to be some 3% short of the stoichiometric amount. Distillation was continued until less than 10 ppm of water was present and 41,680 parts of o-dichlorobenzene remained, corresponding to a 30% level of copolyetherimide in solvent.<br>
A 20% solution of hexaethylguanidinium chloride in o-dichlorobenzene (314 parts) was added portionwise, with 50% being added initially and two 25% portions after 1.5 and 30 minutes. An exothermic reaction caused the mixture to heat again to reflux temperature. Refluxing was continued with addition of further small portions of bisphenol A disodium salt slurry until the weight average molecular weight (Mw) was 46,700. The reaction was then quenched with phosphoric acid and the mixture was cooled, diluted with o-dichlorobenzene to 10% solids and washed with water. After isolation by antisolvent precipitation, the resulting copolyetherimide had a Mw of 45,500 and a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 18,500.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The procedure of Example I was repeated, using 14,422 parts of the mixture of ethers, 473.5 parts of monochlorophthalimides from the same monomers and 7,321 parts of bisphenol A disodium salt. The resulting copolyetherimide had a Mw of 62,400 and a Mn of 24,200.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br><br><br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, using 13,767 parts of a mixture of 3,3'-and 3,4'-disubstituted [N-phthalimidophenyl] ethers with a ratio of 3-linkage to 4-linkage of about 98:2, 643 parts of monochlorophthalimides from the same monomers and 7,070 parts of bisphenol A disodium salt. The resulting copolyetherimide had a Mw of 54,100 and a Mn of 20,800.<br>
The properties of the products of Examples 1, 2 and 3 are listed in the following table. Also included in the table are the properties of Controls 1 and 2 which were commercially available polyetherimides having a structure corresponding to preparation from bisphenol A disodium salt and a mixture of 4 parts m-bis(3-chloro-N-phthalimido)benzene and 96 parts m-bis(4-chloro-N-phthalimido)benzene. Viscosity values (Η) were determined at 380°C, and 1000 s-1<br>
TABLE 1<br><br><br>
(Table Removed) <br><br>
Several things will be apparent upon examining the data in the table. First, the glass transition temperatures of the copolyetherimides of the invention are all above 225°C and are substantially higher than those of commercial polyetherimides (Controls 1 and 2). Second, the molecular weights (both Mw and Mn) of the copolyetherimides of the invention are comparable to, and the heat distortion temperatures and ductilities (as indicated by lzod impact strength and brittle-ductile transition) are greater than, those of said commercial polyetherimides.<br>
With respect to melt flow, attention is directed to the viscosity (r)) values which are generally a good measure thereof. The product of Example 1, having a molecular weight substantially greater than that of Control 2, has a similar melt flow. The same is true of the product of Example 2 and Control 1. The combination of improved flow along with increased Tg and ductility in copolyetherimides of the invention is unexpected. In various embodiments copolyetherimides of the invention tend to have a viscosity value less than or approximately equal to the viscosity of a polyetherimide of comparable molecular weight derived from bisphenol. A disodium salt and a 4:96 ratio of m-bis[3- and 4-chloro-N-(phthalimido)benzenes, said viscosity determined at 380°C and 1000 s-1 . In the present context comparable molecular weight means molecular weights which differ by no more than about 15% and usually by no more than about 10%.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A polyetherimide is prepared from a mixture of 3,3'-dichIoro- [N-phthalimidophenyl] ether and either 4-[N-(4-chlorophthalimido)phenyl]-4'-[N-phthalimidophenyl] ether or 4-[N-(3-ch)orophthalimido)phenyl]-4,-[N-phthalimidophenyl] ether or a mixture thereof using the method essentially as described in Example 1. The properties of the polyetherimide are similar to those obtained for the copolyetherimide'of Example 3.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br><br><br>
Polyetherimides were prepared comprising structural units derived from the following dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons and diamines: hydroquinone (HQ), 4,4'-biphenol (BP), bisphenol A (BPA); meta-phenylenediamine (MPD), 2,4-toluenediamine (TDA), diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), and ODA. Table 2 shows ratio of 3-linkage to 4-linkage, glass transition temperatures, and viscosity values (Η) determined at 380°C, and 1000 s-1 for the polyetherimides wherein the designations 3-linkage and 4-linkage refer to the isomeric positions on the phthalimide ring in the totality of phthalimide-comprising structural units in the polymer.<br>

(Table Removed) <br><br><br><br>
The examples show that the glass transition temperatures of polyetherimides increase as the content of 3-linkage increases regardless of the structural units comprising the polyetherimide.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
A composition comprising the copolyetherimide of Example 3 and 30 wt.% glass fibers was prepared by extrusion and molded into test parts. Glass fibers were grade OC165A-11C from Owens-Corning. A comparative example comprising the copolyetherimide of Example 3 without glass fiber was also prepared and molded. Molded test parts were subjected to ASTM testing protocols. Table 3 shows properties of each composition.<br>
