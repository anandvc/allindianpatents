The present invention relates to a composition capable of killing microbial cells or inhibiting growing microbial cells, i.e. a bactericidal, bacteriostatic, fungicidal and/or fungistatic composition; a cleaning or detergent composition comprising a substance capable of killing microbial cells or inhibiting growing microbial cells; and methods for killing microbial cells present on a hard surface, on skin or in laundry, and for preserving food products, cosmetics etc.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
At this time of increased public interest in reducing the use of chemical additives, it is relevant to consider na¬tural alternatives for antimicrobial agents used e.g. for preserving foods, as disinfectants, and as an antimicro¬bial ingredient of detergent and cleaning compositions. This has increased interest in preservation using live bacterial cultures (Jeppesen &amp; Huss 1993) and enzymes like lactoperoxidase (Farrag &amp; Marth 1992), glucose oxi¬dase (Jeong et al.   1992) and lysozyme (Johansen et al. 1994) .<br>
Protamines are basic proteins with a high arginine con¬tent found in association with DNA of spermatozoon nuclei of fish, birds, mammals etc. (Rodman et al.   1984; Kossel 1928) .  Protamine is used clinically as an antidote to heparin (Jaques 1973) and as a carrier of insulin, pro¬longing the absorption of subcutaneously administered insulin (Brange 1987). Attention has also been paid to the functional properties of protamine as a stabilizing agent (Phillips et al.   1989).  Protamine has been shown to have an antibacterial effect (Hitsch 1958), but this<br><br>
.)(<br><br>
aspect has not been thoroughly studied.<br>
The Gram-negative bacteria are often resistant to a large number of harmful agents due to the effective permeabili¬ty barrier function of the outer membrane (Nakae 1985). However, protamine and most other cationic peptides are under certain conditions apparently able to traverse the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (Vaara 1992, Vaara &amp; Vaara 1983), probably as a result of their bin¬ding to the anionic lipopolysaccharide-covered surface of the Gram-negative cell.  The mechanism of the antibac¬terial action of basic peptides is not known, but it has been suggested that they form a channel in the cytoplas¬mic membrane, thus uncoupling electron transport and cau¬sing leakage (Christensen et al.   1988; Hugo 1978; Kagan et al.   1990).  It has also been proposed that they induce autolysis due to activation of the autolytic enzymes (Bi-erbaum &amp; Sahl 1991).<br>
In general, the occurrence of highly-basic peptides such as protamine is relatively rare in nature. However, of those studied, several have been found to demonstrate antibacterial properties: eg. nisin (Sahl 1987), defensin (Lehrer et al.   1993), cecropins (Christensen et al. 1988), Pep5 (Bierbaum &amp; Sahl 1987) and melittins (Vaara 1992) .<br>
Antibacterial activity is usually measured as a decrease in colony counts, a decrease in the absorbance of a bac¬terial suspension or as inhibition zones on agar plates (Trevors 1986). However, these methods may not be suit¬able when assaying the antibacterial effect of a basic peptide or protein such as protamine due to the aggluti¬nation of the positively-charged protamine and the nega¬tively-charged bacterial cells as described by Islam et al.   (1984).<br><br>
Thus, the object of invention was to provide an antibac¬terial and/or antifungicidal composition comprising a natural active compound or substance, i.e. which is non¬toxic, of biological origin, easily available and rela¬tively inexpensive, optionally in combination with other antimicrobial compounds or substances.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that it is possible to kdJ.1 microbial cells or inhibit growing microbial cells /by means of a basic protein or peptide of biological ori¬gin, e.g. protamine or protamine sulphate. For certain bacteria or fungi, it may be necessary to combine the basic protein with a cell-wall degrading enzyme or an oxidoreductase in order to obtain the desired antimicro¬bial effect.<br>
Accordingly, the growth inhibitory effect of protamine and the potential lethal effect of this basic protein on non-growing cells has been investigated. Due to the methodological shortcomings described above, impedimetric measurements were used and compared to traditional plate counts (Firstenberg-Eden &amp; Eden 1984; Connolly et al. 1993) .<br>
Thus, based these findings the present invention provides a bactericidal, bacteriostatic, fungicidal and/or fun¬gistatic composition comprising a basic protein or pep¬tide capable of killing microbial cells in combination with a cell-wall degrading enzyme or an oxidoreductase.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a detergent or cleaning composition comprising a basic pro¬tein or peptide capable of killing microbial cells and a surfactant. Such compositions have a pH in the alkaline<br><br>
range and it has been found that basic proteins such as protamine and protamine sulphate exhibit their optimum antimicrobial effect at alkaline pH, thus making such proteins very suitable for incorporation in compositions for cleaning purposes.<br>
The composition of the invention is useful as antimicro¬bial ingredient wherever such an ingredient is needed, for example for the preservation of food, beverages, cos¬metics, contact lens products, food ingredients or enzyme compositions; as a disinfectant for use e.g. on human or animal skin, mucous membranes, wounds, bruises or in the eye; for killing microbial cells in laundry; and for incorporation in cleaning compositions for hard surface cleaning.<br>

Preferred basic proteins to be used in the compositions of the present invention are protamines, protamine sul¬phates, defensins, magainins, melittin, cecropins and protegrins; more preferably protamines and protamine sul¬phates .<br>
Hitherto it has been known that protamine from salmon has a bactericidal effect on growing Gram-positive bacteria (1000 jug/ml) . Islam et al.   (1984) found that it inhibited growth but did not determine whether the effect was bactericidal or bacteriostatic. Other studies have reported that protamine is not effective against Gram-negative bacteria (Islam et al.   1984; Yanagimoto et al. 1992). Contrary to this observation, it has now been found that protamine is effective against Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. The same applies for protamine sulphate.<br>
It has been suggested the primary antibacterial effect of many of the basic peptides is their ability to penetrate the cytoplasmatic membrane, disrupting the electron transport and induce leakage of intracellular compounds. Without being bound to this theory, this mechanism may explain in part the effect of protamine on some of the strains tested in the experiments described in the Examples below.<br><br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a :;leaning or detergent composition comprising a basic pro¬tein or peptide capable of killing microbial cells and a surfactant.<br>
rhe detergent or cleaning composition may further com¬prise other enzymes conventionally used in detergent or cleaning compositions.

The surfactant of the detergent or cleaning composition is preferably a detergent surfactant, more preferably a detergent surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, ampholytic, zwitterionic and catio-nic surfactants.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the detergent or cleaning composition comprises as the basic protein a protamine or a protamine sulphate in an amount effective for killing cells or inhibiting growth of cells, preferably in an amount corresponding to between 1 and 4000 /xg per ml cle¬aning liquor or washing liquor, more preferably between 1 and 2 000 fig  per ml cleaning liquor or washing liquor, especially between 5 and 1000 jug per ml cleaning liquor or washing liquor.<br>

Thus, the compositions of the invention and/or the basic peptides or proteins used in these com¬positions, especially protamines and protamine sulphates, may by useful as disinfectants, e.g in the treatment of acne, infections in the eye, skin infections; in antiperspirants; for cleaning end disinfection of contact lenses etc.<br><br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of protamine<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
BACTERIA, INOCULUM, MEDIA AND REAGENTS<br>
The bacteria used in the study are listed in Table 1 be¬low. Stock cultures were maintained in Tryptone Soy Broth (TSB)(Oxoid CM129) with 0.5% glucose, 2% skimmed milk powder, 4% glycerol and stored at -SCC.<br>
Cells from the stock culture were streaked on TSB plates (TSB with 1.2% agar) and incubated 48 h at 25°C. One co¬lony of bacteria was inoculated in 5 ml of TSB and grown 24-36 h at 25°C. This culture was used as inoculum.<br>
TSB with 1.2% agar was used for plate counts which were done by surface inoculation and incubation of the plates at 25°C. Ten-fold dilution rates were prepared using sterile peptone saline (0.1% peptone, 0.85% NaCl).<br>
Protamine from Salmon (P-4005) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, USA), dissolved in distilled water, filter sterilized (0.2 nm)   and used immediately after preparation.<br><br><br><br>

IMPEDANCE DETERMINATIONS<br>
Volumes (1.0 ml) of TSB medium were added to Bactometer® wells. Protamine solutions (0.1 ml) were transferred to the wells which were sealed, connected to the Bactometer B123-2 (bioM^rieux UK ltd., UK) and incubated at 25°C until a significant detectable increase in the electrical conductivity of the medium was registered and the detec¬tion time (DT) was recorded (maximum 100 h).  Detection usually occurs when the cell concentration reaches 10*^-10' cfu/ml.  For the Gram-positive strains the capacitance signal was monitored, while change in conductance was used for Gram-negative strains.<br>
EFFECT OF PROTAMINE ON GROWING CELLS<br>
The antibacterial activity of protamine on growing cells was measured in the Bactometer modules. The wells (con¬taining 1 ml TSB and 0.1 ml protamine solution) were ino¬culated with 0.1 ml from a 10"^ dilution of an inoculum culture, giving a final cell concentration in the well of approximately 10^ cfu/ml.  The concentration of protamine varied from 1 to 4000 /xg/ml depending on the sensitivity<br><br>
of the strain investigated.<br>
Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration of protamine resulting in absen¬ce of a DT.<br>
When no DT was measured, the lethal/inhibitory effect on the cells were tested by plating the total well volume.<br>
EFFECT OF PROTAMINE ON NON-GROWING CELLS<br>
1 ml of inoculum diluted to 10'^ was inoculated in 250 ml TSB (approximately 10^ cfu/ml) and incubated at 25°C for 24 h.  Cells were harvested by centrifugation (2000*g for 10 min), washed twice with 0.067 M sterile sodium phosp¬hate buffer pH 7.0 (Weisner 1984) and resuspended in the same buffer. The absorbance at 450 nm (OD450) of the bac¬terial suspension was adjusted to 1.0 (approximately 10* cfu/ml), measured on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 2 spectropho¬tometer (tJberlingen, Germany) . The cell suspension was diluted in sterile phosphate buffer to concentrations of 10* and 10^ cfu/ml. Protamine was added to the cell su¬spensions (10^, 10* and 10* cfu/ml) in concentrations of 0, 50, 100 and 500 jug/ml, and the suspensions were incu¬bated at 25°C for 24 h.<br>
CALIBRATION CURVES<br>
A series 10-fold dilution rate was prepared from the 10* cfu/ml suspension with no protamine added. A calibration curve relating cfu/ml of the 10-fold dilutions to capaci¬tance or conductance DT in TSB was constructed for each strain using a minimum of 8 dilution steps.<br>
From the protamine treated suspensions, 0.1 ml was ino¬culated in TSB in Bactometer wells and the DT determined. This DT was, converted to a colony count using the call-<br><br>
bration curve. Thus, colony counts were not made directly on the protamine treated suspensions as protamine caused significant clumping of the bacterial cells.<br>
When no DT was measured, the total well volume was pi¬petted onto agar plates to evaluate whether protamine had a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect.<br>
Results<br>
The MIC values determined from capacitance or conductance DT of cells growing in TSB are shown in Table 2.<br>

Gram-negative strains.<br>
Brochotrix thermosphacta  was the most sensitive strain, and a protamine concentration of 20 )ug/ml TSB caused a total kill of the inoculum (10^ cfu/ml) , measured by pla¬ting the well volume after 100 h of incubation in the Bactometer.  A protamine concentration of 1000 /ug/ml re¬sulted in a 100% lethal effect on the two strains of Li¬steria monocytogenes  and Staphylococcus aureus   (10^ cfu/ml). The MIC for protamine on S. aureus  was 500 )Lig/ml, however, this concentration did not have a lethal effect.<br>
The DT's for Aeromonas sobria  and Yersinia enterocolitica increased with increasing protamine concentration, sug¬gesting a prolonged lagphase. However, the cultures were not totally inhibited and no MIC was determined.  The DT for a 10^ cfu/ml suspension of A. sobria  was 33 h when incubated with 4000 ixq/ml  compared to 12 h when no pro¬tamine was added. For Y.   enterocolitica  the detection time of 10^ cfu/ml was prolonged from 21 h to 60 h when 4000 jLtg/ml of protamine was added, see Figure 1. Aeromo¬nas salmonicidae  and Pseudomonas fluorescens  were inhibi¬ted by protamine in concentrations of 4000 and 3000 jug/ml TSB, respectively. Thus, no change in conductance was seen after 100 hours incubation, but live cells were iso¬lated from the well. Shewanella putrefaciens   (A2), (All) and (A22) and VlJbrlo anguillarum  were inhibited by pro¬tamine in the concentration 1000 jug/ml TSB, and ViJbrio paraheamolyticus  and S.  putrefaciens   (A6) were inhibited by 500 jug/ml TSB. S.  putrefaciens  was the only Gram-nega¬tive bacteria which was killed by protamine, thus, 2000 /ig/ml of protamine killed 100% of the inoculum (lo' cfu/ml) of all the four tested strains.<br>
The bactericidal effect of protamine on non-growing cells was tested on four strains of S.  putrefaciens  and two<br><br>
strains of L.  monocytogenes.  After protamine treatment, detection times were measured and converted to a cell count using the calibration curve generated for the particular strain (Fig. 2). The sensitivity of S.  putre¬faciens  varied from strain to strain, see Table 3 below (see also table 1 for code and reference for each strain). Strain A2 and All were similar in sensitivity and more resistant than A6 and A22.  Thus, 100 ng protamine/ml killed S. putrefaciens  strain A6 and A22 when suspended at low cell concentrations (10* and 10^ cfu/ml). The same level was not 100% lethal on S. putrefaciens  strain A2 and All, however the cell number was reduced by 90-99.9%.<br>
The initial cell number was estimated by absorbance measurements.<br><br><br><br>
k:  No surviving cells (determined by spread plating<br>
the medium from the well, c): Long detection time (DT) corresponding to a very<br>
low cell number (approximately 1 surviving<br>
cell).<br>
Protamine at 100 and 500 jug/ml had no effect on non-growing L.  monocytogenes  cells, and increasing the pro¬tamine concentration to 1000 /xg/ml did not cause any let¬hal effect of protamine on non-growing L.  monocytogenes.<br>
The results show that salmine (salmon protamine) in con¬centrations of 100-4000 /ig/ml prolonged the lag phase of several Gram-negative bacteria significantly. Protamine was more effective on actively growing L.   monocytogenes cells as compared to cells suspended in buffer. The bac¬tericidal effect of protamine on Shewanella putrefaciens was seen on both growing and non-growing cells.  A pro¬tamine concentration of 2000 /ig/ml was required to kill growing S.  putrefaciens   (10^ cfu/ml), whereas non-growing cells were killed by only 50 /xg/ml.  When the cell con¬centration was raised the bactericidal effect of protami¬ne was decreased, probably as a result of the higher cell/protamine ratio.<br>
The impedimetric method used in this study proved useful for the measurement of the antibacterial activity of a cationic protein which caused cellular agglutination. Excellent correlations exit between detection time and cfu of untreated cells, see Figure 2. The correlation between protamine treated cells and cfu was statistically similar to the correlation for untreated cells (data not shown), however, plating the protamine treated cells cau¬sed a great degree of variation on the cells count. It is demonstrated that protamine inhibits growth of all the tested strains, determined as a prolonged lag phase<br><br>
for the most resistant bacteria or a lethal effect on a few of the tested strains, the Gram-positive bacteria in particular. The fact that protamine is naturally occur¬ring and non-toxic makes it an antibacterial protein that might hold great promise for the control of e.g. spoilage bacteria and food-borne pathogens.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Comparison of minimum inhibition concentrations for basic proteins and enzymes<br>
The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of various substances was determined as described in Example 1.<br>
The following substances were tested: protamine (A), pro¬tamine sulphate (B), a peroxidase enzyme system (i.e. lactoperoxidase/glucoseoxidase (C)), subtilisin A (D), polyarginine (E) having an average molecular weight of about 6 kD and lysozyme (F) (150 000 units/mg; Johansen, C. et al., 1994). The results are shown in Table 4 below.<br>
It is demonstrated that protamine and protamine sulphate are very effective substances for inhibiting all the te¬sted strains, whereas polyarginine is effective for in¬hibiting all strains but Pseudomonas spp..   Apart from the effect of lysozyme on Listeria monocytogenes,   none of the tested enzyme showed any effect.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
The influence of pH and cell concentration on the anti¬bacterial effect of protamine<br>
The influence of pH on the antibacterial effect of pro¬tamine was tested using the materials and methods descri-<br><br>
bed in Example 1.<br>
The results are shown in Figure 3 and demonstrate clearly that the antibacterial effect of protamine depend signi¬ficantly on pH. At low pH, protamine (1 mg/ml) has no ef¬fect on the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa,   however, at high pH protamine (1 mg/ml) pro¬longed the detection time from 32 to 71 hours. The inter¬action between pH and protamine has been observed for all the tested strains.<br>
Further, the influence of cell concentration on the anti¬bacterial effect of protamine was tested using the ma¬terials and methods described in Example 1, i.e.the cor¬relation between cell concentration and protamine concen¬tration has been measured by the impedimetric assay.<br>
The results are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 and demon¬strate clearly that a significant synergistic effect bet¬ween the cell concentration and the protamine concentra¬tion has been observed. Thus, at low cell concentration, protamine (1 mg/ml) caused a prolongation of the detection time from 12 to above 100 hours for the Gram-negative bacteria Shewanella putrefaciens   (4 strains), compared to a prolongation at high cell concentration from 6 to 18 hours.  The detection time for the Gram-po¬sitive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes   (2 strains) was at low cell concentration prolonged from 18 to 55 hours when treated with protamine (1 mg/ml), at high cell concentra¬tion the same protamine concentration only prolonged the detection time from 4 to 15 hours.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Synergistic antimicrobial effect between a basic protein, a cell-wall degrading enzyme and a peroxidase enzyme system<br>
Impedimetric measurements carried out as described in example 1 have shown an synergistic effect between basic peptides as protamine, polyarginine or polylysine and lysozyme and/or glucose oxidase and/or the lactoperoxidase enzyme system depending on pH and NaCl concentration.<br>
Growth inhibition experiments were conducted, wherein synergistic and additional effects were determined by mixing compounds in low concentrations not having any activity on their own and using a factorial design.  The effects were measured as growth inhibition or a 100% bactericidal effect with a total kill of the inoculum.<br>
Protamine (250 jug/ml) or poly lysine (500 /xg/ml) in combi¬nation with lactoperoxidase (2 U/ml) and glucose oxidase (2 U/ml) had a 100% lethal effect on Pseudomonas fluorescens,  whereas the same strain was not inhibited when treated with any of these three compounds alone in the concentrations mentioned above.<br>
A synergistic effect was as observed against Pseudomonas fluorescens  when combining protamine (250 ng/mil)   and poly lysine (500 /xg/ml) and lysozyme (50000 U/ml) and lactoperoxidase (2 U/ml) and glucose oxidase (1 U/ml) or lysozyme (50.000 U/ml) and poly lysine (500 jig/ml)   and lactoperoxidase (2 U/ml) and glucose oxidase (1 U/ml).<br>
Experiments where the antibacterial effect was measured as growth inhibition of Shewanella putrefaciens  in TSB at<br><br>
25 00 and pH 7.2, showed a synergistic effect between protamine and lysozyme; the results are shown in Figure 6 as a response surface plot. Lysozyme alone had no effect on the Gram-negative bacteria Shewanella putrefaciens neither had protamine at concentrations below 500 jug/ml, whereas combinations caused a 100% bactericidal activity at protamine concentrations above 300 /xg/ml and lysozyme concentrations from iC-lO* U/ml (lysozyme activity: 150000 U/mg).<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Fungistatic and fungicidal activities<br>
This experiment was carried out as described in example 1 using the Bactometer substrate: 0.75 g Yeast extract (Difco) , 3.0 g D(+)Glucose, 1 g KH2PO4, 0.8 g isogel agarose lEF (Pharmacia) and 100 ml distilled water.<br>
Protamine was added to the substrate immediately before inoculation with a spore suspension of the test fungi (approximately lO^-lO* cfu/ml) .<br>
The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined as the lowest concentration of protamine resulting in a absence of DT during 100 h measurement (see table 5 below).  When no DT was determined a fungicidal activity was evaluated by plating from a dilution of the total well volume.<br><br>

The fungistatic and fungicidal effect of protamine was optimal at high pH and low inoculum size as the effect on bacteria. Increasing the pH caused a significant decrease in the MIC-value. A fungistatic effect was obtained with an 2-5 fold lower protamine concentration than used when a fungicidal effect was determined. The most resistant strains shown in table 5 were not inhibited by protamine for 100 h at low pH, thus a 100 h inhibition was not obtained before increasing the pH to the values given in the table.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Survival and transfer of bacteria during mini-wash<br>
Materials:<br>
Ariel Color (DF-9412330).<br>
Swatches (white cotton, DF-9415585), sterilized by<br><br>
autoclaving.<br>
Tryptone Soya Broth (TSB).<br>
Sterilized water (12°dH).<br>
Strains:<br>
Staphylococcus aureus   (skin isolate)<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa   (skin isolate)<br>
Methods:<br>
Inoculum:<br>
S.  aureus  and P.  aeruginosa  were grown in Tryptone Soya Broth (TSB) at 25'C for 30 hours. For each strain six sterile swatches were inoculated with approximately 10* cfu/swatch and air dried for 30 minutes.<br>
Mini-wash:<br>
0.56 g of Ariel Color was dissolved in 80 ml sterile water (12"dH, 35°C) in each wash beaker, giving the final concentration of 7 g/1. Protamine, dissolved in water and filter sterilized, were added to half of the wash beakers giving the final concentration of 500 jLtg/ml.<br>
After 70 sec. 1 inoculated swatch and 2 sterile swatches were transferred to each wash beaker, and washed at 35°C for 15 min. In one beaker 3 sterile swatches were washed as control.<br>
From each wash beaker 0.1 ml of detergent solution were transferred to Malthus (in-direct cells) con¬taining TSB and incubated.<br>
The swatches were rinsed in sterile water for 10 min (stirring). From each beaker 0.1 ml of rinse water<br><br>
were incubated in Malthus (in-direct cells).<br>
After wash all swatches were slightly air dried in sterile air for 10 min, and each swatch was trans¬ferred to an in-direct Malthus cell.<br>
All materials and instruments except the detergent, were sterilized before use to avoid contamination.<br>
In-direct Malthus:<br>
Indirect-Malthus measurements were used when estimat¬ing the number of viable cells.<br>
3 ml of TSB were transferred to the outer chamber of the in-direct Malthus cells, and 0.5 ml of sterile KOH (0.1 M) were transferred to the inner chamber. As cells are growing in the outer chamber they produce CO2 (g) which will dissolve in the KOH in the inner chamber and thereby change the conductance of the KOH. When the conductance change is measurable by the Malthus, a detection time (DT) will be recorded. The DT's were converted to colony counts by use of a calibration curve relating cfu/ml to DT (see Figure 1 and 2).<br>
A series 10-fold dilution rate was prepared from the 10* cfu/ml suspension of cells. Conductance DT of each dilution step was determined in TSB, and a cali¬bration curve relating cfu/ml of the 10 fold dilu¬tions to DT in TSB was constructed for each strain (see Figure 1 and 2).<br>
Results:<br>
The number of cells surviving mini-wash, in the detergent solution, attached to the contaminated swatches, trans¬ferred to the rinse water or to the sterile swatches, were determined by in-direct Malthus (table 6).<br><br>
A relatively high number of cells were washed of the swatches and found in the wash water, however, approxima¬tely 10^ cfu were still attached to the swatches after mini-wash and rinsing for 10 min, and during wash cells were transferred from the contaminated swatch to the sterile swatches. The S.  aureus  cells were found very sensitive to protamine, which can be explained by the increased antibacterial activity of protamine at high pH. A high number of P.   aeruginosa  were determined in the detergent solution, and protamine was found active against the cells in the detergent solution, however, P. aeruginosa  attached to the swatches were not inhibited or killed by protamine, and all the sterile swatches in the washes inoculated with P. aeruginosa  were contaminated during wash.<br>
The rinse water were almost sterile, thus the cells may adhere actively to the textile.<br>

From the results it can be concluded that Ariel Color has no significant bactericidal effect on S. aureus  and P. aeruginosa   (pathogenic skin isolates).<br>
A high number of cells were washed of the swatches, and found in the detergent solution, and when no protamine were added, cells from the inoculated swatch contaminated the sterile swatches in the wash beaker.<br><br>
