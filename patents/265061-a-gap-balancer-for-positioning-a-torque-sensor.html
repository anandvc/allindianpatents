SENSOR GAP BALANCER<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to sensors, and more particularly<br>
to a gap balancer for a sensor.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0003] It is often desirable to determine the torque on a rotating shaft<br>
(rotator) relative to a stationary component (stator). A typical application that<br>
includes a rotator and a stator is an automatic transmission.<br>
[0004] In order to determine the torque being applied to the rotator, a<br>
torque sensor is used to measure the torque. Common torque sensors include<br>
strain gages, magnetic or optical sensors, and surface acoustic wave (SAW)<br>
sensors. These torque sensors each measure various parameters such as local<br>
strain, angular displacement, or strained-induced change on an acoustic wave.<br>
Typically these torque sensors have two components including what can<br>
generally be referred to as a transmitter and a receiver. The receiver is typically<br>
coupled to the rotator and the transmitter is coupled to the stator. In the case of<br>
magnetic sensors and SAW sensors, a current is induced through the transmitter<br>
and torque applied on the rotator is transmitted back to the transmitter in a form<br>
1<br><br>
Docket No. GP-308939-PTT-DLT<br>
of current, radio signal or magnetic field which is then converted into an<br>
estimated torque. One crucial element to determining the amount of torque using<br>
these sensors is knowing and controlling the gap distance between the<br>
transmitter and receiver.<br>
[0005] Accordingly, one limitation of the above described torque<br>
sensors is that any discrepancy in the expected gap distance used in calculating<br>
the torque from the actual gap distance between the receiver and the transmitter<br>
can increase the margin of error in the torque calculation. Because the system<br>
tolerances between the rotator and the stator are often not precisely known, at<br>
best the expected gap distance will be an estimate. Therefore, there is room in<br>
the art to provide a device that reduces the error between the expected gap<br>
distance and the actual gap distance.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] The present invention provides an assembly for positioning a<br>
torque sensor having a receiver and a transmitter.<br>
[0007] In a first aspect of the present invention, the assembly includes<br>
a first annular member, wherein the receiver is coupled to the first annular<br>

the second annular member, the bearing assembly includes a first race formed to<br>
the first annular member, a second race formed to the second annular member,<br>

the first race and the second race to rotate relative to one another. A radially<br>
extending member is coupled to the second race. The receiver is radially<br>
displaced from the bearing assembly and the transmitter is mounted to a<br>
mounting surface of the radially extending member opposite the receiver at a<br>
predefined axial distance.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0037] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0038] FIG. 1 illustrates a gap balancer 10 designed according to the<br>
principles of the present invention. The gap balancer 10 includes a bearing<br>
assembly 12 coupled with an extending member 14. The extending member 14<br>
extends radially outward from the bearing assembly 12. The gap balancer 10 is<br>
annularly shaped and defines a bore 16.<br>
[0039] Turning to FIG. 2, the gap balancer 10 is illustrated in use with<br>
an exemplary first annular component 18 and an exemplary second annular<br>
component 20. The first annular component 18 includes an axial portion 22 with<br>
a radially extending portion 24 extending therefrom. The radially extending<br>
portion 24 includes a first surface 26. The second annular component 20<br>
includes a second surface 28. The first annular component 18 is disposed<br>
proximate to the second annular component 20 such that the first surface 26 is<br>
opposite the second surface 28. The radially extending portion 24 of the first<br>
component 18 and the second component 20 define a gap 30. The gap balancer<br>
10 is disposed between the first annular component 18 and the second annular<br>
component 20 within the gap 30. The axially extending portion 22 of the first<br>
annular component 18 extends through the bore 16 of the gap balancer 10. In<br>
7<br><br>
Docket No. GP-308939-PTT-DLT<br>
the preferred embodiment, the first annular component 18 is a rotatable shaft and<br>
the second annular component 20 is a fixed housing. However, it should be<br>
appreciated that either the first annular component 18 or second annular<br>
component 20 may be fixed or rotatable with respect to one another.<br>
[0040] The bearing assembly 12 of the gap balancer 10 includes a first<br>
race 32 disposed opposite a second race 34 and at least one bearing element 36<br>
disposed between the first race 32 and the second race 34. The first race 32 is<br>
formed to the first surface 26 of the first annular component 18. The second race<br>
34 is formed to the second surface 28 of the second annular component 20. The<br>
first race 32 includes a first arm 38 that extends in an axial direction towards the<br>
second race 34. In turn, the second race 34 includes a second arm 40 that<br>
extends in an axial direction towards the first race 32. The first arm 38 is<br>
positioned radially inward relative to the second arm 40. The first race 32, the<br>
first arm 38, the second race 34, and the second arm 40 all cooperate to form a<br>
bearing cage for the bearing element 36.<br>
[0041] As noted above, the bearing element 36 is disposed between<br>
the first race 32 and the second race 34. In the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the bearing element 36 is a roller, however it should be<br>
appreciated that various other bearings may be employed, such as, for example,<br>
a ball. A plurality of bearing elements 36 may be disposed within the bearing<br>
assembly 12. The bearing element 36 allows the first race 32 and the second<br>
race 34 to move relative to one another, which in turn allows the first annular<br>
8<br><br>
Docket No. GP-308939-PTT-DLT<br>
component 18 and the second annular component 20 to move relative to one<br>
another.<br>
[0042] The extending member 14 of the gap balancer 10 includes a<br>
radial segment 44, an axial segment 46, and a mounting flange 48. The radial<br>
segment 44 is coupled to an end of the second arm 40 of the second race 34 of<br>
the bearing assembly 12. The radial segment 44 extends radially outward from<br>
the bearing assembly 12 and is annular in shape. The axial segment 46 is<br>
coupled to the radial segment 44. The mounting flange 48 is coupled to the axial<br>
segment 46 and extends radially outward. The mounting flange 48 includes a<br>
mounting surface 50. The second arm 40 of the second race 34, the radial<br>
segment 44, and the axial segment 46 all cooperate to define an annular groove<br>
52 formed in the gap balancer 10 (see also FIG. 1). The annular groove 52 is<br>
sized to fit overtop a lip 54 formed in the second surface 28 of the second<br>
component 20.<br>
[0043] In order to determine the torque of the first annular component<br>
18 in the example provided, a torque sensor 56 is disposed within the gap 30<br>
between the first annular component 18 and the second annular component 20.<br>
The torque sensor 56 is preferably a SAW sensor, though it should be<br>
appreciated that the torque sensor 56 may take various forms without departing<br>
from the scope of the present invention. The torque sensor 56 includes a<br>
rotating component or receiver 58 and a stationary component or transmitter 60.<br>
The receiver 58 is coupled to the first surface 26 of the first annular component<br>
18 and is radially displaced with respect to the bearing assembly 12 of the gap<br>
9<br><br>
Docket No. GP-308939-PTT-DLT<br>
balancer 10. The transmitter 60 is mounted to the mounting surface 50 of the<br>
extending member 14. The mounting surface 50 of the extending member 14<br>
extends radially outward from the bearing assembly 12 to position the transmitter<br>
60 opposite the receiver 58 at a pre-defined axial distance apart from one<br>
another. This axial distance defines a gap distance "A" as indicated throughout<br>
the figures. The gap distance "A" may be maintained by adjusting the length of<br>
the axial segment 46 of the extending member 14. Torque that is applied to the<br>
first annular component 18 strains the receiver 58. This strain alters the output<br>
(i.e., a magnetic field, an angular displacement, or an acoustic wave, depending<br>
on the type of torque sensor 56 employed) emanating from the receiver 58 such<br>
that the output is indicative of the torque being applied to the first annular<br>
component 18. The transmitter 60 detects this output and using the pre-defined<br>
axial distance between the receiver 58 and the transmitter 60, a controller (not<br>
shown) is able to determine the torque being applied to the first annular<br>
component 18.<br>
[0044] The gap balancer 10 further includes a spring mechanism 62<br>
coupled to the mounting flange 48 on a side opposite the mounting surface 50.<br>
The spring mechanism 62 engages the second surface 28 of the second annular<br>
component 20. The spring mechanism 62 may be a coil spring, spring washer,<br>
thrust washer, or any other spring element known in the art. The spring<br>
mechanism 62 is operable to dampen movement and maintain the gap between<br>
the extending member 14 and the second annular component 20 in order to<br>
assist in stabilizing the transmitter 60.<br>
10<br><br>
Docket No. GP-308939-PTT-DLT<br>
[0045] By mounting the transmitter 60 to the gap balancer 10, the gap<br>
distance "A" may be maintained since any axial movement or float of the first<br>
annular component 18 relative to the second annular component 20 will not<br>
affect the gap distance "A" as the gap balancer 10 is axially stationary with<br>
respect to the first annular component 18. A maintained and known gap distance<br>
"A" in turn makes the torque sensor 56 more accurate in the calculation of the<br>
torque applied to the first annular component 18.<br>
[0046] Turning now to FIG.'s 3 and 4, a second gap balancer 100 is<br>
illustrated together with the first annular component 18, a second annular<br>
component 120, and the torque sensor 56. The second annular component 120<br>
is substantially identical to the annular component 20 illustrated in FIG. 2,<br>
however, the lip 54 is positioned on an opposite side of the gap sensor 100 than<br>
the lip 54 illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
[0047] The second gap balancer 100 includes a bearing assembly 112<br>
and an extending member 114. The bearing assembly 112 includes a first race<br>
132 disposed opposite a second race 134 and at least one bearing element 136<br>
disposed between the first race 132 and the second race 134. The first race 132<br>
is formed to the first surface 26 of the first annular component 18. The second<br>
race 134 is formed to the second surface 128 of the second annular component<br>
120. The first race 132 includes a first arm 138 that extends in an axial direction<br>
towards the second race 134. In turn, the second race 134 includes a second<br>
arm 140 that extends in an axial direction towards the first race 132. The first<br>
arm 138 is positioned radially outward relative to the second arm 140 (opposite<br>
11<br><br>
Docket No. GP-308939-PTT-DLT<br>
to that shown in FIG. 2). The first race 132, the first arm 138, the second race<br>
134, and the second arm 140 all cooperate to form a bearing cage for the<br>
bearing element 136. The bearing element 136 functions in a manner<br>
substantially similar to the bearing element 36 shown in FIG. 2.<br>
[0048] The extending member 114 of the second gap balancer 100<br>
includes a radial segment 144 and a mounting flange 148. The radial segment<br>
144 is coupled to the second race 134. The radial segment 144 extends outward<br>
from the bearing assembly 112 and is annular in shape. The mounting flange<br>
148 is coupled to the radial segment 144 at a curved step down portion 164. The<br>
mounting flange 148 in turn extends radially outward from the radial segment 144<br>
and the curved step down portion 164. The curved step down portion 164 is<br>
preferably formed unitarily with the radial segment 144 and the mounting flange<br>
148.<br>
[0049] The mounting flange 148 includes a curved step down portion<br>
164 at an end thereof. The curved step down portion 164 is coupled to the radial<br>
segment 144 such that the mounting flange 148 extends radially outward. The<br>
mounting flange 148 further includes a mounting surface 150 for receiving the<br>
transmitter 60 thereon.<br>
[0050] The mounting surface 150 of the extending member 114<br>
extends radially outward from the bearing assembly 112 to position the<br>
transmitter 60 opposite the receiver 58 at the gap distance "A". The gap distance<br>
"A" may be modified by adjusting the length of the curved step-down portion 164<br>
of the extending member 114. In this way, the second gap balancer 100<br>
12<br><br>
Docket No. GP-308939-PTT-DLT<br>
provides the same accurate axial distance between the receiver 58 and the<br>
transmitter 60 as the gap balancer 10 provided in FIG. 2.<br>
[0051] The second gap balancer 100 further includes a spring<br>
mechanism 162 coupled to the mounting flange 148 on a side opposite the<br>
mounting surface 150. The spring mechanism 162 engages the second surface<br>
128 of the second annular component 120. The spring mechanism 162 may be<br>
a coil spring, spring washer, thrust washer, or any other spring element known in<br>
the art. The spring mechanism 162 is operable to dampen movement between<br>
the extending member 114 and the second annular component 120 in order to<br>
assist in stabilizing the transmitter 60.<br>
[0052] With reference to FIG.'s 5 and 6, a third gap balancer 200 is<br>
illustrated together with a first annular component 218, a second annular<br>
component 220, and the torque sensor 56. The first annular component 218 is<br>
substantially identical to the first annular component 18 shown in FIG. 2,<br>
however, the first annular component 218 includes a lip 264 formed thereon<br>
proximate to the third gap balancer 200. The second annular component 220 is<br>
substantially identical to the annular component 20 illustrated in FIG. 2, however,<br>
the lip 54 has been removed from the second annular component 220.<br>
[0053] The third gap balancer 200 includes a bearing assembly 212<br>
