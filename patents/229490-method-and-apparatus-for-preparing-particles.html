				<td>Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for forming particles of a target<br>
substance.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
It is known to use a compressed fluid, typically a supercritical or near-critical fluid, as<br>
an anti-solvent to precpitate particles of a substance of interest (a "target substance")<br>
from solution or suspension. The basic technique is known as "GAS" (Gas Anti-<br>
Solvent) precipitation [Gallagher et al, "Supercritical Fluid Science and Technology",<br>
ACS Symp. Ser., 406, p334 (1989)]. Versions of it have been disclosed for instance in<br>
EP-0 322 687 and WO-90/03782.<br>
In one particular version known as SEDS™ (Solution Enhanced Dispersion by<br>
Supercritical fluids), a target substance is dissolved or suspended in an appropriate fluid<br>
vehicle, and the resulting "target solution/suspension" then co-introduced into a particle<br>
formation vessel with an anti-solvent fluid (usually supercritical) in which the vehicle is<br>
soluble. The co-introduction is effected in a particular way, such that:<br>
-	the target solution/suspension and the anti-solvent both meet and enter the<br>
vessel at substantially the same point; and<br>
-	at that point, the mechanical energy of the anti-solvent serves to disperse the<br>
target solution/suspension (ie, to break it up into individual fluid elements) at the same<br>
time as the anti-solvent extracts the vehicle so as to cause particle formation.<br>
Thus, in SEDS™, the compressed fluid serves not only as an anti-solvent but also as a<br>
mechanical dispersing agent. The simultaneity of fluid contact, dispersion and particle<br><br>
formation provides a high degree of control over the physicochemical properties of the<br>
particulate product.<br>
Versions of SEDS™ are described in WO-95/01221, WO-96/00610, WO-98/36825,<br>
WO-99/44733, WO-99/59710, WO-01/03821, WO-01/I5664 and WO-02/38127. Other<br>
SEDS™ processes are described in WO-99/52507, WO-99/52550, WO-00/30612, WO-<br>
00/30613 and WO-00/67892.<br>
Another version of the GAS technique is described in WO-97/31691, in which a special<br>
form of two-fluid nozzle is used to introduce a "target solution/suspension" and an<br>
energising gas into a particle formation vessel containing a supercritical anti-solvent.<br>
The energising gas can be the same as the anti-solvent fluid. Within the nozzle, a<br>
restriction generates sonic waves in the energising gas/anti-solvent flow and focusses<br>
them back (ie, in a direction opposite to that of the energising gas flow) on the outlet of<br>
the target solution/suspension passage, resulting in mixing of the fluids within the<br>
nozzle before they enter the particle formation vessel It is suggested that where the<br>
energising gas is the same as the anti-solvent (typically supercritical carbon dioxide), its<br>
flow rate could be sufficiently high to obtain a sonic velocity at the nozzle outlet.<br>
However, the authors do not appear ever to have achieved such high velocities in their<br>
experimental examples.<br>
Other modifications have been made to the basic GAS process in order to affect<br>
atomisation of the target solution/suspension at the point of its contact with the<br>
compressed fluid anti-solvent. For example, US-5,770,559 describes a GAS<br>
precipitation process m which a target solution is introduced, using a sonicated spray<br>
nozzle, into a pressure vessel containing a supercritical or near-critical anti-solvent fluid<br>
- see also Randolph et al in Biotechnol Prog., 1993,9,429-435.<br>
It would be generally desirable to provide alternative particle formation techniques<br>
which combined one or more of the advantages of the prior art methods with a broader<br>
applicability (for instance, for a wider range of target substances, vehicles and/or anti-<br>
solvents) and/or a higher degree of control over the product characteristics. In particular<br><br>
it is generally desirable, especially for pharmaceutical substances, to be able to produce<br>
small (even sub-micron) particles with narrow size distributions.<br>
Statements of the invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for<br>
preparing a target substance in particulate form, the method comprising introducing into<br>
a particle formation vessel, through separate first and second fluid inlet means<br>
respectively, (a) a solution or suspension of the target substance in a fluid vehicle (the<br>
"target solution/suspension") and (b) a compressed fluid anti-solvent for the substance,<br>
and allowing the anti-solvent fluid to extract the vehicle from the target<br>
solution/suspension so as to form particles of the target substance, wherein the anti-<br>
solvent fluid has a sonic, near-sonic or supersonic velocity as it enters the particle<br>
formation vessel, and wherein the anti-solvent and the target solution/suspension enter<br>
the particle formation vessel at different locations and meet downstream (in the<br>
direction of anti-solvent flow) of the second fluid inlet means.<br>
By "sonic vetocity" and "supersonic velocity" is meant respectively that the velocity of<br>
the anti-solvent fluid as it enters the vessel is the same as or greater than the velocity of<br>
sound in that fluid at that point. By "near-sonic velocity" is meant that the anti-solvent<br>
velocity on entry into the vessel is slightly lower than, but close to, the velocity of<br>
sound in that fluid at that point - for instance its "Mach number" M (the ratio of its<br>
actual speed to the speed of sound) is greater than 0.8, preferably greater than 0.9 or<br>
0.95. Generally speaking, in the method of the invention, the Mach number for the anti-<br>
solvent fluid on entering the particle formation vessel may be between 0.8 and 1.5,<br>
preferably between 0.9 and 1.3.<br>
A near-sonic, sonic or supersonic anti-solvent velocity may be achieved by selecting<br>
appropriate operating conditions, in particular the temperature and pressure of the fluid<br>
as it enters the particle formation vessel, the temperature and pressure within the vessel<br>
(which may be controlled in conventional manner, for instance using an oven and a<br>
back pressure regulator) and the geometry (in particular size) of the inlet through which<br>
the anti-solvent is introduced into the vessel.<br><br>
References in this specification to a fluid entering a vessel are to the fluid exiting an<br>
inlet means (for example, a nozzle) used to introduce the fluid into the vessel. For these<br>
purposes, therefore, the inlet means is to be considered as upstream of the vessel in the<br>
direction of fluid flow, although parts of it (in particular its outlet) may be located<br>
physically within the vessel.<br>
There needs to be a drop in pressure as the anti-solvent fluid enters the particle<br>
formation vessel. This is typically achieved by imparting a relatively high "back<br>
pressure' to the anti-solvent (by using a high anti-solvent flow rate and forcing it<br>
through a restriction such as a nozzle) and maintaining the vessel at a significantly<br>
lower pressure.<br>
However, this pressure reduction can cause undesirable Joule-Thomson cooling of the<br>
anti-solvent. Accordingly, the temperature of the anti-solvent upstream of the particle<br>
formation vessel needs to be sufficiently high that the fluid remains at an appropriate<br>
temperature (typically above its critical temperature Tc), even after expanding into the<br>
particle formation vessel. The method of the invention thus preferably includes pre-<br>
heating the anti-solvent fluid, upstream of the particle formation vessel, to a temperature<br>
such as to compensate for its Joule-Thomson cooling as it enters the vessel<br>
Thus, the first aspect of the present invention may be seen as a method for preparing a<br>
target substance in particulate form, the method comprising introducing into a particle<br>
formation vessel (a) a solution or suspension of the target substance in a fluid vehicle<br>
(the "target solution/suspension") and (b) a compressed fluid anti-solvent for the<br>
substance, and allowing the anti-solvent fluid to extract the vehicle from the target<br>
solution/suspension so as to form particles of the target substance, wherein (i) the<br>
pressure in the particle formation vessel is P1 which is preferably greater than the<br>
critical pressure Pc of the anti-solvent, (ii) the anti-solvent is introduced through a<br>
restricted inlet so as to have a back pressure of P2, where P2 is greater than P1, (Hi) the<br>
temperature in the particle formation vessel is T1 which is preferably greater than the<br>
critical temperature Tc of the anti-solvent, (iv) the anti-solvent is introduced into the<br>
vessel at a temperature T2, where T2 is greater than T1, (v) T1 and T2 are such that Joule-<br>
Thomson cooling of the anti-solvent as it enters the vessel does not reduce the anti-<br><br>
solvent temperature to below that required of it at the point of particle formation (and<br>
are preferably such that the anti-solvent temperature does not fall below Tc within the<br>
vessel) and (vi) P1, P2, T1 and T2 are such that the anti-solvent fluid has a sonic, near-<br>
sonic or supersonic velocity as it enters the particle formation vessel.<br>
Again the anti-solvent and the target solution/suspension must be introduced separately<br>
into the particle formation vessel and contact each other downstream of (preferably<br>
immediately downstream of) the point of anti-solvent entry into the vessel.<br>
The anti-solvent expansion as it enters the particle formation vessel is isenthalpic.<br>
Thus, an appropriate temperature for the anti-solvent upstream of the vessel may be<br>
derived from enthalpy charts for the fluid, for instance as illustrated for carbon dioxide<br>
in Fig 1. (For CO2, the critical temperature Tc is 31 °C (304 K) and the critical pressure<br>
Pc is 74 bar.) Fig 1 shows how, when working with a pressure reduction from 300 to 80<br>
bar for the CO2 on entering the particle formation vessel, the upstream temperature<br>
should be at least 360 K (87 °C) to achieve an appropriate temperature of 308 K (35 °C)<br>
or greater when the CO2 enters the vessel.<br>
Thus, a carbon dioxide anti-solvent is preferably introduced with an upstream<br>
temperature of 80 °C (353 K) or higher, more preferably between 80 °C and 170 °C (443<br>
K).<br>
The pressures and temperatures needed to ensure a near-sonic, sonic or supersonic<br>
velocity depend on the nature of the anti-solvent fluid. In the case of a carbon dioxide<br>
anti-solvent, for instance, in order to achieve a sonic or supersonic velocity the<br>
operating conditions must satisfy the formula:<br><br>
where P1, is the CO2 pressure upstream of entry into the particle formation vessel and pa<br>
is the CO2 pressure immediately on entry into the vessel, and k is the ratio of the<br>
specific heats of CO2 at constant pressure (Cp) and constant volume (Cv).<br><br>
So, for example the CO2 may be introduced at a temperature of 360 K (87 °C) with an<br>
inlet pressure p1, of 300 bar, and the vessel may be at 310 K (37 °C) and 80 bar (ie, ihe<br>
outlet pressure Po is 80 bar). At 310 K and 80 bar, k for CO2 is 8.78'. At 360 K and 300<br>
bar, k is 2.291. Taking a geometric average for k of 4.48, as the CO2 exits the nozzle,<br>
then substituting these values into the above equation gives <br>
0.274, which confirms that the CO2 flow is supersonic irrespective of the CO2 flow rate<br>
into the vessel, so long as there is an appropriate pressure differential between p, and p0.<br>
A suitable CO2 flow might be for instance between 170 and 200 g/min. A suitable<br>
pressure drop as the CO2 enters the particle formation vessel might be between 170 and<br>
250 bar.<br>
An alternative method for calculating the anti-solvent velocity (again for carbon<br>
dioxide, using the same operating conditions as above but with a vessel temperature of<br>
40 °C, and introducing the CO2 through a nozzle of outlet diameter 0.2 mm) is:<br>
(i) density of CO2 at 310 K and 80 bar1 is 0.33088 g/cm3,<br>
(ii) therefore, volumetric flow of CO2 at 200 g/min (Q) is 200/0.33088 = 604.45<br>
cm3/min.<br>
(iii)	Surface area (A) of the nozzle = 3.14x10-4 cm2,<br>
(iv)	therefore velocity of CO2 = Q-(Ax60xl00) = 320.7 m/s.<br>
(v)	Speed of sound in CO2 at 310 K and 80 bar1 is 196.8 m/s.<br>
(vi)	Thus, the CO2 velocity is confirmed as being supersonic under such conditions.<br>
Although we do not wish to be bound by this theory, it is believed that in the method of<br>
the invention, a so-called "Mach disk" is generated in the anti-solvent flow downstream<br>
1 International thermodynamic tables of the fluid state - 3. Carbon dioxide, Angus et al, Pergamon Press,<br>
1976<br><br>
of the second fluid inlet means. In this region the fluid velocity will change abruptly to<br>
sub-sonic thus generating shock waves in the fluids present (in effect a continuous, low<br>
volume, supersonic boom). These shock waves are thought to aid mixing and<br>
dispersion of the target solution/suspension with the anti-solvent. It is unlikely that the<br>
waves will be ultrasonic as in for example the system described in WO-97/31691.<br>
Moreover they will propagate in the direction of the anti-solvent flow, rather than in a<br>
counter-current sense as in for instance the nozzle described in WO-97/31691 which<br>
reflects a sonic wave back towards a source of energising gas.<br>
The arrangement of the first and second inlet means will preferably be such that the<br>
Mach disk is generated upstream (in the direction of anti-solvent flow) of the point of<br>
entry of the target solution/suspension into the particle formation vessel. It should occur<br>
in line with the longitudinal axis of the second inlet means, ie, in line with the direction<br>
of anti-solvent flow.<br>
The near-sonic, sonic or supersonic anti-solvent velocity is ideally achieved, in the<br>
method of the present invention, simply by the use of appropriate anti-solvent flow<br>
rates, back pressures and/or operating temperatures, and without the aid of mechanical,<br>
electrical and/or magnetic input such as for example from impellers, impinging surfaces<br>
especially within the anti-solvent introducing means, electrical transducers and the like.<br>
Introducing the anti-solvent via a convergent nozzle, ideally as a single fluid stream,<br>
may also help in the achievement of appropriate fluid velocities. Further "energising"<br>
fluid streams, such as those required in the method of WO-97/31691, are not then<br>
needed in order to achieve the desired level of control over the contact between the<br>
target solution/suspension and the anti-solvent fluid.<br>
The use of near-sonic, soak or supersonic anti-solvent velocities can allow achievement<br>
of smaller particle sizes and narrower size distributions in GAS-based particle formation<br>
processes. In particular it can allow the formation of small micro- or even nano-<br>
particles, for instance of volume mean diameter less than 5 μm, preferably less than 2<br>
μm, more preferably less than 1 μm. Such particulate products preferably have narrow<br><br>
size distributions, such as with a standard deviation of 2.5 or less, more preferably 2.0<br>
or less, most preferably 1.9 or even 1.8 or less.<br>
The use of near-sonic, sonic or supersonic anti-solvent velocities also appears to lead to<br>
more efficient vehicle extraction, thus potentially yielding particles with lower residual<br>
solvent levels, less agglomeration and generally improved handling properties.<br>
The anti-solvent fluid must be in a compressed state, by which is meant that it is above<br>
its vapour pressure, preferably above atmospheric pressure, more preferably from 70 to<br>
200 bar or from 80 to 150 bar. More preferably "compressed" means above the critical<br>
pressure Pc for the fluid or fluid mixture concerned. In practice, the pressure of the anti-<br>
solvent fluid is likely to be in the range (1.01 - 9.0)PC, preferably (1.01 - 7.0)PC.<br>
Thus, the anti-solvent is preferably a supercritical or near-critical fluid, although it may<br>
alternatively be a compressed liquid such as for instance liquid CO2.<br>
As used herein, the term "supercritical fluid" means a fluid at or above its critical<br>
pressure (Pc) and critical temperature (Tc) simultaneously. In practice, the pressure of<br>
the fluid is likely to be in the range (1.01 - 9.0)PC, preferably (1.01 - 7.0)PC, and its<br>
temperature in the range (1.01 - 4.0)TC (measured in Kelvin). However, some fluids<br>
(eg, helium and neon) have particularly low critical pressures and temperatures, and<br>
may need to be used under operating conditions well in excess of (such as up to 200<br>
times) those critical values.<br>
"Near-critical fluid" is here used to refer to a fluid which is either (a) above its Tc but<br>
slightly below its Pc, (b) above its Pc but slightly below its Tc or (c) slightly below both<br>
its Tc and its Pc. The term "near-critical fluid" thus encompasses both high pressure<br>
liquids, which are fluids at or above their critical pressure but below (although<br>
preferably close to) their critical temperature, and dense vapours, which are fluids at or<br>
above their critical temperature but below (although preferably close to) their- critical<br>
pressure.<br>
By way of example, a high pressure liquid might have a pressure between about 1.01<br>
and 9 times its Pc, and a temperature between about 0.5 and 0.99 times its Tc. A dense<br><br>
vapour might, correspondingly, have a pressure between about 0.5 and 0.99 times its Pc,<br>
and a temperature between about 1.01 and 4 times its Tc.<br>
The terms "supercritical fluid" and "near-critical fluid" each encompass a mixture of<br>
fluid types, so long as the mixture is in the supercritical or near-critical state<br>
respectively.<br>
In the method of the present invention, it may be preferred that the operating<br>
temperature (ie, the temperature in the particle formation vessel) be close to the critical<br>
temperature Tc of the mixture of anti-solvent and target solution/suspension formed at<br>
the point of fluid contact. For example, the temperature might be between 0.9 and 1.1<br>
times Tc (in Kelvin), preferably between 0.95 and 1.05 times Tc, more preferably<br>
between 0.97 and 1.03 or between 0.98 and 1.02 times Tc, or perhaps between 1 and<br>
1.05 or 1 and 1.03 or 1 and 1.02 times Tc. This is because at Tc the velocity of sound in<br>
a fluid is theoretically zero; near-sonic, sonic and supersonic velocities can thus more<br>
readily be achieved, using lower anti-solvent flow rates, as Tc is approached.<br>
The anti-solvent should be a compressed (preferably supercritical or near-critical, more<br>
preferably supercritical) fluid at its point of entry into the particle formation vessel and<br>
preferably also within the vessel and throughout the particle formation process. Thus,<br>
for a carbon dioxide anti-solvent the temperature in the particle formation vessel is<br>
ideally greater than 31 °C, for example between 31 and 100 °C, preferably between 31<br>
and 70°C, and the pressure greater than 74 bar, for example between 75 and 350 bar.<br>
Carbon dioxide is a highly suitable anti-solvent, but others include nitrogen, nitrous<br>
oxide, sulphur hexafluoride, xenon, ethylene, chlorotrifluoromethane, ethane,<br>
trifluoromethane and noble gases such as helium or neon.<br>
The anti-solvent must be miscible or substantially miscible with the fluid vehicle at the<br>
point of their contact, so that the anti-solvent can extract the vehicle from the target<br>
solution/suspension. By "miscible" is meant that the two fluids are miscible in all<br>
proportions, and "substantially miscible" encompasses the situation where the fluids can<br>
mix sufficiently well under the operating conditions used, as to achieve the same or a<br><br>
similar effect, ie, dissolution of the fluids in one another and precipitation of the target<br>
substance. However the anti-solvent must not, at the point of particle formation, extract<br>
or dissolve the target substance. In other words, it must be chosen so that the target<br>
substance is for all practical purposes (in particular, under the chosen operating<br>
conditions and taking into account any fluid modifiers present) insoluble or<br>
substantially insoluble in it. Preferably the target substance is less than 10-3 mole %,<br>
more preferably less than 10-5 mole %, soluble in the anti-solvent fluid.<br>
The anti-solvent fluid may optionally contain one or more modifiers, for example water,<br>
methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or acetone. A modifier (or co-solvent) may be described<br>
as a chemical which, when added to a fluid such as a supercritical or near-critical fluid,<br>
changes the intrinsic properties of that fluid in or around its critical point, in particular<br>
its ability to dissolve other materials. When used, a modifier preferably constitutes not<br>
more than 40 mole %, more preferably not more than 20 mole %, and most preferably<br>
between 1 and 10 mole %, of the anti-solvent fluid.<br>
The vehicle is a fluid which is able to carry the target substance in solution or<br>
suspension. It may be composed of one or more component fluids, eg, it may be a<br>
mixture of two or more solvents. It must be soluble (or substantially soluble) in the<br>
chosen anti-solvent fluid at their point of contact. It may contain, in solution or<br>
suspension, other materials apart from the target substance.<br>
The target solution/suspension may in particular comprise two or more fluids which are<br>
mixed in situ at or immediately before their contact with the anti-solvent. Such systems<br>
are described, eg, in WO-96/00610 and WO-01/03821. The two or more fluids may<br>
carry two or more target substances, to be combined in some way (for instance, co-<br>
precipitated as a matrix, or one precipitated as a coating around the other, or precipitated<br>
as the product of an in situ reaction between the substances) at the point of particle<br>
formation. Target substanee(s) may also be carried in the anti-solvent fluid as well as in<br>
the target solution(s)/suspension(s).<br>
The target substance may be any substance which needs to be produced in particulate<br>
form. Examples include pharmaceuticals; pharmaceutical excipients such as carriers;<br><br>
dyestuffs; cosmetics; foodstuffs; coatings; agrochemicals; products of use in the<br>
ceramics, explosives or photographic industries; etc... It may be organic or inorganic,<br>
monomeric or polymeric. It is preferably soluble or substantially soluble in the fluid<br>
vehicle, preferably having a solubility in it of 10-4 mole % or greater under the<br>
conditions under which the target solution is prepared (ie, upstream of the point of<br>
particle formation).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the target substance is for use in or as a<br>
pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
The target substance may be in a single or multi-component form (eg, it could comprise<br>
an intimate mixture of two materials, or one material in a matrix of another, or one<br>
material coated onto a substrate of another, or other similar mixtures). The particulate<br>
product, formed from the target substance using the method of the invention, may also<br>
be in such a multi-component form - examples include two pharmaceuticals intended<br>
for co-administration, or a pharmaceutical together with a polymer carrier matrix. Such<br>
products may be made (as described above) from solutions/suspensions containing only<br>
single component starting materials, provided the solutions/suspensions are contacted<br>
with the anti-solvent fluid in the correct manner. The particulate product may comprise<br>
a substance formed from an in situ reaction (ie, immediately prior to, or on, contact with<br>
the anti-solvent) between two or more reactant substances each carried by an<br>
appropriate vehicle.<br>
In the method of the invention, the anti-solvent and the target solution/suspension are<br>
introduced separately into the particle formation vessel (which is preferably the vessel<br>
in which the formed particles are collected) and contact each other after (preferably<br>
immediately after) their point of entry into the vessel In this way, particle formation<br>
can be made to occur at a point where there is a high degree of control over conditions<br>
such as the temperatures, pressures and flow rates of the fluids.<br>
The fluids are ideally introduced in such a way that the mechanical (kinetic) energy of<br>
the anti-solvent fluid can act to disperse the target solution/suspension at the same time<br>
as it extracts the vehicle; this again allows a high degree of control over the<br><br>
physicochemical characteristics of the particulate product, in particular the size and size<br>
distribution of the particles and their solid state properties. "Disperse" in this context<br>
refers generally to the transfer of kinetic energy from one fluid to another, usually<br>
implying the formation of droplets, or of other analogous fluid elements, of the fluid to<br>
which the kinetic energy is transferred. Thus, the fluid inlet means used to introduce the<br>
fluids should allow the mechanical energy (typically the shearing action) of the anti-<br>
solvent flow to facilitate intimate mixing of the fluids and to disperse them, at the point<br>
where the fluids meet.<br>
Introducing the two fluids separately in this way can help prevent apparatus blockages<br>
at the point of anti-solvent entry, due for example to the highly efficient extraction of<br>
the vehicle into the anti-solvent under the operating conditions used.<br>
Thus, the present invention may be seen as a modification of the SEDS™ process, in<br>
which the target solution/suspension and the anti-solvent fluid contact one another<br>
externally of their respective (preferably separate) fluid inlets into the particle formation<br>
vessel. A high degree of control is retained over the mechanism for fluid contact, as in<br>
the basic SEDS™ process, and this control may be achieved for example at least partly<br>
by introducing the anti-solvent fluid with a sonic, near-sonic or supersonic velocity.<br>
Other ways in which such control may be achieved or improved upon include providing<br>
controlled agitation within the particle formation vessel, in particular in the region of<br>
fluid contact immediately downstream of the respective target solution/suspension and<br>
anti-solvent inlets. For example, the target solution/suspension may be dispersed onto a<br>
sonicating surface at or immediately prior to its contact with the anti-solvent fluid.<br>
Agitation may alternatively be achieved for instance by stirring, such as with a turbine,<br>
propeller, paddle, impeller or the like.<br>
That said, the present invention may if necessary be practised in the absence of such<br>
additional agitation means within the particle formation vessel.<br>
The target solution/suspension may be introduced into the vessel through any suitable<br>
fluid inlet means, including one which effects, or assists in effecting, controlled<br>
atomisation of the solution/suspension.<br><br>
Preferably the two fluids meet immediately downstream of the point of anti-solvent<br>
entry. "Immediately" in this context implies a sufficiently small time interval (between<br>
the anti-solvent entering the particle formation vessel and its contact with the target<br>
solution/suspension) as preferably still to allow transfer of mechanical energy from the<br>
anti-solvent to the solution/suspension so as to achieve dispersion. Nevertheless, there<br>
is still preferably a short interval of time between anti-solvent entry and fluid contact so<br>
as to eliminate, or substantially eliminate or at least reduce, the risk of apparatus<br>
blockage due to particle formation at the point of anti-solvent entry. The timing of the<br>
fluid contact will depend on the natures of the fluids, the target substance and the<br>
desired end product, as well as on the size and geometry of the particle formation vessel<br>
and the apparatus used to introduce the fluids and on the fluid flow rates. The contact<br>
may occur within 0.5 to 10 seconds, more preferably within 1 to 7 seconds, most<br>
preferably within 1.2 to 6 seconds, such as within 1.4 to 5.5 seconds, of the anti-solvent<br>
entering the particle formation vessel.<br>
The target solution/suspension is preferably introduced directly into the anti-solvent<br>
flow. It preferably meets with the anti-solvent flow at the point where the target<br>
solution/suspension enters the vessel.<br>
Preferably the outlet of the first fluid inlet means is located vertically below that of the<br>
second fluid inlet means, and the anti-solvent fluid flows into the particle formation<br>
vessel in a vertically downwards direction.<br>
At the point where the target solution/suspension and the anti-solvent meet, the angle<br>
between their axes of flow may be from 0 ° (ie, the two fluids are flowing in parallel<br>
directions) to 180 ° (ie, oppositely-directed flows). However, they preferably meet at a<br>
point where they are flowing in approximately perpendicular directions, ie, the angle<br>
between their axes of flow is from 70 to 110 °, more preferably from 80 to 100 °, such as<br>
90°.<br>
Suitable fluid inlet means, which may be used to achieve the form of fluid contact<br>
required by the first aspect of the invention, is described below in connection with the<br>
second aspect.<br><br>
Use of such a fluid inlet system can allow SEDS™ and other GAS-based particle<br>
formation techniques to be practised in cases where the vehicle for the target<br>
solution/suspension is a relatively high boiling fluid (eg, boiling point greater than about<br>
150 °C, or even greater than 180 °C) such as dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl<br>
sulphoxide (DMSO), dimethyl acetamide (DMA), diethyl acetamide (DEA) or N-<br>
methyl pyrollidinone (NMP), or where the target substance is temperature sensitive.<br>
Since the anti-solvent and the target solution/suspension enter the vessel separately, the<br>
latter can be maintained at a desired lower temperature despite the use of a relatively<br>
high temperature for the incoming anti-solvent. Moreover, the use of a sonic, near-<br>
sonic or supersonic anti-solvent velocity can be sufficient to disperse the target<br>
solution/suspension at relatively low operating temperatures (ie, vessel temperatures) -<br>
again this assists in the processing of temperature sensitive target substances and<br>
vehicles.<br>
When carrying out the present invention, the particle formation vessel temperature and<br>
pressure are ideally controlled so as to allow particle formation to occur at or<br>
substantially at the point where the target solution/suspension meets the anti-solvent<br>
fluid. The conditions in the vessel must generally be such that the anti-solvent fluid,<br>
and the solution which is formed when it extracts the vehicle, both remain in the<br>
compressed (preferably supercritical or near-critical, more preferably supercritical) form<br>
whilst in the vessel For the supercritical, near-critical or compressed solution, this<br>
means that at feast one of its constituent fluids (usually the anti-solvent fluid, which in<br>
general will be the major constituent of the mixture) should be in a compressed state at<br>
the time of particle formation. There should at that time be a single-phase mixture of<br>
the vehicle and the anti-solvent fluid, otherwise the particulate product might be<br>
distributed between two or more fluid phases, in some of which it might be able to<br>
redissolve. This is why the anti-solvent fluid needs to be miscible or substantially<br>
miscible with the vehicle.<br>
The terms "supercritical solation', "near-critical solution and "compressed solution"<br>
mean respectively a supercritical, near-critical or compressed fluid together with a fluid<br>
vehicle which it has extracted and dissolved. The solution should itself still be in the<br><br>
supercritical, near-critical or compressed state, as the case may be, and exist as a single<br>
phase, at least within the particle formation vessel.<br>
Selection of appropriate operating conditions will be influenced by the natures of the<br>
fluids involved (in particular, their Pc and Tc values and their solubility and miscibility<br>
characteristics) and also by the characteristics desired of the particulate end product, for<br>
instance yield, particle size and size distribution, purity, morphology, or crystalline,<br>
polymorphic or isomeric form. Variables include the flow rates of the anti-solvent fluid<br>
and the target solution/suspension, the concentration of the target substance in the<br>
vehicle, the temperature and pressure inside the particle formation vessel, the anti-<br>
solvent temperature upstream of the vessel and the geometry of the fluid inlets into the<br>
vessel, in particular the size of the anti-solvent inlet. The method of the invention<br>
preferably involves controlling one or more of these variables so as to influence the<br>
physicochemical characteristics of the particles formed.<br>
The flow rate of the anti-solvent fluid relative to that ofthe target solution/suspension,<br>
and its pressure and temperature, should be sufficient to allow it to accommodate the<br>
vehicle, so that it can extract the vehicle and hence cause particle formation. The anti-<br>
solvent flow rate will generally be higher than that of the target solution/suspension -<br>
typically, the ratio of the target solution/suspension flow rate to the anti-solvent flow<br>
rate (both measured at or immediately prior to the two fluids coming into contact with<br>
one another) will be 0.001 or greater, preferably from 0.01 to 0.2, more preferably from<br>
about 0.03 to 0.1.<br>
The anti-solvent flow rate will also generally be chosen to ensure an excess of the anti-<br>
solvent over the vehicle when the fluids come into contact, to minimise the risk of the<br>
vehicle re-dissolving and/or agglomerating the particles formed. At the point of<br>
extraction of the vehicle it may constitute from 1 to 80 mole %, preferably 50 mole % or<br>
less or 30 mote % or less, more preferably from 1 to 20 mole % and most preferably<br>
from 1 to 5 mole %, of the compressed fluid mixture formed.<br>
Both the anti-solvent and the target solution/suspension are ideally introduced into the<br>
particle formation vessel with a smooth, continuous and preferably pulse-less or<br><br>
substantially pulse-less flow. Conventional apparatus may be used to ensure such fluid<br>
flows.<br>
The method of the invention preferably additionally involves collecting the particles<br>
following their formation, more preferably in the particle formation vessel itself.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided apparatus for<br>
use in preparing a target substance in particulate form, and in particular for use in a<br>
method according to the first aspect of the invention, the apparatus comprising:<br>
(i) a particle formation vessel;<br>
(ii) first fluid inlet means for introducing into the vessel a solution or suspension of<br>
the target substance in a fluid vehicle (the "target solution/suspension"); and<br>
(iii) second fluid inlet means, separate from the first, for introducing a compressed<br>
fluid anti-solvent into the particle formation vessel;<br>
wherein the first and second fluid inlet means are so arranged that, in use, a target<br>
solution/suspension introduced through the first and an anti-solvent introduced through<br>
the second enter the particle formation vessel at different locations and meet<br>
immediately downstream (in the direction of anti-solvent flow) of the second fluid inlet<br>
means.<br>
The first fluid inlet means suitably comprises a fluid inlet tube, for instance of stainless<br>
steel, which might typically have an internal diameter of from 0.1 to 0.2 mm, more<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 0.15 mm, and may have a tapered outlet section.<br>
The second fluid inlet means preferably provides a restriction at the point of fluid entry<br>
into the particle formation vessel: for instance, the second fluid inlet means may<br>
comprise a nozzle. Again it may suitably be made from stainless steel. It preferably has<br>
at least one passage of internal diameter from for instance 1 to 2 mm, more preferably<br>
from 1.3 to 1.9 mm, such as 1.6 mm. Again, it may have a tapered outlet section (ie. be<br>
a "convergent"-type nozzle), with an angle of taper (with respect to the longitudinal axis<br><br>
of the nozzle) typically in the range 10 ° to 60 °, preferably from 10 ° to 50 °, more<br>
preferably from 20 ° to 40 °, and most preferably about 30 °.<br>
The opening at the outlet end (tip) of the nozzle will preferably have a diameter in the<br>
range of 0.005 to 5 mm, more preferably 0.05 to 2 mm, most preferably from 0.1 to 0.5<br>
mm, for instance about 0.1,0.2,0.3 or 0.35 mm.<br>
The dimensions of the fluid inlet will naturally depend on the scale on which the<br>
process is to be practised; for commercial scale manufacture, for example, the above<br>
nozzle dimensions may be up to ten times larger.<br>
A nozzle of the above type may comprise more than one fluid passage; for instance it<br>
may comprise two or more coaxial passages such as in the nozzles described in WO-<br>
95/01221, WO-96700610 and WO-98/36825, particularly if additional fluids are to be<br>
introduced into the system. One or more of the passages may be used to introduce two<br>
or more fluids at the same time, and the mlets to such passages may be modified<br>
accordingly.<br>
The outlet of the first fluid inlet means (into the particle formation vessel) is preferably<br>
immediately downstream, in the direction of anti-solvent flow in use, of that of the<br>
second fluid inlet means. A suitable separation for the two outlets is a short distance<br>
such as from 0 to 50, preferably from 10 to 40, for instance about 20 times the diameter<br>
of the outlet of the second fluid inlet means. Suitable distances might lie from 0 to 10<br>
mm or from 0.1 to 10 mm, preferably from 2 to 8 mm, for instance about 4 mm. Again,<br>
they may depend on the scale of the process which the inlet means are to be used for.<br>
The outlet of the first fluid inlet means preferably has a smaller cross sectional area than<br>
that of the second fluid inlet means, more preferably less than 80 % as large and most<br>
preferably less than 70 % or 65 % as large. Preferably this outlet is positioned such<br>
that, in use, it is within the flow of anti-solvent fluid exiting the second fluid inlet<br>
means. Most preferred is an arrangement in which the centre of the outlet of the first<br>
fluid inlet means corresponds to the centre of the outlet of the second fluid inlet means,<br><br>
ie, the centres of the two outlets are both positioned on the central longitudinal axis of<br>
the second fluid inlet means.<br>
The first and second fluid inlet means are preferably arranged so that at the point where<br>
the target solution/suspension and the anti-solvent meet, the angle between their axes of<br>
flow is from 70 ° to 110 °, more preferably from 80 to 100 °, most preferably about 90 °.<br>
The first and second fluid inlet means may for convenience be provided as part of a<br>
single fluid inlet assembly which may be placed in fluid communication with the<br>
particle formation vessel and with sources of the anti-solvent fluid and the target<br>
solution/suspension.<br>
Thus, according to a third aspect, the present invention provides a fluid inlet assembly<br>
for use as part of apparatus according to the second aspect of the invention, and/or in a<br>
method according to the first aspect.<br>
In apparatus according to the second aspect of the invention, the particle formation<br>
vessel preferably contains particle collection means, such as a filter, by which particles<br>
of the target substance may be collected in the vessel in which they form, downstream<br>
of the point of contact between the target solution/suspension and the anti-solvent fluid.<br>
The apparatus may additionally comprise a source of a compressed (preferably<br>
supercritical or near-critical) fluid and/or a source of a target solution or suspension.<br>
The former may itself comprise means for altering the temperature and/or pressure of a<br>
fluid so as to bring it into a compressed (preferably supercritical or near-critical) state.<br>
The apparatus conveniently includes means for controlling the pressure in the particle<br>
formation vessel, for example a back pressure regulator downstream of the vessel,<br>
and/or means (such as an oven) for controlling the temperature in the vessel. The vessel<br>
is coaveniently a pressure vessel and should be capable of withstanding the pressures<br>
necessary to maintain compressed (preferably supercritical or near-critical) conditions<br>
during the particle formation process, as described above in connection with the method<br>
of the invention.<br><br>
Because embodiments of the present invention are modified versions of the inventions<br>
disclosed in WO-95/01221, WO-96/00610, WO-98/36825, WO-99/44733, WO-<br>
99/59710, WO-01/03821, WO-01/15664 and WO-02/38127, technical features<br>
described in those documents, for instance regarding the selection of appropriate<br>
reagents and operating conditions, can apply also to the present invention. The eight<br>
earlier documents are therefore intended to be read together with the present<br>
application.<br>
In this specification the term "substantially", when applied to a condition, is meant to<br>
encompass the exact condition (eg, exact simultaneity) as well as conditions which are<br>
(for practical purposes, taking into account the degree of precision with which such<br>
conditions can be measured and achieved) close to that exact condition, and/or which<br>
are similar enough to that exact condition as to achieve, in context, the same or a very<br>
similar effect<br>
References to solubilities and miscibilities, unless otherwise stated, are to the relevant<br>
fluid characteristics under the operating conditions used, ie, under the chosen conditions<br>
of temperature and pressure and taking into account any modifiers present in the fluids.<br>

Detailed description<br>
Fig 2 shows apparatus suitable for carrying out methods in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Item 1 is a particle formation vessel, within which the temperature and<br>
pressure can be controlled by means of the heating jacket 2 and back pressure regulator<br>
3. The vessel 1 contains a particle collection device (not shown) such as a filter, filter<br>
basket or filter bag. A fluid inlet assembly 4 allows introduction of a compressed<br>
(typically supercritical or near-critical) fluid anti-sorvent from source 5 and one or more<br>
target solutions/suspensions from sources such as 6 and 7. The items labelled 8 are<br>
pumps, and 9 is a cooler. A recycling system 11 allows solvent recovery.<br>
The fluid inlet assembly 4 may for example take the form shown in Figs 3 to 5. Fig 3<br>
shows the assembly schematically, in use with the particle formation vessel 1 of the Fig<br>
2 apparatus. Nozzle 21 is for introduction of the anti-solvent fluid. It has only a single<br>
passage of circular cross section, with a circular outlet 22. Alternatively, a multi-<br>
component nozzle may be used, with anti-solvent introduced through one or more of its<br>
passages and the remaining passages either closed off or else used to introduce<br>
additional reagents. (For example, a multi-passage nozzle of the type described in WO-<br>
95/01221 or WO-96/00610 may be used. Such nozzles have two or more concentric<br>
(coaxial) passages, the outlets of which are typically separated by a short distance to<br>
allow a small degree of internal mixing to take place between fluids introduced through<br><br>
the respective passages before they exit the nozzle. The anti-solvent could for instance<br>
be introduced through the inner passage of such a nozzle, traversing a small "mixing"<br>
zone as it exits that inner passage and then passing through the main nozzle outlet into<br>
the particle formation vessel.)<br>
Inlet tube 23 is for introduction of the target solution/suspension, and is so shaped and<br>
located that the direction of flow of the solution/suspension at its outlet 24 (see Fig 5)<br>
will be perpendicular to that of the anti-solvent exiting nozzle 21. Again the tube is of<br>
circular cross section.<br>
Fig 4 shows how tube 23 is mounted, by means of the supporting and locking pieces 25,<br>
on a collar 26 which is itself mounted around the lower portion of the nozzle 21. The<br>
arrangement is such as to allow adjustment of the distance "d" between the outlets of<br>
nozzle 21 and tube 23. It can be seen that the outlet of tube 23 is positioned on the<br>
central longitudinal axis of the nozzle 21.<br>
Both the nozzle 21 and the tube 23 are preferably made from stainless steel.<br>
The assembly of Figs 3 to 5 may be less likely to suffer blockages (at the nozzle and<br>
tube outlets) than a multi-component SEDS™ nozzle of the type described in WO-<br>
95/01221, particularly when the operating conditions are such as to allow a very rapid<br>
and efficient removal of the solvent vehicle, from the target solution/suspension, by the<br>
anti-solvent.<br>
Examples<br>
Apparatus as shown in Fig 2, incorporating a fluid inlet assembly as shown in Figs 3 to<br>
5, was used to carry out particle formation methods in accordance with the invention.<br>
The nozzle 21 comprised a fluid inlet tube of internal diameter 1.6 mm and an outlet of<br>
diameter 6.2 mm. The internal bore at the end of the inlet tube 23 was 0.125 mm. The<br>
vertical separation "d" between the nozzle and tube outlets was varied between 0 and 8<br>
mm, "0" representing the situation where the solution tube 23 contacted the lower end<br>
of the nozzle 21.<br><br>
Supercritical carbon dioxide was used as the anti-solvent. It was pumped at a flow rate<br>
(of liquid CO2, prior to passing through a heater) of 200 g/min. Its temperature on entry<br>
into the nozzle 21 was 356 K (83 °C).<br>
The pressure in the particle formation vessel 1 (capacity 2 litres) was maintained at 80<br>
bar and 309-313 K (36-40 °C). The CO2 back pressure was between 250 and 300 bar.<br>
These conditions created a sonic or supersonic CO2 velocity at the nozzle outlet 22.<br>
Examples A<br>
Various target compounds were dissolved in appropriate solvents and introduced into<br>
the apparatus via tube 23. The distance "d" between the outlets of the anti-solvent<br>
nozzle and the solution inlet tube was kept constant at 4 mm. Particle formation was<br>
allowed to occur by the action of the CO2 anti-solvent, and the products collected in the<br>
vessel 1. The products were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and in<br>
most cases their particle sizes analysed using an Aerosizer™ and/or Sympatec™<br>
system.<br>
The results of these experiments are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br><br><br>
SEM photographs of the products of Experiments Al, A2, A3 and A6 are shown in Figs<br>
6 to 9 respectively.<br>
Examples B<br>
In these experiments, the distance "d" between the outlets of the anti-solvent nozzle 21<br>
and the solution inlet tube 23 was varied between 0 and 8 mm. In practice, the "0"<br>
separation represented the thickness of the inlet tube wall - in other words, as close to<br>
zero as was possible without cutting into the nozzle wall. The target solution was 3 %<br>
w/v compound I in methanol; its flow rate into the particle formation vessel 1 was 4<br>
ml/min.<br>
The results are shown in Table 2 below.<br><br><br>
The particle size distributions (by Aerosizer™) for the products of Examples Bl, B2<br>
and B3 are shown in Figs 10 to 12 respectively.<br>
Examples C<br>
These experiments investigated the effect of the target solution flow rate on the product<br>
particle size. Again various target compounds were tested, the operating conditions<br>
being as for Examples A.<br>
The results are given in Table 3 below.<br><br><br><br><br>
Examples D<br>
These experiments compared two types of fluid inlet assembly. In Example Dl, a two-<br>
fluid coaxial nozzle of the type described in WO-95/01221 was used to co-introduce<br>
supercritical CO2 and Compound VI in solution in THF (tetrahydrofuran). The internal<br>
diameter of the inner nozzle passage, through which the CO2 was introduced, was 1.6<br>
mm; that of the outer passage, through which the target solution was introduced, 2.5<br>
mm. The nozzle outlet diameter was 0.2 mm.<br>
In Example D2, an assembly of the type illustrated in Figs 3 to 5, with a nozzle outlet<br>
separation "d" of 4 mm, was used to introduce the same reagents. The CO2 was<br>
introduced through the inner passage of the nozzle used in Example Dl; the outer<br>
nozzle passage was not used.<br>
All other operating conditions were the same for both experiments. Within the particle<br>
formation vessel the temperature was 309 K (36 °C) and the pressure was 80 bar. The<br>
target solution concentration was 5 % w/v and its flow rate 1 ml/min. The CO2 flow<br>
rate was 200 g/min and its inlet temperature 356 K (83 °C).<br>
The results are given in Table 4 below.<br><br><br>
SEMs for the products of Examples Dl and D2 are shown in Figs 13 and 14<br>
respectively. Their Aerosizer™ particle size distributions are shown in Figs 15 and 16<br>
respectively, D2 showing a significantly smaller particle size and a better distribution<br>
thanDl.<br>
It was also found that the fluid inlet assembly of Figs 3 to 5 (Example D2) gave a less<br>
agglomerated product.<br>
Examples E<br>
Two further target compounds, dihydroergotamine mesylate (Compound VII) and<br>
ipratropium bromide (Compound VIII) were prepared using a vessel temperature of 309<br>
K (36 °C) and pressure of 80 bar, a CO2 flow rate of 200 g/min and a nozzle separation<br>
"d" of 4 mm. The CO2 temperature upstream of the vessel was 356 K (83 °C). Particle<br>
sizes were assessed using the Aerosizer™. The results are shown in Table 5 below.<br><br><br>
SEM photographs of the products of Experiments E2 and E3 are shown in Figs 17 and<br>
18 respectively.<br>
Examples F<br>
Two drugs suitable for delivery by inhalation therapy were produced using the method<br>
of the invention. In all cases the products were fine, free-flowing powders having<br>
excellent dispersibility in fluids such as in particular the propellant fluids used to<br>
aerosolise such active substances in so-called "metered dose inhalers". The drugs<br>
exhibited improved flocculation performance in such propellants (in particular in HFA<br><br>
134a and HFA 227ea), as compared to the performance of micronised versions of the<br>
same drugs having comparable particle sizes.<br>
For these experiments, the CO2 anti-solvent was pumped at different flow rates, as<br>
shown in Table 6 below. Its temperature on entry into the nozzle 21 of the Fig 2<br>
apparatus was 363 K (90 °C). The pressure in the particle formation vessel 1 (capacity<br>
2000 ml) was maintained at 80 bar and 309 K (36 °C). The vertical separation "d"<br>
between the nozzle and solution tube outlets was 4 mm.<br>
The reagents, solvents and other relevant operating conditions are summarised in Table<br>
6, together with the particle sizes and size distributions of the products.<br><br>
