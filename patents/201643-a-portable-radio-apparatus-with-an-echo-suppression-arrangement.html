Dfit^ilfid Dfisrription of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Embodiments of the invention will be explained with reference to Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view of portable radio apparatus showing a configuration of an echo suppression mechanism according to the embodiment of the invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the body of portable radio apparatus is composed of a cover 11 and a case 12, and an I/O connector 14 provided on a printed circuit board 13 is sandwiched between the cover 11 and the case 12. Onto the cover 11 is attached a transmitter (microphone) 15 provided on the printed circuit board 13 and the cover 11 is provided with a mouthpiece 16. The case 12 is provided with a battery receiver 17 for receiving batteries 18.<br>
Fig. 1 differs from the conventional configuration in Fig. 4 in that the side of the I/O connector 14 facing the case 12 and the side of the I/O connector 14 facing the cover 11 are provided with ribs 19 and the case 12 and the cover 11 are provided with recesses 20, 21 to receive the ribs and further the side of the case 12 facing the external terminal 29 of the<br><br>
I/O connector and the side of the cover 11 facing the external terminal 29 of the I/O connector are provided with ribs 22, 23.<br>
As a result, received sounds leaked from the receiver via a gap in the body of the portable radio apparatus are interrupted by the rib 19 on the side of the I/O connector facing the case 12. In case received sounds are not perfectly interrupted, the rib 23 provided on the cover 11 can interrupt received sounds leaked from the I/O connector 14, thereby preventing echoes.<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view of portable radio apparatus showing another configuration of an echo suppression mechanism according to the embodiment of the invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the body of portable radio apparatus is composed of a cover 11 and a case 12, and comprises a battery hook 26 to lock batteries 18 when the batteries 18 are being received in a battery receiver 17 provided in the case 12 . Fig. 2 differs from the conventional configuration in Fig. 4 in that the part of the case at the receiver side of the battery hook 26 is provided with a rib 28, In Fig. 2, the rib 28 extends to the shield case 27.<br>
Via the rib 28, it is possible to interrupt received sounds coming from a receiver and reaching a transmitter (microphone) 15 via space within a body, thereby preventing echoes -<br><br>
While not shown, portable radio apparatus equipped with echo suppression mechanisms in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 will further prevent echoes.<br>
Fig. 3 is a cross-sectional view of portable radio apparatus simultaneously employing the aspects of the invention of Figs. 1 and 2. As shown on the left of Fig. 3, received sounds propagated from a receiver (speaker) which is not shown are interrupted by the rib 28. In case received sounds are not perfectly interrupted or there are received sounds propagated via some space in a body, receiving signals trying to slip beside the I/O connector 14 are interrupted by the rib 19 and the recess or by the rib and the I/O connector 14, as shown on the right of Fig. 3.<br>

This configuration has an advantage that the space<br><br>
between the I/O connector and the case can be made into<br>
refracted space in order to interrupt received sounds<br>
propagated from a receiver via space within a body, thereby<br>
preventing echoes.<br>
The second aspect of the invention is, in portable radio<br>
apparatus whose body is composed of a cover and a case, an I/O<br>
connector provided on a printed circuit board is sandwiched<br>
between the cover and the case, an echo suppression mechanism<br>
characterized in that the side of the case facing the external<br>
terminal of the I/O connector and the side of the cover facing<br>
the external terminal of the I/O connector are provided with<br>
ribs in order to interrupt received sounds coming from a<br>
receiver and reaching a transmitter via space within the body,<br>
thereby preventing echoes.   This configuration has an<br>
advantage that the space between the I/O connector and the case<br>
can be made into refracted space in order to interrupt received<br>
sounds propagated from a receiver via space within a body,<br>
thereby preventing echoes.<br>
The third aspect of the invention is, in portable radio apparatus whose body is composed of a cover and a case, an I/O connector provided on a printed circuit board is sandwiched between the cover and the case, an echo suppression mechanism characterized in that the side of the I/O connector facing the case and the side of the I/O connector facing the cover are provided with ribs and the case and the cover are provided with<br><br>
recesses to receive the ribs and further the side of the case facing the external terminal of the I/O connector and the side of the cover facing the external terminal of the I/O connector are provided with ribs in order to interrupt received sounds coming from a receiver and reaching a transmitter via space in the body, thereby preventing echoes.  This configuration has an advantage of interrupting received sounds propagated from a receiver via space in a body, thereby preventing echoes. The fourth aspect of the invention is, in portable radio apparatus whose body is composed of a cover and a case, the portable radio apparatus adapted to comprise a battery hook to lock batteries when the batteries are being received in a battery receiver provided in the case, an echo suppression mechanism characterized in that the part of the case at the receiver side of the battery hook is provided with a rib in order to interrupt received sounds coming from a receiver and reaching a transmitter via space in the body,. thereby preventing echoes.  This configuration has an advantage of interrupting received sounds propagated from a receiver via space in a body, thereby preventing echoes.<br>
The fifth aspect of the invention is portable radio apparatus comprising an echo suppression mechanism according to any one of the first through fourth aspects of the invention. Because the portable radio apparatus comprises an echo suppression mechanism according to any one of the first through<br><br>
fourth aspects of the invention, this configuration has an advantage of providing portable radio apparatus capable of suppressing echoes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
