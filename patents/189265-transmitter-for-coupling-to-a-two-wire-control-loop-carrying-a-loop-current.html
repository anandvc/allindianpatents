TRANSMITTER WITH ELECTRICAL CIRCUITRY FOR INHIBITING DISCHARGE OF STORED ENERGY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to transmitters for use in process control loops.  More specifically, the present invention relates to isolating transmitter circuitry from the control loop.<br>
Process control systems are used in manufacturing plants to monitor operation of a process. A transmitter is placed in the field and monitors a variable of the process, for example, pressure, temperature or flow. The transmitter couples to a control loop and transmits information over the control loop to a controller which monitors operation of the process. The control loop is a two-wire loop carrying a current which provides power for operation of the transmitter. Communication is through a fieldbus standard which is a digital communications standard in which more than one transmitter can be coupled to a single control loop to transmit the sensed process variable to the control room. This standard is described in ISA 50.02-1992 Section 11. HARTÂ® is another standard which allows digital communication over a 4-20 mA process variable signal.<br>
Circuitry in the transmitter presents an effective capacitance Ceff to the control loop. Charge may build up on this capacitance causing the transmitter to store energy across its connections to the loop. This energy may discharge through the loop. In the fieldbus protocol, multiple transmitters are attached to the same loop so that the combined Ce may be particularly large. Attempts have been made to reduce the size of Ceff and thereby reduce the amount of potential energy storage capacity of the transmitter.<br><br>
Additionally, Ceff varies between transmitters. Thus, the interchange of transmitters is limited.<br>
It would be desirable to isolate the capacitance of the transmitter from the control loop. This would prevent energy discharge into the loop and provide greater interchangeability between transmitters regardless of their internal Ccff.<br>
A two-wire transmitter couples to a control loop carrying a loop current The transmitter senses a process variable and provides an electrical representation thereof to the loop. Circuitry in the transmitter presents an effective capacitance Ceff if connected directly to the control loop. The transmitter includes a capacitance isolating network, coupled to the circuitry and to the control loop, which inhibits discharge of energy stored by the effective capacitance Ceff into the control loop. In one embodiment, the isolating network comprises at least three diodes connected in series in the direction of current flow of loop current.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a transmitter for coupling to a two-wire control loop carrying a loop current, comprising a sensor for sensing a variable of a process; measuring circuitry coupled to the sensor providing a transmitter output related to the process variable, the measurement circuitry powered with the loop current and presenting an effective capacitance Ceff; and a capacitance isolation network operably coupled between the measurement circuitry and the control loop, the isolation network being characterised by four rectifying elements connected in a full wave bridge rectifier having input terminals connected to the control loop and an output terminal coupled to a fifth rectifying element which is connected to the measurement circuitry such that the loop current flows through three of the five rectifying elements simultaneously and inhibits discharge through the control loop of cnergy stored in Ceff.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"<br>
FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram of transmitter 10 in accordance with the present invention. Transmitter 10 includes sensor 12 and sensor electronics 14 which couples to control loop 16. Electronics 14 include measurement circuitry 18 and capacitance isolation circuitry 20. Measurement circuitry 18 includes processing circuitry 22 and interface circuitry 24.<br>
Transmitter 10 is powered through electric current I which is received from control loop 16 which causes a voltage drop across transmitter 10. The voltage drop is typically between 9 and 35 volts. In one embodiment, control loop 16 operates under the fieldbus protocol and carries digital information. Sensor 12 senses a process variable which is related to a parameter of the process, such as temperature, pressure, or flow. Processing circuitry 22 processes the process variable. For example, processing circuitry 22 may correct for errors in the sensor or perform other calculations on the process variable. Processing circuitry 22 is coupled to interface circuitry 24 and controls interface circuitry 24 to transmit the process variable over control loop 16. In one embodiment, interface circuitry 24 receives digital instructions over loop 16 which control operation of processing<br><br>
circuitry 22. Further, interface circuitry 24 includes a power supply output which powers processing circuitry 22 and other circuitry in transmitter 10.<br>
Loop current I flows through interface circuity 24. Electronics 14 includes components which have resistance, capacitance and inductance. These components present an effective capacitance Ceff to loop 16. FIG. 1 shows the effective capacitance ceff across measurement circuitry 18. Ceff is presented to capacitance isolation circuitry 20 in accordance with the invention.<br>
In operation, interface 24 transmits digital information related to an output from sensor 12 through loop 16 in response to a transmit data request, whereby a parameter sensed by sensor 12, or other data, is transmitted over loop 16. In prior art systems, energy stored in capacitance Ceff could be discharged through loop 16. In the present invention, capacitance isolation circuitry 12 isolates capacitance Ceff from loop 16 to prevent this discharge. However, capacitance isolation circuitry 20 does not interfere with operation of measurement circuitry 18, allowing loop current I to flow and digital information to be exchanged.<br>
FIGS. 2 through 5 show various configurations of capacitance isolation circuitry 20. In FIGS. 2 through 5, the effective capacitance and resistance of measurement circuitry 18 are modeled as capacitor Ceff and resistor Reff, respectfully. In FIG, 2, isolation circuitry 20 includes diodes 30, 32 and 34. Diodes 30 through 34 are connected in the direction of current flow I and placed in series with loop 16. Diodes 30 through 34 prevent a discharge of energy stored in capacitance Ceff through loop 16 by blocking current flow through loop 16 against the flow of current I.  The use<br><br>
of three diodes 30 through 34 provides three levels of redundancy. Any two of diodes 30 through 34 may fail and the remaining diode will prevent energy discharge.<br>
FIG. 3 shows another embodiment of isolation circuitry 20. In FIG. 3, isolation circuitry 20 includes diodes 40, 42 and 44 connected in series with loop 16 in the direction of current flow, as current I enters transmitter 10. Circuitry 20 also includes diodes 46, 48 and 50 connected in series in the direction of current flow as current I exits transmitter 10. In FIG. 3, isolation circuitry 20 also includes RF filter capacitors 52 and 54 which capacitively couple the current loop to electrical ground. Typically, capacitors 52 and 54 are set in a center wall 56 of transmitter 10 and have a value of about 2,000 pF. In operation, capacitors 52 and 54 provide an electrical short to ground for high frequency RF signals which interfere with operation of measurement circuitry 18. Isolation circuitry 20 includes two sets of isolation diodes. This prevents discharge of energy in capacitance CEFF into loop 16 through a path through electrical ground and capacitor 52 or capacitor 54 in situations where one wire of loop 16 is grounded. Again, three levels of redundance are provided by using two sets of three diodes each (40, 42 and 44 or 4 6, 48 and 50), one set for either path. Discharge could occur if either capacitor 52 or 54 failed and provided an electrical path to ground which is typically the chassis of the transmitter (not shown in FIG. 3).<br>
FIG. 4 shows another embodiment of capacitive isolation circuit 20 which includes only three diodes 60, 62 and 64 to achieve the desired isolation. Diodes 60, 62 and 64 are connected in series in the direction of loop current flow I along the incoming path of the<br><br><br><br>
FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view of transmitter 10 showing the relative position of circuitry 22 and 24 and center wall 56. FIG. 6 shows transmitter body 100 which is divided into a first chamber 101a and a second chamber 101b by center wall 56. First chamber 101a is sealed by end cap 102 and second chamber 101b is sealed by end cap 104. First chamber 101a carries processing and interface circuitry 22/24. RF filter capacitors 52 and 54 are positioned in center wall 56 and coupled to a circuit board which carries bridge rectifier 70. A circuit board 110 is carried in second chamber 101b and includes terminals which couple to current loop 16 and which enter housing 100 through conduit 108. Circuit board 110 includes resistors 66 and 68. Transmitter housing 100 is attached to sensor housing 106 which carries sensor 12 (not shown in FIG. 6). As shown in FIG. 6, capacitors 52 and 54 allow current I to enter circuitry in first chamber 101a but filter high frequency RF interference. Bridge 70 and diode 80 prevent discharge of energy stored in circuitry 22/24 back into current loop 16, as explained above. The particular transmitter 10 shown in FIG. 6 is for measuring a differential pressure.<br>
The diodes should be selected to provide a low forward voltage drop, for example Schottky barrier diodes. It is desirable to select diodes for bridge rectifier 7 0 which provide low reverse current leakage to reduce apparent transmitter current. In a preferred embodiment, the diodes of bridge rectifier 70 and diode 80 are Schottky barrier diodes. Diode 80 should be selected to provide linearity through its operating range. Because diode 80 is in only one "leg" of the path of current I, non-linearities may cause signal distortion.  In one embodiment, diode 80 has a large<br><br>
current capacity (for example, 30 amps) so that the voltage drop is small at the low current levels of a two-wire transmitter (4-20 mA) . However, there is a trade-off between forward voltage drop and leakage current.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the invention can be used in a central controller, field mounted controller, configuration device (such as a hand-held unit), modem or other device which couples to the two-wire current loop. Additionally, isolation elements other than diodes, such as FETs, could be used.<br><br><br>
