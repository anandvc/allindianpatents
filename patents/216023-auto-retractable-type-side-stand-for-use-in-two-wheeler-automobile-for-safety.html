PROVISIONS<br>
The following specification describes the Invention.<br><br>
COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
4. DESCRIPTION (Description starts from page 2)<br>
5.	CLAIMS:        Given on a separate page<br>
6.	DATE AND SIGNATURE: Given at the end of last page of specification.<br>
7.	ABSTRACT OF THE INVENTION: Given on separate page<br><br>
The present invention relates to an auto - retractable type side stand for use in two wheeler automobiles which enables the rider to drive in comfortable situation without any care about the position of the side stand. The purpose of the invention is to move the stand automatically from its ON position to its original room position in order to provide safety to the rider and thereby protecting the rider from the rnjshaps.<br>
The present invention is directed to provide optimum convenience to the rider and is designed especiQHy to achieve overall ergonomics of the vehicle. The object of this invention is to provide for auto - retractable stand that has been conceptualized and developed to take care of the side stand retraction to its normal position when the rider engages the first gear or any other gear. The mechanism is so developed as to provide safety, convenience and tension free drive to the rider.<br>
In prior art, auto retractable side stand was not conceptualized. The existing side stand has an electrical switch by which an indicator bulb glows on the dashboard indicating that the side stand is active. If the rider has to ride the vehicle, he has to switch ON the ignition key. At this time side stand indicator bulb shows that the side stand is in ON position. Thus the rider can fold the side stand from its ON to OFF position. At this time the electrical contact is open due to the plunger getting released and the indicator bulb is OFF. Thus giving a safety hint to the rider.<br>
These side stands have following deficiencies:<br>
1.	If there is a loose connection in the circuit, it fails to show the indication on the cjashboard.<br>
2.	If the battery is dead , it fails to show the indication.<br>
3.	If the bulb is fused then also it fails to show the indication.<br><br><br>
4.	That before taking the vehicle for ride, the rider has to fold the side stand manually.<br>
5.	That due to short circuit especially in rainy season the system becomes non-operational.<br>
6.	In cases where the switch is non-operational by the reason of dust accumulation, it fails to show the indication.<br>
7.	In most of the cases the switch position is not positive and it differs from vehicle to vehicle and therefore needs adjustments and proper fastening.<br>
With the view to overcome these and other similar shortcomings of the prior art, the present invention is thought. The present invention comprises of lever or cam type auto retractable side stand depending on the gearshift pattern of the vehicle (Refer Fig. 1 and 2)<br>
lever type auto retractable side stand for toe side of gear shifting arrangement; ( Reference to Fig 1)<br>
The Main Parts of the mechanism are as follows:<br>
1.	Front Foot Rest<br>
2.	Gear Shift Lever<br>
3.	First Lever<br>
4.	Second Lever<br>
5.	Pivot Pin<br>
6.	Slider plate<br>
7.	Side Stand Bracket<br>
8.	Tension Spring<br>
9.	Side Stand<br><br>
The input comes from the rider, when rider takes the vehicle from the parked position and engages any gear by means of foot with the help of front footrest (1). The force is applied for gear engagement on gearshift lever (2), which is mounted on the engine"s gearshift shaft to vary the speed and torque by changing the gears. It is used to actuate the first lever (3) or second lever (4) depending upon which gear has been engaged. The function of these levers is to oscUiate in clockwise or anfi clockwise direction while in operation. The first lever (3) transfers the force, if lower gear is engaged and if higher gear is engaged the second lever (4) transfers the force. This force is transferred to the slider plate (6), which is welded on the side stand (9) and its working is based on leverage principle about the Pivot Pin (5). The first lever is hinged at the pivot pin. The pivot pin is mounted on the side stand bracket (7). The second lever (4) is attached to gearshift lever (2). The position and length of the slider plate (6) is configured in such a way that the side stand (9) is released from its room position in one gearshift travel. Thus the required transfer is achieved and the side stand (9) which holds the vehicle on ground on left side and prevent the vehicle to fall and move, takes its room position by virtue of the tension spring (8) used to position the side stand when the stand is in its off condition and pulls the side stand from on condition and retains it to off condition and keeps the side stand (9) in its room position.<br>
Cam type auto retractable side stand for heel side of gear shifting arrangement: (Fig 2)<br>
The Main Parts of the mechanism are as follows<br>
1.	Front Foot Rest<br>
2.	Gear Shift Lever<br>
3.	Cam Bracket<br>
4.	Pivot Pin<br><br>
5.	Slider Plate<br>
6.	Side Stand Bracket<br>
7.	Tension Spring<br>
8.	Side Stand<br>
The input comes from the rider, when rider takes the vehicle from the parked position and engages any gear by means of gearshift lever (2), which is mounted on the engine"s gearshift shaft as one of the controls for varying the speed by changing the gears. It is used to actuate the gearshift lever (2) by foot with help of front footrest (1). This force is used to actuate the cam bracket (3) mounted on the side stand bracket (6), the said side stand bracket is welded on the chassis of the vehicle. Based on the force transferred from the gearshift lever and necessary leverage about the pivot pin (4), the position and length of the slider plate (5) and cam bracket is configured in such a way that the side stand (8) is released from its room position in one gearshift travel by means of subsequent transfer of sliding force on the slider plate (5) by the cam bracket. Thus the required transfer is achieved and the side stand (8), which holds the vehicle on ground on left side and prevents the vehicle to fall and move, takes its room position by virtue of the tension spring (7). The said spring retains the lever in its idle position and damps the lever when vehicle is in motion.<br>
In the present invention, levers / cams are used to fold the side stand from its ON position by dividing a part of the force used for gear engagement. These levers/cams transfer the necessary force based on leverage principle to achieve auto-retraction. The novelty lies in the invention of lever and cam operating on pivot and the way it is related to the gearshift lever and side stand. The novelty lies in the leverage as such<br><br>
kind of arrangement has not been conceptualized and developed till date. The input comes from the rider when the rider takes of the vehicle by engaging the first or any lower gear from the top gear. Side stand is used while parking the vehicle on roadside. Most of the riders forget to fold the side stand while taking off the vehicle for a ride. This Mechanism is in TOE side and HEEL side of the gear shifting arrangement depending on the gearshift pattern of the vehicle respectively.<br>
Advantages:<br>
1)	Side stand takes it"s room position automatically even if rider has forgotten to fold the side stand and thereby relieves the rider from operating the side stand manually .<br>
2)	No need to pay attention to side stand indicator on dashboard.<br>
3)	No problem in rainy season.<br>
4)	No need for dust protection.<br>
5)	Free from maintenance<br>
6)	The performance of the mechanism is unaffected even though the battery is dead.<br>
7)	The loose connection in the circuit does not in any way affect the performance of the mechanism.<br>
8)	It"s performance is also unaffected, if the bulb gets fused.<br><br>
