Title of Invention:<br>
METHACRYLIC RESIN, MOLDED ARTICLE THEREOF, AND METHOD FOR<br>
PRODUCING METHACRYLIC RESIN<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a methacrylic resin,<br>
a molded article thereof, and a method for producing a<br>
methacrylic resin.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Methacrylic resins, represented by poly(methyl<br>
methacrylate) (PMMA), are used in a wide variety of<br>
fields due to their high transparency, such as optical<br>
materials, automotive parts, building materials, lenses,<br>
household goods, OA equipment, and lighting devices.<br>
Especially, recently their use in automotive<br>
applications and optical materials such as light guide<br>
plates and films for liquid crystal displays is<br>
progressing, and there are increasing expectations for<br>
applications that were said to be difficult to carry out<br>
molding and processing with conventional methacrylic<br>
resins.<br>
 <br>
For example, when injection molding a large-size,<br>
thin molded article, if the fluidity of the resin is poor,<br>
molding will be impossible due to insufficient injection<br>
pressure, and distortion of the molded article will<br>
increase. Consequently, a high fluidity that allows<br>
molding is desirable even if the injection pressure is<br>
low. On the other hand, there is a need for further<br>
improvement in solvent resistance and mechanical strength<br>
while maintaining the colorless transparency that<br>
methacrylic resins have and the processability of the<br>
obtained resins.<br>
[0003]<br>
Conventionally, generally known methods for<br>
improving the mechanical strength and molding properties<br>
of a methacrylic resin have included conferring fluidity<br>
with a low molecular weight methacrylic resin, and<br>
conferring mechanical strength with a methacrylic resin<br>
having a high molecular weight or a densely crosslinked<br>
structure.<br>
Reports related to this have included a technology<br>
that melt-mixes a high molecular weight and a low<br>
molecular weight methacrylic resin (e.g., Patent document<br>
1), a technology that co-polymerizes a methacrylic resin<br>
formed by a low molecular weight methacrylic resin with a<br>
large amount of another vinyl monomer (e.g., Patent<br>
document 2), a technology that enlarges the molecular<br>
 <br>
weight distribution by producing a densely cross-linked<br>
methacrylic resin using a polyfunctional monomer (e.g.,<br>
Patent document 3), and a technology that, while<br>
maintaining mechanical strength, improves fluidity as<br>
compared to a conventional methacrylic resin by using a<br>
multistage polymerization method (e.g., Patent document<br>
4) .<br>

Summary of Invention<br>
Problems To Be Solved By The Invention<br>
[0005]<br>
However, in the invention described in Patent<br>
document 1, two methacrylic resins having different<br>
molecular weights are separately polymerized and mixed.<br>
Consequently, there is the problem of unevenness in the<br>
molecular weight at some portions due to insufficient<br>
mixing, so that the strands are unstable during extrusion.<br>
 <br>
[0006]<br>
Further, in the invention described in Patent<br>
document 2, the fluidity of the obtained methacrylic<br>
resin is not sufficient. Thus, there is the problem that<br>
if the amount of the other vinyl monomer that is<br>
copolymerizable with methyl methacrylate is increased in<br>
order to improve fluidity, heat resistance and mechanical<br>
strength tend to deteriorate, so that a good balance<br>
among fluidity, mechanical strength, and heat resistance<br>
cannot be conferred.<br>
[0007]<br>
In addition, in the invention described in Patent<br>
document 3, there is the problem that if the<br>
polyfunctional monomer amount is too large, mixing<br>
uniformity deteriorates, so that the appearance of the<br>
molded article deteriorates, while if the polyfunctional<br>
monomer amount is too small, the effects of an<br>
improvement in fluidity and maintaining mechanical<br>
strength are not exhibited, and yet control of the<br>
polyfunctional monomer is very difficult.<br>
[0008]<br>
Still further, in the invention described in Patent<br>
document 4, although the fluidity of the obtained polymer<br>
is good, the specific surface area of the resin obtained<br>
by polymerization tends to increase, and electrical<br>
charge due to static electricity tends to occur.<br>
 <br>
Moreover, the angle of repose of the resin particles<br>
obtained by polymerization is large, so that when the<br>
resin is charged into a hopper during an extrusion or<br>
molding operation, the polymer is not stably added. This<br>
can cause problems such as the extruded strands breaking<br>
or the resin not being able to be added unless the hopper<br>
is hit in a suitable manner or subjected to some other<br>
shock. Further, agglomerates derived from the resin<br>
particles adhering to each other, for example, can form.<br>
If the amount of agglomerates increases, not only does<br>
this cause the yield to decrease, but can also lead to<br>
other problems such as productivity decreasing due to<br>
blockages caused by the agglomerates clogging up the<br>
insides of the pipes and a deterioration in the color hue<br>
of the obtained resin.<br>
[0009]<br>
In view of the above-described problems in the<br>
conventional art, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a methacrylic resin that has<br>
excellent colorless transparency, high fluidity of a melt<br>
resin, high impact resistance, and solvent resistance, as<br>
well as having a low agglomerate content and a small<br>
angle of repose of the resin particles.<br>

weight, and peak molecular weight of a sample of the<br>
methacrylic resin, which is the measurement target, can<br>
be determined.<br>
The methacrylic resin according to the present<br>
embodiment has a weight average molecular weight measured<br>
 <br>
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of 60,000 to<br>
300,000. Methacrylic resins in this range have excellent<br>
mechanical strength, solvent resistance, and fluidity.<br>
More preferred is 60,000 to 250,000, and still more<br>
preferred is 70,000 to 230,000.<br>
[0026]<br>
Considering the balance among fluidity, mechanical<br>
strength, and solvent resistance, the molecular weight<br>
distribution (weight average molecular weight / number<br>
average molecular weight: Mw / Mn) is preferably 2.1 or<br>
more and 7 or less. More preferred is 2.1 or more and 6<br>
or less, still more preferred is 2.2 or more and 5 or<br>
less, and even more preferred is 2.2 or more and 4.5 or<br>
less.<br>
[0027]<br>
(Methacrylic resin peak molecular weight)<br>
To improve the processing fluidity during molding of<br>
the methacrylic resin according to the present embodiment,<br>
and to obtain a good plasticizing effect, the content of<br>
the molecular weight component that is 1/5 or less the<br>
peak molecular weight (Mp) present in the methacrylic<br>
resin is preferably 7 to 40%. More preferred is 7 to 35%,<br>
still more preferred is 8 to 35%, and even more preferred<br>
is 8 to 30%.<br>
The content of the molecular weight component that<br>
is 1/5 or less the peak molecular weight (Mp) can be<br>
 <br>
determined based on the ratio of the region area obtained<br>
from a GPC elution curve.<br>
It is preferred that the content of the methacrylic<br>
resin component having a molecular weight of 500 or less<br>
is small, because such a methacrylic resin component<br>
tends to produce bubble-like appearance defects known as<br>
"silver streaks" during molding.<br>
Here, the peak molecular weight (Mp) refers to the<br>
molecular weight indicating a peak in the GPC calibration<br>
curve.<br>
If there are a plurality of peaks in the GPC<br>
calibration curve, the peak molecular weight is the peak<br>
indicating the greatest content.<br>
A specific method for determining the peak molecular<br>
weight (Mp) of the GPC calibration curve will now be<br>
described.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an example of a cumulative<br>
region area on a GPC calibration curve measurement graph<br>
of a methacrylic resin. The vertical axis of the graph<br>
represents the RI (differential refraction) detection<br>
intensity (mV), the lower part of the horizontal axis of<br>
the graph represents the elution time (minutes), and the<br>
upper part represents the cumulative region area (%)<br>
based on the total GPC region area.<br>
First, in Figure 2, a point A and a point B, where a<br>
baseline automatically drawn by the measurement device<br>
 <br>
intersects with the GPC elution curve, are determined for<br>
a GPC elution curve obtained from the elution time<br>
obtained by GPC measurement and the detection intensity<br>
from the RI (differential refraction detector).<br>
Point A is the point where the GPC elution curve at<br>
the start of elution intersects the baseline.<br>
Point B is, in principle, a position where the<br>
baseline and the GPC elution curve intersect at a<br>
molecular weight of 500 or more. If there is no<br>
intersection for the range in which the molecular weight<br>
is 500 or more, point B is set as the value of the RI<br>
detection intensity at the elution time when the<br>
molecular weight is 500.<br>
The shaded portion enclosed by the GPC elution curve<br>
between points A and B and the line segment AB is the<br>
region of the GPC elution curve. This area is the region<br>
area of the GPC elution curve.<br>
The GPC elution curve shown in Figure 2 was plotted<br>
using a column in which elution proceeded from the high<br>
molecular weight component. Further, the high molecular<br>
weight component is observed at the start of elution, and<br>
the low molecular weight component is observed at the end<br>
of elution.<br>
In Figure 2, the value obtained by converting the<br>
elution time at the position corresponding to the peak<br>
 <br>
top of the GPC elution curve measurement graph into a<br>
molecular weight is the peak molecular weight (Mp).<br>
[0028]<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a specific example of the<br>
cumulative region area (%) under the GPC elution curve.<br>
The cumulative region area (%) of the region area of<br>
the GPC elution curve is considered to be formed by<br>
adding up the detection intensities corresponding to the<br>
respective elution times heading toward the finish of the<br>
elution time, in which point A in Figure 3 is a<br>
cumulative region area (%) reference of 0%.<br>
In Figure 3, point X is a point on the baseline and<br>
point Y is a point on the GPC elution curve at a given<br>
elution time. The ratio of the area enclosed by the<br>
curve AY, line segment AX, and line segment XY to the<br>
region area of the GPC elution curve is taken as the<br>
value of the cumulative region area (%) at a given<br>
elution time.<br>
[0029]<br>
The average composition ratio of the other vinyl<br>
monomer unit which is copolymerizable with a methacrylic<br>
acid ester in the methacrylic resin having a molecular<br>
weight component for which the cumulative region area of<br>
the GPC elution curve of the methacrylic resin according<br>
to the present invention is 0 to 2% will be referred to<br>
as Mh (% by mass). On the other hand, the average<br>
 <br>
composition ratio of the other vinyl monomer unit which<br>
is copolymerizable with a methacrylic acid ester in the<br>
methacrylic resin having a cumulative region area of 98<br>
to 100%, i.e., the low molecular weight, will be referred<br>
to as Ml (% by mass). Figure 4 illustrates a schematic<br>
diagram of the positions in the measurement graph of the<br>
0 to 2% and the 98 to 100% cumulative region areas.<br>
The Mh and Ml values can be determined by<br>
consecutively sampling several times or several dozen<br>
times the elution time obtained from GPC based on the<br>
size of the column.<br>
The sampling number may be selected based on the<br>
level of the gas chromatography that can be applied.<br>
Generally, if the column is large, the amount that is<br>
collected in one go decreases. The composition of the<br>
obtained samples may be analyzed by a known pyrolysis gas<br>
chromatography method.<br>
In the methacrylic resin according to the present<br>
embodiment, it is preferred that the average composition<br>
ratio Mh (% by mass) of the other vinyl monomer unit<br>
which is copolymerizable with a methacrylic acid ester in<br>
the methacrylic resin having a molecular weight component<br>
for which the cumulative region area of the GPC elution<br>
curve is 0 to 2% and the average composition ratio (Ml)<br>
(% by mass) of the other vinyl monomer unit which is<br>
copolymerizable with a methacrylic acid ester in the<br>
 <br>
methacrylic resin having a cumulative region area of 98<br>
to 100%, i.e., low molecular weight, satisfy the<br>
relationship of the following expression (1):<br>
(Mh - 0.8) ≥ Ml ≥ 0 ... (1)<br>
The above expression (1) illustrates that the high<br>
molecular weight component has a higher average<br>
composition of the other vinyl monomer which is<br>
copolymerizable with a methacrylic acid ester than the<br>
low molecular weight component by at least is 0.8 % by<br>
mass, and that the other vinyl monomer does not have to<br>
be copolymerized with the low molecular weight component.<br>
[0030]<br>
To improve fluidity, it is preferred that the<br>
difference between Mh (% by mass) and Ml (% by mass) is<br>
0.8 % by mass or more. More preferred is 1.0 % by mass<br>
or more, and still more preferred is if the following<br>
expression (2) holds true:<br>
(Mh - 2) ≥ Ml ≥ 0 ... (2)<br>
Specifically, it is preferred to set the average<br>
composition of the other vinyl monomer unit which is<br>
copolymerizable with a methacrylic acid ester of the<br>
methacrylic resin in the high molecular weight component<br>
2 % by mass or more greater than the average composition<br>
of the low molecular weight component, because a dramatic<br>
improvement in fluidity can be obtained while maintaining<br>
heat resistance, a low incidence of cracks and molded<br>
 <br>
article distortion under environmental testing, and<br>
mechanical strength.<br>
[0031]<br>
(Content of component having molecular weight of 10,000<br>
or less in methacrylic resin)<br>
From the perspectives of improving processing<br>
fluidity and reducing appearance defects in a molded<br>
article known as silver streaks during molding, for<br>
example, it is preferred that the content of the<br>
component having a molecular weight of 10,000 or less in<br>
the methacrylic resin according to the present embodiment<br>
is 1 % or more and 10% or less based on the region area<br>
ratio obtained from the GPC elution curve.<br>
By setting this content to 1% or more, the<br>
processing fluidity can be improved, and by setting this<br>
content to 10% or less, appearance defects such as silver<br>
streaks during molding can be reduced.<br>
For example, in Figure 3, when point X is on the<br>
baseline at the elution time where the molecular weight<br>
is 10,000, and point Y is on that GPC elution curve, the<br>
content of the component having a molecular weight of<br>
10,000 or less can be obtained by determining the ratio<br>
of the area enclosed by the curve BY, line segment BX,<br>
and line segment XY with respect to the region area of<br>
the GPC elution curve.<br>
[0032]<br>
 <br>
(Angle of repose of the methacrylic resin)<br>
The methacrylic resin according to the present<br>
embodiment preferably has an angle of repose of 20 to 40°.<br>
If the angle of repose is in this range, during extrusion<br>
processing and molding, it is easier for the screw to<br>
bite into the methacrylic resin, and the methacrylic<br>
resin becomes very easy to handle. If the angle of<br>
repose is less than 20°, friction among the particles is<br>
too small, so that ease with which the resin is bitten<br>
into by the screw tends to deteriorate, which can cause<br>
plasticization stability to deteriorate. If this value<br>
exceeds 40°, problems such as pipe blockages in the<br>
production equipment and measurement precision defects<br>
tend to occur, and handling deteriorates. The angle of<br>
repose is more preferably 35° or less, still more<br>
preferably 33° or less, and even more preferably 30° or<br>
less.<br>
[0033]<br>
(Methacrylic resin yellowness index difference)<br>
The yellowness index (AYI) difference of the<br>
methacrylic resin according to the present embodiment can<br>
be obtained using the following equation, using 4 test<br>
pieces 3 mm thick, 20 mm wide, and 220 mm long laminated<br>
over each other, by measuring YI (yellowness index) in<br>
the 220 mm length direction based on JIS T7105 (plastic<br>
optical characteristics test method) using the<br>
 <br>
colorimeter TC-8600A manufactured by Nippon Denshoku<br>
Industries Co., Ltd.<br>
AYI represents the degree of yellowing in a molded<br>
article. A smaller value indicates less yellowing.<br>
Yellowness index difference AYI = YI - YIO<br>
AYI = Yellowness index difference<br>
YI = Molded article yellowness index<br>
YIO = Air yellowness index<br>
The methacrylic resin according to the present<br>
embodiment preferably has a yellowness index difference<br>
as measured under the above-described conditions of 30 or<br>
less, more preferably 25 or less, still more preferably<br>
22 or less, and even more preferably 20 or less.<br>
[0034]<br>
(Methacrylic resin average particle size)<br>
From the perspective of handleability, the<br>
methacrylic resin according to the present embodiment<br>
preferably has an average particle size of 0.1 mm to 10.0<br>
mm. More preferred is 0.1 to 3.0 mm, still more<br>
preferred is 0.1 to 1.0 mm, even more preferred is 0.15<br>
to 0.80 mm, still even more preferred is 0.16 to 0.70 mm,<br>
and especially preferred is 0.2 to 0.7 mm.<br>
The average particle size can be obtained by, for<br>
example, classifying the particles using a sieve based on<br>
JIS-Z8801, measuring the weight distribution thereof,<br>
creating a particle distribution based on the weight<br>
 <br>
distribution, and calculating the particle size<br>
corresponding to 50 % by mass from this particle size<br>
distribution as the average particle size.<br>
The shape of the particles is preferably, for<br>
example, a cylindrical, roughly spherical, or tablet<br>
shape. From the perspective of handleability and<br>
uniformity, a roughly spherical shape is preferred.<br>
[0035]<br>
If the methacrylic resin includes a large amount of<br>
fine particles having a particle size of less than 0.15<br>
mm, handleability deteriorates due to a tendency for the<br>
fine particles to float around during handling.<br>
Therefore, if handleability needs to be especially good,<br>
it is preferred to reduce this content by a certain<br>
extent.<br>
However, it is not desirable to remove all of the<br>
fine particles of less than 0.15 mm, because the number<br>
of processing steps, such as sieving and removing,<br>
increases. Therefore, a certain amount is permitted.<br>
From the above perspectives, it is preferred that<br>
the content of the components having a particle size less<br>
than 0.15 mm is 0.01 % by mass or more and 10 % by mass<br>
or less. More preferred is 0.1 % by mass or more and<br>
10 % by mass or less, still more preferred is 0.1 % by<br>
mass or more and 8 % by mass or less, even more preferred<br>
is 0.2 % by mass or more and 7 % by mass or less, and<br>
 <br>
still even more preferred is 0.3 % by mass or more and<br>
6 % by mass or less.<br>
The content of the components having a particle size<br>
of less than 0.15 mm can be determined by, for example,<br>
dividing the amount remaining on the pan by the amount<br>
originally placed on the sieve when sieving for 10<br>
minutes at maximum vibration output using a sieve based<br>
on JIS-Z8801, a JTS-200-45-33 (500 \xm apertures), 34 (425<br>
|jm apertures), 35 (355 (am apertures), 36 (300 \m<br>
apertures), 37 (250 \xm apertures), 38 (150 [im apertures),<br>
and 61 (pan), and also the test sieve shaker TSK-B-1,<br>
manufactured by Tokyo Screen.<br>
Examples of a method for reducing particles having a<br>
particle size of less than 0.15 mm include sieving the<br>
obtained methacrylic resin with a sieve having apertures<br>
of 0.15 mm or more and using the resin remaining on the<br>
sieve, and reducing the amount of particles less than<br>
0.15 mm by using a centrifugal separator equipped with a<br>
mesh having apertures of 0.15 mm or more.<br>
By using the polymerization method according to the<br>
present invention, the content of particles having a<br>
particle size of less than 0.15 mm can be reduced without<br>
performing the above-described operations.<br>
[0036]<br>
[Methacrylic Resin Production Method]<br>
 <br>
Methods for producing the above-described<br>
methacrylic resin according to the present embodiment<br>
will now be described. However, the method for producing<br>
the methacrylic resin according to the present embodiment<br>
is not limited to the following methods.<br>
The methacrylic resin according to the present<br>
embodiment can be produced by bulk polymerization,<br>
solution polymerization, suspension polymerization, and<br>
emulsion polymerization. It is preferred to use bulk<br>
polymerization, solution polymerization, or suspension<br>
polymerization, more preferred to use solution<br>
polymerization or suspension polymerization, and still<br>
more preferred to use suspension polymerization.<br>
Specific examples of the method for producing the<br>
methacrylic resin according to the present embodiment<br>
include the following.<br>
(First Method)<br>
A predetermined amount of a polymer (I) having a<br>
predetermined weight average molecular weight (e.g.,<br>
5,000 to 50,000) is produced in advance. A predetermined<br>
amount of this polymer (I) is mixed with a raw material<br>
composition mixture of a polymer (II) having a weight<br>
average molecular weight different from polymer (I) (e.g.,<br>
60,000 to 350,000), and the resultant mixed solution is<br>
polymerized.<br>
(Second Method)<br>
 <br>
A polymer (I) having a predetermined weight average<br>
molecular weight (e.g., 5,000 to 50,000) is produced in<br>
advance. Then, a raw material composition mixture of a<br>
polymer (II) having a weight average molecular weight<br>
different from polymer (I) (e.g., 60,000 to 350,000) is<br>
successively charged into the polymer (I), or the polymer<br>
(I) is successively charged into a raw material<br>
composition mixture of the polymer (II), and the<br>
resultant mixture is polymerized.<br>
[0037]<br>
The weight average molecular weight of polymer (I)<br>
is, from the perspectives of suppressing defects such as<br>
silver streaks during molding, polymerization stability,<br>
and conferring fluidity, preferably 5,000 to 50,000 as<br>
measured by gel permeation chromatography. More<br>
preferred is 10,000 to 50,000, still more preferred is<br>
20,000 to 50,000, and even more preferred is 20,000 to<br>
35,000.<br>
If particular consideration needs to be given to<br>
polymerization stability, it is preferred that the<br>
blended amount of the methacrylic acid ester monomer in<br>
the copolymerizable other vinyl monomer is essentially<br>
zero. An amount included as impurities in the raw<br>
material methacrylic acid ester monomer is permitted.<br>
The weight average molecular weight of polymer (II)<br>
is, from the perspectives of mechanical strength and<br>
 <br>
fluidity, preferably 60,000 to 350,000. More preferred<br>
is 70,000 to 320,000, and still more preferred is 75,000<br>
to 300,000.<br>
[0038]<br>
In the polymerization step of producing the<br>
methacrylic resin according to the present embodiment, a<br>
polymerization initiator may be used to adjust the degree<br>
of polymerization of the produced polymer.<br>
When carrying out radical polymerization, examples<br>
of the polymerization initiator include typical radical<br>
polymerization initiators, for instance organic peroxides<br>
such as di-t-butyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, stearyl<br>
peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, t-butyl peroxyneodecanoate,<br>
t-butyl peroxypivalate, dilauroyl peroxide, dicumyl<br>
peroxide, t-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, l,l-bis(t-<br>
butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, 1,1-bis(t-<br>
butylperoxy)cyclohexane, and azo polymerization<br>
initiators such as azobisisobutyronitrile,<br>
azobisisovaleronitrile, 1,1-azobis(1-<br>
cyclohexanecarbonitrile), 2,2'-azobis-4-methoxy-2,4-<br>
azobisisobutyronitrile, 2,2'-azobis-2,4-<br>
dimethylvaleronitrile, and 2,2'-azobis-2-<br>
methylbutyronitrile.<br>
These may be used singly, or two or more may be used<br>
together.<br>
 <br>
These radical polymerization initiators may be<br>
combined with a suitable reducing agent, and used as a<br>
redox initiator.<br>
These polymerization initiators are typically used<br>
in a range of 0 to 1 part by mass based on a total of 100<br>
parts by mass of all the used monomers. These<br>
polymerization initiators may be appropriately selected<br>
considering the temperature at which the polymerization<br>
is to be carried out, and the half-life of the initiator.<br>
When selecting a bulk polymerization method, a cast<br>
polymerization method, or a suspension polymerization<br>
method, from the perspective that resin coloration can be<br>
prevented, it is especially preferred to use a peroxide<br>
initiator, such as lauroyl peroxide, decanoyl peroxide,<br>
and t-butylperoxide-2-ethylhexanoate, and it is more<br>
especially preferred to use lauroyl peroxide.<br>
Further, when performing solution polymerization at<br>
a high temperature of 90°C or more, a peroxide or azobis<br>
initiator, for example, which have a 10 hour half-life<br>
temperature of 80°C or more and are soluble in the used<br>
organic solvent, is preferred. Specific examples thereof<br>
include 1,1-bis(t-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane,<br>
cyclohexane peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-<br>
di(benzoylperoxy)hexane, 1,1-azobis(1-<br>
cyclohexanecarbonitrile), and 2-<br>
(carbamoylazo)isobutyronitrile. It is preferred to use<br>
 <br>
these polymerization initiators in a range of, for<br>
example, 0 to 1 part by mass based on a total of 100<br>
parts by mass of all the used monomers.<br>
[0039]<br>
In the production step of the methacrylic resin<br>
according to the present embodiment, to the extent that<br>
the objective of the present invention is not harmed, the<br>
molecular weight of the produced polymer can be<br>
controlled.<br>
For example, the molecular weight can be controlled<br>
by using a chain transfer agent, such as an alkyl<br>
mercaptan, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, and<br>
triethylamine, and an iniferter, such as dithiocarbamate,<br>
triphenylmethylazobenzene, and a tetraphenylethane<br>
derivative.<br>
By adjusting the added amount of these, the<br>
molecular weight can be adjusted. If these additives are<br>
used, from the perspectives of handleability and<br>
stability, it is preferred to use an alkyl mercaptan.<br>
Examples thereof include n-butyl mercaptan, n-octyl<br>
mercaptan, n-dodecyl mercaptan, t-dodecyl mercaptan, n-<br>
tetradecyl mercaptan, n-octadecyl mercaptan, 2-<br>
ethylhexylthioglycolate, ethylene glycol dithioglycolate,<br>
trimethylolpropane tris(thioglycolate), pentaerythritol<br>
tetrakis(thioglycolate) and the like.<br>
 <br>
Although these may be appropriately added based on<br>
the required molecular weight, typically they are used in<br>
a range of 0.001 to 3 parts by mass based on a total of<br>
100 parts by mass of all the used monomers.<br>
Further, examples of other methods for controlling<br>
molecular weight include a method in which the<br>
polymerization method is changed, a method in which the<br>
amount of the polymerization initiator is adjusted, a<br>
method in which the polymerization temperature is changed<br>
and the like.<br>
One of these molecular weight control methods may be<br>
used alone, or two or more may be used together.<br>
[0040]<br>
Although the optimum polymerization temperature may<br>
be appropriately selected based on the polymerization<br>
method, the polymerization temperature is preferably 50°C<br>
or more and 200°C or less.<br>
[0041]<br>
The above-described (First Method) and (Second<br>
Method) are methods for producing a methacrylic resin in<br>
which two components having a different weight average<br>
molecular weight are the constituent elements. However,<br>
the method for producing a methacrylic resin according to<br>
the present embodiment may also produce a polymer (III)<br>
and a polymer (IV), for example, having a different<br>
molecular weight composition based on the same procedures.<br>
 <br>
[0042]<br>
In a state in which polymer (I) has been produced,<br>
and that polymer (I) is present in the raw material<br>
composition mixture of polymer (II), the method for<br>
producing the polymer (II) is a preferred method as the<br>
method for producing the methacrylic resin according to<br>
the present embodiment.<br>
This method is preferred because it is easy to<br>
control the respective compositions of polymers (I) and<br>
(II), an increase in the temperature caused by the heat<br>
generated during polymerization can be controlled, and<br>
the viscosity in the system can also be stabilized.<br>
In this case, the raw material composition mixture<br>
of polymer (II) may also be in a state in which a part<br>
has already started polymerization. Consequently, as the<br>
polymerization method, any of bulk polymerization,<br>
solution polymerization, suspension polymerization, or<br>
emulsion polymerization is preferred, and more preferred<br>
is any of bulk polymerization, solution polymerization,<br>
or suspension polymerization.<br>
[0043]<br>
≤Blending ratio of polymers (I) and (II)≥<br>
Next, the specific blending ratio of the above-<br>
described polymers (I) and (II) in the method for<br>
producing the methacrylic resin according to the present<br>
embodiment will be described.<br>
 <br>
In the following description, polymers (I) and (II)<br>
both have, as the polymer raw material, a methacrylic<br>
acid ester-based polymer that includes a methacrylic acid<br>
ester monomer.<br>
In the above-described (First Method) and (Second<br>
Method), in both cases, in a first polymerization step a<br>
methacrylic acid ester-based polymer (polymer (I)) is<br>
obtained by polymerizing a methacrylic acid ester monomer,<br>
or a methacrylic acid ester monomer and other vinyl<br>
monomer which is copolymerizable with at least one<br>
methacrylic acid ester, and in a second polymerization<br>
step a methacrylic acid ester-based polymer (polymer<br>
(II)) is obtained that can be obtained by polymerizing a<br>
methacrylic acid ester monomer, or a methacrylic acid<br>
ester monomer and other vinyl monomer which is<br>
copolymerizable with at least one methacrylic acid ester.<br>
The blending ratio of these is preferably 5 to 45 %<br>
by mass of polymer (I) and 95 to 55 % by mass of polymer<br>
(ID •<br>
Setting such a blending ratio enables polymerization<br>
stability to be achieved in the production step, and is<br>
also preferred from the perspectives of the fluidity,<br>
molding properties, and mechanical strength of the<br>
methacrylic resin. To obtain an even better balance<br>
among these properties, the polymer (I) / polymer (II)<br>
ratio is more preferably 5 to 40 % by mass / 95 to 60 %<br>
 <br>
by mass, still more preferably 5 to 35 % by mass / 95 to<br>
65 % by mass, and even more preferably 10 to 35 % by mass<br>
/ 90 to 65 % by mass.<br>
[0044]<br>
When adding as the polymer (I) raw material other<br>
vinyl monomer to the methacrylic acid ester monomer, from<br>
the perspective of the color hue of the obtained polymer,<br>
it is preferred that the composition ratio between the<br>
methacrylic acid ester monomer and the other vinyl<br>
monomer is, based on 80 to 100 % by mass of the<br>
methacrylic acid ester monomer, 20 to 0 % by mass of the<br>
other vinyl monomer. More preferably, methacrylic acid<br>
ester monomer / other vinyl monomer is 90 to 100 % by<br>
mass / 10 to 0 mass%, and still more preferred is 95 to<br>
100 mass% / 5 to 0 % by mass.<br>
If particular consideration needs to be given to<br>
polymerization stability, it is preferred that the<br>
blended amount of the copolymerizable other vinyl monomer<br>
in polymer (I) is essentially zero. In such case, an<br>
amount included as impurities in the raw material<br>
methacrylic acid ester monomer is permitted.<br>
[0045]<br>
When adding other vinyl monomer to the methacrylic<br>
acid ester monomer serving as the polymer (II) raw<br>
material, from the perspective of the thermal stability<br>
of the obtained polymer, it is preferred that the<br>
 <br>
composition ratio between the methacrylic acid ester<br>
monomer and the other vinyl monomer is, based on a<br>
composition ratio of methacrylic acid ester monomer /<br>
other vinyl monomer, 80 to 99.5 % by mass / 20 to 0.5 %<br>
by mass, more preferred is 85 to 99.5 % by mass / 15 to<br>
0.5 % by mass, still more preferred is 88 to 99 % by mass<br>
/ 12 to 1 % by mass, and even more preferred is 90 to<br>
98.5 % by mass / 10 to 1.5 % by mass.<br>
[0046]<br>
≤Vinyl monomer copolymerization ratio in polymer (I) and<br>
in polymer (II)≥<br>
When Mai (% by mass) is the composition ratio of the<br>
other vinyl monomer unit which is copolymerizable with a<br>
methacrylic acid ester in polymer (I), and Mah (% by<br>
mass) is the composition ratio of the other vinyl monomer<br>
unit which is copolymerizable with a methacrylic acid<br>
ester in polymer (II), it is preferred from the<br>
perspective of polymerization stability that the<br>
copolymerization ratio in polymer (I) and polymer (II),<br>
respectively, of the other vinyl monomer unit which is<br>
copolymerizable with a methacrylic acid ester used as a<br>
polymerization raw material of the above-described<br>
polymer (I) and polymer (II) satisfies the relationship<br>
of the following expression (3):<br>
Mah ≥ Mai ≥ 0 ... (3)<br>
[0047]<br>
 <br>
It is preferred that the high molecular weight<br>
polymer (II) includes a large amount of the other vinyl<br>
monomer which is copolymerizable with a methacrylic acid<br>
ester based on the composition ratio, as this enables<br>
polymerization stability to be achieved, and also allows<br>
fluidity to be improved while maintaining heat resistance<br>
and mechanical strength.<br>
It is more preferred that the relationship of the<br>
following expression (4) is satisfied:<br>
(Mah- 0.8) ≥ Mai ≥ 0 ... (4)<br>
[0048]<br>
When the methacrylic resin obtained by the<br>
production method according to the present embodiment is<br>
formed into a molded article, if there is a need for<br>
improved fluidity while maintaining a low incidence of<br>
cracks and molded article distortion under environmental<br>
testing and mechanical strength, it is preferred that the<br>
relationship of the following expression (5) is satisfied.<br>
(Mah- 2) ≥ Mai ≥ 0 . . . (5)<br>
[0049]<br>
The level of the composition ratio Mai of the other<br>
vinyl monomer unit which is copolymerizable with a<br>
methacrylic acid ester in polymer (I) and the level of<br>
the composition ratio Mah of the other vinyl monomer unit<br>
which is copolymerizable with a methacrylic acid ester in<br>
 <br>
polymer (II) can each be determined by measuring by<br>
pyrolysis gas chromatography.<br>
To adjust the composition ratios Mai and Mah so that<br>
the above-described expressions are satisfied, the amount<br>
of other vinyl monomer which is copolymerizable with a<br>
methacrylic acid ester monomer to be added during the<br>
first stage and second and subsequent polymerization<br>
stages may be adjusted.<br>
[0050]<br>
(Method for producing methacrylic resin by suspension<br>
polymerization)<br>
A case will now be especially described in more<br>
detail in which, in the method for producing the<br>
methacrylic resin according to the present embodiment,<br>
the polymerization step is carried out using suspension<br>
polymerization.<br>
When producing the methacrylic resin by suspension<br>
polymerization, in the above-described (First Method) and<br>
(Second Method), the polymerization of polymer (II) is<br>
carried out in the presence of polymer (I).<br>
[0051]<br>
≤Stirring apparatus≥<br>
As the stirring device used in the polymerization<br>
apparatus for obtaining the methacrylic resin by<br>
suspension polymerization, the known stirring devices can<br>
be used, such as a stirring device having in its interior<br>
 <br>
a stirring impeller, such as an inclined paddle impeller,<br>
a flat paddle impeller, a propeller impeller, an anchor<br>
impeller, a Pfaudler impeller, a turbine impeller, a bull<br>
margin impeller, a maxblend impeller, a full zone<br>
impeller, a ribbon impeller, a supermix impeller, an<br>
Intermig impeller, a special impeller, and an axial-flow<br>
impeller, a stirring device having a shovel impeller in<br>
its interior, a stirring device having a chopper impeller<br>
in its interior, and a stirring device having a rotating<br>
disc in its interior, such as a disc type, a notched disc<br>
type, or a screw type.<br>
Although the stirring rate during polymerization<br>
also depends on factors such as the type of stirring<br>
device to be used, the stirring efficiency of the<br>
stirring impeller, and the capacity of the polymerization<br>
tank, it is preferred that the stirring rate is about 1<br>
to 500 rpm, in consideration of the fact that a suitable<br>
particle size can be obtained and the fact that the<br>
content of the component having a particle size less than<br>
0.15 mm can be reduced, and in view of polymerization<br>
stability and the like.<br>
[0052]<br>
≤Polymerization temperature and polymerization time≥<br>
The polymerization temperature in the suspension<br>
polymerization is, considering productivity and the<br>
production amount of the agglomerate, preferably 60°C or<br>
 <br>
more and 90°C or less. More preferred is 65°C or more and<br>
85°C or less, still more preferred is 70°C or more and<br>
85°C or less, and even more preferred is 70°C or more and<br>
83°C or less. The polymerization temperature of polymer<br>
(I) and polymer (II) may be the same or different.<br>
[0053]<br>
The time (Tl: herein, sometimes referred to as<br>
"polymerization time") from adding the raw material<br>
mixture of polymer (I) to reaching the exothermic peak<br>
temperature from the heat generated by polymerization is,<br>
from the perspective of reducing the occurrence of<br>
agglomerates, preferably 20 minutes or more and 240<br>
minutes or less, more preferably 30 minutes or more and<br>
210 minutes or less, still more preferably 45 minutes or<br>
more and 180 minutes or less, even more preferably 60<br>
minutes or more and 150 minutes or less, and still even<br>
more preferably 60 minutes or more and 120 minutes or<br>
less.<br>
This polymerization time (T1) may be adjusted as<br>
appropriate based on the amount of the used<br>
polymerization initiator and changes in the<br>
polymerization temperature.<br>
[0054]<br>
The temperature when adding the raw material mixture<br>
of polymer (I) may be set considering the boiling point<br>
of the used raw materials. It is preferred that this<br>
 <br>
temperature is about the same as, or equal to or lower<br>
than, the boiling point of the used raw materials.<br>
If the temperature is high, the raw materials tend<br>
to volatilize during addition, so that the composition of<br>
the obtained polymer changes. If the temperature is low,<br>
it takes time to increase the temperature after addition<br>
of the raw materials. Therefore, it is preferred to add<br>
the raw materials at a certain temperature. Specifically,<br>
the temperature is preferably 60°C or more and 90°C or<br>
less, more preferably 60°C or more and 85°C or less,<br>
still more preferably 65°C or more and 85°C or less, even<br>
more preferably 65°C or more and 80°C or less, and still<br>
even more preferably 70°C or more and 80°C or less.<br>
[0055]<br>
The raw material mixture of polymer (II) may be<br>
added immediately after the exothermic peak due to the<br>
polymerization of polymer (I) is observed, or may be<br>
added after holding for a predetermined period. When it<br>
is necessary to increase the degree of polymerization of<br>
the raw material mixture of polymer (I), it is preferred<br>
to add the raw material mixture of polymer (II) after<br>
holding for a predetermined period after the exothermic<br>
peak due to the polymerization of polymer (I) is observed.<br>
It is preferred that the holding period is 180<br>
minutes or less. More preferred is 10 minutes or more<br>
and 180 minutes or less, still more preferred is 15<br>
 <br>
minutes or more and 150 minutes or less, even more<br>
preferred is 20 minutes or more and 120 minutes or less,<br>
and still even more preferred is 20 minutes or more and<br>
90 minutes or less.<br>
It is preferred that the temperature during this<br>
holding period is the same as or higher than the<br>
polymerization temperature of polymer (I), as this<br>
enables the degree of polymerization to be increased. If<br>
holding at a higher temperature, it is preferred to hold<br>
at a temperature 5°C or more higher than the<br>
polymerization temperature. If increasing the<br>
temperature, from the perspective of preventing<br>
agglomeration of the obtained polymer, the temperature is<br>
preferably 100°C or less. More specifically, 80°C or more<br>
and 100°C or less is preferred, 80°C or more and 99°C or<br>
less is more preferred, 85°C or more and 99°C or less is<br>
still more preferred, 88°C or more and 99°C or less is<br>
even more preferred, and 90°C or more and 99°C or less is<br>
still even more preferred.<br>
By carrying out polymerization based on the above-<br>
described polymerization temperature and holding time,<br>
polymer particles having a smaller angle of repose can be<br>
produced.<br>
When increasing the temperature in the above-<br>
described holding step, from the perspective of<br>
preventing volatilization of the raw material mixture of<br>
 <br>
polymer (II), it is preferred to lower the temperature to<br>
about 70 to 85°C, and then add the raw material mixture<br>
of polymer (II).<br>
[0056]<br>
The time (T2: herein, sometimes referred to as<br>
"polymerization time") from adding the raw material<br>
mixture of polymer (II) until the exothermic peak<br>
temperature from the heat generated by polymerization is<br>
observed is, from the perspectives of reducing the angle<br>
of repose of the obtained polymer and reducing the amount<br>
of agglomerates, preferably 30 minutes or more and 240<br>
minutes or less, more preferably 45 minutes or more and<br>
210 minutes or less, still more preferably 60 minutes or<br>
more and 210 minutes or less, even more preferably 60<br>
minutes or more and 180 minutes or less, and still even<br>
more preferably 80 minutes or more and 150 minutes or<br>
less.<br>
[0057]<br>
As the relationship between the polymerization times<br>
of polymer (I) and polymer (II), from a productivity<br>
perspective and the perspective that a resin having a<br>
small angle of repose can be obtained, the relationship<br>
between the polymerization time of polymer (I), i.e., the<br>
time (T1) until reaching the exothermic peak temperature<br>
from the heat generated by polymerization after adding<br>
the monomer in the first stage polymerization, and the<br>
 <br>
polymerization time of polymer (II), i.e., the time (T2)<br>
until reaching the exothermic peak temperature from the<br>
heat generated by polymerization after adding the monomer<br>
in the second stage polymerization, preferably satisfies<br>
the following relational expression (6):<br>
0.6 ≤ T2/T1 ≤ 5 ... (6)<br>
When particularly considering the color hue of the<br>
obtained resin, it is preferred that 0.6 ≤ T2/T1 ≤ 4,<br>
more preferred that 0.8 ≤ T2/T1 ≤ 4, and still more<br>
preferred that 0.8 ≤ T2/T1 ≤ 3.<br>
Especially from the perspectives of reducing the<br>
angle of repose, as well as suppressing generation of<br>
agglomerates, which are a cause of deterioration in yield,<br>
it is preferred that 1 ≤ T2/T1 ≤ 5, more preferred that 1<br>
≤	T2/T1 ≤ 4, and still more preferred that 1 ≤ T2/T1 ≤ 3.<br>
On the other hand, to especially reduce the residual<br>
monomer amount and the agglomerate content in a well-<br>
balanced manner, it is preferred to select a range of 0.6<br>
≤	T2/T1 ≤ 1, more preferred is 0.65 ≤ T2/T1 ≤ 1, still<br>
more preferred is 0.7 ≤ T2/T1 ≤ 1, even more preferred is<br>
0.75 ≤ T2/T1 ≤ 1, and still even more preferred is 0.8 ≤<br>
T2/T1 ≤ 0.95,<br>
[0058]<br>
To obtain good color hue properties, reduce the<br>
angle of repose, and reduce agglomerates, it is preferred<br>
to set so that 0.6 ≤ T2/T1 ≤ 4. However, it is more<br>
 <br>
preferred to select the above-described polymerization<br>
times based on a desired property among the above-<br>
described properties.<br>
[0059]<br>
To adjust so that the time until reaching the<br>
exothermic peak temperature following the first and<br>
second stages satisfies the above-described relational<br>
expression (6), the polymerization ratio of polymer (I)<br>
and polymer (II) can be adjusted, the polymerization<br>
temperature can be adjusted, or the amount of used<br>
polymerization initiator can be adjusted as appropriate.<br>
Following observation of the exothermic peak<br>
temperature from the heat generated by polymerization<br>
after adding the raw material mixture of polymer (II), i<br>
is preferred to increase the temperature by 5°C or more<br>
above the polymerization temperature of polymer (II), as<br>
this enables the amount of residual monomer in the<br>
obtained methacrylic resin to be suppressed. More<br>
preferred is 7°C or more, and still more preferred is<br>
10°C or more.<br>
Further, to prevent agglomeration of the obtained<br>
resin, it is preferred that the increased end-point<br>
temperature is 100°C or less. A more preferred range is<br>
85°C or more and 100°C or less, still more preferred is<br>
88°C or more and 99°C or less, and even more preferred is<br>
90°C or more and 99°C or less.<br>
 <br>
The time for holding at the above-described<br>
increased temperature is, considering the effect of<br>
reducing residual monomers, preferably 15 minutes or more<br>
and 360 minutes or less, more preferably 30 minutes or<br>
more and 240 minutes or less, still more preferably 30<br>
minutes or more and 180 minutes or less, even more<br>
preferably 30 minutes or more and 150 minutes or less,<br>
and still even more preferably 30 minutes or more and 120<br>
minutes or less.<br>
[0060]<br>
≤Washing method≥<br>
To remove the suspension agent, it is preferred to<br>
subject the slurry of the methacrylic resin obtained by<br>
the above-described polymerization step to an operation<br>
such as acid cleaning, water washing, and alkali cleaning.<br>
These cleaning operations may be carried out once or a<br>
plurality of times. The optimum number can be selected<br>
based on the operation efficiency and the removal<br>
efficiency of the suspension agent.<br>
The optimum temperature for performing the cleaning<br>
may be selected in consideration of the removal<br>
efficiency of the suspension agent and the coloration<br>
degree of the obtained polymer. Preferably, this<br>
temperature is 20 to 100°C, more preferably 30 to 95°C,<br>
and still more preferably 40 to 95°C.<br>
 <br>
The cleaning time per one cleaning operation is,<br>
from the perspectives of cleaning efficiency, angle of<br>
repose reduction effect, and step simplicity, preferably<br>
10 to 180 minutes, and more preferably 20 to 150 minutes.<br>
The pH of the cleaning solution used during cleaning<br>
may be in the range within which the suspension agent can<br>
be removed, and is preferably a pH of 1 to 12. If<br>
performing acid cleaning, from the perspective of removal<br>
efficiency of the suspension agent and the color hue of<br>
the obtained polymer, the pH is preferably 1 to 5, and<br>
more preferably 1.2 to 4. Acids that can be used in this<br>
operation are not especially limited, as long as the<br>
suspension agent can be removed. Conventionally-known<br>
inorganic acids and organic acids may be used. Examples<br>
of inorganic acids that may be preferably used include<br>
hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric<br>
acid, boric acid and the like. Dilute solutions of these<br>
acids with water may also be used. Examples of organic<br>
acids include acids having a carboxyl group, a sulfo<br>
group, a hydroxy group, a thiol group, an enol and the<br>
like. Considering the removal efficiency of the<br>
suspension agent and the color hue of the obtained resin,<br>
more preferred are sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and an<br>
organic acid having a carboxyl group.<br>
After the acid cleaning, from the perspective of the<br>
color hue of the obtained polymer and reduction of the<br>
 <br>
angle of repose, it is preferred to further carry out<br>
water washing or alkali cleaning.<br>
The pH of the alkali solution when performing alkali<br>
cleaning is preferably 7.1 to 12, more preferably 7.5 to<br>
11, and still more preferably 7.5 to 10.5.<br>
The alkaline component used in alkaline cleaning is<br>
preferably a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, an alkali<br>
metal hydroxide, an alkaline earth metal hydroxide and<br>
the like. More preferred are an alkali metal hydroxide<br>
and an alkaline earth metal hydroxide. Still more<br>
preferred are lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide,<br>
magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, and barium<br>
hydroxide. Even more preferred are lithium hydroxide,<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium<br>
hydroxide, calcium hydroxide. Still even more preferred<br>
are sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.<br>
These alkaline components can be used by diluting<br>
with water to adjust the pH.<br>
[0061]<br>
≤Dewatering step≥<br>
As a method for separating the polymer particles<br>
from the obtained polymer slurry, a conventionally-known<br>
method can be applied.<br>
Examples thereof may include a dewatering method<br>
that uses a centrifugal separator which utilizes<br>
 <br>
centrifugal force to shake out water, and a method that<br>
separates the polymer particles by suction removal of<br>
water on a porous belt or a filtration membrane.<br>
[0062]<br>
≤Drying step≥<br>
The polymer obtained after the above-described<br>
dewatering step, which still contains water, may be<br>
subjected to a drying treatment by a known method, and<br>
then recovered.<br>
Examples of such a method may include hot-air drying<br>
in which drying is carried out by blowing hot air into a<br>
tank from a hot-air drier or a blow heater, vacuum drying<br>
in which drying is carried out by reducing the pressure<br>
in the system and increasing the temperature as necessary,<br>
barrel drying in which moisture is thrown off by rotating<br>
the obtained polymer in a vessel, and spin drying in<br>
which drying is carried out by utilizing centrifugal<br>
force. One of these methods may be used alone, or two or<br>
more may be combined.<br>
The moisture content of the obtained methacrylic<br>
resin is, considering the handleability, color hue and<br>
the like of the obtained resin, preferably 0.01 % by mass<br>
to 1 % by mass, more preferably 0.05 % by mass to 1 % by<br>
mass, still more preferably 0.1 % by mass to 1 % by mass,<br>
and even more preferably 0.27 % by mass to 1 % by mass.<br>
 <br>
The moisture content of the obtained resin can be<br>
measured using the Karl Fischer method.<br>
[0063]<br>
≤Agglomerates≥<br>
When producing the methacrylic resin using<br>
suspension polymerization, although the obtained<br>
methacrylic resin is usually roughly spherical,<br>
agglomerates can sometimes be formed.<br>
The term "agglomerates" refers to residual matter<br>
remaining on the sieve when the obtained polymer is<br>
passed through a sieve having a mesh of 1.68 mm.<br>
If agglomerates remain in the methacrylic resin, the<br>
color hue of the obtained methacrylic resin tends to<br>
deteriorate. It is preferred that the amount of<br>
agglomerates in the methacrylic resin is no more than<br>
1.2 % by mass, and more preferred is no more than 1.0 %<br>
by mass.<br>
The agglomerate content can be calculated by<br>
measuring the weight of matter remaining on a sieve<br>
having a mesh of 1.68 mm after drying in an 80°C drying<br>
oven for 12 hours, and dividing the obtained weight by<br>
the total weight of the raw materials to obtain the<br>
agglomerate produced amount (% by mass).<br>
[0064]<br>
[Methacrylic resin composition]<br>
 <br>
The methacrylic resin according to the present<br>
embodiment can be used as a composition that is combined<br>
with a below-described predetermined other resin and<br>
predetermined additives.<br>

[0065]<br>
≤Additives≥<br>

methacrylic resin according to the present embodiment to<br>
confer various properties, such as rigidity and<br>
dimensional stability.<br>

acid salt; antioxidants, UV absorbers, stabilizers such<br>
as a thermal stabilizer and a light stabilizer; flame<br>
retardants, flame retardant aids, curing agents, curing<br>
 <br>
accelerants, conductivity imparting agents, stress<br>
mitigators, crystallization promoters, hydrolysis<br>
inhibitors, lubricants, impacting agents, slidability<br>
improvers, compatibilizing agents, nucleating agents,<br>
strengthening agents, reinforcing agents, flow control<br>
agents, dyes, sensitizers, coloration pigments, rubbery<br>
polymers, thickeners, anti-settling agents, anti-sagging<br>
agents, fillers, antifoaming agents, coupling agents,<br>

antifouling agents, conductive polymers and the like.<br>
Examples of thermal stabilizers include antioxidants<br>
such as a hindered phenolic antioxidant and a phosphorus<br>
processing stabilizer, and a hindered phenolic<br>
antioxidant is preferred. Specific examples thereof<br>
include pentaerythritol tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4 -<br>
hydroxyphenyl)propionate], thiodiethylene bis[3-(3,5-di-<br>
tert-butyl-4- hydroxyphenyl) propionate], octadecyl-3-<br>
(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate,<br>
3,3',3',5,5',5'-hexa-tert-butyl-a, a',a'-(mesitylene-<br>
2,4,6-triyl)tri-p-cresol, 4,6-bis(octylthiomethyl)-o-<br>
cresol, 4,6-bis(dodecylthiomethyl)-o-cresol, ethylene<br>
bis(oxyethylene)bis[3-(5-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-m-<br>
tolyl)propionate], hexamethylene bis[3-(3,5-di-tert-<br>
butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate], l,3,5-tris(3,5-di-<br>
tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)-1,3,5-triazine-<br>
2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione, 1,3,5-tris[(4-tert-butyl-3-<br>
 <br>
hydroxy-2,6-xylene)methyl]-1,3,5-triazine-<br>
2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-(4,6-<br>
bis(octylthio)-1,3,5-triazine-2-ylamine)phenol and the<br>
like. Especially, pentaerythritol tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-<br>
tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate] is preferred.<br>
Examples of UV absorbers include benzotriazole<br>
compounds, benzotriazine compounds, benzoate compounds,<br>

compounds, benzoxazinone compounds and the like.<br>
Preferred are benzotriazole compounds and benzotriazine<br>
compounds. One of these may be used alone, or two or<br>
more may be used together.<br>
Further, when adding a UV absorber, from the<br>
perspective of molding processability, it is preferred<br>
that the vapor pressure at 20°C is 1.0 x 10~4 Pa or less,<br>
more preferred is 1.0 x 10"6 Pa or less, and still more<br>
preferred is 1.0 x 10"8 Pa or less.<br>
The expression "excellent molding processability"<br>
refers to there being little adhesion of the UV absorber<br>
to the roll during film molding, for example. If the UV<br>
absorber adheres to the roll, for example, the UV<br>
absorber sticks to the surface of the molded article, the<br>
appearance and optical properties and deteriorate.<br>
 <br>

≤Additive and other resin kneading method≥<br>
As the kneading method when processing the<br>
methacrylic resin and mixing the various additives and<br>
other resin, a kneading and production may be carried out<br>
using a kneading machine such as an extruder, a heated<br>
roll, a kneader, a roller mixer, and a Banbury mixer.<br>
Among these, kneading with an extruder is preferred<br>
from a productivity perspective.<br>
The kneading temperature may be set based on the<br>
polymer forming the methacrylic resin and the preferred<br>
processing temperature of the other resin to be mixed.<br>
As a guide, this temperature may be in the range of 140<br>
to 300°C, and preferably in the range of 180 to 280°C.<br>
 <br>
[0067]<br>

include known molding methods, such as injection molding,<br>
sheet molding, blow molding, injection blow molding,<br>
inflation molding, T-die molding, press molding,<br>

mold, then cured with a hot press. As the solvent for<br>
dissolving the respective components, a solvent that can<br>
 <br>
uniformly mix the respective materials, and that by using<br>
it does not harm the effects of the present invention,<br>
may be used.<br>
Examples of such solvents include toluene, xylene,<br>
acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl butyl ketone,<br>
diethyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone,<br>
dimethylformamide, methyl cellosolve, methanol, ethanol,<br>
n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, n-<br>
hexanol, cyclohexanol, n-hexane, n-pentane and the like.<br>

and produce a resin composition using a kneading machine,<br>
such as a heated roll, a kneader, a Banbury mixer, and an<br>
extruder, cooling and pulverizing the resin composition,<br>
and then perform molding by transfer molding, injection<br>

Sample: 10 )xL Solution of 0.1 g of methacrylic resin in<br>
10 cc of chloroform<br>
[0072]<br>
The above-described sample was collected in a<br>
pyrolysis apparatus platinum sample cup, and vacuum-dried<br>
for 2 hours at 150°C. The sample cup was then placed in<br>
the pyrolysis furnace, and the sample was subjected to<br>
compositional analysis under the above-described<br>
conditions.<br>
The composition ratio of the methacrylic resin was<br>
determined based on the peak area in total ion<br>
chromatography (TIC) of methyl methacrylate and methyl<br>
acrylate and the calibration curve of the following<br>
standard sample.<br>
Preparation of calibration curve standard samples: 0.25 %<br>

octylmercaptan were charged into 50 g solutions of a<br>
total of five methyl methacrylate and methyl acrylate<br>
compositions mixed in ratios of, respectively, (methyl<br>
methacrylate / methyl acrylate) = (100 % by mass / 0 % by<br>
mass), (98 % by mass / 2 % by mass), (94 % by mass / 6 %<br>
by mass), (90 % by mass / 10 % by mass), and (80 % by<br>

glass ampoules were put in a 80°C water bath for 3 hours,<br>
and then placed in a 150°C oven for 2 hours. The glass<br>
ampoules were cooled to room temperature, and then the<br>
glass was split open. The methacrylic resin therein was<br>
extracted, and subjected to compositional analysis.<br>
A graph plotting the (area of the methyl acrylate) /<br>
(area of the methyl methacrylate + area of the methyl<br>
acrylate) obtained based on measurement of the above-<br>
described calibration curve standard samples and the<br>

calibration curve.<br>
[0073]<br>
(2. Measurement of the weight average molecular weight<br>
and molecular weight distribution of the methacrylic<br>
resin)<br>
Measurement apparatus: Gel permeation chromatography (LC-<br>
908) manufactured by Japan Analytical Industry Co., Ltd.<br>
Column: One Jaigel-4H column and two Jaigel-2H columns<br>
connected in series.<br>
In this column, high molecular weight elutes quickly,<br>
and low molecular weight elutes slowly.<br>
Detector: RI (differential refraction) detector<br>
Detection sensitivity: 2.4 [iV/sec<br>
Sample: Solution of 0.450 g of methacrylic resin in 15 mL<br>
of chloroform<br>
 <br>
Injection amount: 3 mL<br>
Developing solvent: Chloroform, flow rate 3.3 mL/min<br>
[0074]<br>
Under the above-described conditions, the RI<br>
detection intensity based on the methacrylic resin<br>
elution time was measured.<br>
The weight average molecular weight (Mw) and the<br>
molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of the methacrylic<br>
resin were determined based on the region area of the GPC<br>
elution curve and the calibration curve.<br>
As the calibration curves, the following 10<br>
methacrylic resins (manufactured by EasiCal PM-1 Polymer<br>
Laboratories) having a known monodisperse weight average<br>
molecular weight and differing molecular weights were<br>
used.<br>
Weight Average Molecular Weight<br>
Standard Sample 1: 1,900,000<br>
Standard Sample 2: 790,000<br>
Standard Sample 3: 281,700<br>
Standard Sample 4: 144,000<br>
Standard Sample 5: 59,800<br>
Standard Sample 6: 28,900<br>

 <br>
[0075]<br>
The GPC elution curve for polymer (II) alone was<br>
obtained by, when the polymer (I) having a weight average<br>
molecular weight of 5,000 to 50,000 and the polymer (II)<br>
having a weight average molecular weight of 60,000 to<br>
350,000 are mixed, determining in advance the weight<br>
average molecular weight of polymer (I) alone by<br>
measuring the GPC elution curve of polymer (I),<br>
multiplying the ratio of polymer (I) that is present<br>
(herein, the charged ratio was used) by the GPC elution<br>
curve of polymer (I), and subtracting the detection<br>
intensity at that elution time from the GPC elution curve<br>
of the mixture of polymer (I) and polymer (II). Based on<br>
this, the weight average molecular weights of these<br>
polymers (II) were determined.<br>
[0076]<br>
Further, the peak molecular weight (Mp) on the GPC<br>
elution curve was determined based on the GPC elution<br>
curve and the calibration curve, and the content of the<br>
molecular weight component 1/5 or less the Mp was<br>
determined in the following manner.<br>
First, the region area of the GPC elution curve of<br>
the methacrylic resin (the area of the shaded portion in<br>
Figure 2) was determined.<br>
Next, the region area of the GPC elution curve was<br>
divided by the elution time corresponding to the 1/5<br>
 <br>
molecular weight of the Mp to determine the region area<br>
of the GPC elution curve corresponding to the molecular<br>
weight component 1/5 or less the Mp.<br>
From the ratio between that area and the region area<br>
of the GPC elution curve, the ratio of the molecular<br>
weight component 1/5 or less the Mp was determined.<br>
[0077]<br>
(3. Measurement of the composition ratio of the vinyl<br>
monomer copolymerizable with methyl methacrylate in the<br>
high molecular weight component and the low molecular<br>
weight component of the methacrylic resin)<br>
In this measurement, the composition of the vinyl<br>
monomer copolymerizable with methyl methacrylate in the<br>
molecular weight component having a cumulative region<br>
area of 0 to 2% (high molecular weight component: Mh) and<br>
in the molecular weight component having a cumulative<br>
region area of 98 to 100% (low molecular weight<br>
component: Ml), respectively, was analyzed.<br>
The cumulative region area (%) of the region area of<br>
the GPC elution curve is considered as being formed by<br>
the area of the GPC elution curve obtained by adding up<br>
the detection intensities corresponding to the respective<br>
elution times heading toward the finish of the elution<br>
time, in which point A in Figure 4 is a cumulative region<br>
area (%) reference of 0%.<br>
 <br>
A specific example of the cumulative region area<br>
will be described with reference to Figure 3.<br>
In Figure 3, point X is a point on the baseline and<br>
point Y is a point on the GPC elution curve at a given<br>
elution time.<br>
The ratio of the area enclosed by the curve AY, line<br>
segment AX, and line segment XY to the region area of the<br>
GPC elution curve is taken as the value of the cumulative<br>
region area (%) at a given elution time.<br>
The molecular weight component having a cumulative<br>
region area of 0 to 2% (high molecular weight component)<br>
and the molecular weight component having a cumulative<br>
region area of 98 to 100% (low molecular weight component<br>
were sampled from the column based on the corresponding<br>
elution time, and the compositions thereof were analyzed.<br>
This was performed using the same apparatus and under the<br>
same conditions as in the above-described (2. Measurement<br>
of the weight average molecular weight and molecular<br>
weight distribution of the methacrylic resin).<br>
Sampling was carried out twice. 10 |j.L from the<br>
obtained samples was collected in a pyrolysis gas<br>
chromatography analysis and mass spectrometry method<br>
pyrolysis apparatus platinum sample cup used in the<br>
above-described (1. Methacrylic resin compositional<br>
analysis). Then, using a 100°C vacuum drier, the<br>
collected sample was dried for 40 minutes.<br>
 <br>
The composition of the methacrylic resin<br>
corresponding to the sampled cumulative region area was<br>
determined under the same conditions as in the above-<br>
described (1. Methacrylic resin compositional analysis).<br>
[0078]<br>
[II. Measurement of produced amount of agglomerates]<br>
A mixed solution including polymer fine particles<br>
obtained by polymerization was passed through a sieve<br>
having a 1.68 mm mesh to remove agglomerates. The<br>
obtained agglomerates were dried for 12 hours in an 80°C<br>
drying oven, and their weight was then measured.<br>
The produced amount of agglomerates (% by mass) was<br>
calculated by dividing the obtained weight by the total<br>
weight of the raw materials used to produce polymer (I)<br>
(raw materials (I)) and the raw materials used to produce<br>
polymer (II) (raw materials (II)).<br>
[0079]<br>
[III. Measurement of physical properties]<br>
(1. Measurement of rupture time measured by a cantilever<br>
method)<br>
Solvent resistance was evaluated by a measurement<br>
method based on the cantilever method illustrated in<br>
Figure 1.<br>
Injection molding machine: IS-100EN manufactured by<br>
Toshiba Machine<br>
 <br>
Injection molded article: 3.2 mm thick, 12.7 mm wide, 127<br>
mm long<br>
Injection Conditions<br>
Molding temperature: 230°C<br>
Mold temperature: 60°C<br>
Injection pressure: 56 MPa<br>
Injection time: 20 sec<br>
Cooling time: 40 sec<br>
A molded article molded under the above conditions<br>
was kept in a decanter for 1 day so that it did not<br>
absorb water.<br>
Then, using the jig illustrated in Figure 1, a<br>
molded article 2 was arranged as illustrated in Figure 1,<br>
a 3 kg weight 3 attached with a kite string 5 was<br>
attached as illustrated in Figure 1, and a filter paper 4<br>
containing ethanol was placed at the position illustrated<br>
in Figure 1. The time it took from placing the filter<br>
paper 4 until the molded article 2 ruptured due to the<br>
weight 3 was measured.<br>
The above-described measurement was carried out 10<br>
times for each sample. The data for the maximum time and<br>
the minimum time were discarded, and the average time<br>
(seconds) for the remaining 8 measurements was calculated.<br>
This value was used as an index for solvent<br>
resistance evaluation.<br>
[0080]<br>
 <br>
(2. Measurement of VICAT softening temperature)<br>
Measurement was carried out using a 4 mm-thick test<br>
piece based on ISO 306 B50 to determine the VICAT<br>
softening temperature (°C) . This value was used as an<br>
index for heat resistance evaluation.<br>
[0081]<br>
(3. Charpy impact strength (unnotched))<br>
Measurement was carried out using a 3.2 mm-thick<br>
test piece based on the ISO 179 standard.<br>
[0082]<br>
(4. Evaluation of yellowness index difference)<br>
The yellowness index difference AYI was measured<br>
using the following equation, using 4 test pieces 3 mm<br>
thick, 20 mm wide, and 220 mm long laminated over each<br>
other, by measuring YI (yellowness index) in the 220 mm<br>
length direction based on JIS T7105 (plastic optical<br>
characteristics test method) using the colorimeter TC-<br>
8600A manufactured by Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd.<br>
A test piece was produced using the IS-100EN<br>
manufactured by Toshiba Machine at a molding temperature<br>
set to 230°C and a mold temperature set to 60°C.<br>
AYI represents a degree of yellowing in a molded<br>
article. A smaller value indicates less yellowing.<br>
Yellowness index difference AYI = YI - YIO<br>
AYI = Yellowness index difference<br>
YI = Molded article yellowness index<br>
 <br>
YIO = Air yellowness index<br>
Obtained AYI values that were 20 or less were<br>
evaluated as "®", values that were more than 20 and 25<br>
or less were evaluated as "O", values that were more<br>
than 25 and 30 or less were evaluated as "A", and values<br>
that were more than 30 were evaluated as "X".<br>

manufactured by Hosokawa Micron Group.<br>
The angle of repose was determined to be good in<br>
practice if it was 40° or less.<br>
[0084]<br>
(6. Measurement of average particle size)<br>
The average particle size was determined by<br>
measuring the particle weight remaining on each sieve<br>
when sieving was performed based on JIS-Z8801 for 10<br>
minutes at maximum vibration output using a sieve (JTS-<br>
200-45-44 (500 jjm apertures), 34 (425 ym apertures), 35<br>
(355 |jm apertures), 36 (300 ^m apertures), 37 (250 |j.m<br>
apertures), 38 (150 (am apertures), and 61 (pan),<br>
manufactured by Tokyo Screen) and the test sieve shaker<br>
TSK-B-1, and determining the particle size at which the<br>
weight reached 50%.<br>
The content of the particles remaining on the pan<br>
that passed through the sieve having 150 |xm particle size<br>
 <br>
apertures (content of component having particle size less<br>
than 0.15 mm) was measured.<br>
[0085]<br>
(7. Measurement of moisture content)<br>
Measurement was carried out at a set temperature of<br>
230°C using the Karl Fischer method.<br>
[0086]<br>
The method for producing the methacrylic resin will<br>
now be illustrated.<br>
The blended amounts are shown in the following Table<br>
1.<br>
Further, the monomer blend composition, the polymer<br>
ratio, the measurement results of the weight average<br>
molecular weight of each polymer, and the polymerization<br>
conditions are shown in the following Table 2.<br>
[0087]<br>
[Example 1]<br>
Two (2) kg of water, 65 g of calcium phosphate, 39 g<br>
of calcium carbonate, and 0.39 g of sodium lauryl sulfate<br>
were charged into a vessel having a stirring device<br>
provided with four inclined paddle impellers to obtain a<br>
mixed solution (A).<br>
Next, 26 kg of water was charged into a 60 L reactor,<br>
the temperature was increased to 80°C, and then the mixed<br>
solution (A) and the raw materials of polymer (I) in the<br>
 <br>
blending amounts shown in the following Table 1 were<br>
charged therein.<br>
Then, suspension polymerization was carried out by<br>
maintaining the temperature at about 80°C, and the<br>
exothermic peak 80 minutes after adding the polymer (I)<br>
raw materials was observed.<br>
Subsequently, the temperature was increased to 92°C<br>
at a rate of l°C/min, and the 92°C temperature was<br>
maintained for about 30 minutes.<br>
Then, after the temperature was decreased to 80°C at<br>
a rate of l°C/min, the raw materials of polymer (II) were<br>
charged into the reactor in the blending amounts shown in<br>
the following Table 1. Next, suspension polymerization<br>
was carried out by maintaining the temperature at about<br>
80°C, and the exothermic peak 120 minutes after adding<br>
the polymer (II) raw materials was observed.<br>
Subsequently, the temperature was increased to 92°C<br>
at a rate of l°C/min and the solution was aged for 60<br>
minutes, after which the polymerization reaction was<br>
essentially finished.<br>
Next, the resultant mixture was cooled to 50°C, and<br>
then charged with 20 % by mass of sulfuric acid to<br>
dissolve the suspension agent.<br>
Next, the polymerization reaction solution was<br>
passed through a sieve having a 1.68 mm mesh to remove<br>
agglomerates, moisture was separated by filtration, and<br>
 <br>
the obtained slurry was dewatered to obtain a bead-shaped<br>
polymer. The obtained bead-shaped polymer was washed<br>
with aqueous sodium hydroxide adjusted to a pH of about 8<br>
to 9.5, then dewatered in the same manner as above, and<br>
then repeatedly further washed with deionized water and<br>
dewatered to obtain polymer particles.<br>
The weight of the agglomerates was measured after<br>
drying for 12 hours in an 80°C drying oven. The amount<br>
of produced agglomerates (% by mass) was measured by<br>
dividing this weight by the total weight of the raw<br>
materials (I) and raw materials (II), to give a value of<br>
0.38 % by mass.<br>
The obtained polymer particles were dried for 12<br>
hours in an 80°C hot-air drying oven, and then removed<br>
from the drying oven. The angle of repose measured about<br>
1 hour later was 29°.<br>
Further, the average composition ratio Mh of the<br>
methyl acrylate in the methacrylic resin of the<br>
cumulative region area (%) 0 to 2% portion from the GPC<br>
region high molecular weight side was 2.5 % by mass, the<br>
average composition ratio Ml of the methyl acrylate in<br>
the methacrylic resin of the cumulative region area (%)<br>
98 to 100% portion of the GPC region was 0.4 % by mass,<br>
and the average particle size was 0.29 mm.<br>
The amount of particles remaining on the pan after<br>
passing through a sieve having particle size apertures of<br>
 <br>
150 |am was 2.3 % by mass. Further, the water content of<br>
the obtained polymer particles was 0.56 % by mass.<br>
The obtained polymer particles were melt-kneaded<br>
with a ≤)≥30 mm twin-screw extruder set to 240°C, and the<br>
strands were cooled and cut to obtain resin pellets. It<br>
was confirmed that extrusion processability during this<br>
operation was good.<br>

materials of polymer (I) in Example 1 until the<br>
exothermic peak was observed, as well as the retention<br>
temperature and retention time since the exothermic peak<br>
was observed, and also the time T2 from adding the raw<br>
materials of polymer (II) until the exothermic peak was<br>

Resin pellets were obtained in the same manner as in<br>
Example 1. During this operation, the extrusion<br>
processability was good.<br>
Further, the physical property measurement results<br>
of a molded article of the methacrylic resin from<br>
Examples 2, 3, 14, and 17 are shown in the following<br>
Table 5.<br>
[0089]<br>
[Comparative Example 1]<br>
 <br>
Two (2) kg of water, 65 g of calcium phosphate, 39 g<br>
of calcium carbonate, and 0.39 g of sodium lauryl sulfate<br>
were charged into a vessel having a stirring device to<br>
obtain a mixed solution (A).<br>
Next, 26 kg of water was charged into a 60 L reactor,<br>
the temperature was increased to 80°C, and then the mixed<br>
solution (A) and the raw materials of polymer (I) in the<br>
blending amounts shown in the following Table 1 were<br>
charged therein.<br>
Then, suspension polymerization was carried out by<br>
maintaining the temperature at about 80°C, and the<br>
exothermic peak 40 minutes after adding the polymer (I)<br>
raw materials was observed.<br>
Then, after holding for 30 minutes while maintaining<br>
at about 80°C, the raw materials of polymer (II) were<br>
charged into the reactor in the blending amounts shown in<br>
the following Table 1. Next, suspension polymerization<br>
was carried out by maintaining the temperature at about<br>
80°C, and the exothermic peak 210 minutes after adding<br>
the polymer (II) raw materials was observed.<br>
Subsequently, the temperature was increased to 92°C<br>
at a rate of l°C/min and the solution was aged for 60<br>
minutes, after which the polymerization reaction was<br>
essentially finished.<br>
 <br>
Next, the resultant mixture was cooled to 50°C, and<br>
then charged with 20 % by mass of sulfuric acid to<br>
dissolve the suspension agent.<br>
Next, the polymerization reaction solution was<br>
passed through a sieve having a 1.68 mm mesh to remove<br>
agglomerates, and the obtained bead-shaped polymer was<br>
washed twice with pure water to obtain polymer particles.<br>
The weight of the agglomerates was measured after<br>
drying for 12 hours in an 80°C drying oven. The amount<br>
of produced agglomerates (% by mass) was measured by<br>
dividing this weight by the total weight of the raw<br>
materials (I) and raw materials (II), to give a value of<br>
1.32 % by mass.<br>
The obtained polymer particles were dried for 12<br>
hours in an 80°C hot-air drying oven, and then removed<br>
from the drying oven. The angle of repose measured about<br>
1 hour later was 45°.<br>
The following Table 4 shows the angle of repose,<br>
agglomerate amount, pellet weight average molecular<br>
weight, ratio of the molecular weight component 1/5 or<br>
less the (Mp), the above Mh and Ml, Mw/Mn, average<br>
particle size, content of the components having a<br>
particle size of less than 0.15 mm, moisture content, and<br>
yellowness index difference of Comparative Example 1, and<br>
the results of evaluation thereof.<br>
 <br>
Further, the physical property measurement results<br>
of a molded article of the methacrylic resin from<br>
Comparative Example 1 are shown in the following Table 5.<br>
The obtained polymer fine particles were melt-<br>
kneaded with a ≤)≥30 mm twin-screw extruder set to 240°C,<br>
and the strands were cooled and cut to obtain resin<br>
pellets. During this operation, since the polymer<br>
particles did not flow and remained in the hopper, the<br>
polymer particles were charged while appropriately<br>
hitting the hopper.<br>
Further, the strands were not stable, and some of<br>
the strands snapped during the extrusion operation.<br>
[0090]<br>
[Comparative Examples 2 and 3]<br>
Polymerization was carried out in the same manner as<br>
in Comparative Example 1, except that the raw materials<br>
shown in the following Table 1 were used.<br>
The following Table 2 shows the time Tl from adding<br>
the raw materials of polymer (I) until the exothermic<br>
peak was observed, the retention temperature and<br>
retention time since the exothermic peak was observed,<br>
and also the time T2 from adding the raw materials of<br>
polymer (II) until the exothermic peak was observed.<br>
The following Table 4 shows the angle of repose,<br>
agglomerate amount, pellet weight average molecular<br>
weight, ratio of the molecular weight component 1/5 or<br>
 <br>
less the (Mp), the above Mh and Ml, Mw/Mn, average<br>
particle size, content of the components having a<br>
particle size of less than 0.15 mm, moisture content, and<br>
yellowness index difference of Comparative Examples 2 and<br>
3, and the results of evaluation thereof.<br>
For Comparative Example 3, the physical property<br>
measurement results of the molded article are shown in<br>
the following Table 5.<br>
Further, the obtained polymer fine particles were<br>
melt-kneaded with a ≤j≥30 mm twin-screw extruder set to<br>
240°C, and the strands were cooled and cut to obtain<br>
resin pellets. During this operation, since the polymer<br>
particles did not flow and remained in the hopper, the<br>
polymer particles were charged while appropriately<br>
hitting the hopper.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>

[0096]<br>
Polymer particles having an angle of repose in a<br>
predetermined range, like those of the Examples, did not<br>
clog in the hopper during the extrusion operation, had<br>
good processability, and also exhibited a low molded<br>
article yellowness index.<br>
Further, a comparison of the Examples and the<br>
Comparative Examples showed that when the relationship<br>
between the time (T1) from adding the polymer (I) raw<br>
materials until the exothermic peak and the time (T2)<br>
from adding the polymer (II) raw materials until the<br>
exothermic peak satisfied the relational expression 0.6 ≤<br>
T2/T1 ≤ 5, like in the Examples, the agglomerate amount<br>
is small, and a methacrylic resin having a small angle of<br>
repose can be obtained. Further, there were no flow<br>
defects in the hopper during the extrusion operation, and<br>
extrusion processability was excellent.<br>
From Tables 3 to 5, it can be seen that by setting<br>
the relationship of the polymerization times in the range<br>
0.6 ≤ T2/T1 ≤ 5, a methacrylic resin having a small angle<br>
of repose can be obtained. In addition, a comparison of<br>
Examples 2 and 3 with Comparative Example 3 showed that<br>
for the methacrylic resins obtained with the same blend<br>
composition, the methacrylic resin according to the<br>
present invention exhibits better colorless transparency,<br>
impact resistance, and solvent resistance, while<br>
 <br>
maintaining high heat resistance, than a methacrylic<br>
resin polymerized for a polymerization time outside the<br>
range of the present invention.<br>
