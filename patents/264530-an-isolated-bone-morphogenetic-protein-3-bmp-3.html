				<td>Bone morphogenetic protein 3 and osteogenic devices and pharmaceutical products containing thereof<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to bone formation inducing proteins called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), especially BMP-3c, nucleic acid molecules encoding said proteins, vectors containing said nucleic acid molecules and host cells expressing said proteins. The present invention relates also to the use of said bone morphogenetic proteins for treating disorders, such as disorders related to bone and cartilage formation. The present invention further relates to osteogenic devices and pharmaceutical compositions containing said proteins.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The phenomenon of osteoinduction was recognized by Lancroix in 1945 when he demonstrated that acid alcohol bone extracts induced heterotopic bone formation in ectopic sites. Twenty years later Urist and his co-workers decalcified bone matrix and observed new cartilage and bone formation when implanted intramuscularly. These discoveries led to isolation and purification of bone inducing agent named BMPs from bone matrix of different species and years later to cloning and characterization of several cDNAs encoding these novel proteins. The biological activity of BMPs has been determined by bioassay in rat or mouse muscle bounces or by ALP measurements in mammalian cell cultures.<br>
Previous studies since 1965 have shown that BMPs are part of the TGF-P super-family and like all the family members they have multiple effects on cell migration, growth and differentiation especially in bone formation and tissue repair but also in embryogenesis or cancer. They are low molecular weight hydrophobic glycopro-teins which are soluble to chaotrophic agents such as urea and guanidinium hy-drochloride but are resistant to several proteases, for example collagenases.<br>
BMPs are produced as large precursor molecules which are processed proteolyti-cally to mature peptides after the translation. Like all the members of TGF-3 super-family, BMPs have the pattern of seven cysteine residues in their C-temninal mature region. Between these cysteines there are three disulfide bonds within mature BMP monomers and one disulfide bond which combines two monomers into a biologically active BMP dimer.<br><br>
BMPs act through specific transmembrane receptors located on cell surface of the target cells. The BMP receptors are serin-threonin kinases which resemble TGF-P receptors and are divided into two subgroups: type I and type II receptors. BMPs can bind strongly only to the heterotetrameric complex of these receptors. This complex formation is essential to the BMP signal transduction. Inside the target cell, BMP signals are transmitted to the nucleus via specific signal molecules called Smads, which are also responsible for suppression of BMP signals.<br>
Until now, 16 different BMPs have been characterized and seven of them (BMPs 2-7 and 9) have shown to be able to induce bone formation when implanted in ectopic sites. According to the amino acid sequence of the mature part these BMPs are divided into two subgroups. BMPs 2 and 4 are 86 % identical and BMPs 5, 6 and 7 are 78 % identical. Between these two groups the identity is only about 56 %. The amino acid sequence of BMP-3 is about 45 % alike with BMPs 2 and 4 and BMP-9 is 50-55 % identical with BMPs 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Due to high homology and small variety in size, BMPs are quite difficult, very time consuming and expensive to separate, purify and identify from each other at protein level. This is the reason why most of the BMPs are nowadays being produced using molecular biological tools. Different kinds of recombinant protein techniques have been tested and both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems have been utilized.<br>
Majority of research has focused on human recombinant BMPs, but with regard to effective bone induction antlers of Cervidae family form an interesting research area. Antlers are bony cranial organs typical to the Cervidae family and they differ from Bovidae horns in their growing pattern. Antlers grow from the tip and males cast them away once per year. It has been suggested that antlers are the fastest growing structures through the mammalian species and they are known to be the only structures that regenerate completely every year. Antlers are formed by modified endochondral ossification meaning that the process is performed through the highly vascularized cartilage model which is calcified and finally transformed into bone. Antlers form an interesting model of adult regenerating mineralized tissue and bone remodeling has been shown to continue until the time of antler casting. Although the ultimate reason for the amazing speed of antler growth has not yet been resolved, antlers have been shown to contain several BMPs. Deer antler has been proven to express BMP-2 and BMP-4 (Feng et a/. 1997 Biochim Biophys Acta 1350:47-52; Feng et al. 1995 Biochim Biophys Acta 1263:163-168). In addition reindeer antlers express BMP-3b (Kapanen et al. 2002 J Biomed Mat Res<br>
59:78-83). Yet, it is also possible that there is one or more totally uncovered fac-tor(s) which are responsible for antler growth speed.<br>
Due to their osteoinductive capacity, both BMPs extracted from demineralized bone matrix and BMPs produced by recombinant technique, are very interesting and highly potential alternatives to bone grafting. Different BMPs have been used in many experimental and clinical studies.<br>
BMP-3 and 3b are important regulator molecules in bone induction and osteo-genesis. BMP-3 has been shown to be a major component of osteogenin, which has osteogenic activity, but still there is some contradictory information of biological activity of recombinant human BMP-3. According to some studies it posses osteogenic activity but some studies claim just the opposite and it has been shown to play an inhibitory role in the bone formation process being also a negative regulator of bone density. For example WO 02/43759 discloses methods and compositions for treatment of defects and disease involving osteoporosis or osteopenic conditions. Said methods comprise applying to the site of osteoporotic or osteopenic conditions a composition comprising a BMP-3 inhibitor or antagonist.<br>
Until now, BMP-3b has been the only BMP characterized in reindeer antler tissue (Kapanen et a/. 2002).<br>
US 6 245 889 discloses purified human BMP-2 and BMP-4 proteins and processes for producing them. Also a pharmaceutical composition comprising said BMP-4 is disclosed. As generally known in the art, these proteins and compositions may be used in the treatment of bone and cartilage defects and in wound healing and related tissue repair. Further, said pharmaceutical composition may include a matrix capable of delivering said BMP proteins to the site of bone and/or cartilage damage, providing a structure for the developing bone and cartilage and optimally capable of being resorbed into the body. Such matrices may be formed of materials presently in use for other implanted medical applications.<br>
US 5 399 677 discloses DMA molecules encoding mutant forms of bone morpho-genetic proteins. The mutant forms of BMP can be produced bacterially and refolded to produce biologically active homodimers or heterodimers of BMP. A method of making such mutant BMP is also disclosed. Said mutant forms are useful since they are correctly folded when produced in bacterial hosts.<br>
WO 98/51354 discloses osteogenic devices and methods of use thereof for repair of bone and cartilage defects. The method for producing new bone growth at bone defect site in a mammal comprises the step of implanting in a defect site a calcium phosphate matrix comprising at least one osteogenic protein. Said osteogenic proteins include several morphogens, such as bone morphogenetic proteins.<br>
EP 1131087 discloses further use for morphogenetic proteins, such as BMP proteins. It is shown that exposing cancer cells to morphogens inhibits cancer cell growth and causes such cells to differentiate away from the cancerous phenotype. The use of morphogen can influence cancer cell fate and, in turn, alleviate the symptoms of cancer.<br>
Although some applications of known BMP proteins as bone and cartilage forming inducers or for alleviating the symptoms of cancer are already known, there is still need for better methods for isolating such proteins and for better morphogenetic proteins, for example ones which possess more efficient bone forming properties or are more soluble. Such proteins would be useful for better therapeutic methods and applications. Also methods for producing such proteins would be useful.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Surprisingly in the present invention a new BMP-3 type protein, herein called BMP-3c protein, was discovered from reindeer. Despite having high sequence homology with already known BMP-3 proteins, BMP-3c has very advantageous properties related to bone and cartilage forming. Said properties are substantially better than the properties of the known corresponding BMP proteins. Said bone morphogenetic proteins of the present invention and homologues thereof are useful for inducing bone and cartilage formation in several kinds of applications, such as therapeutic applications.<br>
The reindeer BMP-3c protein of the present invention is 95 % homologous to already known reindeer BMP-3b protein and 93 % homologous to known human BMP-3b. As a BMP-3b counterpart of reindeer was already known, the new protein of the invention was named BMP-3c.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Among mammalian species the homology of previously known BMP-3 mature parts is high. Cloning and characterization of reindeer BMP-3c mature part revealed that at the amino acid level it has the highest homology with reindeer BMP-3b (95 %) and human BMP-3b (93 %).<br>
Nucleotide and amino acid homologies of BMP-3b and BMP-3 proteins between mammalian species are presented in table 1 and table 2, respectively. BMP-3b has previously been characterized from human, mouse and rat. The homology comparison at nucleotide level ranges between 87-92 % and at amino acid level between 94-97 %. In addition to earlier mentioned organisms BMP-3b has also been cloned from reindeer. The amino acid homology of BMP-3b from different mammalian origin ranges from 94—97 % and nucleotide homology from 87-92 %. The nucleotide sequence of reindeer BMP-3c and the corresponding amino acid sequence of partial cDNA of reindeer BMP-3c are shown in Figure 6. Generally BMP-3s have homology also with other types of BMPs.<br><br><br>

The following alignment shows the amino acid sequences of human and reindeer mature BMP-3b proteins and the reindeer BMP-3c of the present invention (made with ClustalX 1.8 program (Thompson, J.D., Higgins, D.G. and Gibson, T.J. (1994) Nucleic Acids Research, 22: 4673-4680), rdBMP-3c = reindeer BMP-3c, rdBMP-3b = reindeer BMP-3b, hBMP-3b = human BMP-3b, the asterisks show the identical amino acids).(Sequence Removed)<br>
The "BMP-3 protein of the invention" or "bone morphogenetic protein of the invention" refer to a protein having bone morphogenetic (or morphogenic as both words are used interchangeably) activity, such as BMP-3c isolated from reindeer as described herein (SEQ ID NO: 1 of the attached sequence listing or rdBMP-3c in the alignment above), and includes homologues, analogs, derivatives and fragments thereof. Such homologues or derivatives include functional derivatives of said protein, such as proteins derived from the original reindeer BMP-3c protein or any BMP from any species. The derivatives may differ in length and they may contain amino acid insertions, deletions and substitutions, as a person skilled in the art well knows. Characteristic for the BMP of the present invention, e.g. as disclosed in the alignment above, are the amino acids differing from the known BMP-3 proteins, such as the amino acids differing from the human BMP-3c or reindeer BMP-3c. Preferably the regions containing these amino acids are conserved in a BMP of the present invention. The amino acids 26 and 104 define the region containing amino acids differing from the reindeer BMP-3b counterpart and the amino acids 6 and 138 define the region containing amino acids differing from the human BMP-3b counterpart.<br>
On the other hand, insertions, deletions and substitutions located far outside said characteristic area may not be likely to cause substantial changes in the function, effect or folding of the BMP of the present invention. For example homologues having deletions, such as deletions of few amino acids, preferably 1-10 amino acids, more preferably 1-5 amino acids, most preferably 1-3 amino acids, in car-boxyl terminus or amino terminus resulting in shorter polypeptide are in the scope of the present invention as long as said deletions do not affect the characteristic amino acids of the BMP of the invention. It is preferred that said homologues have the advantageous properties of the original reindeer BMP-3c protein, said properties being related to said characteristic amino acids and/or the region around them. Said homologues may have amino acid substitutions which do not substan-<br><br>
tially affect the function and effect of the protein of the invention. For example an amino acid not located in the active site or near it may be substituted with another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties (e.g. hydrophobia or hydrophilic), i.e. conservative amino acid replacement, as long as said substitution does not substantially alter the function or folding of the mature protein. These kinds of substitutions are well known and understood in the art. Examples of such amino acid properties divided into groups are hydrophobic (Met, Ala, Val, Leu, lie), neutral hydrophilic (Cys, Ser, Thr), acidic (Asp, Glu), basic (Asn, Gin, His, Lys, Arg), residues that influence chain orientation (Gly, Pro) and aromatic (Trp, Tyr, Phe) amino acids. Substitutions within said groups are generally not likely to cause major changes in the structure of the polypeptide backbone (e.g. a sheet or helical conformation), the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule or the bulk of the side chain.<br>
The homologues of the BMP of the present invention include for example any known bone morphogenetic protein, such as BMP-3 or counterpart thereof, which contains or has been modified to contain at least part of the conserved amino acids or sequences as described above or corresponding area in a homologous BMP-3 protein in the case the numbering should differ. Also any currently unknown BMP-3c protein from any species modified as described above is in the scope of the invention.<br>
When compared to known reindeer BMP-3b protein, the BMP-3c has one inserted amino acid R26 and five substituted amino acids W30, D31, K75, M76 and V104 calculated from the mature BMP-3c protein as disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 1. When compared to known human BMP-3b protein, the BMP-3c has nine substituted amino acids D6, S11, K27, S66, M76, V95, S109, E133 and Q138 defined from the mature BMP-3c protein as disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 1. These amino acids are characteristic for the BMP of the present invention. However, as E133 and Q138 are located in the carboxy terminal end of the mature protein, they may not play a major role in the function of the protein.<br>
In one embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP-3 containing a consensus sequence of the BMP-3 family. One example of such consensus sequence is the sequence below derived from the following ClustalX alignment wherein several BMP-3 proteins from different species are aligned, said sequence corresponding the amino acids 26-104 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In said consensus sequence the characteristic amino acids of rdBMP-3c differing from known rdBMP-<br><br>
3b (one inserted amino acid R26 and five substituted ammo acids W30, D31, K75, M76 and V104) are fixed but other conservative variations among BMP-3 family are allowed. (Sequence Removed)<br>
Also other consensus sequences may be defined, for example ones defining an area between amino acids 6-104, 6-109 or 6-138 of SEQ ID NO: 1, or similar sequences differing in length, e.g. by 1-20 amino acids. Such consensus sequences may be defined from the alignment below or similar alignments made by aligning different related BMP proteins. The BMP sequences aligned are from reindeer, human, rat and African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis).<br>
(Sequence Removed)<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention said BMP is any BMP or homologue, derivative or fragment thereof comprising the amino acids 26-104 of the SEQ ID NO: 1. Said amino acid locations are calculated from amino terminus of any general mature BMP-3 protein, such as the BMP-3c protein of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a homologue, derivative or fragment thereof, wherein the sequence at the amino terminus begins with RKKGQ, as for example in reindeer (see the sequence alignment above or SEQ ID NO: 1), or at the corresponding area. If there were any insertions or deletions of amino acids in the amino acid sequence of said homologue affecting the numbering, these should be taken into account when defining the location of said essential amino acids, for example by aligning the sequences as described and then defining the locations of said amino acids. However, any of said homologues of the BMP should substantially have the function and efficiency disclosed herein. Because all the known BMP-3 proteins are highly conserved, defining the location of said essential amino acids is unambiguous, such as in the case of human BMP-3b. For example in rdBMP-3b there is a one amino acid deletion when compared to rdBMP-3c, as shown in the alignment above, but still the corresponding amino acids in the compared sequences can be defined easily. Also, said locations can be easily defined also from other BPMs (see the alignment above). Generally such level of homology may be at least 70 %, preferably 80 %, more preferably 93 % and most preferably 95 % at the amino acid level.<br>
In another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP or homologue, derivative or fragment thereof containing the amino acids 6-104 of the SEQ ID NO: 1. In another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP or homologue, derivative or fragment thereof containing the amino acids 6-109 of the SEQ ID NO: 1. In another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP or homologue, derivative or fragment thereof containing the amino acids 6-138 of the SEQ ID NO: 1. In still another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is a BMP-3 protein. In still another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is BMP-3 or homologue, derivative or fragment thereof containing the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. The homologues, derivatives or fragments mentioned in these embodiments shall contain at least one of the characteristic amino acids described above. Said homologues, derivatives or fragments do not include the known BMP-3 proteins as such, such as hBMP-3b or rdBMP-3b, since they do not contain said characteristic amino acids of the BMP-3c of the present invention. However, a known BMP, such as BMP-3, modified to contain at least one of said characteristic amino acids may be considered as such homologue, derivative or fragment.<br><br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides the BMP as described above with a heparin binding site (HBS). Generally this is an amino acid sequence capable of binding heparin. In one embodiment said heparin binding site is located at the amino terminus of said BMP, such as before the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or functional homologue thereof. In one embodiment the heparin binding site contains amino acid sequence AKHKQRKRGT or QAKHKQRKRGT. Said heparin binding site may also be a functional homologue, derivative or fragment thereof. The heparin binding site improves the expression of the recombinant BMP protein and also enhances the biological activity thereof. Further, the heparin binding site significantly helps the expression of recombinant bone morphogenetic proteins in bacterial cells, such as E. coli.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides a nucleic acid molecule, such as a DMA or RNA molecule, encoding said BMP of the invention. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code there are a number of different nucleic acid sequences encoding the BMP of the invention. All such nucleic acid variants are in the scope of the present invention. Preferably said nucleic acid molecule is a DNA molecule. Examples of said DNA sequences are disclosed in figures 4-6.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides a replicable vector containing the nucleic acid molecule described above in operative association with an expression control sequence thereof. Such vector may be used for producing recombinant BMP of the present invention in a suitable host system.<br>
The nucleic acid encoding the BMP of the invention may be inserted into said replicable vector for cloning or for expression. Various vectors are publicly available. The vector may, for example, be in the form of a plasmid, cosmid, viral particle or phage. The appropriate nucleic acid sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general, DNA is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site(s) using techniques well known in the art. Vector components may include for example one or more signal sequence(s), an origin of replication, one or more marker .genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. Construction of such suitable vectors containing one or more of these components employs standard ligation techniques which are well-known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Generally said BMP may be produced recombinantly by expressing in any suitable host cell, such as in a bacterial host cell. Such methods are well-known in the art<br><br>
and they are described in literature. It is essential that the protein is folded properly during the expression and it contains the necessary post-translational modifications.<br>
It is not always possible to express and purify certain proteins properly, for example because of solubility or refolding problems. Usually E. coli can not make post-translational modifications typical for mammalian cell systems. However, the inventors of the present invention have produced recombinant reindeer BMP-3c mature part in E. coli and after purification and refolding managed to prove it to be in biologically active form.<br>
There are certain benefits when a protein, such as a BMP, is expressed in a bacterial host, such as E. coli. The protein generally shows lowered immunogenicity when compared to a similar protein expressed in for example yeast host. This may be useful later when the protein is utilized, for example administered as a medicament. E. coli produces proteins without modifications, such as glycosylation. This is particularly useful for proteins for which glycosylation is not a requirement, but which could be a problem if the protein is produced in other systems (e.g. yeast), which can over-glycosylate, or add inappropriate carbohydrates to the protein, which could lead to reduced or no activity of expressed protein and potentially create a risk of immunogenicity (Pedro de Noronha Pissarra: Recombinant DMA Proteins for the Biopharmaceutical Industry and the Future for Escherichia coli. Business Briefing: Pharma Outsourcing, London, 2004).<br>

In the following description and examples it is described how recombinant reindeer BMP-3c mature part with and without heparin-binding site (HBS) according to embodiments of the present invention was produced in E. coli. After purification and refolding the osteoinductive activity was verified by bioassay in mouse tight muscle pounches. The in vivo bioassay is a standard method used for assaying BMP activity since its discovery. It includes implantation of BMP in the hindquarter muscle of a mouse and estimation of heterotopic new bone induction after 10-21 days by radiology and histology.<br>
The osteoinduction was observed in all four study groups (1 mg, 3 mg, 5 mg and 8 mg of recombinant reindeer BMP-3c) and it was increased in dose dependent manner (Table 3).<br><br>

(Table Removed)Table 3. Comparison of the osteoinduction responses of reindeer BMP-3c-138 and BMP-3c11o proteins with different doses<br>
The results of the in vivo bioassay are shown in figure 7. Figure 7A is a reference and 7B is a sample implanted with BMP-3c of the present invention. The bioassay was carried out as described in Marshall R. Urist, J. J. Chang, A. Lietze, Y. K. Huo, A. G. Brownell and R. J. DeLange (1987): Preparation and Bioassay of Bone Morphogenetic Protein and Polypeptide Fragments, Methods Enzymol 146: 294-312.<br>
There were great difficulties to get recombinant rdBMP-3c mature part expressed in E. coli TOP10. Therefore, the inventors assumed that poor expression was caused by the high GC-content in N-terminal region of the mature part of rdBMP-3c. Because heparin binding site (HBS), existing in the beginning of the reindeer BMP-2 mature part, is coded by nucleotide sequence with low GC-content, a construct in which this HBS sequence was added in front of the rdBMP-3c mature part sequence was created and this way the inventors managed to improve the expression of recombinant.<br><br>
HBS located in the N-terminus of rdBMP-2 contains 10 basic amino acid residues and is reminiscent of known or postulated heparin-binding sites in other growth factors. It is also possible that the interaction between protein with HBS and extracellular matrix might have an important effect on the establishment of morpho-genetic gradients during development by limiting the free diffusion of a protein. Therefore, it was assumed that HBS could also improve the biological activity of recombinant rdBMP-3c by prolonging the duration of disappearance of protein from the implantation site.<br>
Examples<br>
Cloning ofcDNA of reindeer BMP-3c and homology comparison analysis<br>
PCR product around 400 bp was isolated and cloned into pGEM-T8 vector. The nucleotide sequence obtained from ABI Prism reactions was analyzed with computer and it was compared to already known human BMP sequences. Due to homology searches the newly cloned cDNA seemed to be more homologous with human BMP-3b (nucleotide homology 89 % and amino acid homology 93 %) as compared to human BMP-3 (nucleotide homology 69 % and amino acid homology 81 %). When compared to all known BMPs the newly cloned cDNA seemed to be most homologous with reindeer BMP-3b (nucleotide homology 96 % and amino acid homology 95 %). Therefore the cDNA of the present invention was named reindeer BMP-3c.<br>
Expression of reindeer BMP-3c mature part in TOP10, Rosetta and Origami E. coli cells<br>
In previous studies human BMP-3 has been produced in CHO cells, in E. coli cells and using retroviral system. Furthermore, human BMP-3 and rat BMP-3b have been produced as recombinant proteins using adenoviral system. Nevertheless, not any member of BMP-3 subfamily of deer animal origin has been produced as recombinant protein.<br>
The 414 nucleotide corresponding 136 amino acid long mature part of reindeer BMP-3c was subcloned from pGEM-T® into pTrcHis2A vector and the expression of the recombinant protein in E. coli TOP 10 (Invitrogen) was analyzed, but no induction was observed. It was concluded that this could possibly be caused by high GC content in the beginning of the rdBMP-3c. It was also noticed that heparin<br><br>
binding site existing in the beginning of reindeer BMP-2 mature part had very low GC content and by adding it in front of reindeer BMP-3c mature part it could also be utilized as a part of the purification procedure. Therefore, the mature part of BMP-3c/138 and BMP-3c/110 were cloned into pTrcHBS vector and pTrcHBSBMP-3c/138 and pTrcHBSBMP-3c/110 were obtained. Successful induction of both recombinant HBSrdBMP-3c/138 and HBSrdBMP-3c/110 was verified by SDS-PAGE and the expression level was high.<br>
To achieve protein expression of reindeer BMP-3c/138 and BMP-3c/110 proteins, another protein expression system was tested. Therefore pET22b(+) with His6-tag and pelB leader was chosen as new expression vector system. pETrd3c/138 and pETrd3c/110 vectors were constructed. Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) and Origami B (DE3) (Novagen) E. coli lines were used for expression. Successful IPTG inductions of recombinant rdBMP-3c with both constructs were verified by SDS-PAGE.<br>
Biological activity of recombinant reindeer BMP-3c/138 and BMP-3c/110<br>
When produced in CHO cells or E. coli system recombinant human BMP-3 has shown osteogenic activity in bioassay, but when retroviral and adenoviral systems were used to produce recombinant human BMP-3 no osteogenic function was observed. Using adenoviral vector system, BMP-3b has been observed to act in syn-ergetic manner with BMP-2 in bone formation procedure but it failed to cause bone induction on its own. Nevertheless, BMP-3 of deer animal origin (Cervidae family) has not been even cloned and earlier cloned BMP-3b of reindeer origin has not been tested for its biological activity.<br>
In this study it is showed that new member of BMP-3 subfamily, recombinant reindeer BMP-3c, produced in E. coli cells cause new bone formation when implanted in mouse tight muscle pouches with collagen sponge.<br>

A. FiNA isolation<br>
The antlers of a 3-year-old male reindeer were cut off and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after slaughtering. The frozen antlers were cut in 0.5 cm slices and stored at -70°C. Reindeer antler mRNA was isolated using the QuickPrep® Micro<br><br>
mRNA Purification Kit (Pharmacia Biotech). A part of the reindeer antler slice was cut in small pieces (about 1 mm3) and 0.1 g of this tissue was added to 0.6 ml of Extraction Buffer containing guanidinium thiocyanate and N-lauroyl sarcosine. The tissue was homogenized with Ultra Turrax for 3 times 10 seconds on ice and cooled between every homogenization. 1.2 ml of Elution Buffer was added and suspension was further homogenized for 1 time 10 seconds. A uniform suspension was obtained.<br>
The reindeer antler homogenate and Oligo(dT)-Cellulose were centrifuged at top speed [14,000 rpm, RT, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 1 minute. The buffer from the Oligo(dT)-Cellulose pellet was removed and the cleared tissue homogenate was placed on the top of it. The tube was inverted to resuspend the Oligo(dT)-Cellulose pellet. The suspension was gently mixed for 5 minutes and centrifuged at top speed [14,000 rpm, RT, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 10 seconds. The supernatant was discarded.<br>
Oligo(dT)-Cellulose was resuspended in High-Salt Buffer [10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCI] and suspension was centrifuged at top speed [14,000 rpm, RT, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 10 seconds. Washings with High-Salt Buffer were repeated for 5 times and 2 additional times with Low-Salt Buffer [10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCI]. 3 ml Low-Salt Buffer was added and suspension was transferred to MicroSpin Column. The MicroSpin Column was placed in Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at top speed for 5 seconds. Oligo(dT)-Cellulose in the column was rinsed for 3 times with Low-Salt Buffer.<br>
The reindeer antler mRNA was eluted to a clean Eppendorf tube from the Micro-Spin Column by adding 0.2 ml 65°C Elution Buffer (QuickPrep® Micro mRNA Purification Kit, Pharmacia Biotech) to the column and centrifuging at top speed [14,000 rpm, RT, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 5 seconds. The elution step was repeated twice. The isolated mRNA was precipitated by adding 5 µl of glyco-gen solution (5-10 mg/ml in DEPC-treated H2O), 1/10 volume K Acetate solution (2.5 M potassium acetate, pH 5.0) and 0.5 ml absolute ethanoi (chilled to -20°C) to each elution. Precipitation was allowed to occur at -20°C for at least 30 minutes and mRNA was centrifuged at top speed [14,000 rpm, 4*C, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 5 minutes. Precipitated mRNA was stored at -70°C until cDNA synthesis was performed.<br><br>
B.	cDNA synthesis<br>
Reverse transcription of the reindeer antler mRNA was performed by modifying the instructions of the Time Saver™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Pharmacia Biotech). 3 pg of mRNA was heat-denatured at 65°C for 10 minutes and chilled on ice. 0.2 umol DTT, 0.5 ug Oligo(dT)12-i8 Primer and heat-denatured mRNA were added to First strand reaction mix containing FPLCpure™ Cloned Murine Reverse Tran-scriptase, RNAguard™, RNase/DNase-Free BSA, dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP) in aqueous buffer (Time Saver™ cDNA Synthesis Kit, Pharmacia Biotech). The mixed solution was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After the incubation, the First strand reaction mix was added to the Second strand reaction mix containing E. coli RNase H and E. coli DNA polymerase I and dNTPs in aqueous buffer (Time Saver™ cDNA Synthesis Kit, Pharmacia Biotech). The solution was mixed gently and incubated in RT for 30 minutes. The synthesized cDNA was stored at 4°C.<br>
C.	Screening of reindeer antler cDNA<br>
The part of the cDNA of the reindeer BMP-3c was amplified by PCR (Polymerase<br>
chain reaction) method using degenerative primers (5-<br>
CGCAA(A/G)GACCGCA(A/G)GAAGAA(A/G)GGC-3')	and	(3-<br>
TC(T/C)GT(A/G)GAGACCTGTGCCTG(T/C)CAA-5') designed on the basis of ho-mology of already known BMP-3b genes of the different mammalian species (human, rat and mouse). In addition to 100 ng of reindeer antler cDNA and 40 pmol of each primers the 50 pi of PCR reaction mixture contained 0.4 mM dNTPs (PCR Core Kit, Roche) and 0.7 U/ul Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix (thermostable Taq polymerase + proofreading polymerase, Roche) in Expand High Fidelity buffer with MgCI2 (Expand High Fidelity PCR System, Roche). The reaction was performed under the foHowing program using Mastercycler personal apparatus (Eppendorf): initial denaturation at 94eC for 4 minutes and 25 cycles of denaturation 94°C for 1 minute, annealing of the primers 55°C for 1 minute, elongation of DNA strands 72°C for 2 minutes. The final extension was performed at 72°C for 10 minutes.<br>
D.	Cloning into pGEM-T vector<br>
The PCR products were purified straight from the PCR reaction mix by Wizard® PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega) and ligated into the pGEM®-T vector (Figure 1) by T4 DNA Ligase (pGEM®-T Vector System I; Promega). 0.3 ug<br><br>
of purified PCR product and 2.3 pg/ml of pGEM®-T vector were added to ligation buffer containing 18 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.8), 6 mM MgClz, 6 mM DTT, 0.3 mM ATP, 3 % polyethylene glycol and 0.14 U/µl T4 DMA Ligase in total volume of 66 pi. The reaction was allowed to occur at +16°C water bath which was allowed to cool to +4 °C overnight. The newly formed plasmid was named as pGEMrd3c/142 (Figure 1).<br>
E. The production of competent Escherichia coli TOP10 F' cells<br>
The competent Escherichia coli TOP10 F1 cells were produced by the calcium chloride/ magnesium chloride procedure. 2 ml of LB-medium was inoculated with<br>
E.	coli TOP10 F' cells and grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (225 rpm). Next<br>
morning 100 ml of fresh LB medium was inoculated with 1 ml of overnight culture<br>
and the culture was grown at 37°C with shaking (225 rpm) to an OD6oo of 0.5-0.6.<br>
The cultured cells were collected by centrifugation (2500 x g, 5 min), resuspended<br>
in 10 ml of 0.1 M MgCI2 solution and collected again by centrifugation (2500 x g, 5<br>
min). After the MgCI2 treatment the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of 0.1 M<br>
CaCI2 solution, incubated in ice bath for 30 minutes and recollected by centrifuga<br>
tion (2500 x g, 5 min). The CaCI2 treatment was repeated except that in the sec<br>
ond time 3.5 ml of CaCl2 was used and the incubation time was 1 hour. Glycerol<br>
was added to suspension to final concentration of 14 % (v/v) and the solution was<br>
divided into 200 pi portions. The competent £. coli TOP10 F1 cells were frozen in<br>
liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C.<br>
F.	Transformation of the competent Escherichia coli TOP10 F' cells and selection<br>
of clones containing reindeer BMP-3c<br>
The competent Escherichia CO//TOP10 F' cells were melted in ice bath for 15 minutes. 20 µl of ligation mix (described above) was added to 100 pi of TCM (10 mM Tris-HCI, 10mM CaCI2, 10 mM MgCl2, pH 7.0) and mixed with 200 ul of the competent E. coli cells. The mixture was incubated in ice bath for 30 minutes before the heat shock (43°C, 3 minutes). After the heat shock 800 pi of LB medium was added and the cells were allowed to regenerate for 30 minutes at 37 °C. The transformed cells were collected by centrifugation at top speed for 2 minutes and re-suspended to 30 pi of growth medium. The cell suspension was plated to two LB plates containing 25 pg/ml ampicillin covered with 1 mmol IPTG (isopropyl-B-D-thiogalactopyranoside) and 2.4 nmol X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-B-D-galactoside) and the cells were grown at the plates overnight at 37°C. The positive clones were recognized by blue color formation based on a-complementation of<br><br>
lacZ gene. The method is described in detail in Sambrook and Russel (2001), Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York.<br>
G. Isolation ofpGEMrdSc plasmids and sequencing ofcDNA inserts<br>
The plasmids were isolated by Wizard® Plus Minipreps DMA Purification System (Promega) and then further purified by ethanol precipitation. The cDNA identity was confirmed by sequencing with ABI Prism (Perkin-Elmer Corporation). The sequencing reaction was performed using DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Mastercycler Personel apparatus (Ep-pendorf). The primers in the PCR reaction for sequencing were (5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGA-3') and (31- ATTTAGGTGACACTATA-GAATAC-5') and the program was as follows: 25 cycles of denaturation 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing 50°C for 15 seconds, elongation for 60°C. The amplified PCR products were precipitated by ethanol precipitation method. In 10 pi reaction 1 pi of 1.5 M Na-acetate - 250 mM EDTA buffer and 95-100 % ethanol was added so that the final ethanol concentration was 75 %. The precipitation was allowed to occur in ice bath for 7 minutes and then the mixture was centrifuged for 20 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed with 125 pi of 70 % ethanol in RT. The solution was centrifuged briefly and the washing ethanol was removed as precisely as possible. The pellet was dried in 37°C for a few minutes until all the ethanol was completely fumed. The ABI Prism apparatus was located in Department of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Oulu, Finland and the final sequencing was performed there. The nucleotide sequence and the corresponding amino acid sequence of partial cDNA of reindeer BMP-3c is seen in figure 6.<br>
Example 2: Expression of the recombinant reindeer BMP-3c mature part in Escherichia co//TOP10 F, Origami B (DE3) and Rosetta (DE3) cells<br>
A. Amplification of the mature part of reindeer BMP-3c for expression vector<br>
The mature part of reindeer BMP-3c was amplified from the pGEM3c/142 plasmid by PCR method using homology primers (5'- GGATCCGAGGAA-GAAGGGCCAGGATGTTTTC-3') and (31- AAGCTTTTGGCAGGCA-CAGGTCTCCAC-5') (see Example 2 Part B). There were recognition sites for restriction enzymes Bam HI and Hind III at the 5'- and 3'-end of primers respectively.<br><br>
In addition to 0.05 pg of pGEMrd3c/142 plasmid and 40 pmol of each primers the 50 pi of PCR reaction mixture contained 0.4 mM dNTPs (PCR Core Kit, Roche) and 0.7 U/pl Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix (thermostable Taq polymerase + proofreading polymerase, Roche) in Expand High Fidelity buffer with MgCb (Roche). The PCR reaction was performed under the following program using Mastercycler personel apparatus (Eppendorf): initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 minutes and 25 cycles of denaturation 94°C for 1 minute, annealing of the primers 55°C for 1 minute, elongation of DMA strands 72°C for 2 minutes. The final extension was performed at 72 "C for 10 minutes. The PCR product was purified directly from the PCR reaction mixture using Wizard® PCR Preps (Promega) and ligated to the pGEM®-T vector. The newly formed plasmid with the mature part of the reindeer BMP-3c was named as pGEMrd3c/138 (figure 1).<br>
B. Subcloning of the mature part of reindeer BMP-3c from pGEM®-T vector to the expression vector pTrcHis 2A (Invitrogen) and transformation of the competent Escherichia coli TOP10 F' cells<br>
The subcloning of the mature part of reindeer BMP-3c from pGEMrd3c/138 to the expression vector pTrcHis 2A (figure 2) was accomplished by first digesting the mature part off from pGEMrd3c/138 using Bam HI and Hind III restriction enzymes and then ligating the insert to pTrcHis 2A digested with the same enzymes. The Bam HI (Roche) and Hind III (Roche) digestion of pGEMrd3c/138 and pTrcHis 2A (1 pg) was performed in 10 pi of 10 mM Tris-HCI, 10 mM NaCI, 5 mM MgCI2, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0 (SuRE/Cut Buffer B, Roche) with 1 U/pl of each restriction enzyme. The reaction was allowed to occur for 1.5 hours in 37°C and then the restriction enzymes were inactivated by heating in 65°C for 20 minutes and freezing in -20°C. Ligation was performed in 2x Rapid Ligation Buffer (supplied with pGEM^-T vector by Promega) in +16°C water bath which was allowed slowly to cool down to +4°C overnight (ligase concentration 0.1 U/pl).<br>
The newly formed construct was checked by sequencing (protocol is described in Example 1 Part G) using primers (S'-AGAGGTATATATTAATGTATCG-S1) and (3'-ATGGTCGACGGCGCTATTCAG-5'). Expression vector containing pTrcHis 2A plus the reindeer BMP-3c mature part cDNA was named as pTrcrd3c (figure 2).

The recombinant reindeer BMP-3c expressed from pETrdSc in Escherichia coli Origami B (DE3) or Rosetta (DE3) cells was precipitated by isoelectric precipitation in pH 9.54 (pETrd3c/138) and pH 6.35 (pETrd3c/110). Isoelectric point was determined by computer calculations according to amino acid sequence of the recombinant reindeer BMP-3c (Figure 5). The precipitant was collected by centrifu-gation (12 000 x g, 30 min, RT) and resuspended in lysis buffer (6 M GuHCI - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI; pH 8.0).<br>
C.	Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)<br>
In IMAC method, pre-packed HiTrap Chelating HP affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. Columns were charged with Co2+-, Cu2+- or Ni2+-ions according to instruction manual applied by supplier. After column charging, filtered supernatant from washing steps was applied in column. Majority of impurities was removed by washing the column with lysis buffer (6 M GuHCI - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI, pH 8.0) 5-10 times the bed volume. Second washing was performed with 5-10 times bed volume of buffer in which 6 M GuHCI of lysis buffer was replaced by 6 M Urea. Recombinant reindeer BMP-3c was eluted from the HiTrap column by pH gradient from pH 7.0 to pH 4.0 (6 M Urea - 20 mM Na-phosphate — 0.5 M NaCI). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the ones containing approximately pure recombinant rdBMP-3c were combined for refolding.<br>
 D. Refolding of recombinant rdBMP-3c mature part<br>
The BMP-3c fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE were pooled and dialyzed against water. After dialysis precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation and resus-pended in 8 M Urea, 0.1 M Tris/HCI, pH 8 in the presence of 100 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and incubated for 2 h at 25 degrees. The pH was lowered to pH 3-4 by drop wise addition of 1 M HCI. The DTT was removed completely by dialysis against 6 M urea, 10 mM HCI for 2 h at 25 degrees. Dialysis was continued at 4°C overnight against 6 M urea. Refolding of recombinant rdBMP-3c was performed by two-step dialysis. The first dialysis solution was 20 mM Tris-HCI -150 mM NaCI -3 M urea (pH 7.5). The dialysis water was changed at least six times during two to three days. Desalted sample was centrifuged and pellet was dried by lyophiliza-tion. At that point the purity of BMP-3c was 75 % and its refolding measured by non-reducing SDS-PAGE was 50 %. Quantification of the refolded dimer of recombinant reindeer BMP-3c on Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gels was done densitometrically.<br>

Two complementary primers seen in Table 4 were designed using heparin binding site (HBS) of the reindeer BMP-2 as a model. Bam HI and Kpn I restriction sites were added in 5' and 3' ends of HBS, respectively. The primers were first denatured in +100°C for 5 min and then annealed by allowing a small +100°C water bath to cool down to room temperature and further to +4°C (1h). Both annealed HBS fragment (1 ug) and pTrcHis 2A vector (0.5 ug) were digested by Bam HI (1 U/ul) and Kpn I (2 U/gl) in Multi-Core buffer (Promega) in +37 °C for 1.5 hours and ligated in +16°C water bath which was allowed to cool down to +4°C overnight.

Example 6: Purification and refolding of recombinant reindeer BMP-3c/138 and BMP3c/110 mature part with heparin binding site (HBSrdBMP-3c)<br>
A. IMAC purification for HBSrdBMP-3c<br>
Escherichia coli cells were lysed by shaking in 6 M GuHCI - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI (pH 8.0) for 2 hours and filtrated through 45 urn filter. In IMAC purification method, pre-packed HiTrap Chelating HP affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. Columns were charged with Co2*, Cu2+ or Ni2+ ions according to instruction manual applied by supplier. Filtrated lysate was applied to the column and washed with 15 times the bed volume of lysis buffer. Second washing step was performed by 40 times the bed volume of 6 M urea - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI (pH 7.5). In third washing buffer there was 0.05 M imidazole added into second washing buffer and the washing volume was 15 times the bed volume. Recombinant HBSrdBMP-3c was eluted from the column by imidazole gradient from 0.05 M to 0.5 M in 6 M urea - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI (pH 7.5). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the ones containing the most highly purified recombinant HBSrdBMP-6 were combined and dialyzed against 100 mM Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) over the weekend. Precipitated recombinant protein was collated by centrifugation and solved in 8 M urea -100 mM Na-phosphate - 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5). Before heparin affinity column purification the recombinant protein solution was filtrated through 45 urn filter.<br><br>

Example 7: The biological activity test of recombinant reindeer BMP-3c/138 and BMP-3c/110 mature part with and without heparin binding site<br>
The biological activity of the lyophilized recombinant reindeer BMP-3c/138, BMP-3C/110, HBSrdBMP-3c/138 and HBSrdBMP-3c/110 was tested by implanting 1 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg of recombinant protein absorbed into Lyostrypt® collagen sponge or gelatin capsule in mouse tight muscle pouches. BSA was used as control. The hind legs were roentgenographed and the implant sites dissected and fixed in 10 % neutral formalin solution. Fixed implants were cut into 7 pm sections and stained with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Sections were examined with a light microscope. The new bone formation as an area and optical density was evaluated by radiographs. The radiographic images were transferred into a computer by using an optical scanner (HP Scan Jet, Hewlett Packard, USA). Ectopic and or-thopic new bone formations were evaluated as the areas (mm2) of calcified tissue visible in the radiographs defined by using the Scion Image Beta 4.02 (Scion Corp., USA) software. The mean optical density (mmAI) of the defined area was measured with the same equipment. Calibration of the optical density was performed by using an aluminum wedge (Al) with 0.25 mmAI steps, giving a calibrated density range up to 4 mmAI.<br>
 Results<br>
Cloning of partial cDNA of reindeer BMP-3c<br>
The nucleotide sequence obtained from ABI Prism reactions was analyzed with computer and it was compared to already known BMP sequences. Due to homol-ogy searches the newly cloned cDNA seemed to be most homological with reindeer BMP-3b (nucleotide homology 96 % and amino acid homology 95 %) and with human BMP-3b (amino acid homology 93 %), Table 1. The homologies of BMP-3c protein with the other mammalian BMP-3 proteins was highest by human BMP-3 (amino acid homology 91 %), Table 2.<br>
Expression of reindeer BMP-3c mature part<br>
First, two different parts of mature reindeer BMP-3c were inserted into pTrcHis2A vector and E. coli TOP 10 cells were transformed by resulted pTrcrd3c/138 and pTrcrd3c/110 vectors. Expression of recombinant protein was induced by IPTG. Recombinant protein production was checked by SDS-PAGE, but no induction was observed with both vectors. This was expected to be caused by several codons in rdBMP-3c which were rare for E. coli codon usage. It could be also possibly, that it is caused by slightly high GC content in the beginning of both rdBMP-3c protein coding sequence (by BMP-3c/138 the first 10 codons have a GC content of 53 % and by BMP-3c/110 63 %).<br>
Because of these facts it was decided to try another vector system with different E. coli cell lines. pET22b(+) (Novagen) with His6-tag and pelB leader were chosen as the new expression vector and Rosetta (DE3) and Origami B (DE3) E. coli lines were chosen for expression. The DMA of both parts of the mature reindeer BMP-3c coding proteins were cloned into pET22b(+) and new plasmids were named as pETrd3c/138 and pETrd3c/110 and both Rosetta (DE3) and Origami B (DE3) ceHs were transformed with these constructed vectors. When analyzed in SDS-PAGE, overexpression of rdBMP-3c proteins was observed (Figure 8). Dae to expression studies mainly Rosetta (DE3) cells with pETrdSc vectors were used in producing recombinant rdBMP-3c proteins.<br>
 Purification of rdBMP-3c proteins<br>
Recombinant reindeer rdBMP-3c proteins were overexpressed in E. coli. After the wash treatment, isoelectric point precipitation and solubilization of the inclusion bodies the content of recombinant reindeer rdBMP-3c was 85 %.<br>
The next purification step was the immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). After the elution of the column with pH gradient, the purity of rdBMP-3c measured from the SDS-PAGE was up to 75 % (Figure 8). The isolated protein with the mature part of rdBMP-3c/138 had a MW of 20,400 Da and with the mature part of rdBMP-3c/110, 17,100 Da as shown by the electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.<br>
Purification of HBSrdBMP-3c proteins<br>
Recombinant reindeer HBSrdBMP-3c/138 and HBSrdBMP-3c/110 proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and produced as inclusion bodies (IBs). After the wash treatment, isoelectric point precipitation and solubilization of the inclusion bodies the content of recombinant reindeer HBSrdBMP-3c was 50 %.<br>
The next purification step was the affinity chromatography (IMAC and Heparin). After the elution of the columns, the purity of HBSrdBMP-3c measured from the SDS-PAGE was up to 90 %. The isolated proteins with the mature part of HBSrdBMP-3c/138 had a MW of 20,300 Da and HBSrdBMP-3c/110 17,000 Da as shown by the electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.<br>
Refolding and activity tests of rdBMP-3c/138, rdBMP-3c/110, HBSrd3c/138 and HBSrd3c/110<br>
The in vitro refolding of the denatured rdBMP-3c proteins was quantified by measuring of the refold dimer of the protein on Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gels densitometrically. The amount of refolding measured by non-reducing SDS-PAGE was by the rdBMP-3c proteins without HBS 50 % and by the HBSrdBMP-3c over 70%.<br>
The osteoinductive activity induced by rdBMP-3c proteins without HBS was increased in dose dependent manner at least until 5 mg (Table 3). When compared the biological activity of BMP-3c/138 to BMP-3c/110 it seemed, that BMP-3c/110<br><br>
was more potent inducer of bone formation. The fact, that refolding was 20 % higher by the rdBMP-3c with HBS than without HBS, makes the HBSrdBMP-3c of great value.<br>
