NIPPER DEVICE FOR A COMBER MACHINE<br>
The invention relates to a nipper device for a combing machine, with a nipper frame capable of backwards and fonA/ards movement which exhibits a lower nipper plate which in the area of the nip lip can form a nip or point of grip with an upper nipper plate which is mounted such as to be movable in the nipper frame, and means located inside the nipper device for feeding a fibre mass during the forwards and/or backwards movement of the nipper device, whereby a pair of detaching rollers are arranged in the machine frame downstream of the nipper device and with a circular comb rotatably mounted and arranged below the lower nipper plate for combing out fibre tufts.<br>
In practice it is necessary for the fraction which is to be combed out at the comber machine (referred to in brief as comber waste or noil) to be adjusted to suit requirements. The noil fraction varies between 5 and 20 %, and as a rule depends on the quality of yarn desired, which is derived from the subsequent final spinning of the combed fibre mass. In addition to this, the noil fraction depends on the fibre mass which is presented (material feed).<br>
In other words, with a high combing volume, the long fibres remain in the combed-out fibrous mass, while the short fibres almost entirely end up in the noil outlet. These long fibres can then be used to manufacture very fine yarns, since substantially fewer fibres are required in the cross-section of the yarn without the yarn strength required being impaired. A high noil fraction naturally has a direct effect on the production volume, which in the final analysis directly influences the performance of the spinning mill itself. Accordingly, it is essential for the spinning mill operator to strike a balance between the required quality of the yam and the loss of production volume due to the fraction which is combed out. The result of this is that the choice of the degree of combing out is of very great significance. During the combing process, therefore, attention must be paid to ensuring that the selection of the fibres can be implemented precisely.<br><br><br><br>
*<br>

There are a number of different methods known which now make it possible to adjust the comber machine and its combing devices to an appropriate combing-out setting.<br>
One method is the adjustment of the detachment setting, which characterises the distance interval between the nip lip of the lower nipper plate and the nip point of the detaching rollers. A large detachment setting results in high combing out, while with a small detachment setting a small combing out volume is achieved. To adjust the detachment setting, the coupling on the nipper shaft is rotated, so that the position of the oscillation movement or the pivoting of the nipper is changed by a corresponding amount, which results in the detaching setting becoming larger or smaller depending on the adjustment. In addition to this, it is possible for the fraction combed out to be influenced by the choice of the type of feed from the feed rollers. If the feed volume is conducted from the feed cylinders in the pre-run to the nipper (forward feed), the combing-out is smaller than if this were to take place in the return run of the roller (backward feed). Because in backward feed almost the whole of the feed amount is presented to the circular comb during combing-out, the fraction which is combed out is also larger than with forward feed. The principle is also known of providing for a mixed feed, whereby a part of the feed volume is introduced in the pre-run, and the remaining part in the return run. Mixed forms are also possible, whereby the combing-out is adjusted by means of the selection of the feed type and the detaching setting.<br>
With the measures described heretofore, it is possible in part to achieve good results, but short fibres repeatedly pass into the combed-out fibre fleece, which has a disadvantageous effect on the desired quality. This situation arises in particular if it is necessary to work with a large detaching setting in order to increase the noil fraction. As soon as the distance interval between the nip point of the detachment rollers and the nipper is increased, the detachment distance also increases, and the length of the fibre mass involved in the drafting process during the detachment procedure. The greater this length is, the more floating (short) fibres are present in this area. These floating fibres are uncontrolled. As a result, it is not determined whether these fibres are now carried along during the detachment process (which has the same significance as a drafting process), or<br><br>
19.12.2003 FRH/ps -2963A/E<br>
3<br>
whether they are retained and combed out by the circular comb during the subsequent combing-out process.<br>
The task of the invention is therefore to propose a device with which it is possible for the detachment distance to be kept constantly as small as possible, so that the approximate proportions of a conventional drawing frame can be achieved, but whereby the possibility of adjusting the noil fraction within one type of feed is to be retained.<br>
This task is resolved by making provision for means by which the length of the fibre tuft presented to the comb segment of the circular comb can be changed, while the distance interval (detaching setting) between the lower nipper plate and the nip line of the detachment roller pair in the front end position of the nipper device remains the same.<br>
This makes it possible for the detachment distance to be optimally adjusted to the individual staple of the fibre mass, without the setting applied to the desired combing-out being impaired. By means of this arrangement it can be guaranteed that at every setting, by way of suitable means which, for example, define the path for the fibre mass or lap sheet between a feed means (e.g. feed roller) and the nip point of the nipper, consistent conditions will be provided during the detachment process. In other words, it is possible for the detachment distance to be adjusted to a minimum value which corresponds approximately to the value of the drafting distances on a conventional drafting arrangement. As a result, the proportion of uncontrolled fibres during the detachment process can be reduced to a minimum. At the same time, it is possible, under these conditions, for the noil fraction to be varied within specific limits, depending on the requirement.<br>
In order to vary the fibre length presented to the circular comb, it is proposed, for example, that the means consist of a guide part, which is located above the lower nipper plate in the area between the means for feeding and the nip point of the nipper device, and which guides the fibre mass on its underside.<br><br>
19.12.2003<br>
FRH/ps -.2963A/E	<br>
In this situation, the guide means, as further proposed, are connected in a detachable manner by securing means to the lower nipper plate, or the guide surface of the guide means can be altered in its position in relation to the nipper plate.<br>
In addition to this, the guide means can be secured in a pivotable manner transverse to the conveying direction of the lap sheet, as a result of which it is possible for a stepless or infinite adjustment to be carried out.<br>
For the lateral guidance of the lap sheet it is proposed that the guide means are provided in the vertical direction with lateral guide elements projecting over the guide surface. As a result of this, in particular, the side edges of the lap sheet are guided in this area, which allows for the wadding end to be guided specifically to the detachment cylinders located downstream.<br>
For preference, the guide means can exhibit a wedge-shaped cross-section, which follows on from a feed roller which interacts with a feeding trough.<br>
Further advantages are demonstrated on the basis of the following embodiments.<br>

Figure 1 shows a known nipper device 1 (referred to in brief as "nipper"), which is mounted so as to be capable of pivot movement via the crank arms 2, 3. In this situation, two crank amis 2 are mounted in each case to the side of a circular comb 4, on its circular comb shaft 5, in a manner such as to pivot. The circular comb 4 exhibits on a part of its circumference a comb segment 7. The other end of the pivot ami 2 is secured in a rotatable manner on the nipper frame 8. The rear pivot arm 3 (there may also be two of these) is mounted in a torsionally-resistant manner on a nipper shaft 10. The free end of the pivot arm 3, located opposite, is connected by means of a shaft 9 in a rotationally movable manner to the nipper frame 8.<br>
The nipper 1 consists essentially of a lower nipper plate 12, securely connected to the nipper frame 8, and an upper nipper plate 14 (in part also referred to as the nipper blade), which is secured to two pivot arms 15,15'. These pivot arms are located in a pivotable manner by means of a pivot axle 16 to the nipper frame 8, in a rotatable manner. The pivot arms 15, 15' are in each case connected to a spring strut 18, which in turn is mounted about an axis 20 on a driven eccentric element 21. Seen in the direction of the material flow F, a pair of detachment rollers 24 are provided behind the nipper 1. Indicated in diagrammatic form is a fixed comb 11, which is secured to the nipper frame 8 by way of securing means which are not shown, and into which the fibre tuft FB is drawn when its end E is conveyed in the direction of the nipping point K of the following detachment roller 24 by means of the movement of the end of the fibre fleece V.<br>
Inside the nipper 1 is a feed roller 27, which is rotatably mounted and which is connected by means of a drive unit, not shown in any greater detail, and which carries out a discontinuous rotational movement in order to convey the lap W being guided, section by<br><br>
19.12.2003 FRH/ps -2963A/E<br><br>
section. The feed roller 27 exhibits a shaft 28, by means of which it is rotatably mounted at both ends by means of bearings, not shown in greater detail, in bearing mounts of the nipper frame. The drive for the feed roller 27 can be provided by means of a known ratchet drive, which is controlled by the movement of the upper nipper plate 14. It is also possible, however, for the drive of the feed roller 27 to be provided independently of the movement of the upper nipper plate, whereby, for example, it can be effected by a curved disk such as is shown in GB-PS 933,946. It would also be conceivable for the curved disk used in this embodiment to be located directly on the circular comb shaft, as is shown, for example, in DE-PS 231 797. The drive for the feed roller 27 can be effected in the pre-run or return run of the nipper or even proportionately in the pre-run and return run.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an enlarged part section of the nipper 1 in the front area of the nip lip 30 of the lower nipper plate 12. Beneath the feed roller 27 the nipper plate 12 exhibits a feeding trough 26, which interacts with the feed roller in order to convey the wadding W in the direction of the front nip lip 30.<br>
Directly connected to the feeding trough 26 is a guide element 32, provided with a wedge-shaped cross-section, located on the lower nipper plate 12. The guide part in the present example exhibits two lateral guide elements 33, which project over the guide surface 35 of the guide part 32 in the vertical direction. The location of the lateral guide elements 33 can be seen in Fig. 4, which shows a part view X according to Fig. 2. In this Fig. 4 it is also shown that the lateral guide elements 33 are provided in each case with offset boreholes 36, into which in each case a screw 38 is introduced, in order to screw the guide part 32 to the lower nipper plate 12 or to secure it to this. This is only one embodiment of a method of securing the arrangement; others are also conceivable. In any event, the securing should be designed so as to be releasable, so that the guide part is replaceable by another guide part with different dimensions, for example.<br>
In Fig. 5 another embodiment of a guide part is shown, which is designed in the form of a guide plate 40, mounted so as to pivot about an axis 41. In order to secure the guide plate 40 in a desired position, it is provided with lateral threaded bolts 42, which in each case<br><br>
19.12.2003 FRH/ps -2963A/E<br>
project through slots 43 provided in lateral guides 45. By means of a nut 44 a clamping effect is achieved in each case between the guide plate 40 and the lateral guides 45, and, as a result of this, securing in a desired position is achieved. These lateral guides 45 (only one is shown in Fig. 5a) are, for example, secured by screws to the lower nipper plate 12 and can also be provided with units to grasp (not shown) in order to mount the pivot axis 41 of the guide plate 40,<br>
The function of the guide part 32 shown will now be explained in greater detail on the basis of Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.<br>
The wadding W, which is unrolled from a lap, not shown in greater detail, is introduced into the gap between the feed roller 27 and the feeding trough 26, By means of a discontinuous drive, not shown in greater detail, the wadding is conveyed in the direction of the detaching rollers 24. This conveying (also referred to as feeding) can be effected during the forwards movement of the nipper 1 in the direction of the detaching rollers 24 (pre-run feeding) or during the backwards movement (return-run feeding). A mixed feeding arrangement during the pre-run and return run of the nipper is also conceivable.<br>
In Fig. 2, the nipper 1 is in its frontmost position (front deadpoint position) in which it is open. The lap sheet leaving the feeding trough 26 is guided over a guide surface 35 of the guide part 32 on its underside, and deposited on the end of a fibre fleece V which is partially conveyed back before this, and is then transferred by the conveying movement of the fibre fleece to the nipping point K of the detachment rollers. During the movement sequence described, the wadding end (referred to in brief as "flbre tuft FB") passes into the area of the needles of a fixed comb 11. Due to the rotational movement of the detachment rollers 24 the fibres of the fibre tuft FB, which pass to the nipping point K, are drawn out of the fibre tuft and soldered to the end of the fibre fleece V. In this situation, what are referred to as "floating fibres" are in part also drawn along, which are not retained in the wadding due to the adherence friction.<br><br>

In order for as few uncontrolled floating fibres of this kind to be involved during the detachment process, it is necessary for the detachment distance AL (the distance interval between the nipping point K of the detachment rollers and the nipping point KM in the feeding trough 26) to be kept as small as possible. The result of this is that the distance interval E between the nipping point K and the nip lip 30 in its frontmost position should be kept as small as possible. This distance interval E is in general designated as the detaching setting. What is actually to be striven for are the spacing distance conditions which prevail with a conventional drafting arrangement. This allows for a controlled detachment process to take place, and unwanted short fibres to be separated out via the comb segment 7 of the circular comb 4.<br>
In order to achieve a higher degree of combing out, with the known solutions, for example, the detaching setting E is increased, as a result of which, with subsequent circular combing, a longer fibre tuft FB is present at the comb segment of the circular comb. The result of this is that more fibres are taken up by the comb segment 7, which, with the closed nipper 1, are no longer held or nipped by the lower nipping point KU of the nip lip 30 (see dotted line representation in Fig. 3). With the adjustment of the detaching setting E it is indeed possible for the desired combing-out height to be varied, but with the increase in the detaching setting the conditions during the detachment process or drafting process deteriorate. In order to avoid this, the use of the guide part 32 is recommended, whereby, with the detaching setting E remaining the same, the nipping fraction or the combing-out can be varied. In order to achieve consistent conditions, it must be guaranteed that the wadding W or the fibre tuft FB is located during the detachment process in a plane which extends from the deflection point UL of the feeding trough as far as the nipping point K of the detachment rollers; in other words, this plane delimits the position of the guide surface 35 of the guide part used.<br>
Fig. 3 shows what effects the use of the different guide parts 32a and 32b have.<br><br>
I<br>
19.12.2003<br>
FRH/ps -2963A/E	<br>
9<br>
With the installation of the guide part 32b the guide surface 35b is again located beneath, as a result of which the drafting between the deflection point UL and the lower nipping point KU of the nip lip 30 is shortened.<br>
As can be seen from the dotted position of the nip 1 in Fig. 3, in which the combing out takes place, the fibre tuft FB located in front of the comb segment 7 exhibits a length L2 over the nip lip 30. The length L2 is greater than the length L1 which pertains with the use of a guide part 32a, represented as a dotted line, since in this case the drafting between the deflection point UL and the lower nipping point KU of the nip lip 30 is longer.<br>
The nip geometry of the nip lip 30 is in this situation selected in such a way that the lower nipping point KU attained with the nip lip of the upper nipper plate lies approximately in the area of the lower delimitation of the nip lip. The upper nipping point KO lies in the area of a nip indentation, which follows on from the guide part. Other forms of the nip lip are also conceivable, however, which can be used in this case.<br>
It is therefore possible, depending on the requirement, for the noil fraction to be varied, without the optimised detachment conditions (or a minimum detaching setting) having to be altered.<br>
The lateral guide elements 33 of the guide part 32 additionally guarantee that the edges of the fibre tuft are guided cleanly during the detachment process, and their structure can be maintained.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 5, in order to change the noil fraction the guide plate 40 is adjusted accordingly in its angle setting. In this situation, the lateral guide of the fibre tuft FB in each case takes over the lateral guide 45, which can of course still be formed accordingly.<br><br><br><br><br>
