The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
MODULAR COLOR PALLET DISPLAY SYSTEM FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various embodiments of the invention pertain to cabinet display assemblies. More particularly, at least one embodiment of the invention relates a modular display system for paint colors and advertising.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
When designing a display unit, such as a display cabinet, for retail environments, it<br>
is often necessary to deploy the same display assembly in different retail locations<br>
and in various configurations. The need for varying cabinet configurations often<br>
requires  that several versions  of the  display assemblies be manufactured  and<br>
warehoused, increasing the cost of deployment.<br>
Additionally, installation of such different display assemblies requires identifying<br>
the particular display assembly to be used at each location, ordering the appropriate<br>
display assembly for each location, and training personnel to assembly each type of<br>
display assembly.<br>
In assembling such display cabinet assemblies, it is often necessary to position<br>
advertising panels along the upper regions of the display assemblies. Assembly and<br>
positioning such advertising panels often requires the manual lifting of heavy large<br>
components.<br>
Thus, the addition of advertising panels to the display assemblies adds complexity<br>
and time to the assembly of the overall display assemblies. US5439123 describes a<br>
display system with a plurality of upright dividers and shelf supporting fasteners<br>
within and DE-U-29803156 is an example of a unit that is flexible in the arrangement<br>
of its constituent parts as known in the art. It would therefore be desirable to reduce<br>
the manufacture cost and assembly time of display assemblies.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the present invention we provide a modular display assembly comprising a lower display section having: a plurality of interchangeable vertically positioned side walls, each side wall having a lower end and upper end, each side wall including means for removably fastening the lower end of the side wall to a floor base and having a notched region in the upper end, the space between each two adjacent side walls being for one or more display modules; a plurality of interchangeable back panels extending above the side walls; means for removably fastening the back panels to the plurality of side walls to enclose an end of the space between the side walls, the means for removably fastening being accessible from the other end of the space between the side walls; a plurality of interchangeable cabinets located in the spaces between each two side walls; means for removably fastening the interchangeable cabinets to a back panel between adjacent side walls; and an upper display section having: a frame structure supported by the vertically positioned side walls of the lower display section, the frame structure adapted to fit into the notched regions in the upper end of the vertically positioned side walls and be fastened to the vertically positioned side waits from the open space between the side walls, and display panels covering the frame structure.<br><br>
