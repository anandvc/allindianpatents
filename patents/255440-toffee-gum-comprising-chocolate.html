				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a toffee gum comprising chocolate according to claim 1.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
A group of conventional confectionery products include tablet-formed substances<br>
and/or chewable substances, which may be gradually dissolved or chewed and<br>
digested, such as candy, jelly, wine gum, liquorice, toffee, etc. This group of<br>
confectionery products generally benefits from a large variety of applicable textures,<br>
as indicated by the above-mentioned different products.<br>
A problem related to this group of confectionery products, such as e.g. liquorice,<br>
toffee, etc, is that these products are consumed relatively fast, so that the consumer<br>
repeatedly needs to-reload. This may lead to over-consuming, which may be<br>
undesirable due to a large intake of calories. In recent years, much attention has been<br>
paid to this problem. However, too large calorie-intake due to large consumption of<br>
confectionery products seems to be an increasing problem in some countries.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to toffee gum comprising a polymer system, and at<br>
least 1% by weight of chocolate,<br>
said polymer system constituting at least 10% by weight of said toffee gum,<br>
at least 70% by weight of said polymer system comprising polyvinyl acetate,<br>
said polyvinyl acetate having a glass transition temperature (Tg) in the range of 0 to<br>
60 °C, and said chocolate constituting at the most 90% by weight of said toffee gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said glass transition temperature (Tg) of said<br>
polyvinyl acetate is in the range of 18 to 55 °C, preferably in the range of 25 to 40<br>
°C.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said toffee gum comprises at least one flavor and<br>
at least one sweetener.<br>
According to the present invention, a new confectionery product has been obtained<br>
having texture properties emulating toffee but comprising a part, which is retained in<br>
the mouth during chewing. This confectionery product according to the invention is<br>
referred to as 'toffee gum'. The toffee gum according to the invention has toffee-like<br>
properties, but it is not completely swallowed during use. The toffee-like properties<br>
may be maintained for a relatively long time, e.g. 10 - 20 minutes, compared to<br>
chewing of a conventional toffee, which is usually swallowed during a shorter period<br>
of time.<br>
Basically, the part of the toffee gum being retained in the mouth is substantially<br>
formed by the polymer system and part5 of further ingredients being retained in the<br>
polymer system. Furthermore, according to the present invention, the polymer<br>
system, which comprises one or several polymers, is essential in providing the<br>
desired toffee-like properties for a prolonged time compared to conventional toffee,<br>
caramel, liquorice, wine gum, etc. According to the invention, it is required in<br>
obtaining these effects that the polymer system constitutes at least 10% by weight of<br>
the toffee gum product,<br>
Thus, the prolonged texture compared to conventional toffee is obtained by way of<br>
the polymer system, as the polymers are not ingested during chewing but rather<br>
forming part of a toffee-emulating polymer structure, which may be chewed in the<br>
same way as a chewing gum, The polymer system, may be compared in function to<br>
the gum base of a chewing gum, but with significant textural differences.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found, according to the invention, that polyvinyl acetate<br>
(PVAc) has exactly such properties essential for obtaining a polymer system<br>
providing the toffee gum product with toffee-like texture. Accordingly, it has been<br>
found that by adding polyvinyl acetate in significant amounts, it is possible to imitate<br>
the textural properties of toffee and obtain a toffee gum product having properties<br>
resembling or emulating toffee. The. significant amount of polyvinyl acetate .<br>
according to the invention is at least 70%, preferably more, by weight of the polymer<br>
system.<br>
A further, very advantageous feature of the invention is that the toffee-like texture is<br>
combined with an improved robustness to e.g. fats. Thus, chocolate fillings or<br>
coatings may be applied within the scope of fee invention. In other words, the nature<br>
of the polymers applied for the obtaining of a toffee gum is in particular useful as a<br>
robust polymer system when combined with chocolate. In contrast, e.g. chewable<br>
confectionery products based on smaller amounts of polyvinyl acetate and e.g.<br>
chewing gum comprising amounts of elastomers tend to disintegrate when combined<br>
with chocolate.<br>
According to the invention, sweetener, flavor and chocolate are added to the toffee<br>
gum as taste providing components, which are substantially swallowed during use of<br>
the toffee gum product. Dependent on the affinity for the polymers, .specific<br>
ingredients may be retained in the toffee gum for shorter or longer times during<br>
chewing of the product. Specific desired taste profiles may be obtained by adjusting<br>
types and amounts of flavors and sweeteners.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, a part of a toffee may be substituted<br>
by a polymer system. Thus the toffee texture may be provided by the polymer system<br>
and as it is not consumed during use, the texture may be maintained beyond a usual<br>
period of time of chewing a toffee, A correspondingly prolonged taste may be<br>
obtained due to the fact that some of the taste-providing substances are incorporated<br>
into the polymer system, both by initial mixing during manufacturing and/or by<br>
mixing occurring during the chewing-process performed by a consumer. Further<br>
ways of regulating the length of the; taste sensation include, incorporation of<br>
emulsifiers in the toffee gum and choosing the taste-providing substances in view of<br>
their affinity for the polymer system.<br>
Furthermore, according to the invention, the application of the significant amount of<br>
polyvinyl acetate in the polymer system makes it possible to obtain an improved<br>
release of ingredients such as flavors, sweeteners, and active ingredients.<br>
Herein, the polymer system is used as a term covering the polymers applied in the<br>
toffee gum confectionery product according to the invention. The polymer system<br>
may comprise one or more types of polymers. Other ingredients, such as fillers,<br>
softeners, etc., should not be regarded as being part of the polymer system.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a toffee gum may be a<br>
suitable substitute for conventional toffee or caramel. Toffee gum as a substitute for<br>
toffee, caramel, and further soft candies such as liquorice has the advantage of being<br>
a low-calorie substitute, which moreover provides prolonged taste sensation.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polymer system constitutes at least 12% by<br>
weight of said toffee gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polymer system constitutes in the range of<br>
15% to 95%, preferably 20% to 85%, more preferably 25% to 75%, and most<br>
preferably 30% to 65% by weight of said toffee gum.<br>
The quantity of polymer system in a toffee gum according to the invention may be<br>
regulated in order to obtain a certain desired balance between substance retained in<br>
the mouth when consuming the product and substance being swallowed by the user.<br>
The applied amount of polymer system furthermore affects the consistency of the<br>
product in combination with further ingredients such as softeners, sweeteners and<br>
flavors.<br>
According to the most preferred embodiment of the invention, the amount of<br>
polymer system is regulated within the range of 30 to 65 weight percent of the toffee<br>
gum. If the percentage of polymer system gets too low, it may cause difficulty with<br>
the coherence and shape of the product. On the other hand, if the percentage of<br>
polymer system is too high, it may cause the product to be less tasty and more tiring<br>
to consume and chew.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polymer system comprises at least one<br>
substantially non-elastomeric polymer in an amount in the range of 70% to 100%,<br>
preferably 80% to 100% by weight of said polymer system.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, it has been found that it is a key<br>
feature of the toffee gum that it comprises a polymer system of which the main part<br>
is composed of substantially non-elastomeric polymers.<br>
Polyvinyl acetates of molecular weight in the range of 1000 to 100000 g/mol and a<br>
glass transition temperature in the range of 18 to 50 °C may show very desirable<br>
non-elastomeric properties and are according to the invention very important for<br>
obtaining the toffee-like consistency of the toffee gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the polymer system is substantially formed by<br>
polyvinyl acetate(s) alone.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the toffee gum is substantially<br>
free of natural and synthetic elastomers, which are typically applied within the art of<br>
manufacturing chewing gum.<br>
The toffee texture of the polymer-based confectionery product according to the<br>
invention is obtained through a substantial amount of polyvinyl acetate and avoiding<br>
use of substantial amounts of high-molecular weight polymers, in particular<br>
elastomers.<br>
Basically, a polymer system being comprised solely of polyvinyl acetate(s) is<br>
preferred in the sense that e.g. natural resins tend to counteract the - in this context -<br>
desired toffee-like properties.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, conventional elastomers<br>
should be avoided in order to avoid the typical chewing gum-like elastomeric<br>
properties, and according to a most preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
polymers of the product consist of polyvinyl acetate.<br>
Evidently, insignificant amounts of other polymers may be acceptable within the<br>
scope of the invention without compromising the principles of the invention, namely<br>
that the polyvinyl acetates alone provide a toffee-like texture.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polyvinyl acetate has a molecular weight<br>
(Mw) in the range of 1000 to 250000 g/mol, preferably in the range of 2000 to<br>
100000 g/mol, and most preferably in the range of 15000 to 60000 g/mol.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the polymer system comprises at least one low-<br>
molecular weight polyvinyl acetate having a molecular weight (Mw) of about 2000<br>
to 40000 g/mol, and<br>
at least one high-molecular weight PVAc having a molecular weight (Mw) of 40001<br>
to 200000 g/mol.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the polymer system comprises at least one low-<br>
molecular weight (Mw) polyvinyl acetate having a molecular weight of about 9000<br>
to 30000 g/mol, preferably about 13000 to 21000 g/mol.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the toffee gum comprises at least one low-<br>
molecular weight polyvinyl acetate having a molecular weight (Mw) of about 2000<br>
to 40000 g/mol in an amount of at least 70%, preferably at least 90% by weight of<br>
the polymer system.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the toffee gum comprises at least one high-<br>
molecular weight polyvinyl acetate having a molecular weight (Mw) of 40000 to<br>
100000 in an amount from about 0.5 to 10 % by weight of the polymer system.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, at least 70%, preferably at least 90%, and most<br>
preferably about 100% by weight of said polymer system is polyvinyl acetate having<br>
a glass transition temperature (Tg) in the range of 0 to 60 °C, preferably 10 to 50 °C,<br>
and most preferably 20 to 40°C.<br>
The most preferred Tg of the final toffee gum may, according to an embodiment of<br>
the invention, lie within the range of 20 to 40 °C,<br>
According to the invention, a toffee-like texture of the toffee gum confectionery<br>
product may be obtained when the polymer system is comprised mostly or<br>
completely of polyvinyl acetate having a glass transition temperature within the<br>
range of 20 to 40°C.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the preferred polyvinyl acetate may be<br>
referred to as non-elastomeric and may also show resinous characteristics.<br>
Such properties of the main part of the polymers arc essential in order to obtain the<br>
desired consistency. Application of elastomers (elastomeric polymers) in too large<br>
amounts have been found to spoil the desired consistency - and make the product<br>
texture more chewing gum-like, which is far from the desired toffee-like consistency.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, at the most 30%, preferably at the most 10% by<br>
weight of said polymer system is polyvinyl acetate having molecular weight (Mw) in<br>
the range of 40001 - 200000 g/mol.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polymer system comprises less than 4% by<br>
weight of polymers having a molecular weight (Mw) from about 50000 to 99999<br>
g/mol.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polymer system comprises less than 2% by<br>
weight of polymers having a molecular weight (Mw) from about 100000 to 199999<br>
g/mol.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polymer system comprises less than 1% by<br>
weight of polymers having a molecular weight (Mw) from about 200000 to 499999<br>
g/mol.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polymer system comprises less than 0.5% by<br>
weigh: of polymers having a molecular weight (Mw) from about 500000 to<br>
10000000 g/mol.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, high-molecular weight polymers, such<br>
as conventional elastomers or high-molecular weight polyvinyl acetate, should be<br>
kept low in concentration to obtain the desired texture.<br>
Only a small amount of elastomeric polymers can be applied, without spoiling the<br>
desired texture of the toffee gum. They may he used for adjusting the texture, and<br>
may contribute with more robustness, but preferably elastomers are avoided.<br>
It is crucial for obtaining the desired toffee texture that the amount of elastomeric<br>
polymer is kept low. Otherwise, the toffee gum is in danger of acquiring more<br>
chewing gum-like textural properties, which are undesired in the toffee gum of the<br>
invention.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polymer system is substantially free of<br>
elastomers.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the toffee gum confectioner}' product<br>
may be provided with the desired toffee-like texture on the basis of a polymer<br>
system, in which all the polymers comprised are substantially non-elastomeric<br>
polymers, mainly polyvinyl acetate, and none of them are elastomers.<br>

di-glycerides. It has been found that these softeners are mild in the sense that they are<br>
not inclined to affect the texture of the toffee gum to an undesirable high extent.<br>
Thus, mono- or diglycerides are ideal as softeners for adjusting and fine-tuning of the<br>
toffee-like texture of the toffee gum confectionery product.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said toffee .gum comprises at least one syrup of a<br>
polyol in an amount of 1% to 25%, preferably 5% to 20% by weight of said toffee<br>
gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the desired toffee-like texture may be obtained,<br>
when a considerable amount of polyol syrup is added to the toffee gum.<br>
A quite large amount of polyol syrup in the final toffee gum may contribute to<br>
provide the toffee gum with very desirable textural properties according to the<br>
invention.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, an advantageous syrup of a polyol, for<br>
application in the toffee gum, is maltitol syrap. According to an embodiment of the<br>
invention, maltitol syrup is a preferred choice as the polyol syrup for regulating the<br>
texture of the toffee gum and for softening the polyvinyl acetate.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, a polyol syrup such as maltitol syrup<br>
may advantageously be applied in the toffee gum as a mildly softening compound,<br>
which is also conferring a nice sweet taste to the product.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, application of a polyol syrup such as<br>
maltitol syrup in an amount hi the range of 5 to 25 weight percent of the product may<br>
contribute significantly in obtaining the desired toffee-like consistency of the toffee<br>
gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polymer system comprises plasticizer(s).<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, plasticizers are applied for the purpose<br>
of obtaining a soft chew feel of the polyvinyl acetate based polymer system. It is<br>
noted that the desired plasticization depends heavily on the other ingredients applied<br>
in the product. As an example, some aggressive flavors, such as fruit flavors and<br>
acids, lend to soften the polymer system significantly compared to e.g. mint oil-based<br>
flavors..<br>
Particularly useful plasticizers according to the present invention are triacetin,<br>
acetylated mono-and di-and triglycerides of short chain fatty acids, acetylated mono-<br>
and di-and triglycerides of medium-chain fatty acids, acetylated monoglycerides of<br>
long-chain fatty acids, methyl ester of rosin, low-molecular weight PVAc.<br>
A preferred plasticizer will in a preferred embodiment have a hydrophilicity<br>
corresponding to the applied PVAc.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the polymer system comprises less<br>
than 30% by weight of plasticizers, preferably less than 10%, more preferably less<br>
than 8%, and most preferably less than 4% by weight of plasticizers.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the; invention, a relatively low amount of<br>
plasticizers should be applied in order to obtain the desired textural properties, i.e.<br>
the toffee-like chew feel. Moreover, off-notes may be present if too much plasticizer<br>
is present, especially when applying triacelin and glycerides. Finally, plasticizers<br>
such as triacetin and acetylated glycerides are expensive and the amount should be<br>
kept low.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the toffee gum comprises less than 6%,<br>
preferably less than 4% by weight of filler, preferably less than 1% by weight.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the toffee gum is substantially free of filler.<br>
Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, fillers such as e.g. talc,<br>
should be avoided, as the desired toffee-like texture may be counteracted by the<br>
influencing of the filler on the mainly PVAc-based polymer system of the toffee<br>
gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said toffee gum comprises at said least one flavor<br>
in an amount of about 0.001% to 30% by weight, and said at least one sweetener in<br>
an amount of about 5% to 80% by weight.<br>
Flavors, sweeteners and further ingredients may be selected from those mentioned in<br>
the detailed description of the present invention.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said flavor is a caramel flavor comprising an<br>
amount in the range of 1% to 30% by weight of said toffee gum substance.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said at least one flavor is substantially oil-based<br>
and/or substantially hydrophilic flavors.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, substantially oil-based flavors are<br>
preferred as such flavors tend 'to match the polymer system, which according to the<br>
invention may be regarded hydrophilic.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, substantially hydrophilic flavors<br>
have proved advantageous e.g. with respect to prolongation of release.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said at least one sweetener comprises sugar.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said sugar is selected from the group consisting<br>
of mono-, di-, or polysaccharides and any combination thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, siaid sugar is selected from the group consisting<br>
of sucrose, dextrose, maltose, dextrins, trehalose, tagatose, dried invert sugar,<br>
fructose, levulose, galactose, corn syrup solids, polydextrosell, polydextrose ultra,<br>
inuline, or any combination thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said at least one sweetener is an artificial<br>
sweetener.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, artificial sweeteners may<br>
advantageously be applied in the toffee-gum-like confectionery product.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention., said artificial sweetener is selected from the<br>
group consisting of sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, xylitol, erythritol, lactitol, isomalt,<br>
derivatives of isomalt, or any combination therecf.<br>
Accordingly, any other hydrogenated derivates of mono-, di-, or polysaccharides<br>
may be applied in the toffee gum of the invention. Furthermore, it is within the scope<br>
of the invention to apply sugar-sweeteners and artificial sweeteners in the same<br>
toffee gum composition.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said artificial sweetener is a high-intensity<br>
artificial sweetener selected from the group consisting of aspartame, salts of<br>
acesulfame, alitame, neotame, twinsweet, saccharin and its salts, cyclamic acid and<br>
its salts, glycyrrhizin, dihydrochalcones, thaLimatin, monellin, stevioside, sucralose,<br>
or any combination thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said toffee gum further comprises active<br>
ingredients.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, applicable active ingredients may be<br>
selected among those listed in the detailed description,<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said toffee gum forms a tablet comprising a<br>
chewable polymer system,<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said toffee gum is formed in shapes such as<br>
cores, ellipsoid, balls, cylinders, squares, rectangular, hexagonal, strips, p:araboloid,<br>
donut formed, ring formed, teddy bear formed and/or multi-modular.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said toffee gum weighs from about V* gram to<br>
about 10 grams.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said toffee gum weighs from about Yi gram to<br>
about 5 grams.<br>
In. an embodiment of the invention, said toffee gum is provided with an outer<br>
coating.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said coating is selected from the group consisting<br>
of hard coating, soft coating and edible film-coating.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said toffee gum is center-filled.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said toffee gum. is compressed.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, it may be advantageous to apply<br>
compression techniques in the manufacture of the toffee gum. E.g. when<br>
incorporating ingredients being vulnerable to elevated temperatures or mixing<br>
processes, it may be preferable to apply compression in the preparation of the toffee<br>
gum of the present invention.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, ths compression of toffee gum refers<br>
to compression of the toffee gum substance or toffee gum core and excludes the<br>
chocolate module of the toffee gum.<br>
The invention further relates to a method of manufacturing a toffee gum according to<br>
any of the claims 1 - 80, whereby the product is manufactured by a batch process.<br>
A well-known batch manufacturing method is a two-step process according to which<br>
the polymer system (within the terms of chewing gum referred to as the gum base) is<br>
mixed in a first step on the basis of substantially hydrophobic components and where<br>
upon the further hydrophilic components such as sweeteners etc. are mixed together<br>
with the polymer system.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a method of manufacturing a toffee gum<br>
according to any of the claims 1 - 80, whereby the product is manufactured by an<br>
extruder process.<br>
Manufacturing of the confectionery product and/or the polymer system of the<br>
product may advantageously be performed by extruding. The process is very<br>
attractive and advantageous in relation to the present invention due to the fact that<br>
the polymer system (the gum base equivalent) comprises very few components, e.g.<br>
preferably three components: a LMw PVAc, a HMw PVAc, and a plasticizer, e.g.<br>
triacetin.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of coating a toffee gum according to any of<br>
the claims 1 - 80 by chocolate comprising the steps of applying chocolate in liquid<br>
form to the surface of a toffee gum core and subjecting the chocolate coated toffee<br>
gum to a temperature, which causes the liquid chocolate to harden.<br>

Detailed description<br>
According to the present invention, a confectionery product has been provided,<br>
which ha.s striking resemblance with, toffee-products, but which is based on a<br>
polymer system mainly composed of polyvinyl acetate. The polymer system is mixed<br>
with further ingredients, at least comprising sweetener and flavor, and the mixture<br>
forms a confectionery substance, whiich is herein referred to as a toffee gum<br>
substance:.<br>
Surprisingly, the obtained toffee gum substance has considerable resistance towards<br>
fats and hence a great stability when combined with chocolate. Conversely, the<br>
resistance of the toffee gum substance towards moisture is limited, and it has actually<br>
been discovered that a coating of chocolate provides protection and prolonged shelf-<br>
life to the toffee gum substance.<br>
Generally, according to the present invention, the provided toffee gum confectionery<br>
product typically comprises a polymer system and additional ingredients comprising<br>
flavoring agents, sweetening agents, texture-modifying agents, further optional<br>
ingredients and chocolate. Most part of the additional ingredients may typically be<br>
water-soluble. However, lipo-soluble ingredients may be fully applicable, such as for<br>
example flavoring oils. The chocolate may preferably form one or more modules.<br>
The chocolate modules are according to the invention situated in one or more regions<br>
in the toffee gum core or as a coating s urrounding the toffee gum core.<br>
The polymer system may include one or more polymers and may be mixed with a<br>
softening agent. The polymers are retained in the mouth and not swallowed during<br>
use, whiich has the advantageous effect of prolonging the toffee-like experience<br>
compared to conventional toffee products, which are normally completely<br>
swallowed.<br>
Softening agents may be mixed into the polymers before addition of :Eurther<br>
ingredients, or mixed into the toffee gum composition, at any time during the mixing<br>
procedure. In an embodiment of the invention, a part of the softening agents are<br>
added early in the process, e.g. added to the polymers alone, and further parts of the<br>
softening agents are added later on in the mixing process of the toffee gum.<br>
Different kinds of softening agents may he useful for adjusting the texture of a<br>
specific polymer system. The exact composition of the polymer system and specific<br>
choice of additional ingredients, including softening, flavoring and sweetening<br>
agents, define the release properties of the toffee gum. The release rate of flavor and<br>
sweetener may be adjusted to be higher or lcwer during different phases of a<br>
chewing- and consuming-period of the toffee gum.<br>
By addition of flavoring and sweetening agents into the toffee gum, any desired taste<br>
may be obtained, such as for example liquorice, chocolate, toffee, fruit, etc.<br>
A way of characterizing the texture of the toffee gum is to measure the rheological<br>
properties, which involves the storage modulus G' and the loss modulus G" and the<br>
relation between the two at different frequencies. The term storage modulus G' may<br>
also be regarded as the elastic modulus, while the term loss modulus G" may be<br>
regarded as the viscous modulus. The ratio of G" to G', that is G"/G', is a measure of<br>
the relative importance of the viscous to elastic contributions for a material at a given<br>
frequency, and may be evaluated at a given oscillation torque and a given<br>
temperature.<br>
The desired texture properties may be obtained by a proper combination of PVAc<br>
and softeners.<br>
In the following, the toffee gum composition is described in further details, and<br>
examples are given of applicable' components in the polymer system and of the<br>
additional ingredients in toffee gum products according to the invention.<br>
In general, a toffee gum product composition according to the present invention<br>
typically comprises a water-soluble bulk portion, flavoring agents, and a water-<br>
insoluble chewable portion mainly composed of the polymer system. The water-<br>
soluble portion dissipates with a portion of the flavoring agent over a period of time<br>
during chewing, while the polymer system portion is retained io the mouth<br>
throughout the chew.<br>
The addition of chocolate may be varied with regard to amount and arrangement in<br>
or around the toffee gum substance. See figures 1 to 7.<br>
The polymer system provides the masticatory substance of the confectionery product<br>
according to the invention and greatly impart the chew characteristics of the final<br>
toffee gum product. Furthermore, the polymer system affects the release profile of<br>
flavors, and sweeteners and plays a significant role in the final product with respect<br>
to both texture and taste, Some of the applied flavoring agents may ha^ve affinity for<br>
the polymer system and may be retained by the polymer system and hence be<br>
released, over a prolonged time of chewing the toffee gum. Other flavoring agents<br>
may be readily released, and some may be released faster when ernulsifiers are<br>
applied, Furthermore, ernulsifiers may effect an improved stability towards humidity<br>
in the climate, as the ernulsifiers may facilitate a lower uptake of water and thus a<br>
reduced, tendency of the toffee gum to flow.<br>
The we.ter-insoluble portion of the toffee gum confectionery product contains the<br>
polymer system and typically a small amount of further ingredients such as<br>
plasticizers, waxes, softeners, fillers, colorants and antioxidants.<br>
Preferably, the polymer system .may comprise about 15% to about 95% by weight of<br>
the toffee gum confectionery product, more typically in the range of about 30% to<br>
about 65% by weight of the toffee gum.<br>
The composition of the polymer system may vary depending cm the particular<br>
product to be prepared and on the desired masticatory and other sensory<br>
characteristics of the final product. However, according to the invention, it has been<br>
found that polyvinyl acetate has properties, which are essential in obtaining a toffee-<br>
like texture of the confectionery product, and according to the invention polyvinyl<br>
acetate should always constitute the main part of the applied polymer system.<br>
The polymer system may comprise polyvinyl acetate in an amount of 70% to 100%<br>
by weight of the polymer system. The polymer system may preferably be composed<br>
mostly of relatively low-molecular weight polyvinyl acetate, which, may sometimes<br>
be referred to as resinous polymers. Elastomers and high-molecular Aveight polyvinyl<br>
acetate can only be applied to a very limited degree without compromising the<br>
desired toffee-like texture.<br>
Softening agents may be incorporated into the polymer system to modify the texture.<br>
Softening agents may be added in an amount of 0% to 30% by weight in relation to<br>
the polymer system. Mild softening ingredients; of the toffee gum such as polyol<br>
syrup, e.g. maltitol syrup, may within a most suitable range be added to the toffee<br>
gum in an amount of about 0% to 25% by weight of the final toffee gum substance.<br>
The polymer system may further be mixed with fillers, waxes and fats,, These<br>
components are generally not contributing to the desired toffee-like texture<br>
properties, but fat in the form of a chocolate component is because of its taste a<br>
preferred ingredient in the toffee gum of the present invention. However, it should be<br>
noted that although it is possible to mix chocolate with the further toffee gum<br>
ingredients, chocolate is typically not mixed into the toffee gum composition like the<br>
rest of the ingredients in the toffee gum substance. Preferably, chocolate is situated in<br>
one or more modules in coherence with the toffee gum substance such as inner<br>
fillings or outer coatings.<br>
Various arrangements of chocolate and toffee gum substance are applicable<br>
according to the invention. Some examples are illustrated in figures 1 to 7, wherein<br>
modules of chocolate and toffee gum substance are combined in different ways.<br>
In fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C, toffee gums 10,11, and 12 are illustrated in different shapes<br>
but all with one single inner filling of chocolate 103, 113, and 123. Toffee gum<br>
substances 102, 112, and 122 are surrounding the inner fillings of chocolate and<br>
forming the outer shape and surface of each toffee gum piece. Although not<br>
illustrated, a coating may be provided unto the toffee gum substance surface.<br>
Furthermore, the arrangement of toffee gum substance and chocolate may be reverse,<br>
whereby chocolate forms the outer material, and the inner filling is toffee gum<br>
substance.<br>
In fig. 2A, 2B, and 2C, toffee gums 20, 21, and 22 are illustrated in different shapes<br>
and with several regions of inner filling of chocolate 203, 213, and 223. Toffee gum<br>
substances 202, 212, and 222 are surrounding the inner fillings of chocolate and<br>
forming the outer shape and surface of each toffee gum piece. Although not<br>
illustrated, a coating may be provided unto the toffee gum substance surface.<br>
Furthermore, the arrangement of toffee gum substance and chocolate may be reverse,<br>
whereby chocolate forms the outer material, and the inner fillings are formed from<br>
toffee gum substance.<br>
In fig. 3A, 3B, and 3C, toffee gums 30, 31, and 32 are illustrated in different shapes<br>
and with outer coatings of chocolate 303, 313, and 323. Toffee gum substances 302,<br>
312, and 322 are forming cores of toffee gum substance, which are surrounded and<br>
covered by the coatings of chocolate. Furthermore, in fig. 3C, the toffee gum 32 is<br>
provided with inner fillings of chocolate 324.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a layered toffee gum piece 40, in which a layer of toffee gum<br>
substance 402 is combined with a layer of chocolate 403. The layers may be formed<br>
and combined by lamination or by compression. Although only two layers are, shown<br>
in fig. 4, several layers of toffee gum substance and chocolate may be combined.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a toffee gum piece 50 comprising a main part of chocolate 503 and a<br>
top part of toffee gum substance 502. The reverse may likewise be the case, whereby<br>
a main part of toffee gum substance may be provided with a top part of chocolate.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a ring-formed toffee gum piece 60 formed of an inner ring 601, an<br>
intermediate ring 602, and an. outer ring 603. The inner and outer rings may be<br>
formed from toffee gum substance, and the intermediate ring from chocolate, or<br>
reverse. Likewise, the toffee gum piece may be provided with further rings of<br>
chocolate or toffee gum substance. The intermediate ring 602, which may be made of<br>
chocolate, may be continuous through the toi'fee gum piece and visible on the surface<br>
of the toffee gum piece, or alternatively the chocolate intermediate ring 602 may be<br>
hidden inside a mass of toffee gum substance making it invisible without breaking<br>
the toffee gum piece.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates toffee gum pieces 70 as small pieces with a filling. The toffee gum<br>
pieces 70 may be formed of toffee gum substance with a filling or coating of<br>
chocolate. According to the invention, toffee gum may be provided as small pieces<br>
70 intended for being consumed at once, instead of one single larger toffee guru<br>
piece.<br>
Typically, the polymer system comprises 70% to 100% by weight of polyvinyl<br>
acetate having a glass transition temperature (Tg) in the range of 0 to 60 °C. The<br>
remainder 0% to 30% of the polymer system may be comprised of further synthetic<br>
resins, elastomers or high-molecular weight polyvinyl acetates. Preferably, the<br>
amount of elastomers does not exceed 10% by weight of the polymer system.<br>
As referred to herein, the glass transition temperature (Tg) may be determined for<br>
example by DSC (DSC: differential scanning calorimetry). The DSC may generally<br>
be applied for determining and studying of the thermal transitions of a polymer and<br>
specifically, the technique may be applied for the determination of a second order<br>
transition of a material. The transition at Tg is regarded as such a second order<br>
transition, i.e. a thermal transition that involves a change in heat capacity, but does<br>
not have a latent heat. Hence, DSC may be applied for studying Tg.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the polyvinyl acetate, which<br>
comprises 70% to 100% by weight of the polymer system may have relatively low<br>
molecular weight (Mw). The low-molecular weight polyvinyl acetates, which<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention may be characterized as resinous, resin-<br>
like and non-elastomeric, may preferably have molecular weights (Mw) within the<br>
range of 1000 to 250000 g/mol, preferably 2000 to 200000 g/mol, and more<br>
preferably 4000 to 100000 g/mol. The polyvinyl acetate polymers may affect the<br>
firmness of the polymer system and toffee gum.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, as used herein with regard to polymers, the term<br>
"molecular weight" means weight average molecular weight (Mw) in g/mol.<br>
Polyvinyl acetates of different molecular weights and the glass transition<br>
temperatures may be combined in the polymer system, and by their individual<br>
properties, the firmness, softness and further textural properties of the toffee gum<br>
may be varied.<br>
High-molecular weight polyvinyl acetates of molecular weight (Mw) in the range of<br>
25000 to 300000 g/mol, more commonly 30000 to 80000 g/mol may comprise up to<br>
30%, preferably not more than 20%, and most preferably below 10% by weight of<br>
the polymer system. The higher the molecular weight, the less amount may be<br>
applied without spoiling the desired toffee-like properties of the toffee gum product<br>
according to the invention.<br>
In accordance with the general principles in manufacturing a toffee gum product<br>
within the scope of the invention, variations of different suitable ingredients are<br>
listed and explained below.<br>
Chocolate may be applied in an amount in the range of 1% to 90% by weight of the<br>
final toffee gum product according to the invention. The applicable chocolate types<br>
include dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate, chocolate couverture,<br>
unsweetened chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semisweet chocolate, sweet chocolate,<br>
and compound chocolate. Both sugar-containing and sugar-free chocolate types may<br>
be applied. The compound chocolate refers to chocolate in which at least some of the<br>
cocoa butter is replaced by vegetable fat or oil substitutes. In general, any chocolate<br>
type and chocolate substitute known in the art may be applied according to the<br>
present invention. However, dependent on the desired taste and texture of the final<br>
product and dependent on the arrangement of the chocolate with respect to the toffee<br>
gum substance, such parameters as viscosity, hardening temperature, and taste of the<br>
chocolate should be taken into consideration. Specific examples of chocolate, which<br>
may be applicable, may e.g. be chocolate types such as those disclosed in<br>
EP0727146, US2003082291, WO00/02460, WO00/40101, WO01/56397,<br>
WO2005/016021, US4895732, US5279846, US6143345, hereby incorporated by<br>
reference, and in "The Materials Science of Chocolate" (Dec. 2000), by Peter Fryer<br>
and Kerstin Pinschower, MRS Bulletin. Further chocolate compositions for<br>
application in the present invention may for example be found in the books<br>
"Industrial Chocolate Manufacture and Use" (1999), Third edition, by S. T. Beckett,<br>
Blackwell Publishing Ltd, and "The Science of Chocolate" (2000), by S. T. Beckett,<br>
Royal Society of Chemistry, and "Chocolate, Cocoa &amp; Confectionery" (1995), Third<br>
edition, by Bernard W. Minifie, Kluv/er Academic Publishers, hereby incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
The chocolate taste and texture may e.g. be regulated by the degree of conching and<br>
by the contents of chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, sweetener, and e.g. vanilla, lecithin<br>
and milk solids. Likewise, the type and roasting of cocoa beans have effect on the<br>
chocolate quality. Different chocolate qualities may be applied as layers, coating, and<br>
filling of the toffee gum, respectively. For example, the viscosity of the chocolate<br>
should be relatively low, when applied as a layer., as e.g. showed in figure 4, and the<br>
chocolate viscosity may be high as well as low, when it is applied as an inner filling,<br>
as e.g. shown in figures 1 to 2. Correspondingly, the chocolate viscosity is important,<br>
when it is applied as a coating, as e.g. shown in figure 3. Here, a high viscosity, e.g.<br>
obtained by heating, is required during the coating procedure, and a hardening of the<br>
chocolate is required afterwards, e.g. obtained by cooling or by a dedicated chocolate<br>
quality.<br>
Colorants, whiteners and antioxidants; are optional ingredients, which may be mixed<br>
with the polymer system and may comprise an amount of up to about 5% by weight<br>
of the polymer system. The antioxidants may e.g. be chosen among butylated<br>
hydroxytoluene (BHT), butyl hydroxyanisol (BHA), propylgallate and tocopherols,<br>
and preservatives. The coloring agents and whiteners may for example comprise<br>
FD&amp;C-type dyes and lakes," fruit or vegetable extracts, titanium dioxide, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention., the toffee gum may comprise one or more<br>
softening agents in an amount of about 0 to about 18% by weight of the toffee gum,<br>
more typically about 0 to about 12% by weight of the toffee gum.<br>
The softeners as well as emulsifiers may according to an embodiment of the<br>
invention be added both during mixing of die polymer system and later during<br>
mixing of the final toffee gum.<br>
The softening ingredient may soften the polymer system and toffee gum formulation<br>
and may contribute to encompass ingredients such as waxes, fats, oils, emulsifiers,<br>
surfactants and solubilisers, which may optionally be added.<br>
The softening agents e.g. sucrose esters may include those disclosed in WO<br>
00/25598, which is incorporated herein by reference. Softening agents may further<br>
include tallow, hydrogenated tallow, hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated<br>
vegetable oils, cocoa butter, degreased cocoa powder, glycerol monostearate,<br>
glyceryl triacetate, lecithin, mono-, di- and triglycerides, acetylated monoglycerides,<br>
fatty acids (e.g. stearic, palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids) and combinations thereof.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the preferred softener applied in the<br>
toffee gum may be triacetin.<br>
Addition of one or more emulsifiers, which are also supplying softness to the<br>
product, may furthermore contribute to providing the product with water-binding<br>
properties and a pleasant smooth surface, and to reduce potential adhesive properties<br>
of the product. In an embodiment of the invention, the emulsifiers may comprise 0 to<br>
18% by weight, preferably 0 to 12% by weight of the polymer system. Examples of<br>
emulsifiers may include mono- and diglycerides of edible fatty acids, lactic acid<br>
esters and acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of edible fatty acids,<br>
acetylated mono and diglycerides, sugar esters of edible fatty acids, Na-, K-, Mg- and<br>
Ca-stearates, lecithin, hydroxylated lecithin and the like.<br>
In case of the presence of biologically or pharmaceutically active ingredients as<br>
defined below, certain specific emulsifiers and/or solubilisers may be added in the<br>
toffee gum formulation in order to disperse and release these ingredients.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the glass transition<br>
ternperalure(s) of the polymer system may be in the range of 0 to 50 °C, preferably<br>
within the range of 20 to 40 °C. The preferred Tg may be experienced by the polymer<br>
system alone or combined with one or more softeners, such as those mentioned<br>
above.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, waxes and fats may be used for adjustment of<br>
consistency and for softening of the toffee gum confectionery product. In connection<br>
with the present invention, examples of waxes and fats include for instance rice bran<br>
wax, polyethylene wax, petroleum wax (refined paraffin and microcrystalline wax),<br>
paraffin,, beeswax, carnauba wax, candelilla wax, cocoa butter, degreased cocoa<br>
powder and any suitable oil or fat, as e.g. completely or partially hydrogenated<br>
vegetable oils or completely or partially hydro genated animal fats.<br>
Above-mentioned fats are not preferred in large amounts in the toffee gum of the<br>
present invention, as they have a tendency to counteract the desired toffee-like<br>
texture of the product. However, chocolate components such as cocoa butter and<br>
cocoa powder are preferred ingredients according to the present invention, although<br>
they are usually not mixed into the toffee gum composition in large amounts.<br>
If waxes and/or fats are mixed into the toffee gum, the amount should be at the most<br>
30% "by weight in relation to the polymer system. Keeping the amount of fat low in<br>
the toffee gum composition may have the advantageous effect that the toffee gum<br>
may be more robust for an inner filling of fatty ingredients such as chocolate and for<br>
a soft coating, e.g. a coating with chocolate.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the toffee gum may comprise filler in a small<br>
amount of about 0% to 10%, preferably 0°/o to 5% by weight of the toffee gum.<br>
However, within the range, the result of increasing the amount of filler may be that<br>
