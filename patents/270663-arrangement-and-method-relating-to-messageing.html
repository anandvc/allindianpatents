				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for handling<br>
control signalling messageing in a distributed system<br>
comprising a number of sending nodes and a number of<br>
receiving nodes and which implements a control signalling<br>
communication protocol.<br>
The invention also relates to a node in a distributed<br>
communication system adapted to at least send control<br>
signalling messages with a given syntax to other nodes and<br>
implementing a control signalling protocol.<br>
Furthermore the invention relates to a method for sending a<br>
control plane signalling current message from a first,<br>
sending, node to a second node in a distributed<br>
communication system implementing a control plane signalling<br>
communication protocol. Further yet the invention relates to<br>
a method of receiving a control plane signalling current<br>
message from a first sending node, in a second receiving<br>
node in a low transport layer of an implemented control<br>
plane signalling protocol, in a distributed communication<br>
system.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
Distributed communication systems of different types rely on<br>
both data and control signalling between the subsystem nodes<br>
of a system. A node is here taken to mean an arbitrary node<br>
or a base station, a mobile station, a client/server,<br>
different boards in a base station or more generally a<br>
sender and a receiver. Depending on the particular system<br>
requirements and the design of the system, the control plane<br>
signalling may actually constitute a performance bottleneck.<br><br>
In the art is known to prevent or reduce the negative<br>
effects, to the largest possible extent, of such bottlenecks<br>
through improving the hardware, for example through using<br>
higher bus-speeds or alternative communication channels, for<br>
example replacing a serial interface by a shared memory<br>
interface or by designing more optimized protocols for<br>
control signalling.<br>
It is however not always possible or not even desirable for<br>
different reasons, for example for keeping down the costs or<br>
in order not increase the complexity etc., to provide any<br>
hardware modifications. The only way to handle increasing<br>
requirements in control plane signalling or to avoid the<br>
occurence of bottlenecks, is then to optimize or modify the<br>
communication protocol or to perform general software<br>
optimization, which normally is not sufficient. However,<br>
many distributed communication systems are very complex,<br>
such as for example radio base stations, server/client<br>
database systems etc. and it can be very difficult and<br>
involve high costs to optimize the communication protocol<br>
and it may also affect many other system components which<br>
affects the system design as a whole. It is also highly<br>
important that the control plane signalling is stable and<br>
well tested in order to assure a reliable and stable<br>
performance of the system. Actually, modification of the<br>
design of a control plane communication protocol might<br>
involve redesign of a major part of the communication system<br>
and, as referred to above, potentially affect many system<br>
components since the control plane communication protocols<br>
normally are common for many components included in the<br>
system.<br>
In today known systems a lot of redundant or highly<br>
redundant information is normally sent, which means that the<br><br>
available control plane signalling bandwidth is not<br>
efficiently exploited and that bottlenecks easily result.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
What is needed is therefore an arrangement as initially<br>
referred to through which bottlenecks to a large extent can<br>
be avoided or through which the occurence of bottlenecks can<br>
be reduced considerably a compared to in hitherto known<br>
systems.<br>
An arrangement is also needed through which the control<br>
plane signalling can be optimized. Further an arrangement is<br>
needed through which the usage of the bandwidth available<br>
for control plane signalling can be optimized. Most<br>
particualarly an arrangement is needed through which the<br>
above can be achieved without affecting or requiring<br>
modification of used protocols over even the creation of new<br>
signalling protocols. Most particularly an arrangement is<br>
needed through which control plane signalling can be<br>
optimized and bandwidth saved in an efficient manner and<br>
bottlenecks to a high extent can be avoided without<br>
affecting involved components. Even more particularly an<br>
arrangement as referred to above is needed which does not<br>
require any hardware modifications or particularly no<br>
substantial hardware modifications. Still further an<br>
arrangement through which one or more of the above mentioned<br>
objects can be achieved is needed which can be applied to<br>
even very complex systems. Still further an arrangement is<br>
needed which is easy to install and implement, which is<br>
flexible and which is non- expensive.<br>
Most particularly an arrangement as referred to above is<br>
needed which does not require any redesign of the system or<br><br>
at least not of any considerable part of the system. Most<br>
particularly an arrangement is needed through which sending<br>
of redundant information can be avoided to a high extent.<br>
A node as initially referred to is also needed through which<br>
one or more of the above mentioned objects can be achieved.<br>
Particularly a node acting as a sender or a node acting as a<br>
receiver or, most particularly, a node acting both as a<br>
sender and as a receiver is needed. A node is here taken to<br>
mean any sending or receiving node or device, for example a<br>
board in a base station, a client server, a mobile station,<br>
a web server (or any server) etc, or more generally a<br>
sending/receiving subsystem. Communicaiton within one node<br>
is then communication between subsystems. It should however<br>
be noted that the concept node should not be configured with<br>
nodes in the syntax tree as discussed below, which also are<br>
enoted nodes or syntax tree nodes.<br>
A method as initially referred to, through which one or more<br>
of the above mentioned objects can be achieved, is also<br>
needed.<br>
Therefore an arrangement as initially referred to is<br>
provided in which at least a number said sending nodes<br>
comprise message compression selection means for, based on<br>
one of more criteria, determining or selecting which<br>
messages are to be compressed or can be compressed, message<br>
compression means for compressing selected messages, where<br>
said message compressing means are adapted to use a syntax<br>
of the control signalling protocol for compression, unique<br>
identity assigning means for at least assigning messages<br>
which are to be compressed with a unique identity, and<br>
message information storing means, for example a cache, but<br>
also any other approptiate storing means, for example<br>
comprising a table, in which messages are sorted depending<br><br>
on type, i.e. depending on which type they are of, under<br>
said assigned unique identity, and message recognition means<br>
for recognizing previous messages of the same type stored in<br>
said storing means, and message distinguishing means for<br>
establishing the difference portion or portions between one<br>
or more previous messages and a current message of the same<br>
type. Only the difference portion or portions between the<br>
current message and a selected previous message and the<br>
unique identity of said selected previous message is sent as<br>
a compressed current message.<br>
Particularly a node at least acting as a sending node<br>
comprises unique identity assigning comprising unique<br>
identity calculation means for at least assigning messages<br>
which are to be compressed with a unique identity, whereby<br>
the unique identity particularly comprises a hash value.<br>
Particularly the storing means further comprises means for<br>
establishing and storing message type description<br>
information which is based on the syntax of the message and<br>
for linking the unique identity of a message to the type and<br>
to the message type description.<br>
Even more particularly the node at least acting as a sending<br>
node comprises calculating means for calculating the<br>
difference between one or more previous messages of the same<br>
type, preferably all messages of the same type (in the<br>
storing means), and the current message. Particularly<br>
criterion defining means are provided for giving or keeping<br>
criteria concerning which previous messages that are to be<br>
used for calculation of the difference and even more<br>
particularly the criterion defining means are controllable.<br>
In one embodiment no further differences are calculated when<br>
a criterion has been fulfilled. Alternatively it is searched<br>
for the "best", smallest, difference. Most particularly the<br><br>
criterion defining means at least comprise criteria relating<br>
to establishing the amount and/or kind of difference that is<br>
acceptable, i.e. in order to select or estblish which<br>
previous message that should be used as a previous message<br>
for admitting only the difference to be adhered to the<br>
unique identity of the previous message to form a compressed<br>
current message to be sent to a receiving node.<br>
Particularly the criteria defining means comprise previous<br>
message selecting means adapted to select a preferred<br>
previous message. Most particularly the preferred previous<br>
message is a message between which and the current message,<br>
the difference is the smallest. The size in bytes may for<br>
example be used as a measure for the size of the difference.<br>
It should be clear that also other criteria are possible.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, a sending node also acts as a<br>
receiving node. Then it comprises reconstruction means for<br>
mapping a received compressed message to the corresponding<br>
previous message using the information in the message<br>
information storing means by implementing the unique<br>
identity contained the compressed message that is received<br>
from the sending node. Particularly, when acting as a<br>
receiving and/or sending node, it comprises message storing<br>
decision means for determining or establishing if or when<br>
information concerning a received message is to be stored<br>
into the message information storing means.<br>
In a particularly advantageous implementation the message<br>
distinguishing means comprises difference calculation means<br>
for performing a message difference calculation based on a<br>
syntax representation of a current message and one or more<br>
previous messages.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, for message compression/<br>
decompression, a particular message layer is introduced<br>
between higher level protocol layers and the transport layer<br>
of the communication protocol such that message compression/<br>
decompression is integrated transparently into an existing<br>
computing system.<br>
Particularly the receiving and/or sending nodes comprise a<br>
radio base station, a board, e.g. a board in for example a<br>
Radio Base Station, a mobile station, a server, a web<br>
server, a client or similar.<br>
In order to solve one or more of the problems as referred to<br>
above and to achieve one or more of the objects of the<br>
invention, a node in a distributed communication system as<br>
initally referred to is also provided. The meaning of node<br>
in this specification has already been discussed above and<br>
node should hence be interpreted broadly.<br>
The node comprises control signalling message compression<br>
means, message compression selection means for determing or<br>
selecting, based on one or more criteria, which messages are<br>
to be compressed. Said compression means are adapted to use<br>
the syntax of a control signalling for compression of<br>
selected control signalling messages. Is also comprises<br>
message unique identity assigning means for providing<br>
messages to be stored in message information storing means<br>
with a unique identity and message information storing means<br>
for example comprising a table, in which storing means<br>
messages are sorted depending on message type, by means of<br>
the assigned unique identity and each message is linked to a<br>
message type description. I.e. the unique message type, but<br>
sorting is done depending on one hand (e.g. first), on<br>
message type, and on the other hand (second) depending on<br><br>
the assigned unique message ID. "First" and "second" is here<br>
merely given as a non-limiting example. Further message<br>
recognition means are preferably provided for recognizing<br>
messages of the same type and message distinguishing means<br>
for establishing the difference portion or portions, between<br>
a current, new message, and a number of previous messages of<br>
the same type. It is further adapted to, if one or more<br>
given criteria are met, send a current message as a<br>
compressed message comprising only the difference portion<br>
and the unique identity of the selected previous message.<br>
In a particular embodiment the message selection means<br>
comprises a selection algorithm. The algorithm may be static<br>
but it may also be dynamic. Preferably the storing means<br>
comprises a cache for example adapted to hold a given number<br>
of messages only, or to hold messages for a given time<br>
period, or based on both these criteria. In a very specific<br>
embodiment it might also be so constructed that it holds<br>
messages of a certain type for a given time period or a<br>
given amount of messages of one or more other types or<br>
messages may be held according to other criterias. It is<br>
also possible to hold all messages for a given time period.<br>
Particularly the identity assigning means comprises a unique<br>
identity calculation means for calculating a hash value for<br>
each message. Particularly said message type descriptions<br>
are based on message syntax and said storing means comprises<br>
means for linking each message to a message type<br>
description.<br>
Particularly the message type description specifies which<br>
type or types of parameters a message comprises, and<br>
optionally one or more of the order in which the parameters<br>
are provided or to be sent, or the allowed (or prohibited)<br><br>
values of said parameters. The message distingnishing means<br>
particularly comprises calculating means for calculating the<br>
difference between current messages and any or at least a<br>
given number of previous messages of the same type.<br>
Criterion defining means are provided which are adapted to<br>
give/keep criteria concerning amount and/or type of<br>
difference that is required to determine whether a message<br>
can be sent as a compressed message or not. Particularly, if<br>
a given criterion is met, the difference is added to the<br>
unique identity of a selected or preferred previous message<br>
and the message is sent as a compressed message comprising<br>
the difference and the unique identity of the previous<br>
message. The criteria may also or alternatively relate to<br>
e.g. for how many messages the difference should be<br>
calculated, when calculation is to be stopped due to an<br>
acceptable difference having been found etc.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the selected	or preferred<br>
previous message is the or one of the messages	differing the<br>
least from the current message, i.e. where the	difference is<br>
smallest.<br>
In advantageous implementations, the node further comprises<br>
a message reconstruction means in order to be able to also<br>
handle the reception of compressed messages. Hence, said<br>
message reconstruction means comprise recognition and<br>
decompressing means for detecting a received compressed<br>
message and for mapping the difference and the unique<br>
identity to the the appropriate previous message using said<br>
message information storing means, and adding the difference<br>
to the found previous message.<br>
The invention also discloses a method for sending a control<br>
plane signalling current message from a first, sending, node<br><br>
to a second node in a distributed communication system<br>
implementing a control plane signalling communication<br>
protocol. The method comprises the steps of; determining or<br>
selecting, based on a number of given decision criteria, if<br>
the message is compressible; if not, sending the message, if<br>
yes; establishing an unique identity for the message;<br>
estblishing the type of the message; storing the message<br>
with a unique identity, the message type and a message<br>
description in message information storing means;<br>
establishing if there is any entry in the message<br>
information storing means relating to previous messages of<br>
the same type as a current message; if not, sending the<br>
message, if yes; calculating the difference between the<br>
current message and one or more previous messages of the<br>
same type; selecting, based on a given selection criteria,<br>
the closest previous message or preferred previous message;<br>
generating a compressed message comprising the unique<br>
identity of the closest previous message and the difference<br>
between the current message and the selected closest or<br>
preferred previous message, and sending the compressed<br>
message.<br>
The decision criteria are particularly given by a decision<br>
criterion mechanism and may comprise a list of compressible<br>
message types. The decision criterion mechanism may also be<br>
based on a criterion stating that all messages are<br>
compressible. The decision criterion mechanism may comprise<br>
a dynamic or static algorithm for determining whether a<br>
message is compressible, for example based on length and/or<br>
type.<br>
In an advantageous implementation, the step of establishing<br>
the unique identity comprises; calculating a hash value,<br>
said hash value uniquely defining the message. Moreover,<br><br>
advantageously the step of generating a compressed message<br>
comprises; using the syntax of the control plane signalling<br>
to provide a message description.<br>
Also, advantageously, the step of calculating the difference<br>
comprises; representing the messages using a syntax tree<br>
comprising numbered nodes; using a rewriting scheme to<br>
express the difference based on said numbered nodes and for<br>
reconstruction of the message from the difference and a<br>
previous message. The difference calculation between a<br>
current and a previous message will result in a sequence of<br>
operations on the syntax tree which transforms the first,<br>
current, message to a second, compressed, message. The<br>
sequence constitutes the difference.<br>
Still further the invention suggests a method for handling<br>
reception of a control plane signalling current message from<br>
a first sending node in a second receiving node in a low<br>
transport layer of an implemented control plane signalling<br>
protocol, in a distributed communication system. The method<br>
comprises the steps of; receiving a current message;<br>
establishing if the message is compressed, if yes,<br>
establishing the unique identity contained in the compressed<br>
message; using the unique identity to find the corresponding<br>
previous message, particularly using a message information<br>
storing means; decompressing the compressed current message<br>
using the previous message and the received difference based<br>
on the use of a syntax based message description in message<br>
information storing means; establishing, based on<br>
predetermined criteria if the current, decompressed, message<br>
is to be stored in the message information storing means, if<br>
not, sending the current message to a higher protocol layer;<br>
if yes, establishing a unique identity of the current<br>
message and storing the message with message type and unique<br><br>
identity into the message information storing means, and,<br>
passing the current message to a higher protocol layer.<br>
It is a requirement that the receiving node comprises a<br>
message information storing means in which previous messages<br>
are stored and organized depending on message type and the<br>
unique identity uniquely defining each message, similar to<br>
the sending node, or, when a node act as both sender and<br>
receiver, the same message information storing means is used<br>
for implementation of both the compression and<br>
decompression.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 very schematically illustrates an arrangement 50 or a<br>
system comprising a sender or a sending node 10 and a<br>
receiver or a receiving node 20. In this very simplified<br>
block diagram it is supposed that the sending node 10 is<br>
equipped in order to be able to send compressed messages<br>
whereas the receiving node 20 is supposed to be equipped so<br><br>
as to be capable of handling reception of compressed<br>
messages. The inventive concept is applicable in one<br>
direction or in both directions and of course such<br>
embodiments are included wherein a node only is capable of<br>
acting as a sending node or as a receiving node respectively<br>
for the purposes of the inventive concept. However, mostly a<br>
node is capable to handle compression as well as<br>
decompression. Such a node is very schematically illustrated<br>
in Fig. 2 to be more thoroughly discussed below.<br>
It should be clear that a node here is taken to mean a node<br>
capable to act as a send for sending to other nodes and/or<br>
as a receiver for reception from other nodes, but also as a<br>
node within which sending and/or receiption can take place<br>
between node "sub-systems" or nodes acting as "sub-nodes".<br>
It should be clear that the nodes shown in Fig. 1 by no<br>
means are complete and they merely contain those means that<br>
are necessary for the inventive concept; other properties or<br>
means normally included in a sending node or a receiving<br>
node are not shown for reasons of clarity but also because<br>
the sending and receiving nodes may be of many different<br>
kinds.<br>
Hence the sending node 10 here comprises message compression<br>
selection means 11 which for example may include a dynamic<br>
or a static selection algorithm to select messages which are<br>
likely to be well compressible or which should be<br>
compressed. It may be based on one or more critera. The<br>
criteria generally relate to the length of the messages and<br>
possibly also to the redundancy of the messages. It is also<br>
possible to select all messages as compressible and the<br>
actual criteria solely being whether there are any other<br>
messages of the same type etc., as will be more thoroughly<br><br>
explained below, in the message information storing means<br>
13. Normally however, long messages with a high redundancy<br>
are selected. If a message is regarded as well compressible<br>
or selected as a compressible message, a message unique<br>
identity assigning means 12 is adapted to calculate a unique<br>
identity for the message. (It is also possible to calculate<br>
unique identities for all messages irrespectively of their<br>
being compressible or not, which however constitutes a less<br>
advantageous solution but which should not be excluded.) In<br>
a preferable implementation a hash value is calculated which<br>
allows unique identification of each message and a hash<br>
value is used as a message id.<br>
An incoming compressible message (or, alternatively, also<br>
other messages) are then stored into message information<br>
storing means 13 which are adapted to sort the messages<br>
depending on type. The calculated unique identity,<br>
preferably the hash value, is then used as a message id<br>
under which the messages are stored in the message<br>
information storing means 13. The message information<br>
storing means 13, for example comprising a table, also links<br>
each message to a message syntax based message type<br>
description specifying how the message is built up, e.g. all<br>
the parameters that are sent as well as type of parameters<br>
and their allowed values, order of parameters, limits etc.,<br>
also referred to as the message body. Message storing<br>
decision means may be provided as a separate means (not<br>
shown) or incorporated in the message information storing<br>
means 13 are provided for in any appropriate manner to<br>
enable building up of the table of message information<br>
storing means 13.<br>
The sending node 10 also comprises message recognition and<br>
distinguishing means 14. By recognition is here meant that<br><br>
the type of the message is recognized and distinguishing is<br>
here meant the establishment of the difference between the<br>
message and previous messages of the same type. To perform<br>
these steps, the message recognition and distinguishing<br>
means 14 are required to cooperate with the message<br>
information storing means 13, i.e. to locate messages of the<br>
same type as a current message. For at least a number of the<br>
located message or messages, a difference is calculated<br>
between the stored message and a current message to be sent.<br>
Different criteria may be set to determine for which<br>
previous messages the difference is to be calculated, or for<br>
how many. Further it does according to given criterias,<br>
select one of the messages as closest message, or the<br>
preferred message. Normally it is the message which differs<br>
the least from a current message, although also other<br>
criteria may be implemented, for example if a message is<br>
found and the difference does not exceed a given value, such<br>
message can be selected as a preferred message or if the<br>
difference falls under a given limit, it may be used as a<br>
preferred message etc. Thus, if a preferred message is<br>
found, if for example the difference is small enough, the<br>
calculated difference (the difference is calculated by means<br>
comprising or constituting the distinguishing means), the<br>
calculated difference is attached to the corresponding<br>
message unique identity, i.e. the previous preferred message<br>
found in the message information storing means 13.<br>
The message compressing means 15 are here seen substantially<br>
as an assembling means taking the difference from the<br>
recognition and distinguishing means and the unique identity<br>
from the message information storing means 13. This is<br>
merely a conceptual distinction that is made, the message<br>
compression means can also be seen as message compressing<br>
means 15 in communication with or comprising the message<br><br>
recognition and distinguishing means 14	and possibly also<br>
with the message information storing	means 13, which<br>
preferably is a cache although it also	may be some other<br>
storing means.<br>
The hence compressed message is then forwarded to a sending<br>
means 16 for sending it to, for example, a receiving node<br>
which e.g. may be a receiving subsystem. Hence a compressed<br>
message MSGCOmP consisting of the unique identity of the<br>
selected previous message and the calculated difference is<br>
sent to a receiving node 20.<br>
In this very simplified embodiment it is supposed that the<br>
receiving node 20 only assumes the functionality of a<br>
receiving node and hence only the means and functionalities<br>
required in order to support such a functionality are shown<br>
in the figure. Thus the receiving node 20 comprises<br>
compression detection means 22 receiving the message from<br>
receiving means 21. It is here supposed that the compression<br>
detection means are adapted to detect whether a message is<br>
compressed or not. In an alternative implementation a<br>
message may go directly to a message reconstruction means 24<br>
in which, if it is established that it is not a compressed<br>
message, the message is simply forwarded. However in this<br>
particular embodiment it is . supposed that the message<br>
reconstruction means 24 comprises means for, with the use of<br>
a message information storing means 23 similar to the one<br>
discussed with reference to the sending node 10, finding the<br>
previous message using the unique identity thereof and<br>
adding the difference to said previous message.<br>
Preferably the receiving arrangement also comprises storing<br>
decision means 25 for determining whether a new<br>
reconstructed message should be stored under the relevant<br><br>
type in message information storing means 23 or not. It may<br>
also be used to determine whether a non-compressed received<br>
message should be stored into a message information storing<br>
means 23 or not. Alternatively all messages are stored. Many<br>
variations are possible. If however the storing decision<br>
means 25 decide that the message is to be stored, it has to<br>
communicate with unique identity assigning or calculation<br>
means 26 similar to the message unique identity assigning<br>
means 12 of the sending node 10. Decompressed or<br>
reconstructed messages can be stored under a unique identity<br>
in the message information storing means. As referred to<br>
above the process is applicable either in both directions or<br>
in one direction only.<br>
Fig. 2 very schematically illustrates a node 30 acting both<br>
as a sending node and as a receiving node (RX/TX) . Only the<br>
means or functions which are required in order to perform<br>
compression/decompression for sending/receiving purposes<br>
according to the present invention are shown. Hence, as in<br>
Fig. 1 the node comprises message compression selection<br>
means 31 for selecting whether a message in convenient for<br>
compression or should be compressed. It is, when describing<br>
this figure, referred to the description of Fig. 1 in<br>
general. The sending/receiving node 30 further comprises<br>
compression detection means 32 for detecting whether an<br>
incoming message is compressed or not. The node comprises<br>
message information storing means 33 which are the same or<br>
substantially the same both for the receiving functionality<br>
and for the sending functionality. They are in communication<br>
with a storing decision means 37, cf. storing decision means<br>
25 of Fig. 1. Common means for unique identity assigning 36<br>
are provided which of course functions in the same manner<br>
irrespectively of whether it is for assigning an id to a<br>
decompressed message to be stored, or for any message to be<br><br>
stored. As in the preceding embodiment the unique identity<br>
assigning means 36 communicate with<br>
compression/decompression means 34 which here communicate<br>
with the message recognition and distingnishing means 35 as<br>
discussed with reference to Fig. 1 as well. They are here<br>
merely shown as one means but of course with two different<br>
functionalities. If a node acts as a receiver, a<br>
decompressed message is sent out to a higher layer of the<br>
communication protocol whereas if it is a message sending<br>
node, the message is sent out to a receiving node, via a<br>
lower layer of the communication stack.<br>
The message recognition and distinguishing means 40<br>
particularly comprises difference calculation means.<br>
Preferably the difference calculation is based on a syntax<br>
tree representation of the messages. Nodes in a syntax tree<br>
are numbered and a rewriting scheme is used to express the<br>
difference as well as for reconstructing the message from<br>
the difference and a previous message. For difference<br>
calculation and rewriting, the following operations on the<br>
syntax tree are defined: operation: here rewrite node (NID,<br>
replacement:); node NID here means node ID, i.e. a node<br>
address. Description of the operation: replace the contents<br>
of the referenced node NID with replacement. Operation:<br>
Delete node (NID). Description: delete the node NID.<br>
Operation: add node (NID, content). Description: adding of a<br>
node containing content after/under node NID.<br>
In order to minimize the size of the difference operations<br>
should particularly be identified by a short numberic code,<br>
e.g. rewrite = 1, delete = 2, add node = 3. It should be<br>
clear that this merely relates to one particular example.<br>
There are of course many other possibilities, particulary as<br><br>
far as the representation is concerned. The operations<br>
require referencing of the nodes of the syntax tree<br>
representation. In one particular, non-limiting,<br>
implementation, a two dimensional addressing scheme is used<br>
wherein the first dimension is the depth (e.g. starting with<br>
1 for the root node, and increased with 1 for every level of<br>
children added. The second dimension may be a left-to-right<br>
numbering of all children on a specific level. The left-to-<br>
right ordering of the children needs to be deterministic and<br>
supported by the message syntax, which in practice<br>
particularly means that information elements of messages are<br>
ordered. It should however be clear that the invention is<br>
not limited to such a numbering scheme but that, of course,<br>
also other numbering schemes are possible.<br>
It should be clear that the operations defined above require<br>
an unambiguous way to identitfy the content of a message,<br>
i.e. a way to address a node in a syntax tree.<br>
First, with references to Fig. 3 a signal flow scenario with<br>
message compression is illustrated between a sending side,<br>
here comprising a client dispatcher, for example a board in<br>
a base station, and a receiving side, here comprising a<br>
server receptor which for example may be a board in a base<br>
station. It is here supposed that a message 1, for example<br>
CarConfigure (of type B) is incoming to the client<br>
dispatcher, 1. It is here supposed that it is a message<br>
which is not compressible or that it is the first message of<br>
a given type etc; the figure merely intends to show that the<br>
message CarConfigure, 2, is sent to the server receptor.<br>
There the required action is performed, 3. In the sender a<br>
hash value is calculated, here for example with a unique<br>
identity ID = 2347 and a storing operation is performed<br>
wherein the ID and type of the message or messages is stored<br><br>
in storing means, 4. Simultaneously or later the same<br>
operation is performed on the receiving side, 5.<br>
At a later occasion it is supposed that a new or current<br>
message of type B arrives to the client dispatcher, 6. This<br>
message is denoted CarConfigure ' . In the client dispatcher<br>
the difference is then calculated between the first message<br>
MSG 1 and the current message, both of type B, 7. The<br>
calculated difference is as described above together with<br>
the unique identity of message 1 sent to the server<br>
receptor, 8, i.e. the compressed current message with ID =<br>
2347, difference (CarConfigure-CarConfigure'). On the<br>
receiving side the message ID = 2347 is looked up and in the<br>
storing means message MSG 1 is found. The current message is<br>
calculated through adding the difference to message 1, i.e.<br>
CarConfigure, 9. Subsequently the action in question is<br>
performed, here configure car, 10.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an example for calculating and applying a<br>
difference message, in the following also denoted delta<br>
message. Nodes are addressed top down (first coordinate) and<br>
left to right (second coordinate) . A message here is<br>
Car_Configure (nWheels = 4, mirrors = 2; [left = electric,<br>
center = manual], speed = 200) . The calculated new message<br>
with the difference or delta message added will be<br>
CarConfigure (nWheels = 4, mirrors = 3; [left = electric,<br>
center = manual, right = electric], speed = 240) . The delta<br>
message here is delta_message (ID = 2347, add Node(3,3 right<br>
= electric), rewrite Node (2, 2, 240)).<br>
The stored or previous message has identity 2347 as referred<br>
to above.<br><br>
Often the message syntax restricts the range of allowed<br>
parameters in the messages. Such parameter ranges may be<br>
used to generate code books for message elements and thus<br>
reduce the number of bytes needed to transfer parameters.<br>
This can be applied to minimize the size of the transferred<br>
difference messages. It can also be applied to message<br>
sending without difference calculation.<br>
Fig. 5 very schematically illustrates an example of message<br>
information storing means, for example a cache. In the<br>
storing means, for a message, the unique message identity,<br>
for example a calculated hash value, the type of the message<br>
and message body are stored. In the figure examples are<br>
given for the messages of type CarConfigure with a unique<br>
identity 0xAF3E and OxAB44 and for a message type CarDrive a<br>
message with unique identity OxCEFD and another with unique<br>
identity 0xCEF5. The message bodies include the message<br>
parameters. Advantagously the mechanism for message<br>
compression according to the inventive concept is integrated<br>
transparantely into an existing distributed computing<br>
system. In order to achieve that, an additional messageing<br>
stack layer may be introduced between a higher level<br>
protocol layer, where messages are handled to lower<br>
transport layers, cf. Fig. 6A, and the transport layer,<br>
lower layer protocol. I.e. a protocol layer message<br>
compressor/message decompressor is introduced between the<br>
higher level protocol and the lower layer protocol.<br>
Transparent integration has the advantage that it minimizes<br>
the impact on existing system design and allows for later<br>
integration, for example during performance optimization.<br>
This is very advantageous since then the concept can be<br>
introduced in already existing systems. It may however, also<br>
be taken into account and introduced at the system design<br>
level, i.e. right from the very beginning. That makes the<br><br>
concept widely applicable, and easy to implement and it is<br>
not required to exchange entire systems or system components<br>
in order to take advantage of the inventive concept.<br>
The inventive concept is very advantageous for applications<br>
with a considerable amount of complex control plane<br>
signalling, specially under conditions where communication<br>
bandwidth is a limiting factor. As examples can be given,<br>
Web services over Wireless Wide Area Networks, such as for<br>
example 3GPP (third Generation Partnership Project). Web<br>
Services use an XML-based protocol transported over HTTP for<br>
interaction between for example a mobile station and an<br>
application or a database server. Even if Web Services often<br>
mix control plane signalling and data traffic in a single<br>
message, pure or dominantly control plane signalling<br>
scenarios do also exist, for example for remote<br>
configuration of devices or exporting of device API:s<br>
(Application Programming Interfaces) to remote devices etc.<br>
Bandwidth in 3G networks is a very scarce resource while<br>
typically today's mobile devices have abundant computing<br>
resources both in terms of memory and MIPS. This is a gap<br>
which probably will increase even more in the soon future.<br>
An introduction of the inventive concept in such scenarios,<br>
would lead to the required bandwidth over the air interface<br>
being reduced considerably, especially as an XML data<br>
protocol has a very large potential for signal compression.<br>
As an example, a mobile application based on web services<br>
may access a server via some kind of a wireless connection,<br>
for example a 3G packet based service. The access comprises<br>
commands, for example search commands to a data-base server,<br>
and data transfer (for example transmission of retrieved<br>
search results). The inventive concept can be applied on<br>
sending/receiving of commands, and search commands may for<br>
example be redundant over time when new searches are<br><br>
modifications of previous searches. I.e. the concept may be<br>
implemented for a mobile device and a remote database.<br>
Other possible applications are in radio base stations.<br>
Radio base stations are complex distributed systems with an<br>
enormous amount of control plane signalling between<br>
subsystems. Especially configuration signals for radio links<br>
often carry many parameters, most of which are not altered<br>
between subsequent signals. The inventive concept can<br>
provide for considerable bandwidth savings in such<br>
scenarios.<br>
In one embodiment, schematically illustrated in Fig. 6B,<br>
message compression is integrated into the sending stack for<br>
layer 3 control plane signalling: transparent integration of<br>
message compression, higher layer level, layer 3, whereas<br>
lower layer is layer 2 of the main processor and it is used<br>
in signalling to the transmitter and receiver boards. User<br>
data flows are normally not suited for application of the<br>
inventive concept.<br>
Fig. 7 is a flow diagram describing the receiving concept of<br>
the present invention which proposes a method to improve<br>
control plane signalling performance by leaving the existing<br>
protocol intact as seen from the subsystems and introducing<br>
syntax based compression of signal flow which is transparent<br>
for the sending and the receiving system components. The<br>
invention is actually based on the observation that control<br>
plane signalling, for larger systems, usually is governed by<br>
some kind of syntax and that for reasons of design rules and<br>
design robustness, transmitted information often is<br>
redundant and repetitive. Thus, according to the invention<br>
the syntax of the control plane signalling is used to<br>
compress the control plane signals and a signal cache (for<br><br>
example) is built up which allows sending of shorter<br>
difference, or delta, signals instead of complete signals.<br>
Moreover, preferably a dynamic or static selection algorithm<br>
is used to select messages which are likely to be well<br>
compressible, or messages which it is advantageous to<br>
compress in that the savings in e.g. bandwidth are high.<br>
Hence, in Fig. 7 it is supposed that a message is received,<br>
100, in a node acting as a sending node. It is supposed that<br>
the message is denoted current message. Then it is<br>
determined whether the message to be transmitted is<br>
compressible or not, 101. This can be done in many different<br>
ways. In one implementation all messages are considered as<br>
compressible. A list may also be provided stating which<br>
message types that are compressible. Still further an<br>
algorithm may be used to select compressible messages, for<br>
example based on length and/or type. If however, it is<br>
determined that the message is not compressible, the current<br>
message is sent as a conventional message, 101A. If,<br>
however, it is determined that the message is compressible,<br>
a unique identity is assigned to the message, 102, in this<br>
particular implementation a hash value is calculated for the<br>
message. The message, i.e. the current message, is stored in<br>
message information storing means, with a unique identity,<br>
e.g. a hash value, the message type, and message<br>
information, or the message body, 103. Then it is<br>
established whether the current message type already is<br>
present in a message storing means, 104, i.e. if there<br>
already are one or more messages of the same type stored in<br>
the storing means. If not, the message is sent as it is,<br>
101A. If however there are messages of the same type as the<br>
current message, differences are calculated between the<br>
current message and such already existing, also denoted<br>
previous, messages, 105. This can be done in different<br><br>
manners, differences between the current message and all<br>
such previous messages may be calculated, or some particular<br>
criteria can be given such that if a difference is found and<br>
the difference is small enough, no further calculations are<br>
performed etc. In any case, somehow a previous message is<br>
selected, 106, for example the previous message with the<br>
smallest difference from the current message, i.e. the<br>
closest previous message. Then the compressed message or a<br>
delta message is built as the unique identity of the closest<br>
previous message, or of the preferred message, and the<br>
calculated difference, 107. Then the in this way assembled<br>
current message is sent as a compressed or delta message,<br>
108.<br>
Fig. 8 is a flow diagram schematically describing the<br>
procedure for message decompression, i.e. decompression of a<br>
message received in a receiving node. Hence, it is supposed<br>
that a current message is received, 201, from lower layers.<br>
It is then established or detected if the current message is<br>
compressed or not, 202. If it is not compressed, it is<br>
established whether it is to be stored in the message<br>
information storing means, 206, and then the current message<br>
is forwarded to higher layers, 207. If it is established<br>
that the message is compressed, the unique identity is found<br>
in the compressed, delta, message, 203, and using the unique<br>
identity, the previous or base message and the difference<br>
included in the compressed current message is used to<br>
calculate the original, (un-compressed) current message,<br>
205. Then, preferably, it is established if the current<br>
message is to be stored in message information storing<br>
means, 206. If not, it is passed on to higher layers, if<br>
yes, a hash value is calculated and the assembled current<br>
message is stored with hash, type and the message body,<br>
206A. Then the message is sent out. The criteria used to<br><br>
determine whether a message is to be stored or not can be of<br>
many different kinds, a message may be stored due to a<br>
sender request or algorithm parameters. For example a number<br>
may be given to indicate how many messages that are to be<br>
stored, for example the 100 latest messages can be stored<br>
etc. It should be clear that the concept can be varied in a<br>
number of ways, different criterias may be used for<br>
selecting compressibilty or for storing into storing means<br>
etc.<br>
The procedures described above considerably reduce the load<br>
related to sending and reception of control plane<br>
signalling, but adds a memory and CPU time consuming<br>
processing step to the sending and receiving subsystem. This<br>
means that advantageously an a-priori or a dynamic selection<br>
of which messages are to be processed by the inventive<br>
concept can be provided for, as well as the memory available<br>
for message cache needs to be provided for or taken into<br>
consideration. Generally, the more parameters a message<br>
carries, the larger the optimization potential will be. The<br>
message cache could be dimensioned to only hold one or a<br>
very few disparate messages of each type. Moreover, if<br>
computing power and memory are available but communicating<br>
capacity, for example via an air interface, is limited, the<br>
inventive concept is potentially very efficient. However,<br>
also other factors may be taken into consideration or be<br>
disregarded etc.<br>
Fig. 9 is a diagram illustrating a simulation for a simple<br>
model showing savings as a function of redundancy and<br>
information element (IE) length for a message length of 100<br>
bytes. It is here assumed that the overhead for messages is<br>
4 bytes and the overhead for the writing commands is 2 bytes<br><br>
per command. As can be seen the savings increase with an<br>
increasing redundancy.<br>
Fig. 10 shows redundancy versus message length to achieve<br>
20% savings in message sending. Generally the possibilities<br>
or the benefit of a message compression increases<br>
considerably with an increasing message length. In Fig. 10<br>
the message length and redundancy is shown for an<br>
information element length of 4 bytes. Ganerally it is much<br>
more beneficial to compress longer messages than shorter<br>
messages.<br>
In a preferred implementation it is provided for storing<br>
means, or particularly cache, coherency which means that<br>
mechanisms are introduced to secure cache coherency on a<br>
sending and on a receiving side. Still further, in an<br>
advantageous implementation an error handling mechanism is<br>
provided for in order to handle the situation of unexpected<br>
cache incoherency.<br>
Further for the difference calculation, computational<br>
activity may be more important than minimizing the size of<br>
the calculated difference information.<br>
It should be clear that the invention can be varied in a<br>
number of ways and applied to different kinds of senders and<br>
receivers, one-directionally or two-directionally. Further<br>
it can be implemented in many different manners using<br>
different algorithms and storing means and be based on<br>
different criterias for selection of compressibility and for<br>
selection of closest message etc. Also in other aspects the<br>
invention is not limited to the explicitly illustrated<br>
embodiments but it can be varied in a number of ways within<br>
the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
