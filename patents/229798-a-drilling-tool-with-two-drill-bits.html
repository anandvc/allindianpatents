				<td>Description Drilling tool<br>
This invention relates to a drilling tool with two drill bits located on its opposite ends as described in the introduction to Claim 1. The term "drilling tool" as used here means a drill that is designed for the creation of a boring with a constant diameter, as well as, for example, a stepped drill or a combination drill and countersink tool.<br>
A drilling tool of the type described above is known, for example, from DE 1 752 616 A1. This double-tipped drilling tool is manufactured from an extruded profile, which is divided into individual small rods. As a result of the extrusion process, the chip flutes of the drilling tool have an unvarying profile over its length.<br>
A drilling tool, in particular one that is used for machining metal workpieces, frequently has at least one replaceable cutting insert. The base body, to which the cutting insert can be fastened, can therefore be used beyond the useful life of the cutting insert. Drilling tools with replaceable cutting inserts, however, are typically limited to larger diameters. As a rule, one-piece drills are used for drilling smaller-diameter borings, for example up to 10 mm. In spite of the fact that they can generally be re-ground and re-used, their useful life is significantly shorter than that of a drill with a replaceable cutting insert or a plurality of replaceable cutting inserts.<br>
The object of the invention is to indicate a drilling tool which has a particularly long useful life, in particular also at tool diameters up to 10 mm.<br>
The invention teaches a drilling tool that has the characteristics disclosed in Claim 1. The drilling tool has a drill bit on each end, whereby each drill bit has at least two cutting edges. Spiral<br><br>
WO 2005/018856	PCT/EP2004/008987<br>
chip flutes extend continuously from the cutting edges on the one drill bit to the cutting edges on the other drill bit. In the vicinity of the drill bits, each of the at least two chip flutes corresponding to the number of cutting edges per drill bit have in themselves an asymmetrical shape. As a result of the asymmetrical configuration of each chip flute, these tools are particularly well suited for a cutting geometry with controlled chip formation that is particularly advantageous for metal-removing operations. The asymmetrical profile of the chip flutes makes a transition, not later than toward the middle of the drilling tool, into a symmetrical profile, so that as the chip flutes proceed further toward the second drill bit, they once again assume a non-symmetrical shape, which is preferably the same as the shape at the first drill bit. As a variant from this configuration, the geometry of the second drill bit can also differ from the geometry of the first drill bit, and/or can also have an at least slightly different diameter, whereby in each case an asymmetrical profile of each chip flute is present in the areas adjacent to the drill bits and a symmetrical chip flute profile is present in an area that lies in between. The useful life of the drilling tool, which is also called a drill below, is therefore extended to almost twice that of a conventional drill that has only one drill bit.<br>
The drilling tool, regardless of whether it is made out of a single material or of a plurality of different materials, is preferably provided so that it cannot be disassembled, for example for the extraction of a cutting insert. Possible materials that can be used as materials for the drill are all the materials or material combinations, with or without coatings, that are used in the prior art for conventional borers that have a single drill bit. If the drill bits are formed by separate tool bits, the bits are preferably permanently connected with the base body of the drilling tool, for example by soldering, whereby the tool bits are preferably made from a material that is harder than the material of the base body. In this embodiment, too, the chip flutes extend over the entire drilling tool, including the base body.<br>
In one preferred configuration, the drilling tool has cooling channels which each extend from one drill bit to the opposite drill bit.<br><br>
WO 2005/018856	PCT/EP2004/008987<br>
Each cooling channel is thereby associated with an individual cutting edge on each drill bit, whereby the function of the inlet and outlet openings of the cooling channels is interchangeable.<br>
In the vicinity of the drill bits, the drilling tool has a shape, for example, that corresponds to one of the twist drills known from EP 0 249 104 A1, DE 100 275 544 A1 or DE 199 55 172 A1. Twist borers of this type are characterized by, among other things, good pipe tapping properties and possible high feeds while still achieving a long useful life.<br>
The drilling tool, together with a chucking device, preferably forms a drilling device having the characteristics disclosed in Claim 6. One part of the chucking device is a chucking sleeve which has an internal profiling that matches at least in part the shape of the chip flutes of the drill and thus makes possible a particularly precise chucking. In this case, preferably at least one opening cross section of the chucking sleeve at least in part matches the shape of the chip flutes. As a result, a penetration of chips into the chucking sleeve is prevented. Furthermore, an inner profiling of the chucking sleeve, which extends over the overall length, i.e. at least the major portion of the length of the chucking sleeve and matches the geometry of the drilling tool, makes possible a reliable chucking of the drilling tool, which is comparable to the chucking of a conventional drilling tool on the shank of a part of the tool without flutes.<br>
Alternatively to the configuration disclosed in Claim 6, a conventional draw-in collet chuck without internal profiling is also suitable for chucking the drilling tool, provided that the expansion capability of the collet is large enough to bridge any potential jumps or transitions in the diameter of the borer.<br>
In accordance with one preferred development of the chucking device disclosed in Claim 6, a sealing washer is provided that interacts with the chucking sleeve, and in particular is inserted in it or pushed over it, and by means of which an improved seal with respect to coolant-lubricant can be achieved. The sealing washer is preferably located on the side of the chucking sleeve facing the rear drill bit. As a result, no coolant lubricant or practically no coolant lubricant that is<br><br>
WO 2005/018856	PCT/EP2004/008987<br>
introduced into the drilling tool gets into the chucking sleeve or outward between the drill and the chucking sleeve. The term "rear drill bit" in this context means the drill bit that under current operating conditions is not being used for chip removal. The sealing washer located in this area also provides mechanical protection for the rear drill bit, which may be damaged, for example, by the vibrations that occur during chip removal operation.<br>
To be able to insert the chucking sleeve easily into a conventional chuck, e.g. a hydraulic expansion chuck, the chucking sleeve preferably has a constant outside diameter. The material for the chucking sleeve, which in this case is also called a chucking shank, is preferably plastic or another flexible material such as rubber. The inside surface of the chucking sleeve is preferably configured so that the chucking sleeve simultaneously performs the function of a sealing washer. In this configuration, the drill is provided so that it can be screwed into the chucking shank. The chucking shank can either have a constant inner profiling over its entire length or can be provided with a blind hole to receive the drilling tool. When the chucking shank is realized with a blind hole, cooling lubricant can be fed to the drilling tool from outside. Likewise, however, it is also possible, instead of the blind hole, an area with a smaller inside diameter is provided through which coolant lubricant can also be fed in axially to the drill.<br>
The advantage of the invention is, among other things, that a drill with two bits and continuous chip flutes can be used by means of a chucking sleeve coordinated with it, can be used in the same manner as a conventional borer that has only one bit, whereby in comparison to a conventional drill, there are no restrictions on its use, e.g. with regard to the maximum drilling depth.<br>
Several exemplary embodiments of the invention are described in greater detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

Parts in the different figures that are identical, analogous or perform the same function are identified using the same numbers in all the figures.<br>
Figures 1a and 1b to 5a and 5b each show an exemplary embodiment of a drilling tool 1 that has two drill bits 2, 3. Each drilling tool 1 is realized in one piece and has a first area A adjacent to the first drill bit 2, a contiguous middle area B and a rear area C that is adjacent to the second drill bit 3. In the exemplary embodiments illustrated in Figures 1a and 1b to 4a and 4b, a reduced diameter D2 in the middle area B is smaller than the tool diameter D^ Consequently, in particular in the particularly preferred exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figures 2a and 2b, a set of different tools can each have different tool diameters D1, which are dictated in each case by the outer areas A, C of the drilling tool 1, but identical reduced diameters D2. All the tools of the set are thus suitable for the same chucking device. The cutting edges of each drilling tool 1<br><br>
WO 2005/018856	PCT/EP2004/008987<br>
are identified by the reference numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, and the corresponding chip flutes by the reference numbers 8, 9. In each of the exemplary embodiments illustrated in Figures 1a and 1b and 2a and 2b, there are also four guide faces 10. Two cooling channels 11 are shown simply by way of example in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figures 5a and 5b, which are preferably also present in all the other exemplary embodiments.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the shape of the chip flutes 8, 9 which extend over the entire length of each drilling tool 1. While in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 6, the drilling tool 1 is realized in one piece, for example, and is made of carbide coated using the CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) method, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 7, two tool bits 12, 13, which can, for example, be coated or uncoated tungsten carbide, are permanently connected with a base body 14 which forms the middle area B of the drilling tool 1, in particular by soldering to the base body 14.<br>
Figures 8a and 8b show two different cross sections of the drilling tool 1 illustrated in Figure 6. In the vicinity of the maximum tool diameter D1, the drilling tool 1 has the asymmetrical profile of the chip flutes 8, 9 illustrated in Figure 8a, which is optimized for the cutting method and chip formation. In this case, each chip flute 8, 9 is asymmetrical in itself, whereby the shape of the first chip flute 8 is the same as the shape of the second chip flute 9. On the other hand, in the vicinity of the reduced diameter D2, as illustrated in Figure 8b, the cross section of each chip flute 8, 9 is symmetrical overall in comparison to the outer areas A, C of the drill 1. The chip flutes 8, which are thereby optimized in terms of chip transport, have a constant cross section in the entire middle area B. The transition between the area of each chip flute 8, 9 that faces the drill bits 2, 3 and is in itself asymmetrical, and the middle, symmetrical area of each chip flute 8, 9 is continuous, i.e. without edges or discontinuities.<br>
Figures 9a and 9b show a chucking sleeve 15 which is suitable for a drilling tool of the type illustrated in Figure 6 or 7, for example. The chucking tool 15 is assembled from a cylinder body 16 and a cover 17, which has an opening cross section 18 that approximately matches the<br><br>
WO 2005/018856	PCT/EP2004/008987<br>
shape of the chip flutes 8, 9. The opening cross section 18, on the guide faces 10, has coordinated flutes 19, which are indicated as dotted lines in Figure 9a as a portion of an inner profiling, and are continued into the cylinder body 16.<br>
Figures 10a to 10c illustrate a sealing washer 21 which is made of an elastomer, which has an edge segment 22 in the shape of a cylinder jacket, and a sealing surface 23 bordered by said edge segment and matching the cross section of the chip flutes 8, 9.<br>
The function of the clamping sleeve 15 and of the sealing washer 21 is illustrated in greater detail in Figures 11a, 11b, 12a and 12b. In the figures, the drilling tool 1 is chucked in an expansion chuck 24 by means of the chucking sleeve 15, in which the sealing washer 21 is inserted on the side facing away from the drill bit 2 used for the chip removal. The drilling tool 1 can be chucked in axially different positions in the expansion chuck 24, which can also theoretically be replaced by another type of chuck, such as a draw-in collet chuck. In general, the cutting edges 4, 5 which are used during the cutting operation are also called the forward cutting edges, and the cutting edges 6, 7 that are located on the inactive drill bit 3 that is kept in reserve are called the rear cutting edges. The cooling lubricant that is fed inside the expansion chuck 24 to the drilling tool 1 can flow at most only in a small proportion through the chip flutes 8, 9, and is thereby conducted through the cooling channels 10, which are not visible in this exemplary embodiment, to the drill bit 2.<br>
Figure 13 shows, in an illustration that is analogous to Figure 12b, a dual-bit drilling tool 1 chucked in an expansion chuck 24. Instead of the chucking sleeve 15 in Figure 12b, however, a plastic shank 25 is used. The plastic shank 25 is shown in isolation in a schematic side and front view in Figures 14a and 14b. The front view (Figure 14b) shows that the cross section of the plastic shank 25 is theoretically identical to the cross section of the sealing washer 21 (Figures 10a to 10c), i.e. it has an opening surfaces that matches the cross section of the drill 1. To make it easier to screw the drill 1 into the plastic shank 25 and in particular to make the plastic<br><br>
WO 2005/018856	PCT/EP2004/008987<br>
shank 25 suitable for use with drills 1 of a different diameter, slots 26 in the axial direction are provided over slightly more than one-half of the length of the plastic shank 25. The plastic shank 25 illustrated in Figures 14a and 14b is realized for a drilling tool 1 with a twist angle of 30 degrees of the chip flutes. The slots 26 are unnecessary in some cases, in particular if the plastic shank 25 is provided only for one specific drill diameter.<br>
Figures 15a and 15b show the longitudinal section of the plastic shank 25. These figures, also show, as indicated by the double arrow, that the plastic shank 25 can be optionally located on each of the two sides of the drilling tool 1. In that case, one of the drill bits 2 is approximately flush with the end surface of the plastic shank 25. In a variant of the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the drill can also be axially shifted to any position inside the shank.<br>
Figures 16a and 16b show, in views that are similar to Figures 15a and 15b, a drilling tool 1 held in a plastic shank. In contrast to the plastic shank 25 illustrated in Figures 13 to 15b, the plastic shank 25a shown in Figures 16a and 16b does not have a constant inside diameter, but a tapered diameter 27. When the drilling tool 1 is screwed all the way into the plastic shank 25a, its bit 2 is in contact against a peripheral step 28 which separates the tapered segment 27 from the remaining, untapered inner wall 29 of the plastic shank 25a. In contrast to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in Figures 13 to 15b, the drill bit is thereby at some distance from the end surface of the plastic shank 25. The tapered segment 27 can be used to feed coolant lubricant to the drilling tool 1, and therefore forms a coolant lubricant channel, if necessary. If there is no need to feed in a coolant lubricant, the plastic shank 25a can be completely closed at the point of the tapered segment 27.</td>
