				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of polyaluminium chlorosulphates of high basicity and to the use of the polyaluminium chlorosulphates for the treatment of drinking water, for the treatment of aqueous effluents and in the paper industry.<br>
Polyaluminium chlorosulphates have the general formula:<br>
Al(OH),ClbY0/dM'Cl2/eM"Cl	(I)<br>
in which Y represents an anion of valency 2, such as S042", M' represents a cation of valency 2, such as an alkaline-earth metal,<br>
M" represents a cation of valency 1, such as an alkali metal or ammonium,<br>
a, b, c and d are non-zero positive integers or positive fractions,<br>
e is zero or a positive integer or positive fraction, b ■ 3 - 2c - a and 2d + e + b s 3.<br>
The basicity 0 is defined by the ratio a/3 expressed as a percentage, and it may range from 20 to 75%. Starting with a chemical composition, it may be calculated by the following formula:<br>
b = 100 (3A1 + 2 M' + M" - 2Y - CD/3A1 in which Al, M', M", Y and CI are expressed in moles.<br><br>
Polyaluminium chlorosulphates, referred to hereinbelow as PACS, are widely used in industry, in particular in papermaking and for the treatment of waste water and especially drinking water, where their high quality of coagulation and flocculation make them a choice product.<br>
More precisely, for the treatment of waters, processes are desired which avoid any formation of effluent, in particular of gypsum (CaS04-2H20) and which make it possible to manufacture products having capacities for flocculation-coagulation of materials in suspension in drinking water, capacities of releasing only very little soluble aluminium into treated drinking water and a stability on storage of the PACS solutions over several months, that is to say including temperature variations between 0°C and 40°C, or even more if the storage is not protected from the sun's rays.<br>
European patent specification EP 327,419 describes a process for the manufacture of high-basicity PACS which satisfies the capacities and stability as mentioned above. However, this process generates a gypsum effluent whose discharge into river water poses environmental problems and whose dumping entails additional costs.<br>
The efficacy of flocculation-coagulation is evaluated by measuring the turbidity of the supernatant water phase after treatment with a PACS. Large floes<br><br>
/<br>
having properties of rapid separation after settling has taken place settle out, whereas the smallest floes can be entrained on a sand filter and must have an excellent capacity to be absorbed on a sand filter. The efficacy of the thorough filtration on a sand filter is characterized by the number of particles per cm3 which are found in the clarified waters.<br>
The capacity to release only a very low residual content of aluminium into drinking water is evaluated by filtering the treated water through a 0.45 f*m  filter and assaying the aluminium present.<br>
A PACS in solution is said to be stable if it retains its applicative properties after storage for 3 months at room temperature and for 1 month at 40°C and if it deposits no solid, at 40°C over one month or at room temperature (25°C) over three months.<br>
Several problems were posed in the common applications of PACSs, resulting in particular from the processes for their manufacture.<br>
Elimination of the turbidity, which is directly associated with the flocculation-coagulation, requires a high sulphate content and a low temperature for the basification step, below 70°C, preferably below 40°C. When the sulphate content is high, PACSs have a resistance to high temperature. Without having a negative impact on the elimination of the turbidity, it then becomes possible to carry out syntheses above 70°C, for example between 80°C and 90°C for a ratio of<br><br>
the sulphate/alumina percentages by mass of greater than 3/10.5.<br>
The treatment of drinking water requires the production of a low residual aluminium content in the treated water, which implies a high basicity of the PACSs, of between 60% and 75%. The residual aluminium content in the treated water decreases when PACSs synthesized at high temperatures in the basification step, typically above 70°C and preferably between 80°C and 85°C, are used. When the ratio of the sulphate/ alumina percentages by mass increases from 0.1/10 to 3/10, the residual aluminium content rapidly increases to stabilize at the ratio 3/10 up to 23.8/8.5. The residual aluminium contents are too high for a ratio of the sulphate/alumina percentages by mass of greater than 0.1/10.<br>
In order to obtain PACSs which are effective in terms of residual aluminium, it is necessary to have PACSs of high basicity, a high temperature for the basification step and a very low sulphate content in the PACSs. A high temperature and a low sulphate content are conditions opposed to the production of PACSs which are effective in eliminating the turbidity.<br>
PACSs in solution must be stable on storage and at temperatures up to 40°C. The temperature-stability of PACSs in solution increases as the sulphate/alumina mass ratio increases. PACSs in solution are often very stable for ratios of the<br><br>
sulphate/alumina percentages by mass of greater than 3/10.<br>
In Japanese patent specification JP-53      ' 001699/1978, a process is described for the manufacture of polyaluminium chlorosulphate. This process consists, in a first step, in basifying a polychlorosulphate containing a large amount of sulphate with an eguimolar amount of CaC03, leading to the production of gypsum (CaS04*2H20) which is separated out. In a second step, the product of the previous step, whose basicity is between 55% and 58%, is reacted with a compound chosen from the group consisting of CaC03, NaHC03, Na2C03, Mg(OH)2 and MgO, without exceeding a temperature of 60°C. Although the basicity is between 65-70%, the residual aluminium contents in the treated waters are 30% to 60% higher than those obtained with the PACSs obtained according to the process described in the abovementioned European patent specification EP 327,419. A temperature of 60°C is insufficient and a temperature above 70°C degrades the flocculation-coagulation properties. The main drawback of this process lies in a considerable underproduction of gypsum whose disposal poses environmental problems, as has already been mentioned above.<br>
Japanese patent specification JP 52 113384/1977 describes a process for the manufacture of 65-70% basic polyaluminium chlorosulphate by addition of an alkaline agent such as CaC03, NaHC03, Mg(OH), and/<br><br>
or MgO to a solution of aluminium chloride or basic aluminium chloride, still at a temperature below 60°C. It is observed that the residual aluminium contents are again too high when compared with the PACSs obtained according to the process described in European patent specification EP 327,419, for the same reasons as those explained in Japanese patent specification JP-53 001699/1978 above. A large amount of gypsum is by-produced, which remains a drawback.<br>
Canadian patent application CA 2,109,756 Al describes the manufacture of a flocculant, without generation of gypsum, by adding gypsum to a solution of aluminium chlorosulphate at a temperature between 45°C and 98°C, preferably 75°C. The gypsum thus added is totally dissolved; the calcium concentration remains limited in a range of from 0.1% to 0.4% of Ca2+. It is clearly pointed out that the basification step with a base such as, for example, CaC03 must be performed at 45°C. The basicity of the product, as obtained according to that patent, is less than 55%. The ratio of the sulphate/alumina percentages by mass is in the region of 3/10. However, when the examples were repeated, it was not possible to reproduce the stated basicities of 55%, but instead lower basicities were found, between 10% and 15%. The residual aluminium contents are excessive when compared with the PACSs obtained according to the process described in European patent specification EP 327,419.<br><br>
For the purpose of improving the residual amount of aluminium remaining in a treated water, the abovementioned European patent specification EP 327,419 proposes a process for the preparation of PACS of high basicity, between 60% and 70%. This process consists in particular in placing a solution of aluminium, of chloride and of excess sulphate in contact with a basic alkaline-earth compound, in lowering from 93°C to 65°C and then in removing the insoluble alkaline-earth metal sulphate by filtration. It should be noted that the synthesis is started in a large excess of sulphate and that, simultaneously with the lowering of the temperature, the sulphate content in the reaction medium decreases. Thermal degradation of the PACS solutions, which are sensitive to low levels of sulphate, is thus avoided; typically for this product S042" = 1.9%, A1203 - 10.5%. The PACSs of high basicity thus obtained make it possible to obtain lower residual aluminium contents in the treated water, as has already been mentioned previously. However, this process has the major drawback of generating large amounts of gypsum (about 300 kg per ton of PACS produced).<br>
European patent specification EP 557,153 also describes a process for the preparation of PACS of high basicity, which leads to few effluents. However, this process has the serious drawback of being difficult to reproduce. This lack of reproducibility is shown in particular by the production of a high level of<br><br>
residual aluminium in the treated water 8 times out of 10. This residual level of aluminium may reach an amount which is 40% higher than that obtained with the PACSs described in European patent specification EP 327,419.<br>
It is recalled that in order to obtain PACSs which are effective in terms of residual aluminium, it is necessary to have a PACS of high basicity, manufactured at a high basification temperature with a very low sulphate content in the PACSs. A high temperature and a low sulphate content are conditions that are opposed to the production of PACS which are effective in eliminating the turbidity.<br>
This has been observed in particular in French patent specification FR 2,317,227 and European patent specification EP 0,557,153, according to which it is impossible to overbasify a 40% basic aluminium chlorosulphate to about 55-70%, with a base, at a temperature above 70°C without avoiding degradation of the flocculent properties of the products. The temperature range mentioned in the above two patents is 40°C to 70°C for the first and from 50°C to 70°C for the second. The products described in French patent specification FR 2,317,227 have basicities of between 40% and 55%, as compared with 65% to 75% for European patent application EP 0,557,153 Al. The ratio of the S042"/A1203 percentages by mass is less then 3/10.5.<br>
According to European patent specification<br><br>
EP 327,419, it is possible to work above 70°C by starting the synthesis with an excess of sulphate which is precipitated as gypsum. It is also possible to work above 70°C if a final product containing more than 3% S042" for 10.5% A1303 is aimed at.<br>
The problem to solve is thus one of obtaining stable PACSs having good flocculent properties with an ability to pass on little residual aluminium to the treated water, while at the same time being obliged to    . manufacture PACSs according to a process which produces the least possible amount of effluents. Furthermore, it is desired by PACS users that the smallest floes should have good properties of absorption on sand filters.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a process for the preparation of polyaluminium chlorosulphate of high basicity, having the general formula:<br>
Al(OH),ClbYc/dM'Cl2/eM"Cl	(I)<br>
in which<br>
Y represents an anion of valency 2, such as S042", M' represents a cation of valency 2, such as an alkaline-earth metal,<br>
M" represents a cation of valency 1, such as an alkali metal or ammonium,<br>
a, b, c and d are non-zero positive integers or positive fractions and<br>
e is zero or a positive integer or positive fraction such that<br><br><br>
and having a basicity fi,   defined by the formula /8 m  100 x (3A1+ 2M' + M" - 2Y - CD/3A1 in which Al, M', M", Y and Cl are expressed in moles, between 60% and 75%, and preferably between 65% and 70%, which process comprises placing a basic compound of an alkali metal, preferably in aqueous solution, and at least one basic compound of an alkaline-earth metal or a halide of an alkaline-earth metal, in aqueous suspension or in the form of a powder, in the presence of sulphate ions, in contact with a basic solution of aluminium chloride of formula:<br>
Al(OH)xCly	(II)<br>
in which x is a number between 0.1 and 1.5 and y = 3-x, at a temperature between room temperature (about 25°C) and 70°C, and then, after the basification, cooking the reaction medium obtained at a cooking temperature between 60°C and 95°C, the cooking time being between 3 h and 20 h, and preferably between 5 h and 9 h, for a cooking temperature of 60°C, and being between 5 minutes and 15 minutes, and preferably between 7 minutes and 10 minutes, for a cooking temperature of 95°C.<br>
According to the present invention, the cooking times for cooking temperatures of 70°C, 80°C, 85°C and 90°C are given in the following table.<br><br><br>
For all intermediate cooking temperatures, a person skilled in the art will proceed by extrapolation.<br>
According to the present invention, the ratio of the sulphate/alumina percentages by mass is advantageously less than 3/10.5 and preferably between 1/10.5 and 1.5/10.5.<br>
According to the present invention, the reactants are preferably placed in contact with vigorous stirring and/or with vigorous turbulence.<br>
Thus, any means which makes it possible to obtain high turbulence, such as injection with a nozzle or venturi, may be used.<br>
The cooking is advantageously carried out<br><br>
with stirring, which is preferably less vigorous than that performed when the reactants are placed in contact.<br>
According to the present invention, the expression "basic compound of an alkali metal" denotes any derivative of the said alkali metal which has a basic nature, in particular oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate. By way of illustration of basic compounds of an alkali metal which can be used according to the present invention, mention will be made of NaOH, KOH, NaHC03, Na2C03, K2C03, KHC03 and mixtures of two or more of the basic compounds of an alkali metal listed above. Preferably, NaOH or Na2C03 will be used.<br>
These compounds are preferably used in the form of an aqueous solution. The molar concentration of the basic compound of an alkali metal is preferably at least equal to 2 mol/1 and more preferably between 4 mol/1 and 7 mol/1.<br>
According to the present invention, the expression "basic compound of an alkaline-earth metal" denotes any derivative of the said alkaline-earth metal which has a basic nature, in particular oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate.<br>
By way of illustration of basic compounds of an alkaline-earth metal which can be used according to the present invention, mention will be made of CaO, MgO, Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2, CaC03 and mixtures of two or more<br><br>
of the basic compounds of an alkaline-earth metal listed above. Preferably, Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)3 or MgO will be used.<br>
By way of illustration of halide of an alkaline-earth metal which can be used according to the present invention, mention will be made of CaCl2 and MgCl2. Preferably, CaCl2 will be used.<br>
According to the present invention, the sulphate ions may be provided by compounds such as H2S04, Na2S04, CaS04, CaS04«2H20 or MgS04. Preferably, H2S04, Na2S04 and Ca2S04«2H20 (gypsum) will be used.<br>
According to the present invention, the reactants may be introduced in different orders and it has been demonstrated that the order of introduction of the reactants had no consequence on the quality of the PACSs obtained according to the present invention.<br>
Thus, in particular, the basic solution of aluminium(II) chloride may be placed in contact simultaneously with the basic compound of an alkali metal and the sulphate, followed by introduction into the reaction medium thus obtained of the basic compound of an alkaline-earth metal (in suspension or in the form of a powder), or inversely, the solution may be placed in contact with the basic compound of an alkaline-earth metal, followed by simultaneous introduction of the basic compound of an alkali metal and the sulphate.<br>
According to another variant, the basic<br><br>
solution of aluminium(II) chloride and CaCl, may be placed in contact, followed by simultaneous introduction into the reaction medium thus obtained of the basic compound of an alkali metal and the sulphate.<br>
The prior processes made it possible to improve one or more characteristics to the detriment of one or more other characteristics.<br>
According to the present invention, the PACSs are obtained according to an improved, so-called "clean" process, that is to say a process which produces virtually no by-products such as gypsum. In addition, the process according to the present invention leads to PACSs of high basicity having simultaneous characteristics of stability on storage, of elimination of the turbidity and of residual content of aluminium in the treated waters.<br>
The PACSs according to the present invention may be used in many fields such as, for example, for treating drinking water, aqueous effluents and in the paper industry. Preferably, the PACSs of the present invention may advantageously be used for treating drinking water.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the invention.<br>
Example 1: (in accordance with the invention) 500 g of a basic aluminium polychloride are introduced into a 2-litre reactor. This polychloride contains 11.18% aluminium based on Al203, 21.61% chloride and possesses<br><br>
a basicity of 42.9%. Its empirical formula is: A1(0H)1.„C11(71.<br>
19.2 g of lime Ca(OH)2 are then added to the reactor containing the polychloride maintained at 50°C. The addition time is 45 minutes with Rushton-type stirring adjusted to 800 rev/min.<br>
A basic solution of sodium carbonate and sodium sulphate is prepared according to the following procedure:<br>

This basic solution preheated to 60°C is added, with vigorous turbulence, to the reactor containing the polychloride maintained at 60°C, over 20 minutes.<br>
19.2 g of Ca(OH)2 are added to the reactor containing the polychloride and the basic solution maintained at 60°C. The addition time is 45 minutes with Rushton-type stirring adjusted to 800 rev/min.<br><br>
At the end of the calcium-basification, the stirring speed is reduced to 200 revolutions/minute.<br>

of water from the river Seine, stirred at<br>
100 revolutions/minute,<br>
-	preparation of solutions of the PACS samples to be<br>
tested and of the reference product, by approximately<br>
one-hundredfold dilution of the products obtained in<br>
demineralized water, followed by leaving the solutions<br>
to stand for 1 hour, i.e. 2.94 g of reference PACS<br>
giving a titre of 8.5% A1203 introduced into the 250 ml<br>
flask made up with water, the solutions are stable upon<br>
dilution for at least 2 hours,<br>

syringes (solutions diluted one-hundredfold, giving a<br>
titre of 1 g/1 of A1203),<br>
-	increasing the stirring speed of the flocculator to<br><br>
160 revolutions/minute,<br>
-	injecting the products, i.e. 3 mg based on A1303 per litre of Seine water, into the "Jar-Test" flasks,<br>
