				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising carvedilol for treatment of cancer. More particularly the invention relates to novel carvedilol derivatives and their use in pharmaceutical compositions for treatment of lung, prostrate, ovarian, colon, pancreatic, breast, laryngeal and other forms of cancer. The invention also provides method for the preparation of these novel carvedilol derivatives and treatment of cancer using these derivatives.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Carvedilol is a nonselective -adrenergic blocking agent with 1 -blocking activity. (±)-l-(carbazol-4-yloxy)-3-[(2-(o-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl]amino]-2-propanol, better known as 'carvedilol1 has the structural formula shown in figure 1. It is a racemic mixture. Carvedilol is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 406.5, represented by the molecular formula C24Hj6N2O4 Carvedilol is a racemic mixture in which the S(-) enantiomer exhibits nonselective B-adrenoreceptor blocking activity and both R(+) and S (-) enantiomers at equal potency exhibit adrenergic blocking activity. Carvedilol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Fig. 1<br>
Carvedilol is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration due to a significant degree of first-pass metabolism. Following oral administration, the apparent mean terminal elimination half-life of carvedilol generally ranges from 7 to 10 hours. Carvedilol is extensively metabolized. Carvedilol is metabolized primarily by aromatic<br><br>
ring oxidation and glucuronidation. The oxidative metabolites are further metabolized by conjugation via glucuronidation and sulfation. The metabolites of carvedilol are excreted primarily via the bile into the feces. Demethylation and hydroxylation at the phenol ring produce three active metabolites with B-receptor blocking activity. Based on preclinical studies, the 4'-hydroxyphenyl metabolite is approximately 13 times more potent than carvedilol for 6-blockade. Compared to carvedilol, the three active metabolites exhibit weak vasodilating activity.<br>
Carvedilol is indicated for the treatment of mild or moderate (NYHA class II or III) heart failure of ischemic or cardiomyopathic origin, in conjunction with digitalis, diuretics, and ACE inhibitor, to reduce the progression of disease as evidenced by cardiovascular death, cardiovascular hospitalization, or the need to adjust other heart failure medications. Carvedilol may be used in patients unable to tolerate an ACE inhibitor. Carvedilol may be used in patients who are or are not receiving digitalis, hydralazine or nitrate therapy. Carvedilol is also indicated for the management of essential hypertension. It can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics.<br>
Carvedilol, an antihypertensive drug with activity on adrenoceptors as well as on calcium channel activity. Use of carvedilol in compositions for treatment of congestive heart failure is disclosed in US Patents 4,503,067 and 5,902,82. US Patent 4369326 discloses carbazolylmethane compounds useful as pressure sensitive or heat recording material. Also carvedilol has been explored for treatment of sexual impotence (US Patent 5,399,581). However, there is no report till date of the use of carvedilol or its derivatives for treatment of cancer.<br>
Accordingly, the Applicants undertook a study to investigate the use of carvedilol for treatment of cancer. To their surprise, the Applicants found that carvedilol caused different radio-protective results depending on the dosage and cell-line used.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the main object of the invention is to provide novel carvedilol derivatives and a method for preparation of the said derivatives.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions and method for treating various types of cancer in patients using carvedilol derivatives.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel carvedilol derivatives and pharmaceutical compositions containing such derivatives and useful in the treatment of cancer. In particular, the invention provides novel method for treating, inhibiting and/or preventing tumor or cancer growth, more particularly treating leukemia, lymphomas, lung, prostate, ovarian, melanoma, colon, pancreatic, oral, breast and laryngeal cancer.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides novel carvedilol derivatives synthesized by effecting modifications in the carvedilol ring. Such modifications have resulted in the development of acyl, Benzoyl, Sulphonamide, oxo, oximino, amino, O-mesylate, phenyl hydrazino, Hydroxyethyl, N-Benzylidene and benzene sulphonate derivatives. Such novel carbazol derivatives are represented by the general formula shown in figure 1 hereunder:<br><br>

These compounds are also represented in the Table shown herebelow:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The method for the preparation of the above compounds are illustrated in the examples hereunder. The procedures are either used alone or in combination to produce the derivatives of the present invention.<br>
The Applicants have tested the novel carvedilol derivatives in various cell lines for their cytotoxic activity and have found to their surprise, that these compounds can effectively be used for inhibition of tumors and for treatment of cancer. Such indications exhibited by these carvidelol derivatives are surprising as carvedilol is generally known to act as an anti-hypertensive drug and cytotoxic activity is not expected.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing an effective amount of the compounds of the invention as described hereinabove may be prepared according to methods known in the art. By "effective amount", the applicants intend an amount that will produce tumor inhibiting effects or anti-cancer effects without causing undue harmful side effects. The pharmaceutical compositions may provide from about 10 mg to 1000 mg of carvidelol or<br><br>
its derivatives as discussed in this invention, per unit dose. The actual dosage for humans and animals will vary depending upon the body weight of the subject, stage of affliction etc. The composition may be administered either alone or as a mixture with other therapeutic agents. These compositions exhibit synergistic effect, which is unexpected and surprising.<br>
The compositions may be formulated in various physical forms such as tablets, capsules, solutions, injectibles, lozenges, powders, aqueous or oily suspensions, syrups, elixirs, implants or aqueous solutions etc.<br>
As said earlier, the compositions containing carvidelol or carvidelol derivatives of the invention as active ingredients, may be formulated as tablets, if intended for oral use, or lyophilized powders for parenteral administration. The powders may be reconstituted by adding suitable diluents or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers prior to use.<br>
Tablets containing the compounds of the invention as active ingredient, alongwith non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Such excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques.<br>
Compositions for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient comprises carvidelol or its derivatives as provided in this invention, are mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be formulated as solution, when intended for systemic or parenteral administration. Systemic administration refers to oral, rectal, nasal, transdermal and parentral (i.e., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intravenous). The liquid formulation is generally buffered, isotonic or<br><br>
aqueous solution. Examples of suitable diluents are normal isotonic saline solution, standard 5% dextrose in water or buffered sodium or ammonium acetate solution. Such formulation suitable for parenteral administration, may also be used for oral administration or contained in a metered dose inhaler or nebulizer. It may be desirable to add excipients such as ethanol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy cellulose, acacia,<br>
polyethylene glycol, mannitol, sodium chloride or sodium citrate.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the invention may be prepared in a emulsion or syrup for oral administration. Pharmaceutically acceptable solid or liquid carriers may be added to enhance or stabilize the composition, or to facilitate preparation of the composition. Liquid carriers include syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, glycerin, saline, ethanol, and water. Solid carriers include starch, lactose, calcium sulfate dihydrate, terra alba, magnesium stearate or stearic acid, talc, pectin, acacia, agar or gelatin. The carrier may also include a sustained release material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone or with a wax. The amount of solid carrier varies but, preferably, will be between about 20 mg to about 1 g per dosage unit.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are made following the conventional techniques of pharmacy involving milling, mixing, granulating, and compressing, when necessary, for tablet forms: or milling, mixing and filling for hard gelatin capsule forms. When a liquid carrier is used, the preparation will be in the form of a syrup, elixir, emulsion or an aqueous or non-aqueous suspension. Such a liquid formulation may be administered directly or filled into a soft gelatin capsule.<br>
The compositions may contain additives selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations.<br>
The applicants have investigated as to whether carvedilol interacts with the cytotoxicity induced by irradiation in vitro as well as in vivo. A daily injection of carvedilol in clinically relevant concentrations (3 mg/kg subcutaneously), 4 days before and 3 days<br><br>
after a single radiation dose of 20 Gy significantly decreased the inflammatory reaction in the rat lung, evaluated as number of inflammatory cells in the peri vascular area. The density of mast cells was also slightly reduced. In vitro studies revealed that carvedilol caused different radio-protective effects, dependent on dose (1-7 Gy) used and cell line studied. The effects were especially pronounced in a malignant mesothelioma cell line (P-31), and somewhat less evident in a prostatic carcinoma cell line (PC-3). No significant effect was seen in a highly radiosensitive small cell lung cancer cell line (U-1690). Thus, carvedilol may under some circumstances interact with radiation-induced tissue reactions, most probably by a direct interaction at the cellular level. The specific explanation to the differences in sensitivity to carvedilol remains to be evaluated, but the known antioxidative properties and/or scavenging of free radicals of carvedilol may be a plausible mechanism of action. Secondary induced alterations in inflammatory response may also be considered. It is suggested that a potential interaction between drugs such as carvedilol and irradiation should be considered for clinical practice.<br>
Acquired resistance to chemotherapy is a major problem during cancer treatment. One mechanism for drug resistance is overexpression of the MDR1 (multidrug resistance) gene encoding for the transmembrane efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The calcium channel blocker verapamil has been shown to reverse cellular drug resistance by inhibiting P-gp drug efflux. This study evaluated whether the new antihypertensive drug carvedilol influenced doxorubicin (Dox) cytotoxicity and P-gp activity in a P-gp-expressing cell line compared to a non-expressing subline. Verapamil (10 micromol/L), and even more markedly, carvedilol (10 micromol/L) increased cellular uptake of P-gp-transported calcein of a P-gp-expressing breast cancer cell line (Hs578T-Dox). In the subline (Hs578T) not expressing P-gp, no effects of carvedilol or verapamil on calcein uptake were seen. Carvedilol and verapamil (10 micromol/L) reduced the LD50 (dose which results in the death of half the number of cells) of the Hs578T-Dox subline from 200 mg/L to approx. 10 mg/L Dox, whereas the LD50 of the Hs578T subline was only marginally affected. Carvedilol (10 micromol/L) reduced P-gp activity approximately twice as effectively as verapamil at an equimolar concentration. Carvedilol did not affect pyrogallol cytotoxicity and pyrogallol was without effect on calcein accumulation of the<br><br>
Hs578T-Dox cell line, indicating the lack of antioxidative properties affecting P-gp activity and associated toxicity of the drug. The results suggest that carvedilol has the clinical potential to reverse tumour MDR involving the efflux protein P-gp.<br>
The present invention also provides method for the treatment of cancer, said method comprising the steps of administering to the subject an effective amount of carvedilol or derivatives thereof as discussed hereinabove and shown in figures 1 and 2 hereinabove. The nature of pharmaceutical composition employed will, of course, depend on the desired route of administration.. The patient of the invention can be human, mammal or other animal.<br>
The dosage in human beings for treatment of cancer includes the combination of the compounds of the invention with conventional agents. The usual dosage is about 3 to 30 µg as a single dose or divided doses. The preferred and actual dosage of the compounds used in the composition of the invention will be according to the specific compositions formulated, mode of administration, the site of administration and the patients being treated.<br>
No unexpected or toxic effects were observed when the compounds of the invention were tested for treatment of cancer or inhibition of tumors.<br>
The invention is further described in detail by the following examples which are given for illustration of the invention and not intended to limit the scope thereof in any manner:<br>
Examples: A:. Preparation of carvedilol derivatives<br>
In the following examples, the substarte used was carvidelol.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of 3—o-acyl derivatives<br>
Method 1:   Substrate in organic base is treated with suitable anhydride (saturated or<br>
unsaturated) at room temperature for approximately 4-16 hours. Examples of anhydrides<br>
that can be used in this process are represented by general formula (RCH2CO2)O wherein<br>
R=H, CH3, C2H5, etc. The reaction was worked by evaporation of the reaction mixture,<br><br>
addition of water and extraction with an organic solvent. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, evaporated and residue crystallized to yield the corresponding pure 3-0 acyl derivatives respectively. Examples of organic bases that can be used in this method are TEA, pyrdine and BMP A.<br>
Method II: Substrate in halogenated organic solvent was treated with suitable acyl chloride as in Method 1. The reaction was worked up as described in Method I to yield the corresponding 3-o-acyl derivatives in the pure form. Examples of acyl chlorides that can be used are R(CH2 )„ COCI wherein R=H, Cl, BH, I or F and n=l to 16 or RCH2 (CH)n XCOCI wherein R=H, X=OH, OCOCH3 and n=l. The halogenated solvent may be selected from CC14 CH2 C12, C6 H5CH3 or the like.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of 3-oxo-derivatives.<br>
The substrate was dissolved in an organic solvent and conventional oxidizing agent was added under normal reaction conditions. The reaction was worked up as described in Method I to yield the corresponding 3-oxo derivatives in the pure form.<br>
Example of oxidizing agents that can be used are CrO3/Py; CrO3/H2SO4; CrO3./AcOH or the like. The normal reaction condition is stirring the substrate with oxidizing agent at from 0°C to room temperature for a few hours. The organic solvent may be selected from acetone, CH2C12, AcOH, mixtures thereof or the like.<br>
Example 3: Preparation of 2, 20,29- tribro mo 3-oxo derivative<br>
A -3-oxo betulinic acid derivative prepared according to the process of Example 3 was dissolved in halogenated organic solvent. To this was added dropwise liquid bromine dissolved in the same solvent and the temperature was maintained between 0-10°C. The reaction mixture was brought to room temperature and stirred for a few hours. The reaction was worked up as described in Method I of Example 2. The organic layer was washed with 5-10% aqueous alkaline solution and evaporated. The crystallized product yielded pure 2, 20, 29-tribromo-3-oxo derivatives. Examples of halogenated solvents that<br><br>
can be used are CCl4,CH2Cl2, CHCl3 and the like; Examples of aqueous alkaline solution that can be used are bicarbonate or carbonate of an alkali metal in water, and the like.<br>
Example 4: Preparation of 3-oximino derivative<br>
A 3-oxo derivative of carvidelol is mixed in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and the like. To this was added alkyl hydroxylamine, phenyl hydroxylamine or benzyl hydroxylamine or its substituted derivatives and sodium acetate. The mixture was refluxed for a few hours.
