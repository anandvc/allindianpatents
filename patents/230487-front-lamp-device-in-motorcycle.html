[0026]<br>
Left and right turn signal lamps 45L, 45R are disposed on the left and right sides, respectively, of the headlight 38, while cutout portions 46L and 46R, which are open forward and sideways, are formed in both side portions of the front cover half 16 in the handle cover 15. The left and right turn signal lamps 45L, 45R are fitted in the cutout portions 46L and 46R, respectively, and are thereby secured to the front cover half 16 of the handle cover 15. [0027]<br>
Referring also to Figs. 6 and 7, the left turn signal lamp 45L includes a housing 47L of a synthetic resin, which is mounted to the front cover half 16 removably, a bulb 48L attached to the housing 47L, and a lens 49L attached to the housing 47L so as to cover the bulb 48L from the front side. A reflector 50 for reflecting light emitted from the bulb 49L is formed integrally with an inner surface of the housing 47L. [0028]<br>
The housing 47L is formed in a bowl shape which can radiate the light reflected by the reflector 50 forward, sideways, and downward. An appearance cover portion 51L contiguous to an outer surface of the handle cover 15 is formed integrally with the housing 47L,<br><br>
[0029]<br>
at<br>
The appearance cover portion 51L is formed integrally with the housing 47L so as to constitute least a part of a left-end wall of the handle cover 15, i.e., a nearly half of a left-end wall of the handle cover 15 in this embodiment. That is, the appearance cover portion 51L is formed contiguously to a left-end wall portion 17a of the rear cover half 17.  Semicircular recesses 53 and 54 for conjointly forming a circular hole 52 are formed in the left-end wall portion 17a and the appearance cover portion 51L, respectively. The circular hole 52 permits insertion therethrough of a part of the handle portion lla of the steering handle 11 located near the grip 12. [0030]<br>
The housing 4 7L is integrally provided with a lower mounting plate portion 55 extending backward contiguously to a lower portion of the housing 47L, an upper mounting plate portion 56 projecting upward from an upper portion of the housing 47L, a side mounting plate portion 57 contiguous to a side wall of the housing 47L on the side opposite to the appearance cover portion 51L. A nut 58 is secured to the lower mounting plate portion 55, and a screw 59 is inserted through the lower portion of the cover half<br><br>
16 into threaded engagement with the nut 58. A mounting boss portion 60 abutted against the upper mounting plate portion 56 is integrally projected from an inner surface of the front cover half 16, and a screw 61 is inserted through the upper mounting plate portion 56 into engagement with the mounting boss portion 60. Further, a mounting boss portion 62 abutted against the side mounting plate portion 57 is integrally projected from the inner surface of the front cover half 16, and a screw 63 is inserted through the side mounting plate portion 57 into engagement with the mounting boss portion 62. [0031]<br>
Referring also to Fig. 8, the right turn signal lamp 45R includes a housing 47R, a bulb 48R, and a lens 49R. The housing 47R is of a synthetic resin and is mounted to the front cover half 16 removably. The bulb 4 8R is (see Fig. 1) mounted to the housing 46R.  The lens 49R is mounted to the housing 4 7R so as to cover the bulb 4 8R from the front side. The right turn signal lamp 45R is constructed substantially symmetric right and left with respect to the left turn signal lamp 45L and is mounted to the right front cover half 16 with use of a similar mounting structure. [0032]<br><br>
A different point of the right turn signal lamp 45R from the left turn signal lamp 45L lies in that a recess 64 is formed in an appearance cover portion 51R.  The appearance cover portion 51R is integral with the housing 47R contiguously to the outer surface of the handle cover 15 and constituting at least a part (a substantially half in this embodiment) of the right end wall of the handle cover 15. The recess 64 is for disposing the brake lever 14 so as to permit operation of the brake lever. A semicircular recess 65 for insertion therein of a substantially rear half of the handle portion lla is formed in a right-end wall portion 17b of the rear cover half 17. [0033]<br>
At least the outer surface of the handle cover 15 is coated, while in the left and right turn signal lamps 45L, 45R, the housings 47L and 47R, including the appearance cover portions 51L and 51R, are formed using a colored resin. [0034]<br>
A description will now be given about the operation of this embodiment. The housings 47L and 47R of the left and right turn signal lamps 45L, 45R disposed left and right of the handle cover 15 are mounted to the handle cover 15 removably. Besides, the appearance cover portions<br><br>
51L and 51R contiguous to the outer surface of the handle cover 15 are formed integrally with the housings 47L and 47R, respectively. [0035]<br>
Thus, the turn signal lamps 45L and 45R mounted on both left and right sides of the handle cover 15 removably can be utilized effectively.  In the event both left and right end portions of the handle cover 15 are scratched for example, a mere replacement of the turn signal lamps 45L and 45R suffices without the need of replacing the whole of the handle cover 15, whereby the maintenance cost can be reduced. [0036]<br>
Moreover, the cutout portions 46L and 46R, which are open forward and sideways, are formed in both side portions of the handle cover 15 and the turn signal lamps 45L and 45R are secured to the handle cover 15 by being fitted in the cutout portions 46L and 46R. Therefore, it is possible to facilitate the operation for mounting and removing the turn signal lamps 45L and 45R relative to the handle cover 15. [0037]<br>
Since the appearance cover portions 51L and 51R are formed integrally with the housings 47L and 47R so as to<br><br>
constitute at least portions of both left and right end walls of the handle cover 15, at least portions of the both left and right end walls of the handle cover 15 are formed by the appearance cover portions 51L and 51R.  Consequently, the appearance cover portions 51L and 51R can be disposed effectively at positions where scratch or the like is apt to occur. [0038]<br>
Since at least the outer surface of the handle cover 15 is coated and the housings 47L and 47R including the appearance cover portions 51L and 51R are formed using a colored resin, even if the appearance cover portions 51L and 51R are scratched, it is possible to make the scratched portions less conspicuous. That is, replacement of the turn signals lamps 45L and 45R can be avoided as far as possible even in the event the appearance cover portions 51L and 51R are scratched. Consequently, it is possible to further decrease the maintenance cost. [0039]<br>
Further, since the reflectors 50 for reflecting light emitted from the bulbs 48L and 4 8R are formed integrally with the housings 47L and 47R of the turn signal lamps 45L and 45R, it is possible to decrease the number of parts used.<br><br>
[0040]<br>
Although an embodiment of the present invention has been described above, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment, but various design changes may be made without departing from the gist of the present invention described in the claims.
