				<td>The invention relates to a system for use with blister packing machines for the on-line detection of missing, broken and chipped tablets in a blister pack. In particular, the system of the invention identifies the defective packs and provide for on-line diversion and separation of defective packs from the good ones and/or rectifying the defective packing. The system is developed for used with any blister packing machine.<br>
In the conventional blister packing machine while there are devices using optical sensors, to detect missing tablets there is no known device to detect broken and chipped tablets. Also, with the known devices it was not possible to remove the defective tablets (missing &amp; broken) in a pack and replace them with good ones on line before sealing of the pack which resulted in wastage of packs making the system of blister packing complex and cost-extensive.<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a system for the on-line detection, of missing, broken and chipped tablets in blister packs produced by blister packing machines.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide an on-line system for detection of defective packs, removal of the. defective packs from the good ones and/or replacement/rectification of the defective packs on-line to thereby avoid wastage of packing and make the system of blister packing reliable and cost-effective.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to provide an on-line system for detection of defective packs and replacement/rectification of defective packing which would be simple and easy to operate.<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention there is provided a system for use with blister packing machines for the on-line<br><br>
detection of missing, broken and chipped tablets in a blister pack comprising :<br>
means for capturing images of filled blister packs ;<br>
means for processing the captured image for detection of any defective packing including any missing, broken or chipped tablets ;<br>
means for generating alarm signals as and when any said defective package is identified.<br>
In particular, the system comprises CCD camera to detect missing, broken and chipped tablets in a blister pack. The said camera is adapted to capture images of the blister packs after it is filled with tablets. The CCD camera can be of type frame scan or line scan, black and white or colour. Suitable illumination means is used for uniform illumination of the object (blister pack) under consideration. Light sources such as fluorescent tubes, compact fluorescent lamps, incandescent lamps, LED's, UV lamps, infrared lamps, or any kind of strobed lights can be used. Preferably a speed sensing system is used to synchronize the operation of the system with the speed of the machine such that the camera captures an image after it receives a pulse from the speed sensing device each time a filled pack is fully moved by the packing machine for viewing through the camera. The speed sensing device can be selected from optical, inductive hall effect or capacitive type sensor. A computer is used to process/scan the captured images for detection of any said defective pack including any missing, broken or chipped tablets.<br>
The alarm signals can comprise of alarm lights (visual indicator) and/or audio means to indicate identification of any defective pack.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect the system for use with blister packing machine comprising :<br><br>
means for capturing images of filled blister packs ;<br>
means for processing the captured image for detection of any defective packing including missing, broken or chipped tablets ;<br>
means for generating alarm signals as and when any said defective package is identified ; and<br>
means for removal of the defective package and/or rectifying the defect in the package.<br>
Preferably, said means for removal of defective package can comprise rejection flaps used to separate the defective packs from the good ones. Importantly, the system can also have means for rectifying the defective pack on-line to thereby save wastage of defective packs.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to an exemplary embodiment of the system as illustrated in the accompanying figure Fig 1 wherein a schematic illustration of the system of the on-line system used with blister packing machines in accordance with the present invention is provided.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 the system utilizes the CCD camera (4) two light sources (2) which are precisely positioned and arranged so as to uniformly illuminate the object under consideration. The camera (4) is placed perpendicular or at a small angle therein, to the direction of movement of the blister (3). The light source/sources (2) are placed along the axis of the blister or at a small angle therein, and arranged linearly in the form of a matrix, so as to uniformly illuminate the object and avoid glares in the images. With this arrangement the camera is not only able to get a clear<br><br>
picture of the object, but at the same time the defect in the material is significantly reflected in the captured image.<br>
A Personal Computer (PC) (5) with adequate processing power is used to process the captured image. The signals from the camera are routed to the PC through a frame grabber card which is accommodated within the PC itself. A speed sensing device (8) is used to sense and monitor the speed of the filled blister packs (3). The control unit (6) provides regulated power to the camera, and the light sources. It also provides signals to activate the ejector flaps (7) and the alarm lights 9, when ever the system detects a defective pack. The speed sensing device is also interfaced to the PC through this module. In order to prevent external disturbances from affecting the quality of images captured by the camera, the camera and the lights are fixed securely and housed in the hood (1). The hood (1) in turn is fixed with suitable clamps on to the machine in such a manner that the camera views the blister (3) after it has been filled with the tablets. The additional filling station (10) is placed after the hood (1) in the direction of motion of the blister.<br>
The functioning of the system of the invention illustrated under Fig. 1 is as follows :<br>
The camera (4) captures the image of the blister (3) after it has been filled with tablets. The captured image is transferred to the PC memory by the frame grabber. In order to synchronize the operation of the system with the speed of the machine the camera captures an image after it receives a pulse from the speed sensing device (8) each time a pack is fully moved. To achieve this the speed sensing device (8) is suitably secured to the machine (3) so that it outputs a pulse after a pack is moved by the machine. The captured image is first cleaned from noise by using certain filters. After which suitable image processing algorithms are used to detect a missing, broken or chipped tablets. On detection of any of the said defects the PC (9) triggers the alarm and at the appropriate time<br><br>
triggers the rejection flap (7) so as to divert the defective pack. Alternatively, the system on detection of a defect could trigger of a filling station (10) which in turn could insert a tablet in the missing pocket of the pack. However, in the case of a broken or chipped tablet the filling station should at first remove the defective tablet and then insert a good one in the pack.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above disclosed system of the invention to achieve on-line detection of missing, broken and chipped tablets in blister packing machines. Also, the system would provide for removal of defective packing from good ones and/or replacement/rectification of the defective packing and avoid wastage of the packing.<br>
The system of the invention comprises CCD camera to detect missing or broken or chipped tablets in a blister packing machine and providing for on line removal/diversion of defective packing from the good ones by a rejecter flap with or without on line replacement of defective packs with good ones, by a filling station located after the detection module in the direction of the motion of the blister. The system is simple to operate and would serve to make the manufacture of blister packing of tablets and like reliable and cost effective.<br><br><br><br>
