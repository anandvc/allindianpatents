				<td>OPTOELECTRONIC RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TEST SYSTEM<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] Rapid diagnostic test kits are currently available for testing for a wide variety of<br>
medical and environmental conditions. Commonly, such test kits employ an analyte-specific<br>
binding assay to detect or measure a specific environmentally or biologically relevant<br>
compound such as a hormone, a metabolite, a toxin, or a pathogen-derived antigen.<br>
[0002] A convenient structure for performing a binding assay is a "lateral flow" strip<br>
such as test strip 100 illustrated in Fig. 1. Test strip 100 includes several "zones" that are<br>
arranged along a flow path of a sample. In particular, test strip 100 includes a sample<br>
receiving zone 110, a labeling zone 120, a capture or detection zone 130, and an absorbent<br>
zone or sink 140. Zones 110,120,130, and 140, which can be attached to a common backing<br>
150, are generally made of a material such as chemically treated nitrocellulose that allows<br>
fluid flow by capillary action.<br>
[0003] An advantage of test strip 100 and of a lateral flow immunoassay generally is the<br>
ease of the testing procedure and the rapid availability of test results. In particular, a user<br>
simply applies a fluid sample such as blood, urine, or saliva to sample receiving zone 110.<br>
Capillary action then draws the liquid sample downstream into labeling zone 120, which<br>
contains a substance for indirect labeling of a target analyte. For medical testing, the labeling<br>
substances are generally immunoglobulin with attached dye molecules but alternatively may<br>
be a non-immunoglobulin labeled compound that specifically binds the target analyte.<br>
[0004] The sample flows from labeling zone 120 into capture zone 130 where the sample<br>
contacts a test region or stripe 132 containing an immobilized compound capable of<br><br>
specifically binding the labeled target analyte or a complex that the analyte and labeling<br>
substance form. As a specific example, analyte-specific immunoglobulins can be<br>
immobilized in capture zone 130. Labeled target analytes bind the immobilized<br>
immunoglobulins, so that test stripe 132 retains the labeled analytes. The presence of the<br>
labeled analyte in the sample generally results in a visually detectable coloring in test<br>
stripe 132 that appears within minutes of starting the test.<br>
[0005] A control stripe 134 in capture zone 130 is useful for indicating that a procedure<br>
has been performed. Control stripe 134 is downstream of test stripe 132 and operates to bind<br>
and retain the labeling substance. Visible coloring of control stripe 134 indicates the<br>
presence of the labeling substance resulting from the liquid sample flowing through capture<br>
zone 130. When the target analyte is not present in the sample, test stripe 132 shows no<br>
visible coloring, but the accumulation of the label in control stripe 134 indicates that the<br>
sample has flown through capture zone 130. Absorbent zone 140 then captures any excess<br>
sample.<br>
[0006] One problem with these immunoassay procedures is the difficulty in providing<br>
quantitative measurements. In particular, a quantitative measurement may require<br>
detennining the number of complexes bound in test stripe 132. Measuring equipment for<br>
such determinations can be expensive and is vulnerable to contamination since capture zone<br>
120, which contains the sample, is generally exposed for measurement. Further, the intensity<br>
of dyes used in the test typically degrade very rapidly (e.g., within minutes or hours) when<br>
exposed to light, so that quantitative measurements based on the intensity of color must<br>
somehow account for dye degradation. On the other hand, a home user of a single-use rapid<br>
diagnostic test kit may have difficulty interpreting a test result from the color or shade of test<br>
stripe 132, particularly since dye intensity within minutes.<br>
[0007] Another testing technology, which is generally performed in laboratories,<br>
simultaneously subjects a sample to a panel of tests. For this type of testing, portions of a<br>
sample can be applied to separate test solutions. Each test solution generally contains a<br>
labeled compound that specifically binds a target analyte associated with the test being<br>
performed. Conventionally, the tests are separate because the labeled compounds that bind<br>
different target analytes are typically difficult to distinguish if combined in the same solution.<br>
[0008] U.S. Pat. No. 6,630,307, entitled "Method of Detecting an Analyte in a Sample<br><br>
Using Semiconductor Nanocrystals as a Detectable Label," describes a process that labels<br>
binding compounds for different target analytes with different types of semiconductor<br>
nanocrystals or quantum dots. The different types of nanocrystals when exposed to a suitable<br>
wavelength of light fluoresce to produce light of different wavelengths. Accordingly, binding<br>
compounds labeled with different combinations of quantum dots can be distinguished by<br>
spectral analysis of the fluorescent light emitted from the quantum dots.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0009] In accordance with an aspect of the invention, an optoelectronic rapid diagnostic<br>
test system can include a light source such as a light emitting diode (LED) or a laser diode<br>
that illuminates a test structure such as a test strip. The test structure preferably uses a<br>
persistent fluorescent substance such as a semiconductor nanocrystal or a quantum dot in a<br>
labeling substance for a target analyte. The fluorescent substance when bound to the target<br>
analyte can be immobilized at a test stripe or region and exposed to light from the light<br>
source. The persistent fluorescent substance then fluoresces to emit light of a characteristic<br>
wavelength. An electronic photodetector or an imaging device can then detect the light<br>
emitted from the test stripe at the characteristic wavelength and generate an electric signal<br>
indicating a test result. The test results can be readily quantified since the intensity of the<br>
emitted light does not have the rapid time dependence of dyes that are conventionally<br>
employed in rapid test systems.<br>
[0010] The optoelectronic portion of the diagnostic test kit can be inexpensively<br>
manufactured for disposable or single-use applications. The electronic nature of the result<br>
signal also lends itself to processing and transmission using many electronic systems. For<br>
example, control logic in a single-use test module can activate a results indicator (e.g., an<br>
external LED or alphanumeric LCD) to unambiguously indicate the test result. Alternatively,<br>
a single-use test module can include an interface for connection to reusable data processing<br>
equipment. The electronic interface avoids the need for reusable equipment to directly<br>
measure or be exposed to materials containing the target analyte and thereby reduces the<br>
chance for cross contamination during a sequence of tests.<br>
[0011] One specific embodiment of the invention is a rapid diagnostic test system<br>
including a photodetector and a light source. The light source illuminates a medium<br><br>
containing a sample, and the photodetector measures light from a test area of the medium<br>
when the medium is illuminated.<br>
[0012] In one variation of this embodiment of the invention, the medium can be a lateral-<br>
flow strip for performing a binding assay and includes a labeling substance that binds a<br>
fluorescent structure such as a semiconductor nanocrystal or a quantum dot to a target<br>
analyte. The photodetector then measures light having a frequency characteristic of<br>
fluorescent light resulting from illuminating the fluorescent structure.<br>
[0013] The rapid diagnostic test system can further include a second photodetector, and<br>
an optical system positioned to receive light from the test area and direct light to the two<br>
photodetectors. In particular, the optical system, which can be implemented using diffractive<br>
elements or thin-film color filters, filters or directs different colors of light for separate<br>
measurement. For example, the optical system can separate the light having a first frequency<br>
from light having a second frequency, direct the light have the first frequency for<br>
measurement by the first photodetector, and direct the light have the second frequency for<br>
measurement by the second photodetector. With the color separation or filtering, the medium<br>
can include a first labeling substance that binds a first fluorescent structure to a first target<br>
analyte and a second labeling substance that binds a second fluorescent structure to a second<br>
target analyte. When illuminated, the first fluorescent structure emits light having the first<br>
frequency, which the first photodetector measures; and the second fluorescent structure emits<br>
light having the second frequency, which the second photodetector measures.<br>
[0014] The photodetector(s) and the medium can be contained in a single-use module that<br>
is either a stand-alone device or that requires connection to a reusable module to complete a<br>
test. For example, the reusable module may have a receptacle into which the single-use<br>
module is inserted for communication of electrical and/or optical signals.<br>
[0015] Another specific embodiment of the invention is a process for rapid diagnostic<br>
testing. The test process generally includes: applying a sample to a medium in a single-use<br>
module that includes a photodetector; illuminating at least a portion of the medium; and<br>
generating an electrical test result signal from the photodetector. The electrical test result<br>
signal can be used in a variety of ways to indicate the test result to a user. For example, one<br>
variation of the process includes activating a display such as an alphanumeric display or an<br>
LED on the single-use module in response to the electrical test result signal. An alternative<br><br>
variation of the process includes outputting the electrical test signal from the single-use<br>
module to a reusable module. The reusable module can then implement a user interface that<br>
informs a user of the test result.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024] In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a rapid diagnostic test system<br>
employs a disposable optoelectronic device that generates an electronic test result signal. The<br>
optoelectronic device preferably contains or is used with a test strip or test structure using a<br>
labeling substance that binds a persistent fluorescent substance such as a quantum dot to the<br>
target analyte. The test system can include a light source that illuminates a test area with<br>
light of the proper wavelength to cause fluorescence and a photodetector such as a<br><br>
photodiode that measures the resulting fluorescent light to detect the target analyte.<br>
[0025] Fig. 2A shows a cross-section of a test system 200 in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the invention where an optoelectronic device reads a test result. In various<br>
embodiments of the invention, system 200 can test for any desired medical or environmental<br>
condition or substance including but not limited to glucose, pregnancy, infectious diseases,<br>
cholesterol, cardiac markers, signs of drug abuse, chemical contaminants, or biotoxins.<br>
System 200 includes a case 210, a test strip 220, and a circuit 240 including a light source<br>
250, a battery 252, a control unit 254, and photodetectors 256 and 258.<br>
[0026] Case 210 can be made of plastic or other material suitable for safely containing<br>
the liquid sample being analyzed. In the illustrated embodiment, case 210 has an opening<br>
through which a portion of test strip 220 extends for application of the sample to a sample<br>
receiving zone 222 of test strip 220. Alternatively, test strip 220 can be enclosed in case 210,<br>
and application of the sample to test strip 220 is through an opening in case 210.<br>
[0027] Test strip 220 can be substantially identical to a conventional test strip such as test<br>
strip 100 described above in regard to Fig. 1, but in test strip 220, the substance for labeling<br>
the target analyte preferably includes a quantum dot or a similar structure that fluoresces at a<br>
constant intensity when exposed to light of the proper wavelength. For a test, a user applies a<br>
sample to sample receiving zone 222 of test strip 220. The sample flows from receiving zone<br>
222 into a labeling zone 224 inside case 210. The labeling substance binds the quantum dot<br>
or other persistent fluorescent structure to the target analyte. The sample including the<br>
labeling substance then enters a capture or detection zone that includes a test stripe 226 and a<br>
control stripe 228. Test stripe 226 is a region containing an immobilized substance selected<br>
to bind and retain the labeled complex containing the target analyte and the quantum dot.<br>
Control stripe 228 is a region containing an immobilized substance selected to bind to and<br>
retain to the labeling substance.<br>
[0028] Light source 250 in circuit 240 illuminates test stripe 226 and control stripe 228<br>
during testing. Light source 250 is preferably a light emitting diode (LED) or a laser diode<br>
that emits light of a frequency that causes fluorescence of any quantum dots in test stripe 226<br>
or control stripe 228. Generally, the quantum dots fluoresce under a high frequency (or short<br>
wavelength) light, e.g., blue to ultraviolet light, and the fluorescent light has a lower<br>
frequency (or a longer wavelength) than the light from light source 250.<br><br>
[0029] Photodetectors 256 and 258 are in the respective paths of light emitted from test<br>
stripe 226 and control stripe 228 and measure the fluorescent light from the respective stripes<br>
226 and 228. A baffle or other light directing structure (not shown) can be used to direct<br>
light from test stripe 226 to photodetector 256 and light from control strip 228 to<br>
photodetector 258. In the embodiment of Fig. 2A, photodetectors 256 and 258 have<br>
respective color filters 257 and 259 that transmit light of the frequency associated with the<br>
selected fluorescent light but blocks other frequencies, especially the frequency of light<br>
emitted from light source 250. Additionally, the labeling substance can include two types of<br>
quantum dots. One of the types of quantum dots emits a first wavelength of light and is<br>
attached to a substance that binds to the target analyte and to test stripe 226. The other type<br>
of quantum dot emits light of a second wavelength and binds to control stripe 228. Color<br>
filters 257 and 259 can then be designed so that photodetector 256 measures fluorescent light<br>
from the type of quantum dot that test stripe 226 traps when the target analyte is present<br>
while photodetector 258 measures fluorescent light from the type of quantum dot that control<br>
strip 228 traps.<br>
[0030] Quantum dots provide fluorescent light at an intensity that is consistent for long<br>
periods of time, instead of rapidly degrading in the way that the intensity of conventional test<br>
dyes degrade when exposed to light. As a result, the intensity measurements from detectors<br>
256 and 258, which indicate the amount of fluorescent light, are proportional to the number<br>
of quantum dots in the respective stripes 226 and 228 and are not subject to rapid changes<br>
with time. These intensity measurements thus provide a quantitative indication of the<br>
concentration of the target analyte.<br>
[0031] Control unit 254, which can be a standard microcontroller or microprocessor with<br>
an analog-to-digital converter, receives electrical signals from detectors 256 and 258. The<br>
electric signals indicate the measured intensities from stripes 226 and 228, and control unit<br>
254 processes the electrical test signals and then operates an output system as required to<br>
indicate test results. In Fig. 2A, for example, the output system includes LED lights 261 and<br>
263. Control unit 254 can activate one light 261 when the fluorescent light from the test<br>
stripe 226 is above a threshold level marking the presence of the target analyte in test stripe<br>
226. Control unit 254 can activate the other light 262 when the intensity of fluorescent light<br>
from test stripe 226 is below the threshold level but the intensity that photodetector 258<br>
measures from control stripe 228 is above a threshold level therefore indicating that the<br><br>
sample has passed through test stripe 226. A system with three or more LEDs or particular<br>
patterns of flashing of one or more LEDs can similarly indicate other test results (e.g., an<br>
inconclusive test) or a test status (e.g., to indicate a test in progress).<br>
[0032] Fig. 2B illustrates a test system 200B that is similar to test system 200 but<br>
includes an alphanumeric display 264 for output of test results. A two or three character<br>
LCD array, for example, could provide numeric output based on the measured intensity of<br>
fluorescent light from test stripe 226. Display 264 may be used in conjunction with LEDs<br>
such as illustrated in Fig. 2A or other output systems.<br>
[0033] Fig. 2C illustrates a test system 200C using yet another test result output<br>
technique. In particular, test system 200C outputs an electric signal via external terminals<br>
266 to indicate the test result. As described further below, test system 200C can thus provide<br>
the electric test result signal to an electronic device (not shown) that can process, convert, or<br>
transmit the test result signal. An advantage of test system 200C is that circuit components<br>
such as battery 252 can be removed from circuit 240 to reduce the cost of test system 200C,<br>
and power can be supplied to circuit 240 through external terminals 266.<br>
[0034] Fig. 2D illustrates a test system 200D in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
invention that employs an imaging system 255 for detection of fluorescent light. Imaging<br>
system 255 can include a two-dimensional CCD or CMOS imaging array or similar<br>
optoelectronic imager capable of generating an electronic representation of an image (e.g., an<br>
array of pixel values representing a captured image or frame). Control unit 254 can analyze<br>
digital images from imaging system 255 to determine the intensity and color of light emitted<br>
from stripes 226 and 228. Test results can then be output based on the analysis of the image.<br>
[0035] Some advantages of test systems 200, 200B, 200C, and 200D include the ease<br>
with which a user receives the test result and the consistency and accuracy of the test results.<br>
LED lights 261 and 262 and alphanumeric displays provide results that a user can easily read.<br>
In contrast, a conventional rapid diagnostic test relying on a dye to indicate a test result may<br>
require that a user distinguish a shade or intensity in a test stripe. This interpretation may be<br>
subject to user judgment errors and to dyes that fade within minutes after exposure to light.<br>
In contrast, the fluorescence from quantum dots does not fade rapidly with time, and circuit<br>
240 produces a non-subjective and/or quantitative interpretation of the intensity of the<br>
fluorescent light.<br><br>
[0036] Another advantage of test systems employing quantum dots is the ability to test<br>
for several analytes in the same test stripe. Fig. 3, for example, shows a portion of a test<br>
system 300 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention that tests for the presence of<br>
multiple target analytes in a sample. Test system 300 includes a test strip 320, an<br>
optoelectronic circuit 340, and an intervening optical system 330.<br>
[0037] Test strip 320 can be substantially identical to test strip 220, which is described<br>
above, but test strip 320 includes multiple labeling substances corresponding to different<br>
target analytes. Each labeling substance binds a corresponding type of quantum dot to a<br>
corresponding target analyte. The quantum dots for different labeling substances preferably<br>
produce fluorescent light having different characteristic wavelengths (e.g., 525, 595, and 655<br>
nm). Suitable quantum dots having different fluorescent frequencies and biological coatings<br>
suitable for binding to analyte-specific immunoglobulins are commercially available from<br>
Quantum Dot, Inc. Test strip 320 includes a test stripe 326 that is treated to bind to and<br>
immobilize the different complexes including the target analytes and respective labeling<br>
substances. Testing for multiple analytes in the same test structure is particularly desirable<br>
for cholesterol or cardiac panel test system that measures multiple factors.<br>
[0038] Light source 250 illuminates test stripe 326 with light of a wavelength that causes<br>
all of the different quantum dots to fluoresce. Fluorescent light from test strip 326 will thus<br>
contain fluorescent light of different wavelengths if more than one of the target analytes are<br>
present in test strip 326. Optical system 330 separates the different wavelengths of light and<br>
focuses each of the different wavelengths on a corresponding photodetector 342, 343, or 344.<br>
Photodetectors 342, 343, and 344, which can further include appropriate color filters, thus<br>
provide separate electrical signals indicating the number of quantum dots of the respective<br>
types in test stripe 326 and therefore indicate concentrations of the respective target analytes.<br>
Control and output circuits (not shown) can then provide the test results to a user or a<br>
separate device as described above in regards to Figs. 2A, 2B, and 2C.<br>
[0039] Optical system 330 in Fig. 3 is an optical substrate providing diffractive focusing<br>
of the different wavelengths on different photodetectors 342, 343, and 344. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, optical system 330 includes an optical substrate of a material<br>
such as glass or plastic with opaque regions or surface discontinuities in a pattern that<br>
provides a desired separation or focusing of the different fluorescent wavelengths. However,<br>
diffractive optical elements such as optical system 330 can be fabricated inexpensively using<br><br>
other processes and structures.<br>
[0040] Fig. 4 shows a portion of test system 400 that is similar to test system 300 of<br>
Fig. 3, but test system 400 includes an optical system 430 formed from refractive lenses 431,<br>
432, 433, and 434 and thin-film color filters 436, 437, and 438 on prisms. In particular, lens<br>
431 receives and collimates fluorescent light emitted from test stripe 326 when light source<br>
250 illuminates quantum dots in test stripe 326. Color filter 436 is designed to transmit light<br>
of a frequency corresponding to the quantum dots that photodetector 342 measures and to<br>
reflect light of the frequency emitted by light source 250 or resulting from fluorescence of<br>
other types of quantum dots. Thin films that transmit light of the desired wavelength but<br>
reflect light of the other wavelengths can be designed and constructed from a stack of<br>
dielectric layers having thicknesses and refractive indices that achieve the desired<br>
characteristics. Alternatively, color filter 436 could include a diffractive index grating filter or<br>
a colored material. Lens 432 focuses the light transmitted through filter 436 onto the<br>
photosensitive area of detector 342, which can include a further color filter for additional<br>
selectivity to the desired color of light.<br>
[00411 Light reflected from filter 436 is incident on filter 437. Filter 437 is designed to<br>
reflect light of the wavelength corresponding to detector 343 and transmit the unwanted<br>
wavelengths. Lens 433 focuses the light reflected from filter 437 onto the photosensitive area<br>
of detector 343. Light transmitted through filter 437 is incident of filter 438, which is<br>
designed to reflect light of the wavelength corresponding to detector 344 and transmit the<br>
unwanted wavelengths. Lens 434 focuses the light reflected from filter film 438 onto the<br>
photosensitive area of detector 344.<br>
[0042] Optical systems 330 and 430 merely provide illustrative examples of an optical<br>
system using diffractive elements or thin-film filters for separating different wavelengths of<br>
light for measurements. Optical systems using other techniques (e.g., a chromatic prism)<br>
could also be employed to separate or filter the fluorescent light. The characteristics and<br>
geometry of such optical systems will generally depend on the number of different types of<br>
quantum dots used and the wavelengths of the fluorescent light.<br>
[0043] Fig. 5 illustrates a cutaway view of a test system 500 in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the invention. As illustrated, test system 500 includes a case 510 having a<br>
first slot at one end through which a test strip 520 extends and second slot at the opposite end<br><br>
through which a pull tab 530 extends. An optoelectronic circuit 540 including a light source<br>
250, batteries 252, and other desired circuit elements is enclosed inside case 510. An optical<br>
system (not shown) may additionally be included in case 510 for separation of optical signals<br>
or for focusing light onto one or more photodetectors in circuit 540.<br>
[0044] Test strip 520 can be substantially identical to test strip 220 or 320, which are<br>
described above for measuring one or more target analytes. Pull tab 530 acts as a switch and<br>
is initially between a battery 252 and a contact that connects battery 252 to provide power to<br>
circuit 540. For testing, a user applies a sample to the exposed portion of test strip 520 and<br>
pulls tab 530 out of case 510 to activate circuit 540. Circuit 540 then illuminates test strip<br>
520, measures the intensity of the resulting fluorescence from a target area of test strip 520,<br>
and generates an output signal.<br>
[0045] Fig. 6 illustrates a test system 600 in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
invention that encloses a test strip 520 inside a case 610. For sample introduction, case 610<br>
includes an opening 612 that funnels the sample onto a sample receiving zone of test strip<br>
520. An advantage of case 610 is an improved isolation of test strip 520 after introduction of<br>
the sample. A cap (not shown) can men be used to cover opening 612 to further improve<br>
isolation of the sample during handling of test system 600 after introduction of the sample.<br>
Fig. 6 also illustrates that test system 600 can include a pull tab 530 for beginning the<br>
electrical operation of test kit 600 and external LEDs 614 and 616 for indication of test status<br>
and results.<br>
[0046] Fig. 7A illustrates a test system 700 in accordance with yet another embodiment<br>
of the invention. Test system 700 includes a single-use module 710 and a reusable module<br>
720. Single-use module 710 includes a test strip 520 that is accessible through an opening<br>
712 in a case 714 in a manner similar to that described above in regard to test system 600 of<br>
Fig. 6. Single-use module 710 has an electrical interface including terminals 716 that can be<br>
plugged into receptacle 722 of reusable module 720. Reusable module 720 can then display a<br>
test result on an LCD display 724 or any other suitable user interface.<br>
[0047] Modules 710 and 720 collectively form an optoelectronic circuit capable of<br>
reading, analyzing, and providing test results. Generally, single-use module 710 includes one<br>
or more photodetectors and optical filters for the fluorescent light generated from test strip<br>
520. The light source is generally in single use module 710 but can alternatively be included<br><br>
in reusable module 720 when single-use module 710 has a window or other optical interface<br>
that can convey light of the desired frequency into module 710. Reusable module 720 can<br>
include the other circuit elements such as control circuits, batteries, and user interface<br>
electronics such as display 724. Through receptacle 722 and terminals 716, reusable module<br>
720 can thus supply power to single-use module 710 and can receive a test result signal. In<br>
one embodiment, the test result signal is the analog electric output signals directly from<br>
photodetectors in single-use module 710. Alternatively, single-use module 710 can include<br>
amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters, and/or other initial signal processing elements that<br>
provide a preprocessed signal to reusable module 720.<br>
[0048] An advantage of test system 700 is reduction in the cost of the disposable or<br>
single-use module 710. In particular, by including more circuit elements in reusable module<br>
720, the cost for repeated tests is decreased and the sophistication of the test result output can<br>
be increased (e.g., with alphanumeric or audible output instead of warning lights). This is<br>
particularly useful for tests that are repeated such as home testing of glucose levels or almost<br>
any diagnostic test performed at a doctor's office. Additionally, reusable module 720<br>
receives an electric signal from single-use module 710 and does not need to directly measure<br>
test strip 520 containing a sample. Reusable module 720 is thus not subject to sample<br>
contamination that might affect the results of subsequent tests.<br>
[0049] Fig. 7B illustrates a test system 750 illustrating using the single-use module 710<br>
with a more elaborate reusable module 730. In the illustrated embodiment, reusable module<br>
730 includes a receptacle 732, a display 734, a keypad 736, and a port 738. Receptacle 732<br>
can be substantially identical to receptacle 722 of Fig. 7 A and serves to accommodate single-<br>
use module 710 for transmission of power and signals between the two modules 730 and 710.<br>
Display 734, which can be an LCD display, a touch screen, or a similar device, is part of the<br>
user interface of reusable module 730 and can display any desired information including test<br>
results and control information. Keypad 736 provides a user interface for input of data or<br>
system control parameters. Port 738 provides a connection to other systems such as a<br>
computer or communication network and can be, for example, a jack for modem<br>
communications via telephone lines, USB or fire wire, or Ethernet standards to name a few.<br>
[0050] Whether a test system employs a relatively simple reusable module 720 as in<br>
system 700 of Fig. 7A or a more complex reusable module 730 as shown in Fig. 7B will<br>
generally depend on the type of testing performed and the results needed. For example, a<br><br>
commercial product might include one reusable module 720 with a set of six or more single-<br>
use modules 710 with the intent being that reusable module 720 is used only a limited<br>
number of times (e.g., just with the single use modules in the same package). In contrast,<br>
reusable module 730 may be intended for use in a large number of tests and sold separately<br>
from single-use modules 710. Further, single-use modules that perform different tests may<br>
be made compatible with a standardized reusable module 730, which would permit use of<br>
reusable module 730 in a doctor's office, for example, for control and output of many<br>
different types of tests.<br>
[0051] Although the invention has been described with reference to particular<br>
embodiments, the description is only an example of the invention's application and should not<br>
be taken as a limitation. Various adaptations and combinations of features of the<br>
embodiments disclosed are within the scope of the invention as defined by the following<br>
