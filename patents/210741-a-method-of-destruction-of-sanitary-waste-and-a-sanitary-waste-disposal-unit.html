' SANITARY WASTE DISPOSAL UNIT<br>
The present invention relates to a sanitary waste disposal unit.<br>
The current and planned regulations regarding "Duty of Care" to the safe treatment and disposal of all blood products relates directly to their treatment and disposal at sea. Furthermore, the sanitary waste can and does block drains, particularly small diameter systems which are increasingly being fitted. It can also fail to be destroyed in septic tanks, cause difficulties in sewage treatment plants and fail to sink when disposed of at sea.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provided a unit for disposing of sanitary waste.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a sanitary waste disposal unit comprising:<br>
•	a destruction chamber which is openably for reception of sanitary waste and closable for evacuation;<br>
•	means for evacuating air from the destruction chamber;<br>
•	means for heating the chamber when evacuated; and<br>
•	means for a controlled introduction of air into the heated evacuation chamber for combustion of sanitary waste heated in the chamber..<br>
In use:<br>
1.	the sanitary waste is introduced to the chamber;<br>
2.	the chamber is evacuated to remove sufficient oxygen to avoid combustion;<br>
3.	the chamber and the contained waste is heated to sterilize the waste;<br>
4.	the chamber and contents is cooled to a temperature still sufficiently high for the material to combust;<br>
5.	air is introduced into the chamber to allow combustion of the material;<br>
6.	the chamber is emptied.<br><br>
The destruction chamber can be emptied by flushing with water or by application of a vacuum.<br>
The means for evacuation means may be a vacuum pump incorporated in the sanitary waste disposal unit. Alternatively the evacuation means may be a connection to a vacuum system of a ship or building in which the unit is installed.<br>
Normally the destruction chamber will be arranged beneath a reception chamber for additional waste to be stored in if the unit is already processing waste.<br>
For the avoidance of odors escaping from the unit, the destruction chamber may be kept at reduced pressure even when not operational. Additionally or alternatively a deodorizer may be introduced into the chamber.<br>
To help understanding of the invention, a specific embodiment thereof will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a cross-sectional side view of a sanitary waste disposal unit of the invention.<br>
The unit 1 has a case 2 of sheet steel 3 lined with insulating material 4. The case has an open base 5 with a protective mesh 6. A lid 7 hinged at one side 8 to the case has louvers 9 and a handle 10.<br>
Mounted within the case 2 is a vacuum chamber 11 of stainless steel. It has a tapered bottom 12 leading to a shut off valve 13. Beyond the valve, the unit is plumbed 14 to a soil pipe (not shown). The vacuum chamber has holmic with heaters 15 attached to its side walls. At the top of the walls, an insulating ceramic ring 16 is provided and above this a similar, reception chamber 17 extends up. A closure member 18, fastened to the underside of the lid 7 closes the top of the reception chamber.<br>
A pair of flaps 19 are hinged at the bottom of the reception chamber for opening downwards to allow waste material in the reception chamber to fall into the vacuum chamber. The ring 16 has three ports 20, 21, 22. The first port 20 leads to a<br><br>
vacuum pump 23, whose outlet is plumbed 24 to the non-shown soil pipe, A filter 30, between the chamber 11 and the vacuum pump 23 protects the vacuum pump from any tar and other deposits produced by the waste material on heating, the fisher is typically a tar removing filter. This vacuum pump may be a stand alone pump, or may be a ships vacuum system. The second pipe 21 leads to an air valve 25 having an inlet 26 within the case 2. The third port 22 has a water valve 27 to which a water supply 28, typically sea water on board ship leads.<br>
The unit is controlled by a control unit 29, which specifically controls the outlet valve 13, the heaters 15, the vacuum pump 23, the air inlet valve 25 and the water inlet valve 27.<br>
In use the lid 7 is lifted and waste material is dropped into the reception chamber 17. On re-closure of the lid, the flaps 19 are opened by a non-shown handle. The waste material drops into the vacuum chamber 11 and the flaps 19 are closed by springs 30.   A non-shown interlock prevents their opening prior to completion of the destruction cycle. The control unit is initiated.<br>
The pump 23 is started and draws a vacuum in the vacuum chamber. The heaters 15 are switched on and the contents of the vacuum chamber, but not of the reception chamber 17 due to the insulating ring 16, are heated. The heating, typically to 300 - 500°C, drives off any volatile material in absence of oxygen, whereby the risk of explosive ignition is avoided. The volatiles are drawn by the pump 23 to the soil pipe. At this stage some of the waste has been at least partially converted to charcoal. After a safe period of time, the heaters are switched off after the chamber has cooled, as measured by a thermocouple 31, to 150^C, the air valve 25 is opened to admit air for combustion of the waste. The vacuum pump continues to draw gas, including the products of combustion, from the vacuum chamber and pass these to the non-shown soil pipe. The filter 30 prevents the tar and other solid residues from collecting in the soil pipe. Again after a period of time suitable for reasonably complete combustion, the waste material that is left comprises a few charred remains. The air valve and the vacuum pump are isolated and the chamber is flushed out to the soil pipe by opening of the water valve 29. Alternatively the waste may be removed from the chamber by<br><br>
vacuum to the soil pipe 14. After a suitable period, the entire cycle can be repeated. If necessary, further waste material can be added to the reception chamber prior to completion of the cycle. It is processed in a new cycle after completion of the previous one.<br>
Occasionally, to clean the waste disposal unit, water is introduced into the chamber 11 and the heaters 15 are switched on. After a few minutes the heater are switched off and the chamber is emptied. In the embodiment shown, where the chamber is emptied by flushing with water, it is the flushing water which is introduced into the chamber for cleaning. Alternatively where the chamber is emptied by the application of a vacuum, the cleaning water will be loaded into the chamber through the lid 7, and emptied by the application of vacuum.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
