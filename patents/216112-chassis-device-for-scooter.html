				<td>[ Detailed Description of the Invention ]<br>
[ Field of Industrial Utilization ]<br>
The present invention relates to a chassis -4evÂ» ce. for a scooter in which the top end of a rear cushion which is situated between a chassis frame and a power unit is attached to said chassis frame, and in particular to a chassis structure in which the chassis frame is divided into front and rear portions.<br>
 [ Prior Art ]<br>
Scooters having a chassis frame divided into front and rear portions have been known conventionally from Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 7-156852, for example.<br>
[ Problems Which the Invention Is Intended to Solve ]<br>
The aforementioned conventional chassis frame is divided into a front frame and rear frame, with the top end of the rear cushion which is situated between the power unit and chassis frame joined to the rear frame. A fuel tank or the like can thus be previously attached to the rear frame side when the chassis frame is assembled, but it is necessary to join the top end of the rear cushion to the rear frame after the rear frame is attached to the front frame, which does not allow for very good assembling efficiency. A side grip, rear grip, or the like is also attached to the rear frame, with a corresponding greater number of parts.<br><br>
Accordingly, there is provided a chassis device for a scooter in which the top end of a rear cushion 23 situated between a chassis frame 15 and a power unit 20 is attached to said chassis frame 15, characterized in that said chassis frame 15 comprises a main frame 31 to whose rear end the top end of the rear cushion 23 is connected, and a subframe 32 which supports an accessory such as a fuel tank 92 and which is fastened to the rear end of said main frame 31, said subframe 32 being formed of a light alloy or synthetic resin and having an integral side grip 83.<br>
In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide a chassis structure for a scooter, in which the chassis frame is divided into front and rear portions, with a better assembling efficiency and fewer parts.<br>
[Means Used to Solve the Problems]<br>
To achieve the aforementioned objectives, the invention in Claim 1 is a chassis structure for a scooter in which the top end of a rear cushion which is situated between a chassis frame and a power unit is attached to said chassis frame, charaterized by the fact that said chassis frame comprises a main frame to whose rear end the top end of the rear cushion is connected, and a subframe which<br><br>
supports an accessory such as a fuel tank and which is fastened to the rear end of the aforementioned main frame, said subframe being formed of a light alloy or synthetic resin and having an integral side grip.<br>
The invention in Claim 2 is characterized by the fact that, in addition to the aforementioned structure of the invention in Claim 1, a rear grip is integrally formed with the aforementioned subframe.<br>

In Figures 1 and 2, the front end of the scooter chassis frame 15 is equipped with a head pipe 16, the top end is equipped with handle bars 17, and at the bottom end, a front fork 18 in which a front wheel WF pivots is steerably supported by the aforementioned head pipe 16.<br><br>
A power unit 20 comprising an engine and a continuously variable transmission is equipped with a casing 21 which serves as both an engine crankcase and a transmission case for the continuously variable transmission. This casing 21 is suspended via a link mechanism 22 on the chassis frame 15, with a rear cushion 23 situated between the casing 21 and chassis frame 15. The rear wheel WR pivots in the rear end of the aforementioned casing 21.<br>
The chassis frame 15 is covered by a chassis cover 24, except for that part. The chassis cover 24 comprises: a front cover 25 that covers the top of the front wheel WF and the front of the head pipe 16; a leg shield 26 that is joined to said front cover 25 to cover the front of the rider's legs; a pair of floor panels 27 connected to the leg shield 26 and running along the left and right sides of the chassis frame 15 to support the rider's feet; undercovers 28 that are connected to the front cover 25 and to the pair of floor panels 27 so as to cover either side of the chassis under the pair of floor panels 27; and a rear cover 29 covering the left and right sides of the rear chassis and connected to the floor panels 27. A seat 30 on which the rider sits is situated on the rear cover 29.<br>
In Figures 3 and 4, the chassis frame 15 is such that a subframe 32 is fastened to the rear end of a main frame 31. The main frame 31 consists of a front frame 33 which has the integral head pipe 16, and a rear frame 34 connected to the rear end of the front frame 33, and is formed with an integral molding made of a casting of a light alloy such as an aluminum alloy or with an integral molding made of a synthetic resin reinforced with a long fiber reinforcer such as glass long fiber or carbon long fiber.<br><br>
As also illustrated in Figure 5, the front frame 33 consists of the head pipe 16, an inclined component 35 extending downward and to the rear from the head pipe 16, and a backward extending component 36 that is connected to the rear end of said inclined component 35 and that extends backward roughly horizontally. Stays 37 that extend a relatively long distance in the longitudinal direction and that project to either side are integrally provided on the left and right sides of the backward extending component 36 and the inclined component 35 in said front frame. The floor panels 27 are each supported in a fixed manner on the top surface of the stays 37, and these floor panels 27 are fastened to the stays 37 by means of a plurality of nuts 38 that come into contact with and engage the bottom surface of the stays 37 and by means of bolts 39 that are threaded into these nuts 38.<br>
4-0004-1-<br>
The front frame 33 is formed in such a way that the center (in the lateral direction) has a U-shaped outswelling 33a with an upwardly bulging side cross section. The aforementioned stays 37 are integrally connected to the left and right bottom ends of said outswelling component 33a. Steps 33b that engage the inside edge of the floor panels 27 are provided on the left and right sides of the front frame 33. The floor panels 27 are supported by the steps 37 in such a way that the outswelling component 33a is exposed to the outside above said floor panels 27.<br>
[0015]<br>
A plurality of reinforcing ribs 40 are integrally provided on the bottom surface of the backward extending component 34 and inclined component 35 of the front frame 33, and both ends of a reinforcing component 41 extending between the left and right stays 37 are fastened to the bottom surface of the two stays 37 by means of bolts 42.<br><br>
Accessory stays 43, 44, and 45 are integrally provided to the front of the front frame 33, a battery 46 accessory is attached to the accessory stay 43, an accessory horn 47 is attached to the accessory stay 44, and an accessory combination switch (not shown in figure) is attached to the accessory stay 45.<br>
-[ 0017 ]<br>
As also shown in Figures 6, 7, and 8, the rear frame 34 is integrally connected to the rear end of the front frame 33 so as to extend back and up from the rear end of the front frame 33. A compartment 49 for housing articles such as a helmet 48 (see Figure 1) is attached to said rear frame 34.<br>
The compartment 49 for housing articles is formed with a synthetic resin in the form of a box with an open top. The top of the compartment 49 for housing articles is covered by a seat 30. The seat 30 is disposed on the rear cover 29 in such a way that it can be opened and closed over the compartment 49 for housing articles.<br>
Â£0019]<br>
The rear frame 34 is provided with a concave housing component 50 that has around its periphery an upright front side wall 51, left and right side walls 52 and 52, and a rear side wall 53, and that is open at the top. The compartment 49 for housing articles is attached to the rear frame 34 with at least part of said compartment housed in the concave housing component 50.<br>
-[ 0020 ]<br>
The left and right side walls 52 and 52 each have an inside plate 52a forming the inside surface of the concave housing component 50, an outside plate 52b set up at a distance on the outside of the inside plate 52a, and a connecting plate 52c that connects the tops of the inside plate 52a and outside plate 52b, forming a roughly<br><br>
U-shaped .side cross section open at the bottom. The front side wall 51 is also formed into a roughly U-shaped side cross section open at the bottom in the same manner as the left and right side walls 52 and 52.<br>
A pair of concave mounting components 54 is provided at a distance to the left and right on the front end bottom of the concave housing component 50, and a concave mounting component 56 is provided on the rear end bottom of the concave housing component 50. Mounting protrusions 49a that fit into the concave mounting components 54 protrude from the front end bottom of the compartment 49. Said mounting protrusions 49a are fastened to the rear frame 34 by means of screw members 57. Mounting protrusions (not shown in figure) that protrude from the rear end bottom of the compartment 49 are also fastened to the rear frame 34 while fitting into the aforementioned concave mounting component 56.<br>
The rear frame 34 is provided with engine hanger brackets 58 hanging down from the left and right sides of the front end. The power unit 20 is suspended from the engine hanger brackets 58 via a link mechanism 22.<br>
.[00234]<br>
The link mechanism 22 is equipped with a link 60, in which a base 60a and tip 60b formed in the shape of tubes along parallel axes are integrally joined via a connecting arm 60c. The base 60a is supported via a pair of rubber bushings 62 by a first support shaft 61 horizontally fixed to both engine hanger brackets 58, and a second support shaft 63 is inserted through the tip 60b, and this second support shaft 63 is supported via a rubber bushing 64 by a connecting cylinder 21a located on the casing 21 for the power unit 20.<br><br>
A stopper arm 65 extending to the side opposite the connecting arm 60c is fixed to the base 60a of the link 60. Stopper rubber parts 66 and 67 are fixed to the top and bottom surfaces at the tip of said stopper arm 65. A box-shaped component 68 is integrally provided at the front end of the bottom of the rear frame 34, and the aforementioned stopper rubber parts 66 and 67 are inserted into the box-shaped component 68.<br>
This link mechanism 22 allows the power unit 20 to swing around the second support shaft 63, and allows the link 60 to swing around the first support shaft 61 while absorbing vibrations from the power unit 20 by means of the rubber bushings 62 and 64. The shaking and swinging of the link 60 is dampened by the stopper rubber parts 66 and 67 and is transmitted to the rear frame 34, that is, the chassis frame 15 side.<br>
However, because the rear frame 34 is formed with an integral molding made of a casting of a light alloy such as an aluminum alloy or with an integral molding made of a synthetic resin reinforced with a long fiber reinforcer such as glass long fiber or carbon long fiber, the dimensional precision among the pair of engine hanger brackets 58 is not very precise due to the effects of strain and contraction. Washers 69 for adjusting the dimensions are inserted between the pairs of rubber bushings 62 and engine hanger brackets 58 so as to address this diminished dimensional precision between the pair of engine hanger brackets 58.<br>
As also shown in Figures 9, 10, and 11, a rear cushion mounting component 70 that is downwardly concave is located at the rear component of the main frame 31, that is, the rear component of the rear frame 34, at a position adjacent to the. left side wall 52 of the concave housing component 50. The top end<br><br>
of the rear cushion 23 which is situated between the main frame 34 and the power unit 20 is directly connected via rubber parts 79 and 80 to the rear cushion mounting component 70.<br>
The rear cushion 23 is composed of a hydraulic damper 71 in which a rod 71b protrudes from the bottom end of a cylindrical damper main unit 7 la, and a coil spring 72 which is situated between the top of the damper main unit 7 la and the bottom of the rod 71b so as to encompass the hydraulic damper 71. The bottom end of said rear cushion 23, that is, the bottom end of the rod 71b, is connected via a shaft 73 to the rear component of the casing 21 of the power unit 20.<br>
A connecting shaft 74 is coaxially fixed to the top end of the rear cushion 23, that is, to the top end of the damper main unit 7 la. The rear cushion mounting component 70 is provided with a mounting hole 75 through which the connecting shaft 74 is inserted. The rubber part 79, whose outward swelling in the radial direction is constrained by the concave rear cushion 70, is mounted between the rear cushion mounting component 70 and the bushing 76 through which the top of the connecting shaft 74 passes. A bolt 77 that engages the bushing 76 is threaded into the top end of the connecting shaft 74. The rubber part 80 is mounted between the top end of the damper main unit 7 la and a guide member 78 formed in the shape of a cap, with a tubular component 78a that fits into the mounting hole 75, so that the outward swelling of the rubber in the radial direction is constrained by said guide member 78. In other words, the top end of the rear cushion 23 is directly connected to the rear cushion mounting component 70 via the rubber parts 79 and 80.<br><br>
The subframe 32 has a pair of left and right vertical frame components 83 and 83 extending in the longitudinal direction while inclining upward and backward, and is formed with a light alloy such as an aluminum alloy or with a synthetic resin<br><br>
that has ..been reinforced with a long fiber reinforcing material. Mounting components 85 and 85 integrally provided to the front end of the pair of vertical frame components 83 and 83 are fastened to the rear end of the main frame 31, that is, to the rear end of the rear frame 34. The mounting components 85 are integrally provided with a front and back pair of mounting legs 86 and 87 which protrude toward the rear end side of the rear frame 34. Support protrusions 90 and 91 corresponding to the aforementioned pair of mounting legs 86 and 87 protrude toward the subframe 32 side at the rear end of the rear frame 34, and the aforementioned mounting legs 86 and 87 are fastened to the support protrusions 90 and 91, that is, to the rear end of the rear frame 34, using fastening bolts 88 and 89 with the front ends of said legs touching the corresponding support protrusions 90 and 91.<br>
In the rear component of the rear frame 34, the support protrusions 90 and 91 which are situated on the side having the rear cushion mounting component 70, that is, the left side, are arranged before and after the rear cushion mounting component 70, and the subframe 32 is fastened to the rear frame 34, that is, to the main frame 31, before and after the rear cushion mounting component 70.<br>
The subframe 32 is situated so as to encompass the rear and both sides of the fuel tank 92. The front end on either side of said fuel tank 92 is fastened to and supported by the mounting components 85 and 85 of the subframe 32. Tank support components 84 and 84 are integrally provided to the rear end of the pair of vertical frame components 83 and 83, and the rear end on either side of the fuel tank 92 is fastened to and supported by the pair of tank support components 84 and 84. Although not shown in the figures, a rear fender and tail lamp are also attached to the subframe 32.<br><br>
The subframe 32 is integrally provided with a rear grip 97 that is connected to the rear end of the pair of vertical frame components 83 and 83 and is formed in the shape of a gate. The rear end of the seat 30 is supported by a support component 98 integrally provided across the center on either side of the rear grip 97.<br>
As also shown in Figure 12, the pair of vertical frame components 83 and 83 of the subframe 32 also function as side grips, and openings 99 allowing these vertical frame components 83 and 83 to be gripped are provided on either side of the rear cover 29.<br>
The action of this embodiment is described below. In the main frame 31, in which the rear frame 34 is integrally formed with the front frame 33 having the head pipe 16 integrated with the front end, stays 37 are integrally provided to the left and right on either side of the front frame 33, and floor panels 27 that support the rider's feet are supported on these stays 37, so there is no need to provide a frame that is separate from the front frame 33, allowing the number of parts to be reduced. Accessory stays 43, 44, and 45 for attaching a battery 46, horn 47, and combination switch are integrally provided to the front component of the front frame 33, so that separate accessory stays are not needed, also allowing the number of parts to be reduced.<br>
The aforementioned stays 37 extend for a relatively long distance in the longitudinal direction and are integrated with both the left and right sides of the front frame 33, preventing the load on the stays 37 from being brought to bear locally on the front frame 33 and allowing the load on the front frame 33 to be distributed roughly uniformly over the relatively long distance in the longitudinal<br><br>
direction. . The load from the front panels 27 can thus be adequately supported, even when the front frame 33 has a shape with an open cross section, making it easier to integrally form the stays 37 with the front frame 33.<br>
The front frame 33 has, in the center (in the lateral direction), a U-shaped outswelling 33a with an upwardly bulging side cross section, so that the front frame 33 has a relatively large side cross sectional area, allowing said front frame 33 to be made more rigid. A reinforcing member 41 is also mounted between the left and right stays 37 of the front frame 33, so as to allow the front frame 33 to be made even more rigid. The floor panels 27 are supported by the stays 37, with the top of the outswelling 33a exposed to the outside, so the leg shield 26 and floor panels 27 of the chassis cover 24 can be made relatively small.<br>
The rear frame 34 of the main frame 31 is provided with a concave housing component 50 that has around its periphery an upright front side wall 51, left and right side walls 52 and 52, and a rear side wall 53, and that is open at the top. A compartment 49 for housing articles is attached to the rear frame 34 by housing part of said compartment in said concave housing component 50, so there is no need to increase the thickness of the component supporting the floor of the compartment 49 for housing articles, the rear frame 34 can be made more rigid, and the top end position of the compartment 49 for housing articles, that is, the seat height, can be kept low, without any increase in weight.<br>
[00391-<br>
Although the top end of the rear cushion 23 is joined to the rear component of the rear frame 34, the left side wall 52 of the concave housing component 50 has an inside plate 52a forming the inside surface of the concave housing component 50, an outside plate 52b situated at a distance on the outside of the inside plate 52a, and a connecting plate 52c that connects the top ends of the inside plate 52a and the outside plate 52b, forming a roughly U-shaped side cross section shape that is open<br><br>
at the bottom, and the top end of the rear cushion 23 is connected to the rear frame 34 at a location adjacent to the left side wall 52, allowing the rear cushion 23 to be attached to the rear frame 34 with greater rigidity. The rear frame 34 is integrally provided with engine hanger brackets 58, so that there is no need for separate brackets to hang the engine, thus allowing the number of parts to be reduced.<br>
The top end of the rear cushion 23 is directly joined via rubber parts 79 and 80 between the upper and lower surfaces of the rear cushion mounting component 70 located on the rear frame 34, and there is no need for a separate bracket to attach the rear cushion 23, allowing the number of parts to be reduced. Furthermore, the rear cushion mounting component 70 is downwardly concave and is located in the rear component of the rear frame 31, allowing the rigidity of the rear cushion mounting component 70 to be increased to a relatively high level. The rubber part 79 is fitted into the concave rear cushion mounting component 70, thereby dispensing with the need for a guide component to constrain the swelling of said rubber part 79 in the radial direction and further contributing to the reduction in the number of parts.<br>
The load protruding up from the rear cushion 23 is brought to bear on the rear component of the rear frame 34, but the subframe 32 which receives part of the rider load from the seat 30, the load of the fuel tank 92, and the load that results when the chassis is picked up by gripping the rear grip 97 or the vertical frame components 83 functioning as side grips is fastened to the rear frame 34 before and after the rear cushion mounting component 70. Accordingly, a load with a phase opposite the load protruding up from the rear cushion 23 can be brought to bear on the rear frame 34 before and after the rear cushion mounting component 70, and a relatively substantial load in a fixed direction can be prevented from acting on the rear component of the rear frame 34, thus dispensing with the need to increase the thickness of the rear frame 34 and to provide reinforcing ribs, so that the weight can be reduced.<br><br>
A fuel tank 92 or rear fender and tail lamp, etc., may also be attached to the subframe 32. Since the subframe 32 to which the fuel tank 92 or rear fender and tail lamp or the like have been attached can be assembled with the rear frame 34, the fuel tank 92 or rear fender and tail lamp or the like can be prepared in advance in a small set, in the scooter assembly, and the subframe 32 with this small set can be fastened to the main frame 31 to which the top end of the rear cushion 23 is attached, thereby allowing the assembly efficiency to be enhanced.<br>
Since, moreover, the subframe 32 has an integral rear grip 97 and vertical frame components 83 which function as side grips, there is no need to provide such grips separately, contributing to the reduction in the number of parts.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention has been described above, but the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment. Various design modifications are possible within the essential scope of the present invention described in the claims.<br>
 [ Merits of the Invention ]<br>
As described above, the chassis frame in the invention in Claim 1 is composed of a main frame to whose rear end the top end of the rear cushion is connected, and a subframe which supports an accessory such as a fuel tank and which is fastened to the rear end of the aforementioned main frame, said subframe being formed of a light alloy or synthetic resin and having an integral side grip. The subframe with this small set can be fastened to the main frame to which the top end of the rear cushion is attached, thereby allowing the assembly efficiency to be enhanced, and the subframe is also integrally provided with side grips, allowing the number of parts to be reduced.<br><br>
In the invention in Claim 2, a rear grip is integrally formed with the subframe, allowing the number of parts to be even further reduced.<br>
