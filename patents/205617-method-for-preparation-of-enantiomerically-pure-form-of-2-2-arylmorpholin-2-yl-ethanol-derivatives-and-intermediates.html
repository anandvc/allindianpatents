COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10, Rule 13]<br>
"METHOD FOR PREPARATION OF ENANTIOMERICALLY PURE FORM OF 2-(2-ARYLMORPHOLIN-2-YL) ETHANOL DERIVATIVES AND INTERMEDIATES"<br>
SANOFI-SYNTHELABO, of 174, Avenue de France, F-75013 Paris, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention is novel processes for the preparation of enantiomerically pure form of substituted 2-(2-arylmorpholin-2-yl) ethanol derivatives in the enantiomerically pure form and intermediate compounds of use in these processes.<br>
Substituted 2-(2-arylmorpholin-2-yl)ethanol derivatives   of   formula:<br><br>
in which X represents a halogen atom and * indicates the position of the asymmetric carbon atom, are key-intermediates in the preparation of tachykinin receptor antagonist compounds, such as those disclosed in international application WO 96/23787 and in application EP-A-776 893. Thus, for example, (R)-(+)-3-{1-[2-(4-benzoyl-2-(3,4-difluorophenyl)morpholin-2-yl)ethyl]-4-phenylpiperidin-4-yl}-1,1-dimethylurea is described as a powerful and selective antagonist for human NK2 receptors of neurokinin A (X. Emonds-Alt et al., Neuropeptides, 1997, 31 (5), 449-458) and, consequently, may" be of use in particular in the<br><br><br>
treatment of conditions of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, immune or cardiovascular system, and of the central nervous system, and of pain<br><br>
and migraine.	<br>
The term "halogen atom" is understood to mean a bromine, chlorine, fluorine or iodine atom.<br>
Preferably, a subject matter of the present invention is novel processes for the preparation of enantiomerically pure compounds of formula (I) in which X represents a chlorine atom or a fluorine atom.<br>
The preparation of compounds of formula (I) is illustrated in international application WO 96/23787 and is carried out according to scheme 1 below, in which X represents a halogen atom.<br><br><br>
However, this process has disadvantages which are sufficient to exclude it from any use on an industrial scale.<br><br>
For example, the compound of formula (I) in which X represents a fluorine atom prepared by this process is obtained with a very low yield, of the order of 1 to 2% calculated from the starting benzaldehyde derivative, from the description of application WO 96/23787.<br>
The compound of formula (I) in which X represents a chlorine or fluorine atom can also be prepared according to the enantioselective process described in Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, 1998, % 3251-3262. However, this process has the disadvantage of using starting materials, such as diketene, and reagents, such as dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II), AD-mix-□® or diethyl azodicarboxylate, the costs of which render the production of compound of formula (I) highly expensive on an industrial scale. Novel processes for the preparation of the enantiomerically pure compound of formula (I) from simple starting materials and reagents and with yields of the order of 5 to 25% have now been found.<br>
Thus, according to one of its aspects, a subject matter of the present invention is a process A for the preparation of a compound, in the enantiomerically pure form, of formula:<br><br><br>
in which X represents a halogen atom, of its salts with inorganic or organic acids or of its salts with optically active organic acids, characterized in that: a)   a compound, in the racemic form, in the form of a mixture of diastereoisomers or in the enantiomerically pure form, of formula:<br><br>
in which X is as defined for a compound of formula (I) and R1 represents an N-protecting group chosen from a benzyl group, a benzyloxycarbonyl group, a 1-chloro-ethyloxycarbonyl group, a tert-butyloxycarbonyl group or an α-methylbenzyl group, is converted to a compound, in the racemic form, in the form of a mixture of diastereoisomers or in the enantiomerically pure form, of formula:—<br><br><br>
b)	the compound of formula (III) thus obtained is deprotected;<br>
c)	if appropriate, when the compound of formula [I) thus obtained is in the racemic form, the enantiomers are separated, and, optionally, the eantiomerically pure compound of formula (I) is converted to one of its salts with inorganic or organic acids.<br>
Preferably, in process A, R1 represents a benzyl group or a benzyloxycarbonyl group.<br>
When X represents a chlorine atom, referably, in process A, R1 represents a tert-utyloxycarbonyl group or a 1-chloroethyloxycarbonyl roup.<br>
When, in process A according to the nvention, non-racemizing reactions which retain the hirality are used in stages a) and b), an enantiomerically pure compound of formula (I) is prepared directly using, as starting compound, an enantiomerically pure compound of formula (II).<br><br>
In stage a) of process A, a compound of formula (II) is converted to a compound of formula (III) according to conventional methods well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Preferably, in stage a), the compound of formula (II) is first subjected to a hydroboration reaction and then to an oxidation reaction to obtain a compound of formula (III) .<br>
The hydroboration reaction of an asymmetric alkene of formula (II) and then the in situ oxidation reaction of the organoborane formed as an intermediate to give the primary alcohol of formula (III) are carried out according to conventional methods, such as those described in J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1974, 96   (25), 7765-7770 or in J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1960, 82.,   4708-4712. The hydroboration agents used, which are well known to a person skilled in the art, are, for example, either borane complexes, such as the borane-tetrahydrofuran complex or the borarve-dimethyl sulfide complex, or 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane or 9-BBN. The borane used can also be generated in situ, according to conventional methods, from, for example, sodium borohydride or lithium borohydride and an acid, such as a Lewis acid.<br>
Use is preferably made of the borane-tetrahydrofuran complex, 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane or<br><br>
the borane generated in situ by reaction of trimethylsilyl chloride with sodium borohydride.<br>
When the borane-tetrahydrofuran complex is used, the latter participates in the reaction in a proportion of 0.3 to 1.5 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of compound of formula (II).<br>
When 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane is used, the latter participates in the reaction in a proportion of 1 to 1.5 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of compound of formula (II).<br>
When the borane is generated in situ by reaction of trimethylsilyl chloride with sodium borohydride, these compounds are each used in a proportion of 3 to 5 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of compound of formula (II).<br>
The hydroboration reaction is carried out in an inert solvent, such as an ether, for example diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane or diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, or such as an aromatic hydrocarbon, for example toluene or xylene, at a temperature of between ambient temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent and for a time of between 5 and 48 hours.<br>
The organoborane formed as an intermediate substance is subsequently subjected to a conventional oxidation reaction. Preferably, the oxidation reaction is carried out under phase transfer catalysis<br><br>
conditions using a peroxide, in the presence of a strong base and of a phase transfer catalyst in an inert solvent and water.<br>
It is preferable to use hydrogen peroxide as peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide participates in the reaction in a proportion of 3 to 5 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of compound of formula (II).<br>
The base used during the reaction is chosen from an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide. It participates in the reaction in a proportion of 1 to 2 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of compound of formula (II).<br>
The phase transfer catalyst is chosen from substituted quaternary ammonium salts, such as tetrabutylammonium hydrogensulfate. It participates in the reaction in a proportion of 0.01 to 0.1 molar equivalent per molar equivalent of compound of formula<br>
(II). <br>
The oxidation reaction is carried out in one of the solvents abovementioned above for the hydroboration reaction and at a temperature of between 0°C and 60°C.<br>
This oxidation reaction is highly exothermic and requires control of the flow rate for introduction of the peroxide and of the temperature of the reaction medium.<br><br>
The reaction takes place over a time of between the duration of introduction of the hydrogen peroxide solution and 48 hours.<br>
As the hydrogen peroxide/tetrahydrofuran mixture is regarded as dangerous at the industrial stage, it is preferable to carry out the oxidation reaction in an aromatic solvent, preferably toluene. In this case, an exchange of solvent may be necessary before the oxidation reaction or, preferably, before the hydroboration reaction.<br>
In stage b) of process A, the compound of formula (III) thus obtained is deprotected according to conventional methods.<br>
Thus, the deprotection of the benzyl group of the compound of formula (IIIa), the deprotection of the benzyloxycarbonyl group of the compound of formula (IIIb) or the deprotection of the α-methylbenzyl group of the compound of formula (IIIe) is carried out by hydrogenolysis, preferably by catalytic hydrogenation, or by hydrogen transfer catalysis.<br>
The catalytic hydrogenation is carried out in an inert solvent, such as an alcohol (methanol, ethanol or propan-2-ol, for example), an aromatic hydrocarbon (toluene or xylene, for example) or an ester (ethyl acetate, for example), or in a mixture of these abovementioned solvents, in the presence of a catalyst, such as palladium-on-charcoal or Raney nickel, under a<br><br>
pressure of between 1 and 10 bar, at a temperature of between 0°C and 100oC and for a time of between 1 and 24 hours.<br>
The hydrogen transfer catalysis is carried out using ammonium formate in the presence of a catalyst, such a palladium-on-charcoal, in an inert solvent, such as an alcohol (methanol or ethanol, for example), at a temperature of between ambient temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent and for a time of between 2 and 4 8 hours.<br>
The deprotection of the 1-chloroethyloxy-carbonyl group of the compound of formula (IIIc) is carried out by reaction with methanol at a temperature of between ambient temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
The deprotection of the tert-butyloxycarbonyl group of the compound of formula (IIId) is carried out by acid hydrolysis by means of hydrochloric acid or trifluoroacetic acid, for example, in an inert solvent, such as an alcohol (methanol or ethanol, for example), an ether (diethyl ether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, for example) or a halogenated hydrocarbon (dichloromethane, for example), and at a temperature of between -10°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
When the compound of formula (I) is obtained in the racemic form, the enantiomers are separated in<br><br>
stage c) according to known methods. Preferably, the separation is carried out by preparation of an optically active salt, by the action of an optically active organic acid, such as L-(+)- or D-(-)-mandelic acid, L-(-)- or D-( + )-di-para-toluoyltartaric acid, L-( + )- or D-(-)-tartaric acid, L-(-)- or D-( + )-dibenzoyltartaric acid or (lR)-(-)- or (1S)-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid, and then separation of the isomers, for example by crystallization. The desired enantiomer is released from its salt in basic medium.<br>
Preferably, the separation of the enantiomers of the compound of formula (I) is carried out by formation of an optically active salt, by the action of L-(-)- or D-(+)-di-para-toluoyltartaric acid.<br>
The enantiomerically pure compounds of formula (I) in the form of optically active salts with optically active organic acids are novel and form part of the invention.<br>
The enantiomerically pure compounds of formula (I) in the form of optically active salts with optically active organic acids in which X represents a chlorine atom or a fluorine atom are preferred.<br>
The enantiomerically pure compounds of formula (I) in the form of salts with L-(-)- or D-(+)-di-para-toluoyltartaric acid are preferred.<br>
The compounds of formula (II), in the enantiomerically pure form, in the racemic form or in<br><br>
the form of a mixture of diastereoisomers, and their optional salts with inorganic or organic acids are novel and form part of the invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) in which X represents a chlorine atom or a fluorine atom are preferred.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) in which R1 represents a benzyl group or a benzyloxycarbonyl group are preferred.<br>
According to another of its aspects, a subject matter of the invention is a process B for the coreparation of a compound, in the enantiomerically pure form or in the racemic form, of formula:<br><br>
In which X represents a halogen atom and R1 represents a benzyloxycarbonyl group or a 1-chloroethyloxycarbonyl group, characterized in that a compound, in the enantiomerically pure form or in the racemic form, of formula: <br><br>
in which X is as defined for a compound of formula (II), is reacted with benzyl chloroformate or 1-chloroethyl chloroformate in the presence of a base, with or without solvent.<br>
Preferably, in process B, R1 represents a benzyloxycarbonyl group.<br>
The benzyl chloroformate or the 1-chloroethyl chloroformate is used in the reaction in a proportion of 1 to 1.5 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of compound of formula (IIa).<br>
The base used in the reaction is chosen from organic bases, such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine or N-methylmorpholine, or from alkali metal carbonates or bicarbonates, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate.<br>
The base is used in the reaction in a proportion of 0.01 to 1.5 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of compound of formula (IIa).<br>
When the reaction is carried out in a solvent, the latter is chosen from an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as toluene or xylene, a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloro-ethane, carbon tetrachloride, chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene, an ether, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or dimethoxyethane, an ester, such as ethyl acetate, an amide, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, a<br><br>
nitrile, such as acetonitrile, or a ketone, such as acetone.<br>
The reaction is carried out at a temperature of between -20°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent and for a time of between 1 to 24 hours.<br>
According to another of its aspects, a subject matter of the invention is a process C for the preparation of a compound, in the enantiomerically pure form, in the form of a mixture of diastereoisomers or in the racemic form, of formula:<br><br>

in which X and R1 are as defined for a compound of formula (II), is cyclized and, optionally, the compound of formula (II) thus obtained is converted to one of its salts.<br>
Preferably, in process C, R1 represents a benzyl group.<br>
The reaction for the cyclization of a diol of formula (IV) to a morpholine derivative of formula (II) can be carried out according to known methods as described, for example, in J. Med. Chem., 1994, 37, 2791-2796.<br>
Preferably, the cyclization reaction is carried out under phase transfer catalysis conditions using an alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl halide in the presence of a strong base and of a phase transfer catalyst, in an inert solvent as a mixture with water.<br>
The reaction of the primary alcohol of the compound of formula (IV) with an alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl halide in the presence of a strong base makes it possible first to form an alkylsulfonate or<br><br>
arylsulfonate ester which, under the reaction conditions, cyclizes in situ to form the morpholine ring.<br>
It has been found that, when the cyclization reaction of an enantiomerically pure compound of formula (IV) is carried out under the abovementioned conditions, an enantiomerically pure compound of formula (II) is obtained, the asymmetric carbon of which has the same configuration.<br>
Preference is given, among alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl halides, to methanesulfonyl chloride, benzenesulfonyl chloride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride.<br>
The alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl halide participates in the reaction in a proportion of 1 to 1.5 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of compound of formula (IV).<br>

(XXI), in which R2 represents an O-protecting group and<br>
Hal"" represents a halogen atom, in the presence of a base in an inert solvent, followed by the deprotection of the O-protecting group;<br>
