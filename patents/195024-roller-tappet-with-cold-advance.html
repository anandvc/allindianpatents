(-)	a return means wherein throttle hole is provided on said<br>
plate valve such that throttle hole facilitates the collapse of said plunger position upon activation of oil supply cut off by cut off means.<br>
A piston so provided in the Roller Tappet, such that it moves up and down the said Roller Tappet, due to flow of lubricating oil from lubricating oil supply pump which is at a pressure of 2.5 - 3 bar, through a plate valve. Said lubricating oil which flows through the said plate valve, lifts the said hydro tappet piston by 1.5 mm. The said 1.5 mm lift enables the plunger to be 1.5 mm in advance position. The said 1.5 mm lift of the said plunger corresponds to 8° to 10° crank angle depending upon the cam profile.<br>
The stroke of the said piston is limited by a stopper. The said stroke of the Roller Tappet device is calculated such that the lift and advancement of piston plunger is relative to the cold advancement requirement of the engine. The position of the plunger in advance position is decided by cold condition factors and is predetermined . Generally in cold condition the Roller Tappet which is at bottom dead centre position and the lubricating oil is at a pressure flows through the plate valve and advance the piston position. The extent of advancing the position and the extent of advancement is decided by cold condition requirement. The said plate valve provides a hydraulic lock and therein prevents the said lubricating oil leakage due to injection pressure. The said plate valve is provided with a throttle hole.
