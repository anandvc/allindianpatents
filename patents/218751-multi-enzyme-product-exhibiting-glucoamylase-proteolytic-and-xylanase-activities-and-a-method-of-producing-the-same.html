"MULTI-ENZYME        PRODUCT        EXHIBITING        GLUCOAMYLASE, PROTEOLYTIC AND XYLANASE ACTIVITIES"<br>
GIE AGRO INDUSTRIE, of 23 rue du Chateau, F-10100 Romilly sur Seine, France.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
1<br>
MULTI-ENZYME PRODUCT WITH GLUCOAMYLASE, PROTEOLYTIC AND XYLANASE- ACTIVITIES AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING SAME BY SOLID STATE FERMENTATION OF WHEAT ' BRAN WITH <br>
ASPERGILLUS NIGER <br>
5 		The invention relates to a multi-enzyme product with glucoamylase, proteolytic and xylanase activities and a method for producing same by solid state fermentation of wheat bran with Aspergillus niger.<br>
It is known to produce ethanol from corn starch by<br>
10 	an enzymatic method comprising a stage for liquefying the starch with an alpha-amylase for hydrolyzing the starch to dextrins, and then a saccharif ication stage by a glucoamylase (also called amyloglucosidase) for hydrolyzing the dextrins to glucose, and finally a stage<br>
15    for fermenting the latter to ethanol.<br>
The use of alpha-amylase and glucoamylase enzymes is generally satisfactory when relatively pure starch milk, obtained by the wet milling of corn, is used as starting material, but when it is desired to substitute<br>
20 wheat starches or wheat flours for corn starch, no satisfactory results are obtained with these two enzymes alone because of the presence of hemicelluloses, which increase the viscosity of the saccharified flour worts to the. extent that this creates a problem for carrying out<br>
25 .the method. It is necessary to use, at the saccharification stage, auxiliary enzymes such as cellulases and hemicellulases in order to -reduce the viscosity and remedy this problem. Moreover, it is desirable also to use proteases during saccharification<br>
30 	so as to hydrolyze the proteins in the flour and thus enrich the wort with soluble nitrogen in anticipation of the subsequent alcoholic fermentation stage. The traditional supply of nitrogen source necessary for the growth of yeasts during this fermentation may thus be<br>
35    reduced.<br><br>
2<br>
All these enzymes are individually commercially available in purified form, but have the disadvantage of being relatively expensive and therefore of increasing the cost of producing ethanol from wheat. In addition, <br>
5 	compositions have to be formulated from individual enzymes, which complicates the method.<br>
A need therefore exists for an inexpensive multi-enzyme product combining glucoamylase, proteolytic and hemicellulase activities to produce ethanol from wheat<br>
10   flours at a low cost.<br>
The invention aims to satisfy this need.<br>
The present invention relates to a multi-enzyme product exhibiting glucoamylase, proteolytic and xylanase activities, characterized in that it consists of wheat<br>
15 	bran fermented with an Aspergillus niger strain, said enzymatic glucoamylase, proteolytic and xylanase activities being present at the following minimum values:<br>
-	glucoamylase: at least 100 GU per gram of dry matter,<br>
-	proteolytic: at least 100 PU per gram of dry matter, 20    - xylanase: at least 100 XU per gram of dry matter,<br>
provided that the glucoamylase activity is at least 750 GU per gram of dry matter and/or the xylanase activity is at least 300 XU per gram of dry matter.<br>
The glucoamylase activity is preferably at least<br>
25  1500 GU per gram of dry matter and/or the xylanase activity is at least 400 XU per gram of dry matter.<br>
Also, the proteolytic activity is preferably at least 400 PU per gram of dry matter.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of producing<br>
30 	this multi-enzyme product, characterized in that it comprises the stages consisting in (a) taking wheat bran; (b) moistening and heat-treating said bran so as to pasteurize it or sterilize it; (c) inoculating the resulting wheat bran with an Aspergillus niger strain; <br>
35    (d) the bran being in the form of a layer at least 10 cm<br><br>
3<br>
thick, fermenting it in the solid state in a reactor which is aerated and stirred periodically for a period of 1 to 3 days, at a temperature of 28-38°C, preferably 32 to 36°C, said bran being adjusted to an initial moisture<br>
5 	content of 50 to 60 wt.% which is substantially maintained during the duration of the fermentation, under aeration conditions appropriate for avoiding accumulation of carbon dioxide which is harmful to the fermentation in the reactor and a rise in temperature due to fermentation<br>
10 	above the recommended range, until the fermentation product exhibits the following minimum enzyme activity values:<br>
-	glucoamylase: at least 100 GU per gram of dry matter,<br>
-	proteolytic: at least 100 PU per gram of dry matter, 15    - xylanase: at least 100 XU per gram of dry matter,<br>
provided that the glucoamylase activity is at least 750 GU per gram of dry matter and/or the xylanase activity is at least 300 XU per gram of dry matter.<br>
The glucoamylase activity is preferably at least<br>
20  1500 GU per gram of dry matter and/or the xylanase activity is at least 400 XU per gram of dry matter.<br>
Also,  the proteolytic activity is preferably at least 400 PU per gram of dry matter.<br>
The Aspergillus   niger   strain is preferably chosen<br>
25 	from the NRRL 3112 strain, the ATCC 76061 strain and the strains obtained from said strains by selection or mutation when a high glucoamylase activity is desired. The ATCC 76061 strain is particularly preferred.<br>
When a high glucoamylase activity is desired, the<br>
30 	wheat bran used as starting material should be a non-starch-free bran. Apart from this restriction, any bran may be used. However, the bran preferably comprises a significant proportion (at least 40 wt.%) of particles of less than 1 mm.<br>
35	The characteristics of two suitable brans are given<br><br>
4<br>
below by way of illustration.<br>

% WM = % relative to the wet matter.<br>
The wheat bran should be moistened and heat-treated in order to pasteurize it or to sterilize it. It is advantageous that the heat treatment does not precede the moistening because poor fermentation results have been obtained if the bran is heat-treated before moistening. The heat treatment may consist in heating, for example,<br>
10 	in an autoclave. An autoclave treatment of 20 min at 120-121°C has proved highly satisfactory, but less severe conditions (pasteurization at 105°C for 15 min in an oven) are also suitable. It is also possible to carry out the heat treatment of the bran by injecting steam into<br>
15 	it, which may make it possible to moisten the bran simultaneously.<br>
The pH may advantageously be adjusted during moistening in the range from 4 to 5.5 in order to improve the pasteurizing effect of the heat treatment and the<br>
20   initiation of the desired fermentation.<br>
In addition to its sterilizing function, the effect of the heat treatment is to promote gelatinization of the<br><br>
5<br>
starch contained in the wheat bran and therefore the availability of this substrate for the fungus Aspergillus niger,   which allows more effective fermentation.<br>
The moistening of the bran is important because the<br>
5 	water content influences the performance of the fermentation. The initial water content of the bran is initially adjusted to 50-60%, preferably 50-55%, of the total mass of the bran and of the water and it is substantially   maintained   in   this   range   during<br>
10 	fermentation, for example by periodically supplying water in order to compensate for the loss of water from the medium. The expression "substantially maintained" means that it is acceptable for the moisture level to take a value which varies slightly (± 5% units) from the range<br>
15 	50-60% during a relatively brief period between two successive adjustments of the moisture level or at the end of fermentation. It is advantageous, in any case, not to drop below a moisture level of 45%. The moisture level of  the  culture medium tends  to  decrease  during the<br>
20 	culture through evaporation due to the increase in temperature generated by the fungal growth, said medium being a poor heat conductor. The quality of the water used also plays a significant role. Good quality running water or distilled water may be used.<br>
25	The inoculation of the wheat bran may be performed<br>
with any appropriate inoculum. Persons skilled in the art know many ways of preparing a suitable inoculum from a selected strain. The inoculum dose is advantageously at least 1 x 107 spores/gram of initial dry matter.<br>
30	The  fermentation  may  be  carried  out  in  any<br>
appropriate reactor. Examples of a reactor which can be used are those described in the paper by A. DURAND et al., published in Agro-Food-Industry Hi-Tech (May-June 1997, pages 39-42).<br>
35	The fermentation may be carried out for a period of<br><br>
6<br>
1 to 3 days, preferably of 30 to 60 hours. At less than 1 day, the fermentation is too incomplete. After 3 days, the fermentation is complete or practically complete and it would be uneconomical to prolong it further. The <br>
5 	temperature of the medium is typically maintained between 28 and 38°C, preferably between 32 and 36°C, which corresponds to the optimum activity range known for the Aspergillus niger strains to be used in the invention. For this purpose, the air temperature is advantageously<br>
10 	set at 34-38 °C for the first few hours of fermentation in order to promote germination of the spores, and then reduced to 28-32°C for the remainder of the fermentation in order to contribute to the regulation of the temperature of the medium.<br>
15	The pH of the fermentation medium is not usually<br>
regulated. If its starting value is close to 6.0-6.4, the pH decreases to 3.8-4.2 during culture but increases at the end. This change is generally correlated with the fungus  sporulation  phase.  The  variation  of  the  pH<br>
20    constitutes a good indicator of the state of the culture.<br>
The  fermentor  should  be  aerated,  preferably<br>
continuously, in order to supply the oxygen necessary for<br>
fermentation and to avoid the excessive accumulation of<br>
carbon dioxide produced by fermentation. In addition, the<br>
25 	aeration helps to control the temperature and the moisture of the culture medium. The air is preferably substantially saturated with water in order to limit the tendency for the medium to dry out. It is difficult to give  quantitative  information  on  the  aeration  rate<br>
30 	because many variables, in particular the size and the geometry of the reactor, the quantity of loaded bran, and the like, come into play. Simple routine trials will allow persons skilled in the art to easily determine a suitable aeration rate in each practical case, however.<br>
35	The  bran  load  in  the  fermentor  should  be<br><br>
7<br>
periodically added during fermentation using stirring means, such as stirring arms, blades or spatulas, or lead screws so as to avoid the formation of impermeable masses and so that the aeration reaches the entire mass of bran<br>
5 	as homogeneously as possible. Excessively vigorous stirring which could harm the fungus should be avoided, however.<br>
The product of the invention is a solid product which is useful in particular for the production of<br>
10 	ethanol from wheat. It may be directly added to liquefied starch (dextrins) obtained in the liquefaction stage, in order to carry out the saccharification. For this application, it is the glucoamylase activity which is the most important factor. A product of the invention will<br>
15 	therefore preferably be used which has a glucoamylase activity of at least 750 GU, for example, preferably of at least 1 500 GU per gram of dry matter.<br>
Another  possible  use  of  the  product  of  the invention relates to the production of wheat-based feed<br>
20 	for monogastric animals, for example poultry and pigs. In this application, it is the xylanase activity which constitutes the most important factor. A product will therefore be used in this application which preferably has a high xylanase activity, for example of at least<br>
25    400 XU per gram of dry matter.<br>
The product of the invention may be dried or frozen for storage, if desired.<br>
The drying should be carried out at a moderate temperature so as not to affect the enzyme activity.<br>
30 	Heating in an oven at 40°C has proved to be appropriate, for example. Freezing may be carried out on the moist product at low temperature, for example at -20°C.<br>
In the examples, the various enzyme activities were measured by the following methods:<br>
35	a) Glucoamylase activity<br><br>
8<br>
The action of a glucoamylase (GA) preparation on a starch solution brings about the release of reducing sugars. Heated at 100°C in the presence of 3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS), these compositions take <br>
5 	on a brown color which is measured on a spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments, Milan, Italy) at 540 nm.<br>
The reaction medium contains<br>
•	starch solution 1%	500 ml<br>
•	citrate buffer 0.1 at pH 4.5   450 ml<br>
10          • enzyme solution:	50 ml<br>
The reaction occurs for 30 min at 60°C (55°C for<br>
     the A. orizae GAs). Samples are collected every 5 min,<br>
mixed with DNS and placed in an ice bath. They are then<br>
   heated for 5 min at  100°C,  rapidly cooled and then<br>
15   assayed at 540 nm.<br>
These assay conditions were established after studying the influence of the temperature and the pH on the activity of the GA preparations. Merck soluble starch (Darmstadt, Germany) was used as substrate for this <br>
20 	enzymatic hydrolysis. The DNS is prepared according to the following protocol proposed by P. Bernfeld, Methods in enzymology, 1, 149-159 (1955): <br>
     =&gt;  Dissolve beforehand:<br>
*	10 g of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid<br>
25            * 200 ml of 2 molar sodium hydroxide<br>
*	200 ml of distilled water.<br>
=&gt; Then add:<br>
*	300 g of sodium potassium tartrate.<br>
=&gt;  Adjust the volume to 1 liter with distilled water<br>
30	after complete dissolution.<br>
Once  prepared,  this  reagent  should  be  stored<br>
protected  from  light.  The  calibration  curves  were<br>
prepared with glucose as reference product for assaying<br>
     the  glucoamylase  activity  and  for  monitoring  the<br>
35   liquefaction-saccharification reactions, and with xylose<br><br>
9<br>
for measuring the xylanase activity.<br>
One glucoamylase activity unit (GU) corresponds to the quantity of enzyme necessary to release one micromole of reducing ends per minute under the assay conditions<br>
5 	with glucose as reference. The glucoamylase activity, calculated using the formula indicated below, is expressed relative to the quantity of initial dry matter (IDM):<br>
A = (P/Venz) * (Vferm/Mferm) <br>
10     * A is the GA activity expressed in GU.glDM-1 (mmol.min-1.gIDM-1) ,<br>
*	P  is  the  glucose  equivalent  release  rate  in<br>
umol.min"1,<br>
*	Venz is the volume of the enzyme solution assayed<br>
15      in ml,<br>
*	Vferm is the total volume of distilled water used to extract the enzyme solution in ml,<br>
*	Mferm, expressed in g of IDM, is the initial mass of dry product  from  which  the  enzyme  solution was<br>
20      extracted.<br>
b) Protease activity<br>
         	    This assay was developed on azocasein using the<br>
  	Beinon method described in "Protein Purification Methods<br>
- a Practical Approach", Harris E.L.V.  and Angal,  S<br>
25    (Editors),  IRL-Press,  Oxford  University  Press,  1-66<br>
(1989). The degradation of this substrate by proteases<br>
     causes the release of azo groups which absorb UV at<br>
     340 nm.  The variation of the absorbence during the<br>
      kinetics of hydrolysis of this protein indicates the<br>
30    extent of the reaction.<br>
The reaction medium contains:<br>
*	Azocasein solution at 1%, pH 5.0     1000 ml<br>
*	Enzyme solution:	200 ml<br>
The azocasein (Sigma, Saint-Louis, United States) 35   is dissolved in a 0.1 M acetate buffer at pH 5.0. The<br><br>
10<br>
protease activities were assayed at this pH because azocasein is insoluble in this acetate buffer at lower pH values. The enzyme reaction is carried out at 60°C. Samples are collected every 5 min for 20 min and mixed <br>
5   	with 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to stop the reaction.<br>
One protease activity unit (PU) corresponds to the quantity of enzymes necessary for an increase of 0.01 A340™ unit per minute, generated by the release of azo groups under the conditions mentioned above. This <br>
10 	activity, calculated based on the formula indicated below, is expressed relative to the initial dry matter (PU.G-1 IDM) or the glucoamylase activity (PU.GU-1) :<br>
A- (P/Venz)* (Vferm/Mferm)<br>
*	A is the protease activity expressed in PU.glDM-1,<br>
15      * P is the rate of release of the azo groups expressed as an increase of 0.01 unit A340nm.nu.n~1,<br>
*	Venz is the volume of the enzyme solution assayed<br>
in ml,<br>
*	Vferm is the total volume of distilled water used to<br>
20      extract the enzyme solution in ml,<br>
*	Mferm, expressed in g of IDM, is the initial mass of<br>
dry product from which the enzyme solution was<br>
extracted.<br>
c) Xylanase activity <br>
25        	 To  demonstrate  this  enzyme  activity,  the  GA preparations are reacted with a soluble xylan solution and the reducing sugars released were measured by the DNS method.<br>
The reaction medium is composed of:<br>
30	* Xylan solution at 1%, pH 4.5:   900 ml<br>
* Enzyme solution:	100 ml<br>
     The solution of larch xylan  (Sigma at  1%)  is <br>
       prepared in citrate buffer at pH 4.5 and the reaction         <br>
       occurs at 60°C. Samples are collected every 5 min for 20 <br>
35     min, mixed with DNS and placed in an ice bath. They are<br><br>
11<br>
then assayed according to a protocol identical to that presented for the measurement of the GA activities with xylose as reference.<br>
One xylanase activity unit (XU) corresponds to the<br>
5 	quantity of enzymes necessary for the release of one micromole of reducing sugars per minute. This activity is expresssed relative to the initial dry matter (XU.g-1 IDM) or to the glucoamylase activity (XU.GtT1) . To calculate this activity, the formula defined for the calculation of<br>
10   the GA activities is used again, in which:<br>
*	A is the xylanase activity expressed in XU.gIDM"1 (pmol.min"1.gIDM-1) ,<br>
*	P is the rate of release of xylose equivalents in jomol.min-1,<br>
15      * the other terms of the formula are not modified.<br>
The following nonlimiting examples' are given to illustrate the invention. <br>
EXAMPLE 1 - Selection of Aspergillus  strains<br>
The  ability  of  seven  different  commercially<br>
20 	available Aspergillus strains to produce glucoamylase by solid-state fermentation of wheat bran was studied in a comparative manner.<br>
The trials were carried out on 50 g of fermentation medium in an Erlenmeyer flask. The medium consisted of<br>
25 	21.5 g of wheat bran, 27.5 g of water and 1 g of wheat starch. The initial pH of the medium was 6.0-6.5. The medium was sterilized for 20 min in an autoclave at 120°C.<br>
Each medium was inoculated with 2 x 107 spores of<br>
30 	the test strain per gram of initial dry matter. The age of the spores was 3 days. The fermentation was allowed to proceed for 40 to 50 hours, and the Erlenmeyer flasks were placed in an oven at 35 °C. At the end of fermentation, the fermented medium was mixed with 150 ml<br>
35    of distilled water in order to take the enzymes produced<br><br>
12<br>
into solution, and the mixture was then filtered to recover the enzyme solution. The solution was centrifuged to remove the residual particles and spores, and the solution was packaged in 100 ml vials which were stored<br>
5   	at -20°C until the glucoamylase activity was analyzed.<br>
The strains tested and the results obtained are summarized in the following table 1:<br><br>

10 	Note that the A. niger NRRL 3112, A. niger ATCC 76061 and A. oryzae ATCC 22788 strains have the best activities in terms of glucoamylase production.<br>
However,  another important property to be taken into consideration is the stability of the glucoamylase<br>
15 	produced. Tests of heat-stability were therefore carried out by heat treating enzyme solutions at 55 and 60°C for 30 min and measuring the glucoamylase activity at the end of this time. These treatments are similar to the conditions of use for the saccharification of starch.<br>
20 	It was found that the A., niger ATCC 76061 and A. niger NRRL 3112 strains gave the most stable glucoamylase s {100% residual activity after 30 min at 55°C and about 50% residual activity after 30 min at 60°C), whereas the A.   Oryzae     ATCC  22788  and  ATCC  4214 9  strains  gave<br>
25    glucoamylases having 0% residual activity after 30 min at<br><br>
13<br>
60°C and 46% residual activity after 30 min at 55°C. The A. niger ATCC 76061 and NRRL 3112 strains were therefore selected. Moreover, the A. niger NRRL 3112 strain proved to be fairly unstable genetically (loss of activity after <br>
5 	a few reproductive cycles) and so the most preferred strain is the A. niger ATCC 76061 strain. This strain was therefore used in the subsequent examples. <br>
EXAMPLE 2 - Production of glycoamylases in nonsterile 50 1 pilot tanks provided by INRA:  importance of the<br>
10   pretreatment of wheat bran.<br>
The trials were carried out with a 50 1 nonsterile ferment or like that described in the paper by A. DURAND et al., cited above, (figure 1) and BCE wheat bran (provided by  the  distillery  Brie  Champagne  Ethanol,<br>
15 	Provins, France) . Two methods of preparing the bran were used to obtain 5 kg culture medium containing 55% moisture:<br>
• dry bran: the bran is autoclaved for 1 h at 105 °C and then mixed with water (trial F4C3);<br>
20    • moist bran: the bran is moistened to 45% in a kneader and autoclaved for 20 min at 121°C (trial F4C4}.<br>
In both cases, inoculation is carried out with <br>
2 x 107 spores, g-1 DM and the water content of the media is adjusted to about 55%. They are then fermented over a<br>
25 	10 cm bed in aerated tanks. During these cultures, the medium is intermittently streaked using a spatula to reduce its temperature. During the fermentation, the atmosphere is continuously replaced with conditioned air whose  temperature,  moisture  and  flow  rate  are  as<br>
30    indicated in the tables.<br>
The results are presented in tables 2 (trial F4C3) and 3 (trial F4C4).<br>
The data makes it possible to draw several conclusions:<br>
35	- Moistening  the  wheat  bran prior  to  the  heat<br><br>
14<br>
treatment is necessary for an effective production of glucoamylases. Apart from decontamination, heat treatment of the wheat bran probably promotes gelatinization of starch; <br>
5 		- The pH appears to be a good qualitative indicator of the variation of growth and of the production of fungal GA, but without making it possible to estimate the quantity of GA obtained:<br>
-	Moderate stirring of the medium (streaking) does<br>
10   not adversely affect the production of enzymes;<br>
-	The variation in the water content during these<br>
two fermentations indicates considerable drying of the<br>
culture medium, which could be damaging to fungal growth.<br>
EXAMPLE  3:  Production  of  glucoamylases  in  a  pilot<br>
15 	fermentor provided by the company FUJIWARA: importance of maintaining the moisture content of the medium during fermentation.<br>
This trial was carried out with a pilot fermentor sold by the company FUJIWARA, Okayama,  Japan, and BCE<br>
20 	wheat bran. It differs in particular from the fermentor used in example 2 in the diameter of the tank, which is 0.66 m against' 0.35 m for the INRA tanks. In this fermentor, 20 kg of medium containing 55% water prepared according the moist bran method described in example 2<br>
25 	are necessary to carry out a culture on a thickness of 12 cm. The stirring is provided by three continuously rotating vertical lead screws mixing the medium in the tank under rotation (5-10 min/revolution) . During the fermentation, as with the INRA tanks in example 2, the<br>
30 	gaseous atmosphere is continuously replaced with conditioned air whose temperature, moisture and flow rate are as indicated in table 4.<br>
During this trial, called FII, the opportunity for regulating  moisture  content  was  studied.  Localized<br>
35   measurements of the moisture content  of the culture,<br><br>
15<br>
	carried out with an infrared apparatus, and of the mass<br>
of the medium are used to determine the quantity of water<br>
to be added in order to maintain the water content of the<br>
medium above 50%.<br>
5		The results of this FII trial are presented in<br>
table 4,  The  results  obtained  merit  the  following comments:<br>
-	the FII trial clearly indicates that maintaining<br>
the  water  content  between  50  and  55%  promotes  the<br>
10 	production of enzymes with 1600 GU/g DM released after 44 h of fermentation, that is more than double the activity obtained during the F4C2 trial of example 2, which did not have this regulation;<br>
-	stabilizing the production of enzymes from 44 h<br>
15    of  culture  correlated with  the  appearance  of  fungal<br>
spores, shows that it is not necessary to continue the culture beyond this phase;<br>
-	satisfactory regulation of the temperature of the<br>
medium  at  around  35 °C  may  be  obtained  by  a  good<br>
20 	combination of conditioning of the air and stirring of the medium;<br>
-	the culture withstands, with no damage,<br>
intermittent mixing performed by the stirring system of<br>
the FUJIWARA fermentor.<br>
25 	EXAMPLE 4: Production of glucoamylases in a 50 1 stirred INRA pilot fermentor: usefulness of heat pretreatment of the bran with steam and culture under "sterile conditions".<br>
This pilot fermentor is similar to that presented<br>
30 	in WO-A-94 18306 and in figure 4 of the article by A. DURAND et al. cited above. This tool makes it possible to treat the bra n with steam directly in the fermentor, a method of preparation which is preferred at the industrial  level.   The  culture  is  also  prepared,<br>
35    inoculated and carried out under sterile conditions, with<br><br>
16<br>
	the exception of the sample collections, which confers<br>
semisterility  on  this  trial  and  differs  from  the<br>
preceding two examples.<br>
A)- Experimental conditions<br>
5		9 kg of BCE bran premoistened with 1.5 1 of water<br>
are introduced into the fermentor and then sterilized in situ for 20 minutes at 121 °C, with periodic stirring for 5 seconds every 5 minutes. This treatment makes it possible to reach a moisture level of 4 6% which is then<br>
10    adjusted to 55% during inoculation.<br>
The   bran   is   inoculated   with   a   koji-type preparation:<br>
180 g of BCE bran (55% initial moisture) fermented for 4 days at 35°C are mixed with 3 liters of sterilized<br>
15   	water to obtain a suspension of spores which constitutes the inoculum.<br>
The initial fermentation conditions are as follows:<br>
	18.3 kg of culture with 55% moisture and an initial<br>
  pH of 5.7;<br>
20	bed height 40 cm;<br>
aeration rate: 314 l.min"1;<br>
temperature of inlet air: 35°C;<br>
relative humidity of inlet air: 95%.<br>
B) Monitoring fermentation<br>
25	In addition to measuring the pH, the temperature of<br>
the medium, the percentage of dry matter and the production of GA, the variation in the mass of the culture is continuously recorded on the 50 1 stirred fermentor; for the nonsterile reactor, the culture is <br>
30   weighed after 21 h and 42 h of fermentation.<br>
The importance of these measurements of the mass are two-fold:<br>
Maintaining  the.  moisture  during  culture  by<br>
estimating the percentage DM.<br>
35	During fermentation,  two phenomena contribute to<br><br>
17<br>
reducing the mass of the culture; they are:<br>
-	drying of the medium, which is compensated by<br>
supplying water,<br>
-	loss of dry matter, which is linked to the growth<br>
5   of the fungus.<br>
This loss of dry matter is not negligible, 20% DM<br>
being lost in 40 h of culture, that is 0.5% DM per hour<br>
if  linear  losses  are  assumed  for  the  purposes  of<br>
approximation.<br>
10	From  that,  knowing  the  instantaneous  mass  of<br>
culture  (M(t)), it is possible to deduce therefrom the<br>
theoretical percentage of DM at time t, from the formula:<br><br>
IDM(IDM.0.5%) .t<br><br>
%     DMtheoreticai    (t)     =     	     where     IDM     is     the<br>
M(t)<br>
quantity of initial dry matter.<br>
15	When the % DM calculated in this way exceeds 50%,<br>
sterilized water is added to reduce this percentage to 45%. <br>
Expressions of the results per gram of initial DM<br>
The variations in the mass and the percentage of DM<br>
20 	measured make it possible to calculate the loss of real dry matter (LDM expressed in %) during culture. Thus, the quantity of GA expressed thus far in GU. g"1 DM may be expressed as GU.g-1 initial DM using the following formula:<br>
25	(GU.g-1 IDM) = (GU.g-1 DM) . (100-LDM)/100<br>
C) Results<br>
Tables 5 and 6 summarize the operating conditions and the results obtained on steam bran in a stirred reactor.<br>
30	Despite  aerating  the  culture  with  moist un-<br>
saturated air, the drying of the medium is such that it was necessary to readjust its water content when it decreased below 50% on two occasions, as indicated in table 5.<br><br>
18<br>
It was possible to maintain the temperature of the medium at an average value of 35°C by decreasing the inlet air, but in particular by intermittent stirring.<br>
Under these culture conditions, the growth of the<br>
5   fungus, whose progress was monitored by measuring the pH,<br>
is maintained for 60 h and makes it possible to reach a<br>
production of 1436 GU.g"1 DM in 44 h and 1990 GU.g"1 DM in<br>
63 h. Expressed relative to the initial DM, the quantity<br>
of GA produced is 1160 and 1540 GU.g"1 IDM, respectively.<br>
10   For comparison, in the context of example 3, in 44 h of<br>
     culture, 1605 GU.g'1 DM, equivalent to 1067 GU.g-1 IDM was<br>
obtained. This is advantageous because it indicates that<br>
     the productivity of these two trials is identical, but<br>
    that the experimental conditions of example 4 made it<br>
15    possible to prolong the production of enzymes even with a<br>
40 cm bed.<br>
The treatment of the bran with steam followed by fermentation in the 50 1 stirred INRA reactor therefore prolongs  the  fungal  culture  and  the  production  of<br>
20    enzymes.<br>
Expressed relative to the initial DM, the quantity of GA produced is 1540 GU.g-1 IDM.<br>
Assays of xylanase and protease activities were carried out on the same samples. The results obtained are<br>
25    very satisfactory with a maximum, on average, at 50 h of fermentation of<br>
350 XU.g"1 IDM for the xylanases; <br>
400 PU.g"1 IDM for the proteases. <br>
By virtue of the continuous recording of the mass,<br>
30   it was possible to calculate the loss of dry matter during the culture. It is about 23% after 60 h of culture (to within 2% given the accuracy of weighing). <br>
EXAMPLE  5:  Use  of  the  fermented  brans  produced  in example 4 for the hydrolysis of wheat flours <br>
35        A series of saccharifications with the fermented<br><br>
19<br>
brans obtained in example 4 was carried out on wheat flours previously subjected to conventional, enzymatic liquefaction treatment. The glucoamylase preparation AMG 300L® sold by the company NOVO served as a control. These<br>
5 	trials were carried out with a 45-type conventional wheat flour. The operating conditions are summarized in table 7 for 750 g of wort.<br>

During these hydrolyses of wheat flour, three samples of medium were collected each time. The results of concentrations of reducing sugars (RS) at various times of the saccharification presented in table 8 are<br>
15 	the average of these three samples. These assays, carried out by the DNS technique, were carried out on the supernatants of the centrifuged samples. The final viscosity of the saccharified products was also measured.<br><br>

Moreover, an increase was observed in the soluble <br>
5    nitrogen content of the worts after saccharification due to the proteolytic action of the fermented bran.<br>
These results  indicate that the fermented brans produced in example 4 are capable of hydrolyzing wheat flour  with  the  same  efficacy  as  a  standard  GA <br>
10    preparation, regardless of their method of storage.<br>
	The hydrolysis of the flour with fermented bran<br>
also results in a notable reduction in viscosity compared<br>
with a conventional enzymatic preparation.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
15	This  example  illustrates  the  possibility  of<br>
producing a considerable quantity of xylanases and a. small  quantity  of  glucoamylases  with  the Aspergillus niger  strain.<br>
This trial was carried out in a Fujiwara pilot<br>
20 	fermentor with BCE bran and an A. niger Ref. ATCC 201202 strain known for its capacity to produce xylanases. The operation of the pilot fermentor is described in example 3, 20 kg of medium containing 55% moisture, prepared as in example 2, are used in this example. As in <br>
25 	example 3, during the fermentation, the moisture of the medium was maintained above 50% and the temperature of<br><br>
21<br>
the medium regulated at around 35°C.<br>
After 37 hours under these fermentation conditions, the A. niger ATCC 201202 strain produced a fermented bran having 727 XU/g DM and 162 GU/g DM. <br>
5 	EXAMPLE 7: Advantage of incorporating fermented bran according to the invention into a wheat-based poultry feed intended for broilers.<br>
The hemicellulases in wheat flours are known to be partially soluble in water and to increase the viscosity <br>
10    of the intestinal content, thus reducing the release         <br>
      and absorption of nutrients.<br>
It has been demonstrated that the addition of hemicellulases causes degradation of hemicelluloses, thus making it possible to reduce the viscosity of the <br>
15 	intestinal content and to improve the zootechnical performance of monogastric animals such as broilers fed with feed in which the only cereal is wheat.<br>
An experiment was carried out on 1200 Ross broilers to show the advantage of using fermented bran carrying<br>
20 	hemicellulase (xylanase) activity, compared with feed without enzyme and feed containing a standard source of xylanase, the product Avizyme®. Feeds with or without enzyme were prepared so as to feed 4 groups of 300 chicks. Their composition is detailed in table 9. The<br>
25 	growth feeds {GR FE) were used for the first 21 days of breeding and were then replaced with finishing feed (FI FE) for 18 days.<br>

The results of this test after 39 days of breeding 5    are summarized in table 10.<br>

The incorporation of fermented bran into a poultry feed (3 or 5 kg/ton) made it possible significantly to <br>
20 	reduce the feed conversion ratio. Under the trial conditions, the use of a dose of fermented bran greater than 3 kg/ton appears to be of no practical benefit. The improvements observed are comparable to those obtained with the commercial product Avizyme® (0.6 kg/ton). The<br>
25   use of the fermented bran nevertheless has the advantage<br><br>
23<br>
of being less expensive than the use of the commercial enzymatic product.<br>
It  goes  without  saying  that  the  embodiments<br>
described are only examples and they can be modified, in<br>
5   particular  by  substitution  of  technical  equivalents,<br>
without  thereby  departing  from  the  scope  of  the<br>
invention.<br><br>
