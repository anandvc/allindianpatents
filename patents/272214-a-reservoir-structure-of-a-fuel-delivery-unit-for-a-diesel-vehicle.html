				<td>ELEVATED FIRST FILL VALVE IN<br>
SUCTION DIESEL UNITS AND PUMP MODULES<br>
This application claims the benefit of the earlier filing date of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/742,443, filed on December 5, 2005, which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates fuel supply units for diesel fueled vehicles and, more<br>
particularly, to a valve structure in reservoir of a suction diesel unit that is elevated<br>
from a bottom surface of the reservoir.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diesel fuel has the tendency to collect water which potentially will sink to the bottom<br>
of a fuel reservoir of a vehicle and freeze or create a waxing layer under cold<br>
conditions. Such freezing or the creation of a waxing layer may block a primary fill<br>
valve in the bottom of the reservoir and thus prevent a diesel suction unit from<br>
operating with the result being that the vehicle will not prime with fuel.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need provide a fill valve elevated from a reservoir bottom to<br>
ensure priming of a vehicle during cold operating conditions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to fulfill the need referred to above. In<br>
accordance with the principles of the present invention, this objective is obtained by<br>
providing a reservoir structure of a fuel delivery structure for a diesel vehicle. The<br>
reservoir structure includes a fuel reservoir having a bottom surface. A primary fill<br>
opening is provided in the bottom surface for permitting fuel to pass from a fuel tank<br>
of the vehicle into the reservoir. A secondary fill opening is provided in the reservoir<br>
 <br>
and is elevated from the bottom surface. A first valve member is associated with the<br>
primary fill opening to close the primary fill opening under certain pressure<br>
conditions in the reservoir and, under pressure conditions in the reservoir different<br>
from the certain pressure conditions, to permit fuel to enter the reservoir through the<br>
primary fill opening. A second valve member is associated with the secondary fill<br>
opening to close the secondary fill opening under certain pressure conditions in the<br>
reservoir and, under pressure conditions in the reservoir different from the certain<br>
pressure conditions, to permit fuel to enter the reservoir through the secondary fill<br>
opening in the event the primary opening is substantially blocked.<br>
Other objects, features and characteristics of the present invention, as well as the<br>
methods of operation and the functions of the related elements of the structure, the<br>
combination of parts and economics of manufacture will become more apparent<br>
upon consideration of the following detailed description and appended claims with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, all of which form a part of this<br>
specification.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
With reference to FIGs. 1 and 4 a reservoir structure, generally indicated at 10,<br>
includes a reservoir 11 having a primary fill opening 12 in a bottom surface 14<br>
thereof. It is noted that FIG. 1 shows only a bottom portion of the reservoir 11. A<br>
conventional elastomer umbrella-type valve member 13 (FIG. 1a) is associated with<br>
the primary fill opening 12 that permits fuel to be drawn into the reservoir 11 via<br>
suction created by a suction unit having a suction tube 24 (FIG. 4) in the<br>
conventional manner. As noted above, since the primary opening 12 is on the<br>
bottom 14 of the reservoir, ice may form to block the opening 12 and prevent fuel<br>
from entering the reservoir 11 and thus prevent priming of a vehicle engine.<br>
In accordance with the principles of the invention and as best shown in FIGS. 1-3, a<br>
secondary opening (or openings) 16 is provided in the reservoir 10 that is elevated<br>
from the bottom surface 14. As shown in FIG. 3, a conventional elastomer umbrella-<br>
type valve member 18 is coupled to the reservoir via opening 20 and is thus<br>
associated with the opening(s) 16. Thus, the opening 16 and associated valve<br>
member 18 define an elevated fill valve structure 22. The valve members 13 and<br>
18 can be of any configuration that is constructed and arranged to close the<br>
associated opening under certain pressure conditions in the reservoir 10 and under<br>
different pressure conditions in the reservoir, to move or deform to permit fuel to<br>
enter the reservoir 11.<br>
 <br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the fill valve structure 22 ensures that a suction unit (only tube<br>
24 shown) still, will operate and a vehicle will prime since the opening 16 of the fill<br>
valve structure 22 is elevated with respect to bottom surface 14 of the reservoir 11<br>
and thus above ice 23. Thus, the opening 16 is either higher, on the same level as,<br>
or lower than the suction tube 24 of the suction unit inside the reservoir 11. The<br>
exact location of the opening 16 depends on tank geometry. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the opening 16 is at the same height D as the bottom opening 25 of<br>
the suction tube 24 with reference to a bottom surface 26 of a fuel tank.<br>
As best shown in FIGs. 2 and 3, the fill valve structure 22 defines a fuel pocket 19<br>
between the bottom 14 of the reservoir and the bottom 26 of the fuel tank. The<br>
pocket 19 is defined by a step 21 in the bottom 14. The openings 16 communicate<br>
with the pocket 19 and thus the fill valve structure will still function when the primary<br>
valve 13 associated with openings 12 in the reservoir bottom 14 are iced or waxed<br>
up.<br>
Although the fill valve structure 22 is described for use in diesel suction units, the fill<br>
valve structure 22 can be employed in conventional diesel fuel pump modules.<br>
Thus, as shown in FIGs. 5 and 6, the elevated fill valve structure 22 is provided in a<br>
reservoir 31 of a pump module, generally indicated at 30. The module 30 has a fuel<br>
pump 32 that draws fuel from a fuel tank 33 into the reservoir 31. A filter 35 is<br>
associated with the fuel pump 32. The fill valve structure 22 is elevated from the<br>
bottom 34 the swirl pot, and will still function and let diesel fuel pass into the<br>
reservoir 31 when the primary valve (not shown) in the reservoir bottom is iced up or<br>
waxed up. The elevated fill valve structure 22 needs to be positioned slightly below<br>
the pump inlet filter top surface to allow the diesel fuel to get into the pump inlet.<br>
The elevated fill valve structure 22 has been described for use in diesel fuel<br>
applications, but can be employed in reservoirs using any fuels wherein icing may be<br>
an issue.<br>
 <br>
The foregoing preferred embodiments have been shown and described for the<br>
purposes of illustrating the structural and functional principles of the present<br>
invention, as well as illustrating the methods of employing the preferred<br>
embodiments and are subject to change without departing from such principles.<br>
