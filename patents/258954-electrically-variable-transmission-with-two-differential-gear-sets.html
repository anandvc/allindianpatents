ELECTRICALLY-VARIABLE TRANSMISSION WITH TWO DIFFERENTIAL<br>
GEAR SETS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to an electrically-variable transmission that has only<br>
two differential gear sets.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Electrically-variable transmissions typically have an input member<br>
connected to an engine and one or two motor/generators connected to different members<br>
of planetary gear sets to allow one or more electrically-variable modes of operation, fixed<br>
speed ratio modes, and an electric-only (battery powered) mode, when connected with a<br>
battery. Electrically-variable transmissions may improve vehicle fuel economy in a<br>
variety of ways. For instance, the engine may be turned off at idle, during periods of<br>
deceleration and braking, and during periods of low speed or light load operation to<br>
eliminate efficiency losses due to engine drag. Captured braking energy (via regenerative<br>
braking) or energy stored by one of the motors acting as a generator during periods when<br>
the engine is operating is utilized during these engine off periods to keep the engine off<br>
longer, supplement engine torque or power and/or operate at a lower engine speed, or<br>
supplement accessory power supplies. Transient demand for engine torque or power is<br>
supplemented by the motor/generators during operation in engine-on, electrically-<br>
variable modes, allowing for downsizing the engine without reducing apparent vehicle<br>
performance. Additionally, the engine may be operated at or near the optimal efficiency<br>
point for a given power demand because the speed ratio between the engine and the<br>
output member of the transmission can be continuously variable by the action of a gear<br>
set and a motor/generator. Additionally, the motor/generators are very efficient in<br>
accessory power generation and electric power from the battery serves as an available<br>
torque reserve allowing operation at a relatively low transmission numerical speed ratio.<br><br>
2<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	An electrically-variable transmission is provided that uses only two<br>
differential gear sets, two motor/generators, and four torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
that can preferably obtain both an input-split, electrically-variable mode of operation and<br>
an output-split, electrically-variable mode of operation. The differential gear sets are<br>
preferably planetary gear sets, and each has a first, a second, and a third member, which<br>
may include a ring gear member, a carrier member and a sun gear member.<br>
[0004]	The electrically-variable transmission has an input member, which is<br>
operatively connectable to an engine, and an output member, which is operatively<br>
connectable to a final drive mechanism for providing traction on a vehicle. The input<br>
member, the output member, the first motor/generator, and the second motor/generator<br>
are all motive elements for the transmission. Two of these motive elements are each<br>
continuously operatively connected to a respective member of the first differential gear<br>
set and a respective member of the second planetary gear set. By "respective member", it<br>
is meant that each of these two motive elements connects to a different member of each<br>
gear set than the other. The other two motive elements are each selectively operatively<br>
connectable with any respective one of the members of the first differential gear set and<br>
with any respective one of the members of the second differential gear set via the four<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms.<br>
[0005]	The continuous and selective operative connections described above are<br>
chosen so that each member of each differential gear set has at least one of the motive<br>
elements cither continuously or selectively operatively connected therewith, the input<br>
member and one of the motor/generators are both continuously operatively connected or<br>
selectively operatively connectable with the same member of one of the differential gear<br>
sets, and the output member and one of the motor/generators are both continuously<br>
operatively connected or selectively operatively connectable with the same member of<br>
the other differential gear set. The torque-transmitting mechanisms may be selectively<br>
engagable in combinations of two to establish the input-split, electrically-variable mode<br>
and the output-split, electrically-variable mode. Preferably, engagement of all four of the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms establishes a fixed ratio operating mode.<br><br>
3<br>
[0006]	The motor/generator that is continuously operatively connected or<br>
selectively operatively connectable with the same member of one of the differential gear<br>
sets as the input member may be the same or may be different from the motor/generator<br>
that is continuously operatively connected or selectively operatively connectable with the<br>
same member of the other differential gear set as the output member.<br>
[0007]	In one embodiment, neither the input member nor the output member is<br>
continuously operatively connected with any of the members of any of the differential<br>
gear sets. In another embodiment, neither of the motor/generators is continuously<br>
operatively connected with any of the members of either of the differential gear sets.<br>
[0008]	In one embodiment, there are two interconnecting members that each<br>
continuously connects the respective member of the first differential gear set for common<br>
rotation with the respective member of the second differential gear set with which two of<br>
the motive elements are each continuously operatively connected. In this instance, the<br>
differential gear sets may both be planetary gear sets with the input member continuously<br>
operatively connected with the ring gear member of the first planetary gear set, the output<br>
member continuously operatively connected with the ring gear member of the second<br>
planetary gear set, one of the interconnecting members connecting the ring gear member<br>
of the first planetary gear set for common rotation with the carrier member of the second<br>
planetary gear set, and the other interconnecting member connecting the carrier member<br>
of the first planetary gear set for common rotation with the ring gear member of the<br>
second planetary gear set.<br>
[0009]	In one embodiment, if the differential gear sets are both planetary gear<br>
sets, the first torque-transmitting mechanism selectively operatively connects the first<br>
motor/generator with the sun gear member of the first planetary gear set, the second<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism selectively operatively connects the second<br>
motor/generator with the carrier member of the first planetary gear set, the third torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism selectively operatively connects the first motor/generator with<br>
the sun gear member of the second planetary gear set, and the fourth torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism selectively operatively connects the second motor/generator with the carrier<br>
member of the second planetary gear set.<br><br>

the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>

[0016|	FIGURE 6 is a schematic illustration in stick diagram form of one<br>
embodiment of the transmission illustrated in lever diagram form in Figure 4.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0017|	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, Figure 1 illustrates a powertrain 10A having a transmission 14A that<br>
provides an input-split, electrically-variable mode of operation. The transmission 14A<br>
includes a three-node lever 20 representing a first planetary gear set having a first, a<br>
second and a third member, represented by nodes A, B and C, respectively. The<br>
members may be a sun gear member, a carrier member and a ring gear member, although<br>
not necessarily in that order. A transmission input member 16 is connected for rotation<br>
with node C and an output member is connected for rotation with node B.<br><br>
5<br>
[0018]	As used herein, a "node" is a component of a transmission, such as a ring<br>
gear member, a carrier member, or a sun gear member, which is characterized by a<br>
rotational speed and which can act as a junction of torques applied to that component<br>
from other components and by that component to other components. The other<br>
components which may interact with a given node include other coaxial members of the<br>
same set of planetary gears which appear as other nodes on the same lever. The other<br>
components which may interact with a given node also include interconnections to<br>
members of other planetary gear sets which appear as nodes on another lever, a stationary<br>
member such as the transmission case, and other transmission members.<br>
[0019]	The powertrain 10A includes an engine 12 connected with the input<br>
member 16. The engine 12 and input member 16 are connected with node C. A first<br>
motor-generator 18 and a second motor/generator 19 are connected to nodes A and B of<br>
the electrically-variable transmission 14A, respectively. An output member 117 is<br>
connected to node B. The input member 116, output member 177, motor/generator 118,<br>
and motor/generator 119 are four separate motive elements of the transmission 14A, as<br>
each provides motive power to and/or receives motive power from the transmission 14A.<br>
[0020|	Each embodiment of a powertrain and transmission discussed herein has<br>
an electric power source that is operatively connected to the motor/generators such that<br>
the motor/generators may transfer power to or receive power from the power source. A<br>
controller is operatively connected to the electric power source to control the distribution<br>
of power from or to the power source. An electric power source may be one or more<br>
batteries. Other electric power sources, such as fuel cells or capacitors, have the ability to<br>
provide, or store and dispense, electric power and may be used in combination with or in<br>
place of batteries. An electric power source and controller is shown and described with<br>
respect to the embodiment of Figure 6, which is shown in stick-diagram form. The<br>
embodiments of Figures 1-5, which are shown in lever diagram form, also incorporate an<br>
electric power source and controller, although not shown, which are operatively<br>
connected to the motor/generators in like manner as shown in Figure 6.<br>
[0021]	In general, an "input-split" mode uses gearing to split the power flow<br>
through a transmission from an input member to an output member by speed in closest<br><br>
6<br>
association with the input member. That is, in an input-split mode, the speed of the input<br>
member is not directly proportional to the speeds of either of the motor/generators but the<br>
speed of the output member is directly proportional to the speed of a motor/generator. In<br>
the powertrain 10 A, the speed of the input member 16 is directly proportional to the<br>
speed of the engine 12, but is not directly proportional to the speed of either of the<br>
motor/generators 18 and 19. The speed of the output member 17 is directly proportional<br>
to the speed of the second motor/generator 19. The transmission 14A is electrically-<br>
variable in that the speed ratio between the input member 16 and the output member 17 is<br>
determined by the speed of the motor/generator 18.<br>
[0022]	Referring to Figure 2, another powertrain 10B is illustrated that has a<br>
transmission 14B configured to provide an output-split, electrically-variable mode of<br>
operation. In general, an "output-split" mode uses gearing to split the power flow<br>
through a transmission from an input member to an output member by speed in closest<br>
association with both the input member and one of the motor/generators. In other words,<br>
an output-split mode uses gearing to combine the power flow through the transmission<br>
from an input member to an output member by speed in closest association with the<br>
output member. That is, in an output-split mode, the speed of the input member is<br>
directly proportional to the speed of one of the motor/generators but the speed of the<br>
output member is not directly proportional to the speed of a motor/generator.<br>
[0023]	In the powertrain 10B, the transmission 14B includes a three-node lever<br>
30 representing a planetary gear set having a first, a second and a third member,<br>
represented by nodes D, E and F, respectively. The members may be a sun gear member,<br>
a carrier member and a ring gear member, although not necessarily in that order. The<br>
engine 12 and input member 16, as well as motor/generator 19 are operatively connected<br>
with node Fi, so the speed of the input member 16 is directly proportional to the speed of<br>
the motor/generator 19. The motor/generator 18 is connected with node D. The output<br>
member 17 is connected with node F, so the speed of the output member 17 is not<br>
directly proportional to the speed of either motor/generator 18 or 19. The transmission<br>
14B is electrically-variable in that the speed ratio between the input member 16 and the<br>
output member 17 is determined by the speed of the motor/generator 18.<br><br>
7<br>
[0024]	Referring to Figure 3, a powertrain IOC is illustrated that has an<br>
electrically-variable transmission 14C configured to provide both an input-split,<br>
electrically-variable mode of operation and an output-split, electrically-variable mode of<br>
operation. The transmission 14C combines the functionality of the transmission 14A of<br>
Figure 1 and the transmission 14B of Figure 2 by including two planetary gear sets,<br>
represented by levers 20A and 30A, and appropriate connecting members, as discussed<br>
below. The planetary gear set represented by lever 20A has a first, a second and a third<br>
member, represented by nodes Al, Bl and CI, respectively. The members may be a sun<br>
gear member, a carrier member and a ring gear member, although not necessarily in that<br>
order. The planetary gear set represented by lever 30A also has a first, a second and a<br>
third member, represented by nodes Dl, El and Fl, respectively. The members may be a<br>
sun gear member, a carrier member and a ring gear member, although not necessarily in<br>
that order.<br>
[0025]	The transmission 14C includes input member 16 and output member 17,<br>
as well as connecting members 40, 41, 42 (or, alternatively, 42A), 43, 44 and 46. The<br>
connecting members are shown as dashed lines to indicate that they may represent fixed<br>
connections or clutched connections, depending on the specific ratio ranges desired. A<br>
connecting member that is a continuous connection may be referred to herein as an<br>
interconnecting member. It should be noted that the connecting member may be a direct<br>
connection, such as a shaft or hub that does not itself establish a gear ratio, so that the<br>
components operatively connected by the connecting member (i.e., two nodes, a<br>
motor/generator and a node, etc.) rotate at the same speed, or the connecting member<br>
may be an indirect connection through two or more intermeshing gears such that the<br>
components operatively connected by the connecting member rotate at different but<br>
proportionate speeds. Connecting member 42A is shown with shorter dashes to indicate<br>
that it is an alternative to connecting member 42. The connecting members selectively or<br>
continuously operatively connect a node on lever 20A to a node on lever 30A, or connect<br>
a motor/generator 18 or 19 to a node.<br>
[0026|	In order to enable transmission 14C to provide an input-split mode and an<br>
output-split mode, two of the connecting members that each connect two nodes (i.e.,<br><br>
8<br>
interconnecting members 40, 42 (or 42A), 44 and 46) must be selective (clutched)<br>
connections, while the other two may be continuous connections. Each node must be<br>
connected with a connecting member 40, 42 (or 42A), 44 or 46. Additionally, the four<br>
motive elements (i.e., the input member 16, the output member 17, motor/generator 18<br>
and motor/generator 19) must be connected so that two of the four motive elements each<br>
have a connecting member connected to one of the nodes of lever 20A and a connecting<br>
member connected to one of the nodes of lever 30A. The other two motive elements<br>
must each have a clutched connecting member connected to one of the nodes of lever<br>
20A and a clutched connecting member connected to one of the nodes of lever 30A. In<br>
order to provide an input-split electrically-variable mode, on one of the levers 20A, 30A,<br>
the output member 17 and one of the motor/generators must be connected to the same<br>
node. This is satisfied in the transmission 14C by connecting motor/generator 19 and<br>
output member 17 to node B1 (output member 17 is connected via interconnecting<br>
member 46). In order to provide an output-split, electrically-variable mode, on the other<br>
planetary gear set (represented by lever 30A in Figure 3), the input member 16 and one of<br>
the motor/generators must be connected to a single node. This is satisfied by connecting<br>
motor/generator 19 and input member 16 to node El via connecting members 44 and 42,<br>
respectively. If connecting member 42A is provided in lieu of connecting member 42, an<br>
output-split mode is enabled as motor/generator 18 and input member 16 are both<br>
connected to node E1 via connecting members 42A and 44, respectively. Other<br>
placements of connecting members not shown in Figure 3 but satisfying the requirements<br>
set forth in this paragraph may also be utilized, such as those illustrated in powertrain 210<br>
of Figure 5, discussed below.<br>
[0027]	Referring to Figure 4, one embodiment of a powertrain 110 is illustrated in<br>
lever diagram form that has an engine 112 and motor/generators 118 and 119 connected<br>
with a transmission 114. The transmission 114 has two planetary gear sets (represented<br>
by levers 120 and 130) and connecting members arranged similar to those in Figure 3,<br>
satisfying the requirements set forth above in order to provide both an input-split,<br>
electrically-variable operating mode and an output-split, electrically-variable operating<br>
mode. The planetary gear set represented by lever 120 has a first, a second and a third<br><br>
9<br>
member, represented by nodes A2, B2 and C2, respectively. The members may be a sun<br>
gear member, a carrier member and a ring gear member, although not necessarily in that<br>
order. The planetary gear set represented by lever 130 also has a first, a second and a<br>
third member, represented by nodes D2, E2 and F2, respectively. The members may be a<br>
sun gear member, a carrier member and a ring gear member, although not necessarily in<br>
that order.<br>
[0028]	The transmission 114 includes an input member 116, an output member<br>
117, as well as connecting members 140, 141, 142, 143, 144 and 146. The input member<br>
116, output member 117, motor/generator 118, and motor/generator 119 are four separate<br>
motive elements of the transmission 114. The input member 116 continuously<br>
operatively connects engine 112 with node C2. Output member 117 is continuously<br>
operatively connected with node F2. Engagement of a torque-transmitting mechanism<br>
154, which is a rotating-type clutch, enables connecting member 140 to provide a<br>
clutched connection between motor/generator 118 and node D2. Engagement of a<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism 150, which is a rotating-type clutch, enables connecting<br>
member 141 to provide a clutched connection between motor/generator 118 and node A2.<br>
Engagement of a torque-transmitting mechanism 156, which is a rotating-type clutch,<br>
enables connecting member 142 to provide a clutched connection between<br>
motor/generator 119 and node E2. Engagement of a torque-transmitting mechanism 152,<br>
which is a rotating-type clutch, enables connecting member 143 to provide a clutched<br>
connection between motor/generator 119 and node B2. Connecting member 144<br>
provides a continuous (unclutched) connection between nodes C2 and E2, and may be<br>
referred to as an interconnecting member. Similarly, connecting member 146 provides a<br>
continuous (unclutched) connection between nodes B2 and F2, and may also be referred<br>
to as an interconnecting member.<br>
Input-Split, Electrically-Variable Mode<br>
[0029]	The transmission 114 is operable to provide an input-split, electrically-<br>
variable mode of operation by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 150 and 152.<br>
Engagement of torque-transmitting mechanisms 150 and 152 operatively connects<br>
motor/generators 118 and 119 with nodes A2 and B2, respectively. Torque-transmitting<br><br>
10<br>
mechanisms 154 and 156 remain open (i.e., not engaged and not transmitting torque).<br>
Because interconnecting member 146 continuously operatively connects node F2 and the<br>
output member 117 with node B2, motor/generator 118, motor/generator 119, engine<br>
112, input member 116 and output member 117 are operatively connected with nodes A2,<br>
B2 and C2 in the same configuration as illustrated with respect to corresponding<br>
components in Figure 1, and an input-split, electrically-variable operating mode is<br>
established.<br>
Output-Split, Electrically-Variable Mode<br>
10030]	The transmission 114 is operable to provide an output-split, electrically-<br>
variable mode of operation by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 154 and 156.<br>
Engagement of torque-transmitting mechanisms 154 and 156 operatively connects<br>
motor/generators 118 and 119 with nodes D2 and E2, respectively. Torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 150 and 152 remain open (i.e., not engaged and not transmitting torque).<br>
Because interconnecting member 144 continuously operatively connects node C2 and the<br>
input member 116 with node li2, motor/generator 118, motor/generator 119, engine 112,<br>
input member 116 and output member 117 are operatively connected with nodes D2, E2<br>
and F2 in the same configuration as illustrated with respect to corresponding components<br>
in Figure 2, and an output-split, electrically-variable operating mode is established. hinstead of connecting member 142, a clutched connecting member were provided<br>
between motor/generator 118 and node E2 that provided an operative connection by<br>
engagement of a torque-transmitting mechanism provided in lieu of torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism 156, then an output-split mode would be provided by engagement of torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism 154 and the alternate torque-transmitting mechanism. In that<br>
instance, motor/generator 118 and input member 116 would both be operatively<br>
connected to node E2 to establish the output-split mode, while the common connection of<br>
motor/generator 119 and output member 117 to node F2 would still establish the input-<br>
split mode, as described above.<br>
Fixed Ratio Operating Mode<br>
[0031]	The transmission 114 establishes a fixed ratio operating mode when all<br>
four torque-transmitting mechanisms 150, 152, 154 and 156 are engaged. In that<br><br>
11<br>
instance, nodes E2 and F2 would both be operatively connected with motor/generator<br>
1 19. When any two nodes of a three-node lever (and, therefore, any two members of the<br>
planetary gear set the lever represents) rotate at the same speed, then the entire planetary<br>
gear set rotates at the same speed, as is known. Thus, if all of the connecting members<br>
are direct connections that do not establish a gear ratio between the connected members<br>
of the planetary gear sets represented by levers 20A and 30A, then with all nodes of lever<br>
130 rotating at the same speed, and with all torque-transmitting mechanisms 150, 152,<br>
154 and 156 engaged, all nodes of lever 120 will also rotate at the same speed, and a<br>
direct drive (fixed ratio of 1.0) will be established. If one or more of the connecting<br>
members establishes a gear ratio between the connected members of the planetary gear<br>
sets represented by levers 20A and 30A, then the resulting fixed ratio between the input<br>
member 116 and the output member 117 may have a numerical value other than 1.0. The<br>
transmission may shift between the input-split mode and compound-split mode at this<br>
fixed ratio with essentially zero relative speeds across all of the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 150, 152, 154 and 156, so that they do not need to slip and absorb energy,<br>
while at the same time power delivery is maintained between the input member 16 and<br>
the output member 17.<br>
[0032]	Referring to Figure 5, an alternative embodiment of a powertrain 210<br>
having an electrically-variable transmission 214 and two planetary gear sets represented<br>
by levers 220 and 230 is shown that conforms with the requirements described with<br>
respect to Figure 3 to provide an input-split, electrically-variable operating mode as well<br>
as an output-split, electrically-variable operating mode. The powertrain 210 has an<br>
engine 212 and motor/generators 218 and 219 connected with transmission 214. The<br>
transmission 214 is illustrated in lever diagram form and has two planetary gear sets<br>
(represented by levers 220 and 230) and connecting members arranged similar to those in<br>
Figure 3, satisfying the requirements set forth above in order to provide both an input-<br>
split, electrically-variable operating mode and an output-split, electrically-variable<br>
operating mode. The planetary gear set represented by lever 220 has a first, a second and<br>
a third member, represented by nodes A3, B3 and C3, respectively. The members may<br>
be a sun gear member, a carrier member and a ring gear member, although not<br><br>
12<br>
necessarily in that order. The planetary gear set represented by lever 230 also has a first,<br>
a second and a third member, represented by nodes D3, E3 and F3, respectively. The<br>
members may be a sun gear member, a carrier member and a ring gear member, although<br>
not necessarily in that order.<br>
[0033]	The transmission 214 includes an input member 216, an output member<br>
217, as well as connecting members 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, and 246. The input<br>
member 216, output member 217, motor/generator 218, and motor/generator 219 are four<br>
separate motive elements of the transmission 214. Connecting member 240 continuously<br>
operatively connects node A3 with node D3, and therefore may be referred to as an<br>
interconnecting member. Connecting member 242 continuously operatively connects<br>
node B3 with node E3 and may also be referred to as an interconnecting member.<br>
Motor/generators 218 and 219 are continuously operatively connected to nodes A3 and<br>
B3, respectively. Neither the input member 216 nor the output member 217 is<br>
continuously operatively connected with any of the nodes; instead, clutched connections<br>
are provided. Engagement of torque-transmitting mechanism 250, which is a rotating-<br>
type clutch, enables the input member 216 to provide a clutched connection between<br>
engine 212 and node C3. Engagement of torque-transmitting mechanism 254, which is a<br>
rotating-type clutch, enables connecting member 244 to provide a clutched connection<br>
between input member and node E3. Engagement of a torque-transmitting mechanism<br>
252, which is a rotating-type clutch, enables connecting member 246 to provide a<br>
clutched connection between output member 217 and node B3. Engagement of a torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism 256, which is a rotating-type clutch, provides a clutched<br>
connection between output member 217 and node F3. Thus, the input member 216 and<br>
the output member 217 are each selectively operatively connectable to a respective node<br>
of each lever 220, 230, while the motor/generators 218 and 219 are each continuously<br>
operatively connected with a respective node of each lever 220, 230.<br>
Input-Split, Electrically-Variable Mode<br>
[0034]	The transmission 214 is operable to provide an input-split, electrically-<br>
variable mode of operation by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 250 and 252.<br>
Engagement of torque-transmitting mechanisms 250 and 252 operatively connects the<br><br>
13<br>
input member 216 and the output member 217 with nodes C3 and B3, respectively.<br>
Torque-transmitting mechanisms 254 and 256 remain open (i.e., not engaged and not<br>
transmitting torque). Because the motor/generators 218 and 219 are continuously<br>
operativcly connected with nodes A3 and B3, respectively, motor/generator 218,<br>
motor/generator 219, engine 212, input member 216 and output member 217 are<br>
operativcly connected with nodes A3, B3 and C3 in the same configuration as illustrated<br>
with respect to corresponding components in Figure 1, and an input-split electrically-<br>
variable operating mode is established.<br>
Output-Split, Electrically-Variable Mode<br>
[0035]	The transmission 214 is operable to provide an output-split, electrically-<br>
variable mode of operation by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 254 and 256.<br>
Engagement of torque-transmitting mechanisms 254 and 256 operatively connects the<br>
input member 216 and the output member 217 with nodes E3 and F3, respectively.<br>
Torque-transmitting mechanisms 250 and 252 remain open (i.e., not engaged and not<br>
transmitting torque). Because interconnecting member 242 continuously operatively<br>
connects node B3 and the motor/generator 219 with node E3, motor/generator 218,<br>
motor/generator 219, engine 212, input member 216 and output member 217 are<br>
operativcly connected with nodes D3, E3 and F3 in the same configuration as illustrated<br>
with respect to corresponding components in Figure 2, and an output-split, electrically-<br>
variable operating mode is established.<br>
Fixed Ratio Operating Mode<br>
[0036]	The transmission 214 establishes a fixed ratio operating mode when all<br>
four torque-transmitting mechanisms 250, 252, 254 and 256 are engaged. In that<br>
instance, nodes F3, E3 and B3 would be operatively connected for common rotation with<br>
output member 217, and nodes C3, B3 and E3 would be operatively connected for<br>
common rotation with the input member 217. When any two nodes of a three-node lever<br>
(and, therefore, any two members of the planetary gear set the lever represents) rotate at<br>
the same speed, then the entire planetary gear set rotates at the same speed, as is known.<br>
Thus, if all of the connecting members are direct connections that do not establish a gear<br>
ratio between the connected members of the planetary gear sets represented by levers<br><br>
14<br>
220, 230, then with all nodes of lever 230 rotating at the same speed, and with all torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms 250, 252, 254 and 256 engaged, all nodes of lever 220 will also<br>
rotate at the same speed, and a direct drive (fixed ratio of 1.0) will be established. If one<br>
or more of the connecting members establishes a gear ratio between the connected<br>
members of the planetary gear sets represented by levers 220, 230, then the resulting<br>
fixed ratio between the input member 216 and the output member 217 may have a<br>
numerical value other than 1.0.<br>
[0037]	Referring to Figure 6, an alternative embodiment of a powertrain 310<br>
having an electrically-variable transmission 314 and two planetary gear sets 320 and 330<br>
is shown that conforms with the requirements described with respect to Figure 3 to<br>
provide an input-split, electrically-variable operating mode as well as an output-split,<br>
electrically-variable operating mode. The powertrain 310 has the same continuous and<br>
selective operative connections as the powertrain 110 of Figure 4. The powertrain 310<br>
has an engine 312, an input member 316, an output member 317, and motor/generators<br>
318 and 319 connected with transmission 314. The input member 316, the output<br>
member 317 and the motor/generators 318 and 319 are four separate motive elements of<br>
the transmission 314. The transmission 314 has two planetary gear sets 320 and 330 and<br>
connecting members arranged similar to those in Figure 3, satisfying the requirements set<br>
forth above in order to provide both an input-split, electrically-variable operating mode<br>
and an output-split, electrically-variable operating mode.<br>
|0038)	The planetary gear set 320 has a ring gear member 324, a sun gear<br>
member 322 and a carrier member 326 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears<br>
327 that mesh with both the sun gear member 322 and the ring gear member 324.<br>
[0039]	The planetary gear set 330 has a ring gear member 334, a sun gear<br>
member 332 and a carrier member 336 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears<br>
337 that mesh with both the sun gear member 332 and the ring gear member 334.<br>
[0040]	The engine 312 is continuously operatively connected with the input<br>
member 316 and with the carrier member 336. Additionally, because interconnecting<br>
member 344 continuously connects the ring gear member 324 with the carrier member<br>
336, the input member 316 is also continuously operatively connected with the ring gear<br><br>
15<br>
member 324. The output member 317 is continuously operatively connected with the<br>
ring gear member 334. Additionally, because interconnecting member 346 continuously<br>
connects ring gear member 334 with carrier member 326, the output member 317 is also<br>
continuously operatively connected with the carrier member 326. The output member<br>
317 is a gear that intermeshes with a final drive mechanism 321 to transfer torque thereto.<br>
[0041]	The motor/generators 318 and 319 may receive electrical power from or<br>
provide electrical power to an energy storage device 382 such as a battery. An electronic<br>
controller 384 is in signal communication with the battery 382 and with a power inverter<br>
386 that is also in electrical communication with stator portions of the motor/generators<br>
318,319, shown grounded to a stationary member 380 such as a casing of the<br>
transmission 314. The controller 384 responds to a variety of input signals including<br>
vehicle speed, operator demand, the level at which the battery 382 is charged and the<br>
power being provided by the engine 312 to regulate the flow of power between the<br>
motor/generators 318, 319 and the battery 382 via the inverter 386, which converts<br>
between direct current provided or utilized by the battery 382 and alternating current<br>
provided or utilized by the stator portions of the motor/generators 318, 319.<br>
|0042|	The motor/generator 318 is selectively operatively connected with the sun<br>
gear member 322 by engagement of torque-transmitting mechanism 350. The<br>
motor/generator 318 includes a rotor portion that rotates with shaft 360. Connecting<br>
member 341, which is a gear, rotates about the shaft 360 and is connected for rotation<br>
therewith by engagement of torque-transmitting mechanism 350. Connecting member<br>
341 continuously meshes with a gear 361 that rotates commonly with sun gear member<br>
322.<br>
[0043]	The motor/generator 319 is selectively operatively connected with the<br>
carrier member 326 by engagement of torque-transmitting mechanism 352. The<br>
motor/generator 319 includes a rotor portion that rotates with shaft 362. Connecting<br>
member 343, which is a gear, rotates about the shaft 362 and is connected for common<br>
rotation therewith by engagement of torque-transmitting mechanism 352. Connecting<br>
member 343 continuously meshes with output member 317, and is thereby connected for<br><br>
16<br>
common rotation with carrier member 326 and ring gear member 334 when the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism 352 is engaged.<br>
[0044]	The motor/generator 318 is selectively operatively connected with sun<br>
gear member 332 by engagement of torque-transmitting mechanism 354. Connecting<br>
member 340, which is a gear, rotates about shaft 360 and is connected for common<br>
rotation therewith by engagement of torque-transmitting mechanism 354. Connecting<br>
member 340 continuously meshes with gear 363, which rotates commonly with sun gear<br>
member 332.<br>
[0045]	The motor/generator 319 is selectively operatively connected with the<br>
carrier member 336, as well as the ring gear member 324 and the input member 316 by<br>
engagement of torque-transmitting mechanism 356. Connecting member 342, which is a<br>
gear, rotates about shaft 362 and is connected for common rotation therewith by<br>
engagement of torque-transmitting mechanism 356. Connecting member 342<br>
continuously meshes with gear 365, which rotates commonly with the input member 316,<br>
the ring gear member 324, and the carrier member 336.<br>
[0046]	In comparison with the transmission 114 in Figure 4, the ring gear<br>
member 324 corresponds with node C2; the carrier member 326 corresponds with node<br>
132; the sun gear member 322 corresponds with node A2; the ring gear member 334<br>
corresponds with node F2; the carrier member 336 corresponds with node E2; and the sun<br>
gear member 332 corresponds with node D2.<br>
Input-Split, Electrically-Variable Mode<br>
[0047]	The transmission 314 is operable to provide an input-split, electrically-<br>
variable mode of operation by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 350 and 352.<br>
Engagement of torque-transmitting mechanisms 350 and 352 operatively connects<br>
motor/generators 318 and 319 with the sun gear member 322 and with the carrier member<br>
326, respectively. Torque-transmitting mechanisms 354 and 356 remain open (i.e., not<br>
engaged and not transmitting torque). Because interconnecting member 346<br>
continuously operatively connects ring gear member 334 and the output member 317<br>
with carrier member 326, the motor/generator 318, motor/generator 319, engine 312,<br>
input member 316 and output member 317 are operatively connected with the ring gear<br><br>
17<br>
member 324, sun gear member 322 and carrier member 326, which correspond with<br>
nodes C2, B2 and A2 of Figure 4, and with nodes C, B and A of Figure 1, respectively, in<br>
the same configuration as illustrated with respect to corresponding components in Figures<br>
1 and 4, and an input-split, electrically-variable operating mode is established.<br>
Output-Split, Electrically-Variable Mode<br>
[0048]	The transmission 314 is operable to provide an output-split, electrically-<br>
variable mode of operation by engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms 354 and 356.<br>
Engagement of torque-transmitting mechanisms 354 and 356 operatively connects<br>
motor/generators 318 and 319 with sun gear member 332 and carrier member 336, which<br>
correspond with nodes D2 and E2, respectively, in Figure 4. Torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 350 and 352 remain open (i.e., not engaged and not transmitting torque).<br>
Because interconnecting member 344 continuously operatively connects ring gear<br>
member 324 and carrier member 336 with the input member 316, the motor/generator<br>
318, motor/generator 319, engine 312, input member 316 and output member 317 are<br>
operatively connected with the sun gear member 332, carrier member 336 and ring gear<br>
member 334 in the same configuration as illustrated with respect to corresponding nodes<br>
D, E and F in Figure 2 and corresponding nodes D2, E2 and F2 in Figure 4, respectively,<br>
and an output-split, electrically-variable operating mode is established.<br>
Fixed Ratio Operating Mode<br>
[0049]	The transmission 314 establishes a fixed ratio operating mode when all<br>
four torque-transmitting mechanisms 350, 352, 354 and 356 are engaged. In that<br>
instance, ring gear member 334 and carrier member 336 would both be operatively<br>
connected with motor/generator 319. When any two members of a planetary gear set<br>
rotate at given speeds, then the speeds for the members of the entire planetary gear set are<br>
given, as is known in the art. Thus, with input member 316 rotating at a given speed, and<br>
with all torque-transmitting mechanisms 350, 352, 354 and 356 engaged, the speeds of all<br>
members of planetary gear sets 320 and 320 will be given, and a fixed ratio between the<br>
input member 316 and the output member 317 will be established.<br>

motor/generator and the output member is continuously operatively connected with the<br>
member of the second planetary gear set with which the other of the two interconnecting<br>
members is also continuously connected;<br>
four selectively engagable torque-transmitting mechanisms, two of which<br>
selectively operatively connect one of the first motor/generator, the second<br>
motor/generator, the input member and the output member not continuously connected<br>
with either of the interconnecting members with a member of the first planetary gear set<br>
and a member of the second planetary gear set, respectively, and the other two of which<br>
selectively operatively connect a different one of the first motor/generator, the second<br>
motor/generator, the input member and the output member not continuously connected<br>
with either of the interconnecting members with a different member of the first planetary<br>
gear set and a different member of the second planetary gear set, respectively; wherein<br>
the torque-transmitting mechanisms are selectively engagable in pairs to establish a first<br>
and a second electrically variable operating mode; and wherein the first electrically-<br>
variable operating mode is an input-split operating mode and the second electrically-<br>
variable operating mode is a compound-split operating mode.<br><br>
An electrically-variable transmission having two differential gear sets and<br>
two motor/generators uses four torque-transmitting mechanisms and selective as well as<br>
continuous connecting members and preferably provides an input-split operating mode<br>
and an output-split operating mode.<br></td>
