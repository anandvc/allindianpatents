				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to heating, ventilation and an conditioning (HVAC), and, more specifically, to an energy-efficient system for optimizing indoor air quality.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The build-up of indoor air pollutants and the ability of the ventilation system to eliminate these indoor air pollutants affect the quality of air in the indoor environment. Although health and thermal comfort can usually be addressed by attempting to eliminate the various sources of indoor pollutants, it is almost impossible to totally eliminate them. It is thus inevitable that ventilation with fresh air should play an important role in the eventual quality of the air in the indoor environment, hi the design of ventilation systems, it is not sufficient to ensure an adequate provision of total fresh air quantity at the fresh air intake of an air-handling unit (AHU) but it is equally important to consider the related ventilation characteristics.  It is essential that<br>
the fresh air reaches the localized “breathing zone” of  the various occupied zones served by the particular AHU in the correct proportion and maintains the desirable local air exchange effectiveness characteristics at all times. As the occupancy profile in various localized zones of an indoor environment can change quite significantly during the course of operation of an AHU on a daily basis, it becomes necessary to incorporate the response of ventilation system to such dynamically changing profiles to ensure adequate ventilation provision at all times without excessive energy consumption. This is particularly true in the context of tropical climates.<br>
Conventional designs of air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation systems resort to mixing of the centralized fresh air intake and the return air before being treated by the cooling coil and subsequently distributed to the various occupies zones as “mixed air”. The disadvantage of such designs, particularly with variable –air-volume (VAV) system, is fairly well established, resulting in complaints of inadequate ventilation leading to perceptions of staleness and stuffiness. Such complaints are inevitable due to the inability of these typical designs of VAVsystems to maintain adequate fresh air distribution to the dynamically changing occupancy and "other" space load proiiles since any reduction of total supply air flow results in a reduction of fresh air quantity.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
US Patent 5,673,851 (Dozier et al.) discloses a variable-air-volume diffuser with an induction air assembly. As described in the Dozier patent, the air in a room is conditioned and ventilated with two separate duct systems, a first carrying conditioned air from a heater or air conditioner and a second carrying fresh air ("ventilation air"). The conditioned air enters the room through a diffuser. lire ventilation air is discharged through an air induction nozzle and blows past a temperature sensor that, in turn, controls the flow of conditioned air. The flow rate of conditioned air is regulated by virtue of a movable flow control element located in the diffuser.<br>
US Patent 3,934,795 (Ginn et a!.) discloses a dual duct variable volume air conditioning system. As described in the Ginn patent, the air in a room is conditioned using two independent ducts, a first supplying cold air and a second ("reset duct") supplying either hot or cold air. Flow through each duct is regulated by valves which are opened and closed by a self-contained system regulator in response to changes in room temperature. Each duct also has a pressure-responsive<br>
2	sensor-actuator for sensing flow velocity in the duct and adjusting the valve                 positions through a direct mechanical linkage However, certain drawbacks are evident from the prior art designs.The prior art HVAC system have failed to provide a system fro suppling for supplying both primary outside air (required for ventilation) and secondary return air (required for offsetting thermal loads) in such a way that indoor air quality at various locations inside a building and overall energy efficiency are optimized.  Current state-of-the-art variable-air volume HVAC system, which are popular in the tropics, have significant cooling and dehumidifying requirements.  These systems typically employ floor-by-floor Air Handling Units (AHUS). A single VAV fan is designed to distribute air throughout the various zones of a building. The prior art designs usually suffer from inadequate fresh air ventilation in the localized zones since the fresh air damper is also throttled when the volumetric flow rate is reduced in a VAV system at lower thermal loading conditions.<br>
Thus, there is a need in the art for an improved HVAC s&gt;stem that overcomes the foregoing deficiencies.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an energy-efficient HVAC system having zonal ventilation control for controlling the indoor air quality (IAQ) at various locations of a building.<br>
As embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention provides aventilation and air conditioning system for providing zonal cooling and ventilation, said system comprising an air-handling unit for distributing air throughout a building or structure, said air-handling unit having a first intake for channeling fresh air to a heat-exchanging device capable of producing conditioned fresh air; a first fan for moving said conditioned fresh air through a fresh air duct; a second intake for channeling recycled air to a heat-exchanging device capable of producing conditioned recycled air; and a second fan for moving said conditioned recycled air through a recycled air duct; said system also comprising a mixing chamber connected to a distal end of said fresh air duct and also connected to a distal end of said recycled air duct, said mixing chamber being an enclosure for mixing the conditioned fresh air and the conditioned recycled air Subsequent ventilation into a nearby space.The system described herein provides efficient air distribution, especially in high-rise air-conditioned buildings, while at the same time ensuring excellent ventilation.  The significant advantage of the invention over current state-of-the-art systems is that the provision of fresh air at each of the localized zones is a function only of the occupant density (as sensed by its own localized CO2 sensor) and is not affected by any variation in thermal loads. This will then ensure that adequate ventilation and acceptable indoor air quality is maintained in all the individual zones at all time. Thus, the HVAC system of the present invention provides optimal amounts of fresh and conditioned air to different rooms or offices in the same building. By mixing the supplies of fresh and conditioned air on location, i,e., at the point of final distribution, different rooms in the same building can receive tailored air supply depending on the local thermal load and occupancy profile.<br>
  Preferably, the HVAC system comprises a single-coil twin-fan air-handling<br>
            unit.  <br>
A single-coil twin-fan AHU enables the simultaneous conditioning of two separate air streams without mixing in the downstream section of die coil. The single-coil twin-fan design facilitates the treatment of fresh and return air streams separately (using separate fans which are independently and separately controlled) so as to achieve optimal dehumidifying performance on the fresh air stream (which is predominantly latent cooling) and optimal cooling performance on the return air stream (which is predominantly sensible cooling). Another key advantage of the overall system concept is the ability to achieve the desired cooling and dehumidifying performance in a rather independent manner using a single coil. A single coil can be installed in one air-handling unit with suitable modifications to the airways. Usually, a simple sheet-metal barrier will suffice to separate the fresh and the return air streams. By using a smgle coil with a single chilled water feed, the intermediate return and supply manifolds between the fresh air coil and return air coil are no longer required, resulting in fewer components and less cost. Tlus would also mean that the AHU would occupy less space in the building.<br>
Other objects and features of the invention will become apparent by reference to the following description and the drawings.<br>

They are not intended to be a definition of the limits of the invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to Figure 1, an HVAC system denoted generally by the reference numeral 2 for ventilating and conditioning the air in a building 4 has an air-handling unit (AHU) 5 which comprises two separate variable-air-volume (VAV) systems 6, 8. The first VAV system 6 draws in fresh air from outside through a fresh air intake 10. The fresh air intake 10 has a diffuser 11 which expands and slows the fresh air for maximal heat transfer. The fresh air is first filtered through a fresh air filter 14 and then cooled and dehumidified by a fresh air coil 18. The fresh air coil 18 is a heat-exchanging coil with a single feed of chilled water. A fresh air fan 22 moves the conditioned fresh air downstream through a fresh air duct 26 to a fresh air VAV box 30. The fresh air VAV box 30 is connected to a mixing box 38 into which the fresh air may flow. A fresh air damper 31 regulates the flow of conditioned fresh air into a mixing chamber 39 which is a portion of the mixing box 38,<br>
The second VAV system 8 draws recycled air from inside the building through a recycled air intake 12. The recycled air intake 12 has a diffuser 13 to expand and slow the recycled air for maximal heat transfer. The recycled air is first filtered through a recycled air filter 16 and then cooled and dehumidified by a recycled air coil 20, which functions as a heat exchanger. The 5	recycled air coil is a heat-exchanging coil with a single feed of chilled water. A recycled air fan 24 moves the conditioned recycled air downstream  through a recycled air duct 28 to a recycled air VAV box 32. The recycled air VAV box 32 is connected to the mixing box 38 into which the recycled air may flow. A recycled air damper 33 regulates the flow of conditioried recycled air into the mixing chamber 39 of the mixing box 38.<br>
A feedback control system, which is managed which is managed by a    central processing unit (CPU) 54, controls the operation of the HVAC system 2. The CPU 54 computes optimal fan speeds and damper openings based on temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) readings from sensors located at various places in the building 4.<br>
Referring still to Figure 1, the return air duct 46 of the said zone contains the carbon dioxide and temperature sensor 34 and 36 near the return air grille 44. The carbon dioxide sensor 34 and the temperature sensor 36 are linked via wires 55 (or cables) to the central processing unit (CPU) 54 of the control system. The sensors 34 and 36 wouldprovide signals to                                    <br>
determine optimal damper opening and fan speeds. In this regard, the carbon dioxide sensor controls the fresh air damper in the fresh air VAV box 30 and trie temperature sensor 36 controls the recycled air damper in the recycled air VAV box 32. The CPU 54 computes the optimal damper openings for the fresh air damper 31 and the recycled air damper 33 so that the optimal mixture of fresh and recycled air flows into a mixing chamber 39 in the mixing box 38. The CPU 54 also regulates the fan velocity of each VAV system to vary the overal i cooling and ventilation in accordance with total building demand. The CPU 54 controls the fan speed on the first VAV system 6 and on the second VAV system 8. The CPU 54 also receives feedback signals from a fresh air temperature sensor 56, a humidity sensor 57 and a recycled air temperature sensor 58.<br>
Accordingly, conditioned fresh air and conditioned recycled air are mixed in me mixing box 38 in accordance with the local cooling and ventilation requirements. The mixing box 38 preferably functions as a plenum chamber. A plenum chamber is an enclosed space in which me air pressure is greater than mat in die outside atmosphere. Air is thus forced into tie mixing box 38 (plenum chamber) for slow distribution through a localized diffuser vent 40.<br>
As noted above, the mixed air is vented through a diffuser vent 40 into a room 42 (or office or building zone). The room 42 also has a return vent 44, which draws rdom air into a return air duct 46. A return fan 48 is provided to assist the return flow of the recycled air back to the second VAV system 8. The return air duct 46 bifurcates into an exhaust vent 50 and the<br>
recycle air intake 12. A Controllable danmper 52 is located at the bifurcation of the return air<br>
duct 46. The damper 52 can be controlled to divert a variable amount of recycled air back to the second VAV system 8, i.e., into the recycled air intake 12. The CPU 54 controls the damper 52 to alleviate air pressure build-up when large volumes of fresh air are ventilated into the svstem. By virtue of this remote, "localized" mixing in the mixing box 38, cooling and ventilation can be optimized and tailored according to the local thermal loads and the local occupancy profile. By mixing the two streams of air in the mixing box 38 in, or adjacent to, the zone to be cooied and ventilated, the svstem can achieve zonal ventilation control without sacrificing cnert'v efficiency. With the locally mixed air, the system can ensure that there is- adequate cooling to deal with localized thermal loads as well as proper ventilation in areas where the air would otherwise be considered uncomfortably stale or stuffy. The system not only ensures excellent Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) but it is capable of doing so with a single air-handling unit 5, although more than one AHU would be used for larger buildings. As illustrated in Figure 2, the HVAC system 2 is capable of distributing two separate air streams (one of conditioned fresh air and another of conditioned recycled air) to various mixing boxes 38 located in different places in the building 4. Thus, the HVAC system 2 is capable of cooling and dehumidifying different rooms 42 (or offices or zones of a building) in accordance with localized requirements. Although Figure 2 shows a single AHU 5 for ventilating and conditioning the air in the building 4, it should be understood that more man one AHU 5 may be required depending on the size, location and occupancy profile of the building 4.<br>
It is to be noted that the description of the preferred embodiment so far refers to the use of twin VAV systems, which leads to significant energy saving potential. As an option, it would also be possible to employ twin Constant Air Volume (CAV) systems or even a hybrid system consisting of a VAV and a CAV system. In the latter option, the air stream whose load characteristics are constant could be a CAV system while the air stream with significantiy varying load characteristics could be a VAV system. The CPU 54 controls the cooling and ventilation functions by regulating the opening and closing of the dampers 31,33, and the return damper 52.<br>
The preferred embodiment described herein and shown in Figure 2 conditions and distributes two air streams throughout the multiple zones of an air-conditioned building such that<br>
adequate ventilation, and consequently, acceptable indoor air quality (IAQ) is ensured throughout the operating range of the VAV ayoicuis 6,3. The overall systeai performance is significantly enhanced in conjunction with a single-coil twin-fan variable-air-volume system ("SCTF-VAV). Employing an SCTF-VAV permits optimal cooling and dehumidifying performance of fresh and return air streams using only a single coil with a single feed of chilled water flow but with two completely isolated air streams. Thus, the fresh air coil 18 and the recycled air coil 20 would be merged into a single heat-exchanging coil. But, by virtue of two separate ducts, the fresh air and me recycled air are maintained as independent and separate air streams upstream, through and downstream of the coil.<br>
As illustrated by the simplified schematic in Figure 3, the HVAC system 2 may employ two VAV systems 6,8 (either with two coils or a single coil) for cooling and dehumidifying two separate streams of air. The fresh air is conditioned by its own air-conditioning system (die first VAV system) and distributed to the various fresh air VAV boxes 30 that form part of an air<br>
distribution network. Each of these fresh air VAV boxes 30 is controlled by the CPU 54 which receives an input signal from a localized carbon dioxide (C02) sensor 34 to ensure adequate ventilation. A certain minimum provision of fresh air is considered healthy in order to avoid an accumulation of CO2 due to human respiration as well as emissions from building materials and equipment As the main purpose of the fresh air VAV box 30 is to ensure adequate fresh air based on occupant density, when the building is vacant, or nearly empty, the CPU 54 will receive a signal from the CO2 sensor 34 to slow down the fresh air VAV system 6, thereby conserving energy. The return air from the various zones of the same distribution network is conditioned by a separate air-conditioning system (the second VAV system) and distributed to a separate set of recycled air VAV boxes 32. The CPU 54 controls each recycled air VAV box 32. Based on input signals from the localized temperature sensors 36, the CPU will vary the flow in the second VAV system 8. When thermal loading is low, the CPU will slow the output from the second VAV system 8. Consequently, significant energy savings are possible at partial-load operating conditions resulting from low occupancy or moderate weather. As depicted in Figure 2, the conditioned fresh air and the conditioned recycled air travel in parallel ducts 26, 28 and do not mix until just before the diffuser vent 40 in the mixing box 38.<br>
Figure 4 depicts graphically the psychrometric performance of the HVAC system of the present invention. (A psychometric chart shows the variation of humidity, or vapor pressure, as a function of air temperature). Significantly improved dehuroidification can be achieved when mo humid outside air is treated separately, 'I his leaves ihe recycled air coii to handle the predominantly sensible cooling loads. Besides the realization of substantial energy saving due to this method of conditioning air, the use of VAV systems for both air streams results in fan energy savings as well. Figure 4 shows a condition curve for outside air 60 representing ihe psychrometric curve for outside (fresh) air at a given temperature and relative humidity. A coil condition curve for the first VAV system 62 (fresh air) is plotted on the graph in Figure 4. The fresh air condition curve is defined at one end by on-coil conditions 66 and off-coil conditions 64. A coil condition curve tor the second VAV system 70 (recycled air1) is also plotted or the graph in Figure 4. The recycled air condition curve is defined by on-coil and off-coil conditions 76,74. Mixing box conditions 80 as well as room conditions (or "space conditions") 85 are also plotted on the psychrometric chart in Figure 4. The superior dehumidifying performance of the HVAC system of the present invention is apparent from Figure 4.   The room is substantially<br>
dehumidified in comparison with outdoor humidity levels for a given temperature.<br>
The superior performance of the HVAC system of the present invention was validated by various experiments that were conducted in the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Chamber of the Department of Building at the National University of Singapore. The seven experiments presented in Table 1 below represent different points of operation of a variable-air-volume fan in a steady-state condition.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 1: Simulated experimental conditions in two chambers (Room 1 and Room 2) and simulated fan operating characteristics<br>
Tabulated above in Table 1 are various experiments that were run with thermal and<br>
ventilation loads that are characterized a
The seven experiments represent various steady-state conditions. The superior performance of the HVAC system of the present invention is reflected in the action of the VAV box dampers under various combinations of ventilation and thermal requirements. Room 2 is<br>
used as a control room with base thermal and ventilation loads throughout the seven experiments. Room 1 is the experimental room, in which the thermal and ventilation loads are varied. Experiment 1 begins with base thermal and ventilation loads, followed (in Experiments 2 and 3) with a high ventilation load and then a high thermal load. The final experiments (4a and 4b) involve high ventilation loads in Room 1 (similar to experiments 2a and 2b) except that the chilled water modulation is now achieved by using the fresh air "off-coil" set-point temperature. (In all previous experiments, the recycled air "off-coil" set-point temperature was used.) The space carbon dioxide levels and the associated damper positions are presented in Table 2 below.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 2 clearly shows that the fresh air damper opens fully when eight occupants are present Li Room 1 (Experiuieiits 2a, 2b, 4a and 4b). The fresh air datap-ir ope;L5 whsu the CO-;. level in Room 1 exceeds the set-point of 550 parts per million (ppm). In Experiments 2b and 4b, the fresh air fan is set to operate at 100% of its maximum speed. The opening of the fresh air damper in these two experiments is a clear indication that more fresh air is actually being provided to Room 1 to dilute the elevated CO2 levels. Changing the load characteristics in Room 1 during Experiments 3a and 3b resulted in the fresh air damper virtually closing in Room 1 as the actual C02 level was less than 550 ppm. Meanwhile, the high thermal load (due to the additional lighting) demanded more recycled air. Consequently, the recycled air camper remained fully open during these experiments. Carbon dioxide levels were monitored continuously at the following locations during the course of the seven experiments: (1) in the occupied zone of Room 1 at a height of 1.2 m; (2) in each of the two return air grilles in Room 1; (3) in the occupied zone of Room 2 at a height of 1.2 m; (4) in the return air grille in Room 2; and (5) in the fresh air stream (ambient air reference).<br>
During Experiment 1, the C02 levels in all of the indoor locations corresponded to base ventilation load levels, that is, just slightly above the ambient level of 400 ppm. At the beginning of Experiment 2a, eight occupants moved into Room 1 whereupon it was observed that the CQj level rose to 1000 ppm inside Room 1 as well as inside Room l's two return air grilles. During this period, the CO2 level in Room 2 stayed almost the same, with minor fluctuations caused by the recirculating air.<br>
Experiment 2a was conducted with both the fresh air and recycled air fans operating at 30% speed. At the beginning of Experiment 2b, die speed of the fresh air fan was increased to 100% while the recycled air fan remained at 30%. The additional fresh air supplied during Experiment 2b resulted in the significant reduction of CO2 levels in Room 1 to about 750 ppm. During this time, the CO2 level in Room 2 remained essentially unchanged. This shows that zonal ventilation control is clearly being achieved.<br>
In Experiments 3a and 3b, base ventilation loads were maintained in both rooms, which is evidenced by the CO2 readings of about 500 ppm. Experiments 4a and 4b were a repeat of Experiments 2a and 2b except that the chilled water modulation in Experiments 4a and 4b was achieved by controlling the fresh air "off-coil" set-point temperature.<br>
