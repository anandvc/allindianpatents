				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method for producing<br>
a compacted yarn, especially for monitoring the functions of<br>
condensing or compressing the yarn. The invention also relates<br>
to an apparatus which can be used for such process.<br>
By a "condensed"or "compacted" yarn, one will<br>
understand a yarn in which, prior to the initial spinning or<br>
twisting of the fiber roving or sliver from which the finished<br>
yarn is to be fabricated by twisting, in which, as a rule, by<br>
means of an air stream trained toward the center of the fiber<br>
roving or sliver, projecting edge fibers will be laid back into<br>
the roving and packing density of the fibers themselves in the<br>
roving will be increased. This results especially in a reduction<br>
of the hairiness of the yarn produced as well as an increase in<br>
other quality parameters of the yarn, like improved binding of<br>
the fibers, increased utilization of the fiber material and<br>
enhanced strength of the yarn.<br>
The reference to "hairiness" of a yarn should be<br>
understood here to refer to the number of fibers which tend to<br>
project out from the yarn produced and the length to which the<br>
fibers project out of the yarn produced. A certain degree of<br>
hairiness is unavoidable with staple fiber yarns and for the<br>
textile products made from such yarns. Excessive hairiness is,<br>
however, undesirable. Excessive hairiness reduces the wear<br>
resistance of the yarn since the projecting fibers do not<br>
contribute to it. Hairiness can be the source of breakage of the<br>
projecting fibers from the yarn and thus a weight loss by the<br>
yarn as well as of excessive production of lint. The hairiness<br>
has a detrimental effect on the smoothness of textile fabrics<br>
produced from the yarn by weaving, knitting or the like. The<br>
projecting fibers have been removed in the past by, for example,<br>
singeing.<br>
As a consequence, significantly projecting fibers and<br>
large numbers of such projecting fibers should be avoided.<br>
To describe the hairiness, the projecting fibers are<br>
subdivided into length classes based upon their length in two<br>
millimeter units. In length classes up to 4 mm, the projecting<br>
fibers can be tolerable and may even be desirable for the textile<br>
character of the yarn and possibly even unavoidable. In the<br>
higher length classes of, for example 6 mm to 8 mm, the number of<br>
projecting fibers is significantly different between normally<br>
spun yarn and condensed spun yarn, the difference being so<br>
significant that the difference can delineate between normal and<br>
defective yarns. Condensed yarns can be made by directing the<br>
air stream transverse to the yarn at the outlet side of the<br>
outlet pair of rollers of a drafting frame, for example, of a<br>
ring-spinning machine and hence onto the fiber roving which<br>
emerges from the drafting frame with a given width of the band so<br>
that the fibers especially along the marginal regions of the<br>
roving are pressed back into the body of the roving.<br>
For the condensation of yarn or fiber rovings to be<br>
made into yarns, a variety of devices have become known. For<br>
example, hollow rollers having a perforated periphery with a row<br>
of small suction openings and maintained under suction, have been<br>
proposed. Flexible endless belts under suction can be formed<br>
with the perforations as well. The process and apparatus<br>
according to the invention are independent from the type of<br>
compaction or condensing device used and can be effected with<br>
different compacting or condensing devices. Such compacting or<br>
condensing devices operate in the manner which has been described<br>
to draw the projecting fibers back into the body of the roving.<br>
With such systems, however, the suction may fail or the<br>
suction effect at the periphery of the rollers of the condensing<br>
device may fail because of plugging of the suction pipes or of<br>
the suction passages or orifices. Suction belts can break. The<br>
fiber roving can shift laterally out of the effective range of<br>
the suction openings. Such defects frequently cannot be noticed<br>
at the spinning station and hence considerable lengths of yarn<br>
can be produced which are not compacted or condensed and thus can<br>
be defective.<br>
It is the principal object of the present invention,<br>
therefore, to provide a method of making a yarn whereby these<br>
drawbacks are avoided and long stretches of defective yarn are<br>
not produced as a result of the failure of a condensation or<br>
compaction operation.<br>
The object is achieved, in accordance with the<br>
invention in a method of producing a condensed yarn wherein the<br>
effect of the compaction is monitored by automatic detection of<br>
the hairiness of the yarn which is produced and controlling the<br>
process or the apparatus in response to the automatic monitoring<br>
of the hairiness so that crossing of a threshold representing a<br>
predetermined limiting value of the hairiness cannot occur.<br>
As a result of the monitoring of the hairiness and<br>
preventing the hairiness from exceeding a certain level, the<br>
negative effects of excessive hairiness which have been described<br>
can be avoided. Control via the single parameter not only allows<br>
all of the potential effects of excess hairiness to be eliminated<br>
but it allows adjustment to compensate for any failure of the<br>
condensation or compaction operation at the onset of such a<br>
failure and without waiting for the full adverse effects thereof.<br>
The invention has recognized that the effect of the<br>
compaction of a yarn or a roving acts preferentially on the<br>
projecting fibers with the greatest projecting length and a<br>
detection of the number of such fibers thus provides an<br>
especially clear indication of a defective condensation effect.<br>
Preferably the condensation effect is checked based upon the<br>
hairiness as determined by the longer projecting fibers and is<br>
monitored. Preferably it is possible to operate by checking the<br>
hairiness produced by the longer projecting fibers to determine a<br>
tolerable number of projecting fibers of, for example, the length<br>
range of 6 to 8 mm over a certain length so that when the count<br>
of such projecting fibers exceeds the resulting threshold, an<br>
error signal is triggered.<br>
An apparatus for detecting the hairiness of yarns is<br>
known and need not be described or illustrated in detail. The<br>
checking and monitoring of the hairiness can be carried out on<br>
the yarn itself or on the bobbin or cop to which the yarn is<br>
wound up since hairy yarn gives rise also to a hairy bobbin or<br>
cop. It has been found that the hairiness of a yarn on the cop<br>
provides a clearer indication because frequently fibers which are<br>
in the category of projecting fibers tend to be smoothed out by<br>
passage of the yarn through the traveler and only when subjected<br>
to centrifugal force at the high speeds of the bobbin or cop are<br>
they deflected outwardly and then become detectable. The latter<br>
rewinding of the yarn can also increase the detectable hairiness<br>
because of the reversal of the travel direction of the yarn which<br>
induces projecting fibers to stick out.<br>
The checking and monitoring of the yarns can also be<br>
effected at a variety of locations in the treatment of the yarn.<br>
Thus yarn can be checked for hairiness directly at the spinning<br>
station as it leaves the drafting frame, after being wound to<br>
form the cop or bobbin, or at some later point, for example, at a<br>
rewinding stage. The detection of the hairiness at the spinning<br>
station has the advantage that, should the condensation or<br>
compaction effect fail, this can be determined at the earliest<br>
stage and can be cured early in the production of the yarn. By<br>
monitoring the yarn at the spinning station itself, other<br>
arrangements of the type in which a yarn supplied to a spinning<br>
station may be removed, can be superfluous. Each working station<br>
can be equipped, according to the invention, with a hairiness<br>
sensor.<br>
Since the hairiness of the yarn tends to increase in<br>
the course of its processing, for example in passing through the<br>
traveler, because the centrifugal force or air current forces and<br>
the forces applied on winding up the yarn on the rotating bobbin<br>
or cop, upon reversal of travel direction in rewinding or the<br>
like, a monitoring in subsequent treatment stages can give rise<br>
to clearer or better results. The detection of the yarns at a<br>
subsequent treatment step for the yarn also has the advantage<br>
that the travel speed for the yarn is generally higher at all of<br>
these subsequent treatment locations than at the spinning station<br>
and hence the utilization of the apparatus can be increased in<br>
that a smaller number of monitoring units need be provided. The<br>
preferred subsequent station for monitoring is the station at<br>
which the yarn is rewound from the spinning cops or bobbins onto<br>
cross winding yarn packages or spools.<br>
The checking and monitoring of the yarns at the cop or<br>
bobbin can be effected advantageously in an apparatus which<br>
processes the cop or bobbin or into which the cop or bobbin is<br>
fed while the cop or bobbin is traveling past a hairiness sensor.<br>
A further advantageous possibility for checking or<br>
monitoring hairiness provides a hairiness check on the row of<br>
spinning or rewinding stations for the yarn or the cops or<br>
bobbins on the spindles of the ring-spinning machine, the sensor<br>
being moved past the cops or bobbins or the yarns along the<br>
spindle row. A single hairiness sensor can thus check or monitor<br>
a multiplicity of yarns or cops or bobbins.<br>
When it is determined that the compaction or condensing<br>
effect is missing or is not effective to the desired extent, the<br>
sensor outputs a signal which can be provided as an input to the<br>
manufacturing process. The signal can generate a warning or an<br>
alert, e.g. by an acoustic or visible signal which causes the<br>
intervention of service personnel. The signal itself, can<br>
trigger shutdown of the defectively working spinning station to<br>
suppress the fabrication of defective product.<br>
An apparatus according to the invention can have a<br>
hairiness sensor so configured that it outputs the length and<br>
number of projecting fibers by detecting only the number of<br>
projecting fibers of a minimum length and outputs a signal to the<br>
control unit. In a first case, the control unit is so configured<br>
that it sorts incoming fibers by length classification (in terms<br>
of length of the projecting fibers) and determines the frequency<br>
of occurrence of the fibers of minimum length. The control<br>
device is provided with means for detecting the crossing of a<br>
threshold for the number of projecting fibers in a given length<br>
class.<br>
When the checking and monitoring of the hairiness is<br>
carried out on yarn or on bobbins or cops at each spinning<br>
station or by a sensor which is moved past each spinning station,<br>
an error signal can be associated immediately with a given<br>
spinning station.<br>
However, when the checking and monitoring of the<br>
hairiness is carried out at a yarn processing machine which is<br>
downstream from the spinning frame and is separate therefrom, for<br>
example, at a rewinding machine or a further twisting or other<br>
machine using cops or bobbins which have been removed from the<br>
first-mentioned spinning machines, arrangements must be made to<br>
associate the particular cop or bobbin or the yarn therefrom with<br>
the particular spinning station from which the cop or bobbin<br>
arose. This can be accomplished by coding the yarn carrier, i.e.<br>
the core or bobbin tube or a carrier thereof with a code which<br>
indicates the spinning station so that it is possible to<br>
recognize the spinning station from which a defective yarn<br>
originates so that appropriate correction can be made. A system<br>
for this purpose is known, for example, from DE 36 03 002.<br>
The above and other objects, features, and advantages<br>
will become more readily apparent from the following description,<br>
reference being made to the accompanying drawing in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic cross section through one side<br>
of a ring-spinning machine showing one of the stations thereof<br>
equipped according to the invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is a plan view of a spinning apparatus having a<br>
ring-spinning frame and a winding frame; and<br>
FIG. 3 is an elevational view showing a cop or bobbin<br>
on a plate provided with coded indicia.<br>
FIG. 1 shows the significant components of a ring-<br>
spinning machine 1 and including the roving bobbins 2 from which<br>
the rovings are drawn, a drafting frame 4 with three roller pairs<br>
5, 6 and 7, and the ring-spinning frame 8 with its thread guide<br>
9, a ring rail 10 with respective rings and travelers for each<br>
spindle 11 and the spindle rail 40 on which the spindles are<br>
mounted. Each spindle 11 can receive a sleeve 41 on which the<br>
cop 12 is wound. The cop 12 and its sleeve or tube 41 is placed<br>
onto the spindle 11 and the drive for the spindle 11 is found in<br>
the spindle rail 40.<br>
The ring-spinning apparatus 1 also comprises a roving<br>
stop device 13 which can be of conventional design. For example,<br>
the roving stop unit 13 can act on the lower roller of the input<br>
roller pair 5 of the drafting frame 4 and is represented by a<br>
half shell surrounding this lower roller. To interrupt the feed<br>
of the roving, the half shell on the lower roller can be pivoted<br>
so that the roving is no longer entrained between two rollers of<br>
the roller pair 5 and thus cannot advance through the drafting<br>
frame and will not be wound up into the cop 12.<br>
At the output of the drafting frame 4, each of the<br>
roving spinning stations can be provided with a condensing or<br>
compacting unit 14 in the form of a perforated lower roller 15<br>
which is under suction and is juxtaposed with an upper roller 16.<br>
Other types of condensing or compaction units can be used as well<br>
and the invention is not dependent upon a compaction unit of any<br>
certain construction.<br>
Between the condensing or compaction unit 14 and the<br>
thread guide 9, the ring-spinning frame 8 is provided with a<br>
hairiness sensor 17 which is traversed by the yarn 18 and in<br>
which the hairiness of that yarn, as defined above, is detected.<br>
The hairiness sensor can be of a conventional design as well and<br>
need not be described further herein.<br>
The measured signal representing the hairiness of the<br>
yarn is fed by the sensor 17 via line 19 to a control device 20.<br>
In this control device 20, the input signal from the<br>
hairiness sensor is compared with a limiting value for the<br>
hairiness, i.e. the maximum permissible hairiness. This can be a<br>
measure of the number of projecting fibers in a certain length<br>
class, for example 6 mm to 8 mm. The hairiness sensor may thus<br>
be responsive only to outwardly projecting fibers of this length<br>
class or to fibers in a variety of length classes and the<br>
controller 20 can signal a hairiness level which exceeds the<br>
threshold and which, via the line 21 can trigger a control signal<br>
at the roving stop unit 13. To suppress further production of<br>
defective yarn, i.e. yarn with excessive hairiness, the<br>
controller 20 can operate the yarn feed shutoff 13 via line 21.<br>
The control device 20 can, instead of providing a<br>
control signal at 21, output via signal line 22 an alarm<br>
signal to a warning device, for example a warning lamp 23, which<br>
can alert a service person observing that lamp to the defect at<br>
the particular spinning station. The warning signal enables the<br>
service person to review the function of the condensing or<br>
compaction unit 14 and restore the latter to proper functioning.<br>
In the embodiment of FIG. 2, each working station 24 of a<br>
rewinding machine 25 in which the yarn 18 is rewound from a cop<br>
or bobbin onto a cross-wound yarn package is provided with a<br>
sensor A7 at each station. The measured value of<br>
this hairiness sensor 17 is fed to a bus system via a common line 26<br>
connected to the control unit 20. In the control unit the<br>
measured value is compared with a predetermined limiting value or<br>
threshold as has been described. When this is exceeded, a<br>
warning signal is issued which can be observed by service<br>
personnel and the corresponding location or station 24 of the<br>
rewinding machine 25, at which defective yarn is found, can be<br>
shut down or corrected.<br>
When the ring-spinning machine 1 of FIG. 2 is provided<br>
with a transport device 27, the checking of the cops 12 for<br>
hairiness can be effected utilizing the transport device. Such a<br>
transport device can include an endless cable or other traction<br>
member 29 with entrainers by means of which the cop plates 30 are<br>
displaceable around the ring-spinning machine as part of the cop<br>
or bobbin replacement system. The plates can carry spindles 11<br>
on which the core sleeves or device 41 for the cops can be fitted<br>
and from which the completed cop or bobbin can be removed.<br>
The checking of the cops for hairiness can be effected<br>
by a hairiness sensor, 17' positioned along the path of the cops<br>
which are displaced in the (direction of the arrow P. The sensor<br>
17' can be connected to a controller 20 which can monitor the<br>
various spinning stations 24. Since the cop or bobbin plate 30<br>
is provided with coded indicia 34 representing the station at<br>
which the cop or bobbin is formed, if the controller 20 detects a<br>
level of hairiness exceeding a predetermined threshold, because<br>
it can also identify the station from which the cop bearing the<br>
defective yarn arises, that station can be shut down.<br>
In that case, the control device 20, recognizing that<br>
the x-th cop is produced at the y-th spinning station, can signal<br>
for shut down of that spinning station.<br>
If the yarn is to be processed in a ring-spinning<br>
machine which has a winding or spooling machine 25 associated<br>
therewith, the cops 12 can be mounted at a transfer device 31 at<br>
an end of the ring-spinning machine 1 upon other cop plates 30<br>
which, via a further transport device 32 can displace the cops to<br>
the work stations 24 of the package winder 25. The cop plates 30<br>
of the package winder 25 return to the transfer device 31 after<br>
the cops have been emptied and can be supplied with fresh cops or<br>
fed to the transporter 21 of the ring-spinning machine to carry<br>
the empty core sleeve or tube thereto.<br>
The transfer device 31 is provided with a detector 33<br>
which can read the data identifying the cop plates 30, namely,<br>
the bar codes 34 which can identify a particular spindle 11 of<br>
the ring-spinning machine from which the cop arises. The spindle<br>
number can also be retained in a data carrier or memory<br>
associated with the cop plate or affixed to the cop plate or to<br>
the sleeve of the cop and carrying electronically readable data.<br>
Upon detection of a defective yarn, that spinning<br>
station can be shut down until the condensing or compaction unit<br>
is repaired or replaced. This control can be effected<br>
automatically or the number of the station from which the<br>
defective yarn arises can be displayed so that an operator can<br>
shut down that station. The display for this purpose is provided<br>
on the controller at 42.<br>
The work station 24 of the package winding machine can<br>
be equipped with devices for reading the spindle number from the<br>
cop plate 30 or the cop sleeve or tube, to indicate the station<br>
at which the cop was formed. This gives the operator the<br>
possibility of monitoring the condensing or compaction device 14<br>
at that station to eliminate any defects therein.<br>
It will be self-understood that it is also possible<br>
utilizing the controller 20, upon the generation of an error<br>
signal from the hairiness sensor 17' and detection of the spindle<br>
number, to generate an effector signal which is supplied to the<br>
ring-spinning machine 1 for automatic operation of the roving<br>
stop device 13 at the addressed station. Since defects in the<br>
compaction or condensing devices occur relatively infrequently,<br>
it is not necessary in many cases to monitor the traveling yarns<br>
of a yarn-producing or yarn-processing machine like a ring-<br>
spinning machine or a package-winding machine by respective<br>
hairiness sensors. A single hairiness sensor 17" can be provided<br>
on an endless member 35 as has been shown in FIG. 2 to move back<br>
and forth along a row of spindles, thereby repetitively<br>
monitoring cops for brief time intervals. An error signal can be<br>
generated where a defective yarn is detected and this signal can<br>
be associated with the address at which the defect is detected<br>
for shut down or correction.<br>
In FIG. 2 as well, a number of hairiness<br>
monitors at the package rewinding stations 24, have been shown thereby indicating<br>
that each of these stations can be monitored for hairiness as<br>
well.<br>

by means of a signal emitted by the control device at a defectively<br>
operated spinning station.<br>
14. An apparatus as claimed in claim 10 wherein each spinning station<br>
of the apparatus (1) for producing compacted yarn is equipped with<br>
a hairiness sensor (17).<br>
15. An apparatus as claimed in claim 10 wherein that a handling device<br>
(27) for a cop (12) is equipped with a hairiness sensor (17')<br>
operating upon successive cops which are handled by that device.<br>
16. An apparatus as claimed in claim 10 wherein a yarn processing unit<br>
(25) equipped with at least one yarn sensor (17) is provided behind<br>
a device (1) for producing compacted yarn (18) and means<br>
(33,34,20) is provided which permits the association of the<br>
particular cop of compacted yarn with the particular spinning station<br>
of the apparatus.<br>
17. An apparatus as claimed in claim 10 wherein along the work station<br>
(24) of a yarn-producing or yarn-processing apparatus (1,25) a<br>
hairiness sensor (17") is provided by means of which the yarns (18)<br>
or their cops (12) are successively and briefly sensed repetitively<br>
for their hairiness.<br>
This invention relates to a method of producing compacted yarn characterized in<br>
that the effect of compaction is monitored by automatic checking of the hairiness<br>
of the generated yarn and by automatic monitoring of the exceeding of a<br>
predetermined hairiness threshold.</td>
