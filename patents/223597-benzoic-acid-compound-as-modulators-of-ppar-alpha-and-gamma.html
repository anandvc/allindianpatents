				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to certain novel benzoic acid derivatives, to processes for preparing such compounds, to their utility in treating clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance, to methods for their therapeutic use and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The Insulin Resistance Syndrome (IRS) including type 2 diabetes mellitus, which refers to a cluster of manifestations including insulin resistance with accompanying hyperinsulinaemia, possible type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, central (visceral) obesity, dyslipidaemia observed as deranged lipoprotein levels typically characterised by elevated VIJDL (very low density lipoproteins), small dense LDL particles and reduced HDL (high density lipoprotein) concentrations and reduced fibrinolysis.<br>
Recent epidemiological research has documented that individuals with insulin resistance run a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, notably suffering from myocardial infarction and stroke. In type 2 diabetes melhtus atherosclerosis related conditions cause up to 80% of all deaths.<br>
In clinical medicine there is awareness of the need to increase the insulin sensitivity in IRS suffering patients and thus to correct the dyslipidaemia which is considered to cause the accelerated progress of atherosclerosis. However, currently this is not a universally well defined disease.    "<br>
Compounds which are modulators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR, for a review of the PPARs see T. M.Willson et al, J Med Chem 2000, Vol 43, 527) are effective in treating conditions associated with insulin resistance.<br><br>
Surprisiagly a series of compounds has now been found which are modulators of PPARa and/or PPARy activity.<br>

Furlier values of R1, T, U, V, W, R2, R3, m, n, p, q, r and s in compounds of Formula I now follow. It will be understood that such values may be used with any of the definitions, claims or embodiments defined hereinbefore or hereinafter.<br>
In a first aspect R1 represents phenyl which is optionally substituted by one or more of the following: halo, hydroxy, a Cwalkyl group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro, a Cwalkoxy group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro, benzybxy, a CMalkylsulphonyloxy group, phenyl or a heteroaryl group, or R1 represents a heterocyclic group which is optionally substituted by one or more of the following: halo, a C^aBcy! group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro, a Ci^alkoxy group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro or phenyl optionally substituted by one or more of the following: halo, a Chalky! group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro, a Cwalkoxy group which is optionally substituted by<br>

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that certain compounds of formula I may contain an optically active centre and therefore can exist as enantiomers which can be separated as described later. It is expected that most, if not all, of the activity of the compounds of formuk I resides in one enantiomer: either the S or the R enantiomer or the (+) or the (-) enantiomer. The enantiomers which are more active in the assays which are described later are preferred forms of the present invention. It will be understood that the present invention includes aE mixtures of this active enantiomer with the other enantiomer, for example the racemic mixture.<br>
The active enantiomers may be isolated by separation of racemate for example by fractional crystallization, resolution or IJPLC on a chiral column (for example a Ouralpak™ AD 250x50 column). Alternatively the active enantiomers may be made by chiral synthesis from chiral starting materials under conditions which will not cause racemisatton or epimerisation, or by derivatisation with a chiral reagent.<br>
Prodrugs of the compounds of formuk I also form part of the present invention. The term "prodrug " as used in this specification includes derivatives of the carboxylic acid group which are converted in a maTgrpal  particularly a human, into the carboxylic acid group or a salt or conjugate thereof. It should be understood that, whilst not being bound by theory,<br>
it is believed that most of the activity associated with the prodrugs arises from the activity of the compound of formula I into which the prodrugs are converted. Prodrugs can be prepared by routine methodology well within the capabilities of someone skilled in the art. Various prodrugs of carboxy are known in the art For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see:<br>

These clinical conditions will include, but will not be limited to, general obesity, abdominal obesity, arterial hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, type 2 diabetes and the dyslipidaemia characteristically appearing with insulin resistance. This dyslipidaemia, also known as the atherogenic lipoprotein profile, is characterised by moderately elevated non-esterified fatty acids, elevated very bw density lipoprotein (VLDL) tnglyceride rich particles, high Apo B levels, low high density Hpoprotein (HDL) levels associated with tow apoAI particle levels and high Apo B levels in the presence of small, dense, low density hpoproteins (LDL) particles, phenotype B.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in treating patients with combined or mixed hyperlipidemias or various degrees of hypertriglyceridemias and postprandial dyslipidemia with or without other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome.<br>
Treatment with the present compounds is expected to lower die cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerosis due to their antidyslipidaemic as well as antiinfiammatory properties. The cardiovascular disease conditions include macro-angiopathies of various internal organs causing myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities. Because of their insulin sensitizing effect the compounds of formula I are also expected to prevent or deky the development of type 2 diabetes from the metabolic syndrome and diabetes of pregnancy. Therefore the development of long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia in diabetes mellitus such as the<br><br>
micro-angiopathies causing renal disease, retinal damage and peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs are expected to be delayed. Furthermore the compounds may be useful in treatment of various conditions outside die cardiovascular system whether or not associated with insulin resistance, like polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, cancer and states of inflammatory disease including neurodegenerative disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in controlling glucose levels in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes.<br>
The present invention provides a method of treating or preventing dyslipidemias, the insulk resistance syndrome and/or metabolic disorders (as defined above) comprising the administration of a compound of formula I to a mammal (particularly a human) in need thereof.<br>

Biological activity Formulations<br>
Compounds were dissolved inDMSO to obtain 16 mM stock solutions. Before assays, stock solutions were further diluted in DMSO and culture media.<br>
GENERAL CHEMICALS AND REAGENTS<br>
Luciferase assay reagent was purchased from Packard, USA Restriction Enzymes were<br>
from Boehringer and Vent polymerase from New England Biolabs.<br>
CELL LINES AND CELL CULTURE CONDITIONS<br>
U2-OS, (Osteogenic sarcoma, Human) was purchased from ATCC, USA. Cells were expanded and refrozen in batches from passage number six Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 25 mM glucose, 2 mM glutamine or 4 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine,10% fetal calf serum, at 5% COj. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without addition of calcium or magnesium was used. All cell culture reagents were from Gibco (USA) and 96-well cell culture plates were purchased from Wallach.<br>
PLASMID CONSTRUCTS FOR HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION<br>
Standard recombinant DNA techniques were carried out as described by Ausubel (7). The Luciferase reporter vector, pGLSUAS (clone consists of five copies of the GAL4 DNA binding sequence, 5'-CGACGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAGCT-3', cloned into the SacKXhoI sites of pGL3-Promoter (Promega). The SacI/XhoI fragment carrying the UAS sites was constructed using annealed overlapping oligonucleotides.<br>
Expression vectors used are based upon pSG5 (Stratagene). All vectors contain an EcoRI/Nhel fragment encoding the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (encoding amino acid positions 1-145 of database accession number P04386) followed by an in-frame fusion to a fragment encoding the nuclear localisation sequence from T antigen of Polyoma Virus. The nuclear localisation sequence was constructed using annealed overlapping oligonucleotides creating Nhel/Kpnl sticky ends<br>
(5'-CTAGCGCTCCTAGAAGAAACGCAAGGTTGGTAC-3'). The ligand binding domains from human and mouse PPARcc and human and mouse PPARy were PCR amplified as KpnI/BamHI fragments and cbned in frame to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the nuclear localisation sequence. The sequence of all plasmid constructs used were confirmed by sequencing. The following expression vectors were used for transient transfections:<br>

refers to nucleotide positions of data base entry used to express the ligand binding domain.<br>
TRANSIENT TRANSFECTIONS<br>
Frozen stocks of cells from passage number six were thawed and expanded to passage number eight before transfections. Confluent cells were trypsinised, washed and pelleted by centrifugation at 270xg for 2 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold PBS to a cell concentration of about 18 x 10s cells/ml. After addition of DNA, the cell suspension was incubated on ice for approximately 5 minutes before electroporation at 230 V, 960 jiF in Biorad's Gene Pulser™ in. 0.5 ml batches. A total of 50 fig DNA was added to each batch of 0.5 ml cells, including 2.5 fig expression vector, 25 jug reporter vector and 22.5 fj.g unspecific DNA (pBluescript, Stratagene),<br>
After electroporation, cells were diluted to a concentration of 320'000 cells/ml in. DMEM without phenol red, and approximately 25'000 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. In order to allow cells to recover, seeded plates were incubated at 37°C for 3-4 hours before addition of test compounds. En assays for PPARoc, the cell medium was supplemented with resin-charcoal stripped fetal calf serum (PCS) in order to avoid background activation by fatty acid components of the PCS. The resin-charcoal stripped PCS was produced as follows; for 500 ml of heat-inactivated PCS, 10 g charcoal and 25 g Bio-Rad Analytical Grade Anion Exchange Resin 200-400 mesh were added, and the solution was kept on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature over night. The following day, the PCS was centrifuged and the stripping procedure was repeated for 4-6 hours. After the second treatment, the PCS was centrifuged and filter sterilised in order to remove remnants of charcoal and resin.<br><br>
ASSAY PROCEDURE<br>
Stock solutions of compounds in DMSO were diluted in appropriate concentration ranges in master pktes. Prom master plates, compounds were diluted in culture media to obtain test compound solutions for final doses.<br>
After adjustment of the amount of cell medium to 75 /*! in each well, 50 /*! test compound solution was added. Transiently transfected cells were exposed to compounds for about 24 hours before the luciferase detection assay was performed. For luciferase assays, 100 /il of assay reagent was added manually to each well and plates were left for approximately 20 minutes in order to allow lysis of the cells. After lysis, luciferase activity was measured in a 1420 Multiwell counter, Victor, from Wallach.<br>
Reference compounds<br>
The TZD pioglitazone was used as reference substance for activation of both human and murine PPARy. 5,8,11,14-Eicosatetrayonic acid (ETYA) was used as reference substance for human PPARa.<br>
Calculations and analysis<br>
For calculation of BC5Q values, a concentration-effect curve was established. Values used were derived from the average of two or three independent measurements (after subtraction of the background average value) and were expressed as the percentage of the maximal activation obtained by the reference compound. Values were plotted against the logarithm of the test compound concentration. £€50 values were estimated by linear intercalation between the data points and calculating the concentration required to achieve 50% of the maximal activation obtained by the reference compound.<br>
The compound of formula I have an ECjo of less than 50pmol/l for PPARa and/or PPARy. Preferred compounds have an ECso of less than S^mol/l for either PPARa or PPARy.   For<br>
