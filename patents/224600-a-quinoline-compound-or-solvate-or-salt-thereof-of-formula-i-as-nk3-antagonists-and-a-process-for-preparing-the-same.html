				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a quinoline compound, or solvate or salt thereof, of formula (i) as NK3 antagonists and a process for preparing the same.<br>
The mammalian peptide Neurokinin B (NKB) belongs to the Tachykinin (TK) peptide family which also include Substance P (SP) and Neurokinin A (NKA). Pharmacological and molecular biological evidence has shown the existence of three subtypes of TK receptor (NK1, NK2 and NK3) and NKB binds preferentially to the NK3 receptor although it also recognises the other two receptors with lower affinity (Maggi et al, 1993, J. Auton. Pharmacol, 13,23-93).<br>
Selective peptidic NK3 receptor antagonists are known (Drapeau, 1990 Regul. Pept., 31,125-135), and findings with peptidic NK3 receptor agonists suggest that NKB, by activating the NK3 receptor, has a key role in the modulation of neural input in airways, skin, spinal cord and nigro-striatal pathways (Myers and Undem, 1993, J.Phisiol., 470,665-679; Counture et al., 1993, Regul. Peptides, 46,426-429; Mccarson and Krause, 1994, J. Neurosci., 14 (2), 712-720; Arenas et al. 1991, J.Neurosci., 11,2332-8).<br>
However, the peptide-like nature of the known antagonists makes them likely to be too labile from a metabolic point of view to serve as practical therapeutic agents.<br>
We have now discovered a novel class of selective, non-peptide NK3 antagonists which are far more stable from a metabolic point of view than the known peptidic NK3 receptor antagonists and are of potential therapeutic utility in treating pulmonary disorders (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases -COPD-, airway hyperreactivity, cough), skin disorders and itch (for example, atopic dermatitis and cutaneous wheal and flare), neurogenic inflammation and CNS disorders (Parkinson's disease, movement disorders, anxiety. These disorders are referred to hereinafter as the Primary Disorders.<br>
The novel NK3 antagonists of the present invention are also of potential therapeutic utility in treating convulsive disorders (for example epilepsy), renal disorders, urinary incontinence, ocular inflammation, inflammatory pain, eating disorders (food intake inhibition), allergic rhinitis, neurodegenerative disorders (for example Alzheimer's disease), psoriasis, Huntington's disease, and depression (hereinafter referred to as the Secondary Disorders).<br>

(Figure Removed)<br>

A particularly preferred group of compounds of formula (la) are those of formula (Ib) in which the group R is oriented downward and H upward.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or their salts or solvates are preferably in pharmaceutically acceptable or substantially pure form. By pharmaceutically acceptable form is meant, inter alia, of a pharmaceutically acceptable level of purity excluding normal pharmaceutical additives such as diluents and carriers, and including no material considered toxic at normal dosage levels. A substantially pure form will generally contain at least 50% (excluding normal pharmaceutical additives), preferably 75%, more preferably 90% and still more preferably 95% of the compound of formula (I) or its salt or solvate. One preferred pharmaceutically acceptable form is the crystalline form, including such form in pharmaceutical composition. In the case of salts and solvates the additional ionic and solvent moieties must also be non-toxic.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of a compound of formula (I) include the acid addition salts with the conventional pharmaceutical acids, for example maleic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, acetic, fumaric, salicylic, citric, lactic, mandelic, tartaric, succinic, benzoic, ascorbic, and methanesulphonic.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable solvates of a compound of formula (I) include hydrates.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may have at least one asymmetric centre and therefore may exist in more than one stereoisomeric form. The invention extends to all such forms and to mixtures thereof, including racemates.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) which comprises reacting a compound of formula (in)<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
in which R1, R'j, R'2 and Ar' are R, Rj, R2 and Ar as defined for formula (I) or a group or atom convertible to R, Rj, R2 and Ar, with a compound of formula (n)<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
or an active derivative thereof, in which R'3, R4, R5 and X' are R3, R4, RS and X as defined for formula (I) or a group convertible to R3, R4, RS and X, to form a compound of formula (Ic)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
and optionally thereafter performing one or more of the following steps:<br>
(a)	where R', R'i to R'5, Ar1 and X1 are other than R, Rj to R$, Ar and X,<br>
converting any one of R', R'j to R'$, Ar' and X' to R, Rj to R$, Ar and X to obtain a<br>
compound of formula (I),<br>
(b)	where R1, R'j to R'$, Ar' and X' are R, Rj to R5, Ar and X, converting any<br>
one of R, Rj to R^, Ar and X to another R, Rj to R$, Ar and X, to obtain a compound<br>
of formula (I),<br>
(c)	forming a salt and/or solvate of the obtained compound of formula (Ic).<br>
Suitable active derivatives of the compounds of formula (H) are acid halides<br>
(preferably chlorides), acid azides or acid anhydrides. Another suitable derivative is a mixed anhydride formed between the acid and an alkyl chloroformate; another suitable derivative is an activated ester such as a cyanomethyl ester, thiophenyl ester, p-nitrophenyl ester, p-nitrothiophenyl ester, 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl ester, pentachlorophenyl ester, pentafluorophenyl ester, N-hydroxy-phtalimido ester, N-hydroxypiperidine ester, N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, N-hydroxy benzotriazole ester; or the carboxy group may be activated using a carbodiimide or N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole.<br>
For example, in standard methods well known to those skilled in the art, the compounds of formula (ffl) may be coupled:<br>
(a) with an acid chloride in the presence of an inorganic or organic base in a suitable aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF) at a temperature in a<br>
range from -70 to 50Â°C (preferably in a range from -10 to 20Â°C),<br>
(b) with the acid in the presence of a suitable condensing agent, such as for example N,N'-carbonyl diimidazole (GDI) or a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or N-dimethylaminopropyl-N'-ethylcarbodiimide and N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) to maximise yields and avoid racemization processes (Synthesis, 453,1972) in an aprotic solvent such as a mixture of acetonitrile (MeCN) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) in a ratio from 1 : 9 to 7 : 3, respectively, at a temperature in a range from -70 to 50Â°C (preferably in a range from -10 to 25Â°C) (see Scheme 1),<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br><br>
(c) with a mixed anhydride generated in situ from the acid and an alkyl (for example isopropyl) chloroformate in a suitable aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane at a temperature in a range from -70 to 50Â°C (preferably in a range from -20 to 20Â°C).<br>
It will be appreciated that a compound of formula (Ic) may be converted to a compound of formula (I), or one compound of formula (I) may be converted to another compound of formula (I), by interconversion of suitable substituents. Thus, certain compounds of formula (I) and (Ic) are useful intermediates in forming other compounds of the present invention.<br>
For example R*2 may be hydrogen and converted to R2 alkyl group, for example methyl, by conventional amide alkylation procedures (Zabicky, The chemistry of amides; Interscience, London, 1970, p. 749). When X' is oxygen, it may be converted to X sulphur by standard thioamide formation reagents, such as ?2S5 (Chem. Rev., 61, 45,1961 or Angew. Chem., 78, 517,1966) or the Lawesson reagent (Tetrahedron, 41, 5061,1985). When Ar1 or R*5 is a methoxy substituted phenyl, it may be converted to another Ar1 or R'5 hydroxy substituted phenyl by standard demethylation procedures via Lewis acids, such as boron tribromide (Synthesis, 249,1983) or mineral acids, such as hydrobromic or hydroiodic acid. When R is an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example methoxycarbonyl, it may be converted to another R, such as ethoxycarbonyl by transesteriflcation with an appropriate alcohol at a temperature in a range from 20 to 120Â°C, carboxy by hydrolysis in acidic or basic medium, aminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl or dialkylaminocarbonyl by transamidation with ammonia, a primary amine or a secondary amine in methanol as solvent at a temperature in a range from 10 to 120Â°C, optionally in the presence of a catalytic amount of NaCN (/. Org. Chem,, 52, 2033,1987) or by using trimethylaluminium (Me3Al) (Tetrahedron Letters, 48, 4171,1977), hydroxymethyl by a selective metal hydride reduction, such as lithium borohydride reduction (Tetrahedron, 35, 567, 1979) or sodium borohydride reduction in THF + MeOH (Bull. Chem, Soc. Japan, 57, 1948,1984 or Synth. Commun., 12, 463,1982), alkylcarbonyl by acyl chloride formation and subsequent reaction with alkylmagnesium halides in THF as solvent at<br>
a temperature in a range from -78 to 30Â°C (Tetrahedron Letters, 4303,1979) or with alkylcadmium halides or dialkylcadmium in the presence of MgCl2 or LiCl (J. Org. Chem., 47,2590,1982). Another group which R' as methoxycarbonyl can be converted into is a substituted heteroaromatic ring, such as an oxadiazole (/. Med. Chem., 34, 2726,1991).<br>
Scheme 2 summarizes some of the above described procedures to convert a compound of formula (Ic) or (I) in which X' is oxygen, R1 is COOMe, Ar' and R'j to R'5 are as described for formula (I) to another compound of formula (I).<br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be converted into their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts by reaction with the appropriate organic or mineral acids.<br>
Solvates of the compounds of formula (I) may be formed by crystallization or recrystallization from the appropriate solvent. For example, hydrates may be formed<br>
by crystallization or recrystallization from aqueous solutions, or solutions in organic<br>
solvents containing water.<br>
Also salts or solvates of the compounds of formula (I) which are not pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable may be useful as intermediates in the production of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts or solvates. Accordingly such salts or solvates also form part of this<br>
invention.<br>
As mentioned before, the compounds of formula (I) may exist in more than one stereoisomeric form and the process of the invention may produce racemates as well as enantiomerically pure forms. To obtain pure enantiomers, appropriate enantiomerically pure primary or secondary amines of formula (Hid) or (Hie)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
are reacted with compounds of formula (II), to obtain compounds of formula (I'd) or d'e).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Compounds of formula (I'd) or (I'e) may subsequently be converted to compounds of formula (Id) or (le) by the methods of conversion mentioned before.<br>

treating the Secondary Disorders is new, and in a further aspect of the present<br>
invention there is provided the use of an NK3 receptor antagonist for the treatment of<br>
the Secondary Disorders. There is also provided the use of an NK3 receptor<br>
antagonist in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of any of the<br>
Secondary Disorders.<br>
The present invention also provides a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt or solvate thereof, for use as an active therapeutic substance.<br>
The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The present invention also provides the use of a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of the Primary and Secondary Disorders.<br>
Such a medicament, and a composition of this invention, may be prepared by admixture of a compound of the invention with an appropriate carrier. It may contain a diluent, binder, filler, disintegrant, flavouring agent, colouring agent, lubricant or preservative in conventional manner.<br>
These conventional excipients may be employed for example as in the preparation of compositions of known agents for treating the conditions.<br>
Preferably, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention is in unit dosage form and in a form adapted for use in the medical or veterinarial fields. For example, such preparations may be in a pack form accompanied by written or printed instructions for use as an agent in the treatment of the conditions.<br>
The suitable dosage range for the compounds of the invention depends on the compound to be employed and on the condition of the patient. It will also depend, inter alia, upon the relation of potency to absorbability and the frequency and route of administration.<br>
The compound or composition of the invention may be formulated for administration by any route, and is preferably in unit dosage form or in a form that a human patient may administer to himself in a single dosage. Advantageously, the composition is suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, intravenous or intramuscular administration. Preparations may be designed to give slow release of the active ingredient.<br>
Compositions may, for example, be in the form of tablets, capsules, sachets, vials, powders, granules, lozenges, reconstitutable powders, or liquid preparations, for example solutions or suspensions, or suppositories.<br>
The compositions, for example those suitable for oral administration, may<br>
contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate; disintegrants, for example starch, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, sodium starch glycollate or microcrystalline cellulose; or pharmaceutically acceptable setting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate.<br>
Solid compositions may be obtained by conventional methods of blending, filling, tabletting or the like. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. When the composition is in the form of a tablet, powder, or lozenge, any carrier suitable for formulating solid pharmaceutical compositions may be used, examples being magnesium stearate, starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, rice flour and chalk. Tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice, in particular with an enteric coating. The composition may also be in the form of an ingestible capsule, for example of gelatin containing the compound, if desired with a carrier or other excipients.<br>
Compositions for oral administration as liquids may be in the form of, for example, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid compositions may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminium stearate gel, hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; aqueous or non-aqueous vehicles, which include edible oils, for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters, for example esters of glycerine, or propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol, glycerine, water or normal saline; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid; and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also be administered by a non-oral route. In accordance with routine pharmaceutical procedure, the compositions may be formulated, for example for rectal administration as a suppository. They may also be formulated for presentation in an injectable form in an aqueous or non-aqueous solution, suspension or emulsion in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water or a parenterally acceptable oil or a mixture of liquids. The liquid may contain bacteriostatic agents, anti-oxidants or other preservatives, buffers or solutes to render the solution isotonic with the blood, thickening agents, suspending agents or other pharmaceutically acceptable additives. Such forms will be presented in unit dose form such as ampoules or disposable injection devices or in multi- dose forms such as a bottle from which the appropriate dose may be withdrawn or a solid<br>
form or concentrate which can be used to prepare an injectable formulation.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also be administered by inhalation, via the nasal or oral routes. Such administration can be carried out with a spray formulation comprising a compound of the invention and a suitable carrier, optionally suspended in, for example, a hydrocarbon propellant<br>
Preferred spray formulations comprise micronised compound particles in combination with a surfactant, solvent or a dispersing agent to prevent the sedimentation of suspended particles. Preferably, the compound particle size is from about 2 to 10 microns.<br>
A further mode of administration of the compounds of the invention comprises transdermal delivery utilising a skin-patch formulation. A preferred formulation comprises a compound of the invention dispersed in a pressure sensitive adhesive which adheres to the skin, thereby permitting the compound to diffuse from the adhesive through the skin for delivery to the patient. For a constant rate of percutaneous absorption, pressure sensitive adhesives known in the art such as natural rubber or silicone can be used.<br>
As mentioned above, the effective dose of compound depends on the particular compound employed, the condition of the patient and on the frequency and route of administration. A unit dose will generally contain from 20 to 1000 mg and preferably will contain from 30 to 500 mg, in particular 50, 100,150, 200,250, 300, 350,400,450, or 500 mg. The composition may be administered once or more times a day for example 2,3 or 4 times daily, and the total daily dose for a 70 kg adult will normally be in the range 100 to 3000 mg. Alternatively the unit dose will contain from 2 to 20 mg of active ingredient and be administered in multiples, if desired, to give the preceding daily dose.<br>
No unacceptable lexicological effects are expected with compounds of the invention when administered in accordance with the invention.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the Primary and Secondary Conditions in mammals, particularly humans, which comprises administering to the mammal in need of such treatment and/or prophylaxis an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.<br>
The invention further provides a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the Secondary Conditions in mammals, particularly humans, which comprises administering to the mammal in need of such treatment and/or prophylaxis an effective amount of an NK3 receptor antagonist.<br>
The activity of the compounds of the present invention, as NK3 ligands, is determined by their ability to inhibit the binding of the radiolabelled NK3 ligands, [125I]-[Me-Phe7]-NKB or [^H]-Senktide, to guinea-pig and human NK3 receptors<br>
(Renzetti et al, 1991, Neuropeptide, 18,104-114; Buell et al, 1992, FEES, 299(1), 90-95; Chung et al, 1994, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 198(3), 967-972). The binding assays utilized allow the determination of the concentration of the individual compound required to reduce by 50% the [125rj.[Me-Phe^]-NKB and [^H]-Senktide specific binding to NK3 receptor in equilibrium conditions (IC50). Binding assays provide for each compound tested a mean 1059 value of 2-5 separate experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate. The most potent compounds of the present invention show IC50 values in the range 1-1000 nM; in particular, in guinea-pig cortex membranes by displacement of [^H]-Senktide, the compounds of the Examples 22,47,48, and 85 display Kjs (nM) of 5.6, 8.8,12.0 and 4.8 respectively (n=3). The NK3-antagonist activity of the compounds of the present invention is determined by their ability to inhibit senktide-induced contraction of the guinea-pig ileum (Maggi et al, 1990, Br. J. PharmacoL, 101,996-1000) and rabbit isolated iris sphincter muscle (Hall et al., 1991, Eur. J. PharmacoL, 199,9-14) and human NK3 receptors-mediated Ca++ mobilization (Mochizuki et al, 1994, J. Biol. Chem., 269, 9651-9658). Guinea-pig and rabbit in-vitro functional assays provide for each compound tested a mean Kg value of 3-8 separate experiments, where Kg is the concentration of the individual compound required to produce a 2-fold rightward shift in the concentration-response curve of senktide. Human receptor functional assay allows the determination of the concentration of the individual compound required to reduce by 50% (IC^Q values) the Ca++ mobilization induced by the agonist NKB.  In this assay, the compounds of the present invention behave as antagonists. The therapeutic potential of the compounds of the present invention in treating the conditions can be assessed using rodent disease models.<br>
