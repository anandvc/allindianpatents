DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention is directed to an ink for inkjet recording,<br>
ink set for inkjet recording, ink media set for inkjet recording, ink<br>
cartridge, inkjet recording method, and inkjet recording apparatus,<br>
which realize recordings of high quality images by an inkjet system, and<br>
those quality of images close to that of commercial printing such as off-<br>
set printing.<br>
Background Art<br>
Inkjet recording has been known as an excellent recording<br>
method in which substantially any recording media (hereinafter, the<br>
recording media may also be referred to as " a recording medium", "inkjet<br>
paper", "recording media for inkjet recording" or "media") can be applied,<br>
and it has been extensively studied and improved in terms of a recording<br>
apparatus, recording method, and recording medium thereof. In the art,<br>
the widely used ink for inkjet recording is the one which contains water<br>
as a main component, and an aqueous dye. The reason for the large<br>
demand in such the ink is that this ink uses easily obtainable dyes<br>
having high absorption coefficient and high color purity, handling of this<br>
ink is very easy when the ink is made in multiple colors for purpose of<br><br>
widening the range of color tones thereof, and the ink can be made so as<br>
to have good long-term storage stability and high heat resistance<br>
stability, and especially to prevent deterioration or blockage of a thermal<br>
head as a result of the ink being suffered from a heat from a heater for a<br>
long period.<br>
Conventional inkjet papers, especially gloss media for inkjet<br>
printing, are classified into mainly two types, a swollen type and a<br>
porous type. Recently, the porous type media have been widely used<br>
since they excel in drying speed of the ink. The structure of the typical<br>
porous media is such that onto a support, there is provided an ink<br>
absorbing layer having pores so as to take the ink therein, and porous<br>
glossy layer is optionally provided on the ink absorbing layer. For<br>
example, Patent Literatures 1 and 2 disclose a porous medium which is<br>
obtained by applying, onto a support, a coating liquid wherein silica and<br>
aluminum hydrate are dispersed therein to form one or more layers, and<br>
optionally applying a coating liquid containing colloidal silica so as to<br>
form a glossy layer containing a large amount of the colloidal silica.<br>
This medium is so designed as to match a dye ink which is currently<br>
mainly used in inkjet recording, and is widely used as a medium for<br>
inkjet printing, especially as a glossy paper. This paper realizes an<br>
output image with high gloss and of extremely precise details. However,<br>
it also has drawbacks such that raw materials thereof are very expensive,<br>
and the production process for this type of paper is very complicated.<br>
Therefore, a production cost for the paper is extremely high compared to<br>
a glossy coated paper for general commercial printing. For this reason,<br><br>
use of this paper is limited to cases where high quality output images are<br>
required, such as outputting of photography or the like, and it is hardly<br>
used in the field of the commercial printings which need large numbers<br>
of outputting at low cost, such as flyers, catalogs, brochures, and the like.<br>
Moreover, there is a demand for improving the ink absorption capability<br>
since the numbers of colors of the ink for use are getting larger for<br>
obtaining higher quality of images. In order to improve the ink<br>
absorption capability, a thickness of an ink accepting layer, i.e. a coated<br>
layer, needs to be increased. However, if the thickness is increased, a<br>
larger quantity of expensive materials is required. Therefore, there is a<br>
problem such that a cost required for producing each medium is<br>
increased.<br>
A pigment used in the ink absorbing layer, i.e. the ink accepting<br>
layer, needs to have a low refractive index and opacity which allow to<br>
maintain high transparency of the ink absorbing layer, and needs to have<br>
large oil absorption or specific surface area. Therefore, it is necessary to<br>
add a large amount of expensive pigments having a low refractive index<br>
and high oil absorption, such as silica and aluminum hydrate, not<br>
inexpensive white pigments such as calcium carbonate, kaolin, and the<br>
like. When the ink absorbing layer contains pigments having low<br>
transparency and high opacity, a coloring material contained in the ink<br>
absorbed in the ink absorbing layer is concealed by such pigments, and<br>
thus a high coloring density cannot be obtained. In the case where<br>
inkjet recording is carried out by using a paper containing such pigments<br>
of high opacity together with an ink containing a dye, the color density of<br><br>
the resulted image is corresponding to only the coloring material present<br>
in the surface area of the paper even though the amount of the ink to be<br>
ejected is increased. Therefore, the resulted image has low color density<br>
on the whole, and has low contrast. In the case where the pigment<br>
having low oil absorption is used in a paper, the absorption of the ink<br>
cannot be carried out sufficiently, and thus bleeding tends to occur.<br>
In order to resolve the above-mentioned problems, Patent<br>
Literature 3 proposes to use fine organic particles having a low refractive<br>
index so as to realize both the desirable refractive index and whiteness.<br>
However, the organic fine particles still lead to high production cost, and<br>
thus it is yet difficult to attain a recording medium designed for an ink<br>
containing a dye, at low cost.<br>
Moreover, as a design for improving a long-term stability of a<br>
printed image, a main stream idea is to penetrate a dye into an ink-<br>
accepting layer as deep as possible so as to block influences from air or<br>
ultraviolet ray as much as possible, and to protect the dye by using an<br>
antioxidant, or a stabilizer which are originally present within the ink<br>
accepting layer, since the dye molecule has low resistance to ultraviolet<br>
rays and ozone. Therefore, a deep penetration is realized by using a<br>
large amount of an ink having a relatively low content of the coloring<br>
agent, so as to maintain image reliability. To this end, an amount of the<br>
ink necessary for outputting an image is automatically increased.<br>
Therefore, downsizing of a cartridge is difficult to realize, as well as<br>
increasing a cost for recording.<br><br>
Under these circumstances, in inkjet recording, it is still difficult<br>
to provide a recording medium for inkjet recording and a recording<br>
method which output high quality images at low cost.<br>
In recent years, attentions have been drawn to a pigment ink for<br>
inkjet recording. The pigment is insoluble to water, and thus the<br>
pigment is generally dispersed in a solvent in the form of fine particles.<br>
In view of safety, a pigment ink wherein the pigment is dispersed in<br>
water is mainly used in the art. However, such pigment ink has<br>
drawbacks as mentioned hereinafter. The aqueous pigment ink tends to<br>
cause more aggregations or precipitation of the pigment particles,<br>
compared to a dye ink. In order to improve long-term storage stability<br>
to the same degree to that of the dye ink, various conditions for<br>
dispersion or additives are required. The dispersion stabilizer however<br>
becomes a factor for causing a blockage of a thermal head as a result of<br>
the ink being suffered from a heat from a heater for a long period.<br>
Therefore, such ink is not suitably used with a thermal head. Moreover,<br>
the pigment ink is inferiors to a dye ink in a color specification range of<br>
coloring agents. Although the pigment ink has these drawbacks, it has<br>
been popular in view of storage stability after recording, water-resistance,<br>
and image reliability such that high color density of black can be<br>
attained. It is considered that an inkjet printer using the pigment ink<br>
enables to realize the prints having the improved textures to the level of<br>
those of commercial printing, as the coloring agents used therein are<br>
close to those of general commercial printing. However, when printing<br>
is actually performed on a coated paper for commercial printing by using<br><br>
the conventional pigment ink, drying speed of the ink is not sufficiently<br>
high. This poor drying property causes problems such that an image is<br>
spread or blurred, the pigment is not fixed at all after drying, abrasion<br>
occurs, and the like. Therefore, in reality, the pigment ink can be used<br>
only for printing of media having high absorption of an ink, such as a<br>
normal paper, a recording paper for inkjet recording, and the like. This<br>
is because the designing concept of an inkjet image using the pigment<br>
ink has not changed from that of an inkjet image using the dye ink, the<br>
pigment coloring agent is considered only as a dye having a high light<br>
fastness, and the characteristics of the pigment ink are disregarded.<br>
Moreover, an ink for inkjet recording containing amino acid and<br>
the like has been known in the art. However, no attempt has been made<br>
to improve a quality of an image printed on a coated paper for<br>
commercial printing, by using this ink. For example, Patent Literature<br>
4 discloses an essentially combination of amino acid (including dipeptide)<br>
and an amphoteric surfactant as components of an ink and a use of this<br>
ink so as to reduce a permeability of the ink into a normal paper and the<br>
like for the purpose of improving water-resistance, bleeding, feathering,<br>
or the like on a normal paper as a challenge for the dye ink, and also<br>
proposes to use amino acid or the like in the ink for the purpose of<br>
obtaining excellent optical density.<br>
Patent Literature 5 proposes an ink containing protein or<br>
dipeptide, further containing a combination of amino acid and a certain<br>
surfactant, for the purpose of improving reliability for preventing<br>
clogging of a thermal head. Regarding the reliability for preventing<br><br>
clogging, this literature discloses that the protein or peptide contained in<br>
the ink is decomposed due to the structure thereof at the time of using<br>
with a thermal head, the decomposed products are deposited on a head<br>
heater area resulting in a blockage of a thermal head, and therefore the<br>
reliability is significantly lowered. It is further discloses that the above-<br>
mentioned lowered reliability for preventing clogging is prevented, and<br>
the reliability for preventing clogging is maintained by further adding<br>
amino acid and a certain surfactant in combination in the ink.<br>
Patent Literature 6 proposes to add saccharide, reduced<br>
saccharide, oxidized saccharide, and the like to an ink for the purpose of<br>
improving reliability for preventing clogging, and also discloses that the<br>
clogging is prevented by using such the ink as the water evaporation of<br>
the ink is inhibited around a nozzle. However, the ink disclosed in this<br>
literature is not a pigment ink wherein a moisture content of the ink is<br>
reduced and dipeptide is added, so as to realize both of reliability for<br>
preventing clogging, and media conveyance and image reliability for<br>
preventing beading and cockling, at the time using with commercial<br>
media having low absorption of the ink. Here, the term "image<br>
reliability" means light fastness, water-resistance and fixing ability of<br>
characters or image printed on the media.<br>
Moreover, urea or the like is also listed as a solid moisture<br>
retainer in this literature, but comparing to dipeptide, urea has problems<br>
such that it tends to slightly increase viscosity of the ink with the same<br>
addition amount to that of the peptide, and may increase viscosity of the<br><br>
ink or cause aggregation of a coloring agent due to decomposition thereof<br>
ad the time of storage at high temperature.<br>

for recording on a recording medium for inkjet recording which contains<br><br>
a support containing a cellulose pulp, one or more barrier layer disposed<br>
on at least one face of the support, by a inkjet recording system.<br>
A first embodiment of the ink according to the present invention<br>
contains water, a water-soluble organic solvent, a water-dispersible resin,<br>
a fluorochemical surfactant, and a coloring agent, and optionally<br>
contains other substances, if necessary.<br>
A second embodiment of the ink according to the present<br>
invention contains water, a water-soluble organic solvent, a coloring<br>
agent, and a solid water retainer, and optionally contains other<br>
substances, if necessary.<br>
The ink media set for inkjet recording of the present invention<br>
contains either the first or second embodiment of the ink, and a<br>
recording medium for inkjet recording, which contains a support<br>
containing a cellulose pulp, one or more barrier layer disposed on at least<br>
one face of the support, wherein the barrier layer contains 30% by mass<br>
or more of an inorganic pigment having a refractive index of 1.5 or more,<br>
but other than aluminum hydrate, and 10% by mass or less of an<br>
inorganic pigment having a refractive index of less than 1.5.<br>
The ink set for inkjet recording of the present invention contains<br>
a black ink and a color ink, wherein the black ink and the color ink are<br>
each selected from the first and second embodiments of the ink.<br>
Examples of the color ink are a yellow ink, a magenta ink, a cyan<br>
ink, and the like. If a recording is performed with two or more inks<br>
selected from the black ink, the yellow ink, the magenta ink, and the<br>
cyan ink in combination, a multiple color image can be formed. If a<br><br>
recording is performed with inks of all colors in. combination, a full color<br>
image can be formed.<br>
[Recording medium for inkjet recording]<br>
As an example of the conventional recording medium for inkjet<br>
recording, a coated paper for inkjet recording is widely used, and is<br>
generally believed to yield a high quality image. The coated paper is<br>
designed to absorb or penetrate an ink in an ink accepting layer disposed<br>
on a surface of a support, or adjacent to the surface of the support, to<br>
thereby form an image. This design is closely related to the fact that a<br>
focus of the developments for an ink has mainly been directed to a dye<br>
ink in the technology of inkjet recording.<br>
A dye in a liquid is generally penetrated into a material having<br>
an affinity to the dye, and is bound to such material by covalent bonding,<br>
ionic bonding, Van del Waals face, or the like, to thereby tint the material.<br>
On the other hand, a pigment has no or only little self-binding force, and<br>
thus the pigment requires an adhesive or binder to bind with another<br>
material. In the case where a dye ink in used for inkjet recording, the<br>
recording is performed by "dying" the materials in the accepting layer.<br>
Since the person in the art needed to consider this dying process, there<br>
were the technical problems to be solved, such as how to uniformly dye<br>
the accepting layer by using the ink for inkjet printing, and how to<br>
improve so as to dye various materials used in the accepting layer with<br>
the ink for inkjet recording. To solve such problems and obtain high<br>
density and quality images, the technique for absorbing more ink in the<br>
accepting layer, the technique for more strongly binding the ink to the<br><br>
materials in the accepting layer, and the technique for attaining both<br>
absorbance of ink and coloring quality in a good balance have been<br>
developed.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the main stream for the current paper for<br>
inkjet recording is the one having an absorbing layer which has high<br>
porosity and transparency. To obtain such the layer, it is necessary to<br>
use a material which has a low refractive index and a large specific area,<br>
and the current situation is such that an expensive material, e.g. silica or<br>
alumina hydrate, needs to be used, and highly complicated production<br>
method is required. Therefore, the printing cost naturally becomes high,<br>
and thus it is difficult to use this technique for mass printing or the like<br>
due to its cost.<br>
In view of the above-mentioned problems in the art, the present<br>
inventors had diligently studied for realizing an inkjet recording method<br>
at lower cost, and they came to invent an inexpensive image forming<br>
method by using a certain pigment ink having a high penetration ability,<br>
and a recording medium which had a low ink absorbing capacity, which<br>
was contrary to the trends in the art, in combination, based on a novel<br>
concept of design. <br>
Specifically, printing is performed on a recording medium that is<br>
controlled to absorb a pigment as a coloring material contained in the ink<br>
as little as possible, by using a little amount of the pigment ink having<br>
extremely high penetration ability. In this manner, a solvent contained<br>
in the ink is selectively absorbed in the support, the coloring material, i.e.<br>
a pigment, in the ink is efficiently remained on the surface of the<br><br>
recording medium, and thus sufficient coloring density and drying speed<br>
can be both attained with a little amount of the ink.<br>
The recording medium of the present invention that is controlled<br>
with the ink absorbing amount can be attained for example by applying<br>
or coating an absorption inhibiting layer for a certain pigment coloring<br>
agent, i.e. a barrier layer on a support containing a cellulose pulp as a<br>
main component, i.e. a paper support. This barrier layer is configured<br>
to resemble its appearance to that of a printing paper, and therefore<br>
prints having textures close to conventional commercial printings can<br>
also be attained. The desirable penetration, i.e. barrier property, of the<br>
barrier layer can be attained by controlling a size and diameter of pores<br>
in the barrier layer, a thickness of the barrier layer, and the like.<br>
In order to encourage the separation of the pigment coloring<br>
agent from solvent of the ink, the barrier layer preferably has a certain<br>
thickness or less. This thickness is preferably 10 µm or less, and is<br><br>
more preferably 5 µm or less. If the thickness of the barrier layer is<br>
larger than this range, the time required for penetrating the solvent of<br>
the ink is prolonged, and thus the image quality may be decreased due to<br>
the occurrence of beading, breading, or the like, and offset or the like<br>
tends to be occurred as the drying capability is decreased. Moreover,<br>
since it is necessary to make the barrier layer thin, the barrier layer is<br>
designed to contain a large amount of an inorganic pigment having a<br>
high refraction index and high opacity, contrary to a barrier layer used in<br>
a conventional medium for inkjet recording to thereby inhibit blotting of<br>
the coloring agent to the bottom side of the medium, namely to inhibit<br><br>
the phenomena that the printed color from the coloring agent is seen<br>
from the bottom side of the medium. Therefore, it is required that the<br>
barrier layer contains 30% by mass or more of an inorganic pigment<br>
having a refractive index of 1.5 or more, preferably 40% by mass or more<br>
of the same, and even more preferably from 50% by mass or more up to<br>
less than 90% by mass of the same. The barrier layer may optionally<br>
contain silica which has low opacity and low refractive index, used for<br>
the conventional recording medium for inkjet recording, but the content<br>
thereof needs to be 10% by mass or less as the above-mentioned blotting<br>
of the ink is increased and a cost is increased when a large amount of a<br>
highly transparent pigment is added. To sum up, by using a white<br>
pigment having a high refractive index in the barrier layer, a thinned<br>
barrier layer can be attained while reducing the blotting of the ink and<br>
the cost.<br>
Moreover, some of aluminum hydrate is generally listed as a<br>
pigment having a high refractive index. If such pigment as aluminum<br>
hydrate which has a high oil absorbing capacity is added at a large<br>
amount in the barrier layer, a solvent of the ink is not easily transferred<br>
to the support from the barrier layer. The aluminum hydrate absorbing<br>
a large amount of the solvent causes smear in an image due to<br>
discoloration or migration of the pigment during a long-term storage, and<br>
thus it is not acceptable in the present invention.<br>
The functions required for the barrier layer are to separate the<br>
pigment from the solvent in the ink, and to allow only the solvent to<br>
penetrate into the support. To this end, it is preferable that the barrier<br><br>
layer has fine cavities, i.e. pores, therein. In the case where no pore is<br>
present in the barrier layer, the penetration of the solvent in the ink is<br>
delayed, or the ink is hard to dry. However, if the diameter of the pores<br>
is excessively large or excessively large numbers of the pores are present<br>
in the barrier layer, the function to separate the pigment from the<br>
solvent of the ink is lowered, and thus an image density may be<br>
decreased, or the pigment present on the surface of the recording<br>
medium after printing starts migrating into the recording medium with<br>
age, resulting in a change in the color. Therefore, a diameter of the<br>
pores is preferably 1 µm or less, and an area of pores occupying in the<br>
surface of the recording medium is preferably 40% or less.<br>
The measurements for the diameter of the pores and the area of<br>
the pores occupying in the surface of the recording medium can be<br>
carried out by observing the surface of the recording medium on a<br>
photography taken by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).<br>
Based on the surface picture, an image of the area of the pores is<br>
translated into 2 digits, and a diameter and area ratio thereof can be<br>
obtained. In the present invention, a field emission scanning electron<br>
microscope HSM-7400F manufactured by JEOL Ltd. is used as a SEM<br>
instrument, and Pop Imaging Ver. 3.51 manufactured by Digital Being<br>
Kids Limited is used for image processing.<br>
Examples of the inorganic pigment for use in the present<br>
invention are: magnesium carbonate, talc, kaolin, illite, clay, calcium<br>
carbonate, calcium sulfite, titanium white, magnesium carbonate,<br>
titanium dioxide, and the like. By selecting and using the pigment<br><br>
having higher refraction index from these pigments, a thickness of the<br>
barrier layer can be thinned. In view of the cost, however, calcium<br>
carbonate and kaolin are preferable therefrom. These pigments can be<br>
used in combination provided that they do not adversely affect the effects<br>
of the present invention. Moreover, these pigments may also be used in<br>
combination with other pigments than the ones listed above. Kaolin is<br>
preferably used, because kaolin gives excellent gloss, and realizes a<br>
recording medium having a texture close to that of a medium for offset<br>
printing. Kaolin includes delaminated kaolin, fused kaolin, engineered<br>
kaolin which is surface processed, and the like. In view of glossiness,<br>
kaolin preferably has 50% by mass or more of kaolin particles which have<br>
a particle size distribution of such that 80% by mass or more of particles<br>
having the diameter of 2 µm or less, with respect to the total amount of<br>
kaolin particles. The content of kaolin is preferably 50 parts by mass or<br>
more. If the content is less than 50 parts by mass, an effect in<br>
glossiness cannot sufficiently be exhibited. There is no upper limit for<br>
the added amount of kaolin, but it is preferably less than 90 parts by<br>
mass in view of coating applicability under consideration of fluidity of<br>
kaolin, especially that increased viscosity at high shearing force.<br>
Moreover, such pigment having high refractive index can be used<br>
together with silica that has low refractive index or an organic pigment.<br>
Examples of the organic pigment include aqueous dispersion of particles<br>
such as styrene-acryl copolymer particles, styrene-butadiene copolymer<br>
particles, polystyrene particles, polyethylene particles, or the like. Two<br>
or more of these organic pigments may used in combination. Since the<br><br>
organic pigment gives excellent gloss and its relative mass is smaller<br>
compared to an inorganic pigment, a coating layer of desirable bulkiness,<br>
high gloss, and excellent coating ability can be attained. However, if the<br>
content of the organic pigment is less than 2 parts by mass, the above-<br>
mentioned effects cannot be attained. On the other hand, if the content<br>
is more than 5 parts by mass, ink setoff may occur and also it is not<br>
effective in terms of cost. The organic pigment has configurations such<br>
as solid, hollow, doughnut shaped, and the like. Considering the<br>
balance between gloss exhibition, surface coating ability, and fluidity of a<br>
coating liquid, it is preferable that the organic pigment has an average<br>
particle diameter of 0.2 µm to 3.0 µm, and it is more preferably that<br>
hollow organic pigment having void ratio of 40% or more is used.<br>
A binder of the barrier layer for use in the present invention is<br>
selected without any particular restriction, provided that it is a water-<br>
soluble resin, emulsion, and the like, which do not cause blocking.<br>
Examples of the water-soluble resin include polyvinyl alcohol, a starch<br>
such as an oxidized starch, an esterified starch, an enzyme modified<br>
starch, a cationatid starch, or the like, a cellulose derivative such as<br>
casein, soy protein, Carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, or<br>
the like, styrene-acryl copolymer, isobutylene-maleic anhydride, acrylic<br>
emulsion, polyvinyl acetate emulsion, vinylidene chloride emulsion,<br>
polyester emulsion, styrene-butadiene copolymer latex, acrylnitrile-<br>
butadiene copolymer latex, and the like. Among these, the starch and<br>
the styrene-butadiene copolymer latex are preferable for use in view of<br>
the cost.<br><br>
The styrene-butadiene copolymer latex is copolymer latex<br>
generally used for coating a paper, which contains styrene and butadiene<br>
as monomers, optionally contains other monomers to copolymerize, and<br>
optionally is a copolymer modified by a chemical reaction. Examples of<br>
the other monomers include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid alkyl ester of<br>
acrylic acid or methacylic acid, acrylnitrile, maleic acid, fumaric acid,<br>
vinyl monomer such as vinyl acetate, and the like. In addition, the<br>
styrene-butadiene copolymer latex optionally contains a crosslinking<br>
agent such as methylol melamine, methylol urea, methylol<br>
hydorxypropylene urea, isocyanate, or the like, or contains self-<br>
crosslinkable copolymer containing a unit such as N-methylolacrylamide.<br>
One of them may be used, or two or more of them may be used in<br>
combination in the styrene-butadiene copolymer latex.<br>
A solids content of the water-soluble binder is preferably 50% by<br>
mass to 70% by mass, more preferably 55% by mass to 60% by mass with<br>
respect to the total solids of the barrier layer.<br>
In the case where the solids content is small, the binding ability<br>
becomes insufficient, to thereby lower the strength of the ink accepting<br>
layer and the binding strength between the components within the layer<br>
to cause flaking.<br>
Other components can be added to the barrier layer, if necessary,<br>
provided that such components do not adversely affect the objects and<br>
effects of the present invention. Examples of such components include<br>
various agents usually mixed with a pigment for coating, such as a<br>
surfactant, a dispersing agent, a thickener, a moisture retainer, an<br><br>
antifoaming agent, a waterproof agent, or the like, and additives such as<br>
a pH controlling agent, a preservative, an antioxidizing agent, a cationic<br>
organic compound, or the like.<br>
The surfactant for use in the barrier layer can be selected from an<br>
anionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, an amphoteric surfactant, and a<br>
nonionic surfactant depending on the purpose without any restriction.<br>
Among the listed surfactants above, the nonionic surfactant is<br>
particularly preferable.<br>
Examples of the nonionic surfactant include a high alcohol<br>
ethylene oxide adduct, an alkylphenol ethylene oxide adduct, a fatty acid<br>
ethylene oxide adduct, a polyhydric alcohol fatty acid ester ethylene<br>
oxide adduct, a higher aliphatic amine ethylene oxide adduct, a fatty acid<br>
amide ethylene oxide adduct, an ethylene oxide adduct of oils and fats, a<br>
polypropylene glycol ethylene oxide adduct, fatty acid ester of glycerol,<br>
fatty acid ester of pentaerythritol, fatty acid ester of sorbitol and sorbitan,<br>
fatty acid ester of sucrose, alkyl ether of polyhydric alcohol, fatty acid<br>
amide of alkanol amide, and the like. As the nonionic surfactant, one of<br>
them may be used, or two or more of them may be used in combination.<br>
The polyhydric alcohol is appropriately selected without any<br>
restriction. Suitable examples thereof are glycerol, trimethylol propane,<br>
penterythrite, sorbitol, sucrose, and the like. Suitable examples of the<br>
ethylene oxide adduct include ethylene having a part of which is<br>
substituted with alkylene oxide such as propylene oxide or butylene<br>
oxide, provided that a water-solubility thereof is maintained. The<br>
substitution rate is preferably 50% or less. Hydrophilic-lipophilic<br><br>
balance (HLB) of the nonionic surfactant is preferably 4 to 15, more<br>
preferably 7 to 13.<br>
It is not necessary to add the cationic organic compound, but the<br>
cationic organic compound can be appropriately added depending on the<br>
purpose without any restriction.<br>
Examples of the cationic organic compound include a<br>
condensation product of dimethyl amine and epichlorohydrin, a<br>
condensation product of dimethyl amine, ammonium, and<br>
epichlorohydrin, poly(jethacrylic acid triethylaminoethyl-<br>
methylsulphate), a copolymer of polyacrylic amine and diacryl amine, a<br>
copolymer of polyvinyl amine, dicyane diamide, a condensation product of<br>
dicyane diamide, ammonium chloride, urea, and formaldehyde, a<br>
condensation product of polyalkylene polyamine and ammonium dicyane<br>
diamide, dimethyldiarylammonium chloride, polydiarylmethylamine<br>
hydrochloride, poly(diaryldimethylammoniumchloride),<br>
poly(diaryldimethylammoniumchloride-sulfur dioxide),<br>
poly (diaryldimethylammoniumchloride - diarylamine hydrochloride<br>
derivative), a copolymer of acrylamine and<br>
diaryldimethylammoniumchloride, a copolymer of acrylate, acrylamide,<br>
and diarylamine hydrochloride, polyethyleneimine, ethylene imine<br>
derivative such as acrylamine polymer or the like, a modified product of<br>
polyethyleneimine alkylene oxide, and the like. One of them may be<br>
used, or two or more of them may be used in combination as the cationic<br>
organic compound.<br>
Support-<br><br>
The support for use in he present invention is one produced hy<br>
mixing chemical pulps, mechanical pulps, recycled pulps and the like at a<br>
predetermined ratio, optionally adding therein an internally adding<br>
sizing agent, a retention aid, a paper strength additive, and the like, and<br>
making paper from the mixture by means of a fourdrinier former, a gap-<br>
type twin-wire formed, or a hybride former that is a fordrinier having its<br>
latter part modified with twin-wire.<br>
The pulps used for the support contains- virgin chemical pulp<br>
(CP) which is obtained by chemically treating wood and its fibrous<br>
material, such as a bleached hardwood kraft pulp, a bleached softwood<br>
kraft pulp, an unbleached hard wood kraft pulp, an unbleached soft wood<br>
kraft pulp, a bleached hard wood sulfite pulp, a bleached softwood sulfite<br>
pulp, an unbleached hardwood sulfite pulp, an unbleached softwood<br>
sulfite pulp, and the like; and virgin mechanical pulp (MP) which is<br>
obtained by mechanically treating wood and its fibrous material, such as<br>
a ground pulp, a chemiground pulp, a chemi-mechanical pulp, a semi-<br>
chemical pulp, and the like.<br>
The recycle pulp can also be used in the support, and raw<br>
materials of the recycle pulp are, for example, papers defined as terms of<br>
"high white", "line white", "cream white", "card", "special white", "mild<br>
white", "imitation", "color high", "Kent", "white art", "special high cut",<br>
"separate high cut", "news paper", "magazine", and the like in Standard<br>
Chart of Recycled Paper, produced by Paper Recycling Promotion Center<br>
that is Japanese non-profit foundation (the above-mentioned definitions<br>
can be found in the chart). Specific examples include: printing papers<br><br>
such as a non-coated paper for personal computers, that is paper for<br>
information technology or the like, a thermosensitive paper, a pressure<br>
sensitive paper, and the like," a recycled OA paper such as paper for PPC;<br>
an art paper, a coated paper, a slightly coated paper, a matt paper, and<br>
the like; recycle papers or cardboards of high quality papers, of high<br>
quality color papers, of a paper from note books, of a paper from letter<br>
pads, of lapping papers, of fancy papers, of middle quality papers, of<br>
news paper, of bank papers, of lapping papers used in supermarkets, of<br>
imitation papers, of pure-white rolling papers, of non-coated papers such<br>
as milk cartons, and the like, and those examples listed above are papers<br>
containing chemical pulps, papers containing high yield pulps, and the<br>
like. One of these may be used or two or more of them may be used in<br>
combination as the recycled pulp.<br>
The recycled pulp is generally produced by the combination of the<br>
following four steps.<br>
(1)	Breaking out of a recycled paper is carrier out by treating the paper<br>
with mechanical force or chemical by means of a pulper so as to break<br>
down to fibers, and detaching the printing ink from the fibers.<br>
(2)	Removal of dusts is carried out by removing foreign substances and<br>
dusts obtained in the recycled paper by a screen or a cleaner.<br>
(3)	Removal of an ink is carrier out by removing the detached ink from<br>
the fibers using a surfactant in accordance with a flotation method or<br>
washing method, to thereby remove from the system.<br>
(4)	Bleaching is carrier out by using an oxidation reaction or a reduction<br>
reaction to thereby increase whiteness of the fibers.<br><br>
In the case where the recycled pulp is added to the pulp used for<br>
the support, the mixing amount of the recycled pulp is preferably 40% or<br>
less based on the total amount of the pulp for the purpose of preventing<br>
curling of the support after recording.<br>
As an additive used in the support, calcium carbonate is effective,<br>
but calcium carbonate can be used in combination with inorganic<br>
additives such as kaolin, calcined clay, pyrophylite, sericite, silicic acids<br>
such as talc, and the like, satin white, barium sulfate, calcium sulfate,<br>
zinc sulfate, and organic pigments such as a plastic pigment, a urea resin,<br>
and the like.<br>
The internally adding sizing agent for use in the support is<br>
suitably selected from conventional internally adding sizing agents used<br>
for inkjet recording mediums, without any particular restrictions.<br>
Suitable internally adding sizing agents are, for example, a rosin<br>
emulsion sizing agent, and the like. The internally adding sizing agent<br>
used at the time when a sheet of the support is made is, for example,<br>
neutral rosin sizing agent used for making neutral paper, alkenyl<br>
succinic anhydride (ASA), alkyl ketene dimer (AKD), petroleum resin<br>
sizing agent, or the Eke. Among these, the neutral rosin sizing agent or<br>
alkenyl succinic anhydride is particularly suitable. In the case where<br>
alkyl ketene dimer is used, the addition amount thereof can be small<br>
since alkyl ketene dimer has a high sizing effect. However, alkyl ketene<br>
dimer reduces friction coefficient of a surface of the recording medium,<br>
and thus the surface of the recording medium becomes easy to slip.<br><br>
Therefore, use of alkyl ketene dimer is not preferable in term of transfer<br>
performance of the recording medium at the time of inkjet recording.<br>
The addition amount of the internally adding sizing agent is 0.1 parts by<br>
mass to 0.7 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of bone-dry<br>
pulp, but it may be adjusted depending on the purpose.<br>
The internal additives for use in the support are, for example,<br>
conventional pigments as a white pigment. Examples of the white<br>
pigment include- inorganic white pigments such as precipitated calcium<br>
carbonate, heavy calcium carbonate (limestone powder), kaolin, clay, talc,<br>
calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, zinc sulfide,<br>
zinc carbonate, satin white, aluminum silicate, silious earth, calcium<br>
silicate, magnesium silicate, synthetic silica, aluminum hydroxide,<br>
alumina, lithopone, zeolite, magnesium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide,<br>
and the like; organic pigments such as styrene plastic pigment, acrylic<br>
plastic pigment, polyethylene, microcapsule, urea resin, melamine resin,<br>
and the like. One of these may be used, or two or more of these may be<br>
used in combination as the internal additive.<br>
-Method for forming a barrier layer-<br>
A method for forming a barrier layer on the support is not<br>
restricted, but can be selected from a method for directly coating, a<br>
method for coating on a temporally substrate, and then transferring to<br>
the support, and a method for atomizing using a spray or the like.<br>
Examples of the method for directly coating include a rollcoater method,<br>
an air-knife coater method, a gate-roll coater method, a size-press<br>
method, a shim-sizer method, a film transfer system such as rod-<br><br>
metaling size press coater, a blade coater system by fountain or roll<br>
application, and the like.<br>
A drying treatment of the barrier layer can be performed, for<br>
example, by using a hot drying hearth or a heat drum. Moreover, the<br>
barrier layer may further be subjected to a surface treatment by using a<br>
calender device, i.e. super calender, soft calender, gloss calender, or the<br>
like, for the purpose of smoothing the surface, or increasing the strength<br>
of the surface.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the barrier layer for use in the present<br>
invention can be disposed by coating. After the present inventors had<br>
conducted numbers of studies, it was found that functions of a barrier<br>
layer could be attained by polishing a surface of a conventional coated<br>
paper for printing. This is probably because a thickness of a coat layer<br>
of the conventional coated paper is reduced to a thickness of the barrier<br>
layer suitable for the present invention by polishing, and functions as a<br>
barrier layer are exhibited as a result of removing a resin layer present<br>
on the outermost surface of the coating by polishing and exposing pores<br>
presented inside to the surface.<br>
Specific examples of the conventional coated paper include-<br>
coated paper used for commercial printing, i.e. off-set printing, gravure<br>
printing, and the like, such as art paper (A0 size, A1 size), A2 size coated<br>
paper, A3 size coated paper, B2 size coated paper, lightweight coated<br>
paper, finely coated paper, and the like.<br>

The conventional formula for a coating layer of the commercial<br>
recording paper generally shown in various documents is, for example,<br>
mixing 10 parts to 15 parts by a binder, e.g. a resin, emulsion, starch,<br>
and the like, with 100 parts of an inorganic pigment, e.g. kaolin, calcium<br>
carbonate, and the like. Analyzing the condition of the pigment present<br>
in the coating layer, specifically the density deviation of the pigment<br>
within the coating layer, the following possible questions can be<br>
considered" (1) a clear layer formed on the outermost layer of the coated<br>
film, when a coating liquid is used, and (2) the binder component is<br><br>
penetrated into a base paper, and thus a density distribution is<br>
dissymmetrical between the upper layer and the bottom layer.<br>
Regarding the problem (1), the present inventors studied the<br>
publications of this field (publication related to glossiness or the like of a<br>
coated paper). However, it seemed that this problem had not been<br>
actively discussed in the art. It is assumed that the coating liquid of the<br>
coating layer contains a low mixing rate of the resin compared to general<br>
coating liquid, the enough amount of the resin is not contained to<br>
precipitate in the surface, and thus a clear layer or the like is not easily<br>
formed.<br>
In the occasion of the discussion with other engineers in the field<br>
of commercial coated paper, there were people who believed that the<br>
binder for use in the commercial coated paper needed to be added at a<br>
minimum amount, since some believed that the functions of the binder<br>
were to prevent pealing of a layer at the time of printing, and to<br>
maintain just enough strength to prevent flaking off of the powder at the<br>
time of cutting the paper, and a coating process was likely to be affected<br>
if the addition amount of the resin was increased.<br>
With regard to the problem (2), though phenomena such that a<br>
ratio of the resin in the actual coating layer becomes lower than the rat<br>
of the resin in the coating liquid in the process of penetrating the resin of<br>
the coating liquid into the base paper, and a layer is formed between the<br>
coating layer and the base layer, no case has been recognized (even in<br>
publications) regarding the generation of deviation within the layer itself.<br>
However, there is a case that a resin-rich layer is formed at interfere<br><br>
between the coating layer and the base paper. In this case, it is<br>
assumed that the bottom layer has higher density of the resin.<br>
A method for polishing an outermost surface of the coating layer<br>
is, for example, a method which uses a sand paper or wrapping paper for<br>
polishing, a method which uses a wire-brush for polishing, a method<br>
which uses a polishing roller, or polishing endless belt for polishing, a<br>
method which uses sand blast for polishing, or the like. However,<br>
examples of the polishing method are not limited to those listed above.<br>
The polishing treatment can be performed just before drying, or<br>
either before or after conducting a calendering treatment in the process<br>
of producing a coat paper. Alternatively, the polishing treatment may<br>
be curried out by appropriately arranging a polishing process after a<br>
coating process, for example, after a slitting process, or after a wrapping<br>
process. Moreover, the polishing treatment can be performed by users<br>
by using a polishing device before conducting printing. It is also<br>
possible to integrate the polishing device into a printer, and to perform<br>
the polishing treatment every time printing is conducted.<br>
For the polishing treatment, an entire surface of a recording<br>
medium may be polished, or only an area where an inkjet recording is<br>
performed may be selectively polished.<br>
For example, off-set printing or gravure printing is previously<br>
performed on the general recording medium exemplified above, the<br>
recording medium is then subjected to the polishing treatment at where<br>
inkjet recording is performed, and inkjet recording is actually conducted<br>
on a part of the recording medium where previously polished.<br><br>
According to this method, a hybrid printing, which have<br>
conventionally been performed by using both an inkjet recording medium<br>
and a general recording medium, can be performed by using only a<br>
general recording medium, and a unification of a recording medium can<br>
be realized between general printing and inkjet printing. In addition,<br>
printing of address, which is difficult to be done by general printing, can<br>
be performed by inkjet printing.<br>
The polishing device may be integrated into a unit of a printer, or<br>
be independently prepared as a separate unit.<br>
Moreover, a recording medium of the present invention can be<br>
replaced with a special coated paper, provided that the coated paper<br>
satisfies the requirements defined in the present invention. Especially,<br>
a coated paper which has high air permeability of a coating layer itself<br>
can be used in the present invention. Examples of such coated paper<br>
having high air permeability are: some coated paper for<br>
electrophotography, coated paper for gravure printing, and the like.<br>
Specific examples thereof include POD Gloss Coat manufactured by Oji<br>
Paper Co., Ltd., FL Gravure manufacture by Nippon Paper Group, Inc.,<br>
Ace manufactured by Nippon Paper Group, Inc., and the like. The<br>
coating layer of these coated papers has large number of pores, and thus<br>
these coated papers can be used as a replacement of the recording<br>
medium having the barrier layer of the present invention.<br>
[Ink for inkjet recording]<br>
The ink for inkjet recording has extremely high permeability, and<br>
a surface tension of 20 mN/m to 35 mN/m at 25°C, preferably 23 mN/m to<br><br>
33 mN/n at 25°C. If the surface tension of the ink is less than 20 mN/n,<br>
the ink attached to the surface of the nozzle head cannot be completely<br>
removed after head-wiping operation, and thus it may adversely affect<br>
the reliability of the head after leaving for a long period. If the surface<br>
tension of the ink is more than 35 mN/m, the permeability of the ink to a<br>
recording medium may be degraded. As a result of this, dots formed<br>
from the ink droplet may not have sufficient wet-speadability, and the<br>
effects for reducing the occurrence of beading may be reduced.<br>
Moreover, the ink for inkjet recording has a viscosity of 5 mPa-s<br>
or more, and preferably ranging from 5 mPa-s to 20 mPa•s at 25°C. If<br>
the viscosity is less than 5 mPa-s, it may adversely affect to the medium,<br>
in terms of occurrence of beading, or transfer ability such as the<br>
occurrence of cockling. If the viscosity is more than 20 mPa•s, the<br>
viscosity is largely increased at the low temperature, such as 10°C, and it<br>
may adversely affect ejection reliability of the head, reliability for nozzle<br>
clogging.<br>
-Coloring agent-<br>
The coloring agent for use in the ink of the present invention is,<br>
for example, a hydrophobic dye, a pigment, or the like. The hydrophobic<br>
dye is a dye which has insolubility or poor solubility to water, but is<br>
soluble to an organic solvent. Examples of the hydrophobic dye include<br>
oilsoluble dyes, dispersible dyes, and the like. These hydrophobic dyes<br>
can be used as a polymer emulsion wherein the hydrophobic dye is<br>
contained in the polymer. Considering its adsorption and/or easiness of<br>
encapsulation, the oil-soluble dye and the dispersible dye are preferably<br><br>
used, but the pigment is particularly preferable in terms of the light<br>
fastness of the obtained image.<br>
The above-mentioned expression "the hydrophobic dye is<br>
contained in the polymer" means both the conditions of the hydrophobic<br>
dye being encapsulated in polymer fine particles, and the hydrophobic<br>
dye being attached to the surface of the polymer fine particles. Here,<br>
not all of the coloring agent contained in the ink need to be encapsulated<br>
in or attached to the polymer fine particles. The coloring agent can be<br>
dispersed in the emulsion, provided that it does not adversely affect the<br>
effects of the present invention. The coloring agent can be selected<br>
without any restriction, as long as it has insolubility or poor solubility to<br>
water, and is absorbed with a polymer. In the present specification, the<br>
term "insolubility to water", or "poor solubility to water" defines the<br>
condition such that 100 parts by mass of 20°C water dissolves no more<br>
than 0.1 parts by mass of the coloring agent. Here, the term "dissolve"<br>
means that the separation or precipitation of the coloring agent is not<br>
observed with naked eyes in the surface or bottom part of the solution.<br>
Examples of the pigment include a black pigment, and a color<br>
pigment. Examples of the black pigment include carbon black and the<br>
like. Examples of the color pigment include anthraquinone,<br>

Pigment Red 86, 87, 88, 181, and 198; CI. Pigment Violet 36 and 38.<br>
Examples of heterocyclic yellow include CI. Pigment Yellow 117 and 138.<br>
Other suitable examples of the pigment were listed in "The Color Index,<br>
The Society of Dyers and Colorists, 1982".<br>
The pigment for use in the ink of the present invention may be a<br>
pigment having directly or, via another group of atoms, at least one<br>
hydrophilic group on the surface thereof. Such the pigment can be<br>
stably dispersed without the assistance of a dispersant. The pigment<br>
wherein a hydrophilic group is introduced onto the surface thereof is<br>
preferably an ionic pigment, more preferably the one anionicly or<br>
cationicly charged.<br>
Examples f the anionic hydrophilic group include the groups<br>
expressed as follows" COOM, SO3M, -PO3HM, PO3M2, SO2NH2, and-<br>
SO2NHCOR (note that M denotes one selected from the group consisting<br>
of a hydrogen atom, alkali metal, ammonium, and organic ammonium,<br>
and R denotes one selected from a C1-12 alkyl group, a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted phenyl group, and a substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl<br>
group). Among them, the pigment having COOM, or -SO3M bonded<br>
onto the surface thereof is preferable. The method for obtaining the<br><br>
anioicly charged pigment is, for example, a method wherein a pigment is<br>
subjected to an oxidation treatment using sodium hypochlorite, a method<br>
wherein a pigment is subjected to a sulfonation treatment, a method<br>
wherein the pigment is reacted with a diazonium salt, or the like, but not<br>
limited thereto.<br>

copolymer, vinyl acetate-maleic ester copolymer, vinyl acetate-crotonic<br>
acid copolymer, vinyl acetate-acrylic acid copolymer, and the like.<br>
The nonionic or anionic activating dispersant for dispersing the<br>
pigment can be appropriately selected depending on the pigment for use<br><br>
or components of the ink. Examples of the nonionic surfactant as the<br>
dispersant include: polyoxyethylenealkylether such as<br>

surfactant which is at least one selected from the one listed above<br>
wherein a part of polyoxyethylene is substituted with polyoxypropylene,<br>
a surfactant which is a compound having an aromatic ring, e.g.<br>
polyoxyethylenealkylphenylether, is condensed with formaldehyde<br><br>
In the general formula 1, R1 denotes a C1-20 alkyl group, aryl<br>
group, or aralkyl group group. L denotes 0 or an integer ranging from 1-<br>
7. n denotes an integer ranging from 20200, preferably 20-100, more<br><br>
preferably 3050.<br>
Examples of the C1-20 alkyl group for RL include methyl group,<br>
ethyl group, n-propyl group, i-propyl group, n-butyl group, i-butyl group,<br>
t-butyl group, n-pentyl group, i-pentyl group, cyclopentyl group, n-hexyl<br>
group, i-hexyl group, cyclohexyl group, n-heptyl group, i-heptyl group, rr<br>
octyl group, i-octyl group, n-nonyl group, i-nonyl group, n-decyl group, i-<br>

group, cyclooctyl group, and the like.<br>
Examples of the aralkyl group for RL include benzyl group,<br>
phenethyl group, 2-methylbenzyl group, 3-methylbenzyl group, 4-<br>
methylbenzyl group, and the like.<br>
The HLB value of the nonionic surfactant is preferably the range<br>
of 12 or more but 19.5 or less, more preferably the range of 13 or more<br>
but 19 or less. If the nonionic surfactant has HLB value of less than 12,<br>
the surfactant does not have good compatibility to the dispersion medium,<br>
and thus dispersion stability is lowered. If the nonionic surfactant has<br>
HLB value of more than 19.5, the surfactant does not have good<br>
compatibility to the pigment, and thus dispersion stability is lowered.<br>
Examples of the anionic surfactant include<br>
polyoxyethylenealkylether sulfate, polyoxyethylenealkylphenylether<br>
sulphate, polyoxyethylenemonostyrylphenylether sulphate,<br>
polyoxyethylenedistyrylphenylether suphate, polyoxyethylenealkylether<br>

polyoxyethylenedistyrylphenylether are particularly preferable.<br>
The content of the surfactant as.the dispersant is preferably 10%<br>
by mass to 50% by mass relative to the amount of the pigment. If the<br>
content of the dispersant is less than 10% by mass, storage stability of<br>
the dispersed pigment and ink is lowered, or extremely long time is<br>
required for dispersing the pigment. If the content of the dispersant is<br>
more than 50% by mass, the viscosity of the ink becomes excessively high,<br>
and thus ejection stability becomes lowered.<br>
Moreover, a resin-coated coloring agent is also used as the<br>
coloring agent. The resin-coated coloring agent is precisely explained<br>
hereinafter.<br>
The resin-coated coloring agent is formed of polymer emulsion<br>
including polymer fine particles which contain the coloring agent having<br>
insolubility or poor solubility to water. The expression "polymer fine<br><br>
particles which contain, the coloring agent " means both the conditions of<br>
the coloring agent being encapsulated in polymer fine particles, and the<br>
coloring agent being attached to the surface of the polymer fine particles.<br>
Here, not all of the coloring agent contained in the ink need to be<br>
encapsulated in or attached to the polymer fine particles. The coloring<br>
agent can be dispersed in the emulsion, provided that it does not<br>
adversely affect the effects of the present invention. The coloring agent<br>
can be selected without any restriction, as long as it has insolubility or<br>
poor solubility to water, and is absorbed with a polymer. In the present<br>
specification, the term "insolubility to water" or "poor solubility to water"<br>
defines the condition such that 100 parts by mass of 20°C water dissolves<br>
no more than 0.1 parts by mass of the coloring agent. Here, the term<br>
"dissolve" means that the separation or precipitation of the coloring<br>
agent is not observed with naked eyes in the surface or bottom part of<br>
the solution.<br>
Examples of the coloring agent include a hydrophobic dye such as<br>
an oil-soluble dye, dispersible dye or the like, the pigment, and the like.<br>
Considering its adsorption and/or easiness of encapsulation, the oil-<br>
soluble dye and the dispersible dye are preferably used, but the pigment<br>
is particularly preferable in terms of the light fastness of the obtained<br>
image.<br>
Examples of the hydrophobic dye are listed below.<br>
Examples of the oil-soluble dye include each product number of<br>
C.I. Solvent Black, C.I. Solvent Yellow, C.I. Solvent Red, C.I. Solvent<br>
Violet, CI. Solvent Blue, C.I. Solvent Green, and C.I. Solvent Orange.<br><br>
These are available from Orient Chemical Industries, Ltd., BASF Japan<br>
Ltd., and the like.<br>
Examples of the dispersible dye include each product number of<br>
C.I. Disperse Yellow, C.I. Disperse Orange, C.I. Disperse Red, C.I.<br>

these, preferable dyes are C.I. Solvent Yellow 29 and 30 for yellow, C.I.<br>
Solvent Blue 79 for cyan, C.I. Solvent Red 18 and 49 for magenta, and<br>
C.I. Solvent Black 3 and 7 and nigrosin black dye for black. Note that<br>
examples of the hydrophobic dye are not necessarily limited to these<br>
listed above.<br>
The coloring agent for use in the present invention is preferably<br>
dissolved in an organic solvent such as a ketone solvent at a rate of 2g/L<br>
or higher, more preferably at a rate of 20g/L to 600g/L, in view of<br>
efficient impregnation into polymer fine-particles. Examples of a<br>
polymer comprised of the polymer emulsion include vinyl polymer,<br>
polyester polymer, polyurethane polymer, and the like. Especially, vinyl<br>
polymer and polyester polymer are preferably used, and their specific<br>
examples are the polymers disclosed in JP-A Nos, 200053897, and 2001-<br>
139849.<br>
The content of the coloring agent is preferably 10 parts by mass<br>
to 200 parts by mass, more preferably 25 parts by mass to 150 parts by<br>
mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the polymer. The average<br>
particle diameter of the polymer fine particles containing the coloring<br>
agent is preferably 0.16 µm or less in the ink.<br>
The solids content of the polymer fine particles is preferably 8%<br><br><br>
by mass to 20% by mass, more preferably 8% by mass to 12% by mass in<br>
the ink.<br>
-Surfactant-<br>
The present invention achieves the significant improvements in<br>
wettability, and permeability to the recording medium by adding a<br>
surfactant, especially a fluorochemical surfactant having a certain<br>
structure. This particular fluorochemical surfactant having a certain<br>
structure has characteristics those dissimilar to the ones of the<br>
conventional fluorochemical surfactant. The conventional<br>
fluorochemical surfactant tends to have high foamability, and most of the<br>
available conventional flurochemical surfactants are prone to form<br>
bubbles. It has been known in the art that this foamability adversely<br>
affects loading ability of the ink or ejecting stability of the ink. However,<br>
the fluorochemical surfactant having a certain structure for use in the<br>
present invention maintains its foamability very low, and thus the<br>
obtained ink has excellent loading ability, ejecting stability, and safety.<br>
In addition, the obtained ink has high coloring ability and uniform<br>
dispersibility of the coloring agent on a recording medium for inkjet<br>
recording for use in the present invention. Because of this particular<br>
effect in permeability, occurrences of beading are prevented, and thus<br>
excellent images can be formed. The precise mechanisms thereof have<br>
not yet been completely found out, but it is assumed that the<br>
fluorochemical surfactant having a certain structure has excellent<br>
leveling performance, and exhibits a high effect in leveling a surface<br>
tension at an interfere between air and liquid, due to its structure.<br><br>
Moreover, it is understood that this characteristic bring a high effect in<br>
preventing to form bubbles, and this high leveling performance on the<br>
recording medium leads an effect in uniformly dispersing the coloring<br>
agent, and uniformly wetting and spreading a diameter of a picture<br>
element, and as a result, the occurrence of beading is greatly inhibited.<br>
Based on these understandings, it is assumed that prints of high quality,<br>
excellent density, glossiness, and image reliability, which is similar to<br>
those of commercial printing, can be attained at low cost, by combining<br>
the recording medium for inkjet recording described in the present<br>
specification and the pigment ink of inkjet recording described in the<br>
present specification. Moreover, from the same reasons, there can be<br>
provided the desirable ink for inkjet recording, ink set for inkjet<br>
recording, ink media set for inkjet recording, ink cartridge, inkjet<br>
recording method, and inkjet recording apparatus having reliability for<br>
preventing clogging, and storage stability.<br>

hydrogen atom or a group containing a fluorine atom, each of R3 and R4<br>
denotes a group containing a fluorine atom, and each of e, m, p, q, and r<br>
denotes an integer.<br>
Other than using the fluorochemical surfactant expressed by the<br>
structural formula 1 alone, the florochemical surfactant expressed by the<br>
structural formula 1 can be used in combination with the following<br>
fluorochemical surfactants in the present invention. Examples of such<br>
fluorochemical surfactants include perfluoroaltylsulfonate,<br>
perfluoroalkylcarboxylate, perfluoroalkylphosphate,<br>
perfluoroalkylethyleneoxide adducts, perfluoroalkylbetaine,<br>
perfluoroalkylamineoxide compounds, and the like. Examples of the<br>
commercially available products of such fluorochemical surfactants<br>
include: Surflon S-111, S112, S113, S-121, S131, S132, S141, and S-<br>
145 (msnufactured by Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.); FLUORAD FC 93, FC-95,<br>
FC-98, FC-129, FC-135, FC170C, FC-430, FC-431, and FC4430<br>
(manufactured by Sumitomo 3M Limited); Megafack F-470, F-1405, and<br>
F-474 (manufactured by Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals Inc.); Zonyl FS-300,<br>
FSN, FSN-100, FSO (manufactured by DuPont Kabushiki Kaisha);<br>
EFTOP EF-351, EF-352, EF-801, and EF-802 (manufactured by JEMCO<br>
Inc). Among them, Zonyl FS-300, FSN, FSN-100, and FSO<br>
(manufactured by DuPont Kabushiki Kaisha) are particularly preferable<br>
in view of excellent reliability and improved color development.<br>
Other examples of the surfactants which can be used in<br>
combination with the above-mentioned fluorochemical surfactant include<br>
surfactants such as polyoxyethylenealkyletheracetate,<br><br>
dialkylsulfosuccinate, polyoxyethylenealkylether,<br>
polyoxyethylenealkylphenylether, a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene<br>
block copolymer, polyoxyethylenealkylester, polyoxyethylene sorbitan<br>
fatty acid ester, acetylene glycol, and the like. Specifically, by using<br>
polyoxyethylenealkyletheracetate and/or dialkylsulfosuccinate having a<br>
C5-7 branched alkyl chain, the wettability is improved towards normal<br>
paper. These surfactants listed above can be stably present in the ink of<br>
the present invention without adversely affecting the dispersing<br>
condition of the ink.<br>
-Penetrating agent-<br>
The penetrating agent for use in the present invention is C7-11<br>
polyol, or the like. Examples of C7-11 polyol include 2ethyl-l,3-<br>
hexandiol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-l,3-pentandiol, and the like. The content of<br>
the penetrating agent is preferably 0.1% by mass to 20% by mass, more<br>
preferably 0.5% by mass to 10% by mass. In the case where the content<br>
of the penetrating agent is less than the above-mentioned range, the<br>
penetration of the ink into the paper may be decreased, and this may<br>
cause soiling on the paper as a result of the friction caused by a roller at<br>
the time of transferring the paper, or may cause soiling on the<br>
transferring belt at the time of reversing the side of the paper for the<br>
purpose of double-side printing. Therefore, such ink cannot be used for<br>
high-speed printing, or double-side printing. In the case where the<br>
content is more than the above-mentioned range, a diameter of printed<br>
dots becomes excessively large, and thus line width of character becomes<br>
wide or image definition is lowered.<br><br>
Solid moisture retainer-<br>
The second embodiment of the ink of the present invention<br>
contains dipeptide as a solid moisture retainer, and by adding the<br>
dipeptide which is at least one selected from the group consisting of<br>
alanyl glutamine, glycyl glutamine, bisalanylcystine, and<br>
bisglycylcystine to the ink, all of the reliability for preventing clogging,<br>
the reliability for transferring a recording medium, e.g. prevention of<br>
beading or cockling, and the image reliability are attained at the same<br>
time.<br>
The solid moisture retainer defines a compound which has<br>
moisture retaining functions, is a solid water-soluble compound at a<br>
room temperature of 25°C, is dissolved or partially dissolved in the<br>
vehicle of the ink, and does not adversely affect the dispersion stability of<br>
the pigment (not causing aggregation of the pigment) contained in the<br>
ink.<br>
Among dipeptide used as the solid moisture retainer, alanyl<br>
glutamine has extremely high water-solubility at 20°C or lower compared<br>
to conventional amino acids, and does not adversely affect the dispersion<br>
stability of the pigment at the time being added to the ink. Moreover,<br>
alanyl glutamine can be added to the ink at 1 part by mass to 20 parts by<br>
mass, preferably 3 parts by mass to 10 parts by mass in solids content.<br>
In the case where the solids content is less than 1 part by mass in the ink,<br>
the effect of preventing clogging cannot be attained. In the case where<br>
the solids content is more than 20 parts by mass, the viscosity of the ink<br>
becomes excessively high, and thus it affects stability for preventing<br><br>
clogging. In the present invention, dipeptide contributes the stability of<br>
the ink for preventing clogging. This is probably because dipeptide has<br>
high water-solubility, is stably dissolved in the ink due to its water-<br>
solubility, and thus does not adversely affect the dispersion stability of<br>
the pigment as the coloring agent. Moreover, dipeptide is present in the<br>
ink while having weak compatibility to the pigment, and thus it is<br>
assumed that dipeptide also functions as a dispersion stabilizer in the<br>
ink. Dipeptide also has an effect in retaining moisture. For example,<br>
alanine is a natural moisture retaining substance present in a horny<br>
layer of humans, glutamine is a substance easily absorbed in cells of<br>
humans, and alanyl glutamine which is comprised both alanine and<br>
glutamine is a highly safe moisture retaining substance widely used for<br>
cosmetic products, and medicines of skins for external application. It is<br>
assumed that these high moisture retaining abilities of dipeptide<br>
contribute to a stability of the ink for preventing clogging in combination<br>
with its water-solubility contributing to the pigment dispersion.<br>
Specifically, water retaining ability of the ink is maintained even the ink<br>
is present adjacent to the nozzle, and aggregations of the pigments are<br>
prevented at the time of drying. As a result, a significantly high<br>
reliability of the ink for preventing clogging can be exhibited. With<br>
regard to the image reliability, dipeptide contributes to improve fixing<br>
ability of the ink of the present invention having low absorption ability to<br>
the recording medium, to lower occurrence of beading, and to prevent<br>
curling or cockling at the time of printing as a moisture content of the<br>
ink is relatively reduced. This is because dipeptide can be added to the<br><br>
ink at a large amount in solids content, without adversely affecting the<br>
dispersion condition of the pigment and penetration of the ink into low<br>
price recording mediums, and a moisture content of the ink can be<br>
relatively reduced. It is assumed that significant effects are exhibited<br>
against the problems to be solved in the present invention, by using the<br>
particular ink and the particular recording medium in combination in<br>
the present invention.<br>
The above-mentioned expression "a moisture content of the ink is<br>
relatively reduced" means a relative moisture content of the ink which<br>
dipeptide is not included is reduced inversely proportional to the solids<br>
content of dipeptide to be added, by adding dipeptide to the ink.<br>
-Water-dispersible resin-<br>
The water-dispersible resin for use in the first embodiment of the<br>
ink of the present invention is preferably at least one selected from the<br>
group consisting of polyurethane resin emulsion, and acryl-silicone resin<br>
emulsion. These may be used in combination. At the time of using the<br>
water-dispersible resin as a raw material in course of preparing the ink,<br>
or after preparing the ink, the water-dispersible resin is present as an oil<br>
in water emulsion. <br>
In the case where at least one of the above-listed water-<br>
dispersible resins is used, the solids content of the emulsion in the ink is<br>
1% by mass to 40% by mass, preferably 1% by mass to 20% by mass.<br>
Examples of the polyurethane resin emulsion include the one<br>
wherein a relatively hydrophilic polyurethane resin is externally added<br>
with an emulsifier to thereby emulsified, and a self-emulsified emulsion<br><br>
wherein a functional group served as an emulsifier is introduced into a<br>
resin by copolymerization or the like. An anionic self-emulsified<br>
polyurethane resin emulsion always has excellent dispersion stability,<br>
considering the combination with the pigments selected for use in the<br>
present invention. The anionic self-emulsified polyurethane resin<br>
emulsion has preferably an ether type of polyurethane resin, rather than<br>
polyester or polycarbonate type thereof, in terms of fixing ability to the<br>
pigment and dispersion stability. Although specific reasons have not yet<br>
been known, the non-ether type thereof tends to have weak solvent<br>
resistance, and tends to cause aggregation or increase in the viscosity<br>
when the ink is stored at a high temperature.<br>
An average particle diameter of the ether type of polyurethane<br>
resin emulsion is 300 nm or less, preferably 100 nm or less, more<br>
preferably 80 nm or less. By controlling the average particle diameter<br>
specifically 100 nm or less, a reliability of the inkjet recording apparatus,<br>
e.g. ink ejecting stability after storing for a long period, is improved.<br>
The glass transition temperature of the ether type of<br>
polyurethane resin emulsion is preferably in the range of -50°C to 150°C,<br>
more preferably in the range of -10°C to 100°C. In the case where the<br>
glass transition temperature thereof is more than 150°C, a film formed<br>
with the ether type of polyurethane resin emulsion becomes hard like a<br>
glass, but the pigment particles and the ether type of polyurethane resin<br>
emulsion come to an impact with a recording medium at the same time<br>
at the time of printing, and thus obtained image has relatively low<br>
abrasion resistance. In the case where the glass transition temperature<br><br>
is 150°C or less, a film formed with the ether type of polyurethane resin<br>
emulsion is soft, and rubber like, but has excellent abrasion resistance.<br>
If the glass transition temperature is less than -50°C, the film however<br>
becomes excessively soft, and the abrasion resistance is lowered.<br>
Therefore, it was found that the preferable range of the glass transition<br>
temperature was from -50°C to 150°C in view of the abrasion resistance<br>
of the print. In the present invention, the glass transition temperature<br>
of the resin can be measured either by a differential scanning calorimeter<br>
(DSC) or thermomechanical analysis (TMA).<br>
The minimum film forming temperature of the ether type of<br>
polyurethane resin emulsion is preferably a room temperature or lower,<br>
more preferably 25°C or lower. It is preferred that a film formation of<br>
the ether type of polyurethane resin emulsion is carried out at a room<br>
temperature or lower, especially at 25°C or lower, since the bonding to<br>
the fibers in the paper is automatically performed without proceeding<br>
any special treatment such as heating or drying.<br>
The minimum film forming temperature (MFT) is defined as a<br>
minimum temperature to form a transparent continuous film when an<br>
aqueous emulsion particles obtained by dispersing the ether type of<br>
polyurethane emulsion particles in water is thinly coated onto a metal<br>
plate such as aluminum and the temperature is rose so as to form a<br>
transparent continuous film.<br>

and the like. Examples of the salt include sodium, ammonium, and the<br>
like.<br>
As the emulsifier, a reactive emulsifier having an unsaturated<br>
double bond may be used in the present invention. Examples of the<br>
reactive emulsifier include commercially available Adekalia soap SE, NE,<br>
PP (manufactured by Adeka Corporation), LATEMUL S-180<br>
(manufactured by Kao Corporation), ELEMINOL JS-2, ELEMINOL RS-<br>
30 (manufactured by Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd.), and Aquaron RN-<br>
20 (manufactured by Darichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd.)<br>
Examples of the silane compound include tetramethoxysilane,<br>
methyltrimethoxysilane, dimethyldimethoxysilane,<br>

diphenyldiethoxysilane, hexyltrimethoxysilane, hexyltriethoxysilane,<br>
decyltrimethoxysilane, decyltriethoxysilane,<br>
trifluoropropyltrimethoxysilane, and the like.<br>
Monomers generally known as silane coupling agents may be<br>
used as the silane compound, examples of which monomers include<br>

acid salt, 3-ureidopropyltriethoxysilane, 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
3-meiraptopropyhnethyldimethoxysilane, 3-mercaptopropyltrxmethoxysilane,<br>

the like.<br>
The hydrolyzable silyl group refers to a silyl group containing a<br>
hydrolyzabile group in the present invention. Examples of the<br>
hydrolyzable group include alkoxy, mercapto, halogen, amide, acetoxy,<br>
amino, isopropenoxy groups, and the like.<br>
The silyl group is hydrolyzed and becomes a silanol group, which<br>
is dehydrated and condensed, and a siloxane bond generated. In the<br>
present invention, the hydrolyzable silyl group in the silicone modified<br>
acrylic resin is hydrolyzed via the polymerization reaction and<br>
disappears, so there is no hydrolyzable silyl group in the silicone<br>
modified acrylic resin. If the hydrolyzable silyl group remains, when it<br>
is used in making the recording ink, the storage properties may<br>
deteriorate.<br>
The resin fine-particles preferably have a volume average particle<br><br>
diameter of 10 nm to 300 nm, more preferably 40 nm to 200 nm. If the<br>
volume average particle diameter is less than 10 nm, the resin emulsion<br>
has a higher viscosity. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult to obtain an<br>
ink viscosity dischargeable in an inkjet printer. If the average particle<br>
diameter is more than 300 nm, a nozzle of the printer may be clogged<br>
with the particles, causing ejection malfunction.<br>
Further, for the quantity of silicone originating from the silicone<br>
modified acrylic resin in the recording ink, 100 ppm to 400 ppm is<br>
preferable, and 100 ppm to 300 ppm is more preferable. If the quantity<br>
of the silicone is less than 100 ppm, a coating with excellent abrasion<br>
properties and marker resistance may not be obtained, and if it is more<br>
than 400 ppm, the tendency of hydrophobicity becomes greater and thus<br>
the stability in the aqueous ink may deteriorate.<br>
For the minimum film forming temperature (MFT) of the silicone<br>
modified acrylic resin not containing the hydrolyzable silyl group, 20°C<br>
or less is preferable, and 0°C or less is more preferable. If the minimum<br>
film forming temperature is more than 20°C, sufficient fixation may not<br>
be obtained, and when the printed portion is rubbed or traced with a<br>
marker pen, the pigment is removed and the recording medium may be<br>
smeared.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable that a total amount of<br>
the water-dispersible resin and the pigment as the coloring agent is 5%<br>
by mass to 40% by mass in the ink, and a mass ratio A/B of the water-<br>
dispersible resin A to the pigment B is 0.5 to 4, preferably 1 to 2.5.<br>
Prints having high fixing ability and textures close to those of<br><br>
commercial printing can be attained on the low-priced recording medium<br>
for use in the present invention, by combining the ink and the recording<br>
medium described in the present specification.<br>
In the second embodiment of the ink of the present invention,<br>
solids mass of the dipeptide in the ink is preferably 1 part by mass to 20<br>
parts by mass, more preferably 3 parts by mass to 10 parts by mass.<br>
Moreover, the ink further needs to satisfy the abovementioned amount<br>
and ratio of the water-dispersible resin and the pigment as the coloring<br>
agent relative to the total solids content of the ink, in order to satisfy the<br>
objects of the present invention.<br>
Specifically, the solids content of the water-dispersible resin and<br>
the pigment as the coloring agent needs to be 5% by mass to 40% by<br>
mass relative to the total solids contents of the ink. If the solids content<br>
is less than 5% by mass, fixing ability and the like become insufficient<br>
against the recording medium for use in the present invention. If the<br>
solids content is more than 40% by mass, the viscosity of the ink is<br>
excessively increased, and thus reliability such as for ejection of the ink<br>
may be adversely affected. The solids content is more preferably 5% by<br>
mass to 20% by mass. Moreover, resin dispersion, and a resin-coated<br>
pigment can be used in the ink, depending on the selection of the coloring<br>
agent. In this case, the resin dispersion and resin component of the<br>
resin-coated particle are counted as a resin component of the ink,<br>
together with the water-dispersible resin.<br>
As mentioned above, the ratio A/B is 0.5 to 4. If the ratio is less<br>
than 0.5, fixing ability and the like become insufficient against the<br><br>
recording medium for use in the present invention. If the ratio is more<br>
than 4, a density of the coloring agent is excessively low against the resin,<br>
and thus it may lower the image quality, such as lowering the density,<br>
uniformity of the image, and the like. Therefore, the important<br>
structural requirements of the ink of the present invention are to add 1<br>
part by mass to 20 parts by mass, preferably 3 parts by mass to 10 parts<br>
by mass, of the dipeptide as the solid water retainer to the ink in solids<br>
content, to satisfy the range of 5% by mass to 40% by mass of the total<br>
amount of the water-dispersible resin and the pigment as the coloring<br>
agent relative to the total solids of the ink, and to have a mass ratio A/B<br>
of the water-dispersible resin A to the pigment as the coloring agent B.<br>
-Water-soluble organic solvent-<br>
Specific examples of the water-soluble organic solvent for use in<br>
the present invention are as follow- polyvalent alcohols such as ethylene<br>
glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene<br>
glycol, tripropylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol,<br>

butanetriol, 2methyl-2,4-pentanediol, petriol, 3-methoxy-3-methyll-<br>
butanediol, and the like; polyvalent alcohol alkyl ethers such as ethylene<br>
glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene<br>
glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene<br>
glycol monobutyl ether, tetraethylene glycol monomethyl ether,<br>
propylene glycol monoethyl ether, and the like; polyvalent alcohol aryl<br><br>
ethers such as ethylene glycol monophenyl ether, ethylene glycol<br>
monobenzyl ether, dipropylene glycol monobutyl ether, tripropylene<br>
glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol isobutyl ether, triethylene<br>
glycol isobutyl ether, diethylene glycol isopropyl ether, and the like,'<br>
nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds such as 2-pyrrolidone, N-<br>
methyl-2-pyrrolidone, Nhydroxyethyl-2pyrrolidone, 1,3-<br>
dimethylimidazohdinone, e-caprolactam, Y-butyrolactone, and the like;<br>
amides such as formamide, N-methylformamide, formamide, N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide, and the like; amines such as monoethanolamine,<br>
diethanolamine, triethanolamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine,<br>
triethylamine, and the like; sulfur-containing compounds such as<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolane, thiodiethanol, thiodiglycol, and the like;<br>
propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, and the like.<br>
Among them, from the standpoint of obtaining excellent efficacy<br>
in preventing ejection characteristic failure due to solubility and<br>
moisture evaporation, glycerin, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol,<br>
triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene<br>
glycol, 1,3-butanediol, 2methyll,3-butanediol, 3methyl-l,3-butanediol,<br>
2,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, tetraethylene glycol, 1,6-<br>
hexanediol, 2methyl-2,4-pentanediol, polyethylene glycol, 1,2,4-<br>
butanetriol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, thiodiglycol, 2-pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidone, Nhydroxyethyl-2-pyrrolidone, or l,3"dimethyl-2-<br>
imidazolidinone is suitable.<br>
The other components are not particularly limited and may be<br>
appropriately selected according to the purpose. For example,<br><br>
fungicides, rust prevention agents, pH adjusters, and the like may be<br>
used. By using 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one as the fungicide, there can be<br>
provided an ink having excellent performance of the fungicide, while<br>
maintaining reliability such as storage stability, ejection stability, and<br>
the like. Especially when the above-mentioned fungicide is used in<br>
combination with the solid water retainer mentioned in the present<br>
specification, the fungicide can exhibit sufficient effects at the addition<br>
amount which is conventionally considered as an insufficient amount for<br>
prevent generation of bacteria or fungi. By maintaining the addition<br>
amount of the fungicide at the minimum, phenomena such as<br>
aggregations of the particles or increased viscosity of the ink can be<br>
prevented. Therefore, such ink is capable of exhibiting the excellent<br>
performances as the ink for a long-period of time. The content of 1,2-<br>
benzisothiazolin-3-one, as a content of an active ingredient, is preferably<br>
0.01 parts by mass to 0.04 parts by mass with respect to the total amount<br>
of the ink. If the content is less than 0.01, the effects of the fungicide<br>
cannot be sufficiently exhibited. If the content is more than 0.04 parts<br>
by mass, problems may occur in long-term storage stability, such as<br>
causing aggregations of the pigment or increasing the viscosity of the ink<br>
at 50% to 100% compared to the initial viscosity thereof after storing the<br>
ink for a long period, e.g. for two years at a room temperature, or one to<br>
three months at 50-60°C, and the performances at initial printing cannot<br>
be maintained.<br>
The pH adjusters are not particularly limited and any substances<br>
may be used according to the purpose as long as they can be used to<br><br>
adjust the pH for 7 or higher without adverse effects on the ink to be<br>
prepared.<br>
Examples of the pH adjusters include amines such as<br>
diethanolamine and triethanolamine, alkali metal hydroxides such as<br>
lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide;<br>
ammonium hydroxide, quaternary ammonium hydroxide, quaternary<br>
phosphonium hydroxide, alkali metal carbonates such as lithium<br>
carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and the like.<br>
Examples of the rust prevention agents include acidic sulfite,<br>
sodium thiosulfate, anmone thioglycolate, diisopropylammoniumnitrite,<br>
pentaerythritol tetranitrate, dicyclohexylammoniumnitrite, and the like.<br>
Water-soluble ultraviolet absorbers, water-soluble infra-red<br>
absorber may be further added, depending on the purpose.<br>
[Inkjet recording]<br>
In the present invention, a total amount of the ink is precisely<br>
restricted for the purpose of maintaining a drying property of the ink,<br>
while preventing the pigment of the ink from penetrating into the<br>
recording medium so as to make the pigment efficiently locate the area<br>
adjacent to the surface of the recording medium. In the case of the<br>
conventional inkjet printing where a large amount of the ink is used, the<br>
functions of the barrier layer for separation the pigment coloring agent<br>
from the ink cannot be sufficiently performed and thus the pigment<br>
coloring agent is penetrated together with the solvent of the ink, or the<br>
solvent of the ink is not dried at a sufficient speed and thus the drying<br>
property is lowered. In order to sufficiently exhibit the functions of the<br><br>
barrier layer, the maximum total amount of the ink is 15 g/m2 or less,<br>
preferably 12 g/m2 or less. The amount of the ink can be easily<br>
controlled. By reducing the total amount of the ink required for<br>
printing, a size of an ink cartridge can be reduced compared to the size of<br>
the ink cartridge in the conventional inkjet printer. Therefore, it is<br>
possible to downsize an inkjet recording apparatus. In the case where<br>
an ink cartridge in size of the conventional cartridge is used, the<br>
frequency of exchanging the ink cartridge is reduced. Therefore,<br>
printing can be conducted at low cost in this case. As a general<br>
principle, the function of the barrier layer for separating the pigment<br>
from the ink is more efficiently exhibited as the total amount of the ink is<br>
smaller. However, if the total amount of the ink is excessively small,<br>
there is a drawback such that image dots become small after printing.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable to adjust the total amount of the ink within the<br>
above-mentioned range depending images to be obtained.<br>
In the present invention, the total amount of the ink is measured<br>
in accordance with a weighting method. Specifically, a 5 cm X 20 cm<br>
rectangular is printed on Type 6200 (manufactured by Ricoh Company<br>
Limited) which is a plain paper for copiers (PPC). The mass of the<br>
paper just after printing was measured, and a mass of the paper before<br>
printing was deducted from the thus obtained value. 100 times of the<br>
obtained value was defined as the total amount of the ink.<br>
The ink having high permeability of the present invention can be<br>
used for printing on the conventional porous recording media for inkjet<br>
printing. However, in this case, the absorption speed of the ink is<br><br>
excessively high compared to the case where printing is performed on the<br>
recording medium for use in the present invention. Therefore, after<br>
that a droplet of the ink is dropped on a surface of the paper, the solvent<br>
of the ink is penetrated into the ink before the droplet is spread on the<br>
surface, and thus a diameter of the dot becomes small. As a result,<br>
lowered density or increased granular textures tends to be caused. In<br>
order to obtain a high quality image on PPC, it is necessary to perform<br>
printing by lowering resolution compared to the case when printing is<br>
performed on the recording medium for used in the present invention.<br>
However, if the resolution is lowered, the printing speed is slowed, or a<br>
consumption of the ink is increased. Therefore, it is more preferably to<br>
use the recording medium for use in the present invention, together with<br>
the ink for inkjet printing of the present invention.<br>
The ink of the ink media set of the present invention is suitably<br>
used in printers provided with any types of inkjet heads including a<br>
piezo_type in which a piezoelectric element is used to pressurize ink in<br>
the ink passage, a diaphragm forming the wall of the ink passage is<br>
deformed to change the inner volume of the ink passage, thereby<br>
discharging ink droplets (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A)<br>
No. 02-51734), a thermal type in which an exothermic resistor is used to<br>
heat ink in the ink passage to produce bubbles (Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 61-59911), and an electrostatic type in<br>
which a diaphragm forming the wall of the ink passage and electrodes<br>
are placed at facing positions and electrostatic force is produced between<br>
the diaphragm and the electrodes to deform the diaphragm and change<br><br>
the inner volume of the ink passage, thereby discharging ink droplets<br>
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JPA) No. 199471882).<br>
As mentioned above, the recording medium of the ink media set<br>
of the present invention is used together with the ink of the ink media<br>
set of the present invention. This combination of the recording medium<br>
and the ink is suitably used in various fields, and is suitably used in an<br>

apparatus of the present invention described below.<br>
(Inkjet recording apparatus and inkjet recording method)<br>
The inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention contains<br>
the ink media set for inkjet recording of the present invention and an ink<br>
ejecting unit, and may further contain appropriately selected other units,<br>
such as a stimulus applying unit, a controlling unit, and the like.<br>
The inkjet recording method of the present invention uses the ink<br>
media set for inkjet recording of the present invention, and contains a<br>
step of ejecting the ink. The inkjet recording method of the present<br>
invention may further contain appropriately selected other steps, such as<br>
a step of applying stimulus, a step of controlling, and the like, if<br>
necessary.<br>
The inkjet recording method of the present invention is suitable<br><br>
performed by means of the inkjet recording apparatus of the present<br>
invention, and the step of ejecting the ink is suitably performed by<br>
means of the ink ejecting unit. Moreover, the above-mentioned other<br>
steps are suitably performed by means of the above-mentioned other<br>
units.<br>
As mentioned above, the inkjet recording method contains a step<br>
of ejecting the ink, which is to apply a stimulus to the ink for inkjet<br>
recording, so as to eject the ink.<br>
The step of ejecting the ink is to apply a stimulus to the ink of the<br>
ink media set of the present invention, and to eject the ink to the<br>
recording medium of the ink media set of the present invention, so as to<br>
form an image.<br>
The ink ejecting unit is configured to apply a stimulus to the ink<br>
of the ink media set of the present invention, and to eject the ink so as to<br>
form an image on the recording medium of the ink media set of the<br>
present invention. The ink ejecting unit is not particularly limited, and<br>
examples thereof include various nozzles for ejecting an ink, and the like.<br>
It is preferable that the liquid chamber, fluid dragging part,<br>
diaphragm, and nozzle member of the nozzle head part be at least partly<br>
made of materials containing at least either silicon or nickel.<br>
The nozzle diameter of the nozzle head part is preferably 30 µm<br>
or less, more preferably 1 µm to 20 µm.<br>
It is preferable that subtanks for supplying ink be provided on<br>
the inkjet head and the ink is supplied to the subtanks from the ink<br>
cartridge via supply tubes.<br><br>
In the inkjet recording method of the present invention, the<br>
maximum deposition amount of the ink is preferably 8 g/m2 to 20 g/m2 at<br>
the resolution of 300 dpi or more.<br>
The stimulus is generated, for example, by the stimulus applying<br>
unit. The stimulus is appropriately selected depending on the purpose<br>
without any restriction. Examples of the stimulus include heat,<br>
pressure, vibration, light, and the like. One of them may be used alone,<br>
or two or more of them may be used in combination. Among them, heat,<br>
and pressure are particularly suitable.<br>
Examples of the stimulus applying unit are a heating apparatus,<br>
a pressurizing apparatus, a piezoelectric element, a vibration generation<br>
apparatus, an ultrasonic oscillator, a light, and the like. Specific<br>
examples thereof include a piezoelectric actuator such as a piezoelectric<br>
element, a thermal actuator using an electrothermal conversion element<br>
such as an exothermic resistor to cause film boiling and, accordingly,<br>
phase change of a liquid, a shape-memory alloy actuator using metal<br>
phase changes due to temperature changes, an electrostatic actuator<br>
using electrostatic force, and the like.<br>
An embodiment of the ejection of the ink of the ink media set is<br>
appropriately selected depending on the stimulus to be applied, without<br>
any restriction. For example, in the case where the stimulus is "heat,"<br>
thermal energy corresponding to recording signals is applied to the ink in<br>
the recording head, for example, using a thermal head, the thermal<br>
energy causes the ink to bubble, and the bubble pressure urges the ink to<br>
be ejected as ink droplets from the nozzle hole of the recording head. In<br><br>
the case where the stimulus is "pressure," for example, an electric<br>
voltage is applied to a piezoelectric element bonded at a position called a<br>
pressure chamber within the ink passage of the recording head, the<br>
piezoelectric element is bent, the pressure chamber is reduced in volume,<br>
and thus the ink is ejected as droplets from the nozzle hole of the<br>
recording head.<br>
The droplet of the ink to be ejected preferably has a size of 1 pl to<br>
40 pl, an ejection speed of the ink is preferably 5m/sec. to 20m/sec, a<br>
driving frequency is preferably 1kHz or higher, and a resolution is<br>
preferably 300dpi or higher.<br>
The controlling unit is appropriately selected without any<br>
restriction, provided that it is capable of controlling the motions of each<br>
units described above. Examples of the controlling unit include devices<br>
such as a sequencer, a computer, and the like.<br>

mounting part 104. The ink cartridge mounting part 104 has front<br>
cover 115 that can be opened and/or closed to remove and/or place ink<br><br>
cartridges 200.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 4 and 5, a carriage 133 is supported slidably in<br>
the scan direction by guide rod 131 that is a guide member laid across<br>
not shown right and left side plates and stay 132 and moved by a main<br>
motor (not shown) in the arrowed directions in FIG. 5 for scanning<br>
within the apparatus body 101.<br>
Recording heads 134 consisting of four inkjet recording heads<br>
that eject yellow (Y), cyan (C), magenta (M), and black (B) recording ink<br>
droplets, respectively, have ink ejection ports arranged in the<br>
intersecting direction with the main scanning direction and they are<br>
placed in the carriage 133 with their ink ejection direction downward.<br>
Inkjet recording heads constituting the recording heads 134 are<br>
provided with an energy generation unit for ejection the ink such as a<br>
piezoelectric actuator such as an piezoelectric element, a thermal<br>
actuator using an electrothermal conversion element such as an<br>
exothermic resistor to cause film boiling and, accordingly, phase change<br>
of a liquid, a shape-memory alloy actuator using metal phase changes<br>
due to temperature changes, and an electrostatic actuator using<br>
electrostatic force.<br>
The carriage 133 is provided with subtanks 135 for supplying<br>
each color ink to the recording heads 134. The subtanks 135 are filled<br>
with the recording ink of the present invention from the ink cartridge<br>
201 of the present invention mounted in the ink cartridge mounting part<br>
105 via a not-shown recording ink supply tube.<br>
A paper feed part for feeding paper 142 stuck on paper load part<br><br>
(platen) 141 of the feed tray 102 comprises a half-moon roller ( feed roller<br>
143) that separates and supplies the paper 142 from the paper load part<br>
141 one by one and separation pad 144 that faces the feed roller 143 and<br>
is made of a large friction coefficient material. . The separation pad 144<br>
is biased toward the feed roller 143.<br>
A conveying part for conveying the paper 142 supplied from the<br>
feed part underneath the recording heads 134 comprises a conveying belt<br>
151 for electrostatically adsorbing and conveying the paper 142, counter<br>
roller 152 for conveying the paper 142 sent from the paper feed part via<br>
guide 145 by clamping it together with the conveying belts 151,<br>
conveying guide 153 for turning the paper 142 sent nearly vertically by<br>
90° so as to lay it on the conveying belt 151, and leading end pressure<br>
roller 155 that is biased toward the conveying belt 151 by presser<br>
member 154. Charging roller 156 that is a charging unit for charging<br>
the surface of the conveying belt 151 is also provided.<br>
The conveying belt 151 is an endless belt, being placed over<br>
conveying roller 157 and a tension roller 158 and running around in the<br>
belt conveying direction. For example, the conveying belt 151 has a<br>
front layer that is a paper adsorbing surface made of a dragging-<br>
uncontrolled resin, for example a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and<br>
ethylene (ETFE), having a thickness of 40µm and a back layer (an<br>
intermediate dragging layer or an earth layer) made of the same<br>
material as the front layer, but draggingcontrolled with carbon. Guide<br>
member 161 is provided behind the conveying belt 151 at the<br>
corresponding position to the printing area by the recording heads 134.<br><br>
An output part for discharging the paper 142 on which recording was<br>
done by the recording heads 134 comprises separation click 171 for<br>
separating the paper 142 from the conveying belt 151, paper output<br>
roller 172, and paper output roller 173. Paper output tray 103 is<br>
disposed below paper output roller 172.<br>
Double-side feeding unit 181 is detachably mounted in the back of<br>
the apparatus body 101. The double-side feed unit 181 takes in the<br>
paper 142 that is moved backward as the conveying belt 151 is rotated in<br>
the reverse direction, turns it over, and feeds it again between the<br>
counter roller 152 and the conveying belt 151. Manual feeder 182 is<br>
provided on the top surface of the double-side feed unit 181.<br>
In this inkjet recording apparatus, the paper 142 is separated<br>
and fed from the paper feed part one by one. Being fed vertically, the<br>
paper 142 is guided by the guide 145 and conveyed between the<br>
conveying belt 151 and the counter roller 152. Then, it is guided by the<br>
conveying guide 153 at the leading end and is pressed against the<br>
conveying belt 151 by the leading end pressure roller 155 to change the<br>
convey direction substantially by 90°.<br>
Meanwhile, the conveying belt 151 is charged by the charging<br>
roller 156, and the paper 142 is electrostatically adsorbed and conveyed<br>
by the conveying belt 151. Then, the recording heads 134 are driven<br>
according to image signals while the carriage 133 is moved. Ink<br>
droplets are ejected on the paused paper 142 for recording one-line.<br>
Then, the paper 142 is conveyed by a certain rate for recording the next<br>
line. Receiving a recording end signal or a signal indicating the rear<br><br>
end of the paper 142 has reached the recording area, the recording<br>
operation is terminated and the paper 142 is ejected to the paper output<br>
tray 103.<br>
When it is detected that the remaining amount of the recording<br>
ink in the subtank 135 is nearly to the end, a certain amount of recording<br>
ink is supplied to the subtank 135 from the ink cartridge 200.<br>
In this inkjet recording apparatus, when the recording ink in the<br>
ink cartridge 200 of the present invention is used up, the case of the ink<br>
cartridge 200 is disassembled and only the ink pouch contained therein<br>
can be exchanged. The ink cartridge 200 allows for stable recording ink<br>
supply even in a vertical and front mounting structure. Therefore,<br>
when the apparatus body 101 is installed with the top being blocked by<br>
something, for example, the ink cartridge 200 can be housed in a rack.<br>
Even if something is placed on the top surface of the apparatus body 101,<br>
the ink cartridge 200 can be easily replaced.<br>
Here, the explanation is made with reference to an application in<br>
a serial type (shuttle type) inkjet recording apparatus in which the<br>
carriage scans is described. A line type inkjet recording apparatus<br>
having a line head is also applicable.<br>
The inkjet recording apparatus and inkjet recording method of<br>
the present invention are applicable to various recording in an inkjet<br>
recording system. For example, the inkjet recording apparatus and<br>
inkjet recording method of the present invention can be particularly<br>
preferably applied to inkjet recording printers, facsimiles, copy machines,<br>
and printer/fax/copy complex machines.<br><br>
An inkjet head to which the present invention is applied is<br>
described hereinafter.<br>
FIG. 6 is an enlarged view of the core part of the inkjet head<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG.7 is an<br>
enlarged cross-sectional view of the core part of the same head in the<br>
inter-channel direction.<br>
This inkjet head comprises frame 10 having cutouts serving as an<br>
ink supply port (not shown) and a common liquid chamber lb, passage<br>
plate 20 having cutouts serving as fluid dragging part 2a and pressurized<br>
liquid chamber 2b and communication port 2c that communicates to<br>
nozzle 3a, diaphragm 60 having raised part 6a, diaphragm part 6b, and<br>
ink inflow port 6c, laminated piezoelectric element 50 connected to the<br>
diaphragm 60 via adhesive layer 70, and base 40 on which the laminated<br>
piezoelectric element 50 is fixed. The base 40 is made of barium<br>
titanate ceramics, on which two rows of laminated piezoelectric element<br>
50 are arranged and connected.<br>
The piezoelectric element 50 consists of alternately laminated<br>
piezoelectric layers of lead zircohate titanate (PZT) having a thickness of<br>
10 µm to 50 urn per layer and internal electrode layers of silver<br>
palladium (AgPd) having a thickness of several µm per layer. The<br>
internal electrode layers 52 are connected to external electrodes 53 at<br>
both ends.<br>
The laminated piezoelectric element 50 is divided into a comb-like<br>
shape by half-cut dicing, having driving parts 56 and supporting parts<br>
(non-driving part) 57 every other division (see FIG. 7).<br><br>
The exterior of one of the two external electrodes 53 (connecting a<br>
one end of the internal electrode layer in the surface or back side<br>
direction in the figure) is processed, for example notched, for limiting on<br>
length, thereby being divided by half-cut dicing. Multiple separate<br>
electrodes 54 are formed. Not divided by dicing, the other is conductive<br>
and serves as a common electrode 55.<br>
A FPC (80) is soldered to the individual electrodes 54 of the<br>
driving part. The common electrode 55 is turned in an electrode layer<br>
provided at the end of the laminated piezoelectric layer and connected to<br>
the Gnd electrode of the FPC (80). An un-shown driver IC is mounted<br>
on the FPC (80) to control the application of driving voltage to the<br>
driving part 56.<br>
As for the diaphragm 60, thin film diaphragm part 62, island-<br>
shaped raised part (island part) 61 formed at the center of the diaphragm<br>
part 62 and connected to the laminated piezoelectric element 50 serving<br>
as the driving parts 56, a thick part including beams to be connected to<br>
the supporting part, and an opening serving as in ink inflow port 63 are<br>
formed by electroforming two nickel plated films. The diaphragm has a<br>
thickness of 3 µm arid a width (one side) of 35 µm.<br>
The connections between the island part 61 of the diaphragm 60<br>
and the movable parts 56 of the laminated piezoelectric element 50 and<br>
between the diaphragm 60 and the frame 10 are made by patterning the<br>
adhesive layer 70 including a gap material.<br>
The passage plate 20 is made of a silicon mono-crystalline<br>
substrate, in which cutouts serving as liquid dragging part 21 and<br><br>
pressurized liquid chamber 22 and a through hole provided at the<br>
corresponding position to the nozzle 31 and serving as communication<br>
port 23 are patterned by etching.<br>
The remaining part after the etching serves as a partition wall 24<br>
of the pressurized liquid chamber 22. In this head, a part etched in a<br>
smaller width serves as the liquid dragging part 21.<br>
The nozzle plate 30 is made of a metal material such as a nickel<br>
plated film formed by electroforming and has a number of nozzles 31<br>
serving as fine ejection openings for discharging ink droplets. The<br>
nozzle 31 has a horn-like (substantially cylindrical or substantially<br>
truncated cone) internal shape (inner shape). The nozzle 31 has a<br>
diameter of approximately 20 µm to 35 µm at the ink droplets ejection<br>
side. The nozzle pitch in each row is 150dpi.<br>
The ink discharging surface (nozzle front side) of the nozzle plate<br>
30 is provided with a water-repellent finish layer having a not shown<br>
water-repellent finish surface. A water-repellent finish film selected<br>
according to ink's physical properties such as PTFE-Ni eutectoid plating<br>
and electrodeposition of fluororesin, deposition of volatile fluororesin,<br>
silicone resin and fluororesin solvent application and baking can be<br>
provided to stabilize ink droplet shapes and ejection property and, thus,<br>
ensure a high image quality. Among them, for example many<br>
fluororesins are known; excellent waterrepellency can be obtained by<br>
depositing modified perfluoropolyoxethane (by Daikin Industies, Ltd,<br>
trade name: Optool DSX) to a thickness of 30 A to 100A.<br>
The frame 10 in which cutouts serving as an ink supply inlet and<br><br>
a common liquid chamber 12 are formed is made by molding a resin.<br>
In an inkjet head having the above structure, a driving waveform<br>
(10V to 50V pulse voltage) is applied to the driving part 56 according to<br>
recording signals. The driving part 56 is shifted in the lamination<br>
direction. The pressurized liquid chamber 22 is pressurized via the<br>
diaphragm 30 and the pressure is increased, thereby ink droplets are<br>
ejected from the nozzle 31.<br>
After ejection of the ink droplets is completed, the ink pressure in<br>
the pressurized liquid chamber 22 is decreased. The inertia ink flow<br>
and driving pulse ejection process causes negative pressure within the<br>
pressurized liquid chamber 22, leading to the ink supply step.<br>
Meanwhile, the ink supplied from the ink tank enters the common liquid<br>
chamber 12 and further fills the pressurized liquid chamber 22 from the<br>
common liquid chamber 12 via the ink inflow port 63 and fluid dragging<br>
part 21.<br>
The fluid dragging part 21 effectively attenuates residual<br>
pressure fluctuation while it stands against recharging (refilling) due to<br>
surface tension. Appropriately selected dragging part balances residual<br>
pressure attenuation with refilling time and shortens the transition time<br>
to the next ink droplets ejection operation (driving cycle).<br>
