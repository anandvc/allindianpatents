				<td>CARD HOLDER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to card holders used for pinching or holding cards such as memo papers, price lists, or the like on shelves in stores, on walls of houses, inside vehicles, or in other facilities. 'Card holder' means, in this specification, a clip for holding cards, memo papers, prices lists and the like. Background Art<br>
Conventionally, various types of such card holders have been developed, for example those as shown in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15. A card holder illustrated in Fig. 14 has a roller individually inserted in an outer covering member. A card holder illustrated in Fig. 15 includes a flat disc-shaped member, and the disc-shaped member has a side portion of its periphery opened, into which a card is inserted to be held. However, these conventional card holders are time consuming and expensive to manufacture, fail to smoothly attach and detach cards to be pinched, or limit a thickness of the card to be held. Additionally, most of the conventional card holders like that shown in Fig. 15 can only be used in limited places including the interior of a vehicle and hence lacks in general versatility.<br>
The present invention has been accomplished in view of the aforesaid technical background, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a card holder that permits smooth attachment and detachment of any card without limiting a thickness of the card to be pinched, whose manufacturing costs are low, and which has ruggedness and enhanced versatility. Disclosure of the Invention<br>
According   to  the   present   invention,    there   is   provided   a   card holder<br>
1<br><br><br>
comprising a basic piece having a thick portion, an outer covering piece engaged with one end of the basic piece so as to provide a card insertion opening on one side portion of the basic piece, and a card pinching piece having elasticity and disposed in a space formed by the basic piece and the outer covering piece, the card pinching piece being attached to the outer covering piece such that one end of the card pinching piece abuts against the basic piece.    The outer covering piece has hook-shaped basic-piece engaging portions protruding therefrom and which engage with inner and outer ends of the thick portion of the basic piece. Furthermore, the basic piece further comprises a base for engagement with a card, and the thick portion is formed by folding from one end of the base, so that the basic piece is formed to have a L-shaped cross-section.    Also, the outer covering piece comprises a basic-piece attachment portion for engaging with the thick portion of the basic piece, an outer covering surface formed by folding from the basic-piece attachment portion, and an outer covering end having a half-round cross-section, so that the outer covering piece is formed to have a J-shaped cross-section, and the card pinching piece is attached to a back surface of the outer covering surface.    Accordingly, the card pinching piece is attached inside the space, thus providing the card holder having a simple structure and ruggedness.    The basic piece and the outer covering piece are assembled together after attaching the card pinching piece, thereby to facilitate manufacturing the card holder.<br>
The card holder has a part of the base of the basic piece made of softer material than the others.  This hopefully provides stronger pinching ability.<br>
In this card holder, the card pinching piece is made of elastic material such as rubber, and comprises an attachment portion for attachment to the outer covering piece and formed to have a linear cross-section, a leg protruding from the attachment portion, and a pinching portion extending from one end of the leg,<br>
2<br><br>
one end of the pinching portion serving as a basic-piece abutting portion for abutting against the basic piece and sloped in a direction of the card insertion opening.   The pinching portion extends from the end of the leg in a trapezoid shape.    Furthermore, the basic-piece abutting portion has its tip end formed in a stepped shape, and the tip end has arc-shaped pits and projections formed in a mutually staggered configuration.    These features permit the card holder to have sufficient ruggedness to be applicable to a variety of thicknesses, and also allow smooth insertion, reliable pinching, and smooth drawing of the card.<br>
The card pinching piece is composed of a plate spring, one end portion of which is the attachment portion for attachment to the outer covering piece, and a card pinching portion is formed by folding the plate spring with a slope from one end of the attachment portion, so that the card pinching piece is formed in a mountain-like shape.    This makes the structure of the card holder simple, and allows the smooth pinching and drawing of the card.<br>
One end of the card pinching portion is further folded to form a pinching protrusion.    In more detail, the attachment portion has claw-like projections disposed on and extending from respective left and right sided ends of the plate spring in a width direction, and the one end of the card pinching portion is further folded to form the pinching protrusion.    The attachment portion has its end or boundary folded back.    This permits the smooth attachment and detachment of the card.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter some preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.    Figs. 1 to 7 show sectional views of a first preferred embodiment.    A card holder of the present invention, indicated at 1, includes a basic piece 2 made of hard synthetic resin or metal such as aluminum, an outer covering piece 3 integrally fitted into the basic piece 2 and made of hard synthetic resin or metal such as aluminum, and a pinching piece 4 disposed inside a space between the basic piece 2 and the outer covering piece 3 and made of elastic material.    The card holder is formed as a long member that is to be cut to an appropriate length.<br>
The basic piece 2, which is made of the hard synthetic resin, is formed to have a L-shaped cross-section.    The basic piece 2 includes a base 2a having a linear cross-section.    A thick portion 2b is formed by folding from one end or border of the base 2a at the right angle.    One end portion of the basic piece is further folded, and then the tip end thereof is folded again in a hook-shape, to form an outer-covering-piece engaging portion 2c, which is the hook-shaped tip end.    In the vicinity of the thick portion 2b is formed a recess 2d having a trapezoid-shaped cross-section.    Another outer-covering-piece engaging portion 2e is provided facing inward with respect to the recess.    A part from a tip end of the base 2a to a middle point thereof has its surface portion made of slightly softer synthetic resin 2f than the others, and this part is a little thicker than the others.<br>
The outer covering piece 3, which is made of the hard synthetic resin, is formed to have a J-shaped cross-section.    The outer covering piece 3 includes a basic-piece attachment portion 3a disposed so as to face the thick portion 2b of the basic piece 2.    An outer covering surface 3b is formed by folding from the basic-piece attachment portion 3a at the right angle to have a linear cross-section.<br>
5<br><br>
On a tip of the outer covering surface 3b portion is formed an outer covering tip end 3c having a half-round cross-section.    On both inner and outer ends of the basic-piece attachment portion 3a are outwardly protruded hook-shaped basic-piece engaging portions 3d and 3d each of which has a L-shaped cross-section.    On the back of the outer covering surface 3b, a small protrusion 3e for aligning the card pinching piece and having a linear cross-section is provided in the vicinity of the basic-piece attachment portion 3a.    In contrast, near the tip of the outer covering surface 3b portion is provided another small protrusion 3f for aligning the card pinching piece and having a L-shaped cross-section.    The outer covering end 3c has its head folded inward.<br>
The card pinching piece 4 is made of elastic material such as chloroprene rubber, silicone rubber, or the like to be formed so as to have a prescribed length. This card pinching piece 4 is disposed and attached in a space formed by the basic piece 2 and the outer covering piece 3 with a predetermined space therefrom.    An attachment portion 4a having a linear cross-section is provided with a small protrusion 4b formed at the middle point thereof.    From a side opposite to the small protrusion 4b, is protruded a leg 4c which slopes slightly inward.    And from the end of the leg 4c, a pinching portion 4d is extended.    This pinching portion 4d is formed around a base of the leg 4c to have a substantially trapezoid-shaped cross-section.    Further, the pinching portion 4d has its end sloped in a direction of the card insertion, and on a tip end or head of the pinching portion, cutouts are formed to provide double-stepped abutting portions 4e and 4f.    Preferably the tip end with these abutting portions 4e and 4f formed thereon, as shown in Fig. 6, has respective arc-shaped pits and projections 4g formed in a mutually staggered configuration.<br>
Now the card holder 1 of the present invention having the above-mentioned parts will be manufactured as follows.    First, the attachment<br>
