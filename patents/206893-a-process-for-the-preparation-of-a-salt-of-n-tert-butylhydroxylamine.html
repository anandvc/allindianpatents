COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A SALT OF<br>
      N-TERT -BUTHYDROXYLAMINE"<br>
ASTRAZENECA   AB,   a   Swedish   company,   of   S-151   85   Sodertalje, SWEDEN,<br>
	The following specification particularly describes the nature of the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
i	This invention relates to novel salts of -N-tert-butylhydroxylammc and processes fo.<br>
their preparation. The salts are useful as intermediates in organic synthesis.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
10     N-Alky! hydroxylamines, including N-tert-burylhydroxylamine, are important is<br>
intermediates in organic synthesis, particularly in the preparation of nitrones, hydroxamic acids and C-nitroso compounds (J.S Roberts in D.H.R. Barton and W.D. Ollis, Comprehensive Organic Chemistry, Volume 2, pages 196 - 201, Pergamon Press, 1979).<br>
is      Mediods for the synthesis of N-alkyl hydro xylamines are well known in the art (J.S.<br>
Roberts in D.H.R. Barton and W.D. Ollis, Comprehensive Organic Chemistry, Volume 2, pages 185 - 194, Pergamon Press, 1979). The most common method for die synmes:i oi such compounds involves the reduction of a corresponding nitrogen-containing compound which is at a higher oxidation level than the hydroxylamine itself. Thus, reductions of<br>
:o      nitro, nitroso and oxime derivatives have all been used.<br>
W.D. Emmons (J Arr.er. Chem. Soc, 1957, 79, 5739 - 5754) describes the preparation of various oxaziridines by oxidation of the corresponding imine derivative with peracetic acid. Further hydrolysis of these oxaziridines with aqueous acid provides a useful 25      alternative route for the preparanon of /V-alkyl hydroxylamines.<br>
In a related process, N-alkyl hydroxylamines such as N-tert-butylbydroxylarnine may be prepared by oxidation of an imino ether with peracid and subsequent hydrolysis of the resultant alkoxyoxaziridine (D. Thomas and D.H. Aue, Tetrahedron Letters, 1973, 30     1807-1810).<br><br><br>
Hydroxylarnines are basic compounds and form salts with mineral acids, for example, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide. Salts with strong organic acids, for example, oxalic acid and trifluoromethanesulphonic acid, are also known.<br>
5      As the free bases N-alkyl hydroxybmines are not, in general, particularly stable, being prone, for example, to undergo aerial oxidation. For this reason, it is expedient to be able to prepare the generally more stable acid addition salts of such compounds. Such salts are particularly convenient as a means of storage of N-alkyl hydroxylamines.<br>
10      Bayer (DE 35 35 451; EP 0 217 269) d-scribe a process for the preparation of N-alkyl-substituted hydroxylammonium chlorides by the reaction of certain arylaldimines with perpropionic acid and subsequent hydrolysis of the c caziridine formed thereby. Such hydrochloride salts are regarded as being particularly advantageous. Taus, it is stated that salts other than the hydrochlorides, for example, the corresponding sulphates or hydrogen<br>
i s      sulphates, often crystallise only poorly or not at all, a factor which considerably complicates their preparation, isolation and handling.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found thatN-tert-butylhydroxylamine forms stable salts with lower carboxylic acids, for example, with acetic acid. Such salts display advantageous :o      properties and are the subject of the present application.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
According to the invention we provide a salt of formula (I)<br>
25<br>
(CH3)3CNHOH . RC02H<br>
wherein:<br>
R represents hydrogen or C 1 to 4 alkyl.<br><br><br>
5<br><br>
In particular, it is preferred that R represents methyl such that the compound of formula (I) is N-tert-burylhydroxyiammonium acetate.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, the term "C I to 4 alky I" referred to herein denotes a straight or branched chain alky! group having from I to 4 carbon atoms. Examnies of such ground include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl. i-butyl and t-butyl.<br><br>
According to the invention, we further provide a process for the preparation of salts of formula (I) which comprises reaction of N'-tert-buryihydroxylamine, (CH3): CNHOH. with IO     a lower ca-boxylic acid, RC02H, wherein R is as defined above.<br>
In one aspect of this pro ess, a solution of N-tert-burymydroxylairiine, either formed by liberation of the free base from a salt such as the hydrochloride, or generated directly by synthesis, in a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, is      diisopropyl ether, or methyl t-buryl ether is treated at a suitable temperature with an appropriate amount of 3 lower carboxylic acid such as acetic acid.<br>
In a preferred aspect, ethyl acetate and sodium acetate, are added to a solution N-tert-butylhydroxylammonium chloride in water.<br>
20<br>
In another preferred aspect, ethyl acetate, acetic acid and sodium hydroxide, "are added to a solution of .N-tert-burylhydroxylamiiie hydrochloride in water.<br>
In either way, N-tert-butylhydroxylammonium acetate is generated in situ, and may be 25      isolated by separation of the organic (ethyl acetate) layer, followed by evaporation.<br>
It is particularly surprising and advantageous that the novel salt,<br>
N-tert-butylhydroxylammonium acetate, can be partitioned from an aqueous phase into an organic phase.<br><br>
The novel salts of formula (I) may, if necessary, be purified using techniques that are well known tn the art. Thus, they may be recrystallised from a suitable solvent such as toluene or ethyl acetate, or from a suitable solvent mixture.<br>
5      However, most surprisingly and advantageously, the novel sa!r,<br>
N-tert-butylhydroxylammonium acetate, may also be punfied by distillation under reduced pressure.<br>
N-t'ert-butylhydroxy! imine, (CH})3CNHOF{, is well known in the literature and may be 10     preoarcd by methods that are known per se.<br>
Thus, N-terr-buty'hydroxyl unine may be produced by reduction of 2-methyl-2-<br>
nitropropane, (CH3)3CNO2, with, for example, zinc or aluminium amalgam (J. March,<br>
Advanced Organic Chemistry, 1985 (3rt edition), pages 1103-1104; Organic Syntheses, is     vol. 52, 77-82). For process scale work, such methods suffer from the disadvantages mat the 2-methyl-2-oitropropane required as a starting material is itself relatively expensive to prepare, and the reduction process requires careful concrc'. not least because   fus potentially very exothermic nature.<br>
zo     N-tert-tiutylhydroxylarainc may also conveniently be prepared  esing the general<br>
methodology described by Emmons {vide infra) as summarised in Scheme 1. R' merein<br>
may conveniently represent hydrogen, but may also represent one or more other suitable substituents. According to the Scheme, iV-ferr-butylamme (2) is reacted with a benzaldehyde (3) to give the imine (4) which in turn is oxidised with a peracid to afford the<br>
25      oxazindine (5). The oxaziridine (5) may then either be hydrolysed directly using aqueous acid or alternatively may be first rearranged to the nitrone (6) which is then itself hydrolysed. [n either case the hydrolysis yields a mixture of N-tert-butylhydroxylamine (7), as a salt, and the benzaldehyde (3) which may be readily separated Advantages of this process are that both of the starting materials (2) and (3) are relatively inexpensive.<br>
30     Furthermod the benzaldehyde (3) is regenerated in the course of the final hydrolysis and<br><br>
may conveniently be separated and recycled. In addition, if a peracid such as meta-chloroperbenzoic acid is used for oxidation of the imine, the meta-chlorobenzoic acid generated therefrom may also be recovered and subsequently re-oxidised.<br>
Scheme 1<br><br><br><br><br>
(5)<br><br>
(3)<br><br>
(■7)<br><br>
10      The novel salts of formula (I) are, m general, crystalline compounds which, unlike the corresponding free base, N-tert butylhydroxylamirie, exhibit good stability upon storage, particularly towards aerial oxidation.<br>
[f required, /V-rerf-butylhydroxylarrune may be liberated from the salts of formula (I) 15      simply by treatment with base.<br>
When compared to N-tert-butylhydroxylarnmoniurn chloride, the novel salts of formula (0 have the particular advantage that they possess a surprisingly greater stability towards heat. Thus, investigation of N-tert-butylhydroxylammonium chloride using differential scanning calonmetry showed that tiiis salt undergoes an extremely exothermic process (AH ~ - 1312 J/g) at an onset temperature of + 136 °C. In contrast, A'-/err-butylhydroxylammoruum<br><br>
acetate undergoes no significantly exothermic processes when treated under the same conditions.<br>
In addition, A^-ferf-butylhydroxylarnmonium chloride is rather hygroscopic, readily taking 5      up water from the surroundings. This disadvantage is much less apparent with N-tert-butyfhydroxyfammoruum acetate.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
      NMR. spectra were recorded on a Bruker in;.trumem at 200 MHz for 'H and 50 MHz for ,JC. Chemical shift data are given in ppm downfield from tetramethyfsilane (TMS).<br>

Both phases were siphoned to a separating<br>
20      funnel. The water phase was separated off and extracted once more with ethyl acetate (100 ml). The organic phases were pooled and acetic acid (28.1 g, 0.47 mol, i .09 equiv) was added. The solvent was evaporated off. The resulting clear, yellow-green oil was treated with additional ethyl acetate (203 g) and concentrated again. The bottle was piaced in the refrigerator and after 2 h the product had turned crystallme. The substance was easily<br>
