				<td>AN EXTRUDED DELIVERY SYSTEM, COMPRISING A HYDROPHOBIC FLAVOUR<br>
OR FRAGRANCE INGREDIENT OR COMPOSITION IN A CARRIER, PROCESS<br>
FOR ITS PREPARATION AND FLAVOURED OR PERFUMED PRODUCT<br>
INCORPORATING THE SAME<br>
Technical field and prior art<br>
The present Invention relates to the perfume and flavour industries. It concerns<br>
more particularly an encapsulation system capable of releasing a hydrophobic perfume or<br>
flavour ingredient or composition which is usually crystalline at ambient pressure and<br>
temperature, in a non-crystalline form, thus providing an advantageous delivery system.<br>
Encapsulation is widely used to provide delivery systems for flavour or fragrance<br>
substances known to be volatile and labile. The flavour industry for instance is well fitted<br>
with a rich literature, in particular patents, related to encapsulation processes for the<br>
preparation of encapsulated flavouring ingredients or compositions. This industry<br>
constantly seeks improvemeats for such processes and for the products there-obtained, in<br>
terms of increase of the flavour retention, or of better control of the release of active<br>
ingredients from the finished products.<br>
Many methods for the preparation of delivery systems are disclosed in the<br>
literature. Extrusion is in particular widely described. During the preparation of an<br>
extruded encapsulation system, the ingredient or composition to be protected is typically<br>
admixed with a carrier material and the blend thus formed is then heated in order to form<br>
a molten mass which is extruded and further cooled and solidified. The physical states of<br>
both the carrier material and the active ingredient to be protected are obviously affected<br>
by the process and more particularly by the changes in temperatures occurring during the<br>
respective heating and cooling steps.<br>
In the flavour industry, the physical state of delivery systems is a fundamental<br>
parameter often referred to. A solid state characterised by extremely low molecular<br>
mobility is most of the time required to stabilise flavour molecules in an encapsulated<br>
dosage form. The solid carrier material used in the delivery systems is usually in an<br>
amorphous glassy state, i.e. in a non crystalline form at ambient temperature. In fact, the<br>
oligomeric or polymeric molecules on which a carrier material is normally based, are<br>
unable to crystallise for kinetic reasons at the end of an encapsulation process. The<br>
concept of glass transition temperature (Tg) is well described in the prior art. It represents<br>
the transition temperature from a rubbery liquid state to a glassy solid state : such a<br><br>
transition is characterised by a rapid increase in viscosity over several orders of<br>
magnitude and over a rather small temperature range. It is recognised by many experts in<br>
the field that, in the glassy state, i.e. at temperatures below Tg, all molecular diffusion is<br>
highly restricted and it is this process which provides such effective entrapping of the<br>
volatile flavours or perfumes, as well preventing other chemical events such as oxidation<br>
from occurring. Implicit in much of the literature is the converse, namely that at<br>
temperatures above Tg, the encapsulation of flavour or perfume molecules will be<br>
ineffective, hence the importance of creating polymeric encapsulating materials with Tg<br>
values above ambient temperature.<br>
In the prior art related to perfume or flavour encapsulation, the physical state<br>
always referred to, is that of the encapsulating carrier material, which is related to the<br>
physical state desired for a suitable handling of the final product. There is no document in<br>
the prior art where reference is made to the physical state of the encapsulated material<br>
within the delivery system. The literature in this field describes above all the<br>
encapsulation of liquid substances which are by nature, amorphous. On the other hand,<br>
there is very few literature regarding the encapsulation of solid crystalline ingredients.<br>
WO 00/25606 discloses an extruded delivery system, suitable for the delivery of<br>
hydrophilic flavouring or perfuming ingredients, among which solid compounds are<br>
considered. In the systems there-disclosed, both the carrier material and the active<br>
ingredient to be encapsulated are hydrophilic. On the other hand, the literature is silent<br>
about the encapsulation of hydrophobic crystalline ingredients. However, the<br>
"incompatibility" between conventional hydrophilic carrier materials and hydrophobic<br>
crystalline ingredients would tend to prove that a solid hydrophobic ingredient would still<br>
be in a crystalline state when incorporated in such a carrier.<br>
Now, in a totally unexpected manner, we have been able to prepare a novel<br>
delivery system wherein a hydrophobic active ingredient which is normally crystalline at<br>
ambient temperature and pressure, is, when encapsulated within the delivery system of<br>
the invention, in a non crystalline form and is thus in the latter form in the initial stage of<br>
application in an end-product. The system of the invention is therefore susceptible of<br>
releasing a normally crystalline, hydrophobic substance, in a non-crystalline form.<br>
Surprisingly, the encapsulates according to the invention were found to provide several<br>
advantages, as described below, depending in particular on the carrier material used.<br><br>
It is known in the pharmaceutical industry that certain drugs or active substances<br>
can be advantageously used in a non crystalline form, in particular in an amorphous state.<br>
For instance, US 5,310,960 and US 5,310 961 describe a process for the preparation and<br>
further use of ibuprofen in an amorphous form with the effect of improving the taste of<br>
said drug. Another example is given in US 4,769,236 wherein medicaments are<br>
advantageously prepared in an amorphous form in such a way as to inhibit the formation<br>
of crystals.<br>
However, each of these documents discloses a specific effect associated with a<br>
specific active when used in an amorphous form. Their teaching, strictly limited to the<br>
pharmaceutical field, cannot be generalised to other substances than those cited.<br>
Moreover, delivery systems are not even alluded to.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
Now, the present invention advantageously provides a novel system wherein a<br>
hydrophobic flavour or fragrance ingredient, which is crystalline at standard pressure and<br>
temperature, is in a non-crystalline form when encapsulated in such a system. A first<br>
object of the invention therefore concerns a delivery system comprising a hydrophobic<br>
flavour or fragrance ingredient or composition encapsulated in an oligomeric or<br>
polymeric carrier, said delivery system being characterised in that the flavour or fragrance<br>
ingredient or composition, when non encapsulated, is in a crystalline form at a pressure<br>
comprised between 0.5xl05 and 2x10s Pa and a temperature comprised between 15 and<br>
30°C, and in that, said flavour or fragrance ingredient or composition, when encapsulated<br>
in the delivery system, is in a non-crystalline form at said pressure and temperature.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides a delivery system capable of releasing a<br>
hydrophobic, usually crystalline substance, in another physical form.<br>
The system of the invention, in a totally unexpected manner, proved to show<br>
advantageous properties during the release of the hydrophobic flavour or fragrance<br>
ingredient or composition there-encapsulated and stabilised in a non crystalline form, and<br>
allows in particular to obtain specific effects different from those observed with a<br>
conventional encapsulation system.<br>
A "hydrophobic ingredient or composition" designates, within the framework of<br>
the invention, an ingredient or a composition characterised by a Hildebrand solubility<br>
parameter 5 below 25 [MPa]1/2.<br><br>
Therefore the terms "hydrophobic flavour or fragrance ingredient or composition"<br>
as used herein are deemed to define a variety of flavour and fragrance materials of both<br>
natural and synthetic origins, meeting the solubility parameter criteria above-mentioned.<br>
They include single compounds and mixtures. These ingredients are moreover<br>
characterised by the fact that they have a crystalline form in standard conditions of<br>
temperature and pressure. A non limiting list of these ingredients include heliotropine,<br>
bromelia, (5RS,6RS)-2,6,10,10-tetramethyl-l-oxaspiro-[4,5]dec-6-yl acetate, acetanisole,<br>
methylsalicylique aldehyde, para-ethyl phenol, phenol, phenylethyl salicylate, menthol,<br>
cyclohexanecarboxamide, veratraldehyde, xylenol, dodecanoic acid, thymol, heliotropyl<br>
acetate, methyl anisate, methylnaphtylketone, myristic acid, palmitic acid,<br>
dimethylphenol, dimethyl acrylic acid, coumarine, methyl cyclopentenolone,<br>
7-methylcoumarin, phenylacetate, acetylpyrazine, phenylacetic acid, isoeugenyl acetate,<br>
raspberry ketone, naringin, propenyl guaethol, tetramethylpyrazine, acetylmethyl<br>
carbinol, 3-hydroxy-2-ethyl-4-pyranone, malic acid, resorcinol, benzoic acid, cinnamic<br>
acid, benjoin Sumatra, benjoin siam, citric acid, tartric acid, camphor, quinine<br>
chlorohydrate, ascorbic acid, borneol, glutamic acid, 5-methyl quinoxaline and malt<br>
extract. Other examples of flavour or fragrance components suitable for the purpose of<br>
the invention may be found in the current literature, e.g. in Fenaroli's Handbook of<br>
Flavour Ingredients, 1975, CRC Press ; Synthetic Food Adjuncts, 1947 by M.B. Jacobs,<br>
edited by Van Nostrand; or Perfume and Flavour Chemicals by S. Arctander, 1969,<br>
Montclair, N.J. (USA). These substances are well known to the person skilled in the art of<br>
perfurning, flavouring and/or aromatizing consumer products, i.e. of imparting an odour<br>
and/or a flavour or taste to a consumer product traditionally perfumed or flavoured, or of<br>
modifying the odour and/or taste of said consumer products. According to an<br>
advantageous embodiment of the invention, one will use a substance selected from the<br>
group consisting of heliotropine, benzophenone, menthol, methyl anisate and propenyl<br>
guaethol. Another most advantageous embodiment involves the use of menthol.<br>
The hydrophobic flavour or fragrance ingredient or composition used according to<br>
the invention is advantageously encapsulated and stabilised in a non crystalline form<br>
within an oligomeric or polymeric carrier. The carrier composition or the process for the<br>
preparation of the system of the invention are key factors to stabilise the flavour or<br>
fragrance ingredient or composition in a non crystalline state within the delivery system.<br><br>
In a first embodiment of the invention, the encapsulated ingredient or<br>
composition, is not miscible in the encapsulating carrier material at ambient temperature,<br>
i.e. at a temperature typically comprised between 15 and 30°C.<br>
Appropriate concentrations of flavour or fragrance ingredient or composition in<br>
the matrix as defined in this embodiment are comprised between 0.1 and 70% by weight,<br>
relative to the weight of the dried product, and preferably between 5 and 20%.<br>
Appropriate oligomeric or polymeric carrier materials according to this<br>
embodiment of the invention are any carbohydrates or carbohydrate derivatives which can<br>
be readily processed through encapsulation techniques to form a barrier material<br>
protecting the ingredient mere-encapsulated. Particular examples of suitable materials<br>
include those selected from, the group consisting of sucrose, glucose, lactose, maltose,<br>
fructose, ribose, dextrose, isomalt, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, lactitol, maltitol, pentatol,<br>
arabinose, pentose, xylose, galactose, Trehalose®, hydrogenated corn syrup, maltodextrin,<br>
modified starches such as Capsul® (hydrogen octenylbutanedioate amylodextrin; origin :<br>
National Starch, USA), agar, carrageenan, gums, polydextrose and derivatives and<br>
mixtures thereof. Other suitable carrier ingredients are cited in reference texts such as<br>
H. Scherz, Hydrokolloide: Stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Geliermittel in Lebensmittel,<br>
Band 2 der Schriftenreihe Lebensmittelchexnie, Lebensmittelqualitat, Behr's VerlagGmbH<br>
&amp; Co, Hamburg, 1996. Maltodextrin is a particularly useful such material.<br>
The above mentioned carrier materials are given hereby by way of example and<br>
they are not to be interpreted as limiting the invention.<br>
An emulsifier agent is optionally added to the mixture constituted by the<br>
oligomeric or polymeric component and the volatile hydrophobic flavour or fragrance<br>
ingredient. Typical examples of suitable emulsifiers include lecithin, citric acid esters of<br>
fatty acids and the mixtures of the latter with vegetable oils such as fractionated coconut<br>
oil, but other suitable emulsifiers are cited in reference texts such as Food emulsifiers and<br>
their applications, 1997, edited by G.L. Hasenhuettl and R.W. Hartel.<br>
The delivery system of this embodiment of the invention proved to be particularly<br>
advantageous when used to encapsulate a flavour ingredient or composition. In fact, the<br>
system of the invention turned out to provide a totally unexpected boosting effect of the<br>
flavour substance there-encapsulated. In other words, the intensity of the flavour released<br>
from such a system was perceived in a very surprising intensive manner, as is well<br>
demonstrated by the examples below. Consequently, while the dosage required for<br><br>
perception of poorly water soluble compounds is usually high, the system of the invention<br>
advantageously allowed it to provide the same sensory effect at a much lower dosage of<br>
active flavouring component.<br>
The delivery system, of this embodiment of the invention, according to which the<br>
encapsulated ingredient is not soluble in the encapsulating carrier at ambient temperature<br>
and pressure, may be prepared by different encapsulation processes. In particular, it can<br>
have the form of a spray-dried product, or yet of an extruded product, as long as at the<br>
end of the process, the system is cooled quickly enough below the melting point of the<br>
encapsulated ingredient, thus leaving the latter in a supercooled non crystalline state. The<br>
cooling step is therefore the essential step in the process for the preparation of a delivery<br>
system according to this first embodiment of the invention.<br>
In the case of a spray-dried powder, the process for the preparation of this product<br>
comprises the steps of dispersing the active flavour or fragrance ingredient or<br>
composition with an aqueous solution of the carrier based on a wall-forming carbohydrate<br>
material, then heating the dispersion to a temperature above the melting point of the<br>
flavour or fragrance ingredient or composition, then homogenising the dispersion and<br>
finally spray-drying the latter such that the flavour or fragrance ingredient or composition<br>
has no time to re-crystallise. The spray-drying apparatus used in such a process can be of<br>
any one of the various commercially available apparatuses. Examples of such spray-<br>
drying apparatuses are the Anhydro Dryer (origin: Anhydro Corp. of Attleboro Falls,<br>
Mass.) the Niro Dryer (manufactured by Niro Atomizer Ltd., Copenhagen, Denmark), or<br>
a Leaflash apparatus (origin: Rhone Poulenc, France).<br>
In the case of extrusion, the process which leads to an extruded delivery system as<br>
defined above comprises the steps of dispersing the hydrophobic flavour or fragrance<br>
ingredient or composition within the carrier; extruding the dispersion at a temperature<br>
above the melting temperature of the flavour or fragrance ingredient or composition; and<br>
cooling the extruded melt down below the melting point of the flavour or fragrance<br>
ingredient or composition at a cooling rate such that the latter has no time to re-<br>
crystallise. Therefore, at the end of the process, the active is, within the carrier material,<br>
in a non-crystalline glassy state. The process of the invention uses conventional extruding<br>
apparatuses. An example of a commercially acceptable extruding apparatus is that under<br>
the trade name designation of Clextral® BC 21 twin-screw extruder. However, extruding<br>
apparatuses are not limited to the twin screw variety and may also include, for example,<br><br>
single screw, ram, or other similar extrusion methods. The extrusion apparatus is<br>
equipped with a temperature regulation mechanism allowing the progressive increase of<br>
the temperature of the mixture up to a value typically comprised between 80 and 130°C,<br>
at which point the melt can be extruded.<br>
The system corresponding to the first embodiment of the invention may be easily<br>
and advantageously used in applications wherein a high intensity of a flavour ingredient<br>
or composition is desired, such as in chewing gums, hard-boiled candies or yet in<br>
compressed tablets, lozenges, bakery applications, chocolate applications, gummies,<br>
chewy sweets, or oral care products such as toothpaste.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, a distinct oligomeric or<br>
polymeric carrier material will be used. The latter has the particularity of being miscible<br>
with the active ingredient to be encapsulated. The nature of the carrier allowed to provide<br>
a delivery system according to the invention, i.e. wherein the active ingredient is in a non<br>
crystalline form.<br>
In an advantageous way of carrying out this other embodiment of the invention,<br>
the delivery system consists of an extruded product, and the carrier essentially comprises<br>
a cellulose ether which constitutes the continuous phase of the system, and the system<br>
further comprises a plasticizer miscible with said cellulose ether. Preferably, the cellulose<br>
ether is selected from the group consisting of methylcellulose, ethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phtalate.<br>
While these cellulose derivatives have already been described as part of the<br>
dispersed phase of an extrudable matrix, for instance in US 6,187,351, to our knowledge<br>
they have never until today, been taught as being suitable to form the continuous phase of<br>
a granular, i.e. extruded, product. This solution may have never been considered because<br>
the known aqueous cellulose ether systems are characterised by a so-called "inverse<br>
solubility-temperature behaviour" which implies that the polymers are soluble in cold<br>
water, but phase separate upon heating above a so-called lower critical solution<br>
temperature (LCST) which is typically above 40 and 50°C (see for example Doelker<br>
1993, in Cellulose derivates, Advances in Polymer Science, Vol. 107, pp. 199-265).<br>
Therefore aqueous cellulose ethers do not form a homogeneous thermoplastic material<br>
upon extrusion, the latter being performed typically above 40-50°C. Yet, we have now<br>
been able to solve this problem, and to extrude cellulose ethers at temperatures above 40-<br><br>
50°C, with, the particular aim of preparing a delivery system as defined in the present<br>
invention, i.e. wherein a normally crystalline hydrophobic solid is stabilised in a non<br>
crystalline form within a delivery system. In a more general and at the same time<br>
unexpected manner, this novel carrier composition proved also to be advantageously used<br>
with hydrophobic flavour or perfume materials which are not crystalline at ambient<br>
temperature and pressure, i.e. typically liquids.<br>
Therefore, another object of the invention is a novel granular delivery system<br>
comprising a hydrophobic flavour or fragrance ingredient or composition encapsulated in<br>
an oligomeric or polymeric carrier, characterised in that the carrier essentially consists of<br>
a cellulose ether, and in that the system comprises a plasticizer having a Hildebrand<br>
solubility parameter 5 below 48 [MPa]1/2.<br>
Examples of cellulose ethers suitable for this object of the invention are defined<br>
above, and include in particular methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethyl-<br>
cellulose phtalate.<br>
The cellulose ether constitutes the major polymeric constituent of the carrier.<br>
More particularly, it represents more than 50% of the oligomers and/or polymers<br>
constituting the carrier. This ingredient, when cited in the prior art, has only been<br>
disclosed as being used in the dispersed phase of an extrudable matrix composition.<br>
The system may contain optional ingredients such as colorants, fillers or yet anti-<br>
oxidants which are of common use in the encapsulation field.<br>
Moreover, an emulsifier agent is optionally added to the mixture constituted by<br>
the carrier component and the volatile flavour or fragrance ingredient. Typical examples<br>
of suitable emulsifiers include lecithin, citric acid esters of fatty acids and the mixtures of<br>
the latter with vegetable oils such as fractionated coconut oil, but other suitable<br>
emulsifiers are cited in reference texts such as Food emulsifiers and their applications,<br>
1997, edited by G.L. Hasenhuettl and R.W. Hartel.<br>
The plasticizer is an essential component of this novel delivery system as it makes<br>
it possible to extrude ether derivatives as carrier materials which are otherwise not<br>
extrudable. The plasticizer used in the present case is characterised by a particular<br>
Hildebrand solubility parameter, which parameter is known in the art to provide a useful<br>
polarity scale correlated to the cohesive energy density of molecules. The Handbook of<br>
Solubility Parameters (ed. A.F.M. Barton, CRC Press, Bocca Raton, 1991) gives a list of<br><br>
6 values for many chemicals, as well as recommended group contribution methods<br>
allowing to calculate 5 values for complex chemical structures. Suitable plasticizers for<br>
the purpose of the invention include in particular, propylene glycol, glucose, isomalt, corn<br>
starch syrup, glycerol, ethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, butylene glycol, triacetin,<br>
trialkylcitrate, triethylcitrate, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol and organic acids<br>
or mixtures thereof. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the hydrophobic active<br>
ingredient to be encapsulated can itself act as a plasticizer.<br>
The proportion of plasticizer in the delivery system varies between 5 and 95 % by<br>
weight relative to the total weight of the composition.<br>
We have unexpectedly found that the system comprising a hydrophobic flavour or<br>
fragrance ingredient or composition, a plasticizer as defined above and the cellulose ether,<br>
advantageously avoids a phase separation of the ingredients during the extrusion.<br>
While this novel combination of carrier and plasticizer can be used with any kind<br>
of hydrophobic flavour or fragrance material, it can be in particular advantageously used<br>
for the encapsulation of active ingredients as defined above for the purpose of the present<br>
invention, i.e. for hydrophobic flavour or fragrance ingredients or compositions which are<br>
crystalline at standard temperature and pressure and which it is desired to produce in<br>
another physical form. In fact, this carrier-plasticizer combination, when extruded with<br>
such ingredients, provides a flavour or fragrance delivery system wherein the active<br>
ingredient is in a non crystalline form.<br>
The final product has the advantage of being a free flowing dust-free granule with<br>
a reduced surface to volume ratio, which minimises the dissolution rate of modified<br>
celluloses, especially in hot water.<br>
The use of cellulose derivatives is also advantageous compared with usual carrier<br>
materials used in extrusion processes, as it allows to maximise the flavour or fragrance<br>
retention upon extrusion as shown in the examples below.<br>
In a more particular embodiment, the system described above consists of menthol<br>
as flavour ingredient, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) as carrier material, and<br>
propylene glycol as plasticizer. In fact, the latter system proved to be particularly efficient<br>
and to provide a very long lasting taste of menthol when consumed. Moreover, the<br>
concentration of menthol which can be used in such a system, can advantageously go up<br>
to 60% by weight, relative to the dried weight of the product.<br><br>
In another particular embodiment, the active ingredient used within the same<br>
system as that above mentioned, namely HPMC and propylene glycol, is a perfuming<br>
ingredient.<br>
The encapsulation system of the embodiment of the invention wherein the<br>
encapsulated ingredient is miscible with the encapsulating material at ambient<br>
temperature and pressure may be prepared by a standard extrusion process comprising the<br>
basic steps of combining and blending a hydrophobic flavour or fragrance ingredient or<br>
composition with a so-called "matrix" comprising a cellulose derivative and a plasticizer<br>
as defined above, under temperature and stirring conditions useful to produce a uniform<br>
melt thereof; extruding the uniform melt through a die ; and chopping, cutting, grinding<br>
or pulverising the material obtained as it exits the die or after cooling the melt.<br>
The extruding apparatuses suitable for the process are of the same type as those<br>
described above and the various parameters of the process may be adapted by a skilled<br>
person in the art.<br>
All the delivery systems here-above disclosed, in any one of the described<br>
embodiments, can be advantageously used to improve, enhance or modify the<br>
organoleptic properties of a perfuming or flavouring composition, when they are added to<br>
such a composition. In the field of flavours, these consumer products may include foods,<br>
beverages, pharmaceuticals and the like. More particularly, the system of the invention<br>
may be advantageously used to flavour chewing gums, hard-boiled candies, compressed<br>
tablets, lozenges, bakery applications, chocolate applications, gummies, chewy sweets, or<br>
oral care products such as toothpaste. On the other hand, in the field of perfumery, the<br>
granular solids according to the invention may be advantageously incorporated in a<br>
perfuming composition to be added to functional products such as detergents or fabric<br>
softeners. Other functional perfumery applications such as soaps, bath or shower gels,<br>
deodorants, body lotions, shampoos or other hair-care products, household cleaners,<br>
cleaning and deodorising blocks for toilet tanks may constitute suitable applications for<br>
the products according to the invention. These examples are of course neither exhaustive,<br>
nor restrictive of the invention.<br>
The concentrations in which the delivery systems of the invention can be<br>
incorporated in such consumer products vary in a wide range of values, which are<br>
dependent on the nature of the product to be flavoured or perfumed and on the release<br>
effect desired. Typical concentrations, to be taken strictly by way of example, are<br><br>
comprised in a range of values as wide as from a few ppm up to 5 or 10% by weight<br>
relative to the weight of the flavouring or perfuming composition or finished consumer<br>
product into which they are incorporated.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by way of the following examples, but is not<br>
limited to these examples. Temperatures are given in degrees centigrade and<br>
abbreviations have the meaning common in the art.<br>

Embodiments of the Invention<br>
Example 1<br>
A flavoured delivery system was prepared by admixing the following ingredients :<br>
Ingredients	Parts by weight<br>
Menthol1)	10<br>
Water	7<br>
Maltodextrin 19 DE	82<br>
1:1 Mixture of Citrem® 2) fractionated coconut oil 3)	 1.<br>
Total	100<br>
1)	. origin : Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland<br>
2)	origin : Danisco, Denmark<br>
3)	origin: Stearinerie-Dubois<br><br>
Using a Brabender (DDW-P3-DDSR20N) gravimetric feeder, a spray-dried formulation<br>
containing the menthol, water and maltodextrin was fed into a bench-top 16 mm Eurolab<br>
Thermoprism twin-screw extruder, equipped "with a screw configuration containing only<br>
transport elements. This spray-dried powder was conveyed through barrel 1 which was<br>
kept at ambient temperature. The mixture of Citrem® and fractionated coconut oil was<br>
injected (peristaltic pump : Watson Marlow 505 S) in barrel 2 at 30°. The powder was<br>
further heated up to 80° in barrel 3 and then to 110° in barrel 4 and 5 and extruded<br>
through a 2 mm die hole and further cooled at a cooling rate such that the menthol had no<br>
time to re-crystallise as proofed by the thermal analysis here-below. At a screw speed of<br>
130 rpm, and an overall through put of 0.5 kg/h, the mass temperature and pressure<br>
measured in the front plate of the extruder were of 104° and 15xl05 Pa, respectively.<br>
The product obtained was a granular delivery system. A thermal analysis was carried out<br>
by DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) on said granular delivery system on the one<br>
hand, and on crystalline menthol on the other.<br>
Temperature programme :<br>
1)	isotherm at -20° during 4 min<br>
2)	temperature slope from -20° to 95° at 107min<br>
3)	cooling from 95 ° to -20° at 20°/min<br>
4)	isotherm at -20° during 4 min<br>
5)	temperature slope from -20° to 95° at 10°/min<br>
The analysis displayed that menthol was in a non-crystalline form after the encapsulation<br>
process above-described. The same analysis carried out on menthol as such revealed a re-<br>
crystallisation of the latter with formation of polymorphic forms, as a function of the<br>
cooling rate.<br>
Example 2<br>
Comparison between applications flavoured with the delivery system of Example 1 and<br>
applications flavoured with menthol crystals<br><br>
A chewing gum base was prepared by blending crystalline sorbitol (54.8% of the final<br>
blend), acesulfame K (0.1%) and aspartame (0.1%) in a Turbula blender. Half the blend<br>
was mixed with a pre-warmed Nova T gum base (22.0%) (origin : L.A. Dreyfus) in a<br>
Winkworth sigma-blade mixer at 50-55° for 2 rnin. The remaining powder blend was then<br>
added with a humectant syrup (Lycasin® 80/55 (12%), Sorbi® (6%), glycerin (4%)) and<br>
mixed for a further 7 rnin.<br>
To this preparation, a delivery system as described in Example 1 was dosed at 2.07% and<br>
mixed for 1 min. To another sample of the same preparation, menthol crystals (957789,<br>
origin : Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland) were added at a dosage of 0.18% and mixed<br>
for 1 min.<br>
On the other hand, a hard-boiled candy base was prepared by adding 30 g of glucose<br>
syrup 42 DE to 122 g of sucrose syrup 65 Brix. The mixture was heated to 148° in a<br>
copper pan. At 148°, the copper pan was removed and the temperature checked. When<br>
temperature reached 135°., the flavouring system, namely a delivery system according to<br>
Example 1 dosed at 1% on the one hand, and menthol crystals dosed at 0.12% on the<br>
other, was added. The cooked mass was then poured at ambient temperature (at less than<br>
40% rH) in appropriate Teflon molds.<br>
A panel tested the delivery system of the invention compared with menthol crystals in the<br>
chewing-gum application on the one hand and in the hard-boiled candy application on the<br>
other.<br>
Fig. la) and 2a) report the concentration of menthol exhaled by the panelists as a function<br>
of time, measured by an Affirm® method.<br>
Affirm® Protocol:<br>
Panelists rinsed their mouth with water. A blank mouthspace level with the lips sealed<br>
round the AFFIRM mouthpiece was recorded; the panelists inhaling through the nose<br>
and exhaling through the mouth for one minute. Measurements of the menthol and<br>
acetone signals were recorded during 15 minutes while the panelists were chewing (for<br>
chewing gum). For hard-boiled candy, measurements were recorded during 10 minutes.<br>
Fig. lb) reports the perceived intensity of menthol as a function of time in the case of the<br>
chewing gum application. More particularly fifteen panellists were asked to evaluate on a<br><br>
continuous manner the menthol intensity over time using a computer acquisition system.<br>
Panellists scored the perceived intensity by moving the cursor from an electronic mouse<br>
on a linear intensity scale varying from 0 to 1.<br>
Fig. 2b) which corresponds to the hard boiled candy reports the results of a sensory test<br>
performed on a longer time scale using a discontinuous technique. Fifteen trained<br>
panellists had to evaluate the menthol intensity of the application at specific periods of<br>
time, namely 30 s, 2 min and 5 min, while sucking, on a linear intensity scale varying<br>
from 0 to 10.<br>
It appears from the results given in Fig. la) and 2a) that the concentration in menthol<br>
exhaled is increased with the delivery system of the invention, compared with the<br>
concentration exhaled when menthol crystals are used as such in the same application.<br>
On the other hand, Fig. lb) and 2b) show that the perceived intensity as a function of time<br>
is also increased with the delivery system of the invention, compared with that perceived<br>
when menthol crystals are used as such in the tested applications.<br>
Example 3<br>
A flavour delivery system was prepared by admixing the following ingredients :<br>
Ingredients	Parts by weight<br>
Menthol 1)	40<br>
Propylene glycol	19<br>
Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 2)	40<br>
1:1 Mixture of Citrem® 3) fractionated coconut oil 4)	 1<br>
Total	100<br>
1)	Firmenich menthol Nat. N° 957759 ; origin : Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland<br>
2)	origin : Dow chemicals<br>
3)	origin : Danisco, Denmark<br>
4)	origin: Stearinerie-Dubois<br>
Using a Brabender (DDW-P3-DDSR20N) gravimetric feeder, a dry blend of<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and menthol was fed into a bench-top 16 mm Eurolab<br><br>
Thermoprism twin-screw extruder, equipped with a screw configuration containing only<br>
transport elements. This powder mixture was conveyed through barrel 1 which was kept<br>
at ambient temperature. The mixture of Citrem® and fractionated coconut oil was injected<br>
(peristaltic pump : Watson Marlow 505 S) in barrel 2 at 30°. Menthol was molten in<br>
barrel 3 at 60° and propylene glycol was injected (peristaltic pump : Watson Marlow 505<br>
S) in barrel 4 at 90°. The material was further heated up to 120° in barrel 5 and extruded<br>
through a 2 mm die hole. At a screw speed of 130 rpm, and an overall through put of<br>
0.5 kg/h, the mass temperature and pressure measured in the front plate of the extruder<br>
were of 116° and 1 lxl 05 Pa, respectively.<br>
The granular delivery system thus obtained presented a very high load in flavour, as well<br>
as free-flowing characteristics, without any caking. A thermal analysis was carried out by<br>
DSC, following the same temperature programme as that described in Example 1. The<br>
first temperature slope allowed to melt the menthol. The cooling (step 3) usually leads to<br>
a re-crystallisation of the latter. However, in that case, no re-crystallisation was observed,<br>
even at -20°. The second temperature slope allowed to verify that menthol was non-<br>
crystalline, as no fusion peak was observed.<br>
Example 4<br>
A flavour delivery system was prepared by admixing the following ingredients :<br>
Ingredients	Parts by weight<br>
Orange 1)	7<br>
Propylene glycol	54<br>
Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 2)	38<br>
1:1 Mixture of Citrem®3) fractionated coconut oil 4)	 1<br>
Total	100<br>
1)	Firmenich orange flavour N° 51941; origin : Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland<br>
2)	origin : Dow chemicals<br>
3)	origin : Danisco, Denmark<br>
4)	origin: Stearinerie-Dubois<br>
Using a Brabender (DDW-P3-DDSR20N) gravimetric feeder, a dry blend of<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and orange oil was fed into a bench-top 16 mm Eurolab<br><br>
Thermoprism twin-screw extruder, equipped with a screw configuration containing only<br>
transport elements. This dry blend was conveyed through barrel 1 which was kept at<br>
ambient temperature. The mixture of Citrem® and fractionated coconut oil was injected<br>
(peristaltic pump : Watson Marlow 505 S) in barrel 2 at 30°. The dry blend was then<br>
heated to 60° in barrel 3 and propylene glycol was injected (peristaltic pump : Watson<br>
Marlow 505 S) in barrel 4 at 90°. The material was further heated up to 120° in barrel 5<br>
and extruded through a 2 mm die hole. At a screw speed of 130 rpm, and an overall<br>
through put of 0.5 kg/h, the mass temperature and pressure measured in the front plate of<br>
the extruder were of 125° and 32x105 Pa, respectively.<br>
The granular delivery system obtained was free-flowing and did not present any caking,<br>
thus bearing evidence of the efficiency of the matrix composition encapsulating a liquid<br>
hydrophobic active<br>
Example 5<br>
A flavour delivery system was prepared by admixing the following ingredients :<br>
Ingredients	Parts by weight<br>
Limonene	50<br>
Ethylcellulose 1)	50<br>
Total	100<br>
1) Aqualon® ; origin : Hercules<br>
The process used for the preparation of the delivery system is similar to that described in<br>
example 4. In the present case, limonene was used at the same time as flavouring<br>
ingredient, and as a plasticizer. The obtained particles were soft and non-sticking.<br>
In an aqueous environment, the particles proved to be characterised by a water absorption<br>
of 2% at 50% rH during 24 h.<br>
Similar products, namely particles with same characteristics were obtained when<br>
replacing limonene by an equimolar mixture of Verdox® (2-tert-butyl-l-cyclohexyl<br>
acetate; origin: International Flavors and Fragrances, USA), allyl heptanoate, hexyl<br>
salicylate and phenoxy isobutyrate.<br><br>
