				<td>A METHOD OF COMMUNICATION USING ORTHOGONAL FREQUENCY<br>
DIVISION MULTIPLEXING ('OFDM') FROM A TRANSMITTER;<br>
A TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER FOR USE THEREIN<br>
Description<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to a method of communication using orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing ('OFDM') from a transmitter and a transmitter and<br>
receiver for use therein. This invention relates generally to communication using<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing ('OFDM') and, more particularly, to<br>
channel estimation and tracking in OFDM communication.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
OFDM communication has been chosen for most of the modern high-data<br>
rate communication systems (Digital Audio Broadcast - DAB, Terrestrial Digital<br>
Video Broadcast - DVB-T, and Broadband Radio Access Networks - BRAN such as<br>
HIPERLAN/2, IEEE802.Ha/g, IEEE802.15.3a, for example, and is considered for<br>
future wide-band telephony standards, referred to as "4G"). However, in most<br>
cases the receiver needs an accurate estimate of the channel impulse response.<br>
Also, in the context of wireless local area networks (WLANs'), current data rates<br>
(54Mbps on top of the physical layer) are foreseen to be insufficient for very dense<br>
urban deployment, such as for hot spot coverage. This is the motivation for IEEE to<br>
propose and specify in the scope of the IEEE802.11n (the former High Throughput<br>
Study Group) solutions for very high data rate WLANs (targeting at least 100Mbps<br>
on top of the medium access control ('MAC') layer) in the 5GHz band. Another<br>
area of investigation is that of higher frequency bands where more spectrum is<br>
available such as the 60GHz band.<br>
One way of achieving higher data rates is to provide the system with multiple<br>
antennas both at the transmitter and at the receiver. By doing so, it is possible to<br>
increase the quality of the communication link by exploiting the spatial diversity<br>
dimension using for instance Space Time Block Codes ('STBC'), or to increase the<br>
spectral efficiency of the system by transmitting simultaneously different streams<br>
using Spatial Division Multiplexing. Therefore, Multiple Transmit Multiple Receive<br>
(MTMR) antenna systems are strong candidates for next generation WLANs and<br>
certain other OFDM communication systems.<br>
In the so-called Cyclic Prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) modulation scheme, each<br>
OFDM symbol is preceded by a guard interval that is longer than the channel<br>
impulse response (CIR) and a cyclic prefix or postfix, hereinafter referred to<br>
collectively as a cyclic affix, is inserted at the transmitter in a guard interval<br>
between consecutive OFDM symbols, the cyclic affix consisting of samples<br>
circularly replicated from the useful OFDM symbol time domain samples. The cyclic<br>
affix enables very simple calculation for the equalisation at the receiver, where the<br>
cyclic affix is discarded and each truncated block is processed, for example using<br>
Fourier Transform (usually Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)), to convert the<br>
frequency-selective channel output into parallel flat-faded independent sub-channel<br>
outputs, each corresponding to a respective sub-carrier. For equalisation purposes,<br>
numerous strategies exist. Following the zero forcing approach, for example, each<br>
sub-channel output is, unless it is zero, divided by the estimated channel<br>
coefficient of the corresponding sub-carrier.<br>
In the Zero Padded OFDM (ZP-OFDM) modulation scheme, as described for<br>
example in the article by B. Muquet, Z. Wang, G. B. Giannakis, M. de Courville,<br>
and P. Duhamel entitled "Cyclic Prefixing or Zero Padding for Wireless Multicarrier<br>
Transmissions" IEEE Trans, on Communications, 2002, the cyclic affix is replaced<br>
by null samples. This solution relying on a larger FFT demodulator, has the merit to<br>
guarantee symbol recovery irrespective of channel null locations when the channel<br>
is known.<br>
However channel estimation and tracking remains an issue, especially in the<br>
presence of high mobility or high frequency and data rates. Like other digital<br>
communication systems, OFDM modulation encounters problems at high Doppler<br>
spreads, which occur notably when the user is moving fast, for example in a car, or<br>
even at pedestrian speeds when investigating the area of higher frequency bands<br>
where more spectrum is available such as the 60GHz band. Accordingly, the<br>
channel impulse response needs to be constantly tracked and updated, especially<br>
in the presence of high Doppler spreads.<br>
It would be desirable for the OFDM modulation system to keep all the<br>
advantages of classic OFDM and additionally allow very simple and (semi-)blind<br>
channel estimation at the receiver. Semi-blind channel estimation means that<br>
substantially no additional redundancy is added to the system with respect to<br>
classic CP-OFDM, and therefore no bandwidth for data transmission would be lost;<br>
however, semi-blind channel estimation can be realized thanks to deterministic<br>
sequences known at both the transmitter and the receiver sides, as long as there is<br>
no substantial bandwidth loss for data transmission. Such a system would be<br>
advantageous in low-mobility scenarios and would make OFDM systems applicable<br>
to high-mobility scenarios as well.<br>
Our co-pending European Patent Application EP 02 292 730.5 describes a<br>
communication method in which the CP-OFDM time domain redundancy is<br>
replaced by a pseudo-randomly weighted deterministic sequence which leads to<br>
the so called Pseudo Random Postfix OFDM (PRP-OFDM). The advantages of<br>
being able to use ZP-OFDM are preserved and low complexity channel estimation<br>
at the receiver is made possible. Note that PRP-OFDM does not impact the<br>
achieved useful data rate and spectral efficiency compared to the classical CP-<br>
OFDM modulator, apart possibly from transmission of small amounts of data for<br>
the calculation of pseudo random parameters, since the only modification is the<br>
affix content, thus the low complexity channel estimation possible at the receiver<br>
side is also semi-blind.<br>
Our co-pending European Patent Application describes the application of<br>
PRP-OFDM to single transmit antenna systems and it is desirable to apply<br>
comparable techniques to MTMR systems, capable of using more than one<br>
transmit and/or receive antenna.<br>
US 2002/041635 A1 and WO 02/45329 describe OFDM systems in which<br>
training symbols are inserted between CP-OFDM data symbols and do not append<br>
known sequences to CP-OFDM data symbols. US 2002/041635 A1 describes the<br>
use of preambles inserted between OFDM data symbols, where the preamble<br>
includes training symbols. As such, said reference describes a system that<br>
generates training symbols, which are distinct from the generated OFDM data<br>
symbols, and does not describe the insertion of a deterministic sequence into a<br>
guard interval between symbols.<br>
WO 02/45329 describes the use of a known sequence p(n) that corresponds<br>
to a training symbol that is used to create a CP-OFDM symbol by inserting a cyclic<br>
prefix to the known sequence. Accordingly, WO 02/45329 also describes an OFDM<br>
system in which separate OFDM training symbols are generated to be included<br>
between OFDM data symbols. Said document does not describe the modifying of<br>
CP OFDM symbols by using a deterministic sequence within the CP portion of a<br>
CP OFDM data stream<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a method of communication using<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing, a transmitter and a receiver as<br>
described in the accompanying claims.<br>

example,<br>

system whose transmitter is shown in Figure 1,<br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
Figure 1 and Figure 2 show an OFDM communication system in accordance<br>
with one embodiment of the invention comprising a transmitter including an OFDM<br>
modulator 1 and a receiver including an OFDM demodulator 2, the transmitter and<br>
the receiver communicating over a communication channel 3.<br>
The OFDM communication method of this embodiment of the present<br>
invention enables estimation and tracking of the Multiple Input Multiple Output<br>
('MIMO') channels in coherent multiple transmit antenna / multiple receive antenna<br>
('MTMR') systems, without any specific limit to the number of transmit (TX) and<br>
receive (RX) antennas and without imposing any particular Space-Time Code<br>
(STC). Data and affix vectors are independently encoded by two STC and enable<br>
a semi-blind estimation of all the MIMO channels exploiting only the order-one<br>
statistics of the received signal.<br>
In the following description, lower (upper) boldface symbols will be used for<br>
column vectors (matrices) sometimes with subscripts N or P emphasizing their<br>
sizes (for square matrices only); tilde ('~') will denote frequency domain quantities;<br>
argument i will be used to index blocks of symbols; H (T) will denote Hermitian<br>
(transpose) operations.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the baseband discrete-time block equivalent model of an N-<br>
carrier PRP-OFDM MTMR transceiver with Nt, transmit and Nr receive antennae.<br>
The communication system is described with reference to Space-Time (ST) block<br>
codes ("STBCs") but it will be appreciated that the invention is also applicable to<br>
other code systems. In the transmitter, the Initial serial bit stream of constellation<br>
symbols is converted to a set of vectors in a serial-to-<br>
parallel converter (not shown); the fth Nx1 input digital vector is then<br>
modulated by an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform ('IFFT) matrix FNN in a<br>
transformer 4, where <br>
The resulting Nx1 time domain vector s(j) is processed by a suitable ST<br>
encoder matrix M in an encoder 10, as shown in Figure 1, creating outputs <br>
 is the block<br>
number i is the number of the TX antenna and n=lM+k indexes the outputs in<br>
Figure 1. It will be appreciated that, at least in the context of STBCs, M can differ<br>
from Ni, In particular, the STBC may lead to rectangular S(i), that is to say that M&gt;<br>
Nt. For the sake of simplicity, we assume in the following description that M<br>
operates on Ni; inputs (a(iN,),....,s(iN,+N,-1)). However, the Invention can be<br>
straightforwardly applied to M with other numbers of inputs. In this embodiment of<br>
the invention, the are linearly preceded in a precoder 11 by a zero-<br>
padded OFDM ('ZP-OFDM') preceding matrix where and<br>
The affix contents v,(n) are added to the data symbols<br>
 resulting in the output vectors qt(n). The output vectors<br>
q,(n) are converted to a series signal by a parallel-to-series converter 6, a pseudo<br>
random postfix being inserted in the signal into guard intervals between each<br>
consecutive OFDM symbol to produce a series digital signal s1(n) on the fth TX<br>
atenna. The series digital signal s1(n) is then converted to an analogue signal<br>
s,(t) by a digital-to-analogue converter 7 and transmitted over the channel 3.<br>
More particularly, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the postfix that<br>
is added in the guard interval comprises a pre-calculated suitable vector that is<br>
independent of the data and that Is weighted by a first factor ak and a second<br>
factor Wi(k). In one embodiment of the invention, the first factor ak is different from<br>
one time-domain OFDM symbol to another and is known both to the transmitter 1<br>
and to the receiver 2, so that any time domain (cyclo-)stationarity (leading to<br>
strong undesired frequency contributions at the repetition frequency) is avoided. In<br>
another embodiment of the invention, in which the symbols are coded in blocks,<br>
the first factor ak is different from one time-domain OFDM symbol block to another<br>
but is the same for each symbol of the same block. The second factor Wr(k)<br>
enables one of the transmit antennas to be distinguished from another.<br>
With an OFDM modulator in the transmitter functioning in this way, semi-blind<br>
channel estimation in the receiver can be done simply and at low arithmetical<br>
complexity, in particular, the receiver can constantly estimate and track the<br>
channel impulse response without any loss of data bandwidth compared to CP-<br>
OFDM, other than the transmission of PR-calculation parameters. Moreover, the<br>
demodulator at the receiver can have advantageous characteristics, ranging from<br>
very low arithmetical cost (at medium performance) to les low arithmetical cost<br>
(with very good system performance).<br>
As described in our copending European Patent Application referred to<br>
above for the single antenna case, several choices for the first factor ak are<br>
possible. It is possible to choose a, of any complex value. However, any ak with<br>
|ak|#1 leads to performance degradation compared to preferred embodiments of<br>
the invention.<br>
It is possible to limit the choice of ak, somewhat less generally to a complex<br>
value with |ak|=1. This choice usually leads to good system performance, but the<br>
decoding process risks to be unnecessarily complex. Preferred values of the first<br>
and second factors are described in more detail below.<br>
Preferably, the first factor ak is pseudo-random. In one embodiment of the<br>
present invention the first factor ak is deterministic and is calculated both by the<br>
modulator 1 and the demodulator 2 using the same algorithm and parameters that<br>
are stored in memory both in the transmitter and in the receiver. In another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, initialisation parameters for the algorithm are<br>
transmitted between the transmitter and the receiver to avoid systematically using<br>
the same sequence for the first factor ak. In yet another embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the first factor ak is communicated from the transmitter 1 to the<br>
receiver 2, which still represents an acceptable overhead in certain circumstances.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2,<br>
the affix is deterministic and is a Dx1 postfix vector c treated in an encoder 12 by<br>
a specific ST encoder matrix W which outputs the Dx1 vectors The<br>
way in which W ensures identification of the complete MIMO channel is described<br>
in more detail below. The postfix vectors are then linearly precoded<br>
in a precoder 13 by a ZP-OFDM matrix Tr, where to produce<br>
zero-padded postfix vectors as shown at 14 in Figure 3.<br>
The resulting vectors vi(n) are finally added to the data symbols ut(n) by<br>
adders to produce signals 16 for transmission.<br>
The signals received at the receive antennas are the transmitted signals<br>
multiplied by the Channel Impulse Response ('CIR") Hlm. and with the addition of<br>
noise and interference nm(n). Let Hlm be a PxP drculant matrix whose first row is<br>
given by is<br>
the Px1 channel impulse response between the lth transmit and the mth receive<br>
antennas; 0 is chosen such that D = L-1. Define HlmIST as the lower triangular part<br>
of including the main diagonal which represents the Intra-Symbol-lnterference<br>
(ISI), shall contain the upper triangular part of representing the Inter-<br>
Block-Interference (IBI), such that Therefore, the received signal<br>
vector on the mth antenna, 1= m = N, is, given by:<br>
where nm(n) is an zero-mean additive white independent identically distributed<br>
gaussian noise term.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, The demodulator 2 at the receiver comprises an analogue-<br>
to-digital converter 7 that converts the signals rm(t) received at the receive<br>
antennas to digital signals, a serial-to-parallel converter 8, which converts the<br>
received digital signals to received vectors rm(n), and a demodulator and equaliser<br>
9 that uses decoding matrices corresponding to the encoding matrices W and M to<br>
estimate the Channel Impulse Response CIR and demodulate the OFDM signals.<br>
In the following description of the operation of the receiver, an order-one<br>
channel estimation algorithm is described first, assuming the channel to be static.<br>
Then, the effect of Doppler is introduced for the mobility case and the<br>
corresponding channel estimator in the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE)<br>
sense described.<br>
First the received vector rm(n) is expressed in an exploitable form for<br>
channel estimation. For that purpose, let hdlm be the DxD circulant matrix of first<br>
row We define and such that<br>
 The signal rm(n), received during the nth OFDM symbol on<br>
the /nth antenna, 1 = m = N, is equal to:<br>
where are respectively the first D and last D<br>
samples of and <br>
Equation 1 indicates that a superimposition of the various postfixes<br>
convolved by the corresponding channels is interfering with the useful data. An<br>
easy independent retrieval of each of the channels based on the sole observation<br>
of the postfix contributions is obtained through isolation of each postfix convolved<br>
by its related channel. As detailed below, a way to achieve that condition is to<br>
perform a Fast Fourier Transform on the postfixes in the demodulator and<br>
equaliser 9 using a weighting ST block coding scheme W of the postfix c<br>
according to the following postfix generation process:<br>
where U is the Kronecker product and c, a(n) are respectively the deterministic<br>
postfix and the pseudo-random weighting factors introduced in our co-pending<br>
European Patent Application EP 02 292 730.5 for the single antenna case. The<br>
pseudo-random weighting factors a(n) are used to convert the deterministic<br>
postfix c into a pseudo-random one. Note that a new set of deterministic weighting<br>
factors is introduced, and gathered in the MxN, matrix W corresponding to the<br>
matrix W used for encoding the postfixes in the transmitter encoder, with<br>
 W is used to remove the interference<br>
between all transmitted postfixes and thus is invertible in this embodiment of the<br>
present invention: full column rank (rank(w)= N,). In the following description, we<br>
choose W orthogonal for this embodiment of the present invention, such that<br><br>
With the assumption of a static channel, an order-one channel estimator in<br>
the demodulator and equaliser 9 functions as follows. The first and last D samples<br>
of rm(n) are denoted respectively by rm.s(n) and rm,(n). By setting n=IMxk and<br>
assuming the transmitted time domain signal to be zero mean for all l, we<br>
use Equations 1 and 2 to compute for each k, 0 = k 
Next, is defined as the expectation of Due to the<br>
deterministic nature of the postfixes, it can be verified from Equation 1 that:<br>
Thus the MDx1 vector can be expressed for each<br>
receive antenna as:<br>
Since W is chosen orthogonal, multiplying each dM, 1= m= N, by<br>
 in the demodulator and equaliser 9 removes completely the<br>
interference between channel contributions <br>
Once the interference between channel contributions is removed the<br>
estimation algorithms of the single-antenna case of our co-pending European<br>
Patent Application EP 02 292 730.5 can be applied in the demodulator and<br>
equaliser 9:<br>
where CD is a DxD circulant matrix with the first row <br>
 represents the D first coefficients of Hence, the<br>
estimate of the time domain channel impulse response in the demodulator<br>
and equaliser 9 is obtained by multiplying <br>
Note that is a diagonal matrix that is known to both the transmitter and<br>
receiver and can thus be precalculated. Subsequently, is preferably<br>
transformed to the Px1 frequency domain vector This MIMO<br>
channel estimation (i.e. estimation of all channels between any transmit and any<br>
receive antenna) is used to space-time decode and equalise the received data<br>
signals, as described in more detail in examples below, such that the transmitted<br>
data signals can be recovered.<br>
The above channel estimator can be extended to further improve reception in<br>
mobile environments by using any Doppler model, and by minimizing any<br>
performance criterion. An example is now given, in a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention based on the introduction of a Doppler model; the estimator aims<br>
at minimizing the Mean Square Error (MSE).<br>
The Doppler module shown in Figure 4 is introduced in the demodulator and<br>
equaliser 9 to modify the order-one autoregressive model for the Channel Impulse<br>
Response ('CIR') between transmit antenna / and receive antenna m separately:<br>
 is the Oth order Bessel function,<br>
fD is the Doppler frequency, DT is tine MTMR PRP-OFDM block duration and<br>
 is zero-mean complex Gaussian of constant variance. The same CIR<br>
correlations as the ones provided by the known Jakes model are obtained even in<br>
the presence of large Doppler frequencies. This is achieved by forcing the<br>
correlation This way the<br>
approximation , inherent to the order-one<br>
autoregressive estimation, is avoided. This modification leads to the following<br>
moving average estimation:<br>
As for the order-one autoregressive model, so-called process-noise vectors<br>
 are introduced assuming <br>
being the CIR to be estimated. Assuming that CIR is estimated based on Z<br>
noisy observations the expression<br>
 results from the convolution of the lth<br>
block postfix by channel corrupted both by thermal noise and the OFDM<br>
data symbols. The OFDM data symbols are assumed zero-mean and independent<br>
of same variance as the postfix samples. contains<br>
the received symbols after equalization of the pseudo random weighting factor of<br>
the postfixes (Equation 3). Thus, (i) can be expressed as follows:<br>
where a gathers the thermal noise and the interference from the OFDM data<br>
symbols, in order to guarantee the unit variance of each channel realisation, the<br>
norm of is chosen such that:<br>
It can thus be verified that the optimum estimator of in the MMSE<br>
sense is given from Equation 8 by:<br>
and is the auto-correlation matrix of the vector a.<br>
Since in practice the channel power profile is usually not known, in that case<br>
the assumption is made that The real gain gn is<br>
introduced for respecting the power constraints of Equation 9.<br>
The above description presents generic channel estimation in the<br>
demodulator and equaliser 9 in accordance with embodiments of the present<br>
invention for both relatively static and high mobility environments. Their use for two<br>
STBC systems will now be described.<br>
The first embodiment of STBC is based on ZP-OFDM decoding. The system<br>
includes modulators using pseudo-random postfixes at the transmitter and also<br>
equalizer structures derived for the MTMR case from those described for the<br>
Single Transmit Single Receive (STSR) case in our co-pending European Patent<br>
Application EP 02 292 730.5 based on the transformation of the received PRP-<br>
OFDM vector to the ZP-OFDM case. The system is described for the case of<br>
Nt=2 transmit and Nr =1 receive antennas, although it will be appreciated that<br>
the system is applicable to other numbers of antennas. The ST encoder operates<br>
over Nt xM vectors with Nt = M = 2. Since Nt = 1, the subscript 1= m = Nr is not<br>
used in the following analysis. Perfect knowledge of the channels ht, 1= l = Nt is<br>
assumed but it will be appreciated that the system is capable of working with<br>
imperfect channel knowledge.<br>
At the transmitter, a 2x1 ZP-ST encoder M is used, which takes two<br>
consecutive OFDM symbols S(2i) and S(2i+1) to form the following coded matrix:<br>
where the permutation matrices are such that, for a J x 1<br>
vectors <br>
Since the channel has been estimated, as for the single antenna case<br>
described in our co-pending European Patent Application, it is always possible to<br>
retrieve the MTMR ZP-OFDM signals from Equation 1 by subtracting from the<br>
received signal the known PRP contribution:<br>
which leads to Note that i) no constraint has to be set on<br>
W for the symbol recovery, ii) the PRP interference cancellation procedure<br>
proposed is generic and can be applied to any suitable ST encoder M.<br>
A suitable detection algorithm is applied to the signal described by Equation<br>
12 by the demodulator and equaliser 9. Noticing that we denote<br>
by then<br>
if we switch to the frequency domain by computing and<br>
 exploiting the fact that we can<br>
write:<br>
where is an orthogonal channel matrix. Thus multiplying by<br>
DH achieves the separation of the transmitted signals and it<br>
can be shown that full transmit diversity is achieved. Note that the separation of<br>
signals allows the same equalisation schemes to be used in this embodiment of<br>
the present invention as in the single-antenna case described in our co-pending<br>
European Patent Application EP 02 292 730.5.<br>
The second embodiment of STBC system is based on equalization of the full<br>
received block by diagonalisation of pseudo-circulant channel matrices. The ST<br>
data encoder M used in the demodulator and equaliser 9 is based on a version of<br>
the single antenna system described in our co-pending European Patent<br>
Application EP 02 292 730.5 modified to enable the equalization structure that is<br>
detailed below and outputs blocks of Ntx M vectors with N, =M = 2. M and W<br>
are specified such that they generate the following matrix<br>
 at the antenna outputs:<br>
 being a permutation matrix defined as previously (Inversing the order of the<br>
vector elements), a(i) is complex with being pseudo-random complex<br>
weighting factors as defined in our co-pending European Patent Application for the<br>
single antenna case with a(2(+l)=ß2(i)a(2i), and ß(i)=a(2i-2)/a(2i). Qß(i) is<br>
defined as:<br>
The D x1 postfix vector c is chosen such that it has Hermitian symmetry,<br>
that is to say that the complex conjugate of the vector read backwards is equal to<br>
the original c. As In our co-pending European Patent Application, the channels are<br>
represented by Px P pseudo-circulant channel matrices These<br>
are identical to standard circulant convolution matrices with the upper triangular<br>
part multiplied by the scalar factor ß(i), In other words <br>
With and the noise matrix<br>
 , the received signals over M = 2 symbol times are given<br>
as follows:<br>
With the following operations are performed at the<br>
demodulator and equaliser 9 on the received vectors:<br>
In this embodiment of STBC system, the data symbols are separated in the<br>
demodulator and equaliser 9 by premultiplication of by the Hermitian of the<br>
upper channel matrix WH(i):<br>
with The equalisation based on pseudo<br>
circulant channel matrices is then performed as presented in our co-pending<br>
European Patent Application for the single channel case. The PRP-OFDM postfix<br>
based blind channel estimation is performed based on R(i) as presented above.<br>
