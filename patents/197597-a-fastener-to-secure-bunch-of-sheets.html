				<td>FIELD OF INVENITON<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a fastener to secure bunch of sheets such as currency notes, paper sheets, plastic sheets etc..<br><br>
PRIOR ART<br><br>
Fasteners are used to secure bunch of sheets, which may be currency notes, paper sheets or plastic sheets. The fastening method, which is generally used in the known art is stapling machine, which applies staple pins to the bunch of sheets. A serious disadvantage of stapling machine is that it makes holes and damages the sheets, which is not desirable particularly for currency notes as it reduces the life of currency notes, and printing of currency notes involves foreign exchange. The stapling of currency notes has recently been stopped by Reserve Bank of India for the purposes of prolonging the life of currency notes.<br>
Another disadvantage of use of the stapling machine is that a currency note can be pulled out from the stapled bundle of sheet or currency notes. The pulling out of a note causes only cuts on stapled edge of a currency note which still remains valid.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the stapling machine is that the stapling machine is not user friendly as it requires another device like knife, screw driver, a staple opener etc. for removing unwanted staple pins for the purposes of loosening of sheets/currency notes etc. In the process of removing unwanted staples, the fingers of the user may sometimes get injured, besides damaging the sheets/currency notes etc.<br>
Further disadvantage of the stapling machine is that staple pins once applied cannot be reused aI~er removal and have to be discarded and therefore it involves recurring expenditure on staple pins.<br>
Yet further disadvantage of the stapling machine is that different sizes of staple pins are required for different grades of stapling machine depending upon the number of sheets, type of sheets, etc.<br><br>
Even further disadvantage of the stapling machine is that staple pins which secure the sheets, get corroded with passage of time and spoil the sheets/currency notes.<br><br>
Yet further drawback of the stapling machine is that it is difficult to apply staple pins to a bunch of plastic sheets.<br>
Even further drawback of the stapling machine is that once staple pins are removed the entire bunch becomes loose unless re-stapled or kept together with a rubber band which may further damage the sheets.<br>
Another fustener known in the art is a general metallic clip for fastening sheets.<br><br>
A disadvantage of the metallic clip is that it can be easily pressed open with the result that the bunch of papers particularly currency notes can be very easily tempered and any number of sheets can be removed or inserted into the bunch.<br>
Another disadvantage of the metallic clip is that it may get corroded and spoil the sheets fastened therein.<br><br><br>
Still another disadvantage of the metallic clip is that the spring mechanism used in the metallic clips looses tension with passage of time with the result that the clip looses grip on sheets and has to be discarded.<br><br>
Another fastener known in the art, which has been used extensively over the years is iron pins.<br><br>
A disadvantage of the above device is that iron pin can be used to fasten only a limited number of sheets from 5-10 sheets.<br><br>
Another disadvantage of the above device is that it makes holes in the sheets thereby spoiling the sheets.<br><br>
Still another disadvantage of the above device is that the pins get corroded and spoil the sheets.<br><br>
Further disadvantage of the above device is that tempering of the bunch of papers is very easy as sheets can be easily taken out and the pin can be applied again.<br><br>
Still further disadvantage of the above device is that while forcing the iron pin through the bunch of sheets, it may injure the fingers.<br>
Still another flistener known in the art is U-clip or gem clip.<br><br>
A disadvantage of the above device is that it can also hold limited number of sheets.<br><br>
Another disadvantage of the above device is that tempering of sheets is very easy.<br><br>
Still another disadvantage of the above device is that it has very poor grip on sheets and is not able to secure the sheets properly.<br><br><br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br><br><br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a fastener, which secures bunch of sheets without making any holes in the sheet or damaging the sheets in any way, which is specifically more relevant for currency notes as it prolongs the life of currency notes.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a fhatener, which secures the sheets.<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a fastener, which does not require any expendable item (like staple pins used in stapling machine) and therefore does not involve any recurring expenditure.<br><br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide a fastener, which is reusable over a very long period without any wear or tear.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide a fastener, which retains strong grip over the papers over a very long period of time.<br><br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a fastener, which makes a bunch of currency notes, as temper-proof when a note-slip duly authenticated is pasted over the fastener.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide a fastener wherein, after removing the sealing authenticated note-slip pasted over it, the sheets can be taken out from the bunch and the fastener can be applied with same grip to the left over sheets<br><br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a fastener which can be used for bunch of any type of sheets including plastic sheets and currency notes of any denomination.<br><br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide a fastener, which can be used for any number of sheets by taking U-clip of the fastener of suitable width.<br><br>

DESCRITPION OF FIGURES<br><br><br>
The invention will now be illustrated with the help of drawings, which show an embodiment of the present invention. It is to be noted that features and concepts or the present invention can be embodied in numerous embodiments, which are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. In the accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig. 1:	sh6ws the construction of the present invention;<br>
Fig.2:	shows the construction of U-shaped clip;<br>
Fig.3:	shows the construction of clasp:<br>
Fig.4 and 4a:	shows the construction of two halves of clasp;<br><br><br><br>
DESCRITP1ON OF INVENTION W.R.T DRAWINGS<br><br>
Referring to fig. 1. which shows an embodiments of the fastener of the present invention. which specifically but without implying any limitation, can be used for currency notes.<br>
The fastener comprises of U-shaped clip (1), which may be metallic or plastic depending upon the requirement/application, and a clasp (2) which can rotate around a hinge pin (4) provided in the upper arm of the U-clip. The base arm of the clip is rectangular in shape and longer in length, about 3 times in length as compared to the upper arm. The upper arm has a horizontal T-shaped projection (3), which terminates into circular hinge pin (4) as shown in fig.2. The said clasp (2) can rotate around the hinge pin (4) through (~)60O to 90~, when there are no sheets/currency within the U-clip and through 0 to 900 when U-clip is full of sheets/currency notes. When clasp (2) is raised up, the grip of the clasp on the sheets/currency notes, which are kept within the U-clip (1), loosens and desired number of sheets/currency notes can be taken out. After taking out the required number of sheets, the clasp (2) can be brought down to 00 to tighten the grip on the remaining number of sheets/currency notes and then not a single sheet' currency note can be taken out unless the clasp (2) is raised up again. Any forced taking out of sheet/currency note, when clasp is in zero degree position, will completely damage the sheet/currency notes and invalidate the currency note. Thus remaining number of sheets/currency notes can also be made temper-proof by keeping clasp at zero degree position and sealing the clasp by pasting an authenticated slip over it.<br>
Referring to fig.2, which shows the construction of U-clip, which may be metallic or plastic, depending upon requirement/application, the base arm of the clip being preferably 2 to 3cm. The upper arm has preferably 0.7 to 1cm length. However, the dimensions are indicative and may be adapted as per the requirement/application. The height/width of U-clip is around 1cm which conforms to the height of one hundred currency notes of any denomination. However height also may be adapted as per requirement/application. The upper arm has T-shaped projection (3) which terminates into a circular hinge pin (4) around which clasp (2) can rotate.<br>
Referring to fig.3, which shows the construction of clasp (2), the clasp has a tapered end (5) at one end which facilitates the grip by fingers in raising or lowering down the clasp for loosening or tightening the grip on sheets/currency notes arranged edge to edge and one edge of the bunch of currency notes being kept within the U-clip. The clasp (2) has pushing cam (6) structure at the other end which is a wedge type structure at right angle to the length of clasp. The clasp (2) has hole (14) through the hinge pin of clip (1) can be inserted. When the clasp (2) is lowered to 00, the wedge shaped pushing cam (6) of the clasp pushes against the sheets/currency notes kept inside the clip (1) and securely fastens the sheets/currency notes kept therein.<br>
Referring to fig (4) and (4a), the clasp (2) further comprises of two half clasps (7,8). Each half clasp is tapered at one end and has push cam structure at the other end. The push cam (6) structure at the other end of each half of the clasp has a circular hole (9) and (15) through which the hinge pin (4) of the projection (3) of upper part of U-clip can be inserted so that each part of clasp can rotate around hinge pin (4). The half (7) of the clasp has male part (10) and female part (11) whereas the half clasp (8) of the clasp has female part (12) and male part (13). The half clasp (7) of the clasp is mounted on one side of the pin (4) and other half clasp (8) is mounted on the other side of pin (4). When the two half clasps are pushed against each other, after mounting one on the one side of hinge pm through hole (9) and other on the other side of hinge pin (4) through hole (15), the male part (10) of the half clasp (7) gets fixed into the female part (12) of the half clasp (8) and the male part (13) of the half clasp (8) get fixed into the female part (11) of the half clasp (7) and the two half clasp (7) and (8) get secured to each other and together form clasp as shown in fig.3.<br><br>
Method of use<br><br><br>
The fastener of present invention shown in fig. 1, is specifically but without implying any limitation, is useful for fastening currency notes of any denomination. The clasp (2) is raised to 900 and one edge of the bunch of currency notes arranged edge to edge, is kept within the U-clip (1). After placing the arranged bunch of currency notes within the U-clip (1), the clasp(2) is lowered down to 00 angle. This results into pushing of the pusher cam (6) of clasp (2) against the currency notes and fastening the notes within the U-clip. The notes thus fastened cannot be taken out unless the clasp (2) is raised again to 900. When clasp is at 00, if an attempt is made to pull out a currency note, the currency note will be completely damaged beyond use. Therefore to prevent tempering of currency notes i.e. to prevent taking out of currency notes from thus fastened bunch, a sealing note-slip duly authenticated, need to be pasted over the clasp (2). Unless such authenticated note-slip pasted over clasp (2), is tempered, the clasp cannot be raised to 900 angle and unless clasp (2) is raised to 9()0, no currency note can be taken out. Another advantage of this fastener is that after taking out required number of currency notes/ sheets, by raising up the clasp (2), the remaining number of currency notes can again be fastened by lowering down the clasp (2) and pasting signed slip over it, if desired. This is not possible with stapling machine which requires remaining notes to be stapled again to make it temper-proof. Further in the present invention the U-clip does not in any way, pierce through the sheets/currency notes and thus the currency notes are not damaged in any way. By taking U-clip of plastic material or of any non corroding metallic material, the problem of corrosion and spoiling of currency notes by corrosion, can be eliminated.<br><br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to modifications, changes and adaptations by those sldlled in the art. Such variant embodiments incorporating the concepts and features of the present invention, are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
