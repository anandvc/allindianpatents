				<td>FIELD OF THE INENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the process of purification of paclitaxel<br>
trihydratc and docetaxel trihydrate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
purificatioa of semi-synthetic paclitaxel and docetaxel, which are well<br>
known and approved chemotherapeutic drugs for treatment of metastatic<br>
cancer, is a challenging problem due to formation of a number of<br>
degradation products along the synthetic route. Furthermore,; purified!<br>
taxanes are found to undergo degradation, even under controlled storage<br>
condition. Therefore, it becomes desirable to develop stable crystalline<br>
forms of these molecules, which retain the desirable anti-cancer properties.<br>
Towards this end Rhone-Poulenc Rover, S.A., France has developed<br>
processes for preparation of trihydrates of paclitaxel and docetaxel.<br>
According to Authelin et al, US Patent 6,022,985 stability studies have<br>
shown that docetaxel trihydrate is stable at 4°C, 25°C, and 35°C in an<br>
atmosphere with 00% relative humidity upto 18 months without<br>
modification in its crystalline form. Under similar condition, anhydrous<br>
docetaxel slowly changes its crystalline form to the trihydrate form. This US<br>
Patent describes a process for the preparation of docetaxel trihydrate by<br>
crystallization of anhydrous docetaxel from a mixture of water and an<br>
aliphatic alcohol containing 1-3 carbon atom, specifically ethanoL The<br>
water/alcohol weight ratio used in this innovation is about 2/1 The crystals<br>
obtained thus, are dried under defmed condition of temperature (about<br>
40°C), pressure (4-7) kPa and relative humidity of about 80%. The<br>
crystallization was also performed in the presence of ascorbic acid.<br><br>
In US Patent 6,197,980 to Durand ct al., a process for centrifugal partition<br>
chromatography of crude docetaxel in two partially miscible phases using an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon, an ester, an alcohol and water, is described.<br>
Docetaxel trihydrate is obtained by concentrating the column fractions. The<br>
process did not specify drying conditions.<br>
Similarly paclitaxel trihydrate is reported to have markedly superior stability<br>
in comparison to the anhydrous product. (Authelin el al US Patent<br>
6,002,022). According to this invention, paclitaxel trihydrate is obtained<br>
from a mixture of water and an aliphatic alcohol containing upto three<br>
carbon atoms, specifically methanol. The water/alcohol weight ratio used in<br>
this process is between 3/1 to 1/3. The crystals, thus obtained, are dried at<br>
about 40°C under reduced pressure.<br>
Both the US patents US 6,022,985 and US 6,002,022 are limited in scope, in<br>
terms of solvents that could be used for crystallization. Both use aliphatic<br>
alcohols containing 1-3 carbon atoms as the solvent of choice. In addition,<br>
paclitaxel or docetaxel used for crystallization has to be chromatographed<br>
beforehand. Furthermore, die drying conditions used in these patents are<br>
specific and recommended conditions are not easy to maintain. In view of<br>
the above we have developed a process, for preparation of paclitaxel<br>
trihydrate and docetaxel trihydrate, which do not require chromatography.<br>
Instead, we use solvent - based purification technique, which is faster,<br>
cheaper, and can be scaled up easily. We also found that the choice of<br>
solvents in the crystallization of paclitaxel or docetaxel is not necessarily<br>
limited to alcohols and aliphatic nitriles. are as effectiveas alcohols.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
An object of the invention is to provide a process for obtaining<br>
pharmaceutical grade docetaxel trihydrate and paclitaxel trihydrate from<br>
semi-synthetic crude docetaxel or paclitaxel.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process which produces<br>
paclitaxel trihydrate and docetaxel trihydrate of chromatographic purity &gt;<br>
99.5%.<br>
Stilt another object of the present invention is to propose a simple process,<br>
of the preparation of paclitaxel trihydrate and docetaxel trihydrate.<br>
SUMAMRY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for tfrejgoparatitm of<br>
paclitaxel trihydrate and doctaxel trihydrate comprising: (a) treating tax an e<br>
selected from paclitaxel and docetaxel with a mixture of alkane and<br>
chlorinated alkane to obtain a crude product of 65-75% assay; (b) dissolving<br>
the crude product thus obtained in alky! ketone followed by slow addition of<br>
an alkane to increase chromatographic purity, (c) dissolving the tax an e of<br>
step (b) in an aliphatic nitrile at a temperature of 50-70T, (d) adding<br>
purified water to the product of step (c) to precipitate tax an e trihydrate; and<br>
(e) filtering and drying the product of step (d) to obtain taxane trihydrate of<br>
C.P. &gt;99.5% and 98-102% assay.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a process for<br>
preparing paclitaxel trihydrate and docetaxel trihydrate. The procedure<br>
comprises-the following steps:<br><br>
Crude taxane (C.P. 60-70%; assay 40-55%) is added to mixture of<br>
chlorinated alkane and alkane (1:9; 10 times with respect to taxane). The<br>
mixture is stirred for 2-6 h, preferably 4h at 25-30°C and then filtered under<br>
vacuum to obtain a material of 55-65% assay. Step 1 is repeated to increase<br>
the purity of the crude product to 65 -75% assay. The preferred chlorinated<br>
alkane is dichlorom ethane and the preferred alkane is hexane.<br>
Stop 2<br>
The taxane obtained in step 1 is dissolved in alkyl ketone (6-20 times with<br>
respect to crude weight) at 20-45°C. The solution is cooled, Tittered and then<br>
an alkane (2-3 times with respect to alkyl ketone) is added slowly under<br>
stirring at 25-35°C. The mixture is stirred further at 25-35°C for 2-4 h,<br>
filtered and the residue is dried under vacuum. In case of repetition of step 2<br>
the ratio of alkyl ketone and alkane used with respect to taxane is 20-30<br>
times and 40-60 times respectively. After step 2 chromatographic purity of<br>
taxane reaches 93-99.7%. The preferred alkyl ketone is a lower alkyl ketone,<br>
most preferably acetone. Among alkanes used, hexane is most preferable.<br>
Step 3<br>
The taxane obtained in step 2 is dissolved in an aliphatic nitrile, most<br>
preferably acetonitrile (20-30 times with respect to taxane) at 50-70°C. To<br>
this solution, purified water (2-3 times with respect to aliphatic nitrile) is<br>
added slowly and then the mixture is stirred further at 10-25oC for 2-4 h. The<br>
precipitated material is filtered and men dried at 35-45oC under 650 - 700<br>
mm mercury vacuum for 36-40 h with powdering at regular interval under<br><br>
relative humidity 80-90%. The taxane thus obtained, has C.P. &gt;99.5%, assay<br>
98-102% and water content 6.2-7.2%.<br>
