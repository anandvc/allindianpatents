				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF TAXAN DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of the compound 13-(N-Boc-isobutylisoserinyl)-14p-hydroxybaccatme III 1,14-carbonate, of formula (I):<br><br>
Compound (I), disclosed in PCT WO 01/02407 , is particularly active against breast, lung, ovary, colon, prostate, kidney and pancreas tumors, as well as against cells resistant to known antitumor agents, such as adriamycin, vinblastine and some Pt derivatives. 14-Hydroxy-l,14-carbonate-deacetylbaccatine III derivatives are usually prepared starting from the precursor 14-hydroxy-deacetylbaccatine III, a natural compound obtainable in small amounts by extraction of Taxus wallichiana leaves, as disclosed in EP 559,019. There is strong need for alternative processes for the easy and effective preparation of 14p-hydroxy-l,14-carbonate-deacetylbaccatine III derivatives, in particular of compounds (I).<br>
The process according to the invention uses as starting material 10-deacetylbaccatine III which, contrary to 14-hydroxy-baccatine III, may be easily recovered in large amounts from Taxus baccata leaves.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) which comprises the following steps:<br>
a)       protection of the hydroxyls at the 7- and 10- positions of 10 deacetylbaccatine III:<br><br>
wherein R and R1, which can be the same or different, are selected from hydrogen, C1-C10 alkyl or aryl, C1-C10 alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl, trichloroacetyl, C1-C4 trialkylsilyl; preferably, when R and r1 are the same, they are trichloroacetyl, whereas when they are different, preferably R is trichloroacetyl and R1 is acetyl, or R is triethyl or trimethylsilyl or BOC and r1 is acetyl;<br>
b) two-step oxidation to give the derivative oxidized to carbonyl at the 13- position and hydroxylated at the 14- position:<br>
c)       carbonation of the vicinal hydroxyls at the 1- and 14- positions to give the 1,14-carbonate derivative:<br>
d)<br>
reduction of the carbonyl at the 13- position:<br>
 e)       removal of the protective groups at the 7- and 10- positions: <br><br>
f)<br>
selective acetylation of the hydroxyl at the 10- position:<br>
g)       transformation of 14-hydroxy-baccatine-l,14-carbonate III into the derivative triethylsilylated at the 7- position:<br>
h)       reaction of the compound from step (g) with (4S,5R)-N-Boc-2-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-isobutyl-1 -oxazolidine-5-carboxylic acid:<br>
i)        removal of the trietttylsilyl and dimethoxybenzylidene protective groups from the compound from step (h): \The procedures for the selective protection of the 7- and 10- hydroxyls are described by Holton et al., Tetrahedron Letters 39, (1998) 2883-2886. The selective protection of the hydroxyls of the starting compound deacetylbaccatin III is possible due to their different reactivity. In particular, the reactivity towards acylating, alkylating or silylating agents has been found to vary in the order C(7)-OH&gt;C(10)-OH&gt;C(13)-OH&gt;C(1)-OH, therefore the groups at 7- and 10- can be selectively protected while keeping the hydroxyls at 1- and 13- free. Furthermore, by changing the reaction conditions, it is possible to reverse the reactivity order of the hydroxyls at 7- and 10- thus allowing the differential substitution thereof. Examples of reactants and reaction conditions usable in the protection of the hydroxyls at 10- and 7- are reported in the above cited publication. Similar selectivities are obtained starting fro 14}-hydroxybaccatine-l,14-carbonate.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, deacetylbaccatine III is reacted with trichloroacetyl chloride in methylene chloride in the presence of triethylamine and using dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in catalytic amounts. The use of the protective trichloroacetic groups proved to be very advantageous in the subsequent oxidation, carbonation and reduction steps (respectively (b), (c) and (d). In particular the 7,10-bis-trichloroacetate derivative, which is obtained in quantitative yields from the starting product, is oxidized and carbonated, then easily reduced at the 13- position with simultaneous deprotection of the trichloroacetic groups to give 14-hydroxy-1,14 carbonate-deacetylbaccatine III. The use of DMAP in catalytic amounts provides obvious advantages from the industrial and environmental point of views, considering that acylations of this substrate have up to now been carried out in pyridine, which involves problems of disposing of the residual solvent.<br>
The oxidation step (b) of the hydroxyl at the 13- position is carried out<br>
with manganese dioxide or bismuth dioxide or ozone in a solvent selected from acetonitrile, acetone or ethyl acetate/methylene chloride 9:1 mixtures, under vigorous stirring, preferably with ozone or manganese dioxide in acetonitrile or acetone. The reaction with ozone rapidly forms the derivative oxidised at the 13- position, while with Mn02 the reaction proceeds quickly to give the derivative oxidized at the 13- position which can be recovered from the reaction medium, whereas a longer reaction yields the 13- oxidised and 14- hydroxylated derivative.<br>
The subsequent carbonation step (c) of the hydroxyls at the 1- and 14-positions is usually effected with phosgene or in a methylene chloride/toluene mixture in the presence of pyridine. Subsequently, the resulting 1,14-carbonate derivative can be easily reduced at the 13- position to give the corresponding 13-hydroxy derivative (step (d)). Said reduction takes place regioselectively at the carbonyl at 13-, while the carbonyl at 9- remains unchanged. This reaction is usually carried out with sodium borohydride in methanol or tetrabutylammonium borohydride and provides high yields. The subsequent step (e) consists in deprotecting the hydroxyls at the 7- and 10-<br>
positions   to   give   14-hydroxy-l,14-carbonate   deacetylbaccatin   III.   The<br><br>
conditions and the reactants which can be used in the selective deprotection of the hydroxyls at 7- and 10- are described in Zheng et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 2001, and in Datta et al., J. Org. Chem., 1995, 60. 761.<br>
The selective acetylation at the 10- position (step (f)) is carried out with acetic anhydride in the presence of cerium, scandium, or ytterbium salts, preferably CeCl3.7H2O. Afterwards, the hydroxyl at the 7- position is protected by silylation (step (g)). The subsequent step (h) involves the condensation between 14(3-hydroxy-7-Tes-l,14-carbonate-baccatine III and (4S,5R)-N-Boc-2-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-isobutyl-l-oxazolidine-5-carboxylic acid. The latter is prepared as described in PCT WO 01/02407. The reaction is carried out in<br>
dry apolar organic solvents, in the presence of a base and of a condensation agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC).<br>
Finally, in step (i), the triethylsilyl group can be removed with pyridinium fluoride in acetonitrile/pyridine solution under nitrogen, whereas the dimethoxybenzylidene group can be removed in methylene chloride by addition of methanol HC1 and subsequently of NaHC03.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention in greater detail.<br>
Example I<br>
Preparation of 7.10-bistrichloroacetyl-lQ-desacetylbaccatine III.<br>
1st Alternative:<br>
4.77 ml of trichloroacetic anhydride (42.32 mmoles) were dropped into a solution of 10 g of 10-deacetylbaccatine III (18.4 mmoles) in 125 ml of dry methylene chloride and 42 ml of pyridine. The reaction mixture was kept under stirring for three hours or otherwise until completion of the reaction, which was monitored by TLC on silica gel using a n-hexane/ethyl acetate 1:1 mixture as eluent. Upon completion of the reaction, 5 ml of methanol were added to destroy the trichloroacetic anhydride excess and then water was<br>
added. The organic phase was thoroughly washed with water acidified with<br>
HC1 to remove pyridine, while the residual organic phase was dried over<br>
MgSO4 and concentrated to dryness under vacuum, to obtain a pale yellow solid (17 g) which after crystallization from chloroform has: [oi]D - 34° (CH2C12 C5.8) IR (KBr) 3517, 1771, 1728, 1240. 981, 819, 787, 675 cm-1;<br>

2nd Alternative:<br>
10-DAB III (10 g, 18.38 mmol) was suspended in CH2C12 (120 ml), DMAP (220 mg, 1.4 mmol, 0.1 eqv.) was added and the mixture was cooled to 0°C on ice bath. Then Et3N (10.26 ml, 73.6 mmol, 4 eqv.) and, immediately after, C13COC1 (4.12 ml, 36.8 mmol, 2 eqv.) were added under nitrogen stream in 5 min. keeping temperature below 10°C. After completion of the addition, the mixture was left under stirring on ice bath for 15 min, then the bath was removed and the mixture was stirred at r.t. for 1 h. After 1 h the reaction was monitored by TLC (AcOEt 2/«-hexane 3, Rf 10-DAB III = 0.05, Rf 7,10-bistrichloroacetyl -10-DAB III = 0.26) and C13CCOC1 (1 ml, 0.5 eqv.) was added. Stirring was maintained at r.t. for 10 min, then the mixture was poured into a beaker containing 160 g of triturated ice, stirring at r.t. until equilibrium (approx. Ih). After that, the aqueous phase was separated and extracted with CH2C12 (3 x 40 ml). The combined organic phases were washed with IN HC1 (20 ml), then with a NaHCO3 saturated solution (20 ml), dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent was evaporated off. Crude weight: 16.5 g. After crystallization from chloroform, IR, 1H-NMR and [α]D spectra were consistent with those of the compound obtained using pyridine and trichloroacetic anhydride.<br>
