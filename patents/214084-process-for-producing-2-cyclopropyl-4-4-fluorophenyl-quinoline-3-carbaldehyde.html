2<br>
resolution of racemate (1-1)-  C: Hydrolysis of ester (I-2) . D: Step for forming mebaronolactone (1-5) by subjecting free hydroxyl acid (1-4) to a dehydration reaction.<br>
In this process, an unnecessary antipodes (1-3) is obtained when ethyl (6E)3,5-dihydroxyl-7-[2~cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-quinoline-3-yl]-hepto-6-enoate (1-1) is subjected to optical resolution. Accordingly, it has been an important subject from the viewpoint of the production cost to effectively utilize this unnecessary anfcipode.. _<br>
JP-A-08-00313.8_discloses a process wherein this 'unnecessary antipode (1-3) is reacted with ozone, and the resulting ozonide (peroxide) is subjected to reducing treatment with dimethyl sulfide to obtain 2~cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-quinoline-3-carbaldehyde (formula (III)) which can be re-used as an intermediate for the synthesis of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.<br>
However, dimethyl sulfide used in this process has art^-indus trial problem due. to a specific unpleasant odor and a handling problem of a low flash point compound. Accordingly, this can not be regarded as an industrially advantageous reaction.<br>
