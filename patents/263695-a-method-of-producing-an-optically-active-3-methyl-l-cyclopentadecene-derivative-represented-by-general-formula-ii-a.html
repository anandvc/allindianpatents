				<td>DESCRIPTION <br>
METHOD OF PRODUCINGMACROCYCLIC KETONE, AND INTERMEDIATE THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a macrocyclic ketone muscone, in particular a method of producing muscone by 1,4-conjugation methyl-addition reaction of 2-cyclopentadecenone, and a new intermediate compound used in production thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently the trend toward natural products of people has been rising, and in the field of the fragrance, there also arouses an interest for a musk-feeling fragrance having a higher aroma property and characteristically reminding of natural environment. Further, there is also a need for development of a new fragrance material derived from a natural compound or the same as or similar to a natural compound, from the point of safety for human beings and the environment.<br>
Muscone is the principal fragrance component in natural musk and contained in the amount of 0 . 5 to 2 . 0% therein. Muscone was found out by Walbaum in 1906, and its chemical structure was determined by Ruzicka in 1926. Natural muscone is (-) - (R) -3-methylcyclopentadecanone, but its commercial product is a synthetic dl-isomer. When the fragrance of (-) - (R)-isomer and (+)-(S)-isomer is compared, the (R)-isomer has a diffusive<br><br>
stronger musk-feeling fragrance (threshold value : 3 ppm) , while the (S)-isomer has a chemical, less-diffusive, poor and weak musk-feeling fragrance (threshold value: 10 ppm) , and thus, the intensity of the fragrance of the (R) -isomer is known to be thrice greater than that of the (S)-isomer (see, for example, Non-patent Document 1 and Non-patent Document 2 below).<br>
Non-patent Document 1: Indo Motoichi, "Synthetic Aromachemical - Chemistry and Commodity knowledge ", The Chemical Daily, March 6, 1996, pp. 492 to 497.<br>
Non-patent Document 2: "Recently technology on Synthetic Aromachemical", CMC Publishing, 1982, pp. 72 to 90.<br>
For the reasons above, there have been many reports of the studies on the method of preparing muscone, in particular, (-) - (R)-muscone . Among them, a method of producing an optically active muscone by 1, 4-conjugation methyl-addition reaction of 2-cyclopentadecenone is considered to be promising, and there are recently some reports on the methods of preparing (-)-(R)-muscone in asymmetric methylation reaction using an optically active ligand. For example, it has been reported that it is possible to obtain favorable results by using a compound having an amino alcohol chiral auxiliary group containing a bornane skeleton inpreparation (see Non-patent Document 3below) . However, the reported method of producing the (-) -(R) -muscone by using a chiral auxiliary group is yet to be commercialized, because it has disadvantages of demanding an extremely low reaction temperature of -78°C, an extended reaction time, and use of a chiral auxiliary group in an excessive amount of one<br><br>
equivalence or more . In another example, there is a report that a particular chiral phosphite compound gave a favorable result when various chiral phosphite ligands were examined in a catalytic amount (see Non-patent Document 4 below). However, the reported method shows a yield of 53% even at an inefficiently low concentration at a solvent/substrate rate of approximately 50 and thus, is not desirable. In yet another example, described is high-yield production of muscone by using a copper complex of 4-(cis-2,6-dimethylpiperidine)-<br>
(R)-dinaphthodioxaphosphepin or 4-(R,R-2,5-diphenyl-pyrrolidine)-(R)-dinaphthodioxaphosphepin as a chiral ligand (see Patent Document 1 below), but the literature does not disclose the reaction at higher concentration. When the reaction is carried out at higher concentration, conventional methods cause a problem of poor yield of the objective product by generation of high-molecular weight by-products.  Further, the employment of an extreme reaction condition such as an extremely low temperature, a low concentration or an extended reaction period results in increase of a production cost.  Low reaction yield also leads to increase of a production cost. Therefore, there exists an urgent need for a method of producing muscone economically at high yield without employing a reaction condition such as an extremely low temperature, a low concentration, or an extended reaction period.<br>

An object of the present invention, which has been made under the circumstances above, is to provide a method of producing muscone at high yield by 1,4-conjugation methyl-addition reaction of 2-cyclopentadecenone under a practical condition without employing an reaction condition such as extremely low temperature or low concentration.<br>

Any common known solvolytic method for enol compounds may be used as the solvolytic method of the invention.  In the case of enol esters and enol carbonates, examples of the methods include a method of carrying out a reaction in a solvent in the presence of a basic catalyst. Examples of the basic catalyst used in this solvolysis include lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, lithium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, lithium alkoxides (such as lithiummethoxide, lithium ethoxide, and lithium tert-butoxide), sodium alkoxides (such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, and sodium tert-butoxide), and potassium alkoxides (such as potassium methoxide, potassium ethoxide, and potassium tert-butoxide).

The solvent used in solvolysis is not particularly limited if it is a solvent allowing progress of solvolysis, and examples thereof include water, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol, and themixed solvents thereof. Among the solvents above, methanol and ethanol are favorable because they are cheaper and have favorable flexibility in use, higher reaction selectivity and high yield.<br>

Thecosolvent is not particularly limited if it is inert to the reaction, and examples of such organic solvents include ether solvents such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, and dioxane; hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane, heptane and octane; and aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene, and xylene.<br>

by volume, preferably I to 30-times by volume, with respect to 1 part by mass of the 3-methyl-l-cyclopentadecene derivative (II) . The reaction is carried out at normally approximately 0 to 250°C, preferably approximately 20 to 100°C, normally approximately for 10 minutes to 20 hours, preferably approximately for 30 minutes to 10 hours, but these conditions may be altered properly according to the amount of the solvent and catalyst used.<br>
The objective product may be isolated as needed after reaction by common post-treatment such as distillation or column chromatography. The reaction may be carried out either batchwise or continuously in the invention.<br>
Solvolysis of the enol moiety in the 3-methyl-l-cyclopentadecene derivative represented by General Formula (II) has been described above in detail. And the catalyst, solvent, reaction condition and the like in solvolysis of the optically active 3-methyl-l-cyclopentadecene derivative represented by General Formula (II-a) are the same as those described above. Thus, it is possible to prepare optically active muscone represented by General Formula (I-a) by solvolysis of the optically active 3-methyl-l-cyclopentadecene derivative represented by General Formula (II-a) in a similar manner.<br>
In the reaction, the configuration of the 3-asymmetric carbon atom on the optically active muscone represented by Formula (I-a) retains that of the optically active 3-methyl-l-cyclopentadecene derivative represented by General Formula (II-a).  Thus, for example, when a (R)-3-methyl-l-cyclopentadecene derivative is used as the optically active 3-methyl-l-cyclopentadecene derivative represented by General Formula (II-a), (R)-muscone is obtained as muscone represented by Formula (I-a) in retaining an optical purity. The configuration of the optically active 3-methyl-l-cyclopentadecene derivative is controlled by that of the optically active ligand used in the reaction.<br>
