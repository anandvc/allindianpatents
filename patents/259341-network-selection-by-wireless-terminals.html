NETWORK SELECTION BY WIRELESS TERMINALS<br>
L        Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
10001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
Serial No. 60/780,391, entitled "NETWORK SELECTION BY WIRELESS TERMINALS/' filed March 7, 2006, assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
(0002)                     The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically<br>
to techniques for selecting a wireless communication network tor acquisition by a wireless terminal.<br>
II.	Background<br>
[0003]	Wireless communication networks are networks with wireless capabilities that<br>
enable wireless terminals to communicate without the use of cables or wires. Wireless networks are widely deployed to provide various communication services such as voice., video, packet data, messaging, broadcast, etc. These wireless networks may be wireless wide area networks (WWANs) such as cellular networks, wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs), and wireless local area networks (WLANs).<br>
[0004]	A. wireless terminal (e.g.. a cellular phone) may be able to receive service from<br>
one or more wireless networks. Upon power up. the terminal may search for a wireless network that is within range and from which the terminal may receive service. If such a wireless network is found, then the terminal may acquire the wireless network and attempt to register with the wireless network. During registration, the terminal may be authenticated and authorized for a requested service by the wireless network or possibly by a home network if the user is roaming. The terminal may then communicate with the wireless network to obtain the desired service, e.g., to originate or receive calls, to access email, to obtain Internet services, etc.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2007/103975<br><br>
PCT/US2007/063497<br><br>
[0005]	The terminal may not have any knowledge of its operating environment when it<br>
is first powered on and may not know which wireless networks, if any, can be acquired. Furthermore, the terminal may have a list of preferred networks whose selection by the terminal is preferred when the home network is not available, e.g., when the user is roaming or is temporarily not within the coverage of the home network. The wireless networks in the preferred list, may be selected based on business arrangements between the home network operator and other network operators, sen-ice offering, reliability and performance considerations, preferential tariffs, security and privacy considerations, etc.<br>
(0006)	At power up, the terminal may be within the coverage of zero or more wireless<br>
networks, which may or may not be in the preferred list. In this case, the terminal may search for an extended period of time in order to look for one of the preferred networks. The search may be more complex if the terminal supports multiple radio technologies and/or multiple frequency bands, since there may be more combination of radio technology and frequency band to search. During this search time, the user may not be able to originate or receive services such as voice calls, email, and short messages.<br>
(0007)	There is therefore a need in the an for techniques that allow a terminal to reduce<br>
the amount of time to acquire a wireless network, especially when the terminal has little or no prior knowledge of which networks may be available.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
(0008)	Techniques for efficiently  performing network selection  using information<br>
stored at a terminal are described herein. According to an aspect, an apparatus is described which includes a memory that stores coverage information for previously detected wireless networks and a processor that selects a wireless network, to attempt acquisition based on the stored coverage information. The coverage information may he given in various formats, as described below.<br>
(0009)	According to another aspect an apparatus is described which includes a memory<br>
that stores information for previously detected cells in wireless networks and a processor that obtains information for current location of a terminal and selects a wireless network to attempt acquisition based on the information for the current location and the stored information for the previously detected cells.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022]	FIG. 1 shows an example network environment 100 in which multiple wireless<br>
networks may be present.  In this example, four wireless networks 110a, 110b, 110c and<br>
110d are present and are denoted as networks A, B, C and D, respectively.  In general,<br>
each wireless network may have any coverage area, and the coverage areas of some or<br>
-4<br><br>
WO 2007/103975<br><br>
PCT/US2007/063497<br><br>
all wireless networks may overlap. In the example shown in FIG. 1, wireless networks A, B and C overlap in area 114, which "is shown with cross hashing.<br>
[0023]	En general, each wireless network 110 may implement any radio technology such<br>
as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA), Long Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA2000 IX, High Rate Packet Data (HRPD), IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.20, IEEE 802.11, Hiperlan, Flash-OFDM®, etc. GSM, W-CDMA, LTE, CDMA2000 1X, HRPD, and Flash-OFDM© are radio technologies for WWANs. W-CDMA is part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). CDMA2000 IX and HRPD are part of cdma2000, which is also referred to as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). IEEE 802.16 and IEEE 802.20 are two families of standards from The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for WMANs, with .IEEE 802.16 being commonly referred to as WiMAX. IEEE 802.1 ?. is another family of standards from the IEEE for WLANs and is commonly referred to as Wi-Fi. Hiperlan is another radio technology for WLANs.' These various radio technologies are known in the art.<br>
[0024]	In general, a wireless network may implement one or more radio technologies.<br>
For simplicity, the following description assumes that each wireless network implements one radio technology., even though multiple wireless networks of different radio technologies may be assigned the same network identifier and/or may be supported by a common set of base stations and/or by other common network elements. In an example that is used in some of the description below, network ilOa is a GSM network, network 110b is a UMTS network that may implement W-CDMA, network 110c is a CDMA network that may implement CDMA2000 1X or HRPD, and network 110d is an IEEE. 802.13 network. The IEEE 802.11 network may implement any standard in the IEEE 802.11 family of standards sucb as 802.IIa, 302.11b, 802.1 ig, 802.1 In, etc. In the description herein, "802.11" generically covers any standard in the IEEE 802.11 family of standards.<br>
[0025]	A multi-mode terminal 120 may be capable of communicating with wireless<br>
networks of different radio technologies. For example, terminal 120 may support GSM, W-CDMA, CDMA IX, HRPD, 802.11, etc., or any combination thereof. Terminal 120 may be stationary or mobile and may also be referred to as a user, equipment (UE), a mobile station, an access terminal, a mobile equipment, a subscriber unit, a station, etc.<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2007/103975<br><br>
PCT/US2007/063497<br><br><br>
Terminal 120 may be a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless device, a wireless modem, a handheld device, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, etc.<br>
[0026]	Terminal 120 may be located in area 114 and may be able to receive GSM<br>
network 110a: UMTS network 110b, and CDMA network 110c. However, terminal 120 may prefer to use UMTS over both GSM and GDMA, e.g., for better service and/or greater coverage. For terminal 120, there may be preferences for different network operators and their associated services. For example, the operator for network 110a may be preferred over the operator for network 110b. which may be preferred over the operator for network 110c. However, taking into account both radio technology and network operator preferences, terminal 120 may prefer UMTS network 110b over both GSM network 110a and CDMA network 110c, Terminal 120. may thus have a prioritized list of preferred network operator and technology combinations. In general a prioritized list may be formed on the basis of network operator preferences, radio technology preferences, both network operator and radio technology preferences, etc.<br>
[0027]	Terminal 120 may be able to receive multiple wireless networks of different<br>
radio technologies at a particular location. However, there may be only one or few-preferred network operators for terminal 120 among all of the available networks. Terminal 120 may perform a search in order to find a preferred network operator and/or a preferred radio technology. For the search, terminal 120 may tune its receiver to each frequency that might be used by a wireless network and determine whether any wireless network is operating on that frequency. For each frequency, terminal 120 may detect for a signal from a wireless network at that frequency, acquire timing and/or frequency of any detected signal, demodulate broadcast information from any acquired signal, identify the wireless network operator based on the broadcast information, and decide whether or not to select the wireless network. The network search for each radio technology may be performed in accordance with a procedure applicable for that radio technology.<br>
[0028]	Terminal 120 may have a list of preferred network operators or a list of preferred<br>
network operator-technology combinations. The entries in the preferred list may be prioritized to ensure that terminal 120 selects the home network operator when in range and, when roaming, selects certain other network operators that the home network operator may have business arrangements with and/or offer advantages to the home<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2007/103975<br><br>
PCTYUS2007/063497<br><br>
network operator and/or the terminal user. Terminal 120 then may perform a full search<br>
in order to identify all preferred network operators or all network operator-technology<br>
combinations that may be available at the current location. Terminal 120 may then<br>
select the most preferred network operator or network operator-technology combination<br>
for use.<br>
|0029]  	Terminal 120 may spend a long Time to acquire a preferred network, e.g., when<br>
the terminal is powered on at a new location (e.g., following a plane flight) or loses<br>
coverage (e.g., going through a long tunnel) and needs to re-acquire coverage at a<br>
different location. In many cases, the wireless network that terminal 120 used<br>
previously may not be available, and terminal 120 may have little or no knowledge of<br>
the networks available at the new location. Terminal 120 may perform a full search in<br>
order to detect all available networks. During the full search, the user may not be able<br>
to invoke or receive any services.<br>
(0030)	Terminal 120 may search for a preferred network at power up or upon loss of<br>
coverage. Terminal 120 may also search for a more preferred network when receiving<br>
service from either a less preferred network or a non-preferred network, which may<br>
have been selected initially because a more preferred network was not available at a<br>
previous location. It is desirable to quickly find a preferred network in all of these<br>
scenarios.<br>
[0031]	In an aspect, terminal 120 may store information for cells and/or wireless<br>
networks and may use the stored information to more quickly and efficiently perform<br>
network selection. Terminal 120 may store information forr only preferred networks, or<br>
any available networks, or preferred networks plus available networks wherever<br>
preferred networks are not available, or some other combination of networks. In the<br>
following description, a 'recorded" network is a wireless network that terminal 120 has<br>
stored information for, which may be used for network Selection. A recorded network<br>
may be a preferred network or an available network, which may have been previously<br>
detected or accessed by terminal 120.<br>
[0O32]	In general, terminal 120 may store any type of information for a given network.<br>
For example, terminal 120 may store information used to acquire the network such as, e.g., frequency band, frequency channel, radio technology, scrambling code, etc Terminal  120 may also store information regarding vhere the network might be<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2007/103975<br><br>
PCI7US2007/063497<br><br><br>
detected, the likelihood of detecting the network, etc. Terminal 120 may update the stored information as new networks are discovered and/or- as new coverage area or capabilities for the recorded networks are identified. Terminal 120 may be able to obtain a comprehensive database for cells and/or nenworks over time via the self-learning capability.<br>
[0033]	Terminal 120 may perform network selection at a particular time and maybe<br>
unaware of which wireless networks may be available, e.g. because terminal 120 has powered on at a new location. Terminal 120 may then search for a preferred network based on the stored information. For example, terminal 120 may search for preferred network operators or combinations of network operators andj radio technologies in a prioritized order. Terminal 120 may use the stored information to determine which frequency band(s) and radio technology to attempt acquisition for a given preferred network,<br>
[0034]	In one design, terminal 120 may store usage information for wireless networks<br>
previously accessed by the terminal. Terminal 120 may store information on the degree of usage (e.g., aggregate access time) for each frequency band and radio technology used by each recorded network and/or other network usage statistics. The usage information may be used to determine which networks are normally.available over a period of time. A higher degree of prior usage for a given, network may be indicative of greater likelihood of acquiring that network in the future. Terminal 120 may determine a search order based on the usage information and may search for one or more networks in frequency bands and radio technologies having higher levels of prior usage,<br>
[0035]	in another design, terminal 120 may more past availability information for<br>
networks previously detected but not accessed by the terminal. Terminal 120 may store information on the percentage of time and/or the number of times each network was detected and/or other availability statistics. Greater prior availability for a given network may be indicative of greater likelihood of detecting that network in the future.<br>
[0036]	In yet another design, terminal 120 may store coverage information for networks<br>
previously' detected by the terminal. The coverage information may indicate where these networks were detected previously by terminal 120 and may be provided in various formats. In a first scheme, the coverage information may comprise geographic description (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) of specific locations where each<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2007/103975<br><br>
PCT/US2007/063497<br><br><br>
network was detected. Terminal 120 may store information such as the identity of each network, radio technology and frequency information for each network, geographic description of the locations where each network was detected, etc. Terminal 120 may store network and coverage information for all locations in which the terminal has visited Alternatively, terminal 120 may store information for locations that may be spaced apart by at least some minimum distance (e.g., at least one kilometer), which may reduce the amount of coverage information to store. Terminal 120 may omit information for locations in which the terminal was present for only brief periods of time (e.g., when the terminal user was moving) in order to further reduce storage. For areas in which terminal 120 was present for extended periods of time (e.g., home, home neighborhood, work place, preferred shopping areas, homes of friends and relatives, etc.), terminal 120 may store information on a denser basis tor locations that may be more closely spaced together.<br>
[0037]	In a second scheme, the coverage information  may comprise geographic<br>
description of a visited coverage area where each network was previously detected by terminal 120. A visited coverage area of a network is a portion of the coverage area of the network that was visited by terminal 120. This scheme may allow terminal 120 to consolidate coverage infonnation for networks in order.to reduce both storage space and processing time to search through the stored information. The coverage information for a network may comprise location coordinates along the perimeter of the visited coverage area for that network. Alternatively, terminal 120 may approximate the visited coverage area with a geometric shape such as a circle, an ellipse, an n-sided polygon, etc. For example, the visited coverage area may be approximated with (i) a circle defined by a center and a radius or (ii) an ellipse defined by a center, the lengths of the minor and major axes, and the bearing of the major axis. Terminal. 120 may select an appropriate geometric shape and/or determine parameters of the selected geometric shape based on location coordinates obtained for the network. The coverage infonnation may also be given in other geographic shapes and formats.<br>
[0038]	Terminal 120 may store coverage information for recorded networks in various<br>
manners. Terminal 120 may store coverage information and associate detected networks to the coverage information. For example, terminal 120 may store different coverage areas (e.g., geographic shapes) and a set of networks detected in each coverage<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2007/103975<br><br>
PCT/US2007/063497<br><br>
area. The networks in the set associated with a particular coverage area may be given in an order of preference. A new coverage area may be defined whenever a different set of networks is detected in the area. Alternatively, terminal 120 may store a list of detected networks and the coverage area tor each network in the list. The coverage area for each network may be given by one or more geographic shapes, a set of location coordinates, etc. Terminal 120 may update the visited coverage area for each network as appropriate.<br>
[0039]	Terminal 120 may use the coverage information for the previously detected<br>
networks to efficiently perform network selection. Terminal 120 may determine its current location based on any positioning method, e.g., a standalone positioning method that is independent of wireless network support, such as Global Positioning System (GPS). For the first scheme, terminal 120 may determine the closest previously visited location for which stored information for networks is available. Terminal 120 may retrieve the stored information for the networks detected at ithis closest location and may search for these networks in a suitable order so that a preferred network may be found as quickly as possible. For the second scheme, terminal 120 may first determine its current location and then determine whether the current location is within the visited coverage area for any previously detected network. Terminal 120 may identify networks with coverage overlapping the current location and may search for these networks in a desired order.<br>
[0040]	Terminal  120 may also use information broadcast by wireless networks for<br>
network selection. For example, base stations (or access points) in a wireless network may broadcast their location coordinates. Terminal 120 may ascertain the locations of these base stations .based on the broadcast information. Terminal 120 may then ascertain its location based on the locations of all received base stations and may identify networks available at this location based on the stored information. Terminal 120 may also use the information broadcast by the base stations to assist with storing infonnation for networks detected at each location, e.g., if terminal 120 could not or preferred not to derive its location by other means due to cost or other reasons.<br>
[0041]	FIG.  2 shows a design of using stored information to expedite network<br>
selection. Table 1 lists some types of information that may be stored by terminal 120 for each network and provides a short description for each type of information.<br>

[O042]	Table 1 lists different types of information that may be stored for each network.<br>
Different and/or other types of information may also be stored. For example, terminal 120 may store only usage information, only past availability information, only coverage information, both usage and coverage information, etc.<br>
[0043]	The information in Table 1 may be maintained for a given network as fallows.<br>
The preference of the network may be given based on a scale of 1 to N, with 1 being the most preferred and N being the least preferred, where N may be any value. The preference may be defined by the home network operator and provisioned at terminal 120. The frequency information may indicate one or more frequency bands, one or more frequency channels, one or more broadcast channeis, etc., used by the wireless network and may be updated as new frequency bands and/or channels are discovered for the wireless network. Terminal 120 may use the radio technology and frequency information to search for the wireless network. The usage information may indicate how often the wireless network was accessed in the past and may be updated whenever the wireless network is selected for use. The past availability information may indicate how often the wireless network was detected in the past and may be updated whenever the wireless network is detected. The coverage information may convey the visited coverage area for the wireless network and may be updated whenever the terminal moves to a new area.<br>
[0044]	Terminal 120 may maintain a table for the stored information. In one design, the<br>
table may include an entry for each wireless network previously detected or accessed by terminal 120. A new entry may be added in the table when a new network is found by<br>

terminal 120. The entry for each network may include fields for ditTerent types of information, e.g., as shown in Table 1. Bach ftefd for each network may be updated as new information is gathered for that network.<br>
{0045}	In yet another design, terminal 120 may store information for cells as well as<br>
networks previously detected by the terminal. The term "cell" may refer to a base station (or an access point) and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. A base station coverage area may be partitioned into multiple smaller areas that may be referred to as sectors or cell-sectors. For simplicity, much of the following description assumes that networks are not sectorized and that cells are the smallest unit of coverage. The techniques described herein may also be used for sectorized networks in which sectors or cell-sectors are the smallest unit of coverage.<br>
[0046]	FIG. 3 shows an example network environment 300 in which terminal 120 may<br>
be within the coverage of multiple cells in multiple wireless networks. In this example, terminal 120 is within the coverage of cells 310a and 310b in UMTS network 110b and also cell 310c in CDMA network 110c. Cells 3.10a, 310b and 310c are also denoted as cells Bl, 82 and C.1, respectively, and are served by base stations 312a, 312b and 312c, respectively. Cells B1, B2 and C1 overlap in area 314, which is show;n with cross hashing in FIG. 3.<br>
[0047]	Terminal   120 may store identification information for celts detected at a<br>
particular location.. The identification information for each cell may be obtained from, and may be associated with, the transmission from a base station, an access point, a repeater, etc. The cell identification information may be globally unique identification and may be given in different formats for ditTerent radio technologies. For example, the identification information for a cell in GSM or UMTS may  comprise a mobile country code (MCC), a mobile network code (MNC), a location area code (LAC), and a cell identity (CI). The identification information for a sector in CDMA IX may comprise a system identification (SID), a network identification (NID), and a BaseID, which may be composed of a CELLID and a SECTOR ID. The identification information for a sector in HRPD may comprise a 128-bit subnet-ID. The identification information for an access point in an IEEE 802.11 network may comprise a Medium Access Control (MAC) address assigned to the access point and used to identify its coverage area. The globally unique identification for each cell may be broadcast by the base station and/or<br>

WO 2007/103975<br><br>
PCT/US2007/063497<br><br>
repeater serving that cell. Similarly, each access point may broadcast its MAC address in beacon frames. Terminal 120 may receive the globally unique identification for a given cell whenever the terminal comes within the coverage of the base station or repeater for that cell Terminal may. also receive the MAC address Of a given access point whenever the terminal comes within the coverage of that access point. The identification information for a given cell, sector, or access point may also be referred to as a global cell identity (G_ID).<br>
[0048]	Terminal 120 may also store other information for each detected cell    For<br>
example, for each detected cell, terminal 120 may store a network identity (network ID) for the wireless network to which the cell belongs if this network ID is not contained in or implied by the cell identification information, the preference or priority of the wireless network or the combination of network and radio technology, frequency information for the cell, radio technology used by the cell, etc. Terminal 120 .may store information for each detected cell only once, if possible, in order to reduce the amount of information to store for cells detected at different locations.<br>
(00491	For each detected cell terminal 120 may store information for other associated<br>
cells and/or networks that were also detected by terminal 120 within the visited coverage area of this cell. The stored information may include the radio technology and frequency information for each network, the preference or priority of the network, the identities of the associated cells, etc. Terminal 120 may also store signal strength information for cells and/or networks. For example, terminal 120 may flag cells with weak received signal strength and/or networks with weak received cells. The information may be collected and updated at all or some locations, on a continuous time basis or at discrete lime intervals, whenever cells are detected by terminal 120 or when the received signal strength for cells exceeds a particular threshold.<br>
[0050]	A cell may have a certain normalcoverage area in which its received signal<br>
strength will normally be high and in which the cell may be accessed in order to receive service from its associated network. The cell may also have an extended coverage area (e.g., an area surrounding the normal coverage area) in which the cell may be detected by terminal 120 but, due to lower signal strength, may not be able to effectively serve the terminal. In associating cells from different networks, terminal 120 may employ both the normal and extended coverage areas of each cell in order to increase the<br>

PCT/US2007/063497<br><br>
43-<br>
number of other ceils associated with that cell In this case, the signal strengths of the associated cells for a given cell may not always be high and, throughout the normal or extended coverage area of that given cell, the signal strength of an associated cell may be consistently high or consistently low or may vary between low and high values at different locations. Such signal strength information may also be stored for each cell associated with any given cell.<br>
[0051 ]	Terminal 120 may also store association between signal strengths for cells. For<br>
example, the signal strength or signal strength range for a given associated cell may be stored for any cell for locations at which the associated cell's signal strength is high (e.g., in the normal coverage area of the associated cell) and separately for other locations where the associated cell's signal strength is low (e.g., in the extended coverage area of the associated cell). Terminal 120 may later detect a"particular cell and obtain the cell's signal strength at its current location. Terminal 120 may then determine, based on both the cell identity and signal strength, which other cells may be acquired at its current location and which of these cells have higher signal strengths and thus will be more likely to be usable. Based on the preference order for the networks associated with the cells with higher signal strength, terminal 120 may attempt to acquire the cell with the highest network preference first and, if not acquired, may attempt to acquire other cells according to the network preference order.<br>
[0052]	The stored information for the cells and/or networks may be linked such that<br>
terminal 120 can quickly identify' all cells that might be received whenever a given cell is detected. For each detected cell (or access point), information for that detected cell and/or its "network may be linked to other cells and/or networks that might also be received. This linking of information may also reduce storage of duplicate information for cells and/or networks. If more than one cell in a given network can be detected at a particular location, then terminal 120 may store the strongest detected cell, or a set of strongest cells, or all detected cells together with an indication of their relative received signal strengths. The storage process may be repeated (e.g., at other locations) whenever changes are observed in the detected cells.<br>
[0053]	Terminal 120 may reduce storage of information by omitting cells that were<br>
detected for only short periods of time. Terminal 120 may move through an area when these cells were detected and may be less likely to return to these cells for any<br>

significant amount of time. Terminal 120 may also note cells found through an extensive search. For example, the user may power on terminal 120 when arriving at an airport, and an extensive search may be performed to acquire a preferred network. Terminal 120 may store more information in this case and may use this information to expedite network selection on the next visit to the same airport.<br>
(0054)	Terminal   120 may use the stored cell  information for network selection.<br>
Terminal 120 may revisit or come near a location where cells were previously detected and information was stored for these cells. Terminal. 120 may detect a cell at this location, receive and decode broadcast information from this detected cell, identify the detected cell based on the broadcast information, and determine other cells and networks (if any) associated with the detected cell and for which stored information is available. Terminal 120 may then determine a suitable order for searching for wireless networks indicated by the stored information as being available at this location. The search order may be determined based on the preferences or priorities of the wireless networks, as indicated by the stored information. Terminal 120 may then search for one wireless network at a time, starling with the most preferred network. For each wireless network, terminal 120 may search for any cell in the network or for specific cells identified by the stored information.<br>
[0055]	In the example shown in FIG. 3, terminal 120 may first detect cell B1 in network<br>
B while in area 314 and may determine that cells 82 and CI in networks B and C respectively, might also be received at this location based on the stored information linking cell Bl with cells B2 and CI. Terminal 120 may then determine the desired order for searching for networks B and C. Terminal 120 may attempt acquisition of network C first and may search for either any cell in network C (e.g., using the radio technology and frequency information stored for network C) or a specific cell Cl that is associated with the first detected cell Bl.<br>
[0036]	Terminal 120 may detect a given cell x in multiple locations and may store<br>
information associating cell x with multiple sets of other cells available at these locations and their networks. Terminal 120 may thereafter revisit one of these multiple locations and detect cell x first. Terminal 120 may then obtain the multiple sets of cells associated with the first detected cell x, combine these sets of cells and their networks, and   search   through   the   combined   cells   and/or  networks   in   a  desired   order.<br>
15-<br><br>
WO 2007/103975<br><br>
PCTYUS2007/063497<br><br><br>
Alternatively, terminal 120 may make use of information on signal strength for the ■ associated cells (if previously stored) and search for cells with the highest recorded signal strength, In yet another alternative, terminal 120 may detect one of the cells (cell y) associated with cell x. Terminal 120 may then obtain other cells associated with the second detected cell y and their networks from the stored information. Terminal 120 may then search first (or only) for cells or networks that are associated with both cells x and}-.<br>
[0057]	In general, terminal .120 may initially detect any number of cells, determine<br>
other cells associated with each detected cell and search first (or only) for cells or networks that are associated with all initially detected cells or the greatest number of initially detected cells. If multiple cells are initially detected, then terminal 120 may combine the information for the networks for all detected cells to determine a smaller or larger set of available networks from which to perform network selection. Terminal 120 may obtain (i) a larger set based on a union of the networks associated with the initially detected cells or (ii) a smaller set based on an intersection of these networks. Terminal 120 may also select networks more likely to be available based on other criteria, e.g., the received signal strength and recorded signal strength for these networks, usage information, past availability information, etc.<br>
[0058]	Tables 2 to 5 provide an example of cell information that may be stored by<br>
terminal 120. In this example, cells in three wireless networks were detected by terminal 120 while operating in a small area., The specific values in these tables are purely for illustrative purposes and may not correspond to any actual networks.<br>
[0059|	Table 2 stores information for the three wireless networks detected by terminal<br>
120, The information stored in Table 2 may be common for all cells in each network. In this example. Table 2 stores, for each network, an internal identifier (e.g.. A) for the network, an external global identity (e.g., MCC and MNC) assigned to the network, the preference of the network, the frequency band and radio technology used by the network, and a pointer to a network-specific table for that network. As an example, for network A, the MCC-MNC is 200-56, the preference is 1 (meaning network A is the most preferred network), the frequency band is 1900 MHz, the radio technology is GSM, and Table 3 stores the cell information for network A. Terminal 120 may create the internal network identifier in order to facilitate any layered reference to the<br>

information in Table 2. The external global identity for each network may be obtained from information broadcast by each cell in that network. The network-specific table for each network may store information for each cell previously detected in that network.<br>

[0060|	Tables 3, 4 and 5 store cell information for networks A, B and C". respectively.<br>
In this example, each table stores, for each cell, an internal identity (e.g., Al) tbr the cell an external identify for the cell, a frequency channel for the cell, the network to which the cell belongs, and internal identities of other cells in the same or other networks having overlapping covei'age with this cell. The internal cell identity may be used as a pointer to the table entry for the cell. The external identity of each cell maybe obtained from information broadcast by that cell. The frequency channel is indicative of the frequency used by the cell and may be given by an absolute radio frequency channel number (ARFCN) in GSM, an UTRA ARFCN (UARFCN) in W-CDMA. a channel number in CDMA, etc. Each table may also store other information that may be specific to a particular radio technology. For example, Tables 4 and 5 may store scrambling code information for W-CDMA and CDMA, respectively.<br>
[0061]	As an example, in Table 3, a cell with internal identity A1  was detected<br>
previously by terminal 120. The external identity of cell Al is given by a Location Area Code (LAC) of 230 and a Cell Identity (CI) of 120. Cell A2 broadcasts on channel 960 and belongs to network A. CeU Al is associated with cell A2 in network A and cell C2 in network C. The associated cells A2 and C2 may be detected by terminal 120 when within the coverage of cell Al.<br>

0062|	The network and cell information, in Tables 2 to 5 may also be stored in other<br>
.manners. For example, a single table may have one entry per cell, with each entry containing the internal and external cell identities, the externa! network identity, the frequency band and channel number, and the internal identities of the associated cells in other networks. This single table may contain all of the information in Tables 2 to 5.<br>
[0063|	Terminal 120 may use the network and cell information in Tables 2 to 5 for<br>
network selection as follows. Terminal 120 may be powered on and may first detect a cell with a LAC-CI value of 25-96 in a network with an MCC-MNC value of 200-49. Terminal 120 may scan the cell-related tables for any cell with the LAC-CI value of 25-96. in this example, terminal 120 may find this LAC-CI value for cell C3 in Table 5. Terminal 120 may then verify whether the detected MCC-MNC value of 200^19 matches the MCC-MNC value for network C to which cell CI. belongs.    In this<br>
-18-<br><br>
lYO 2007/103975<br><br>
PCT/US2007/063497<br><br><br>
example. Table 5 indicates that celll Cl belongs In network C, and Table 2 indicates that network C has an MCC-MNC value of 200-49, which matches the detected MCC-MNC value. Terminal 120 may thus confirm that the detected cell is indeed cell C3 and may discover from Table 5 that there are two associated cells A3 and B3 with overlapping coverage with cell C3.<br>
(0064)	By using Tables 2 and 5, terminal !20 may locate the networks for cells A3, B3<br>
and C3 and may then ascertain their network preferences. In this example, detected cell C3 belongs in network C with preference 3, while associated cells A3 and B3 belong in networks A and B with preferences 1 and "2, respectively. Since network A has the highest preference, terminal 120 may attempt to detect eel! A3 first. Tables 2 and 3 indicate that cell A3 is a GSM cell operating in the 1900 MHz band on channel 700 and assigned a LAC-CI value of 230-122. Terminal 120 may use this information to. quickly acquire cell A3 without laborious searching. If cell A3 is acquired, then terminal 120 may attempt to access network A via this cell. If cell A3 is not acquired, then terminal 120 may attempt to access cell B3 in network B, which has the next highest preference, if cell B3 is not successfully acquired, then terminal 120 may fall back to the initially detected cell C3 in network C. Terminal 120 may then know, based on the absence of other associated cells in Table 5 for cell C3, that there is no need to look for any other networks.<br>
[0065]	Terminal 120 and/or other terminals may send to a network operator (e.g., the<br>
serving or home network operator) information collected by these terminals using self-learning techniques and suitable for use for network selection. For example, .terminal 120 may send information for cells and/or networks previously detected in different geographic areas or locations, cells and/or networks associated with the detected cells, identities of detected cells and networks, frequencies and radio technologies used by detected networks, etc. Terminal 120 may accumulate information over some time period and send the information when appropriate. Terminal 120 may also send smaller amounts of information more frequently, e.g., information for cells and networks detected by terminal 120 at its current location. Terminal 120 may also send information when and as requested by the network operator, As a specific example, terminal 120 may send the information in Tables 2 to 5 to the network operator. The network operator may combine information received from different terminals in<br>

different locations to obtain more comprehensive information on cells and networks over a larger geographic area. The network operator may provide all or portions of this comprehensive information to individual terminals to assist with network selection.<br>
(0066]	A network operator (e.g., the serving or home network operator) may also<br>
provide information that may be used by terminal 120 for network selection. The provided information may be the same as, similar to, or more extensive, precise and reliable than the information collected by terminal 120 via the self-learning techniques. The provided information may improve network, selection in locations that terminal 120 has not previously visited or for which insufficient information was previously collected and stored. The provided information may be for cells and/or networks available in different geographic areas or locations, cells and/or networks associated with different cells, identities of cells and networks, frequencies and radio technologies used by networks, etc. The provided information may be given in the formats described above (e.g., as shown in Tables 2 to 5) or some other formats.<br>
[0067]	In one design, a network operator may provide information in the form of a base<br>
station almanac (BSA) that may support oilier capabilities such as positioning of .terminal 120. The BSA typically includes various types of information on base stations to support positioning and location services. For example, the BSA may provide, for each cell (or each base station), the geographic coordinates of a base station antenna used for that cell, the frequency band for the cell, the frequency and/or frequency hopping scheme used for broadcast and/or other channels sent by the cell, other cells in the same or other networks that may be detected within the cell, transmission timing or pilot phase differences between the cell and other cells detected within the cell etc. The broadcast channel may be acquired to obtain broadcast information that may be used to verify the identity of the cell, to make measurements for positioning, etc.<br>
[0068]	The BSA may be modified and/or extended to include information used to<br>
support network selection. The BSA may include information on cells (or base stations) available at different locations, associations between cells with overlapping coverage, identities and preferences of networks to assist with network selection, radio technology and frequency information to assist with acquisition, information to support positioning, etc. The BSA may also include information on other cells and/or networks that may be selected within the area covered by the ceils included in the BSA.<br>

the terminals within the coverage of that cell. A given cell may also send almanac information directly to a given terminal, e.g., when and as requested by the terminal. For example, almanac information may be provided to terminal 120 by a network operator (e.g., the serving or home network operator) and stored at terminal 120 for future use.<br>
(0070)	Almanac or other information used to assist with network selection may be<br>
extensive if covering all cells for all networks in a large geographic area, e.g., an entire country. The amount of almanac information to send and subsequently store may be reduced in various manners.<br>
(0071)	In one design, terminal 120 may receive only almanac information applicable for<br>
terminal 120, e.g., only almanac information for networks utilizing radio technologies and frequency bands supported by terminal 120. For example, terminal 120 may support GSM and W-CDMA and may receive only almanac information for networks utilizing GSM and W-CDMA and not for networks utilizing other radio technologies such as CDMA, IEEE 802.11, etc.<br>
[0072|	In another design, almanac information may be provided for individual cells<br>
within an area geographically close to terminal 120 and belonging to all or some networks with coverage in this area.<br>
[0073]	In another design, almanac information may be provided for groups of cells<br>
instead of individual cells. For example, almanac information may be provided for GSM location areas, which are explicitly defined and identified groups of ceils. Almanac information may also be provided for many or a\\ cells in a particular network (e.g., when these cells have the same or similar information) and may comprise a superset of information for all of these cells.<br>
[0074]	In yet another design, almanac information may be provided for networks (e.g.,<br>
preferred networks) over a large area (e.g., an entire country) and not in association with cells of other networks. The almanac information may include the radio technologies supported by each network, frequency information for each network, etc. The almanac information may also be reduced by providing information for only cells or groups of cells with coverage at locations where network selection may be difficult, e.g., at major airports.<br>

Terminal 120 may also send infonnation (e.g., more frequently) for only ceils detected at its current location. Terminal .120 may also send its location (or measurements used to determine its location) at which information was collected.
