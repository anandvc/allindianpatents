				<td>Method for locating and measuring deformations in a work of<br>
civil engineering<br>
The invention relates to process for locating and measuring<br>
deformations in a civil engineering structure.<br>
During the construction of motorways or railway lines, a great<br>
deal of civil engineering work is carried out to support the infrastructure of<br>
the road or track. But certain sites comprise unidentified natural or<br>
artificial cavities. In this case, unexpected subsidence may occur during<br>
the construction of the new road or track, or later during its operation,<br>
causing serious accidents due to the overloading of such fragile zones, the<br>
infiltration of water, drought and shaking.<br>
To avoid such accidents, it would be necessary to make<br>
systematic soundings of the site before carrying out the civil engineering<br>
work. Such soundings are indeed carried out in land normally subject to<br>
subsidence.<br>
Nevertheless, certain sites, not subject to natural landslide<br>
(rock slide) were, in former times, occupied by underground military<br>
installations, the existence of which is now unknown.<br>
Systematic soundings are very costly and, in addition, they<br>
have to be taken close to each other, under and in the vicinity the<br>
proposed road or track to guarantee absolute safety.<br>
Furthermore, even in the absence of cavities in the land, the<br>
soil may be subject to uneven settlement under certain sections the road<br>
or track following successive wet periods and drought, which may lead to<br>
ground subsidence, the amplitude of which is certainly limited, but affects<br>
safety particularly when it concerns tracks for high speed trains.<br>
In order to limit the risk of subsidence of infill (embankment), it<br>
is common practice to lay sheets (laps) or strips of woven or non woven<br>
geosynthetic fabric on the soil and in the infill, to stiffen the infill, in the<br>
event of subsidence in the soil. In this case, the threads (yarns) of the<br>
geosynthetic fabric are subject to considerable forces which lead to a<br>
deformation by elongation of the threads and which may cause them to<br>
break, hence the collapse of the infill.<br>
In order to detect deformations in a civil engineering structure,<br>
at pre-defined thresholds, FR 2 72 78 677 has suggested incorporating<br>
parallel threads in the geosynthetic fabric, which are capable of<br>
transmitting signals and calibrated to pre-determined elongation at break<br>
values. The deformation threshold attained is measured by sending signals<br>
through the threads and by detecting the presence or absence of response<br>
to such signals.<br>
The threads may be electrical wires or optical fibres. The<br>
measurement is taken by all or nothing, and location of the deformation at<br>
a pre-defined threshold is only possible by placing two sets of parallel<br>
threads perpendicular to each other.<br>
The purpose of the invention is to provide a process which<br>
provides for the location of the deformation on the one hand and, on the<br>
other, the measurement of the elongation of threads where the<br>
deformation occurs, before the threads break, using a geosynthetic fabric<br>
with a single set of threads, preferably laid parallel to the length of the<br>
structure.<br>
The invention achieves its purpose by the fact that at least one<br>
geosynthetic fabric fitted with a plurality of optical fibres in parallel,<br>
capable of transmitting signals is applied to the structure or under the<br>
structure, the said optical fibres comprising Bragg gratings, evenly spaced<br>
and distributed in a series of Nl consecutive gratings with the same<br>
wavelength, the said series being laid in identical sets, each of which has<br>
N2 consecutive series with different wavelengths, and by the fact that, in<br>
at least two optical fibres, the number Nl of gratings in a series and the<br>
number N2 of series in a set are determined in such a way that the<br>
measurement of differences between the wavelengths of the incident light<br>
transmitted to each of the said optical fibres and wavelengths of the light<br>
reflected by the Bragg gratings enable, on the one hand, to locate<br>
deformation of the structure and, on the other, to measure the elongation<br>
of the said optical fibres where the deformation occurs.<br>
The invention therefore uses the known properties of Bragg<br>
gratings used in strain gauges, as described in WO 86/01303, in particular.<br>
The Bragg gratings are placed at equal distance of each other<br>
in all the optical fibres, but the lengths of the series or sets are different<br>
for at least one pair of optical fibres to allow for the simple location of<br>
structural deformations by determining the wavelength of reflected light<br>
which has been distorted in relation to the corresponding wavelength of<br>
incident light; the amplitude of such distortions gives an indication of the<br>
amplitude of the elongation of the optical fibres in the location concerned.<br>
Advantageously, in at least two optical fibres, the numbers Nl of<br>
the gratings of a series are equal and the numbers N2 of series in a set<br>
are prime to each other.<br>
Therefore, for example, let us assume that the distance between<br>
two Bragg gratings is 1 metre, that the number Nl is 10, a series of<br>
gratings therefore extends over 10 metres. Let us also assume that the<br>
first fibre contains seven series per set and can therefore handle seven<br>
different frequencies, and that the second fibre contains ten series per set,<br>
the figures 10 and 7 being prime to each other. A set of the first fibre<br>
therefore extends over 70 metres, and the set of the second fibre extends<br>
over a length of 100 metres. These two fibres enable us to locate, with<br>
precision, a structure over a total length of 700 metres. If furthermore,<br>
the geosynthetic fabric contains a third optical fibre with Bragg gratings 1<br>
metre apart and in series of 10 consecutive Bragg gratings, and each set<br>
contains three series, the figure 3 being prime with 7 and 10, the three<br>
optical fibres enable us to locate with precision deformations in a structure<br>
of 2100 metres in length. The deformation is located to the nearest 10<br>
metres, which corresponds to the length of a series of 10 Bragg gratings.<br>
This level of precision is perfectly adequate for the monitoring of civil<br>
engineering structures.<br>
Obviously the rule for the distribution of Bragg gratings on two<br>
optical fibres may differ from that given above as an example.<br>
Therefore, for example, according to another distribution rule, in at<br>
least one optical fibre the number Nl of gratings in a series is equal to the<br>
number of gratings of a set in another optical fibre.<br>
For example, the first optical fibre contains a set of 10 series, and<br>
each series contains 100 identical Bragg gratings 1 metre apart. The<br>
second optical fibre contains sets of 10 series, and each series contains 10<br>
Bragg gratings 1 metre apart. These two optical fibres provide for the<br>
accurate location of a deformation in a structure 1 kilometre in length.<br>
The invention also relates to a geosynthetic fabric for the<br>
application of the process.<br>
According to the invention, this geosynthetic fabric is<br>
characterised by the fact that it contains a plurality of optical fibres in<br>
parallel, the said optical fibres containing Bragg gratings evenly spaced in<br>
series of Nl consecutive gratings that correspond to the same wavelength,<br>
the said series being themselves distributed in identical sets of N2<br>
consecutive series that correspond to different wavelengths.<br>
The optical fibres are advantageously inserted during<br>
production of the geosynthetic fabric. They should preferably be laid in the<br>
main direction of the sheet or lap, but may also be laid crosswise if<br>
necessary.<br>
Advantageously, the optical fibres include a sheath for<br>
protection against shear failure, due to aggressive agents in the soil, and<br>
against the influence of water with a high pH (contact with concrete) and<br>
other corrosive agents.<br>
Advantageously, optical fibres are laid in the direction of the<br>
length of the said geosynthetic fabric.<br>
Other advantages and characteristics of the invention shall be<br>
clarified on reading the description below given as an example and with<br>
reference to the drawings appended in which:<br>
figure 1 is a perspective view of a geosynthetic fabric with<br>
optical fibres containing Bragg gratings;<br>
figure 2 shows a first form of the distribution of Bragg gratings<br>
in identical sets of different series in two optical fibres; and<br>
figure 3 shows a second form of the distribution of Bragg<br>
gratings in identical sets of different sets in two optical fibres.<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a geosynthetic fabric 1 with<br>
optical fibres 2a to 2e containing the low reflectivity Bragg gratings 3 and<br>
designed to be used to reinforce a civil engineering structure, the infill of a<br>
motorway or railway line for example.<br>
The Bragg gratings 3 are evenly spaced along the optical fibres<br>
2a to 2b at a distance of 1 metre for example, and are distributed in series<br>
4 which include a number Nl of identical gratings 3; that is, capable of<br>
reflecting part of incident light with a clearly determined wavelength in the<br>
absence of stress and the wavelength of reflected light, which changes<br>
value according to the stress applied longitudinally on the corresponding<br>
optical fibre. In the example shown in figure 1, the series 4 of the five<br>
optical fibres 2a to 2b include the same number Nl of gratings 3 and<br>
therefore extend over the same length.<br>
Several consecutive series 4, which correspond to the different<br>
wavelengths making up a set 5 of gratings and is reproduced along the<br>
entire length of the fibres.<br>
At least two optical fibres in the geosynthetic fabric 1 include<br>
the sets 5 with the numbers N2 of different sets, and we can even<br>
produce a geosynthetic fabric 1 in which all the optical fibres 2a to 2e<br>
include sets 5 of Bragg gratings with numbers N2 of different sets.<br>
The numbers N2 are preferably prime to each other, to provide<br>
for the precise location of possible deformations of the geosynthetic<br>
fabric 1.<br>
The optical fibres 2a and 2b should preferably be laid in the<br>
direction of the length of the geosynthetic fibre 1 which is wound on to a<br>
tape reel, for transport.<br>
The optical fibres 2a to 2e are laid at a distance of 1 metre<br>
apart, for example. Once the geosynthetic fabric 1 is laid flat on the soil,<br>
the gratings 3 form a square mesh. But this mesh does not have to be<br>
square, without going beyond the scope of the invention. Nevertheless,<br>
this mesh should not be too wide, to allow for the detection of<br>
deformations above occasional subsidence of the roof of an underlying<br>
cavity with a small cross-section in the horizontal planes.<br>
The geosynthetic fabric 1 is usually approximately 5.5 metres<br>
wide, and if the width of the civil engineering structure to be reinforced<br>
is greater than that of the geosynthetic fabric 1, several strips of<br>
geosynthetic fabric are laid side by side. These strips may also be<br>
superimposed in the structure to be reinforced.<br>
To avoid the shear failure of the optical fibres 2a to 2b, failure<br>
due to aggressive agents in the soil for example, and to protect them<br>
against the influence of water, high pH values and other corrosive agents,<br>
the optical fibres 2a to 2e are placed in an appropriate protective sheath.<br>
The optical fibres 2a to 2b are connected at one end of the<br>
geosynthetic fabric to a control system 10 which includes means for<br>
transmitting light in the core of the optical fibres 2a to 2e, means for<br>
measuring the frequencies of the light reflected by the Bragg gratings 3,<br>
means for measuring the differences between the wavelengths<br>
of light reflected during operation and the wavelengths of light reflected,<br>
in the absence of stress, that is, during the construction of the structure,<br>
calculation means to indicate the location of possible<br>
deformation and the elongation of optical fibres due to structural<br>
deformations, means for the storage of data, means to display the results<br>
and, if necessary, warning means to give the alarm.<br>
In figures 2 and 3, we have given the references B, V, R, J, and<br>
M to the series 4 of gratings that correspond to pre-determined, different<br>
wavelengths.<br>
In figure 2, the optical fibre 2a contains the sets 5 containing<br>
five series with the references B, V, R, J, M and the optical fibre 2b<br>
contains the sets 5 containing four series with the references B, V, R, J.<br>
It should be noted that over a length of geosynthetic fabric that<br>
correspond to twenty series 4 of gratings 3, a deformation in a series, the<br>
fourteenth series from the left for example, shall be recognised by the<br>
control system 10 by the fact that the wavelength referenced J on the<br>
optical fibre 2a has shifted and the wavelength referenced V on the optical<br>
fibre 2b has shifted, and each combination of two wavelengths correspond<br>
to a precise position of series.<br>
In figure 3, the optical fibre 2b contains five series with the<br>
references B, V, R, J and M per set and the optical fibre 2a contains, for<br>
example, five series with the references B, V, R, J and M, but the length of<br>
each series of the optical fibre 2a is equal to the length of a set of the<br>
optical fibre 2b.<br>
Once again, each position of a series of the optical fibre 2b,<br>
from the left in figure 3, is identified precisely by the wavelength that<br>
corresponds to this series on the optical fibre 2b and the wavelength of<br>
the adjacent series on the optical fibre 2a, over a length of geosynthetic<br>
fabric that corresponds to twenty five series of the optical fibre 2b, and to<br>
a set of the optical fibre 2a.<br>
The control system 10 is used to locate and measure the local<br>
stresses to which the optical fibres 2a to 2c are subjected following any<br>
deformation of the structure during its operation, by reading the<br>
wavelengths of the light reflected by the Bragg gratings 3 directly in the<br>
range of deformations between 0 and 3 or 4 %, and to locate the level of<br>
deformation in the range between 3 or 4 % and the rupture of an optical<br>
fibre which is at a level of deformation close to 8 % or more, depending<br>
on the fibre used.<br>
Following the laying of the geosynthetic fabric 1 and the<br>
construction of the structure or underlying structure, an initial<br>
measurement is taken to define the reference status of the system. The<br>
location of each grating of an optical fibre is found by identifying the<br>
wavelengths of the gratings 3 of all the optical fibres 2a and 2b aligned in<br>
the direction of the width of the geosynthetic fabric 1.<br>
In the event of deformation which occurs after construction, the<br>
wavelengths of the light reflected by the Bragg gratings 3 where the<br>
deformation occurs are modified, whilst the wavelengths of the other<br>
Bragg gratings remain unchanged. We therefore obtain the location and<br>
measurement of the deformation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
