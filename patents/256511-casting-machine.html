				<td>Specification CASTING MACHINE Field of the Invention [0001]<br>
       The present invention relates to a casting machine having slide cores. Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Conventionally, a cylinder head for a motorcycle engine is made by a low pressure casting method, for example. JP-A-Hei 11-57979 discloses this type of low pressure casting machine. The casting machine disclosed in this patent document has: a die including a lower and an upper die; and a crucible disposed below the die; and is designed to pressurize molten metal reserved in the crucible to force it up through a stalk and a sprue cup to be supplied to a sprue of the lower die. [0003]<br>
       In this type of conventional casting machine, in the case that a casting is made having too complicated a shape to be formed only from the upper die and the lower die, slide cores are used as shown in FIGs. 6A and 6B.<br>
FIGs . 6A and 6B are plan views, each showing the structure of a conventional casting machine having four slide cores, in which reference numerals 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 denote a base for supporting a die assembly, a lower die, a slide core, an air cylinder for driving the slide core 3 and a guide post for limiting the moving direction of the slide core, respectively. [0004]<br>
       The lower die 2 is formed in a square shape in plan view and mounted on the base 1 through a support member (not shown) . The slide cores 3 are provided to surround the lower die 2 on all four sides and supported on the base 1 to be reciprocable between their die assembly clamping positions shown in FIG. 6A and die assembly opening positions shown in FIG. 6B. Each slide core 3 at its outside end face is connected to a piston rod 4a of the air cylinder 4.<br>
1<br><br>
The air cylinder 4 is disposed for each slide core 3 and mounted on the base 1 in a manner such that the movement of its cylinder body 4b is regulated. Disclosure of the Invention Problem to be Solved by the Invention [0005]<br>
       However, the casting machine with the slide cores 3 has the air cylinder 4 for driving the slide core arranged on each side of the die assembly, as described above. This results in a problem of size increase of the overall casting machine, requiring a larger space for installation. Particularly, in the case of arranging the plural die assemblies on the single base, their respective air cylinders are required between the die assemblies, resulting in a further increase in size of the casting machine.<br>
In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to reduce the size of the casting machine with the slide cores and thus to minimize the space required for installation of the casting machine. Means for Solving the Problem [0006]<br>
       The present invention provides a casting machine including: a base; a lower die fixed on the base; a first slide core and a second slide core located on the base to be moveable to oppose each other; an upper die to be clamped on the lower die and the first and second slide cores and forming a die assembly together therewith; and a cylinder for opening and closing the first slide core and the second slide core, the cylinder including: a cylinder body disposed on the base and outside of the first slide core and supported to be movable in an opening and closing direction of the first slide core with the axis of the cylinder body extending in a direction parallel to the opening and closing direction; and a piston rod connected to the first slide core, in which a connecting member for operatively connecting the second slide core to the cylinder body, and a stopper disposed on the base for regulating the<br>
2<br><br>
movement of the first slide core in the opening direction at a fully open position thereof are provided. Effect of the Invention<br>
[0007]<br>
       In the casting machine according to the present invention, when a cylinder extends, a first slide core and a second slide core move in die-clamping directions, and when the cylinder retracts, both slide cores move in die-opening directions. Thus, according to the present invention, since the first and second slide cores can be driven by the single cylinder located outside of the first slide core, no space for the cylinder is required outside of the second slide core, providing a more compact casting machine. Further, according to the present invention, since the two slide cores are driven by the single cylinder, the number of cylinders can be reduced.<br>
[0008]<br>
      According to the invention of Claim 2, a plurality of die assemblies are aligned with their respective second slide cores, outside of which no space for the cylinder is required, adjacent to each other. This can bring the die assemblies closer to each other, so that the plurality of die assemblies are provided within a small space. Therefore, according to this invention, the casting machine can be reduced in size, thereby minimizing a space for installation.<br>
[0009]<br>
      According to the invention of Claim 3, two third slide cores and two fourth slide cores can be driven by the two cylinders. Therefore, according to this invention, the number of cylinders can be reduced compared to when these slide cores are driven by their respective cylinders, and thus a space for installation of the casting machine can be reduced.<br>
[0010]<br>
      According to the invention of Claim 4, the number of upper-die drive units can be reduced compared to when the upper-die drive unit is disposed for each of the die assemblies, and thus a space for installation of the casting machine can<br>
3<br><br>
be reduced. Therefore, according to this invention, the casting machine can be made compact, though it has the plural die assemblies.<br>
According to the invention of Claim 5, the number of molten metal supply devices can be reduced compared to when the molten metal supply device is disposed for each of the die assemblies, and thus a space for installation of the casting machine can be reduced. Therefore, according to this invention, the casting machine can be made compact, though it has the plural die assemblies. Brief Description of Drawings [0011]<br>

      Now, an embodiment of this invention is described with reference to the drawings.<br>
       First, the structure of the casting machine according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference<br>
4<br><br>
to FIGs. 1 and 2.<br>
In FIGs. 1 and 2, reference numeral 11 denotes a casting machine according to the present invention. The casting machine 11 has a base 12 on which two die assemblies 13, 14 are disposed. The die assemblies 13, 14 each include a lower die 15 having a sguare shape in plan view and mounted on the base 12, four slide cores 16 through 19 provided to surround the lower die 15 on all four sides, and an upper die (not shown). [0013]<br>
When the slide cores 16 through 19 of the die assembly 13, 14 are clamped to the four sides of the lower die 15 (see FIG. 1) and then the upper die is clamped onto those die members, a cavity 20 is formed as an enclosed space. These two die assemblies 13, 14 are formed to be symmetrical in the lateral direction of FIGs. 1 and 2. Thus, in this embodiment, description will be made only of the die assembly 13 positioned on the left in FIG. 1, and similar parts of the die assembly 14 positioned on the right in FIG. 1 are denoted by the same reference numerals as with the left die assembly 13, and detailed description will not be repeated. [0014]<br>
The lower die 15 is formed with a sprue (not shown) vertically extending therethrough. Molten metal is supplied into the sprue from a crucible (not shown) provided below the base 12. Corner posts 21 are disposed at respective positions on the base 12 corresponding to four corners of the lower die 15, for limiting moving directions of the first through fourth slide cores 16 through 19, which will be described later, and positioning the upper die for die assembly clamping. [0015]<br>
       The four slide cores 16 through 19 are each movably fitted between the corner posts 21, 21 and supported on the base 12 to be reciprocable between its die assembly clamping position shown in FIG. 1 and die assembly opening position shown in FIG. 2. Also, the first through fourth slide cores 16-19 are each formed to come in tight contact with the adjacent slide cores<br>
5<br><br>
when the die assembly is clamped, as shown in FIG. 1. [0016]<br>
The first slide core 16 and the second slide core 17, of these four slide cores 16 through 19, which are laterally aligned to face each other in FIGs. 1 and 2 are connected to an opening/closing mechanism 22, which will be described later. The rest of these slide cores, the third slide core 18 and the fourth slide core 19, are respectively connected to piston rods 23a, 24a of a first and a second air cylinder 23, 24 provided outside of these slide cores, or on the forward side with respect to die assembly opening directions. [0017]<br>
        The first and second air cylinders 23, 24 are mounted on the base 12 with their axes extending parallel to an opening/closing direction of the third and fourth slide cores 18, 19 (vertical direction in FIGs. 1 and 2). The first and second air cylinders 23, 24 are also mounted with their piston rods 23a, 24a projecting from their cylinder bodies 23b, 24b toward the third and fourth slide cores 18, 19. More specifically, when the first and second air cylinders 23, 24 extend, the third and fourth slide cores 18, 19 are clamped (see FIG. 1) . On the other hand, when the air cylinders 23, 24 retract, the third and fourth slide cores 18, 19 are opened (see FIG. 2) .<br>
[0018]<br>
        The opening/closing mechanism 22 is designed to drive the first slide core 16 and the second slide core 17 through a third air cylinder 25 that is located outside of the first slide core 16, or on the forward side with respect to the die assembly opening direction. To be specific, the third air cylinder 25 is provided on the base 12 with its axis extending parallel to an opening/closing direction of the first and second slide cores 16, 17 (lateral direction in FIGs. 1 and 2). The third air cylinder 25 is also provided with its piston rod 25a projecting from its cylinder body 25b toward the first slide core 16. The piston rod 25a of the third air cylinder 25, at its projecting<br>
6<br><br>
end, is connected to the first slide core 16. The cylinder body 25b of the third air cylinder 25 is supported on the base 12 by a rail (not shown) to be movable in the opening/closing direction of the first and second slide cores 16, 17. [0019]<br>
       The cylinder body 25b of the third air cylinder 25 is connected to the second slide core 17 through a first connecting member 26, two tie bars 27, 27 and a second connecting member 28. The first connecting member 26 vertically extends in FIGs. 1 and 2. The tie bars 27, 27 extend from the ends of the first connecting member 26 toward the second slide core 17 parallel to the opening/closing direction of the first and second slide cores 16, 17. The second connecting member 28 connects the extended ends of the tie bars 27. In this embodiment, the first connecting member 26, the tie bars 27, and the second connecting member 28 define a connecting member in the invention of Claim 1.<br>
[0020]<br>
The tie bar 27 is a bar having a circular shape in section, with its ends inserted and supported through the guide posts 21 to be movable only in the axial direction. The tie bars 27 in accordance with this embodiment are disposed across the region above the moving ranges of the third and fourth slide cores 19 to prevent interference with the movement of the third and fourth slide cores 18, 19. [0021]<br>
       The vicinity of the guide posts 21 for supporting the tie bars 27 at their first connecting member 26 side ends is provided with stoppers 29 for regulating the movement of the first slide core 16 in its opening direction, at its fully open position. The stoppers 29 are adapted to regulate the movement of the first slide core 16 when its outside end face comes in contact with the stoppers, and mounted on the base 12 to project upward therefrom. Also, the stoppers 29 in accordance with this embodiment oppose the inside end face of the first connecting member 26, and are adapted to regulate the movement of the first<br>
7<br><br>
connecting member 26 in its die assembly opening direction (to the right in FIGs. 1 and 2), at its fully open position.<br>
[0022]<br>
       The die assembly 13 on the left side and the die assembly 14 on the right side in FIGs. 1 and 2 are mounted on the base 12 with their respective second slide cores 17 adjacent to each other. The distance between the die assemblies 13, 14 is large enough to prevent the second connecting members 28 of the die assemblies 13, 14 from interfering with each other when the second connecting members 28 move by the maximum amount for die assembly opening shown in FIG. 2.<br>
[0023]<br>
       In the casting machine 11 configured in such a manner, when the first through third air cylinders 23 through 25 retract from the position in the die assembly clamping state shown in FIG. 1, the first through fourth slide cores 16 through 19 are opened. On the other hand, when the first through third air cylinders 23 through 25 extend, the first through fourth slide cores 16 through 19 are clamped. To be specific, when the first air cylinder 23 retracts, the third slide core 18 moves upward in FIG. 1 to open, and when the second air cylinder 24 retracts, the fourth slide core 19 moves downward in FIG. 1 to open. Closing these third and fourth slide cores 18, 19 is achieved when the first and second air cylinders 23, 24 extend.<br>
[0024]<br>
       Meanwhile, in the casting machine 11, when the third air cylinder 25 retracts, the first slide core 16 moves to the left in FIG. 1 together with the piston rod 25a, and then comes in contact with the stoppers 29 at its fully open position. Thereafter, in the casting machine 1, the cylinder body 25b of the third air cylinder 25 moves to the right in FIG. 1. In such event, the second slide core 17 connected to the cylinder body 25b through the first and second connecting members 26, 28 and the tie bars 27, also moves in the same direction as the cylinder body 2 5b.<br>
[0025]<br>
8<br><br>
       When the third air cylinder 25 retracts and the second slide core 17 reaches its fully open position, the first connecting member 26 comes in contact with the stoppers 29, as shown in FIG. 2, and the second slide core 17 is restricted from moving any further in its opening direction and stops.<br>
       Closing these first and second slide cores 16, 17 is achieved when the third air cylinder 25 extends. More specifically, when the piston rod 25a of the third air cylinder 25 proceeds from the position in the state shown in FIG. 2, the first slide core 16 moves toward the lower die 15, and then comes in contact with the lower die 15 and stops at the contact position.<br>
[0026]<br>
Then, when the cylinder body 25b of the third air cylinder 25 moves in the direction of being separated from the lower die 15, the second slide core 17 on the side opposite the third air cylinder 25 with respect to the lower die 15 moves toward the lower die 15. Then, when the second slide core 17 comes in surface contact with the lower die 15, it is restricted from moving further in its closing direction and stops at the contact position (its die assembly clamping position). [0027]<br>
       In fact, the casting machine 11 configured in such a manner is made as shown in FIGs. 3 through 5. In FIGs. 3 through 5, like or equivalent components to those described with reference to FIGs. 1 and 2 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and detailed description will not be repeated as appropriate.<br>
       In the two die assemblies 13, 14 shown in FIGs. 3 through 5, the third slide cores 18, 18 are connected to each other by a third connecting member 31, and the fourth slide cores 19, 19 are connected to each other by a fourth connecting member 32. The third connecting member 31 is connected to the piston rod 23a of the first air cylinder 23, and the fourth connecting member 32 is connected to the piston rod 24a of the second air cylinder 24. The third connecting member 31 and the fourth connecting member 32 define a connecting member in the invention<br>
9<br><br>
of Claim 3.<br>
[0028]<br>
       More specifically, in this embodiment, the two third slide cores 18, 18 are driven by the single air cylinder (first air cylinder 23), and the two fourth slide cores 19, 19 are driven by the single air cylinder (second air cylinder 24) . A casting machine 11 having the structure to drive the two third slide cores 18, 18 by the single first air cylinder 23, and the two fourth slide cores 19, 19 by the single second air cylinder 24, as described above, defines a casting machine according to Claim 3. The employment of such structure can reduce the number of cylinders, compared to when the third and fourth slide cores 18, 19, a total of four slide cores, are driven by their respective air cylinders. Such structure can thus reduce a space for installation of the casting machine 11.<br>
[0029]<br>
       In such a manner, since the two third slide cores 18, 18 move together and the two fourth slide cores 19, 19 move together, guide posts 21 are disposed only at positions corresponding to four corners of the region where dies are formed, in this embodiment. Further, since there are provided the four guide posts 21, the tie bars 27 of the opening/closing mechanisms 22 are supported only at their first slide core 16 side ends by the guide posts 21 to be movable. In the left die assembly 13, one of the tie bars 27 in accordance with this embodiment is provided below the third slide core 18, and the other is provided above the fourth slide core 19.<br>
[0030]<br>
       On the other hand, one of the two tie bars 27 of the right die assembly 14 is provided above the third slide core 18, and the other is provided below the fourth slide core 19. The employment of such structure can prevent interference between the tie bars 27 of the die assembly 13 on the left side in FIGs. 3 and 4 at their second connecting member 28 side ends, and the tie bars 27 of the die assembly 14 on the right side in FIGs. 3 and 4 at their second connecting member 28 side ends. Also,<br>
10<br><br>
such structure can bring the second connecting members 28 of the die assemblies 13, 14 closer to each other. [0031]<br>
Further, the third air cylinders 25 in accordance with this embodiment are each fixed to a support member 34 which is supported on a base 12 through rails 33 to be movable. In FIGs. 3 and 4, components disposed near the first through fourth slide cores 16 through 19 and denoted by reference numeral 35 are guide rails for supporting these slide cores on the base 12 for free parallel movement. [0032]<br>
       The region below the base 12 on which the two die assemblies 13, 14 are mounted, is provided with a molten metal supply device 38 having a furnace 36 and a crucible 37, as shown in FIG. 5. The region above the base 12 is provided with upper dies 40,<br>
40	supported by a drive unit 39. In this embodiment, lower dies<br>
15, 15 are held by a support member 12a mounted on the base 12.<br>
[0033]<br>
       The furnace 36 includes a main unit 41 formed into a box shape with an upward opening; a lid 42 for covering this upward opening of the main unit 41; a crucible 37 for reserving the molten metal 43; a stalk 44 attached to the lid 42 with its lower end dipped in the molten metal 43; and the like. The main unit<br>
41	of the furnace 36 has a built-in heater (not shown) for heating<br>
the molten metal 43 in the crucible 37 to a predetermined<br>
temperature, and connects to a pressurization device (not shown) .<br>
The pressurization device supplies inert gas into the main body<br>
41 to force the molten metal 43 up into the stalks 44 for casting.<br>
[0034]<br>
       This embodiment uses a configuration such that the molten metal 43 is supplied from the single crucible 37 to the two die assemblies 13, 14. To be specific, in the casting machine 11 in accordance with this embodiment, the lower dies 15 are held by the support member 12a mounted on the base 12. The lower dies 15 each have a sprue 45 (see FIG. 5) connected to a sprue cup 46 which is supported by the support member 12a, and to the<br>
11<br><br>
stalk 44 through the sprue cup 46. The stalk 44 and the sprue cup 46 are disposed for each sprue 45 (for each of the die assemblies 13, 14) . The two stalks 44 are dipped in the common crucible 37, at their lower ends. [0035]<br>
Meanwhile, the drive unit 39 disposed above the base 12 has tie bars 51 extending upward from four corner portions of the base 12, and a platen 52 held partway along the tie bars 51 to move upward and downward. The platen 52 supports the upper die 40 of the die assembly 13 on the left side in FIGs . 3 through 5 and the upper die 40 of the die assembly 14 on the right side in FIGs. 3 through 5, and moves up and down by means of a motor (not shown) . The upper dies 40 shown in FIG. 5 are illustrated with castings W attached, which are released from the lower dies 15 along with the upper dies 40 after casting is completed and the die assemblies are opened. [0036]<br>
       In the casting machine 11 configured as described above, the first slide core 16 and the second slide core 17 can be driven by the third air cylinder 25 positioned outside of the first slide core 16. In the casting machine 11, therefore, no space for air cylinder is required outside of the second slide core 17. Although another die assembly is provided in such a space outside of the second slide core in this embodiment, in the case that the casting machine is made to have only a single die assembly, size reduction can be effected correspondingly to such space, compared to the conventional casting machine.<br>
As shown in this embodiment, the plural die assemblies are disposed in a manner such that their respective second slide cores 17, outaide of which no space for the cylinder is required, are disposed next to each other. Thus, the die assemblies can be arranged adjacent to each other, and the plural die assemblies 13, 14 can be provided side by side within a small space. [0037]<br>
       The casting machine 11 shown in FIGs. 3 through 5 uses a configuration to cause the single upper-die drive unit 39 to<br>
12<br><br>
move up and down the upper dies 40 of the plural die assemblies 13, 14 on the base 12. This can reduce the number of upper-die drive units compared to when the upper-die drive unit is disposed for each of the die assemblies 13, 14, and thus reduce a space for installation of the casting machine 11. Therefore, when the structure of this casting machine 11 is employed, the casting machine can be made compact, though it has the plural die assemblies.<br>
[0038]<br>
       Further, the casting machine 11 shown in FIGs . 3 through 5 uses a configuration to supply molten metal from the single molten metal supply device 38 to the plural die assemblies 13, 14 on the base 12. Therefore, in the casting machine 11, the number of molten metal supply devices can be reduced compared to when the molten metal supply device is disposed for each of the die assemblies 13, 14, and thus a space for installation of the casting machine 11 can be reduced. Therefore, when the structure of this casting machine 11 is employed, the casting machine can be made compact, though it has the plural die assemblies.<br>
[0039]<br>
In the foregoing casting machine 11, the two slide cores<br>
(first slide core 16 and second slide core 17) can be driven<br>
by the single air cylinder (third air cylinder 25) . Therefore,<br>
in the casting machine 11, the number of air cylinders can be<br>
reduced compared to when the air cylinder is provided for each<br>
slide core. Thus, in the casting machine 11, the number of parts<br>
can be reduced since the molten metal supply device 11 and the<br>
upper-die drive unit 39 are used in common between the two die<br>
assemblies 13, 14, effecting cost reduction.<br>
[0040]<br>
       Incidentally, apart from the embodiment shown in FIGs. 3 through 5, such configuration is possible that four die assemblies as shown in FIGs. 1 and 2 are disposed on the base 12 in a shape of a square with a cross inside as viewed in plan. In this case, the third and fourth slide cores 18, 19 can be<br>
13<br><br>
driven by the first and second air cylinders 23, 24 using the same driving method as with the first and second slide cores 16, 17. To be more specific, two groups of die assemblies, each consisting of the two die assemblies 13, 14 laterally aligned in FIGs . 1 and 2 are lined up in the vertical direction of FIGs . 1 and 2 so that the four die assemblies are provided,on the base<br>
12 in a shape of a square with a cross inside in plan view. When<br>
the die assemblies are thus disposed, the two die assemblies<br>
13 on the left side in FIGs. 1 and 2 are aligned in the vertical<br>
direction of FIGs. 1 and 2, and the other two die assemblies<br>
14 are aligned in the vertical direction of FIGs. 1 and 2.<br>
[0041]<br>
Of the four die assemblies 13, 14 aligned in such manner, the die assemblies 13, 14 configuring the group of die assemblies located on the top side of the shape of a square with a cross inside, each have the first air cylinder 23 supported on the base 12 to be movable in its axial direction. The cylinder body 23b of the first air cylinder 23 is operatively connected to the fourth slide core 19 through connecting members. Stoppers for stopping the third slide core 18 at its fully open position are also provided on the base 12 when this configuration is employed. Using this configuration allows the first air cylinder 23 to drive the third and fourth slide cores 18, 19, so that the second air cylinder 24 is not required. [0042]<br>
       On the other hand, the die assemblies 13, 14 of the group of die assemblies located on the bottom side of the shape of a square with a cross inside, are formed to be vertically symmetrical with the die assemblies 13, 14 on the top side. More specifically, in each of these die assemblies 13, 14 of the group of die assemblies on the bottom side, the third and fourth slide cores 18, 19 can be driven by the second air cylinder 24, so that the first air cylinder 23 is not required.<br>
       Such configuration can reduce the distance between the two groups of die assemblies, so that the four die assemblies 13, 14 are provided while size reduction of the casting machine is<br>
14<br><br>
effected.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[0043]<br>
      The present invention can be applied to a casting machine for casing parts, such as cylinder heads of vehicle engines, marine engines or other general-purpose engines.<br>
