Conference Call Facility<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
The invention tektea to the provision of a confietence call facility and it particulsrry snitabk fox, but not limited to, establishing conference calls between mobile telephone users via a wireless communication network.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Communication systems often provide conference call facilities, allowing a telephone call to be shared by three or mote users* In one known system, a first user, or host, calls a conference call facility to request a confietence, specifying a date and time fox the conference calL A telephone number is then allocated to the conference and communicated to the host for distribution to the other participants. At the appointed time, the participants dial the telephone number to join the conference. The participants may also be given a password, so that access to the conference is restricted to users selected by the host<br>
EP-A-1164774 discloses a system in which a conference call can be initiated by the sending of a suitable SMS to a server at a preset telephone number, with invitees being notified by SMSs sent from the server. The conference call can be joined by the invitees dislhng a telephone number included in the body of the SMS invitations. However, it has been found that it is not necessarily • simple matter for an invitee to dial into the conference call Also, it is relatively easy for invitees not to receive invitation SMSs immediately, which can prevent them joining the conference call or joining it at an appropriate time.<br>
Summery Of The Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of establishing a conference call, comprising: receiving a request at a conference call service provider from a first communication terminal, the request comprising one or more identifiers relating to a plurality of other communication terminals; and in response to the request, allocating a conference call channel, associating an identifier with the conference call channel and sending a message from the<br><br>
conference call service provider to said other communication terminals, each message containing the conference call channel identifier as die message originator^<br>
The other communication trrminals then receive a message identifying the conference call channel as the originator of the message, e.g. by its telephone number. Using this invention, cost and convenience benefits can be experienced by the user of the first communication terminal. This allows the othet communication fr^fWMi^fo easy access to the conference caU.<br>
This may be done by including an identifier, such as the telephone number associated with the conference call channel, in a header of the message so that, where a recipient of the message is equipped with a suitable ^r^ir-'r^+fT^fi terminal, the recipient can join the conference call using a short-cut defined in the communication terminal, reducing the number of keystrokes necessary for the recipient to access the conference call<br>
The method may comprise subsequently tniftafing from the conference call service provider a telephone caU to each of said other communication terminals. This is convenient in some circumstances, since it provides increased certainty that all, or roost, of the participants will be joined in the conference call at an appropriate time.<br>
Furthermore, the provision of security procedures is facilitated aa acceaa to the conference call can be limited to users of communication *»—«—i» identified in the request For example, an identifier, such as a Calling Line Identification (GLI) associated with a communication terminal determined to be attempting to acceaa the conference call channel may be compared with a list of identifiers associated with communication terminals that §tc allowed access to the conference caU, where access is permitted only if the identifier associated with said communication terminal corresponds to an identifier on said list If the identifier of a communication terminal attempting to access the conference caU is withheld or is otherwise non-determinable, a message can be sent to all communication terminals identified in the request that hare not yet joined the conference to notify them that access can only be granted if this information is provided.<br><br>
Preferably, one ox both of the request and the message ate in the form of a text message, such at a Short Message Service (SMS) message. This allows the inclusion of further text in die request, for example a short message explaining the subject of the conference call The text may dien be included in the message sent to the participants. If one or both of the request and the message is a multimedia message, image, video and/or audio data can also be used to explain the conference call or matters surrounding it<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided apparatus for providing a conference call facility comprising: a receiver for receiving a request from a first communication ♦*rmh«1u said request containing one or more identifiers relating to a plurality of other communication terminals; an allocator for allocating a conference csU channel and associating an identifier with the conference call channel in response to the request; and a message generator for preparing and sending a message to said other communication terminals, each message containing an indication that the message originates from the conference call channel.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of restricting access to a conference caU channel, comprising: compiling a Bat of identifiers associated with cornmunication terminals to be joined on a conference call; determining whether an identifier associated with a first communication terminal attempting to access the conference call channel corresponds to an identifier on the list; allowing access to the conference call channel if the identifier of the first communication terminal corresponds to an identifier on said fist; and disallowing access to the conference caU channel if the identifier of the first cornmunication trwnmal does not correspond to any of the identifiers on the list wherein, if the identifier of the first communication terminal is withheld or is otherwise non^eterminable, a message is sent to all cormxninication terminals associated with identifiers on said list that have not accessed the conference caU channel.<br><br>
By using an identifies associated with a communication terminal attempting to join the conference call, the provision of acceaa codes or passwords to the conference participants becomes unnecessary, which may result in increased convenience for users and/ or improved security. Hie identifier is preferably a telephone number* which may be determined from a CLI.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided apparatus for restricting access to a conference call channel, comprising: a compiler configured to compile a hat of identifiers associated with communication terminals to be joined on a conference call; a determiner configured to determine whether an identifier of a first communication terminal attempting to access die conference call channel corresponds to an identifier on the list; an access grantor configured to allow acceaa to a conference call channel if the identifier of the first communication terminal corresponds to an identifier on said list and to disallow acceaa to the conference call channel if the identifier of the first communication frBrminal doea not correspond to any of the identifiers on the hat; and a message generator configured to prepare and send a message to aU communication terminals associated widb identifiers on the Hat that are not connected to die conference channel if the identifier of the first communication terminal has been withheld or is otherwise non-detetminable<br>
The invitation messages do not need to contain me conference call channel identifier as die message originator, since the conference call channel identifier can be communicated instead<br>
The invention also provides a communication system composing any of the above apparatus.<br>

Description Of The Embodiments<br>
A commnntcatiofl system is shown in Figure 1, comprising a conference call server 1 and a network 2, which may comprise plural interconnected networks. The network 2 comprises at least one Mobile Switching Centre (MSC) and at least one Short Message Service Centre (SMSC), as well as the other usual components of a mobile telephone network, none of which are shown*<br>
The conference call server 1 provides communicadon channrls for conference calls between a plurality of communication terminals, which, in this trample, are mobile telephones 3a-3d. The conference call server 1 is arranged such that it is perceived by the network 2 as a self-contained mobile network with a single Global Tide and Point Code.<br>
A user of a communication terminal 3a wishing to set up a conference call makes a request 4 using a Short Message Service (SMS) message, shown in Figures 1 and 2. The request 4 contains a bat o£ the telephone numbers 5, 6,7 of other participants to be invited to take part in the conference caUL This list may be followed by optional text 8, e.g. text identifying the subject of the conference. The optional text is separated from the list of telephone numbers by a # symbol. The header of the request 4 includes a field identifying die sender of the message, as is conventional<br><br>
with SMS messages. In this esse, the field contains die telephone number of die mobile telephone 3a from which the request 4 was sent<br>
The xequest 4 is addressed to a telephone number that has previously been allocated for allowing access to the conference call facility. The request 4 is iH—^tfrt to an MSC associated with the network 2, where it is acknowledged in a wen-known manner and forwarded to the conference call server 1, since the network 2 perceives the conference call facility telephone number as belonging to the conference call server 1.<br>
A procedure for preparing a conference call will now be described, with reference to Figure 3, beginning at step s3.0. The request is received (step s3.1) and checked for exxots. If these are no fatal errors, the request is acted on as follows.    The conference call server 1 reserves a conference call channel and other resources necessary for hosting the conference call (step s3.2). This is achieved using a database held on the conference call server 1 or on a separate computer (not shown), selecting a -virtual telephone number from a pool of available telephone numbers and assigning it to the conference cafl.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the conference call server 1 compiles a list of the  . telephone numbers 5,6,7 of the conference participants (amp s33) from the information provided in the request 4. The conference call server 1 includes in the list die telephone number of the mobile telephone 4 from which the request 4 was sent. The list may be subsequently used to help prevent unauthorised access to the conference csJL<br>
The conference call server 1 subsequently generates an SMS message for the user of die communication terminal 3a, confirming that die conference has been created and notifying the user of the assigned telephone number. To achieve this, a message header is generated (step s3.4), a field in which indicates the source of the message. This field is set to indicate the telephone number of the conference call channel as the source of the message. The message body then is provided with the virtual telephone number assigned to the conference call, along widi any optional<br><br>
text 8 included in the request 4 (steps s3.5, s3.6, sS.7). The confirmation message is then sent to the mobile telephone 5a that sent the request (step s3.8) and is shown at 9 in Figure 1.<br>
The conference call server 1 then generates invitation messages inviting the remaining participants to job the conference calL Headers of these invitation messages are generated such that the field indicating the source of die message contains the telephone number of the conference call channel (step s3.9). Bodies of the invitation messages contain the telephone number of the conference call channel, text indicating that die message is an invitation to join a conference call and any optional text 8 extracted from die request (steps s3.10, s3.11» s3.12). The invitation messages are then sent to the mobile telephones 3b-3d (step s3.13) and are shown at lOa-lOc in Figure 1.<br>
The confirmation and invitation messages 9, lOa-JOe are sent directly from the conference call server 1 to the mobile telephones 3a-3d. If any of the messages are not delivered successfully, the conference call server 1 may make further attempts to send the messages for a limited period.<br>
The preparation of die conference call is then complete (step *3.14).<br>
As die headers of the confirmation message 9 and invitation messages lOa-IOc show the conference call channel as the sender of the message 9,10a-10c, a recipient may be able access the conference using a short-cut defined on their mobile telephone 3a-3d. Pot example, many mobile telephones currently available are configured to call the sender of a message if the user presses a "caff* button twice when the message is displayed.<br>
A procedure for connecting a caller to a conference call according is shown in Figure 4, beginning at step s4.0. When an incoming call directed to the conference call channel is received (step s4.1)t because a caller has dialled the telephone number assigned to the conference call, the conference call server 1 checks whether the conference is full (step s4.2). The conference call is full if die number of<br><br>
telephone! connected to die conference call channel already exceeds the number of invitation messages lOa-lOc sent by die conference call server, to allow for the number of invitees plus the user who sent the request 4, ox, where s list of telephone numbers of participants has been compiled (step 3 J), the number of entries in that liat. If the confetence call is roll, the incoming caller is refused access (step s4.3) and an error message is sent to the caller (step s4.4). If the conference call is not foil, the caller is connected (step s4.5) and, if required, a welcome message is played to the caller. If the caller is the first to join the conference (step s4.6), a further recorded message is played (step s4.7) asking the caller to wait for other participants to join the conference calL<br>
The connection procedure is then complete (step s4.8). The same procedure is followed in respect of each caller who dials the telephone number assigned to the conference calL<br>
When die conference call has been completed and the users have been disconnected, the conference call channel and the virtual telephone number assigned to it are returned to the pool Any further attempts to send confirmation and/ or invitation messages 9, lOs-lOc are stopped at this time.<br>
In order to reduce the likelihood that an uninvited caller may dial the assigned virtual telephone number and be connected to the conference call, the number of virtual telephone numbers in die pool may be considerably larger than the number of available conference caE channr.lt. Alternative, or additional, security measures may be implemented. For example, the confirmation and alert messages 9, lOa-lOc can include passwords ox codes that a user must provide in order to access the conference cafl.<br>
Where a liat of the telephone numbers of the conference participants has been compiled (step s3.3), it is possible to use this list and an identifier of a caller dialling the telephone number assigned to the conference call, such as the callers CLI, to determine whether to allow them access to the conference call. An alternative<br><br>
procedure for connecting a caller to a conference, including this procedure, it shown in Figure 5.<br>
Beginning at atep s5.0, a call to the conference call channel it received at the conference call server 1 (step t5.1). The conference call aerrer 1 determine* whether the caller's GLI it available (step s5.2). If ao, the conference call server 1 compares the caller's GLI with the telephone numbers on the hat (atep t53). If the caller's GLI corresponds to one of the telephone numbers listed, the caller it connected to the conference call (atep 5.4). A welcome message may be played to the caller at this point. If the caller if the first to join die conference (atep s5.5)» a recorded message is played, asking them to wait for other participants to be connected (atep a5.6).<br>
If the caller's GLI does not correspond to an entry on the list (step tSJ3)t they are refused access to the conference call (step s5.7) and the caller is not connected thereto.<br>
If the caller's GLI is not available (step s5.2), for example if the CLI hat been withheld by the caller, acceaa to the conference call it refuted (step a5.8). A further text message may then be aent to all the mobile telephones 3a-3d identified on the list who hare yet to join the conference reminding them that their CLI should not be withheld (step s5.9). A user receiving this message may then enable the CLI feature on their mobile telephone before dialling, or re-dialling,, the conference call number.<br>
The connection procedure ia then complete (step s5.10).<br>
An example of a suitable conference call server t is shown schematically in Figure 6. The conference call server 1 comprises an input interface tt for receiving data from an external source and an output interface 12. A processor 13 monitors and controls operations. A memory facility 14 ia provided for storing application software and, optionally, a database relating to the conference caU channels and virtual telephone numbers provided by the conference call facility. An access<br><br>
processor 15 determine* whether to allow the caller aoceat to a conference call, by determining whether the conference it fall as in the procedure of Figure 4 or by extracting CT..T information from incoming calls and using this information according to the procedure of FignreS. Requests 4 are f orwarded to a request handler 16, which compiles the list of conference participants, if required, and reserves the conference caD channel and virtual telephone number. A message generator 17 prepares and sends confirmation and invitation messages 9, lOa-lOc A data bus 18 provides a communication path between these components 11-17. The conference call server 1 may be implemented on a conventional server apparatus.<br>
A suitable mobile telephone 3a Is shown schematically in Figure 1. The mobile telephone comprises an antenna 19, a transceiver 20, a receiver 21 and a controller 22. A user interface 23 comprises a keypad 24 and a display 25. A microphone 26 and speaker 27 are provided* together with associated amplifiers 28,29. The mobile telephone 3a alao includes other conventional features of mobile telephone handsets, but these are omitted from Figure 7 for the sake of clarity.<br>
The confirmation message 9 and invitation messages lOa-lOc may be identical and may not require separate generation processes. Alternatively, different invitation mesaages lOa-lOc may be aent to the conference perttdpattta. In a further embodiment of the invention, the user requesting the conference call may not receive a confirmation message 9, but instead be dialled directly by the conference call server 1. The confirmation 9 and/ or invitation messages lOa-lOc as well as the request 4 may not be SMS mesaages and may take another form of text message, such as multimedia messages (MMSs), e-mails or instant messages. Alternatively, the confirmation 9 and/ or invitation messages 10s-10c may take the form of a voice message. The reqoeat may alternatively be made through a website. For example, a website associated wins the conference call server 1, or even running in the same server apparatus, could allow entry of data in a number of separate fields. Such fields could be; the name of the call organiser, the mobile telephone numbet of the call organiser, a description (for example the subject of the proposed conference caD), and a number of fields for the telephone numbers of the invitees.<br><br>
Once these fields ate fiUed-in end en "OK* button selected, die date is sent as a request messtge to die computet hosting the website, and from there onto die conference call server 1 if this is located in separate apparatus.<br>
The conmmnicstion terminals may be identified by, for example, an IP address, an MSZSDN ox other identification instead of, or as well ma, telephone numbers and CLXs.   The communication tmnmals may also be identified as a group, for example using a group IP address or a group of telephone numbers defined in a user's communication terminal 3s- In one example, a user can predetermine a group and store the telephone numbers of the members of the group on the conference call server 1 together with an identifier, e.g. "sales team". The members of the group may then be invited to join a conference call by the sending of a request including the identifier, which is then understood by the conference call server 1 to require a conference call including all the members of the group.<br>
In one embodiment, MMS is used for the request Here, the MMS request comprises a number of parts, namely text (comprising at least the telephone numbers of d&amp;e proposed recipients), an audio clip and an image. The image can relate to the user of the *»»mw*«1 Sa setting up the conference call, and can for example be a photograph of the user. Modem mobile telephones often include digital cameras, so this can be relatively easy to achieve. Aswell as or instead of a still image, the request may include a video clip. The audio dip and/or any video dip can be pre-recorded, or can be recorded immediately before creation of the MMS request.<br>
The conference call server 1 acts on the MMS request similarly to the SMS request of the embodiment described above. In particular, the conference call server extracts the telephone numbers of the participants to be invited. The conference call server 1 then generates invitation messages inviting the remaining participants to Join the conference calL Headers of these invitation MMSs axe generated such that the field indicating the source of the message contains the telephone number of the conference call channel The body of each invitation MMS comprises a text section including die telephone number of the conference call channel, text<br><br>
indicating that the message is an invitation to join a conference call and any other text extracted from the request MMS. The body alto includes the image and the audio clip included in the request MMS. The invitation MMSa ate men scat to the mobile telephones 3b-3d, as with the messages lOa-lOe in Figure 1. This allows additional prompts to be delivered to invitees to the conference call The image might remind the invitee who the call initiator is. The audio dip mar be able to include more information, for example about the subject and content of die proposed conference call, than could be included in an SMS because of the length limitations associated with SMSs.   Additionally, this can be more convenient, since it is usually easier and quicker to record a message than to type it using a keypad of a mobile telephone.<br>
The confirmation measage 9 need not be an MMS, and could be an SMS or other type of message. The server 1 may have to distinguish between different mobile telephone types, and send MMSs to those capable of handling MMSs and send SMSs to the other telephones.<br>
This embodiment can be envisaged as an extended version of die method shown in Figure 3. Here, steps s3.6 and S3.7 also include attaching an audio clip and/or an image to the MMS request. Steps s3.11 and S3.12 also include attaching any audio clip and image to die invitation MMS. Of course, it may not be necessary to include both an audio clip and an image in a request MMS or an invitation MMS, and MMS handling applications in mobile telephones do not usually require both to be included.<br>
In a further embodiment; the conference call server 1 sends a different type of invitation message to the participants to the calL Briefly, die conference call server 1 sends invitation messages which comprise a notification of a conference call, and indicate when the call i* to take place. The invitation messages do not necessarily need to include an identifier by which the conference call number can be dialled, since the conference call server 1 calls all the participants at the scheduled time. This allows increased certainty that participants to the caU will be Joined, since it eliminates die possibility of delay in the delivery of invitation messages having the<br><br>
result of preventing an invitee receiving the invitation message at a suitable time. Also, it is more difficult for an invitee to ignore an incoming call than it is to ignore an SMS, MMS» e-mail or the Eke.<br>
This embodiment will now be described with reference to Figure 8.    A communication system is shown m Figure 8, comprising a conference call server 29 and a network 30, which includes all the usual components of a mobile telephone network, none of which are shown.<br>
The conference call server 29 provides communication channels for conference calls between a plurality of communication terminals, which in this example are mobile telephones 31 and 32a-32c. The conference call server 29 is arranged such that it is perceived by the network 2 as a self-contained mobile network with a single Global Title and Point Code.<br>
A user of the communication terminal 31 wishing to set up a conference call makes a request 33 using an SMS, MMS or other message* The request 33 contains a Ust of the telephone numbers of other participants to be invited to take part in the conference cau\ or alternatively a group identifier, and optionally additional text, imagers) and/or audio. The request also identifies the time at which the conference call is to take place. This may be either through the specifying of a time (and optionally a date) or alternatively through the specifying of period before the call is to commence. The header of the request 33 includes a field identifying the telephone number of the sender 31.<br>
The request 33 is addressed to a telephone number that has previously been allocated for allowing access to the conference call facility. The request 33 is forwarded to the conference call server 29 by the network 30.<br>
The request is handled substantially as shown in and described with reference to Figure 3, except that it is not necessary to include in a confirmation 34 or in invitation messages 35a to 35c any virtual telephone number assigned to the<br><br>
conference call The conference call server 29 also determines the time at which die conference caD is to take place, by calculating when any period expires if necessary.<br>
The confirmation and invitation messages 34,35a-35c prepared by the server 29 indicate die time when the conference caU is to commence. The confirmation and invitation messages 34, 35a-35c ate sent directly from die conference call server 29 to tbe mobile telephones 31,32a-32c.<br>
If die confirmation and invitation messages 34,35a-35c ate sent some time before tbe conference call is to take place, reminder messages (also indicated at 34 and 35a-35c) are sent at one or more suitable times between the sending of the ccwfionetion and invitation messages and the time of the conference caU. Fox nnrniple, the conference caQ server 29 can be arranged to send separate reminder messages 54, 35a-35c at two hours, one hour and ten minutes before tbe conference call time. These reminder messages 34, 35a«35c may be die same as the confirmation and invitation messages 34, 35*-35c, almough preferably mey indicate that they are reminder or subsequent messages, to minimise the chances that a recipient could think the message relates to a different conference caU<br>
One or more of the messages 34,35a-35c sent to each of the mobile telephones 31 and 32a-32c includes the virtual telephone number allocated to the conference call as die originator of the message. This ensures that each of the intended participants in the conference call has knowledge of the telephone number which needs to be dialled to access die caU should they become cut-off, or should they not be accessible or available when the conference call commences. AdVantageously, only tbe last message 34, 35a*35c sent to each of the mobile telephones 31 and 32a-32c includes the access telephone number of the conference calL This provides a more secure solution than one in which the conference caU access telephone number is made available to the participants in the conference caD earlier, since h results in a shorter period of time in which an unauthorised person could illegitimately obtain the conference caU access telephone number and attempt to access die conference caU covertly. However, die conference call access telephone numbex can be sent to<br><br>
die mobile telephones 31 end 32e-32c in one or mote earlier messages 34,3Sa-35c if<br>
such levels of security are not required.<br>
■<br>
If any of the messages ate not delivered successfully, the conference call server 29 may make further attempts to send the messages for a limited period.<br>
At the allotted time, the conference caD server 29 dials the telephone numbers of all the participants to the caD, including the invitees 32a-32e and the initiator 31, and joint all the calls together, thereby completing the creation of the conference calL Here, it is unnecessary to check that those attempting to access a conference call are authorised.<br>
If any participant is unavailable when the conference call server 29 dials the participants to the call (for example because there is insufficient signal strength to maintain a network connection), they can access the call by using the call number facility on their mobile telephone 31 and 32a-32c from the last-received SMS or other invitation message 34, 35a-35c which was received. In this case, the conference caD server 29 examines the CLI of any person dialling into the conference caO and ensures that they are legitimate before allowing access.<br>
The conference call server 29 can be the same as that shown in Figure 6, except that the access processor 15 is supplemented with a participant dialler, or initiator, which dials the invitees 32a-32c and the initiator 31 at the allotted time. The conference call server 29 may be implemented on a conventional server apparatus.<br>
The conference caD server 29 may additionally be provided with means for deducting a charge for the calls to the participants from a pre-paid account, or for bilhng the charge to a suitable entity.<br>
In another embodiment, trie conference call servers 1 and 29 are combined into a single server. Here, conference calls can be dealt with as in the Figure 1 embodiment or in the Figure 8 embodiment in dependence on the telephone number which was used to access the service, ie. the telephone number to which<br><br>
die request 4 or 33 was addressed. Furthermore, ft different access number can be allocated for conference calls relating to different individuals ox organisations, providing ft tool useful fox billing and other account related purposes.<br>
The embodiments described are merely examples shoving how the invention may be implemented. The invention is not limited to ate with mobile telephones tad mobile telephone networks and may be used to provide conference call services to other types of communication tirrmitisls, tuch as so-called landEne or wired<br>
telephones, personal computers and any other device equipped with voice<br>
