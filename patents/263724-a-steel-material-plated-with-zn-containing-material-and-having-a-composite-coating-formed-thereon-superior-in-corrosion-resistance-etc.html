				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPOSITE COATED ZINC-CONTAINING PLATED STEEL MATERIAL SUPERIOR IN CORROSION RESISTANCE, BLACKENING RESISTANCE, COATING ADHESION, AND ALKALI RESISTANCE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a composite coated plated steel material comprised of a plated steel material used unpainted or painted and given superior corrosion resistance, blackening resistance, coating adhesion, and alkali resistance. More particularly, the present invention relates to a completely chrome-free composite coated zinc-containing plated steel material imparting superior corrosion resistance, blackening resistance, coating adhesion, and alkali resistance to a shaped article made using a zinc-containing plated steel, for example, a shaped article used for a roof, wall, or other building member or a member of an automobile, machine, household electrical appliance, etc., or a sheet coil.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Zinc-containing plated steel materials and other plated steel materials are being widely used as building materials and members of automobiles, household electrical appliances, etc. due to the high corrosion preventing function of the plating layer metal. However, in plated steel materials, the phenomenon sometimes arises of oxidation due to the salts and other electrolytes contained in the air and the oxygen and moisture present in high temperature, humid environments and consequent formation of white rust and corrosion. Further, in certain environments of a high temperature and humidity, the phenomenon arises of the plated steel material discoloring and appearing to be black. Both these phenomena are due to the deterioration of the plating layer metal and are sometimes considered a<br><br>
problem from the viewpoint of quality and aesthetics when the material is assembled into the above various products.<br>
Further, even when used painted, the penetration of oxygen or moisture sometimes leads to the peeling of the paint film due to the formation or buildup of corrosion products at the plating layer under the paint film. Sometimes a problem is caused in terms of aesthetics and practical use.<br>
Further, sometimes a plated steel material is cleaned by an alkaline degreasing agent after being shaped. In this case, if the material is not durable against alkali, it will discolor or will end up corroding early during use.<br>
As means for preventing such corrosion, blackening, or paint peeling of plated steel materials, in the past the surfaces have been treated by various techniques bringing chrome-containing treatment solutions, such as chromic acid-chromate or phosphoric acid-chromate solutions, into contact with the surfaces of the plated steel materials. By forming what is generally called a "reaction type chromate coating" on the surface of a plated steel material, the above problems are avoided. The chromate coatings obtained by these treatments are mainly comprised of trivalent chrome. While the amount of leaching of the particularly toxic hexavalent chrome is small, the corrosion prevention property cannot be said to be sufficient. In particular, when the damage to a coating due to shaping or scratches reaching the base iron is large, the plated steel material drops in corrosion resistance.<br>
On the other hand, in coating type chromate treatment where a treatment solution containing hexavalent chrome is coated by a roll coater etc. on a material and dried, the coating formed will contain a large amount of hexavalent chrome. Therefore, even if the chromate coating is damaged due to being worked or<br><br>
scratches etc., the material will have superior corrosion resistance, but sometimes hexavalent chrome will leach out from the chromate coating. Chromate treatment coatings containing hexavalent chrome have a detrimental effect on the human body upon buildup due to their toxicity. As explained above, the coating easily leaches out by nature. Therefore, there can be said to be the problem in terms of environmental protection of the environmental load substances moving outside the system.<br>
In this way, the chromate treatment performed on plated steel materials in the past for the purpose of preventing the formation of white rust is becoming an issue in terms of safety and environmental impact due to the hexavalent chrome. To solve this problem, technology for replacing chromate treatment has been studied.<br>
As a publication describing art replacing chromate by coating a chromate-free treatment solution on the surface of a plated steel material, JP 2002-332574 A may be mentioned. This publication proposes the art of coating a treatment solution containing zirconium carbonate complex ions and vanadyl ions, dimercaptosuccinic acid, etc. and heating it to dry to form a coating of a dense three-dimensional structure and obtain a superior corrosion resistance due to the high ability of adsorption on the surface metal. Further, JP 2002-030460 A describes metal surface treatment agents containing a vanadium compound and a compound containing at least one metal selected from zirconium, titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, and cerium and metal surface-treated metal materials. Further, JP No. 2004-183015 A describes metal surface treatment agents containing a vanadium compound and a metal compound containing at least one metal selected from cobalt, nickel, zinc, magnesium, aluminum, etc. and metal surface-treated materials.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
However, each chromate replacement technology is<br><br>
insufficient in the corrosion resistance, blackening resistance, and coating adhesion. This is the problem to be solved by the present invention.<br>
The inventors engaged in in-depth studies on means for solving the above problem and as a result discovered that by using an aqueous solution of a specific composition to treat a zinc-containing plated steel material, a composite coated zinc-containing plated steel material having superior corrosion resistance, blackening resistance, coating adhesion, and alkali resistance can be obtained and thereby completed the present invention.<br>
That is, the present invention relates to a composite coated zinc-containing plated steel material superior in corrosion resistance, blackening resistance, coating adhesion, and alkali resistance characterized by having a composite coating formed by coating and drying on the surface of a plated steel material a treatment solution containing a basic zirconium compound, vanadyl (VO2+)-containing compound, phosphoric acid compound, cobalt compound, organic acid, and water and having a pH7 to 14, the composite coating containing, with respect to the Zr element as 100 mass%, V in an amount of 10 to 45 mass%, P in 5 to 100 mass%, Co in 0.1 to 20 mass%, and an organic acid in 10 to 90 mass%.<br>
In the present invention, preferably the composite coating has a total coating mass of 50 to 2000 mg/m2. Having a total coating mass of 100 to 1500 mg/m2 is particularly preferable since it improves the corrosion resistance, blackening resistance, coating adhesion, and alkali resistance.<br>
The composite coated zinc-containing plated steel material according to the present invention has extremely superior performance in each of the corrosion resistance, blackening resistance, coating adhesion, and alkali resistance, so the present invention is an invention having extremely great significance industrially.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br>
The composite coating in the present invention is formed from a pH7 to 14 treatment solution containing a basic zirconium compound, vanadyl (VO2+)-containing compound, phosphoric acid compound, cobalt compound, organic acid, and water.<br>
The basic zirconium compound is a compound supplying the Zr element in the composite coating. The basic zirconium compound is not particularly limited, but for example it may be a zirconium carbonate compound having a cation comprised of [Zr (CO3) 2 (OH) 2]2-or [Zr (CO3) 3 (OH) ]3- or an ammonium salt, potassium salt, sodium salt, etc. containing the cation.<br>
The vanadyl (VO2+)-containing compound is a compound supplying the V element in the composite coating. The vanadyl (VO2+) -containing compound is not particularly limited, but for example may be a salt between oxovanadium cation and hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, or other inorganic acid anion or formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, oxalic acid, or other organic acid anion. Alternately, a chelate of an organic acid and vanadyl compound, such as vanadyl glycolate, vanadyl dehydroascorbate, may be used.<br>
The composite coating contains the element of V in an amount, with respect to Zr as 100 mass%, of 10 to 45 mass%. If V is less than 10 mass%, the corrosion resistance and the alkali resistance may drop. When V is greater than 45 mass%, the blackening resistance and coating adhesion fall. The amount of V in the composite coating is, with respect to Zr as 100 mass%, preferably 15 to 30 mass%, more preferably 20 to 25 mass%.<br>
The phosphoric acid compound is a compound supplying the P element in the composite coating. The phosphoric acid compound is not particularly limited, but may be phosphoric acid and its ammonium salts etc. More specifically, for example, orthophosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, polyphosphoric<br><br>
acid, phytic acid, phosphonic acid, ammonium phosphate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, diammonium hydrogen phosphate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, etc. may be mentioned .<br>
The composite coating contains the element of P in an amount, with respect to Zr as 100 mass%, of 5 to 100 mass%. If P is less than 5 mass%, the corrosion resistance falls, while if greater than 100 mass%, the blackening resistance, coating adhesion, and alkali resistance fall. The amount of P in the composite coating is, with respect to Zr as 100 mass%, preferably 10 to 70 mass%, more preferably 10 to 40 mass%, particularly preferably 12 to 20 mass%.<br>
The cobalt compound is a compound supplying the Co element in the composite coating. The cobalt compound is not particularly limited, but for example may be cobalt carbonate, cobalt nitrate, cobalt sulfate, cobalt acetate, etc.<br>
The composite coating contains the element of Co in an amount, with respect to Zr as 100 mass%, of 0.1 to 20 mass%. If Co is less than 0.1 mass%, the blackening resistance falls, while if Co is greater than 20 mass%, the corrosion resistance, alkali resistance, and coating adhesion fall. In particular, as the effect of the cobalt, this is believed to promote the deactivation of the surface of the plated steel material at the time of formation of the coating and serve to protect the material from water, oxygen, and other external factors. The amount of Co in the composite coating is, with respect to Zr as 100 mass%, preferably 0.5 to 10 mass%, more preferably 0.5 to 5 mass%, particularly preferably 0.8 to 1.5 mass%.<br>
The composite coating in the present invention also contains an organic acid. The organic acid is not particularly limited, but for example glycolic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid, dehydrobenzoic acid,<br><br>
dehydroascorbic acid, gallic acid, tannic acid, and phytic acid may be mentioned. In some cases, ammonium salts of these organic acids may also be used.<br>
The composite coating contains an organic acid in an amount, with respect to Zr as 100 mass%, of 10 to 90 mass%. When the amount of the organic acid is less than 10 mass% with respect to Zr as 100 mass%, the corrosion resistance and the coating adhesion end up deteriorating somewhat. Further, when the treatment solution contains only a little organic acid, the storability of the treatment solution ends up falling. In other words, the organic acid forms a complex with the vanadyl (VO2+) -containing compound, basic zirconium compound, and phosphoric acid compound and thereby can maintain the stability of the treatment solution (aqueous solution) for forming the composite coating. If the composite coating contains the organic acid in an amount, with respect to Zr as 100 mass%, of more than 90 mass%, the coating adhesion and the alkali resistance fall. The amount of the organic acid in the composite coating is, with respect to Zr as 100 mass%, preferably 10 to 70 mass%, more preferably 10 to 50 mass%, particularly preferably 15 to 30 mass%.<br>
The composite coated zinc-containing plated steel material of the present invention can be produced by coating the surface of a plated steel material with an aqueous solution containing amounts of the basic zirconium compound, vanadyl (VO2+)-containing compound, phosphoric acid compound, cobalt compound, and organic acid for supplying the composite coating with the Zr, V, P, and Co elements and organic acid in the above ratios, then heating this to dry and thereby form a coating.<br>
The treatment solution preferably has a pH7 to 14. In this pH range, the basic zirconium compound can be made to stably dissolve in water. As the pH of the treatment solution, 8 to 11 is preferable, while 8 to 10 is particularly preferable. When the pH of the treatment<br><br>
solution has to be adjusted, as the pH adjuster, the substances shown next may be used. For example, ammonia water, triethylamine, triethanolamine, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid, carbonic acid, ammonium fluoride, etc. may be mentioned, but the pH adjuster is not particularly limited so long as it does not remarkably reduce the stability of the treatment solution.<br>
The coating formed becomes a composite coating having a dense three-dimensional structure, superior in barrier property, and improved in corrosion resistance. One reason why such a composite coating is formed is that the organic acid and metal ions become aligned by formation of a complex, a dense three-dimensional structure is formed mainly by Zr-0,  V, organic acid, P, and Co become mixed in the clearances (between mesh structures), and zinc etc. introduced due to etching of the plating surface are introduced. Note that in a dense three-dimensional structure using Zr-0, part of the Zr may be substituted by another element. Further, by etching the plating surface by an organic acid when forming the composite coating, the adhesion at the interface of the coating and plating surface is increased and the corrosion resistance and coating adhesion are improved.<br>
The plated steel material on whose surface the composite coating is formed is not particularly limited so long as the plating layer contains zinc. For example, it is possible to use a plated steel material provided with a plating layer comprised of zinc and unavoidable impurities. Alternatively, it is possible to use a plated steel material provided with a plating layer containing, in addition to zinc (and unavoidable impurities), alloy ingredients with zinc, such as Al, Mg, Si, Ti, Ni, and Fe. A particularly preferable plating layer is one containing, in addition to zinc (and unavoidable impurities), one or more of 60 mass% or less of Al, 10<br><br>
mass% or less of Mg, and 2 rriass% or less of Si.<br>
The plating layer of the plated steel material may be formed by any plating method. For example, the plating layer may be formed by any of hot dip plating, electroplating, vapor deposition plating, dispersion plating, vacuum plating, etc. Further, as the hot dip plating method, there are the flux method, Sendzimir method, method of applying Ni or other preplating to secure wettability, etc. Any of these may be used.<br>
Further, for the purpose of changing the appearance after plating, the plated steel material may be sprayed by water or aerated water, sprayed by a sodium phosphate aqueous solution, or sprayed by zinc powder, zinc phosphate powder, magnesium hydrogen phosphate powder, or an aqueous solution thereof.<br>
Further, to further reinforce the blackening resistance of the plating, as pretreatment for applying the composite coating after the plating, the surface may be prepared by a cobalt sulfate or nickel sulfate solution, etc.<br>
The method of coating the plated steel material surface with the treatment solution may be any of the spray method, dipping method, roll coating method, showering method, air knife method, etc. and is not particularly limited.<br>
When coating the treatment solution, to improve the wettability on the surface of the plated steel material, the treatment solution may be given a surfactant, organic solvent, etc. to a range not impairing its inherent performance. Further, if needed, a defoam agent may also be added.<br>
Further, the treatment solution may be given a lubricant or filler, for example, molybdenum disulfide, graphite, tungsten disulfide, boronitride, graphite fluoride, cerium fluoride, melamine cyanurate, fluororesin wax, polyolefin wax, colloidal silica, vapor phase silica, etc. to prevent scratches and wear when<br><br>
working the composite coated zinc-containing plated steel material of the present invention.<br>
The range of the total coating mass of the composite coating of the plated steel material surface is preferably 50 to 2000 mg/m2 or so. In this range, it is possible to obtain the composite coated zinc-containing plated steel material having excellent corrosion resistance, blackening resistance, coating adhesion, and alkali resistance aimed at by the present invention. The particularly preferable range of the total coating amount of the composite coating is 100 to 1500 mg/m2. If less than 100 mg/m2, the corrosion resistance, blackening resistance, and alkali resistance may drop. If over 1500 mg/m2, the coating may become fragile and the alkali resistance and coating adhesion may drop.<br>
When using a treatment solution to treat the plated steel material, the material is preferably heated to dry by a peak metal temperature of 50°C to 200°C in range. Note that the heating method is not particularly limited and may be any of hot air, direct flame, induction heating, infrared rays, an electric oven, etc.<br>
