PHOTOACTIVATABLE WATER BORNE COATING COMPOSITION<br>
The invention relates to a photoactivatable water borne coating composition comprising a (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane dispersion and a UV-initiator.<br>
Photoactivatable coating compositions of the type indicated above are known from, int. a!., EP-A-0 952 170. The system disclosed therein is based on dual cure and therefore comprises, besides a (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane dispersion, free isocyanate groups which may further react with one or more active hydrogen atoms in the aqueous coating composition. Though high-quality coating layers can be obtained with the known water borne coating compositions, the properties of the aqueous polyurethane dispersions used in the known compositions are still a subject for improvement, especially as far as the appearance of layers containing said dispersions is concerned when applied over substrates with rough surfaces.<br>
Photoactivatable polyurethane resins as such for use in clear coats were already known from DE-C-196 35 447. In this document use is made of a polyurethane- and/or polyester-(meth)acrylate resin with diacrylate monomers as reactive diluents. While the compositions are said to be suitable for use in solvent borne and water borne compositions, in the examples solvent borne compositions only are employed, which are cured by pulsed high-energy ultraviolet radiation.<br>
EP-A-0 965 621 discloses a photoactivatable coating composition' which comprises a (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane and a photoinitiator such as phenylglyoxylic acids or their esters or salts or derivatives thereof, optionally with other photoinitiators. Though explicit mention is made of the possible use of the claimed coating compositions in water borne systems, in the examples only solvent borne systems are used.<br><br>
The invention now provides water borne coating compositions which do not detract from the performance when applied over substrates with rough surfaces and which need not be cured by pulsed high-energy ultraviolet radiation, but can be cured with UV light such as UV-A light. Furthermore, it has been found that the resins used in the water borne coating compositions of the present invention cannot be used as such in a solvent borne coating composition, especially when the solvent borne coating composition is used as a clear coat over a base coat. The resulting coating prepared from the coating composition of the present invention has excellent properties such as water and solvent resistance, hardness, scratch resistance, appearance, dry and wet adhesion, and flexibility.<br>
The invention pertains to a photoactivatable water borne coating composition comprising<br>
a)	a (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane dispersion, with the (meth)acryloyl-functionai polyurethane comprising 5 to 18 wt.% of alkylene oxide groups while the (meth)acryloyl functionality is in the range of 2 to 40, and<br>
b)	a UV-initiator.<br>
The preferred alkylene oxide groups in the (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane are ethylene oxide groups, but alternatively propylene oxide groups or mixtures of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide groups are useful as well. For example, the alkylene oxide groups may be C1-C4 alkoxy ethers of polyalkylene glycols with the structure:<br><br>
wherein R1 is a hydrocarbon radical with 1 to 4, preferably 1 or 2, carbon atoms; R2 is a methyl group; x is between 0 and 40, preferably between 0 and 20, most preferably between 0 and 10; y is between 0 and 50, and x+y is<br><br>
between 2 and 50, preferably between 2 and 25. Examples are the methoxy ethers of polyethylene glycols or polypropylene glycols having a number average molecular weight between 100 and 3,000, preferably between 200 and 1,500, most preferably between 350 and 1,000.<br>
Thus far very good results have been obtained with a (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane comprising 8 to 18 wt.% of alkylene oxide groups.<br>
The (meth)acryloyl functionality of the polyurethane is in the range of 2 to 40, preferably 2.5 to 20, more preferably 3 to 10.<br>
The acid number of the (rneth)acryloyi-functional polyurethane is preferably up to 15 mg KOH/g solid, more preferably up to 10.<br>
Superior results are generally obtained with a (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane wherein the number average molecular weight of the (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane is in the range of 1,000 to 20,000, whereas optimum results have been obtained with a (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane having a number average molecular weight in the range of 1,200 to 8,000.<br>
A special feature of the water bome coating compositions according to the invention is their good appearance as a clear coat when applied over a (metallic) base coat. Said good appearance as a result of optimum cross-link density and shrinkage of tine obtained film is shown to full advantage when the equivalent weight of the (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane is in the range of 200 to 4,000 g/eq on solid, preferably between 350 and 1,000.<br>
The (meth)acryloyl groups-containing polyurethane dispersions can be prepared using conventional methods of polyurethane synthesis by conversion of polyisocyanates with hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates and a chain extender if<br><br>

Polyesters obtained by the polymerisation of lactones, for example caprolactone, in conjunction with a polyol, may also be used. Preferably, the polyester is prepared from 1,6-hexanediol and hexahydrophthaiic anhydride.<br>

Optimum results are obtained with a (meth)acryloyl-functional POLYURETHANE wherein the polyalkylene oxide units are polyethylene oxide units.<br>
The mono C1-C4 alkoxy derivatives may be used as such or incorporated into an adduct. For example, the adduct of a polycarboxylic acid, a polyol, and one of the above-mentioned C1-C4 alkoxy derivatives may be used.

or<br>
by reaction of<br>

d)	at least one isocyanate-reactive (meth)acryloyl-functional compound.<br>
The (meth)aoyioyl-functional polyurethane suitable for preparing the water borne coating compositions according to the invention may be prepared in a conventional manner by reacting a stoichiometric amount or an excess of the organic polyisocyanate (a) with the other reactants (c) and (d) and, optionally, (b), (e), and (f) under substantially anhydrous conditions at a temperature between about 30°C and about 130°C until the reaction between the isocyanate groups and the isocyanate-reactive groups is substantially complete. The reactants are generally used in proportions corresponding to a ratio of<br><br>
isocyanate groups to isocyanate-reactive (usually hydroxyl) groups of from about 1:1 to about 6:1, preferably about 1:1. If an excess of the organic polyisocyanate (a) is used, an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer is prepared in a first step. In a second step, at least one isocyanate-reactive group containing compound such as chain extender (e) can be added. The chain extension can be conducted at elevated, reduced or ambient temperatures. Convenient temperatures are from about 5°C to 95°C or, more preferably, from about 10°C to about 45°C.<br>
Preferably, the coating composition of the present Invention comprises one or more reactive diluents. Compounds suitable as reactive diluents generally are ethylenically unsaturated compounds. As representative examples of such may be mentioned those compounds disclosed in the previously incorporated EP-A-0 965 621. The reactive diluent preferably has a molecular weight of from about 80 to about 800, more preferably about 100 to about 400. Compounds meeting the molecular weight requirement are suitable for lowering the viscosity of the coating composition. Preferably, reactive diluents are used in an amount of 5 to 50 wt.% on solid resin, more preferably 10 to 40 wt.%.<br>
Examples of monofunctional reactive diluents include the esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, such as methyl (metri)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, propyl<br>
•<br>
(meth)acrylate, isopropyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, isobutyl (meth)-acrylate, tertiary butyl (meth)acryiate, neopentyl (meth)acrylate, isopentyl (meth)acrylate, n-hexyl (meth)acrylate, isohexyl (meth)acrylate, n-heptyl (meth)a cry late, iso-heptyl (meth)acrylate, octyl (meth)acrylate, iso-octy! (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyi (meth)acrylate, nonyl (meth)acrylate, iso-nonyl (meth)acrylate, decyl (meth)acrylate, iso-decyl (meth)acrylate, undecyl (meth)acrylate, iso-undecyl (meth)acrylate, dodecyl (meth)acrylate, iso-dodecyl (meth)acrylate, tridecyl (meth)acrylate, iso-tridecyl (meth)acrylate, tetradecyl (meth)acrylate, iso-tetradecyl (meth)acrylate, and mixtures thereof. Moreover, the aforesaid esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid may contain radiation-reactive unsaturation in the alcohol radical as well. Additional monofunctional<br><br>
radiation-sensitive compounds which may be used as a reactive diluent include diallyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, vinyl acetate, and N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, especially the last compound.<br>
The highly preferred reactive diluents in the clear coats of the present invention are those having more than one radiation-sensitive bond. Such compounds ordinarily are the esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and a polyhydric alcohol. Further suitable reactive diluents are urethane acrylates, melamine acrylates, epoxy-acrylic acid adducts, and reactive diluents containing polyethylene oxide. Examples of the aforesaid difunctional diluents are ethylene glycol diacrylate and dimethacrylate; isopropylene and propylene glycol diacrylate and dirnethacrylate. Similarly, the diol diacrylates and dimethacrylates of butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, and so forth up to and including thirty-six carbon diols are useful in the present clear coats as reactive diluents. Of particular interest are 1,4-butane diol diacrylate, 1,6-hexane diol diacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, trimethylol propane triacrylate, and pentaerythritol tetra-acrylate. Thus far optimum results have been obtained with reactive diluents selected from the group of 3-methoxypropyl-, benzyl-, octyl-, 2-hydroxy-ethyl citraconimide, (meth)acrylate esters of butane diol, hexane diol, and trimethylol propane, the diacrylate ester of butanediol diglycidyi ether, ethoxylated trimethylol propane triacrylate, and the 'reaction product of a.a.cc'.cc'-tetramethyl xylyiene   diisocyanate  (TMXDf5)  with  4-hydroxy  butylacrylate  and/or the<br>
esterification product of 1 mole of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate and 2 moles of caprolactone, and/or methoxy polyethyleneoxide glycol having a molecular weight between 300 and 1,000.<br>
As examples of UV-initiators which can be used in the clear coats of the invention may be mentioned benzoin ether (Esacure® ex Fratelli Lamberti), benzyl dimethyl ketone acetal (Irgacure® 651 ex Ciba), 1-hydroxy cyclohexyl phenyl ketone (Irgacure® 184 ex Ciba), 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1 -phenyl propane-1-one (Darocur® 1173 ex Ciba),  1-(4-isopropy! phenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl<br><br>
propane-1-one (Darocur® 1116 ex Ciba), diethoxyacetophenone (DEAP® ex Upjohn), methyl thioxanthone (Quantacur® ex Shell), 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl diphenyl phosphine oxide (Lucirin TPO® ex BASF), and the bisphosphine oxides such as CGI® 819 and CGI® 403 ex Ciba. The amount of UV-initiator used ranges from 0.001 to 10 wt.% on solids, preferably from 1 to 8 wt.%, more preferably .from 2 to 6 wt.%.<br>
The coating compositions according to the invention are radiation curable after application and, optionally, evaporation of solvents. In particular, they are suitable for curing by irradiation with UV radiation. Combinations of IR/UV irradiation are also suitable. Radiation sources which may be used are those customary for UV, such as high- and medium-pressure mercury lamps.<br>
In order to avoid any risk involved in handling UV light of very short wavelength (UV B and/or UV C light), preference is given, especially for use in automotive refinishing shops, to fluorescent lamps, which produce the less injurious UV A light.<br>
The amount of energy necessary to cure the reactive components will of course depend on the light intensity, the angle of exposure to and the distance from the radiation, and the thickness of the coating to be applied, as well as the presence or absence of a free radical initiating catalyst. For any given composition the best method of determining the amount and duration of the radiation required is by experimental determination of the amount of radiation-sensitive groups not cured following exposure to the radiation source.'<br>
In circumstances where it appears to be desirable to increase the curing speed in places which are not readily accessible to UV light, the water borne coating composition may comprise compounds having one or more active hydrogen atoms-containing groups which can react with the olefinically unsaturated groups contained in the (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane dispersion.<br><br>
Suitable active hydrogen-containing groups are activated CH groups, i.e. a methylene and/or monosubstituted methylene group in the a-position to two carbonyl groups, such as malonate and/or acetoacetate groups. Examples of maionate group-containing compounds and malonate group-containing oligomeric and polymeric compounds are disclosed in US-A-2,759,913 and US-A-4,602,061, respectively. Preferred compounds are the oligomeric and/cr polymeric malonate group-containing compounds such as polyurethanes, polyesters, polyacrylates, epoxy resins, polyamides, and polyvinyl resins which contain malonate groups in the main chain or are pendant or both.<br>
Malonate group-containing polyurethanes can be obtained, for example, by reacting a polyisocyanate with a hydroxyl group-containing ester of a polyol and malonic acid, or by the esterification or transesterification of a hydroxy-functional polyurethane with malonic acid or a dialkylmalonate.<br>
Malonate group-containing polyesters can be obtained, for example, by the polycondensation of malonic acid, an alky! malonic acid (such as ethyl malonic acid), a mono- or dialkyl ester of such a malonic acid and/or the reaction product of a malonic ester and an alkyl (meth)acrylate, optionally with other di-or polycarboxylic acids, with di- and/or higher-functional hydroxy compounds, and, optionally, monofunctional hydroxy and/or carboxyl compounds.<br>
Malonate group-containing epoxy esters can be obtained, for example, by esterifying an epoxy resin with malonic acid or a malonic monoester, or by transesterification with a dialkyl malonate, optionally with other carboxyiic acids and derivatives thereof.<br>
Malonate group-containing polyamides can be obtained, for example, in the same manner as the polyesters, in which case at least part of the hydroxy compound is replaced with a mono- and/or polyvalent primary and/or secondary amine.<br><br>
As examples of acetoacetate group-containing compounds may be mentioned acetoacetic esters as disclosed in US-A-2,759,913 (see especially col. 8, lines 53-54), diacetoacetate compounds as disclosed in US-A-4,217,396 (see especially col. 2, line 65 through col. 3, line 27), and acetoacetate group-containing oligomeric and polymeric compounds as disclosed in US-A-4,408,018 (see especially col. 1, line 51 through col, 2, line 6). Preference is given to the oligomeric and/or polymeric acetoacetate group-containing compounds.<br>
Suitable acetoacetate group-containing oligomeric and polymeric compounds can be obtained, for example, from polyalcohols and/or hydroxy-functional polyether, polyester, polyacryiate, vinyl and epoxy oligomers and polymers by reaction with diketene or transesterification with an alkyl acetoacetate. Such compounds can also be obtained by the copolymerisation of an acetoacetate-functional acrylic monomer with other vinyl-and/or acrylic-functional monomers.<br>
Especially preferred among the acetoacetate group-containing compounds for use with the present invention are acetoacetate group-containing oligomers and polymers containing at least 2 acetoacetate groups. It is also especially preferred that such acetoacetate group-containing compounds have an Mn in the range of from about 234 to about 30,000, and an acid number of about 2 or less.<br>
Compounds containing both malonate and acetoacetate groups in the same molecule are also suitable and can be obtained, for example, by a Michael reaction between a malonate-functional polyester and an acetoacetate-functional acrylic compound (e.g., acetoacetoxyethyi acrylate). Additionally, physical mixtures of malonate and acetoacetate group-containing compounds are suitable. Alkylacetoacetates can, in addition, be used as reactive diluents.<br>
Optionally, the activated CH groups-containing compounds may be utilised in • the enamine form, such as disclosed in EP-A-0 420 133.<br><br>
The reaction between activated CH groups-containing compounds and olefinically unsaturated compounds is carried out in the presence of a base. It is preferred that use be made of a base of which the conjugated acid has a pKa of at least 12, such as tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide, epoxy adduct of tertiary amines, amines of the amidine type, examples of which include tetramethyl guanidine and 1,8-diaza-[5,4,0]-bicyc!oundecene, and catalysts described in EP-A-0 596 461. Thus far, optimum results have been obtained with 1,8-diaza-[5,4,0]-bicycloundecene.<br>
According to the invention, electrically charged bases also constitute suitable catalysts, provided that the conjugated acid thereof has a pKa &gt; 10, preferably &gt; 12. As examples of representative bases may be mentioned metal bases. Examples of suitable bases include metal oxides such as sodium methanolate; metal hydroxides such as sodium phenolate; metal hydrocarbon compounds such as n-butyl lithium; metal hydrides such as sodium hydride; metal amides such as potassium amide, and metal carbonates such as potassium carbonate.<br>
Instead of activated CH groups-containing compounds the composition may comprise polyamines such as polyamino amides having an amine number of 60-1,000, which react with the (meth)acryiate groups present in the (meth)acryloyl-functiona! polyurethane tesin, such as disclosed in EP-A-0 262 720. Use may also be made of oligomeric sterically hindered polyamines, such as disclosed in EP-A-0 678 105. ThioI-functional compounds, such as pentaerythritol tetramercapto propionate, which react with the (meth)acrylate groups present in the (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane resin, may also be used to improve the surface cure and the scratch resistance of the resulting coating.<br>
Preference is given to a coating composition which comprises compounds having active hydrogen atoms-containing groups such as hydroxyl-, thiol-, and/or amino-functiona! groups which are reactive with free isocyanate groups. If  desired,   the   isocyanate-reactive   groups   may  be   comprised   in   the<br><br>
(meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane resin. For use in the water borne coating compositions according to the invention preference is given to compounds bearing hydroxyl-functional groups.<br>
For an organic polyisocyanate to be used in a water borne dual cure coating composition preference is given to a hydrophobic polyisocyanate including polyfunctional, preferably free, polyisocyanates with an average NCO functionality of 2.5 to 5 which may be (cyclo)aliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic in nature. The polyisocyanate may include biuret, urethane, uretdione, and isocyanurate derivatives. One example of a polyisocyanate includes 1,6-hexane diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate or bis(isocyanate cyclohexyl) methane, and the above-mentioned derivatives thereof. Normally, these products are liquid at ambient temperature and commercially available in a wide range. Preferred are cyclic trimers (isocyanurates) of 1,6-hexane diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate. Usually these compounds contain small quantities of their higher homologues. Optionally, a hydrophilic polyisocyanate may be partially substituted for the hydrophobic polyisocyanate. The polyisocyanate, the (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane resin, and, optionally, a further isocyanate-reactive functional compound or resin should be mixed in such a ratio that the NCOrisocyanate-reactive groups ratio is in the range of 0.25-4:1, preferably 0.5-3:1, more preferably 0.75-2.5:1, and most preferably 1-2:1.<br>
The polyisocyanate may be mixed into the (meth)acryloyl-functional polyurethane dispersion by any suitable technique. However, simple stirring is usually sufficient. Sometimes it may be useful to dilute the polyisocyanate somewhat with an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate or 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate to reduce its viscosity. Also included in the free isocyanate groups-containing coating compositions may be reactive diluents such as water-soluble mono or (preferably) polyhydric alcohols, examples of which include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, isomeric butane diols, the polyethylene oxide glycols or polypropylene oxide glycols, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, and glycerol.<br><br>
In the presence of a free polyisocyanate generally use is made of a Sn-based catalyst. The pot life at ambient temperature of a free polyisocyanate composition generally is between 4 and 12 hours, depending on the use of the catalysts and their amount.<br>
The coating compositions may further comprise other ingredients, additives or auxiliaries, such as other polymers or polymer dispersions, pigments, dyes, emulsifiers (surfactants), pigment dispersion aids, levelling agents, anti-cratering agents, antifoaming agents, antisagging agents, heat stabilisers, UV absorbers, antioxidants, and fillers.<br>
Suitable types of other polymer dispersions include acrylic polymer emulsions and aqueous polyurethane dispersions.<br>
The coating compositions of the present invention may be applied to any substrate. The substrate may be, for example, metal, plastic, such as PVC, wood, glass, ceramic material, or some other coating layer. The other coating layer may be comprised of the coating composition of the invention or it may be a different coating composition. The coating compositions of the invention show particular utility as clear coats, base coats, pigmented top coats, primers, and fillers. The coating compositions can b£ applied by conventional means such as by spray gun, brush, or roller, with spraying being preferred. Curing temperatures preferably are between 0 and 80°C and more preferably between 20 and 60°C. The compositions are particularly suitable in the preparation of coated metal substrates, such as in the refinish industry, in particular the body shop, to repair automobiles and transportation vehicles, and in finishing large transportation vehicles such as trains, trucks, buses, and aeroplanes.<br>
Preferred is the use of the coating composition of the present invention as a clear coat. Clear coats are required to be highly transparent and must adhere well to the base coat layer. It is further required that the clear coat does not change the aesthetic aspect of the base coat by strike-in, i.e. discolouration of<br><br>
the base coat due to its solvation by the clear coat composition, or by yellowing of the clear coat upon outdoor exposure. A clear coat based on the coating composition of the present invention does not have these drawbacks.<br>
In the case of the coating composition being a clear coat, the base coat may be a conventional base coat known in the coating art. Examples are solvent borne base coats, e.g., Autobase® ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV, and water borne base coats, e.g., Autowave® ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV. Furthermore, the base coat may comprise pigments (coloured pigments, metallics and/or pearls), wax, solvents, flow additives, neutralising agent, and defoamers. Also high-solids base coats can be used. The clear coat composition is applied to the surface of a base coat and then cured. An intermediate curing step for the base coat may be introduced.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the coating composition of the present invention may be applied as a clear coat on flexible flooring, such as PVC and polyolefin. The preferred application method in that case is by roller coater.<br>
The invention will be illustrated with reference to the following examples. Of course these examples are submitted for a better understanding of the invention only; they are not to be construed as limiting in any manner the scope thereof.<br><br>

The resistance to methylethyl ketone (MEK) and water was determined after 1 and 7 days of ageing and exposure for one minute (MEK) or for one hour (water). In the resistance test 0 stands for dissolved, 3 for slightly affected, and 5 for excellent<br>
The appearance was judged visually. A good appearance means: a smooth . surface with a high gloss. A bad appearance means: a dull, low gloss level.<br>
The scratch resistance was judged by pressing and scratching a finger-nail on the coating. (-) means: the coating is damaged very easily; (+) means: severe pressure is necessary to damage the coating.<br><br>
The adhesion evaluation was done with the cross cut test. For the wet adhesion test, the samples were left in water for 5 days and then dried for 1 hour. The rating ranges from 0 to 5 with 5 being best.<br>
