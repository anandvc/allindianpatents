3.PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
Device and Method for Updating the Configuration of Mobile Terminals<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a device, a computer program product and a method, which can be used to update the configuration of mobile terminals, as well as a transmission device, a computer program product and a transmission method for transmitting short messages to update the configuration of mobile terminals to the terminals affected by the update.<br>
In the following sections, the term "mobile terminals" covers, in particular, portable data storage devices, i.e., so-called chip cards, mobile telecommunications devices, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), portable computers, and the like.<br>
Various types of chip cards and applications for chip cards are known from the prior art. An overview of these is provided in the "Handbuch der Chipkarten" ("The Chip Card Handbook‚Äù), Wolfgang Rankl, Wolfgang Effing, Hansa Publishing, 1999. For example, in the case of chip cards, a differentiation is made between memory cards, microprocessor cards, and contactless IC cards.<br>
Known applications for chip cards include applications for authentication, access control, encryption, digital signatures, payment, electronic ticketing, pay-TV, and applications as a health insurance card and electronic immobilizer. The use of chip cards in the field of mobile telephony is of particular significance. In particular, chip cards are used as so-called SIMs (Subscriber Identity Modules), in accordance with the GSM cellular radio standard. SIM chip cards of this type are also used in the GSM-R variant of the GSM standard.<br>
Chip cards typically have a data memory with or without a file system. Generally, the data memory is divided up into data fields. A SIM has a hierarchically organized file system with a so-called master file (MF). The MF is the root directory of the file tree. The file system then also has two dedicated files (DF) in which the chip card's data fields, known as elementary files (EF), are located. The possible file structures for the EFs are transparent, linear fixed,<br><br>
and cyclic. The GSM 11.11 specification defines forty-eight different EFs for the application data that is integrated in the two DFs.<br>
Corresponding chip cards are also employed in accordance with the UMTS standard in the form of USIMs (Universal Subscriber Identity Modules). In the case of the mobile terminals of a so-called "trusted computing platform", the data memory is bonded to the terminal. For this purpose, the memory is constructed as an IC, which is used for hardware identification of the terminal.<br>
Various devices and methods for storing data and interchanging data with a SIM are known from the prior art:<br>
A method of using an application stored on a SIM is known from WO 00/48416. In this method, the key required for encryption and/or decryption and/or digital signing is stored in a protected area of the SIM.<br>
A method for changing a service profile assigned to a subscriber is known from EP 0899979 A2. With this method, the subscriber himself/herself can access an erasable data memory on the SIM in order to have his/her service profile changed or displayed.<br>
A device for managing data for the operation of a communications network with a large number of terminals, each of which features a SIM, is known from DE 19810926. The device makes it possible to determine, at any time, the number of free memory areas provided for an application on the chip card for the respective type of chip card. Applications stored in an application database can be transmitted to the chip card in the form of a short message, where they can be stored in a free area of memory.<br>
In contrast, the task that forms the basis of the invention is to create an improved device for updating the memory of a chip card, as well as a corresponding   computer   program   product  and   a   corresponding   method.<br>
3<br><br>
Furthermore, the task that forms the basis of the present invention is to create an improved transmission device for transmitting short messages to update the memory of a chip card, as well as a corresponding computer program product and method.<br>
The tasks that form the basis of the invention are solved through the features of the main claims in each case. Preferred embodiments of the invention are indicated in the dependent claims.<br>
The device according to the invention serves to update the configuration of mobile terminals. In particular, an embodiment of the device can be used to store the current memory profiles of one or more chip cards. Furthermore, the device serves to store a target memory profile of the chip card or cards. In the initial step of updating a memory, a difference profile is determined. The difference profile contains the data, in respect of which the target profile differs from the current profile of the relevant chip card. A profile may comprise a configuration of the data memory with regard to its storage structure and/or allocation of memory space. In this context, a profile may contain technical configuration data and/or logical configuration data. In particular, the term logical configuration data in this context shall cover the configuration data, which is used to configure an application.<br>
To update the chip card's memory, only the difference profile is transmitted to the chip card. This allows for a drastic reduction in the volume of data that has to be transmitted to update the memory; thus, also, in the time required for the update. This is especially advantageous, in particular, for safety-critical and/or time-critical applications such as GSM-R applications, for example. In this process, it is not necessary to carry out the determination of the difference profile for each chip card individually; it can instead be carried out once for all the chip cards that are being reconfigured from a current profile to a new target profile.<br>
4<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the device can be used for a large number of registered chip cards. The current profiles of the chip cards are stored in a database of the device. The chip cards' identification codes are used as database keys for accessing the current profiles. In the case of an application for GSM or GSM-R, respectively, it is advantageous to use the IMSI (International Mobil Subscriber Identity), ICCID (Integrated Chip Card ID), or the MSISDN (Mobil Subscriber ISDN, i.e., the telephone number of a cellular phone subscriber).<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the device has a further database for storing different target profiles. Preferably, each of the target profiles has a name, which is used as an access key for obtaining database access to a stored target profile. Alternatively, all the defined profiles are stored in a single database.<br>
A user can enter different target profiles via a user interface and store them in the database. A user can also employ the user interface to select a stored target profile in the database and assign it to one or more of the registered chip cards. The one or more chip cards selected by the user is/are then updated in accordance with the selected target profile.<br>
This is particularly advantageous for the uniform configuration of the chip cards of a group of subscribers. In GSM-R, in particular, such subscriber groups are defined for group call functions such as Voice-Group-Call and Voice-Broadcast, for example. By selecting one of the target profiles from the database and assigning the selected target profile to the chip card identification codes of the relevant subscriber group, it is possible to update and configure the chip cards of these subscriber groups in a uniform manner. So-called SIM Profile Management can be carried out in a particularly efficient manner using this method.<br>
5<br><br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, each of the current profiles contains a reproduction of the configuration of the data memory of the chip card to which it is assigned. Corresponding configuration data is contained in the target profiles. Preferably, each of the current and target profiles contains a reproduction of the current or selectable data structure, respectively, and the memory contents of a data memory of one or more of the chip cards.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the device is designed to transmit the difference profile to the chip cards via a telecommunications network, in particular, a digital cellular phone network. Alternatively, or additionally, the device is designed to transmit the difference profile via a chip card reader.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the chip card's data memory is divided up into data fields. An address space is spanned by the data fields. The difference profile for updating the memory of one of the chip cards contains update data for one or more of these data fields. In addition, in each case, the difference profile contains a specification of a reference address for the update data in the relevant data field. The relevant data field is overwritten by its update data starting from the respective reference address.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the device has a subscriber database to store the identification codes of registered chip cards. Preferably, the same primary key used to save the current profile is used as a database key. For each of the subscribers, the subscriber database may feature a specification regarding the assignment of the relevant subscriber to a subscriber group, their function, location, name, etc.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the device has a history database to store the progression over time of the various current profiles assigned to a chip card. This is particularly advantageous as a means<br>
6<br><br>
of fulfilling statutory obligations to present documentary proof pertaining to applications in the GSM-R arena.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the device is designed to receive confirmation from the chip card stating that the update of the chip card's memory has been carried out in accordance with the difference profile received by the chip card. After receiving this confirmation, the current profile assigned to the relevant chip card in the database is overwritten by the target profile, which formed the basis for creating the difference profile. This operation can be shown in the history database.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the device is designed to generate a short message for each chip card affected by an update. Preferably, a short message of this type shall consist of an OTA (Over-the-Air) short message, for example, a so-called binary SMS (Short Message Services).<br>
Each of the short messages contains an identification code of a chip card affected by the update and the relevant reference profile. The short messages are buffered in a transmission device. From the buffer memory of the transmission device, the short messages are transmitted wirelessly or via a wire connection to the addressed chip cards. Preferably, the transmission device receives the chip cards' confirmations and forwards them, so that the existing current profile is overwritten by the target profile, which formed the basis for creating the difference profile.<br>
The present invention is particularly advantageous for safety-critical applications, such as emergency calls in a GSM-R system, for example. Thanks to the reduction in the volume of data required to update the memory of a chip card, the time required to import a new configuration, in accordance with the so-called OTA download, is also reduced. In particular, this enables the use of an<br>
7<br><br>
OTA platform in networks with safety-relevant functions, such as GSM-R and GSM-BOS, for example.<br>
These networks have group call functions, which require a configuration on the system side and on the chip card side. In certain applications, the change of configurations may have a high frequency, for example, for DGC (Dynamic Group Call) in trains in a GSM-R system. The present invention makes it possible to minimize the download times and the update times for new configurations of the chip cards, which results in an expansion of the possible applications of GSM-R and GSM-BOS.<br>
A particular advantage in this context is, in particular, the minimization of the signaling load in the transmission of the update data, since both the number and the message size of the short messages required for an update can be minimized by means of the invention. A further advantage is the fact that the card configuration management process can be conducted in an efficient and user-friendly manner via an appropriate user interface.<br>
A further significant advantage is the option of having the chip cards confirm to the device that an update has been performed. The current profile is not overwritten by the previously selected target profile until a confirmation of this kind has been effected. This provides the certainty, which is particularly important for safety-critical applications, that the current profiles registered on the side of the device actually conform to the configurations of the chip cards.<br>

Figure 1 shows electronic device 100 for managing and updating the configuration of data memory 102 of chip card 104. The electronic device is particularly suitable for so-called SIM profile management.<br>
Data memory 102 of chip card 104 is divided up into data fields A, B, C,... X, Y, Z. For example, chip card 104 may be a so-called SIM, in which case the data fields are EFs.<br>
Device 100 has user interface 106, memory 108, processor 110, and chip card communications interface 112. Memory 108 is used to store at least one current profile 114 and one target profile 116. Current profile 114 contains a specification of the current configuration of data memory 102 with regard to its storage structure and/or with regard to the data stored in the data fields of data memory 102. In contrast, target profile 116 contains a specification of a potentially desired configuration of data memory 102 of chip card 104, once again, with regard to the structure and/or the data to be stored.<br>
9<br><br>
Processor 110 serves to run program component 118. Program component 118 serves to control the overall function of device 100. Furthermore, processor 110 serves to run program component 120, which serves to form a difference profile between current profile 114 and target profile 116.<br>
Via user interface 106, a user can input target profile 116, retrieve current profile 114 or target profile 116 stored in memory 108, and cause this to be displayed on a screen, for example. Furthermore, a user can select target profile 116, in order to update chip card 104 accordingly.<br>
This launches program component 120, which uses current profile 114 and target profile 116 to determine a difference profile, which is transmitted through chip card communications interface 112 via a message channel to chip card 104 either wirelessly or via a wire connection. Thereupon, data memory 102 of chip card 104 is updated accordingly. Preferably, electronic device 100 receives an appropriate confirmation once the update of data memory 102 has been performed. Thereupon, current profile 114 is overwritten by target profile 116 in memory 108.<br>
Figure 2 provides an example to illustrate how difference profile 122 is generated from current profile 114 and target profile 116 (cf. Figure 1). A memory address space is spanned by data fields A, B, C, . . . of data memory 102. Current profile 114 contains a reproduction of the data stored in each of the data fields A, B, C....<br>
Accordingly, target profile 116 contains a specification of the data to be stored in data fields A, B, C.... By means of program component 120 (cf. Figure 1), target profile 116 is compared with current profile 114, in order to determine those memory addresses in the address space, in respect of which the data stored in current profile 114 deviates from the corresponding data of target<br>
10<br><br>
profile 116. These memory address areas are shown as hatched regions in target profile 116 in Figure 2.<br>
In data field A, the starting address for the region of deviating data is start address 124; in data field B, it is start address 126; in data field C, it is start address 128; and, in data field Y, it is start address 130. In the example case under consideration here, the data in the further data fields in current profile 114 and target profile 116 is identical.<br>
Those data fields, in respect of which current profile 114 differs from target profile 116, are stored in difference profile 122. In the example case under consideration here, these are data fields A, B, C, and Y. Furthermore, for each of the data fields, the start address is given for saving the update data. For data field A, this is start address 124; for data field B, it is start address 126; for data field C, it is start address 128; and, for data field Y, it is start address 130. Finally, the update data for each data field and each start address is saved in difference profile 122, with which the current memory content of data memory 102 is to be overwritten.<br>
Upon receipt of difference profile 122 by chip card 104 (cf. Figure 1), the data fields of data memory 102 specified in difference profile 122 are overwritten by the update data, starting' in each case at the start address specified in the difference profile for the respective data field.<br>
Figure 3 shows an embodiment of a method for updating a chip card.<br>
In step 300, a system initialization is performed. On initialization of the system, a basic profile used upon delivery of chip card 104 is stored in memory. This basic profile is also referred to as the technical profile and is typically configured by the manufacturer when the chip cards and the associated terminals (e.g., cellular phones) are delivered.<br>
11<br><br>
In step 300, the basic profile is saved to memory as the current profile. In step 302, the user can employ the user interface to input one or more target profiles that deviate from the basic profile. For example, different target profiles are defined for the different subscriber groups of a GSM-R system.<br>
In step 304, the user selects one of the target profiles and assigns this to one or more of the registered chip cards. In step 306, a difference profile is determined from the chip card's current profile and the target profile selected in step 304. If multiple chip cards are to be updated, then this takes place for each of the affected chip cards. The determination of a difference profile can be effected as illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
In step 308, each of the difference profiles that have been determined are transmitted to the relevant chip card. The updating of the single or multiple chip cards is then performed in accordance with the relevant difference profile in each case. In step 310, a confirmation is received from one of the chip cards that the update has been performed. Thereupon, the existing current profile is overwritten (step 312) by the target profile selected in step 304. Thus, the previously selected target profile becomes the chip card's new current profile.<br>
Steps 310 and 312 are carried out for each of the chip cards from which a confirmation of this type has been received. Should no confirmation of the successful performance of the update have been received from one of the chip cards affected by the update, then a retransmission of the difference profile to the affected card may be performed (step 308).<br>
Figure 4 shows a block diagram of a further embodiment. The elements of Figure 4 that correspond to elements in Figures 1 and 2 are designated by the same reference numbers.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 4, the electronic device is represented by computer 400. Computer 400 may be a network component of cellular network<br>
12<br><br>
424. In the case of the embodiment under consideration here, the user interface is implemented in the form of a server application, such as so-called Web services 406, for example, which is run by processor 410 of computer 400. Using client computer 426, which features a client application, such as a terminal program or standard browser program 428, for example, a user can access computer 400 over Internet 430.<br>
Memory 408 of computer 400 is used to store current profile database 414 and target profile database 416. Current profile database 414 contains one entry for each of the registered chip cards of cellular network 424. In this context, the IMSI, ICCID, or MSISDN can be used as an identification code for database access. For each of the registered chip cards, their current profile is saved in current profile database 414 with the identification code of the relevant chip card as a key.<br>
Various target profiles are stored in the target profile database. A specific profile name is allocated to each of the target profiles, which can be used to access a selected target profile in target profile database 416.<br>
Furthermore, memory 408 is used to store subscriber database 432 and history database 434.<br>
In subscriber database 432, subscriber data is stored for each registered subscriber of cellular network 424. The subscriber data is stored in subscriber database 432 with the identification code of the chip card belonging to a subscriber used as a key. The subscriber data may comprise, for example, the name of the subscriber, their membership of a subscriber group, their location, or similar data. Furthermore, it is also possible for a subscriber to be the terminal itself.<br>
History database 434 is used to record the progression over time of the chip card configurations. For each of the chip cards, the history of the current<br>
13<br><br>
profiles, which the relevant chip card had, is stored, whereby the identification code of the relevant chip card is used as a key. For this purpose, each profile stored in history database 434 is provided with a time stamp, such as change date and time, for example. In addition, it is also possible to record which user instigated the respective update.<br>
In the example embodiment under consideration here, the chip card communications interface is implemented in the form of additional computer 412. Computer 412 may also be a network component of cellular network 442.<br>
Computer 412 has processor 436 to run program 438. Program 438 is used to control the workings of computer 412. Computer 412 also has buffer memory 440, card reader interface 442, and air interface 444. Card reader interface 442 is connected to card reader 446, a so-called chip card terminal. Computer 412 can communicate with mobile device 448 over cellular network 424 via air interface 444.<br>
At start-up, the subscriber data is firstly stored in subscriber database 432, and the basic profiles of the SIMs in current profile database 414, in computer 400, using the respective identification codes in each case as keys. From client computer 426, target profiles can be defined in target profile database 416 via Internet 430 and Web services 406. As an example, various subscriber group-specific target profiles are stored in target profile database 416, each of which is provided with the name of the respective subscriber group.<br>
To update SIM 404, for example, a user selects one of the target profiles stored in target profile database 416 and links the selected target profile with the identification code of SIM 404. This can be effected through an interactive, graphical approach using "drag-and-drop" or using list boxes, i.e., so-called "pull-down" or "push-up" menus.<br>
14<br><br>
Once the selected target profile has been assigned to SIM 404, difference profile 422 is determined for SIM 404, for example, in the manner depicted in Figure 2. For this purpose, program component 420 is started, which accesses current profile database 414, which retrieves the current profile of SIM 404 as of that moment from current profile database 414, in order to determine difference profile 422 with respect to the selected target profile.<br>
Furthermore, program component 420 generates short message 450, for example, in the form of a so-called binary SMS. Short message 450 contains the identification code of SIM 404 and difference profile 422. Short message 450 is transmitted by computer 400 to computer 412. If the user has selected multiple SIMs for update, then a corresponding short message is generated for each of the selected SIMs and transmitted to computer 412. Short messages 450 are stored temporarily in buffer memory 440. Alternatively, short messages 450 are generated by computer 450 [sic?].<br>
If SIM 404 is located in the card reader of mobile device 448 and mobile device 448 is logged onto cellular network 424, then short message 450 shall be transmitted from buffer memory 440 via air interface 444 and the cellular network to mobile device 448. If, however, SIM 404 is located in card reader 446, then short message 450 is transmitted from buffer memory 440 via card reader interface 442 and card reader 446 to SIM 404.<br>
Upon receipt of short message 450, the updating of data memory 402 is effected in accordance with difference profile 422. Once the update has been successfully completed, SIM 404 emits confirmation 452, which is transmitted to computer 400 from card reader 446 or cellular network 424, respectively, via computer 412. In this context, confirmation 452 contains, at least, the identification code of SIM 404.<br>
Upon receipt of confirmation 452, the current profile stored in current profile database 414 of SIM 404 is overwritten by the selected target profile. The<br>
15<br><br>
overwritten current profile is recorded in history database 434 with the identification code of SIM 404 as a key.<br>
Confirmation 452 of the successfully completed update is very advantageous, in particular for safety-critical applications, as a quality control with regard to the download process. Confirmation 452, which is also referred to as a Proof of Receipt (PoR) notification, is preferably sent by SIM 404 as a short message, i.e., as a binary SMS, for example.<br>
For example, via this short message, the responsible process on the chip card provides notification of how many OTAs of previously received short message 450 it was able to properly process and, in the event of a processing error, also provides notification of the error code. Upon an error occurring in the course of the processing of an OTA command by the responsible process on the chip card, the processing of any further OTA commands of short message 450 that may not yet have been run is aborted and a corresponding error status report is transmitted to computer 400 as a short message.<br>
As well as establishing group call functions in GSM-R and GSM-BOS, the system shown in Figure 4 is particularly suitable for establishing roaming profiles in a GMS [sic?] network, precedence set-ups for privileged subscribers, so-called enhanced multi-level precedence and preemption (eMLPP), and for phone book management for corporate client subscribers. Further applications include:<br>
-	management and configuration of corporate customer profiles, e.g., company phone book configuration,<br>
-	roaming in GSM networks,<br>
-	the establishment of privileged subscriber groups entitled to precedence over other subscribers in GSM networks,<br>
-	management of roaming profiles in GSM networks,<br>
-	the establishment of call groups (action teams) in GSM-BOS,<br>
16<br><br>
- management of device configurations (device management).<br>
Figure 5 shows an alternative embodiment of the structuring of memory 408 of computer 400 of Figure 4. In the embodiment shown in Figure 5, all the configuration data is located in single database 454, in contrast to the embodiment shown in Figure 4. In other words, the current profiles and target profiles are not stored separately; instead, all of the configuration profiles that are defined are stored in database 454. Each of the configuration profiles has a profile name as a primary key for database access and memory allocations and/or a memory structure specification for the configured or yet to be configured data memory or memories.<br>
In subscriber database 456, a profile name is assigned to each of the subscribers. This ensures that each subscriber's current profile is clearly identified in memory 408, i.e., database 454. If, by means of user input, the profile name assigned to a subscriber is to be replaced by a different profile name, which is present in database 454 as a key, then the difference profile is formed from the combination of the profile newly selected for the subscriber from database 454 and the existing current profile as defined through the existing entry in subscriber database 456. Once confirmation 452 (cf. Figure 4) has been received, the profile name of the newly selected profile is stored in the subscriber database in place of the existing current profile name. The previous current profile name and/or the corresponding memory allocations are stored in history database 434.<br>
In comparison to the embodiment shown in Figure 4, this embodiment has the advantage that only one database is required to store all the configuration profiles.<br>
Figure 6 shows an object relationship diagram depicting a mode of operation of the system shown in Figures 4 and 5. The elements of Figure 6 that correspond to elements in Figures 4 and 5 are designated by the same reference numbers.<br>
17<br><br>
In step 1, installation of the basic profile is performed by transferring it from client 426 to computer 400. Step 2 involves the creation and saving of target profiles, which are also designated as functional profiles or logical profiles. These are also transferred from client computer 426 to computer 400. In step 3, the installation of chip card management information is performed, i.e., writing of the subscriber data to the subscriber database, for example. The corresponding subscriber data is also transferred from client computer 426 to computer 400. In step 4, one of the target profiles is selected as a destination profile for the update of at least one of the registered chip cards.<br>
The difference profile is then determined by the computer in step 5. In step 6, the difference profile is transferred from computer 400 to computer 412. In the embodiment under consideration here, the difference profile is transformed into short messages (step 7) in computer 412.<br>
In step 8, the short message is transmitted to, and received by (step 9), SIM 408 via card reader 446 or cellular network 424, respectively. Once data memory 402 of SIM 404 has been updated, step 10 sees the transfer of the status response, i.e., of confirmation 452 or of an error message, via card reader 446 or cellular network 424, respectively, to computer 412 (step 11) and on to computer 400 (step 12).<br>
If the status response is confirmation 452, then the current profile is overwritten by the new target profile in the current profile database. In step 13, it is also possible for the status response to be displayed on client computer 426.<br>
