Nationality: an Italian company<br>
The following specification particularly describes ihe nature of this invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed<br><br>
"PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF GABAPENTIN"<br>
Description The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of gabapentin and, more in particular, to a method of synthesis of 1,1-cyclohexane acetic acid monoamide, an intermediate used in the preparation of gabapentin.<br>
Gabapentin, l-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane acetic acid (The Merck Index, XII ed., page 733, no. 4343) is a known drug with anti-epileptic activity, described the first time by Warner-Lambert Co. in US Patent 4,024,175.<br>
In the literature, several processes for the preparation of gabapentin are reported; see for example the US Patents 4,024,175, previously mentioned, US 5,068,413, and US 5,091,567, both in the name of Goedecke AG.<br>
The US Patent 4,024,175 describes various processes for the preparation of gabapentin or analogous compounds of formula<br><br>
wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl and n is 4, 5 or 6;<br>
characterised by the use of conventional methods for the preparation of primary<br>
amines or amino acids such as, for example, the Curtius, Hofmann and Lossen<br>
rearrangement.<br>
In particular, the aforesaid patent in the name of Warner Lambert Co., example 4<br>
variant A,  column  5,  describes the synthesis of the  lower cyclic homologous<br>
derivative of gabapentin, l-(methylamino)-l-cyclopentane acetic acid, through the<br>
preparation of cyclopentane diacetic acid monoamide, carried out by reaction of the<br>
corresponding anhydride with  a 20% aqueous solution of NH3,  the  Hofmann<br>
rearrangement of the monoamide thus obtained, acidification and extraction followed<br>
by a final purification step which consists in the elution through a basic ionic<br>
exchange resin and in re-crystallisation from alcohols.<br>
Substantially, the processes for the preparation of 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid<br><br>
monoamide described in the literature provide for the synthesis of the corresponding<br>
acid  and  the   subsequent  conversion  via anhydride  according to  conventional<br>
methods.<br>
The synthetic scheme can be summarised as follows:<br><br>
The international patent application WO 03/002517 in the name of Bromine Compounds describes a process for the synthesis of 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid monoamide which comprises the amination of the 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid anhydride with aqueous ammonia.<br>
The patent CN 1297885 (Hangzhou Shouxin Fine Chem) describes the preparation of 1,1-cyclohexil oxalic acid monoamide through the reaction of the corresponding anhydride with aqueous or gaseous ammonia in the presence of an organic solvent. Therefore, cyclohexane diacetic acid is a key substrate in the preparation of the monoamide and, hence, indirectly in the preparation of gabapentin end product. 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid is prepared according to known techniques which refer to literature articles from the start of the l ast century. The synthetic scheme can be summarised as follows:<br><br>
I: 2 NC-CH2-C02C2H5 + NH3 II: H2S04<br>
Thorpe, J. Chem. Soc. 1919, 115, 686-704, describes the synthesis of a,a'-dicyan-<br><br>
(3,p-pentamethylene glutarimide (hereafter, "dinitryl") starting from cyclohexanone,<br>
ethyl cyanoacetate and ammonia in alcoholic solution.<br>
Thorpe, J. Chem, Soc. 1911, 99, 445-446 describes the hydrolysis of intermediate<br>
dinitryl to 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid by dissolution in concentrated sulphuric<br>
acid.<br>
The same synthetic scheme is described in A.I. Vogel, J. Chem. Soc. 1934, 1768-<br>
1765 and in the patents FR 1.248.764 in the name of Centre de Lyophilisation<br>
Pharmaceutique, GB 898.692 in the name of Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical and in<br>
the aforementioned Chinese patent CN 1297885 (Hangzhou Shouxin Fine Chem).<br>
The US Patent 6,613,904 describes a process for the preparation of the intermediate<br>
dinitryl compound which comprises the reaction of a ketone such as, for example,<br>
cyclohexanone with ethylcyanoacetate in the presence of ammonium hydroxide.<br>
A recent international patent application WO 03/002504 describes a process for the<br>
preparation of 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid starting from  l,5-dicarbonitryl-2,4-<br>
dioxo-3-azaspiro[5,5]-undecane (imide) by reaction with sulphuric acid in two steps<br>
at different temperature.<br>
The US Patent application US 2004/0063997 describes a process for the synthesis of<br>
gabapentin hydrochloride which comprises the reaction of a mixture of acetic<br>
anhydride/ammonium  acetate  with   1,1 -cyclohexane  diacetic  acid  to  yield  3,3-<br>
pentamethylene-glutarimide, the treatment of said imide with sodium hydroxide until<br>
dissolution, the dripping of the solution thus obtained in a mixture of sodium<br>
hydroxide/sodium hypochlorite and acidification with hydrochloric acid.<br>
Therefore, according to the literature, the preparation of 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic<br>
acid monoamide is subordinated to the isolation and to the conversion of the<br>
corresponding acid.<br>
Consequently, it becomes necessary to study alternative methods which allow to<br>
prepare   1,1-cyclohexane  diacetic  acid  monoamide  with  a  reduced   number  of<br>
synthetic steps and, hence, under more favourable conditions from the viewpoint of<br>
the industrial application of the process.<br><br>
We have now surprisingly found a method of synthesis of 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic<br>
acid monoamide, intermediate in the preparation of gabapentin at the industrial level,<br>
which allows to overcome the drawbacks of the processes described by the prior art.<br>
Therefore, object of the present invention is a process for the preparation of 1,1-<br>
cyclohexane diacetic acid monoamide which comprises the basic hydrolysis reaction<br>
of α,α'-diaminocarbonyl-β,β pentamethylene glutarimide.<br>
The preparation of a,a'-diaminocarbonyl-β,β-pentamethylene glutarimide (hereafter,<br>
"diamide") is carried out by reaction of a solution of dinitryl with sulphuric acid at a<br>
temperature comprised between 65 and 85°C as described in the aforementioned<br>
international patent application WO 03/002504.<br>
In the aforesaid patent application, the diamide is described as an intermediate in the<br>
preparation   of   1,1 -cyclohexane   diacetic   acid,   but   it   is   neither   isolated   nor<br>
characterised, as proven by the fact that it has not been attributed a Registry Number<br>
by the Chemical Abstract Service.<br>
Therefore,   a  further  object  of the   present  invention   is  the  compound  α,α'-<br>
diaminocarbonyl-β,β pentamethylene glutarimide in solid form.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the diamide is prepared through dinitryl hydrolysis with a<br>
sulphuric acid solution followed by neutralisation of the obtained solution and by<br>
precipitation of the product.<br>
The hydrolysis reaction is generally carried out by adding dinitryl to an aqueous<br>
solution of sulphuric acid.<br>
The dinitryl addition to the water/sulphuric acid solution is preferably carried out in<br>
portions.<br>
Each portion is preferably added after solubilisation of the previous portion at a<br>
temperature around 60°C in order to control the exothermy of the reaction.<br>
The hydrolysis reaction is carried out at a temperature comprised between 25 and<br>
70°C and it is preferably carried out at a temperature between 50 and 60°C.<br>
Maintaining temperature below 70°C and preferably around 50°C in the phase that<br>
precedes neutralisation allows to minimise the formation of by-products.<br><br>
The hydrolysis reaction of dinitryl takes place by reaction with sulphuric acid<br>
generally used in aqueous solution at a concentration comprised between 75% and<br>
85% and preferably with sulphuric acid in aqueous solution at a concentration around<br>
85%.<br>
The molar ratio between sulphuric acid and dinitryl is generally comprised between<br>
4.4 and 9.3 and preferably between 6.1 and 7.5 in order to optimise yield (on average<br>
around 90-95%) and limit scraps.<br>
The  neutralisation  reaction  is carried out with a water/sulphuric acid mixture,<br>
preferably in a weight ratio comprised between 0.65 and 1.8 and yet more preferably<br>
around   1,   in   order   to   optimise   the   reaction   conditions   promoting   diamide<br>
precipitation.<br>
To obtain an easily filterable product, it is preferable that the reaction mixture be<br>
added to the water used in neutralisation and not vice versa.<br>
Moreover, said procedure allows better control on the thermal development of the<br>
reaction.<br>
By this method, a highly pure product is obtained.<br>
Therefore,   a   further  object  of the   present   invention   is  the   compoundα α’ -<br>
diaminocarbonyl-β, β-pentamethylene glutarimide in solid form with a purity higher<br>
than 95%.<br>
The diamide basic hydrolysis reaction, object of the present invention, to yield the<br>
1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid monoamide is generally carried out by reaction with a<br>
solution of sodium hydroxide.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, hydrolysis is carried out according to a method in which<br>
three distinct phases can be identified:<br>
a)	hydrolysis of a,a'-diaminocarbonyl-p,P-pentamethylene glutarimide to obtain<br>
α α’ -di-acid disodium salt;<br>
b)	decarboxylation to obtain pentamethylene-glutarimide;<br>
c)	hydrolysis of pentamethylene-glutarimide and precipitation of the product.<br>
It is preferable to proceed according to this method in order to limit the formation of<br><br>
salts such as,  for example, ammonium carbonate which could entail technical problems in the execution of the procedure.<br>
The process thus takes place according to the following synthetic scheme, where      only the main intermediates are shown:<br><br><br>
It is evident that the three steps identified by us are not procedurally binding.<br>
The intermediates of the monoamide preparation process can be isolated or not, with<br>
the consequent reduction of the number of steps required to obtain the product.<br>
The first step consists of diamide hydrolysis to yield the diacid disodium salt and it is     carried out by addition of the dry diamide at low temperature in a sodium hydroxide<br>
solution, preferably with a concentration around 30%, and heating for a few hours at<br>
reflux at a temperature around 105-110°C.<br>
The addition of diamide is preferably carried out at a temperature comprised between<br>
-5 and 5°C for better control of the reaction, considering the massive release of 1     gaseous ammonia.<br>
Once heating is complete, one has the complete formation of the diacid disodium salt<br>
and the nearly complete elimination of ammonia which is released by the reaction<br>
itself<br>
The sodium hydroxide/diamide molar ratio is preferably comprised between 3.5 and<br>
4, in light of its influence on reaction velocity.<br>
The compound a,a'-diaminocarbonyl-P,p-pentamethylene giutarimide di-sodium di-<br>
salt is new and constitutes a further object of the present invention.<br>
The second step comprises the decarboxylation of the diacid disodium salt to yield<br>
the imide of the 1,1-cyclo hexane diacetic acid.<br>
To optimise the decarboxylation step while keeping carbon dioxide development<br><br>
under control, the method is preferably carried out by addition of a solution formed<br>
by water and synthetic hydrochloric acid at a portion of about 15-20% by weight of<br>
the diacid disodium salt solution maintained at a temperature around 50°C and<br>
heating the reaction mixture to about 95°C. The imide crystallises to yield a<br>
suspension and thereto is then added, in about one hour, the remaining solution of<br>
diacid disodium  salt maintaining temperature around 95°C.  At the end of the<br>
addition, the suspension is maintained at temperature until the reaction is complete.<br>
The third step comprises the hydrolysis of the imide and the precipitation of the<br>
reaction product, i.e. 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid monoamide, by acidification.<br>
The hydrolysis reaction is carried out by adding sodium hydroxide preferably at a<br>
concentration comprised between 10 and 30% and bringing to reflux.<br>
The molar ratio between sodium hydroxide and diamide is preferably comprised<br>
between 3.8 and 4.7, considering the total moles used, and yet more preferably<br>
around a value of 4.3, in order to optimise the hydrolysis reaction and promote the<br>
subsequent precipitation of the product.<br>
The precipitation is generally carried out by adding hydrochloric acid, preferably<br>
synthetic.<br>
Preferably, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a precipitation co-solvent,<br>
e.g. isopropanol and ethyl acetate.<br>
Yet more preferably, it is carried out in the presence of isopropanol.<br>
To obtain a greater yield and productivity, an isopropanol/diamide weight ratio<br>
comprised between 0.5 and 1 is preferably used, and yet more preferably around 0.5.<br>
The acidification of the reaction mixture is generally carried out until obtaining a pH<br>
comprised between 2 and 6 and yet more preferably around a value of 4.0-4.5.<br>
The attainment of the optimal precipitation pH can be effected in two steps, e.g. by a<br>
first addition of acid until obtaining a pH around 6.5, followed by a second addition<br>
until reaching the predetermined pH.<br>
It is preferable that temperature at the end of the precipitation be maintained at<br>
values below 60°C for process yield optimisation.<br><br>
Preferably, temperature is maintained at around 50°C.<br>
The 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid monoamide thus obtained is transformed into gabapentin by known methods, e.g. by Hofmann rearrangement, acidification, extraction, purification of an aqueous solution of gabapentin hydrochloride on a strong cationic ionic exchange resin followed by recrystallisation as described in the international patent application WO 02/34709 in the name of the same Applicant. Therefore, a further object of the present invention is a process for the preparation of gabapentin which comprises the preparation of 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid monoamide by basic hydrolysis of α α’'-diaminocarbonyl-P,P-pentamethylene glutarimide.<br>
The process object of the present invention allows to obtain 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid monoamide directly from the dinitryl intermediate, avoiding isolation of 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid.<br>
The known preparation steps, which entail the conversion of the acid to monoamide via anhydride, are thereby eliminated.<br>
The process object of the present invention allows to obtain the 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid monoamide by fewer synthetic steps and, consequently, with reduced time and costs.<br>
By operating according to the method object of the present invention, a product is obtained which has similar characteristics to the one obtained with known methods, pure and suitable for the subsequent steps of gabapentin preparation. A practical embodiment of the process object of the present invention comprises the preparation of a water/sulphuric acid solution; addition of dinitryl in portions so that each portion is added after solubilising the preceding portion; a check of the end of the reaction; neutralization of the solution and the subsequent diamide isolation. Addition of the diimide at low temperature in a sodium hydroxide solution and heating the suspension thus obtained for a few hours at reflux whilst keeping ammonia release under control; decarboxylation of the diacid formed by adding a solution of water and synthetic hydrochloric acid at a portion of about 15-20% by<br><br>
weight of the diacid solution maintained at a temperature around 50°C and heating the reaction mixture to about 95°C; addition of the remaining diacid solution maintaining temperature around 95°C until the reaction is completed; hydrolysis of the imide by adding sodium hydroxide, bringing subsequently to reflux and the product precipitation by acidification. For better illustrating the invention the following examples are now given.<br>
Example 1 Synthesis of α α’ -diaminocarbonyl-β, β-pentamethylene glutarimide A basic reducer was collected to a reactor A, then 16.0 kg of demineralised water were charged and subsequently, maintaining temperature below 60°C, 135.8 kg (74.0 1) of sulphuric acid (96% w/w) were added with a metering pump. The loading line and the metering pump were washed with 1.6 kg of demineralised water.<br>
The washings were added to the solution already contained in the reactor A. The sulphuric acid solution was cooled to 25-30°C, then 12.5 kg of dry dinitryl were charged from a hatch.<br>
A suspension was obtained, which was heated to about 60°C.<br>
This temperature was maintained until obtaining a solution in about one hour and 12.5 kg of dry dinitryl were again added.<br>
The suspension thus obtained was brought to about 60°C and maintained at that temperature until dissolution in about 2 hours. An additional 12.5 kg of dry dinitryl were then added. The suspension thus obtained was brought and maintained to about 60°C. After about four hours, the reaction check was carried out. If the reaction check was within limits, the mixture was cooled to about 50°C. In a reactor B, 102.0 kg of demineralised water were charged.<br>
The water was heated to about 40-45°C, then, letting the temperature rise spontaneously to 50-55°C, the diamide solution contained in the reactor A was added in about 2-3 hours through a loading line.<br><br>
A dense, but suitable for agitation solution was obtained.<br>
In the reactor A were charged 11.1 kg of demineralised water and subsequently<br>
letting the temperature rise to 50-55°C, 11.1 kg (6.0 1) of sulphuric acid (96% w/w)<br>
were charged with anti-acid pump.<br>
The solution was maintained for about 10 minutes at 50-55°C and it was then added<br>
to the suspension formed in the reactor B through the loading line.<br>
In the reactor A were charged 14.0 kg of demineralised water, which after about 10<br>
minutes at 50-55°C were added to the suspension present in the reactor B through the<br>
loading line.<br>
The suspension in the reactor B was maintained at 50-55°C for about 30 minutes,<br>
then it was cooled to 15-20°C in about 1.5 hours.<br>
After at least one hour at 15-20°C, several centrifuging operations were carried out,<br>
washing the panel multiple times with demineralised water.<br>
Indicatively, a total of 180.0 kg of demineralised water were used for washings in the<br>
centrifuge.<br>
The mother liquors were constituted by 50%o sulphuric acid and were placed in<br>
plastic or metal drums, coated with anti-acid materials.<br>
About 60.5 kg of humid product were obtained which, dried under vacuum at 50°C,<br>
yield about 55.5 kg of dry product.<br>

Example 2 Synthesis ofα α’ '-dicarboxy-β, β-pentamethylene glutarimide di-sodium di-salt<br><br>
In a reactor C, 170.8 kg (128.4 1) of electrolytic soda were charged under intercepted<br>
vacuum.<br>
The loading line was washed with 1.5 kg of demineralised water which was loaded in<br>
reactor C.<br>
The reactor was vented with nitrogen, an then it was connected to an acid reducer.<br>
The electrolytic soda solution was cooled to about 0°C, then 90.0 kg of dry diamide<br>
were charged from the hatch.<br>
The suspension was heated in about one hour to 55°C and it was maintained at<br>
temperature until the solid was completely dissolved (about 10 minutes), then the<br>
solution  was brought to about   105°C  in about four hours.  The  solution was<br>
maintained at temperature for about half an hour, then it was cooled to about 50°C.<br>
Example 3 Synthesis of pentamethvlene glutarimide<br>
The solution obtained as described in the previous example was transferred at 50°C in a reactor D, then after weighing the solution about 37.9 kg (about 28.5 1) of solution of diacid sodium salt, corresponding to a portion of about 15% by weight of the reaction mixture, were charged in reactor C, whilst the rest of the solution was maintained at 50°C in reactor D.<br>
In reactor C were charged 70 kg of demineralised water letting temperature drop spontaneously, and subsequently 2.8 kg (2.4 1) of synthetic hydrochloric acid were charged by means of an anti-acid pump.<br>
The loading line and the anti-acid pump were washed with 11.5 kg of demineralised water and the washings were added to the solution contained in reactor C. The temperature inside reactor A was brought to about 95°C and it was maintained until the transformation from diacid sodium salt solution to imide suspension. Maintaining the temperature at about 95°C, about 215 kg (about 161.5 1) of diacid sodium salt solution, i.e. all of the solution left in reactor D, were charged in reactor C in about one hour. Reactor D and the loading line were washed with 12.0 kg of demineralised water.<br><br>
The washing was added to the reaction in reactor C.<br>
Temperature was maintained for about two hours, whereupon the suspension was<br>
cooled to about 80°C.<br>
Example 4 Synthesis of 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid monoamide<br>
25.7 kg (19.3 I) of electrolytic soda were charged in reactor C by means of metering pump.<br>
The temperature was brought to about 95°C and it was maintained until the complete dissolution of the solid, then the mixture was brought to reflux (101-105°C). Reflux was maintained for about six hours, then the reaction check was carried out. At the completion of the reaction, the solution was cooled to about 20°C with precipitation of a solid white flocculate, then, at temperature 45.0 kg (57.3) of isopropanol   were   charged   and   subsequently   in   about   one   hour,   maintaining temperature below 25°C, about 125 kg (107.7 1) of synthetic hydrochloric acid were charged until reaching a pH of 6.5 ± 0.2, measured with pH meter. Once the desired pH was reached, the suspension was heated to 35-40°C and it was maintained at this temperature until dissolution of the solid.<br>
At the completion of the dissolution, the solution was transferred into reactor E and subsequently 20 kg of demineralised water were charged in the reactor. The washing was kept under stirring for 5-10 minutes, then it was transferred into reactor E.<br>
The internal temperature of reactor E was regulated to about 35-40°C then, maintaining temperature, 40 kg (34.5 1) of synthetic hydrochloric acid were added in about one hour until reaching a pH of 4.0-4.5, measured with paper. The pH of the suspension was checked to be stable for at least 10-15 minutes, then the internal temperature of reactor E was brought to about 50°C and it was maintained for about 30 minutes.<br>
In about one and one half hours the suspension was cooled to about 15-20°C and after about one hour several centrifuging operations were carried out. The panel was<br><br>
washed twice with a mixture formed by isopropanol and water.<br>
In total, 23.6 kg (30 k) of isopropanol and 30 kg of demineralised water were used.<br>
After one washing with the alcoholic mixture, the panel was subjected to six<br>
washings with water.<br>
In total, 270 kg of demineralised water were indicatively used.<br>
78.0 kg of humid product were obtained, which after drying at about 50°C under<br>
vacuum yield about 59.0 kg of the desired dry product.<br>
Example 5 Synthesis of l-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane acetic acid<br>
The 1,1-cyciohexane diacetic acid monoamide thus obtained is transformed into gabapentin by known methods, e.g. by Hofmann rearrangement, acidification, extraction, purification of an aqueous solution of gabapentin hydrochloride on a strong cationic ionic exchange resin followed by recrystallisation as described in the international patent application WO 02/34709 in the name of the same Applicant.<br>
