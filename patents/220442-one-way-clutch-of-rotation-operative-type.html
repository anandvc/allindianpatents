DESCRIPTION<br>
ONE-WAY CLUTCH OF ROTATION OPERATIVE TYPE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a one-way clutch of rotation operative type used in automatic motor cycles or snow mobiles and providing a function of a one-way clutch when number of revolution exceeds a predetermined value.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In general, a one-way clutch includes outer and inner races which are rotated relative to each other and is designed so that rotational torque is transmitted only in one direction by engaging splugs or rollers for transmitting the torque between the outer race and the inner race with a cam surface provided on a track surface of the outer or inner race and an idle rotation is performed in a reverse direction.<br>
Among such one-way clutches, a one-way clutch in which rollers are disposed in pockets (recessed portions) provided in the inner or outer race and rotation is locked by a wedging action achieved by engaging the rollers with wedge portions in the pockets, depending upon a rotational direction, is<br><br>
1<br>
known.<br>
For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 53-8019 discloses an arrangement in which rollers are disposed in recessed portions provided in an outer race and, when the outer race is rotated in a clockwise direction, the rollers are locked in the recessed portions by a wedging action, thereby locking a rotation of the outer race with respect to an inner race.<br>
Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 52-100045 discloses an arrangement in which a roller and an auxiliary roller are disposed between an outer race and an input coupling so that, number of revolution exceeds a predetermined value, the auxiliary roller is urged against the roller by a centrifugal force.  In this case, when a rotation is caused by the urging force in a predetermined direction, the roller can be locked by a wedging action, thereby achieving a one-way clutch function.<br>
The arrangement disclosed in the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Publication No. 53-8019 is a general or normal one-way clutch using the rollers and this arrangement is not designed so that the locking is achieved in accordance with the number of revolution.<br>
Further, the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 52-100045 discloses the arrangement in which the locking is achieved in<br><br>
accordance with the number of revolution. However, since parts such as a plate for urging the roller or a roller carrying member is required, the number of parts is increased and since an installation space for a spring is required, a reduction in a diameter of the apparatus is limited.<br>
In addition, although a coil spring is used as the spring for biasing the roller, it is difficult to set spring constant of the coil spring to a smaller value within a limited space, and the coil spring may be expensive in comparison with an accordion spring.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a one-way clutch of rotation operative type in which the number of parts can be reduced and which is inexpensive and in which spring constant can be set to a smaller value and a design can be achieved within a limited space.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a one-way clutch of rotation operative type in which a weight member and a rolling member are operated smoothly.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to reduce dragging torque without making a one-way clutch of rotation operative type bulky.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Now, embodiments of the present invention will be fully explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, same elements are designated by the same reference numerals. It should be noted that the various embodiments are explained only to show the present invention as examples and are not intended to limit the present invention. (First embodiment)<br>
Fig. 1 is a front view of a one-way clutch of rotation operative type according to an embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 2 is an axial sectional view, taken along the line 2 - 2 in Fig. 1. A one-way clutch 1 of rotation operative type comprises an inner race 2 which is a hollow shaft having splines 2a on its inner periphery and adapted to be fitted onto a drive shaft (not shown) and an outer race 3 disposed radially outwardly of the inner race 2 in coaxial with the latter so that it can be rotated relative to the inner race. Further, as shown in both Figs. 1 and 2, an axially extending engagement tongue 26 is provided on an inner periphery of a cage 4 and is fitted into a recessed groove 25 formed in an inner periphery of the inner race 2, thereby securing the cage to the inner race 2.<br><br>
By engaging the engagement tongue 26 with the recessed groove 25, since a positional deviation of the cage can be prevented and a clearance between the outer and inner races can be maintained properly, even if the one-way clutch is subjected to any influence such as vibration, an engaging operation can be performed positively.<br>
In Fig. 3, a plurality of pockets 9 open to an inner peripheral surface 3a of the outer race 3 are equidistantly provided in an outer peripheral portion of the inner race 2 along a circumferential direction thereof.  Portions of the outer peripheral surface of the inner race 2 between the pockets 9 act as bearing portions 13 which are slidingly contacted with the inner peripheral surface 3a of the outer race 3. The bearing portion 13 acts as a bearing mechanism for supporting the outer race 3 and the inner race 2 and have the same function as the sliding bearing.<br>
A cam surface 11 (refer to Figs. 3 and 5) is formed on a part of an inner peripheral surface of each pocket 9, and a substantially cylindrical roller 7 as a rolling member for transmitting torque and a substantially cylindrical weight member 8 are housed in the pocket. Further, a biasing spring 5 for biasing the roller 7 toward a deeper direction of the depth of the cam surface 11, i.e. a non-engagement direction in which the roller 7 is not engaged<br><br>
between the cam surface 11 and the cylindrical inner peripheral surface of the outer race 3 thereby to cause an idle rotation of the one-way clutch is housed in the pocket 9.<br>
An accordion spring is used as the biasing spring 5, and, as shown in Fig. 6 in detail, by pinching a bent portion 14 of a column portion 10 of the cage by an attaching portion 15 of the biasing spring 5, the biasing spring 5 is attached to the cage column portion 10 of the cage 4. One end of the biasing spring 5 opposite to the attaching portion 15 acts as an urging portion 16 for urging the roller 7. Incidentally, although a coil spring can be used as the biasing spring 5, it is preferable that the accordion spring is used because it is difficult to set a spring constant of the coil spring smaller within a limited space and the coil spring is more expensive than the accordion spring.<br>
Fig. 2 is an axial sectional view showing a relationship between the inner race 2, outer race 3 and biasing spring 5 and illustrating the fact that the biasing spring 5 is held by the cage 4.<br>
Next, an operation of the one-way clutch of rotation operative type according to the illustrated embodiment will be explained with reference to Figs. 3, 4 and 5. Fig. 3 is a front view showing main parts of Fig. 1 and illustrating a condition of the<br><br>
roller prior to engagement (non-engagement condition), Fig. 4 is a schematic view showing a position of the roller in an inoperative in the first embodiment and Fig. 5 is a front view showing main parts, of Fig. 1 and illustrating an engagement condition of the roller.<br>
In the one-way clutch 1 of rotation operative type having the above-mentioned arrangement, from a non-rotation area to a low speed rotation area, the roller 7 dose not transmit the torque in both of relative rotational directions between the inner and outer races.  Fig. 3 shows this condition and, in this case, small gap d is created between the inner peripheral surface 3a of the outer race 3 and the roller 7. In this case, the weight member 8 is positioned in a substantially deepest portion of the pocket 9. Further, the roller 7 is biased by the biasing spring 5 so that the roller is contacted with both a weight member operating surface 12 provided on a part of a surface defining the pocket 9 and the cam surface 11, and the weight member 8 is positioned in a cavity surrounded by the roller 7, the weight member operating surface 12 defining the pocket 9 and the cam surface 11. The pocket 9 can contain at least one of the roller 7, weight member 8 and biasing spring 5.<br>
Fig. 4 shows this condition and, in this case, a<br><br>
small gap d2 is created between an outer peripheral surface 2a of the inner race 2 and the roller 7. Further, the weight member 8 is positioned in the substantially deepest portion of the pocket 9. In the inoperative condition of the weight member 8, the roller 7 is held on an outer peripheral edge portion of the pocket 9, i.e. at an inner diameter side portion of the outer peripheral surface 2a of the inner race 2.<br>
When the number of revolution is increased, the weight member 8 is subjected to a centrifugal force and is shifted from the non-engagement condition of Fig. 3 to a circumferential end surface formed on a side portion of the pocket 9 inclined so that a circumferential width of the pocket is gradually decreased toward an outer diameter direction, i.e. to the outer diameter side along the weight member operating surface 12, with the result that not only the centrifugal force acting on.the roller 7 itself and but also a centrifugal force (Fc) acting on the weight member 8 act on the roller 7, thereby generating a force (Fw) for urging the roller 7 up to a position where the roller can be engaged by the cam surface 11.  Fig. 5 shows such an engagement condition and, in this case, the roller 7 is engaged between the inner peripheral surface 3a of the outer race 3 and the cam surface 11.<br><br>
Further, when the number of revolution exceeds a predetermined value, a sufficient urging force acts on the roller 7, thereby creating a condition that the function of the one-way clutch 1 of rotation operative type can be performed, i.e. a lock-up permitting condition. That is to say, in this condition, in a case where it is considered that the inner race 2 is in a fixed condition in Fig. 5, when the outer race 3 is rotated in an anti-clockwise direction in Fig. 5 an idle rotation condition (non-engagement condition) is achieved and, whereas, when the outer race is rotated in a clockwise direction an engagement condition is achieved, thereby transmitting the torque between the inner and outer races.<br>
Further, in Fig. 5, a circle CI passing through a center of the rocker 7 is positioned at an outer diameter side of a circle C2 passing through a contact point between the roller 7 and the weight member 8. Further, the weight member operating surface 12 is provided on one of radially extending surfaces constituting the pocket 9. The cavity defined by the roller 7 as the rolling member, weight member 8 and weight member operating surface 12 is smaller than the weight member 8. That is to say, the contact point between the roller 7 and the weight member 8 is always positioned at the inner diameter<br><br>
side more than the center of the roller 7 as center reference of the inner race 2 or the outer race 3.<br>
By the way, in order to prevent the weight member 8 from being pinched between the roller 7 and the weight member operating surface 12, the weight member operating surface has a predetermined wedge<br>
angle 0. The wedge angle 0 is an angle formed between a tangential line at the contact point (between the weight member 8 and the roller 7) and the weight member operating surface 12 is varied with a ratio of diameters of the weight member 8 and the roller 7. A non-wedge acting surface 21 inclined greater than the cam surface 11 is formed on the pocket surface at the outer diameter side from the cam surface 11 and opposite to the weight member 8, The non-wedge acting surface 21 is shallower than the cam surface 11, i.e. is set to have inclination greater than the cam surface 11.  If excessive torque acts on the roller 7, the roller 7 is shifted to the non^wedge acting surface 21, with the result that the excessive torque is escaped by the non-wedge acting surface 21, thereby preventing the clutch from being damaged.<br>
In the one-way clutch 1 having the above-mentioned arrangement, the roller does not transmit the torque in the both relative rotational directions between the inner and outer races from the non-rotation area to the low speed rotation area.<br><br>
Further, there is the small gap between the inner peripheral surface 3a of the outer race 3 and the roller 7, and the roller 7 is held at the outer peripheral edge portion of the pocketf i.e. at the inner diameter portion more than the inner peripheral surface 3a of the outer race 3.<br>
Further, the roller 7 and the weight member 8 are formed as cylindrical shapes.<br>
According to the first embodiment, since the biasing spring biases the rolling member toward the non-engagement direction with respect to the cam surface and the weight member for urging the rolling member toward the engagement direction with respect to the cam surface while resisting the biasing force of the biasing spring by the centrifugal force is disposed in the pocket, a one-way clutch in which the number of parts can be reduced and which is inexpensive and in which the 3pring cQnstant can be set smaller and the design can be achieved within the limited space can be provided.<br>
Further, according to the first embodiment, the weight member can be operated smoothly and further the clutch can be prevented from being damaged even if the excessive torque acts on the rolling member. Furthermore, the applicable torque can be set greater. Further, the configuration can be simplified and can easily be manufactured.  Further, the weight member<br><br>
which has a simple configuration and can easily be manufactured can be obtained and, the working can become easier and cheaper in comparison with a case where the biasing spring is directly attached to the inner race and the like. (Second embodiment)<br>
Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be explained. Fig. 7 is a front view of a one-way clutch of rotation operative type according to a second embodiment of the present invention, Fig. 8 is a schematic view of a pocket portion, looked at from an outer diameter side in the second embodiment. A one-way clutch 130 of rotation operative type comprises an inner race 102 which is a hollow shaft having splines 102a on its inner periphery and adapted to be fitted onto a drive shaft (not shown) and an outer race 103 disposed radially outwardly of the inner race 102 in coaxial with the latter so that it can be rotated relative to the inner race 102.<br>
In the second embodiment, a pocket for containing a roller, a weight member and an accordion spring which constitute a one-way clutch portion is constituted by an outer peripheral surface of the inner race 102 and a window portion 143 provided in a cage 132.<br>
A substantially annular cage 132 disposed<br><br>
between the outer race 103 and the inner race 102 is a cage body and a substantially annular support plate 134 is provided on an axial end surface of the cage 132. The support plate 134 is secured to the cage 132 by a cage joining portion 133.<br>
As shown in Figs. 7, 8 and 10f bearing portions 120 which can be slidingly contacted with an inner peripheral surface 103a (refer to Figs. 14, 15 and 18) of the outer race 103 are provided on a portion of the cage 132 facing the outer race 103. The bearing portions 120 have a function for supporting the inner race 102 and the outer race 103 in a coaxial relationship.  Further, the bearing portions 120 having a predetermined circumferential length are equidistantly disposed between the window portions 143 in a circumferential direction.<br>
Each of the window portions 143 provided in the cage 132 equidistantly in the circumferential direction contains an accordion spring 135 for biasing a roller 137 from a substantially tangential direction, the roller 137 for transmitting torque between the outer race 103 and the inner race 102 and a weight member 138 for acting on the roller 137 and for urging the roller 137 toward an engagement direction. When the weight member 138 does not act, a part of the weight member 138 is housed in a recessed portion 131 provided in the outer peripheral<br><br>
surface of the inner race 102. An inner peripheral edge of the support plate 134 is positioned at an outer diameter side more than the recessed portion<br>
131	and communication portions 106 are formed so that<br>
parts of the weight members 138 can be seen. With<br>
these communication portions 106, after the apparatus<br>
(one-way clutch of rotation operative type) was<br>
assembled, presence/absence of the weight member(s)<br>
138 can easily be ascertained by the manufacture's<br>
eyes, thereby facilitating the checking of defective<br>
clutches.<br>
Recessed portions 136 having laid U-shaped radial cross-section are formed in the cage 132, and an end of the accordion spring 135 opposite to an end for applying the biasing force to the roller 137 is fitted into and held by each recessed portion 136 (refer to Fig. 10).<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 8, the window portion 143 of the cage 132 is formed by drilling the cage<br>
132	in an axial direction while remaining a wall<br>
portion. An axial open end of the window portion 143<br>
is closed by the support plate 134. Accordingly, the<br>
accordion spring 135, roller 137 and weight member<br>
138 housed in the window portion 143 are held axially<br>
■ by the wall of the cage 132 and the support plate 134 and held radially by the outer race 103 and the inner race 102 so that these elements cannot be dislodged<br><br>
from the window portion 143.<br>
Fig. 9 is an axial sectional view of the one-way clutch 130 of rotation operative type.  It can be seen that the support plate 134 is secured with respect to the cage 132 by the cage joining portion 133. Further, it can be seen that the roller 137 has a small clearance between the wall portion of the cage 132 and the support plate 134 and is supported in an axial direction.<br>
Next, an operation of the one-way clutch 130 of rotation operative type according to the second embodiment will be explained with reference to Figs. 10 to 12. Fig. 10 is a view showing conditions of the roller and the weight member from the non-rotation to the low speed rotation in the second embodiment, Fig. 11 is a view showing the conditions of the roller and the weight member in the operative position (engagement condition) in the second embodiment and Fig. 12 is a view showing the conditions of the roller and the weight member in an eccentric condition (when subjected to over-torque) in the second embodiment.<br>
Here, the arrangement of the second embodiment will be explained in mode detail with respect to Fig. 10. The cage 132 includes a plurality of protruded portions 144 fitted into a plurality of recessed portions 145 provided in the outer peripheral surface<br><br>
of the inner race 102 equidistantly disposed along a circumferential direction thereof. Since the protruded portions 144 are fitted into the recessed portions 145, the cage 132 and the inner race 102 cannot be moved relative to each other. That is to say, the recessed portions 145 and the protruded portions 144 constitute a rotation preventing mechanism for preventing the relative rotation between the cage 132 and the inner race 102.<br>
A weight member operating surface 140 is formed on one of side surfaces of the window portion 143 of the cage 132. When weight member 138 is subjected to a centrifugal force, the weight member is shifted toward an outer diameter side along the weight member operating surface to contact and urge the roller 137, thereby shifting the roller 137 up to the engagement position. In this case, not only the centrifugal force acting on the roller 137 itself but also the centrifugal force acting on the weight member 137 act on the roller 137. A weight member locking portion 141 for limiting an operating range of the weight member38 is provided at the outer diameter side of the weight member operating surface 140 so that the weight member 138 cannot be shifted to a further outer diameter side. The weight member locking portion 141 is constituted by narrowing the space between the cage 132 and the outer peripheral surface<br><br>
of the inner race 102. Further, a roller locking portion (rolling member locking portion) 142 for limiting an operation range of the roller 137 toward the weight member 138 is provided at the outer diameter side of the weight member locking portion. In the illustrated embodiment, although the weight member operating surface 140, weight member locking portion 141 and roller locking portion 142 are contiguous to each other, they may not necessarily be contiguous.<br>
The recessed portion 131 for partially housing the weight member 138 is provided in the outer peripheral surface of the inner race 102 at a position opposed to a portion on which the weight member operating surface 140, weight member locking portion 141 and roller locking portion 142 of the cage 32 are formed, and a cam surface 147 as a torque transmitting surface for the roller 137 is formed in adjacent to the recessed portion 131, and a non-wedge acting surface 146 inclined greater than the cam surface is formed at the further outer diameter side of the cam surface 147 opposite to the recessed portion 131 of the cam surface 147. In the illustrated embodiment, although the recessed portion 131, cam surface 147 and non-wedge acting surface 14 6 are contiguous to each other, they may not necessarily be contiguous.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 10, from the non-rotation to the low speed rotation (area), the weight member 138 is positioned at the inner diameter side of the recessed portion 131 and is contacted with the roller 137, and the roller 137 is urged against the roller locking portion 142 by the accordion spring 135. Thereafter, the inner race 102 is rotated. When the rotational speed of the inner race reaches a high speed greater than the predetermined number of revolution, the weight member 138 subjected to the centrifugal force is shifted toward the outer diameter side, thereby shifting the roller 37 to the engagement position of the cam surface 147.  In this condition, when the inner race 102 is rotated with respect to the outer race 103 in an anti-clockwise direction in a preceding manner, the torque is transmitted. This operating condition is shown in Fig. 11. As shown in Fig. 11, the contact point between the roller 137 and the weight member 138 is positioned at the inner diameter side of the center of the roller 137. That is to say, a circle CI passing through the center of the roller 137 is positioned at the outer diameter side of a circle C2 passing through the contact point between the roller 137 and the weight member 138.<br>
Further, if the roller 137 is subjected to excessive torque, as shown in Fig. 12, the roller 137<br><br>
can be shifted to the non-wedge acting surface 146, thereby escaping the torque. Incidentally, in this case, the movement of the weight member 138 toward the cam surface 147 is limited by the weight member locking portion 141. Accordingly, the roller 137 is shifted toward the accordion spring 135, with the result that the contact between the roller 137 and the weight member 138 the movement of which is limited by the weight member locking portion 141 is released.<br>
Since the cage 132 according to the second embodiment is mainly made of resin and the roller 137 is mainly made of metal, coefficient of friction between the cage 132 and the cage 136 is reduced in comparison with a case where the cage 132 is made of metal, with the result that the roller 137 can be operated more smoothly.  Further, the entire weight can be reduced. The cage 132 can also be made of cast material or aluminum.<br>
Incidentally, from the non-rotation area to the low speed rotation area, the roller 137 does not transmit the torque in both relative rotational directions between the inner race and the outer race. As shown in Fig. 13, in the non-rotation condition, the roller 137 is held at the inner diameter side of the outer peripheral edge of the pocket 139. That is to say, a gap d3 is created between an outer<br><br>
peripheral edge portion 139 of the cage 132 and the roller 132. With this arrangement, even if minute eccentricity is created between the outer race and the inner race due to vibration in a rotation of an engine, an erroneous operation in which the roller is dragged by the inner peripheral surface of the outer race to be caught by the cam surface can be prevented, thereby providing smooth operations of the weight member and the rolling member. Further, dragging torque during the idle rotation can be reduced. (Third embodiment)<br>
Next, a third embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to Figs. 14 to 23.  In the third embodiment, a positional relationship between the weight member 138, roller 137 and accordion spring 135 and operations of these elements are substantially the same as those in the second embodiment. In the third embodiment, a shape of a cage greatly differs from that in the second embodiment.<br>
Now, the cage used in the third embodiment will be explained with reference to Figs. 20 and 21. Fig.<br>
20	is a development view of a first plate 160 of a cage 150 according to the third embodiment and Fig.<br>
21	is a development view of a second plate 170 of the cage 150 according to the third embodiment.<br>
In the third embodiment, the cage 150 is formed<br><br>
as the first and second plates by blanking a plate-shaped steel plate. Fig. 20 is a development view of the first plate 160. The first plate 160 includes a plurality of protruded portions extending radially from a substantially annular body 166. Each protruded portion comprises a first column portion 151 and a hole 162 for attaching the accordion spring 135.<br>
Caulking holes 164 for connection to the second plate 70 which will be described later are formed in the body 166.  Further, two engagement tongues 165 for securing the cage 150 to the inner race 102 are provided at an inner diameter direction of the body 166. It is preferable that the caulking holes 164 and the engagement tongues 165 are equidistantly disposed along a circumferential direction. The engagement tongues 165 are fitted in recessed grooves 154 of the inner race 102 to secure the entire cage to the inner race 102. That is to say, the recessed grooves 154 and the engagement tongues 165 constitute a rotation preventing mechanism for preventing a relative rotation between the cage 150 and the inner race 102.<br>
Fig. 21 is a development view of the second plate 170. The second plate 170 includes a plurality of protruded portions extending radially from a substantially annular body 175. Each protruded<br><br>
portion comprises a second column portion 172 and a caulking projection 171, and a weight member operating surface 152 (described later) is formed between the second column portion 172 and the projection 171.<br>
Two engagement tongues 174 for securing the cage 150 to the inner race 102 are provided at an inner diameter direction of the body 175. It is preferable that the protruded portions and the engagement tongues 174 are equidistantly disposed along a circumferential direction. The cage 150 according to the third embodiment (refer to Figs. 14 and 15) is obtained by bending the first plate 160 and the second plate 170 to desired shapes and then by joining both plates together.<br>
Next, a one-way clutch 180 of rotation operative type according to the third embodiment will be fully explained with reference to Figs. 14 to 19. Fig. 14 is a front view of the one-way clutch 180 of rotation operative type according to the third embodiment and Fig. 15 is an axial sectional view of the one-way clutch 180 of rotation operative type according to the third embodiment. Further, Fig. 16 is a view showing the roller and the weight member from the non-rotation to the low speed rotation in the third embodiment, Fig. 17 is a schematic view showing a position of the roller in the inoperative condition<br><br>
in the third embodiment, Fig. 18 is a view showing the roller and the weight member in the operating condition (engagement condition) in the third embodiment, and Fig. 19 is a view showing the conditions of the roller and the weight member in an eccentric condition (when subjected to over-torque) in the third embodiment.<br>
In Fig. 14, the cam surface 147 and the non-wedge operating surface 146 (Figs. 16, 18 and 19) provided on the outer peripheral surface of the inner race 102 are substantially the same as those in the first embodiment. The third embodiment differs from the second embodiment in the point that the operating surface for the weight member 138 and the like are formed in the protruded portion provided on the first or second plate constituting the cage 150.<br>
By fitting the caulking projections 171 of the second plate 170 into the caulking holes 164 of the first plate 160 and by performing the caulking, the cage 150 is formed via jointed portions 153. The protruded portions of the second plate 170 are bent to be positioned at the inner periphery of the outer race 103, thereby forming the weight member operating surfaces 152 having predetermined inclination with respect to the radial direction and the weight member locking portion 155.  The weight member locking portion 155 is constituted by narrowing the space<br><br>
between the cage 150 and the outer peripheral surface of the inner race 102.<br>
Fig. 15 is an axial sectional view of Fig. 14. It can be seen that the cage 150 comprises the first plate 160 and the second plate 170.<br>
Next, an operation of the one-way clutch 180 according to the third embodiment will be explained with reference to Figs. 16 and 19. The fundamental operation is the same as that in the second embodiment. As shown in Fig, 16, from the non-rotation to the low speed rotation (area), the weight member 138 is positioned at the inner diameter side of the recessed portion 131 and the roller 137 is urged toward the non-engagement direction by the accordion spring 135.<br>
Fig. 17 shows this condition. In this case, a small gap d4 is created between an outer peripheral edge of the second plate 170 and the roller 137.  In the inoperative condition of the weight member 138, the roller 137 is held at the outer peripheral edge portion of the pocket, i.e. at the inner diameter side of the outer peripheral edge of the cage 150.<br>
Thereafter, the inner race 102 is rotated. When the rotational speed of the inner race reaches a high speed greater than the predetermined number of revolution, the weight member 138 subjected to the centrifugal force is shifted toward the outer<br><br>
diameter side along the weight member operating surface 152, thereby shifting the roller 137 to the engagement position of the cam surface 147. In this condition, when the inner race 102 is rotated with respect to the outer race 103 in an anti-clockwise direction in a preceding manner, the torque is transmitted. This operating condition is shown in Fig. 18.<br>
Further, if excessive torque acts on the roller 137, as shown in Fig. 19, the roller 137 can be shifted to the non-wedge acting surface 146 to escape the torque. Incidentally, in this case, the weight member 138 is blocked by t,he weight member locking portion 155, so that the movement of the weight member toward the cam surface 147 is limited. Accordingly, the roller 137 is shifted toward the accordion spring 135, with the result that the contact between the roller and the weight member 138 the movement of which is limited by the weight member locking portion 155 is released.  Incidentally, in a non-eccentric condition, the inner peripheral surface 103a of the outer race 103 is displaced to a position 103b.<br>
Here, a relationship between the cage 150 and the accordion spring 135 is as follows. Fig. 22 is a schematic view of the pocket portion, looked at from the outer diameter side in the second embodiment.<br><br>
Fig. 23 is a front view of the accordion spring attaching portion in the third embodiment.<br>
As shown in Fig. 22, a distal end of the accordion spring 135 is an abutment portion 158 for urging the roller 137 and a proximal end of the accordion spring is an attaching portion 157. The accordion spring 135 is secured to the cage 150 by pinching the first column portion 151 by means of the attaching portion 157. Further, the accordion spring 135 is secured further firmly by engaging a tongue<br>
156	provided by notching on the attaching portion<br>
with the hole 162, thereby preventing the<br>
dislodgement.<br>
An attaching condition of the attaching portion<br>
157	of the accordion spring 135 is shown in Fig. 23<br>
and it can be seen that the tongue 156 provided on<br>
the distal end of the attaching portion 157 is fitted<br>
into the hole 162 of the first plate 160 of the cage.<br>
According to the third embodiment, the cage 150 can<br>
be made of steel, synthetic resin or aluminum.<br>
Further, since a thickness of the cage can be reduced<br>
totally in comparison with the cage of the first<br>
embodiment, the weight of the one-way clutch can be<br>
reduced.  Further, the manufacturing cost can be<br>
reduced accordingly.<br>
Further, from the non-rotation to the low speed rotation area, the roller 137 does not transmit the<br><br>
torque in both relative rotational directions between the inner and outer races. The small gap is created between the outer peripheral edge of the second plate 170 and the roller 137 and, in the inoperative condition of the weight member 138, the roller 137 is held at the outer peripheral edge portion of the pocket, i.e. at the inner diameter side of the outer peripheral edge of the cage 150.<br>
According to the second and third embodiments, an erroneous operation in which, immediately after subjected to the excessive torque, the weight member is flown toward the cam surface and cannot be returned toward the weight member operating surface can be prevented.<br>
Further, since the deviation in the positioning of the cage and the circumferential deviation can be prevented and the frictional resistance between the cage and the weight member is relatively low, the smooth operation can be achieved. Further, the weight of the entire apparatus can be reduced. (Fourth embodiment)<br>
Fig. 24 is a front view of a one-way clutch 220 of rotation operative type according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 25 is an axial sectional view of the one-way clutch. The oneway clutch 220 of rotation operative type comprises an inner race 202 which is a hollow shaft having<br><br>
splines 202a on its inner periphery and adapted to be fitted onto a drive shaft (not shown) and an outer race 203 disposed radially outwardly of the inner race 202 in coaxial with the latter so that it can be rotated relative to the inner race 202. For convenience' sake of explanation, in this specification, "one-way clutch of rotation operative type" is also referred to merely as "one-way clutch" In Fig, 24, a plurality of pockets 209 open to an inner peripheral surface 203a of the outer race 203 are equidistantly provided in an outer peripheral portion of the inner race 202 along a circumferential direction thereof. A cam surface 206 is formed on a part of an inner peripheral surface of each pocket 209, and a substantially cylindrical roller 207 and a substantially cylindrical weight member 208 are housed in the pocket.  Further, a biasing spring 205 for biasing the roller 207 toward a deeper direction of the depth of the cam surface 206, i.e. a non-engagement direction in which the roller 207 is not engaged between the cam surface 206 and the cylindrical inner peripheral surface of the outer race 203 thereby to cause an idle rotation of the one-way clutch 220 is housed in the pocket 209. The weight member 208 is housed in a recessed portion 211 provided in the outer peripheral surface of the inner race 202.<br><br>
Fig. 25 is an axial sectional view showing a relationship between the inner race 202, the outer race 203 and a cage 204. It can be seen that the cage 204 is constituted by a first plate 230 and a second plate 240.<br>
Fig. 26 is a view for explaining the one-way clutch 220 from the non-rotation to the low speed rotation (area). From the non-rotation to the low speed rotation (area), the weight member 208 is positioned at an inner diameter side of the recessed portion 211 to be contacted with the roller 207, and the roller 207 is urged toward the non-engagement direction by the accordion spring 205.<br>
Thereafter, the inner race 202 is rotated. When the rotational speed of the inner race reaches a high speed greater than the predetermined number of revolution, the weight member 208 subjected to the centrifugal force is shifted toward the outer diameter side along a weight member operating surface 221 while rolling or sliding, thereby shifting the roller 207 to the engagement position of the cam surface 206. In this condition, when the outer race 203 is rotated with respect to the inner race 202 in a clockwise direction in a preceding manner, the torque is transmitted. This condition is shown in Fig. 27. A contact point between the roller 207 and the weight member 208 is positioned at the inner<br><br>
diameter side of the center of the roller 207. That is to say, a circle CI passing through the center of the roller 207 is positioned at the outer diameter side of a circle C2 passing through the contact point between the roller 207 and the weight member 208.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 28, in the non-rotation condition, the roller 207 is positioned at the inner diameter side of an outer peripheral edge 209 of the pocket. That is to say, a gap d5 is created between the outer peripheral edge portion 209 of the cage 204 and the roller 207. With this arrangement, even if minute eccentricity is created between the outer race and the inner race due to vibration in a rotation of an engine, an erroneous operation in which the roller is dragged by the inner peripheral surface of the outer race to be caught by the cam surface can be prevented, thereby providing smooth operations of the weight member and the rolling member. Further, dragging torque during the idle rotation can be reduced.<br>
Next, the cage 204 used in this embodiment will be explained with reference to Figs. 29 and 30. Fig. 29 is a development view of a first plate of the cage 204 of the present invention and Fig. 30 is a development view of a second plate 240 of the cage 204.<br>
In this embodiment, the cage 204 is formed as<br><br>
the first and second plates by blanking a plate-shaped steel plate. As shown in Fig. 27, the first plate 230 includes a plurality of protruded portions extending radially from a substantially annular body 236. Each protruded portion comprises a first column portion 232 and a hole 231 for attaching the accordion spring 205.<br>
Caulking holes 234 for connection to the second plate 24 0 which will be described later are formed in the body 236.: Further, two engagement tongues 235 for securing the cage 204 to the inner race 202 are provided at an inner diameter direction of the body 236. It is preferable that the protrude portions, caulking holes 234 and engagement tongues 235 are equidistantly disposed along a circumferential direction in order to disperse stress acting on the cage and suppress locally concentrating stress. The engagement tongues 235 are fitted in recessed grooves 215 (refer to Fig. 24) of the inner race 202 to secure the entire cage to the inner race 202.<br>
As shown in Fig. .30, the second plate 240 includes a plurality of protruded portions extending radially from a substantially annular body 246. Each protruded portion comprises a second column portion 242 and a caulking projection, i.e. a pawl 241, and the pawl 241 and a weight member operating surface 221 are formed on the second column portion 242.<br><br>
As mentioned above, the cage 204 comprising the first plate 230 and the second plate 240 is assembled as follows. By fitting the pawls 241 formed on the distal ends of the second column portions 242 of the second plate 240 having the weight member operating surfaces 221 into the caulking holes 234 provided in the first plate 230 and by performing the caulking, both plates are joined together. The cage 204 after the joining is shown in Figs. 24 and 25.<br>
The pawl 241 is provided at a position where the weight member operating surface 221 is formed or at an outer* diameter side of such a position, looked at from a front side of the one-way clutch 22 (Fig. 24) . With this arrangement, since a portion near a position directly subjected to a force from the weight member 208 is fixed or secured, bending moment subjected from the weight member operating surface 221 is reduced.<br>
Figs. 31 and 32 show a relationship between the cage 204 and the accordion spring 205 and, particularly, Fig. 31 is a schematic view of the pocket portion, looked at from an inner diameter side in the present invention and Fig. 32 is a front view an accordion spring attaching portion in the present invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 31, a distal end portion of the accordion spring 2 05 constitutes an abutment portion<br><br>
216	for urging the roller 207 and a proximal end<br>
constitutes an attaching portion 217. By pinching<br>
the first column portion 232 by means of the<br>
attaching portion 217, the accordion spring 205 is<br>
secured to the cage 204. Further, the accordion<br>
spring 205 is secured further firmly by engaging a<br>
tongue 218 provided by notching on the attaching<br>
portion 217 with the hole 231, thereby preventing the<br>
dislodgement.<br>
An attaching condition of the attaching portion<br>
217	of the accordion spring 205 at a front side is shown in Fig. 32 and it can be seen that the tongue<br>
218	provided on the distal end of the attaching portion 217 is fitted into the hole 231 of the first plate 230 of the cage 204. Although the inner race 202 is made of steel material, since the cage 204 can be made of synthetic resin or aluminum, the weight of the one-way clutch can be reduced. Further, the manufacturing cost can be reduced accordingly.<br>
Further, in a case where the one-way clutch is used in an automatic motor cycle, although the oneway clutch is used under a high speed condition such as about 10000 rpm, since the centrifugal force acting on the weight members in such a circumstance becomes an issue, it is feared that the weight member operating surfaces formed by bending the cage would be torn up. By constructing as the illustrated<br><br>
embodiment, such possibility can be prevented.<br>
According to the fourth embodiment, a one-way clutch of rotation operative type in which strength sufficient to endure the usage under the high speed rotation can be achieved and the number of parts is reduced and which is inexpensive and in which the spring constant can be set smaller, dimensional accuracy can easily be obtained, possibility of catching the weight members can be eliminated and a design can be achieved within a limited space can be provided. (Fifth embodiment)<br>
Fig. 33 is a front view of a one-way clutch of rotation operative type according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 34 is an axial sectional view taken along the line 34 - 34 in Fig. 33. A one-way clutch 501 of rotation operative type comprises an inner race 502 which is a hollow shaft having splines 502a on its inner periphery and adapted to be fitted onto a drive shaft (not shown) and an outer race 503 disposed radially outwardly of the inner race 502 in coaxial with the latter so that it can be rotated relative to the inner race 502.<br>
Substantially cylindrical rolling members or roller 507 and substantially cylindrical weight members 508 are disposed between the outer race 503<br><br>
and the inner race 502. Further, biasing springs 505 are positioned to urge the respective rollers 507. Each biasing spring 505 serves to directly urge the corresponding roller 507 toward a direction along which a distance between a cam surface 512 (Fig. 35) and a cylindrical inner peripheral surface 503a of the outer race 503 is widened, i.e. a non-engagement direction for providing an idle rotation of the oneway clutch 501.<br>
Side plates 504 for holding the biasing springs 505, roller 507 and weight members 508 to prevent these elements from dislodging in an axial direction is provided between the outer race 503 and the inner race 502. As shown in Fig. 34, the side plate 504 comprises a first portion 504a substantially covering the biasing springs 505, roller 507 and weight members 508 in a radial direction and an annular second portion 504b disposed at an axial one end, and the first portion 504a and the second portion 504b are integrally joined by caulking or the like. The caulking is achieved by bending a distal end of a column portion 513 bent axially from one side plate portion and by pinching the other side plate portion between the bent distal end and other portion of the column portion.<br>
The side plate 504 has an engagement tongue 510 at its radial inner diameter side so that, by fitting<br><br>
the engagement tongue 510 into a recessed portion 511 provided in the inner periphery of the inner race 502, the side plate is held in a fixed condition with<br>
respect to the inner race. The side plate is<br>
-i<br>
attached to the outer race 503 with predetermined clearance therebetween.<br>
As shown in Fig. 33, a plurality of elongated holes 506 disposed equidistantly in a circumferential direction are formed in an axial annular portion of the first portion 504a of the side plate 504, and the weight members 508 are housed in the respective elongated holes 506 (refer to Figs. 35 and 36). An outer peripheral surface (supported portion 523; refer to Fig. 40) of a first cylindrical portion 521 of the weight member 508 is supported by an inner periphery of the elongated hole 506 so that the weight member can be moved within a longitudinal length of the elongated hole 506. Similar elongated holes 506 are also formed in the second portion of the side plate 504 at positions corresponding to the elongated holes of the first portion.<br>
Incidentally, in the specification, a term "side plate" means a structure which cannot prevent dislodgement, so long as it is assembled to the outer race, only by supporting the rolling members and the weight members laterally in the axial direction.<br>
Next, an operation of the one-way clutch 501 of<br><br>
rotation operative type of the present invention will be explained with reference to Figs. 35 and 36. As apparent from Fig. 33, the biasing spring 505 is attached to the column portion 503 to bias the roller 507 toward a deeper direction (non-engagement direction) of the cam surface 512.<br>
Fig. 35 shows the inner race 502 in the non-rotation condition and during the low speed rotation condition. In this case, since the roller 507 is urged by the biasing spring 505 to be positioned at the deep position of the cam surface 512, a gap is created at a portion shown by D between the roller<br>
507	and the outer race 503. Accordingly, the outer<br>
race 503 is in a condition that it can be rotated<br>
idly with respect to the inner race 502 in both<br>
directions.<br>
On the other hand, Fig. 36 shows a normal rotation condition. In this case, the weight member<br>
508	is subjected to the centrifugal force, with the<br>
result that the weight member 508 urges the roller<br>
507 toward the shallow position (engagement position)<br>
of the cam surface 512, i.e. toward the non-wedge<br>
acting surface 516. As a result, there is no gap at<br>
a position shown by E between the roller 507 and the<br>
outer race 503 and the biasing spring 505 is<br>
contracted by the centrifugal force acting on the<br>
weight member 508. Accordingly, in this case, the<br><br>
function of the one-way clutch 501 of rotation operative type is achieved, with the result that, when the outer race 503 tries to rotate in a clockwise direction in Fig. 36 relative to the inner race 502, the outer and inner races are locked by the torque transmission of the roller 507, whereas, when the outer race tries to rotate in an anti-clockwise direction, an idle rotation is generated.  In both conditions shown in Figs. 35 and 36, the biasing spring 505 directly applies the biasing force to the roller 507.<br>
An accordion spring is used as the biasing spring 505, and, as shown in Fig. 37 in detail, by pinching the column portion 513 of the side plate 504 by an attaching portion 514 of the biasing spring 505, the biasing spring 505 is attached to the side plate 504. One end of the biasing spring 505 opposite to the attaching portion 514 acts as an urging portion 517 for urging the roller 507. Incidentally, although a coil spring or the like can be used as the biasing spring 505, it is preferable that the accordion spring is used because it is difficult to set a spring constant of the coil spring smaller within a limited space and the coil spring may be more expensive than the accordion spring.<br>
Fig. 38 is a front view showing the biasing spring (accordion spring) 505 attached to the side<br><br>
plate 504. By engaging a locking piece 515 formed by notching the attaching portion 514 with a hole 518, the accordion spring 505 is secured more firmly.<br>
Next, the eight member 508 used in the fifth embodiment of the present invention will be explained in more detail with reference to Figs. 39 and 40. Fig. 39 is a side view of the weight member 508 and Fig. 40 is an upper view of the weight member 508. The weight member 508 comprises two substantially cylindrical portions. Namely, it comprises small diameter first cylindrical portions 521 and a large diameter second cylindrical portion 522 integrally formed with the first cylindrical portions.<br>
The first cylindrical portions 521 are shorter than the second cylindrical portion 522 and are formed on both axial ends of the second cylindrical portion 522 as supported portions 523 having a predetermined length. The supported portions 523 are supported in the elongated holes 506 formed in the side plate 504 on both axial sides. That is to say, the weight member 508 is shifted by shifting the supported portions 523 within the elongated holes 506.<br>
An outer peripheral surface of the large diameter second cylindrical portion 522 is contacted with the roller 507 to urge the roller 507. Incidentally, although the first cylindrical portions 521 are shown as solid members, hollow members may be<br><br>
used as the first cylindrical portions.<br>
According to the fifth embodiment, since the biasing spring directly biases the rolling member, a one-way clutch of rotation operative type in which the number of parts can be reduced and which is inexpensive and in which the spring constant can be set smaller and a design can be achieved within a limited space can be provided.<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiments, although it is considered that the weight member can be made of steel, copper, steel alloy, aluminum or synthetic resin, in a case where the weight member is made of material having high specific weight such as steel, since the centrifugal force acting on a unit area becomes great, even when the apparatus is compact, during the low speed rotation, engagement can be achieved. Further, the diameter of the weight member can be reduced.<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiments, while an example that the cylindrical roller is used as the rolling member disposed within the pocket was explained, a sphere may be used as the rolling member. Further, the weight member may be a sphere rather than the cylindrical roller.  Further, regarding a combination of the rolling member and the weight member, both of these members may be rollers or spheres, or one of these members may be a roller and<br><br>
the other may be a sphere.<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned embodiments, although the plurality of pockets are provided along the circumferential direction, the number of pockets can be varied with required torque capacity and the like, and, for example, four or six pockets may be provided other than eight pockets. However, regardless of the number of pockets, it is preferable that the pockets are disposed equidistantly along the circumferential direction. By doing so, since a reaction force acting on the inner race and subjected from the roller during the torque transmission can be dispersed, endurance of the inner race is enhanced and bearings (not shown) for supporting the outer and inner races can be prevented from being subjected to an excessive force.<br>
Further, in the embodiments, while an example that diameters of the roller and the weight member are substantially the same was explained, it is not necessary that such diameters are the same, and the diameters can be set voluntarily in accordance with a usage condition (for example, range of number of revolution in the operative condition).<br>
The one-way clutch of rotation operative type according to the present invention can be applied to four-wheel motor vehicles, as well as automatic motor cycles, snow mobiles and the like.<br><br><br>
