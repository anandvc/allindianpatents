COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
MEDICAL SUSPENSION SYSTEM WITH TWO SPINDLES<br>
STERIS INC. of 43425 BUSINESS PARK DRIVE, TEMECULA, CA 92590, U.S.A., AMERICAN Company AND ONDAL INDUSTRIETECHNIK GMBH of WELLASTRASSE 2-4, 36085 HUNFELD, GERMANY, GERMAN Company.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-                                                                                                      Granted<br><br>
MEDICAL SUSPENSION  SYSTEM WITH TWO SPINDLES<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the surgical lighting arts. It finds particular application in conjunction with mounting an auxiliary second spindle to a single ceiling plate supporting an existing first spindle in an operating room (OR) and will be described with particular reference thereto. It is to be appreciated, however, that the invention also finds application in conjunction with mounting other overhead secondary fixtures or devices to support systems that additionally support primary fixtures or devices and is not. limited to the aforementioned OR application.<br>
Typically, in an operating room setting, large, high lumen output lightheads are used to illuminate the surgical site. These rather large lightheads are supported on one or more jointed arms extending from a single central spindle attached to a ceiling plate. Each articulated arm is rotatable relative to the spindle and pivotable to allow independent positioning of the ax'tris and their attached devices. The number of lightheads or other accessories (e.g., video monitors, EKG monitors) tha.t can reasonably be supported in a stacked arrangement is limited by the height of the ceiling. Each additional support arm hub or accessory causes the central spindle to grow so that, the bottom end is lowered relative to the ceiling as additional arms are added.  At some point,<br><br><br>
the length of the spindle presents an obstacle or hazard to those working in the OR.<br>
When additional lightheads or accessories are desired, one option is to remove the existing ceiling plate that supports the central spindle and install a new ceiling plate adapted to support both the original central spindle as well as an auxiliary satellite spindle. This is only possible, however, in rooms with ceiling structures designed in advance for supporting the weight and moment of a two spindle system In any case, the above procedure involves a major construction job during which time the operating room is removed from service.<br>
The present invention provides a new and improved method and apparatus that overcomes the above referenced problems and others to provide an additional spindle utilizing an existing ceiling suppox-t.<br>
	Summary o£ the Invention<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a suspension system for suspending a plurality of devices from a support structure is provided The suspension system includes a ceiling plate configured for attachment to the support structure. A first spindle is carried by. the ceiling plate. The first spindle is configured for supporting at least a first device thereon. An adapter plate is configured for mounting to the ceiling plate. A second spindle is carried by the adapter plate. The second spindle is configured for supporting at least a second device thereon.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention,; an auxiliary assembly is provided. The assembly. includes an adapter plate configured for selective attachment to a ceiling plate. The ceiling plate supports a device for use in a surgical procedure. The adapter plate includes an inner surface which defines a hollow shaped to receive a spindle of the ceiling plate therethrough.  An articulated arm is operably connected<br><br><br>
with the adapter plate A device is mounted to the articulated arm, such that when the adapter plate ia attached to the ceiling plate, the device is suspended therefrom.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
With reference to Figure 1, a suspension system 10 suspends a plurality of medical devices 12, 14 from a rigid, immobile structural support 16, such as a ceiling support. The ceiling support 16 is preferably carried above a ceiling 17 by beams (not shown) or other rigid structures which support the ceiling of the operating room (OR) or are located above it such that the suspension system 10 extends below the ceiling.   The<br><br>
medical devices 12, 14 illustrated in Figure . 1 are lightheads for illuminating a work surface 18, such as an operating table and a surgical site on a patient 2 0 supported thereon. However, it will be appreciated that a variety of other devices 12, 14 such as video monitors, vital sign monitors, and the like, are alternatively or additionally mounted on the suspension system 10.<br>
With reference also to Figures 2-4, the suspension system 10 includes a generally circular ceiling plate 30, which is secured to the ceiling support 16 or other immobile structural support by several suitable fixing members 32, such as bolts, screws, rivets, or the like, which are mounted by suitably positioned holes 34 through the ceiling plate 30. The ceiling plate 30 is formed from a rigid material such as iron or steel and is of sufficient strength to support the weight of the medical devices 12, 14, which are supported therefrom.<br>
With continued reference to Figures 2-4, a first or central spindle 40 is secured to the ceiling plate 30. Figures 2-4 show the spindle 40 as being generally cylindrical in .shape 'and being centrally I mounted to a lower surface of the ceiling plate via a 1 cylindrical collar 42 of slightly larger diameter than the spindle, which may be welded or otherwise rigidly fixed to the ceiling plate 30. The spindle 40 is bolted or otherwise rigidly attached to the .collar 42. Other methods of fixing the central spindle to the ceiling-plate known in the art are also contemplated.<br>
With particular reference to Figures 1 and 2, an adjustable arm 50, such as a flexible and/or articulated arm is carried by the spindle 4 0 via a mounting hub 52. At least a portion of the mounting hub is rotatable, relative to the spindle. The arm 50 is thus movable to a selected position about an axis A of the ceiling plate 30. The first surgical support, apparatus 12, such as a lighthead (as illustrated), video monitor, EKG monitor, or other vital system monitor is<br><br>
attached ho a distal, end of the arm 50. The a.i.m 50 and the spindle 40 allow the surgeon to position the first aurgical support apparatus 12.in a plurality of different positions and orientations as needed. As shown in Figure 2, it is possible to extend the spindle 40 and add other devices 12 extending therefrom by stacking one or more additional spindle hubs along the axis A and thereby mounting one or more additional arms 50' (it will be appreciated that a single hub 52 optionally accommodates two or more arms 50) . However, the number of devices 12 that, can be added is generally limited by the length of the spindle 40 and the height of the ceiling 17 above the work surface 18 .<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 5-6, when it is desired to add a second spindle 60 to the system,  an adapter plate 62 is attached directly to the existing ceiling plate 30.  The adapter plate 62 is preferably in the shape of an incomplete circle and preferably has a diameter D substantially equal  to a diameter of the ceiling plate 30.  The adapter plate 62 defines an outer circumferential surface 64 which is preferably greater than 180° and less than 270" of an imaginary circle C of which it forms a part.  This provides for the weight of the second device 14 to be distributed over a large area of the ceiling plate 30, while providing room for the attachment of other devices 66,  68, such as a control board and a fuse block, directly to the. ceiling plate (see Figures 3-4) .   The adapter plate -62 defines an arcuately  shaped  hollow portion  70,  spaced  radially inward  from  the  circumferential  surface  64,  that accommodates  the  main  spindle  40  and  collar  42 therethrough.  In order to accommodate the spindle 40 and collar 42 and present a circumferential surface 64 which is larger than half of the ceiling plate 30, an inner edge 72 of the adapter plate 62 preferably spans less than or equal to 180° around the spindle 40, so that the adapter plate 6.4  may fit snugly against  the  spindle<br><br>
collar 42 and partially surround the spindle 40 without obstructing its own access to the spindle 40.<br>
As shown in Figures 2, 3 and 6, the adapter plate 62 is fixed directly to the ceiling plate 30. A lower surface 74 of the ceiling plate preferably lies flat against an adjacent, upper surface of the adapter plate although it is also contemplated that spacing members, may be interposed between the ceiling plate and adapter plate. Suitable securement members 80, such as nuts and bolts, screws, rivets, or other attachment mechanisms, are mounted through suitably positioned holes 82 in the adapter plate and corresponding holes 84 in the ceiling, plate to secure, the plates 30, 62 together.<br>
Preferably, the adapter plate 62 is selectively positionable so that the second spindle 60 is locatable in  one  of  a  plurality  (four  in  the  illustrated embodiment) of possible positions around the main spindle 40, each position being arcuately spaced  (90° in the illustrated embodiment) from the next position around the main  spindle  40,  as  illustrated  in  Figures  7a-7d, Accordingly,  the  ceiling plate  3 0  is provided with sufficient mounting holes 84 to allow the adapter plate to be mounted in any one of the selected positions.  This enables optimum positioning of the second spindle 62 and its associated device 14 with respect to the OR and equipment in the OR, e.g., where it will best benefit the surgeon' without interfering with positioning of devices 12 supported on the first spindle 40. Additionally, when the adapter plate 62 is located in any one of the four selected positions, electrical wiring feed through holes 86 in the adapter plate are. aligned with corresponding holes 88 in the ceiling plate 30 so that electrical wiring  89  and  the  Like  for  providing  power  or communicating with the device 12 can be passed through both the adapter plate 62 and ceiling plate 30.  Other sizes or" configurations of the adapter plate 62 are optionally  provided,  for  example,  auxiliary  spindle positions at angular increments other than 90°.<br><br>
The second spindle 60 is fixedly attached to the adapter plate 62 in a similar manner to the way in which the main spindle 4 0 is attached to the ceiling plate 30. As best shown in Figures 8 and 9, the adapter plate includes a collar 90, rigidly attached thereto, analogous to the collar 42 for the .main spindle 40. In the case of the auxiliary spindle 60, the spindle is mounted exteriorly of the. collar 90, by securement members 92, such as screwy, bolts, or the like, although it will be appreciated that the collar 90 may be radially outward of the spindle 60, as for the main spindle. In yet another embodiment, the collar is eliminated and the spindle is mounted directly to the adapter plate, for example by welding or with suitable securement means, such as bolts, screws, rivets, or the like.<br>
The spindle may include a cylindrical mounting member 94, which is received in an opposite end of the spindle 60 to the collar 90 and attached thereto by similar securement members 96. A similar cylindrical mounting member (not shown) is optionally also associated with the main spindle. A second adjustable arm assembly 98, analogous to arm assembly 50, is mounted at a proximal end or hub 100 thereof to the spindle 60 via the cylindrical member 94. At least a portion 101 of the hub 100 is rotatable relative to the spindle, as shown by arrow R, about an axis D through the spindle (Figure 9) .<br>
 The second device 14 is mounted to a distal end of the arm 98 As for the first spindle 40, additional arms (not shown) are optionally mounted to the spindle 60 in a similar manner to that shown in Figure 2. The adapter plate 62, device 14, arm 98, and interconnections therebetween, comprise an auxiliary assembly 102, which . may be provided as an assembled unit for attachment to the ceiling plate 30, or as separate components for assembly at the OR site.<br>
As will be appreciated, the first device 12 is carried solely by the ceiling plate 30 (i.e., not by the adapter plate 62) while the second device 14 is carried<br><br>
by both the ceiling plate and the adapter plate. When the support system 10 is assembled, the two spindles 40, 60 are arranged generally side by-side, i.e., the second spindle 60 is positioned generally parallel with and radially spaced from the main spindle 40, such that at least a portion of each spindle. 40, 6 0 lies on the same horizontal plane axialIy apaced from the coiling pinto 32. In this way, as additional hubs .100 are added to the second spindle 60, the length of the first spindle 40 is not increased and the available working height between the work surface 18 and the lowest hub 100 is maintained (unless several hubs are added to the second spindle, resulting in the second spindle and its associated hubs 100 being lower than that of the first spindle).<br>
As shown in Figures 3 and 4, other devices 110, 112 are optionally mounted to the adapter plate using securement members 114, such as bolts, screws, or the like, which are received through suitably positioned holes in the adapter plate and preferably also through cor.responding holes in the ceiling plate 30.<br>
With reference now to Figure 10, to select the optimum position for the adapter plate 62 out of the plurality of possible positions (four in the illustrated embodiment) , the arm 50 of the first device. 12 is moved between its stop positions Sx and S2 and the midpoint M between the stop positions is determined as being the most typical operating position for the arm 50. The second spindle 60 is then positioned at or about 180° from the midpoint (i.e., at an opposite end of a line x-x passing through the midpoint M and the first ;spindle 40). In this way, the arms 50 and 98 will be in the positions least likely to interfere with each other positioning.<br>
In order to accommodate for variable ceiling heights, a telescopic transition, piece 120 (Figures 12-13) is optionally used for installation concurrently with the adapter plate 62. The transition piece 120 is extended fully for high ceilings (Figure 13), and extends<br><br>
to varying leakier lengths for varying heights of lower ceilings between the extended position and a collapsed position (Figure 12) . The  transition piece 12 0 may not be needed if the ceiling in the application is low enough (Figure 11) . In that case, the second spindle 60 is simply attached directly to the adapter plate collar 90. The transition piece 12 0 enables the adapter plate 62 to be installed in a variety of different settings without having to adjust the dimensions of the support arm 98.<br>
As shown in Figures 12 and 13, the transition piece 120 includes a first attachment portion 122 at an upper end thereof, which is attached to the collar 9 0 in place of the spindle 60 by suitable securement means, such as bolts, screws, or the like (not shown) . A second attachment portion 124 is attached to the spindle 60 in a similar manner. A telescoping midportion 12 6, intermediate the two attachment portions 122, 124, extends the length of the transition piece between that Shown in Figure 12 and that shown in Figure 13 .<br>
With reference to Figure 14, an alternative auxiliary assembly 13 0 comprising an adapter plate 62 an articulated arm 98 and a monitor 14' is shown.<br><br>
