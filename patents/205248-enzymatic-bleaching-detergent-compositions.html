THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 OF 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10; rule 13)<br>
(1) TITLE OF INVENTION ENZYMATIC BLEACHING DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
(2) HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165-166 Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai 400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to bleaching detergent compositions. More in particular, it relates to enzymatic detergent compositions comprising bleaching enzymes which are targeted to stains present on fabrics.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Detergent compositions comprising bleaching enzymes have been described in the prior art. For instance, GB-A-2 101 167 (Unilever) discloses an enzymatic bleach composition in the form of a hydrogen peroxide-generating system comprising a C1-C4   alkanol  oxidase  and a  C1-C4   alkanol.   Such enzymatic bleach compositions may be used in detergent compositions for fabric washing, in which they may provide a low-temperature enzymatic bleach system. In the wash liquor, the alkanol oxidase enzyme catalyses the reaction between dissolved molecular oxygen and the alkanol to form an aldehyde and hydrogen peroxicie. In order to obtain a significant bleach effect at low wash temperatures, e.g. at 15-55°C, the hydrogen peroxide must be activated by means of a bleach activator. Today, the most commonly used bleach activator is tetra-acetyl ethylene diamine (TAED) , which yields peracetic acid  upon reacting with  the hydrogen peroxide, the peracetic acid being the actual bleaching agent.<br>
WO-A-98/56885 (Unilever, incorporated herein by reference) discloses a bleaching enzyme which is capable of generating a bleaching chemical and having a high binding affinity for stains present on fabrics, as well as an enzymatic bleaching composition comprising said bleaching enzyme, and a process for bleaching stains on fabrics. The binding affinity may be formed by a part of the polypeptide<br><br><br>
chain of  the bleachihg enzyme or the enzyme may comprise an enzyme part which is capable of generating a bleach chemical that is coupled to a reagent having the high binding affinity for stains present on fabrics. In the latter case the reagent may be bispecific, comprising one specificity for stain and one for enzyme. Examples of such bispecific reagents mentioned in the disclosure are antibodies, especially those derived from Camelidae  having only a variable region of the heavy chain polypeptide (VHK), peptides, peptidomimics, and other organic molecules. The enzyme which is covalently bound to one functional site of the antibody usually is an oxidase, such as glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase and alcohol oxidase, which is capable of forming hydrogen peroxide or another bleaching agent. Thus, if the multi-specific reagent is an antibody, the enzyme forms an enzyme/antibody conjugate which constitutes one ingredient of a detergent composition. During washing, said enzyme/antibody conjugate of the detergent composition is targeted to stains on the clothes by another functional site of the antibody, while the conjugated enzyme catalyses the formation of a bleaching agent in the proximity of the stain and the stain will be subjected to bleaching.<br>
Although this and several other enzymatic bleach systems have been proposed, there is still a need for alternative or improved enzymatic bleach systems. In particular, the enzymatic bleach system should be capable of bleaching stains which are otherwise difficult to remove, the so-called "problem stains" such as tea, blackberry juice, or red wine. Such stains would require a significant amount of bleaching for their removal, which might negatively affect the colours of the garment.<br>
In conventional laundry bleach systems, fabrics are uniformly exposed to the same concentration of bleach, whether "problem stains" are present or not. Moreover, damage to garments (such as the fading of dyes) can be<br><br>
caused by repeated washing with conventional bleach systems, which may contain relatively high concentrations of bleach.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide alternative or improved enzymatic bleach systems which, in particular, should be capable of bleaching stains which are otherwise difficult to remove, and should preferably be more selective in its bleaching action. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an alternative or improved enzymatic bleach process.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that it is possible to control the enzymatic bleaching reaction by means of the pI of the part having a high binding affinity for stains present on fabrics. It was found that the pI of the reagent having the high binding affinity should have a pI which is lower than the pH of an agueous wash solution comprising 1 g/1 of the composition.<br>
The detergent compositions of the invention are particularly attractive for treating "problem stains" which occur only occasionally, such as tea, red-wine, and blackberry juice. These stains are not present on most garments and when they are present they are likely to be present in different positions than habitual stains such as those found on collars and cuffs. According to the invention, it is possible to optimise the in-use concentration of the new bleaching enzyme so. that threshold concentrations of bleach are only reached if stain is present and the new bleaching enzyme binds to and accumulates on said stain. When this happens, the high local concentration of enzyme generates a high local concentration of bleach near to the stain and thereby exerts a selective bleaching action where it is required. Therefore, the unstained part of the garment (typically the majority) is not exposed to high levels of bleach and thereby this fabric is protected from bleach-associated damage. Moreover, the next time the same garment has a stain such as blackberry, tea, wine, etc. it is likely to be in a different position<br><br>
on the garment. Therefore a   different position on the garment will be exposed to high levels of bleach. Therefore, problems associated with several washes in conventional bleaching systems, such as dye-fade, will be reduced or eliminated altogether. This is in stark contrast to conventional bleaching systems where all garments are uniformly exposed to high concentrations of bleach, in every wash, regardless of whether problem stains are present or not.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 1.  The bleaching enzyme<br>
In its first aspect, the invention relates to a bleaching enzyme which is capable of generating a bleaching chemical  and comprises an enzyme part capable of generating a bleaching chemical which is coupled to a reagent having a high binding affinity for stains present on fabrics.<br>
1.1  The enzyme part, capable of generating a bleaching chemical.<br>
The bleaching chemical may be enzymatically generated hydrogen peroxide. The enzyme for generating the bleaching chemical or enzymatic hydrogen peroxide-generating system may in principle be chosen from the various enzymatic hydrogen peroxide-generating systems which have been disclosed in the art. For example, one may use an amine oxidase and an amine, an amino acid oxidase and an amino acid, cholesterol oxidase and cholesterol, uric acid oxidase and uric acid or a  xanthine oxidase with, xanthine. Alternatively, a combination of a C1-C4 alkanol oxidase and<br>
a C1-C4 alkanol is used, and especially preferred is the<br>
combination of methanol oxidase and ethanol. The methanol oxidase is preferably isolated from a catalase-negative Hansenula polymorpha strain, (see for example EP-A-244 920 (Unilever)). The preferred oxidases are glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase and alcohol oxidase.<br>
A hydrogen peroxide generating enzyme could be used in combination with activators which generate peracetic acid. Such activators are well-known in the art. Examples include<br><br>
tetraacetylethylenediamine. (TAED)  and  sodium nonanoyl-. oxybenzenesulphonate   (SNOBS).   These  and other related compounds  are  described  in  fuller  detail by Grime  and  Clauss in  Chemistry  &amp;   Industry   (15 October   1990)   647-653. Alternatively,   a  transition metal  catalyst could be  used in combination with  a  hydrogen peroxide   generating  enzyme   to increase   the  bleaching power    Examples  of manganese catalysts  are  described by Hage  et  al.    (1994)   Nature  369, 637-639.<br>
Alternatively,   the bleaching  chemical  is hypohalite  and the  enzyme part  is   then  a  haloperoxidase.   Preferred haloperoxidases  are   chloroperoxidases   and the  corresponding bleaching  chemical   is  hypochlorite.   Especially preferred chloroperoxidases   are  Vanadium  chloroperoxidases,    for example   from  Curvularia  inaequalls.<br>
Alternatively,   peroxidases  or   laccases may be  used.   In this  case  the  bleaching molecule   is   derived from an  enhancer molecule  that  has   reacted with  the   enzyme.   Examples   of laccase/enhancer  systems  are given  in  WO-A-95/01426. Examples  of  peroxidase/enhancer  systems   are  given   in  WO-A-97/11217.<br>
1.2     The  part  having  the  high binding   affinity.<br>
The  new bleaching  enzyme has   a  high binding  affinity for  stains present  on   fabrics.   It may be  that one  part  of the polypeptide   chain  of  the bleaching  enzyme  is  responsible for  the binding  affinity,   but  it   is   also  possible   that  the enzyme  comprises   an  enzyme part  capable  of generating  a bleaching chemical  which  is  coupled  to  a  reagent having  the high binding  affinity  for  stains  present  on  fabrics.   In  the first   situation,    the   bleaching   enzyme, may be   a   fusion protein  comprising   two  domains  which  may be  coupled  by means of   a   linker.   In   the   second  situation,    the  reagent  having   the high  binding   affinity may be  covalently  coupled  to   the enzyme  part   for   generating   the  bleaching  chemical,   by  means of  a bi-valent   coupling  agent  such   as   glutardialdehyde.   A<br><br><br>
full reviewv of chemistries  appropriate for couplrag two biomolecules is provided in "Bioconjugate techniques" by Greg T. Hermanson, Academic Press Inc (1986). Alternatively, if the reagent having the high binding affinity is a peptide or a protein, it may also be coupled to the enzyme by constructing a fusion protein. In such a construct there would typically be a peptide linker between the binding reagent and the enzyme. An example of a fusion of an enzyme and a binding reagent is described in Ducancel et al. Bio/technology 11, 601-605.<br>
A further embodiment would be for the reagent with a high binding affinity to be a bispecific reagent, comprising one specificity for stain and one for enzyme. Such a reagent could fulfil the requirement of accumulating enzyme on stain either by supplying said reagent together with enzyme as a pre-formed non-covalent complex or by supplying the two separately and allowing them to self-assemble either in the wash liquor or on the stain.<br>
It is essential that the pI of the reagent having the high binding affinity has a pI which is lower than-the pH of an aqueous wash solution comprising 1 g/1 of the. composition. Preferably, the pI is 0.1-5, 0.1-2 units lower than the pH, more preferably 0.2-0.5 units lower than the pH.<br>
The. skilled -man can calculate the pI of the reagent having the high binding affinity and using modern recombinant DNA techniques he can subsequently prepare the modified reagents without difficulty.<br>
The novel bleaching enzyme according to the invention is based on the presence of a part having a high binding affinity for stains present on fabrics.<br>
The degree of binding of a compound A to another molecule B can be generally expressed by the chemical equilibrium constant Kd resulting from the following reaction:<br><br><br>
The chemical equilibrium constant Kd is then given by:<br><br>
Whether the binding to the stains is specific or not can be judged from the difference between the binding (Kd value) of the compound to stained (i.e. a material treated so that stain components are bound on), versus the binding to unstained (i.e. untreated) material, or versus the binding to material stained with an unrelated chromophore. For applications in laundry, said material will be a fabric such as  cotton or polyester. However, it will usually be more convenient to measure Kd values and differences in Kd values on other materials such as a polystyrene microtitre plate or a specialised surface in an analytical biosensor. The difference between the two binding constants should be minimally 10, preferably more than 100, and more preferably, more that 1000. Typically, the compound should bind the stain, or the stained material, with a Kd lower than 10-4 M, preferably lower than 10-6 M and could be 10-10 M or even less. Higher binding affinities (Kd of less than 10"5 M) and/or a larger difference between coloured, substance and background binding would increase the selectivity of the bleaching process. Also, the weight efficiency of the compound in the total detergent composition would be increased and smaller amounts of the compound would be required.<br>
Several classes of compounds can be envisaged which deliver the capability of specific binding to stains one would like to bleach. In the following we will give a number of examples of such compounds having such capabilities, without pretending to be exhaustive.<br><br>
1.2.1.  Antibodies.  <br>
Antibodies are well known examples of compounds which are capable of binding specifically to compounds against which they were raised. Antibodies can be derived from several  sources. From mice, monoclonal antibodies can be obtained which possess very high binding affinities. From such antibodies, Fab, Fv or scFv fragments, can be prepared which have retained their binding properties. Such antibodies or fragments can be produced through recombinant DNA technology by microbial fermentation. Well known production hosts for antibodies and  their fragments are yeast, moulds or bacteria.<br>
A class of antibodies of particular interest is formed by the Heavy Chain antibodies as found in Camelidae, like the camel or the llama. The binding domains of these antibodies consist of a single polypeptide fragment, namely the variable region of the heavy chain polypeptide (HC-V). In contrast, in the classic antibodies (murine, human, etc.), the binding domain consist of two polypeptide chains (the variable regions of the heavy chain (Vh) and the light chain (V1)) . Procedures to obtain heavy chain immunoglobulins from Camelidae, or (functionalized) fragments thereof, have been described- in WO-A-94/04 678 (Casterman and Hamers) and WO-A-94/25591 (Unilever and Free University of Brussels).<br>
Alternatively, binding domains can be obtained from the Vh fragments of classical antibodies by a procedure termed "came1ization". Hereby the classical Vh fragment is transformed, by substitution of a number of amino acids, into a HC-V-like fragment, whereby its binding properties are retained. This procedure has been described by Riechmann et al. in a number of publications (J. Mol. Biol. (1996) 259, 957-969; Protein. Eng. (1996) 9, 531-537, Bio/Technology (1995) 13, 475-479). Multivalent antigen-<br><br>
binding  proteins  based  on  antibody   fragments  are   also disclosed ,in WO-A-99/23221   (Unilever) .   Also HC-V fragments can be produced  through  recombinant  DNA  technology  in  a number of microbial  hosts   (bacterial,   yeast,   mould),   as described  in WO-A-94/29457   (Unilever) .<br>
Methods   for producing  fusion proteins  that  comprise  an enzyme  and  an  antibody or  that  comprise  an  enzyme  and  an antibody  fragment  are  already  Known  in  the  art.   One  approacl is  described by Neuberger  and Rabbits   (EP-A-194   276) .   A method  for producing  a   fusion protein  comprising  an  enzyme and  an  antibody  fragment   that  was   derived  from an  antibody originating   in   Csmelidae  is  described   in- WO-A-94/25591.   A method  for producing  bispecific   antibody  fragments   is described by  Holliger   et   al.    (1993)    PNAS   90,   6444-6448.<br>
A particularly  attractive   feature  of  antibody binding behaviour  is  their  reported ability  to bind to  a  "family"   of structurally-related molecules.   For  example,   in  Gani   et  al. (J.   Steroid Biochem.   Molec.   Biol.   48,   277-282)   an  antibody is  described  that  was   raised  against  progesterone  but  also binds  to  the   structurally-related  steroids,   pregnanedione, pregnanolone  and   6-hydroxy-progesterone.   Therefore,   using the  same  approach,   antibodies  could be   isolated  that  bind  tc a  whole  "family"   of   stain  chromophores   (such as   the polyphenols,   porphyrins,   or  caretenoids   as  described below). A. broad, action, antibody, such  as   this, could be. used, to  treat several different   stains  when  coupled  to  a bleaching  enzyme.<br>
1.2.2.     Peptides.<br>
Peptides  usually have  lower  binding  affinities   to  the substances  of   interest   than  antibodies.   Nevertheless,   the binding properties  of  carefully   selected  or designed peptides  can  be   sufficient  to  deliver   the  desired selectivity  in  a  oxidation process.   A peptide which   is capable  of  binding   selectively   to   a   substance  which   one would  like  to  oxidise,   can  for   instance  be  obtained   from a protein which   is   known   to bind   to   that   specific   substance.<br><br>
An  example  of  such a .peptide  would be  a  binding  region       extracted  from an antibody  raised against  that  substance. Other examples  are proline-rich peptides  that  are  known to bind  to   the  polyphenols  in wine.<br>
Alternatively,   peptides  which bind  to  such   substance can be  obtained by the use of peptide combinatorial libraries.   Such  a library may contain up  to   1010 peptides, from which  the  peptide with  the desired binding properties can be  isolated.    (R.A.   Houghten,   Trends  in Genetics,   Vol  9, no  &amp;,   235-239) .   Several  embodiments  have  been  described  for this procedure   (J.   Scott  et  al.,   Science   (1990)   249,   386-390;   Fodor   et   al. ,   Science   (1991)   251,   767-773;   K.   Lam  et al.,   Nature   (1991)   354,   82-84;   R.A.   Houghten  et   al.,   Nature (1991)    354,    84-86) .<br>
Suitable  peptides  can be  produced by organic   synthesis, using  for  example  the Merrifield procedure   (Merrifield (1963)   J.Am.Chem.Soc.   85,   2149-2154).   Alternatively,   the peptides   can be  produced by  recombinant  DNA technology in microbial  hosts    (yeast,   moulds,   bacteria)(K.N.   Faber   et  al. (1996)   Appl.   Microbiol.   Biotechnol.   45,   72-79) .<br>
1.2.3.	Pepidomimics.<br>
In  order   to   improve  the  stability and/or binding properties  of   a  peptide,   the molecule  can be  modified by  the incorporation  of non-natural   amino  acids   and/or  non-natural chemical   linkages  between  the  amino  acids.   Such molecules are  called peptidomimics   (H.U.   Saragovi  et  al.    (1991) Bio/Technology   10,   773-778;   S.   Chen et  al.    (1992) Proc.Natl.Acad.    Sci.   USA 89,   5872-5876).   The  production  of such  compounds   is   restricted  to  chemical   synthesis.<br>
1.2.4.	Other   organic molecules.<br>
It  can  be   readily  envisaged  that  other  molecular structures,   which  need  not  be   related  to  proteins,   peptides or  derivatives   thereof,   can  be   found  which  bind   selectively to  substances   one  would  like   to  oxidise  with   the  desired<br><br><br>
binding properties For example certain  polymeric RNA molecules which have been shown to bind small synthetic dye molecules (A. Ellington et al. (1990) Nature 346, 818-822). Such binding compounds can be obtained by the combinatorial approach, as described for peptides (L.B. McGown et al. (1995), Analytical Chemistry, 663A-668A).<br>
This approach can also be applied for purely organic compounds which are not polymeric. Combinatorial procedures for synthesis and selection for the desired binding properties have been described for such compounds (Weber et al..(1995) Angew.Chem.Int.Ed.Engl. 34, 2280-2282; G. Lowe (1995), Chemical Society Reviews 24, 309-317; L.A. Thompson et al. (1996) Chern. Rev. 96, 550-600). Once suitable binding compounds have been identified, they can be produced on a larger scale by means of organic synthesis.<br>
1.3  The Stains<br>
For detergents applications, several classes of coloured substances one would like to bleach can be envisaged, in particular coloured substances which may occur as stains on fabrics can be a target. However, it is also important to emphasise that many stains are heterogeneous. Therefore, the substance to be targeted need not itself be coloured providing that it is always present in the mixture of substances that constitute a stain.<br>
Moreover, an important embodiment of the invention is to use a binding compound (refer to 1.2) that binds to several different, but structurally-related, molecules in a class of "stain substances". This would have the advantage of enabling a single enzyme species to bind (and bleach) several different stains. An example would be to use an antibody which binds to the polyphenols in wine, tea, and blackberry. Further examples of classes of stain substances are given below:<br>
1.3.1.  Porphyrin derived structures.<br><br>
Porphyrin  structures,.. often.cordinated to a metal form one  class  of  coloured substances  which occur in stains. Examples  are heme or haematin  in blood  stain,   chlorophyll  as the   green  substance   in  plants,   e.g.   grass  or spinach. Another  example  of  a  metal-free  substance   is bilirubin,   a yellow breakdown product  of  heme.<br>
1.3.2.	Tannins, polyphenols<br>
Tannins are polymerised forms of certain classes of polyphenols. Such polyphenols are catechins, leuantocyanins, etc. (P. Ribereau-Gayon, Plant Phenolics, Ed. Oliver &amp; Boyd, Edinburgh, 1972, pp.169-198). These substances can be conjugated with simple phenols like e.g. gallic acids. These polyphenolic substances occur in tea stains, wine stains, banana stains, peach stains, etc. and are notoriously difficult to remove-<br>
1.3.3.	Carotenoids<br>
(G.E. Bartley et al. (1995), The Plant Cell 7, 1027-1038). Carotenoids are the coloured substances which occur in tomato (lycopene, red), mango (P-carotene, orange-yellow) . They occur in food stains (tomato) which are also notoriously difficult to remove, especially on coloured fabrics, when the use of chemical bleaching agents is not advised;<br>
1.3.4.	Anthocyanins.<br>
(P. Ribereau-Gayon, Plant Phenolics, Ed. Oliver &amp; Boyd, Edinburgh, 1972, 135-169). These substance are the highly coloured molecules which occur in many fruits and flowers. Typical examples, relevant for stains, are berries, but also wine. Anthocyanins have a high diversity in glycosidation patterns.<br>
1.3.5.	Maillard reaction products<br><br>
■*<br><br>
Upon heating of mixtures of carbohydrate molecules in the presence of protein/peptide structures, a typical yellow/brown coloured substance arises. These substances occur for example in cooking oil and are difficult to remove from fabrics.<br>
2. The Detergent Composition.<br>
The bleaching enzymes can be used in a detergent composition, specifically suited for stain bleaching purposes, and this constitutes a second aspect of the invention. To that extent, the composition comprises a surfactant and optionally other conventional detergent-ingredients. The invention in its second aspect provides an enzymatic detergent composition which comprises from 0.1 -50 % by weight, based on the total detergent composition, of one or more surfactants. This surfactant system may in turn comprise 0 - 95 % by weight of one or more anionic surfactants and 5 - 100 % by weight of one or more nonionic surfactants. The surfactant system may additionally contain amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compounds, but this in not normally desired owing to their relatively high cost. The enzymatic detergent composition according to the invention will generally be used as a dilution in water of about 0.05 to 2%.<br>
In general, the nonionic and anionic surfactants of the surfactant system may be chosen from the surfactants described "Surface Active Agents" Vol. 1, by Schwartz &amp; Perry, Interscience 1949, Vol. 2 by Schwartz, Perry &amp;.Berch, Interscience 1958, in the current edition of "McCutcheon's Emulsifiers and Detergents" published by Manufacturing Confectioners Company or in "Tenside- Taschenbuch", H. Stache, 2nd Edn., Carl Hauser Verlag, 1981.<br>
Suitable nonionic detergent compounds which may be used include, in particular, the reaction products of compounds having a hydrophobic group and a reactive hydrogen atom, for <br><br><br>
example, aliphatic alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols<br>
with alkylene oxides, especially ethylene oxide  either-alone or with propylene oxide. Specific nonionic detergent compounds are C6-C22 alkyl phenol-ethylene oxide condensates, generally 5 to 25 EO, i.e. 5 to 25 units of ethylene oxide per molecule, and the condensation products of aliphatic C8¬C18 primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide, generally 5 to. 40 EO.<br>
Suitable anionic detergent compounds which may be used are usually water-soluble alkali metal salts of organic sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl radicals containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term alkyl being used to include the alkyl portion of higher acyl radicals. Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds are sodium and potassium alkyl sulphates, especially those obtained by sulphating higher C8-C10alcohols, produced for example from tallow or coconut oil, sodium and potassium alkyl C9-C2o benzene sulphonates, particularly sodium linear secondary alkyl C10-C15 benzene sulphonates; and sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers of the higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil and synthetic alcohols derived from petroleum. The preferred anionic detergent compounds are sodium C11-C15 alkyl benzene sulphonates and sodium C12-C18 alkyl sulphates. Also applicable are surfactants such as those described in EP-A-328 177 (Unilever), which.show resistance to salting-out, the alkyl polyglycoside surfactants described in EP-A-070 074, and alkyl monoglycosides.<br>
Preferred surfactant systems are mixtures of anionic with nonionic detergent active materials, in particular the groups and examples of anionic and nonionic surfactants pointed out in EP-A-346 995 (Unilever) . Especially preferred is surfactant system which is a mixture of an alkali metal salt of a C16-C18 primary alcohol sulphate together with a C12-C15 primary alcohol 3-7 EO ethoxylate.<br>
The nonionic detergent is preferably present in amounts greater than 10%, e.g. 25-90% by weight of the surfactant<br><br><br>
system. Anionic surfactants can be present fox example in amounts in the range from about 5% to about 4 0% by weight of the surfactant system.<br>
The detergent composition may take any suitable physical form, such as a powder, an aqueous or non aqueous liquid, a paste or a gel.<br>
The bleaching enzyme used in the present invention can usefully be added to the detergent composition in any suitable form, i.e. the form of a granular composition, a liquid or a slurry of the enzyme, or with carrier material (e.g. as in EP-A-258 068 and the Savinase (TM) and Lipolase (TM)' products of Novo Nordisk) . A good way of adding the enzyme to a liquid detergent product is in the form of a slurry containing 0.5 to 50 % by weight of the enzyme in a ethoxylated alcohol nonionic surfactant, such as described in EP-A-450 702 (Unilever).<br>
The enzymatic bleaching compositions of the invention comprise about 0.001 to 10 milligrams of active bleaching enzyme per litre. A detergent composition will comprise about 0.001% to 1% of active enzyme (w/w).<br>
The enzyme activity can be expressed in units. For example, in the case of glucose oxidase, one unit will oxidise 1 umole of β-D-glucose to D-gluconolactone and H202 per minute at pH 6.5 at 30°C. The enzyme activity which is added to the. enzymatic bleaching composition will be about 2.0 to 4,000 units per litre (of wash liquor) .<br>
The. invention will now be further illustrated in the following, non-limiting Examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Binding of Bihead (pI 9) to unstained fabric.<br>
A Bihead  was constructed (anti Glucose Oxidase - anti polyphenols /Red wine (Cotes du Rhone wine (Co-op, U.K.)) according to the method described in WO-A-99/23221 (Unilever).<br><br><br>
The concentration of anti GOX-anti Red Wine, bihead<br>
unbound in a cotton cloth containing solution was determined<br>
by a micro-BCA protein method. The number of white cotton<br>
fabric pieces influenced the amount of bihead absorbing to<br>
the fabric. Figure 1 shows the bihead binding to the cotton<br>
at pH 7 and 8, as indicated by a drop in the amount of<br>
bihead detected in the solution. In contrast, the amount of<br>
bihead in the solution at pH9 and 10 did not decrease as the<br>
number of white swatches increased, thus indicative of the<br>
absence of non-specific binding to the cotton at this higher<br>
pH.	<br>
Example 2<br>
Binding of other Biheads to unstained fabric<br>
Example 1 was repeated, using variants of the (anti Glucose Oxidase - anti polyphenols /Red wine) Bihead, having different pI values. White, unstained cloth, 2 x 2cm was used that had been prewashed for 10 minutes in MQ H20. 0, 1, 2 and 5 swatches placed in 10ml of each of the various buffers, in duplicate plus lOOug of bihead. Control set consisted of 0, 1, 2 and 5 swatches in 10ml of each of the various buffers but without bihead. Mixed on a rotary mixer for 15 minutes at room' temperature and then left to stand for 10 minutes. After which, aliquot taken from each and immediately assayed using micro BCA protein assay. The following Biheads were used:<br>
12/49, having a pI of 9.5<br>
12/49 myc tail, having a pI of 8.8<br>
12/11, having a pI of 8.0.<br>
The results are shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4. These graphs show the non-specific binding to cotton as a function of pH. The pI values are deduced pI values. The benefit of using a bihead with a pI that falls outside the liquor pH window for<br><br>
reduced or no .non-specific binding  to  unstained ballast-cloth  is  evident.<br>
Example  3<br>
Bleaching performance of targeted enzyme.<br>
The performance of the glucose oxidase, targeted or<br>
non-targeted, was compared in a detergent composition (0M0)<br>
at pH values above and below the pI of the biheaded<br>
antibody. The following detergent composition was used<br>
(amounts in % by weight):<br>
LAS	24<br>
STP	14.5<br>
Sodium Methyl Cellulose   0.37<br>
Sodium Sulphate	25.5<br>
Sodium Carbonate        17.5<br>
Sodium Silicate	6.9<br>
Moisture	6.2<br>
Minors	5.0<br>
The results are show in Figure 5. The results clearly show that the benefits of targeted bleaching are only apparent in pH solutions above the pI of the antibody molecule. The reaction systems contained an equal ratio of stained and white unstained material. Hence, when the pH was above the pI, only specific antibody binding occurred to its target present on the stained fabric, whereas below the pI, the antibody could bind both specifically to its target and non-specifically to unstained fabric. Therefore, the effect of the targeted bleaching enzyme Glucose Oxidase (Gox) is enhanced at the higher pH.<br><br>
