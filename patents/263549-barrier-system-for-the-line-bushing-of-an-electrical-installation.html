Description<br>
Barrier system for the line bushing of an electrical installation<br>
The invention relates to a barrier system for a line bushing of an electrical installation, having wall elements as barriers, which are arranged alongside one another, have axial longitudinal extents and are arranged in intervals from one another, with the intermediate spaces therefore forming channels, with the wall elements resting in places on a base at least with the lower end of the wall elements. The invention also relates to a plug element for holding and fixing the wall elements which form the barrier.<br>
The background to the present invention is barrier systems for line bushing of an electrical installation, in particular for high-voltage installations. Particularly in the case of high-voltage installations, the connection of the electrical installation to an external line network requires a shielding line bushing in the connection area between the electrical installation and the external network. In this case, an insulation body is conventionally arranged around an electrode and withstands the electrical and thermal load in the line bushing area. Pressboard segments are for this purpose arranged generally coaxially - around the coaxial line bushing. A defined distance is fixed between the pressboard segments, by means of spacing elements. An insulation medium for example a transformer oil - circulates through the cavities created in this way and is used on the one hand as an insulator, and at the same time as a cooling medium. As a result of the high electrical field strengths in line bushings of an electrical high-voltage installation, the cavities - and therefore the insulated medium circulating in the cavities - must be chosen such that,<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/061907	- 2 -<br>
2005P07736WOIN<br>
depending on the distance to the line bushing, they withstand the electrical field and ensure adequate heat circulation around the line bushing. The various field profiles and therefore the electrical field strengths are governed by the form of the voltage applied and by the way in which the electrical installation is operated, for example with a uniform field distribution in the case of DC voltage loads being advantageous for high-voltage DC transmission Installations. The distance between the pressboard segments must be chosen and permanently fixed as a function of the profile of the electrical equipotential lines to be expected and of the electrical field strengths which occur as a result of them Particularly in the immediate vicinity of the line bushing, the relative distances between the pressboard segments must be chosen to be small, and must be chosen to be greater as the field strength in the area outside the line bushing decreases.<br>
Because of the high electrical voltages, exact orientation and fixing of the wall elements as barriers are necessary, in particular in the immediate area of the line bushing. A barrier normally has a length of up to 3 m with a wall thickness of 3 to 6 mm, in which case a maximum position tolerance of 1 mm must be maintained.<br>
These barrier systems are used in particular for transformers and induction coils, as well as for test barrier systems. Barrier systems are known from the prior art which are fitted directly to the line bushing of the electrical installation, and are adhesively bonded to it.<br>
DE 690 12 258 T2 describes capacitor isolation for field control of the connection of a transformer line bushing. As described in the invention there, a system which comprises axially extending cooling channels is disclosed, In addition to<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/061907	- 3 -<br>
2005P07736WOIN<br>
a capacitor isolating wall, around the line bushing of an electrical installation. The corresponding insulation of the line bushing is wound on in the course of a winding process, and is therefore permanently fixed. It is impossible to subsequently remove this barrier system from the Line bushing.<br>
DE 27 40 157 discloses a line bushing with a control electrode for high-voltage installations. A link to hold the line bushing conductor relative to the electrode is disclosed in particular for metal-encapsulated and compressed-gas-insulated high-voltage installations with a line bushing conductor. DE 27 40 157 discloses no further features relating to the insulation of the line bushing that is required for this purpose.<br>
The same applies to DE 36 16 243 C2 as a line bushing in particular for high voltages. The invention there discloses a union insulator which is filled with an inert gas at, low pressure and, by means of insulating perforated discs, separates the high gas pressure on the appliance side from the gas pressure within the union insulator i.n a gas-tight manner.<br>
Pressboard segments are conventionally arranged at defined distances by means of spacers coaxially around a line bushing. A base for the pressboard segments is placed in the immediate transition area of the electrode which shields the lino bushing and a constant separation between the pressboard segments is ensured over the entire length of: the pressboard segments, by means of spacers. The pressboard segments are then permanently fixed on the base by means of an adhesive.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/061907	- 4 -<br>
2005P07736WOIN<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to overcome the disadvantages which occur in the prior art and to provide a barrier system which can be fitted and removed quickly and easily.<br>
The object is achieved by the subject matter of Patent Claim 1.<br>
The invention provides that a plug element forms the base to which the wall elements can be connected, with the plug element having axial guide elements for holding and fixing the wall elements. The wall elements and the plug element are preferably rotationally symmetrical. In contrast to the prior art, the barrier system according to the invention ensures quick connection, which in particular can subseqently bo detached again, of the wall elements to one another, and therefore of" the barrier system. In this case, the plug element has axial guide elements, with the at least one axial guide ideally providing axial and radial fixing to the wall elements.<br>
In one advantageous refinement of the invention, the guide elements are arranged on the plug element such that the} wall elements which can be connected to the guide elements are at a predetermined distance from one another. Since the high electrical field strengths necessitate exact compliance with the distances between the wall elements which are arranged relative to one another, the arrangement of the guide elements on the plug element ensures that the wall elements are permanently held in a fixed predetermined manner with respect to their relative separations.<br>
A further advantage is that the cap areas of the guide elements are arranged as the base at different heights rclat.i ve<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/061907	- 5 -<br>
2005P07736WOIN<br>
on the plug element, and the wall elements arc therefore axially staggered relative to one another. Particularly when using a plurality of wall elements at different distances from the line bushing, it may be necessary for the wall elements to be differently staggered in the axial direction relative to the line bushing. Differently staggered guide elements on the plug element allow an axially staggered arrangement of the wall elements without any problems. The plug element advantageously has slots as guide elements, into which the wall elements, with wall thicknesses which correspond to the slot width, can be plugged. On the one hand, this results in the capability to produce a barrier system quickly and easily. On the other hand, this results in the capability to remove the barrier system again, without major effort.<br>
One advantageous refinement of the invention is Cor the wall elements to be combined to form plug groups, some of which can be connected to the plug element. The combination of the wall elements to form plug groups means that it is not necessary to add each wall element individually to a barrier system. The use of a plug group comprising a plurality of wall elements provides a simple and quick capability to produce a barrier system. Advantageously, not only can the plug groups be connected to the plug element, but it is also possible for the plug groups themselves to be connected to one another. The strength and dimensional stability of the plug groups, which are combined by means of spacers, and of the wall elements, in particular, allow the groups to be plugged into one another without any problems and easily. The wall elements of the second plug group can be plugged into the intermediate spaces that exist between the wall elements of the first plug group. The<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/061907	- 6 -<br>
2005P07736WOIN<br>
choice of a slightly smaller width for the intermediate spaces of the second plug group in comparison to the first plug group allows the second plug group to be fitted and fixed in the first plug group with an accurate fit. The wall elements are advantageously composed completely or partially of pressboard segments. In order to produce an even firmer connection between the wall elements and the plug element, the wall elements are fixed to the guide elements by attachment means, such as (rivets) pins and screws.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, not only is it possible to plug the wall elements into the plug element but, on the other hand, the plug element per se can be connected by means of corresponding holders to the electrode via guide elements, in particular slots. For this purpose, a plug part which corresponds to the guide element must be fitted in the outer area of the electrode.<br>
The guide elements are advantageously shaped such that they do not influence, or only slightly influence, the circulation of a medium located between the wall elements. This is ensured in particular by inclined and rounded shapes. It is also advantageous for the plug element to be arranged as a circumferential ring around the line bushing. If a medium has to circulate only above the plug element, a plug element which can be used as the circumferential ring can be used in order to improve the mechanical connection of the wail elements. Alternatively, flat plug elements distributed around the line bushing can be used to hold and fix the wall elements, and at the same time do not influence the circulation of the medium, which runs along the plug elements, within the wall elements.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/061907	- 7 -<br>
2005P07736WOIN<br>
The object is likewise achieved by the subject matter of patent claim 14. The invention in this case provides for the capability for at least some of the wall elements to be connected to the plug element, with the plug element, having axial guide elements. Slots are advantageously used as axial guide elements, into which corresponding wall elements can be plugged.<br>
Further advantageous refinements can be found in the dependent claims. The subject matter of the invention will be explained in detail with reference to the following figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic layout of the barrier system according to the invention, with three plug groups;<br>
Figures 2a to g show section drawings of plug elements according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic section drawing of a detail of the barrier system according to the invention around a line bushing 15 of an electrical installation. The outer area of the line bushing 15 is shielded by an electrode 16 which is bent around at the end. A first plug group 14a of wall elements 10 is fitted on the electrode 16. The distances between the wall elements 10 are predetermined by individual slots on the plug element 12. The distances between the wall elements 10 are to be maintained because of the requirement for cooling and the electrical field strengths there, and is ensured on the basis of the arrangement of the slots on the plug element 12.<br>
A plug group 14a of wall elements 10 is indicated by a number of wall elements 10, which run virtually parallel, and spacers<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/061907	- 8 -<br>
2005P07736WOIN<br>
(not. shown) on the side facing away from the plug clement 12. The spacers ensure that the distance between predetermined wall-elements 10 is identical to the distance between the corresponding slots on the plug element 12. Fixed and permanent retention and fixing of the relative position of the wa11 elements 10 are therefore ensured in the cap area 11 of the plug group 14a by the plug element 12 and, in the end of the plug group 14a facing away from the plug element 12, by the spacers.<br>
A third plug group 14c can be plugged into a second plug group 14b, in which case the wall element 10 of the third plug group 14c can be connected in a corresponding manner to the wall elements 10 of the second plug group 14b. Locking of the third plug group 14c is ensured by the strength and dimensional stiffness of the plug groups 14b, 14c, in particular by the insertion of the third plug group 14c into the second plug group 14b, with virtually identical distances between the respective wall elements 10. The first plug group 14a is locked within the plug element 12 according to the invention in the immediate vicinity of the line bushing 15. The distances between the guide elements 13a, 13b, 13c at the same time define the distance between the wall elements 10.<br>
Axial staggering of the wall elements 10 relative to one another may also be necessary because of particular requirements relating to the surrounding electrical field.<br>
In the upper area (which cannot be seen) of the wall elements 10, the wall elements 10 are fixed by conventional spacers (not shown), for example pressboard blocks. The capability to plug in the plug groups 14a, 14b, 14c allows a modular design as well as allowing the barrier arrangement to be fitted and removed quickly.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/061907	- 9 -<br>
2005P07736WOIN<br>
Figure 2a to Figure 2e show different section forms of the plug elements 12. The number of wail elements 10 per plug group 14a, 14b, 14c is considered for the corresponding plug element: 12. In the examples in Figure 2a and Figure 2b, the distances between the respective wall elements 10 are, furthermore, chosen to be different, because of the requirement relating to the external electrical field. On the left-hand side of the plug element 12, facing the line bushing 15, the distances between the slots and therefore between the wail elements to be inserted are small, because of the high electrical field strengths to be expected. As the distance from the Line bushing 15 increases, the distances between the slots at the right-hand edge of the plug element 12 become greater relative to the distances at the left-hand edge of the plug element 12.<br>
Furthermore, in the embodiments shown in Figure 2c and Figure 2d, the shapes of the guide elements 13a, 13b, 13c are slightly inclined in order to ensure better circulation of the coolant in the vicinity of the plug element 12. Other geometric shapes are likewise also claimed, so that the present drawings do not imply any restriction to the shape illustrated in them. Figure 2e shows a plug element 12 according to the invention on which the wall elements 10 are not held by means of slots, but exclusively by means of the guide element 13c itself. For security, the wall elements 10 are fixed to this guide element 13c by attachment elements (not illustrated), such as screws, pins or rivets.<br><br>
