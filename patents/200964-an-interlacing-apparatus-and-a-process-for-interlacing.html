The invention concerns an interlacing apparatus for the interlacing of multitilament yarns in accord with the generic concept of claim I and further concerns a process for the interlacing of at least one multifilament yarn in accord with the generic concept of claim 18.<br>
Interlacing apparatuses and processes of the kind discussed here, have been brought into common knowledge by DE 37 11 759 C2. fhese serve to improve the integrity of the filaments of the multifilament yarns and thereby better their further workability. The reason for this is that the single multifilament yarn, which is comprised of substances which are preferably thermoplastic or other material, upon being fed to the interlacing apparatus is yet untwisted or possesses onl\ a minimum protective twist, which still has insufficient integrit&gt; for further processing. The required integral strength is obtained by the multilllameni yarn only by the interlacing or interwining of its filaments. By means of the interlacing apparatus, the lllaments of several multifilament yarns can be commonly intertwined into one unified multifilament yarn.<br>
The intertwining or interlacing quality, or the outcome of the , is characterized by certain points, that is, the plaiting/interlacing tendencies of the filaments and afso the spacing lying between the said intertwined filaments. Within these points, the possibility exists for essentially non-interlaced, that is to say. open places in the yarn. When an interlacing o(~ the multitllamenl yarn occurs, in addition a ver\ weak interlaving can be achieved, in which no intertwining points arise, hi this situation, only a light, scarcely visible commingling of the filaments takes place. Such yarns exhibit only a small degree of thread closure and without additional expensive measures, cannot be subjected to furthei- processes such as imparting t\\ist. spindle whorling or finishing. At the most, these yarns can only be further worked under certain limiting conditions.<br><br>
"Thread   closure"   is   a   customary   designation   for   the   compactness   of multifilament yarns and described the integrity, i.e. the cohesiveness of the lllaments.<br>
The known intertwining apparatus possesses a yarn conduit through which multifilament yarn passes which exhibits a plurality of filaments. As this takes place, the filaments are commingled by means of an air fiow issuing from a jet nozzle opening. The jet nozzle exhibits normally a circular of elliptically shaped cross-section, which is designed symmetrically to the longitudinal axis of the yarn conduit. This commingling device shows the disadvantage, in that in many cases, the commingling of the filament \arn does not result in a desirable degree of entwinenient. The multifilament \am exhibits irregularities, in part lengthy, faulty stretches which indicate unentwined )'arn portions. Further processing of the multifilament yarn, for instance weaving, tufting, knitting, or sewing, leads to damage at these open, unprotected \arn stretches. Single filaments break and open out, whereby a thread breakage or break in neighboring threads and/or faults in textile surface formation occurs.<br>
I he present invention<br>
Thus, it is the purpose of the present invention, to avoid these disadvantages of the technology and to create an intertwining apparatus and a process, which will improve the quality of the entwined yarn, and which invention is in the position of comparing the node periods and the open yarn places. Along with this, the intertwining apparatus should be simple in construction and operate economically in regard to the consumption of air. This purpose is achieved by an device for multifilament yarns an interlacing device having a yarn passage in which the filaments of the multifilament yarn are adapted to be interlaced by means of a medium stream exiting from an aperture cross-section of an air-blow nozzle, wherein the main streams and secondary streams are substantially directed in the same direction.<br>
By means of DE 28 13 368 C2, it is indeed already known, where vortex jets are concerned, to employ a main How and at the same time a pulsating adjoining fiow which are caused to How counter-currently ov at right angles to one another in the yarn conduit in order to infiuence each other therein. This process has, however, not achieved the result expected of it and consequentK has not been accepted in practice.<br><br>
Further. DE 41 13 927 has made known the introduction of a main air flow int the yarn conduit by means of a Jet no/zle, the cross-section of the opening which is designed essentially symmetrically to the longitudinal axis of the yarn conduit. Further, paired side flows are pro\ided. whereby one side flow enters into the outer peripheral zone and the other side flow enters into another peripheral zone of the yarn conduit. Even in this case, the side flows are introduced into the principal flow on opposite sides of the yarn conduit. We disregard the fact, that this t)pe of construction is expensive because, for the removable cover an air feed for the side flows is required. Beyond this, it has surprisingly revealed itself, thai with the air flows as described in accord with the proposed achievement of the purpose of DE 41 13 927. main and side flows run in the same direction and do not. as called for by the current state of the technology, flow in the opposition to one another so that the directions of the different air flows are crossing. Obviously, this brings about a disturbance of the main air flow which leads to increased air consumption and poor entwinement results.<br>
CIl-PS 415 939 makes known a provision for the medium iced inlet to have a circular cross-section or any other appropriate shape, such as rectangular, oval or the like. In the present invention, the emphasis is on a jet nozzle opening, the shape of which is designed so that the medium, in particular, compressed air. flows in the more central zone of the yarn conduit, and paired side flows are injected into the peripheral zones thereof A teaching of this principle is not be inferred from an&gt; suggestion of CH-PS415 939.<br>
Due to the fact that the main and side flows are caused to flow in essentially the same direction, the main flow in the central region acts more intensively on the yarn. This main flow, entering the yarn conduit, divides into two. generalK equally strong partial flow vortices, which actuate the entwinement of the (llaments. The incoming side flows, which always enter the yarn conduit in a peripheral zone, because of the common direction of flow, surprisingly support the flow vortexing and assure that the filaments remain a minimum time in the said peripheral zones (dead zones).<br><br>
hi these peripheral zones, practically no entwinement can occur, but consistently said filaments are displaced by the side Hows into the principal air fiow. In this way, the number of" the unentwined, open yarn places is lessened and the length of the these faulty sections is shortened. By this advantageous inteiactivitv' of the main flow and the side flows, the costs of the can he reduced, while at the same time maintaining advantageous, uniform and satisfactory results in entwining from the given consumption of the medium. Further an increase of both the rate of production and the running speed of the filaments is brought about. As a result, economy of the intertwining apparatus is achieved along with a satisfactory quality oi'lhe intertwining.<br>
hi regard to "dividing" the main medium How. it is to be understood that the main flow and the side flows need not be physicalK divided, the division into main and side flows can also he effected by the shaping ol' the cross-section of the jet nozzles. By coordinating the main flow and the side flows in such a manner that the main flow, when compared to either of the side flows, always carries the greatest volume flow of the medium, the above described action of the is strengthened, since side flows which are too strong can lead to impairment of the main flow.<br>
In accord with another embodiment, the cross-section of the opening of the side flow is separated from the cross-section of the main flow. The flow. then, of the medium is thus apportioned into several separate partial llovvs. which, at least upon point of entry into the yarn conduit, exhibit this separateness, one from the other. In other words, the jet nozzle arrangement possesses, according to the first embodiment variant, principally one jet nozzle, and in accord with the second embodiment variant, exhibits at least two jet nozzles, fhese two jet nozzles (as a minimum) activate the physical separation of the partial flows of the medium.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment example of an intertwining apparatus, the cross-section of the opening of a jet nozzle is constructed from one jet nozzle. In this case, it is simple to design both the cross-section of the opening and the inlet of the medium feed (preferably compressed air) which feed the jet nozzle must handle under pressure.<br>
However, it can be required, that the cross-section of the opening be designed from several, preferably two or three, jet nozzles. Respectively, separate flows of the medium flow issue from these nozzles, fhcrehy. a greater flexibility and independence is given<br>
&gt;  to the relationship of the main flow and the side flows to one another:<br>
r-  to their direction of injection, into the central zone as well as into the peripheral areas of the yarn conduit; and<br>
r  to consideration of different injection air pressures.<br>
In addition, an embodiment of the intertwining apparatus is favored, which characterizes itself in that the main flow - seen in the running direction of the filaments - follows the side flows. The side flows injected into the outer periphery area pick up the filaments passing through the yarn conduit in that area and carry these to the central zone of the yarn conduit in which the filaments subsequently are entwined by the main flow. In this manner, thick and long points, that is nodes, are formed, which exhibit a high degree of uniformity. If contrarily, - seen in the running direction of the filaments - the main flow is placed ahead of the side flows, experience has shown that in general shorter and thinner entwinement points are formed, wherein simultaneously a higher entwinement frequency is attained. This results from the average length of the points and the average width of the interstitial space  between   filaments  and   provides   the  number  of the     points   per  meter.<br><br>
Except by the multifilament yam itself, the entwinement frequency is additionally influenced by:<br>
■	the thread speed upon entwinement<br>
■	the adjusted thread tension and<br>
■	the fineness and structure of the filaments, which can be smooth or crinkled.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the apparatus are derived from the remaining subordinate claims.<br>
The purpose of the invention will also be achieved by a process, which possesses the named features which processes a yam passage with a medium stream which is divided into a main stream and a pair of secondary streams wherein the main and secondary streams are substantially directed in the same direction. Because of the fact, that the medium flow is divided into a main flow and into a pair of side flows, which all are moving essentially in one direction, the main flow is actively reinforced in the central zone of the filament conduit while the side flows in the two peripheral zones prevent an excessive dwell time in these zones, which are ineffective for entwinement. Very strong entwinement points are produced and faulty places are avoided. By means of the coactivity of the main flow and the side flows, a high entwining quality with a minimum medium consumption is achieved.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an apparatus for interlacing a multifilament yam, said apparatus comprising: a housing, said housing having a yarn conduit defined therethrough through which said multifilament yam is transported; a jet nozzle configured with said housing and defining a jet passage for a pressurized medium to flow therethrough into said yam conduit, said jet nozzle further comprising a cross-sectional opening disposed generally transverse to and symmetrical relative to a longitudinal axis through said yam conduit; said cross-sectional opening of said jet nozzle comprising a main channel disposed symmetric to said yam conduit longitudinal axis, and at least two side channels wherein said side channels are disposed a sufficient lateral distance from and on either side of said yam conduit<br><br>
longitudinal axis such that said side channels direct the pressurized medium to opposite peripheral zones of said yam conduit; and wherein said main channel and said side channels are disposed and oriented so as to direct the pressurized medium in generally the same direction into said yam conduit.<br>
Accordingly the present invention also provides a process for interlacing of at least one multifilament yam, the filaments of which are entwined in a yarn conduit means of a medium flow, in particular, a compressed air flow, and the medium flow is apportioned into a main flow and a pair of side flows, whereby the main flow is introduced into the middle zone of the yam conduit and one of the side flows into one segment of the peripheral of the peripheral zone thereof and the other of the side flows into the other segments of the peripheral zone of the yam conduit, therein characterized in that the main flow and side flows are caused to flow in the same direction.<br><br>
In the following, the invention is examined more closely with the aid of the drawings. There is shown in:<br>
FIG. 1 a side view of an embodiment of an intertwining apparatus; FIG. 2 a schematic plane view of a yarn conduit; FIGS. 3 to 15 respectively, a plane view of a cross-section of the opening of a (Irsi embodiment variant of the jet nozzle arrangement in accoi'd with the invention, wherein the main How and side flows are produced by the shape of the cross-section oi~ a jet nozzle; FIGS. 16 to 19 respectively, a plane view of a cross-section of the opening to of a second embodiment variant of the jet nozzle arrangement, in which the main and side Hows are physically separated; FIGS. 20 to 21 respectively, a plane view of a cross-section of the opening oi' a further embodiment variant of the jet nozzle arrangement with two main Hows;<br>
FIG. 22 a sectional view of the yarn conduit; and FIG. 23 a schematic cross-section of the intertwining apparatus.<br>
The intertwining apparatus described in the following can be universally installed for the entwining of multifilament yarns. Smooth as well as crinkled multifilament yarns, are to be understood as being considered in connection with the present invention. The crinkled multifilament yarns are produced, for instance, by imitation twist, stuffing box crimping, or edge drawing. The multifilament yarn is comprised of a number of tllaments. which advantageously consist of thermoplastic plastics, for instance, polyamides. polyester, polyprop) lene. polyethylene. However, viscose, elass, Kevlar®. carbon or other high modular fibers are also included.<br><br>
With the aid of the intertwining apparatus, it is also possible to entwine ine niamenis of several individual multifilament yarns commonly into one multifilament yarn. Further, special effect yarns can be produced, such as mixtures of multifilament yarns with fiber yarns or elastic yarns.<br>
The intertwining apparatus can. Ibr instance, be installed on texturing machines, as well as other machines or equipment, machines for spinning, stretching, or bobbin winding. The muUi 11 lament yarns entwined on the intetwining apparatus are further processed on machines for weaving, knitting, tufting, and similar textile machines. This further processing is without the necessity of a compulsory subsequent treatment of the multifilament yarn, such as sequential winding. . smoothing or the like for the production of the required thread closure.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a schematic profile view of an embodiment of an intertwining apparatus (1) that includes a housing (3) of which the latter possesses several, here a total of two, housing parts (5) and 25. The second housing part (25) is pivotable by means of a swinging arm (7) on a hinge (9), linked to the first housing part (5), forming thereby a cover. By means of a hand grip (11) affixed to the second housing part (25). this second housing part (25) is pivotable upward out of its closed position, which is designated with solid lines, into an open position represented in FIG. 1 by dotted lines.<br>
The intertwining apparatus (1) includes moreover, a yarn conduit (13) which penetrates the housing (3). which, as said, is comprised of the components (5) and (25). When the second housing component (25) is placed in its closed position, then the yarn conduit (13) is cireumferentially closed with the exception of the cross-section of the opening of a (not shown) jet nozzle arrangement. Under these conditions, only on the entry and exit openings of the yarn conduit (13) is the said conduit open.<br><br>
In order to introduce a (not shown in PICi. 1) multitllament yarn into the yarn conduit (13) or to be able to take (he same out without cutting it. then the second housing part (25) is swung up. so that the yarn conduit, throughout its entire length is exposed. The jet nozzle arrangement is connected by means of a feed piping line (14) with a source of the medium, from which source the jet nozzle is supplied with a compressed medium, preferably air. fhe multitllament yarn is subjected to a flow of said medium, that entwines its (1 laments together, upon the yarn running through the straight yarn conduit (13).   A more detailed description of this is provided later.<br>
A U-shaped yoke (15) is afilxed onto the second housing part (25) to serve as a rigid carrier. Installed on each of the bowed arms thereof, of which only the arm (17) is visible in FIG. 1. is a yavn guide (19). As viewed in a vertical direction, the two guides (19) are formed by inverted U-shaped members that open downward, which possess on the upper sides of their interior spaces guiding surfaces (21) for directional change of the multifilament yarn.<br>
In this embodiment example, the yarn conduit (13) is machined into the first housing part (5) in the shape of a channel/groove, which exhibits along its entire length a uniform, semicircular, open cross-section. The top (23) of the yarn conduit (13) is constructed from the flat underside of the second housing part (25). which said part is alTixed to the pivoting arm (7). fhe cross-sectional shape of the yarn conduit 13 can, of course, be designed in a different manner.<br>
FIG. 2 schematically shows a plane view of the first housing part (5) of the apparatus (1). in which the yarn conduit is machined in. This, figuring from the longitudinal central axis (26), as seen at right angles to the running direction ol' die (llaments (arrow 27),this view is subdivided into two figurative, cross-hatched depicted zones, namely, divided into a middle zone (29),and an outer peripheral zone (33).The outer peripheral zone (33) lies between the interior sides of the yarn conduit (13) and the middle zone (29). The peripheral zone (33) is looked upon as a "dead zone".<br><br>
In order to achieve a desired degree of entwinement, the cross-section of the opening (37) of the jet nozzle arrangement presented in FIG. 2 is so designed that the medium flow is separated into one main flow and two side flows. The main flow H passes in the central zone (29) and divides itself by impact against the underside of the housing part, i.e. the top (25), into two partial flow vortices with different directions of turning (FIG. 23). These vortices activate the desired localized intertwining/twisting of the filaments of the multifilament yam. The produced filament can show different local patterns, for instance, braided or plaited patterns. The two side flows, N, which contribute basically nothing to the entwinement of the filaments, flow each in the peripheral zone (33) and lead the filaments which have migrated into the said peripheral zone back into the middle zone (29) of the yam conduit (13), where these are again seized by the main flow H and are thereby entwined. In this way, the duration of the travel of the filaments in the peripheral zone (33) through the yam conduit (13) is minimized, so that unentwined, open yam places are avoided or at least reduced in number. Through the entwinement of the filaments by the medium flow, a structuring of the multifilament yam comes about that optically changes the multifilament yam. By the apportionment of the medium flow into several partial flows, in accord with the invention, the produced effect on points and looping of the individual filaments can be definitely influenced and thereby brought into desired fonn.<br>
In the following, with the aid of FIGS. 3 to 15. a first embodiment of the .jet nozzle arrangement is more closely explained, in which the cross-section of the opening of a single jet nozzle (37) is described. The FIGS. 3 to 15 show respectively a plane view of an embodiment example of the jet nozzle (37) as it vertically enters into the yam conduit (13). The multifilament yam (not shown) runs through the yam conduit (13) in the direction of an arrow (27), thus corresponding to the presentation in the FIGS. 3 to 15, from right to left.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a .jet nozzle 37a, the cross-section of the opening of which is designed symmetrically to the longitudinal center axis (26) of the yam conduit (13) and to a cross axis (41), which makes a right angle (90°) with the said axis (26).<br><br>
The intersection point of the longitudinal central axis (26) and the cross-axis (41) that lies orthogonally thereto, lies about in the center of the yarn conduit (13) when seen at right angles to the longitudinal extension of the yarn conduit (13). This is also in accord with another emhodiment which is not shown. In connection with this present invention, if statements as to symmetry are made regarding a cross-section of a jet nozzle opening arrangement, then the basis thereof must be on a vertical view direction down onto the respective cross-section of the jet nozzle opening, that is, the viewing line coincides with the longitudinal axis [here seen as a point] of the jet nozzle (37) which opens into the yarn conduit (13). Thus, a symmetry statement is only valid in the case of a plane view of the cross-section of the opening of the jet nozzle. The cross-section of the opening ol' the jet nozzle (37a) is designed to be shaped as a cross. The one figurative arm of the cross lies along the central longitudinal axis and the other figurative arm on the cross axis (41). The intersection of the figurative cross arms is rounded off in such a way that the part of the cross-section of the opening that extends itself into the peripheral zones (33) of the yarn conduit (13) of the jet nozzle (37a) is smaller than the part of the cross-section of the opening in the central zone (29) of the jet nozzle (37a)<br>
So. looking across the running direction of the multifilament yarn, because of the differently sized parts of the cross-section of the opening, the medium fiow entering the yarn conduit through the cross-section of the opening of said yarn conduit subdivides itself into the main ilovv H and the pair of side fiows N.<br>
As is obvious from FIG. 3, the main flow defines the central zone. The cross-sections for the main fiow H are so chosen, that the main fiovv always carries a greater volume fiow of the medium in comparison to each of the side fiows N. As mentioned above and as shown in detail in I'lG. 23. the main fiow 11 impacts against the under side of the top (25) which forms the inner top side of the yarn conduit (13). When this happens, two parts of the fiow become vortices, which entwine the filaments of the multifilament yarn.<br><br>
The side flows N. entering into the peripheral /one (33) of the yarn conduit (13). take care that the tllamenls. migrating into the peripheral /one because of the vortexing. are relumed as quickly as possible lo the central /one (29). In this way. there has been brought about a minimizing of the dwell time in which the filaments find themselves in the peripheral zone in which practically no entwining occurs. An excellent entwining result is achieved, since the number of the unentwined. open yarn places has been reduced and the lengths of the faulty locations are shortened.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a jet nozzle (37b). the cross-section of the opening of which is basically V-shaped, whereby, between the arms of the V. a reinforcement (61) of the main flow H is provided. B\ means of this reinlbrcement, the V-shape is changed, essentially, to somewhat of a "W" shape, which together with a triangle Ibrms the cross-section of the opening. The arms of the V-shape, i.e. the "W" shape, extend also in this case into the peripheral /one (33) of the yarn conduit.<br>
FIG. 5 presents a Jet noz/le (37c). which exhibits again a cross shaped or better an elongated X-shaped. cross-section of the opening. Ihe X shape, lying along the longitudinal axis of the conduit, possesses, along that said axis (26) of the conduit (13), a central flow (45) which carries the main flow H and is broader than the cross-arms (47) and (49). These cross arms extend into the peripheral zone (33) and carry the side flow N. The jet no/zic (37c) is designed as symmetric to the longitudinal central axis (26) and to the cross axis (41). The side flows issuing from the cross-arms (47) and (49) of the X-shaped cross-section of the opening carry respectively a smaller volume flow than that in the central zone of the cross-section of the opening. That is, the volume is less than the How from the central partial cross-section of the opening flow (45) designed for the main tlow\ B\ means of the arrow (27). the running direction of the thread through the thread canal becomes evident. From this, the situation is such that the side flows issuing from the ends of the cross-arms (47) and 49 precede the main flow. At the same time, the ends of the cross-arms (47') and (49') which are arranged in mirror image to the cross axis (4!) yield a lagging pair of flows.<br><br>
By means of this arrangement, a very good return transport of the filaments from the peripheral zones (33) is achieved, accompanied by a minimum disturbance of the main flow, which brings about an exceptionally good and uniform qualit\ of the entwinement nodes.<br>
The jet nozzle (37d) depicted in FIG. 6 exhibits an equilateral triangular, cross-sectional opening and is so installed in the yarn conduit (13) that an apex (51). formed by two sides of the equilateral triangle, lies on the longitudinal central axis (26) of the yam conduit (13). The jet nozzle (37d) is designed to be symmetric to the longitudinal central axis (26). The multifilament yarn led through the yarn conduit in the direction of arrow (27) first contacts the entering main flow H in the area of the apex (51) of the cross-section of the opening. The main flow H becomes increasingly greater and is subsequently impacted by the side Hows N. which issue from the areas (51') and (51") of the triangular cross-section ot~the opening, hi this case, experience has shown that a higher entwinement frequency is realizable, when the side flows N extend further into the peripheral zone (33) of the yarn conduit (13). The higher entwinement situation arises, because the entwinement points occur at shorter spatial intervals than those produced by a jet nozzle with the cross-section of the opening of the side Hows N extending less into the peripheral zone.<br>
The jet nozzle shown in FIG. 7. again depicts a cross-sectional opening in the shape of an equilateral triangle, wherein the apex (53) thereof which lies on the longitudinal central axis (26) and is formed by two sides, trails the main flow issuing out of the central area of the cross-section of the opening of the jet nozzle (37e) as seen in the running direction of the multifilament yarn (arrow 27). The multifilament yarn is also first carried over the base of said equilateral triangle. Thereby, contrary to the arrangement of the depicted jei nozzle (37d) of FIG. 6. a more intensive and more uniform entwinement ol' the filaments with long spaced entwinement nodes is achieved. Also, the cross-section of the opening of the jet nozzle (37e) is designed symmetric to the longitudinal central axis (26) (which is true in all other embodiment examples of a jet nozzle in accord with the invention).<br><br>
FIG. 8 shows a jet no/./le (371). which exhibits a cross-section in the shape of an isosceles triangle, wherein the triangle has two equal sides and. contrary to the triangles of FIGS. 6 and 7. is ver&gt; narrow. Because of this arrangement of the jet nozzle, the central part of the cross-section of the opening of the jet nozzle (37f) is very unusual, in particular when compared with those with side zones, which intrude into ttie peripheral areas of the cioss-section of the opening. From this arrangement, there arises a stronger main ilow as opposed to the pair of side flows. The apex (55). formed from the equal sides of this isosceles triangle, lies on the longitudinal central axis (26) in such a way that the multifilament yarn carried through the yarn conduit (13) is first picked up by the main (low. However, simultaneously the pair of side flows becomes active, which flow into the peripheral zone (33) of the yarn conduit from the area of the base of the triangularly shaped partial cross-section of the opening (13).<br>
FIG. 9 demonstrates a jet nozzle (37g) with a I shaped cross-section of the opening., wherein the top cross arm (57) of the T-shaped designed partial cross-section opening precedes that partial cross-section opening formed from the stem of the T as seen in the running direction of the multifilament yarn (arrow 27). The cross arm (57). which is narrower than the stem (59) ol' the T. reaches into the peripheral zone (33) of the yarn conduit (13). I he incoming multifilament yarn first reaches the top of the T shaped cross-sectional opening in which both main flov, and side flows are effective. This so acts, that a more uniform entwining is made, since simultaneously, by means of the side tlow pair, a migration of the multifilament yam into the dead zone (33) is prevented.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a jet nozzle (37h). the opening of which is in the shape of a Y. whereby the essentially V-shaped part of the Y-shape. precedes - as seen in the running direction of the multiniamenl yarn (arrow 27) - the cross-section Ibrnied from the lower stem of the Y. Fhe upper ends of" the V-shaped part of the Y design reach far into the peripheral zones (33) of the yarn conduit (13).<br><br>
Thereby, the filaments of" the multifilament yarn conducted through the yarn conduit (13) are first seized by the side flows emitted from the V-shaped portion of the cross-section of the opening of the jet nozzle (37h) and returned to the middle area (29) of the yarn conduit (13).<br>
Subsequently, the filaments are picked up by the main flow which is issuing out of the stem of the Y-shaped designed partial cross-sectional opening of the jet nozzle (37h) and thereby entwined. By means of this Y-design, of the cross-section of the opening, the main flow is less disturbed by the side Hows and thus said main flow becomes immediately effective, as is the case with the jet nozzle (37h).<br>
In the embodiment shown in FICi. II. the jet nozzle (37i) differentiates itself from the jet nozzle presented in FICi. 10 principally therein, in that the Y-shape of the cross-section of the opening has been altered. The two arms which together form the V-shape of the Y combine in a more acute angle, so that these arms do not extend themselves so far into the peripheral zone (33) of the yarn conduit (13) as do the arms of the Y-shaped cross-section of the opening as shown in FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 12 presents a jet nozzle (37k) which possesses a cross-section of the opening which has evolved from the Y-shape. The stem of the Y. which coincides with the longitudinal central axis (26). is broader in comparison to the Y-shape shown in FIGS. 10, II. Further, the free ends of the stem is constructed relatively short and wedge-shaped.<br>
FIG. 13 presents a fish shaped jet nozzle (371) which is derived from an ellipse and two arms which form a V-shape. The two arms reach into the peripheral zone (33) of the yarn conduit (13), while the ellipse lies with its major semi-axis along the longitudinal central axis (26) of the yarn conduit (13), and thus forms the main flow.<br>
FIG. 14. shows a jet nozzle (37m). which exhibits a V-shape with outwardly curved arms. In other words, the arms of the V-shape are not straight, are bowed away from the central axis.<br><br>
Furthermore, all sharp corners of the cross-section of the opening of the jet nozzle (37m) have been rounded off or are in accord with a further, not shown, radius. The cross-section of the opening is expanded in the central area (29) of the yarn conduit (13). Since in this embodiment the said curved arms extend deeply into the peripheral zone, the filaments are quickK conveyed out of this dead zone.<br>
The jet nozzle shown in FIG. 15. this being nozzle (37n). exhibits what is essentially a cross-section of the opening shape derived from a triangle in which the two arms which form a V-shape with one another. These arms reach into the peripheral zone (33) of the yarn conduit (13).<br>
FIGS. 16 to 19 show, respectively, a plane view of the cross-section of the opening of an additional embodiment variant, with a jet nozzle arrangement (35). in which are designed cross-sectional openings for several, in this case a total of three, jet nozzles, designated (37/1. 37/2 and 37/3) respectively. These embodiments have openings spatially distanced, one from another in the yarn conduit (13) and each shows a partial cross-section of the opening, which together form the cross-section of the opening of the jet nozzle arrangement (35). The partial cross-section of the opening of the jet nozzle (37/1) from which the main flow of the medium emerges into the yam conduit (13) is in any case greater than those of the jet nozzles (37/2) and (37/3) out of which the side flows are injected. The cross-sections of the opening of the nozzles in all embodiments is independent of the number of the jet nozzles and the jet nozzle arrangement is designed symmetrical to the longitudinal axis (26) of the yam conduit (13). as seen from a view point in the direction of the axis of the jet nozzles which open into the jam conduit.<br>
The partial cross-section of the opening which appears in FlCi. 16. features jet nozzles (37/1 to 37/3) which are circular in shape. The centrally located of the jet nozzle 37/1. out of which the main flow of the medium emerges lies at the intersection point between the longitudinal central axis (26) and the cross axis (41). The jet nozzles (37/2) and (37/3) through which, respectively, a side flow enters into the yarn conduit (13)    - as seen in the running of the multifilament yarn (arrow 27) hold<br><br>
precedence over the said jet nozzle (37/1). These jci nozzles (37/2) and (37/3) lie respectively in the peripheral zone (33) of the yarn conduit (13).<br>
The embodiment shown in ITG. 17 of the jet nozzle arrangement differentiates itself from the presented embodiment of FIG. 16 principally in that the partial cross-section of the openings of the jet nozzles (37/1 to 37/3) are designed in the shape of an ellipse.<br>
The major semi-axis of the ellipse that forms the partial cross-section of the opening (37/1) lies upon the longitudinal central axis(26). The major semi-axes of the respectively smaller elliptical, partial cross-sectional openings of the jet nozzles (37/2) and (37/3) lie at right angles to .said longitudinal central axis (26) and oppositely to the partial cross-section of the opening (37/1).<br>
In FIG. 18, we see an embodiment of the jet nozzle arrangement (35) in which the cross-section of the opening is formed from a triangular and two ellipse shaped partial cross-sectional openings. I he jet nozzle (37/1). which exhibits a triangular partial cross-sectional opening, is - seen in the running direction of the multifilament yarn (arrow 27). precedent over the jet nozzles (37/2) and (37/3) in such a wa\ that one side of the partial cross-section of the opening is parallel to the cross axis (41). The multifilament yarn carried in the yarn conduit (13) is first brought over this said one side, so that simultaneously, the main How and the side flows become effective.<br>
The embodiment shown in FIG. 19 ol" the jet nozzle arrangement (35) encompasses two jet nozzles (37/2) and (37/3). the partial cross-sectional area of each being elliptic in shape, and one jet nozzle (37/1), the partial cross-section of the opening of which exhibits a V shape with a centra! expansion 65. This increa.ses the partial cross-section of the opening. The jet nozzles (37/2) and (37/3) from which, respectively, a side flow of the medium emerges into the yarn conduit (13) precede the jet nozzle (37/1) as seen in the running direction of the multifilament yarn, so that the side flow pair initiates the activity. Since the jet nozzle (37/1) with its partial cross-section of the opening extends into the peripheral zone (33) of the yarn conduit (13). the situation is as if along witli the main flow, once again two side Hows enter. The<br><br>
partial cross-section of the opening of the jet nozzles (37/1. 37/2 and 37/3) form in common the cross-section of the opening of the jet nozzle opening arrangement (35). wherein the symmetry to the longitudinal central axis 26 of the yarn conduit (13) remains intact.<br>
In all the descriptions of the jet nozzle arrangement (35) made with the aid of FIGS. 3 to 19. the cross-section of the opening of which is presented with sharp corners, i.e. edges, these corners exhibit a rounding off radius, which lies in a range of 0.03 mm to 0.20 mm because ol"current technical manufacturing reasons.<br>
In a close consideration of FIGS. 16. 17 and 19, it becomes clear that the jet nozzles from which the side (1ov\s oi' the medium enter into the yarn conduit (13) advantageously precede the jet nozzle from which the main flow of the medium enters the yarn conduit (13). That is. the filaments of the multifilament yarn are first interacted with the side flows in the peripheral zone (33) of the yarn conduit, and then subsequently are entwined by the main How which enters into the central zone (29) of the yarn conduit (13). In the case of the embodiment in accord with FIG. 18, the filaments are seized by the main How, but simultaneously also loy the side flows. The back-setting of the side flow pair of the jet nozzles (37/2 and 37/3) [Fig. 18] reinforces the effect of the side flow action, without interfering with the main flow.<br>
Among other effects, experience has shown, that preferentially, a good result is achieved with minimum air consumption, when the main and side flows in reference to placement do not act simultaneously.<br>
Particularly good results were obtained for all kinds ol" yarns with the construction in accord with IIG. 20 or even FIG. 21. The FIG. 20 shows a plane view of an embodiment of the jet nozzle arrangement (35) in which the cross-section of the opening of a jet nozzle (37o) is symmetrical to the longitudinal central axis (26). The cross-section of the opening of the jet nozzle (37o) is composed of two figurative partial cross-sections of the openings, which, in this case, are run together.<br><br>
The first partial cross-section of the opening is essentially C-shaped and extends itself entirely to the edges of the yarn conduit (13). The elliptic second partial cross-sectional opening follows this first partial cross-section of the opening, again seen in the running direction of the multifilament yarn (arrow 27). The main flow of the medium emerges solely from said elliptic opening into the yarn conduit (13).<br>
In the connection area between the partial cross-section of the openings of the jet nozzle (37o), which lies in the area of the intersection of longitudinal axis (26) and the cross axis (41), the breadth of the opening cross section is less than that of the forward rear cross-sections. In accord with a preferential embodiment variant, this configuration causes the main medium flow to be divided into two main partial flows, which act on the multifilament yarn both positionally and chronologically one after another, hi accord with a further (not shown) embodiment variant, the main tlow of the medium is divided in more than two. even into three main partial flows. The "division" is not to be understood as physical, but is brought about especially by means of the shaping of the cross-section of the opening, such as has been realized in the embodiment presented in PIG. 20.<br>
The filaments in the yarn conduit, which are in the peripheral zone (33) thereof, are first impelled into the central area 29 of said yarn conduit by the side flows from the C-shaped partial cross-section of the opening oi' the jet nozzle (37o). These filaments now are seized by the first main flow of the medium and are entwined. By this means, a desirable structuring becomes possible of the filaments, i.e. the multifilament yarn.<br>
FIG. 21 shows another embodiment variant of the jet nozzle arrangement presented in FIG. 20 in which the cross-section of the opening of two jet nozzles (37/1) and (37/2) is designed. The partial cross-section of the opening of the jet nozzle (37/1) has a circular shape from which the main flow of the medium emerges, into the yarn conduit (13). The generallv C-shaped jet nozzle (37/2) directly precedes the jet nozzle (37/1) and extends itself into the peripheral zone (33) of the yarn conduit (13).<br><br>
The two main flows are physically separated from one another, that is. the first main flow in combination with the side flows, and the second main flow are blown into the yarn conduit (13) by two jet nozzles separated from one another. Contrary to this arrangement, as presented in the jet nozzle (37o) of FIG. 20. the main flow and the side flows are expelled in common out of one Jet nozzle into the yarn conduit (13). Upon considering the FIGS. 20 and 21. it becomes clear that the cross-section of the openings of the two Jet nozzle arrangement (35) are very similar to one another. Consequently, veiy similar action is obtained from each.<br>
FIG. 22 presents a sectional view of an embodiment of the yarn conduit (13) through which a multifilament yarn (69) is carried: the yarn being depicted by dotted lines. Into the yarn conduit, opens a Jet nozzle (37). the cross section of which is variable and, for instance, can be designed in accord with the above mentioned presentations of cross-section of the openings in FIGS. 3 to 21. The Jet nozzle (37) is inclined against the longitudinal central axis (26) of the yarn conduit (13) at an angle .delta., which is measured between the axis 71 of the Jet nozzle 37 and the longitudinal central axis (26) of the yarn conduit (13).<br>
In accord with an additional embodiment variant the Jet nozzle (37) is inclined against the longitudinal central axis (26) by an angle .delta., which measures in a range of 60" 
 <br>
However, results with a Jel nozzle inclined against the running direction of the multifilament yarn suffice in many cases for given requirements, so that fundamentally, the inclination of the jet nozzle (37) is practically an optional matter of choice.<br>
In the case of a jet nozzle arrangement (35) in which a plurality of jet nozzles are involved, as described with (he aid of FICiS. 16 to 19 and FKiS. 20. 21. the jet nozzles (37/1. 37/2 and 37/3) each can be differently inclined against the longitudinal central axis (26) of the yarn conduit, and also show different angles of inclination.<br>
The main flow and the side flows act in these cases in directions varying from one another, which makes possible an optimized adjustment of the effective operation of the partial flows of the medium.<br>
In FIG. 23, the effective action of the main flow H and the side flows N of the medium entering the yarn conduit (13) is presented with the aid of a schematic cross-section of an intertwining apparatus. In the depicted embodiment shown here, the main and side flows are not physically separated from one another. Obviously, the functional presentation may be transferred easily to physically separated main and side flows.<br>
The jet nozzle opens at the ba.se of the semi-circular shaped yarn conduit (13) in the central area into which the main flow of the medium, indicated with an arrow H, enters and upon impacting on the top plate (25). divides itself into two partial flow vortices, which show opposite rotation directions. By means of these vortices, the filaments of the multifilament yarn are intensively entwined, so that strong points, i.e. nodes, are formed. In any case, as this flow, vortices, or yarn proceeds, the filaments are also accelerated into the peripheral zone (33) of the yarn conduit (13). which forms a dead space where no entwincment occurs. By means of the side flows N entering the peripheral zone (33). which flows enter approximately concurrently with the main flow H into the yarn conduit (13). the filaments are seized by these side flows and brought back into the central zone (29) of the yarn conduit (13). so that they dwell only for a short time in said dead space of the peripheral zone (33) and are<br><br>
immediately placed again in the main air How, where the occurs. As may be inferred from the right half of the FIG. 23 about the side How N. only a portion of the peripheral zone (33) of the yarn ct&gt;nduit is reached by means of the cross-section of the opening. The interaction varies in accord with how far the peripheral zone (33) is penetrated by the air flow N. In the FIGS. 3 to 21. as an example, the opening in the peripheral zone (33) is shown corresponding to the right half of the FIG. 23. Obviously, the peripheral zone (33) penetrated by the side tlows can extend itself beyond the yarn conduit (13). going on beneath the top cover (25).<br>
By means of this variation, the in regard to nodes, number and thickness as well as frequency of the same can be additionally influenced in a decisive way. For this reason, the FIGS. 3 to 21 are to be understood in connection with these variations, even when it is shown in the Figure that the cross-section of the opening ends at the side of the yarn conduit.<br>
From the description of the FIGS. 1 to 23. a process comes into being for the handling of filament yarns, in order to entwine these yarns. This process includes the apportionment of the medium flow into one main How and a pair of side flows, wherein the main flow is introduced into the central zone of the yarn conduit and one of the side flows into the one part of the peripheral zone and the other side flow into another part of the peripheral zone of the yarn conduit. Main and side flows are guided in essentially the .same direction, so that the directions of the different air flows are not crossing. A certain ditTerent direction of the Hows ma} allowable, provided said directions are staying in die cenixat l^one (29) respective outer peripheral zone (33) (see Fig. 2) and do not pfbssing.. 'me main flow should, generally, carry the largest volume flow as compaWd-ttTeach of the side flows. By means ol~ appropriate adjustment of the size of the side flows as compared to the main flow; the dwell time in which the filaments remain in the peripheral zones of the yarn conduit can be reduced, so that the results of the entwinement can, by said adjustment be positively influenced. In this manner also, unentwined. open yarn places of a definite size also can be reduced. Also, the node number, the size and solidity of the same can be changed with a quantitative certainty. 1 he breadth of the central area in which the<br><br>
actual entwinement takes place as well as the remaining peripheral zones in which latter no entwinement occurs, are all detlned by the main tlow.<br>
In summary, it can be maintained, that by means of the apportionment of the medium tlow into a plurality ot^ (lows, the quality is improved. At the same time, the medium consumption - advantageously accompanied by continued, satisfactory entwinement results - is reduced, so that the costs of the entwinement can be reduced. By means of the effective coactivity of the side tlows with the main tlow of the medium, an increase in the speed of running for the multifilament yarn and concomitant thereto an improved i^roductivity of the intertwining apparatus becomes possible.<br><br><br>
