				<td>COMPOSITE POLYMER ELECTROLYTE COMPOSITION<br>
[0001]<br>
[Field of The Invention]<br>
This  inventior. relates  to  a  composite  polymer<br>
electrolyte composition to be  disposed between a pair<br>
of electrodes of electrochemical devices such as lithium<br>
ion batteries,  fuel cells,  dye-sensitized  solar cells or<br>
electrolytic capacitors.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Non-aqueous electrolyte  solutions containing a<br>
lithium salt are generally used in lithium ion batteries.<br>
The  non-aqueous  electrolyte  solution comprises  an<br>
aprotic polar solvent and  a lithium  salt dissolved<br>
therein.  Carbonates; such as ethylene  carbonate,<br>
propylene  carbonate,  dimethyl carbonate,   diethyl<br>
carbonate  or methyl ethyl, carbonate,  lactones  such as<br>
7 -butyrolactone,  or ethers  such  as  tetrahydrofuran<br>
are examples of the solvent. These organic solvents are<br>
generally volatile and inflammable.  Therefore,  their<br>
use  can  develop  safety  concern when  the  battery is<br>
overly  charged  and  discharged or  short-circuited. Also<br>
liquid  electrolyte  solutions  must  encounter  some<br>
difficulties when  sealing the  battery  in liquid tight<br><br>
manner. The electrolyte solution may be solidified into<br>
a gel but problems of volatilization and inflammability<br>
of the  organic solvent  as well  as  leakage  of liquid<br>
electrolyte  separated from  gel still remain unsolved.<br>
[0003]<br>
Recently a lithium, ion battery has been proposed<br>
which utilizes  a non-aqueous electrolyte comprising a<br>
room-temperature  molten quaternary ammonium  salt<br>
and a lithium  sail   dissolved therein.  See,<br>
JP-A-10/92467,  JP-A-10/265674,  JP-A-11/92467  and<br>
JP-A-2002/11230.  The  molten salt is liquid at room<br>
temperature which is  safe  by virtue  of its<br>
non-volatility and non-inflammability. The molten salt<br>
electrolyte  may be  solidified with  a suitable polymer<br>
into  a  gel.  However,  the  resulting  gel possesses poor<br>
mechanical properties  and often suffers  from phase<br>
separation into 1: quid. Thus problems remain unsolved<br>
with respect  to  handling of electrolyte  and battery<br>
design utilizing   such a molten salt electrolyte.<br>
[0004]<br>
JP-A-10/83321  and JP-A-2000/11 753  propose  a<br>
total  solid polyrrer  electrolyte  prepared by<br>
polymerizing  an ion  conductive  molten  salt monomer<br>
having  a vinyl  group  introduced into  an  imidazolium<br>
salt.  This polymer electrolyte  does  not possess  a<br><br>
sufficient mechar ical  strength.<br>
[0005]<br>
Accordingly,   a  need exists  for  a polymer<br>
electrolyte which is  safe  and having both high ion  <br>
conductivity and satisiactory mechanical strength. <br>
[0006]<br>
[Summary of the  Invention]<br>
The  above  need may be  met by providing a<br>
composite polymer electrolyte  composition by the<br>
present invention. The inventive polymer electrolyte is<br>
produced by polymerizing a  monomeric composition<br>
comprising a  m o 1; e n salt monomer consisting of a<br>
quaternary ammonium  cation having a polymerizable<br>
functional group  and  a fluorine - containing anion,   said<br>
monomeric composition further  comprising a charge<br>
transfer ion  soune,  wherein said polymerization is<br>
carried out  in tho  presence  of an  electrochemically<br>
inert polymeric r3inforcing material.<br>
[0007]<br>
The  charge   transfer ion  source  is  a  lithium  salt<br>
with  a  fluorine-containing anion  or  a  protonized<br>
fluorine-containi ag  anion  depending on whether the<br>
intended use  of the  polymer electrolyte  is for lithium<br>
ion batteries  or  fuel  cells.  When the  electrolyte<br>
composition is  intended   to  use  in  dye  sensitized  solar<br><br>
cells,  the  charge  transfer ion source  is  a redox system<br>
represented by I/I;' pair.   The principle  of the present<br>
invention may  also be  applied to the  electrolyte  for<br>
electrolytic capacitors.  In which case  the  monomeric<br>
composition free  of the  charge  transfer ion  source  is<br>
polymerized in the presence  of the  polymeric<br>
reinforcing material.<br>
[0008]<br>
There  are  several methods for producing a<br>
composite  comprising the   molten salt polymer and the<br>
electrochemically inert  polymeric reinforcing material<br>
such as polyvinilydene  fluoride.  The  first method<br>
comprises the  steps  of dissolving the  molten  salt<br>
monomer containing the  ion source  and the polymer<br>
reinforcing material in a. suitable  solvent,  casting the<br>
resulting solution into a film, and the polymerizing the<br>
film.  The  second method utilizes a polymer reinforcing<br>
material having introduced therein a plurality of<br>
crosslinkable  functional  groups  such as<br>
carbon-to-carbon  double  bonds.  The  second  method is<br>
otherwise  identical to  the  first  method.  The  third<br>
method utilizes  a  porous  sheet  or  film  of the  polymer<br>
reinforcing mater.a1.  The  porous  sheet is  impregnated<br>
with a solution of the molten salt monomer followed by<br>
polymerizing the   monomer  in  situ.  The  polymerization<br><br>
may be carried out by means of heat, light (UV light) or<br>
electron beam irrdiation.<br>
[0009]<br>
The  polymer electrolyte  may be  formed into  a<br>
discrete  film by casting a solution containing the<br>
molten salt monomer on to  a non-adhesive  substrate<br>
such as glass or polyester to form a film, polymerizing<br>
the  film  and then  stripping from the  substrate.<br>
Alternatively, the  monomer solution may be applied on<br>
the  active  substance  layer of an electrode  and<br>
polymerizing the monomer in situ to produce a polymer<br>
electrolyte  film integrally formed with the  electrode.<br>
[0010]<br>
The polymer electrolyte  film produced by the<br>
present invention exhibits remarkably enhanced<br>
mechanical propeities  such  as tensile  strength<br>
compared to the corresponding polymer electrolyte film<br>
not containing the polymeric reinforcing material. The<br>
mechanical properties  may  be  further  enhanced by<br>
copolymerizing the  molten  salt monomer with a small<br>
proportion  of a polyfunctional  monomer. As  a result  of<br>
reinforcement,  the  composite polymer electrolyte<br>
composition of  the present invention enables a compact<br>
battery  having  a high  energy  density to be  fabricated.<br>
[0011]<br><br>
[Preferred Embodiment of  The  Invention]<br>
The  quaternary ammonium  salt having a<br>

[0019]<br>
The chargo transfer ion source for lithium ion<br>
batteries is a lithium salt. Preferably lithium salts<br>
with  a fluorine  containing anion may be  used in the<br><br>
present invention.   Specific examples thereof include<br>
LiBF4,  LiPF6,  Cnp2n+1 CO2Li,  CnF2n+1S03Li wherein n is<br>
1 to 4,  (FS02)2NIi,  (CF3S02)2NLi,  (C2F5S02)2NLi,<br>

and Li(ArS02-N-SO2CF3)  wherein Ar is  an  aromatic<br>
group.<br>
[0020]<br>
The  charge transfer ion source  (proton source)  of<br>
fuel cells  may be  selected from the  anion species<br>
forming the  molten  salt  monomer as  described above.<br>
[0021]<br>
The  charge  transfer ion  source  for  dye  sensitized<br>
solar cells is typically I-/13  redox pair and includes<br>
other pairs  such as  Br/Br3 pair and<br>
quinone/hydroquinone  pair.<br>
[0022]<br>
The  polymer  reinforcing material is  required  to<br>
be  excellent in various properties.  These include<br>
electrochemical/chemical  stabilities  such  as  redox<br>
resistance,  solvent  resistance,  low  water absorption<br>
and flame  retardancy,'  thermal properties  such  as  heat<br>
resistant  and low  temperature  resistance,'  mechanical<br>
properties  such  as  stretchability  and  flexibility,'  and<br>
processability.   Examples  thereof include  fluorocarbon<br><br>
polymers  such  as p olytetrafluoroethylene  and<br>
polyvinylidene  fluoride  polyolefins  such as<br>
polyethylene  and polypropylene;  vinyl polymers  such<br>
as polyacrylonitril e  and polystyrene!  polysulfone<br>
polymers  such  as polysulfone  and polyether sulfone!<br>
polyether ketone polymers  and polyimide polymers<br>
such as polyether imide,  polyamide  imide  and<br>
polyimide;  and copolymers of these polymers.<br>
[0023]<br>
The polymer reinforcing material is preferably a<br>
fluorocarbon polymer and most preferably<br>
polyvinylidene  fluoride,  a copolymer or modified<br>
polymer thereof. The number average molecular weight<br>
thereof ranges between 2,000 and 2,000,000, preferably<br>
between  3,000  and  100,000,  most preferably between<br>
5,000 and 50,000<br>
[0024]<br>
Now the  method of producing the polymer<br>
electrolyte composition of the present invention will be<br>
described in detail taking the  electrolyte  composition<br>
to be  used in lithium ion batteries  as  an  example.  It<br>
will be  easily  appreciated by those  skilled in the  art<br>
that the  disclosed  method is  applicable  to the<br>
production of similar electrolyte  compositions for use<br>
in fuel cells  or  dye  sensitized  solar  cells  as well by<br><br>
changing the charge transfer ion source to another one.<br>
[0025]<br>
As already described, a porous sheet or film of the<br>
polymer reinforcing   material may be impregnated with<br>
a molten salt  monomer containing a lithium  salt<br>
followed by subjection the  monomer to polymerization<br>
in situ.  This method may be  modified by dispersing<br>
fibrous polymer reinforcing material in the molten salt<br>
monomer containing a lithium salt and then subjecting<br>
the  suspension to polymerization.<br>
[0026]<br>
Specific examples of porous materials include<br>
woven or nonwoven fabric  and porous  sheets or films<br>
having a thickness   from  5 to  100M m,  preferably from<br>
10 to 50 M m. The nonwoven fabric preferably has an air<br>
permeability according to JIS  1096 of 5 to 40 cc/m2.sec.<br>
The porous  sheet has  a pore  size preferably from 0.05<br>
to  1µ m and more  preferably from 0.05 to 0.5M m and a<br>
porosity from  20 to  80%,  preferably from  35 to  60%.<br>
These  reinforcing materials may be  prepared by any<br>
known method  using existing  equipment  or  may be<br>
obtained  as  commercial  products.<br>
[0027]<br>
Films of the  composite polymer electrolyte<br>
composition may be fabricated by the step of dissolving<br><br>
a molten  salt monomer,  a lithium  salt  and a polymer<br>
reinforcing material in a  suitable  solvent such as<br>
dimethylacetamide    casting or  applying the  resulting<br>
solution onto  a  substrate  such  as  glass plate  or<br>
polyester film,  subjecting the  solution to<br>
polymerization,  ani stripping the polymer electrolyte<br>
film.  Depending on the  nature  of polymer,  the<br>
reinforcing material would be molten together with the<br>
molten salt monomer in the  absence of solvent.<br>
[0028]<br>
When the  electrolyte  composition is  a polymer<br>
blend of the polymer of molten  salt monomer  and the<br>
reinforcing polymer,  the  proportion of the  reinforcing<br>
polymer is  adjusted to optimize the balance between<br>
the  mechanical properties  and the  ion conductivity of<br>
the  electrode.  The  weight  ratio  of the  reinforcing<br>
material to the  mclten  salt monomer  generally lies<br>
between 0.1  and 0.8, preferably between 0.35 and 0.65.<br>
The  optimum balance  for particular  combinations  of<br>
the  molten  salt  monomer  and the  reinforcing material<br>
may  easily be  determined  empirically.  The  optimum<br>
balance  is  not  needed for polymer  electrolyte<br>
compositions reinforced with a porous polymer sheet or<br>
film because  the  polymer  electrolyte  containing  a<br>
lithium  salt  forms   a continuous  phase.<br><br>
[0029]<br>
The  optimum  balance between the  ion<br>
conductivity  and  the  mechanical properties of the<br>
blend type polymer electrolyte  composition also<br>
depends on the  weight ratio of lithium  salt to the<br>
molten salt monomer.  This ratio  generally ranges<br>
between 0.05  and 0.8,  preferably between 0.1  and 0.7,<br>
most preferably 0.15 and 0.5. The optimum balance for<br>
particular combinations of the  molten  salt monomer<br>
and the  lithium  salt may easily be  determined<br>
empirically.  Wher   porous  sheet  or  film  of reinforcing<br>
material is used,   the ratio of lithium salt to the molten<br>
salt monomer is  adjusted to  maximize  the ion<br>
conductivity.<br>
[0030]<br>
The  molten  salt monomer  may be polymerized<br>
alone  or with  a  copolymerizable  comonomer.  In  a<br>
preferred embodiment,  the  molten  salt  monomer is<br>
grafted to the reinforcing material having a functional<br>
group that reacts with the molten salt monomer. Two or<br>
more  different  molten  salt  monomers  or  monomers<br>
other than  quaternary  salt  type  or poly functional<br>
monomers having  plural polymerizable  groups  may be<br>
used in  copolymerization.<br>
[0031]<br><br>
The  polymeri2 ation reaction may be  conducted<br>
usually  at  a temperature  from  400C   to  200°C    in the<br>
presence  of a polymerization initiator or  a hardening<br>
agent.  Examples  of  initiators for radical<br>
polymerization of carbon-to-carbon unsaturated<br>
monomers include  peroxide  initiators  such as benzoyl<br>
peroxide,  dicumyl  peroxide,  di-t-butyl oxide,<br>
l,l-bis(t-butylperoxy)cyclohexane or cumene<br>
hydroperoxide;  azobis  compounds  such as<br>
2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile or<br>
2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile)»'  and inorganic<br>
initiators such as ammonium persulfate. The amount of<br>
initiator is  normally 0.1-10%  and preferably  1-5% by<br>
weight of the  monomer.<br>
[0032]<br>
When the  polymerizable  group  is  epoxide  group,<br>
amines, acid anhydrides or carboxylic acid may be used<br>
as  a hardening agent. Alkylimidazole  derivatives  may<br>
be  used to  catalyse  the  hardening reaction.<br>
[0033]<br>
The  polymerization may be  conducted by the<br>
irradiation with  UV ray in the  presence  of a<br>
photoinitiator  or electron beam.  In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the polymerization is conducted by means<br>
of electron beam  since  occurrence  of cross-linking of<br><br>
reinforcing mateiial  per se or  graft reaction of the<br>
monomer with the reinforcing material is expected. The<br>
dose  of electron learn ranges from  0.1  to  50 Mrad,<br>
preferably from   1  to  2 0 Mrad.<br>
[0034]<br>
Examples of polyfunctional monomers having two<br>
or more  functional  groups which are polymerizable<br>
with the molten salt monomer includes divinylbenzene,<br>
diallyl phthalate,  ethyleneglycol  di(meth)acrylate,<br>
triethyleneglycol di(meth)acrylate,<br>
trimethylolpropane  tri(meth)acrylate,  pentaerythritol<br>
tetra(meth)acrylate,  triallylcyanurate,<br>
triallylisocyanurzte,  diallyldimethylammonium<br>
bis[(trifluorometl.yl)sulfonyl]imide,<br>
diallyldimethylammonium tetrafluoroborate  and<br>
2,2-bis(glycidyloxyphenyl)propane.  The  poly functional<br>
monomers may be copoly merize d in an amount from 0.5<br>
to   10  mol  %  relative  to the  molten  salt  monomer.<br>

phase  containing   the  charge  transfer ion  source  and<br>
the  reinforcning polymer phase,  the  separated phase<br>
carrying ion  conductivity  and  reinforcing effect,<br><br>
respectively.  In case  of the  composite  electrolyte<br>
composition comprising a porous  reinforcing material,<br>
it is the  continuous phase  of molten salt polymer that<br>
carries the ion conductivity of the electrolyte.<br>
[0036]<br>
The composite polymer electrolyte composition of<br>
the present invention may be  sandwiched between the<br>
opposing pair of electrodes in  an electrochemical<br>
device  such as  lithium ion batteries,  fuel cells,<br>
dye-sensitized solar cells or electrolytic capacitors.<br>
The  electrodes  use d for respective  devices  are well<br>
known in the  art.<br>
[0037]<br>
The electrode pair for use in lithium ion batteries<br>
comprises  an anode  having an active  substance layer<br>
comprised of a carbonaceous  material capable  of<br>
absorption  and  desorption of lithium  ions typically<br>

layer comprised cf a  metal oxide  complex containing<br>
lithium capable of absorption and desorption of lithium<br>
ions  such  as  LiC0O2,  LiFeO,   LiNinCoi-n or  L i M n 2 O 4.<br>
When the anodic active substance is lithium metal or a<br>
lithium  alloy,  the  cathodic  actic  substance  may be  a<br>
metal oxide  or  sulfide  free  from lithium  such  as MnO2,<br>
TiS2,  M0S2,  M0O3  or V2O5.<br><br>
[0038]<br>
Fuel cells  generally utilize  a porous electrode<br>
including a catalyst  such as  Pt.  Dye  sensitized solar<br>
cells  utilize  a  semiconductor electrode  containing  a<br>
sensitizing dye  adsorbed on the  semiconductor layer.<br>
The  counter electrode  is  a conductor electrode<br>
represented by  a Pt vapor deposited glass plate.<br>
Electrolytic capacitors  utilize conventional electrode<br>
pairs for liquid type  electrolytic capacitors.<br>
